[33:40] turning into a different direction
[33:42] yeah it's not the way they thought now
[33:45] it's lingering
[33:46] and i was talking to brother kelly and

[33:50] overseas they say when two elephants
[33:54] are
[33:55] fighting the ground suffer
[33:59] amen

[34:11] suddenly they are in the midst of the
[34:13] war amen so i receive correspondence i
[34:16] mean i can say update from a local
[34:19] brother who is usually in contact to let
[34:21] me know what is going on and how things
[34:23] are going it's not pretty good up there
[34:26] so you keep the believers in prayer if
[34:28] we were in the same situation we wanted
[34:30] somebody to pray for us amen that's one
[34:33] side on the other side if your life is
[34:36] not in serious
[34:38] situation with god
[34:40] i don't know what you need to have in
[34:42] your life to wake up
[34:44] i don't know you might be seated
[34:46] so i don't know what you need in your
[34:48] life to wake up
[34:50] if you have a chance going through the
[34:52] message look at the
[34:54] uh iron curtain just go ahead and tap in
[34:58] russia
[34:59] and it will scare you to death amen
[35:02] but for the blood we happy because we
[35:04] know that our time is joining we're not
[35:06] going to stay here longer amen so if
[35:09] your life is not correct with god
[35:12] i don't know what you need to wake up
[35:14] kovid came you now waking up so this is
[35:17] russia coming up you're still sleeping
[35:19] so you better wake up
[35:20] amen wake up go to the brazen altar make
[35:24] sure your life is completely dead
[35:27] before you rise up there then we can
[35:28] move on to perfection amen
[35:31] lord willing i believe it's this coming
[35:34] saturday we have the sisters meeting
[35:37] you will check your cell phone
[35:39] if you don't receive the message it's
[35:40] not my fault i said it over and over in
[35:43] the hotel so you don't want i need to
[35:44] give brother david your your number so
[35:47] you can get the text message the address
[35:49] will be given to you and the time
[35:51] brother robert it's at 2 30
[35:53] yet 2 30 p.m 2 30 doesn't mean 4 p.m or
[35:58] 5 p.m
[35:59] amen
[36:00] i have almost 55 questions
[36:08] for one meeting
[36:12] how am i gonna answer them
[36:15] amen
[36:16] you have one person sending like four
[36:18] the other one sending like 20 the other
[36:20] person said so if you send me 20
[36:23] question or five question or ten
[36:25] questions i'm not going to go through
[36:26] your question one two three four because
[36:29] we will be probably holding your paper
[36:32] forever so i might have to go
[36:34] spiritically going touch one person and
[36:37] the next and the next and come back to
[36:39] your question amen because i have 55
[36:43] questions it's telling me we need more
[36:45] than one meeting amen and some of the
[36:48] questions i'm wondering if some of you
[36:50] were sleeping at the hotel or not
[36:53] because we cover a lot about
[36:56] how a young lady should behave
[36:59] whether you need to go in the same car
[37:01] with a man no because the answer is no
[37:04] it's there on youtube
[37:06] where the young girl need to hug no it's
[37:09] on youtube

[37:11] we went
[37:12] through all those territory with a lot
[37:14] of detail a lot of scripture and a lot
[37:17] of code so if you miss it
[37:20] and you were sleeping in a hotel
[37:22] when we were preaching

[37:27] to mention your name i have all the
[37:29] themes

[37:32] king of hazaris three fists and esther
[37:35] three banquet i'm waiting for the
[37:37] website to be done then we can change
[37:39] the title so you can view them quickly
[37:42] but if you need reference let me know
[37:44] i'm gonna text to you all the theme from
[37:47] one all the way to 45 so you can you can
[37:51] use the theme as a reference quickly

[37:59] the earring what about
[38:01] the three virtues of a woman all of them

[42:01] and it's my privilege to be with you
[42:03] this evening
[42:04] while we're standing if we would
[42:06] bow our heads for a word of prayer and
[42:08] then we'll get into the word
[42:12] our most gracious and loving heavenly
[42:14] father
[42:15] it is always our privilege
[42:17] to gather ourselves together around your
[42:19] word
[42:20] and then sit at your feet and receive
[42:22] what you'd have for us
[42:24] we've given unto you songs of worship

[42:48] which we find ourselves
[42:50] just grant this lord i'm asking it in
[42:52] jesus christ's name
[42:54] amen
[42:56] and while you're standing if you'd open
[42:57] your bibles to romans the eighth chapter
[43:00] and read verses 17 and 18.
[43:05] we're living in very difficult times
[43:09] and this is what the lord put on my
[43:11] heart
[43:12] and so i am trusting that it will be
[43:15] an encouragement if you will
[43:18] to you all this evening
[43:20] so romans the eighth chapter will read
[43:22] verses 17 and 18.
[43:25] paul writing here he says and if
[43:27] children then heirs heirs of god and
[43:29] joint heirs with christ
[43:31] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[43:33] may also be glorified together
[43:36] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[43:38] present time are not worthy to be
[43:40] compared with the glory
[43:42] which shall be revealed
[43:45] in us
[43:47] you can have your seeds
[43:52] when we look at what's going on in the
[43:54] world
[43:55] um
[43:56] if it wasn't that we have jesus christ i
[43:59] would be nervous
[44:01] because when i read through the
[44:03] scriptures i understand that god's word
[44:05] must be fulfilled
[44:08] and god's word says that this nation
[44:10] must fall
[44:11] it says that all the kingdoms of the
[44:13] world must fall
[44:15] and so everything that's going on in the
[44:17] world today is exactly according to
[44:19] god's plan and purpose
[44:22] god is sovereign
[44:24] nothing happens outside of it being his
[44:26] will
[44:28] you say well what about all the
[44:29] sufferings what about all the things
[44:30] going on in the world
[44:32] well who brought it on
[44:34] if you had accepted jesus christ if you
[44:37] had lived for jesus christ if you had
[44:39] given your heart and heart to jesus
[44:41] christ and you were living according to
[44:42] the word it wouldn't be all this stuff
[44:44] would not be coming
[44:46] but because satan is the one that's in
[44:48] control of this earth
[44:49] that's why we're having the things which
[44:51] we are doing
[44:53] um i won't get into politics that's a
[44:55] bad subject
[44:57] but we know we're living in about we're
[44:59] living in an end time
[45:01] we know that the things going on in the
[45:03] world is anything but happy
[45:05] and like i say if it wasn't for the fact
[45:07] that i knew jesus christ and i knew that
[45:09] he was sovereign
[45:10] really i would be very nervous
[45:13] but because i trust in jesus christ and
[45:15] because i know him as my savior i can
[45:18] rest
[45:19] you know when i did a study on the book
[45:21] of habakkuk that changed my whole
[45:22] concept of faith
[45:25] faith is not believing for something
[45:28] faith is believing in
[45:30] someone
[45:32] if you believe that god is sovereign if
[45:34] you believe that god is all-powerful if
[45:36] you believe that god is able to do all
[45:38] things and you are resting in him then
[45:41] why are we worried
[45:42] because he is the one who's going to you
[45:44] he was the one that's in control
[45:47] i have no idea what tomorrow will bring
[45:50] i'm glad i don't know what tomorrow may
[45:52] bring
[45:53] but see i know he's already been there
[45:55] and because he has already been there i
[45:57] can rest assured that if i walk in his
[45:59] will that he will lead and he will guide
[46:01] me and he will take care of my tomorrow
[46:04] and he takes care of that tomorrow he'll
[46:05] take care of the other tomorrow
[46:07] when we look about healing
[46:10] god's already healed you
[46:12] that's an established fact
[46:14] that's his word
[46:16] well if you can believe it and you trust
[46:18] and you believe in the god that has made
[46:19] the promise then that promise is a
[46:21] reality to you and then you're just
[46:23] waiting for the fulfillment
[46:25] you're merely waiting for the
[46:26] manifestation of the healing that he's
[46:28] already given to you and your body
[46:30] but if you don't believe in him if you
[46:32] don't trust him
[46:34] then all of a sudden then you have
[46:36] worries and doubts and frustrations and
[46:37] all the other things that tend to go
[46:39] with it
[46:40] but here again like i say what what's
[46:42] going on in the world today
[46:45] is it god already knew this was going to
[46:46] happen he knew that covert was com that
[46:49] was covered was going to come
[46:51] he knew the changes it would make within
[46:52] our world order he knew when on 9 911
[46:55] hid in our in our country a few years
[46:57] back he knew the changes that would
[46:59] bring in our nation and he looks at and
[47:01] in all the governments of the world and
[47:03] you begin to look at what's going on
[47:04] within the world and and to the world
[47:06] like i say it it's a fearsome time
[47:09] i mean the ones in in in
[47:12] tetsnia i mean the things they're going
[47:14] through
[47:15] they hadn't planned on this
[47:17] but now they're in the middle of war
[47:20] and russia is frustrated and so they're
[47:22] they're killing civilians
[47:24] they're not worried about killing
[47:26] military they're killed they want to
[47:27] kill the civilians
[47:29] okay but that's satan i mean here again
[47:32] that's going on with that
[47:33] but we but we have to begin to
[47:35] understand
[47:36] that the time that we are living in
[47:38] these are the things which are these are
[47:40] the things which god had said will come
[47:42] to pass
[47:43] so they have to come to pass
[47:46] you know a minister made
[47:48] he quoted in uh when joshua was sitting
[47:51] on a hill and looking over over over
[47:53] jericho
[47:54] the angel of god came unto him and and
[47:56] and joshua drove his sword and says are
[47:58] you forced or for the enemy
[48:00] and i always thought well yeah he just
[48:01] said he was going to say for joshua
[48:04] but when you read the scripture says no
[48:07] he's not for joshua he's not for the
[48:09] enemy
[48:10] what he's for is for god's word
[48:12] what he's for is for god's plan and
[48:14] god's purpose that god's plan and
[48:16] purpose will be fulfilled
[48:18] that is the only thing that god is
[48:20] trying to hurt that that's what that's
[48:22] everything is geared toward that end and
[48:24] so if joshua would have gone and or
[48:27] if he went ahead and he would deal with
[48:29] the will of god then god was for him
[48:32] but if all of a sudden god gave him the
[48:34] instructions of how to take it take over
[48:35] jericho and he said well no i don't
[48:37] think that's a good plan we're going to
[48:38] do it our way then god would have never
[48:40] helped him
[48:42] but as long as he stayed with the word
[48:45] then the word would be fulfilled as long
[48:48] as we stay with the word
[48:50] then the word will be fulfilled but we
[48:53] have to be willing to submit ourselves
[48:55] to him
[48:56] we have to be willing to take our lives
[48:58] and so put it in his hands until it's no
[49:00] longer i who live but it's christ that
[49:02] liveth in me
[49:05] we know that there's things going on in
[49:07] in our in in our in within the message
[49:10] which i find very disturbing
[49:12] but i also know that i mean during the
[49:15] time in which paul lived there was false
[49:17] teachers all over the place paul would
[49:19] go into glacier and he would preach
[49:20] something and then people would receive
[49:22] it with thanksgiving and rejoicing it
[49:24] and no longer sooner had left and people
[49:26] from jerusalem decided to come along and
[49:28] say oh no you've got to go back to the
[49:29] laws of moses
[49:31] and so paul had to go back and he had to
[49:32] correct all the heirs and wherever paul
[49:35] went the false teachers followed after
[49:37] him
[49:38] but this but here again we come down to
[49:40] the understanding these have to be
[49:43] they have to come
[49:45] they have to manifest who they are
[49:48] so that we can manifest who we are
[49:52] jesus jesus christ even even warned us
[49:54] this in matthew he said he said and many
[49:56] shall come and many shall be offended
[49:58] and shall betray one another and shall
[50:00] hate one another
[50:02] he said that many false prophets shall
[50:03] arise and shall deceive many and because
[50:05] iniquity shall abound the love of many
[50:07] shall wax cold and that's what's going
[50:09] on in the world
[50:11] because the iniquity is is as rampant as
[50:13] it is i mean there is no righteousness
[50:15] there is no holiness there is no purity
[50:18] i mean you can't even walk into walmart
[50:20] with seeing
[50:21] well actually it's almost like going
[50:22] into a zoo but i guess that's not a good
[50:25] but but you have to begin to understand
[50:28] they're they're anointed with a
[50:29] different spirit
[50:31] well we are have do we have to let our
[50:33] light shine
[50:36] so that all this wickedness they can
[50:38] look at says why are you so different
[50:40] well i believe in jesus christ
[50:42] oh really that's what makes you so
[50:44] different yeah can i introduce you to
[50:46] him well you know and so there's an open
[50:49] door that we have
[50:50] but anyway but but christ goes on and
[50:52] says but he that shall endure to the end
[50:56] shall be saved
[50:59] it's not who begins the race
[51:02] it's the one who finishes
[51:05] and i've seen many people begin the race
[51:08] and where are they now
[51:10] like our pastor had made mention once he
[51:12] said do you realize he said that
[51:13] everybody that had ever come into into
[51:16] into bible tabernacle if they ever came
[51:18] back he says we need a church three
[51:20] psalms the size that we have right now
[51:23] and where they where did they go
[51:26] some of them came in there they got on
[51:27] fire for god and for some reason the
[51:29] fire went out and they drifted back out
[51:32] into the world and you never see or hear
[51:33] from them again so paul so jesus christ
[51:36] was saying you have to endure
[51:39] unto the end
[51:41] and so in the troublesome times that
[51:43] we're in right now you have to be
[51:44] willing to endure but but endure implies
[51:48] that well i just put up with it but see
[51:50] that that's not that really doesn't work
[51:52] just just by enduring or you know
[51:54] letting everything grow go along and
[51:56] just well you know this is going to be
[51:57] all right and tomorrow might be better
[51:59] no no that that that's that's not the
[52:01] point
[52:02] but to endure you have you have you have
[52:05] to you have to work at enduring you have
[52:08] to work at being a member of a part of
[52:10] the body of jesus christ you have to
[52:12] work at going and
[52:14] and making your your calling in the
[52:15] election sure
[52:17] because if you don't apply the if you
[52:19] don't apply yourselves to continue in
[52:21] the work if you don't apply yourself to
[52:23] continue in the word you will drift
[52:27] and it's a daily battle that you go
[52:29] through
[52:30] it's not always coming sunday and that's
[52:32] fine and maybe i might show up on
[52:33] wednesday if it's convenient and then
[52:35] we'll suddenly come around well i might
[52:36] i might make it you know
[52:38] um okay if
[52:40] so you go ahead and you
[52:41] you go to a restaurant on sunday and you
[52:43] stuff yourself and then you decide
[52:45] you're not going to eat for the rest of
[52:46] the week
[52:47] you're not going to have enough strength
[52:48] to do anything
[52:50] so you have to get into the word
[52:51] continually you have to sit there and
[52:53] continually apply yourself you have to
[52:55] continually feed upon the word you have
[52:57] to continue to get into the tapes i i
[53:00] know i i wouldn't i still minister in
[53:02] india i do that twice a month
[53:04] and and we have 300 messages now in the
[53:06] telugu language
[53:08] and the selection is actually quite good
[53:11] and so i'm encouraging them get into the
[53:13] tapes
[53:14] get into the word read it
[53:16] because if you don't get into the word
[53:18] if you're not constantly in the word you
[53:20] will never gain the strength that you
[53:22] need in order to be able to endure
[53:26] [Applause]
[53:28] we know in the latest in church age one
[53:30] of the things it's lukewarm
[53:33] okay but i look in the message
[53:36] it's not much hotter than the baptist
[53:39] in fact sometimes the baptists have more
[53:41] fire in them than i've seen in many
[53:42] message churches
[53:44] because we have become used to the to
[53:46] what we call the gospel
[53:48] but see it
[53:53] for what do we strive
[53:57] you take a child or just you use a
[53:59] different example
[54:00] i i'm not much on olympics but i i've
[54:03] read about some of their stories some of
[54:05] them they're they they do the things
[54:07] that they do in the olympics like the
[54:09] ones that i know about the gymnastics
[54:10] that's the one i read about the most
[54:14] their parents wanted them too
[54:18] their parents pushed them too
[54:21] but something within the child sparked
[54:23] them
[54:25] and they say hey i really i really want
[54:28] to do this
[54:30] then they began to apply themselves
[54:33] then they began to exert all of the
[54:35] energy and all of the training and
[54:37] everything all of the encouragement that
[54:39] the coaches would give them and they
[54:40] would exceed beyond what the coaches
[54:42] thought was possible for them to to
[54:44] produce
[54:46] because it came from inside of them they
[54:48] had the desire
[54:50] but see i look at i i look at the
[54:52] message churches i wonder where's our
[54:54] desire
[54:55] where is our on fire for god where is
[54:57] our when we when we go someplace
[54:59] is our life a witness to us that you're
[55:02] going around in nice smiling faces even
[55:04] though you're miserable you're nice
[55:05] smiling faces and you say you you greet
[55:07] them night i mean we go to we go to the
[55:09] to the grocery store
[55:11] how are you doing you know they ask well
[55:13] he says well if we're doing fine how are
[55:14] you doing i said we're doing great are
[55:16] you doing great and they look at me kind
[55:18] of well um yeah okay and then we get a
[55:21] little conversation going and it changes
[55:23] their whole day
[55:25] like i go to the bakery
[55:27] because i like their bread
[55:29] and so the lady was cutting it and i
[55:30] noticed she just decorates cakes
[55:33] and so i asked her how she was doing
[55:35] that i says do you get to lick the bowl
[55:38] and she smiled
[55:40] but see that might have been the only
[55:41] time in her whole day that somebody
[55:43] actually gave her something to smile
[55:45] about
[55:46] that might have changed their whole
[55:47] attitude for the day i mean i don't know
[55:49] but here again this is something that
[55:51] comes to mind and so you talk with them
[55:52] you give them a conversation you're kind
[55:54] and considerate to them you acknowledge
[55:56] who they are and what they're doing and
[55:58] you mean and here again you begin to
[56:00] show yourself the way you care about
[56:01] them as an individual
[56:04] but so
[56:05] we have to get out of the out of lady
[56:07] osea
[56:08] because see that we are no longer
[56:10] supposed to be in ladies here
[56:12] we are supposed to be in revelations of
[56:15] 4 and 1. john come up higher because i
[56:17] have things i want to show you
[56:19] what was god doing through the prophet
[56:21] he said hey you're the bride come up
[56:23] higher i got some things i want to show
[56:25] you and we're only to get to see the
[56:27] deeper things of god simply because god
[56:30] has through the prophet he has revealed
[56:32] all of these things to us
[56:33] the baptist have no idea what's going on
[56:36] my my son-in-law he was starting to
[56:38] teach on the church ages and we attended
[56:41] his service i was curious anyway and uh
[56:44] i'm yet it's good uh baptist teaching as
[56:46] far as baptist teaching could go but
[56:48] there was no revelation there was
[56:50] literally no understanding until we
[56:51] understand they couldn't they could not
[56:53] see the serpent seed they could not see
[56:55] satan going all the way through the
[56:56] church ages and this is what god was
[56:58] trying to show us through the prophet's
[57:00] message the satan started out here it
[57:02] started out with
[57:03] with the deeds of the nicolasians and it
[57:05] progressed and progressed and progressed
[57:07] and now that same spirit has invaded
[57:09] into the into the message
[57:12] but see we are not to be partakers of
[57:14] any of that
[57:15] we are not to be under the leadership of
[57:17] a man we are supposed to be under the
[57:19] leadership of the holy spirit the holy
[57:21] spirit is supposed to be leading and
[57:22] guiding your lives
[57:24] and if you haven't come to the place
[57:25] where he does that you need to make a
[57:27] better connection with him
[57:31] endure means to remain have fortitude or
[57:34] to persevere
[57:36] it's not just laying back well i hope
[57:38] it'll change and i hope it will be
[57:39] better tomorrow no endure means you have
[57:41] to apply energy
[57:43] you have to seek it out you have to you
[57:45] have to get in you have to get in and
[57:48] make a relationship with jesus christ
[57:51] where he literally becomes the very
[57:52] center of your life
[57:54] because anything short of that
[57:56] will not work
[57:58] when we go back into romans we start out
[58:00] here romans 8 18 it says for i reckon
[58:02] that the sufferings of this present time
[58:05] are not worthy to be compared with the
[58:07] glory
[58:08] which shall be revealed in us
[58:11] and i began to look at that i began to
[58:13] what is this glory that paul was trying
[58:15] to talk about
[58:16] because you see the sufferings of the
[58:18] present time he said they're not even
[58:19] worthy they don't even hold a candle to
[58:21] what's coming
[58:23] and that was in paul's day
[58:26] but we see we're at the end
[58:28] we're at the time when everything is
[58:30] going to come into its fulfillment we
[58:32] are going to experience this glory
[58:35] we are going to be a part of the
[58:37] changing of our body we're going to be a
[58:38] part of the rapture we're going to be
[58:40] trying all of these all of these things
[58:42] and so and and so paul is trying to
[58:44] encourage them he says don't look at the
[58:46] situations of today
[58:48] no look at what's coming
[58:51] focus the focus of the end of the end of
[58:53] the race focus at the glory which god
[58:55] has said will be revealed in you
[58:57] and see right now in paul's day that was
[58:59] 2 000 years ago but see now we are at
[59:02] this time we're at the time when we're
[59:05] actually going beginning to see the
[59:07] fulfillment of these scriptures
[59:13] the rap the process of the rapture has
[59:15] begun
[59:17] it's not a single time event
[59:20] and in thessalonians if we believe that
[59:22] jesus died and rose again even so them
[59:24] also would sleep in jesus god will bring
[59:26] with him
[59:28] okay
[59:29] that means all of the all of the saints
[59:31] that have died on have died since
[59:33] pentecost
[59:35] they're going to rise
[59:38] paul james john timothy matthew and a
[59:40] whole bunch of the rest of them
[59:43] i mean there's going to be
[59:44] what tens of thousands millions
[59:48] and you're going to be able to talk to
[59:49] them
[59:51] i mean literally you're going to be able
[59:52] to convert i don't think there'll be a
[59:54] language barrier at that point in time
[59:56] but you'll be able to see them and
[59:57] you'll be able to talk to them you'll be
[59:58] able to ask them how it was in their day
[1:00:00] and and they will come and encourage you
[1:00:02] hey you know brother branham from the
[1:00:04] types we have it's 30 or 40 days from
[1:00:06] the time of the resurrection all of a
[1:00:07] sudden then our we get our change
[1:00:11] but all of them are coming
[1:00:15] do you comprehend that
[1:00:17] all of them
[1:00:19] are coming
[1:00:21] and they are coming for what to
[1:00:23] encourage us to finish the race
[1:00:26] don't look at today because things are
[1:00:27] going to get worse
[1:00:29] if you think they're bad now wait wait
[1:00:30] till tomorrow
[1:00:31] it's going to get worse wait till next
[1:00:33] week it'll get even worse why because
[1:00:36] it's the end time but see it's going to
[1:00:38] come to the time it's going to come to
[1:00:40] the place where we as the bride are
[1:00:42] going to get so sick and tired of this
[1:00:43] world and all the things that are going
[1:00:45] on will say even so come lord jesus
[1:00:47] but see we have to come to a place in
[1:00:49] our relationship with jesus christ we
[1:00:52] really want him to come
[1:00:57] some don't
[1:01:02] because they like this world
[1:01:05] they like doing what they're doing
[1:01:08] they don't want their sins to be
[1:01:09] revealed
[1:01:11] they don't want everybody to know what
[1:01:13] they have been doing
[1:01:15] so they're not looking for the rapture
[1:01:17] they're not looking for this change no
[1:01:19] they're they're they're willing to to go
[1:01:20] ahead and let let the world keep going
[1:01:22] the way they're going because they're
[1:01:24] like living in this world
[1:01:26] i have found nothing in this world i
[1:01:28] like
[1:01:31] i mean it's getting worse and worse and
[1:01:32] even anyway but but all of these are
[1:01:35] going to come
[1:01:37] we're going to see all of them
[1:01:39] we're going to talk to them what's going
[1:01:41] to happen all of a sudden you're sitting
[1:01:42] at your at your in your in your in your
[1:01:45] house and you get a knock on the door
[1:01:47] and one of your your parents which have
[1:01:48] gone on they knock at the door and they
[1:01:51] hey hey son daughter i'd like to have
[1:01:54] breakfast with you
[1:01:56] that'll change your attitude
[1:02:02] and talk about having faith after that
[1:02:05] man nothing will stand in the way
[1:02:08] but see this is what's coming
[1:02:11] this is what's coming this is the glory
[1:02:13] that's going to be revealed in us
[1:02:15] because when they come forth all of a
[1:02:17] sudden i know in 30 days i'm going to be
[1:02:19] a young man again
[1:02:21] no more aches and pains i'll be back to
[1:02:22] 120 pounds and you know
[1:02:25] i'll be back to you know what i would
[1:02:27] like to be in that regard but see 30 or
[1:02:30] 40 days after the after there after the
[1:02:32] resurrection takes place all of a sudden
[1:02:34] i know i'm going to be changed
[1:02:36] there'll be no doubt in my mind at that
[1:02:38] point in time okay i'm looking for that
[1:02:40] change and i'm waiting for any day any
[1:02:41] day come on let's go let's go
[1:02:46] it says for the lord himself shall
[1:02:47] descend from heaven with a shout out the
[1:02:49] voice of the archangel the trump of god
[1:02:51] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[1:02:54] when we talk about the shout brother
[1:02:55] branham said it's this message
[1:02:58] but see there's there's some things
[1:03:00] which we
[1:03:01] when i was researching some of this i
[1:03:03] began i ran across a few a few
[1:03:05] interesting
[1:03:07] items if you will
[1:03:10] when brother branham's discernment began
[1:03:12] in the early 50
[1:03:14] that was the son of man revealing
[1:03:16] himself through the prophet
[1:03:18] because that was discernment
[1:03:20] which means he had already descended
[1:03:23] he was already coming from that
[1:03:25] dimension into this dimension because he
[1:03:27] was trying to take a bride and take a
[1:03:29] bride and prepare them for the rapture
[1:03:32] and so god was using that man he was
[1:03:35] speaking through him in the in the lines
[1:03:37] of discernment and as it progressed in
[1:03:39] brother branham's life because brother
[1:03:40] branham in 1950 he didn't know he was
[1:03:43] the prophet to the age
[1:03:46] he thought billy graham was
[1:03:48] i mean i i can show you quotes on that
[1:03:51] but this was 50 he was just beginning
[1:03:53] his ministry
[1:03:56] it took a while for him to realize i
[1:03:58] mean he realized he was a prophet he had
[1:04:00] come to that realization before this
[1:04:03] but here again god was beginning to mold
[1:04:05] him and make him to the place where god
[1:04:08] could so speak through him
[1:04:09] until until we would have confidence in
[1:04:12] the things god was trying to tell us
[1:04:14] through him
[1:04:15] that's why the miracles
[1:04:17] that's why the healing that's why
[1:04:18] they're prayer lines
[1:04:19] what he what was his theme jesus christ
[1:04:21] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:04:23] from the beginning of his ministry that
[1:04:25] was that was that was the message which
[1:04:27] he was trying to portray because god
[1:04:29] does not change
[1:04:30] well if god does not change what he was
[1:04:32] yesterday he is today what he was what
[1:04:34] he manifested in brother branham he will
[1:04:36] manifest in you
[1:04:40] not necessarily in discernment not
[1:04:42] necessarily in some other thing but as
[1:04:44] far as when it goes for prayer for the
[1:04:46] sick and seeing the sick heal if you
[1:04:48] have the faith to believe it you can go
[1:04:49] ahead brother branham continually refers
[1:04:52] to that he said he says you don't have
[1:04:54] to wait for your pastor to pray he says
[1:04:56] the power of god lives in you
[1:04:59] so he says you take your hand and you if
[1:05:01] you can if you can recognize that you're
[1:05:03] sitting next to a son or daughter of god
[1:05:06] and you take your hand and place it on
[1:05:08] that person and you pray for that person
[1:05:10] god will heal that person because god in
[1:05:12] you is going to reach out to that person
[1:05:14] and going to heal them
[1:05:16] it's that simple
[1:05:19] [Music]
[1:05:22] we make it complicated it's not
[1:05:25] jesus christ is here he's wanting to
[1:05:28] express himself he's wanting to manifest
[1:05:30] himself but he needs people who believe
[1:05:32] him
[1:05:34] we sing only believe only believe all
[1:05:36] things are possible and it is
[1:05:39] but do you believe the song you sang
[1:05:41] we say jesus is here jesus is there
[1:05:43] therefore all things are possible if you
[1:05:45] would believe that then why aren't any
[1:05:47] of us sick
[1:05:53] i'm just throwing it out okay but if
[1:05:56] jesus is here the same jesus that healed
[1:05:58] the same jesus that torches your
[1:06:00] salvation the same jesus the purchaser
[1:06:02] here if he is here then when you walk
[1:06:04] out this door there should not be
[1:06:05] there's none should not be a sick one
[1:06:07] amongst us
[1:06:08] but you have to believe
[1:06:11] like i say faith is not believing for
[1:06:13] something faith is believing in someone
[1:06:16] and if you can believe that that god is
[1:06:18] all-powerful and almighty if you believe
[1:06:20] that god is sovereign in everything that
[1:06:21] he does if you can accept him in that
[1:06:24] capacity then why are you worried
[1:06:27] why do you fret why do you why are you
[1:06:29] concerned about tomorrow
[1:06:32] because that god already knows
[1:06:35] and if you have and
[1:06:37] one of the things that i that i after
[1:06:39] reading in habakkuk have it's an
[1:06:41] interesting little i mean it's only
[1:06:42] three chapters
[1:06:43] habakkuk had to come to the realization
[1:06:47] that he that he had to take in place his
[1:06:49] total faith and confidence in god
[1:06:52] and he had to come to the place in the
[1:06:55] the last part of habakkuk he said even
[1:06:58] though there is nothing even though
[1:07:00] there is total destitution
[1:07:03] even though he has resisted reducing no
[1:07:05] food and no clothing and no housing and
[1:07:07] no water no nothing
[1:07:09] yet he still i will worship god as if i
[1:07:12] possessed everything
[1:07:14] what i possess will not affect how i
[1:07:16] worship my god i will worship him and i
[1:07:19] will honor him and i will and i will do
[1:07:21] with all of the energy that i have i
[1:07:23] will worship and praise him even if i am
[1:07:25] reduced to nothing
[1:07:27] [Music]
[1:07:30] but see we have to come
[1:07:33] to the same.
[1:07:38] if all of a sudden tomorrow you have
[1:07:40] nothing
[1:07:42] will you still worship god
[1:07:45] and will you worship him as if you
[1:07:47] possessed
[1:07:49] everything
[1:07:52] because in my opinion it's coming
[1:07:54] anyway
[1:07:57] invert in the first seal brother branham
[1:07:59] changed he says i no longer call you
[1:08:01] church
[1:08:02] i call you bride
[1:08:07] in the first seal when the seals were
[1:08:08] open brother branham said that is when
[1:08:10] the seventh angel messenger began to
[1:08:12] sound his message
[1:08:16] and he turned he was no longer
[1:08:17] interested in going to the
[1:08:19] denominational churches
[1:08:21] he was interested in taking the bride
[1:08:23] that had taken hold of the message and
[1:08:25] he wanted them to be able to grab hold
[1:08:27] of who they are and what they are
[1:08:30] and so his whole message focused now on
[1:08:32] the bride
[1:08:33] not the church world the bride itself
[1:08:36] and that's who we are
[1:08:39] we know that the south the bible in
[1:08:40] romans 8 19 the earnest expectation the
[1:08:43] earnest expectation of the creature is
[1:08:45] waiting
[1:08:46] for the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:08:50] that the whole creation is waiting and
[1:08:52] groaning for us to realize who we are
[1:08:56] but see we still think of ourselves as
[1:08:58] sinners saved by grace
[1:09:00] when i was in the baptist church i was a
[1:09:02] sinner
[1:09:03] saved by grace
[1:09:05] in the pentecostal church i was a sinner
[1:09:08] saved by grace
[1:09:10] i'm still a sinner saved by grace but
[1:09:12] now i am also a child of god that has
[1:09:13] been fully restored to his position with
[1:09:15] his father
[1:09:17] and now all i'm waiting for is for the
[1:09:18] adoption of my body with the changing of
[1:09:20] my body so i can have the relationship
[1:09:22] with my father that i desired to have
[1:09:24] from the beginning because i was a part
[1:09:26] of him from the beginning and now it's
[1:09:28] time for me to come into full
[1:09:29] manifestation so i can literally become
[1:09:31] a son of god in the full manifestation
[1:09:33] as a son of god where i can speak in
[1:09:36] whatever i speak i know that it will
[1:09:38] happen because god has anointed me to
[1:09:40] speak that word
[1:09:41] [Music]
[1:09:43] this is where this is the this is the
[1:09:45] glory
[1:09:47] this is the glory that is to be revealed
[1:09:49] in us
[1:09:51] not unto the church well no in us and
[1:09:53] the in the sons and the daughters of god
[1:09:55] when we begin to take our place
[1:09:57] when we begin to realize that we are
[1:09:59] sons and daughters of god and we begin
[1:10:02] to realize that we can go ahead and we
[1:10:04] can defeat satan
[1:10:09] satan is a tool in the hands of god
[1:10:14] he's a bulldog on a chain
[1:10:17] he can only go as far as god lets him go
[1:10:20] [Music]
[1:10:21] and you have the power to tell him to
[1:10:25] to leave
[1:10:29] but you have to believe
[1:10:31] you know brother brother branham says
[1:10:33] the token today is the is the life of
[1:10:35] jesus christ
[1:10:37] it's not the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:10:40] no now it has to be the life of god in
[1:10:42] us expressing itself through us
[1:10:44] and so when you stand before satan and
[1:10:46] all of a sudden you're going to command
[1:10:48] him no there has to be the life of jesus
[1:10:50] christ in you which is sitting there and
[1:10:52] can express itself to
[1:10:54] satan where he knows you're not a bluff
[1:10:57] that as he did as he stood before jesus
[1:10:59] christ and he tried to have jesus christ
[1:11:01] do something which was contrary to the
[1:11:03] word
[1:11:03] all of a sudden when he realizes he's
[1:11:05] fighting the jesus christ in me
[1:11:08] okay all of a sudden he realized hey
[1:11:09] we're on a different page
[1:11:11] hey you know this guy actually believes
[1:11:13] who he says he is this guy actually
[1:11:15] believes in the atonement this guy
[1:11:16] actually believes in the spoken word
[1:11:18] this guy actually believes in the
[1:11:19] message of the hour
[1:11:22] but see it comes it has to be a change
[1:11:24] in our thinking
[1:11:28] the bible brother branham says you are
[1:11:30] the pure virtuous sinless bride of jesus
[1:11:32] christ
[1:11:34] you have been fully redeemed
[1:11:36] you're fully justified
[1:11:38] that's just as if you never sin
[1:11:41] so forget about what you did yesterday
[1:11:43] or today and begin to realize that there
[1:11:45] is nothing held against your charge that
[1:11:48] god views you as sinless as god himself
[1:11:50] is sinless and that should give you the
[1:11:52] faith and the ability to stand before
[1:11:54] satan and satan will remind you
[1:11:56] oh but what you did yesterday oh what
[1:11:58] about the day before that
[1:12:00] man what a mistake you made back then
[1:12:03] yeah but that's all under the blood
[1:12:06] god can't find it well if god can't find
[1:12:09] it why should i remember it and
[1:12:10] therefore i can stand before him and say
[1:12:12] no i am the pure verse to a sinless
[1:12:14] bride of jesus christ
[1:12:16] i am the living manifestation of the
[1:12:18] word for this day
[1:12:21] brother branham told me i am the living
[1:12:23] manifestation of the word for this day
[1:12:26] i was a part of god from the beginning i
[1:12:28] came into manifestation i recognize now
[1:12:31] who i am and because i recognize that i
[1:12:33] am i am a son of god i therefore because
[1:12:35] i can recognize my position i can sit
[1:12:38] there and in my position i can command
[1:12:43] [Music]
[1:12:46] now if you're working for somebody you
[1:12:48] have a boss
[1:12:51] most people i would assume have a boss
[1:12:54] okay and so you take orders from your
[1:12:56] boss
[1:12:57] theoretically okay
[1:12:59] but see when you're the boss
[1:13:01] then everybody takes orders from you
[1:13:04] okay
[1:13:05] but see we're part of a kingdom
[1:13:07] we rule and reign with christ
[1:13:12] we are not superior to him we are not
[1:13:14] beneath him we are equal we are co-equal
[1:13:16] with him because we are his son and he
[1:13:18] has given us the authority
[1:13:21] what did he tell the disciples he says
[1:13:22] go into this village in these villages
[1:13:24] cast you know heal the sick raise the
[1:13:26] dead cast out demon i have freely given
[1:13:28] you this ability now freely use
[1:13:31] that has never been taken back
[1:13:35] but see the disciples knew this
[1:13:38] the day of pentecost finally finally
[1:13:40] came all of a sudden that's what they
[1:13:41] did they healed the sick they raised the
[1:13:43] dead they cast out demons because they
[1:13:45] knew they had the authority because that
[1:13:47] authority was given to them
[1:13:49] were they perfect
[1:13:51] oh no way shape or form
[1:13:54] but they knew who they were
[1:13:58] brother branham said jesus could do the
[1:13:59] things that he did
[1:14:01] because he knew who he was
[1:14:04] and now it's up for the bride to realize
[1:14:06] who she is and if you can realize who
[1:14:09] you are in jesus christ and you can
[1:14:11] realize you are a son and a daughter of
[1:14:13] god
[1:14:14] then satan should not have any power
[1:14:16] over you
[1:14:19] in revelation 10 7 it says in the days
[1:14:21] of the voice of the seventh angel and he
[1:14:23] shall begin to sound the mystery of god
[1:14:26] is going to be finished
[1:14:29] and what is this mystery of god
[1:14:31] paul in colossians says what is this
[1:14:33] mystery
[1:14:34] he says it's been here down from ages
[1:14:36] and generations but has now made
[1:14:37] manifest to the saints which is christ
[1:14:40] in you
[1:14:42] the hope of glory
[1:14:44] it's christ living in you
[1:14:47] you know jesus never performed one
[1:14:49] miracle
[1:14:52] no it was the father in him
[1:14:54] brother branham never performed one
[1:14:56] miracle
[1:14:57] he was a father that dwelt in him
[1:15:00] paul never performed any miracles peter
[1:15:02] never performed any miracles
[1:15:04] no he was the god in them
[1:15:07] but they had to be in communion with
[1:15:09] that god
[1:15:10] they had to have a relationship with
[1:15:12] that god where where that god could
[1:15:14] speak to them and they would then they
[1:15:16] could listen
[1:15:17] and then if they would listen they would
[1:15:19] obey what god told them to do and it
[1:15:21] didn't matter what tomorrow was
[1:15:24] i mean you look at the life of paul
[1:15:27] how often he was shipwrecked how often
[1:15:29] he was beaten he said a day and a night
[1:15:30] he spent swimming around in in in the
[1:15:32] mediterranean
[1:15:34] he had to hang on the boards or whatever
[1:15:36] it was until he finally got rescued
[1:15:38] he was stoned a few he was stoned and
[1:15:40] left for dead once he was beaten i don't
[1:15:42] know how many times are you thrown in
[1:15:43] jail
[1:15:45] oh yeah easy life right
[1:15:47] easy life
[1:15:50] but he didn't worry about tomorrow he
[1:15:52] said the sufferings of this present time
[1:15:54] are not even worthy to be compared to
[1:15:56] what the glory is going to be revealed
[1:15:57] in me
[1:16:00] and we do we struggle shall we struggle
[1:16:02] but the struggling we have is more
[1:16:04] mental than it is anything else
[1:16:06] but see we have to we have to overcome
[1:16:08] all of this we have to begin to accept
[1:16:10] what god says that we are
[1:16:18] in 1961 brother bannon makes a statement
[1:16:22] but see now remember he explained that
[1:16:24] by sodom he says and this
[1:16:25] and this is the time of sodom when the
[1:16:27] world is going to be burned not drown
[1:16:29] but burn it's going to be burned and
[1:16:31] this sign has was to return not an ark
[1:16:34] but but a god dwelling in the flesh of
[1:16:37] his people in his church
[1:16:39] this was 61.
[1:16:42] he's talking about when when god
[1:16:44] appeared to abraham and read this into
[1:16:46] secrets of of the heart of sarah
[1:16:51] he was saying this was the son of man
[1:16:52] being revealed
[1:16:55] this was god coming down and this is and
[1:16:57] god is coming down and god's going to be
[1:16:59] dwelling in the flesh of his people
[1:17:02] and they say oh yeah that was brother
[1:17:04] branham no god's people
[1:17:08] sons and daughters of god
[1:17:11] you see if you if
[1:17:14] how many have received the holy spirit
[1:17:16] willing to admit it
[1:17:17] okay that's good
[1:17:19] what did you receive
[1:17:23] the third person of a trinity
[1:17:26] the same god that from you know from
[1:17:28] from the from genesis
[1:17:30] the one that created all things
[1:17:33] the one that healed the sick the one
[1:17:34] that raised the dead the one that cast
[1:17:36] out demons the one that walked on the
[1:17:38] waters the one that still the storms
[1:17:42] so what do you do with him
[1:17:46] you hide him
[1:17:49] are you going to release him
[1:17:52] are you by your faith going to allow
[1:17:54] that god that dwells in you to use you
[1:17:56] so he can express himself through you
[1:18:00] brother branham had to come to a
[1:18:02] relationship with god work where he no
[1:18:04] longer did his own thing but he listened
[1:18:06] to what the father was telling him and
[1:18:08] he went wherever he was directed by that
[1:18:10] spirit to go
[1:18:12] it wasn't brother branham living it
[1:18:14] wasn't brother branham striving it
[1:18:16] wasn't brother branham trying to pray it
[1:18:18] up or bring it down or whatever no he
[1:18:19] said the spirit of god that dwelt in him
[1:18:21] he said he would take and he would yield
[1:18:23] himself to that spirit and that spirit
[1:18:25] would lead him and guide him and direct
[1:18:27] him
[1:18:28] well what's the difference
[1:18:32] what's the difference between him and
[1:18:34] you
[1:18:36] can't god lead you
[1:18:40] if somebody has a need can't you
[1:18:41] minister to that person
[1:18:44] will you allow the god in you to
[1:18:46] minister to that person
[1:18:48] amen
[1:18:50] but you have to allow him
[1:18:52] you can stop god
[1:18:56] you can say well lord i'm too busy today
[1:18:58] i don't feel like going there today
[1:19:00] go find somebody else you know i got my
[1:19:02] schedule laid out for today and i just
[1:19:03] can't fit that in so you need to find
[1:19:05] somebody else to do that today
[1:19:09] i mean there was a brother
[1:19:11] he won't mind me saying that there was a
[1:19:13] brother in our church and he had had a
[1:19:16] surgery on his elbow
[1:19:19] the surgery was as good as i guess as
[1:19:21] the doctors could do and then he had
[1:19:22] developed an infection
[1:19:25] other doctors treated with antibiotics
[1:19:27] and they did the best which they could
[1:19:29] and it seemed to clear up and then it
[1:19:30] came back and then it came on back again
[1:19:33] only this time worse
[1:19:35] and uh so then he end up end up ending
[1:19:37] up in charlotte
[1:19:39] i don't like going to charlotte i don't
[1:19:41] like where there's more than 10 cars you
[1:19:43] know you know in a parking lot
[1:19:46] where we live after 50 cars have gone by
[1:19:48] our street we have reached the quota for
[1:19:50] today nobody else has to come
[1:19:53] i like living in the country okay but
[1:19:56] anyway that the brother was in charlotte
[1:19:58] and the lord told me go pray for him
[1:20:02] well i'm not the pastor i'm not the
[1:20:04] trustee i'm not one of the deacons
[1:20:06] um there's plenty others in the church
[1:20:08] i'm you know i got my schedule laid out
[1:20:10] today and well um yeah maybe i could fit
[1:20:12] it in you know but not today maybe next
[1:20:15] week we could and uh no if i had refused
[1:20:19] to go
[1:20:20] what god wanted me to do for the brother
[1:20:22] would have never happened
[1:20:25] so i drove into charlotte found the room
[1:20:27] he was in we'd visited for a little bit
[1:20:29] and i asked him i said you know why i'm
[1:20:31] here he says well no not really he says
[1:20:33] god sent me here to pray for you because
[1:20:35] we're no longer dealing with with the
[1:20:37] medical problem we're dealing with a
[1:20:38] spiritual problem
[1:20:40] isis satan is attacking your elbow and
[1:20:43] we have the power to get rid of that
[1:20:45] so i i anointed him
[1:20:47] i didn't know i just prayed
[1:20:49] i commanded that damon to leave
[1:20:52] and
[1:20:53] having done what i believe god had sent
[1:20:54] me to do i i managed to make it home
[1:20:58] okay
[1:20:59] um from that point on
[1:21:01] healing began in his elbow
[1:21:05] and i'm not patting myself i'm merely
[1:21:06] trying to express something
[1:21:08] god directed me to go
[1:21:12] well if i had determined i wasn't going
[1:21:14] to go
[1:21:16] god does you know god does not have a
[1:21:18] plan b
[1:21:20] he chose moses moses tried to back out
[1:21:22] he said you ain't backing out you're
[1:21:24] going
[1:21:25] okay
[1:21:26] and and uh i think it was jeremiah i
[1:21:29] think it was him anyway he wanted to
[1:21:31] quit
[1:21:32] uh he was going to throw in the sponge
[1:21:34] the god you lied to me you're making me
[1:21:37] and people don't like me anymore and i'm
[1:21:38] getting tired of this so i'm not going
[1:21:40] to speak anymore
[1:21:41] and then he says it was like like like
[1:21:43] fire burning in my bones
[1:21:45] okay he could not quit
[1:21:47] um jonah didn't want to go to didn't
[1:21:49] want to go to nineveh
[1:21:52] god says yes you're going
[1:21:54] so he said i'd rather die than go so he
[1:21:57] got in a boat he had to be swallowed by
[1:21:58] a fish
[1:22:00] and then finally in the belly of the
[1:22:01] fish he realized
[1:22:03] you know it's not really convenient
[1:22:04] being in here it's they're much better
[1:22:06] if i was up and doing something
[1:22:08] different and so the fish finally spit
[1:22:10] them out and god says now will you go
[1:22:12] well yeah okay you've persuaded me i
[1:22:15] guess i will
[1:22:16] okay but i mean here i mean sometimes
[1:22:18] god will throw you in the fish if he has
[1:22:20] to
[1:22:20] but but i mean you have you have to
[1:22:22] realize god has a plan
[1:22:25] and if you are the one that he is
[1:22:27] predestined to fulfill that plan
[1:22:30] that he has no plan b
[1:22:38] brother branham goes on he says it's god
[1:22:39] in you all that god was he poured into
[1:22:41] christ no the christ was he poured into
[1:22:42] the church so it's god above us it's god
[1:22:45] with us now it's god in us god above us
[1:22:47] in the father god in with us the son
[1:22:49] cleansing his way can the condescending
[1:22:51] coming down making a way for me to go
[1:22:53] back and bring his people back to the
[1:22:55] manifestation of the sons of god like
[1:22:57] they had them in the garden he said he
[1:22:59] has no voice tonight but your voice
[1:23:02] he has no hands but your hands
[1:23:05] he has
[1:23:06] he ha he has your hands that those hands
[1:23:10] that those hands it is he says i am the
[1:23:11] vine you're the branches so he's trying
[1:23:13] to say he's trying to tell us
[1:23:15] you
[1:23:16] if god wants to do something he has to
[1:23:19] work through his body
[1:23:21] and if you claim to be part of the body
[1:23:23] of jesus christ then he wants to work
[1:23:25] through you
[1:23:27] he goes on in restoration the right tree
[1:23:29] he says he says that that day you'll
[1:23:31] know that i am in the father the father
[1:23:32] is me i and you and you and me oh i just
[1:23:34] love that and satan gets so angry with
[1:23:36] that he says don't you see the oneness
[1:23:38] of god
[1:23:44] he's taking you and placing you in the
[1:23:46] godhead
[1:23:50] i mean i don't read like there's no
[1:23:51] other way i can read that
[1:23:55] but that makes us part of him
[1:23:58] that makes us a part of his body
[1:24:00] that makes us a manifestation of him
[1:24:03] and if we are to be the manifestation of
[1:24:05] him he says all that god was deported to
[1:24:07] jesus christ he emptied into jesus
[1:24:09] christ in everything in jesus christ he
[1:24:10] has emptied into his church and he says
[1:24:12] that makes us part of the fullness of
[1:24:14] the godhead bodily we are the body of
[1:24:16] god
[1:24:18] well if god dwells in you then let him
[1:24:21] if god dwells in you release him
[1:24:24] if god dwells in you by faith be able to
[1:24:26] claim what god says that you are and
[1:24:28] release the god that is within you so
[1:24:30] that that god that is in you can can
[1:24:32] express themselves to other people
[1:24:39] but this doesn't come
[1:24:42] just by attending church once in a while
[1:24:45] and reading your bible when it's
[1:24:47] convenient
[1:24:50] no it takes a commitment
[1:24:52] [Music]
[1:24:54] we are not in lady osea ladies lukewarm
[1:24:58] now we're in the bright age
[1:25:00] we're in the bright coming of jesus
[1:25:01] christ
[1:25:03] well if we are in the bright age and the
[1:25:04] bright coming of jesus christ where
[1:25:06] jesus christ so dwells in his in his bro
[1:25:08] in his bride until the bride now becomes
[1:25:10] a full manifestation expression of him
[1:25:12] then why aren't why don't we express
[1:25:14] that why don't we live then
[1:25:17] where is our zeal where where is the
[1:25:19] where's the burden we have for others
[1:25:21] where where where's the joy that we're
[1:25:22] supposed to be able to express unto
[1:25:24] others
[1:25:29] he said he said in the book of
[1:25:31] revelation
[1:25:33] he says he knows that the people get a
[1:25:34] true revelation of the true church and
[1:25:36] what she is and what she stands for that
[1:25:38] she can do the greater works she will be
[1:25:41] an invincible army if they get the true
[1:25:43] revelation of the two spirits within the
[1:25:45] framework of the church and
[1:25:47] and and withstand
[1:25:49] the
[1:25:50] if they get a true revelation of the two
[1:25:51] spirits within the framework of the
[1:25:53] christian church and by god's spirit
[1:25:54] discern and withstand the antichrist
[1:25:56] spirit satan is powerless before her
[1:25:59] okay
[1:26:01] so we should be an invincible army
[1:26:04] invincible means undefeatable
[1:26:09] so no matter what satan throws against
[1:26:12] you
[1:26:13] you have god dwelling in you
[1:26:17] and that god that is in you has the
[1:26:19] ability to defeat satan
[1:26:22] but you have to let him
[1:26:25] how do you how do you defeat satan you
[1:26:27] have the faith to believe in the god
[1:26:29] that has called you you have to have the
[1:26:31] faith and the promises that god has
[1:26:32] given to us in his word you have to
[1:26:34] believe in the god that through the
[1:26:36] prophet began to express to to the bride
[1:26:38] who she is and what she is and that the
[1:26:40] power of god now dwells in her
[1:26:45] it's it's
[1:26:48] i mean people take and and what they try
[1:26:51] and do is they try and make it to put
[1:26:52] everything in the prophet
[1:26:55] no the god through the prophet began to
[1:26:57] show me the possibility of what lives in
[1:26:59] me
[1:27:04] i'm not a prophet i don't want to be one
[1:27:06] i don't have discernment i don't want to
[1:27:08] have it
[1:27:09] because there's a whole bunch of
[1:27:11] responsibility goes with some of that
[1:27:12] stuff
[1:27:14] but if i can have a relationship with
[1:27:16] god such that i can walk in the spirit
[1:27:18] and i can allow him to lead me and guide
[1:27:21] me to the places he wants me to go and
[1:27:23] then when i get wherever he wants me to
[1:27:25] go i can minister according to what he
[1:27:27] quickens into my mind and then all of a
[1:27:29] sudden then i am ministering on god's
[1:27:30] behalf not even realizing what i'm doing
[1:27:44] god has redeemed us from the curse of
[1:27:46] the law
[1:27:49] the law has no applications to us
[1:27:54] he said we're in love
[1:27:56] love is above the law
[1:27:59] in love there is
[1:28:01] no law
[1:28:03] because there's something inside of us
[1:28:05] which is controlling our actions
[1:28:08] and that love that is one side of us
[1:28:10] controls the actions that we have
[1:28:13] love jesus christ
[1:28:17] because i love him i do the things he
[1:28:19] asks
[1:28:21] they're not burdensome
[1:28:23] i don't look at them as something that's
[1:28:25] being put upon me that i have to submit
[1:28:27] to
[1:28:30] no my wife when we we when we shop we
[1:28:33] shop together we
[1:28:35] we do everything together okay
[1:28:37] and so she i would like a nice pretty
[1:28:39] dress and i say man that's pretty i said
[1:28:41] she says yeah
[1:28:42] but she says it's not decent
[1:28:45] oh
[1:28:46] and she one she says okay let me try it
[1:28:48] on i'll show you
[1:28:50] so she put it on i says oh yeah no no no
[1:28:53] that ain't gonna work no no no put it
[1:28:55] back put it back
[1:28:56] okay
[1:28:59] so she proved her point
[1:29:00] and after that i i mean we go i we have
[1:29:03] her try on things and if i like it i
[1:29:05] tell her that if i don't like it i tell
[1:29:07] her that
[1:29:08] she dresses to please me
[1:29:11] okay but she also she dresses because of
[1:29:13] the convictions she has
[1:29:16] as far as what she would believe is
[1:29:18] decent
[1:29:19] and moral
[1:29:21] okay
[1:29:23] the same thing with me and god
[1:29:25] he tells me what what he says i don't
[1:29:28] like that
[1:29:30] oh
[1:29:31] okay i lord i won't do that anymore lord
[1:29:33] i'm sorry i did that
[1:29:35] well you shouldn't go here
[1:29:37] but lord there's nothing wrong with me
[1:29:38] going there no don't go there
[1:29:42] and a couple of times i went
[1:29:44] and i wish i had not and after that at
[1:29:46] least i learned don't go there yes sir
[1:29:49] no problems no no no questions anymore
[1:29:51] no problem
[1:29:53] because i know that if i if i disobey
[1:29:55] him then all of a sudden i am out of his
[1:29:57] will
[1:29:58] and then if i'm out of his will then
[1:29:59] there are consequences that go with that
[1:30:05] he said to redeem us back into the
[1:30:07] reconciliation to god that we might walk
[1:30:09] with him as in the beginning
[1:30:14] to be able to walk with god the same way
[1:30:16] adam and eve walked with god
[1:30:18] in the garden
[1:30:20] that is how we are to walk with him
[1:30:23] since we are in jesus christ there is no
[1:30:26] there is nothing between us and god
[1:30:29] if your sins have been confessed and
[1:30:31] they're under the blood there you have
[1:30:33] open fellowship with god you can talk
[1:30:35] with him anytime in each place anywhere
[1:30:37] and he's right there to be able to talk
[1:30:39] with you and to commune with you and to
[1:30:41] lead you and to guide you
[1:30:45] he said if you're standing on god's word
[1:30:47] and with god's word every man every amen
[1:30:49] every jot every tittle when you're
[1:30:51] standing i'm trying to tell you put away
[1:30:54] from that shuck
[1:30:55] he said you are the pure virtuous
[1:30:57] sinless bride of the of the living god
[1:31:00] every man and woman that's born of the
[1:31:01] spirit of god and worst in the blood of
[1:31:03] jesus christ and believes every word of
[1:31:05] god stands as though you never sinned in
[1:31:07] the first place you are perfect the
[1:31:09] blood of jesus christ
[1:31:11] he goes on he says oh that spiritual
[1:31:13] union with christ and his church now
[1:31:16] when the flesh is becoming word and the
[1:31:17] word is becoming flesh manifested and
[1:31:20] vindicated just what the bible said
[1:31:22] would happen in this day it's happening
[1:31:24] day by day he said you're standing
[1:31:26] completely you've never seen it the
[1:31:28] first place god don't even know it's in
[1:31:30] the sea of forgetfulness you never did
[1:31:32] it you were accused of it by the accuser
[1:31:34] but really from the beginning you were
[1:31:36] predestined to be a son and daughter of
[1:31:38] god you're standing there worse and your
[1:31:40] old book of divorcement is put away and
[1:31:42] it's dead absolutely out of existence
[1:31:44] you are and again he goes on you are the
[1:31:46] virtuous rider of jesus christ washing
[1:31:49] the blood of christ the precious
[1:31:50] virtuous sinless son of god is standing
[1:31:52] with a pure unadulterated bride word
[1:31:54] that he worsh by the water of his own
[1:31:56] blood
[1:31:58] and then
[1:31:59] and that flesh then became manifest that
[1:32:01] he might take
[1:32:02] he might take them which were
[1:32:03] predestinated
[1:32:07] we're living at the end
[1:32:10] we're living at the time when time will
[1:32:12] cease to exist
[1:32:14] i'm living in a time in which i am
[1:32:16] looking for the changing of my body
[1:32:19] i'm living in the time when i'm looking
[1:32:21] for my father and my mother to come and
[1:32:23] sit there and have breakfast with me
[1:32:24] some morning
[1:32:25] i'm living in the time when my brother
[1:32:27] should also come by and knock on the
[1:32:28] door and says hey how's my truck doing
[1:32:31] it's the only thing i have from him but
[1:32:33] anyway
[1:32:34] but but i mean it's you know you say
[1:32:36] that's that's funny and silly well
[1:32:38] but i mean
[1:32:39] i i'm looking for them
[1:32:42] i mean i'm earnestly looking for them
[1:32:45] because things are getting worse and
[1:32:46] worse and worse
[1:32:48] i mean i i i hear people in other
[1:32:50] churches and they're talking about have
[1:32:51] faith have faith have faith and and okay
[1:32:54] but to me like i say faith is not
[1:32:56] believing for something believe faith is
[1:32:58] prince is in believing in someone
[1:33:00] because if i believe in that someone
[1:33:02] that no matter what comes i know that
[1:33:04] god that i believe in he can take care
[1:33:06] of it because he already have he already
[1:33:08] has promised me to do that
[1:33:12] so i become like havoc lord i'm putting
[1:33:14] my hand in yours this morning don't let
[1:33:16] go
[1:33:17] wherever you want me to go you just lead
[1:33:19] now and i'll follow
[1:33:21] because if you if i'm in your hand and
[1:33:23] i'm going where you want me to go and
[1:33:24] doing the things you want me to do
[1:33:26] at that point in time you're obligated
[1:33:28] to take care of me
[1:33:30] i mean that's what i gathered from the
[1:33:31] book of habakkuk
[1:33:33] anyway
[1:33:35] but see we're time for it you know what
[1:33:38] people look at the things going on in
[1:33:40] the world and they say it's terrible
[1:33:42] and it is
[1:33:43] there's destruction in every hand we
[1:33:45] have inflation like we haven't had it in
[1:33:47] 40 years we look at what's going on in
[1:33:49] europe i look at what's going on in
[1:33:50] india because i still have ties with
[1:33:53] them i minister to them and i keep
[1:33:54] abreast of what's going on in that
[1:33:56] country
[1:33:57] and i was told by the guy that i work
[1:33:59] with i says we want you to come back but
[1:34:01] he says if you do he says it's going to
[1:34:03] be real real difficult for us to take
[1:34:05] you around
[1:34:07] because of the laws that they now have
[1:34:08] passed
[1:34:10] okay um
[1:34:11] [Music]
[1:34:14] but you know when when i look i
[1:34:16] i watched my wife as she gave birth to
[1:34:19] our children
[1:34:20] oh yeah everything was fine all of a
[1:34:22] sudden she says hey
[1:34:25] um
[1:34:26] it's time give me the hospital
[1:34:28] well i'm going to finish my no no
[1:34:31] it's time
[1:34:32] but no no
[1:34:34] it's time yes yes ma'am yes ma'am yes
[1:34:36] ma'am
[1:34:39] i'm exaggerating but you know
[1:34:41] she knew i was going to do that well she
[1:34:43] didn't
[1:34:45] but when it's time for the birth
[1:34:49] it's a time of great pain
[1:34:54] brother branham talks about what what
[1:34:56] was the first what was that when and and
[1:34:58] in birth pains he says what was the
[1:35:00] first pain he said that was the first
[1:35:02] world war
[1:35:04] what was he said what was the second
[1:35:06] birth pain that was world war ii
[1:35:09] we're approaching the third
[1:35:12] birth pain
[1:35:13] he said that's going to be armageddon
[1:35:16] and the world has to be in the position
[1:35:18] and the condition to be able to for that
[1:35:20] all of a sudden to come into
[1:35:21] manifestation and take place
[1:35:24] so it will not get better
[1:35:26] it's if for the world it's destruction
[1:35:28] yes for the world it's time of a great
[1:35:30] sorrow that is true for the world it's
[1:35:32] going to be a great a great time of the
[1:35:34] sorrow and distress and misery and all
[1:35:36] the other things that go with it this is
[1:35:38] true
[1:35:39] but see for the bride no this is the
[1:35:42] time of our rapture
[1:35:43] this is the time for the changing of our
[1:35:45] body
[1:35:46] this is the time for the manifestation
[1:35:48] of the sons of god
[1:35:50] this is the time when i'm going to come
[1:35:51] into my full expression as the son of
[1:35:53] god the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:35:56] all of a sudden will come into the thing
[1:35:57] in a moment and twinkling of an eye
[1:36:00] my body will be changed after i've seen
[1:36:02] my loved ones come back for 30 or 40
[1:36:04] days
[1:36:06] this is what i keep my eye on
[1:36:10] this this is the focus that i have
[1:36:12] because this world will not improve
[1:36:15] it cannot improve
[1:36:17] and so if i keep my eye on the goal if i
[1:36:20] keep my eye on on what god has set
[1:36:22] before me the glory that paul talked
[1:36:24] about that's going to be revealed in me
[1:36:26] if i keep my eye and my focus on that
[1:36:28] then then all the rest of the stuff it
[1:36:30] doesn't mean anything
[1:36:38] i added this note to
[1:36:40] today
[1:36:41] and
[1:36:43] in matthew 25 it talks about um
[1:36:46] it talks about the the fault the wise
[1:36:49] and the foolish virgins
[1:36:52] and i was looking at this and i began to
[1:36:54] well lord you know what
[1:36:57] you know we were talking about the glory
[1:36:59] that shall be revealed in us and but all
[1:37:01] of a sudden
[1:37:03] it goes on there he says the voice he
[1:37:05] said
[1:37:07] he said
[1:37:08] see a cry came out he said behold the
[1:37:11] bridegroom cometh
[1:37:13] and to me that was the message
[1:37:16] and brother brown and when he began his
[1:37:19] ministry what was he doing he was trying
[1:37:20] to tell us the bridegroom is coming the
[1:37:22] bridegroom is coming make yourself ready
[1:37:25] but it goes on and says well the
[1:37:26] bridegroom terry they all slumped all
[1:37:30] foolish the boys and food as they all
[1:37:32] slumbered and slept
[1:37:36] but then at the midnight hour
[1:37:39] all of a sudden it came hey he's here
[1:37:42] trim your lamps
[1:37:45] the wise had oil
[1:37:48] the foolish did not
[1:37:51] brother branham types this with the
[1:37:53] denominational churches and i'm not
[1:37:56] going to dispute that point
[1:37:59] but to me it says
[1:38:01] the bridegroom came those that were
[1:38:02] ready went into the marriage
[1:38:05] and then the door was shut
[1:38:08] to me this is the time of the rapture
[1:38:11] he is righteous as righteous he's as
[1:38:13] filthy as filthy
[1:38:14] and when the door is shut the door is
[1:38:16] shut there's no no more entry into that
[1:38:19] and so when i when i look at us as the
[1:38:21] bride of jesus christ
[1:38:24] it comes down to the question do you
[1:38:25] have oil
[1:38:31] because sometimes pretty soon it's going
[1:38:33] to be too late
[1:38:35] there will come a time when all of a
[1:38:37] sudden the door will be set when we see
[1:38:39] the dead in christ rise it's over
[1:38:42] when that happens it is over
[1:38:44] and if you don't have it and you're not
[1:38:46] ready you will be left behind i can
[1:38:48] almost guarantee that
[1:38:50] and so now is the time in the
[1:38:52] preparation
[1:38:53] now is the time that the door is still
[1:38:55] open now is the time when the holy
[1:38:57] spirit is still available now is the
[1:38:59] time for you to make your calling in
[1:39:01] your election sure now is the time for
[1:39:03] you to sit there and and so and and so
[1:39:05] dedicate yourself to jesus christ and
[1:39:07] and ask for a refilling or ask for
[1:39:09] whatever it is you need to be able to
[1:39:11] strengthen you for what is coming
[1:39:14] because what is coming is not going to
[1:39:16] be easy
[1:39:19] habakkuk had to come to the realization
[1:39:21] if he was destitute if he had nothing
[1:39:24] yet he would still worship god with as
[1:39:25] if he had if he possessed everything and
[1:39:28] i told those in india he says it's going
[1:39:30] to come a time you when you probably
[1:39:32] will not have anything
[1:39:33] and but you will still work will you
[1:39:35] still worship god will you still devote
[1:39:37] yourself to god will you still get
[1:39:38] together in church will you still offer
[1:39:40] up praises and adoration to god as if
[1:39:42] you possess everything
[1:39:44] because this is to me and this is my
[1:39:46] opinion if you don't like it that's fine
[1:39:48] but to me this is my opinion this is
[1:39:50] where we're going
[1:39:53] this is what's coming
[1:39:55] there's there's there's a glory that's
[1:39:56] to be revealed in us and that that's
[1:39:58] what i look forward to that is that is
[1:40:00] my focus that is the end of the road
[1:40:02] that is that is the end of my race that
[1:40:04] i'm that i'm that i'm running
[1:40:06] but i also realize that regardless of
[1:40:08] what comes tomorrow i will still worship
[1:40:10] my god as if i possess all things
[1:40:18] when i was in
[1:40:20] we were in
[1:40:21] in switzerland
[1:40:23] my wife and i had been in india for
[1:40:25] probably about two and a half months
[1:40:27] um it was a very difficult trip for us
[1:40:30] my wife became very very sick
[1:40:34] i wasn't doing much better
[1:40:37] and so switzerland they had easter
[1:40:39] meetings and we had a plan to go and so
[1:40:41] we arrived there
[1:40:43] when we got there shirley had to go to
[1:40:44] bed because she didn't have enough
[1:40:45] strength to get up to to get up to
[1:40:48] to eat or do anything
[1:40:50] when the meat when their easter meeting
[1:40:52] starts i says well can you go to the
[1:40:54] meetings i says well yeah she'll try
[1:40:56] and so we got her in the car we got her
[1:40:58] there got her into bed
[1:41:00] and i went down to the brothers and i
[1:41:02] said my my wife needs prayer i mean
[1:41:04] she's not doing good at all and i was
[1:41:06] afraid that she was going to lose her
[1:41:09] okay and that's that was my mentality at
[1:41:11] that point
[1:41:13] and so i went down before they had the
[1:41:14] meetings and i poured my heart out to
[1:41:16] god
[1:41:17] because god you don't take her
[1:41:20] i rely on her too much
[1:41:22] she's a part of me
[1:41:25] and god
[1:41:26] heard my prayer and she began to mend
[1:41:30] and anyway there was a service and at
[1:41:31] the end of the service and i was still
[1:41:33] tore up in myself
[1:41:35] and so i was going to go up and and i
[1:41:37] think shirley was down there at the
[1:41:38] meeting at the time
[1:41:40] and anyway as they were people were
[1:41:42] exiting the the auditorium all of a
[1:41:44] sudden one lady she had a seizure or
[1:41:46] something i forget what
[1:41:48] and there was probably about 15 20
[1:41:50] people between me and
[1:41:51] and the sister
[1:41:53] well there was right now eight or ten
[1:41:54] ministers around here praying for her
[1:41:56] and
[1:41:57] i figured well as a minister i probably
[1:41:58] should go and you know add mine to
[1:42:00] theirs and but then i looked at the
[1:42:02] situation i asked myself what can i do
[1:42:06] can i heal her
[1:42:08] the answer is no
[1:42:10] can i encourage her
[1:42:12] well yeah
[1:42:15] but the realization came that had to
[1:42:17] come from inside of her
[1:42:21] she had to have the willingness she had
[1:42:23] to have the the ability the desire to
[1:42:26] fight
[1:42:29] until she had the desire to fight satan
[1:42:31] would continue to do what she was doing
[1:42:34] what he was doing to her
[1:42:36] and i could not give her that
[1:42:39] i could not give her i could not place
[1:42:41] within her
[1:42:42] the desire to fight
[1:42:46] and i look at what's coming to the world
[1:42:48] now
[1:42:50] i'm asking you the same thing
[1:42:53] do you have the willingness do you have
[1:42:55] within you the desire to fight
[1:42:59] do you have enough of the unction of the
[1:43:00] holy spirit in you
[1:43:02] that when satan comes and attacks you
[1:43:04] you are willing to stand toe to toe with
[1:43:06] him and punch him in the face and
[1:43:08] fight it you're not going to get there
[1:43:11] by laying it back you're not going to
[1:43:13] get there by sitting back and wait
[1:43:14] letting somebody else do it
[1:43:16] no this has to come from inside of the
[1:43:18] individual
[1:43:20] i was in vietnam and one guy got a what
[1:43:22] do we call a sucking chest when a bullet
[1:43:24] went through his lung cavity well we had
[1:43:27] hundreds of those almost all of them
[1:43:29] lived
[1:43:30] but this one guy was so despondent and
[1:43:32] so discouraged he did not want to live
[1:43:35] and he died
[1:43:37] and another guy he got hit with
[1:43:38] something and he got burned over 50
[1:43:40] percent of his body
[1:43:42] massive burns then he got an infection
[1:43:45] and that infection should have killed
[1:43:47] him
[1:43:48] but he wanted to live
[1:43:50] there was within him the the the the
[1:43:53] desire the the fight if you will just
[1:43:55] know i am going home and i am going to
[1:43:57] be with my family and i'm going to see
[1:43:59] my kids and i'm going to live a regular
[1:44:01] life and i'm going to do this and i'm
[1:44:02] going to do this and i'm going to and i
[1:44:04] am not going to die here
[1:44:07] he lived
[1:44:09] because there was within him the desire
[1:44:11] to fight
[1:44:13] there was within him something that says
[1:44:15] no i am not going to give up i am going
[1:44:17] to press the battle until i can be i can
[1:44:19] become and i can do and i can go where i
[1:44:21] want to go
[1:44:23] but see that has to now come inside of
[1:44:25] every single one of us
[1:44:28] we are at the end time
[1:44:30] we can look at what's coming we can look
[1:44:32] at the glory that's to be revealed in us
[1:44:34] and we can rejoice in those things and
[1:44:35] we can keep our focus on that and let
[1:44:37] the world go by and let the world do
[1:44:39] what the world is doing but when it
[1:44:41] comes down to
[1:44:42] to satan when coming down to doing
[1:44:44] battle with him you have to be willing
[1:44:46] to fight you have to have the gumption
[1:44:49] or whatever it is and you're within your
[1:44:51] own selves and no i am not going to
[1:44:52] submit to this
[1:44:54] i'm not going to lay down and die no
[1:44:56] satan i'm going to sit there i'm going
[1:44:57] to carry it through until i can i can
[1:44:59] see you physically and i can punch your
[1:45:01] lights out
[1:45:02] there has to come within ourselves that
[1:45:05] strong of a desire that we no matter
[1:45:07] what comes our way we will fight into
[1:45:09] until we will succeed until we will
[1:45:11] approach until we will get to the end
[1:45:13] i am looking for the changing of my body
[1:45:15] i believe that could be at any time
[1:45:19] that is what motivates me that that's
[1:45:21] where i keep my focus but see now it has
[1:45:24] to come to within every single one of
[1:45:26] you
[1:45:27] and i can't judge you and i there's
[1:45:29] nothing i cannot impart within you the
[1:45:31] desire to fight
[1:45:33] i cannot i can impart unto you knowledge
[1:45:37] i can impart unto you i can impart unto
[1:45:39] you encouragement
[1:45:41] but until you have within yourself the
[1:45:43] desire to fight
[1:45:46] when you look at the people that go
[1:45:48] running the races
[1:45:49] are the guys running the race and well
[1:45:51] yeah i'll get there eventually yeah yeah
[1:45:53] it's no big thing you know if i come in
[1:45:55] the 104th out you know 124 people oh
[1:45:58] that's all right it doesn't matter no if
[1:46:00] but the ones that are winning
[1:46:03] are the ones that have it within
[1:46:04] themselves this is no i'm going to be
[1:46:07] number one
[1:46:08] i am going to finish the race and i'm
[1:46:10] not going to finish in last place no i'm
[1:46:12] going to finish up front
[1:46:14] and so they will apply themselves and
[1:46:15] they will strain within themselves and
[1:46:17] they will they will put all of their
[1:46:19] energies into into winning a race which
[1:46:21] they have been set before them and paul
[1:46:24] in philippians he says not as though i
[1:46:25] had all retained either were already
[1:46:27] perfect but i follow after that i might
[1:46:29] apprehend that for which also i am
[1:46:31] apprehended of christ jesus brethren i
[1:46:33] count on myself to apprehend it but this
[1:46:35] one thing i do i forget all those things
[1:46:37] which are behind and i reach forth unto
[1:46:39] those things which are before and i
[1:46:40] press towards the mark for the prize of
[1:46:42] the high calling of god in dry jesus
[1:46:44] press means to apply all of your
[1:46:46] energies
[1:46:47] you have a focus on one thing and that's
[1:46:49] the end of the end of the race that
[1:46:51] you're going to finish that you're going
[1:46:52] to complete paul had to have this all of
[1:46:55] his life even when he was shipwrecked
[1:46:57] and beaten and stoned and all the other
[1:46:58] things he says no none of this bothers
[1:47:00] me
[1:47:01] he says because i have a race that i've
[1:47:03] been placed before me and i'm going to
[1:47:04] run that race regardless of the
[1:47:06] obstacles i am going to run that race
[1:47:08] and i'm going to complete the i'm going
[1:47:09] to apprehend that which god has
[1:47:11] apprehended me for
[1:47:13] but see now this has to come in every
[1:47:15] one of our lives
[1:47:21] you have to have that desire
[1:47:25] and without the desire where will you be
[1:47:27] next week
[1:47:29] next month
[1:47:31] where will you be when the rapture takes
[1:47:34] place
[1:47:34] i'm not trying to i'm i'm not trying to
[1:47:37] discourage but i'm trying to i'm trying
[1:47:39] to get a reality a wake-up call
[1:47:44] you are not going to win by sitting back
[1:47:46] and doing nothing
[1:47:48] the only way that you're going to win is
[1:47:49] you're going to have to apply yourself
[1:47:51] in the scriptures and in prayer and all
[1:47:52] of the other things you're going to have
[1:47:54] to apply yourself that you that you are
[1:47:56] determined that you're going to run the
[1:47:58] race that god has set before you and you
[1:48:00] are going to finish that race because
[1:48:01] god has ordained for you to do that
[1:48:09] like i say you're the only one that can
[1:48:11] answer
[1:48:13] you're the only one that can answer
[1:48:14] what's inside of you yes my
[1:48:17] sure have we been i've been discouraged
[1:48:19] sure
[1:48:22] have i had my my days when i'm down and
[1:48:24] out
[1:48:25] yeah
[1:48:27] and then god taps me in the shoulder
[1:48:29] enough for pity party get up we got work
[1:48:31] to do
[1:48:33] okay you know so you get up and you
[1:48:35] start and you start living again you
[1:48:37] start applying yourself you start doing
[1:48:39] the things that you know you should be
[1:48:40] doing you get back into reading your
[1:48:42] bible you get back into listening to the
[1:48:43] tips of the messages you get back into
[1:48:45] just doing the thing which god has
[1:48:47] ordained for me to do from the beginning
[1:48:50] but as i look at the world going on
[1:48:51] around i realize i cannot have an off
[1:48:54] day anymore
[1:48:56] because if i have another off day what
[1:48:58] happens if he comes on that off day
[1:49:01] no it's time to press the battle
[1:49:03] it's time to finish the race
[1:49:05] it's time to look at the end of the goal
[1:49:07] that jesus that god has set before us
[1:49:09] and run with patience the race that has
[1:49:11] been laid before us
[1:49:13] god bless you
[1:49:21] amen
[1:49:27] wonderful message
[1:49:29] amen
[1:49:30] how many feel like encouraged tonight
[1:49:35] i'm man i'm man i'm man
[1:49:39] it's unbelievable we still have to deal
[1:49:41] with justification and he's getting into
[1:49:45] sanctification back and forth back and
[1:49:47] forth so i need to to talk to the gps
[1:49:51] and find out because he keeps insisting
[1:49:54] on sanctification a lot if you are
[1:49:56] spiritual you can catch a roof serving
[1:50:00] it's right there amen
[1:50:03] we don't have any more time
[1:50:07] decision is
[1:50:08] powerful and decision can turn the
[1:50:11] things and the event in life
[1:50:14] you know it bothers me
[1:50:16] when a young man
[1:50:19] graduated and don't know what he's going
[1:50:21] to do
[1:50:22] wow
[1:50:24] it's a sickness in the message
[1:50:27] all over the message it's a sickness
[1:50:30] among the young people
[1:50:33] do you want me to continue
[1:50:35] you want me to continue
[1:50:37] you graduated in 2010
[1:50:40] where are you today

[1:50:55] nothing
[1:50:57] amen
[1:50:58] it borders me
[1:51:00] and i told somebody i say until
[1:51:05] you take a decision yourself
[1:51:08] from your heart
[1:51:10] that desire
[1:51:12] have to come from your heart
[1:51:14] because god will look at your heart
[1:51:17] and you will come to the altar 20 times
[1:51:20] and it's not going to change you the
[1:51:21] reason why you're not changing because
[1:51:23] the desire is not there you're not ready
[1:51:26] for the change yet you're not ready for
[1:51:28] what god wants to do in your life yet
[1:51:31] you still think you have time you don't
[1:51:33] want to let things go
[1:51:35] that's the reason why you have a problem
[1:51:37] amen
[1:51:38] but if you can take a genuine decision i
[1:51:42] cannot teach you on that you have to
[1:51:44] come from yourself
[1:51:46] that you say enough is enough
[1:51:49] i am done
[1:51:50] i am not going to go any more with this
[1:51:53] if it comes from your heart
[1:51:56] if you really mean it
[1:51:58] god will come down
[1:52:01] do you hear me
[1:52:04] brother branham went to a mental
[1:52:05] institution
[1:52:07] and he met a woman she looks normal
[1:52:10] but she had a mental issue and many
[1:52:13] people look normal today but they have a
[1:52:15] real big problem
[1:52:16] amen brother branham told the woman go
[1:52:19] ahead and pray
[1:52:20] she knelt down and stopped praying she
[1:52:23] prayed she prayed lord jesus this this
[1:52:25] this and walk up and say i finished
[1:52:26] brother branham say
[1:52:28] that didn't work
[1:52:29] you go back again and stop praying amen
[1:52:32] she stopped praying she stopped praying
[1:52:34] and brother branham said suddenly
[1:52:36] she hit something
[1:52:38] and when she woke up brother brandon
[1:52:40] never spoke about i don't know i might
[1:52:42] have not seen the quote yet about him
[1:52:44] praying for that woman that woman just
[1:52:46] rose again and by the brandon look at
[1:52:48] her he said that was it
[1:52:50] amen
[1:52:52] amen brother branham was just standing
[1:52:54] there witnessing that woman getting her
[1:52:58] own deliverance
[1:53:01] amen
[1:53:02] if you don't have that desire in your
[1:53:06] heart
[1:53:06] you will keep spinning and spinning and
[1:53:09] spinning and spinning and spinning and
[1:53:12] the years don't
[1:53:14] wait for you before you know it you're
[1:53:16] 25 you're 30 years old you're 35 years
[1:53:20] old and when you look you didn't go
[1:53:21] nowhere
[1:53:24] and the people that start with you
[1:53:25] you're going to see them married they
[1:53:27] have kids the children are grown up they
[1:53:29] have 10 years old children you are still
[1:53:31] hanging there
[1:53:33] because you don't want to take a
[1:53:34] decision
[1:53:36] you don't want to go to that altar
[1:53:38] and you don't want to die if you get in
[1:53:41] that brazen altar and you really mean it
[1:53:45] from your heart
[1:53:46] amen you really desire it from your
[1:53:49] heart not from the head many decision
[1:53:52] comes from the head i'm not talking
[1:53:53] about the head but from your heart
[1:53:56] brother branham preach the time of
[1:53:57] decision if you take a decision from
[1:54:00] your heart you say lord i cannot help
[1:54:03] myself but there is one thing there is a
[1:54:05] desire in me
[1:54:07] i don't want to go anymore without this
[1:54:11] amen if you stay in your prayer closet
[1:54:16] if you don't meet god
[1:54:18] then something is wrong somewhere amen
[1:54:21] that god will always meet you if you
[1:54:24] really mean it amen
[1:54:27] amen there is no more time
[1:54:30] you heard the brother talking about
[1:54:32] even in the message where is the oil
[1:54:36] where is the old
[1:54:38] amen
[1:54:39] i found out in the message people that
[1:54:42] are very serious with god
[1:54:45] it doesn't take much
[1:54:47] for you to see them you will even think
[1:54:49] they're more older than you
[1:54:52] because of the way they're serious with
[1:54:54] god
[1:54:55] they you are 20 years old they are 20
[1:54:58] years old but when you talk to them you
[1:55:00] will think they are 35 and you're 20.
[1:55:03] it's because of how serious
[1:55:06] they are with god god will transform
[1:55:08] that person will bring that person to a
[1:55:11] higher responsibility until you would
[1:55:13] look at them and you look like how old
[1:55:15] are you are you 40 no they're not 40
[1:55:18] it is the message in them doing that
[1:55:21] amen and to be that you got to be
[1:55:24] serious with this message and you got to
[1:55:26] take a genuine decision from your heart
[1:55:30] to stop playing games stop playing games
[1:55:33] in church
[1:55:34] stop following preachers stop playing
[1:55:37] game from one church to another or with
[1:55:39] your friend in school or in college or
[1:55:41] whatever forget about all of that take a
[1:55:44] full decision you will regret i told
[1:55:47] somebody i say if you really mean it
[1:55:49] from your heart you will look back and
[1:55:51] regret all the years you spend
[1:55:56] you can give somebody four years they do
[1:55:58] nothing
[1:55:59] you can give somebody else four years
[1:56:00] they come up with a bachelor degree
[1:56:05] one did something one was just playing
[1:56:08] around
[1:56:09] you ask them what they're doing they're
[1:56:10] in this major tomorrow the job they're
[1:56:12] in this major measure tomorrow the job
[1:56:14] in this major tomorrow the job they
[1:56:15] start working and then they stop working
[1:56:17] then they go back they're just spinning
[1:56:18] and you look five years seven years ten
[1:56:21] years is gone without going nowhere
[1:56:25] if you were serious with god that 10
[1:56:28] years you could have seen what god would
[1:56:30] have accomplished in your life you will
[1:56:32] be probably preaching the gospel winning
[1:56:34] souls left and right and doing things
[1:56:37] for the kingdom or you will be a mother
[1:56:39] in the home raising kids and showing
[1:56:42] other mothers an example
[1:56:44] what to be in a marriage life so
[1:56:47] in my sound hard
[1:56:49] i'll have to rock again with that
[1:56:52] justification
[1:56:54] we got to make sure
[1:56:56] we are ready for the rapture amen
[1:56:59] if you don't know what the brother is
[1:57:02] talking tonight that manifestation if
[1:57:04] you have not make your life serious with
[1:57:07] god it's not going to happen amen
[1:57:10] we love you but love is corrective i
[1:57:13] cannot back up until i see you all
[1:57:17] make it to the other side amen when you
[1:57:20] are prospering when you happy when your
[1:57:23] spiritual life is where you're supposed
[1:57:24] to be with god i am happy because we did

[1:57:38] god has been waiting all this time
[1:57:41] to help you he has been there he has
[1:57:43] been waiting you've been on his way
[1:57:45] you've been doing things the way you
[1:57:46] wanted you've been blocking him blocking
[1:57:49] him blocking him brother branham even
[1:57:50] said that the holy ghost
[1:57:52] was even blocked
[1:57:54] tied by the creeds and things like that
[1:57:57] so a lot of stuff can block the holy
[1:57:59] ghost until the holy ghost cannot
[1:58:01] operate the way he's supposed to be amen
[1:58:04] but god is bringing you freedom what the
[1:58:07] brother is preaching this is the mark of
[1:58:09] our high calling this is what god is
[1:58:11] calling us for god is not calling us to
[1:58:13] be at the altar today at the altar
[1:58:15] tomorrow at the altar today at the altar
[1:58:17] tomorrow that's not you go to the altar
[1:58:19] one time you die one time and you keep
[1:58:22] moving and everything else is bloated up
[1:58:25] all the ordinance all the past saying
[1:58:27] brother branham say they are completely
[1:58:29] removed from you you don't look at that
[1:58:32] and you move forward going on to the
[1:58:34] holy of holies where you have the
[1:58:36] communion

[1:58:43] somebody
[1:58:44] and who want to wait before they get
[1:58:46] married
[1:58:48] i heard even people saying may jesus
[1:58:50] wait until i get married before he comes
[1:58:53] back
[1:58:54] because they love one another so much
[1:58:57] but how can you be married to jesus
[1:58:59] christ and the signs of the coming of
[1:59:01] the lord are coming and you now afraid

[1:59:08] 10 houses i still have to do this before
[1:59:10] you come
[1:59:12] you're not in love with christ
[1:59:14] if you are really in love with christ
[1:59:16] you can't wait to be united with your
[1:59:18] husband that is the sign of a true love

[1:59:22] when rebecca when elias spoke to rebecca
[1:59:25] rebecca never even have

[1:59:31] didn't have a facebook where she can see

[1:59:38] messenger but that message was so
[1:59:41] powerful until the home of rebecca
[1:59:44] became uncomfortable when they told her
[1:59:47] just stay for 10 days she could not even
[1:59:50] stay 10 days
[1:59:52] if they tell you
[1:59:53] i mean stay home 10 days with your

[2:00:30] relationship because you have a body or
[2:00:33] a friend or something in this world that
[2:00:36] is tying you up that's why god is

[2:02:26] don't get used to get to church and come
[2:02:28] out and just go

[2:02:34] ponder where you are
[2:02:36] examine yourself check your own life
[2:02:39] and see where you are
[2:02:41] if you know where you're supposed to be
[2:02:43] just keep moving
[2:02:45] until you get where you're supposed to
[2:02:47] be at least you know that if the lord
[2:02:50] comes today i'm in peace with god
[2:02:53] like paul said when we are justified we
[2:02:55] had peace with him
[2:02:56] that's where we want you to be let's
[2:02:58] pray heavenly father
[2:03:00] lord we thank you again
[2:03:02] for your grace for your love and for
[2:03:04] your mercy
[2:03:06] father thank you for using our brother
[2:03:08] tonight in a powerful way
[2:03:10] to speak to your children
[2:03:12] and to encourage encourage your children
[2:03:16] and father to stir and to work
[2:03:19] those that were sleeping and slumbering
[2:03:21] because the time
[2:03:23] is very very close
[2:03:25] father many times we heard
[2:03:28] sermon preach after sermon
[2:03:30] that the lord is coming

[2:03:42] gonna last again in this world longer
[2:03:45] father we don't want anybody to be left
[2:03:48] behind
[2:03:49] like the brother stated once the dead in
[2:03:52] christ are raised up once that blood is
[2:03:54] no more on the mercy seat
[2:03:56] the door will be completely closed and
[2:03:59] father whoever will be left
[2:04:01] will be doomed for the tribulation
[2:04:04] lord jesus christ we pray
[2:04:06] that you stir the heart of the people
[2:04:09] may you remove that stone
[2:04:11] that is blocking that unbelief
[2:04:13] completely lord
[2:04:15] that the word of god can penetrate where
[2:04:18] he can
[2:04:19] father reach to the deeper to the soul
[2:04:22] of your children and wake them up lord
[2:04:25] until you can bring them to that place
[2:04:27] where they can make peace with you lord
[2:04:30] father may you strengthen your
[2:04:32] manservant that you use tonight lord and
[2:04:34] father may you help this church

[2:04:39] people left and right in their work in
[2:04:42] their bodies in their mentality lord all
[2:04:45] kind of stuff lord lord some wasting
[2:04:48] time don't even know which direction to
[2:04:50] take but lord father you say the sickest
[2:04:53] body that you know of was the body of
