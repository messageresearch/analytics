[41:45] a job
[41:47] and they asked him to sign his name to

[42:59] in this tabernacle right here
[43:02] which is waiting for redemption we are
[43:05] still subject
[43:06] to make mistake so if you got a pencil
[43:10] in this church

[43:14] got an eraser
[43:16] when you make a mistake don't be shy

[44:34] and went toward aaron
[44:39] amen this sees jacob leaving his father
[44:43] home
[44:45] going to his uncle lebanon
[44:48] and he lighted upon a certain place
[44:51] and tarried there all night because
[44:54] the sun was set and he took off the
[44:58] stones of that place
[45:00] and put them for the for his pillows and
[45:03] lay down
[45:04] in that place to sleep you might be
[45:07] seated
[45:08] and he dreamed in that place where he
[45:12] put up
[45:12] the stone for pillows and he dreamed
[45:16] and behold a ladder set up
[45:19] on the earth amen
[45:22] and the top of it reached to heaven and
[45:26] behold the
[45:27] angels not only one angel
[45:30] but it's several angels not only one
[45:34] and the angels of god are sending
[45:38] thank you and descending

[46:28] and to the east and to the north and to
[46:31] the south everything he gave to abraham
[46:33] and in you and in your seed shall all

[47:31] ascending
[47:32] and descending amen and god told him
[47:35] that you're going toward the journey
[47:38] and you're going to come back but when
[47:40] you come back you're going to come back
[47:41] to this place

[47:47] with a place where the angels of god
[47:50] were ascending and
[47:52] descending everybody clear so far

[1:06:49] amen last sunday if you can go with me
[1:06:52] on genesis chapter 2
[1:06:56] let's go to genesis chapter 2 just give
[1:06:58] me some grace i gotta travel
[1:07:01] some avenue
[1:07:04] we found out last week that
[1:07:08] god when he created man
[1:07:11] he created man in his own image
[1:07:14] everybody knows what he means now and in
[1:07:17] his own
[1:07:18] likeness and the man that was created
[1:07:21] there
[1:07:22] was a spirit man because the bible says
[1:07:25] in the book of john that god is a spirit
[1:07:29] and those that worship him must worship
[1:07:32] him in spirit
[1:07:33] and in truth so when god birthed
[1:07:37] this man this man came as a male
[1:07:41] and as a female and this man
[1:07:44] was in the image of god himself
[1:07:48] the image of god is not men and men
[1:07:53] the image of god is not woman and woman
[1:07:58] the image of god is man and
[1:08:01] a woman god is not
[1:08:04] a gay god
[1:08:07] is not a lesbian a man
[1:08:12] it is a man and a female together
[1:08:16] amen that is the original
[1:08:19] and everything against the original is a
[1:08:22] perversion
[1:08:24] amen now in genesis
[1:08:27] in when he created man in genesis
[1:08:30] chapter 1 verse 26
[1:08:33] this man here was a spirit man
[1:08:36] amen when we speak about the spirit
[1:08:40] i explained to you in living word
[1:08:42] tabernacle
[1:08:43] that a spirit is not a soul
[1:08:47] anybody remember there are different
[1:08:51] kind of a spirit
[1:08:53] there is animal spirit there is
[1:08:56] fish spirit there is a
[1:09:00] bird spirit and we also have
[1:09:03] human when we're talking about
[1:09:07] human spirit it is a spirit that
[1:09:10] everybody in this building here has
[1:09:15] a human spirit make you to act
[1:09:19] and to react and to live like a human
[1:09:24] a bird spirit make you act react
[1:09:28] and to fly like a bird a fish spirit
[1:09:32] will make you
[1:09:33] live the life of a fish amen
[1:09:36] but the soul is the nature
[1:09:40] of the spirit everybody clear
[1:09:43] in other words the difference between me
[1:09:46] and my brother
[1:09:47] we are not different by spirit we are
[1:09:51] different
[1:09:51] by soul the soul is your
[1:09:55] personal identification the
[1:09:58] soul is what we are different from one
[1:10:01] another
[1:10:02] but by spirit we all take a shower
[1:10:05] by spirit we all drink by spirit we all
[1:10:09] eat by spirit we talk but by
[1:10:12] soul you might like the color blue and i
[1:10:15] don't like the color blue
[1:10:17] you might like the color white and i
[1:10:19] don't like the color white
[1:10:21] somebody might like his car to be black
[1:10:24] somebody might want his car to be pink
[1:10:27] that is the preference not on the spirit
[1:10:30] but on the soul
[1:10:32] of the individual amen so when god
[1:10:35] created man god created the spirit
[1:10:39] and god spirit has already souls
[1:10:43] and there was a soul for adam and there
[1:10:46] was
[1:10:46] also a soul for evil the soul of
[1:10:50] adam was a masculine soul
[1:10:54] and the soul of eve was a feminine
[1:10:58] soul everybody clear now in genesis 2
[1:11:03] let's go to genesis chapter 2.
[1:11:08] verse 5 if you dare you can say amen
[1:11:12] and every plant of the field
[1:11:16] before it was in the earth and every
[1:11:18] herb of the field
[1:11:20] before it grew for the lord god has not
[1:11:23] caused it to rain
[1:11:25] upon the earth the rain happened with
[1:11:27] noah
[1:11:31] amen so if you wondered there was no
[1:11:33] rain brother branham said there was no
[1:11:35] rain there was no rain until noah
[1:11:37] your scripture is due there amen
[1:11:40] for the lord because for the lord god
[1:11:43] had not caused it to reign
[1:11:45] upon the earth and there was no man to
[1:11:48] do what
[1:11:50] the man already existed in the form of a
[1:11:53] spirit
[1:11:55] amen but the spirit cannot till the
[1:11:58] ground
[1:11:59] the spirit cannot do your physical work
[1:12:03] amen there was somebody was already
[1:12:05] there
[1:12:06] but he lacked the body to put him in
[1:12:09] contact with the earth
[1:12:12] everybody cleared so far praise the name
[1:12:15] of the lord verse 7
[1:12:18] and the lord god form what
[1:12:21] out of the dust of water so in genesis
[1:12:25] chapter 2 verse 7 god
[1:12:28] in this particular part now he's forming
[1:12:32] the body of adam or the physical body
[1:12:37] of adam adam already existed here
[1:12:40] as a spirit adam had a nature
[1:12:43] amen but what god did in genesis 2
[1:12:48] he took that spirit that was already
[1:12:50] living
[1:12:52] are you following me adam was already
[1:12:55] alive
[1:12:57] amen he just took adam
[1:13:01] and put him into the body you have
[1:13:05] let me do this so he can we can make
[1:13:08] sense
[1:13:09] this is the body of adam we have a
[1:13:12] spirit
[1:13:13] god created the body and he took the
[1:13:16] spirit of adam
[1:13:18] the male part and put that inside the
[1:13:21] body of adam
[1:13:23] everybody clear so adam here was
[1:13:27] a human being are you following me
[1:13:30] with a body with a soul
[1:13:34] and with our spirit
[1:13:37] amen
[1:13:40] let's go to genesis chapter 2 verse 7
[1:13:44] and god formed men of the dust of the
[1:13:48] ground
[1:13:49] and god did what and he
[1:13:52] who is breathing
[1:13:56] are you okay god breathed
[1:14:00] into his nostril the breath of what
[1:14:05] i thought adam was already alive
[1:14:11] i'm going slowly because you need to get
[1:14:14] this
[1:14:16] adam was already created
[1:14:19] adam was already alive
[1:14:22] amen god took the spirit of
[1:14:25] adam and put that spirit in the body
[1:14:29] but god breathed the breath of
[1:14:32] life what kind of life does god
[1:14:44] and god breathed in his nostril the word
[1:14:49] the breath of life and man became
[1:14:52] a walker man already had a soul
[1:14:58] are you following me but that soul was
[1:15:02] subject to death
[1:15:04] are you following me then god breathes
[1:15:08] the breath of life the life that came
[1:15:12] from god
[1:15:12] enter into adam are you there
[1:15:17] then adam became a living
[1:15:20] soul a soul that has eternal life
[1:15:31] when we say spirit here it's life
[1:15:35] the body without the spirit james says
[1:15:37] is what
[1:15:42] in the book of luke chapter 24 verse 36
[1:15:46] the bible says and as they does speak
[1:15:49] jesus himself stood in the midst of them
[1:15:52] this is after his resurrection
[1:15:54] and say unto them peace be unto you
[1:15:58] but they were water and water
[1:16:02] and suppose that they have seen
[1:16:05] everybody care they thought that it was
[1:16:08] a spirit
[1:16:10] in other words a ghost everybody clear
[1:16:14] and he said unto them why are you
[1:16:17] trouble and why do you why do thoughts
[1:16:20] arise in your heart
[1:16:22] behold my what and my what
[1:16:25] daddy daddy it is i
[1:16:28] myself handle me and see forever
[1:16:33] this is from your bible i'm giving you
[1:16:35] the definition or characteristic
[1:16:37] of the spirit for air spirit has not
[1:16:40] what
[1:16:42] and what as you see me
[1:16:45] and if and because they continue to
[1:16:48] doubt
[1:16:48] jesus told them give me a fish
[1:16:52] and he took the fish and head to show
[1:16:55] them that
[1:16:56] this is not a spirit but this is a body
[1:17:00] amen this is a spirit in a body
[1:17:03] a spirit in the body can eat
[1:17:07] everybody clear god cannot eat
[1:17:11] that's why in genesis 18 god fabricated
[1:17:14] a body
[1:17:16] amen and god could eat pork chops
[1:17:24] he was not a vegetarian
[1:17:32] amen if you want to eat your salad
[1:17:36] that's fine no problem
[1:17:40] don't say my person say don't eat salad
[1:17:43] everybody clear praise the name of the
[1:17:46] lord in blasphemy's
[1:17:48] name brother branham saying but what god
[1:17:51] did he breathed the water

[1:18:07] plum to your elbows breathe the breath
[1:18:11] of water

[1:18:17] because adam already existed they gave
[1:18:20] him
[1:18:21] eternal life i don't want you to get
[1:18:24] confused because
[1:18:25] at this point we have no dispensation
[1:18:30] this is not the law this is not grace
[1:18:35] nothing has happened sin is not
[1:18:38] introduced to the word yet this is
[1:18:41] at the beginning before the fall
[1:18:44] when the fall happened that's when

[1:20:06] for in the dead that you eat thereof you
[1:20:08] shall water

[1:20:14] every tree here including
[1:20:18] the tree of life but if you notice adam
[1:20:22] never touch the tree of life
[1:20:27] are you there because adam already have

[1:21:30] top
[1:21:30] adam fell then the lamb was provided for
[1:21:34] adam

[1:21:38] he had become the breath of
[1:21:41] and he became a living he was
[1:21:45] a son of who luke chapter 3 verse 38
[1:21:49] if you check the bible say adam the son

[1:22:09] eternal
[1:22:10] life god gave him that's what gave him
[1:22:13] power
[1:22:16] how was adam moving the stuff
[1:22:20] where did he get that power amen
[1:22:23] that's why they said jesus is the second
[1:22:26] and last adam
[1:22:31] amen he had power like god he was an
[1:22:34] amateur god
[1:22:36] he was god of the earth not god of
[1:22:38] heaven
[1:22:40] god of the earth someday the sons of god
[1:22:44] will again become what
[1:22:46] jesus said so is he not written in your
[1:22:50] law he or what
[1:22:52] now we are getting into something deeper
[1:22:55] now watch this when we drive it down he
[1:22:58] is now a son of god
[1:23:00] but he makes a mistake he knows he's
[1:23:03] doing wrong
[1:23:04] now remember adam was not deceived
[1:23:09] everybody clear it's in the scripture
[1:23:11] adam was not deceived
[1:23:13] but the woman was deceived was in the
[1:23:17] transgression
[1:23:18] adam walked with eve because he was his
[1:23:22] wife in other words adam will
[1:23:25] fully sin to save eve
[1:23:32] same as christ

[1:26:24] that in all things he might have thee
[1:26:28] drop now to verse 24
[1:26:32] who now rejoice in my sufferings
[1:26:35] for you and fill up that which is behind
[1:26:39] of the affliction of christ in my flesh
[1:26:42] for he is
[1:26:44] which is the ever clear
[1:26:47] so the body of the lord jesus christ is
[1:26:51] there
[1:26:52] everybody clear that's why like we heard
[1:26:55] the lord's supper
[1:26:56] that's why brother branham said when
[1:26:58] they say discern the body
[1:27:00] they are telling you to discern the
[1:27:02] church
[1:27:07] question and answer in 1963
[1:27:10] many are sick and weakly
[1:27:13] among you because of discerning the
[1:27:16] water
[1:27:18] that is exactly right because the lord's
[1:27:21] body is
[1:27:22] there see they don't know how to behave
[1:27:27] themselves
[1:27:28] lives any kind of life and take
[1:27:30] communion and things like the brother
[1:27:32] was ministering
[1:27:34] that's not right when people take
[1:27:36] communion
[1:27:37] they lie and steal and drink
[1:27:41] that is terrible you should not do
[1:27:44] that everybody clear in a message
[1:27:47] communion brother branham said
[1:27:49] but taking the body of the lord jesus
[1:27:52] christ
[1:27:53] in this communion doesn't mean that
[1:27:56] communion is the literal
[1:27:58] body of christ that
[1:28:01] is catholic i do not believe that is
[1:28:05] right
[1:28:06] i believe it's only a nodiness that god
[1:28:09] made us it is not the actual
[1:28:13] body it is really a little piece of
[1:28:16] kosher bread like the broth explaining
[1:28:19] it is just a nodiness amen
[1:28:23] so what we are taking in the lord supper
[1:28:25] it is a representation
[1:28:28] amen the body of jesus christ is
[1:28:32] represented it is not the body
[1:28:35] but it's just a type a representation
[1:28:39] of the body and the blood of jesus
[1:28:42] christ
[1:28:44] every clear amen adam know
[1:28:47] he was wrong so he just walked out with
[1:28:50] evil but there was a lamb provided for
[1:28:52] them
[1:28:53] that they were redeemed in a message
[1:28:56] souls that are in prison
[1:28:57] after he had done mad men in his own
[1:29:00] image
[1:29:01] created he damn man and what
[1:29:04] and he put him in the dust of the earth
[1:29:08] therefore he become he was
[1:29:11] the man this human man was
[1:29:14] memo he's talking about the body the
[1:29:17] physical body
[1:29:18] he was animal but he
[1:29:21] put this water spirit of god a water
[1:29:26] into water so adam had
[1:29:29] eternal life
[1:29:32] everybody clear brother branham says
[1:29:35] this in the bridge
[1:29:37] the fulfilling title is now in the hand
[1:29:40] of the original owner
[1:29:42] almighty god amen when man
[1:29:45] sin when adam willfully sinned
[1:29:49] the tattoo deal of redemption was taken
[1:29:53] away from adam back to the original
[1:29:56] honor god himself
[1:29:59] because the hand of satan could not
[1:30:02] handle
[1:30:03] the tattoo deal let's go back to genesis
[1:30:06] chapter 3
[1:30:08] [Music]
[1:30:12] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:30:17] genesis chapter 3 verse 22.
[1:30:26] remember the tree of life was there adam
[1:30:29] never touched it
[1:30:31] he was eating everything he already have
[1:30:33] eternal life
[1:30:34] god already gave it to him amen but the
[1:30:38] tree of life
[1:30:39] the title he was in his hand so he has a
[1:30:42] right
[1:30:43] to the tree of life and a right to
[1:30:45] govern the earth
[1:30:46] amen but when he sinned and the tattooed
[1:30:50] he was taken off from him
[1:30:52] then god blocked the access
[1:30:55] to the tree of life now after that
[1:30:59] from that point nobody had
[1:31:02] access again to the tree of life
[1:31:07] genesis 3 verse 22
[1:31:10] and the lord god saying behold the man
[1:31:14] is become as one of us to know good and
[1:31:18] what
[1:31:19] and now lest he put forth his hand
[1:31:22] and take also off the tree of what
[1:31:26] and eat and leave what in other words
[1:31:29] from there on
[1:31:30] no more human being will be allowed
[1:31:34] to approach the tree of life you must
[1:31:36] wait for the redeemer to come
[1:31:39] that's why when jesus christ came he
[1:31:41] said i am the bread that came down
[1:31:44] from heaven in other words i am the tree
[1:31:46] of life that is made flesh
[1:31:50] [Music]
[1:31:51] amen he forfeited it
[1:31:54] when adam forfeited it then certain
[1:31:57] deadly hand could not take it
[1:31:59] he went back to the original order god
[1:32:02] himself it's the title due to the earth
[1:32:05] and to the eternal life they tatted due
[1:32:08] to eternal life
[1:32:09] abstract title due to eternal life when
[1:32:12] adam forfeited for what
[1:32:15] instead of what that's why brother
[1:32:17] branham preached wisdom verses
[1:32:21] i went back to the hand of the honor
[1:32:24] almighty god
[1:32:25] what a great thing everybody clear

[1:33:52] which was the outpouring of the holy

[1:46:51] what
[1:46:52] he was tempting him by the last of the
[1:46:55] flesh

[1:49:48] own power on himself
[1:49:50] to feed him he wanted to feed himself
[1:49:54] he was what a man gets what
[1:49:58] he can do almost he shall still
[1:50:03] rob beg borrow
[1:50:07] anything he had that
[1:50:10] that's your first one here the last of
[1:50:13] the flesh
[1:50:14] everybody clear now we see him in the
[1:50:16] temple
[1:50:17] we're trying to understand the temple
[1:50:20] then the second assault ashahari
[1:50:24] just look like the time just goes fast
[1:50:27] the next greatest thought was that he
[1:50:30] made him
[1:50:32] that he would be a what everybody
[1:50:35] following me
[1:50:36] so when he was telling him to cast
[1:50:38] himself down
[1:50:39] people were under and the devil was
[1:50:42] telling him
[1:50:43] go ahead and show off cash yourself down
[1:50:47] so the people will see you when they
[1:50:49] will see angel coming and carrying you
[1:50:51] up they're going to believe you
[1:50:55] and how that he hit god's servants
[1:50:59] to be here to show what you can do
[1:51:04] glory to god hallelujah i am a deliverer
[1:51:08] i am so-and-so i prayed for so and so he
[1:51:10] was healed
[1:51:11] i prayed for so and so he was healed you
[1:51:13] wonder
[1:51:14] the devil are you there
[1:51:17] come up here on top of the temple
[1:51:20] and set down here he tempted him to do
[1:51:24] it
[1:51:24] now remember he was tempted to do it
[1:51:27] hard
[1:51:28] say now if you want to be something
[1:51:30] before the people
[1:51:32] stand up here on this temple jump off
[1:51:35] i shall give you a scripture for it
[1:51:38] because it's written
[1:51:39] he shall give the angel charge over thee
[1:51:43] lest at any time dash a foot against the
[1:51:46] stone
[1:51:47] he bear you up to make him water
[1:51:50] and show his what everybody care
[1:51:54] that's why brother branham said you must
[1:51:56] check your motives
[1:51:58] and your objective even though it's
[1:52:00] written in the bible
[1:52:02] what is pushing you are you there
[1:52:07] what is motivating you to do what you're
[1:52:09] doing
[1:52:10] if you don't pay attention you wonder
[1:52:13] the pride of life
[1:52:16] everybody clear
[1:52:19] drop down to verse
[1:52:22] 8 the first hunger
[1:52:26] the second at the temple religiously
[1:52:29] the pride of life verse 3 and verse 8

[1:52:36] exceeding water
[1:52:38] high mountain indeed what
[1:52:45] do you see me indeed what
[1:52:49] do you see me do you see my finger
[1:52:54] anybody care
[1:53:00] the devil take him up exceedingly in the
[1:53:03] high mountain
[1:53:04] and shows your eyes
[1:53:07] the lust of the eyes show him all the
[1:53:10] kingdom
[1:53:11] of the and the glory of
[1:53:15] them remember heaven
[1:53:18] was bursting about their glory
[1:53:24] are we okay are we okay now okay
[1:53:28] and say to him all these things
[1:53:32] will i give you if you fall down
[1:53:35] and worship me every clear so we
[1:53:39] understand now that
[1:53:40] when he showed him the glory of the
[1:53:43] kingdom
[1:53:46] everybody there he was with the last of
[1:53:49] the eyes
[1:53:51] the pride of life he took him into a
[1:53:53] temple
[1:53:55] in the holy city
[1:53:58] everybody clear praise the name of the
[1:54:00] lord
[1:54:02] hallelujah now we found out
[1:54:05] that herman spoke about three things
[1:54:09] we have the glory of his riches
[1:54:12] we have the multitude of his children
[1:54:15] and we have the promotion
[1:54:17] or his position that is above everybody
[1:54:21] everybody following me
[1:54:23] we know that children comes by the wheel
[1:54:26] of the flesh
[1:54:29] everybody following me brother branham
[1:54:32] the head body on the sixth dimension
[1:54:35] there could not be sinning
[1:54:38] the man could not be seen the men and
[1:54:41] women
[1:54:42] those women were hugging me brother
[1:54:44] branham went to the sixth dimension
[1:54:46] the women were hugging him and for some
[1:54:49] reason he didn't feel anything
[1:54:51] amen but there was no possibility of
[1:54:55] ever seen there
[1:54:57] again because the glance of her body
[1:55:01] everybody calling me last of the flesh
[1:55:05] last of the flesh the glance of our body
[1:55:08] will be changed there amen
[1:55:11] we are different sex now because
[1:55:14] that is the reproducing of
[1:55:18] where they're reproducing the world for
[1:55:21] the reproducing the world
[1:55:22] and our marriage to bring children but
[1:55:25] then there shall be no more need of that
[1:55:28] there shall be no more children born we
[1:55:31] won't have
[1:55:32] sex glad in the new not at all
[1:55:36] but there will be no more male and
[1:55:38] female among them
[1:55:40] in that way and damn gland won't be in
[1:55:43] so there shall be no way at all for
[1:55:46] satan to ever work
[1:55:48] another trick on because the sex glands
[1:55:52] are no longer there
[1:55:53] then the lust of the flesh is
[1:55:55] automatically
[1:55:56] blocked everybody there that is
[1:56:00] the redemption of the body when we
[1:56:02] receive
[1:56:03] glorified body he automatically block
[1:56:06] the devil
[1:56:07] everybody clear brother branham said he
[1:56:10] showed here
[1:56:12] in the beginning that his perfect will
[1:56:14] was to create man out of the dust of
[1:56:17] them
[1:56:18] we talked about it already he permitted
[1:56:20] what
[1:56:22] to be brought in he never did intend
[1:56:25] children to be born by what but he was
[1:56:28] what
[1:56:29] which will soon fade away amen
[1:56:33] so when heaven was talking about the
[1:56:35] multitude of his children
[1:56:38] amen was showing one of his kingdom
[1:56:42] category which is the last of them
[1:56:46] everybody cleared so far amen
[1:56:49] the last of the earth which is the glory
[1:56:51] of his kingdom
[1:56:52] remember jesus they show him the glory
[1:56:55] of the kingdom
[1:56:56] the last of the eyes and the third one
[1:56:59] he was a promotion
[1:57:01] he's above everybody the king promoted
[1:57:04] him
[1:57:04] the king put him above everybody that is
[1:57:07] the proud of what
[1:57:09] all that is in the world the lust of the
[1:57:12] flesh
[1:57:14] the last of the eyes and the pride of
[1:57:16] life
[1:57:17] that's why herman is demonstrating you
[1:57:20] his kingdom
[1:57:22] that he is about the last of the eyes
[1:57:24] he's about the last of the flesh
[1:57:27] and he's about the pride of what life
[1:57:30] and his promotion came from who from the
[1:57:33] kingdom
[1:57:35] psalm 75 the bible says
[1:57:39] that promotion cometh leader from what
[1:57:43] and from what and from what
[1:57:47] did you see it from the north
[1:57:55] are we okay why not from the north
[1:58:00] because he comes from the north
[1:58:04] what is in the north
[1:58:07] psalm 48 beautiful for situation
[1:58:12] the joy of the whole world is mount what
[1:58:16] jerusalem on the side of the
[1:58:20] [Music]
[1:58:22] the city of the great that's why
[1:58:25] david said not enough because the
[1:58:28] promotion comes from god
[1:58:30] and god is in the north
[1:58:36] isaiah 14 how are they
[1:58:39] falling from heaven or lucifer son of
[1:58:42] the morning
[1:58:43] how are they cut down to the ground
[1:58:46] which did weaken the nation

[1:58:58] god
[1:58:58] i will sit also upon the word
[1:59:02] of the congregation in what
[1:59:06] why was lucifer looking for the north
[1:59:11] amen that's where the king is
[1:59:14] i will ascend above the height of the
[1:59:16] cloud
[1:59:17] i will be like the most high everybody
[1:59:20] clear
[1:59:21] amen now when we spoke about the world
[1:59:25] now the world the true
[1:59:29] meaning of the word is not the planet

[2:03:27] turnaround it is turned
[2:03:30] round about by his council
[2:03:35] that they may do whatsoever he commands
[2:03:38] them
[2:03:39] upon the face of the indy
[2:03:44] everybody see that do you see that

[2:03:58] that
[2:03:58] inside the planet there is the world
[2:04:03] amen in the planet earth

[2:05:28] the world is not the planet
[2:05:32] the planet is earth the world is
[2:05:36] whatever is inside the planet
[2:05:40] that is what is called the world
[2:05:44] that's why when they say heaven and
[2:05:46] earth will pass away you gotta know what
[2:05:47] they're talking about
[2:05:49] amen brother branham what is the world
[2:05:54] he uses the word world
[2:05:57] as the greek word cosmos
[2:06:00] which means what the world order
[2:06:04] in other words the atmosphere within the
[2:06:07] earth
[2:06:08] within the planet earth everybody clear
[2:06:11] the earth shall pass away melt the
[2:06:14] element with fervent heat
[2:06:16] does not mean that the earth
[2:06:20] the planet is going to pass away
[2:06:23] not the planet amen but the world
[2:06:27] cosmos the what
[2:06:30] inside the world inside the earth the
[2:06:33] sinner
[2:06:35] the system sin disease
[2:06:39] germs everything that is what
[2:06:42] all that is in the world
[2:06:46] is combined in the lust of the flesh
[2:06:50] it's combined in the last of the eyes
[2:06:52] and it's combined
[2:06:54] in the pride of life everybody follow me
[2:06:59] satan's army bring diseases
[2:07:02] that is what satan is he is a destroyer
[2:07:05] the whole kingdom of satan is what
[2:07:09] and what and what and what
[2:07:12] and what and what all of
[2:07:16] satan amen god's eden
[2:07:20] was established in righteousness satan's
[2:07:23] idiom
[2:07:24] is establishing sin because satan is
[2:07:27] what
[2:07:28] god is righteousness and god's kingdom
[2:07:31] was established in righteousness
[2:07:33] and peace and life and satan's
[2:07:35] establishment
[2:07:36] is in sin and religious sin
[2:07:40] everybody clear in first john chapter 5
[2:07:44] verse 19
[2:07:45] the bible says that we know that we are
[2:07:48] of god
[2:07:48] and the whole world lie in what
[2:07:53] the cosmos the atmosphere within the
[2:07:56] earth
[2:07:57] is completely of the devil
[2:07:59] [Music]
[2:08:02] if the world not the earth now
[2:08:06] hates you if heaven
[2:08:09] hates you if an amalekite
[2:08:13] hates you are you following me you know
[2:08:16] that
[2:08:16] he hated me before he hated you
[2:08:19] if you were often the world would have
[2:08:25] the reason why you are not loved because
[2:08:28] you don't belong
[2:08:29] to the kingdom of satan
[2:08:34] because you are not of the world
[2:08:37] but i have chosen you out of the world
[2:08:41] therefore the world hated you everybody
[2:08:44] clear
[2:08:45] amen and she spare not this is peter
[2:08:49] the old world but save noah
[2:08:52] the eighth person a preacher of
[2:08:55] righteousness
[2:08:56] bringing the flood upon the earth of the
[2:08:59] earth the planet was not destroyed
[2:09:02] but it was the people and the lifestyle
[2:09:04] that was on the planet that was
[2:09:06] destroyed
[2:09:07] that is called the world amen
[2:09:10] that's why the bible say whereby the
[2:09:13] world that was
[2:09:14] then not the planet being overflown by
[2:09:17] what
[2:09:19] perish the world perish but the planet
[2:09:22] was still there
[2:09:23] everybody clear amen
[2:09:28] hallelujah brother pronoun in the mark
[2:09:31] of the beast
[2:09:32] he said don't act like the hidden the
[2:09:35] unbeliever
[2:09:36] don't yoke yourself with them come out
[2:09:39] from among them
[2:09:40] don't be this way if you love them
[2:09:43] and the things of the the word
[2:09:47] so we found out that fashion is of the
[2:09:50] world
[2:09:51] that word comes from the greek cosmos
[2:09:54] which means the fashion of god
[2:09:59] hallelujah and they that use this word
[2:10:04] as not abusing it for the fashion of
[2:10:07] this word
[2:10:09] will do what because it's part of the
[2:10:13] are you following me that's why paul
[2:10:16] said that
[2:10:17] be not conformed to this what because
[2:10:20] this world
[2:10:21] is under this category that's the power
[2:10:25] of heaven amen be not confirmed to this
[2:10:29] world

[2:10:37] acceptable and perfect will of what
[2:10:40] the friendship of the world is what
[2:10:44] because you are under heaven
[2:10:49] everybody enmity with god
[2:10:53] whatsoever therefore will be a friend of
[2:10:55] them
[2:10:57] not the planet is the enemy of who
[2:11:00] because of these three categories
[2:11:03] everybody clear
[2:11:06] there is so many people that doesn't
[2:11:09] seems to have any kind of a purpose in
[2:11:11] life
[2:11:12] especially in this day that we now live
[2:11:15] people
[2:11:15] just seems to think that all they have
[2:11:18] to do
[2:11:18] is to keep up with somebody else
