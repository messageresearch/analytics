Believe amen God bless you this evening amen how many believers do we have here amen amen with that many Believers gathered in the same room under the same atmosphere amen something good is bound to happen amen we we're fir firm Believers that when Believers get together amen the pillar of fire comes visible Among Us and his word is revealed and his spirit is amen made known and we are so thankful tonight to be amen identified with him identified with this word that's been revealed in this generation and we want to say God bless you all this evening it is a real honor to be here amen once again with you all and amen coming down to the end of this uh year of 2024 yes amen and facing a brand new year but we are very well aware that as the prophet of God said we're not going to meet the old year as we did this year he said we'll meet it in the power of his resurrection and amen tonight I want to say God bless you all and amen we do thank you brother Steven for the opportunity the invitation to be here and I was looking today and thinking I think we've had the opportunity to speak to you this year about uh about once every month amen or maybe missed one or two so amen we we uh we thank you amen for allowing us to come and amen we pray we pray it's been a blessing to you and we just have a few things here tonight on our heart we want to speak to you from the word of the Lord on Amen maybe we just bow our hearts for a word of prayer amen and just invite him to come by your way and ask him to speak to your heart tonight Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here on this Wednesday evening father we're so thankful for the grace that you've given unto us Lord to serve you and to live for you and Lord to believe in you and the promises of your word and Lord to know that you as has been said have been better to us than we could be to ourselves Lord we have so much to thank you for Lord we have so much to praise you for if we would if you would never do anything else for us Lord we can never praise you enough for what you've already done so Lord as we come in this building tonight recognizing your presence father realizing the atmosphere that's among us as a creative at atmosphere Lord we bring our needs and our petitions before your throne tonight of grace and mercy and Lord we're asking you may you move across this congregation tonight Lord father you see the needs in our bodies oh God but you're still Jehovah Rafa Lord you see the needs and homes and lives but you're still Jehovah Gyra Lord so we're turning our attention from the cares of life and the things of the world situations oh God and Lord we're looking away to Jesus tonight inviting come Among Us in a special way open your word to our hearts oh God and Lord I pray for those that would not be here tonight maybe streaming at home or will'll hear this sermon father I want to make this very well aware Lord we have nothing of our own to offer but this message so father May something be said that would benefit those both in the present and invisible audience oh God Lord forgive us of our failures and our shortcomings Lord and draw us closer into thyself as we prepare for the close of this year Lord preparing to go into a new year Lord may we take inventory oh God and Lord may we move forward underneath the banner of this word now father we commit this service tonight in thy precious name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen amen and amen God bless you tonight if you have your Bibles we want to go to the book of St Luke the 16th chapter the book of St Luke the 16th chapter and then also we're going to read in Philippians in 2 Corinthians amen while you're turning there tonight we do want to bring in greetings from our pastor brother Matt Morris and the Saints there at home and Grace Tabernacle send their greetings to you tonight and we do appreciate having brother Thomas here with us again tonight appreciate him bringing us over and amen sure appreciate the Lord amen amen St Luke chapter 16 and verse number 16 the law and the prophets were until John and since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presseth that's right into it I want you to catch this the kingdom of God is preached yes sir or spoken or declared or published the kingdom of God is preached and every man presseth into it so there is a preaching of the Kingdom but then there is a pressing into the preaching of the kingdom of God now in Philippians chapter 3 Philippians chapter 3 in verse number 13 another uh very familiar scripture to you now in the scriptures here tonight Philippians 3 and verse 13 Paul here is using the word again of our Lord Jesus there in St Luke 16 and verse number 13 He says Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended right but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind that's right and reaching forth unto those things which are before notice not going back to what's behind us forgetting what's behind us and pressing forward toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus so whatever is behind us is not worth going back to it's worth forgetting but whatever is in front of us is worth pressing forward to in the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 4 2 Corinthians chapter 4 there I believe we'll find the way that we press 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse number 13 Paul again here writing he says now we having the same Spirit of Faith according as it is written I believed and therefore have I spoken that's right now we also believe and therefore speak so Paul is showing us the way we press is believing the things that have been spoken in the spirit of the same Faith they were spoken in so they're spoken by faith you believe them by faith and then you speak them by faith and as you speak them you press forward look at the 18th verse while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal that's right so they're just passing they're temporary that's but the things which are not seen are Eternal we ask Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon I want to uh by the help of the Lord for just a few moments tonight if I would take a title I want to talk to you on this pressing by faith into the realities of the Unseen pressing by faith into the realities of the Unseen you know I believe tonight we can all agree that God is a reality Amen brother br will tell us that many times God is a reality now when you begin to speak of this word press that word press Webster defines it amen it means to move or to cause to move into a position of contact with someone or something by exerting a continuous physical Force so when you when you are pressing on something amen you are intending to move it by applying Force upon it when you look here it word reality uh Webster again says reality is a thing that exists in fact amen having previously only existed in one's mind so at one time what you see in reality was only existing in one's mind now amen how can I think of that and not be reminded of Michelangelo when he sculpted that great sculpture of Moses and the prophet of God said see the negative of the what was in his mind had become real it become positive therefore it sprung into him amen so before there was a reality of what was in his mind amen there was a thought there was a desire there was an idea amen but it had to be transferred amen into reality now you know tonight that the most powerful force on Earth amen is a believer in contact with his maker the prophet of God will say this there is no more powerful for worse than God Amen another place one of the doctors said well I tell you I find that the greatest power in the world Amen is not the atomic bomb amen but a believer in contact with his maker it changes the whole attitude it changes his mental it changes his habit it changes his body amen it changes his nature everything now at 1949 brother speaking I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision and it begins to to talk about the subject of Science and he said now just thinking of how that science how they are taking amen the natural man and how he's went into the research amen from the fall of the natural and what he has done but how little the spiritual man has progressed Amen in the kingdom of God so there is a natural man amen and there is a spiritual man he said I was thinking that the natural man went out amen at the Unseen of his eye and he pulled an adom down out of the sky and he split that Adam in two that destroys human life now if the natural man that knows nothing of God and cannot know nothing of God except he be converted then his soul becomes alive with the supernal if he could do that in the natural realm amen then what off a man of God to be doing my friends he said the church is so far behind amen but let's pray my that God Amen will move his church up the natural man with the natural resource is getting greater results amen than the people are that calls themselves Christians Listen he says let's press into the Unseen amen let's press into the Unseen the blessings are there amen they're yours and they are there for you listen it took a prophet to come among the church and to identify where the blessings amen of the church are the blessings are not in the natural amen they're not in the seene they're not in the visible amen but the blessings are in the Unseen that's why a Prophet come among the church and preaches about three times amen looking at the Unseen amen or looking to the Unseen 1950 he says looking the Unseen I want you to I want you to take this quote in your heart and I want you to take it as a foundation for this sermon he said now we look at the Unseen and believe those things that which are unseen amen but spoke of by God Amen they become Realties we look at the Unseen and believe that those things which are unseen amen but spoke of by God they become realities listen what it is it's the infallibility or the authority of God's spoken word he said if this audience tonight could only get settled in their mind of who said this and what this really is this spoken word we would not need a healing service we would not need any salvation altar call it would be finished if you realized amen what the word was amen now let's look at it amen before it could be a word spoken it has to be a thought because a word is a thought made manifest when God speaks amen so a word is a fault made manifest when God speaks now back in the beginning when God looked down to the corridors of heaven and saw all the things amen that were going to happen on the earth did you ever say it and just draw a picture out in your mind amen that's the way God did it amen perhaps in the beginning then it seemed good to him so he spoke it and as soon as it was spoken it became a word amen the thought was expressed in a word now listen once God expresses his thought and makes it a word he can never take it back oh Church of the Living God when God ever thinks something and then speaks what he is thinking it becomes a word or an expression of a fault and God can never take it back how perfect it was amen before the foundation of the world Amen Jesus was already slain the Bible said he was the lamb amen slain from the foundation of the world how was he slain amen the very minute God spoke the word it was settled forever the seed was planted and it had to come to pass because he cannot speak nothing but the unadulterated truth amen so Jesus was the Lamb of God Amen that would be slain listen it was 4,000 years amen from the time that was spoken until the time that it was fulfilled amen but listen it never failed and it became a reality what are you saying I'm saying church that we are a two-fold being amen we have an inward man and we have an outward man and the prophet of God said the outward man amen he looks by his eyes amen but the inward man walks by faith we have to be led by one of these two person the outward man is self amen but the inward man is God you see you do not see with our eyes though many times we thought we see with our eyes we only look with our eyes amen but we see with our heart we look with our eyes but we see with our heart listen Malachi 4 said that he would turn our hearts amen back to the faith of the Pentecostal father listen God done that in order for the church amen to see more than the problems to see more than the situations to see more than the doctor's report to see more than your past to see more than the oh God to see more than everything that's going on around you but God sent a message in this generation Amen to turn our hearts amen back to the faith so we could see things the way God sees things we can believe things the way God believes things and when you begin to believe the way God believes it will be more than just a good service it will be more than just a gathering but what you're believing will become a reality in the Church of the Living God hallelujah amen

more amen than just stimulate my intellect it has done more than just make me feel a little bit better than somebody else it has revealed to me that there is a Bible and it is a prophetic book and it is full of prophetic promises listen we have been called under a Divine commission to possess Divine promises there is a promise of healing in this book and somebody's going to it there is a promise of Deliverance and somebody is going to possess it there is a promise of a breakthrough and somebody is going to possess it there is a promise amen that a man can live so close to God until the devil don't know what to do with him and somebody is going to do more than read it they're going to do more than memorize it they're going to possess it because they're here commissioned of God they're not looking to the left they're not looking to the right said a man that is commissioned of God he looks upward a man that's under a commission of God he does not look to the right he does not look to the left he does not look behind him he does not look below him he looks upward and onward he is not listening to the world he's got a Divine commission from God well somebody shout we're going forward we're not going backwards we're going forward we're not going back to the second pull we're going forward we're not going back to a Pentecostal shuck we're going forward listen the Holy Ghost is among the church and when the Holy Ghost comes among the church he is doing more than just making us shout he's doing more than just making us dance but he's making us perseverance come on church if you're going to make it out of Layon of see I pray the Holy Ghost baptize you with a persevering Spirit listen it's going to take more than a handshake and a phone call and a text message Amen to get you out of this age it's going to take the strength of the general of the host of the Lord amen to come into your soul and to cause you to push against every devil push against every Spirit push against every demon I have not been anointed to lay down I have been anointed to press until the things that I believe have been spoken of by God become realities in the age I'm living in my my my I believe every Christian should be very we should be very perseverant come on Daddy be perseverant come on Mama be perseverant I know the devil might have come in and taken them babies out but be perseverant [Applause] Hallelujah brother said as long as a Christian can know that he's living above sin and the Holy Spirit is blessing him and standing with him amen then be perseverant amen and press towards the mark of the High Calling listen Christians should be that way Christians should be very perseverant in their claims to God when you make a claim on God Amen that ain't the time to rely and fold your arms and say well I made a claim that's the time to draw your sword put on the breastplate of righteousness get your feet shot with the preparation of the Gospel put on the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit and get ready to go to war with that devil we're not a bunch of sissies we're not a bunch of cowards we're not a bunch of pullbacks we are Sons and Daughters of God and we happen to be soldiers in the army of the Living God we're not just playing Church we're not just playing Church we're pressing we're pressing said what are we pressing to he said Paul said it I'll quote it again forget those things that are in the past and now I press towards the mark of the High Calling listen to what he said to the complete identification come on Church we're not just pressing to a good service or pressing to a better atmosphere or pressing to a raise on our job we are pressing to the complete identification when all time will fade out into eternity when Jesus comes so there is a connection between the complete identification of the church and the coming of the Lord listen we're not going to have a rearview mirror Affair a rear viw mirrror only looks back to see where you've been but we're looking forward to see where we're going now come on church we have climbed the seven step pyramid we have come to the third pull we have come to the fourth line we have come underneath the fourth dispensational change can I say this to you I am not looking in the rearview mirror and saying God was moving in Pentacost and God was moving in Wesley's day and God was moving in Luther's day no I've got my eyes on the prize I got my heart and it's set on the goal of the changing of my body don't look through a rearview mirror 40 years ago look what is tonight come on Church the scripture promised things 40 years ago but he promised things today we're going on we're going on what are we doing we are pressing into the Fulfillment of scripture promises brother said like this break out of this Hollywood you got too much fashion to the world you got too much care amen break out of that he says we need a Revival now brother makes it very plain he said he said now look at Luke 16:16 the law and the prophets amen were un John amen but since that time amen the kingdom of God is preached and every man amen pray into it do you know the only way to advance Amen in this hour is to press there is a real devil and he's standing in front of you and he's telling you you've gone as far as you can go you've come as far as you can come you know what he's telling you he's telling you there's nothing else for you and you've got all that you can get but you know what I tell him I tell him he's a liar I tell him he's the father of all lies I tell him as long as I'm here and there's a desire in my heart for more of God there's more of God somewhere for me to have somewhere or another you got to get tired of letting that devil put spiritual limitations on your progress in the kingdom of God if the natural man has come all the way to artificial intelligence amen then what about the spiritual man I say we've gone beyond artificial intelligence we have stepped into the Supreme intelligence of Jesus Christ where there is a promise of a body change there is a promise of a future home there is a promise of a theophany come on if we're going to press we got to preach something worth pressing into now when you look here at this word prth the word preci means to use and to apply force in 1 Corinthians 9:26 you know what Paul says he said I therefore so run amen not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beateth the air now let me say this we're not fighting Flesh and Blood we are fighting Spirits we are fighting Powers we are fighting wickedness we are fighting the slate and cunning craftiness of men whereby they lie and wait to deceive we are fighting a spiritual battle but the prophet of God comes along in 1963 and preaches the message desperations and he says every man amen presses into it amen not just simply walks in it amen but it's got to be pressed into so you're not going to Simply relax and take a stroll and just walk into these promises but you're going to have to press you're going to have to apply some Force you're going to have to use some violence against the devil and say devil I know you don't want me there but I want to tell you something you don't have enough to stop me because I know who I am I know who I am believing I know who I'm following I am following the Vindicated spoken word when brother R preaches that message desperation you'll find that desperation amen will cause you to press now let me say this the desperation that he was speaking of it was not a fear f it was not a begging desperation it was a desperation with a sense of urgency that there's something worth moving into he said the law and the prophets were until John but since then the Kingdom of Heaven has been preached and Men press into it you don't just stand around and say pick me up by the collar Lord and push me on in no you press into it you get desperate it's between life and death now let me say this I love what the pro of God does in 1963 when he preaches I'm just laying the foundation when he preaches desperation he said I want to speak tonight on giving them courage listen to is open and prayer I want to encourage them to take that god-given right they have a right to defeat that devil he is already defeated and he is just BL in them but I'm claiming them Father now help me to speak the word you speak through me Lord with this few notes I got wrote down here and little scriptures wrote out I pray that you'll help me Lord listen and get in the word so he's inviting the author of the word to come into the meeting and to get in the word and to give them faith for the glory of the Lord let me say this the faith that we need am and it Cometh From the word in Hebrews 11:1 Paul said faith is the substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report listen and through faith and through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear said like this he said now what you do is you testify of the things you do not see you testify of the things you do not see in other words you don't testify of what you see you testify of what you don't see come on now if you go to the doctor and the doctor runs a St in and he comes back and he said this is wrong and this is wrong and that's wrong we can see that but we don't testify that because what we see is only temporary but what we don't see is eternal so we begin to talk about the things we don't see we begin to talk come on church we don't testify of the CAT scan we don't testify of the blood report we don't testify of the MRI we testify of Isaiah 53 because Isaiah 53 is more real than any report it's more real than any situation I don't care what you see I'm going to talk about what I don't see you testify of the things you do not [Applause] see well glory to God somebody say well my my son is on drugs okay you see the drugs you see the alcohol you see the filth you see the sin you see all that why are you talking about [Applause] that why are you talking about that that drug is not real come on Amen that devil that's holding that baby is not real but I tell you what Israel who the son has made free it's free indeed because whatever is spoken by God if a Believer will believe it it will become a reality Hallelujah well you know what I say I say it's time to tell that devil my babies are coming home it's time to tell that devil I'm taking back my joy I'm taking back my peace I'm taking back my prayer life I'm taking back my victory I'm taking back my testimony I'm taking back my song I'm taking back my dance I'm taking back my song because I am a believer and I believe in things that I cannot see I cannot feel I cannot hear I cannot taste I cannot remember I cannot imagine my conscious is not aware of but my soul is Anointed with the super sense and the six sense and I refuse I refuse to lay down and go back I have been called to believe things I don't [Applause] see and then believe in those things brother Zach we going to move [Applause] forward brother said faith faith is something that's born in you it is something that God gives you he said it is Supernatural and it does Supernatural things can I tell you what else it is amen spiritual Faith only recognizes the [Applause] word spiritual Faith only recognizes the word he said now we want to speak on a different kind of Faith he said it's called perfect Faith he said now Faith is something that you have to believe it's there faith is something you have to believe it's there that really nothing else will declare it's there but Faith that's right so you've got to believe there's a body change come on Church you got to believe there's a theophany you got to believe there's a future home you got to believe there's a millennium you've got to believe there's a Lamb's Book of Life and you got to believe your name is in it you got to believe that there is a th000 m long table called the married supper of the lamb and you got to see that it you got to believe that you can't see it you can't feel it you can't hear it you can't taste it you can't remember it from your REM oh but in your soul in your soul there is a deposit of the spoken word of God come on church and when the devil Pils upon you when the devil says you don't have a future when the devil says you're not going in the Rapture when the devil says your name is not in the Lamb's Book of Life when the devil says the Holy Ghost is not for you and the devil says there's not a spot at the table of the lamb for you you know what the prophet of God said he said faith is an unseen Force glory to God it's a spirit and the Holy Spirit brings Faith so what brings you to church on Wednesday night when the devil's piled upon you he's piled upon your mind he's piled upon your spirit he's piled upon your babies he's pwed upon your home he pwed upon you for job but here you are in the house of God on a Wednesday night and you got a song in your heart you got a pep in your step what is it it's Faith it's an unseen Force it's an unseen Force and the Holy Ghost brings Faith said oh you claim you got faith but you know when Jesus becomes Lord of your faith then all of his words become real to you when Jesus becomes the Lord of your faith then all of his words become real to you now what is Faith it is the evidence of Things Not Seen that's right look here in Hebrews 11:7 the Bible said by Faith by faith Noah being warned of God a Things Not Seen are you ready for this as yet woo Glory he moved with fear and he prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is is by Faith by faith Noah moo with fear prepared an ark he moved with fear without seeing rain he prepared an ark without seeing rain look here the Bible said things not seen in the Amplified Bible that translates to this events not yet [Applause] seen events not yet right events oh we got tapes called modery are made clear by the prophecy in other words if you can believe the prophecy you know you'll see the [Applause] event somebody say well we got to see the event to believe the prophecy well a real believer believes the prophecy more than they believe the event come on church amen right now we got seven major visions that that that that have been recorded underneath a prophetic Ministry remember said there would be a driverless car do you realize right now in California you can punch on your phone I've seen it with my own eyes you can punch in your phone car will come no driver in it pick you up take you down the road come on people say oh that all excite the bride listen it don't excite me no more than it did the first day I heard the prophecy because I am a believer therefore if it's spoke of by God it don't matter how long it don't matter who it don't matter when I know it's going to become a reality come on Church you know what I'm talking about amen right now amen people are debating on whether the vision was fulfilled because Calia Harris amen stood there in a purple robe amen well let's just go back to the prophecy he said it was either a woman president or it was the Catholic [Applause] church now we might as well preach we this close to it you realize the Catholics have been in charge for years the majority of the Supreme Court Justices are Catholics your last president was a Catholic in 1960s they brought a Catholic in the White House are you hearing me listen friends I don't have to get my eye so tuned down on the detailss that I can miss the prophecy I believe the prophecy now you know what the Bible said the Bible said Noah waited and believed and mo with fear and he built an ark he said don't criticize while the old fellow must have been crazy he said there had no clouds ever come but there was a cloud before there was a drop of water in the Skies Noah with the Unseen of the natural ey but with his spiritual eye tuned to the word of God he's seen the rain falling oh if we tonight could so tune our hearts amen not our literal mind Let It Go but cast down reasonings but with our hearts could tune it to the word of God to see a Revival Break Forth to see the altars full to see the church pack to see the Revival spreading through Los Angeles a fire that cannot be put out our Hearts would begin to pulsate under the power of the Holy Ghost there would be such a prayer meeting over Los Angeles tonight it would have to happen he said when the church is in tune what if people here tonight that's sick would begin to think God is God and if he isn't then why serve him listen if he's still God he's still a Healer if he's allmighty God he can do all things and if he made a promise he cannot break it he has to keep [Music] [Applause] then that pulsation begins to rise in your heart something is going to take place there could be nothing stop it it's a fire like a building on fire on a windy day it just keeps blowing as the Holy Spirit fans the fire can I preach it to you listen and it becomes it keeps burning until it becomes a reality to you so when the Holy Ghost set your heart on fire with authority of the word the Holy Ghost fans the flame he fans the flame until the fire burns out all the draw it burns out all the unbelief and there is a reality burst in that Soul oh he said see he in the body it doesn't become a fiction it becomes a reality amen the baptism of the Holy Spirit it doesn't become an emotional worked up substance it becomes a reality of the indwelling presence of the Lord Jesus Christ to change the life see friends it's not by our feelings that we press it's not by our emotions that we press it's by the spoken word of God it's by the word of faith that we press the Bible said the word of faith which we preach you know what a prophet of God said he said the preaching of the gospel is a million miles Beyond just Visions he said it's a million miles Beyond just the Supernatural part he said see the success of the church amen it lies within the preaching of the Gospel of the power of God and the demonstration of the spirit so what does God do God sends his word by anointed preachers who will preach to you the spoken word and they will speak it in the same Spirit of faith that it was spoken this what a prophet said he said you can only serve God on the earth as God's servants that sent on Earth by divine inspiration interprets the word to you who Mercy therefore he sent anointed preachers to preach the word and you received it listen he sent anointed preachers to preach the word and you received it he said Christ does not anoint ministers to preach the gospel just have it returned back to him void but he expects you to receive the word and in receiving the word be ready come on Church in receiving the word be ready listen we have been taught that we get what we expect if you expect bad you're going to get bad if you expect good you're going to get good listen if a human has the ability to bring to pass things by the Simplicity of expectation then what about the infinite God he expects us to receive his word what are you saying as you receive the word as you receive the word you become the word come on church as you hear the word as you receive the word as you believe the word you become the word listen this is the season of manifestation this is the season of Miracles it's the season when the spoken word is becoming a reality but not in Bible days not 50 years ago not 20 years ago but right here tonight right here tonight in the house of God the word of God is becoming a reality now what are you saying I'm saying the word of God is becoming a [Applause] reality can I say it like this in the same service yes prayer request are becoming testimonies in the same service not two weeks later not 3 weeks later but in the same service a prayer request is becoming a testimony Hallelujah because it's more than the ideas of a man it's the unadulterated truth of the spoken word what he saying Amen brother Zach you probably remember this amen a few years ago preaching down at brother Dale's on that Sunday night amen I was preaching there and it was back during coed and they brought a pray request up and it was actually 2020 I think amen right there they brought a prayer request up amen and they read this prayer request there was a baby stricken with a fever they were taking to the hospital the fever wouldn't break it was a high fever I never forget as long as I live and we prayed over that prayer request and I got up there and got to preaching on the household of faith and how we are not a part of the household of fear though it was a day of fear an hour of fear but we are a part of the household of faith and about halfway through that sermon they walked up the all up the A and they laid a testimony on the or a piece of paper and it said read it and I turned it over and I read it you know what it said it said the fever is broke the fever is broke and the baby's okay I think it was you amen that the Holy Ghost h on the front was that you Holy Ghost did amen I read that testimony brother Zach jumped up on the front row and took off front and down the aisle back and forth praising God you say that's an emotional worked up substance no it's not it's the reality of a Believer who is in contact with his maker it's the reality that if there is a devil there is a God and he's big enough and he's strong enough and he's Mighty enough to change the situation I refuse to lay down and let the devil take our services I tell you what it's time to do it's time to preach the word and go forward it's time to break the spirit the preaching of the Gospel the preaching of the Gospel is the casting out of the devil said what is it he said see the devil broke away from you he has too can I just say this right now I want to dedicate this to every devil in the building I believe with all my heart direct quote that every demon power that's in here at this minute is already broken it's already broken come on spoken word Tabernacle amen broken chains Can't Hold You Broken Shackle they cannot hold you Broken Spirits they cannot hold you who the son has made free it's free indeed there is a liberty in the house of God to believe the things of God hallelujah hallelujah what is it faith is coming by hearing what's it coming by hearing of coming by the hearing of the word of God made manifest come on Church we're not just reading Bible stories we're preaching manifested word it's the season brother it's a season when the confession is becoming manifestation it's the season when the fault of the mind is becoming reality you say preacher I can't feel it it don't matter how you feel it's up to how you believe well I can't see it it don't matter what you can see can you believe it can you believe it can you believe it can you believe it can you believe what a prophet said can you believe what the word says can you believe what the spirit speaks can you believe it can you believe it can you believe that this Bible is the infallible the inspired the perfect word of almighty God can you believe the promises of it if you can believe it then you can possess it [Applause] Hallelujah you say preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about water in the word you want a Revival start watering the word the promise if you want to come out of that wheelchair start watering the word if you want to come away from that cancer start watering the word well I don't feel like it he didn't say feel it he said water [Applause] it come on Church it ain't your feelings that makes the garden grow it's the water come on church amen there's days you don't feel like getting up and going out there and turning on the water hose and water in the garden but if you want it to grow you got to get up and you got to go turn on the water and you got to water back and forth come on Church there's times you don't feel like listening to a tape you don't feel like going to church you don't feel like singing you don't feel like preaching you don't feel like worshiping but we're not here based upon our feelings we are here upon the spoken word of God you know what he said he said this bride this bride will be the literal spoken word seen [Applause] bride how do you water the word brother Andrew how do I water the word you water the word by punctuating the word with an [Applause] amen amen amen everything that man preaches from this message you ought to say Amen everything that a man of God says behind this pit that comes from this message you ought to say Amen you ought to say Amen when you feel like it and you ought to say it when you don't because you know what amens do they change atmospheres brother Kelly amens will change atmospheres what are you saying I'll just say this when the bride begins to praise when the bride begins to praise her praise is different she does not wait until the spoken word is manifested to praise God but the minute she hears it the minute she hears for he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying to the church the minute this bride he he the promise of the [Applause] word she puts her shout and shoes on she putes her dancing shoes on because she's praising God for the coming [Applause] manifestation I may have I may have testified of it here before but I'm going to testify again this bride does not wait for the evidence toay God she does not wait for the evidence to believe the promise come on church she starts praising God on the purchasing power now what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying this the prodag God said I think now to be conscience of the spirit near us it's time to break out of the shell on of the hour We're living and the time uhhuh and be conscience of the spirit of God now Among Us let me say this anointed preachers are not preaching their ideas they are preaching under the pure inspiration of his presence in St John 14:19 Jesus said yet a little while and the world which is the unbeliever seeth me no more but ye which is the believer see me because I he says which is Christ live ye shall live also when Jesus was leaving the world after a Ministry of that around the world the known world that day he said this the works I do shall you do also now listen to is going away l a little while and the world the visible intellectual cultured scientific the world will see me no more that's exactly a prophecy right it cannot help but be the truth the intellectual believer the world won't see me no more but yet ye shall see me for I will be with you even in you to the end of the age and the works I have done the works I have done shall you do also and More Than This shall you do for I go to my father listen to the prophet he said Jesus Christ in his church in his branches energizing them bringing forth the same fruit right that he brought when he was here on the earth now listen when he come to the church in the last day he's going to come in the fullness yes in the fullness of the light of the Sun come on listen so the fullness of Christ is in the bride which is making her undefeatable listen to The Prophet when you really realize that God has revealed to you the truth of the F there's nothing in the world is going to defeat you in it you are absolutely you are absolutely undefeatable not you but God that's in you not Christ not the body but this word that was in him not Mary but the word that was born from her the word in you is making you absolutely come on Church undefeatable what are you saying I'm saying this we're preaching more than just ideas we are preaching the word of faith and the Word of Promise revealed can I say what a prophet said somebody somebody say well I don't think we ought to read all these quotes and I don't think we ought to amen amen I'm fighting the devil right now but I'm on fight and preach I don't think we ought to read all these quotes and refer to these tapes well listen what a prophet said anoint the ones at the end time now care all for this message and when you listen to the tape even maybe I'll be gone someday when the Lord is finished with me here on the Earth but you'll refer back to this listen to my voice [Applause] what I'm telling you if he takes me before his [Applause] coming we are pressing towards the mark of the complete identification of when time will fade out into eternity when Jesus comes but here the prophet of God says if he takes me before his coming right come on that's right come on in I've got to come back and set up a tent and fly on an airplane and open the seventh seal and preach the third pool on no if he takes me before his coming you just remember I have spoke to you in the name of the Lord by the word of the [Applause] Lord Church of the Living God we have got what it takes to come to the complete identification we're not waiting for a prophet to come back oh come on Church a prophet was ministering an entrance now can I say something to you an entrance is an exit as [Applause] well an entrance is an exit as well when you come in the door you leave something behind you the Bible says an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ what is he saying to enter into something you've got to exit something to go into the bride age you got to leave the Leon and age to go into the fullness of the word you've got to leave the Shu come on church and to go into Perfection you've got to leave Works behind you listen we're not just church members we are Kingdom people who are manifesting the Kingdom on this Earth what are you saying preacher I'm saying this we've gotten so used to Leota [Applause] now I was I was over here the other day preaching for

shut it real quick you know why the sun almost blinded [Applause] me for three days I had gotten so used to looking at something a certain way that the clouds had become reality and the rain had become the reality and the dreariness had become the reality but on the other side on the other side of a thin layer of clouds was the sun and it was shining you know what the pro of God said he said let's turn our cameras up this morning and look up yonder in heaven let's break out of this Dimension and look up yonder when things look so dreary [Applause] here brother Steven when things when they look so dreary here he said there's always something going on in another world Hallelujah I didn't come from this world I don't belong to this world therefore this world it does not control my mood it

powerful but when are you going to walk through the door that it's opening for you to walk through so a prophet stood there and he preached okay here's the people here's the pulpit here's the prophet here's that Dimension and the devil is between him and that Dimension between that Dimension and him and the people is the devil and he's trying to put a block between them two but a prophet stands there yes sir and he says now I take every I'm paraphrase it here I take every Spirit under my control for the glory of God he stands there and says now do you believe me to be God's Prophet I'm telling you what you hear thousands of times on tape he'll say things like this do you know he's not here do you know he's right here not standing three foot from where I am do you know the same angel that was with Moses and Paul is right here he'll saying things like this come now lady come now my brother what was he doing he was preaching an entrance that's right he was cutting an entrance through the spirits and the atmospheres of unbelief and he was giving you access into a place where there is no clouds where there is no five inner and outer senses where it's only controlled by faith and he said now come follow me and people would come up on the platform and he would see this one lady and he would say now sis he would say oh I see what's wrong with you you've got a stomach trouble you can't hardly eat eat nothing you're in a bad condition what you eat makes you sick but go on your way God makes you well you're healed in Jesus name brother John she walked out with the same stomach trouble with the same acid problems a woman comes behind her brother I'm going somewhere comes behind her brother Steven a prophet looks at her and says oh I see your trouble you have a Gorder on your neck but praise God he makes you well you're healed in Jesus name go on your way praising him and the Gorder the stomach trouble is still there and the Gorder is still on the neck but you're healed the Gorder is still on the neck the stomach trouble is still there but the spoken word said you're healed the Gorder is still on your neck the stomach trouble is still there but the spoken word says you're [Applause] healed the gray hair is still there the stoop shoulders are still there the body aches are still there but the spoken word says you're already in a raptured [Applause] condition because it's the spoken word H so they leave and about two weeks later there's still stomach trouble still Gorder still all the problems but they're pressing pressing the word said I'm Healed the word that I'm delivered I don't need to find another healer I don't need to find another prayer line I don't need to find another healing campaign the word has already spoke over my situation I'm going to press into the reality of what the word said drink some coffee throw it up touch her neck Gord are still there but one morning but one morning it was a different morning brother Steven I'm not trying to make a new doctrine but can I say something maybe around 6 and [Applause] nine Maybe between 6:00 and 9 one morning she sent her kids off to school and she didn't think about anything and she grabbed a cup of orange juice and she drank it down and it stayed there she ate a piece of sausage and it stayed there she said well let's give it the acid test and she drank a cup of coffee and it stayed there you know what she said I'm Healed you know what she did she started praising God [Music] and she ran out of her house over to her neighbor's house and she busted through the door and you know what she said she said extra extra re and there was her friend in there and she was shaking the sheets she said what happened she said somewhere between 600 and 9 somewhere between about 6:00 and 9 this morning I I had Gorder on my neck but it fell off I'm looking for it what are you saying I'm saying their healing came as a direct result of the spoken word well I close on this spoken word Tabernacle spoken word I close on this the prophet stood there in the Rapture and he said there's going to be a bride and there's going to be a Rapture he said there's been three watches he said now here's what I believe is some morning between 6: and 9 there's going to come a change oh mercy there's going to come A [Applause] Change brother Steven there's going to come [Applause] a a sweep [Applause] can I say this to you can I say this to you it had to be preached the Rapture had to be preached and from 1965 to right here at nearly 2025 there's preachers still preaching it and there's Believers still pressing into [Applause] it do you know what the God says on that tape I know I'm slowing down but I'm doing it on purpose you know what he said on that tape can I can I can I tell you something can I tell you how powerful this Rapture is a prophet stands her on tape brother fby why preach you know what he says he says now I see that lady back there and she's want me to wrap up she's want me to close she wants the room they're wanting to clean it up he said but here I've got to finish this but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished I've got to finish it I was talking to a brother over in Tennessee he was actually in the Rapture sermon he said brother Andrew he said I was sitting there in the Rapture sermon watching brother B preach he said when he said that I turned and he said I saw the woman in the back corner he said she was stand there smoking a cigarette standing there in the in the in the ballroom smoking a cigarette while a prophet was preaching the Rapture trying to get him to quit preaching so they could clean up the banquet hall brother steveen I wondered I always wondered about that part I always wondered about that part when he said give her that offer and I've got to finish this and then brother Lunsford stands there and tells me brother Harvey Lunsford stands there and tells me that one day and I went back home and I sit down brother Steven and I started through the Rapture tape again and I said there's got to be a connection I said there's got to be a connection here and I got to reading it one day and all of a sudden he comes down there the end and he says this and now it has been spoken testing 1 two 3 and now it has been spoken and so shall it [Music] be I said oh my goodness it is the devil didn't want this spoken because he knows that in the early years of the ministry the prophet of God said things that are spoken of by God becomes realities and the devil knew if he could stop the speaking of the word that would produce the Rapture he could stop it from becoming a reality but a cigarette smoking backslid woman could not stop the prophet from speaking the word of rapture but I want to tell Leia tonight you cannot stop me from becoming the reality of the spoken word stand on your feet and give God praise it has been spoken it has been spoken and so shall it be come on musicians there's going to be a rapture [Applause] [Music] there's going to be a resurrection there's going to be a body change there's going to be a married supper of the [Music] Lamb the word of rapture has been spoken proen his word 64 and she will take the Rapture by the word says this in the Rapture see it's been spoken so shall it be heavens and earth will pass away but my words will never fail watch a prophet when he turns that in the end go listen to that Rapture tape when he turns in the end and he says these words he says now let there be light and let there be this he said see and as long as it went out of his mouth in a word as long as it went out of God's mouth in a word it has to be manifested it has to be devil it's too late it's already been spoken and there is a bride on the earth yes sir who is preaching what a prophet taught about the rapture and she's tuning her natural eye out of the picture and she's tuning her spiritual eye to God's word and she's believing things that are hard to believe but that's becoming literally fulfilled before her what are you saying brother Andrew the Propet of God said this he said the super sense is the holy spirit amen it's the faith of God that dwells in you and if you'll let the five senses be to the six sense it'll guide you and bring all the other five senses under the control of that super sense listen it makes you act where you do not think the five senses would ever think about can I can I dedicate this to the devil the devil can get into these five senses and lie to you but he cannot touch that super sense that's far beyond his reach that come from God it's called faith and faith is that great thing tonight friends I say this to you it has been spoken it has been spoken so shall it be hell can't stop it opposition can't stop it there is a word concerning this bride and she's going to manifest it can I say this to you tonight will you leave this service like those two women left that prayer line will you leave this service tonight like those two women left that prayer line it took two weeks for that promise to materialize it may be 10 more years before the Rapture takes place but some morning between 6:00 and 9 there's going to be a change it has been spoken it shall become it shall become a reality listen friends I believe it tonight with all of my heart somebody say this with me unseen things spoke of by God spoke of by God become realities you say well God is not here in a physical literal Corporal body speaking but his servants are and the Bible said ye are [Applause] gods in whom the word of the Lord comes to say what a prophet said you're preaching Vindicated word listen friends it's becoming real and there's nothing amen
