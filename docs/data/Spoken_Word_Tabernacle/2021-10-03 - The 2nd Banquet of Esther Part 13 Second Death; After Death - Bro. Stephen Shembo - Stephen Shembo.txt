praise reports um that you know before we um bring him up he's going to pray over the offering and everything in the remainder of the service when he comes up for his testimony so yes ma'am thank you in the car accident my truck my kids and i were driving lights came on the dash it just shut off i had to pull over to the side of the road gave it a minute started the truck back up luckily i was able to make it to like an auto parts store gentlemen looked at it we got it back home but we were like 45 minutes away from home so the lord got us all the way back home it sat there long story made short we took it to the dealer after the gentleman fixed it and replaced the alternator because that's what we thought it was kia looked over the truck um went last week and the gentleman at kia said you want the good news or the good news i said i want the good news because the lord had placed on my heart that it was the engine i said lord not the engine you know my husband's getting ready to leave it's just not the time we get there the guy says it was your engine he said but because it was under warranty you get a brand new engine so the lord blessed her amen amen yes ma'am i want to give god all the praise for all that he has done for me um i've been having some trouble to sleep but god has been so good to me that although with a little sleep he's given me the strength and i want to give him the praise because a day in this week i can't remember what day i had a rough night sleeping but finally i got up and when i wake up i was honor all the glory and all the praise that he could put a song in my heart through all the trials that we are going through hallelujah that's where his habitation is right and i pray anyone else come up brother um abel i have to give this testimony because i told the lord i would um but i wanted to give it wednesday but i didn't want to take up any more time when me and my wife got back from our trip that we took to tennessee we got home and i jumped in the shower and like a couple minutes later the water just stopped and i was like oh what's going on here so i go down and i check the breakers and the breakers on for the well i checked the valve and the valves open but our weld just shut down for some reason and i didn't know why so i got my electrical tester and i tested all the power going to the breaker box coming from the breaker box going to the well trying to see if i can figure out what was going on and there was power going down to the well there should the pump should have been working it wasn't so all signs pointed to the pump went bad and now nowadays the cheapest repair for a pump going bad is pulling it out putting a new one in and when i called a couple pump companies they said it would be 1 500 at least if not like 2 000 2500 and upwards of there depending how deep our pump is and i remember the guy i bought the house from my wife's dad he told me that's a very deep well so now i'm thinking oh this is gonna be a really costly repair if it's the pump but earlier on five ten years ago when i was younger i would get really like i would get an attitude about that kind of stuff like i got in a car accident and i'm like lord why do you do this to me why does this have to happen to me and the lord's been maturing me from that and the last time i got in an accident i just said lord i know you you got it in control i know i know you know what you're doing and that's been my approach now is like i'm not going to complain like god has done so much for me he's blessed me in so many ways i'm no longer going to complain i may not understand it but i'm just going to put it in his hands so i got on google and i looked up like how to make sure it's not my pump and i don't want to pay a pump company and then it not be my pump and i saw something on there that says that it could be the capacitor and if it's the capacitor if you hard wire straight from the breaker to the pump and it kicks on then you're good just get the capacitor repaired so i did that and i was like oh this is the answer this is what it is i did that and the pump didn't kick on and i'm like okay like now it's the pump so i call the pump company and ask them if they can come out and get a new one and i was the night before i was in the room with my wife and i was like you know i know god knows what he's doing i'm not going to have an attitude it looks like it's our pump we might be out of water for like close to a week depending on how deep it is and how long it takes them to pull it out and get a new one in and get it installed all that i was like but we got places we can go for water we'll just be positive i know god knows what he's doing i trust him all that and i go to work and the pump guy comes out day i called him he was able to come out which they're crazy busy but he was able to come out the day of and he said that he thinks it's my capacitor and he's going to change it and i was like well i already hardwired it and the pump wasn't kicking on so i it says it wasn't the capacitor he's like the newer pumps can't run without the capacitor he's like so if we replace your capacitor that might be the problem i was like okay go for it he did it was 250 dollars my pump's back on we got water to house i was like praise the lord hey amen [Applause] hallelujah i i got a small one i've been um i went two weeks last last month i usually get paid weekly i went two weeks due to taking a little bit of time off in a transition of jobs again without a paycheck but the lord listen brother kelly yeah my my decision okay um but i've been doing just wide open with side work and mowing grass and aerating and it's been more than plenty it's just covered every bit of it so he's good to us he just take care never a day you know i mean i'll eat beans if i have to but that day we go to speaking food into existence it ain't gonna be no beans it's gonna be me a steak okay but but the good lord yes sir you got something brother michael okay okay but he's been good to us hasn't he he'll provide he provides amen amen [Applause] god bless you saints i really really want to thank the lord this morning for his grace and his mercy you know when [Music] i work at the va too so i deal with a lot of ptsd and a lot of times when we hear the word ptsd we only think of military but uh i just realized that as nurses we have a lot of ptsd with what's going on right now so yesterday the lord did something very very marvelous for me and my patients i went to work and uh you know we all have our attitudes right when you hear somebody is an alcoholic and drug user and meth and all that and that person is sick because of in hepatitis and they are sick because of what they the lifestyle they have people usually have very you know attitudes so but i thank god because i look at the person and not what i've been told or the report that i've been given so i had this gentleman a young man actually literally dying his belly swollen his bleeding from everywhere the mother his mother basically just left him for dead didn't want to give any consent for anything and i'm like lord i don't want him to die on my hands please just let him leave until at least until the end of my shift and then my other patient was also pruned you know laying on the abdomen is a hefty lady about 300 pounds intubated just fighting for her life so these two so i was dancing between the two when i said dancing literally moving from one room to the other and didn't get breakfast until 1 30 pm breakfast ended up not having any lunch but anyhow what the lord did for me for this man was amazing and while i'm taking care of him the song that i was just constantly singing was what a friend we have in jesus and and the other song that i sang here when they were dedicating the church [Music] and and so right just before that the nurse before me had not given him his very very important medication that he needed to bring his ammonia down please bear with me because this is really when you know when somebody has liver cirrhosis they the ammonia level goes up and they they get obtained so for three i'm getting report and she's telling me that three doses they have not given him that ammonia and in my heart i was just like lord why and simply because they could not get that medication to him when they give it it was just coming out but i'm like lord there must be a way so i designed my own way of giving him that medication and it actually retained that medicine and the ammonia level went down a little bit but as i because i turned him to give the medication he could not tolerate it and his oxygen saturation went into the 60s and i'm like lord no don't don't let this happen and so of course they had to call the mother to get consent to intubate him the mother said no i thought he was dead and anyhow we ended up intubating this man and after that he was just pouring blood pouring blood pouring blood from all over i i just kept on praying i said lord just hold him just hold him let him not die on me i want to thank god that he did not die on my shift and my other patient the other lady also made it through my shift and so at the end of the day eight o'clock is when i was leaving work i was just beaten just beaten down so tired so then at night i cannot sleep because i'm so tired i can't sleep so this morning i wake up and i'm like look honey i just don't know i don't want to take the spirit of sleep to church i just don't know if i can go because one thing i hate doing is sleeping in church even though sometimes i do but i hate it i said no i'm going to church devil you're defeated and here i am i'm so energetic i really thank god for everything and then just before we leave i'm told oh mom is not doing well this and that and that i said devil you're a liar he's going to leave until when you're ready to take her so i thank god that through it all through it all we have made it and we are here and he's he's gracious thank you hallelujah [Applause] brother caleb come on up and um sister rosemary does he have a first name that young man okay well god knows who we're talking about i've got i've got a friend i'll bring up for prayer requests as well that's fine no that's fine god knows i mean we think they'll go for all the testimonies i mean they're just power heads the evil father lord jesus what an opportunity lord that you have given to us this morning lord just come into your house once more father lord to give you praise glory and honor jesus to commemorate your resurrection father god lord jesus our deepest prayer lord is our voice if you still dead or god in the heart of some lord may you reason again father god when you rise up lord jesus in the house of your children father god those who have lost their zeal lord may you restore this your lord for your love for god the love of the truth father god jesus and that's the reason why we're here lord you just to hear from you once more father lord prayed all that just come lord god and see the desire of your heart your children lord may every knee be mad father god we know in your word lord there's no one to ever come to your presence and return the same father jesus that's our deepest desire so you may change our hearts lord god change our lives lord let this world lord be a transformation as father god lord pray for the offerings and ties lord jesus may you bless each and every one of us who have brought something to your house lord god to obey your word and those who don't have anything for the god i mean you provide for them all so they can also be a blessing unto you father god jesus take control of the whole service father lord jesus we always remember oh brother making his family father lord jesus may you comfort them oh god because you are the great comforter father lord jesus come and just take control of the whole service lord bless us lord jesus speak to our hearts lord god lord may you move the past on the side lord we wouldn't come here lord to hear men speaking father lord we didn't even come from home nor draw father god to come here man father because the word of a man is a lie before he can even speak your father but one word from you lord makes all the difference oh jesus just come lord father and let us lord rejoice in your spirit lord in your presence father god father who the father has set free is free indeed lord jesus let us be free this morning father god come lord jesus come father god may you consume lord every spirit father god that's against your word all this spirit of tiredness love sleepiness lord slumber father god spirit of unbelief oh follow me you consume all of them in jesus christ's name lord father come and take preeminence in jesus name we pray amen man you may have your seats testimony because we didn't even ask for them sorry about that don't care about it um do you have a testimony i was trying to keep it short but it's a long one but i just hope it would encourage somebody here this morning i don't know where to begin um yeah man god is good man god is good man um this year started out very very difficult for me unexpected um basically i was just seeing my life crumble before my eyes it felt like i was just falling apart but in case i was falling into place um my brother's brother edward said god do things that we don't understand and um but we just trust in him and so every the beginning of the year was hard i my faith was tested i lost my job back in at the end of march and so from march up until the end of august i didn't i didn't have a job and things got really really hard complicated one thing is after the other everything was just falling apart not working as as it's supposed to um but in all that there was still just something in me that just wouldn't give up um the devil will come and i have really mind battle this year really really tough tough time wouldn't sleep and i was just walking as a zombie and i couldn't sleep i spent days weeks had barely any sleep and in all that still i couldn't just give up and just walk away i just couldn't and though i would think about it but it just wouldn't make sense to me and then you know with the preaching i get to understand well that's my origin i mean um the way i was built you know was just to hold on and um so i didn't have a job i started applying elsewhere and the job that i would get it will just be something that i don't want to do so i was like lord i don't want to do this i don't want to do this one they will call me have an interview but something new won't just you know not this one you're not here but i do need a job lord give me a job but then i will apply they will call and i will you know just not this one and i would i would go places the low just tell me no not this one not this one and then i found this other job basically um it's life insurance i've been into the insurance industry industry i'm sorry and basically on this company you you are as independent agent you're working for yourself you represent the company but you're still working for yourself and once i found that i talked to the manager they just like me they were impressive my resume and interview and all that and the lord said this is it this is what you're gonna do but you know that i didn't have life insurance life insurance license so i had to get the course take the license go to the state take the exam and from there move forward so i took the course and it was time to go to the state to take the exam you give five attempts after five attempt if you fail you gotta take the course again so i went to the texan center first attempt failed second attempt failed third attempt to fail fourth failed load fifth i failed so i had again take the course again to the course again went back for the sixth attempt failed okay um i was like lord i know you said this everything else that you said everything else where you lead me it brought me to this this will be my seventh attempt and i'm about to pray for the seventh time and but i say lord before i take this test i'm just gonna take your word and give it back to you we're living in a seven seven inch the seven seals have been opened seven thunders the seven trumpet you send the seven messenger and you send them for me and seven is my favorite number do not let me pass c7 i went and took the test seven attempt i passed and after i passed now it's going out the next step which will be i gotta go get my finger printed after your fingerprinting at the sheriff's office they gotta send your fingerprint to the fbi they gotta go through the uh background check with the fbi which another process you got to pay for the application for the state to approve your license um so a whole another few weeks waiting going through back and forth so um i called the state just something you know i just wanted to take a shortcut so it's like let me just call the state to make sure that i'm doing what i'm supposed to be doing so i called this day without me going to take my fingerprint just to make sure so i called the state and the lady that i was speaking with um since i already had my other uh insurance for auto at home um still this is a different lesson so you gotta do the same thing so i called the lady and then was speaking i told her you know what's the next step for me and then she was like okay let me look you up and i should look me up she say you don't need to do anything else i said no i do need to take my fingerprint pay the feed do all that she said no caleb your license will be approved in next 24 hours so the next 24 hours i didn't pay nothing and that's the law but i just thank the lord because in my case he had to bypass the law and i'm just grateful and i'm just really really grateful to to to the lord because of things that i've went through some of the brothers here know what i'm talking about um that it wasn't me who kept myself you know times i didn't have a job it wasn't my saving account that kept me it wasn't it wasn't it was none of that it was the lord who kept me and i'm just grateful for him because to all that i went through i'm thankful for it because he has created character in me and um just want to say to you doesn't matter what you're going through um as hard as it can be um standing here as a living testimony of god as well and he keeps his word if you believe and you hold on just hold on man god bless you [Applause] i want to say something on behalf of i didn't know any of this was going on but to me reach out a little bit we love brother caleb okay if you need i don't know if you needed any help okay but there there is very few people

richly richly bless you and we trust that it will be a blessing for each one of us amen everybody is already informed about brother miki about the departure if i can call it that way the departure because she went into the presence of the lord it's a departure of our lovely precious sister amen lord's willing she will be her body not her because she is in the presence of the lord her body will be buried on friday but we know our sister is no longer there she's enjoying with the saints with brother branham and everybody else and probably now she's screaming pastor keep pressing on amen amen blessed be the name of the lord so she they will bury her body on a friday lord's willing brother mickey traveled there with a few members of the family and lords willing as soon as the finish probably less than a week he'll be back here so we're kind of working on having like a little tiny reception where everybody can be there and just share something and just probably share a few testimony and just have a time with a family so keep them in prayer so the lord will protect them and they can come back here easily without any problem amen and matter of fact brother miki is online streaming [Laughter] so when you say a man he's there i saw him saying amen amen amen so he's already hooked online but god's grace amen so they will make it by tomorrow so everything will be all right amen how many are up to date with the sermon now this number are increasing how many are up to date with the sermon so right there okay blessed be the name of the lord and how many are going with the cod book okay okay catch up please catch up please just one question a day not much amen let's go straight to our scripture the devil have been fighting me with this computer everything was working fine until i got here then the projector and the computer and this this but we got it genesis chapter 19. this is where we stopped before we got the region of galleria so you know how to create your atmosphere if you don't want devil you know in your house you know what to do amen except if you want to decorate your house with halloween and stuff then you're welcoming those devils there amen so you don't want no devils in your house you know what to do if he stop bothering you tell him you're going to listen to brother brother if you stick around here you're going to hear me praying you're going to hear me blessing the lord you're going to heal me praising the lord so just stick around and me and you're going to worship amen amen and you're going to see how long he's going to stay there worshiping because god inhabits the praises of his children so when one come the other one must go out when you turn the light on all the cockroaches and everything else must run away so if you don't want to cockroaches turn the light on you want to stick stick around and we're going to praise the lord amen you stay in that atmosphere you're going to avoid a lot of headache when you meet people you begin to talk to them you like in a different world did you see what happened in your news i didn't watch it what were you doing i was reading a bible i was listening to the tape so so did you what what kind of world are you living in yes that's a different word where there is no high blood pressure no tension no trouble no sorrow no sickness even though i'm not yet in the presence of the lord but in a strange land i can live like a prince it's a matter of choice amen blessed be the name of the lord genesis 19 24. jesus said there was a burning hair there was a hell with fire by the bottom say there's no burning hair did anybody got the answer okay somebody got the answer i need money to give him a microphone [Laughter] amen genesis 19 verse 24 then the lord not anybody else it's god who did it then the lord reign you remember this right reign upon sodom and gomorrah what and what you might be seated upon sodom and go and gomorrah we know what happened in those city right wicked wicked city god's reigns what fire and brimstone what's wrong with fire and know what's wrong with brimstone the lord rained fire and brimstone from the lord out of heaven so they came out of heaven and he overthrew those cities and all the plants and all then he had the inhabitant of the cities and that which grew upon the ground so not only was sodom and gomorrah destroy but there were other cities around amen so the lord destroyed everything the houses the people the the grass everything else was burned completely amen burn completely let me drop down to it's not on my reading but let me drop down since it came on verse 27 and abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the lord and he looked towards sodom and gomorrah and toward all the land of the plan remember lot went there he never seen that destruction before be careful what you choose and be held and low the water the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of water so somebody was really burning there until it causes smoke everybody let's go to luke chapter 16. we were this could not touch it when we went into hell by the scripture nobody will go to hell again i am not going to hell my origin my origin came from up there i came from god i'm going back up to god amen luke chapter 16 verse 22. amen and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by angels into the bosom of abraham the rich men also did water and was water so death happened to both of them so the first step which we know it's the first death we already talked about this which happened in the physical it happened to everybody even though some will not die we have a promise of that it happened to christians just like it happened to our sister and it happened also to sinners amen the problem is not here this is no problem amen the problem is after you die amen in other words if a sinner can died in a car wreck and a christian also can die in a car wreck that's not a problem the problem is what happened after death one was carried by angels you see the difference and another one he was buried amen both of them both of their body were buried both bodies will be destroyed but what he's after that's the problem amen [Music] and inhale now inhale and inhale he lift up his eyes being in water did he say he was burning being in torment and see her and sees abraham a far off and lazarus in his bosom and he cried and said father abraham so he knew abraham and he called him father because the jews told jesus christ our father is abraham amen so this is a jew this is a jew when he went there he recognizes their father abraham when you go there you're not going to see abraham amen okay you're going to meet also somebody there and you're going to call him our precious brother you swallow that and he cry and say father abraham have mercy on me and send lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water in water and cool my water he didn't say cool my feet or cool my head he's more worried about the tongue so the most one that got more torture in hell is the tongue why life and death in the power of water i don't like you [Music] i'm sick and tired of this i feel sick [Music] amen and comb my water my tongue for i am burning in this flame i'm water so the flame in here are not burning they are tormenting amen was very random wrong was jesus wrong amen verse 25 but abraham say son remember that you in your lifetime receive your good things and lazarus and likewise lazarus evil things but now he's comforted and you are burning you are tormented everybody clear let's go now to revelation chapter 14. sodom gomorrah and the cities iran destroyed by fire and brimstone that happened in the natural and it created smoke everybody clear in a natural hell also have smoke but it's a different kind of smoke amen hell i got smoke but it's a different kind of smoke amen let me help you up because somebody is probably thinking go to revelation 9. don't want to say pastor say it's a different smoke amen let's go to revelation 9. you took my time i didn't whine so you complete the remaining revelation nine verse one and the fifth angel sounded and i saw a star did what it's a fallen and a star a fallen angel how did you fall from heaven oh you understand that style now star fall from heaven to the earth and to him was given the key of the bottomless water that's his chamber that's his property he can go there we don't have any problem and he opened the bottomless pit his new residency they built him that very good made sure they got homeowner association down there and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a water a smoke out of the water so something is burning really i thought brother stephen you say those flames are just tormenting they're not burning so where does the smoke come from watch that smoke and there eros a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great water when sodom and gomorrah was destroyed it was like the smoke of the water amen are we okay okay stay awake and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit the smoke of hair so it's fire let's see watch verse 3 and there came out of water water we know those locusts right we dealt with them in living world probably we might review them came locust upon the earth and to them was given power as the scorpion of the earth have power and he was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only those men which have not the seal of god in their water only the people that do not have the holy ghost verse seven and the shape of the lokis were like the horse like two horses prepare for battle and on their heads whereas he were clowns like gold and their faces were as the faces of water what kind of creature is that one look like a locust and then a man and if you continue verse 9 and they had breastplate as he wear the bracelet of iron and the sound of the wings as was as the sound of chariot of many horses running to battle and that and the head tear like to scorpion and them and there were stings in their tail and they had power and their power was to hurt men five months those were demon anybody clear so the smoke of hell brings demon it's not like the natural smoke we clear now let's go to revelation 14 then we're going to pray so sodom gomorrah city is destroyed by fire and brimstone amen on the first death everybody if you were a candidate in the book of life to die it's going to happen to you that's not a big deal it's just a baggy what happened after death that's the problem revelation chapter 14 let's go to verse 9. if you're there you can say amen and the third angel you know who that angel is follow them saying with a loud voice if any man worship who the best in his image so that must be in the end time where the beast and the image revelation number uh chapter 13 is and receive his mark in his forehead we're talking about the mark of the beast end time or in his hand the same shall drink of the wine of the ruffleful the wrath of god now he's a lion he's no more lamb which is poured out with that mixture into the cup of his indignation his anger and he shall be water he shall be burning he must be he shall be tormented with water and water the fire of sodom and gomorrah was burning because he was in the natural that was a burning fire ever clear but this fire that comes from god and the brimstone that comes from god dab fire and brimstone does not burn it torments am i reading a different bible this one torment why is this one burning and this one tormenting this one affects the body amen but when you die your body stay in the grave what goes out is not your body what goes out is the soul or the spirit you cannot take natural fire to burn a spirit if it was like that i will put fire all around my house and no demon will come around so demon don't care about your cookout you can put your cook out he doesn't scare devil you must have a different fire brother robert we might need to put a picture of that over there you must have a different fire that torment demon hallelujah and he shall be tormented with fire verse 10 and brimstone in the presence of the holy angel the elected one and in the presence of the lamb and the water you see another smoke again and the smoke of their torment not the smoke of their flame did you read that correctly the bible didn't say they smoke off their flame the smoke of the flame that's in the natural upon sodom and gomorrah in the cities but this is the smoke of the torment so this torment here created smoke they smoke off their torment who want to go back to hell again they smoke off their torment ascended up forever and ever and they have no water if you notice when this fire and brimstone are tormenting there is a smoke that goes with it because the people over here have no water keep that in mind there's no rest somebody else get rest is it okay okay you must make sure you enhanced right here before your killing happened you remember many of them the lord was not pleased and they didn't enter into his waters you remember that's why the restless over there you remember no more rest over there so you make sure you're in rest right here because if you're not in rest like sister gene good luck you will never see her matter of fact she will be watching you one day burning amen they have no rest day nor night who worship the beast and his image and whosoever receives the mark of his name verse 12 and here is the water the patience of who here are they that keep the commandment of who and the water the faith of water what does the faith of jesus do to you what does that revelation of jesus christ do to you it brings rest so be patient amen blessed be the name of the lord verse 13 and i heard a voice from heaven saying to me right blessed are the who which die in the water so if somebody dies in the lord the bible say his water amen let me repeat it again if somebody died in the lord the bible say his water why are they blessed when we moon so sister jin today she is blessed you are the one struggling here over there she doesn't struggle anymore there is no heart attack there there is no tension there there is no heart failure there everything is perfect [Applause] [Music] if they put you there you won't want to come back here because he ate many air conditioning for devils nothing entered there only perfect love amen blessed are the dead which die in the lord from hereafter yea says the spirit died they may water from there and their words do water let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us and strengthening this church and particularly the family lord thank you for giving us another opportunity to gather together around the revealed word of the hour father we have done what any man that you have given grace and ability to do can do but up to now it takes the holy spirit to come and speak to your children and father quicken those that need to be quickened and bring lord father those souls that came from thee back again in order through the works of redemption so that they can be reconciled with you father lord be the alpha and the omega of this service move me completely out of the way and may you speak to your children may the devil and his army be completely sealed out of this place may the holy fire of the peter of fire be lord father uh granted to your children and may your presence feel this place in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you you've already been seated we continue with the second banquet of esther part 13 we're dealing with the second death now lord's willing we're going to enter the lake of fire amen when we were talking about the origin we started from heaven and something happened in heaven a rebellion happened in heaven from lucifer and the two kingdom were separated they used to live together when they were under the jurisdiction of god amen and god put them under free moral agency you remember that question and answer and then from there the two kingdoms split and one kingdom was put down amen all the way and it created three places that's why the bible say in heaven on the earth and and underneath the earth everybody clear so no one was worthy in the earth in the heaven no one was worthy on the earth and no one was worthy under the earth everybody cared so far so when they were thrown into the into hell we called them or the scripture called them wandering stars and jude says that they are spot in your feast of charity so where the children of god are sitting in love everything is doing good watch out for somebody to always cause trouble but i'm saying when the disciple was sitting in the boat feasting upon the meeting that jesus christ have brother branham said there was one disciple who was at the corner there having a bad attitude his name was judas amen they are spot in your feast of charity because the holy spirit brings love of god in your heart that's what the scriptures say when they feast with you when they are in church with you feeding themselves without fear there is no respect they don't care about who you are whether you are christian or not they behave any kind of way that's why paul say many are sick and many are afflicted because they're not discerning the body of the lord the body of the lord is not a warfare of communion the body of the lord is the bride of jesus christ which is the church of the living god amen they are cloud they are without water the bible didn't say cloud without rain check your scripture the bible say cloud without water when we talk about cloud we usually talk about rain but the bible is specific and say it's cloud without water and we know water represents water it represents the world by the washing of the water by the word amen jesus told nicodemus except a man be born of water of water and water and the spirit the word and the spirit which gives you the anointed word so these are clouds with that word so when you try to find a comfort among these people they don't have no word their fellowship have no word if you sit around them there is no word you cannot hear them talking about i was listening to a tape this week or i was reading something in the bible sister make sure the one you talk to have a word make sure your friend have water make sure they want you spend time with them at work it's a cloud that have water somebody that you can fellowship with them around the world of god until when you separate yourself you learn something you go if you can depress you leaving that person charged like it was good to talk to that person i was feeling depressed i was down but when i talked to sister so and so she encourages me she gave me scripture she talked to me until the holy ghost job and we begin to pray with her cloud with water stay away from clouds that don't have water make sure your friend your colleague your associate got water we cannot talk three hours without water everybody here that which young ruler in hell was looking for water to call his tongue everybody but they can't give it to him in hell it was too late so when i meet with you bring me water [Applause] jesus said if you give a glass of water so it's universal you don't have to have money to buy soda everybody can get water so not only water in the natural because men shall not live by bread alone but by every water make sure and when we spend time on the phone bring me some order [Applause] anybody care everybody here don't tell me about politics there is a bunch of lies there don't tell me about facebook i don't care what they're doing in different churches in the message i don't care who fell who slept with a woman that's not my problem i'm looking at my life how i can make it to heaven [Applause] cloud without water a bite of water every single strap in the message they there every problem they know universal the cnn you want to know something in the message get with them they're going to tell you everything internationally trees use water fruit to do what because there is no water fruit weather because there is no water without water twice what when you are born in this world we are born in sin shaping iniquity coming into this your world speaking water so we are dead to begin with amen but when we receive jesus christ now we are quickened from the dead but somebody is dead naturally and dead spiritually they are twice dead or double death [Applause] [Music] planted by water no life raging wave of the sea forming their own water sit down with them they only talk about themselves i think these are the these are the these are the these are the these are the these are the disadvantages amen wandering stars to whom is reserve the water the blackness and darkness for water that is the oppression everybody cares so far now when we talk about ii peter the bible says that for if god spare not the angels that sin but cuts them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto water that is the jail everybody here verse 6 and turning the cities of sodom and gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow making them an example unto those that after should leave hell there is three things that goes with the scripture number one this scripture point out the natural life everybody clear of the seed of this of satan everybody then the second one it speaks about their origin and what happened to them ever clear when they die they go into chains of darkness to be reserved for judgment everybody and the third thing the bible is pulling the example of sodom and gomorrah to show you their faith or their destination which is speaking about their destruction everybody here from origin they had a beginning and they must have an end about here so when they come into this world they're going to be living normal just like you like the rich young ruler everybody and after that you will find out that they are going to reject the word and the reason why they are rejecting the word is not good news it is something they did already before the foundation of the world because they never stuck with michael which was crushed anybody clear so when they die they go into chains of darkness and jude is telling you that they don't stop there this is just a temporary judgment about here now jude is pulling peter and jude both are pulling the example of sodom and gomorrah to show you that a man that doesn't receive god a man that dies as a sinner he's going first into hell then later on he's going to be destroyed anybody clear so jude says the angel which kept not their first state going to origin but left their own habitation he has reserved into everlasting water under darkness unto the judgment of the great now they died they're going to hell now jude continued just like peter he said even as sodom and gomorrah and the cities about them in like manner giving themselves over to water if you fornicate you better clean up quickly because you're a candidate to hell and going after water homosexual to hell i set forth for a water example suffering the water the vengeance of eternal in other words naturally after they die then what happened at the end everybody clear so far blessed be the name of the lord let's keep climbing the bible said in the book of luke 12 that and i said unto you my friend be not afraid of them which do water so the killing of the body which is the first death here happened to everybody jesus said do not be afraid of that one that's not the problem because i am the resurrection anybody here no problem he says kill the body and after that have no more that they can do because we if you remember brother branham explained to us that the devil's power stop at death that's it anybody here so everything satan can do to you stop right here a death but what follow after death but i will forewarn you whom you shall feel feel him which after he has done what has power to cast in water so somebody after their death will be cast into hell matthew chapter 10 verse 8 and fear not them which killed the body everybody clear but i'm not able to kill the water so there is also a killing of the soul so when you die your soul is not dead yet your soul is still alive and you're going to go somewhere depending on your life right here which is based upon your origin everybody clear but there will come a time that they're going to destroy a soul [Music] everybody but rather feel him which is able to do water to destroy both water and the water in water question does the body goes to hell did the body of the witch young mullet went to hell that hell is not here okay if you look at a different translation brother michael it is called water it's called gehenna which is speaking of the lake of fire everybody here hell only received the soul and the spirit not the body but the lake of fire received both are we okay stay alert we're moving up everybody here the bible said job say my flesh is clothed with worm put your seat belt and of dust my skin is broken and become lovesome job 19 he said and go after my skin worm not somebody else chemo anybody so the body that we have here job is saying that they are made of worms anybody clear that's why job called them my skin worms in other words you have yours i have mine that's why it's yours and it's mine it belongs to you anybody my skin once destroy water so the skin worm only destroys the body not the soul i'm going slowly yet in my water shall i see what if your body is destroyed job how can you see god again in that body in other words job is telling you i'm going to rise up again in the same body [Music] ever here because lazarus also died and the bible said he stunk amen but when jesus called lazarus out that same body revived back again and the stinking was taken away amen hallelujah whom i shall see for who it is my scheme work it is my body and i'm gonna see it myself personally i'm not going to include you you include yourself anybody here and my mom shall behold and not what it's my personal revelation don't my reign be consumed within me brother when i'm explaining this he says you know skinned worms don't come to you where did he get it where did brother branham learn it did he give you a bible scripture you see where it comes from from job he said the skin worms don't come to you that worm is already where your own skin worms did you ever notice that put you in a coffin and put it air tight the bags will eat you up just the same because they are you are just a bunch of water to begin with from the inside why are we proud [Music] you are proud of what what you call beauty it is just a bunch of bags i don't want somebody to talk to me like this [Applause] a baggage of women if death struck you that said you're going to see them activated be humble love one another cherish one another [Applause] okay your suit is 600 somebody have a twenty dollar suit just be humble don't think you are greater than them because at death we are gonna receive the same [Applause] treatment everybody clear those skin worms my skin won't destroy me my flesh yet in my flesh i shall see water these skin rooms have a beginning and they also have an end everybody clear the skin worm is a nodal destruction software that is loaded in your body when you are born that's after your time is finishing this earth because your body came from the earth the skin one man activated they destroy everything and when they finish they themselves die [Music] it's a software but i'm gonna show you how you block that software there is a way to block that software and it will never be activated [Applause] you gonna know about it only on the court but you will never experience it because not everybody will die [Applause] everybody here so somebody have a software but they have a manager password that they can bypass the software [Applause] [Music] i hope you're getting what i'm saying who's not using a computer here praise be the name of the lord everybody here so this skin worm had a beginning and they also have an end blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah the bible says in colossians that having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile water unto himself by he must say whether there be things on thee or things water anybody here therefore being justified by water remember they sent the resting patient those that have the faith in jesus christ you remember being justified by water we have water peace with god through our water so when you receive christ in your life everybody you technically receive peace and rest to your soul do you follow me do you follow me if you die are you following me the skin worm will be activated to destroy your body only ever here but your soul is preserved into god never to be destroyed again hallelujah matthew 11 take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lonely in heart and you shall find water for your water why do you need rest for your soul i thought you want to rest also in the body everybody here but christ is talking about the rest of the soul what is wrong with this rest of the soul watch it ever clear that's why the scripture says precious in the sight of what not in your sight because we're grieving unless you have the revelation or the mind of christ precious in the sight of the lord is the death of water because the saints have made peace with god so when you die the god of peace is waiting for you at the river when you crossing that river he's picking you up say come home little child come home heal the children and when you look you're gonna remember you say oh i see songs over there and they are cheering you like come on you made it [Applause] why because you made peace with god [Applause] hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord now the word death means water when we die this way our physical death does not mean that we are dead jesus said he thou do what do you wear water yet you shall water who serve and live and believe from me shall never that death speaking of here is water from the presence of water but the physical death that we have to go through here yet it is not death we are still in the presence of whom we move from this place to a water to water in his water so sister jean is more closer to god than you hallelujah it is not the death that we call death what we call it here remember he says the girl that died giulia's daughter she's not but water everybody clear so far this doesn't happen to everybody tighten up now you see the christian when he dies he goes water under the altar of god right into the presence of who under the altair he is a dwarter because he made peace with god and if you have not made peace with god in this church make sure you make peace today because you don't know what's going to happen next you ready let's switch you understand what happened to the christian check what happened to the sinner you ready to break it down when a man has a nightmare he's not all together what neither you see what but the bottom is using two terminology one asleep can i get this one asleep and another one awake we have a sleep and awake anybody care who sleeps who is awake you ready he is between water and what so brother branham is saying when you are sleeping it's okay when you are awake it's okay the problem is when you are in between sleep and awake right here that's your problem why is it a problem brother problem say he is between sleep and awake and that is what makes makes him have a water a horrible shaking and screaming because he's not asleep about here he's not water so when you are not sleeping neither are you at work you drop in a nightmare what does it mean hallelujah and to take that that example shows where a man goes when he died unconverted [Music] he's he's leave his time up he's dead on what and he cannot go into the presence of who because he's not fit to go there without the and he is what he's caught and he cannot come back to the earth because his time is finished here on earth and he's cut between he's in the water a man that is a work is a man that is living yet a man that slippeth is a christian that have died amen when a sinner dies his time of living is finished but here he cannot go back to the presence of god by sleeping that's why jesus said lazarus is not dead but he does water because christians sleep but sinners stay between sleep where the christian is and they work where the people are still living on the earth they are caught between and they live in a nightmare which is called the fifth dimension that's why when a sinner is about to die they begin to scream i'm lost i'm lost i'm lost i'm lost i'm lost because his time is finished here he can't go into the presence of the lord then he's caught that catching of that sinner is he's just telling you he just enter another dimension everybody he cannot come back to the earth because his time is finishing on earth and he's cut between and he's in a nightmare he can't go in the presence of god to do what because he never made peace with god ever here and he can come back to the earth because his time is up he's in a nightmare and there he stays until the day of water a horrible thing to be in the chain of darkness it's a nightmare a place without order a horrible place that even demon themselves they don't want to go there don't let that be to us this is our visitation time let's remember christ that he's the same yesterday today and forever hebrew 38 don't wait till some regency under amen in the damn in the dimension where you cannot go in the presence of god and your time is up on the earth in the nightmare of horror you shall remember you had your opportunity and turn it away let the young people take notice to this let all take notice to this make sure you have peace with god so when you die if it happened to you are you doing you are sleeping that's why christians die peacefully because god rocked them slowly because he took the sting of death away and you go out slowly if you don't have peace with god you're gonna be caught into the fifth dimension screaming forever until we come and deal with you and the white throne judgment everybody clear so far why did you talk about all these worms and stuff mark 9 verse 43 we're talking about the sinner and if the hand of fendi do what it is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having water to go into water into the water the nerve shall be water so hell got fire everybody here hair contained fire what else contained hell where there water [Applause] are we okay open your bible open that scripture i don't want you to say he he he was the one that put it up there so his bible is different than my bible open your bible i thought the worm had a beginning and they also have an end when they finish their job the software have auto destruction they destroy and they destroy also themselves in other words they kamikaze themselves everybody here they can't go without finishing with you they finish you then they finish themselves and everybody i mean everything is dust back again go mark man can we read it together okay if the hand of fendi cut it off it is better for d to enter into life maim without that finger that click pornography than having two hands to go into water into the we got fire in the hell that never shall be 44 where the water is he written like that on your bible so we got warm in hell worm job said they are built in your body everybody you have them that's why job said masking worm and when they destroy you they also destroy themselves but right here jesus is talking about different worms and jesus also say dare worm [Music] anybody care just like you have your skin worm you also have your different worm you follow me just like your body have worm anybody care they saw also have a different type of your worm am i reading a different bubble tighten up everybody here where the worm diet dieth not because they're dealing with the soul and the spirit and the fire is not water isaiah 66 and they shall go forth and look upon the water of the men that have done what transgress against me for they shall not water neither shall there be water and there shall be enough boring unto all flesh what is going on the sinners in zion are afraid the people that are in the message playing around they are afraid fearfulness has to pass the water don't waste your time being a hypocrite you're going to pay a lot of and suffer a lot just be genuine who among us shall dwell with the devourer fire who among us shall do with everlasting burning we know our god is a consuming fire who can dwell with god now we found out that the worm are in hell and the worm in hell don't die but what goes in hell is not the body it is the soul that goes to hell what is that worm that you have anybody clear you ready jesus in matthew 24 say as the death speak jesus stood himself in the midst of them after the resurrection and say unto them peace be unto you but they were terrified and frightened and supposed that they had seen water when they saw jesus resurrected they said are you already dead this is a ghost this is a spirit jesus taught them it is me i am body they say you are a spirit and he said unto them why are you troubled and why do your thoughts arise in your heart behold my hand and my feet that is i i myself handle me and see for a water has not water and not water so if a worm is in hell what are they eating because what goes in hell is a spirit in the body they're eating up their body in hell what are they eating as you see me and when he has that spoken he showed them his hand and his feet and while they yet believe not for joy and wonder a mixture he said unto them have ye hear meat any meat and they gave him a piece of boiled fish and of honeycomb and he took it and did it and me no look there is an else car here it's a soul doesn't have scar look right here i don't know give me food you have a hamburger there give it to me spirit don't eat it's me ah okay okay okay touch him like this okay it's him bring a scissor everybody clear everybody clear so what is going on with that worm but upon him in the uncertain son he say there was a woman that was a christian and a woman backslid and begin to go wrong and if i'm not mistaken went left her husband took another husband and keep moving and keep moving and keep moving and she was working in the sunday school and everything and they told the woman she didn't listen until the woman got sick and that woman had a preacher and her pastor was smoking and the person loved her because she could work a lot she could do a lot of stuff in church so they say oh that's a scent that's a good question and everything she got sick she went to the hospital when she got into the hospital she was about to die all that time she was a sent all the people praying in the church everybody says she's a good sister lovely sister she cooked for us she do this she come to visit you she does this this this yet they didn't know what was going on anybody care after a while death began to come you follow me when death came death was coming to take her out from her body into her destination and to activate the skin worm to start destroying her body anybody clear when death approaches her she was telling people that she was a christian she was confessing to be a christian but when death came her children rose [Music] the inside man got two of you you have the spirit and you have the soul anybody care usually we fool ourself a lot in the spirit anybody care the spirit usually tells you you're okay that person should not have played with you like that yeah you gave it

lord brother problem say the judgment is not now there is no burning hell now somebody tell you the guy is burning hell now that is wrong a judge of this earth is just enough to never condemn a man until he's brought to water and god will never throw a man into a fire furnace until he first is water condemned by god's own law he rejected mercy so you see he first has to have a trial and the trial is the great white throne but now he's in the place called water where his worm is constantly constantly constantly have you seen your husband doing something wrong and you come and you tell him you did something wrong like this he said yes i understand i'm sorry and you come back again that's why that's why i'm going like this and you come back again you see you did what you did you're going to see him come on i already asked you forgiveness what else because he begins to torment him he begins to torment him you go there you start washing dishes yeah yeah that's why that's why every day

everybody over there on the same page gather off it every man according to his water [Music] so if you ate two slices fine if i eat one fine one can eat a half as long as you don't go over your size then it's a sin a number for every man according to the number of your person take you every man for them which are in that in his tent and the children of israel did so and god is somewhat somewhat depending on your size whether you have two children one children five children no problem everybody and the children of israel did so and gathered some more some less verse 18 and when they did meet in other words they measure they did measure it with a number he that gathereth much has nothing over and he that got a leader as no they gather every man according to his what about here and moses said let no man leave it leave your feet till there in other words when you get it it's your portion when you eat it's supposed to take care of you the entire day don't keep it till the next day verse 9 20. not withstanding they did water their heart came not to moses but some of them left prophet until there and he bred what where did the worm come from murder the worm eating worms indeed water and stunk and moses was angry with them verse 21 and they gather it every morning every man according to his eating and when the sun was hot he did what and he came to pass that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread two armors for one man and all the ruler of the congregation came and told moses everybody and he said this is that which the lord has said tomorrow is the water the rest of the holy sabbath to the lord back which that which you will break today and sith to you and and see if that you you will see and that which remain over lay up for you to be kept until what and they laid it up till the morning as moses bid and he did not water neither was there any water the same manner was jumping anybody here you eat it that's it you keep it the next day or to destruction you must have it fresh every day you take it on the first day you take it on the second day you take it on the third day you take it on the fourth day you take it on the fifth day you take it on the sixth

close here and moses said to aaron take a water and put a water full of water armor was the size for one person right now he said take one plate golden plate put the size of how many person one person an armor full of mana and lay it before who to be kept for what [Music] the manner that god told moses here god said take the manner the same manner that fell on the ground everybody if everybody keep

should not have done that you need to go ask him forgiveness you continue he grieve you again he grieve you again until you try to pump up like i'm good i'm good after a while after her because he takes care of your parasympathetic system i'm finishing there is a sympathetic system which they call the fight and fly and there is a parasympathetic same pattern you see something you act you go you run because you're awake it's your brain do you control your breathing it is somebody else that take care of them you just keep moving but your building is going that's a parasympathetic it is not you

tension tension tension tension tension the sugar goes up in everything and the pump medication look the man over there put him back in order you're going to see the sugar dropping are you there

again father for your grace for your love and for your mercy father thank you for opening the way of redemption that the chasm that was between the very gulf that was separating you from us lord you came down and you breach it lord and now man can live now from this earth no more to go down to paradise but to go straight into that presence where our precious sister is now sitting lord father we still have our time here we don't know who's going to stay we don't know who's going to be next but we know one thing that if we can make peace with you we don't care what's going to happen on tomorrow because we know that the end not only are we going to stay in your presence but we will come back again and to live on this earth in the same body that we left off father you're going to pull all those adam together and that one will never have a software of auto destruction because that one will stay forever lord you spoke to your children about their associate where they want to make sure they stay with friends with people where they can fellowship around the things of the world father around clouds that have water and if they have one that doesn't have water may they be that cloud of water that can be the one giving water to somebody else because this earth the people are thirsting like a dry land father they're looking for water to change lord father the ground oh god if there is some that slack on little point here and there about the christian life maybe that soul was speaking saying it's time to pray but that movie is still pulling maybe father that soul was saying remember we got service tomorrow but it's that friend that is calling that party that uh uh or going out that this and that something is stepping between them trying to block their growth and their christian life lord until further the the the voice of the soul becomes so dim and they can't even hear it no more lord may you be merciful as they're still holding the breath of life and father the thread of life has been catched yet that they can be awakened by the power of the holy spirit and check and realize and examine their life to make sure they in line with you lord father many times we are driven our life with our brain with what we think we acquire we acquire in school with our knowledge with our personality what society breathed and built into us and we thought that was the man that can accomplish something in this world and father many times we find ourselves in total failure where we beat against the wall but you never leave us you come always on time to show us that i'm always there if you can let me have your life i can take you into depth that you've never seen before and father if there is anybody here that is still struggling with their life they have not made peace with you that are still living a life of a hypocrite that are still going to church in a religious way where when they leave to church they live any kind of way and they can make a difference between them and the true christian where people never even desire to be like them because of their behavior and the way they portray themselves father may you come and open up to them a special revelation that they can take their life lord and surrender completely their life and make peace with you because you came and you opened up the way lord the veil of the temple was turned into a lord so that man can now get access lord father to the holy of the holiest lord when he was in the old testament nobody could enter that place lord only one who was chosen who was the high priest lord and that was just a figure under the levitical priesthood lord that there is another priesthood that was coming on the melchizedek lord and that priesthood open up the way that everybody can get into your presence where our soul can be ignited by the holy spirit lord and when we happen to leave this earth lord never to be destroyed never to be lord father remanded of lord all those horror all those horrible things that we were doing in the earth lord but we're gonna be reminded of those sermons and when we look up we say we remember when we were in the earth they were telling us about the sixth dimension they were telling us about the loved one here they are now what we heard is no longer lord father's sermon but it's going to be a reality father i pray that a special grace and mercy be granted unto your children they never leave this place without a proper decision in their heart father do we know that that decision is a confession it's like a stone but you needed that to start working from there well lord father you're gonna help them in their life lord to make sure they stay in tune with you and follow the leadership of the holy spirit it's enough we have lived for our own we have done stuff in our own we have been in the message living for our own but the time have come where you want to lead your children into a true personal intimate relationship where they're going to meet you sooner into the air lord father we ambly ask it and commit everything unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you church we love you [Music] when i come to the river at
