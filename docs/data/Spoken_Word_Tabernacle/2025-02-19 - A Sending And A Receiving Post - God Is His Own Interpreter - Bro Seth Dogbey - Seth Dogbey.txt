don't know how how to pray the Bible say then the spirit of the Lord will pray for you according to the will of God therefore we are bound Amen to have our prayer to be answered amen I know your question was maybe I pray it has been two years I never received my answer we will see that on Sunday amen sometime you Works quick sometime it doesn't work but it doesn't mean your prayer is not answered amen we need now to understand what do we mean by prayer being answered amen because our way of prayer being answered is I speak right now and something happen right now then we know I prayer that's not the case amen the Lord himself has to pray the second time for two three hours brother I'm say if Jesus is praying two three hours for a case what do you think amen the one without sin pray didn't work it's written in the amen and brother Bram say he prayed the Bible say he prayed again it took the prophet to give us the timing that he was two to three hours amen maybe all of us thought he came back and say come back here B then he work two to three hours Jesus staying with one case amen am and the Des trying to cast out the devil and it didn't work I'm reading the Bible you know that case right and do you know what Jesus told them this type here come out only with what do you see now you need to put take all these things together and put them and know when to use the right gear sometime you need prayer sometime you need prayer and fasting and all of that to move something out but whatever happened we going to win this battle tonight sir amen am amen so remember we got our young Sisters Meeting this Saturday at 2:30 we clear everybody ready so make sure you're there on time because we always reward the early camers amen so be there on time I believe it's a brother Glenn everything is still the same so try to be there I got some questions that has been wrote uh I mean written I just picked them up tonight but they very very interesting amen I thought we would just speak about courtship and be done then someone offer say brother Stephen can we talk about engagement so last night I just opened the prophet and I begin to see things that I never seen before in the message so get ready we're going to dig into it and you will hear what brother Bram is talking about engagement not me what brother brandham says amen amen and I'm going to read this question because they're very very important I'm not going to tell you who wrote them but I'm just going to read them so parent you understand where I'm coming from because these are very important I have to really dig into this and make sure it's clear because this is a big trouble in the message and has been a big trouble and until today it's still a big trouble amen the question is like what body is true engagement we will record this we always record but this one is very important because I have to get to this so you understand what is TR they already know what engagement is the problem is not engagement the problem is what is a true engagement this is a big deal in this message for years I know what I'm talking about amen amen what is the true Eng m is he when The Vow is given in private I wish all of you can be there but the space is small amen it says I wish is he when The Vow is given in private or when presented in in the church you see these are very very important and it's not taught correctly in this message can an old vow giving in P keep someone from finding a partner you see this question so make sure all of you are there because I will try one time to dig deeper in the scripture very deep in the scripture and in the message of the hour and as usually take everything I teach you and the quot go give it to your parent that's so we so we make sure we on the same line because this is very important amen and I have to make sure this is correct it's it's zeroed in so I don't have trouble especially with the young sisters because the boys usually come up with all kind of stuff and I'm going to tell you when a boy ask you a question what do you ask him on Saturday I keep that question I won't say here here amen before we raise his flag amen and he say can old how giving in the past keep someone from finding a partner what can invalidate and engagement this one even married people need to know this thing amen this is deep I'm sorry it's already the plane is heading towards Saturday so I can't move anything everything is already zero de for landing amen I once heard a pastor say sometime thank God it's not me uh someone can get married because someone can can't cannot get married because they gave a vow in the past and that they are tied and married to that person in the sight of God is that true brother Robert this is very very good yummy juicy cases amen amen oh amen you do you have a microphone I am just reading this so you know what's going on but the answer won't come tonight if I begin this answer then I'm preaching and it might take maybe 3 4 hours to go through this amen and when they move onto the next person they are in adultery and that is why it's now working out that is why I'm asking what is a true engagement so parent you hear me right those online parent online who are streaming or who will stream you know what I'm going to deal with this Saturday so make sure you there on time we will get into this I thought I would deal with this in another time but this is not a joke right here amen if parent this is even for question and answer but it's blending I don't know whoever the one who put this blend with the young sisters

one amen you bite on this one oh I'm sorry but it's for the young sisters woo glory to God can a parent anal a marriage so when I start answering this question I don't even know if I would talk about engagement when I start dealing with this thing right here this is very very very this one I'm going to skip it because it's going to raise a big flag I will read it somewhere of if someone says they will marry you but their intention are not good ah Jesus Christ where did you come up with all these Arsen now amen is that consider an engagement wonderful I'm going to read brother Bram quote after quote after quote and then we settle this once for all amen uh HH this one I read the young Sisters Meeting that's this is tough one this is for them I read it the young Sisters Meeting amen these are

the church this is Brother Steven I got used to that shake hand we stay brother no problem at all but I must stay true to the word and to the message of the hour the way he was given that's that's the reason why you voted me here there's no joke with this amen so pray for me we get there on time everybody ready so we're going to dig into this oh my God you guys are lucky we grew up in the message

and Father at the end Lord Jesus oh God may we have our blessings oh god father with ask Lord even as we go back home Lord we thank you we bless you in Jesus Christ name we pray amen and amen amen amen can we take this scripture reading amen from The Book of Proverbs amen thank you very much musicians amen amen it's quite a different feeling standing here amen amen so I want to read um The Book of Proverbs chapter 3 amen verse 5 and six Proverbs 3 5 and 6 it says trust in the Lord with all thine heart yes sir and lean not onto thy own understanding Amen in all thy ways acknowledge Him yes sir and he shall direct thy path amen amen amen can you be seated tonight amen amen amen we thank the Lord that we could all make it to church tonight amen the prophet said if you want to see the right come to the weekday Services amen you going to see the people who really want to come to church amen amen and the real ones amen and I believe I can see the real bride tonight amen of spoken with Tabernacle amen regardless of the challenge of the weather we are here we are the ones who are able to roll back the storm amen whatever storm it is we know is not going to prevent us amen and we shall come to the presence of the Lord amen amen amen so you want to thank the Lord tonight amen for calling us bride amen amen amen now Bible says trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not onto your own understanding yes sir there's one interest interesting thing about communication men that when somebody says something it is easy to misund understand that's right when let's say um point a say something as soon as it moves from point A there is the likelihood that it's going to get misunderstood correct amen before it gets to point BH that has always been a challenge yes sir that is why we have um in let's say in our uh maybe doctor's offices we have maybe when we are using certain products and stuff like that they really invest in what we call uh communication or we have uh frontex that you have to talk to or you have customer service amen cuz when maybe you're using maybe uh maybe AT&T or using uh uh T-mobile any of this ones and decide you said okay today I'm I'm going to stop using T-Mobile after that they're going to call you to ask you what really happened why did you switch from this to that they really want to understand what is the problem that's right so it is always important for companies to really see that they are on the same page with their customers that's right because for the business to really move on well yes sir the um the uh the provider and the customer must be on the same page that's right amen yes sir so it's very important that companies really invest in customer service because of one thing called misunderstanding or misinterpretation communication is a very important to yes amen so now when God says something God says I am going to do this or I've given you a promise it is very important to understand what he saying amen very very important to understand what God is saying right so when God says I am going to do this many of the times is either we heard it and didn't really understand what he's saying or we didn't really hear it right right so when point a is saying something before it gets to point B point B must be on the same page as point a to understand what point a is saying that's right even taking uh maybe a husband and a wife at home a husband can be saying something the wife can be receiving in a different direction that's right or vice versa the wife can be saying something but the husband can be re can receive a different understanding of what the wife is saying that's exactly so that causes a lot of misunderstanding now when the wife says something before the husband will understand one is one is that he can be on the same page the other is that the wife has to come and explain exactly what she meant by what she's saying so it makes the wife the the one who is her own interpreter of what she was saying that's exactly right so when God says something he is his own interpreter so God can say something and we can misunderstand what he's saying exactly so God has to come and interpret what he's saying that's exactly right that is my seron tonight he said a sending and a receiving post god is his own interpreter amen so we want to um read this um now before we read this quote let's go to uh second Peter chapter 1 second Peter 1 um forgive me tonight I'm trying to read amen um now second Peter chapter 1 second Peter chapter 1 from verse one amen it says Simon Peter a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ now Peter is talking to a specific people that's right that is the the the the Saints of like Precious Faith that's right he was specific now when Peter came Bible gave a description of who he was it is always good to understand who we are when we are speaking when I am a child of God there's nothing wrong by saying that I am a Son of God when God has called you into ministry as a pastor there's nothing wrong by saying he's the pastor of the church that's right amen yes amen and it's specific to a specific people he said Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord am so he's talking about a multiplication yes sir of Grace and we could see that it is through a channel called the knowledge of God that's so before we talk about Grace and peace one important thing that we can talk about is the knowledge of God that is why the spirit of God will always bring this knowledge of Christ to our remembrance because Grace and peace must be multiplied to a specific called people amen said according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness Christ has given us all things it is not some things it is not that yesterday I was healed of a headache tomorrow okay I go to God and say oh Lord I mean you you did enough for the headache when I come back today with a different problem it is a promise to me that God will answer when God heals me today tomorrow when I have a need I go back to God because he's giving me all things am am am amen amen that pertain to life and godliness everything about your life everything about your eternal life he has given to us anything that is pertain to Godliness he has given to us that is why God is using the ministry to strengthen things out because everything that is connected to Godliness has been given to the bride in this last age so anything the prophet said if there is any question Bible question there is a Bible answer to it amen so when we come with our questions we know that God is going to have an answer to it amen he's given us everything that pertain onto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue so it is very important to really understand the one who has called us am am very important to understand the one who has called us amen he said whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises exceeding great and precious prom promises their promises are not little promises they are great and precious great means great something beyond your understanding something beyond your imagination is what God has given to us they are promises that he's given to us and those promises pertain to life and godliness that's right anything that we need concerning our lives and godliness he has given to us amen amen so whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by this ye might be partakers of the divine nature am amen amen God's promise is that we are partakers of the divine nature amen so that's why God is bringing to us to understand that we have a Divine part and a human part amen so our mind must go back to the Divine part that he has made it partakers of that divine nature amen amen amen amen amen all right so I I want to um skip to verse 8 so um with with the preceding verses it talks about um add unto your faith um and all that love being the topmost of all and then so I'm reading from vers for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ amen but he that lath these things is blind and and cannot see a far off and have forgotten that he was pered from his old sins so we are talking about a divine nature that brings us into remembrance of who God is amen so when we don't have this divine nature it means we've lost something we can't see amen we we under a kind of Amnesia and didn't even understand that God had taken us away from our old nature that's right amen so God consistently bring to our remembrance that we are partakers of that divine nature amen so so let's keep reading it said wherefore the rather that's verse 10 Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall am amen now let me go to 15 it said moreover I will endeavor that you may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance Peter is saying that even when the Lord take me away he wants to keep bringing these things to our remembrance let us understand this things and before that he said we had not believed kindly devis fables amen they were witnesses to the experience yes sir of divine nature amen they were witnesses to the experience of deity that's right amen and before Christ left he said the glory that the father had given to me I give unto you that's right amen so Peter is reminding the saints that we are partakers of that divine nature that's right amen so when God speaks it takes an understanding to really know what he's talking about that's exactly right amen now you know what the Holy Ghost does the bible as Jesus was leaving he said I'll send down I'll send to you another comforter and what is the comforter doing he's bringing to you remembrance he's remembering the things that Christ has said to you that's right amen so in Peter the Holy Ghost was operating to bring it back to our remembrance the things that Christ has said that's right amen so said moreover I will endeavor that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance for we have not followed kindly devis fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ now when you look at it you can read it this way it said when we made unto unto you the power of of our Lord Jesus Christ made unto you the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ so the power of our Lord Jesus Christ was manifested in the disciples amen the power was not left alone to Christ but Peter is saying we manifested to you the power of our Lord Jesus Christ right so is bringing to our remembrance that that same power was given to the bride that same power was given to the church so the spirit of God keeps coming to remember you that that divine power was given to you am am amen amen so 17 said for he received from God the Father honor and Glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent Glory this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased right and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the Holy Mount we have also a more sure word of Prophecy where unto you do well that you take heat as unto a light that shineth in the dark place until the day Dawn and the day star AR right in your heart knowing this amen yes sir knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private [Music] interpretation amen amen amen so that was the point yes sir he said knowing this first yes sir that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpret a for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of men but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost so when Peter was speaking to the church he was telling them that it is the holy ghost that is speaking to you he's bringing these things to remembrance that remember that same power was given to you that's right amen amen amen amen so now when when let's say somebody gives you a promise let's say um I said brother Freddy um I'm going to give you $1,000 right now amen amen so now what is brother Freddy supposed to do all what brother Freddy is supposed to do is to sit and wait for the $1,000 brother Freddy is not going to manufacture the giving of the $1,000 I am the one who is supposed to come in to perform that amen so when a promise is given sir it it it is it is an obligation to the one giving the promise to perform whatever he has said so when God has given us a promise it is his obligation to perform that until that that promise is not fulfilled amen amen now talking about misunderstanding this is from the message God being misunderstood yes brother take it said you know misunderstanding gets in a lot of trouble a lot of trouble misunderstanding gets us in a lot of trouble it said many times that people say things that they repeat after somebody else where they misunderstood them yes sir so when somebody says I am going to give brother Freddy $1,000 and you heard it you must come back to me and understand what I'm trying to say am I going to give him cash am I going to give him a check am I going to do a Zeal transfer to him I money order amen so when a third party comes in in that conversation and picks that bra Bram is saying that we get into a lot of trouble when somebody else is repeating what is being said so when God gives a promise to the bride and a minister comes here and is not in line is not in tune with what God has said he's going to give a wrong interpretation and that is going to bring a misunderstanding hallelujah amen amen amen so the prophet said that gets a person in trouble that's right I believe it will be good for us if we just well wait till we understood what you was talking about don't you think so that's what the prophet is saying I said I know it will be for me a very good for me to find out first and then say it amen so many times we can have somebody come to talk to us about one sister or about one brother this one did that this one did this this one said this this one said that most of the time the problem is with the third party that is receiving that information amen and it becomes very dangerous when that person is propagating that message without going back to understand from the one who said it or the one who did it amen amen that has always been a problem but BR said we get into trouble with that amen it says see but we are always seem to be misunderstood amen amen so the prophet was talking about um Psalm 106 we are going to read Psalm 106 amen I mean if we can turn to some 106 vers 7 uhuh Psalm 106 verse 7 Psalm 106:7 if we are there we can say amen amen Psalm 106:7 said our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies but provoked him at the Red Sea at the sea amen even at the Red Sea it said our fathers did not understand what you were doing in Egypt so God was doing something that's right to um to Israel to make Israel see something but they didn't understand what he was doing through the Miracles that was doing in Egypt amen so the prophet is saying here David is speaking of Israel misunderstood his miracles when they were in Egypt that's right amen now in the same message God being misunderstood he said now to misunderstand is just not to say well I didn't hear what he said so you could have heard what the person said amen amen you could have heard what God Said of the promises you could have heard what the prophet preached about the message but BR saying now to misunderstand it's just not to say well I didn't hear what he said we all heard what the prophet said but to see something done and misunderstand what it's for that's right amen that's right so you saw it but you didn't understand what it was for the meaning of that thing ex amen you saw a movement you saw somebody moving from point A to point B yes you saw it but what was the meaning of that amen that has always been the problem sir amen say said that you're missing the boat all completely then it said now God doesn't do Miracles just to say see I'm God God does a miracle for un understanding see God does it for a purpose so when God heal somebody in this church God does that for a purpose amen for us to understand what he's saying there's a message he's given to the church that is why God pick somebody and he always uses somebody as an example when God heals somebody of a kidney disease is an example that the spirit of depression can also be healed by God that cancer can be healed by God that any form of headache can be healed by God Amen so when God sends something like that it is a sign that he's given to the church amen so he said God does a miracle for un understanding see God does it for a purpose and did you notice the reading of the Psalms here in in this seventh verse which you read I think it's so beautiful I want to read it over again it said our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt see they he understand it they remember not the multitude of thy mercies but provoked him at the sea even the Red Sea so nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake that he might make his mighty power to be known so even though they didn't believe even though they provoked him God still saved them why because he was still sending a message he was still sending a message to you and I who come and read that amen so regardless of unbel in the land God still did the miracle because he's still sending a message amen it said see they did not understand why God down in Egypt performed this Miracles he was trying to show them his mercies that's right he was trying to get them to understand that he was God in their midst I love that I love that the prophet said I love that so when somebody comes here and we we pray for the person and the person gets healed what is the message the message is I am God in your midst amen when somebody ask for something from the Lord and the Lord provides what's the message he's trying to tell the church I am in your midst amen amen amen so say and that's what in the same message uh paragraph 117 said and that's what he's trying to do today that's right he just doesn't heal people just because he can heal he's trying to get to you that he's the resurrection that he can make you well he can raise up your body amen so he's healing you to tell you that the Rapture is not a myth the Rapture is a reality he can raise up your body amen he can do whatever he wants to he's Jehovah I like that said but the people misunderstood him God is so easily to be misunderstood by unbelievers [Music] unbeliever so that's the point unbelievers that's why the prophet said only believe only believe because that's how you can understand God when he's doing something amen it said God is so easily to be misunderstood by unbelievers by those who don't want to understand that's right now let's take a conflict yes my brother of two people if one or two of them do not want to understand nothing is going to be solved nothing is going to be solved let's say a wife and a husband has a conflict and then they bring it to the pastor and this one says I'm right that one to says I'm right nothing is going to be solved amen because somebody would understand amen amen it said many people try to understand many don't want to understand they just shut up themselves so let's talk about the message of the hour you talk it you speak about it many don't want to understand you call the name of brother Braham they don't want to hear even in the message talk about the cloud talk about the pillar of fire they don't want to go near it and one difficult thing as the pastor is taking us through I just thank the Lord for that is God veiled in flesh that is a big one now bring it that to the church it depends on whether the person wants to understand or the person doesn't want to understand but whether you want to understand or you don't want to understand it is a fact God interpret his own word to his church amen said many don't want to understand they just shut up themselves and say there's no such a thing I don't believe in such then they can never understand amen when you shut up yourself when the word of God is coming as long as it's coming from the Bible it's coming from the message of the hour and you shut up yourself you won't understand amen because you shut up yourself amen the proph said then they can never understand but a man that is willing ah to understand that is willing to sit down and come let us reason together say the Lord now that man is on the line of learning something from the Lord when the difficult word is coming to you you don't understand it's and and Bible says that lean not onto your own understanding right amen many of times we switch or we are always on the line of the fleshly understanding because so many things have been pumped into our minds we see a whole lot of things we read a whole lot of things and excuse me to say sometimes a lot of garbage goes inside and and and there's there's one thing sorry I have to go into Data amen there's there's a saying in there that garbage in garbage out when you when you bring in garbage we can analyze something meaningful whatever analysis we come up with is garbage so when you go into the world and you are hearing a lot of garbage from people a lot of garbage from the internet what is coming out of you is [Applause] garbage amen amen said but people who always are associated with God and God's power said you can hardly be associated with god without being associated with his power you can hardly be associated with God and not associated with his power so when we are connected to God we are connected to his power it goes together am amen amen it said because when you associated with him you are acquainted with to him or a relative to him and then you have his power in you a relative to him amen so my wife is my spouse it's a relative to me amen so when I'm connected to God I am God's wife and that power is also pertaining to me amen is said that that's the reason that people cannot believe in miracles today because they don't have anything in them to believe with that's right amen there's nothing inside to believe in miracles amen so they not going to believe it said they've they've got to have something in there to believe with and when the spirit of God is in a man he will say Amen to every word of God and every Mir of God Amen so when the spirit of God is in US amen yes sir so don't have a problem with me when I'm shouting amen amen when the word of God is coming you can't take away my amen because the word is for me because the word is inside of me the word has to con to the word so you can't stop my amen it can never happen amen I don't care whether I lose my voice amen I'm going to shout amen because that word is me amen so now the prophet said you can't get blood from a turnip because there's no blood in it no no blood amen so that's the same way you can't get believe out of unbeliever because there's nothing there to believe with there's nothing there to believe with now we we go to Daniel said the prophet said Daniel was misunderstood when all all the rest of the children of Israel bow down to the image but he and shedrach and mesach and Abednego refused to bow down well they said what's the matter with him the whole nation said what's the matter with this crazy guy well all the rest of the Hebrews the rest of the Hebrews now we had four friends who were Hebrews who also believed the god of Isaac the god of Jacob the god of um Abraham they all believe that but these four special people did not believe it so the prophet said they were misunderstood when they didn't bow to the image because the rest of the Hebrews bow to the image so I can see one Hebrew child coming to them you know we all believe in the god of Isaac we all believe the the god of Abraham you know uh it's a Lord that has given that we should obey amen it's an image of Daniel the Prophet himself amen and and and this happened when Nebuchadnezzar saw the manifestation of God in a man in human flesh amen so he brought that image Amen to show [Applause] Dey amen amen but the prophet said Daniel shedrach mishak and abedu refus to bow down amen amen the prophet and the bride they say the same thing yes sir and they do the same thing the prophet or the prophets are always examples that God gave in every age so you see Daniel being a prophet Amen in that age had friends who were the bride and they were doing exactly the same thing that Daniel was doing that's right amen so when the prophet comes with the message it is an example to the bride who are looking onto the Prophet yes my brother amen yes now now I'm taking this for how can I overcome yes so the prophet said and Daniel a man a prophet amen shedrach M Abednego Daniel was the prophet and that was the size of the church in that day I mean the bride that's exactly right amen so the prophet is saying that Daniel was the prophet shedrach mesach and Abednego were the bright in that age amen so he said there's lots of church about 2 million of them went down there amen they bow to the image he said that was the size of the Overcomer and them Overcomers were put was put to the test and every overcomer has to be put to the test and when they said you take back what the word says or either be throw it in the fiery furnace they refuse anything but the word amen so the church the bride always stand according to what they see manifested in the prophet that was sent to them that's exactly amen amen amen so as as um we we we seeing tonight God sends a prophet as an example to his bride now an example is always a model that is shown for replication it so when when let's say let's say you um you're going to get a house or you're going to get an apartment normally when you go to the leasing office they have what we call a model amen where the Furnitures are being arranged where the FL flowers and all that stuff are put together it's just to tell you that you can have your room as beautiful as this that's it amen so a model gives you an idea that we have a window here we have a door here we have a dining room here we have a bathroom here we have this here and it's an example that is given to you now you can see that example and know that okay in this apartment complex in this house complex when I go for a room like this or when I go for a house like this I'm going to find a window I'm going to find a door I'm going to find a bathroom I'm going to find two bedrooms I'm going to find all those things so when the prophet was sent to this last age we watch exactly what God manifested in the prophet to tell us what the bride has amen everything that the prophet had been manifest or or everything that God manifested in the prophet was an example to the bride to replicate amen for us to see that this is who we are amen amen so Amos chapter 3 talks about um God not doing anything except he reveals it to the prophet so the prophets are always examples that we would have to see amen Paul says follow me as I follow Christ amen so whilst you are watching Paul following Christ you are seeing exactly the manifestation of the word of God in Paul that's in that age amen amen amen now Bible says God in s times spoke through the prophets but in this last days through his son before the son started manifestation there was a prophet called John the Baptista amen so God never did nothing without the prophets even when the sun was manifested there was a prophet on the land amen amen there was a prophet on the land amen so are we sons of God Amen as children of God there is also a prophet that is manifested for us to see because God won't do anything when God is sending a message he has to send it through a channel amen and there is a message in this last age the message to us is the Capstone Ministry what is the Capstone the fullness of Christ manifest in flesh the fullness of God manifest in flesh that is the Capstone amen men sent to the bride in this last age so it is telling us that God has given us a way for us to become equal with Christ amen so that's why Peter is saying that we have been called to be partakers of the divine nature sir amen through all these promises the knowledge of Christ we have been called to be part Akers of this divine nature amen now this is from the message who is this Meed amen he said now we see the attribute signs of his Spirit have not yet entered into the word form body aop amen because um we are we are trying to see how different we are from Christ right so um as Peter was saying that that power that was in Christ we have manifested that amen so our mind is okay so how did Peter manifest that if they were not in the Toopy amen so if Christ manifested something amen he was in the toopan as the prophet said that's right now let's read this amen said this body is subject to the word and earnest this body is subject to the word and Earnest waiting for the earnest change of the body that's I said now the difference between him and you as a son see he was at the beginning the word and morphe body amen he came in and lived in that in the person of madc then later we never heard no more of madc because he became Jesus Christ amen MC was the priest but he became Jesus Christ now you bypass that because in that form you know all things and you have never been able to know that yet amen you come like Adam like me now my question is when we came like Adam amen we bypass our theop the beginning Adam was able to name the Animals Adam was able to say three move here or this go here animal come here he was able to talk to that animal but Adam bypassed the theophany amen how did that happen how did God achieve that somebody who was not in his theophany so God is sending us a message that even if we are not in the theop body he showed us an example in Adam amen so there is a way that we can manifest deity without even being in a theop body amen so Peter is still remembering the church that that power power amen that was Christ we have manifested that same power to you remember amen it is a promise and he said it's an exceeding great promise given to you the church that's right amen it said you became from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted but when the life is finished here if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting that's where we go that is the word then we can look back and see what we done now we don't understand it we have never become the word we just become flesh men not the word that's amen amen now we said um in the same message who is this me sedc it said uh from uh 2 Corinthians 5:11 he said if this Earthly body be dissolved I'm trying to run very fast with this I'm not looking at the time but I'm trying to go fast this Earthly Tabernacle we have another one see we have bypass that to come straight from God the attribute to be flesh to be tempted and tested by sin like Adam did but when testing of his word is over then we are taken up to this body that was prepared for us before the foundation of the word it is a word there that we skipped amen it's talking about the theop body that we skipped to come right around down here to be tempted and tested if we have come through that he there had been no temptation we know all things that's the reason Jesus know all things because he was wor before he was flesh then we become the word amen he said here we we are formed to the word image to be a partaker of the word am feed on the word by being predestinated since the beginning you see that little spark of life that you had in you from the beginning when you started your journey many of you can remember it you join this church and joined that church you tried this and that nothing satisfied that's right but one day you just recognized it right amen amen amen so when the prophet is saying that we have been formed to the word image to be a partaker of the word yes sir that is why a child of God cannot separate himself from the word amen the word has to be a partner to a child of God wherever the child of God is going the word of God is following wherever he's going he's moving with the word of God because we are being partakers of the word amen sir this is seeking after Jesus he said now a man that's born of the spirit of God a man then becomes in the image of God inwardly yes sir amen so there is a God inside of you that is when you are born of the spirit of God yes amen God when he made this world he just spoke the word he had nothing else to do nothing else to make it out of he just spoke it into existence the word was made by the word of God God spoke the word said let there be and it be began to materialize and the very ground that you said over tonight is the word of God materialized amen did you know that amen God just said let there be and it was he believed own word then he's almighty God and if he's always God and if he's almighty God he can do all things amen and if he cannot do all things he isn't almighty God and if the scripture tells us that he's the same yesterday today and forever amen now in this message the uncertain sound amen we don't have no more security of the home says send your children to school what do they teach them out there many times too many times they teach them we come from apes well we don't believe that amen he said no and if a man no more than an animal then eat drink and be merry amen that's what makes so many juvenile delinquent amen that's what makes so many crimes committed because if People's know more than an animal it makes him act like an animal that's right amen so when you are making somebody look like you're animal you're Beast you're this you're that you're sinful that what do you expect from the person that is why the spirit of God comes to you and makes you understand that you have two parts even if you seeing an animal likee behavior amen there is a Divine part in you amen it depends on what you're activating amen and that is what is going to bring the result amen he said we go to tell him he's a Son of God born for the kingdom of God and he's somebody this is just a negative a picture negative waiting for it to be developed Sunday and death is the only thing that can develop it when you die out to yourself a new picture start on the inside and then that new creature amen Christ Jesus begin to show itself through amen so when this negative is developed when this negative is developed amen Christ is saying a new picture starts on the inside a new one starts on the inside amen I'm going to move to this uh this message the voice of the sign it said there is only one form of eternal life if you've got eternal life then you yourself was in God's thinking before the world was created you are an attribute of his thinking cuz Eternal never did begin or never end we never did begin will will never end talking about the inside man you are a part of God's economy always it's just reflecting it's becoming now they got one more picture to develop that is death then the negative becomes positive then you are in the bright and with Christ as he taught like husband and wife today so God Christ and the church will be the same amen so when that negative is developed to a positive the prophet is saying that we God and Christ we become the same it said now the that's why we are called the elected amen now the prophet said that we can't see from AAR or the the vision is D because there's no Divine Joy amen now we read job 17 verse 7 if you can take job 17 verse 7 job 17:7 yes sir it said my eye also is deemed by reason of Sorrow that's right and all my members are as a shadow right so job is saying his eye is dim because of Sorrow right so when your eyes are deam you can see from a far off you can see the picture that is ahead of you and the prophet said we've lost Divine Joy amen and that makes the vision door we can't see from afar the vision is door because there's no Divine Joy there is sorrow in our lives amen that bless the picture amen that is why God said in second Timothy 1 1: 7 amen 2 Timothy 1 ver 7 yes sir second timo1 amen verse 7 amen it said Desiring to be oh just second Timothy 1:7 yeah it said for God have not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind amen now A sound mind amen makes makes us think differently amen A sound mind makes us think differently makes us look at the picture differently as how other people are looking at it amen now in Philippians 2:56 said that we have been giv that mind of Christ let let's just read Philippians 256 Philippians 256 Philippians 2:56 said let this mind be in you amen which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God T it not robbery to be equal with God amen amen so we have been given a mind to think like Christ amen to look at things amen as how Christ looked at things amen amen amen so he didn't think it Rob robbery to be equal with God cuz there's a Divine part in Christ amen amen so he's he's given us that same mind to think that way amen so in the message show us the father said and then when Jesus Christ spoke this word I'm reading this um um quote again they never die science claims in 20 years from now they can pick up the literal voice they'll be able to pick up the literal voice of Jesus is still in the earth C see it's a sending post you are then there has to be a receiving post and if you can be the receptacle see receiving post to receive the word of God then it's real to you and it will live just like it was then amen amen so when we have that same mind of Christ and thinking as Christ Tau yes sir whatever we do or whatever we say Amen we must have that same mind as Christ did amen amen amen now in in the message the calling of Abraham but that's it friend see we have a sending station that's Heaven we've got a receiving station that's your heart so I'm back to um as sending a receiving post amen now there's a sending station from Heaven the word of God speaks something right amen and the prophet said there has to be a receiving station that's right that is in your heart yes sir amen so there's a sending there's a receiving amen now when you receive the word of God as we said the one who sent the word must interpret exactly what is saying that's exactly so that you receiving will be on the same line as the one sending that's exactly right amen that is where the Prophet said that when we misunder stand the message we get into trouble that is why we don't need a third party to come inside to wrongly interpret what the sender is given so when God send something amen it takes he himself to interpret because it is coming to a receiving station amen now when Christ was moving when Christ was doing anything as we heard from um last Wednesday Christ didn't do anything except he saw the vision from the father amen so when the father send a vision then Christ moves to do it and this same mind that was in Christ must be in you a child of God so when God send something and it falls down in your heart it means you are also sending exactly what God is given to you and when you are repeating that you are receiving exactly what God is sending that's exactly right amen amen I'm just trying to um go very fast amen sir now this is God's covenant with Abraham it said um paragraph 28 say believe it no matter what takes place believe it anyhow you see Christians don't look at what they see Christians look at things they don't see and the things you don't see are more real than the things that you see you see that microphone it will perish this one I see faith that will never perish see I I see love joy peace longsuffering goodness meekness gentleness patience those ones we don't see amen every Shield of the believer is Supernatural everything that belongs in the realm of Christianity is worked by Supernatural and anything this one said to me he said anything that can be scientifically proven isn't real I said anything that can be scientifically proven isn't real that's vice versa he said there's something wrong with you ah yeah I got saved that's what's wrong the the prophet said that I got saved that's what is wrong he said and he said oh look he said I said now you are here you are looking at television you was trying to sell me he said I said that's wonderful I said you see there's something that's Supernatural that picture is coming through us it hits that screen right amen so the prophet is saying that when you see a television amen there is a sending post that's right amen from somewhere and then the television is receiving amen he said oh yes but said that's easy said we've got a sending station and a receiving station I said so have we amen that's right we got a sending station and receiving station suddenly just tune all the static amen the unbelief out and watch what takes place watch the picture clear then you say oh yes Lord I see now that makes the difference it depends on how much stalic you let get in am amen yes now what is an interpretation amen when somebody gives a word right or somebody say something we can interpret it by words say brother said said his giving brother Freddy $1,000 amen so somebody can say okay that's what brother set said we can also interpret that by performance action so when I take the money and give it to brother Freddy it means there's an interpretation of that so there has to be a performance amen so another expression or another understanding of interpretation is performance so God is his own performing um if if I put it a performing unit amen or God performs his own word amen so when God has given a promise he's the same person who comes to perform so that's to interpret the word to you you amen because when I say it by word form only and there's no action you don't really get the picture amen amen amen amen now I take this quote again I I believe it was read um so few weeks back he said now if you notice what caused this great thing in the beginning God took man for a partner and he made a covenant with a man equal and told a man if you shall do this and do and not do this and the man broke his Covenant yes and he always breaks his Covenant now the prophet is saying that there was a covenant between man and God and he said it's an equal Covenant now there's one one um Covenant type we call parity Covenant where both parties have equal responsibilities and equal rights Amen to whatever thing that you have to the assets that you have amen so one party and the second party goes into an agreement and we call it a parity Covenant so we are equal yes sir amen so God gives us that Covenant amen so whatever God is doing he's trying to tell man that man you are also capable of doing that amen I'm trying to skip this amen now talking about interpretation this brings my mind to um that old Vin that was um brought out for auction amen and then they were trying to put a price on it until they got to a dollar amen and then one person got out and then said I don't think this violin is for $1 amen so he takes a violin and starts to play beautifully and then the price of the violin went up amen so we can be in a state Amen in a human nature till we get to that point where we devalue ourselves that's right amen but it takes God to come and take this body and play it right to prove exactly the value that we have amen because inside of us amen is the divine nature is the god nature he's given to us amen amen now in Mark 11 I'm trying to skip I'm trying to go faster in Mark 11 20- 24 amen let's just take this uh Mark 11224 Hallelujah Mark 11 2024 Mark 11: 20-24 amen now this is where Jesus had an encounter with the Fig Tree he came he was hungry saw the the Fig Tree and then the Fig Tree didn't have fruit amen and then he cured the Fig Tree amen we all know that story amen and then the following morning when they were were they were walking by the Fig Tree the disciples told him that Master the fig tree that you had casted um yesterday we we see that it is dying amen amen now when Jesus talked to the fig tree uhhuh amen he had to connect to the Fig Tree by the root amen now there is one thing called a master Seed Faith it is a little kind of Faith we're going to get into that it's a little kind of faith that that uh we all know grows to a tree right amen right it is a little fi from the beginning but it grows through a tree amen now when Christ saw this F tree and he cursed it he just talked to it and then left amen now the following day they come to see that it was dying from the root right let me just read this so this from the message God being misunderstood again he said there's a question that um a brother sent to brother Braham he said brother Braham I am saved and have been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ but how do I get away from a stubborn spirit that I can't seem to break away he said well my Christian brother or sister whoever it may be now most times when you find people that's got stubborn Spirits is usually a complex that crosses this either they have inherited from a mother father uncle aunt or grandmother grandfather somebody like that and if you trace back down through your life you find now I've taken this by experience amen but brah is saying that so many times when he goes to meet people with stubborn spirit is just trying to um just trying to go through this amen he's saying that through discernment he could trace the root to either the grandfather or the grandmother the uncle or anything like that amen so brother Braham is saying that with this amen with this stubbornness it said stubbornness is not of God and now the only way to get away from this is you have to have faith to overcome that you a Christian you're a son or a daughter of God whichever whichever you may be and you will never be able to to find able just to stand and rebuke it and rebuke it and rebuke so the prophet is saying that with stubborn Spirits amen you can't stand before it rebuke rebuke rebuke it said the way you overcome the stubborn spirit amen is by faith because it is linked to a grandfather or a grandmother or something amen so linking it to Jesus Christ at the Fig Tree there are some situations which have Roots right like a stubborn spirit is going root to the ground that's right so what did Christ do he just spoke to it and left so brother BR is saying that in a way to overcome a stubborn Spirit connect to connect to Faith and leave it alone yes sir amen yes sir so I believe no amount of stubborn Spirit no matter how linked it is to any Source no matter how the lineage is amen it can't overcome the power of faith and Bram said that speak to it and leave it alone so when we see the victory it's it started to die from the root so when you are not seen that thing go away it doesn't mean that it is not being taken away so brother Brown said resist the devil and flee away from you by faith we overcome that amen so I believe tonight no matter the stubborn Spirit no matter how link it is to any lineage right amen it can have power over the believer amen so in this all said did you hear him say if you got faith the size of a master seed he said a master Seed Faith W perform a miracle a master SE faith will perform a miracle so we understand that we have Divine Healing and miracle healing that's right amen so the prophet is saying that with miracle healing as we all understand you pray for it and instantly it goes off but Divine Healing it takes a while so the prophet is saying the master Seed Faith won't perform a miracle but if you hold to it it will bring you out amen just anchor it that's it so message tonight is if there is a stubborn spirit that is linked to any channel amen any lineage we hold on to the master Seed Faith we speak to it amen and leave it alone amen regardless of how little the faith is it is powerful enough to overcome it amen amen amen amen I'm just trying to skip this and read my last quote amen it said the promise is yours I'm closing the promise is yours but if you ever get it you ain't going to get it easy I'm going to tell you that you're going to have to take it away from Satan Satan captures your health you've got a right to go to Satan say give it back took my child you got her mixed up with the wrong boy you took my boy and mixed up with the wrong girl I claim them that's right I claim my children I claim my brother I claim my sister yes Satan you've took them from God's House Co them out there but I'm coming after them I claim them well how you know I'm an heir of all things amen it's given to me I'm an heir I can claim everything that God promised me amen there you are it's mine how do you get it something you done no sir it's the unmerited gift that God gave us and it's ours it belongs to us Satan cannot hold it if you go to him in the scripture authoritative word with faith to say it's mine lay it down amen glory I like that amen and amen let's give the Lord a hand of Amen tonight amen amen amen so let's be up standing amen even as we invite brother Steven Amen to take over the ppit amen amen amen amen praise God Amen wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful he's a lot of deep teaching that went through there amen but remember God is his own interpreter amen amen misunderstanding causes a lot of trouble and the example is very clear he told Brother Freddy I'm going to give you a $1,000 he didn't tell you how he's going to give him maybe it's a Zeal maybe it's a money order maybe it's a bank transfer maybe it's cash or maybe it's a check we the one trying to figure it out what it is when God have not said anything if you don't understand you need to ask God himself but when God speak his V his uh his word will never return to him void until he have fulfilled that which God send it for amen and the only way to receive God word you must have God on your inside are we together amen so that God can hear God because only God can interpret God Amen there is a sending post from Heaven that's God and there is a receiving post that is in your heart that heart it means the soul amen the soul is a receiving post the soul is not your brain no amen if you want to know whether you receive something in your heart versus your head watch if you reason with it I don't know if I'm helping somebody tonight if God speaks something amen watch your reaction if you reason with it just know he have landed in your brain are we together if he land in your heart the heart only say I believe it and their heart does not reason brother Bram compar that to a television are we together if you take a television post and you turn it on yeah the television cannot answer you anything the television only declare what is coming through sir if you ask the television why are you showing this the television have no answer the television will only reflect what you tune the television too and God design these are laws of the souls God designed the souls of men so that the soul doesn't have the ability to reason the soul only pick up something are we together yes sir and then reflects it that's why brother brandham say everything that God lead your soul to believe not to reason yes sir you will feel in your heart like something is telling you that I am entitled something if they ask you why you don't know how to explain it you don't even know how to say it but there is a conviction in you that one of these day I will be living Closer by day you don't know why it's coming you don't know where they thought is coming but something in you keep telling you that you know what one of these day I will travel to such and such and that's exactly something that is coming from the of the Soul amen if they ask you a question there is no way you can explain it because the soul does not reason the soul was meant to receive something from God and just become what he just received sir amen because the Brin will reason and God doesn't reason amen I don't know if you're getting what I'm saying amen your receiving post is not your head your receiving post is your heart yes sir amen when it ring in your heart and you receive it no matter the obstacle just take what your heart say you hear people saying listen to your heart amen listen to the god that is in your heart when he says that just take that and put it against whatever situation it is and leave it alone amen it might take a while but you will see for some reason somehow in an next expected way your solution will come to pass amen you are a receiving post the only way you are sending to God a uh uh uh a vibration back that you receive what he say is by believing it yes sir when you believe it it's telling Heaven that somebody have just received the message right amen then heaven will back you up yes sir are we together amen these laws are very simple if you want to see Big Miracle they're very simple amen the Pentecostal R put us to a lot of pressure a lot of man working stuff and fabricating manufacturing Miracle until we begin to try to push people to make people to fall on the ground and you will see Pentecost until the person fell on the ground and the person fell on the ground and woke up and nothing happened because it's coming from the work of men too much exercise amen you don't need muscle exercise you need to exercise your heart your faith in your soul and let the faith exercise because the faith is the only thing that can do it amen Adam bypass the theophany we also bypass the theophany amen he bypassed the theophany brother Bram say at the beginning God created him in a theophany and God took him away from the theophany and put him in the flesh that's when he bypass it are we together sir then when he bypassed he was not different than me and you that's the reason why he could die are we together yes sir but whatever Jesus did if you follow brother brandham through brother brandham always repeat over and over that Jesus restore us back to he doesn't say restore us back to you to him yes sir you didn't get that you didn't get that you didn't get that every race that is on Earth came from Adam yes sir the Bible say we came from one blood it is from Adam amen and by representation all of us of we were represented in Adam that's why whatever happened in Adam is coming straight here but Adam bypass his theophany Jesus did not bypass his theophany so Jesus cannot bring you back to him can I repeat it again you want me to repeat it again amen Jesus came with his theophany he was the word made flesh so if Jesus restore us back to him we must be the word made flesh but we don't have a offing so Jesus restoring us back not to him but back to Adam that's why brother brandham keep saying we are back to Adam when before the fall because in Adam you can find a man that doesn't have a theophany but he's living like a God and he's a God on the earth yes because the Satan will tell you you don't have a t so Jesus was doing Mir Miracle because he has a theophany so you better shut up because you wait till the day of the Rapture then when you're going to have your theophany you can perform Miracle that's what the devil will tell you and you will be like yeah yeah yeah brother Bram say we will get our theop when the Rapture come Jesus restore you not to him he restore you back to Adam because in Adam you say Satan Adam bypass his thean so how how why didn't you go to him and talk to him why did you go to his wife because you knew exactly what he was without aop he knew how to handle you so God is restoring us back to Adam before the fall to tell you that right the way you are you can do the greater work amen greater greater work let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we approaching you again humbly tonight father we thank you for your grace for your love and your mercy and for speaking to us such a power
