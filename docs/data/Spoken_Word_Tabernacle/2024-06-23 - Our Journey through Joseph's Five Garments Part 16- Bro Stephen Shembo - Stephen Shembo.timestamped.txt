[1:00:04] Alpha and the Omega father in the name
[1:00:06] of Jesus Christ amen amen Genesis 50 if
[1:00:11] you there you can say Amen my translator
[1:00:14] already in the back okay Genesis 50
[1:00:19] verse uh 15 very
[1:00:23] familiar and when Joseph's Brethren so
[1:00:27] that their father was
[1:00:30] dead they say Joseph will perhaps
[1:00:35] haters everybody's not like
[1:00:41] you and will certainly repay us all the
[1:00:46] evil which we did to him that's what
[1:00:49] they thought so they remember they did
[1:00:52] Evil at least they they have that
[1:00:55] conscience
[1:00:56] because some have a problem they don't
[1:00:58] even have a conscience they're harming
[1:01:01] somebody that's a dangerous one amen
[1:01:05] amen verse 16 and they sent a messenger
[1:01:09] you might be seated to Joseph saying
[1:01:12] your father did command before he died
[1:01:16] they made sure they can get this one and
[1:01:18] they're using a leverage from their
[1:01:20] father your father did command before he
[1:01:23] died saying so shall you say to
[1:01:29] Joseph
[1:01:31] amen forgive I pray you
[1:01:36] now yes sir yes sir whatever they did
[1:01:41] forgive I pray you now the trespass of
[1:01:45] your brethren and their
[1:01:48] sin for they did you
[1:01:53] evil and now we pray you forgive the
[1:01:57] trespass of the
[1:01:59] servant of the god of your father if you
[1:02:03] were servant of the god of the father
[1:02:05] why were you
[1:02:08] doing
[1:02:09] amen and Joseph wept when they spoke to
[1:02:13] him it shows that he was an evil spirit
[1:02:17] that's right and his Brethren also went
[1:02:19] and fell down before his face and they
[1:02:23] say behold we be
[1:02:26] your
[1:02:30] servant God is able to
[1:02:34] do no matter how difficult it seems like
[1:02:37] this prophecy won't happen it will
[1:02:39] happen he's able to do what he said he
[1:02:43] will do amen make sure it's coming from
[1:02:46] God that's right and if it's coming from
[1:02:48] God Heaven and Earth will pass away th
[1:02:50] will never pass away amen verse 19 and
[1:02:55] just J said to them fear not for am I in
[1:03:00] the place of
[1:03:02] God in other word who did all of
[1:03:05] this it's God right
[1:03:09] amen and I already understood it's
[1:03:12] God amen amen verse
[1:03:16] 20 but as for
[1:03:19] you you thought evil against
[1:03:23] me you thought bad you thought we going
[1:03:26] to sink him
[1:03:28] down
[1:03:30] amen by whatever we doing it's going to
[1:03:32] go down like a
[1:03:34] Titanic this was not a Titanic neither
[1:03:38] was it a
[1:03:39] Titan this one was what a
[1:03:43] proof amen he said you thought evil
[1:03:47] against me but
[1:03:50] God meant it to what so whatever
[1:03:54] happened there whatever ever you think
[1:03:57] even whatever I don't care how many
[1:04:00] devil you got in you God use all those
[1:04:06] demon for
[1:04:08] good as bad as those demon are bad God
[1:04:12] used that amen and his intent was for
[1:04:19] good their opinion was for evil but God
[1:04:23] opinion was different than their opinion
[1:04:25] op and it was God opinion that prevailed
[1:04:30] so it doesn't matter what people
[1:04:32] say or
[1:04:34] wish or want about you it's not going to
[1:04:39] happen even if they
[1:04:43] pray bad it won't
[1:04:45] happen only what God promised to happen
[1:04:49] will happen amen he say but God meant it
[1:04:54] to good to bring to pass as it is this
[1:04:59] day to save many people
[1:05:02] how what looked bad God was in
[1:05:06] it and God was the author of it and he
[1:05:11] turned it to be good we clear so far
[1:05:15] let's go to Exodus chapter
[1:05:20] one glory to
[1:05:23] God Amen you can hear me okay no EO
[1:05:28] nothing okay cuz the devil usually play
[1:05:33] around he love to come to church
[1:05:41] too don't start before I give you a
[1:05:46] scripture because when the sons of God
[1:05:48] were
[1:05:49] gathering in the time of job sir he also
[1:05:53] showed up in church
[1:06:00] amen Exodus 1 verse 6 this is where we
[1:06:04] stopped last week if you there you can
[1:06:07] say amen amen and Joseph
[1:06:10] died and all his Brethren and all that
[1:06:15] generation everybody died amen and the
[1:06:19] children of Israel were fruitful you
[1:06:22] know you understand this now amen
[1:06:26] I hope somebody's still
[1:06:28] alive and increase
[1:06:30] abundantly you understand where it's
[1:06:32] coming from and
[1:06:35] multiply and works exceedingly
[1:06:38] Mighty and the land was filled with them
[1:06:42] in other words the economy of Egypt
[1:06:46] actually grew stronger right because of
[1:06:49] the Jews because Egypt was saved by
[1:06:53] Joseph if he was not for Joseph Egypt
[1:06:56] would have sink
[1:06:58] uhhuh amen but Joseph saved Egypt amen
[1:07:03] and he was God in Joseph uhhuh saving
[1:07:06] Egypt amen so the presence of the Jews
[1:07:08] brought
[1:07:10] prosperity and strength and even the
[1:07:12] economy
[1:07:14] amen of the
[1:07:16] Egyptian so they were not just
[1:07:18] multiplying but they were making the
[1:07:20] country stronger that's
[1:07:23] right you think they will protect
[1:07:25] protect someone like this because the
[1:07:28] economy is depending on them normally
[1:07:31] that's what it's supposed to be amen and
[1:07:33] the Bible says now there arose a new
[1:07:39] king because if they ask someone they
[1:07:42] say how did we get these people here
[1:07:47] Joseph why do we have so many Jews here
[1:07:50] you don't know the story no it was
[1:07:52] Joseph who came here and because of him
[1:07:55] the whole tribe came back here and then
[1:07:58] they begin to multiply quickly so why do
[1:08:01] we have this Joseph you cannot separate
[1:08:04] the Jewish existence in Egypt with
[1:08:09] Joseph every time they see a Jews they
[1:08:11] remember Joseph but for some
[1:08:16] reason a new king amen amen now there
[1:08:21] rose up a new king over Egypt which knew
[1:08:24] not what Jose how can a president be
[1:08:28] born in this country and does no George
[1:08:35] Washington are we together how can a
[1:08:38] president be a president of United
[1:08:40] States and doesn't know Abraham
[1:08:42] Lincoln they need to get you off the
[1:08:45] President office because before you get
[1:08:47] there you should know most of them
[1:08:50] especially George Washington you can't
[1:08:52] miss it and Joseph was the highest of
[1:08:55] all of
[1:08:56] themen because of what he did how
[1:09:00] come in the midst of something like this
[1:09:03] somebody Rose and you ask him a question
[1:09:06] do you know Joseph he says
[1:09:10] no have you heard about Joseph I don't
[1:09:13] know how did you become a
[1:09:22] pharaoh stepen in the book of fact says
[1:09:26] this he says in Act 7 but when the time
[1:09:31] of the promise Drew
[1:09:35] now so the problem is not
[1:09:38] Pharaoh it is the promise that was given
[1:09:43] to amen amen so Pharaoh really doesn't
[1:09:47] even understand what happened to him it
[1:09:50] looked like something went into his
[1:09:52] memory and deleted Joseph
[1:09:56] and it was
[1:09:58] God that did that because the Bible say
[1:10:02] but when the time of the promise Drew n
[1:10:06] which God has sown to who Abraham the
[1:10:09] people did what grew and did what
[1:10:12] multiplied in Egypt till another king
[1:10:14] arose which knew not what Joseph how
[1:10:17] come this King doesn't know
[1:10:22] Joseph amen amen because the time of the
[1:10:26] promise amen is coming closer amen when
[1:10:30] the time of
[1:10:32] something come on is about to happen God
[1:10:37] will push every button Amen
[1:10:41] on God will begin to react in an unusual
[1:10:45] way amen because his word must come to
[1:10:49] pass God is able to
[1:10:52] do what he says that he will do
[1:10:56] it doesn't matter how difficult it
[1:11:04] is because when the Jews were talking
[1:11:07] together they said do you know God gave
[1:11:08] us a promise they say yes what was the
[1:11:11] promise they say that we will sourn in
[1:11:13] this country for 400 years oh okay and
[1:11:16] then we will be slave they say h Slave
[1:11:21] how how are we going to be slave with
[1:11:24] all the privilege of Joseph like this
[1:11:26] you turning her to be slave ah come on
[1:11:29] we got a monument there over there for
[1:11:32] Joseph if you look at the Constitution
[1:11:34] you see the name of Joseph how
[1:11:37] come but because God say so
[1:11:42] amen God will change even the
[1:11:46] laws that's to fulfill his
[1:11:51] word amen amen listen to what brother
[1:11:55] Branham say glory to God brother Branham
[1:11:58] says that but when God's prophetic
[1:12:02] time came to pass after he promised
[1:12:06] Abraham that his seed would sourn in a
[1:12:09] Strange Land for 400 years and he will
[1:12:12] bring them up by what a strong hand then
[1:12:15] when the hour of the time of the promise
[1:12:18] did what Drew n There Rose up a pharaoh
[1:12:21] who did not know
[1:12:23] Joseph no
[1:12:27] impossible it seems that it would not be
[1:12:30] when the time of the promise joai uhhuh
[1:12:34] God will make things do what keep up to
[1:12:37] fit his prophetic promise do you believe

[1:12:48] Constitution is supporting Israel you
[1:12:51] going to have so many
[1:12:53] anti-Semitism all over Camp is like this
[1:12:56] because God's time for the promise has
[1:12:59] come amen no matter how much it seems

[1:18:20] God for his own
[1:18:22] purpose to show his power yes
[1:18:25] and he was showing his power in
[1:18:27] advantage of the Jews so the more God

[1:18:36] you praise be to the name of the Lord
[1:18:39] let jum to verse n and he says to his

[1:19:43] suddenly Israel is changing coat from a
[1:19:47] coat of many color they dropping down to
[1:19:50] the second coat of a servant because

[1:31:35] them because one is a patriarch
[1:31:41] amen amen amen but the Midwife did what
[1:31:45] verse 17 they fear God and did not as
[1:31:50] the king of Egypt commanded them but did
[1:31:53] what the men children
[1:31:57] alive so something is not
[1:32:00] changing these people in hardship they
[1:32:03] know how to live when everything is good
[1:32:06] they know how to live this is why Paul
[1:32:08] says this he says not that I speak in
[1:32:11] respect of one for I have what learned
[1:32:15] in whatever state I
[1:32:17] am there with to be how content I know
[1:32:20] both how to be how a Bas and I know how

[1:32:24] be abound everywhere in all things I am
[1:32:27] instructed both to be how full and to be
[1:32:30] what hungry both to abound and to what
[1:32:33] to need and to suffer need I can do all
[1:32:36] things to who Christ which does what
[1:32:39] strengthens
[1:32:40] me Hallelujah in good days or bad days
[1:32:44] everything is good amen amen amen watch
[1:32:48] now verse uh 18 and the king of Egypt
[1:32:51] called for the Midwife and said to them
[1:32:54] why you have done this thing and have
[1:32:56] saved the men children alive and the
[1:33:00] Midwife say to Pharaoh because the
[1:33:03] Hebrew
[1:33:05] women are not as the Egyptian women amen
[1:33:10] for they are how Lively H somebody is
[1:33:13] strong and are delivered before the
[1:33:17] Midwife gets to what unto them so there
[1:33:19] is no way to kill the
[1:33:22] baby amen amen therefore watch now God
[1:33:27] deal well with the Midwife and the
[1:33:31] people did what multiply and works how
[1:33:34] very
[1:33:36] Mighty you ready and he came to pass
[1:33:40] because the Midwife fear God Amen in
[1:33:44] their
[1:33:45] job in their offices Amen in their work

[1:33:52] the fear of God uh-huh in their work

[1:34:00] but now they are working under the fear
[1:34:03] of God Amen when they work under the
[1:34:06] fear of God what

[1:34:18] houses do you know what he
[1:34:20] means do you know what he means do you
[1:34:23] know what it means these Midwife were
[1:34:29] Barren they didn't have
[1:34:34] babies amen amen they were delivering
[1:34:38] baby but they themselves
[1:34:41] baren so normally a woman that doesn't
[1:34:44] have a baby doesn't even understand
[1:34:47] compassion that's right I have a
[1:34:49] quote and Pharaoh put the instruction on
[1:34:52] them but we less of their state amen
[1:34:56] their purpose to fear God and God now

[1:35:03] families when you take your

[2:08:53] also both of them uhhuh and the woman
[2:08:55] was left of her two sons and her husband

[2:09:02] with her daughters-in-law okay that she
[2:09:04] might return from the country of Moab
[2:09:06] uhhuh for she had heard in the country
[2:09:08] of Moab how that the Lord had had
[2:09:10] visited his people in giving them bread
[2:09:12] stop let's go back to verse six then she
[2:09:15] Naomi
[2:09:17] arose with her what daughters in-law was
[2:09:20] there two of
[2:09:22] one so up to this point we don't know

[2:10:01] the almighty has dealt very bitterly
[2:10:04] with me I went out how
[2:10:08] full let's go back again so Naomi went
[2:10:13] full rof and opa were married in a good
[2:10:18] family full
[2:10:23] Prosper amen amen but when they went
[2:10:26] back

[2:10:32] marriage and Ora enter into this family
[2:10:36] everything was good and
[2:10:38] suddenly both husband died and we
[2:10:42] remember brother Bram telling us that
[2:10:45] sometime God let the very props you
[2:10:48] remember this be not from us sometime he
[2:10:53] let what sickness strike us he let what
[2:10:55] disappointments and what heartache
[2:10:58] strike us sometime he does that to get
[2:11:00] you where you can be what influenced by
[2:11:03] the gospel be wise enough to do what to
[2:11:05] catch it don't be what stupid enough to
[2:11:08] walk away from it the one who walk away
[2:11:10] is how
[2:11:12] stupid I'm I'm reading the
[2:11:15] prophet the one who walk away is what
[2:11:18] stupid between all and roof who walk
[2:11:20] away
[2:11:25] because God let tragedy come for both of
[2:11:29] them giving both of them the opportunity
[2:11:32] to move where they can be influenced by
[2:11:35] the gospel amen are we together I'm
[2:11:38] staying on the surface so we can blend
[2:11:40] the two together you can see the five
[2:11:42] phases of Joseph in the life of rof am
[2:11:46] are we together am are we together are
[2:11:49] we together so at this point we don't
[2:11:51] know who is
[2:11:53] bad you know it because you know the end
[2:11:55] of the story yes sir but let's go back
[2:11:57] again like you don't know the end of the
[2:11:59] story both of them look good amen so
[2:12:03] when they heard follow me carefully I
[2:12:06] don't want to lose you when they heard
[2:12:09] that there was bread right my

[2:12:16] again um from verse I believe 8 or9
[2:12:22] and no verse six let's go then she Naomi
[2:12:27] with her who her daughters-in-law both
[2:12:29] of them that she what return from the
[2:12:32] country of Moab so they all arose to
[2:12:36] return to the country of what Moab for
[2:12:38] she have heard in the country of Moab
[2:12:42] how that the Lord has what visited his
[2:12:45] people in giving them what
[2:12:47] bread that bread was that spiritual
[2:12:50] bread no sir no it was what physical
[2:12:52] bread so there was a the Lord sent a
[2:12:56] blessing yes into Israel a
[2:13:01] Revival brother I'm saying of bread was
[2:13:04] going on in Israel and that Revival was
[2:13:08] producing more bread amen amen amen and

[2:13:27] Revival amen amen of natural
[2:13:32] bread amen amen to take care of the body

[2:13:54] who is right and who is wrong the fival
[2:13:58] of natural benefits that's right never
[2:14:02] will give you the the difference between
[2:14:06] the right
[2:14:07] seed and the wrong seed the wrong seed
[2:14:11] also love benefits am that's right
[2:14:16] that's right amen are we together amen
[2:14:19] that's why Jesus said the re
[2:14:21] fall on the just and the unjust and
[2:14:25] brother Bram say when the rain fall the
[2:14:28] tears praise the Lord and the we also
[2:14:31] praise the Lord amen so by the operation
[2:14:34] of the rain you don't really know who is
[2:14:39] who unless you look at the
[2:14:42] fruit but if you listen to them this one
[2:14:46] is saying praise the Lord this one is
