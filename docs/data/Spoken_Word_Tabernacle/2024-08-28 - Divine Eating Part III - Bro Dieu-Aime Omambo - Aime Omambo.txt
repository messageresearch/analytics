both visible and invisible audience you know Wednesday it's our convention so loseing up a little bit and let's pull on the gift of the Lord and hear from the Holy Spirit tonight amen sometime you sing song on Wednesday that belong to the sermon on Sunday right Lily so you know what it means right brother John you know what it means right you know right so you know what to do on Sunday and you're going to back it up Sister you that blood is powerful amen it is not you that did it it's sin that did it now you got the clarity you need to know who you are if not the devil will continue to trouble you all the time and pull you down by this flesh but inside of you you love God you are children of the Lord you don't mean to do bad you are just trapping the body that is waiting for Redemption therefore there is no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh amen but after the spirit of the Lord you pray so that Lord's willing on Sunday we're going to dig now deeper and to see where you are and you will understand the power of the blood and that will remove any doubt from you and you will know that when you're talking to God you are The Offspring of God Amen to begin with we are computer programmed by God I can prove it to you it took brother Bram to explain this and to remove all the confusion all around amen the way we are wir we are computer we have trained the body we have trained the spirit but we never were trained in the Soul because the soul is a different entity and religion got into it to try to train the soul and confuse the soul now when we say faith everybody think on their own thing what is Faith sometime he works sometime he doesn't work why is he working sometime and sometime it's not working there are stuff that are hidden right there I'm not the one preaching amen why is he working sometime why you pray and he work why you pray sometime he doesn't work that's true Lord's willing we need to go back to the prayer of Jesus Christ amen and you will see why what is going on Amen it takes a prophet if not even in this message sometime we say I have faith I have faith I have faith and something happened boom you Bast start you start crying right did you really have faith but when Faith really comes it's because the soul is a complete different complex entity that was never been touched until the Prophet come and the seals are broken amen that's the only way you can get to the soul amen we train everything we never train the soul the soul is you but it's a powerful you that doesn't work with you it works a different way amen amen glory glory glory to God so remember Romans 7 and go to Roman 8 and then no condemnation then we can manifest the son of man and then when we do it we getting ready for the body change amen glory to God I'm not preaching in this convention I got a young preacher full of blood and full of energy Amen brother DM is going to preach today a full service he have been preaching 30 30 I say know now you grown up you need to take a full service so now take your time and pull on the gift of the Lord and let the Holy Spirit speak to us tonight amen I got to keep my young preacher moving on quickly so they can get on fire amen let's go we fly [Music] believe oh [Music] all things are [Music] possible only [Music] all things [Music] are Lord I [Music] believe I [Music] believe I believe all things are possible Lord I [Music] believe I believe oh I all things [Music] are amen God bless you Saints I believe we're all doing good tonight yes I'm pray sure all of y'all like weren't your heart burning when you're listen to the gospel to the music and hopefully it keeps burning as we're bringing forth the word let us go to God In Prayer first our heavenly father thank Lord God for protecting each individual one of us thank for bringing us up and out Lord Jesus Christ to come here into your house to receive the word Lord God may you be the one speaking through me Lord God may not be me but may be you Lord God you Lord Jesus CHR be also the one listening to your people Lord God Lord Jesus Christ your scripture says Lord Jesus Christ do not premeditate what to speak but when the hour come Lord God may you be the person to speak Lord just that you just speak on what you reveal Lord God I leave everything onto you in Jesus Christ name I pray amen hello and if we could go to First King Chapter 19 Verse 5 if you're there can you say amen amen now first king first king chapter 19 verse5 says and as he lay and slept under a Jenifer tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat and he looked and behold there was cake bacing on the co and he Cruise of what and a cruise of water at his head and he did eat and drink and laid him down again and the angel of the Lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat because the journey is great and because the journey is great for thee and he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of that meat 40 days and 40 nights onto her up the Mount of God may the Lord God bless the reading of his word last time we also read in first in John chapter 4 verse 32 and we spoke about how Jesus the disciples asked him um did he eat and he said that he did eat and they asked what type of food did you eat and Jesus said that the food that he ate was um the will of God to do the will of God that's the type of food that he ate and the prophet of God said the journey that Elijah Was preparing was for a tribulation was representing tribulation and we're talking about how we're trying to find out what type of food that is so without Ado I'm going to talk about Divine eating part three going beyond your limit I didn't really think I was going to do three parts for the Lord God knows now last time when we spoke we spoke about how you can't serve God and Mayon you can't be you may be seated we spoke about how you can't you can't um divide your mind you can't worship God and worship man at the same time you can't worship God and worship the world and the prophet even gave an analogy of a deaf blind man who stood for God Al he was deaf and then we also got into how what you eat is what identifies you and what you eat is what also strengthens you and we also typed it with uh the armor of God that when you're eating spiritually it strengthens your Spiritual armor and not only does it strengthen your your Spiritual armor it helps you prevent certain attacks of the devil and he also helps you so you can fight the um the devil when they come so he helps you to pre to prevent it as in in a defensive aspect and he also helps you attack on off off and then we talked about how Through Your Eyes what you look at what you hear and all that it goes He feeds your inner man it feeds your your spiritual man and everything that you do goes into the heart and it's not what what goes in that defiles man but what comes out and we also spoke about how what the only thing good inside a man's heart is God and where we stopped that was at healing because people when they hear healing they just tend to think about the physical body and I want to pick up from that uh from where we left off on healing because as I was studying the scripture because we got to the part where healing also means correcting correcting of character and when I was reading in second king it was in second king verse second king chapter 5 when Elisha the king of Syria came to him King nonon came to Elisha and after that he was sick he was suffering from leprosy and then Elijah didn't like take him and after that started healing him and pray for him so he can heal automatically he sent out his word and when he sent out his word the word that God gave him and the King when the king received that word and he obeyed the word his sickness left him and when the pastor or anyone that has um that's under authority of the Lord God and he's bringing forth the word of God when that word comes forth and is's telling you to do a certain things and you do it it shall also deliver you not only deliver you from your uh physical sickness but from your spiritual sickness also and it took it took uh the king of Syria seven dips into Jordan which Jordan represents separation he took him seven dips into the Jordan so he can be completely clean and we found out that the word of God that comes that comes to correct and remove when it comes to correct removes the bad things from us little by little and I wanted to connect it with uh what brother Brenham said in 1961 jary 8 in Revelation chap 4 part 3 he says now let's take Matthew 10 verse one and when he called unto him his 12 disciples he gave them power oh just pacify the baby just a minute now just listen listen close and gave them power against unclean spirits many pastors just let the unclean Spirit stay right in his church women dress ax card cart parties Bunko games dances soap serer every oh mercy against unclean Spirit to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of diseases see when God when God sent out uh send his disciples with he gave them power to send them out he said to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of diseases that mean because some some people have different characteristic that like different habits I I could say they have different habits that they do and to them it's like normal but and some people like um there's no cure for habits that's what people thinktime they said there's no cure for habits oh that habits is just the way I am or it's the way God built us but we found out even last Sunday when God came when they uh when the prodal saw rather when he went and after he sin he came back with his complex he came back talking about his sin what he did and then the father said he came and that started tell he was trying to remove the sin out of him by telling him that you're my son but he kept saying but I have sinned I have sinned and when the when the message was coming forth I remember uh a revelation Job saying that we're not going to enter into Heaven until our Amnesia is removed until all of our sin is removed God already paid this God already paid the price for us he already died on the cross so technically our sin is already removed all you have to do is just claim that claim that Victory claim that Clement I have to do just claim it and when you claim it then every like your race already started once you claim it you just keep moving forward and the word of God when it comes yes it comes correct but it's also a type of washing it's also a Tope of watching and this was actually the last quote that we stopped at it says it says so we just sing until the last one is singed out and then Jesus will come how do we know who they are you just throw the gospel net and throw it that's why I come here with my brethren stand on the corner somewhere and throw the net with them reach out with my Ministry and pull it out and pull it and say there they are bre what is it now but this is the burn over territory did you notice back there when I first come to you in Oregon people were people was coming from everywhere thousands time thousands couting in oh it was fine it was I was just going along praying for the sick but when I come back and begin to lay the truth down laying the gospel down oh many turned turned aside right compare that with the days gone by with our Lord when he was Healing The Sick and The Afflicted many people come to him and when he fed 5,000 many people came right but when he began to sit down and tell them the truth what happened all of them began to turn away he be even the 70s even turn you see when the word comes people tend to get hurt one of the um one of the main key points that I remember ever since our church first began when the word was coming forth he said whenever a word comes and you don't understand it just say Amen if it's in the Bible and it's in the message say Amen if you don't understand it just say Amen later on it will come yes sir later on later on the revelation will come to you in due time and the other thing that was the first one the second was if the word is coming and it's hurtful and it it hurts you don't just get up and leave just stay there and the more you stay there it's going to change you slowly and slowly just stay there don't just get up and leave because people tend because of our natural flesh we don't like to be corrected we don't like to feel pain we don't like to be hurt there's a lot of people when the moment they see something that's going to hurt them they automatically start backing away out of it's like out of instinct sir and I'm really thankful that the Lord God sent out his word lately so he can Purge that little complex and that characteristic of us in in 1957 the lamb and the dog brother brandom said oh brother I know it's um sickening to you but my Mom this is actually um when brother brandham used to eat and after that he would get like a skin outbreak their mother would give them castoral and brother Brandon would tell his mom he would tell his mom well that gets me sick it hurts my stomach and everything now this is this is um brother Brandon's mom responding to brother Brandon telling her telling her oh it makes my stomach sick she says she said honey if it doesn't make you sick it doesn't do any good to you so maybe I'll apply that to the gospel tonight if it doesn't steer the church up and make you a little sick and ashamed of yourself it might it might not do you too much good what we need today is The Good Old Time Gospel cleaning that's that's exactly right taking all the world out of the church and putting Christ back on the throne of the heart now if you would like to have the dove of God to come to your heart tonight you say brother brandom I used to have those feelings I used to just love to pray I used to love to talk about the Lord but I've got to a place where I don't want I don't want them to talk to me about it oh I go to church now and then because I don't want to go to hell but but you're you're sure not making a very good this brother Bri talking you're sure you're sure not making a very good act to keep away from it as in keep keep away from hell that's right you say I would like to be back now I'm not I'm not I preached hard to you tonight and scold you but look brother it's for your good that's right it's for your good it's to help you I love you see last time we also spoke about how correct is also love because the Bible says correction is love and a child of dis like a child of disobedient doesn't like correction they run away from correction and and brother brandom saying that if it doesn't hurt you that mean it's not doing anything to you there's a lot of people that just come to church just to feel comfortable just to sit down and feel comfortable just to help have people baby them into their emotion it's kind of like I remember seeing online an article or so were there are psychiatrist and stuff like that instead of attacking the issues especially when it comes to like um people with their gender dys phobia or gender identity crisis instead of targeting and telling them that that's a disorder that's not normal they start just just because they want the money they start just babing them to it they start complimenting complimenting them to it and it just start sugarcoating it instead of giving them the real truth and expecting and then the person goes over there expecting to change expecting to be given something that will make them change and recover but they can't recover because those people those psychiatrists are just feeding them the wrong thing um I'd like to go to like TI up with the Bible also in Ephesians chapter 5 verse 26 6 to 27 says that he might be Sanctified and cleansed with it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or or wrinkle or any such thing but that it it should be holy and without blemish see over here it's saying that the word of God when it comes it comes to sanctify comes to remove the spots and wrinkles that those represents your sins and all those things it it represents your complex all those uh habits that you've built up the Holy Spirit comes to remove all those thing that way he can present to himself that way he can present to himself a virtuous bride a glorious bride it want a bride without spot or wrinkle I'd also like to take Ezekiel chapter 36 verse 25 the Bible says then I will sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you see it's it's not not just because the word of God when it comes it doesn't just STS by cleaning you it's not in fact the scripture is not talking about cleaning you physically like washing your skin and removing dirt it's talking about removing filthiness as in your bad habits removing Idols that mean your ideologies that you have of worshiping the wrong um God not their lord God the Creator if a new heart also will I give you and the new spirit will I put in you and I will take away the Stony heart heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh see God is removing our old because that heart of us is wicked because the Bible also says that men thinks they're right in their own heart and and men are evil in their own heart and in verse 32 it says not for your sake do I do this this is God talking to uh us he said not for your sake that it's not by your will by your work or anything that you've done but it's by God sayth the Lord God be it known unto you be ashamed and confounded for your own ways because when we when God let us do what we wanted to do we faed even in Eden when we did we when we're left to our own accord we ended up falling for sin and he said not so we can be confounded in our own ways or House of Israel because Israel when when God when God had let Israel be uh by himself he let he let Israel because God was guiding Israel then at some point Israel wanted to guide himself they started asking God oh can can we can you appoint a king for us and after they appointed soul and then so fought failed from God and soul started disobeying um disobeying the Commandments of God just because of popularity I would also like to take second Timothy Chapter 2 verse1 15 it says study to show yourself study to show thyself approved unto God a Workman needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth but but sh profane and vain babbling for they will increase onto more ungodly mess see the scripture of here it says to study the scripture to prove yourself because if you study the scripture you would know how to rightfully the the scripture you would know how to rightly take it break it down and after that let the Lord God like reveal it to you scripture by scripture excuse me reveal it to you scripture by scripture which reminds me of uh a time I was seeing a lot of people they were talking about how oh you know those people that have their own wrong ideology of the their own interpretation of the Bible and some of them were saying Jesus is black and stuff like that and that was just laughing I didn't want to debate or anything and they saw and someone saw me laughing and that they came to me and they were like but he is and that I was like no he's not but then they I asked them can you show me where it says it and they brought me the Book of Revelation I started laughing I was like did you even read it thoroughly because even in the first paragraph it said these signify meaning it's a representative it's showing you that when he says Jesus his face resonated it was talking about like his hair resonating it's white as well it was talking about the Judgment like him coming as a judge and then which reminds me when I went to the scripture I mean to the prophet to the message Rebecca had went to school U brother bram's daughter had went to school and then the school taught her about how the Earth was made millions and millions of years old and then she came and that started talking to brother brandham telling brother brandham the school had taught has taught us that they had proven to us that the Earth was made billions and billions and billions of years old and brother brandom since he studied the scripture and he knows the scripture he took just the first uh two verse or so the first verse of the Bible he started speak talking about Genesis he was like in Genesis 1:1 it said God created it the the Heaven and the Earth and between that and when God started creating the days there was a period of time there it could have been millions of millions of um ages it could have been trillions of trillions of time that mean science was not uh what's it called was not disproving the Bible in any sort of way that's what brother BR was showing like was revealing was saying that everything that they were doing they it's not like it's contradicting the Bible because Rebecca came to brother brandham because she clear because she clearly because she clearly had um she had thoughts that as SC have probably told her that oh the Bible is wrong and this this this this because they did not study the Bible and they did not have the right revelation of the Bible so they couldn't divide the Bible rightly as the scripture says and you can also find that uh when Rebecca has talked to brother BR you can find that 1962 the spoken word is the Original Seed in 1961 Revelation um chapter 4 paragraph 158 part three brother Bram says oh I wouldn't oh wouldn't that make a sermon right now doctor oh my wouldn't that wouldn't that just is Strike me watch them before any SE any sacrifice is is just received is just received to God it's first got to be washed oh how not emotionally but Washed by the word could you go back and get where this Jewish rabbi when I was preaching on the sermon of the water separation the red he Waters that kept up that they were made and Waters of separation and before we can ever come to God with true faith we first got to come By the Waters of Separation yes sir you've got to come by what the the word the word is the water of Separation as as in when the word comes for and you take the word it's separating you see when um Elisha had sent his word to the king it's not that the word talk the King and that started dragging him to go to the Jordan it's not that that's not what happened when the word came forth and the King received the word the king automatically started separating himself he went and started dipping himself it's not the word literally dragging you it's because you're receiving the word by eating the word is chipping away those little comple complex the more you reside with the word the more you're like becoming the word now some true Waters some some through Waters some through floods some through deep trials but all through the blood that's that's God's way of leading his people and over here brother BR says compare compare that with the days gone by with our Lord over here it says and he said to his disciple will you go and Peter made this state those statement the great words that said to whom shall we go see but now that didn't stop his Mir his miracles he went right on and and a few days after that he opened the Man's eyes that didn't even have eyeballs in his sockets those Miracles got greater but the crowds got less and he became more or less Popular until they um crucified him on the cross see when the word come forth some people may leave the church the church may get small for a little while the church may get small but the Miracles inside the church would keep growing and keep growing and keep growing just as even when this church was first started there was a lot of people even because I came in when most of the people that was a part of I guess the old church were already left but as the words start coming in as the words start removing our complexes start removing the way we think our ideology and everything certain people started leaving because they didn't like the way the word was coming forth because because their body just didn't like it they didn't feel comfortable and instead of just residing so they can grow and learn from it they're not residing and growing from it Peter when the word came forth and many people were leaving Peter came in and said to whom shall we go because this is life that mean if the word of God is coming and the word of God is life and the word of God is speaking to you and is telling you that you need to change where else would you go if that's life if that's the way to the gate where else would you go now in Amos chapter 8 verse 11- 12 says behold the days come sayth the Lord God that I will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst of water but of hearing the words of the Lord God the um the words of the Lord and they shall Wander from sea to Sea and from the north even to the east they shall run to and fro and seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it see the scripture doesn't say that oh there will be a famine or food and everything because even in our house we have stored food inside our house but he say that we it will be a famine of the word the word of God because as you can see the famine because the famine as um the famine also represent tribulation because in Tribulation the word of God won't be there and why won't it be there because the bride also won't be there and right now God is already removing ministers one by one like uh a few months ago Pastor barudi went Pastor Edward Frank was also lifted up from the earth that's God removing the gospel little bit by little bit and the famine is slowly creeping in into the world until there's until the whole bride will be lifted up after the whole entire Earth will be lefted with a famine even in uh Hosea 4:6 it says my people perish my people are destroyed by lack of knowledge and they rejected the knowledge of God that's why God also rejected them and um in the end time in 1962 in 1962 the end time evangelism brother Bram says now we're going to we're going to end right here by saying this the anti message is to get the bride ready and prepar for the Rapture what can it do according to Malachi 4 is bringing is bringing them back to the faith that was once delivered to the Saints bringing them back to the faith of the fathers the Pentecostal part in the restoration time I will restore says the Lord the that's the real event end time evangelism now I just want to say these couple words before I close I bypass the rest of these scripture and maybe sometime I can get to them but I want to say this we believe we're in the end time we believe it and though it seems like at the end time at this time as in this time that the message and the messenger both is about broke looks like Satan has tried his best to rim wreck us brother nille brother Neville his accident brother CRA there and gone blowing it see it looks like right now when every church out through there is thumbs down on me and see see it looks like it it's just about broke looks like we're defeated but don't worry you know it's usually at the end time it's it's usually at that time when God steps in on the scene and sometime he's been watching for a long time you remember and brother brandham also says that the Sadducees and the Pharisees they they had thought they caught Jesus when they um crucified Jesus but it was at that time when they thought that they they um caught Jesus that's when Jesus rose again see even brother brenon preached the sermon of perfect strength by Perfect witness because God is made strongest when we're weak that mean when the famine is growing in when the famine is cripping in and yes you may feel a little weak yes you may feel a little bit hungry but the word when you're eating and feeding on the word that word will give you strength because Jesus Christ went through the um through famine he went not to F but he went to um fasting for 40 days and 40 nights and when he came out the devil started tempting him the devil thought just because that's his weak State he could have won but that was actually when when God was strongest and he started saying it is written it is written it is written and you cannot Test the Lord God your God and over here brother B also says that it was when Jacob had wrestled against I mean when Jacob had rested all night until his strength was gone and he was crippled and he was weak and his body was broken up it was at that time when God come riding in on the scene the next morning we find him what a Fearless Prince after this weakness it looked like he was defeated but we find him a Fearless Prince the message was going on and the messenger was with it that's exactly right he was a Fearless Prince right the other day see that's also like the message that was coming forth last Sunday when he was talking about that yes we are Gods but we shall die like Prince and we're not going to die until we achieve our um our status of a prince you see it's when we're low is yes if you're you're battling and it looks like everything is uh going very hard and it looks like you're not going to win but it's at that time that you should clinge onto the word of God even longer you should cling onto the word of God even harder because that's when God will actually [Applause] work but until that day until that day like if you go to uh first king chapter 18 yes sir First Chapter 19 Verse 18 it says yet I have left me 7,000 in Israel all the knees which have not bowed onto bow and every mouth which hath not kissed him see that mean Al to they age because earlier um earlier in if you go to First Kings chapter 19: 10 and 14 Elijah was talking to God saying that oh I'm very jealous of you God because people have turned away from your commandment and people are have killed and persecuted um your prophets and they're even looking to kill me and see the people has deviated away from the commandment and after there's already the famine that's already cripping in you see but if you and then at verse 18 when you go to verse 18 the Lord God says that there was he saved himself a group of 7,000 and I believe that this night that group of 7,000 in this laian age is also part we spoken word are also part of that 7,000 you see God God Al there's um Al there's a famine Al there's ministers going here and there like in Joshua um chapter 1 verse 1-2 Eli Moses came in and Moses was taken up when Moses was taken up that's not where God ended God did not stop where Moses went God took a Joshua Ministry to lead the people into the land see as ministers are being lifted up up out of the earth God is also bringing young ministers that are rising up in this message that can preach his message you see I would like to go um I know there's a lot of scripture reading today but just bear with me but it's the word of God nonetheless is here to help you in Romans 11: 1-5 he says I say then have God Cast Away his people God forbid for I also am an Israelite of the Seed of Abraham of The Tribe of Benjamin God hath not Cast Away his people with which he fornew what ye not what he what the scripture sayth of Eli Elias how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying Lord they have killed thy prophets and digged down thy Altar and I am left I am left alone and they seek my life but what say the what say the answer of the the answer of God unto him I have reserved to myself 7,000 men who have not bowed to the knee to the image of bow see in this laition age God has saved himself a church not just church but many churches because we also have sister churches that are standing with us with this Gospel of brother Brandon when people are rejecting it when people are are speaking ill of it and people are rejecting it just saying that oh he's not the messenger see so much time has gone by and this this this this this but God has kept himself God has kept himself a group of people here that still believes on the UN indoctrinated word of God you see that's why the prophet of God also says in 1953 12113 he says that but I have food that I eat that the world knows nothing about and your spirit coming to me in faith believing what I'm telling you is true is the food that I leave on that's my eternal life if I don't feed this natural man I'll die and if I don't feed their spiritual man I'll die now our brother scientist sitting here would know that EV that would know that anything that doesn't eat very much and just keeps going dieting dieting dieting your stomach strengths and then if you become eating a whole lot your stomach you require more you see I sure I sure am a gluttony on this I tell you I really require a whole lot of it because I am c i my capacity just has no limit you see of here because this also remind me of an article because there are certain people that like certain tribes they have their own custom of feeding um of like it's ideal for them to look big and they have this little custom of feeding people for six months and they will feed them they will feed them food so they can get big and in the first week when they're feeding the people of like the people of that culture in the first week the children will start vomiting because it's beyond their limit but as they kept doing it weeks go by weeks go back their stomach start enlarging and their stomach as it start enlarging now they can withstand that capacity that they were giv them you see that's why the prophet God says I've often said if I was just a little bigger maybe I could feel better you know if I if it was I don't know how it could cont how it could contain it I believe we'll have I believe we'll have to have a Immortal body to contain it I think of what what about what about it friend see brother is talking about oropy we'll have oropy that will be able to contain all this word because even me when I'm meditating after the Revelation is coming sometime I feel like my physical body cannot cannot like contain that Revelation I feel like my brain is going to overload with the Revelation that's coming forth and I believe brother Brandon was also speaking about that he also felt sometime that he might get overwhelmed because of his physical body and he said I believe will have a Immortal body body to contain it now I want to speak about grinding because if you go by the dictionary of grinding grinding means to break something down but grinding also if you're a student or a gamer I'm not promoting gaming because game to me anybody that makes a profession out of gaming is like a professional clown but anyways a student grinding to them it means to study to study hard and to study and to study to become someone to study to improve to become better you see there are times where both for those that at least that was G that was a gamer or whatever and those that are students if you look at a student and when they're studying it's usually yes there are times where they study with um their peers but most of the time they're studying by themselves and most of the time when they're studying by themselves you're not going to see them studying there that's them eating it's kind of like um Elijah when he was speaking with God in the cave Elijah was over there by himself Elijah was feeding on the word by himself you see just the same thing with the students and I would like to uh tie with 2 Corinthians chapter 3:3 where it says that for as much as ye manifest declared for as much as ye are man manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in the tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart see it says that we're written Epistles and we're not just written EP pistol by by other men or by other ideology but by God himself God himself was the one that wrote it God himself was the one who chose to make us a written epistle and not just the written epistle as in like having had knowledge but knowing the scripture in the flesh knowing making it become real not it just staying in history or staying in the books by it becoming a living because it says the spirit of the Living God that's right and in second Titus verse 2 verse5 says second second Timothy verse 2 verse 5 says and if any man also strive from uh masteries yet is he not crowned except he strive lawfully see over here it's talking it says the see over here it's saying that if you're going through tribulation and you're working hard like a student that's grinding that's studying um that's studying for a degree if you're working right rightfully will you not uh obtain your degree that Crown will you not obtain your degree now you take that and you apply it to the word now if you're grinding the word you're eating the word you're feeding on the body of Jesus Christ because the word is God if you're feeding on God will you not receive your crown will you not receive your glory will you not receive your theophany and be next to to God because in Revelation talks about our reward will be seated with God in the in the um Kingdom that's right in second Corinthians chap 4: 16-8 says for which cause we faint not but though our outward men perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light if Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal which is saying when when a student is working and they're not looking at the things because a student at the time that they're studying they're not at a certain level but as they have the vision of what they want to become they're looking at what is not seen you see they're looking at their goal they're looking at something that that that they don't have yet and and the Bible is saying to amen the Bible is telling us that for our light Affliction that mean the little trial that you're studying it's just a little bit of work that you have to do but when you obtain That Glory when you obtain that Eternal Body when you obtain or when you obtain that degree you're not going to you can look back and you be like well that was light work that affection that was feeling wasn't that hard you see amen and in 1960 December 25th the prophet of God said there's nothing too good for Jesus there's nothing too good for Jesus give him your best give him everything you got your life your soul your being your time all that you have you see give it to him see it's saying when you like when you're a student when you're going through trial just give it your all because see what what separates um in New and a pro a Pro Gamer or a student and a teacher or even an immature God and God is the fact that you have to give your all to achieve that level you have to you have to study study study until you arrive to that to that um to that goal that you that you see but you don't literally see you see that goal that you're achieving to obtain amen and I believe that the bride today as we're feeding on the word of God as we're studying and as we're feeding and grinding on the word of God there will be one day where the bride of Christ will be like will shine like the sun of the light of seven days that's right amen amen and if we can go to two Peter two Peter chapter chapter two I mean chapter chapter one verse 1-7 the Bible says Simon Peter a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteous of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of Jesus Christ and of through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our savior see it's saying that Grace and peace will be multiplied unto you and how will it be multiply onto you through the knowledge not just any knowledge but saying the knowledge of God the knowledge of Jesus Christ that's how Grace and peace will be multiplied onto you that mean if you want peace in your life and you want Grace in your life just you just have to feed on the knowledge of God you see Accord according as his divine power have given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness to the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue see everything that you need to live a Godly life God has already given to you and how did God give it to you God say he has given you that through the knowledge of him that called us to glory and virtue which is speaking about Jesus Christ and whereby are are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escape the the corruption that is in the world through through lust see the world the world is corrupted and the Bible says corrupted through lust to their strong desires of the wrong thing of sin but verse five then he says and besides this giving all diligence that mean giving all preeminence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity you see and we know that faith faith is God every everything on this pyramid is God himself and we'll get to that faith is God he said that um uh what's it called it says that Faith how do you gain Faith how does one gain Faith he says that Faith cometh by the hearing of the word and it doesn't just say any type of word by the word of God and when Jesus came down he said that he he and the father is one and the Bible says that Jesus was the word of God as it says in Genesis one in John 1: and then virtue speaks about your morality you see it speaks about your moral principles right and wrong and it says to add onto your faith virtue and then virtue knowledge knowledge because the Bible says that my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge and to not perish to not be destroyed you need to have knowledge and then knowledge Temperance which is like self um restrainment then to Temperance patience which James chap 5 says behold we count them happy which endure ye have heard that the patient of job have seen an end that the end of the Lord because God had doubled everything job had after he endured God doubled everything he has and then to Patient godliness and godliness which in in Titus it says that the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness in other words recognizing the truth brings godliness you see and then from godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness when I was thinking about this I was like brotherly kindness excuse me brotherly kindness when I was thinking about brotherly kindness I was like what is brotherly kindness like how do you know uh you have brotherly kindness or what is it and I remember in Luke chapter 10 like verse 25-37 you can read it at home Jesus was like tempted by his student or so he came to Jesus asking Jesus how do I obtain eternal life and Jesus said what does the law say about eternal life and after that the man the man told Jesus well the law says to to love uh God with all your being and to love your neighbors as you love yourself and after there Jesus told him then go do so then he tried to try Jesus again and after he said well how do I know which one is my neighbor then Jesus gave him the parable of the Good Samaritan and after the parable of the Good Samaritan God Jesus asked him so like why have you learned from this and after that he said that our neighbors is the one that shows Mercy Mery and that's Jesus said go do this which remind me from time to time when when when uh what's it called when I used to um when there was days that I wouldn't come to when I would have come to church because something was holding me brother Kelly would come in that that he would sit me outside that talk to me that that kind of scold me and that that uh scold me and ask me what's wrong and that that tells me and encourages me and try to find out what's wrong that was brotherly kindness right there because the scripture also says as iron sharpens iron shall a brother sharpen another brother you see and you don't just sharpen another brother just by uh talk to them and stuff like that but you also have to give them the word the word of God that's how you're going to sharpen one another you have to correct them by the word also and 1965 October 31st the power of transformation brother Bram says and to think that you can come apart and gather like this where as the psalmist said which was in Psalm 133 verse one brother Bron was reading saying behold now sweet and pleasant for Brethren to dwell together in unity it's like the ointment oil it's like the anointing oil that was on Aaron's beard that ran to the H of His Garment that we know that oil represent the Holy Ghost and it's and brother when he was talking about that he said that it's sweet for brother as he was reading the scripture he said that it's sweet for as the scripture say it's sweet for brothers to dwell together and that it's like the anointing oil going down on Aaron's beard and if you ever have like oil for those I don't have the beard but for those that have one if you are when you have like oil going through your hair or something like that it's hard to separate it and you can even take when we have question answer meetings it's hard for brothers to separate it's hard for us to even div because we want to dwell and just eat the word and just keep talking about the word and even even if you're tired when you come and that you are fellowshipping with um the brothers you will feel like your strength is coming to you and you just don't want to separate from it and brother Bram says which you know what the anointing oil done it preserves him to go in the presence of God see he had the anointed with he had to be Anointed with the oil before he went in the presence of God and when Brethren can dwell together Unity is like likened onto the oil we then enter into the presence of the Lord with the anointing of Brethren together in unity oil all the oil represents the Holy Ghost yes sir and you can um in 1956 in August 14 paragraph 6 brother B also speaks about uh how how you got to be loyal and honest with one another brotherly love and then God will bless you you see you have to be loyal and honest with one another and God will bless you and there's even a scripture that says that you have to confess your um your sins you have to confess your faults you have to confess your stuff to one another to your brethren and after that God will bless you God will heal you you receive healing through death and I'd like to like show that also in the scripture I don't want you just to take my words for it but I would also like to show you that brotherly kindness in the scripture if we can go to James James chap James chapter 5 verse 16 says that's actually the scripture that I was referring to confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed and effect and effectual fervant prayer for the righteous man ath much you see and after that in G galatian he also says that in galatian he also says like galatian 6:1 it talks about how we shouldn't be egotistical you see it talks about how we shouldn't be egotistical but to support one another to carry one another as the scripture say Brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness consider considering themsel considering thy s lest thou also be tempted bear ye one another's burden and also fulfill the law of Christ for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing be deceived himself that mean don't think of yourself above your brother but you're supposed to help one another and you're supposed to help one when I'm saying help one another I'm just yes you can help one another in the physical but also help them in the spiritual aspect also if you say a brother doesn't understand something or let's say a person the word came for for that they say the word says not to do this or the word says to do this this this and this and after that you see that brother is having a hard time to understand that to grasp the word and God has revealed it to you it's up to you to take it and bring it to the brother that they tell them you say brother this is not right the word says this this this this or you should be doing this this this this and this you see am and and then there's Grace which is like the Capstone of it all and when I was p this Grace love love is God you see the scripture says so the scripture says so when I was thinking about love I was like what is love like what type of Love Are there what type of love has God manifested for us and and it thought came was about Reckless Love Like The Reckless Love of God coming down I don't think many people understand like that Reckless Love because if you even take a moment and look even in our humanistic realm when someone is of a high high sture and that they're trying to marry someone of a lower stature people are saying that oh you're going to belittle yourself you're losing your dignity or you will be cast out of the family if you do something like that when it comes to royalty see but when someone that truly loves someone even if you're in a high standard some people will risk losing that high standard just to go in there see The Reckless Love of God God being God he was all the way in the seventh Dimension he decided to come down to our Dimension just to teach us how we're supposed to act and how we're supposed to be just to teach us and feed us the word and he didn't only stop there after coming down from his Dimension he also went down to the lowest Dimension which was hell and he took the keys from the devil not only did he took the keys from the devil he also freed the saints that were in um Paradise see that that when people look at that they would be like why would God do that why would God leave a place where he was comfortable a place where he's all powerful just to come down and save someone that's as little as us you see God came down and invested himself in us see that's the Reckless Love of God which remind me that's the Reckless Love of God it's like one time there was a fire in the house and then my father came in and he told everybody to leave and after he took two wooden stick and carried a pot which was burning and took it outside the door and put it outside he he ended up having a burn but see he risked his life just to save ours he risked his life that's the same thing Jesus did Jesus came down and Spilled his blood spilled his blood on the cross and went all the way to hell just to save us and then there's also the mercy love of God because when I received that revelation of The Reckless Love of God the mercy love of God also came which represent Grace why because after Jesus resurrected he didn't just stop there he went up in heaven and after that went up in heaven that that splashed the blood on the book and took the book and came and gave it to us and he didn't give it to us because we were worthy of it but he just gave it to us out of his own Grace out of his Mercy he just gave it to us you [Applause] see and um in 1956 in the church and its condition paragraph 137 it was on August 8 brother Brandon says how many here that's backsliding oh you say I wouldn't admit that brother brandham but look if that Dove of meekness gone from you brother other there's something wrong there's something wrong when you can't bear with one another when you can't forgive every person from every death of your heart no matter what they've done or what they've said if you can't forgive them for the death Jesus said if you don't forgive every man his trespasses from your heart neither does your heavenly father forgives you and then brother br also say in the um the statute of a perfect man says so when you surren you surrender completely when you surrender when you surrender your complete being then the Holy Spirit just pours through you in The Virtue then you're a living Tabernacle then people look out and say that's a man full of virtue they say that's Man full of virtue that's a man full of knowledge he's believing the word Temperance patient godliness brotherly kindness fullness fullness the full of the Holy excuse me brotherly kindness full of the Holy full of the love of the Holy Ghost see there he is walking around what is it the stat the stature that unbelievers can look at and and say there is a Christian there is a man or a woman who knows what they're talking about you never seen a Kinder sweeter go godlier person you're sealed it seal shows on both side whether you're going or coming you see this seal just the same there you are see when a man or a woman possesses this then the Capstone comes down and seals them into the kingdom of God which is the Holy Ghost then the word the word coming from here manifest itself through each one of these beings see and makes this complete being a tacle of the Living God a walking living example of Christianity what what Christ was these people are because his life is in here there are in Christ and their and their life is dead and head in Christ through God and the seal and sealed in there by the Holy Ghost 1 Corinthians 12 that's right see you reckon Yourself Dead than you're born of Faith then virtue than these other things is added on onto you till you're perfect that's right until you're a perfect living image of God that wonderful see for you to become more like God you need to feed on the word of God for you to become more like God you need to fit on the word of God for you to become more like the image of God you need to fit on the word of God you need to fit on the word of God and and for for once again for all these things if you don't have it if you don't have faith if you don't have virtue like I said God is all those things that's why the name Jehovah means I am that means God who is existing it also means I am becoming see God is all these things that's why he used the I am but if God is Not faith in your life if God is Not virtue or knowledge in your life just pray to God and ask him because like I said God is I am who has all these things but he's also I am becoming that mean if he's not knowledge in your life I'm not saying if he's not knowledge I'm saying if he's not knowledge in your life just pray to God and God will become knowledge in your life you see just pray to God and God will become virtue and faith in your life just pray to God just keep feeding on the word and God will become every single one of those things in your life if you don't have love just pray to God and keep feeding on the word of God because the Bible says God is love and if you're feeding on the word of God which says the word of God is God that mean you're feeding on love and you will end up having go you will end up having love God will become love in your life you seej if we could um go to SEC second Peter again now I'm going to start by verse 8 to9 or so it says the Lord knoweth how to deliver The Godly out of the Temptation and to reserve and to reserve chapter one first Peter I mean second Peter chapter 1 verse 9 but he that lath these things is blind and not see and cannot see a far off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling an election give diligence meaning give preeminence make your calling an election sure for if ye do these things you shall never fall that mean if you're if you have faith you won't fall if you have virtue you won't fall if you have knowledge you won't fall if you do all these things it doesn't just say if you do like one of them and after you stop you have to do all of those as the scripture say if you do these things you shall never fall for as an ENT shall be ministered unto you AB abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ see it say it will be ministered to the entrance will be Minister unto you that mean when the word is coming forth it's being it's the Gate of the Kingdom being preached unto you that's what it is wherefore I will not be NE negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things through you through ye know them and be established in the present truth see see over here it's saying that he won CE to tell you to keep eating the word he won't CE to tell you to keep feeding on the word just as the pastor every every uh church service tells you have you read your church age book have you done this have you read your scripture twice a day or whatnot see even I also won't stop keep telling you to feed on the word of God because by feeding on the word of God that's how you get closer to God see there's many people there's many people many souls in the six demension that are earning that are that are um that are Desiring they're waiting on us to finish our race they're waiting on us if you've ever noticed if you've ever watched a race like a relay race when when you pass the Baton you cannot talk to the person that's running until they finish with the race just like they're in the sixth sixth D sixth Dimension they finished their race not it's up to us to finish ours and we need to keep running we need to keep feeding on the word and the way for us to run our races is by us feeding on the word and not just feeding the word but when we're feeding the word we have to reproduce the energy that the word is giving it the energy that the word is giving us we need to reproduce that we don't not we don't need to just sit down and let that energy Stack Up and pile up and just sit down and just keep saying amen but we need to let that energy come out and be manifested and be a living a be be a living epistle be a living reality in our everyday life you see yes um and this one in 1958 brother brandham says Eagle food comes from the mouth of the feeder not some man-made theology but from the mouth of feeder which is Jehovah Eagle who feeds with his own word and the ego will never bring her babies anything that would hurt them oh I just love that God will never make a promise that you won't that he won't stand behind and every Eagle just loves to get a hold of the of that word he loves it he becomes it becomes because he loves it he loves it because it comes from the mouth of Jehovah Eagle he loves to receive it oh oh I seen the little ones Waiting For Mama to come up and they're all raised and hold their little mouth open ever what Mama brought up that's all right and that's the way that a True Believer is no matter what Dr John's said or what anybody else said if Jehovah put it in his word they believe it and they receive it doesn't matter how bitter it might be or how hard it might be or anything but if it's God's word just take it feed it and receive it and believe it you see the scientists can say the days of Miracles is passed and there is no such thing as Divine Healing the Holy Spirit only fell on the2 and the 120 oh but when Jehovah said it's for you and your children and to them that's far off even as many as the Lord or God shall call if they're called they'll eat you see if they're called they eat if it's like when it's dinner time when they call you will you not come and eat unless if you want to starve but if you're called you'll eat if you're the true seed of God you'll come and eat because because Jesus said my sheep know my voice when you're called when Jesus calls his sheep his sheep will come in and they and they will listen to him and come into to him you see so he has the special bird he has a special bird to take this food and he has to be made up to go into those atmosphere that's another thing about about him and then in order to get up there he has to have strong Wings ordinary bird is is his feathers would fly out of him cuz he can't stand when he can't when he gets up there but an old Eagle can SAR where another bird can't can't get a hundred yards off the ground without flopping himself to death you know that's right yes sir they're just beating the air and launch in an old crane or something pumping up and down and trying to ride the waves and staggering over where a eagle just sets his wings and rides on the Wave It's Fearless its feathers are strong they don't move they don't give they just maneuver his body and cells away that's the way every believer he does a run from pillar to to post from place to place a Methodist this week a Baptist next week and to W this this week and another one next week he just sets his faith in God's Eternal Word and sells away riding on the waves of riding on the waves on the of the air and in John 6 verse 48 Jesus Christ says I am the bread I am that bread of life this is the bread which cometh down from Heaven that a a man may eat therefore and not die I am the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and bread and and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life for the life of the world Jesus is saying that he is the manner that came down from heaven he's the manner that felt that if men eat you will not just eat but you have to truly receive him by eating and by truly receiving him by eating you won't die and we can also find this in uh Revelation when God came down and brought the book see that book was bread that book was the food for us when that book came down it it's when a man eats of it they're not going to die they're just going to switch Dimensions even if their body leaves them but their spirit is not dying their spirit is just switching demension their spirit is just transferring from one place to another place to get closer to God you see and brother BR says that but thanks be to God we got hidden food spiritual food that we're living on the goodness and mercy of the revelation of the revelation of Jesus Christ in this last day vindicating himself among his people amen they went in Elijah went in before the drought set in thank God for being in in before the Judgment sets in now it's time of coming out and going in getting out of those organization and getting into Christ and coming out and going in time for all True Believers then he was called and stayed in there remember he never left the brook until God called him to and notice there was a mill in the barrel every time she went after meal there was meal in the barrel there was meal there was oil in the Cruise every time she went for it why meal represent Christ in the meal offering their Birds had to be set just right to grind everyone every one of them every bird of this meal exactly the same showing that he is the same yesterday today and forever that was the word the bread of life following message to vindicate the word you see so it is today friends so it is today that the bread of life that the children eat follows follows the message of God to sustain them during the time of drought what if he stood in our presence today what if he stood in our presence right now he would act he would act and do just exactly like he done the day when he was in flesh here on the earth the bride is part of the husband and the the church is the same as Christ The Works that I do shall you do also and it is the word that done it he told us the things that he did that we would do also and even greater and if you um if you look even at Elijah and Elisha when Elijah when Elijah um when Elijah had the word with him because in the body of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ couldn't do as many miracles as he would because people lacked Faith they say Jesus was blocked because people like faith and if you look at the story of uh now Jesus in our body even in the body of Jesus of uh brother Bram Jesus done more miracles than he did in his time because there's more faith now than there was in his time you see and when I look at the story of Elijah and Elisha when Elijah multiplied the oil he multiplied it for like 3.5 years but if you look at Elisha in second king if you look at Elisha when he multiplied the oil the scripture said that the the um the Widow shall live with that oil with his son to the rest of their life see he multiplied oil for the rest of their life see they had unlimited oil for the rest of their life for Elijah hisid was limited but for Elisha it it went on all the way till the rest of their life just like Jesus when he came in he did what he needed to do his was limited and he sent down his holy spirit to finish it all the way to Eternity you see until we're done for the rest of our life here and until we merge with with um eternity until time merges within eternity in Proverbs 31:25 it says strength and honor are her clothing speaking about um the wise the wise woman strength and honor are her closing and she shall rejoice in time to come she openeth her mouth mouth with wisdom and in her mouth in her tongue is the law of kindness she lookth well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness you see for her to even speak for wisdom to come out of her mouth and for her to speak the law of kindness that means she must have being feeding on the law of kindness she must have been feeding on the law of kindness and and for her to and the Bible says she didn't just spend her mind think about Idol stuff and just wasting her time doing um nonsensical things you see even brother Bram say that the mind is like the Devil's Playground when you're a idol thought is the is the Devil's Playground and she did not spend her her time eating bread of idol that mean eating uh eating on other people's interpretation eating on other people's message but eating on the word of God that's why her mouth only wisdom came and we know that wisdom is God and the law of kindness is God himself if the musician could come forward uh so far we spoke Al I didn't really go in detail a lot but so far we spoke about how you see God when he comes and sends he wor like there was a period of time where his word was leaving his word is leaving because the famine is creeping in but even within that famine God still has reserved thousands of people thousands of his Believers rather that are dare that are dare to believe his word and I believe that this afternoon and this time at this time right now at this time right now I am part of that thousand of people that believe the word of God and I believe that this church is also part of that Ding that God reserved it didn't say that men Reserve but God himself reserved that thousand to testify of him because in every age there's always there's always a um there's always a witness and we spoke about how you need to for you to be in peace and have for you to have Grace and peace you need to uh you need to have it through the knowledge of God not through any type of knowledge but through the knowledge of God and you gain knowledge by by eating you gain knowledge by reading more because the Bible says my people perish for lack of understand understanding the lack of knowledge you see and they and it's because people don't eat in this time people don't eat a lot the word is becoming the word like the revealed word I'm not just saying the word the revealed word is becoming scarce because people are not taking their time to actually take to study the word right because there's a difference between just reading and just reading to reveal word with the revelation of Jesus Christ if we could bow our heart Lord heavenly father thank you Lord Jesus Christ for this opportunity that you've given us Lord Jesus Christ to come over here and fellowship around your word Lord God Lord Jesus Christ May these words that came out Lord Jesus Christ May when it goes forth Lord Jesus may you touch your people Lord God may you heal them may you help them Lord God if someone Lord Jesus Christ is struggling with something Lord Jesus Christ if they're having a hard time to swallow your word Lord God to eat your word Lord God may you Lord Jesus Christ help them may you give them strength to eat may you pull if you have to pull a brother in their life to help them Lord J God may you do so Lord God but may you use your word Lord God the words that came forth Lord God may you Lord just continue to unfold the revelation of the words that came for unto them Lord Jesus continue Min Minister onto them Lord Jesus Christ may you bless Lord Jesus Christ everybody else under the way everybody else in the time days taken Lord Jesus Christ when they're going to get home may you give them safe traveling mercies Lord and may you protect them for the remaining of the week and I pray that you may use Lord Jesus Christ that you may help me Lord Jesus Christ so I can heal myself more to you Lord God that way I can know how to Lord Jesus Christ bring forth your word better Lord God and I Abend in this sermon unto you in Jesus Christ's name amen [Applause] [Music] praise God amen amen you got something to take home right feed on the word of God Amen am you're an eager you need strength for your wings so the more you feed on the word more you get some spiritual vitamin and it will help you flop your wings and don't get uh in trouble when you way up in the air amen Oh Glory to God I love that scripture of second Peter where he says that peace and Grace Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge that's powerful right there amen we play with knowledge and God loaded unfolded his knowledge in this message and through the knowledge of that message that God gave us he will multiply Grace and peace unto you when you get a chance to read those two verses they're powerful the Bible say grace and peace be multiply unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according to according as his divine power has given us on to has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge reading the Bible again everything that you need comes through the knowledge you won't understand it but if you don't know what belongs to you you can live in trouble amen a woman perish because she didn't have the knowledge of the checks that were sent to her lack of knowledge she didn't understand she was holding checks and she thought it was beautiful picture and she was suffering and they called the DSs and by the time they look they say no this is not beautiful picture your son is not sending you picture your son is sending you money so money all the benefit all the suffering all the bills all the food all the cars everything was loaded in with what she taught was a picture so Grace and peace will be multiplied through the knowledge that knowledge will unfold things unto you you will know what you have in hand and how to use it the knowledge the revelation of God through this message will unfold you what is this message really and when you understand what the message is then you can begin to draw and to begin to experience and enjoys the benefits of the message amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly again tonight Lord father thanking you for your grace for your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us and Lord father putting these things into remembrance unto us Lord father to feed on the word Lord your word stated that men shall

same camel that took Rebecca home one place your Prophet say that that Camel was the Holy Spirit and in other place he said the camel was the word and when we take the spirit on the word we have the
