no you Arnie you're all I want your you're [Music] you're Oh help me no thank you this uh this next song I was I was driving home from work the other day and uh I laid this song for the Isaiah Brooks sings it and y'all might know it as more of a children's song a sunday-school song but I was singing it and uh and the Lord something just came over me and I just I almost started crying right there in my seat just thinking about the song is yes jesus loves me and I was thinking about how I'm not fathering myself but I know that when the time comes and I have a child I want to do everything I can for that child and everything within mine means that I can do for that child I'm gonna want to do it for that child and just to think how capable our Lord in heaven is and how he cares for us that he can do all things and he has our best interest at heart and you know he can meet all of our needs he can meet all of our wants but he knows what's best for us and that's why he you know sometimes we'll pray for something we'll wonder why we don't receive it but he knows what he's doing so I just thought about that and I think why should I worry why should I fear why should I be stressed why should I have any concern about life at all when I know that the God in heaven that holds my life in his hands and cares about me because he's my father in heaven he's got it all in control I don't have to worry about anything I don't have to worry about what I'm gonna eat tomorrow what I'm gonna do and I'm gonna give my best effort I'm gonna work hard I'm gonna do everything that I can do but in the end of the day I know God's got it all control and he has me in his hands and I'm just gonna walk in his footsteps and I know it'll be all right so y'all just join in with me on this like I said I know it might be a sunday-school song but it's it's dear to my heart and we'll just sing it tonight for the glory of God yes Jesus yes jesus loves me yes jesus and jesus loves me [Music] yeah

tonight as family and you have a church up there and it's actually in Newton but it's called Hickory Bible Tabernacle you have a church there that pulling for you praying for you rejoicing in your stand for the truth encouraged by your stand for truth hurting with you as you labor in the word and suffer for his namesake we're glad to be here tonight we'd love you very very much appreciate the invitation to be here I'd like to be reading from revelations chapter 21 and gonna read verses 1 to 11 and I have haven't had the privilege of ministering to you as an assembly and as a body here but I can say you must be one pulling a bunch of people because I just felt like I was being pulled all over the Bible and all over the Word of God and just I felt like my fits in the word I could just preach it that's how I felt but I'm but I knew I had to strike find that channel and I have really just a story I want to share with you and be able to take it you know from the beginning even to the place that we are now where God's taking us to but maybe just do it through a theme I don't want to get you nervous like we're gonna be here all night but you know you do stay overnight at hotels that's what hotels are for revelations chapter 21 verse 1 and we'll start to look at this together it says and I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband so when John sees the New Jerusalem what he is struck with is an inspiration and what immediately comes up in his heart and how he begins to describe the city as he describes it as a bride adorned for her husband and that's that's what he feels when he sees it and now the reason why this would become more clear as we Minister the reason why that's what he feels when he sees it is because that's what is represented in the New Jerusalem is the wife but the bride has said when a man chooses a woman he's he's choosing what his future home will be so in the wife is the mystery of the future home so when John sees the future home he says I see it as a bride adorned for her husband so he says and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with him and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there should be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto him that thirst of the thirst of the fountain of water of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things I notice in the church ages there 7 he that overcomes but now there's an eighth he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all Liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death now notice how this transitions again and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither I'll show you the bride the Lambs wife so in verse two he sees the city the New Jerusalem and he's immediately struck with this inspiration to say as a bride adorned for her husband now he's told he's going to see the bride and notice what happens and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great city the holy Jerusalem descending out of heaven from God so when he's told he's to see a wife he sees the city so the if I could say this the bride is the first manifestation of the New Jerusalem because God chooses her to be a wife therefore she holds the mystery of the of the New Jerusalem this she is the holy city she is the dwelling place of God so when he's told to see the wife how he sees the city when he saw the city he was struck with the image of a wife and he says having the glory of God we know that the woman is the glory of the man having the glory of God and her light so now he's speaking of her in the city and female gender and her light was likened to a stone most precious even like a Jasper stone clear as crystal and if we could just bow our heads in prayer our gracious Heavenly Father lord I pray that you just take this this divine presence which is here now only you could come and sanctify a building as you have only you could sanctify hearts of your people as you have only you could be behind an atmosphere like this and anticipation like this so what I pray that you would come now take these open heart take these willing vessels Lord as you've used our brother and preparing the the atmosphere by leadership of worship and I believe you honored his sincerity Lord you honored the simplicity of the instruments the simplicity of the voices now come and in the simplicity of your word make yourself known may you speak to this body in a way that places them that strengthens them that inspires them Lord to go further and we commit it to you now father praying that you take control of this service for your glory in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and you may have your seats are we starting to get the sound levelled out a little bit just you do what you need to do if you have to hand me another mic if I have to raise my voice I'm not going to get him Barriss you're not going to make me feel uncomfortable I'm with family and so there's if the devil thought he was going to embarrass me or get me feeling backwards tonight he forgot that I was going to be with family and so we don't mind if we have to change things up or do things a little bit different I want to give the title the unfolding of the invisible the unfolding of the invisible and and just I just want to pour my heart out I have a lot of maybe quotes here in different scriptures and just try to follow the you just kind of pull me you pull me where the Lord would lead and we'll just follow we'll just follow that leading and you tell me when I'm done and we know the Lord will get the glory but I want to start with laying this foundation as we read from revelations chapter 21 we see a woman being described as a city I'll show you the bride the Lambs wife and so the bride is not a girlfriend she is not a fiancee she is a wife and this is something that John is identifying and we're living in bride time this is in church time this is bride time brother Branham had just a few places he's very particular about his language and even when he's preaching this seals heel so I'll call you bride that you'll understand realizing that there's a distinction associated with church in church ages but there's another distinction associated with Brian and bride age and so we're living in a time where it's bride time it's bright light and he speaks of the bride and says she is to come on the scene in the last days and it's a time and a place which is appointed to her so she is to come on the scene and we're living in u19 time we're living in a time where the marriage has come and if you're looking Christ as the mystery of God revealed he is teaching us that the headship to the body has come and it is uniting now with the body it's becoming one unit and so now it's husband and wife United together and in that there is no more waiting there is no more there is no more being a spouse and wait there is no more girlfriend or fiance who's waiting but now the headship has come that's a vindication that the rapture is at hand and he says it's now uniting with the body and that's the time that we're living in now but the random in the message invisible Union says the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work in this day he says no sir that was for Pentecost this is for the bride now when he says that was for Pentecost he's not doing that as a something dismissive well that was for Pentecost and if we're not careful we can in in our innocence and even in our defense of the message we can become dismissive of Pentecost well we must realize that if Pentecost wasn't who she was we can't be who we are and so in order for there to be a bride age there has to have been a Pentecostal age and it has to be a true age and a vindicated age and a genuine move of God and so the bride is what follows the outpouring of Pentecost and with the last order of the Reformation which the Laodicean Church age restoration the gift the baptism oligos was the last order of the Reformation so in brother Brown says the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work in this day and that was for Pentecost this isn't a slight this isn't a criticism he's just placing the ages he's placing the truth to those ages he said this is for the bride going home of the bride he says we got something different now it doesn't mean that they had something we don't have because we've been restored back to everything they had but yet we're in a different promise in this age we're not at the base of Mount Zion which Paul brought the church to but we're at the capstone in the climax of Mount Zion so he says he says this is for the going of the bride we've got something different the Pentecostals represented that again so the genuine Pentecostals not then not the group that went back into formalism not the group that went into organization not the group that went into fanaticism not the group that fell away just 15 years after it begin to start but those genuine god-fearing the Holy Ghost filled Pentecostals they represented that again and so we have a chain of inheritance that it back to the beginning through that Pentecostal move but he's placed in the bride agency thing different he says the Pentecostals represented that again we are in the bride age and brother branham makes the bride the the Pentecostal age synonymous and one with the Pentecostal age is the Laodicean age he makes them the same but now he's identifying something different in this Laodicean time he said this is not a Pentecostal age this is a latter-day age this is the bride age you know this is the day when the Son of Man is revealed and the revelation of the Son of Man which is also scripturally the coming of the Son of Man it involves the marriage of the bride to her mate the revelation of the Son of Man is not just a son of man revealing the son of man and contained within the ministry of a son of man but rather the the the revelation the son of man is a union between the bridegroom and his bride he's to return back into his people again it's when he gets into your flesh it's when he's it's that's the revelation of the Son of Man is a union of the word with his bride and brother Branham says an invisible union all that spiritual union of Christ and His Church now what is the spiritual union of Christ and His Church now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested vindicated just what the Bible said would happen in this day it's happening day by day a man and you're the proof of that you're the proof and it's happening day by day because it was not just a union in 1965 but it's a union in 2020 where the union is transpiring day by day and so it brings upon the scene the Lambs wife it is a it is a spiritual marriage a spiritual union now the spiritual marriage union is taking place right now it's unseen but it's real and Christ as the mischief God revealed he says and now the Christ and the church is just being made known and that's interesting Christ in the church is just being made known to even help you understand that you need the help maybe just to help me get it out I'll just use that word but to look at it in the way to understand what he means by Christ in the church is just being made known you have to realize that Christ been put out of the church in the Laodicean age he's a fugitive in his own church there's something that happens in the Laodicean age after the last order the Reformation after you have a tongue talking Holy Spirit baptized body of people with signs and wonders and gifts manifesting within just a few short years they organize and begin to die in Satan's like I've got this I got this thing licked because now Christ becomes a fugitive in his own church and revelations tells us Christ is on the outside of the church but there's a revelations 320 that comes behold I stand at the door and knock and so now that's how Christ comes into you and us and to him at that day ye shall know that I am you and you and me and then this is the revelation that comes forth at that day when the revelation is made known so that's what he's identified Lisa's truck the church is just being made known he said the whole thing is the revelation of God to take heed back to her right position again with her husband well it's the purpose of Christ now being in the midst of his bride what's the purpose of this revelation to bring the woman back to her right position again with her husband now he uses that language to take e which is the bride back to the right position again with her husband her right position is with her husband then he says the threefold purpose of God's great mystery is revealed so the threefold purpose of God's great mystery is revealed God manifested in Christ Christ manifested in the church in order to so now these don't have independent these aren't independent operations but these are things that are linked and changed together God manifested in Christ now Christ manifested in church his church in order to redeem the lost eat back to the original condition in the Garden of Eden so it's a right position but it's also a condition and this is the part that just gets me so excited because when you begin to think about it about position and condition it takes us out of the thought of a realm or a location it's a position and condition not just it's not a location but a position it's not a location it's a it's a it's a relation and it is a position and a condition and so the Union with the bridegroom is part of coming back to the Eden position the union with the bridegroom is part of coming back to a Garden of Eden condition so when you have Christ being manifested a bride being manifested and they two becoming one and united it resurrects or brings back or redeems a Garden of Eden position or a Garden of Eden condition so I don't have to look out and be discouraged by the Laodicean all I have to do is see the revelation of the mystery that the two have become one to see that there's an Eden condition being brought back and so when brother Branham is showing us these things in these sermons that is an invisible he says it's an invisible you not a physical Union as an invisible unit the earthly bride with her unseen bridegroom how there can be there could be a mental battle with this there can be there could be a wrestling with the the physic we want something that is tactile that we can touch that we can feel we want to be able to see things and describe it and many times that's how we were dated towards physical manifestations or signs they're given but science can signs can be pointing you just something and science could be revealing something but if you get hung up on the sign you'll never get to what is pointing to could you imagine if I the first sign I saw for Hilton Garden Inn and gastonia if I just stop there and say here we are here's the sign it says here this is the sign for Hilton Garden I wouldn't be where I was right now but if I followed the sign it got me to where I'm supposed to be and so we could be looking to signs and physical manifestations and they miss the spiritual manifestation of what's taking place so we can struggle with this idea well there's a there's a union taking place there's an actual wedding that's transpiring right now but it's spiritual and so this is my key that I'm just want to keep emphasizing tonight God unfolding from the invisible God working from the invisible his process of making the invisible visible his process of taking a word which is a thought in his heart first and this this logos and this desire that is invisible and unseen and his process of bringing it to an expression from going unseen to seen and I want to use this principle of this concept to understand the marriage of the bride to Christ the this I want I want to use this principle of the unfolding of the visible to understand the coming of the son of man the revealing of the son of man because this is a theme that brother Branham uses in the message and he identifies in the message invisible Union as he's preaching this and he starts to look at the history coming to an end he begins to speak about the physical return of the Lord Jesus to take a physical people by his cleansing blood and so he's looking at one day where it's going to be a physical return of the Lord Jesus with a physical people in the Millennium but now there's an invisible union and he and he's tried to lay this foundation so he looked there is going to be one day a physical coming and he says that's what most people are looking to now his third coming and because they're looking for the aspects in the the characteristics of his third coming they're going to miss him in a second coming because they're looking for a manifestation that will only be in his third coming and so he has to take time to bring this up an invisible Union and he starts using this language that there would be a royal bride to the Royal promised son this is a different Kingdom this isn't a natural seed this is a royal seed he says it won't be a natural seat it'll be a spiritual seed there's to be a spiritual bride raised up and he talked about how our natural life here is the result of being natural human beings associated together in fact and this does the language he's using an invisible Union because it really should be the right life to begin with but it's perverted by the natural birth so the physical perverted the way that we were supposed to come originally he talks about how your spiritual death separates you from your first Union and you have to be born to a new spiritual union talks about the old look of your natural you but then he says your your new bride your new life is in the Lamb's Book of Life your marriage certificate hallelujah where your true eternal germ from the beginning takes hold you're not only forgiven but you're justified justified Romans 5:1 says therefore being justified by faith this is a spiritual justification physical sense but by faith and so he's using this I very quickly went through that just to emphasize that in the invisible union brother branham's taking going to great lengths to show you have the physical side you have the natural side but I'm talking about the spiritual side I'm talking about the that the royal seed so in the unfolding of the invisible the unfolding of God and his plan and his purpose I want to look at this principle in order to better understand the manifestation of the word today and I want to begin and may God just give me help because it's just a picture that I'm looking at and I want to be able to describe it to you I've been pondering the phrase for the last two months or so the phrase is in the beginning on how you have different places in scripture where there's in the beginning but we can by the word go back before the beginning and before the beginning there was Elohim he was one that was dwelling alone and there there was only Elohim that means there was no space there was no time there was no light there was no matter if we were to say that yet that God was in this room alone you would immediately begin to think of space you'd be thinking distance and you think height and three dimensionally and you would imagine a person with surrounded by by atmosphere in light but that's not how God was God was not in a place God was the only thing that's very hard for us to understand it there was just God there was no place he would reach there was no place he would go sit it was just God dwelling alone with this sauce he was the always existing beam Colossians 1:15 describes him as the invisible God first Timothy 1:17 called the king eternal immortal invisible the only wise God so he was the invisible God and that's all that he was it was only God but in him were thoughts and in him were attributes and these thoughts and attributes were real and eternal they were they had substance they were not like our thoughts that could be fleeting they're not like our thoughts and purposes that may never be fulfilled but his thoughts were real they were eternal I'm the very sensual thought of his entire being and a very hard purpose that he had before anything was formed as he desired to have another expression of himself that he could have fellowship with he desired to have a bride of his choosing so if you could just imagine in the beginning there was nothing but God and this God wanted to have a help he wanted to have a bride he wanted to have a wife he wanted have a bride of his choosing and so he forms a low-cost there's nothing that you can see nothing expressed just an invisible God but now he forms a logos and it was this very passion and desire to have a bride that gave birth to that body that gave birth to that theophany that gave birth to that logos because he had to have that expression first before there could be a bride he realized if he would have brought a bride forth first she would have saw nothing but he had to bring forth the logos first and the law expression of the Oh God think of this in the logos was the wife and but he had to he had to have a way of unfolding this mystery so when he brings forth the logos that's the first expression of Christ and the first original expression of his wife because she was in him in the beginning it's from this low gosh theophany that he begins to create he creates a supernatural realm he creates a dimension of angels in an order of worship and a hierarchy and then he begins and he's doing these things by his spoken word and he begins to create now there's the invisible God who's now formed himself into a logos and this is the God God condescending down because then he creates another order of angels but in how he creates another order and it's the earthly order we know now it's a dimension of life and time and space it's a dimension of matter it's the earth and the heavens and the things that we know now and it's God's purpose in doing that the reason why he created the earth is to get a bride out of it these are things that were taught in the message so it's a process of God achieving a bride it began with him him forming himself into a logos and the logos was a visible expression of the invisible and in this with the off anybody's we said it is establish a dimension with beings called angels and that worship God and serve God then he created things that we now know with five senses things that can be touched and seen and handled and smelling and this is God's pattern a beginning invisible and unfolding to the visible God's pattern in the beginning was to be invisible spiritual and then the invisible God formed into a logos and then expressed in his creation so then when God begins to create Adam it is God expressing his pattern again of unfolding from invisible to physical it's God once again is expressing his pattern of starting with something spiritual unseen spiritual - material he says in Genesis 1:27 God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him and so when in a woman was hidden in him at this time male and female created he them and we know that Adam was first spiritual he was not physical he was not flesh because he was made in the image of God John 4:24 tells us that God is a spirit so if he was made in the image of God he was first made a spirit being brother Branham says God making Adam and Eve at the same time the only thing he made was the supernatural the spirit Adam in the spirit Eve the man and woman then he put Adam in here he says it wasn't good and when he says that it wasn't good he said it wasn't good for man to be alone he says see it's God's picture unfolding all the time what did Adam represent on earth he represented God how was it that God seen Adam knew it wasn't good for him to be alone because now he she's a mirror image of himself being the highest in heaven with angels and Dominion and authority but yet without a wife so he sees Adam on earth and his kingdom in his domain he says I see me I'm looking at myself in a mirror it's not good that Adam would be alone in his Dominion like it's not good for me to be able to mine Dominion I will achieve to myself a bride so our report shadow her first in my son Adam it's God's picture folding all the time he says it's just God's picture and fully God unfolding himself so it wasn't picked our picture of Adam it was God's picture so as it says in Genesis 2:7 8 and the Lord God formed man of the dust he was created first spiritual he was created first supernatural above natural but now he forms man out of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul what is God expressing here he went from invisible from not existing to existing spiritually to now existence in the flesh and then immediately he says and the Lord God planted a garden which means he says eastward or in the beginning Easter it also means in the big thing eastward in Eden so when he plants this garden eastward in Eden he is already foreshadowing and portraying the bride which is in Adam you get song a psalmist says of my garden my spouse and so the garden is representative of a spouse its representative a wife and so he has already he has already planted in the beginning of Eden and Eden means God's delight so he has already planted in cause delight a woman or garden foreshadowing that he has already sold the bride in the earth before Satan ever came to it before Satan could prevent it or defy God had already sold the seed he had already planted a garden eastward in Eden this is my God my sister my spouse and they says I am into my garden and what does it say in Genesis to 8 the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden that's figurative of the bride and it says and there he put the man whom he had formed hallelujah showing that God will put in him the man in the garden that he is formed and now the spiritual is physical now the supernaturals tangible it's been developed and this is the world that God loved they never thought about that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life that that's this is the world that God loved otherwise you have conflict when the Bible says he that loveth the world is not of my father he that loveth the world it cannot be in harmony and one with the father because all that is in the world is lost of the eyes let's invest in the private life as he tells us to love not the world for the love of the world is not of the Father but it says for God so loved the world he's talking about two different worlds the world that God loved was this world that's garden to me in this original condition this is the world that God loved the world that foreshadowed the bride the world that he took the man that he had formed and put him in the mid syrup that's the world that God loved and what did that garden foreshadow a bride that has already planted in Satan's Eden that Christ Himself comes into same thought he got one over on God but God says you're just falling right into my trap because what you have done is you have snuck into my Eden and you're possessed a vessel that preached a lie that caused a woman to fall and you did that in mighty but I will one day come down into your eating and I will inhabit a man who will have a message that'll raise up a woman that will not bring death but bring life and triumph over death what a lot of that happened in the beginning because he knew how it would end so then when God took Adam and he looked at me with Genesis 280 says it's not good for man to be alone I will make it help me for him things one opposite but equal it means a mirror image of himself one that's complementary equal but opposite in the beginning the woman was co-equal with them she was equal but opposite complementary to his purpose and he had a purpose be fruitful multiply and replace earth so there had to be a mirror image that could complement that purpose couldn't be another man that would never work I'll listen be spiritual I hadn't to be a woman that could produce a man in His image it had to be a woman that could bring forth another son just like their widow so it couldn't be different in reflection it had to be complementary I mean as soon as God says that it's not good that man should be alone he starts describing Adam doing the work and all the beasts of the field came before Adam and he begin to name all the animals and it's not it's not a change of scenery it's an explanation I will make him a help meet because there's a work that Adam can do by himself but there's a work he can't do by himself he can name the animals but what he can't do is bring life forth unless he has a wife so he declares a work that he did but now after he does that work he has to bring forth the woman in order to fulfill his purpose to be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth what does he foreshadowing the bride that God raises up in this last days to finish his work there was a work that he did in his first coming that he cannot finish and fulfill in his own so he now will in the end work bought and through his bride to finish his work how many Congolese do we have here tonight raise your hand just a couple because I'm just gonna who's all used to a three-hour 4 hours service my goodness you're pulling so good you said brother and you go too fast well you're pulling too hard you're just dragging me everywhere so then when he takes in Genesis 2:22 and he takes this woman out of the man brother BAM says showing here portraying the bride the whole thing is expressing something and now he brings out in the flesh the woman and so he is a God who and from being totally invisible to having a perfect fit of physical manifestation of himself a king and his queen in a domain went from invisible to physical but there was more to unfold there was more to God's purpose God's purpose was not just to have a man and a woman but that they would Bri forth and the purpose of the woman was never fulfilled but the purpose of the woman will be fulfilled through the bride the purpose of the first church was never fulfilled but the purpose of the church will be fulfilled in the bride that's how he could say we have something different but he uses a phrase in Christ as the mystery God revealed he says the three full purpose of God made manifest in Adam and Eve and ponder that the threefold purpose of God was already made manifest in Adam and Eve the threefold purpose of Christ God being made manifest in Christ manifesting sonship Christ having preeminence in the church which manifests bride in order to bring them back to a Garden of Eden condition he says the threefold purpose of God was manifested in Adam and the woman it was the this was the purpose of God it was in a hidden mystery but again it was made manifest it was hidden in the simplicity a man and a woman under a promise to reproduce the Sun under promise to bring forth a man in the image of Adam to bring back the original again and so the original free fall purpose of God made manifest in Adam and Eve now when God when God fashioned that it wasn't he just didn't want to have like a little playground he wanted to have a bride of his own choosing the invisible God desired to have another expression of himself so what he's represented in though in the woman is a representation of what he wants for himself what he gave Adam is what he's going to give himself he wanted a bride of equality he wanted a companion he wanted a ride that would love him for who he is I think about this he wanted a bride that would love him for who he was originally what was he originally just the word what was he originally he was invisible who wouldn't fall in love with a tall dark and handsome rich man who wouldn't fall in love with a wealthy King and a man with me two domains but how about fall in love with somebody that you have not seen how about trusting somebody you have not felt or handled but the only way that God could achieve his heart's desire was to manifest the hidden to manifest the unseen to give expression to what he had in his heart so brother Bram says in Christ is the mystery God revealed he what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood for he was a father and the only way he could express it was to become a son of men so and God loves something he cannot just have it he has to become something so God loved fatherhood so he couldn't just becoming a son and become a father he had to become a son himself in order to be a father hallelujah the only way he can express fatherhood the only way he could be a is the first he became a son so he became the son of man in order to be a father hallelujah and if he's going to be a bride if he's going to be a husband he has to become a bride so it's this original Elohim who's becoming and so God becomes the Christ it becomes through his word so on the threefold purpose God becomes manifested in the Sun then if he comes in preeminence in his bride in order to bring back to eating and Eden God was a living reality he was an unfolding mystery perfect love perfect understanding the love of God no death around them at all there was complete harmony between the spiritual and the physical that which was invisible isn't harmonized in the flesh and the invisible God has a perfect harmony where he could come down the cool of the evening and he can walk with Adam and he can walk with Eve I said it wasn't just a physical manifestation he said he heard the voice of the Lord walking in the garden so there was a voice he could hear and then it says Adam ran from his presence it wasn't a being but it was a revelation and if you and a harmony with the supernatural where the voice declared his word and the boys declared his presence without a beam and Adam fled from the presence of God but it was perfectly in harmony now you follow me in the store I'm just telling your story tonight now in this beautiful image which God had made when the woman sinned harmony is broken and God becomes mysterious again I pondered this deeply because it's then for the RAM taught us that the channels become clogged so now there was a perfect harmony of the invisible the spiritual supernatural and physical and this is what the Garden of Eden condition presented and a woman in perfect harmony together but I win man fell something is lost romance isn't from that time there was a time when death started that's when Eve struck lay down to the Garden of Eden met Satan and it's when she hurt first believed Satan's lied that death started and what happened she committed first spiritual adultery first she committed spiritual intercourse then the natural act took place I'm just using the language of the message it first happened unseen it first happened spiritually and then the physical act was place why that was the order that it followed and so then once this death starts and these great channels become clogged brother Bram says or the Bible says in Genesis 3:23 and 24 therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden that brother man says they're still in Eden he says the garden was a place in Eden but they're driven from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man and placed and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the Tree of Life so the garden represents perfect harmony of the spiritual the supernatural and the physical and this garden a physical description it had geographical borders we could read about it in Genesis chapter 2 and it's a type of even this description that God gives in Revelations 21 and the physical location and the physical attributes they were not erased from the earth God describes it from the river Euphrates to this he describes a dislocation but he didn't erase this and it became a black hole but yet something was lost in that way God guarded they were still in Eden but what the garden represent had become lost something had changed that the holy image of God left them is what brother Branham said and what happens is the physical loses its connection to the invisible that harmony that it shared oneness that completeness where they could be in a physical location on earth and then all of a sudden there's a divide that comes in a separation that comes they are no longer in harmony with God their father and so after the fall mankind exists in a physical realm it's in a realm of only light time and matter the supernatural world the supernatural part of the garden was lost so in Genesis chapter 3 verse 15 this is what ends the beginning the judgment to the woman and the judgment to the the serpent he says I'll put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and brother says this is the beginning but in the ending of the beginning God is speaking of a seed that's going to bring us back to the beginning because the seed of genesis 3:15 is a promise of a redeemer and it's going to be a redeemer of the physical and the spiritual it's going to be a redeemer that's going to bring back that which was lost so there's a healing prophecy in the judgment to the serpent in judging the serpent he hides a prophecy of Christ in judging the serpent he prophesized of a redeemer and he had to prophesy a seed to come he had to prophesy a redeemer because Adam and the woman never fulfilled the original purpose of the creation that promised to be fruitful multiply Nury pleasure I've never had a place to land genesis 3:15 the seed of genesis 3:15 is the promise of Genesis 1:28 be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth and one day that caught you to the womb of a virgin and what does it brings back it brings back the potential of Genesis 1:28 because now you have the seed of Genesis 1:20 the seed of genesis 3:15 brother branham says a power of transformation he said there was Adam and Eve walking in the Garden of Eden every seed bringing forth it never could do nothing else it can never do nothing else God because God said let it be that way it had to be that way oh how I'd like to stop here just minute to say there is where we are facing the completion of that word what is the profit point us - we are facing the completion of Genesis 1:28 every seed bringing forth of its kind because when Adam and the woman brought forth sons they did not do it in fulfillment of Genesis 1:28 they did not do it according to the word so he says now what are we facing we're facing the completion of that word the completion of God's original purpose brother man ray wrote now Jesus our last Adam and his eat the true church will fulfill all the plan of God by and through the members of his bride will be fulfilled all that God intended all that God wanted to fulfill in the Virgin so if God's going to bring back the original he had to bring back the he had to start from the invisible and what if her God to start to bring back the original he had to start with what was there in order to redeem creation so now we'd be in Reverse I'm just hitting the highlights here there's hitting the high spots it would be in Reverse now he must deal with man outwardly in order to bring Redemption he couldn't start from the invisible because that would be starting all over he had to start from the outward so what he begins with he begins by calling a man Abram and for nothing but just election God says Abram get myself out of that country and from thy kindred into a land that I will show thee and it was a physical land he said I will make of thee a great nation and I seed and they were all families of the earth be blessed so he had to start calling a man Abram and calling her away from a physical family and bring him to a physical land but Abram was looking who is the father of our faith he was looking for a city which has foundations whose builder and maker was God not some place temporary not some place transitioner but he was looking for revelations 21 something permanent something eternal as the father of our faith he looked at those things which are not and called them as though they were even though they weren't physical before him he called them as though they were but God speaks has ever passed through the land into a place of sashimi under the plain of Mora and again and the Canaan I was then in the land and he finally constantly being Abraham through a natural land why God had to start with the physical he had to start with Abram in the flesh he had to call him outwardly because God now is going to work in Reverse and I'm just going to go very very quickly and skip quite a bit now because when God when you get to Genesis chapter 12 Genesis chapter 1 to Genesis chapter 11 is God just setting the scene and setting the stage because now once he gets to Genesis chapter 12 the rest of the Old Testament is a story about one man and his family and where they live it's about Abraham his seed and the land that God promised him but God's purpose in that was not just to have a man with sons who have a land but to bring forth genesis 3:15 from that place so it's all about one man with the promise who had sons and inherit earth but God is wanting to manifest and show that he wants to redeem what had been lost is for God to have a wife he has to become a husband he had to first become a bridegroom he had to first become a head he had to become a savior of his wife which is his body so the Old Testament is us understanding God's election of grace in Abram and bringing to this place where he will frighten that seed the seed of Abraham was Christ his pulse said he didn't say seeds as of many but as to one which is Christ so in Christ the seeds of Abraham would be blessed so what he was looking through the whole time was God saith it is going to be by election one day the seed will come and he will redeem the natural seed of Abraham but that will not be the climax of redemption because the royal seat will be and lasts even so now we're gonna skip we're gonna skip the that part of the Old Testament we go from Genesis 12 now to the New Testament where the invisible God achieves is perfect expression in the bridegroom and what is he he's a physical Messiah - a natural seed I think of this because now when God called Abram he called him after the flesh he's called a it's bi-election but he calls him he tells him to leave his own family to separate from self from a land and now the physical the scene the natural what was visible was manifesting the spiritual here's a man who looked at me about 50 years old but what was he doing when you've seen me you've seen the father he's manifesting the unseen no man has seen God at any time but his only begotten son he hath declared him so the supernaturals being declared the Invisibles being made known he's proving that everything Adam lost in the fall was being restored order was being restored he could create he could control nature he can multiply creation the holy image of God that was fast in the beginning was now in harmony with the flesh it was showing that redemption was manifesting itself in a man born of a woman but it's something different because the first Adam was a living soul but now the second Adam is a quickening spirit the first man was earthly sensual but the second man was the lord of heaven what does that mean it's greater why did God bring the woman out of the man where the brassicas that God had created again it would have been greater than the original so when he brought forth the woman she was co-equal because she was not created she was from the original creation so now we have the beginning of the creation of God now it is a new race a super race now it is the son had been promised in the beginning so now God has created again what is its greater it's the mystery of God but when this physical Messiah came to the natural seed they didn't receive him or even recognize him John 1:11 says he came into his own and his own received him not how is it is his own it's because it was the natural scene that could be identified by a physical lineage that could be identified by physical inheritance why why did he say coming to his own because it was in the physical land where he was to come it was in the promised land it was in Palestine it was it was in that place the land of the Israelites it was to the seed that came from Abraham the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob he came to that natural seed in that natural land as it was promised to be done but they couldn't they couldn't recognize him well they were too focused on the natural - focused on the physical - focused on what could be seen they saw the flesh and that kind of that kind of messed him up a little bit because they thought if there's gonna be a redeemer if there's gonna be a messiah he's gonna be taller Saul was if there's going to be a messiah is going to be an earthly deliver a great king a very charismatic man they also heard rumors about how he had come to be and they were so focused on a natural kingdom that they were not they were not catching the existence of a spiritual revelation and the expression of a spiritual revelation why because they were physical people when God called Abraham what did he give him a physical sign of circumcision what did he give a promise to a physical lineage through Isaac through Jacob Israel he became known as the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob these are all natural people he gave him a physical land called Canaan it had physical boundaries that were clearly distinct in mark when they went into bondage it was a physical bondage in a natural and when it came time to be delivered he gave him a physical deliverer to take them as out of a physical land then he brought them to a physical mountain he gave you physical tablets he gave me physical law he gave him a physical temple he gave him a physical sacrifice everything with Israel was physical physical physical physical for the Jews everything was always natural my land goes to this River it goes to this sea the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob it was natural how can you prove yourself to be in Israel they had a natural circumcision didn't Paul say for the Jews require a sign it had to be outward so now think spiritually so when Jesus comes into his own when he speaks to them he says why are you so fearful o ye of little faith Matthew 826 mark 4:40 how is it that you have no faith so when he's speaking to the own that he came to he says you have little faith they had some faith but he called it little faith and honors he says you have no faith then in Matthew 16:18 says when Jesus perceived he's sending them oh ye a little bit glum yourselves so he's identifying a faith but it was a little faith I imagine the rebuke it must have been to say you know what if you just had faith the grain of a mustard seed that was a rebuke to them I hold on to that we don't have to give this room up at any particular time doing you can tell them I'm a diamond member so now he had come into his own in a visit as a physical Messiah to a physical people from a physical place Bethlehem came to a physical places that he was prophesied how to Nazareth all these different places he's man walking the shores of Galilee great light has sprung up and he's identifying self doing natural things and physical things and they handle him and touch them but yet they received him not so now in his physical coming which his first coming was to redeem his bride he begins to speak of another promise he said the father would send a comforter so now what he's talking about is a spiritual baptism because his first coming is going to climax on the day of Pentecost and the very capstone of the minister Jesus Christ was 120 people in an upper room the capstone of the ministry of the Messiah's first coming was only 120 people because his ministry John the Baptist the Prophet the forerunner introduced the Messiah to the church it introduced the church to the Messiah and then the Messiah took the church all the way to their capstone to their positioning on the day of Pentecost because he's after his death burial and resurrection he appeared physically several times after the resurrection to build their confidence in where God wanted them to be there in Jerusalem to point them to the promised why because the climax of his first coming was going to be meeting in the upper room to receive a spiritual baptism and that would be this that would be the capstone to the Jewish Church Ages that would be the position of placing to the Jewish Church so listen what he says in mark 16 14 afterward he appeared into the eleven as they sat at meat and abraded them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen so he keeps appearing to him so they would have confidence to go to Jerusalem and tarry there until the time of the promised king now once the promised comes we don't believe in carrying meetings because once the promise came it was unto them and his men as the Lord God would call and from then on every age is the age of the Holy Ghost of the true believer so now in the promises fulfilled the Holy Ghost comes but it's not physical it's not a physical son of God but it's the spiritual son of God the Son of God the baptism only ghosts the comforter now come invisibly into his church and so now the original seed of genesis 3:15 the seed of Genesis 1:28 the original seed had brought God's program back to the invisible working to the visible because now God could start work from the inside out God can work from unseen to seen from the invisible to the visible and now the invisible is in harmony to with the physical again and now they're not looking to a physical temple they're not look into physical sacrifices not looking to physical ordinances they're looking to the unseen and now the church which is his body the body of Jesus Christ would be built upon not a natural foundation but upon the revelation of Jesus Christ which is faith it's a place you don't go to with your feet and put your foot on one corner and walk to another place and put it on another corner but it's something invisible by revelation you stake your claim on it faith would be the foundation of his church Saints would be the access to the invisible it would be unseen before it's seen because faith would be the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen it would first be supernatural revelation it would first be an unseen conviction faith is the substance of things hoped for pulse didn't you see it why would you hope for it but faith is the substance of it it already exists before the natural eye sees it because faith is the evidence of things not seen [Music] so just as Adam was in the garden and as Jesus was in Galilee now the invisible God was in harmony spiritual harmony with the natural his church his natural people so now I'm just telling the story tonight consider the pattern now of the unfolding of the visible in the New Testament Brian think of the promise for today reverence is when the church can get in such harmony with God until the manifestation the bridegroom is manifested in the bride you know why the people rejected him in his first coming because they missed the physical manifestation and didn't understand the process it was how he appeared and the purpose for what he which he appeared but yet here's Johnson behold the lamb of God which takes away the sin of the world nobody else saw that but the Prophet you this was a lamb his purpose was to be a sacrifice so they miss the fleshly expression and they missed the purpose and they do it again today the very manifestation of his body and the very purpose that she has in Christ revealed in his own word he said there's nothing else left for it to come but him himself just step into that because that's the last thing there is the next is the intelligence he says it's God himself it's becoming to a place he's governed the body all the way through then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like Adams was at the beginning so now he wants to bring the last expression of himself you want to know who the final expression of God is it's his bride Christ is the mystery God revealed the bride is the mystery of God finished the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of the bride he says just like it was in the beginning why because it's to come back to that he says it's governed all the way down through what was he he was ace the son of God did the church changes the baptism of the holy ghost in the Millennium he comes as the son of David but between the son of God and the son of David he comes again as the son of man the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride so if you look at Luke chapter 17 because he gets prophecy as it was in the day the lot in the days of Noah so shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is how in Jesus is giving this it says in verse 18 Burks does virtually some and where being evil where the body is there will the eagle's be gathered together there were the fresh-killed the word is there was the body word that son of man is there will the bride be gathered together you're not feasting on a man you're not peace on the words of a man the words of a man will fail but you're feasting on the unfailing body word of the son of man so he brings us to Luke 17 37 but it continues he doesn't he didn't stop there he says and he spake a parable unto them this is so now he's continuing to amplify the revelation of the Son of Man and the gamin of the Eagles for the body word of the son of man and he tells a story about an unjust judge about us in a city where there was a judge why because one day there's going to be a city on earth that the judge comes to but it will not be and I just judge it'll be the wigged one the supreme authority and this woman where is the judge finally says oh my goodness let me avenge you of your adversary and he says this is an unjust judge he said wouldn't that God avenge his own elect which cry day and night and and even so come Lord Jesus would he not a venture speedily he says behold I come quickly yes he avenges her speedily he says I tell you he will but notice the key it will avenge them speed but when the Son of man cometh shall we find faith on the earth when he reveals himself to the Gentiles will he find faith when he came physically to the Jews no faithful little faith but when he comes as a son of man to the Gentile bride will he find faith that's what he's looking for Oh could we not just say you gon be blessed thank you Lord for letting us see this blessed revelation in the entire what you just give him praise for a second why don't you just offer some Thanksgiving they had aloo yeah thank you Jesus Oh blessed be the name of the Lord they're seeing this heavenly light in this in time Oh Darrin now listen think of this during his physical coming and I'm trying to bring this to a close and you all aren't helping and it's physical coming there was a sign that was given that was foreshadowing this Brides failure because he says when the Son of man cometh though revealing of the son of man is the coming of the son of man when the son of man cometh is he gonna find faith because that's what he's looking for because the Union requires faith faith in love work together félicité this union to work there's got to be faith so when he comes as a bridegroom listen if he reveals himself as a bridegroom it reveals his characteristic bridegroom means a man about to be married when he revealed himself as bridegroom in this out there made there had to be a bride come forth to fulfill his purpose listen I say this in the name of the Lord we cannot be bribed unless our bridegroom is here when he when he comes in his physical coming I I keep saying physical coming but listen that was a word coming don't let him don't let anybody tell you that wasn't a word coming that was the word coming because it was the word that came to John the Baptist now why did the word come to John the Baptist because work to the Prophet why did Jesus come to the jour that River that day because that's where the Prophet was the word had to come to the Prophet and that was a word coming [Music] and in that word coming which manifested in a physical Messiah to a physical people in a physical land there was a representation of the bride's faith there was a foreshadow just a little glimpse then a preview of how the Gentiles would receive him at his coming in mark chapter five in Luke chapter 8 and yatris is the ruler of the song here's a Jew he says I pray thee common lay hands on my daughter so this is a Jew with the physical Messiah showing you the Jews faith he wants the the deliverer the Messiah to come and lay physical hands on my daughter then the woman with the blood issue she touches the hem of His garment she makes physical contact with him he says that they have made the whole listen that was a faith that was a little faith but there was a greater faith there was a greater faith being expressed because listen when brother Branham preached peace of the trumpets it recognized your day in its message he's preaching all about the Jews because there was a promise to the Jews but at the same time a promise to the Gentile so he's preaching recognizing your day in its message and he's reading Hosea and he's saying to the Jews to the Jews but there's a mystery to us to recognize your day and tour message the piece of the trumpets is what brings us to the full revelation that now we're living in something different because now he's starting to point to the fact that the very next coming is going to be to reveal himself to the Jews so in his first coming there's all likewise this manifestation that's taking place as he's revealing himself to Israel there's a there's a foreshadowing of the bride's faith I'm not gonna ask for permission I'm just gonna take my liberty let's turn to Matthew chapter 5 verses 22 to 28 it says I'm behold a woman of Canaan in mark chapter 7 it says the woman was a Greek of Sara Phoenician by nation so she's not a Jew she can't he says he behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts and crown him saying have mercy on me o thou son of David odorous he wants she wants to call him son of David so he had to begin to think of the type my daughter's grievously vexed with the devil but he answered her not a word and he says and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crieth unto us but he answered and said I am not of this of this I am NOT sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel now why did he hide this mystery because we knew that he wasn't that he was he was sent he was going to be it through him the whole world would be redeemed but now he she called him son of David so she's crying unto Him he says I'm not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel and it almost seems misleading but he's hiding a mystery then she came and worshiped him saying who said truth Lord as the son of David he was sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel but now she says true Lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table then jesus answered and said unto her o woman great is that faith he never said that to a Jew but now to acerra Phoenician to a woman of Canaan all woman great as I faith it under thee even as thou wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour he says I'm not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel hiding the mystery that he was sent to the Gentiles seemingly hiding that mystery but she says the right thing just that I may not be a lost sheep of Israel that's true Lord but even the dogs eat crumbs that fall from their master's table I'm at that saying that's great faith and without him going to lay hands on his daughter she was made whole that very so on the woman of Canaan was expressing not a faith or a little faith but a great faith and in March after eight verses 5 to 13 when Jesus was entered into Capernaum there came unto him a Centurion this is a Roman now this is a Gentile beseeching him say Lord my servant life to home sick of palsy grievously tormented and Jesus sent him I will come and heal him this is exactly what the ruler of the synagogue wanted come lay your hands on him get the physical touch lay your body upon the body this is how these things were done it was always physical but now notice something within the Centurion says Lord I'm not worth it the vows should come under my roof and I say they did but Speak the word only and my servant shall be healed here's the Gentile with the revelation the spoken word is enough you do not need to travel distance you don't need to come physically to my servants you do not need to commonly hand the word is enough but Speak the word only listen in this hour but the organization's are indicted for the second crucifixion from then on comes the word and the word only speak the word only and my servant shall be healed for I'm a man under Authority having soldiers under me and I say to this man go and he goeth and to another company cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it when Jesus heard it he marveled [Applause] [Music] listen Tina father a Jew he didn't marvel at gyro he didn't marvel at Peter he didn't more about a Jew but now this Gentile because this was marvelous this was a marvelous faith that would come from marvelous grace hallelujah he marveled and he said unto them to follow verily I say unto you I have not found so great faith no not in Israel I found faith I found a little faith but I haven't found a great faith in Israel because I came to my own and my own received me not I now here's a heathen a reprobate a Gentile a Roman who says word only is enough and I sandy that many shall come from the east and the west and shall sit down now he's starting to reveal the mystery of the Gentile bride shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven he's revealing a mystery he hid it when he talked to the woman from Sarah Phoenicia but now he's saying hey there's going to come a day when Gentiles are going to come to this light and they're going to be heirs with Abraham Isaac and Jacob and he says but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness which Kingdom the natural Kingdom and there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth and Jesus saying to this interior gold my way as thou hast believed so be it unto thee and a servant was healed in the self-same hour this is the Gentile faith this is the faith that brother Branham said we ought to run at a higher level he said he was the Gentile way is to believe him just absolutely believe him this is what's being revealed it's I'm gonna have to cut the story short but listen he came to them and began to reveal himself and there's a Gentiles there that recognized them this is the chin toffee this is the bride's faith thy word nothing physical no distance travel just faith the mystery of Christ's body the Gentile bride not even been revealed yet the Gentiles are not even considered heirs but the word excited of faith in the Gentiles the faith that Jesus marveled after he says I have not seen a great faith not in Israel what was he foreshadowing a bride what was this sign of that when the Son of man cometh he'll find faith you'll find a great faith the Jewish dispensation beginning the natural calling of Abram and ended with the physical must and then once the physical Messiah came there were spiritual blindness why because he came to call them out of a physical promised land into a spiritual promised land when Moses came he delivered them out the natural bondage physical bondage to a natural end but now in this Exodus when the Messiah comes the LORD thy God shall raise up a prophet liken unto me it's not a physical Exodus but it's an exodus out of a spiritual condition into a spiritual Promised Land but then when the Gentile dispensation began they begin with the Holy Spirit baptizing people in the spiritual body now those Gentiles did not receive a physical Messiah they received the spiritual Messiah the son of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Gentile church was introduced to Christ by a prophet who knew Jesus Christ by revelation who brought them to a spiritual Mount Zion who talked about tablets of their heart it wasn't a physical mount it was a spiritual Mountain it wasn't physical tablets it was spiritual tablets the Gentile bride with no natural connection no natural land nothing physical no natural hair natural tradition no physical history nothing will receive Jesus Christ based upon the word and the word only received Christ at the word of preachers I mean Theo peon has a has Philip come and preaches to him and he receives it have the word of Philip he didn't have to see the Messiah doing miracles and signs and wonders without sight without tradition by faith what was happening the Gentiles were coming to the light the light that was in the Jewish Church the harmony of the supernatural with the physical and so jesus said in Luke chapter 10 verse 23 and he turned his disciples and said privately blessed are the eyes which see the thing you see the Jews were blessed to seek God unveiled before them in his son and remember you can only know the God for the son so to know God you have to know the son so you have to know the sons manifestation which manifestation of the son is it's the same God it's the same son but you can only known for the manifestation of a son the Jews received a physical Messiah blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see and you know the Jews will still receive him the physical Messiah because he comes again the corporal coming to Lord to 144,000 what would they see where did you get those scars because that's his promise to the Jews but then in John 20 29 jesus said to them Thomas because thou has seen me thou hast believed why he's a Jew blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed so let me just end with this son the Gentile bride receives a spiritually revealed Messiah Robert I said it's the very it's the very word that becomes alive and carries us to her unseat Bradley he says it works just Express and the invisible unit of the church bride the Christ that messenger is here now which is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever listen why is it happening this way because we're not Jews that's the problem that happens today with people who think their spiritual Jews they tie it to the color of their skin they tied to a natural line they tied to tied to natural Kingdom listen I think God didn't ambush am i because I was born in Arizona but I'm an heir I'm a spiritual error well because I'm royal see not because the color of my skin but my spiritual revelation and then well you know the church the Bride of Christ that messengers here now it's a spiritual Messiah for spiritual union that takes us through to a physical rapture and a physical meeting in the air but that's how God works is the unfolding on the invisible it has to be spiritual first before it can be physical before we can meet him in the air we have to met him here and this is the great faith to believe that you have received the spiritual Messiah and are uniting with him now this is a marvelous faith says improving his word we know that there's a messiah coming and when that Messiah comes he's going to be the word there was the invisible son of God the Holy Ghost through seven Church ages building a bride in seven ages but then at the end of the seventh page that's going to be a spiritual revelation of the Son of Man that the bride will receive romance as an identification of Christ in all ages Jesus Christ the Son of God is here with us now be identified resurrect pieces making himself known first time he's done this since nineteen hundred years ago and he is here tonight Wow we got something different just as he came unto his own and his own received him not now he's came into his own body piece of the trumpets now now how she appeared in the last days is to bring the people back to the world so that the bride will know her husband know her mate the revealed word it's exactly what God's pattern he works from the invisible for the spiritual to the physical it's a three-fold purpose of God manifested in Adam and Eve the invisible God Express they prefigure in them now Christ and the bride will manifest the perfect fulfillment now the invisible God is expressed in the bride's body now we can say our light has come share Shalom it's darkness upon the earth gross darkness upon the people but the glory of the lord has risen upon thee now it's bride light now and the bride coming of Christ what is this spiritually revealed first and a spiritual union and then what's going to happen we're going to be changed we're gonna meet our Lord in the air because that's exactly what he did in the beginning God will bring us to the man like you did to the woman in the beginning but she was first United with him spiritually and God is uniting the bride now with the word it's the unfolding of the invisible I'm sorry to to not finish the story we'll leave that to your pastor you can do a better job anyways let's stand to our feet [Music] [Applause] [Music] the world is looking for nail scars they're looking for thorn prints they're even looking to a natural sky hoping to see a 900 foot Jesus but he says when he says look up your Redemption draws nigh he didn't mean take your natural gaze and look to the sky he's talking on attitude why did the Prophet preach look away to Jesus because he was trying to get us to look away from something and see something else why did he preach there is a man here who can turn on the light why because he was our brother that was standing next to the engineer he said don't worry little bride there is a man here who can turn on the light enraptured that church that's why he said watch the third pool that's why I said look on this because he was pointing us to something he's wanting us to see our mate a bridegroom and just as John introduced the church to the Messiah and the first coming our messenger has introduced the bride to her bridegroom and just as Christ took the church from there all the way to the Opera room Christ will take the bride all the way to a meeting in the air it's the invisible union let us bow our heads let us pray to the Lord our Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your great grace Lord we thank you that you have been with us tonight in this simple service lord I thank you that you've given me the privilege of driving down from Newton tonight to come to Gastonia to preach to your purchase to your people not to stand behind this desk but the stand before these people huh and Lord I count myself to be privileged tonight to express these great words that have been brought to us but we wouldn't have a message had this message or not brought in Lord we would not know you had you not been introduced to us and Lord there's no slight to you as a messiah there's no slightest God it is your pattern and Lord we accept your title and all we see it and what I could have just got right more into the message showing in message how our prophet was trying to get us to run at a higher level to have a Gentile faith that can take you at your word because if we're gonna be a bride that loves you we have to love you for who you are you are the word we have to love you as an invisible God who makes himself known by revelation because to please you we have to come unto you by faith to know you we have to know you by revelation and you're so pleased Lord to be spiritually united with the wife and this our who says with her eyes she has not seen you yet she loves you and it's the spiritually revealed word which is uniting us to you we believe one day we will meet you in the air would you believe there will be a change of these bodies we believe that there'll be a meeting in the air the Lord while we're here we're enjoying this feast we're enjoying this spiritual supper we're enjoying the seven course Lord may we feed on it may we water these animals well it's this very word Lord that's carrying us to that meeting in the air it is the unfolding of the invisible Lord now we're invisible United with you we accept it we believe it by faith that was the promise to the Gentiles we believe it in this hour we stand upon it God we need not mean ask but the spiritual revelation of the truth of it may you marvel at this faith yet again Lord may it be a great faith that brings the greater works because we believe this Lord may we see greater things we commit ourselves to you tonight pray that you bless your people Lord watch out over us as we watch or the Bible says that it does not wash the city the watchman in vain the Lord does not suggest that the
