[38:29] we went over and over and things keep
[38:31] popping up brother greg
[38:33] don't know what to do with the book of
[38:34] ruth
[38:35] looks like the entire bible was
[38:40] locked in one book a very small book
[38:43] this is what the opening of the seals
[38:45] does
[38:47] it makes the bible in you
[38:51] if you're there you can say amen
[38:53] verse 10
[38:56] then she fell on her face you understand
[38:59] this already
[39:00] and bow herself to the ground
[39:03] and say to him
[39:06] why have i found grace in your eyes
[39:10] remember she worked from the morning
[39:12] all the way to this time
[39:14] then she found boaz and boaz expressed
[39:18] certain things that we spoke last sunday
[39:20] and to her she found grace
[39:23] amen
[39:24] why have i found grace in your eyes that
[39:27] you should take knowledge of me
[39:29] seeing i am a stranger
[39:32] amen this is a grace extended to a
[39:35] stranger
[39:36] to one who is coming from a gentile who
[39:39] is not part of the commonwealth of
[39:41] israel amen verse 11 and boaz answered
[39:45] and said to her
[39:46] he has fully been shown me you might be
[39:49] seated
[39:50] all that you have done to your
[39:53] mother-in-law since the death of your
[39:55] husband so we're going back again to the
[39:57] decision and the things that she did
[39:59] back there
[40:01] amen but she is in another stage she is
[40:04] serving
[40:05] but that serving is connected to
[40:07] whatever was done back there remember
[40:10] justification make way to
[40:13] praise god so
[40:15] verse 11 and boaz answered and said to
[40:18] her he has fully been shown me showed me
[40:22] all that you have done to your
[40:23] mother-in-law since the death of your
[40:25] husband and how you have left your
[40:28] father
[40:29] and your mother and the land of your
[40:31] nativity just like abraham and i come to
[40:34] a people which you knew not before the
[40:38] lord recompense your water
[40:43] your work
[40:44] i hope somebody is not sleeping
[40:47] remember the word work
[40:49] the lord recompense your work and a full
[40:53] reward
[40:55] be giving you
[40:56] of the lord god of israel
[40:59] under whose wings
[41:01] you are come
[41:03] to trust so everything she did she was
[41:05] putting herself under the wing of god
[41:08] amen
[41:09] jump to verse 14. here roof is serving
[41:14] and she has been serving
[41:16] under
[41:17] the reapers you understand this language
[41:20] now
[41:21] so she was under the candlestick
[41:23] everybody here
[41:25] so boaz came
[41:26] and broke certain things from the law
[41:29] completely
[41:30] and changed the work of roof bo has
[41:32] never removed the work remember
[41:34] he kept the work but he changed the law
[41:36] everybody clear and by changing the law
[41:39] now roof is operating differently yet
[41:42] still laboring the labor will remain
[41:44] there amen
[41:46] job to verse 14. if you're there you can
[41:48] say a man
[41:49] and boy say to her at meal time you
[41:52] remember this now she's moving from the
[41:55] candlestick and she has been invited to
[41:58] the table
[41:59] of the show bread
[42:01] you remember that
[42:03] amen
[42:04] because both the candlestick and the
[42:06] table of the showbread both of these
[42:09] things are in the field of boas
[42:12] remember
[42:12] and we are in the holy place
[42:16] everybody here we are in the holy place
[42:18] we're dealing with the candlestick and
[42:20] the table of the show bread
[42:22] he says and boa said to her at mealtime
[42:25] come you here
[42:26] and eat off the bread
[42:28] and dip your morso in the vinegar you
[42:30] see that drink offering
[42:32] and she sat beside the reapers and he
[42:35] reached her part corn and she did eat
[42:37] and was so fast and
[42:39] left everybody clear so far let's go to
[42:42] jeremiah chapter 31. we started last
[42:46] week it should be clear now
[42:49] jeremiah chapter 31
[42:52] if you dare you can say amen
[42:56] a few people bubbles still turning
[42:59] this thing is really really really
[43:02] really really loaded
[43:05] okay
[43:06] so stay awake
[43:08] we got to work our way up i cannot rush
[43:11] quickly because the majority of the
[43:13] trouble in the message lays under
[43:17] justify under sanctification
[43:19] this is where the problem is that
[43:20] legalistic spirit
[43:23] and it makes the message bitter
[43:29] because somebody doesn't know how to
[43:31] apply and to operate the message
[43:36] that's why i'm going slowly i started
[43:38] since roof serving roof under
[43:40] sanctification i'm going to go slowly
[43:43] with this sanctification a lot of the
[43:45] marriages in the message are sticking
[43:47] right here
[43:48] a lot of trouble with the children in
[43:51] the message sticking right here the way
[43:54] we brought up the children in the
[43:55] message is because of the mess of
[43:58] misunderstanding
[44:00] the
[44:01] holy place
[44:03] so i'm gonna take my time
[44:05] get the roof under sanctification
[44:08] then get roof on the westlake then take
[44:11] roof under armenianism and you're going
[44:14] to see the mess that you cause to your
[44:16] children to your husband to your wives
[44:19] to the people in the message
[44:24] until they feel like the message is a
[44:26] bunch of law
[44:28] the message is not law
[44:30] the message is something joyful
[44:33] when you come on wednesday nowadays do
[44:36] you feel the burden anymore
[44:38] do you feel like oh it's time to go to
[44:40] church i'm tired i don't want to go to
[44:42] church what makes you happy now to be in
[44:44] church you don't want to miss wednesday
[44:47] you can't even hardly wait for sunday as
[44:50] soon as it's sunday you want to go there
[44:52] if it snows you upset
[44:55] why are you upset before you didn't want
[44:57] to go to church
[44:59] when it's uh sunday you're like
[45:01] nowadays you are you reach a point you
[45:04] even about to leave your father jump in
[45:07] the car and drive yourself
[45:09] because they're taking too long
[45:13] something changed in your life
[45:17] you have been purged from the hotel
[45:21] you didn't know
[45:23] you didn't know
[45:26] service is finished nobody want to go
[45:28] home the people are still dancing and
[45:30] worshiping and something what is keeping
[45:32] you here
[45:36] who's telling you to read your bible now
[45:39] brother stephen
[45:40] brother stephen is not even there who's
[45:42] telling you to read your message
[45:44] who's doing that it's not me anymore
[45:49] that's how the message should be
[45:52] somebody start pulling before i even
[45:54] pray let's go to 31
[45:57] before the days come you remember this
[46:00] last sunday says the lord that i will
[46:02] make a new covenant so there is an odd
[46:05] and there is a new
[46:07] with the house of israel
[46:09] and with the house of judah
[46:11] not according to the covenant are made
[46:14] with their father remember that covenant
[46:16] was written on stone
[46:18] amen and our heart the bible says that
[46:21] we had a heart like stone
[46:23] god cannot take the commandment and
[46:25] write it on the heart of stone because
[46:28] it's reminding him again the law you're
[46:30] not going to be able to fulfill it
[46:32] you're going to fail
[46:34] you have to change your heart remember
[46:35] last sunday and give you another heart
[46:38] then in the heart god can put his law
[46:41] then that heart will make you different
[46:44] then coming to church is different
[46:47] everybody okay now blessed be the name
[46:49] of the lord not according to the law
[46:52] that i made with their father in the day
[46:54] that i took them by the hand to bring
[46:56] them out of the land of egypt which my
[46:59] covenant they broke they could not keep
[47:01] this one amen although i was ah
[47:05] so god was dealing with them as a
[47:07] husband and life
[47:09] and a wife so if you're dealing with a
[47:11] husband and wife
[47:13] the law really that god was bringing in
[47:16] israel to was a love
[47:23] because it was a love between the
[47:24] husband
[47:27] everybody here and his wife
[47:34] oh lord help me
[47:36] if i can sit down with you today
[47:39] i hope you can catch it amen
[47:42] i was a husband to them say the lord but
[47:45] this shall be the covenant that i will
[47:48] make with the house of israel after
[47:50] those days say the lord i will put my
[47:53] law everybody clear in the inward part
[47:57] the law is not going to be in the book
[47:59] and you are right here that's why you
[48:01] have a problem
[48:02] god is going to take the book
[48:05] and make you swallow it
[48:09] everybody okay
[48:11] you remember revelation 10 the top john
[48:15] take the book and do whatever
[48:17] so now the law is no more outside of you
[48:20] if they ask you where is the law you say
[48:22] well the law is good
[48:28] you want to see the message of the hour
[48:31] [Music]
[48:34] you want to know how to leave the
[48:35] message of the hour if you don't have a
[48:38] book and a tape come and live with me
[48:44] because my life is nothing but an
[48:46] expression
[48:48] of the message of the hour
[48:51] you are written a bit you remember last
[48:53] sunday
[48:56] i wish the whole church was here
[49:00] amen i will put my law in the inward
[49:03] part
[49:04] and write them in their heart
[49:07] which heart a heart of stone or new
[49:10] heart
[49:11] you see now and i will be their god and
[49:14] they shall be mine
[49:16] and they shall teach no more every man
[49:19] his neighbor
[49:20] nobody have to be with you putting like
[49:23] a radar on you in school in a cafeteria
[49:27] or something nobody have to be
[49:29] supervising you
[49:32] you have the supervisor himself
[49:34] [Music]
[49:36] so you're not leaving the message to
[49:38] please somebody anymore
[49:41] now you leaving the message to please
[49:46] they ever present help in the time of
[49:49] trouble
[49:50] [Music]
[49:53] so mama is there our mom is not there i
[49:56] am still to leave the message
[50:00] oh lord have mercy
[50:03] and every man his brother is saying know
[50:06] the lord
[50:07] for they shall all know me
[50:09] from
[50:12] of them to the
[50:15] everybody say the lord for i will
[50:17] forgive their iniquity and i will
[50:20] remember their sin
[50:22] you see calvary there the brazen altar
[50:25] breaking everything
[50:27] let's go to ezekiel then we will pray
[50:32] again remember we don't have visitors in
[50:34] this church we got family members
[50:37] no visitors it's our family member
[50:40] welcome
[50:42] ezekiel chapter 11 verse 18 if you dare
[50:44] you can say amen
[50:47] and they shall come there and they shall
[50:50] take away
[50:51] all the detestable things thereof and
[50:54] all the abomination thereof from there
[50:56] everybody care
[50:57] and i will give them one heart
[51:00] and i will put a new spirit within you
[51:03] remember that
[51:04] and i will take the stony heart so when
[51:06] we are born we are born with stony heart
[51:10] no matter what you preach it preaches it
[51:12] goes on top of a stony heart
[51:15] that's why it's not working
[51:17] it's the law
[51:19] anybody care because the black dog is
[51:21] pulling you somewhere else and god is
[51:24] pulling you somewhere else it's not
[51:25] working hey mark here
[51:28] and i will take the stony heart out of
[51:30] their flesh and will give them a heart
[51:33] of flesh
[51:34] that's the purpose that they may walk in
[51:37] my statute
[51:38] and keep my ordinances
[51:40] and do them
[51:43] so there was a problem in doing the
[51:46] ordinances of god in keeping the
[51:48] ordinances of god because the law was
[51:51] written on stone
[51:54] the law written of stone doesn't help
[51:57] you do the things of god
[52:00] because the law magnifies sin
[52:03] he make the black dog really angry
[52:09] amen
[52:10] that they may walk in my statute and
[52:13] keep my ordinances and do them and they
[52:15] shall be my
[52:17] and i will be there
[52:19] you remember ruth rightly
[52:22] let's go to ezekiel 38
[52:25] 36
[52:27] glory be to god
[52:31] at the opening of the seventh seal the
[52:33] bible became a new book
[52:40] hallelujah
[52:42] let's go to verse 23
[52:45] and i was sanctified within
[52:47] sanctification
[52:49] my great name which was profane among
[52:51] the hidden
[52:53] which you have profaned in the midst of
[52:54] them and the hidden shall know that i am
[52:57] the lord
[52:58] say the lord god when i shall be
[53:01] sanctified in you
[53:05] now it's a work that is working in an
[53:07] individual
[53:08] i shall be sanctified in you
[53:11] before the eyes
[53:12] for i will take you from among the
[53:15] hidden like roof
[53:17] remember
[53:18] and gather you out of the country all
[53:21] out of all countries
[53:23] and will bring you into your own land
[53:26] then i will sprinkle water
[53:30] so when they bring you you're still
[53:32] dirty
[53:33] remember brother branham say it's like
[53:35] they pick up a glass
[53:37] but the glass is still dirty but the
[53:39] picking up of the glass is justification
[53:42] but you are still feel free
[53:43] they need to clean you up
[53:45] not with any kind of water remember you
[53:48] gotta have the water for your day
[53:52] with clean water
[53:55] not any kind of water but the water of
[53:57] your day
[53:59] or the message of your day
[54:02] to be precise
[54:04] and i will sprinkle
[54:08] clean water upon you verse 25 and you
[54:10] shall be clean so what makes you clean
[54:13] is the water
[54:15] hey but here the water sanctifiers and
[54:18] make you clean
[54:20] remember those things very important
[54:22] amen
[54:23] make you clean from what from all
[54:27] so when god pulls you you're still
[54:29] filthy remember the glass everybody care
[54:32] remember brother branham when god pulled
[54:34] you you still have adults
[54:36] that's why when you give your heart to
[54:38] god
[54:39] you must still love somebody in the
[54:40] world
[54:44] god gotta cut it off
[54:48] because you justify but you're not clean
[54:50] yet
[54:50] you still have that
[54:53] good sweet companion in school that is
[54:55] not message believer
[55:00] okay no problem
[55:01] you shall be clean from all your
[55:03] filthiness and from all your adults we
[55:06] like cleanse you
[55:08] a new heart also everybody okay
[55:11] will i give you and a new spirit
[55:14] we saw last sunday the first thing god
[55:17] gives you is a new heart
[55:20] the second one is water
[55:22] a new spirit
[55:25] and the third one god put the
[55:28] his spirit the holy ghost in the
[55:30] building of that
[55:32] many people have a new heart they
[55:34] thought they have the holy ghost
[55:36] especially in this message a bunch of
[55:38] them cross them and you see the snake
[55:41] amen just cross them the snake comes up
[55:45] everybody here cross them
[55:47] so stubborn amen
[55:49] and i will take away the stony heart
[55:53] out of your flesh and i will give you a
[55:55] heart of water
[55:57] verse 27 and i will put my spirit within
[56:00] you
[56:01] and cause you
[56:02] after the holy ghost comes in you this
[56:05] is what makes you because when the holy
[56:07] ghost comes it's a rest
[56:09] you take your hand off the wheel
[56:11] somebody take your life over
[56:13] now the message is different
[56:15] anybody okay i will cause you to walk in
[56:18] my statute and you shall keep my
[56:20] judgment and
[56:23] how are you going to do then if the holy
[56:24] ghost is not helping you
[56:28] then you back to the lord
[56:30] anybody okay
[56:32] and you shall dwell in the land that i
[56:34] gave to your father and you shall be
[56:37] mine
[56:38] and i will be your
[56:40] everybody clear so far

[57:46] revelation to your children in the name
[57:49] of jesus christ
[57:51] amen
[57:52] god bless you as you already been seated
[57:55] we are on part 14 of the four phases of
[57:59] roof
[58:00] i'm calling this roof in holiness
[58:04] last sunday we were in sanctification if
[58:07] i call last sunday sanctification part
[58:09] one and this part two we don't want to
[58:11] have confusion but holiness is another
[58:14] name for sanctification so when you say
[58:17] holiness or sanctification it's still
[58:20] the same thing everybody here but i made
[58:22] it so you can separate the two and be
[58:25] able to have it clear as in reference
[58:27] everybody clear if you notice here roof
[58:30] is not following any man
[58:35] roof is following maiden
[58:39] at the beginning she was following the
[58:41] reapers which were men
[58:43] young men but when boaz came boaz
[58:46] changed the order and boaz told roof not
[58:49] to follow men anymore but to be among
[58:52] the women
[58:55] we're going to climb everybody okay so
[58:57] far
[58:58] on our journey in the tabernacle
[59:01] we found out the roof moving into the
[59:03] tabernacle and we're moving all the way
[59:05] to the holy of holiest
[59:07] now we are in roof in a holy place
[59:10] and we position roof over there and roof
[59:13] in the holy place brother branham say it
[59:15] means roof serving
[59:17] or roof under sanctification or roof
[59:21] under luther and the deviation from a
[59:24] roof on the westlake and the deviation
[59:26] from westlake is roof under armenianism
[59:30] everybody clears so far my friend in the
[59:33] computer stay pretty tight you there
[59:36] praise be the name of the lord as we
[59:38] continue our journey we found out that
[59:41] when roof enter into the tabernacle roof
[59:44] have to do six interactions with the
[59:47] tabernacle furnitures
[59:51] everybody okay
[59:52] the first one as she enters she meets
[59:54] the brazen altar where she give her life
[59:57] she make a decision and then from there
[1:00:00] she moved to the water baptism in the
[1:00:02] level where she get baptized and the
[1:00:05] water baptism sent her completely to the
[1:00:08] candlestick
[1:00:09] where she found the messenger of her day
[1:00:12] and the messenger of the day is a light
[1:00:16] that is giving light at the absence of
[1:00:18] the sun
[1:00:20] so when he gave light he project roof
[1:00:22] not to themself
[1:00:24] but he project roof all the way to the
[1:00:26] table of the show bread
[1:00:28] and the table of the show bread down
[1:00:30] deal with the drink offering and from
[1:00:33] there roof is moving to the altar of the
[1:00:36] ancestors and from the altar of the
[1:00:38] incense we're going into the holy place
[1:00:40] where is the ark of the covenant and the
[1:00:43] throne of god in between the caribbean
[1:00:46] which is the mercy seat everybody cares
[1:00:48] so far so number one the brazen altar
[1:00:50] then you move to the lever then to the
[1:00:52] golden candlestick then to the table of
[1:00:55] the showbread then to the golden altar
[1:00:57] or the altar of incense and from there
[1:01:00] to the ark of the covenant now we are
[1:01:03] not in the holiest place yet we already
[1:01:06] dealt with the other court we already we
[1:01:08] are in the holy place
[1:01:10] so it behooves to remove the arc of the
[1:01:13] covenant and to go and still continue to
[1:01:15] deal with this
[1:01:18] everybody okay so far
[1:01:20] did i lose somebody
[1:01:22] put your seat belt because i'm taking
[1:01:24] off pretty quick
[1:01:25] everybody okay so far
[1:01:27] now as we start dealing with this
[1:01:30] we found out that when you enter into
[1:01:33] the tabernacle the first thing that you
[1:01:36] found out is the present altar
[1:01:40] anybody
[1:01:41] okay and that president until we found
[1:01:43] out that he meant the cross to us we
[1:01:45] already went to the mystery of the
[1:01:47] bridge and altar anybody care because
[1:01:50] when roof
[1:01:51] left
[1:01:52] the home edward here
[1:01:55] she went by the law you remember last
[1:01:57] sunday roof entered the field of boars
[1:02:03] everybody here
[1:02:04] through the law everybody here because
[1:02:07] the law provided food for the widows
[1:02:11] and those that were poor ever
[1:02:14] the bible says that if you are ripping
[1:02:17] your field and if some of the food are
[1:02:20] dropping down you cannot clean them you
[1:02:23] must leave them for the poor and for the
[1:02:25] widows everybody so roof enter the field
[1:02:28] of boaz which is a type of crust
[1:02:36] roof entered the field of christ by the
[1:02:38] law
[1:02:40] but here but when she entered this field
[1:02:43] she entered the field the bible says in
[1:02:45] the morning you remember
[1:02:47] and she worked all the way to midday
[1:02:50] but from the morning to the midday boaz
[1:02:53] was not there yet
[1:02:54] so roof operated under the law of moses
[1:02:59] everybody here
[1:03:00] but it was the law
[1:03:03] that brought her into the field of
[1:03:05] powers
[1:03:06] [Music]
[1:03:08] everybody okay so far it was the law of
[1:03:11] moses
[1:03:13] that brought roof to meet powers
[1:03:15] [Music]
[1:03:17] because of following the law she found
[1:03:20] herself in the field of boaz
[1:03:23] she worked under the law first then a
[1:03:26] midday boys came in
[1:03:30] amen
[1:03:33] what are you trying to say brother
[1:03:35] stephen
[1:03:36] paul says this brother kelly but before
[1:03:40] faith came
[1:03:42] [Music]
[1:03:44] can i help you again
[1:03:45] before powers came
[1:03:51] everybody here
[1:03:52] before boroughs came
[1:03:55] we were kept under the water roof was
[1:03:58] working by the law
[1:04:02] everybody okay so far
[1:04:03] we were kept under the law we were water
[1:04:07] we were like prisoner
[1:04:09] like slave
[1:04:11] that's why when roof was operating she
[1:04:14] was really in fear
[1:04:16] somebody can slap her because she's a
[1:04:18] stranger
[1:04:19] what are you doing in israel
[1:04:22] what are you doing here you're not even
[1:04:24] even even in israel get out there i'm
[1:04:26] sorry sir i'm sorry i'm just want to get
[1:04:30] some food
[1:04:31] you strange women
[1:04:34] look at you
[1:04:35] why you didn't stay in your country
[1:04:38] you hulk
[1:04:40] you denominational crop
[1:04:42] [Applause]
[1:04:44] [Music]
[1:04:47] that's what message believer do to
[1:04:49] people
[1:04:49] [Applause]
[1:04:52] you denominational crow and then roof
[1:04:55] goes like this i'm sorry i'm sorry
[1:04:57] because she was operating under the law
[1:05:01] until boasts come
[1:05:04] everybody here
[1:05:06] so we were shut up in the law because
[1:05:09] faith was not there boaz is not there
[1:05:11] yet
[1:05:12] so you can misuse me you can abuse me
[1:05:16] you can do everything you want to do to
[1:05:18] me because boaz is not there
[1:05:21] but wait till boar has come
[1:05:23] [Music]
[1:05:26] everybody okay so far we were kept under
[1:05:29] the law brother robert this anointing is
[1:05:32] juicy
[1:05:33] i don't know what time we're gonna get
[1:05:35] out
[1:05:38] when we were kept under the law we were
[1:05:40] shut up
[1:05:41] onto the water
[1:05:43] which should water
[1:05:45] be water
[1:05:47] roof never seen boys before
[1:05:50] she didn't know the face of boaz
[1:05:53] she didn't have the picture of boaz boaz
[1:05:56] must be revealed to her first
[1:06:01] everybody okay so far
[1:06:03] wherefore the lord was a water
[1:06:07] was a school master to bring us unto him
[1:06:10] he was the law of moses that brought
[1:06:13] roof to meet powers
[1:06:17] the law was important
[1:06:19] because because of the law
[1:06:22] the lord took roof to the field
[1:06:24] and made a way so that roof can meet
[1:06:28] boards
[1:06:29] so the law was a school master
[1:06:32] to bring me to my borders which is jesus
[1:06:35] christ
[1:06:37] everybody okay so far the bible says
[1:06:39] wherefore the law was a school master to
[1:06:42] bring us unto christ that we might be
[1:06:45] water
[1:06:47] by water
[1:06:48] justification
[1:06:51] is not only what luther preached
[1:06:56] because when luther preached
[1:06:58] justification loot to have a loose end
[1:07:02] because remember when the children were
[1:07:04] eating bread
[1:07:06] usually when a child eat food what
[1:07:08] happened to the other food
[1:07:12] they drop into the floor so when luther
[1:07:15] preached there was certain food that
[1:07:17] would drop
[1:07:18] when wesley preached there were certain
[1:07:20] foods that were dropped
[1:07:22] when the pentecostal came they were
[1:07:24] seated and full our job
[1:07:26] even when poor preacher
[1:07:29] [Music]
[1:07:32] because the bible said paul said i
[1:07:34] preached in part
[1:07:36] prop didn't preach everything
[1:07:39] there were certain mysteries there were
[1:07:41] certain truths there were certain
[1:07:44] scriptures that escaped paul
[1:07:47] but until malachi 4 came
[1:07:51] because malachi 4 his message is not
[1:07:54] specific he pick up the loose end
[1:07:58] the loose end of power the loose end of
[1:08:01] arenas the loose end of columba the
[1:08:04] loose end of luta the loose end of
[1:08:07] wesley and he put them all together
[1:08:10] [Music]
[1:08:14] my god
[1:08:16] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:08:18] amen
[1:08:19] so when luther preached justification
[1:08:22] all luther can say is they just live by
[1:08:25] faith
[1:08:27] you are justified go to the altar give
[1:08:31] your life to jesus christ when you stand
[1:08:33] up you are saved that's all
[1:08:36] because luther have his plateau once you
[1:08:39] reach the plateau you remember you
[1:08:41] cannot produce more
[1:08:43] if the master gives you tubes pencil you
[1:08:46] can only produce two
[1:08:48] and stop there if they give you five you
[1:08:50] cannot go beyond five you have to stop
[1:08:53] at five and go there so luther could not
[1:08:56] help himself up but there was something
[1:08:58] brother branham said it was the
[1:09:00] mysterious part of justification that
[1:09:03] was left there and when brother branham
[1:09:06] came brother branham said justification
[1:09:09] goes beyond that
[1:09:14] amen
[1:09:15] brother branham say when you are
[1:09:17] forgiven for something it means that you
[1:09:20] have done it
[1:09:22] you are guilty of it
[1:09:26] but here even though they forgive you
[1:09:28] the record is still there
[1:09:31] but under justification of malachi 4
[1:09:36] when you are justified
[1:09:38] by the cloud
[1:09:40] the supreme judge himself
[1:09:43] it means that you never done it to begin
[1:09:46] with
[1:09:48] [Music]
[1:09:49] [Applause]
[1:09:52] in other words there is no record
[1:09:54] against you
[1:09:56] everything that was against you
[1:09:59] even god himself do not remember
[1:10:06] hallelujah he goes into the book of
[1:10:09] remembrance and wipe every record of you
[1:10:13] [Applause]
[1:10:15] what scene are you talking about
[1:10:19] what scene are you talking about
[1:10:21] are you talking about me i never seen to
[1:10:24] begin with
[1:10:26] that person that you're talking about is
[1:10:28] not me
[1:10:29] he was the devil
[1:10:31] [Applause]
[1:10:35] everybody killed so far so don't build
[1:10:38] complex in your life
[1:10:44] oh my god
[1:10:45] blessed be the name of the lord and paul
[1:10:48] say that a school master bring us unto
[1:10:52] who
[1:10:53] who jesus bore us that we might be water
[1:10:56] by water that's why when boaz met the
[1:11:00] roof he said wait a minute
[1:11:02] don't go anywhere anymore
[1:11:04] you stay here
[1:11:08] guarantee food
[1:11:10] for the rest of the life don't go to any
[1:11:13] field
[1:11:14] if you want to drink don't act like
[1:11:16] stranger
[1:11:18] go over there and go eat
[1:11:20] and i told the young man not to touch
[1:11:22] you
[1:11:27] everybody okay everybody okay
[1:11:30] but after faith is come
[1:11:33] [Music]
[1:11:35] after bo asked him
[1:11:37] and boaz broke everything from the law
[1:11:41] anybody care dead we are no longer under
[1:11:44] water
[1:11:45] my work is different now
[1:11:48] my going to church is different now
[1:11:50] everybody
[1:11:51] because paul says that christ is the end
[1:11:54] of water
[1:11:55] for water
[1:11:56] to everyone that do water
[1:11:59] everyone that is coming from the other
[1:12:02] court that believe on jesus christ
[1:12:05] christ will end the law and we found out
[1:12:07] that not only does chris end the law but
[1:12:10] he changes the law
[1:12:12] let's see first how he crashes brother
[1:12:14] branham saying
[1:12:16] we found out after this dispensation
[1:12:19] then it lasted on that illegalistic
[1:12:22] dispensation
[1:12:24] until the real royal seed came come
[1:12:28] then he took all the water
[1:12:32] upon him
[1:12:34] and paid the price of redemption
[1:12:37] and god's church is back again in water
[1:12:41] in grace back again grace again
[1:12:44] not under the law
[1:12:47] because i met boaz he's breaking every
[1:12:50] complex
[1:12:52] not under the law and legalism
[1:12:55] it's under grace and the promise of god
[1:12:58] the true seed of abraham he taken the
[1:13:01] law upon himself
[1:13:03] and the lord nailed him at the to the
[1:13:06] water
[1:13:07] of what we must do what we must not do
[1:13:11] and must do and must not do everything
[1:13:14] cross nail it at the cross because
[1:13:17] christ paul said is the end of the law
[1:13:20] so once you meet powers
[1:13:22] boards take the law and break it
[1:13:24] completely out
[1:13:27] you will continue to work
[1:13:29] but not more not anymore under the law
[1:13:32] and we found out that the law last
[1:13:35] sunday
[1:13:36] not only does the cross elba clear
[1:13:39] break the law or stop or end the law
[1:13:42] everybody care but the cross introduced
[1:13:46] another law
[1:13:48] remember last sunday
[1:13:50] which is the law of who
[1:13:52] the law of christ ever here
[1:13:55] the old law was under levitical
[1:13:57] priesthood but this law of christ is
[1:14:00] under melchizedek
[1:14:05] and melchizedek it's no longer jews and
[1:14:08] gentiles
[1:14:09] it goes with the spiritual gene of god
[1:14:12] ever here so far now paul says this
[1:14:16] he says that to them that are without
[1:14:19] the law the gentile
[1:14:21] as without the law you remember this
[1:14:23] sunday
[1:14:24] being not with the law of god in other
[1:14:27] words i cannot be without the law
[1:14:29] either i am under the levitical
[1:14:32] priesthood
[1:14:33] or i am under melchizedek you cannot be
[1:14:36] without any of them
[1:14:38] anybody here
[1:14:40] everybody care if you are hidden
[1:14:42] this law will strike you
[1:14:45] if you come in christ the christ take
[1:14:46] you away from here and put you over here
[1:14:49] so paul is saying that now me paul when
[1:14:52] i'm talking to the gentile to the hidden
[1:14:55] i am not dealing with them like somebody
[1:14:58] who doesn't have the law
[1:14:59] i have another law
[1:15:01] but that law is the law of christ
[1:15:04] what is the law of christ
[1:15:08] you ready
[1:15:09] let's go to matthew 17.
[1:15:12] if i can cross this now
[1:15:14] this is a difficult zone
[1:15:17] then
[1:15:18] we good
[1:15:20] let's go to matthew chapter five
[1:15:23] if you dare you can say amen
[1:15:26] again no visitors in this church family
[1:15:29] member
[1:15:31] everybody family member
[1:15:33] so welcome
[1:15:39] because after all
[1:15:41] in the day of the rapture we won't have
[1:15:43] no more church tabernacle tabernacle
[1:15:47] there will be only one tabernacle in
[1:15:49] heaven
[1:15:50] we all will be under malachi 4.
[1:15:54] that's it
[1:15:56] amen
[1:15:57] hallelujah
[1:15:58] matthew chapter 5. if you're there you
[1:16:00] can say amen
[1:16:03] christ came to end the law
[1:16:06] that's what paul says
[1:16:08] what has the law of christ means
[1:16:10] verse 17 if you're there you can say
[1:16:12] amen
[1:16:13] the bible says this i want you to follow
[1:16:15] me carefully keep your seat belt until i
[1:16:18] get the correct altitude
[1:16:19] you there
[1:16:21] think not this is jesus christ
[1:16:24] that i am calm to do whatever
[1:16:30] paul says
[1:16:31] i put the scripture here that christ
[1:16:33] came to end the law
[1:16:35] jesus said i didn't come to destroy the
[1:16:38] law
[1:16:39] it's paul contradicting christ
[1:16:41] we need to understand what's going on
[1:16:44] what is going on
[1:16:45] you there
[1:16:47] think not that i am come to destroy the
[1:16:49] law
[1:16:51] or the
[1:16:53] if you notice
[1:16:54] jesus doesn't say the law only
[1:17:01] because the old testament
[1:17:03] was written number one by moses
[1:17:07] moses wrote the five books of the old
[1:17:09] testament he wrote genesis
[1:17:12] leviticus number deuteronomy and exodus
[1:17:16] moses himself wrote them even though he
[1:17:19] didn't live there
[1:17:20] in some of the story
[1:17:24] so he went in the mind of god
[1:17:27] [Music]
[1:17:28] it's a prophet let me leave that alone
[1:17:31] everybody here and the rest of the book
[1:17:34] that follow you will see the majority of
[1:17:36] them are prophet
[1:17:38] ezekiel isaiah this this this and then
[1:17:41] you have the king and everything
[1:17:43] and now jesus christ summarize
[1:17:45] everything he says i didn't come to
[1:17:48] destroy the law
[1:17:50] everybody here he didn't stop at the law
[1:17:53] he said the law and
[1:17:56] remember when jesus was going to the
[1:17:59] road to emmaus
[1:18:01] everybody here
[1:18:03] when he begin to talk to them the bible
[1:18:05] said he start from who
[1:18:08] he start from moses which is the law
[1:18:10] and
[1:18:12] all the prophet you remember that how
[1:18:14] many knows that scripture i don't want
[1:18:16] you to say brother stephen's saying i
[1:18:18] want you to say the bible says and
[1:18:20] brother bran i'm saying period anybody
[1:18:22] care
[1:18:23] if you need that you let me know it's in
[1:18:25] luke 24 somewhere you're gonna find it
[1:18:27] everybody care now jesus says that think
[1:18:30] not that i come to destroy the law
[1:18:33] or the prophet
[1:18:35] i am not come to destroy but to do what
[1:18:39] to fulfill
[1:18:40] the law and the prophet everybody
[1:18:42] so the purpose of christ
[1:18:45] he came to fulfill the law
[1:18:48] and the prophet and this fulfilling here
[1:18:51] paul is calling that he made an end
[1:18:55] amen
[1:18:58] let's continue
[1:19:00] verse 18 for verily i say unto you
[1:19:04] till heaven and earth pass one jot
[1:19:09] or one teeth
[1:19:11] shall in no
[1:19:13] wise pass from the water
[1:19:16] from the lord until what
[1:19:19] all be what
[1:19:21] so jesus came to fulfill everything
[1:19:24] that's why when he died get the cross he
[1:19:27] said it is
[1:19:29] i finish everything
[1:19:32] everybody here he finish everything
[1:19:36] everybody okay
[1:19:37] what does this finishing means
[1:19:44] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:19:46] the bible says this in first john that
[1:19:49] there is no fear in love
[1:19:53] anybody okay
[1:19:55] but perfect love the water
[1:19:58] in other words love and fear cannot work
[1:20:02] together
[1:20:04] love and fear
[1:20:07] cannot work together
[1:20:09] god was dealing with israel as husband
[1:20:12] and wife
[1:20:15] either you are living in fear as husband
[1:20:18] and wife
[1:20:20] oh you are living in love as husband and
[1:20:22] wife i will get to your marriage down
[1:20:25] the road
[1:20:26] [Music]
[1:20:28] but here
[1:20:30] you can be in your marriage under luther
[1:20:36] you remember that right
[1:20:37] you remember right because under
[1:20:39] justification the marriage is still
[1:20:41] filthy
[1:20:42] [Music]
[1:20:45] a justified man a justified woman if
[1:20:48] they get in marriage it's a trouble
[1:20:51] brother branham said never let them get
[1:20:53] married
[1:20:54] it's gonna be hell
[1:20:56] because the snake is working in both
[1:20:58] ways
[1:20:59] their marriage is worthy
[1:21:05] if i get into this you're gonna get me
[1:21:07] to another road amen
[1:21:09] but
[1:21:10] love and fear cannot work together so
[1:21:14] when love come he cast out fear
[1:21:18] when powers came and entered into the
[1:21:21] field
[1:21:22] he met roof and break everything away
[1:21:25] from ruth
[1:21:29] now roof is serving
[1:21:31] no more on the fear
[1:21:33] that she is a stranger but now she
[1:21:36] belongs to the field of boaz even though
[1:21:38] she is a stranger
[1:21:40] because love christ
[1:21:43] when he comes he takes away your fear
[1:21:47] everybody okay so far
[1:21:49] my god amen
[1:21:51] he says
[1:21:53] because phil has water it's a torture
[1:21:59] when your supervisor is coming at work

[1:44:10] master what is the great commandment in
[1:44:12] the law
[1:44:15] jesus said to him
[1:44:17] everybody okay
[1:44:18] everybody okay make sure you're not
[1:44:20] sleeping everybody okay
[1:44:23] you watching your bible
[1:44:25] okay
[1:44:27] you shall do what
[1:44:30] am i reading a different bible
[1:44:32] you shall
[1:44:33] love the lord your god with all your
[1:44:38] come on and we follow you
[1:44:41] come on and we follow you
[1:44:45] we're going slowly
[1:44:47] verse 38
[1:44:48] this is the water
[1:44:51] and
[1:44:53] go in the old testament go find that
[1:44:58] [Music]
[1:45:00] commandment you know the first
[1:45:02] commandment of moses
[1:45:04] what is it
[1:45:07] here israel
[1:45:09] the lord your god is what
[1:45:11] but jesus said this is the first
[1:45:13] commandment
[1:45:15] go in the law of moses and see if the
[1:45:17] law say you shall love the god with all
[1:45:20] your heart with all your man with all
[1:45:22] this
[1:45:24] where is jesus coming up
[1:45:26] he is giving them the interpretation of
[1:45:29] the law
[1:45:30] we okay
[1:45:32] okay verse 30 uh eight this is the
[1:45:36] first
[1:45:38] and great commandment
[1:45:42] it is between you and god
[1:45:45] you follow me very good
[1:45:48] verse 39 and
[1:45:52] they thought jesus i only need the
[1:45:54] greatest but jesus is opening the second
[1:45:57] and the second is what
[1:46:01] in other words you cannot separate the
[1:46:03] first commandment
[1:46:05] or the great commandment with this one
[1:46:10] do you follow me these commandments are
[1:46:12] intertwined
[1:46:13] you cannot separate them
[1:46:16] the first is you and god
[1:46:20] ever here but the second which is like
[1:46:23] the first
[1:46:24] is what
[1:46:26] the second is like unto it you shall
[1:46:29] love your
[1:46:32] as your
[1:46:34] first body on this water
[1:46:38] hang water
[1:46:41] all the water
[1:46:43] all the law and the water
[1:46:46] in other words the entire old testament
[1:46:50] you can put it together
[1:46:53] in two commandments
[1:46:57] the love of god
[1:46:59] and the love of your neighbor
[1:47:02] that's why john said how can you love
[1:47:05] god
[1:47:06] that you don't see
[1:47:08] and you cannot love your brother that
[1:47:11] you see
[1:47:12] so everything that i gave moses you
[1:47:15] missed it
[1:47:17] it was only one commandment
[1:47:20] if you catch that commandment
[1:47:23] the law will not be a burden for you
[1:47:27] if you understand this two commandments
[1:47:31] you don't need to carry the book of the
[1:47:33] law
[1:47:38] do you get what i'm saying
[1:47:40] in other words whatever i want to do i
[1:47:43] only have to check two things
[1:47:47] is he good to
[1:47:48] god check
[1:47:51] easy good to my brother
[1:47:53] check
[1:47:54] you go
[1:47:58] you're clear
[1:48:00] if not you have to memorize everything
[1:48:03] do not commit adultery do not steal if
[1:48:06] you love your brother
[1:48:08] if you love your wife
[1:48:10] are you gonna commit adultery
[1:48:13] so instead of memorabilizing the
[1:48:16] commandment
[1:48:17] just love your wife
[1:48:19] and he will take care of adultery
[1:48:22] do you get what i'm saying
[1:48:26] you can memorize the commandment and be
[1:48:28] a legalistic
[1:48:30] or you can get the key of the
[1:48:32] commandment of the message within the
[1:48:35] commandment
[1:48:36] [Applause]
[1:48:39] [Music]
[1:48:45] brother branham say when he wrote
[1:48:48] a letter to his wife he said how are you
[1:48:51] doing

[1:48:55] they can give it to you
[1:48:57] you will read oh okay this is his wife
[1:48:59] he's telling him that the kids are
[1:49:01] sleeping
[1:49:02] that's what you read
[1:49:05] when you give to brother brother uh
[1:49:07] a letter
[1:49:08] when he read
[1:49:10] and put the kids to bed the kids are
[1:49:13] sleeping
[1:49:14] he is reading something you don't get
[1:49:17] [Applause]
[1:49:21] amen
[1:49:24] oh they help me everybody here
[1:49:27] you say i miss you you miss a target
[1:49:29] maybe
[1:49:30] you miss an appointment
[1:49:33] you might miss a lot of stuff
[1:49:35] but to the one who say i miss you he
[1:49:37] knows what he's saying

[1:50:01] if you understand what i'm saying you'll
[1:50:04] be like no doctor not today
[1:50:07] but because you miss my the
[1:50:09] interpretation you are sitting there not
[1:50:12] knowing what we talking

[1:50:18] ever here when i say bring a certain
[1:50:20] instrument she understand maybe the

[1:50:26] good yes i'm good she knows what is
[1:50:28] going on
[1:50:30] everybody okay so jesus is summarizing
[1:50:33] everything and saying this whole book
[1:50:37] that you struggle with it for so many
[1:50:40] times that it becomes a burden for you
[1:50:43] until you hate to go to church
[1:50:46] you didn't understand it was only
[1:50:49] bundled up in one thing
[1:50:51] the love of me
[1:50:53] and the love of your neighbor
[1:50:55] what are you trying to say
[1:50:58] go to mark chapter 12.
[1:51:01] lord help me
[1:51:02] mark chapter 12
[1:51:04] if you dare you can say amen
[1:51:06] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:51:09] verse 28.
[1:51:12] you dead
[1:51:14] and one of the scrub came
[1:51:17] and having heard them reasoning together
[1:51:19] and perceived that he answered them well
[1:51:22] ask him which is the
[1:51:25] over there he was the great commander
[1:51:28] everybody okay now
[1:51:30] which is the first commandment of all
[1:51:32] and jesus answered him the first of all
[1:51:35] the commandment is he o israel the lord
[1:51:38] your god is what
[1:51:41] that one you will find
[1:51:43] and you shall love the lord your god
[1:51:45] with all your
[1:51:47] and we follow your soul and we follow
[1:51:49] your mind and we follow you
[1:51:52] this is the first commandment and the
[1:51:54] second is like
[1:51:56] namely this you shall love your neighbor
[1:51:59] as yourself
[1:52:00] there is no
[1:52:03] everybody clear there is no other
[1:52:06] commandment greater than what
[1:52:09] these two commandments are at the top
[1:52:12] and the entire law in other words every
[1:52:14] time you find the law
[1:52:16] if you look closely
[1:55:07] [Music]
[1:55:12] everybody okay did you see that
[1:55:15] so
[1:55:16] if you love somebody
[1:55:18] you're already fulfilling the law
[1:55:20] in other words you are already living
[1:55:22] the law
[1:55:25] you don't need somebody to teach you
[1:55:28] you don't need somebody you don't need
[1:55:29] to carry a big bubble like this
[1:55:33] because the bible is love
[1:55:36] everybody okay
[1:55:38] verse nine for this
[1:55:40] you shall not commit
[1:55:44] you shall not you shall not
[1:55:47] you shall not bear false witness you
[1:55:50] shall not covet
[1:55:52] if there be any other commandment
[1:55:55] it is briefly comprehended
[1:55:58] in this saying
[1:56:00] in other words any other commitment you
[1:56:02] can give me from the bible all of them
[1:56:05] means this
[1:56:08] everybody here it means what
[1:56:11] all that i have told you you shall not
[1:56:13] commit adultery you shall not steal you
[1:56:15] shall not do
[1:56:16] paul is saying all those commandments
[1:56:18] means one thing
[1:56:20] what does it mean
[1:56:22] namely this you shall love
[1:56:25] your neighbor as what
[1:56:27] because if you love your neighbor you
[1:56:29] won't steal from him
[1:56:31] everybody okay if you love your neighbor
[1:56:34] you won't commit adultery
[1:56:36] if you love your neighbor you won't
[1:56:38] comfort his stuff
[1:56:40] if you all love your neighbor you won't
[1:56:42] be a fault
[1:56:43] against your neighbor so when you just
[1:56:45] love your neighbor you're already
[1:56:47] fulfilling all the commitment
[1:56:50] everybody okay
[1:56:53] verse 10
[1:56:54] love works no what
[1:56:57] nothing wrong to his neighbor therefore
[1:56:59] love
[1:57:01] is the fulfilling of water
[1:57:03] so everything that christ came to do
[1:57:07] here
[1:57:08] is combined in the love of god
[1:57:14] so when you look at the law and you
[1:57:16] don't see the love of god you miss god
[1:57:19] that's why brother branham said if you
[1:57:21] read the bible and you don't see jesus
[1:57:25] christ who is the love of god in every
[1:57:28] scripture you read it wrong
[1:57:31] you miss the old testament it's gonna be
[1:57:34] a bunch of commandments instead of being
[1:57:36] the love of god
[1:57:38] everybody okay so far
[1:57:40] let's go take off now
[1:57:42] my god where am i
[1:57:44] amen
[1:57:46] brother branham said to the stranger in
[1:57:48] our gate we want to welcome you back
[1:57:52] come tonight
[1:57:53] to the evening service if you are in the
[1:57:56] city and would like to drop back and be
[1:57:58] with us again tonight
[1:58:00] i'll be very happy
[1:58:02] the door is always open
[1:58:04] everybody care
[1:58:06] we have no denomination
[1:58:09] karma no water
[1:58:13] but who
[1:58:14] no law but what
[1:58:17] where did brother brother get that why
[1:58:20] did brother brother say that now you
[1:58:22] understand
[1:58:23] in other words our law
[1:58:25] is the love of christ
[1:58:29] everybody here brother branham said and
[1:58:32] no book by the water
[1:58:34] the leader tabernacle has no membership
[1:58:38] but we have water
[1:58:40] we have no creed but what
[1:58:42] no love but what
[1:58:47] so the law
[1:58:48] of christ
[1:58:49] is love
[1:58:51] that's why when boaz meet roof
[1:58:54] he crush everything
[1:58:56] i love you
[1:58:59] and because i love you you cannot behave
[1:59:01] like this
[1:59:03] everybody okay so far
[1:59:05] let's go back to ruth chapter 2
[1:59:08] lord help me
[1:59:12] roof chapter 2 where we were
[1:59:15] we are in the field of boaz if you dare
[1:59:17] you can say amen
[1:59:20] i'm good in time
[1:59:22] it's just we taken too far in eternity
[1:59:27] it's not even one
[1:59:28] o'clock it's not one o'clock yet it's
[1:59:31] not one o'clock
[1:59:34] it's just the the the
[1:59:38] we are way with the ego so if you're
[1:59:40] worrying about time it's not one o'clock
[1:59:43] yet
[1:59:44] it's the way we are
[1:59:46] i'm dodging a story
[1:59:48] [Laughter]
[1:59:50] so relax now okay
[1:59:53] don't let the devil bother you like i'm
[1:59:55] already i'm already full i'm
[1:59:58] it's spilling over
[2:00:01] some have little stomachs um
[2:00:04] okay
[2:00:05] spiritually everybody okay
[2:00:08] let's go to roof chapter two you there
[2:00:12] job to verse 8
[2:00:15] we are under roof in holiness
[2:00:17] we entered the field of boaz
[2:00:20] the law was a school master introduced
[2:00:22] boaz to roof and boaz break the law

[2:00:40] if you and then modify you reapers when
[2:00:42] you put the stuff make sure purposely
[2:00:45] drop certain things for her
[2:00:48] the work environment become a joy
[2:00:51] it's no longer fear
[2:00:55] everybody here because the law she
[2:00:58] christ changed the law
[2:01:01] to a new law
[2:01:02] the old testament it was fear and
[2:01:04] trembling if somebody touched the
[2:01:06] mountain they kill him if a beast touch
[2:01:08] the mountain they kill him but we'll
[2:01:10] come to another mountain man zion that's
[2:01:13] a different mountain you can touch that
[2:01:15] god and nothing happened
[2:01:17] he's not a god that is chasing you but
[2:01:19] he's a god that have his arm open
[2:01:23] to love you it's a different god
[2:01:26] amen
[2:01:27] because israel was afraid you go to the
[2:01:29] doctor don't go there you're going to
[2:01:31] get killed
[2:01:32] wrong interpretation of god
[2:01:34] normally you go to the temple to see god
[2:01:36] yes i want to see god
[2:01:38] why god this is you this is you who
[2:01:40] created heaven and earth but because of
[2:01:43] the law israel don't want even up they
[2:01:45] say moses you talk to him
[2:01:47] not us you just tell us because what we
[2:01:49] see there it's too much
[2:01:51] they misinterpret the law the lord
[2:01:53] became fearful
[2:01:55] yet god was dealing there with them as
[2:01:57] husband and wife
[2:01:58] now you wanna come to your wife and your
[2:02:01] wife is always afraid of you what kind
[2:02:03] of marriage is that
[2:02:05] you want to put your hand around her
[2:02:08] what kind of marriage is that
[2:02:09] it's a trouble
[2:02:11] everybody okay
[2:02:13] okay let's go to ruth chapter 2 verse 9.
[2:02:16] if you there you can say amen
[2:02:18] verse eight
[2:02:20] then say boys to ruth
[2:02:22] hear you not my daughter

[2:02:27] yet he's gonna get married to that
[2:02:29] daughter

[2:02:41] but about here fast by the water
[2:02:46] when we talk about boars
[2:02:49] everybody okay
[2:02:51] we have a tendency to think that
[2:02:53] everything is perfect
[2:02:55] in the field of boaz
[2:03:00] anybody here
[2:03:01] when boss came
[2:03:03] roof was following after the young man
[2:03:07] ever here
[2:03:08] boys look at that order he said that's
[2:03:11] not a correct

[2:03:16] cannot be following men
[2:03:21] are you following me

[2:04:19] do you follow me
[2:04:20] it was hidden right here

[2:04:26] let's
[2:04:27] let your eyes be on the field remember
[2:04:30] the beginning i told you roof is under
[2:04:32] women
[2:04:33] you remember
[2:04:35] okay let your eyes be on the field that
[2:04:38] they do rip
[2:04:40] and go you after them not after men
[2:04:43] anymore after women because you're a
[2:04:46] woman
[2:04:47] you're a young lady i don't want you to
[2:04:49] be around man
[2:04:52] here
[2:04:53] have i not charged the young men follow
[2:04:56] me carefully
[2:04:58] that they shall not do what
[2:05:02] if the field of boars
[2:05:05] was perfect
[2:05:07] why did he have to caution the young man
[2:05:12] back here
[2:05:13] so there is danger in sanctification
[2:05:20] i'm going slowly
[2:05:22] sanctification
[2:05:23] is roof serving brother branham say that
[2:05:26] i already gave you the quote and under
[2:05:28] sanctification you are serving in the
[2:05:31] field of war
[2:05:32] but in that field sanctification carry a
[2:05:36] danger
[2:05:37] because of the law
[2:05:40] because the law magnifies sin
[2:05:45] but here
[2:05:46] and he has a tendency to bring abuse
[2:05:53] i'm going slowly it's going to help you
[2:05:56] everybody here
[2:05:57] he says i charge not the young man to
[2:06:01] touch you do you know the word touch
[2:06:03] means what to molest you so there was a
[2:06:06] potential for a reaper to molest a young
[2:06:09] woman
[2:06:10] in the legalistic setting
[2:06:16] [Music]
[2:06:18] everybody here when the church in this
[2:06:22] message is operating under legalistic
[2:06:26] he have a spirit of sexually abuse
[2:06:29] that is hidden there
[2:06:32] [Music]
[2:06:37] let me help you up again
[2:06:39] that's why you hear a pastor legalistic
[2:06:42] legalistic other women long dresses and
[2:06:44] before you know it the pastor was
[2:06:45] sleeping with a woman the pastor was
[2:06:47] sleeping with a woman the pastor was
[2:06:48] sleeping with a woman because the pastor
[2:06:51] was operating under legalistic
[2:06:54] jesus
[2:06:56] because if the pastor truly have the
[2:06:58] love of god that woman is your sister
[2:07:02] that woman is like your daughter are you
[2:07:05] gonna like to do to somebody else's
[2:07:07] daughter what you want to somebody to do
[2:07:10] to your daughter
[2:07:11] because the lord say whatever you want
[2:07:13] people to do to you do to them do you
[2:07:16] want somebody to take advantage of your
[2:07:18] daughter why do you take other daughters
[2:07:21] in the church
[2:07:22] it's covered usually under legalistic
[2:07:25] spirit
[2:07:28] because of abuse
[2:07:31] paul
[2:07:34] amen okay
[2:07:36] [Music]
[2:07:37] paul said now concerning the things
[2:07:40] whereof he wrote unto me it is good for
[2:07:43] men to water
[2:07:45] not to do water
[2:07:48] but i say do not touch
[2:07:51] a woman
[2:07:52] in other words that touch means sexually
[2:07:55] touched
[2:07:56] to be planned with you
[2:07:58] everybody in other words no young man
[2:08:02] has a right to sleep with a sister in
[2:08:05] this church
[2:08:06] [Music]
[2:08:10] can i repeat it again
[2:08:11] you who are missing on the internet make
[2:08:14] sure you listen to this sermon no young
[2:08:17] man has a right to sleep with a sister
[2:08:20] in this church if you are not married
[2:08:25] [Applause]
[2:08:28] try to molest the child
[2:08:31] i will be the one calling the police
[2:08:36] i will put you to jail first
[2:08:38] then i will come to jail to help you up
[2:08:41] when you're already inside the jail
[2:08:48] did you hear me
[2:08:50] did you hear me
[2:08:52] paul said
[2:08:53] nevertheless to avoid water
[2:08:56] let every man have his own water and let
[2:09:00] every woman have her own water
[2:09:06] having a form of what brother killing
[2:09:10] sanctification
[2:09:12] long choices
[2:09:14] evil evil
[2:09:16] evil
[2:09:20] but here
[2:09:21] having a form of godliness but denying
[2:09:25] the power thereof because the power of
[2:09:28] the holy spirit will unveil them
[2:09:30] they don't like the power in the church
[2:09:33] they want to operate the church and the
[2:09:35] legalist
[2:09:39] but here
[2:09:40] from there
[2:09:41] from such the water
[2:09:44] for of this thought out there which do
[2:09:47] water
[2:09:49] and lead water
[2:09:51] silly women laddered with sin led away
[2:09:53] with death as water
[2:09:55] every water
[2:09:57] they learn all the
[2:09:58] mysteries but never ever to come to the
[2:10:02] water
[2:10:03] knowledge of what
[2:10:05] they missed the message
[2:10:09] they thought the message was wrong
[2:10:12] they thought the message was about your
[2:10:15] floor
[2:10:16] and before you know it the pastor take
[2:10:18] advantage of the sisters in the church
[2:10:23] i told the young men not to touch you
[2:10:29] everybody cares so far everybody cares
[2:10:32] so far
[2:10:33] jump to verse
[2:10:34] verse 15
[2:10:37] when
[2:10:38] you there
[2:10:39] when she was risen up to green
[2:10:42] boaz commended his young man saying let
[2:10:46] her glean even among them
[2:10:49] and do what
[2:10:51] do you know that word reproach means
[2:10:52] what
[2:10:53] insult her not
[2:10:58] no preacher have a right to insult the
[2:11:00] sister
[2:11:02] she's not your daughter
[2:11:04] she's not your wife you must respect her
[2:11:07] everybody here but what do we see in the
[2:11:09] message
[2:11:12] what do we see in the message
[2:11:14] legalistic spirit have usually an abused
[2:11:17] spirit hidden behind it
[2:11:22] and you hear all kind of story this
[2:11:24] pastor did this to the woman this pastor
[2:11:26] did this to the woman this person you
[2:11:28] get to church okay take off your shoes
[2:11:32] you don't need to take off your shoes
[2:11:34] lay the message
[2:11:43] oh my god the bible says this
[2:11:46] jesus said then speak jesus to the
[2:11:48] multitude to his disciples saying
[2:11:50] describe and
[2:11:54] do you know a pharisee brother branham
[2:11:55] say he's an actor
[2:11:56] sit in moses's seat
[2:12:00] they know the coach
[2:12:04] anybody care
[2:12:05] oh therefore whatsoever they beat you
[2:12:08] observe
[2:12:09] that do what
[2:12:10] follow that but do not ye after the
[2:12:14] water
[2:12:15] what they speak is not what they do in
[2:12:17] themselves for they say and do not
[2:12:21] for they bind heavy burden
[2:12:24] and grief used to be water
[2:12:26] and lay them on men's shoulder but they
[2:12:29] themselves will not move them with water
[2:12:33] the message is heavy
[2:12:35] it's a bunch of law
[2:12:37] everybody here but all their works they
[2:12:40] do
[2:12:41] for to be water
[2:12:43] it's a show
[2:12:45] they make broad villagers and enlarge
[2:12:48] the borders of their garment war until
[2:12:50] you scrub and pharisee what
[2:12:54] for ye do what
[2:12:57] what
[2:13:00] how can you find a fault in a pharisee
[2:13:02] everything even his dresses is correct
[2:13:05] but jesus look he say you know the
[2:13:08] widows in the church that have babies
[2:13:13] [Music]
[2:13:15] out the father of those babies are the
[2:13:17] pharisees
[2:13:19] jesus
[2:13:21] am i reading a different bible
[2:13:23] he said buddha the one that divides with
[2:13:26] those houses and for practice make water
[2:13:30] give them to pray they're going to pray
[2:13:32] with brother branham you came in 1963
[2:13:36] watch their life
[2:13:39] watch their life
[2:13:41] because they miss the purpose of the law
[2:13:46] everybody here
[2:13:48] everybody here
[2:13:49] ever here so if you burn in a message
[2:13:52] whether you are born outside of the
[2:13:54] message remember this
[2:13:57] your heart looks like that
[2:14:00] according to brother branham
[2:14:03] everybody here so when you meet bars and
[2:14:06] crushed
[2:14:07] you are still not clean yet anybody
[2:14:10] they pick you up under justification and
[2:14:13] something happened to you
[2:14:15] and brother branham says
[2:14:17] that we believe in justification by
[2:14:19] faith romans 5 1 we believe that after a
[2:14:23] person has been justified by faith he
[2:14:26] has peace with the lord jesus christ
[2:14:28] but it is possible that this same person
[2:14:32] could have what
[2:14:34] habits such as water
[2:14:36] smoking doing things that he should not
[2:14:38] do what of the water
[2:14:41] that's why the snake is there and
[2:14:43] brother branham said the snake is still
[2:14:45] there even though you give your heart to
[2:14:46] jesus christ
[2:14:48] i already gave you the quote i'm sorry
[2:14:50] ever here
[2:14:52] so we found out last sunday that this
[2:14:55] process god gave you a new heart
[2:14:57] you already know what a new heart is and
[2:14:59] back here you get in the water baptism
[2:15:02] and it shifts you to the candlestick
[2:15:05] what happened in the candlestick brother
[2:15:07] branham say there is seven golden
[2:15:10] candlestick
[2:15:11] by the holy place
[2:15:14] and it's giving water
[2:15:15] remember the candlestick
[2:15:18] project light to the table of the show

[2:16:53] light of the seven golden water

[2:16:59] which is the burning which is burning
[2:17:01] olive water
[2:17:03] the holy spirit is burning on the
[2:17:05] messenger the messenger is giving a
[2:17:08] light and that light brother branham say
[2:17:10] is a sanctification by the blood
[2:17:13] what is the blood that's sanctified
[2:17:16] you ready
[2:17:17] brother brother says this
[2:17:20] pure and not adulterated
[2:17:23] oh hallelujah
[2:17:25] living soon for the sky man
[2:17:28] think your garments
[2:17:30] which are filthy
[2:17:32] wash
[2:17:32] by the water of the water
[2:17:37] the world becomes water
[2:17:40] so your blood is not the liquid
[2:17:45] your blood now is the word of god
[2:17:48] and the word of god that is coming from
[2:17:50] the candlestick
[2:17:52] in other words the word or the message
[2:17:55] of the hour
[2:17:56] is what is going to clean you up
[2:18:04] everybody here you cannot be cleaned by
[2:18:07] the world of luther
[2:18:09] you cannot be cleaned by the message of
[2:18:11] wesley
[2:18:12] this is another day this is a broad edge
[2:18:16] you must be under specific water
[2:18:19] [Applause]
[2:18:22] hallelujah he said the world became
[2:18:25] blood and the blood bled for you
[2:18:29] and you are watching the water
[2:18:34] according to jeremiah i will clean you
[2:18:37] with water
[2:18:39] clean water everybody here those water
[2:18:43] is not the water liquid
[2:18:45] but here
[2:18:46] he said the word bleeding the life of
[2:18:49] god in the word and the word was bled
[2:18:52] for you
[2:18:52] that you might be water
[2:18:55] from the water
[2:18:56] of this water
[2:18:58] the church ages
[2:18:59] the churches amen and be clean and
[2:19:03] sanctified by the washing of the water
[2:19:06] of the water
[2:19:08] and make your mind and your heart stay
[2:19:11] on water and on his water
[2:19:15] so the candlestick when they shine they
[2:19:19] sun to the show bread which is the
[2:19:21] message of your day
[2:19:23] and as you begin to eat the message
[2:19:26] that message that word
[2:19:28] is your blood
[2:19:30] that is cleaning you up
[2:19:36] lord help me
[2:19:37] so the candlestick
[2:19:39] are directing you to the table of the
[2:19:41] showbread
[2:19:42] what happened up there
[2:19:44] brother branham said not his
[2:19:45] sanctification the second stage of it it
[2:19:49] cleans the mind
[2:19:52] because remember
[2:19:54] as you moving along here brother branham
[2:19:57] say your snake is there
[2:19:59] and your habit is still hanging around
[2:20:02] but here you go with it you come there
[2:20:05] but somebody gotta deal with this
[2:20:08] you cannot get in the holiest like this
[2:20:11] because sanctification means to clean
[2:20:13] you and to set you aside for service so
[2:20:16] god can fill you with the spirit
[2:20:19] everybody here brother bottom say
[2:20:22] decrease the man
[2:20:24] set the heart the mind of the heart in
[2:20:26] order of holiness
[2:20:28] a man can repent of sin
[2:20:31] and he's still thinking maybe an immoral
[2:20:33] man
[2:20:34] every moral looking woman he found is
[2:20:36] still there maybe he's a drunkard every
[2:20:39] time he smell the drink it's still there
[2:20:41] but when he gets sanctified that cleans
[2:20:44] the water
[2:20:45] the desire out of him he takes the want
[2:20:49] outfit away he can still be tempted but
[2:20:53] it takes the want of it away still he's
[2:20:56] not right yet
[2:20:59] justification you are saved but you're
[2:21:02] not right yet
[2:21:04] sanctification it cleans the desire out
[2:21:07] but you still not right until you
[2:21:10] receive the holy ghost
[2:21:12] everybody here and brother branham is
[2:21:14] saying that when you are justified you
[2:21:17] can still smell
[2:21:19] whiskey
[2:21:20] and be tempted
[2:21:22] amen
[2:21:23] so just so so sanctification will come
[2:21:27] to remove that desire away
[2:21:30] so now even if you smell whiskey
[2:21:33] it doesn't tempt you but the snake is
[2:21:35] still there
[2:21:37] what is going on hallelujah
[2:21:43] you remember that the table of the
[2:21:45] showbread this bread were mixed with
[2:21:48] frankincense
[2:21:49] you remember that we already went
[2:21:51] through that
[2:21:52] brother branham say
[2:21:55] so his life was anointed with
[2:21:58] frankincense which means to jehovah's
[2:22:00] water and we found out according to the
[2:22:03] message that frankie says means service
[2:22:07] and the bread that was in the table of
[2:22:10] the show bread was a bread that must be
[2:22:13] sprinkled with sanchez in other words
[2:22:15] it's a word
[2:22:19] it's a word
[2:22:20] that puts you in service
[2:22:24] it's a word that requires you to do some
[2:22:27] work
[2:22:30] you must serve
[2:22:32] because boaz never took away the work
[2:22:36] he only took the law away from the work
[2:22:40] everybody okay so far
[2:22:42] what are you talking about brother
[2:22:43] branham
[2:22:45] climb up and i'm gonna go to the airport
[2:22:48] he said the next thing she has to do
[2:22:51] she had to work
[2:22:53] this is roof
[2:22:54] she already got justified
[2:22:57] she become uh
[2:23:06] do you see why i have to break that
[2:23:07] legalistic
[2:23:08] brother bradham said roof serving
[2:23:11] means roof become legalistic
[2:23:14] walk on the
[2:23:17] under legalistic
[2:23:19] or under moses
[2:23:23] you see now
[2:23:24] she had to become a legalist
[2:23:27] she had to work out her own
[2:23:30] salvation we fear and trembling like you
[2:23:34] did
[2:23:38] she went out into the field and put her
[2:23:41] clothes upon her and went out into the
[2:23:43] field and cleaned behind the water in
[2:23:46] order to get sustaining water brother
[2:23:48] branham said the work that roof was
[2:23:50] doing she became legalistic
[2:23:53] why she entered the field by the law
[2:23:56] but that law brought her to christ
[2:23:59] boaz but after boaz she continued the
[2:24:02] legalistic approach
[2:24:04] but under a different priesthood
[2:24:09] anybody okay
[2:24:11] what was she doing
[2:24:12] she was trying
[2:24:14] to find favor with boaz
[2:24:18] so she worked her way through the stage
[2:24:20] of water
[2:24:22] what is a legalistic brother branham
[2:24:25] wherefore my beloved as he have always
[2:24:29] obeyed
[2:24:30] not in my water
[2:24:33] i don't want you to be a bunch of
[2:24:34] hypocrites
[2:24:36] when i mean there everybody behave good
[2:24:39] when i'm not there everybody's back to
[2:24:40] the problem that's legalistic
[2:24:43] but here but now much more in my water
[2:24:47] so whether the messenger is there or not
[2:24:50] you're still living the word of god
[2:24:53] work out your own water with water and
[2:24:57] water

[2:25:04] for it is god
[2:25:07] which the water

[2:25:11] and to do his water

[2:25:28] branham say the lord believe it by faith
[2:25:31] and come into the land
[2:25:33] but the methodist thought sanctification
[2:25:37] which which was the
[2:25:40] the legalistic standpoint of it
[2:25:43] so sanctification is a legalistic stand
[2:25:46] of looter
[2:25:47] but here why because you're coming with
[2:25:50] a snake
[2:25:51] and you have habit
[2:25:53] so they gotta chop those habits away
[2:25:55] how do you chop them away
[2:25:57] not under the law of moses
[2:26:00] anybody here
[2:26:01] you got to do something
[2:26:03] i got to quit
[2:26:07] i got to let my hair grow
[2:26:10] say the women
[2:26:11] of course they don't do it no more but
[2:26:14] they didn't do it
[2:26:15] let the hair grow they had to quit
[2:26:17] wearing pants on the interface they had
[2:26:20] to wear their skate wrong
[2:26:22] short like the other they had to do
[2:26:24] something that is what she did the state
[2:26:27] of justification the state of water
[2:26:32] now yes resting was what roof under
[2:26:35] justification do you see amen roof under
[2:26:38] sanctification doing what
[2:26:40] underwater
[2:26:45] what do you mean roof laboring brother
[2:26:47] branham says this pay attention and i'm
[2:26:49] going to go to the airport because this
[2:26:51] is too much
[2:26:52] we are not too much but loaded we all
[2:26:56] claim to be the bride of christ
[2:27:00] how many believe to be the bride of
[2:27:01] christ
[2:27:03] and yet so untrue
[2:27:10] what
[2:27:11] would make this untrueness
[2:27:14] by leaving contrary to the
[2:27:22] i'm going slowly to the discipline that
[2:27:25] god has laid out for his bride to live
[2:27:28] with
[2:27:29] so this message this word this blood
[2:27:34] have discipline
[2:27:40] under the law
[2:27:42] watch out
[2:27:45] that is my own opinion the bible and
[2:27:48] it's the invaluable word of god i
[2:27:50] believe
[2:27:52] what cleans me brother stephen it's the
[2:27:55] word
[2:27:57] how does the word cleanse me
[2:28:00] yeah clean
[2:28:02] through the
[2:28:04] which i have water
[2:28:06] so the word that cleans you must be a
[2:28:09] spoken word
[2:28:11] i'm going slowly now i'm getting into
[2:28:13] your just into your sanctification ever
[2:28:16] here
[2:28:17] number two
[2:28:18] sanctify them through the
[2:28:22] that word is what
[2:28:24] so the word that is sanctifying you is
[2:28:28] the truth
[2:28:29] and the truth is jesus christ
[2:28:35] so your sanctification is crust
[2:28:39] if you need a bible scripture i'm going
[2:28:41] to show you where the bible say christ
[2:28:43] is our sanctification
[2:28:45] it's written in 1st corinthian chapter
[2:28:46] 2.
[2:28:47] everybody here
[2:28:49] husband love your wife even as christ
[2:28:52] also loved the church and gave him his
[2:28:55] uh and gave himself for it that hima
[2:28:59] and the water
[2:29:01] with the washing off the water by there
[2:29:05] that he presented to himself
[2:29:08] air
[2:29:10] not having water
[2:29:12] and water
[2:29:13] or say any such thing but it should be
[2:29:17] and without water
[2:29:19] everything that you need is in the world
[2:29:24] how do i get sanctified by that word
[2:29:27] ever here so far
[2:29:30] if
[2:29:31] brother stephen we are not under the law
[2:29:34] we under love and christ become our
[2:29:37] sanctification
[2:29:38] we under the law of christ now brother
[2:29:41] branham say that we roof under
[2:29:44] sanctification is roof under legalism
[2:29:47] what kind of legalistic is it
[2:29:49] am i back again under the law
[2:29:53] there is a different law what can the
[2:29:55] law am i operating in
[2:29:59] you ready
[2:30:01] the bible say by this we know that we
[2:30:05] love the children of god
[2:30:08] when we love
[2:30:09] and keep his water
[2:30:12] and this is the love of god
[2:30:15] that we keep his commandments and his
[2:30:18] commandments are not
[2:30:21] you cannot have a word without love
[2:30:26] he make the world heavy
[2:30:30] you follow me if i give you a
[2:30:33] commandment without seasoning that
[2:30:36] commandment with the love
[2:30:38] that commandment is grievous
[2:30:42] that's what jesus said everything i give
[2:30:45] you in the old testament it was just an
[2:30:47] expression of love
[2:30:49] all i was looking for you is to love me
[2:30:52] and to love one another if you love me
[2:30:55] and you love one another you don't even
[2:30:56] have to worry about the law
[2:31:00] you are fulfilling the law everybody
[2:31:02] here if you love me do what
[2:31:06] you don't keep the commandment because
[2:31:09] of hell
[2:31:18] there are things
[2:31:20] that you need to be aware of
[2:31:24] number one is heaven
[2:31:27] everybody here
[2:31:29] number two is hell
[2:31:32] number three is reward
[2:31:36] number four is torment
[2:31:40] or
[2:31:41] punishment
[2:31:44] everybody
[2:31:46] jesus said
[2:31:47] if you love me
[2:31:50] keep my commandment everybody
[2:31:53] the keeping of this commandment
[2:31:56] has nothing to do with heaven
[2:32:01] amen
[2:32:03] are you catching me
[2:32:05] are you catching me
[2:32:07] you are keeping the commandment
[2:32:09] not because you want to go to heaven
[2:32:15] do you follow me because if god take
[2:32:18] heaven off
[2:32:20] are you going to keep his commandment
[2:32:23] are we okay
[2:32:24] are you catching it
[2:32:26] are you catching it
[2:32:28] you're not keeping the commandment of
[2:32:30] god because you are afraid to go to hell
[2:32:38] follow me
[2:32:39] you don't do adultery because of
[2:32:42] sexually transmitted disease
[2:32:47] i don't cheat on my wife because i don't
[2:32:50] want to get aids
[2:32:51] you're a sinner
[2:32:55] if they remove eggs
[2:32:58] guess what
[2:32:59] you're going to cheat
[2:33:02] but here you don't do the commandment
[2:33:05] because you expect a reward from god
[2:33:13] but here i'm gonna do what god asked me
[2:33:16] to do because god will bless me
[2:33:18] wrong
[2:33:21] i'm going slowly i gotta cut that
[2:33:23] legalistic away from me i'm have to go
[2:33:26] to church because if i don't go to
[2:33:28] church i will miss heaven wrong
[2:33:33] i'm going to church because if i don't
[2:33:36] go to church i will be going to hell
[2:33:39] wrong
[2:33:40] amen
[2:33:42] i don't go to church because if i miss
[2:33:45] going to church god will punish me
[2:33:49] longer
[2:33:55] everybody here
[2:33:56] that's why brother branham said
[2:33:58] if i meet
[2:34:00] god do you follow me
[2:34:03] and god tells me
[2:34:05] that william marion branham you are
[2:34:08] going to hell
[2:34:10] not to heaven
[2:34:12] to hell
[2:34:13] brother branham say
[2:34:15] if that is his will
[2:34:17] i will go to hell
[2:34:22] do you follow me
[2:34:23] do you follow me but if i go to her i
[2:34:27] still love him
[2:34:30] [Applause]
[2:34:33] in other words lord so your perfect will
[2:34:37] in my life
[2:34:38] is for me to go to hell
[2:34:40] god said yes brother branham say i will
[2:34:42] tell god thank you very much because
[2:34:45] what you do to me is always perfect if
[2:34:48] you think i should go to hell i might as
[2:34:51] well go to loyal but i still love you
[2:34:54] god
[2:34:56] [Applause]
[2:35:00] imagine when nothing can separate me
[2:35:04] from the love of god
[2:35:07] where the heaven
[2:35:09] where the hell where the punishment
[2:35:12] whatever it is nothing
[2:35:14] [Music]
[2:35:17] do you follow me
[2:35:18] i'm trying to take the legalistic off of
[2:35:20] you
[2:35:22] i am not serving god
[2:35:26] because of going to heaven
[2:35:29] [Music]
[2:35:34] i am not playing an instrument here
[2:35:36] because i am i'm gonna get a reward
[2:35:42] legalistic
[2:35:44] oh if i don't go to church god will
[2:35:46] punish me so i go to church legalistic
[2:35:52] oh no no no if i don't repent i'm gonna
[2:35:55] go to hell legalistic
[2:35:57] because if they take hell off
[2:36:01] you go back again to sin
[2:36:03] because no matter what i do there is no
[2:36:05] more help
[2:36:06] how many people will leave the church if
[2:36:08] they call people today they say god
[2:36:10] heavyweights hell
[2:36:12] you have two people staying in churches
[2:36:14] everybody back again there's no more
[2:36:16] hair let's live in sin internally that's
[2:36:19] not it if you love me
[2:36:23] you do the water
[2:36:25] so when i do the commandment for god i'm
[2:36:28] doing that because he loved me first
[2:36:32] because when i remember that when i was
[2:36:35] singing
[2:36:37] yet christ already died for me
[2:36:41] when i was unlovable he already loved me
[2:36:45] before i was even born
[2:36:48] he put my mother and my father together
[2:36:51] just to save me because of that
[2:36:55] [Music]
[2:36:57] if he said take the high heel off i'm
[2:37:00] not taking the high heel off because of
[2:37:02] hell
[2:37:04] i am not taking the high heel off
[2:37:07] because i want to please my father
[2:37:09] i am not taking my high heel off because
[2:37:11] i want to go to heaven i am not taking
[2:37:14] my high heel off because i'm going to
[2:37:16] get punished i am not taking my high
[2:37:18] heel off to please brother stephen
[2:37:20] i am doing that because that's his
[2:37:23] commandment
[2:37:24] and because i love him
[2:37:26] i have to do his commandments
[2:37:32] lord help me
[2:37:34] he says
[2:37:35] he that has mine
[2:37:38] and keep his name
[2:37:40] he it is that do what
[2:37:42] and he that loves me shall be love of
[2:37:45] mine and i will love him and will
[2:37:48] manifest myself in water when you enter
[2:37:51] the legalistic stage of roof
[2:37:54] that's why boaz broke those stuff from
[2:37:56] roof
[2:37:57] so when roof is working she's working
[2:38:00] under love
[2:38:02] she's not working under commandment
[2:38:05] anymore
[2:38:07] amen
[2:38:08] amen
[2:38:10] hallelujah
[2:38:12] jesus answer and say unto him if a man
[2:38:16] he will keep my water
[2:38:19] so you keeping the word of god the
[2:38:22] message of the hour
[2:38:24] because you love god
[2:38:28] nothing to do with heaven
[2:38:30] nothing to do with health nothing to do
[2:38:32] with punishment nothing to do with
[2:38:34] prosperity
[2:38:41] you come to church god will prosper you
[2:38:43] okay that's why i'm coming to church
[2:38:45] that's why after a while if money
[2:38:47] doesn't come
[2:38:51] wrong
[2:38:52] wrong
[2:38:54] whether i'm poor
[2:38:55] whether i'm rich whether he works or not
[2:39:03] everybody care
[2:39:05] and my father we love him and we will
[2:39:08] come unto him and make our water
[2:39:12] in other words before i enter into you
[2:39:15] in the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:39:20] go to the legalistic stage
[2:39:23] you must be cleansed but when you are
[2:39:25] cleansed
[2:39:26] watch out
[2:39:28] you don't get cleansed to please anybody
[2:39:32] you don't get cleansed for heaven
[2:39:34] i'm just trying to see your love
[2:39:38] that's why boaz gave commandment new
[2:39:40] commandment to roof don't go anywhere
[2:39:44] stay here
[2:39:46] stay by the maidens all that bowlers
[2:39:48] want to see is obedience
[2:39:52] it has been five months
[2:39:54] have you seen roof in any field
[2:39:57] no have you seen roof watching anybody
[2:39:59] on youtube
[2:40:01] have you seen roof watching pentecostal
[2:40:04] preachers

[2:40:07] internet
[2:40:08] have you seen roof on pornography
[2:40:12] he stopped pornography he's not doing
[2:40:14] that anymore
[2:40:15] why is he not doing that
[2:40:18] because i love him
[2:40:23] everybody here
[2:40:24] anybody here when love catches
[2:40:28] everything is falling painless
[2:40:31] you don't push a demon
[2:40:37] give me a few minutes and i'm going to
[2:40:38] stop i'm going to reach somewhere
[2:40:40] i don't want to leave you in the air
[2:40:42] okay
[2:40:44] let me get something down
[2:40:46] what is the purpose why
[2:40:50] do we have to obey his word
[2:40:53] why do we have to do his will
[2:40:57] what is the benefit
[2:41:01] you want to know the benefit yes
[2:41:03] get this and i'll let you go
[2:41:05] we have to go in holiness in third part
[2:41:09] amen
[2:41:10] therefore whosoever
[2:41:13] heareth
[2:41:14] this saying of man if you hear the word
[2:41:18] and
[2:41:19] [Music]
[2:41:24] there is a hearing of the word which
[2:41:27] brings faith
[2:41:28] because faith cometh by hearing
[2:41:31] but you don't stop a hearing
[2:41:33] because paul said you justify here
[2:41:36] but james move he say you justify by do
[2:41:41] you remember that
[2:41:42] you remember when that here you you got
[2:41:45] paul
[2:41:46] here you got james
[2:41:48] everybody here
[2:41:50] i heard it fine i want to see you doing
[2:41:53] it
[2:41:54] but when you do it not because of heaven
[2:41:57] not because of hell not because of
[2:42:00] reward not because of punishment i'm
[2:42:02] doing that because of love
[2:42:05] everybody okay so far
[2:42:08] hallelujah
[2:42:10] but what is the benefits of healing and
[2:42:13] doing and i'm gonna stop here we will
[2:42:15] pick up on next sunday on sanctification
[2:42:18] again
[2:42:19] he says whatsoever here's this saying of
[2:42:23] man and
[2:42:26] i will liken him
[2:42:28] unto a wise man
[2:42:30] which does what
[2:42:34] build somebody's house
[2:42:40] your own house
[2:42:41] upon a water
[2:42:47] so what i'm asking you to do
[2:42:51] is he have a benefit on yourself
[2:42:58] roof
[2:42:59] work
[2:43:01] but don't work anywhere stay in the
[2:43:03] field
[2:43:04] the working she's doing
[2:43:06] i thought the reapers when you see wolf
[2:43:10] give her what the lord says she can pick
[2:43:12] up but this is a new commandment
[2:43:15] me boas
[2:43:17] i'm telling you every time roof
[2:43:19] approaches
[2:43:20] purposely take something and drop it
[2:43:23] intentionally
[2:43:25] for roof
[2:43:26] anybody here so if roof would have gone
[2:43:29] with one gallon
[2:43:32] she can go home with 10 gallon
[2:43:36] i don't have time but i can show you the
[2:43:38] measurement of roof is uh if it was a
[2:43:41] food that she can eat five days
[2:43:44] how can you work one day and have a food
[2:43:46] that you can eat five days here at naomi
[2:43:48] according to the ifa i can divide it by
[2:43:51] the by the way maybe we can get that
[2:43:53] later everybody
[2:43:54] everybody so what i'm giving you roof to
[2:43:58] do you gotta do the work but there is no
[2:44:00] more fear nobody will trouble you no
[2:44:03] young man will molest you you are free
[2:44:05] you can continue to do and at the end
[2:44:08] you're the one that is gaining food
[2:44:13] for your own house
[2:44:16] everybody here at the end you're the one
[2:44:19] that is benefiting so i'm not telling
[2:44:21] you to do this just like that i always
[2:44:24] have a plan behind what i'm asking you
[2:44:27] to do
[2:44:29] so if i tell you remove the pants and
[2:44:32] know what i'm saying there is a benefit
[2:44:35] behind it if i tell you if i tell you
[2:44:38] come to church i know the reason why i'm
[2:44:40] telling you to come to church there is
[2:44:42] always a purpose behind every word i'm
[2:44:45] telling you because man shall not live
[2:44:48] by bread alone but by every
[2:44:53] what is the benefits
[2:44:55] the benefits is what
[2:44:57] you are building your own house upon
[2:45:00] what
[2:45:01] so when you are doing the commandment of
[2:45:04] god in your life
[2:45:06] number one
[2:45:08] you are building your house
[2:45:12] not in any kind of way by you putting
[2:45:15] your house in a rock
[2:45:18] and the rock is water
[2:45:23] as simple as it seems
[2:45:26] but you're shaking the devil
[2:45:29] remember you still have habits that are
[2:45:31] hanging on you but now we gotta get the
[2:45:33] habit off
[2:45:34] but you don't get them with moses
[2:45:37] because moses we say do not commit
[2:45:39] adultery they come as soon as they leave
[2:45:41] they go commit again adoption
[2:45:44] because under the law everybody here
[2:45:47] and the rain descended
[2:45:50] so god knows that you're going to go
[2:45:51] through a trial
[2:45:54] a rain is coming
[2:45:56] the rain descended and the flood
[2:45:59] and the wind
[2:46:01] blew and beat upon the house and it did
[2:46:04] work
[2:46:05] for it was funded
[2:46:09] on the water
[2:46:11] so one
[2:46:12] just listening to the word
[2:46:14] to the message and doing what brother
[2:46:17] branham tells you to do
[2:46:19] by love of god
[2:46:21] you are building your house
[2:46:26] and you are putting the house on a solid
[2:46:29] foundation
[2:46:36] because one of these days somebody will
[2:46:38] leave the message
[2:46:41] and he will shake you
[2:46:43] he will shake your foundation
[2:46:46] you don't know now
[2:46:50] hallelujah he said and everyone that
[2:46:54] heareth the saying of man and do them
[2:46:56] not i'm going i'm heading to the airport
[2:46:58] i'm just zeroing i'm working on my gps

[2:55:29] pass
[2:55:30] everybody okay
[2:55:32] three weeks after the test
[2:55:34] go back to school and ask the same
[2:55:36] person
[2:55:38] what was that what you say do you know
[2:55:40] what happened
[2:55:41] what happened
[2:55:43] what happened to the material
[2:55:46] why do we forget them
[2:55:48] because of lack of what
[2:55:51] everybody okay so far
[2:55:52] but one day we change our study
[2:55:57] in school
[2:55:58] now whatever we heard
[2:56:01] we're going to clinic and we do water
[2:56:06] are you with me
[2:56:08] are you with me
[2:56:09] tooth
[2:56:10] tooth
[2:56:13] when you want to pull a tooth you grab
[2:56:15] like this
[2:56:16] but here
[2:56:18] when you want to pull a tooth you do
[2:56:19] this
[2:56:20] when you want to pull a tooth you do
[2:56:21] this i do that the first time
[2:56:24] i do that the second time i do that the
[2:56:26] third time do i need to listen to the
[2:56:28] teacher anymore
[2:56:30] by putting the word in practice you are
[2:56:33] removing the word from the teacher and
[2:56:36] the word is now made flesh
[2:56:39] [Applause]
[2:56:41] [Music]
[2:56:43] everybody okay so when you are
[2:56:45] practicing the commandment of god you
[2:56:48] are actually incorporating
[2:56:50] the commandment of god in your life
[2:56:54] until your life
[2:56:56] become the commandment of god
[2:57:00] the musicians want to sing their
[2:57:02] practice
[2:57:03] they practice so much until when they
[2:57:06] sing they don't remember the practice
[2:57:09] anymore it looks like she was the one
[2:57:11] that wrote the song
[2:57:13] she was not the one that wrote the song
[2:57:15] she practiced the song so much until
[2:57:18] that person and the song became and when
[2:57:22] they sing they don't need to hold the
[2:57:24] paper anymore it's coming automatically
[2:57:28] and before you know it they begin to
[2:57:30] even add certain things that the one who
[2:57:32] wrote the song didn't put it
[2:57:37] everybody here you will hear somebody
[2:57:39] begin to play oh
[2:57:40] but if you look at the original singer
[2:57:42] didn't do it because the song is so much
[2:57:45] flesh in them and he activated even the
[2:57:48] gift in their life now the doing and the
[2:57:51] healing are blended together by the
[2:57:55] practice and brother branham said when
[2:57:57] you do that
[2:57:59] whatever was in that word
[2:58:02] cling to you and begin to take
[2:58:05] what is troubling you of your life
[2:58:10] practicing what you listening
[2:58:12] it is actually a way to take the word of
[2:58:16] god and to put it in your life
[2:58:19] unconsciously
[2:58:24] and before you know it
[2:58:25] you can practice dentistry without a
[2:58:27] book
[2:58:28] i don't know the last time i opened the
[2:58:30] book i was in school all the books are
[2:58:32] in me
[2:58:35] every con every disease you're bringing
[2:58:37] me i'm working because the book are no
[2:58:39] longer i don't need a teacher i don't
[2:58:41] need to hold my book like patient wait
[2:58:44] for me and you go up in chapter 25 it's
[2:58:46] not there chapter 25 is in me chapter 22
[2:58:49] is in me chapter five is that all the
[2:58:52] chapters are there because of practice
[2:58:55] if you hear my word and you put them
[2:58:58] together in practice by love
[2:59:01] brother branham say what happened to you
[2:59:03] he shall grow around you like a vam and
[2:59:07] do what
[2:59:12] and when he hug you that habit
[2:59:15] take off
[2:59:17] and another word will come
[2:59:19] to the second habit in your life
[2:59:22] we will get to that next sunday let's
[2:59:24] stand
[2:59:36] christ
[2:59:38] came to end your lord
[2:59:42] not to put you lawless
[2:59:44] you still have a law
[2:59:46] but you have the law of love
[2:59:48] you're not not operating with fear
[2:59:51] you are operating under the law of love
[2:59:54] you're doing the commandment of god
[2:59:56] you're following the message of the hour
[2:59:58] not because of heaven
[3:00:00] not because of hell
[3:00:02] not because of reward not because of
[3:00:05] punishment you're doing that because of
[3:00:07] love
[3:00:08] because love is beyond everything the
[3:00:10] love of god is beyond everything once
[3:00:13] you understand that all the commandments
[3:00:15] all the law and the prophet hang into
[3:00:18] one commandment you shall love the lord
[3:00:21] when you do that you're fulfilling the
[3:00:23] law automatically and by fulfilling the
[3:00:26] law by love god is under obligation
[3:00:30] to remove whatever is troubling you
[3:00:33] without your effort
[3:00:36] and before you know it you will turn
[3:00:38] around and you begin to notice certain
[3:00:40] habits where already left you and you
[3:00:43] don't even know how they were gone you
[3:00:45] say wait a minute i used to be this way
[3:00:47] it's gone because the love of god that
[3:00:50] you're doing if god say read your bible
[3:00:52] you're reading your bible you think
[3:00:53] you're just reading your bible by
[3:00:55] reading the bible in obedience to the
[3:00:57] word of god that reading of the bible is
[3:01:00] taking off demons
[3:01:06] god said go to prayer before you know it
[3:01:09] you can't help it you become let's go to
[3:01:11] church you're ready to go but
[3:01:14] last year you had a hard time going to
[3:01:16] church
[3:01:17] who took that
[3:01:18] hard time going to church away
[3:01:21] the commandment that you just
[3:01:23] went with is taking demon away
[3:01:27] ever here
[3:01:28] everybody here a child did something
[3:01:30] wrong
[3:01:31] ready to be
[3:01:32] whooped and he's waiting trembling that
[3:01:35] daddy's gonna whoop him and daddy turn
[3:01:37] around and say don't do it again
[3:01:40] mother factor bought something for you
[3:01:41] from mcdonough
[3:01:45] what a virus
[3:01:47] have you injected into that child
[3:01:50] now he's confused how can i be rewarded
[3:01:53] if i did something wrong
[3:01:55] then trouble him so much until next time
[3:01:58] i'm not gonna do it
[3:02:00] game over
[3:02:03] because you're bringing a different
[3:02:04] input into his system he's expecting you
[3:02:07] to come by the law and give the whooping
[3:02:10] if you do that that's correct i deserve
[3:02:12] it i got a whooping because i did this
[3:02:14] next time i'm gonna wait when dad is not
[3:02:16] around that one i'm gonna do it the
[3:02:18] snake is still there
[3:02:22] amen
[3:02:23] because you are approaching it wrong
[3:02:25] let's pray heavenly father
[3:02:28] lord we thank you again father for your
[3:02:29] grace
[3:02:30] for your love and for your mercy and for
[3:02:32] everything you have been doing for us
[3:02:35] father
[3:02:38] i pray
[3:02:39] that's the spirit of revelation
[3:02:42] drop and take a hold of your children
[3:02:45] so that they can be free completely
[3:02:49] from the trap of armenianism
[3:02:52] from any legalistic
[3:02:54] standpoint
[3:02:55] because he brought confusion and he
[3:02:58] brought your children
[3:02:59] into bondage lord
[3:03:02] father you came
[3:03:03] to express to us exactly the very mind
[3:03:07] until your prophets say that under the
[3:03:09] seventh soul the back part mind of god
[3:03:12] was completely lord father unveiled to
[3:03:15] your children
[3:03:16] and now we understand the threefold
[3:03:19] purpose of you
[3:03:20] that you came to have preeminence in
[3:03:22] yourself
[3:03:24] and now all you want is preeminence in
[3:03:26] your brother and preeminence on your
[3:03:28] bread until your bread can give you the
[3:03:31] first place
[3:03:32] and can love you with all the heart with
[3:03:34] further mind with all the strength with
[3:03:36] all that is in them
[3:03:38] until your commandment is no longer
[3:03:41] burdened by the commandment further it
[3:03:44] becomes a commandment of love
[3:03:46] because those commandments will benefit
[3:03:48] us
[3:03:49] will help us build
[3:03:51] our christian faith into solid
[3:03:53] foundation
[3:03:55] and father it's connected to the
[3:03:56] blessings
[3:03:58] lord as we continue to labor in this
[3:04:00] subject
[3:04:02] father i pray that whatever the devil
[3:04:04] was troubling your children
[3:04:06] in the legalistic point
[3:04:08] until they felt like they were tight in
[3:04:11] the message and they have to do certain
[3:04:13] things just because they were in the
[3:04:15] message and that's the reason why we see
[3:04:17] people leaving the message and before
[3:04:19] you know it they're cutting their hair
[3:04:21] the dressing immorally because they
[3:04:23] missed the message they thought the
[3:04:25] message was a bunch of laws they did not
[3:04:27] understand that the message was not a
[3:04:29] bachelor the message was just trying to
[3:04:32] make them dress like a lady just
[3:04:34] respectfully dress appropriately dress
[3:04:38] and reflect the beauty of holiness and
[3:04:40] further if that message was sucked in
[3:04:43] whether they were out on in they would
[3:04:46] continue to keep that lord but further
[3:04:48] because of the devil and because of
[3:04:50] intellectual speaking and because of
[3:04:53] reasoning lord father the devil has been
[3:04:55] troubling so many homes until the people
[3:04:59] don't know what to do and they just do
[3:05:01] it by religion just because they have to
[3:05:04] do it if they don't do it they're afraid
[3:05:06] they're going to get in trouble or they
[3:05:08] will be stricken or they're going to
[3:05:10] lose their job or you're going to be the
[3:05:12] god that is going to make their car
[3:05:13] break down because they didn't pay their
[3:05:15] tithing and now the paying of tithing is
[3:05:18] under fear
[3:05:20] instead of understanding that i'm not
[3:05:22] paying tarding because i'm afraid my car
[3:05:25] will break down or they're gonna chase
[3:05:28] me at work but i'm paying that in
[3:05:31] obedience to the god that gave me a job
[3:05:35] that gave me a business that gave me
[3:05:38] good health that protected me that woke
[3:05:41] me up in the morning that gave me a
[3:05:43] sound man in the midst of the time that
[3:05:45] people don't have jobs he's the god that
[3:05:48] gave me job and in appreciation to what
[3:05:51] he did this is why i'm giving his
[3:05:54] offering this is why i'm bringing the
[3:05:56] offering at that point the offering
[3:05:58] won't be a burden it's going to be a
[3:06:00] different kind of offering lord we're
[3:06:03] not going to look at two dollars just
[3:06:05] because we want to make sure we give
[3:06:07] something but now we cannot give you
[3:06:10] anything we will be led by the spirit to
[3:06:13] do certain things lord father may you
[3:06:15] help the church and your children get
[3:06:18] this revelation and be free completely
[3:06:21] from this step of legalistic but lord
[3:06:23] father to understand that everything
[3:06:26] that you're doing is lord wrapped up in
[3:06:28] one word which is the love of god for
[3:06:31] you so loved the world that you gave
[3:06:33] your only begotten son so that we can
[3:06:36] believe and have eternal life father we
