[0:01] You know, I don't I only speak of the
[0:03] truth. When I was born in a little
[0:05] Kentucky cabin up there, the angel of
[0:07] the Lord come in the window and stood
[0:08] there as a pillar of fire. I said, "God
[0:12] has prove that. If I tell the truth, God
[0:15] will vindicate the truth. If I'm a liar,
[0:17] God will have nothing to do with me."
[0:19] And about that time, she went,
[0:21] "Here he comes."
[0:23] &gt;&gt; The American Photographers Association
[0:25] all in there look like Times collaring
[0:27] on them. The American photographer told
[0:29] they shot the picture of it said I
[0:30] believe it's psychology. We've seen it
[0:32] before but I believe and they took it
[0:34] home and there the lights struck the
[0:35] lens. They took it to George J. Lacy.
[0:37] They put it under everything they could
[0:39] and now it hangs in Washington DC in the
[0:41] hall of heaven. Hallelujah.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:44] &gt;&gt; Why is it Jesus Christ with that bunch
[0:46] that they call holy rollers?
[0:49] &gt;&gt; God bless your heart.
[0:52] &gt;&gt; Ever famous ever.
[0:58] The man who painted the last supper
[0:59] there, it went through the hall of
[1:01] critics. What they criticized, it cost
[1:03] him his lifetime.
[1:06] But now it leaves in the hall of fame.
[1:09] It has to go through the hall of
[1:10] critics. Brother and sister, when we
[1:13] started in this what they call this Holy
[1:15] Ghost religion way back years ago, we
[1:18] had to get little old stables,
[1:21] somebody's house, a little storefront
[1:23] somewhere, and they stood on the
[1:24] outside. The sinners chew chewing gum
[1:26] last and made fun. Call us holy roars
[1:28] and slept in jail and everything else.
[1:30] That's right. They've been beat. They've
[1:33] been made fun of a little old preacher
[1:35] in my house that they turning out of
[1:37] sitting him and his wife to feed these
[1:38] babies. They sleep out in old blankets,
[1:40] wet blankets, and hang them up in the
[1:42] trees. Let them dry out of the morning
[1:43] and they go down the railroad track
[1:45] picking up a grain of corn at a time,
[1:47] had a little skillet. They beat it up
[1:48] with a rock and they live for 12 or 14
[1:51] days at a time on beef corn. My old
[1:54] manager, God bless his heart, old
[1:55] brother Bosworth, laying down in Derban,
[1:58] Africa tonight, praying for me to come
[2:00] there, laid down in Texas with his back
[2:02] beat into stripes when he threatened to
[2:05] cut his throat and everything else when
[2:07] he walked with a broken wrist trying to
[2:09] pack his suitcase beat for preaching the
[2:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Wandered
[2:15] about in sheep skins and goat skins and
[2:17] destituted in desert places of whom the
[2:19] world is not worthy to receive. The big
[2:22] churches made fun, pointed their
[2:24] fingers. They said we were holy rollers
[2:26] when I built the laid the cornerstone
[2:28] there. They said they'll turn that
[2:30] little old thing into a garage. It's
[2:32] been 20 years ago and the Holy Ghost
[2:34] still lives here. Hallelujah.
[2:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:38] &gt;&gt; And what they said was fanaticism and
[2:40] everything. Kings and monarchs across
[2:42] the world has called. Great man has been
[2:45] healed. The powers of God has swept the
[2:48] world around. done. Now we stand
[2:50] millions strong.
[2:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:55] &gt;&gt; One of these mornings she's went through
[2:56] the critics. They said it would burn
[2:58] out. They said to me down here said,
[3:00] "Oh, Billy, you lost your mind." That's
[3:02] all there is to it. Even my own
[3:04] mother-in-law said, "Wow, the boy's gone
[3:06] crazy." But if I am, I'm having a
[3:09] wonderful time. Let me tell you
[3:11] something, brother. Listen to this. I
[3:13] say this with respect.
[3:15] Hallelujah.
[3:17] All hell can't stop [screaming] it. It's
[3:20] ordained of Jesus Christ to be. So it
[3:22] will be upon this rock I'll build my
[3:27] church and the gates of hell shall not
[3:28] prevail against it.
[3:30] &gt;&gt; How? What is it? What kind of a church?
[3:33] Fresh and blood has not revealed it to
[3:35] thee, Peter. But my father which is in
[3:37] heaven is revealed to you. Spiritual
[3:40] revelation by the Holy Ghost of the word
[3:43] of God.

[31:23] Y'all can uh be seated just for a
[31:25] minute.

[31:42] Logos turned 16 on us. Amen. [applause]
[31:47] Amen.
[31:51] Amen. Very proud. Very proud of this
[31:55] young man. He does so much here and
[31:59] his heart his heart is always desiring
[32:01] more of God. Amen. Amen.
[32:05] Y'all give me one second here. That that
[32:07] song is always a little emotional.
[32:11] She's
[32:14] [music]
[32:22] got a lot to be thankful for. Don't
[32:30] tears of joy, not not sorrow.
[32:37] So Chris and Rebecca went to Georgia to
[32:39] see his family this weekend. They'll be
[32:41] coming back today. So we were asking
[32:44] travel mercy for them.
[32:47] Got one from sister um Katrina Allen
[32:49] here too. Please keep sister Ununice
[32:52] Lopy's cousin William Museay in prayer.
[32:57] Uh he's not doing well. It doesn't it
[32:59] doesn't elaborate. So um
[33:02] it means a lot to her. So, let's
[33:04] remember um her cousin. I think she's
[33:07] traveling to DC to be with him in a
[33:09] little bit this morning uh or today. So,
[33:11] she's asking for traveling mercy also on
[33:13] her trip home. Uh she went up to see
[33:16] them and uh
[33:20] just asked to keep my wife in prayer. I
[33:21] speak to her occasionally and you know
[33:23] through texts and calls on WhatsApp and
[33:27] um it seems like it's it's um turning
[33:30] more spiritual now
[33:33] than um just the physical the physical
[33:36] is still there and the strain and uh you
[33:39] know but um
[33:42] trying to if anybody can help me we're
[33:44] trying to find uh the messages on
[33:47] YouTube translated into Spanish. I don't
[33:49] know if she can um
[33:51] maybe get on the table. I don't know. I
[33:54] know it comes in different languages
[33:55] written in written form, but I don't
[33:57] know if it will read them out in
[33:58] Spanish. If it does, I'll suggest that.
[34:00] But, um, I found one, but it wasn't an
[34:04] interpretation like brother Brandham
[34:06] spoke and then the man interpreted it.
[34:08] So, I don't know how accurate it was
[34:10] because it was just him, you know,
[34:12] speaking Spanish. So, I don't know that
[34:14] um
[34:17] it was the rapture, the one that I sent
[34:19] her. So,
[34:21] That's wonderful. Let's stand this
[34:24] morning. Amen.
[34:28] Got one more here. Good.
[34:32] Oh, is this big brother?

[35:30] and bless her her cousin, oh God. And
[35:32] whatever's going on, God, we sure you
[35:34] already knew about it, oh God, from the
[35:36] foundation of the world, oh God. But as

[35:49] Father. Oh God, all the hand that waved
[35:51] in the air, oh father, that whatever on
[35:53] their hearts and whatever they need this
[35:54] morning. Oh God, remember sister Edy, oh
[35:57] God, where she at. Oh God, touch that
[35:58] situation. Oh father, we know you have
[36:00] it all in your hands, oh father. Oh Lord
[36:03] God, and we commit this service in your
[36:04] hand, oh father, bless the tithes and
[36:06] offering, oh God, of those that are
[36:08] giving, oh father, and the ones who
[36:09] wants to give this morning that have
[36:11] not, oh God. Oh Lord God, we turn this
[36:13] service back into your hands through
[36:15] every other song that's left. Oh father,
[36:16] we pray that your holy spirit would come
[36:18] down and minister to our souls. Oh
[36:20] father, we commit this service in your
[36:22] hands. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.

[49:25] Glory to God. Amen.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; I believe we are all up to date with the

[49:33] day. Our cood book, church ages, 70
[49:36] weeks of Daniel, the seals adoption or

[49:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Glenn, you let us know for next
[49:46] year when is the question and answer.
[49:48] Sister ROF, check that noise on the
[49:51] monitor. Our question and answer for
[49:53] next year on the first quarterly uh uh
[49:57] question and answer for next year, he
[49:59] will let us know. The young man
[50:01] apologized, but this is not something
[50:04] that we we did. This is this was a major
[50:07] event that happened for uh brother
[50:10] Charles Anderson. That's an elder right
[50:12] there. So there is no way you can go
[50:15] around it. We have to cancel everything.
[50:17] But to the best of my understanding,
[50:19] brother Tony got you all schedule.
[50:21] Everything is working for November 8th.
[50:24] And I was told that you needed another
[50:26] one so to avoid the lap. So you got
[50:29] November 8th, which is a Saturday, and
[50:31] December 6th, which is a Saturday. So
[50:34] you got backto back so we don't give you
[50:36] uh a big gap between the two. Amen.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; The Lord help us. We we were able to
[50:42] sleep in with some of the folks to give
[50:43] support to brother Charles Anderson.
[50:46] It's not easy to lose a pastor's wife.
[50:49] It's something that is hurting not only
[50:51] the family, but it hurts the church,
[50:53] especially if uh she was a good one like
[50:57] sister. She was very very good. When you
[50:59] hear the testimonies and everything,
[51:01] it's a big loss for the church. Amen.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; So, we had to be there. I went there. We
[51:07] do you you talking about the funeral
[51:09] service. [laughter]
[51:13] &gt;&gt; I was sitting I wonder it looks like the
[51:16] Lord went to confirm to us everything we
[51:18] were preaching here.
[51:20] [screaming and laughter]
[51:21] Even the court
[51:24] &gt;&gt; 100%
[51:25] &gt;&gt; even the quotes that were coming up
[51:27] &gt;&gt; even the scripture Ecclesiastes 3:1
[51:30] there is a season and there is a purpose
[51:32] and I will see you should hear your
[51:34] pastor hollering amen
[51:37] [laughter]
[51:41] &gt;&gt; what an encouragement and a confirmation
[51:44] I look at I I went after service to
[51:47] brother Jackson I say thank you very
[51:49] much I had to uh chat a little bit with
[51:51] brother Charles. So keep him in prayer
[51:54] and usually when a lot of people are
[51:56] there you strong and when the crowd
[51:58] begin to dwindle and you stay alone I
[52:01] mean alone then the memories begin to
[52:02] come back. So just keep him in prayer. I
[52:05] was not able to go to the repass. I just
[52:07] went all the way to the cemetery and
[52:09] have to leave the cemetery and hit the
[52:11] highway and to come back because I have
[52:13] to be prepared for today. But God was
[52:16] gracious that we were able to do it.
[52:18] Amen. Amen.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; And the married couple meeting will be
[52:22] part eight. It's in December the 13th.
[52:25] We go on finances the second part. And
[52:29] also remember our Tuesday's prayer. If
[52:32] you never been there, hop on the line.
[52:34] It is so good. Again, it's at 7:00.
[52:38] Remember to send to brother John or
[52:40] brother set all the requests before 5.
[52:42] So we get ready and we see you again at
[52:44] 7:00. And not only 7:00, we already
[52:47] inserted a a five minute time to pray
[52:50] here in the church before services. So
[52:53] those who come late, you are missing all
[52:55] that opportunity. So learn to be in
[52:57] church on time. So you can also get that
[53:00] opportunity to pray before the service.
[53:03] And if you didn't pray at home, there is
[53:04] a I'm in a space here that have been
[53:07] given to you. But Tuesday again at 7:00,
[53:10] it's uh it's our prayer service. And I
[53:13] begin to know some of the invisible
[53:15] audience.
[53:16] I never seen their faces and we see
[53:18] them. It's a lot of people online on
[53:20] Tuesday. Visible and invisible audience.
[53:23] It's a tremendous blessing. Sister
[53:25] Rosemary sent me a message saying that
[53:28] she's uh she's having now the luxury of
[53:31] yawning.
[53:32] [laughter]
[53:33] &gt;&gt; You heard her saying amen. Amen. When I
[53:36] heard the testimony, I told my wife, I
[53:38] say I was not even aware she was going
[53:40] through TMJ and everything. Oh my God, I

[55:56] Persian and then and Daniel was both in
[55:59] Babylon and with King Cyus. He says,
[56:02] "Now in Shushan the palace, there was a
[56:05] certain Jew whose name was who?"

[57:02] &gt;&gt; Adassa.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; She's Adassa right there. That is
[57:05] Esther, his uncle's daughter. For she
[57:08] had neither father nor mother.
[57:10] Mechisedc. And the maid was fair and
[57:13] beautiful, whom Morci, when her father
[57:16] and mother were dead, took for his own
[57:18] what?
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Daughter.

[57:24] &gt;&gt; Babylonian environment, Daniel overcame.
[57:28] Shadrach overcame, Abednego overcame,
[57:31] Mach overcame, Ezra overcame, Ezekiel
[57:35] overcame, Morci overcame, uh Esther

[58:04] La Oishia to reflect the overcoming
[58:07] power of God that you can go and climb
[58:10] over the things of the world and still
[58:13] remain focused toward Calvary.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[58:32] Spirit keep pushing everything back and
[58:35] opening things. I say, "Okay, let me
[58:37] squeeze this so we get to it." The Holy
[58:38] Spirit open it. So I can't I can't fight
[58:41] with the Holy Spirit. I have to back up.
[58:44] So whatever was supposed to be here
[58:47] went next Sunday. So if you do good, you

[1:09:21] the Lord God has not caused it to rain.
[1:09:24] Remember Adam is already created with
[1:09:26] Eve. Has not caused it to rain upon the
[1:09:29] earth. And there was no man to do what?
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; The ground.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; So there was no man to do work.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; So Eden was not separated from work.
[1:09:45] That's right.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; When everything was perfect
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; in perfection,
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; work was there.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; So work is not a result of a a fall.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:11] Because you have a tendency when we go
[1:10:13] to heaven, we will go to heaven and then
[1:10:15] no more work. Uh-uh.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Who told you that?
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; I'm asking you. Who told you that?
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Even in the millennium, we will build.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; So work is not a result of a fall.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Work existed before sin was introduced.
[1:10:38] I hope we are together.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Today it's changing.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; It's changing, right?
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Especially men should love work.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; If a man doesn't want to work,
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; something is wrong.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; If a boy doesn't want to work at home,
[1:11:02] [cheering]
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; give me a call.
[1:11:07] Can you say amen?
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; If you see a man vacation, vacation,
[1:11:13] vacation. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.
[1:11:15] No. No. No. No. No. Go to work.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Go to work.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Man was created in the image and
[1:11:24] likeness of God.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Work is divine.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Adam was already created in Genesis 1.
[1:11:32] And the reason why they created Adam in
[1:11:35] Genesis 2 is to make sure he can work.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together? You can refocus. We
[1:11:44] need to work.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Do you see sin here?
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Do you see the devil here?
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; The difference is after sin
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; the work became laborious.
[1:12:01] It become a travail.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; That's why they say a woman in travail.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Meaning there is some pain associated to
[1:12:09] the labor.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; But before and after work was there.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:20] [laughter]
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching the seven.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; We there.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; We there.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because in this message, we preach
[1:12:28] everything beside what we are living in.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; You will go to the rapture. You will go
[1:12:35] to the rapture. You will go to the And
[1:12:37] you don't even know how to work.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; We will go to the rapture, but we still
[1:12:44] living in this world.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; We need to know how to live in this
[1:12:47] world as Christian.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; If there should be a good employee,
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; it's a message believer. Amen.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; But if I go to your work and you always
[1:13:02] come there late, [cheering]
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; you not you're not reflecting the
[1:13:06] message.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; The message want you to be a good
[1:13:09] worker.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; A Christian is the one that's supposed
[1:13:12] to work.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; You need to respect your job.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Respect your supervisor.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Appreciate your job.
[1:13:26] If there should be a best employee that
[1:13:28] they can give confidence at work, it
[1:13:30] should be a message believer.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Unfortunately, we got crooks even in the
[1:13:38] preachers.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; I know what I'm talking about.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; But God will always have a weakness.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; We clear?
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Ah, glory to God. We on verse five. Go
[1:13:56] to verse six and then go and what does
[1:13:59] the Lord the Bible say? But they went up
[1:14:01] a water
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; a mist from the earth
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; and did water
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; watered the whole face of the ground.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; And the Lord God formed men not created
[1:14:09] for men out of the dust of the ground
[1:14:12] and did what?
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Breathed into his nostrils the breath of
[1:14:14] life
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; and man became a what?
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; A living soul.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Job to verse 15. And the Lord God took
[1:14:22] man and did what?
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Put him into the garden of Eden
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; to do what?
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; To dress it.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; So they put man in the garden of Eden
[1:14:29] just to enjoy it.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; I I hope we are together.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; The garden belonged to man
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; for man to go eat and enjoy it.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; But there was more than just enjoying
[1:14:43] it.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Man had to work.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; He says to dress it and to do what?
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Keep it.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; So God gave man a divine responsibility.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; I had a quote. I didn't want to put it
[1:15:08] where brother said the doctor tell Billy
[1:15:11] Graham
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; to run
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; because he was not doing more work. Yes,
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; I have a quote.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; They say something wrong, something
[1:15:22] wrong was going on with Billy Graham.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; And they took him to the doctor. The
[1:15:26] doctor looked, they say there's nothing
[1:15:27] wrong. They say you don't do much work.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; This is brother Brandham who say that.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; So if you want to keep something right
[1:15:37] here, work is what?
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Divine.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; It's a divine responsibility.
[1:15:43] God want you to work and God want you to
[1:15:45] take a break.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; And if there is anybody that should be
[1:15:49] working, it's a Christian.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; So a Christian should not be lazy.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:16:02] watching TV 5 hours. Something is wrong.

[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Let them go cut the grass.

[1:16:51] hours?

[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Because of laziness.
[1:17:10] Yes. Amen.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; The silence of the seven seal. Praise
[1:17:19] God. Let's go to Proverbs 6.

[1:18:00] know how to cook, don't know how to do
[1:18:01] everything, door dashes after door
[1:18:04] dashes.
[1:18:09] In other words, somebody took advantage
[1:18:11] of the laziness of people
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; to make money.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; You don't want to cook, stay right
[1:18:22] there. We bring it to you.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Don't even drive your car. We bring it
[1:18:25] to you

[1:18:35] A Christian should work.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; If you do good, we move on. If you
[1:18:50] continue like this, it bring another
[1:18:52] weapon. It's it's it's moving slowly. uh
[1:18:55] before he start shooting everywhere.

[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Proverb chapter 6.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; It's amazing.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Amazing.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Your your your
[1:19:12] well-being is never far away from you.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; It's right there. We are the one messing
[1:19:18] up our own life
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; with the habits and everything that we
[1:19:23] got and the society. work on you. Before
[1:19:26] you know it, you're a slave.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Uh Proverbs 6, if you dare, you can say
[1:19:33] amen.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Verse six. Go to who?
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; The ant.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; You who?
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Slugger.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; You know what it means?
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; It means what?
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; You lazy. A man. And consider its ways
[1:19:47] and be what?
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Wise.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; You already understand this. We went
[1:19:50] through this.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Which have what? No guide.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; You know what he means? Or what?
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Overseer.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Or what?
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Ruler.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Nobody to supervise them. Amen.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Verse eight. Provide her meat when
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; in the summer.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; And gather her food when
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; in the harvest.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; So when it's harvest, [clears throat]
[1:20:09] when it's a harvest or when it's summer,
[1:20:12] the ant does two things.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Number one, it's enjoying the season.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; But it's also preparing another season.
[1:20:24] through work.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Proverb 30.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Today you're moving very good. Praise
[1:20:34] God. Proverb 30.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; If you there, you can say amen.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Proverb 30:24.
[1:20:46] Why are you talking about the ant again?
[1:20:49] Brother Brandham says this
[1:20:51] in the message. a man running from the
[1:20:54] presence of the Lord after the seal. He
[1:20:56] says sometime we find ourself what
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; prone
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; to do what? run from work.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; I'm reading, brother. Brand
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; I don't want to work.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Oh god.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; My friend, this is the message of the
[1:21:11] hour.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Say amen.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Ah. Sometime we find oursel prone to do
[1:21:16] what?
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; From work.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; We don't want to. We don't want to work.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Some people just think they can make
[1:21:24] their living without what?
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Working. But I think Solomon was that
[1:21:29] said we could find here the answer. The
[1:21:32] answer in watching who
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; in ant.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; So the answer about working is where
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; in the ant.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say you know a little
[1:21:40] ant they tell me if that every ant does
[1:21:44] not work and laying that ant does not
[1:21:47] eat water
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; that winter.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; So everybody has to do what?
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Work.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Let me start again. Amen.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Did he say some people?
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Who should be working?
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Everybody.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Everybody should work.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; And according to the ant, if you don't
[1:22:04] work, you don't eat.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; In other words, don't feed the lazy.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; If we will help you the first time, the
[1:22:17] second time, the third time, you need to
[1:22:19] go back to work.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Unless you are disabled, we
[1:22:26] understand we will help you. But if you
[1:22:28] have two feet and everything is working,
[1:22:30] go to work.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Proverb 30 verse 24. That's why I'm
[1:22:42] reading the ant because of this quote.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Verse 24, he says, "There be four things
[1:22:48] which are what?
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Little upon the earth." If you look at
[1:22:51] the ant is not strong,
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; it's very little.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; So the ant got more excuse than you.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; The ant got more excuse than you.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; The ant can say look how skinny I am.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Look how little I am.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; But the Bible say the ant. Amen.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; There be four things which are little

[1:23:29] 25 the ant are a are
[1:23:33] a people what
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; not strong.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; So strength is not an excuse
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; not to work.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; You cannot say I don't I I I cannot work
[1:23:46] because I'm not strong. weak.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; That should not be an excuse.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Or I'm always weak. That should not be
[1:23:52] be an excuse because the ant are not
[1:23:55] strong.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; But the ant are working
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; and the answer to work is at the end.

[1:24:12] is sending us to the end
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; and the end is sending you back to
[1:24:17] Genesis
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; where work is divine.

[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; and we bring you a deer,
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; it's a blessing.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; If we put a deer and give it to you and

[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; you will die
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; with starvation

[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering]
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why we spend more
[1:26:49] money in the restaurant
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; because somebody's doing the work for
[1:26:53] you.

[1:26:57] the work you are supposed to do.

[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; not strong.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; So strength should not be an excuse.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't know how to carry this
[1:27:51] stuff. I don't know how to carry this
[1:27:53] stuff. Really? Really? You're trying to

[1:28:33] hindrance
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; for preparation.

[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; So the so the ant learn

[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; When you see danger, you run away.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together? But when you sleeping,
[1:35:43] you don't see danger. Amen.

[1:35:52] You say when did you come in my bed?
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; But how did you move from the fire when
[1:35:56] you were unconscious?
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; There was another you that is awaken and
[1:36:00] that is supervising everything
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; and that you never even sleep
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; because he's the one responsible for
[1:36:07] your respiration.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; You don't operate the way you are
[1:36:11] breathing. You don't operate the way the
[1:36:13] food are digested in your body. There is
[1:36:16] another you who's controlling all those
[1:36:18] things. He works in your unconscious
[1:36:21] part and your brain work in your
[1:36:23] conscious part.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; So God now is talking to the unconscious
[1:36:27] part of Solomon.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Not the conscious part of Solomon. I
[1:36:32] hope we are together.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Not the intelligence but the soul
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; as a man thinking with in in what?
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; His heart. So you can think with your
[1:36:41] brain or with your heart.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; So God is talking to Solomon when the
[1:36:46] first conscience is sleeping
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; but the second or the subconscious is
[1:36:51] up.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Because Solomon answer God
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; when Solomon was sleeping.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together? If I lost you raise
[1:36:59] your hand.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the scripture my friend.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Verse five. In Gibon the Lord appeared
[1:37:06] to who?
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Solomon.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; When? in a dream by night.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; And God say what?
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Ask what I shall give thee.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; God appeared to Solomon. Follow me very
[1:37:16] carefully.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; And God told Solomon after the offering.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Don't say amen. After the offering.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Uh for those who don't want God say ask
[1:37:31] everything you want.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Ask what you want and I will give it to
[1:37:36] you.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Are you following me? Amen.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; This is Solomon's soul reacting.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Verse six. And Solomon say you uh drop
[1:37:46] to verse seven so we save time. And now,
[1:37:50] oh Lord God, Lord my God, you have made
[1:37:53] who?
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Thy servant
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; David what?
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; King
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; instead of thy father. Amen. And I am
[1:37:59] but a little child.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; I know not how to go out or how to what
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; or come in.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; In other words, I'm very immature. I
[1:38:07] don't know how to handle stuff.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Verse uh uh uh 8. And your servant is in
[1:38:13] the midst of your people which you have
[1:38:16] chosen a a people that is how
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; great
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; that cannot be what
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; number
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; no counted for water
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; multitude.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; So the promise of Abraham is now
[1:38:27] fulfilled naturally.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Because God told Abraham your seed will
[1:38:31] not be able to be numbered.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this promise is already
[1:38:36] fulfilled right here.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Jump to verse uh
[1:38:40] uh
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; nine. Give therefore your servant what?
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; An understanding.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; So what did Solomon ask God?
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Understanding.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Solomon.
[1:38:54] Ask God for what?
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Understanding.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Understanding and what?
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; A heart.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And what?
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; To jud to judge the people. In other
[1:39:04] word, he asked wisdom.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Which brother Brandham call discernment.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; God ask Solomon, what do you want?
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Solomon say, I got a big responsibility.
[1:39:21] I want you to give me wisdom. Are we
[1:39:23] together?
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; He says in verse 9, give therefore your
[1:39:27] servant an understanding how to do what?
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Judge thy people. So he was asking
[1:39:32] wisdom for the purpose of who?
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Judging the people.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; For the purpose of the people. Follow me
[1:39:37] my friend.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; For the purpose of the people.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Not his own purpose.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; For the purpose of the people.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; He says to judge your people
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; that I may discern between what?
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Good and bad.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Good and bad. For who is able to do
[1:39:58] what? to judge this thy so great a
[1:40:00] people.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; So the people are so great. Are we
[1:40:03] together?
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; And the speech pleased what?
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; The Lord.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Remember Solomon is talking to God, but
[1:40:09] Solomon is sleeping.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Are we clear?
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; And the speech pleased the Lord that
[1:40:16] Solomon has what?
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Ask this thing.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; And God say unto him, because you have
[1:40:22] asked what?
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; This thing.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Wisdom.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Come on. and have not asked for yourself
[1:40:28] what
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; long life.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Push the brake. So now God begin to tell
[1:40:32] us things that Solomon did not ask.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Solomon asked what?
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Wisdom.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Solomon asked for something that is
[1:40:46] spiritual.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now God is bringing to Solomon
[1:40:53] things that he did not ask.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; So let's see what God is talking to
[1:40:59] Solomon.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; God says what? You didn't ask what?
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Long life.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Long life.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; And what else?
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Riches for thyself.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Riches for what?
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Thyself.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Now I have a question. Who spoke about
[1:41:21] money?
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Answer me please. Who spoke about
[1:41:25] riches? God.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; God. Solomon is asking for spiritual
[1:41:30] things.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; And God is bringing counter things.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; I already warn you. I already warn you.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; I already warn you.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Put your seat belt.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; So who is spiritual
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; and who is carnal? Answer
[1:41:50] me. Answer me. Answer. Spoken word. If
[1:41:53] not, we stop. I go home.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; I need also a break.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; If not, I go home.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; If you don't answer, I go home.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Ah, answer me.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Who?
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; No problem. What is your prayer? Lord
[1:42:14] Jesus Christ, give me wisdom so I know
[1:42:18] how to how to serve you, how to walk
[1:42:21] with you. When we come, we listen to the
[1:42:24] uh uh speaker say this is a wonderful
[1:42:27] sister.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; She's a spiritual sister.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; She's a Christian.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; This is the kind of sister we want.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:42:39] But if you hear sister teaser saying
[1:42:41] Lord give me finances
[1:42:44] only kind of things. You need the Holy
[1:42:47] Ghost.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; You will never be able to fight me. I'm
[1:42:56] in the Bible. I'm in the word.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Did Solomon ask for money?
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; So who brought the subject of money?
[1:43:06] Yeah.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; So why God is bringing something that is
[1:43:09] bad?
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Push the brake.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Remember remember I already warned you
[1:43:19] five times. So don't start problem with
[1:43:20] me.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Don't don't start problem with me.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Uh this is uh hold on some of them are
[1:43:28] put here to keep your seat belt where
[1:43:30] you are.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Let's read this
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; because the king and the chronicle are
[1:43:34] the same. But one give you more detail.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; We need to investigate this riches.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Who talk about money?
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; So who is corner?
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; God forbid.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; God forbid.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; You see now
[1:43:59] message believer chill out.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Chill out.
[1:44:03] Let's go, my friend.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; In 2 Chronicles
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; 1
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; verse what?
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; 11.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Verse what?
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; 12.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And God said to Solomon,
[1:44:11] "Because this was what
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; in thine heart
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; and thou has asked not what?
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Riches,
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; nor what?
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Now we are including not riches but also
[1:44:21] what?
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Wealth."
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Who spoke that
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Can I use this here?
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Can I use this here?
[1:44:33] God God is bringing options. What is the
[1:44:37] option?
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Riches,
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; long life
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; and what?
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Riches.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Riches. Ah, God.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; And what?
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Wealth.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Are you sure?
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Me I wrote because the Bible says so.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Can I continue? He says riches and what?
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Wealth.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; And what?
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Honor.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; But the brother will fall.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Don't worry.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Honor.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Go ahead, my friend. And what?
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Nor the life of thine enemies.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; The life of what?
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; Thine enemies.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; So Solomon already had enemies.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Life of what?
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Enemies. Who's bringing this option?
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Uh, let's go again. And then what?
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Neither yet has asked the long life.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; The long life is there, but have asked
[1:45:38] what?
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Wisdom
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; and what?
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Knowledge for
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; that thou may judge [snorts] my people.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Over whom I have what?
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; May thee king.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; Let's stop right there. So God is
[1:45:47] telling Solomon, you are a good boy.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; You ask spiritual things.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; But you didn't ask riches.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; You didn't ask wealth.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; That's correct. So basically the
[1:45:57] conclusion is this stuff I'm not going
[1:46:00] to give it to you but let's see what God
[1:46:02] does.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Verse 12, wisdom and water.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Knowledge is granted unto thee.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; This is what Solomon asked.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Come on. And I will give thee what?
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Riches.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; So who gave Solomon riches?
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:46:24] But brother, prosperity will make
[1:46:26] somebody to fall.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Let's continue. He gave him what?
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Riches
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; and what?
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; And wealth
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; and what?
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; And honor
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; such as none of the king
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; have had that was what
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; been before thee.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; And neither shall be one
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; after thee.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; So what type of wealth did Solomon get?
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Great rich. In other words, no king
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; can be compared to Solomon.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Even before Solomon and after Solomon,
[1:46:55] no king can be compared to Solomon.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; In riches
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; and in what?
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; And in what?
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Who gave her to him? [cheering]
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; I already told you, you're going to have
[1:47:14] a hard time swallowing. Are we together?
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; But did Solomon ask this?
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; So who is Connor?
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, let me let me show
[1:47:26] you the prayer of Solomon. When Solomon
[1:47:28] was praying, okay, so you see the
[1:47:31] difference between Solomon and God.
[1:47:33] Solomon when he was praying in the book
[1:47:35] of Proverb 30, Solomon said, "Two things
[1:47:38] have I what?"
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; required of thee.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Then deny me them not before I do what
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; I die.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; What do you want? Remove far from me
[1:47:46] vanity and lies.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Give me neither what?
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Poverty nor riches.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; This is Solomon heart.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; But that one was not Solomon heart. That
[1:47:54] was God's heart.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; According to Solomon, don't give me
[1:48:02] riches. Don't give me poverty. Give me
[1:48:04] balance. But according to God, I'm going
[1:48:07] to give you riches
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; that no one has it before you
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; and even after you. Amen.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Can I continue? He said, "Give me
[1:48:22] neither what?
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Poverty,
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; nor what?
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Riches.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Feed me with the food that is what?
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Convenient for me."
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is what we want. Brother
[1:48:30] Steven, lest I be what?
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Fool.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; And do what?
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Deny thee.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; So there is a possibility to deny God
[1:48:36] when you full and say, "Who is the
[1:48:38] Lord?" And lest I be what?
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Poor.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; So poverty also have a danger. Yes.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; What is wrong?
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; When I say when I say riches has a has a
[1:48:54] has a has a has a danger. All of you
[1:48:58] were cheering.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; And now when I say poverty, you are
[1:49:01] backing up now. No, you need to say
[1:49:02] amen.
[1:49:10] [laughter]
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; This message,
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; the message of brother Brandham,
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; huh?
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; The message of brother Brandham.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; When you want to preach this message,
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; like I was born in Africa,
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; you got to take Africa culture
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; because if you don't pay attention, you
[1:49:35] will put a little bit the African
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; or you will put a little bit the
[1:49:38] American. You got to die
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; to yourself
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; and deliver the man of [screaming] God.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you following me. Don't
[1:49:51] deliver your preference. We don't want
[1:49:54] your preference. [cheering]
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; If you grew up poor, you want everybody
[1:49:58] to be poor. If you grow up rich, you
[1:50:00] want everybody to be rich. We don't need
[1:50:02] your background.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Give us the background of the world.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; If you see a pastor who was stingy, if
[1:50:18] he's not careful, everything stingy.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; And you go one way. A pastor who's just
[1:50:23] liberal, liberal, he don't pay
[1:50:24] attention. Everything liberal. No, no,
[1:50:26] no, no. We want the middle of the road.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; We don't want to go there. We don't want
[1:50:30] to go there. Let's stay zero in.
[1:50:33] [cheering]
[1:50:35] Sweet Lord. [applause]
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Sweet Lord.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Riches is bad.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; So why did God give Solomon? Did Solomon
[1:50:45] ask for it?
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; So in other words, it looks like it's
[1:50:48] God who push him to fall.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Because how can you blame Solomon
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; when he didn't ask for it?
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; And when he's asking God, he say, I
[1:50:59] don't want you to give me riches. Amen.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; I hope now I'm I'm I'm opening your
[1:51:06] canon.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm unclogging some channels.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; When you quote brother Brandham,
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; quote everything.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Don't get certain quote and keep
[1:51:21] certain. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[1:51:22] no. Prosperity will lead people to uh uh
[1:51:26] I mean uh I mean uh I mean uh go astray.
[1:51:29] Amen. Quote that sir
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; but also quote s
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; brother Brham say prosperity is a
[1:51:35] blessing if it's handled right
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; quote that as well
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; bring both coats
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; bring both of them
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; don't go in one area and then you leave
[1:51:51] the no no bring us both
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Amen
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; amend
[1:52:02] Go to the message.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Okay, it's a homework. Go search where
[1:52:06] brother Brham is saying. Prosperity is
[1:52:10] not a sign that God is with you.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; We are quick to read that.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Prosperity is not Hallelujah. No,
[1:52:16] no, no, no, no. Slow down.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; You already been trained in this church
[1:52:20] to slow down.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Slow down.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Look who is brother referring to. Amen.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; You will see brother is talking about
[1:52:29] Jeroboam
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; about Ahab
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; and most of them they are bad king sir
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; you won't see brother I'm showing you
[1:52:41] Solomon
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to get I know some of you are
[1:52:47] quiet but I I'm I'm loaded here.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? So
[1:52:52] before you go quick stop read a little
[1:52:54] bit. Brother Brham is talking about
[1:52:56] Micaiah in the time when a king is bad.
[1:53:00] That's why brother Brandham was showing
[1:53:01] that prosperity of that nation was not a
[1:53:04] sign that God was with them
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; because God they rejected the word of
[1:53:08] the Lord.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; The Bible said Jesus was how
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; the Bible I gave it to you. Jesus was
[1:53:20] what? And he made himself what?
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; So that you can become what?
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; Why is that scripture in the Bible?
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Put everything together. [cheering]
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; Bring everything together.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; So we know what to do.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; If not, we are confused.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; So God gave Solomon what? Riches and
[1:53:54] what?
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; And what
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; like nobody before him. And what
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; honor? He's going to have uh uh uh what?
[1:54:03] Uh what? Popularity.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; There you go. There you go.
[1:54:09] Take your time.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; So let's go back to our scripture. Where
[1:54:14] we were, my friend?
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Where we were, my friend?
[1:54:18] I feel anointed. Let's move. Where are
[1:54:21] we? Verse 11. And God said to him,
[1:54:23] because you have not asked what? You
[1:54:25] have asked this thing and have not asked
[1:54:27] for yourself what?
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Neither have asked what
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; riches.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; In the book of Chronicle, he say riches
[1:54:33] and wealth.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Riches for yourself, nor ask what?
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; The life of thine enemies.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; But have asked yourself what?
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Understanding.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; To do what?
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; To discern judgment.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; To discern judgment. Behold, I have done
[1:54:47] according to what?
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Thy words.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Continue, my friend.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Lo, I have given thee a wise and an
[1:54:52] understanding heart.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; So that there was none like thee before
[1:54:56] thee, neither after thee shall any arise
[1:54:59] like unto thee.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Stop. Now
[1:55:02] who knows Solomon fall? I mean fell.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Who knows that? Say amen.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; So my question was why did what made
[1:55:12] Solomon fall?
[1:55:19] Was there money?
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; If it's money, money came from God.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Take your time right now.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; I'm going with you.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; If Solomon fell for riches,
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; who gave him the riches?
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; So God gave him something that will make
[1:55:34] him fall.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Can you preach with me?
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; If it's worth, so God gave him a wealth.
[1:55:43] He knows he's going to fall with him.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Glory, glory, glory.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Let's refocus our lessons.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; What made Solomon fall?
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; But before we refocus, who gave Solomon
[1:55:59] wealth?
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; Who gave him riches?
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; We clear on that one?
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Are we clear?
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Are we clear?
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; What made Solomon to fall? According to
[1:56:11] Deuteronomy
[1:56:12] 17:17, follow me, my friend.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; The Bible say in verse 16, talking about
[1:56:18] the the the the laws that govern a king.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; Because God told Israel, when you have a
[1:56:26] king, right?
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; This is how a king should behave.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; This is before even Saul,
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; before David, before any king.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; It's in the book of Deuteronomy. This
[1:56:39] was under Moses.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; But the Bible say, "But he shall not
[1:56:44] what?"
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Multiply horses to himself.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; So the king must not multiply what?
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Horses.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; And I have a scripture where Solomon was
[1:56:56] getting more horses.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; But you don't get horses for free.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; You get horses with what?
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Money.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; And who gave him the money?
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; Push the brake. Let's continue.
[1:57:09] The Bible says, "But he shall not
[1:57:11] multiply water,
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; horses to himself,
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; nor cause the people to return what
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; to Egypt."
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; Solomon was getting horses from Egypt
[1:57:20] and from cure
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; two places. It's in your Bible.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Follow me, my my friend. This is the
[1:57:25] seventh seal.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; To the end that he should multiply what?
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; For as much as No cause the people to go
[1:57:35] to Egypt. For as much as the Lord has
[1:57:36] say unto you, ye shall henceforth water.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Return no more that way.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; So you cannot multiply
[1:57:43] horses and cause the people to go where?
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; To Egypt.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; That was the first requirement of a
[1:57:50] king. Verse 17. What is the next one?
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; Neither shall he multiply wives to
[1:57:54] himself.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; The king must now multiply what?
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; Wives.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Only one. Sister, Sharon.
[1:58:04] Are we together? Only one.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; The king shall not multiply what?
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; Wives to himself.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; That his heart turn not away.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; If you multiply wife, what is the
[1:58:25] danger?
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; Your heart will turn
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; the heart of the king, the heart of that
[1:58:30] king will turn away from God.
[1:58:35] Amen.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; And what else, my friend?
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; Neither shall he greatly multiply to
[1:58:40] himself silver and gold.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; He cannot multiply what?
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Silver and gold.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Silver and water.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Gold.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Now, who gave Solomon money?
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; But God say the king shall not multiply
[1:58:52] silver and gold.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; I'm asking you. But the wealth of
[1:59:00] Solomon, no one has it before
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; and no one after him.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; So who's breaking the commandment?
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; God forbid.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; What was the problem of Solomon?
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; Was there horses?
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; Was there silver and gold? Because it
[1:59:22] was God that gave it to him.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Let's see. What was the trouble of
[1:59:26] Solomon? Amen.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; Let's We are on first king 4. Let's go
[1:59:32] to first king uh 11.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; I'm still reading the Bible.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; If you there, you can say amen.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; First king 11. If we we will stay in the
[1:59:46] book of first king for a while. So keep
[1:59:48] first king. Don't move.
[1:59:51] Stay put. Are we together?
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; Verse one. But king who? Solomon
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; loved what?
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Many strange women.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; So which commandment did he break?
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; Wives.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Which commandment did Solomon break?
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Multiply wives.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; Wives. And what is the consequences?
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Heart will turn away.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; You won't see where they are condemning
[2:00:13] Solomon for gold and silver.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; I know. I know. I know it sounds like a
[2:00:21] new Bible.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Let's go, my friend. He said, "Strange
[2:00:25] woman together with who?"
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; The daughter of Pharaoh.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Women of what?
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; The Moabites.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; And who?
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Ammonites.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; And who?
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; And who?
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; Zidonians.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; And what?
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; In other words, the brother went into
[2:00:37] the world.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Very deep.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; He got a united state of women.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; Verse two.
[2:00:54] Uh, can I continue? Verse two, all of
[2:00:58] the nation concerning what?
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; Which the Lord said unto the children of
[2:01:02] Israel,
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; uh-huh.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Ye shall not go into them,
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; neither shall they come where?
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; In unto you,
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; for surely they will do what?
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; Turn away your heart after their God.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; So what was the problem? Which
[2:01:14] commandment did Solomon break?
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Multiply wise.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; He says Solomon clung to this what?
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; In love.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; In love. And he had what?
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; 700 wives,
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; brother.
[2:01:28] Princesses and what?
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; 300 concubines.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; I don't know how he was living. Amen.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; And his wife turned away what?
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; His heart
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; because he was that safe. The Lord
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; when he broke the commandment.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; The the the consequences must come.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. What I'm trying to do, I'm trying
[2:01:51] to separate God blessing from the fall
[2:01:54] of Solomon.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; That's what I Because we mix, we say,
[2:01:58] "No, no, no. Because Solomon have
[2:02:00] money." Uh-uh. The money came from God.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Let's separate things correctly.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; Correctly.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Yes, sir.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; Job to verse uh let me skip quickly
[2:02:16] here. Job to verse uh uh nine. Let's go,
[2:02:20] my friend.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; And the Lord was angry with Solomon.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Because his heart was turned.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. He was angry because of
[2:02:27] the money.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Read very good.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; Because his heart was
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. He was No, no, no, no. Let's
[2:02:32] read very good. He was angry because of
[2:02:34] the money that he got.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; Ah, so he was not money.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, God was angry because of what?
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; His heart was turned from the Lord God.
[2:02:44] The heart was turned as a consequences
[2:02:46] to the commandment of Moses.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; For because his heart was turned from
[2:02:53] the Lord God of what?
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; Israel.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; Which appeared to him what?
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Twice.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; And had commanded him concerning what?
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; This thing
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; that he should not go what?
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; After other gods.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; But he kept not the commandment which
[2:03:05] the Lord what?
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; Had commanded.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; So God already warned Solomon.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[2:03:12] about idolatry.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; But Solomon went the way of a women.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; And that's what caused Solomon to fall.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; And as a confirmation again in the book
[2:03:26] of Nehemiah 13 26 Nehemiah say did not
[2:03:32] who?
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; Solomon
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; king of Israel sin by what?
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; These things.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; We need to know what are these things.
[2:03:38] He say among many nation was there what?
[2:03:41] No king like him
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; who was beloved of what?
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; God loved him so much and God made him
[2:03:47] what?
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; King over all Israel.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, even him did what?
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; Outlandish woman
[2:03:53] to sin.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; So the problem of Solomon was the women.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; I hope we together.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; But not money because his money came
[2:04:02] from God.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; His wealth came from God.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; If it's the money, then God made a
[2:04:09] mistake.
[2:04:11] Amen.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; If you have a problem swallowing this,
[2:04:25] you need to swallow this one.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; In the book of Job,
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; I'm going slowly.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; Ah, in the book of Jo I don't know. I
[2:04:37] know somebody's sitting waiting. Where
[2:04:39] did brother Brham? I'm going to give you
[2:04:41] brother Brham.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; Let's go. In the book of Job verse what?
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; One
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; chapter one verse8. And the Lord say
[2:04:48] unto who?
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; Satan.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; What did he say to Satan? Has thou
[2:04:52] considered who?
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; My servant Job.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; So according to God, Job is who?
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; His servant.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; Job.
[2:04:59] Is who?
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; His servant.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; Servant of the Lord. Continue my friend
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; that there is none like him in the
[2:05:05] earth.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; There is no one like Job on the earth.
[2:05:10] No one like Job
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; in the earth.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; Continue my friend.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; A perfect and an upright man.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; Job is how
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; a perfect
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; a perfect
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; and how?
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; An upright man.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; Job is perfect. A spiritual man.
[2:05:28] Continue my friend.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; One that fearth God.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; And is she evil?
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; fearthth God and is chew what?
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Evil.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; Evil. Continue. And what else? Then say
[2:05:38] and answer the Lord.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; Ah okay. So God is testifying of Job.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; He said Job is perfect
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; in the blood of bulls and goat.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus was not here.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; This is the blood of bulls and goat.
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; But Job was found how?
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; Perfect.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; Nobody like Job on the earth.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Job is too evil
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; and God is telling the devil.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; Now listen to what the devil say.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; The devil say and Satan answer the Lord
[2:06:18] and say do job fe [screaming] God for
[2:06:21] nothing.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; In other words, the devil is telling God
[2:06:26] there is a reason why
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; Job is a perfect man.
[2:06:34] There is a reason why Job is a good man.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; There is a reason why Job is unique.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; There is a reason why Job is serving
[2:06:46] you.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; Therefore, what is the reason?
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; The devil say has thou not made a what?
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; And hedge about him
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; about what?
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; His house
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; and about what?
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; All that he hath on every side. So Job
[2:07:01] has 360 protection.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; Job has a protection.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; 360
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; all of it.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; Everything that belong to Job
[2:07:18] protection.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; Let's continue to the next one. And then
[2:07:23] he says, "Thou has what?
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; Blessed the work of his hands."
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; Ah. Hallelujah.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; So Job was blessed
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; and the devil recognized.
[2:07:37] [laughter]
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; Let's read the Bible. So Job was
[2:07:39] blessed.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; And the devil recognized the blessing of
[2:07:42] Job was coming from who?
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; Job, [laughter]
[2:07:47] the devil is telling God, you bless Job.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; And not only did you bless Job, his
[2:07:54] substance
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; is what?
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; Increased in the land. In other words,
[2:07:58] Job prospered.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; What I'm trying to show you here is the
[2:08:08] prosperity of Job
[2:08:10] never [screaming] affected his spiritual
[2:08:13] life.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; Let me start it again. I know where we
[2:08:20] going. The prosperity of Job
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; never affected his relationship
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; with God.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, he was a prosperous
[2:08:31] man.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; Yet he was a perfect man.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; Yet he was a servant of the Lord. Yet he
[2:08:37] was what?
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; Upright.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; One. He was upright. He was just and
[2:08:41] everything. So Job was wealthy
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; and yet Christian.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:51] Are we together?
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; And the devil was trying to make God
[2:08:56] believe
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; that the reason why he's Christian is
[2:09:01] because of the prosperity.
[2:09:04] [applause]
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.

[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. So if the Lord bless him,
[2:12:28] you know when he get money, he will

[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; affected the spiritual life of his wife
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; it's only you you when they give you
[2:13:14] money then you run away from church but
[2:13:17] brother Bham wife when they got money
[2:13:20] she get more consecrated [cheering]
[2:13:24] because they know who gave them the
[2:13:27] money.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; They know the source.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; Is this too strong? Because some of you
[2:13:42] are
[2:13:44] but I don't have any choice. I'm keep
[2:13:46] choosing.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham say he got a

[2:13:56] apartment.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; Where cockroaches are are traveling.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; Huh? And when you see the brother, as
[2:14:10] soon as you come out from the home, you

[2:14:25] be humble. Be humble.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; Brother say a fine what water
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; consecrated wife
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; and there is no reason why they should
[2:14:38] not leave for Christ each day as
[2:14:40] [screaming] they are doing.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; Let's read it again.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say there is no reason
[2:14:49] why They should not live for Christ each
[2:14:53] day as they are what?
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; Because God bless [screaming] them.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; That's why they living for God.
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; And not only that, brother Brandham say
[2:15:07] I met what?
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; Yes son.
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; And they are bad [screaming] children.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; Very fine children.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; They are how many?
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; Very fine children.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; They are what kind of children?
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; Very fine children. So their prosperity
[2:15:18] never affected their spiritual life.
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; Matter of fact, he brought them back
[2:15:23] [screaming] to God.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; Because they understood the source of
[2:15:27] the money.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; Let me continue. Brother Brandham say we
[2:15:36] are so grateful for what?
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; This fellowship
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; that we have what?
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; One with another.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; What am I trying to say?
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Prosperity can lead somebody away
[2:15:47] from God. It is true.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; What God want is to know where it's
[2:15:52] coming from.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; And that is the problem between the
[2:15:56] devil and Job.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; The devil was trying to prove to God
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; that if you remove prosperity, Job will
[2:16:04] run away from the church.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; And God say, I'm going to prove to you
[2:16:08] that Job where the money
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; or no money. It doesn't matter. Job will
[2:16:14] remain Christian. [cheering]
[2:16:17] [applause]
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; Because when Job receive wealth, he say
[2:16:24] the Lord giveth.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; If it's God, he said the Lord taketh
[2:16:28] away.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; In other words, prosperity does nothing
[2:16:35] to Job.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, Job controls
[2:16:44] prosperity.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Burcham controls prosperity.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; Prosperity push him to God. Not away
[2:16:53] from God. And I pray in this church we
[2:16:56] can have brother Job and brother Burton
[2:17:00] and sister Burton people that when God
[2:17:03] blesses you, you stay closer to God. You
[2:17:07] stay closer to his word. Our children
[2:17:09] serve him.
[2:17:11] Amen.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering]
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; If your money keep you out of the
[2:17:19] church,
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; you got a problem.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; If your money make you miss services,
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; miss question and answer miss all the
[2:17:28] meeting and the married couple and the
[2:17:30] whatever your money now with standing in
[2:17:32] the way of the Lord. The Bible say the
[2:17:35] love of money.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; It is the greediness of you loving
[2:17:40] money. But this is not me loving. This
[2:17:43] is God blessing me.
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; I hope you can see the difference.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; The more [screaming] you get prospered,
[2:17:53] the more you love him.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; The more you serve him.
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; Because you realize everything is him.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; My wife is him. My children is him. This
[2:18:04] church is him. The building is him. The
[2:18:07] pulpit is him. [cheering]
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; My clothing is him.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; What do you have that you didn't receive
[2:18:16] from him? Everything I have, I receive
[2:18:19] it from him.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; He is my [screaming] everything.
[2:18:23] [cheering]
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; He's my source, my God, my wealth, my
[2:18:28] riches, my protection.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause]
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; Listen to Paul.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; Paul say, "Not that I speak in respect
[2:18:50] of water."
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; For I learn in whatever state I am,
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; there we be what?
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; Content.
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; I know both how to be what? A base
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; and had to be water.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; Abound.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; Everywhere in [screaming] all things. I
[2:19:03] am what?
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; Instructed
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; both to be what?
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; Full
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; or to be what?
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; Hungry.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; Both to do what?
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; Abound.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; And to do what?
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; Suffer and need.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; I can do what?
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; All things
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; through Christ that has what?
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; Strengthened me.
[2:19:21] [cheering]
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; A brother get a promotion. Oh no, no,
[2:19:27] no, no. Be careful. Hey, I was praying
[2:19:30] for that
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; and God gave it to me.
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; I will master the promotion.
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; That promotion will bring me in church
[2:19:38] on Wednesday, on church on Sunday, on
[2:19:41] question and answer. I am right
[2:19:42] [screaming] there
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; and I praise the Lord.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Robert, I praise the Lord for a
[2:19:48] muck.
[2:19:53] [cheering]
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; Who gave Solomon the wealth?
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; Who gave him the riches?
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; Can God give him something to make him
[2:20:15] for?
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; God gave it to Job. Did he make Job
[2:20:19] fall?
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:20:21] But the devil trying to make God think
[2:20:23] that Job is serving you because of the
[2:20:26] money. Remove the money and I will show
[2:20:29] you. And God say you don't know the
[2:20:31] caliber of spoken word.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; Spoken word. Even if you remove money,
[2:20:36] they stay with the word.
[2:20:40] [cheering]
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because what is
[2:20:46] attracting them is the word. It's the
[2:20:49] quality of the word
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; that is attracting them
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; and then the devil destroy everything
[2:20:56] and God keep watching
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; and after a while God say Satan
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; enough
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; enough. I prove to you that no
[2:21:06] [screaming] matter what you do they are
[2:21:08] still serving me [cheering] now.
[2:21:11] Now double double everything. Double
[2:21:16] [cheering]
[2:21:17] double double the blessing. Double
[2:21:20] everything.
[2:21:25] [cheering]
[2:21:28] [applause]
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; Do you know what the prophet say?
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say actually God was
[2:21:36] purging Job to bless him more.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if we for Job was a problem,
[2:21:43] why did God increase everything double?
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; And after you read the Bible, do you see
[2:21:48] where they say and God sin and I mean
[2:21:51] and Job sin after everything was double.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; Did you see that in the Bible?
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; Why are you the only one sinning when
[2:21:58] you get money?
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; You need to know your caliber.
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; An elect of God will always remain in
[2:22:05] the word.
[2:22:09] Are we together?
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; So if you you are content where you are,
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; fine.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; Don't judge brother so and so.
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; Don't judge brother so and so because he
[2:22:24] might be brother Burchham.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; This one might be brother Job.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; Leave brother Bertam and brother Job
[2:22:29] alone.
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; We did them for the construction of the
[2:22:33] building.
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:22:37] [applause]
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; When we want to change the building, we
[2:22:45] need them because when we say brother
[2:22:47] Bham uh we need to do the building for
[2:22:50] brother Bham say but that is my
[2:22:52] opportunity after everything that God
[2:22:55] have done for me. Let me build him a
[2:22:58] temple. And Solomon Solomon built the
[2:23:02] temple.
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:23:08] [applause]
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; Who built the temple of God?
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; What type of temple did he build?
[2:23:20] [screaming]
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; What type of temple did he build?
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; What type of temple did he build?
[2:23:31] Hey,
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; your preference
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; away from this church.
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; Your culture
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; away from this church. The family you
[2:23:39] came in away from this church. In this
[2:23:42] church, the Bible and the message.

[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Steven.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; Ah. Now we have cleared up the smoke.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; Now we have cleared up the smoke. But I
[2:24:25] still have a question
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; because you know me I I reason a lot.
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; You say things like this. It make me
[2:24:31] ponder. But uh
[2:24:36] &gt;&gt; it's true. It's true. I see that in the
[2:24:39] Bible. I see what brother Brandham say.
[2:24:41] But brother.
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; So why should God give Solomon
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; such a wealth?
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; It's just a question I have.
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; Yes my brother. I got an answer for you.
[2:24:55] Are we together?
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; Have I said something wrong?
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; Have I said something wrong?
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; Brother say now he was referring to who?
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; Solomon.
[2:25:04] &gt;&gt; God raised Solomon up as a top of who?
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; Christ.
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; Solomon represented who?
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; Christ.
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; Over there. I don't hear it. Solomon
[2:25:17] represented who?
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; Christ.
[2:25:20] &gt;&gt; The king of kings.
[2:25:23] Solomon was reflecting who?
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; Christ?
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; Like Joseph was reflecting Jesus Christ
[2:25:29] as the son of what?
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; The son of prosperity. [screaming]
[2:25:37] [cheering]
[2:25:38] [applause]
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Praise the Lord.
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; we have come up with our own
[2:25:48] denominational stuff.
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; And no preacher want to preach about
[2:25:54] this
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; because they afraid they will see them
[2:25:56] as corner.
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; Thank God he blessed me before I become
[2:26:06] a pastor. And so I'm not after money in
[2:26:08] the ting.
[2:26:10] You can't say no. No, no, no, no,
[2:26:11] nothing. God knew. He knew. He said this
[2:26:14] one if he get they will say he's looking
[2:26:16] for money. Uhhuh. My house was before
[2:26:18] pastor.
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; My car before pastor.
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; So money is not a problem. You giving me
[2:26:28] the t I take it. I build the building.
[2:26:31] It doesn't bother me.
[2:26:41] It's the people outside. Oh, now he's
[2:26:44] rich.
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; Now he's a doctor and he's a pastor. He
[2:26:48] got all the money. Only Mat.
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; So my dad is really juicy. [cheering]
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; All the other people that were not a
[2:26:57] problem. Only brother Steven.
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute.
[2:27:02] [laughter]
[2:27:08] You go somewhere and tighten the pastor.
[2:27:10] You go somewhere and tighten the pastor.
[2:27:11] I say all this time you were not talking
[2:27:13] about that and the pastor only when I
[2:27:14] became a pastor. So your heart are
[2:27:16] trembling because God is going to pour
[2:27:19] more
[2:27:21] [cheering]
[2:27:22] [applause]
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; and jealousy.
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; Why did [screaming] God give Solomon
[2:27:42] such a great wealth?
[2:27:46] Now we separated. His problem is women.
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; But God has a purpose of giving him
[2:27:51] wealth.
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; What? What's the purpose of wealth? He
[2:27:54] was reflecting Christ.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; If you still struggling, I still have
[2:28:01] ammunition. It's coming.
[2:28:04] &gt;&gt; You know the old canon when they put and
[2:28:06] they load and it goes and they load. So
[2:28:07] they're going to load more.
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Listen to this. Brother
[2:28:12] Brham say now God had done what
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; a great thing in the in the days of
[2:28:17] Solomon
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; and we all know as reader of the what?
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; Bless the word
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; that s the age of Solomon was considered
[2:28:23] what
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; the golden age of Israel
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; the golden age of Israel they did what
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; they built the temple
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; and the whole world paid what
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; them tribute in the reign of
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; which was a foreshadow of who?
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; Christ
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; the what?
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; The son of David.
[2:28:40] of David.
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; God was making his own story
[2:28:47] &gt;&gt; in the life of Solomon.
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; You are more spiritual than God.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; God is carnal for you.
[2:28:55] &gt;&gt; But brother, he says God gave Solomon a
[2:28:59] what?
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; A gift.
[2:29:00] &gt;&gt; And the whole church,
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; he didn't say the whole country. The
[2:29:05] whole what?
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; Church.
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; What?
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; Everybody
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; did what?
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; Believe this. They believe who?
[2:29:10] &gt;&gt; The gift.
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; The gift of God in who?
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; Solomon.
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; That was a millennium for the Jews.
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; So the wealth of Solomon was reflecting
[2:29:24] what?
[2:29:25] &gt;&gt; Christ.
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; Be careful.
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; Be careful.
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; It was reflecting what?
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; Millennium.
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; The millennium. That was the what?
[2:29:35] &gt;&gt; Old Testament millennium.
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; Old Testament millennium. In which day,
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; the days of Sodom,
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; a foreshadow of what?
[2:29:42] &gt;&gt; The millennium to come.
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; The golden age of what?
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; The Jews.
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; Notice nobody started what?
[2:29:48] &gt;&gt; War with them.
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; They did what?
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; They feared them.
[2:29:50] &gt;&gt; Because they know how
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; their God was real.
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; Because they heard him where
[2:29:55] &gt;&gt; in their presence.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; And the people was all what?
[2:29:59] &gt;&gt; One heart.
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; And what?
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; One accord.
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:30:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Listen to this my
[2:30:07] friend. Brother says, "So after what
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; Israel was convinced
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; they never separated in water
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; in little."
[2:30:14] &gt;&gt; So when Israel realized that God sent us
[2:30:16] a gift
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; in the midst of us,
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; no more problem in the church.
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:23] &gt;&gt; No more problem in the church.
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; No more fasting in the church. They say,
[2:30:26] "Let's focus in this gift."
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; Hey, God send us a blessing.
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together? He said they
[2:30:33] they never separated in what? and little
[2:30:35] coats,
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; but with what?
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; One accord.
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; They have what?
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; Gave witness to the gift.
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; And then the outside world begin to do

[2:35:32] &gt;&gt; brother say even the wife Solomon have
[2:35:36] &gt;&gt; he was representing Jesus Christ as many
[2:35:40] members body

[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; Solomon.
[2:36:11] &gt;&gt; In the days of who?
[2:36:12] &gt;&gt; Solomon.
[2:36:13] &gt;&gt; Any Bible reader knows that that was
[2:36:15] what?
[2:36:16] &gt;&gt; The golden age of Israel.
[2:36:17] &gt;&gt; That was their best days.
[2:36:20] they ever had
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; that was the what?
[2:36:23] &gt;&gt; Amateur millennium.
[2:36:25] &gt;&gt; Everything everything did what?
[2:36:27] &gt;&gt; Prospered under Solomon.
[2:36:29] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:36:32] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:36:34] &gt;&gt; Because Solomon love money.
[2:36:36] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:36:38] &gt;&gt; Did Solomon ask for money?
[2:36:40] &gt;&gt; He told God, "Don't give me riches."
[2:36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together? He says, "Why? When God
[2:36:47] give what?
[2:36:47] &gt;&gt; A gift to a people." to a what?
[2:36:50] &gt;&gt; A people
[2:36:50] &gt;&gt; or what?
[2:36:51] &gt;&gt; A nation
[2:36:52] &gt;&gt; or what?
[2:36:52] &gt;&gt; A people.
[2:36:53] &gt;&gt; And those people will recognize what
[2:36:56] &gt;&gt; that gift.
[2:36:56] &gt;&gt; It's a golden age for those people.
[2:36:59] [cheering]
[2:37:00] [applause]
[2:37:06] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. You got a pastor who sometime
[2:37:10] I don't know if sometime or or most of
[2:37:12] the time he's not scared. If God gave
[2:37:15] you a gift, spoken word
[2:37:18] &gt;&gt; and you recognize that gift, it's going
[2:37:20] to be a golden age for you. [cheering]
[2:37:29] &gt;&gt; This is not my gift. It's the gift of
[2:37:31] the Holy Ghost

[2:37:52] &gt;&gt; There's no way to separate the messenger
[2:37:54] and his message.
[2:37:56] &gt;&gt; They are one and the same.
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham say if you turn it
[2:38:00] down, it is what?
[2:38:01] &gt;&gt; Chaos for you.
[2:38:02] &gt;&gt; That's the reason he kept saying greater
[2:38:04] than Solomon is what?
[2:38:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:38:07] Yes, sir.
[2:38:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:10] &gt;&gt; Solomon [snorts]
[2:38:11] represented what?
[2:38:13] &gt;&gt; He represented Christ. He represented
[2:38:15] the millennium.
[2:38:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together? God gave abundance of
[2:38:20] riches for a purpose.
[2:38:22] &gt;&gt; He knew this is the one that's going to
[2:38:24] build the temple.
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; And in the millennium, a temple will be
[2:38:29] built.
[2:38:30] &gt;&gt; And Solomon was reflecting all of that.

[2:44:56] &gt;&gt; Once a year.
[2:44:57] &gt;&gt; Every group of young sister only operate
[2:45:00] how many time a year?
[2:45:02] &gt;&gt; Once.
[2:45:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:09] &gt;&gt; So the officer who operate in January
[2:45:13] must operate when again
[2:45:15] &gt;&gt; January.
[2:45:16] &gt;&gt; So he have how many week how many month
[2:45:19] of preparation?
[2:45:21] &gt;&gt; 11 months.
[2:45:23] &gt;&gt; So this officer when he distribute or
[2:45:27] when he bring food to Solomon
[2:45:29] &gt;&gt; in January,
[2:45:30] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[2:45:32] &gt;&gt; When January is finished, do you follow
[2:45:34] me?
[2:45:35] &gt;&gt; When he start February,
[2:45:37] &gt;&gt; he cannot be careless.
[2:45:40] Right.
[2:45:43] &gt;&gt; I I don't know if we together because
[2:45:45] according to me and you, when they say
[2:45:48] you only do that in January, then after
[2:45:51] the 31st of January,
[2:45:54] you clock out. Oh, glory to God. I got
[2:45:57] one year vacation, vacation, vacation,
[2:46:02] vacation. I'm going to sleep because ah,
[2:46:06] brother, when is it? Oh, it's still
[2:46:07] April. Ah, come [snorts] on, man.
[2:46:10] Hallelujah. When is it? September. No,
[2:46:11] no. I still have [laughter] three
[2:46:13] months. I want Oh, now it's what?
[2:46:15] November. Okay, let me start to get to
[2:46:18] job now. It's November. December because
[2:46:21] January is coming. Let's see what type
[2:46:25] of food Solomon was eating.
[2:46:28] &gt;&gt; And then we stop.
[2:46:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:46:32] &gt;&gt; A season which is preparing what?
[2:46:36] &gt;&gt; Let's my friend let we on seven. Job to
[2:46:39] verse 20
[2:46:42] &gt;&gt; if you dare you can say amen.
[2:46:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:44] &gt;&gt; Judah and water
[2:46:46] &gt;&gt; Israel
[2:46:46] &gt;&gt; were how
[2:46:47] &gt;&gt; many
[2:46:47] &gt;&gt; as the sand which is water
[2:46:49] &gt;&gt; by the sea and Moses.
[2:46:50] &gt;&gt; So the promise of Abraham is fulfilled
[2:46:53] right here
[2:46:54] &gt;&gt; in the days of Solomon
[2:46:56] &gt;&gt; naturally. Jesus fulfilled it
[2:46:58] spiritually
[2:47:00] &gt;&gt; when he get the bride with our numbers
[2:47:02] and everything.
[2:47:03] &gt;&gt; But Solomon fulfill it there. That's why
[2:47:05] brother Brham is saying he's stopping
[2:47:07] the millennium. Right?
[2:47:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:47:09] &gt;&gt; He says verse 20, Judah and Israel were
[2:47:12] what?
[2:47:12] &gt;&gt; Many.
[2:47:13] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, I'm heading to the airport.
[2:47:14] You the one taking time. Many as the
[2:47:17] sand which is what
[2:47:18] &gt;&gt; by the sea
[2:47:19] &gt;&gt; in multitude doing what?
[2:47:21] &gt;&gt; Eating and drinking
[2:47:22] &gt;&gt; and what
[2:47:22] &gt;&gt; making Mary
[2:47:23] &gt;&gt; and making what? Because there is no
[2:47:25] wall.
[2:47:26] &gt;&gt; It's a millennium.
[2:47:28] &gt;&gt; Because in the millennium the devil will
[2:47:29] be what?
[2:47:30] &gt;&gt; Bound.
[2:47:31] &gt;&gt; That's why Solomon is reflecting the
[2:47:33] millennium. Why there is no wall?
[2:47:36] But the devil is there
[2:47:40] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together
[2:47:41] &gt;&gt; and the people are doing what? Eating
[2:47:44] and what?
[2:47:44] &gt;&gt; Drinking
[2:47:45] &gt;&gt; and watering
[2:47:46] &gt;&gt; and being just having fellowship.
[2:47:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:47:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:49] &gt;&gt; Watch now. Verse 21. And Solomon did
[2:47:52] what?
[2:47:53] &gt;&gt; Reigned over all kingdoms.
[2:47:54] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:47:55] &gt;&gt; From the river unto the land of the
[2:47:56] Philistines.
[2:47:57] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:47:58] &gt;&gt; And unto the border of Egypt.
[2:47:59] &gt;&gt; They brought presents and served Solomon
[2:48:02] all the days of his life.
[2:48:03] &gt;&gt; Verse 22. And Solomon provision for
[2:48:07] what?
[2:48:07] &gt;&gt; One day.

[2:48:09] &gt;&gt; One day.
[2:48:12] &gt;&gt; The provision of how many day?
[2:48:14] &gt;&gt; One day.
[2:48:16] &gt;&gt; I hope some of you will be swallowing
[2:48:18] this.
[2:48:19] &gt;&gt; Can I erase this?
[2:48:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:48:20] &gt;&gt; Can I erase this?
[2:48:22] &gt;&gt; We clear with this, right?
[2:48:23] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[2:48:24] &gt;&gt; The provision of how many days?
[2:48:26] &gt;&gt; One day.
[2:48:27] &gt;&gt; The provision of hard one day.

[2:48:45] &gt;&gt; So if you take 10 days, how many measure
[2:48:48] do you need to have?
[2:48:49] &gt;&gt; 300.
[2:48:50] &gt;&gt; If you take 20 days, how many I mean
[2:48:53] measure do you have to have?
[2:48:55] &gt;&gt; 600 measure.
[2:48:57] &gt;&gt; Let's continue. He says 30 measure of
[2:49:00] water. Fine flour
[2:49:01] &gt;&gt; and water.
[2:49:02] &gt;&gt; Three score measures of meal.

[2:49:23] &gt;&gt; And in 10 days, how many oxen?
[2:49:25] &gt;&gt; 100.
[2:49:26] &gt;&gt; In 20 days, how many?
[2:49:27] &gt;&gt; 200. And then in 30 days, how many?
[2:49:30] &gt;&gt; 300.
[2:49:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[2:49:34] &gt;&gt; Now you begin to understand.
[2:49:36] &gt;&gt; And now you begin. So now think about if
[2:49:38] you waiting till November
[2:49:41] &gt;&gt; to start collecting things.
[2:49:44] &gt;&gt; Ah,

[2:49:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together? I'm heading close. I'm
[2:49:51] closing. I'm I'm just coming down. He

[2:50:08] &gt;&gt; And in 30 days, how many sheep?
[2:50:10] &gt;&gt; 3,000.
[2:50:14] &gt;&gt; Can I continue now? Ah,
[2:50:18] &gt;&gt; you have your Bible all along. Today it
[2:50:20] looks like your Bible is different.

[2:50:32] &gt;&gt; Deer.

[2:50:51] &gt;&gt; And every officer have to provide for
[2:50:54] what?
[2:50:54] &gt;&gt; One month. So what about if the officer
[2:50:57] is slacking throughout the year?
[2:51:05] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together now.
[2:51:07] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together now.
[2:51:09] &gt;&gt; Do you see the wisdom of Solomon?
[2:51:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:51:13] &gt;&gt; So the officer as soon as January is
[2:51:16] finished,
[2:51:18] &gt;&gt; he's enjoying his break but still
[2:51:21] &gt;&gt; he begin to work.

[2:51:29] &gt;&gt; He's preparing a season.
[2:51:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:32] &gt;&gt; In the season.

[2:51:40] &gt;&gt; So break don't mean break.
[2:51:47] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:48] &gt;&gt; The rest don't mean rest the way you
[2:51:51] think.
[2:51:52] It is a different type of rest.
[2:51:54] &gt;&gt; It is a break but that break is
[2:51:57] preparing another thing.
[2:51:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:52:19] Brother Brandham say he becomes us as to
[2:52:22] do what?
[2:52:22] &gt;&gt; Fulfill our righteousness.
[2:52:24] &gt;&gt; I come from a trip where I have been one
[2:52:27] &gt;&gt; on a hunting trip
[2:52:29] &gt;&gt; where where I have been upon a what?
[2:52:31] &gt;&gt; A hunting trip
[2:52:32] &gt;&gt; with a man up near what?

[2:52:43] &gt;&gt; Rebuild myself. making ready for the
[2:52:46] season that laid ahead for the service.
[2:52:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:54] &gt;&gt; Brother me is saying he's rebuilding
[2:52:56] himself.
[2:52:58] &gt;&gt; He's preparing himself.
[2:53:00] &gt;&gt; He's taking a break hunting, but not
[2:53:03] really taking a break. He's actually
[2:53:05] rebuilding himself for the oncoming
[2:53:08] season.
[2:53:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[2:53:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:53:15] &gt;&gt; So when you coming from a trial,
[2:53:20] &gt;&gt; be careful.
[2:53:21] &gt;&gt; You are resting, but charge again
[2:53:24] [screaming] your weapon.
[2:53:25] &gt;&gt; Begin to prepare
[2:53:27] &gt;&gt; for the next one.
[2:53:31] [applause]
[2:53:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:53:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Let's stop here. Amen.
[2:53:41] &gt;&gt; Go home and study this because I could
[2:53:44] not get to the scripture of the
[2:53:46] structure of Solomon. Are we together?
[2:53:48] &gt;&gt; But I want to show you how 12 month was
[2:53:51] not a month of joke
[2:53:56] &gt;&gt; because they need 3,000 uh I mean I mean
[2:53:58] sheep
[2:54:00] &gt;&gt; that you need to provide
[2:54:02] &gt;&gt; for your month. So if you play
[2:54:04] throughout the year, you'll be caught on
[2:54:06] guard.
[2:54:07] It was a prosperity,
[2:54:10] but that prosperity needed structure.
[2:54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54:16] &gt;&gt; If you let that prosperity like this,
[2:54:17] you'll be caught off guard.
[2:54:19] &gt;&gt; It need to be structured.
[2:54:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:54:24] age working season within a season.
[2:54:27] Let's stand. Let's stop here.

[2:54:46] uh 4. Right.
[2:54:48] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:54:49] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read verse 29. When you
[2:54:52] standing, the Bible say, "And God gave
[2:54:55] Solomon wisdom and understanding
[2:54:59] exceeding much and largeness of heart,
[2:55:03] even as the sand that is at the
[2:55:06] seashore."
[2:55:09] &gt;&gt; Israel was how?
[2:55:12] &gt;&gt; The sand that is what?
[2:55:15] &gt;&gt; So the wisdom God gave Solomon was what?
[2:55:19] &gt;&gt; The sand as what? to match the
[2:55:22] population, to match the people.
[2:55:25] &gt;&gt; In other word, all Israel was covered.
[2:55:30] &gt;&gt; The wisdom given to Solomon was to match
[2:55:33] the number of Israel.
[2:55:37] &gt;&gt; A millennium for the Jews.
[2:55:39] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[2:55:42] are approaching you humbly this
[2:55:44] afternoon. Father, thanking you for your
[2:55:46] grace, for your love, your mercy, and
[2:55:49] for everything you have been doing for
[2:55:51] us. Lord, this is as far as you wanted
[2:55:55] me to go with the ability you have given
[2:55:58] me. Lord, you spoke about the [music]
[2:56:00] work. You spoke about your blessing.
[2:56:03] How, Father, you are everything to us.
[2:56:06] You the God that bless us spiritually,
[2:56:09] physically, financially, [music]
[2:56:11] materially, in every aspect because we
[2:56:14] are depending completely upon thee.
[2:56:17] Lord, when is when Israel was going to
[2:56:19] the promised land, you warned them about
[2:56:23] Lord not letting their heart going
[2:56:25] astray because of the blessing that we
[2:56:28] found. But Lord, Father, today you are
[2:56:30] showing us that there [music] are people
[2:56:32] like Job that will stand despite the
[2:56:36] blessing. They will always depend and
[2:56:38] recognize the master because you are the
[2:56:41] one that gave us everything. [music]
[2:56:43] Because you told Israel [singing] that
[2:56:45] remember I am the Lord that give you
[2:56:47] power to get her wealth. And that's what
[2:56:50] we want to remember all the time that
[2:56:52] our sufficiency is coming from thee and
[2:56:55] with you we can do all things. [music]
[2:56:57] Father, may you take what the words that
[2:57:00] were spoken tonight I mean today. May
[2:57:02] you continue to minister to your
[2:57:04] children. May you unfold more than what
[2:57:06] we gave. Lord, Father, so that we can
[2:57:09] keep a right balance and keep moving on
[2:57:12] and moving on and prosper as our soul is
[2:57:15] prospering indeed. We commit this
[2:57:17] oncoming week unto the hand. We claim
[2:57:20] the blood of the lamb upon us, upon
[2:57:22] everything that is connected to us. We
[2:57:25] rebuke the devil away from us. Father,
[2:57:27] take this inspection coming up on
[2:57:29] Tuesday unto thy hand. Let it go well.
[2:57:32] Let the rain stop and let you open up
[2:57:34] the way so that they can pour whatever
[2:57:37] they need to pour this week in the name
[2:57:39] of Jesus Christ.
[2:57:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
