amen so we we're gonna take um [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] tonight [Music] [Music] this is foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen glory to God [Applause] the power today and the air conditioning working Amanda it took the grace of God on Sunday the anointing was so strong until we forgot about the temperature amen glory to God we want to praise God for restoring everything back in order amen he remind me one time at brother Chad Lamb that the power went off and they had service under a tree so could have been worse but God kept us here and cold the temperature send an anointing and then before you know it we forgot about everything and what a wonderful sermon amen the supernatural making itself known amen and I'm proud We got the supernatural in the midst of us we got the mechanic and the dynamic we got both of them going on because the gospel is not in word only but in the power and the demonstration of the Gospel amen amen there is no way you can put the messaging needs pure Place back in order without the power of the Holy Spirit backing up amen not backing up ass but backing up the word the message because the spirit always follow the message and the spirit and his word are won amen we thank God for it amen you want the dynamic and the mechanic Glory Glory Hallelujah Amen brother Branham mentioned something about the the Evangelical and the Pentecostal he said one knows how to write a check but no money another one got the money and doesn't know how to write the check so you need to have both you need to have both money and you need to know how to write a check and I thank God we got both of them amen we got the power the power of the Lord Jesus Christ and we know how to write our check because every promise in the book is amen every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line so it's up to you to search what is in the scripture that belong to you claim it and Associate your faith there and then you can get it amen you pray for me so we can pick up on Sunday where we left and continue to go amen how many were here when I spoke about the evidence of the holy spirit in question and answer you remember that it's a question that has been all over the message for a year what is the evidence of the Holy Spirit and thing and I mentioned that how many were here it was in question and answer okay okay yeah because I use a coat on Sunday where brother Branham uses love as the greatest evidence and then after 63 brother Branham said the Holy Spirit straighten him up and say it's the word but the Capstone also is love so now you need to know how to put coach together everybody okay you need to know how to put coach together and I'm a firm believer those that are online I'm a firm believer that the message doesn't contradict itself amen amen you remember last question and answer we had to quote we had several quotes where brother Branham say Moses and Elijah are going to be the same Moses and Elijah and there was only one coat after the seals when brother went to question and answer brother say I'm inclined to believe that it's going to be the anointing on people amen those quotes never contradict one another if you were there on question and answer you know what I'm talking about we took buff coat and put them together and found out that brother Branham never deviated from what we spoke is it the anointing yes is it the same people yes both quotes are corrected [Applause] so when you read brother Branham you need to be very careful I can take before the seals and go in marriage and divorce and pick up things that brother Branham spoke before the seals and pulled them after the seal and put them together and brother Brian I'm never contradict himself it's just the opening of the seals built a greater open a greater Revelation brother Brandon preached serpent seed but after the seals open he pick up marriage and divorce and the way he dropped with serpent seed is only deeper than the serpent seed before so you take the serpent seed before and after the seal and you see the whole picture clarify so you pray for me I will see if I need to catch up on that evidence before I move forward or if everything that was if everybody that was in question and answer are okay we keep moving forward but you pray for me and I see how it is because somebody uh reminded me sending me a quote where the holy spirit is straightening them up and I have like uh if I'm not mistaken I don't know it's seven or eight coat that I have loaded so if I begin to read them on Sunday I won't preach what I'm trying to preach so I will see whether I can pull fewer and then the remaining I put them on the church group chat and you continue with it but just to bring the balance and to see where things are when we say receiving the word of the hour you need to know where are you receiving the word of the hour because we got people that preached this message for a long time that we thought received the word of the hour and after 20 years those people left the message at the beginning we thought they received the word of the hour man now when they leave the message did they really receive the word of the hour so you need to know what is receiving the word of the arm the one who received the word by revelation will stay on that word all the way to the end [Music] [Applause] amen you pray for me and I see the direction of the holy spirit amen did I stir your mind now you are your appetite is already stirred up if you want you go back to the sermon you revisit that again because on Sunday I'm trying to get where faith and love are working deeper and the Holy Spirit even unfolded something that I will probably deal with married people if I get a chance to have a married couple I've never seen it I read it before never I read it read it use the code and recently I look at and say oh my goodness this message is something it's like the scripture when you're reading brother Branham they got layers under what brother Branham is saying you can read the message and you don't really get what brother Branham is saying until the Holy Spirit open up and say oh my God this is something really really really really important but let's see how the spirit will lead amen our young men meeting will be this coming Saturday a Brother Kelly's home brother Kelly is someone correct yet so you will receive the address it's going to be at 2 30. so meet you on time patch York amen okay praise be to the name of the Lord whoever is not here tonight who is trimming patriarch we meet you on time at 2 30. Brother Kelly's home amen we have brother Samuel Taylor he was here on Sunday you saw him we presented him to the church he's still here for a week I believe till Monday he's coming from uh Cape Coast in Ghana and but Robert told me he preached before but I never met him and this is my first time so since he's around here I thought to open the pulpit and let him be a blessing to the church so whoever have not caught in uh teach us how to pray part two we get some Grace so go ahead and catch up because we need to get on to we already got Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be that name that Kingdom Come that will be done now we need to get give us this day our daily bread until we continue amen blessed be the name of the Lord only believe whom live believe oh We Believe thank you all things are a possible holy I believe oh [Music] We Believe oh [Music] all things [Music] Eternal Father we thank you and by your grace we are together again according to your word Lord we are gathered before you father after the day's work Lord we have to come into your presence to receive a refreshing father we are asking forgive us of all our shortcomings no mistakes in all that we have done Lord cleanse us from them all and help us oh God in thy presence this evening to be renewed in our minds in strength in all that we are lacking in both spiritually and physically help us this day Lord no one comes into your presence and goes back the same Lord may your word what comes to us never return to your Void my meet Minister unto us may to accomplish his purpose in US we thank you Heavenly Father as many as are elsewhere oh God joining us father be with him those who for any reason cannot be here with us wherever they are may they receive their portion of the children's bread we are this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah before we take our seats I want us to read a scripture from Philippians chapter 2 and verse 12 Philippians chapter 2 verse 12. and we'll read our second scripture also from John chapter 4 and verse 24. so we look at Philippians chapter 2 and verse 24. let's hear the word of the Lord wait for my beloved as ye have always obeyed not us in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling amen and then John chapter 4 the god is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth amen can we please take our seats I'm very grateful to be here with you not seeing myself as a visitor but as one of you because uh we are all on the same wavelengths and there I bring greetings from Ghana and Cape Coast which is the central region that is where I am with a little flock of about 150 and I bring greetings also from my family um I want to thank brother Stephen so much for gave me the hand at the right hand of Fellowship you know it's I'm meeting him for the first time and I believe he's also meeting me for the first time and as a minister it's not easy yes leaving your Pulpit to somebody you don't know or you haven't heard before so me I mean it's a risky thing so oh yes because anything that is done wrong you have to go back is it when something is being damaged it takes just a short time but to get this incorrect corrected takes a longer time so it's not easy I really appreciate you my brother I appreciate you so much yes it's no easy um this evening I just want to talk about the lonely program the lonely pilgrim he said God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth again he says in Philippians chapter 12 we've already read wherefore my beloved I see have always obeyed not us in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling so the salvation is based on we as individuals lonely program so it's not by sight or it's by what others say but it is by what you believe you know Christianity is a call of God has to call you and God calling you as an individual he doesn't call us as a group as individuals like our Father Abraham was called you know when God called him Abraham thought oh well Lord is my nephew oh my whatever and it doesn't really matter going along with him but we know the story what happened how about his blessings were withheld until there came a separation between him and Lord right so God didn't include Lord in that call the call was for Abraham and him alone see he was to go alone and follow the lord God didn't want any interference in that relationship but he took a lot along anyhow and so it's kind of affected that that relation that God wanted to have with him I was asking Pastor whether I could be quoting the prophet he said you are in line with me because otherwise whatever I say if it's not from the Bible and from in front of it's not from the message then it is not authentic Hallelujah so I I have the Liberty to quote the prophet amen in a message Jehovah Jireh he said and we find him then that God told him to separate himself from all his Kindred that is Abraham and to walk among estranged people speaking a strange language so he was Abraham who was to leave his father's house leave his kindness leave everything and to go and walk among estranged people and I believe we are strange people the Bible says we are peculiar people kind of synonymous you can interchange them and say that maybe there's a difference so you are we have been called to be among extreme people speaking strange language you know and our language is strange it's strange to all the people because here we are we talk about adoption we talk about uh original saying we talk about uh serpent seed we talk about predestination and all that it's a strange language that we speak here and so God has called that to come among the people who speak this strange language so that we can also speak that string language everyone was called to be among those people say when you become a Christian you've got to separate yourself from your sinful Associates friends and can be relatives whatever who will not help you as long as you work with these people you cannot progress in your Christian Journey so you are to separate us so we including myself we are to separate ourselves from sinful Associates that's exactly right come out from among them my people be separate say the Lord it's a different walk it's an individual work it's a walk between you and God Alone and just you and he yes two can travel the road that you and he [Applause] so it's a different walk the call in our lives is a different walk it's you and God Alone no intermediary Hallelujah you know probably talks about Elisha when Elijah had his call the bible say that he banned the very tool that he was using to work right the ox and the the plow right he just banned the plow kill the ox and then just made a party or whatever for his friends so there was nothing for Elisha to look back to again everyone says that when we come to Christ we must break all the bridges behind us see bring all the bridges all the associates anything that will cause you to want to go back get rid of them that is what Elisha did because that call was so important in his life and I believe that the call of God in our lives must be so important more important than anything that we can think of in this life see because we will answer for our attitude toward the call of God in our lives each one of us will answer for himself you see something we can't hide behind anything we can't hide behind even this message no we will be given up we will be exposed see we'll be exposed so we have to be as true and sincere as possible no one's sin will be imposed on another your sins will not be imputed unto another because I say the soul destiny shall die Hallelujah we should let this thing register in our hearts that you are alone you are alone you are a lonely Traveler a lonely program we come together like we have done we will sing and shout and praise the Lord and worship together but remember that you are an individual God is dealing with you as an individual Hallelujah we we rejoice when we come to we are happy but then remember we are an individual we praise the Lord together we worship we are happy together individual regardless of the size of the church you can be a thousand it can be anything still you are an individual you stand alone you are one unit so you stand alone Hallelujah the prophet said questions and as I said it will be like me saying oh you judge now every one of you come in and be baptized here with water and we put you on the church membership we are all going to go together say why brother that's not the scripture that's not it oh we're all going together no that is not it that's not the scripture unless you are born again circumcise of the Holy Spirit I don't care how good you are what church you belong to how good your parents are right except you as an individual has been born again by the Holy Ghost you will never go in the rapture I am I am not quoting I'm not saying it is not my word it's a prophet that you believe that's the very delivering sign the circumcision yes yes and the circumcision is by the Holy Spirit something on Prison he said we should never presume it's a presumption or presuming is like venturing without Authority so as we follow the message we follow the word of God we serve the Lord let us not presume that all is well oh we are all going it is not it is not scripture presumption you suppose that something is the case on the basis of probability no it doesn't work that way to venture without Authority taking something for granted now that's something that the church must not do it we do not have to take things for granted I'm assuming I'm I hope I am one of them no it's not a hope it's not a matter of Hope be sure be certain Hallelujah that if it's even one person that is to make the Rapture in this congregation say Lord it must be me it's not about presuming it will not help us say we should not presume so in the family the father's sense won't be against the sons parents righteousness cannot cover the children the prophet says that God has no grandchildren so each each one must stand on his own ground hasn't got grandchildren so if I am a pastor whatever I do does not cover my children Hallelujah if I am that no I stand alone my wife stands alone my children stand alone each one will give account of himself because the Bible said in Matthew chapter 24 say that day two Souls be in bed won't be taking yeah one will be left two women are filled won't be taking the other will be left two women will be grinding while we taking one will be left you see so it shows that no matter the relationship you cannot your ticket will not be based on another man's a woman's ticket so we are all going to stand alone if you're a student in your school stand alone yes you're a worker wherever you are working stand alone let Christ be seen in you don't just join the masses because God has a call in your life you have God's call in your life Hallelujah whatever on the streets in a family wherever therefore we will all be tempted individually I have my Temptations you have yours to have your trials I have my I have my challenges you have yours so each one of us will go through our own trials challenges difficulties and all that yes yes they may be different but then as the Bible says all through the blood some through the fly some through the water some through the fire but all through the blood by then it's on individual basis Hallelujah we are it's only individual business problem we're talking about when Israel got to cut this burn here now is the time to test them it was an individual issue and so we also have a Kardashians well we are attempted where we are tried when we are tested individually we go to church each one of us we come with different maybe intentions or whatever but the basic thing is right it might be because we love God we don't come here to seek let me say to seek husbands and wives we don't come here because my job is I've lost my job well don't come here because for some time now I've been sick and all that those things are secondary we come here because we love God and we want to worship we want to save we want to live for him that is why we come together the other things he will take care of but that's not the primary thing that's not the reason why we meet here we meet us to serve him to worship him to love him to appreciate him like we always say let him have preeminence he must have preeminence the promise said until you become a prisoner to God God cannot use you that is having preeminence if you become a prisoner to him I mean he has preeminence in our life then the other things will follow yes our burdens are different everything that we go through we go through differently we might have similar issues but then you stand alone God will deal with you alone he will deal with me he'll deal with everyone alone so abiding different see you can think of a Jew one job has had this problem and um Mrs job was also kind of affected because now the home was not as comfortable as it used to be those days when everything was at her disposal she could Pride herself as Mrs Joe one thing became so difficult she was even ashamed to be Associated or identify with job so the point of time he said yo what are you doing just cancel that golden ninja says let's be free so you speak like a foolish woman see when things happen God will be waiting he'll be looking at our individual reactions [Music] to all the things that we go through he is able to Deliver Us from them all but then he looks at how you react towards that issue that problem [Music] and job's truth by the wife we know what happened same thing with Lord's wife you know as long as God was providing for them oh it was a nice thing when everything was Rosy at home they will go to church they will never be late one now things became to it began to be rough they began to have excuses why they were late why they couldn't come yesterday why this and that and that and that says a life that is full of excuses is not worthy of the Gospel [Music] you know God is watching us every act that we take away every move that we make God is watching us you know one trials and difficulties challenges come our way that's not the end of the world and again a prophet has told that you see when Temptations come if it is coming from the devil his aim is to flow us to put us down but when God tries us or put temptation of trial on us it is to strengthen us because he knows he knows that we cannot fall [Applause] but he brings us in just to test us and then to lift us up onto another level but you see you are a lonely pilgrim you are a lonely traveler trying to make it to heaven so let your life let our lives be clean myself let our lives portray him at all times in all situations in all try difficulties and everything let us project let us reflect him we shouldn't be like Joe's wife or Lord's wife will only be faithful to God when there's plenty one difficult times come then we we take vacation take a vacation in serving the lord but we don't take vacation in serving the lord we don't have to take vacation Hallelujah we don't even even testify only when God has done good things supposedly good things in our lives even when things are rough I believe we need to testify [Applause] I'm going through this but praise the Lord thank God I know he's he's on my side you see [Applause] and then God knows that my son or my daughter has so much trust in me despite all that is happening to him he's still praising me he's so thanking me see God has paid those things from us we shouldn't save him only when things are smooth when things are comfortable when we are not comfortable zone or Comfort zones no but in all situations even if he slay me so trust me maybe if it slays me I will still trust him I'll just depends also depend on him in the early spiritual experiences message see now the thing for every individual to find is his place in God what God has called you to do and then abide in that place amen abide in that place amen Amen Let us find out where God wants us to be and then let's abide in that place I was just thinking shortly that virgin we husbands and wives you know it's a Ministry it's a Ministry and God is expecting something from us because he types it to Christ in the church so if Christ had a Ministry and the church also has a Ministry then husband and wife you also have Ministries I always refer to Ephesians chapter 5 I mean sometimes I say it says husbands love your own wives as Christ loved his Chase he gave himself to him wives submit yourself unto your own husbands it is not a condition that wives if your husbands love you submit to them husbands if your wives submit love them [Music] no condition about that being alone [Applause] husband does not love you continue to submit to him if your word does not submit you continue to love her because you see we will give account of our stewardship [Music] [Applause] how we treat our wives how we treat our husbands it's your ministry it's my Ministry don't let it depend on so many factors no it doesn't depend on any Factor praise the Lord so husbands and wife God is watching us how we treat God's daughter how we treat God's son [Applause] over here the wives always serve the upper hand so you the the man you dare not do anything anyway let me let me leave it there Hallelujah like that should not be that should not be man is the head of the home whether you like it or not he didn't choose to be God placed him there [Applause] God said you should be submissive just do that be submissive respect your husband and God will bless you if you respect your heart and God will bless you you are a lonely pilgrim but you must be up to your task that your responsibilities because you are accountable to God no one will always stand with you on that day you will have to give account of your stewardship change God is watching us as individuals our attitude towards the message how do we react to it I believe there will not be hypocrites I will believe it as a test Hallelujah we're individuals and God is watching us say God is watching us I believe that we should also be grateful to our pastor Hallelujah because I'm not referring you back but you are here because you have to be here because he didn't want to be led astray Hallelujah that's why you are here and so be thankful to your pastor and always pray for him because he is a leader and why as long as you pray for him you appreciate him God will use him to bless you see and once again it's not everything that the pastor can do the prophet says something here it's not everything that a pastor can do the deacons can do the trust he can do guess a moment yes in a certain a sudden secret going away of the church yeah paragraph 381 he said you can't expect your pastor to do it all you can't expect your trustee ball to do it all or your Deacon board you've got to make yourself ready it's an individual affair and remember His coming is so sudden that the church will go in a twinkle of an eye and if we see sin on every hand and judgment pending in the battleship of ghosts wrath coming how can we escape this will do his best amen by uh no signing to declare unto you the whole Council of God that's all the person can do and pray for you but you as the student right the greater part it pays for you the teacher teaches you go home and you relax how can you pass your exams some don't it is true some don't even open their Bibles some don't read the message books they are so so dependent on the past time they come to church what they hear that is enough for another week that is not it you are an individual you are going you want to go to heaven but everything depends on you you are a lonely pilgrim the pastor he only gives the guidelines and the rice is yours see it erases yours if you depend on him you know whether one of these days list house will be closed one of these days we cannot meet like this one of these days it will be an individual basis so when we can't meet like this to hear the person to hear the song leader to hear this and that anyone left alone and these Bibles and message books are all taken away from us as I said the word let the word of God dwell in you richly so when you are on your own when you are alone what is in you will be enough for you we'll be able to see you through this life you are at filled a lonely program so let us be mindful as I said we can we all Rejoice we are happy to see one another but the fact Still Remains that you are an individual Hallelujah you are an individual and God is dealing with you as an individual and the prophet said God dealt with Israel as a nation but we Gentiles he is dealing with us as individuals Hallelujah [Music] we need to know where we are standing and what we are doing something then if he sends us from the Queen of Sheba if he sends the thing it is up it's up to the people to receive it or to reject it let me say the message whatever God has brought it is up to the people to receive it or to reject it and each one as an individual not because of your church standing not because the whole church believes it and so you follow it no you as an individual you make your decision it doesn't lay whether your church accepts it it's whether you accept it salvation is a personal work it's a personal faith not a universal church Faith but their personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ no matter if father don't believe and mother don't believe it's what you believe it's what you believe not what your parents believe and what you believe I believe some of our children were born in a message but it's high time their winds they win themselves amen so that your faith will not stand or will not be based on that of your parents but Lord you will have your personal revelation of your personal revelation otherwise my father my mother my father my uncle they brought me in they brought me you followed them and they realized that you you are Hollow there's nothing in you it's an individual issue amen Hallelujah when the church moved to Babylon like the Babylonian captivity some said how can we sing the Lord's song In a Strange Land how can we sing the songs of Zion in a Strange Land how can we practice Christianity in this country that is so corrupt how can we live different from the people you know the whole place is corrupt a place where I work everybody is doing that they are stealing they are falsifying things they are doing that and doing that I know America I see when you come here and you don't tell let's all lie you're being difficulty you can't make ends meet and so we end up turning little lies here false document here this and that my breathing these things ought not to be sold again if we lose if we gain these things and we lose our salvation oh you see that's for this one the Lord understands he does not understand anything [Music] you're going to stand alone before God yes it's for this you see if I hadn't done this ah you trouble go into that trouble be true be faithful go into that room and God will bring you out [Applause] even if he does not bring you out out this is not the end of life better life awaits you if you stand true it's one of the three Hebrew children did and that is why they are always remembered amen they didn't meet together they didn't meet together to decide not to obey the King's Command no they took individual decisions they took individual decisions said I am going through Jesus I'm going through I'll pay the price whatever others do I'll take the way with the Lord despise you that was measure's song and then maybe I bet never was coming my Jesus bear the cross alone and all that will go free no there's a cross for me and there's a cross for you each one came with his own song with his own conviction [Music] [Applause] and who is that the third person I've forgotten the names Shadrach Shadrach said oh I know whom I have believed and I am persuaded that he's able to keep that what he has committed to me which I have committed unto him against my day so they all come with it came with their individual convictions a purpose in their heart not to be there were other Jews there when they they were afraid to sing the Lost song the song of Zion in a Strange Land we are in captivity you see God himself understands you know let's bow to this image God know that if we're not under conclusion we wouldn't bow but God knows let's bow Hallelujah this truth because they knew that they were accountable they were personally I mean liable to God so they allow God to lead them and prophecy in message pattern he said I get among Christians sometimes who claim to be scented men and women of God they are ashamed of a testimony they are ashamed to say Amen they're ashamed to sing the songs of Zion they are ashamed everywhere I like to get among people who as not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ though it seems like heresy but yet they are not ashamed something has happened and it means more than life to them it is life life eternal because they have accepted God substitute Hallelujah we don't have to say when we go to room do what the Romans do no once a Christian always a Christian if I'm a Christian in Ghana I come here it must continue where Christian wherever you came from a story that didn't change the story there's no change we are supposed to be in the wholeness of holies Hallelujah no those in the outer Court we know what happens there Hallelujah the atmosphere is unpredictable [Applause] today is so Sunny the next moment it becomes cloudy and then another time the rains begin Hallelujah so those in the outer Court their lives are unpredictable how can you be there and call yourself a message you know honestly let me let me be honest with you amen let me be honest with you amen there are certain behaviors and characters and attitudes when I see among believers among Believers and yes on my head my heart bleeds how can you claim to to believe this message be and and be be in that condition it worries me honestly [Applause] if you are going to be on the in the outer Court then I'm afraid it's getting late because I'm going to raise your character changes your mood changes when it's sunny your mood changes when it is this your move changes Hallelujah I say in the inner Court the lights are there but they are not perpetual the light can go off anytime because men lightness this works but when you get to the innermost his Shekinah Glory it's a kind of presence Hallelujah even if you are dead there is life there Hallelujah [Music] the manner that was kept there never got bad aeron's rule that was just a dry stick by a day because it was in the presence of God yo that light never goes off it is a Perpetual light and so it will not affect your life I mean your life will not be up and down drawing some growth graph Hallelujah [Music] it should not be that that's why you are in the Holiness of holies when you want his presence your life will be the same your life will be so sweet you're a lonely pilgrim try to make it to heaven all of us and then we must we must never forget always remember not you are walking alone you and you alone let your let your life reflect him he says I see I believe not only in my presence but more so in my absence you know Christian when we get to places where nobody is observing us well there's no there's no brother no sister ah we change yes your true colors come out but what we know that oh in this neighborhood hey maybe maybe when as I'm going to I may meet somebody I may meet a brother or sister you are careful but when you go to a place where you are sure nobody will meet nobody there God is there [Applause] he is the Unseen eye watching you he is unseen here hearing every conversation [Applause] so be careful of yourself I say Where can I say there's no difference between in the sight of God there's no difference between Darkness and Light because why I think I've gone into the best or the the the the the darkest place oh that's why you will see me more when I I run into the deep seas oh he will surely see me he'll find me out we cannot hide ourselves from me from him if we know these things and we don't forget it will check our lives wherever we go anything that we are doing is even even our thoughts he knows them our thoughts are so plain to you before him say we are lonely pregnant we are running we can't run from him we're just trying to make it to heaven you know Abraham once was just closing Abraham was once asked to sacrifice Isaac and to my surprise you know Abraham never told even Sarah is there a wife oh Sarah maybe this is what the Lord has told me just imagine the the reaction of Sarah my only son my face am I that Sarah would have been a stumbling block because that Vision or that message didn't come to Sarah it came to Abraham it was Abraham who had that message so he wouldn't allow anyone to distract him from believing that message and acting upon that message [Applause] have you heard from God oh somebody told you a message [Music] if you have heard from God like Abraham heard from God and didn't want any destruction but to go ahead and do what was commanded him if we have heard from God will not allow anything to distract us you know one Soul had this convention we know the story of Soul when he became Paul and he said when he hit when he had his his experience he said immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood he didn't go Consulting people what do you think what's your opinion what is this no he heard from Jesus he said I am Jesus if this message had been revealed to you know one thing is that the message is real though but you it must be revealed to you as an individual and so if it is revealed to you as an individual at all you need no other argument you need no other please Hallelujah you go ahead and do just what the message says do we just live for him he has called us Hallelujah we have to live for gold all the days of our lives we have to stand for him we have to be faithful in this call the last thing Joseph we know the story of Joseph when Potiphar's wife was trying to live him just soon as the point that he was caught a face shirt and then run away Joseph had allowed it nobody would have known about it but God will have known about it to have had pleasure maybe that would have even promoted him more in potipe's house but because he ran away he said I Fear God I can't do that nobody is here watching me but I know my God Is Watching Me [Applause] these two and because he did that he had a better promotion you know we don't know what God has himself for you a little compromise will take you up the favor of God from you but if we're able to stand amen the word of God says it I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God I cannot do that I cannot betray my God tell us individual God will take care of the rest Hallelujah God will take care of it I don't care how rotten the world is how rotten our country is our nation our people but we are not interested in prayer meetings anymore we've got so many things we have to do so we think oh say what we need today is a calling together a getting a getting together getting ready and not depending on the preacher as I said but you as an individual before God make yourself ready for the coming of the Lord to escape all this corruption no matter what they call you and what action they take that doesn't change God one minute God will do it just the same he is depending and waiting on science are appearing Jesus is coming and great Oneness are being done every mild post is pointing towards his soon appearing and it will happen in a moment how are we standing this day he said this morning but this is evening how are we stand this evening as we take inventory if we should support we should be spoken to this time and the Lord Jesus should descend from um from the heavens this time with a shout and the Trump of God will we be found ready as a church body will we be found ready as an individual to join with those that are raised from the dead who have proven themselves already no matter whether we are ready or not the Lord Jesus will come just the same at the appointed time we must be ready and we must do it now it is no time to wait we must redeem the time and be ready amen amen you are a pilgrim but you are walking alone you want to make Heaven all by yourself I want to make Heaven All By Myself he has told us this we are walking our work should be with Jesus and him alone no intermediary no Consulting hearing there let God and him alone lead us amen amen there is this song I don't know whether it's familiar I am resolved no longer to linger I am resolved no longer tilling I don't know how you sing it is it familiar okay and I think we will foreign I am resolved I don't know all the ways I got too late things [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Jesus Christ [Music] thank you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I will promise [Music] I know I know where always [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] everything inside [Music] go ahead sorry I can't keep up with the song but we'll pick it up later amen let's give the Lord a big clap of amen what a great message amen you know how many have listened to Discerning of the spirit the message discern the spirit Yeah because sometimes it's easy to get in trouble with God when we don't discern the spirit of the Lord but I'm gonna give you a short example if you've done something at home and nobody knows about it and you come here and the minister preaches exactly what you have done without him being at home with you it is not a man it is God that is talking to you and you should be even afraid to say one thing against it because if that Minister doesn't know what he's saying and he said it if you attack it you are attacking the word of God that has been quickened by the Holy Spirit it will cost you something and never do that amen God spoke You Know Who You Are we all are called here to be individual they are people that are saying scripture about Philippians 2 12 exactly the same scripture that God spoke here I have my Lane I'm a pastor you have your name you keep your lane and do what God sent you to do amen amen if you're a song leader stay in your lane and be the best song leader that you can if you're a backup singer stay on your lane do the best that you can if you're sitting in the congregation stay in your lane if you're a husband stay in your lane your wife stay in your lane children stay in your lane because you will be accountable for what you're doing amen what what the and the worst thing is if a husband does something wrong we have wife that cannot stand and say what you did is wrong they just tally together but brother Branham say ananias and Safari is coming back you will both die amen if your wife did something wrong amen don't join that sin because both of you can fall dead because you cooperate to keep whatever you want to do together so remember I'm not gonna die with you if you've done something wrong you are individual amen amen you are individual one of this day you're gonna answer before God as individual whatever you do in school God sees you that's why God is speaking here whatever you do alone God is seeing you that's what God is doing here whatever you put up first before God whatever excuses you're doing whatever you are neglecting maybe reading the scripture reading the Bible or maybe listening to the message or you don't come to church the way you're supposed to be or uh question and answer don't even matter to you whatever you're doing that's between you and God I guarantee you and I promise to you not when I will face Jesus Christ I will have none of your blood over my hand none of your blood amen whether you're mad whether you're not happy I'm gonna speak I'm gonna preach because what I'm saying here is coming from the scripture and from the message of the hour as long as I deliver that I am free from your blood it is up to you to take like the the brother say we are student we come to church we listen to this you need to go home and do your homework you need to open the Bible you need to pray you need to to to to stay with the Lord and doing things yourself wake up your own salvation with fear and trembling because one of this day you're gonna answer for yourself your friend will not answer for you amen your children and sometimes are fearful children and and I and I and I'm bleeding for them because sometimes they don't have a choice because they're depending on the parent if the parent don't want to come to church the children are stuck at home if the parent move the children have to be forced to move because not because they want to move because the parent don't want to move and sometimes they are trapped in those kind of situations why that's why brother Branham say it's not the delinquency of the children it comes from the parent parents look at what we're doing remember who you are you are individual make sure your relationship between you and Jesus Christ nothing interfere give God the first place he will add everything unto thee if you give him the first place amen you are alone do the best that you can on your side don't wait for the other one to do something then you're going to react no you do your part and let God take care of the remaining amen what a wonderful message amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord once again tonight we really appreciate you father and we thank you for speaking to us and reminding us insisting into the holiest father whoever is still outside the Tabernacle whoever is still lingering in the other court whoever is in the holiest that is still after the people Lord may you be merciful to them tonight father may you give a personal revelation father whatever Bridges that we have not burned and these bridges are not only natural

you help them pass all the way to the holiest where the presence of the Lord is there and where it's Joy regardless of what is going on on the outside father may you strengthen brother Samuel maybe sometime people don't understand what a man is facing and what he's going through Lord father you took his wife home but he's still standing for your gospel and he's still pushing moving forward Lord father remember him and continue to give him strength Lord father to carry his duty all the way until we meet you into the air Lord father protect your children Lord as they go into their respective Place may you keep us all consecrated and may father you bring your children into a time of meditation where they can examine their life and compare it not with their neighbor not with the husband not with the wife but compare their life individually with the word to make sure that they're standing on good ground and they can make it to the Rapture Lord and if they find out by the enlightening of the holy spirit that the nurse where they're supposed to be father give them strength and Grace to move forward to reach the level that you want them to be Lord father touch those that are sick tonight those that are afflicted that have a specific need that has been bothering them that is causing causing trouble in the life that is stirring the entire Lord house father may you give solution may you be merciful to your children where else can we go to find solution for our problem because you're the god that careth you the god that is responsible for us father our veil has been taken off and we've laid upon your shoulder because you are our husband you are the head Lord father so therefore help each one of us Lord father to move closer than what we were before Lord protect us on the road Lord and if that Terry may we meet again here father to worship you in the spirit and in the truth we commit Lord father the Young's men meaning unto their hand on Saturday father may you come
