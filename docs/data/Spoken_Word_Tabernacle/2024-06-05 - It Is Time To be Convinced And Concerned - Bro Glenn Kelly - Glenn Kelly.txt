here I'm not worthy I don't know why they always want this spare tired to come up here right but that's okay you got some young soldiers coming up don't we okay we got some young soldiers on the ride so we keep them in prayer is that right so all hearts and mind are clear let us go to um Luke 9 go to Luke Luke 9 it was a scripture this I kind of got the inspiration of uh from you know and let's look at the two scriptures here uh Luke 9 and 5 55 and 56 once you have it say Amen we know here the Holy Spirit kind of touched on it is showing about the spirit of Elijah and the spirit that the Lord have have here in our hour is that right so he says but he turned and rebuked them and said ye know not what manner of spirit that ye are for the son of man is not come to destroy men's life but to save them may the Lord add a blessing through the reading of his word you may be seated okay and um here our little topic was was on our heart we know brother brand ministered on the uh concerned and convinced concerned and convinced you know that's where we kind of got the in Inspiration some from that it's time for us to be concerned we see all the signs around us that the Lord is able to come anytime now is that right so we're going to look at some things that's why I just wanted to get into the word I guess you get a few extra minutes I had started my time yet so so I'm going to go ahead and start it now Hallelujah y'all just pray with me because uh you know the Lord been just doing some great things and we'll get a chance to share a little testimonies with you by the grace of God and what the Lord has been just doing for us while we're out there some of you wonder why you don't see brother Kelly I love to be in my Amen Corner back there you know I like to be back there so I can get fed is that right I was stirred up is that right brother C but you know I saw your mother you know when he coming there is that right huh huh we're going to hit that critical demon is that right when you come that far and come in the presence of God why wouldn't you dance why wouldn't you shout why wouldn't you praise him she was in his presence huh this is not a show huh huh huh what did he say the same spirit that I saw on low and Unice I seen on her son is that right huh huh coming in the presence of God huh like brother Michael say are you happy huh let's see your smiles in is that right huh you going to bust the devil in the head tonight is that right we going to show you who you are by the grace of God you know you got to pray with me because see I've been running in the institution I've been running this series about the statute of the perfect man you know brother Steve I got my the ages in the seals is coming in you know the lord gave wisdom how to get them in there is that right so when God give you wisdom to put that in there what did he say we got to go deep sea fishing right and they cannot go deep sea fishing they got to have their ages and they got to have their seal is that right we're going to show you now we're going to hit some hard demons tonight we getting ready to blast some devils that's raised in this message and God by the prophet of God in the end time will show you them spirits that we're fighting against is that right you cannot wrest we don't wrestle against flesh and blood we wrestle against principalities in powers in wickedness in rulers in high places is that right but we got the word is that right is what we say this bride she will not be defeated is that right I don't want to get ahead of myself if you convinced then you're concerned is that right and that's why we're talking about in this hour here now we're not going to lose not a one not your father not your mother not your sister not your brother not your daughter not your son no one will we [Applause] lose huh that's why you got trouble in the message they don't want the seals you don't want the ages well how you going to rap you out of here huh huh brother brandom he turned around and he told him remember he preached the search ages he ran the series on the seven Church ages is that right and then the Holy Ghost stopped them I'mma slow down brother Mickey I'mma do my best brother Mickey he got around there right when he got over there and they stopped him right and the Holy Ghost said you got to preach the stature of a perfect man is that right because the stature of the perfect man came between the ages and the seal is that right because we know there's no way that you can the Capstone can come down on you without the character of Christ being worked up through you [Applause] that's the reason why we had to I was working with them bringing them along slowly but it's been years now you know what brother it's time for me to be concerned uh is that right if we convinced that I'm concerned uh that they need to get this rapturing grace of message that's the only thing is going to get them out of here is that right Hallelujah we going to bust him Pastor I'm having a good time with what the Lord is feeding us with is that right let's look at he said now when you convinced yes sir convince is to bring to belief by argument and evidence that's why the prophet of God said we have to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints is that right huh huh huh we going to stop them stop them all religious demons coming at us thinking that we're fighting we're not fussing against our brother we're wrestling against flesh and blood is that right uhhuh every good gift comes from God is that right God says that you got to have the latter Reign and the former Reign you got to have the Dynamics and you got to have the mechanics and you cannot that's why on a on a dispens when Jesus came and he started his ministry the first thing he did he started teaching them is that right they called the Beatitudes but he said now what our brother Aaron was working with he come in the volume of the book uh we come of everything if it's a Bible question it's a Bible answer is that right no demon forces your body is not for demon forces your body is not for sicknesses your body is not for illnesses Jesus said that we are the Temple of the most high God huh I have no use for is that right sure we on this side we know we going to go through things is that right but it's your attitude towards something when the devil or the doctor says something to you it's your attitude how you accept what he said uh anything that try to exalt itself against the promise of God I though have to accept that this is the Living God uh we're demonstrating this is the resurrected Christ is that right he's not dead He's Alive is that right where's the miracle huh huh where's the Miracles uhhuh where's the Miracles is that right a change life let bear with me I know where I'm at Hallelujah can I preach just like I'm in out there I'm just old common simple preacher is that right Hallelujah huh I got to stick away God I share you some of the testimonies if God give me Grace convince yes sir he said now to bring to belief by argument or evidence is that right when Peter went up there is that right when Peter when he first started out uh when you saw Peter he would probably he would cuss uh he would swear he had a temper is that right but Peter had a sea deep down inside of him that God was going to use him is that right he was going to take that nature but still use that nature but he was going to use Lo it for the kingdom of God is that right when Peter first started out the Lord told him is that right that he was going to do what he was going to deny me three times is that right but uh Peter knew he was with the Lord he walked with the Lord but Peter was convinced is that right when he told Peter to do what cast that net is that right Peter cast that net he said well he said it I'm going to cast it cast The Net to the deep is that right we bringing what is he teaching me he's teaching us to be Fishers of Men is that right if he came and if he came and he showed us that we have to be what on the son of man Ministry is that right now the son of man Ministry I won't go into the other portion of it it was going to the Jews but he was showing the Jews what was going to happen when the two witnesses come too is that right right on have time I let the pastor deal with that we just hitting the surface on some things to bring you up now cuz that's going in you're looking that six seal is that right it tells you about that so what we're talking about here now is Peter being what convinced is that right once Peter was convinced Peter saw the Supernatural is that right when he saw the supernatural when we throw the gospel net he said he was going to teach us how to be fish of men so when I go out I got to find out where the fish is is that right and the wisdom don't come from God but God has taught me why by the grace of God first P second P third PO is that right you got to learn out of fish but we look but we're fishing in the Deep because we about to get out of here is that right it's time to go is that right so we have to understand he told him to go to the Deep so when Peter saw the miraculous then Peter knew now I'm going to follow him because this is the Messiah that is here come on Earth that we've been waiting for hallelujah hallelujah what about us today are you convinced huh are you convinced huh are you convinced are you convinced huh are you convinced uh now let me tell you something God said I do nothing unless I reveal it first to the servant the prophet is that right Peter knew the Messiah was on the earth is that right when the Seven Seals came open Holy Ghost form the Messiah is back on the Earth again that's right that's right does thou believe it yes huh how you going to have just a pillar of Fire how you going to have just a pillar of fire huh that's not all the word that's not all the word Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelations 10:7 Ah that's right tell me we are worshiping an idol huh we're in a war a real war a spiritual war they can kill the messenger they could kill the message too but you can't Kill the Messenger because the messenger was sent from [Applause] God huh let me tell you something you got to know who you are where you come from and what God sent you to do you know we going to show you them Sons Sons of a prophet in a minute too it ain't the pastor do it's the anointing of this age that's hitting every demon that is not part of the full revelation of the word we getting somewhere huh you know I don't have no problem they get around there I appreciate brother Brandon I know brother Brandon was but but Jeremiah 9:29 say the hidden things belong to who God but once it's unveiled it's who ah huh what did the what did the brother say where's the wels Revival huh he said where is the wel Revival he said you're looking at him huh you're looking at him huh you're looking at [Applause] him M now huh it belongs to me Christ and I have become one [Music] right no good is that right I have no use for him convince and concern yes sir we're talking about when God brought a word that's right brother when God brought the word and his hour here now he unfold he gave us the best he can give us was himself ah why because you're his bride is that right I'm not worthy to stand here before you but the worthy one has made me [Music] [Applause] worthy I'm standing in the place of Jesus Christ you're standing in the place of Jesus Christ ah we going to get somewhere in a minute help me Lord I'm having a good time up here you know you don't know that Rascal been fighting me for about a month right now is that right but I'm telling you why souls are getting baptized souls are getting saved souls are being repented Souls is coming back home that's why you don't like it we ain't finished yet we ain't finished yet we're not going to lose not one don't worry about your loved one they're coming in [Applause] [Music] huh help me Lord look what he say he said now convinced cuz I'm going get back to Peter he said convinced caus to it's caused to believe with certainty when you you are convinced there are no doubt no doubt am no doubt amen because it's finished this is a finished work God right everything that was in God he poured in Christ everything was in Christ he poured in the church is that right we're sitting under the seventh Covenant Angel Ministry fill every blank from where from Paul huh Iran is from colus for Martin Luther westle even the Pentecost now we got it all we got it all huh you let the devil come near this huh let him come near this with a faith hand we're going to look at a few of our brothers in a minute look what he says sir certainty with no doubt doubt now you're being concerned right now once you're concerned is to have an effect on and when you're concern is to have an effect on you still with me is that right remember he says be of interest or importance to you it's of interest it's important to you you see what then it comes what it's a problem that concerns all of us we're talking about now is nothing greater than a change life is that right that's right there's nothing greater than God this is the whole Plan of Redemption right the Adam and the Eve that fell in the garden up there see this Eve this bride will not fall this time is that right there no weapons formed against us shall prosperous God said I shall restore with the pmer worm the cankerworm the calip pillar the Locust have eaten up is that right all those religious demons Catholic Baptist Methodist Luther not the people those leaders that's deceiving the people knowing that this gospel that we're preaching is the truth is that right it's the whole truth look what he says Peter let's go to Acts chapter 2 let's look at Peter Peter was what Peter was convinced and once Peter become convinced I'm just I'm just dropping where it when it come one point I want to get to it's a little longer on that one but I got to speak these as the Holy Spirit drop it in my Spirit yes sir once you convinced you're concerned when you get around and you're not going to sit still there's no way you can sit still all this word we're getting is like fire shut up in my bones is that right that's what Jeremiah was saying we can't help it because Revelation brings stimulation is that right huh you can't put Revelation you can't put new wine in an old bottle isn't that right that's right it will bust brother so a man got to understand you got to be what Born Again of the water and of the spirit it got to be a word that come and Quicken down in your soul is that right we're talking about being fisher of men we're all Fishers of Men is that right this is the Plan of Redemption God we are concern we're sighing and crying for the condition of the land is that right we know that God is soon to return is that right they got that fifth heer without a spot or a blemish I you got to understand I heard a a pastor say go look at go listen to the message the water of separation is that right it's the watching of the water of the word uh people are leaving it's the word it has nothing to do with him it's the word they have issues with it's the word that's doing the separating he gives us his merciful but but then when Jesus he had the multitudes is that right when the multitudes followed him and when the multitudes follow him then all of a sudden disciples said send them on their way said no they came this far we give them a little taste is that right and then one day Jesus said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part of me huh all of a sudden he come around and there where are you at and questions and ANW you need to pray read your Bible in the morning read your Bible at night you need to church whoa wait a minute that's a little too [Laughter] [Music] hard Hallelujah anyhow I'm enjoying myself up here huh when you get around in there look what he says look at Peter let's go over to verse 14 you know the story Peter and them went up into the upper room is that right for Peter and them to be a witness over in Acts chapter one uh they told him to go there to Jerusalem right Galilee but he didn't tell them to go into the upper room brother brandham said they went there because the Jews was going to kill him he said they was afraid that they were going to kill him so they went up there it's showing you how rough these religious demons are is that right and nothing to play with so we know about we know about those demons out there the the religious demons that's part of the organization the denominational organization but before we get finished here we're going to show you them right here and that's right you got three got three Spirits we're dealing with huah we got three Spirits you dealing with is that right we got the Holy Spirit you got a Pentecostal spirit and you got the prophet of the God's spirit the prophets of God's spirit you'll see huh Holy Spirit we watch what we say here and see if not it's there is that right you got to understand what you're wrestling against you're wrestling against what David said we went in the sweet we came in the house of the Lord together we took counsel together we praised the Lord together he said it was one of my enemies what I would have B I would have prepare myself is that right he said it was one of my own gos I got stripped to the back what he say quote scripture huh like he said I have to hide and tell you where I'm getting it from I may not have a screen I don't mind telling you where I'm getting it from searching Paul said if any Angel come from Heaven preach any other gospel except for the one that I laid down he said let it be a what a curse including himself is that right he said is that right what the holy spirit said brother they coming in around in there preaching not only another gospel they want to preach another Christ they want to preach another Jesus uh and another Jesus that come along with that other Jesus is another spirit that comes behind that Jesus so you got to understand the spirit that's behind what they're trying to bring in but God says everything that's hidden I'm going to uncover it God said was every was ever Buri I'm going to root it up is that's what God said is that right Peter now Peter was convinced he was concerned yes sir now after Peter became convinced he went and start ministering the gospel look what he said Peter but standing up with the who the 11 I'm at verse 14 Acts 2 and4 lift up his voice and said unto them ye men and all ye that dwell at where Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my what word words for these are not drunk and you suppose seeing it but the what the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by who the prophet Joel is that right he knew that the spirit was going to come they was expecting for that Spirit to come so once he's seen it come according to the scriptures Peter was now become concerned not for himself is that right he start being concerned for who for Jerusalem for Israel for the people the ones that was out there that was lost we are now being concerned for the sin sick world is that right people that's being bound up uh we love our Brethren we're not wrestling against brethren we wrestling against the spirit that's behind that some of you don't understand is that right you got to understand it's a spirit it's a manipulating spirit that you have to be careful of and what it does it'll enter in through murmuring through complaining through reasoning that's right uhhuh doubting that's right he said he was clean they got Justified they got Sanctified but then they did what the devil went about

realize Hallelujah you see you got to understand you get a spiritual way and it's a natural way is that right you know what I tell them brothers if you I tell them brother you know brother brandom said 90% of the men locked up in the institution is over or by a unsaved woman most of in there is in know two institutions so I try to tell them look bro you got to go to Ephesians 5 you got to get straight first you got to get born again bro and once you get born again bro God is obligated to bring her in line is that right so God is going to bring her to in line so you got to understand that bro if she ain't going to listen to God she ain't going to listen to [Music] [Applause] you I don't know why we going this way but I better stay here for a while and then you men you jelly back men that let a woman run your [Music] household huh you going to have trouble man you going to have trouble Man sir h Huh you tell us old man you to tell us I can do bad by myself uh is that right let it hit you if you don't want to abide by the word of God you know what let the door hit you right here is that right because I don't have no time for no foolishness you look in there bad women man I tell my son that boy don't bring him to my house is that right there types of bad church is that right you got you got harlots the Bible says uh she looks through through the cment of her windows and when she look through the cment of her Windows she see that you are void of understanding is that right and she lay that drapery that's right brother she's plotting to pull you in is that right so they have to understand uh if she first you got to lead her to Christ uh by your life is that right if you're not living the life she going to say she going to tell you how in the world you expect me to follow you your God if you ain't following your God your God can't keep you what makes you think your God going to keep me huh so Little Women he's trying to tell your young sister something huh you see where the Holy Spirit come see where he's been at he won't let the pastor move yet he's trying to bring you up in something is that right oh yeah hallelujah thank you Jesus you know the word God's unfolding the word to you but you know what you have struggling with your hygiene you have struggling with your clothes uh you have struggling with keeping your house up uh you have struggling with your glory you have struggling with those things is that right he's trying to bring you into something is that right we don't know it we don't know what it is but the Holy Ghost knows what it is I don't know what it is but the Holy Ghost knows what it is you are not a silly woman you are the Bride of Jesus Christ and he's dressing you with the word uh when you will be without a spot uh without a blemish without such you will be that way before he come ain't that what he said H that woman really see that woman that was in Chicago that was out there washing the pots in the back is that right but when we come in there all those sisters we I heard the Holy Spirit tell them they get around in there you get on that YouTube you better watch it out there on that YouTube too somebody will watch you at a wedding reception or party or something and they'll splice it on you and make it look like you're doing something that you ain't doing huh we're talking about the foolishness that's going on in this hour here right now is that right that's what we're trying to bring you in the the Holy Spirit trying to make you realize one day he's going to get in Tradition tradition is a terrible thing is that right is really is uh you got to realize what God is bringing us to he's going to shape Us by his word why because the word the bride loves the word she loves to be corrected by the word uh the word cannot offend the word uh it only you see it only could bring you closer and show you who you really are is that right the devil thought he had us he thought he had us in drinking he thought he had us in smoking he thought it had us in drugging he thought he had us in stealing he thought he had him in pornography he thought he had him in all these things but then one day you heard an eagle cry Hallelujah you heard from your theophany is that right they say the prodal son when he was out there in the world the prodal son he was there is that right then the Bible says that he finally came what unto himself is that right he recognized that inner man that Paul was talking about over there in Romans 7 we got body we got Spirit we got soul is that right we got that glorified my body that we bypass that was in Heaven is that right we're just people we're of Eternity we're just people experiencing time that's all we're doing we're getting back to where we originally come from we come from God we're going back to God H we are the supernatural being is that right he said put on the whole Armor of God is that right the natural the helmet of salvation what did he say in that message that's the outside we got an outer Bible and we got an inner Bible have we going to get to that in a minute you see that's what he's saying helmet of salvation breastplate of righteousness the preparation of the gospel of peace upon your feet The Shield of Faith uh but now we got a super we got a supernatural arm love uh peace uh Joy longsuffering tender heart ain't that what he saw on Moses On The Backs side when he saw Moses saw God walk past him on the backs side he saw him like a man but he saw a supernatural and anointing on him is that right these are Supernatural characteristics explained to me love show me longsuffering show me tenderhearted show me mercy that's what this bride is made of that's right you're the super that's why you love the supernatural that's why you love it that's why you love Revelation you might as well stop they were looking for a point for him to stop no no no no no no no no when them seals was open it keep unfolding it keep unfolding it keep unfolding it keep peeling off let me keep reading in Timothy we're showing you what you're fighting against Hallelujah help me Lord he at Timothy look what he says he says verse six for this sort are they which creep into the houses and leave captive silly women Laden with sins LED away with what div lust ever what learning and never able to come into the what now let's pause that that's what he was talking about in Hebrews when brother brand preached that work that in Hebrews he was saying it says had a intellectual conception of the message they got an intellectual conception of the word they never moved on to get the power was to get the Holy Ghost is that right that's why you had Ruth when she decided is that right once you make a decision on something always think think of the good you done made the decision look and think about the good of it all things work together for the good who them that love the Lord and call for what for his purpose is that right for His Glory Hallelujah look what he says here now this where we want this where we want to get to he says now as who James and jarine with stood who Moses so do these also resist the what the truth men of corrupt what minds and reprobate concerning the what see confering the faith they came at Moses they came James and jamine came with MOS with sorcery they came with in enchantments uh they come in these things you got to be getting ready to bust the devil in the head I'mma tell you how to get them right God know you and you know you God know you you know you when you're praying and then all of a sudden a certain Spirit coming at you you bind it up send it right back to where it come from we're teaching you how to fight with the word is that right you don't accept nothing opposite of the word is that right certain demon forces you know when we was on the street if a guy locked the man up if he got locked up or if he got killed or whatever first thing we knew now that wasn't his M Mo that's that's right something done happened here that wasn't his Mo nah he was just a pimp you know that's all he was y'all got to understand I just use my terminal I grew up on the concrete jungle okay okay in the Bible they told them you know he he he he there was and prostitute and things back in that time right now the women so gang banging they don't need no pimps so you got to get around in there now the person got to realize right yeah see I see I got to share these kind of things with these men in the institutions because this is what they're familiar with that's their lives and if you got to be able to reach and fill their infirmities is that right or it's going to go over their heads is that right is a totally different way they Ministry so you got to understand is that right what how the devil is coming at you you got to understand his tactics because the Lord said I will not have you ignorant to Satan devices so they going to come at us with the same word that we got that's why I said you got the Holy Ghost you got the you got Pentecost and you got the spirit of the sons of the Prophet we're going to show you we now some of you looking at me huh huh the pastor already the pastor already gave us a deeper Revelation on this this here might be a little long I was trying to save this to last but but y'all keep it keep pulling on it this is a witness in the witness 4553 4553 we're going to take it we're going to show you because remember you got to go back to the message that the lord gave the pastor part 27 open and sealed evidence he called it open and sealed evidence he came out of Second Kings 2 and 1 and he was showing you the the spirit that was on the sons of the prophets you got to know what kind of spirits that you're fighting you understand that's why in our time they say when Muhammad Ali he was he was the greatest of whatever his time why because he understood the times he was in and he understood his opponents you got to understand we're in we got 200 million demons loosed out here now is that right and that's why you got to realize what you're up against now is that right so you have to see look at this here and when it when thank you Jesus when Ali was in his time H I'm not promoting price fighting but when he was in his time he had different opponents is that right so when he got over there and he had to fight George Foreman of one of them he trained the different way okay he had to train more as a slugger is that right but when he but when he fought against Joe Fraser he had to train different in his training camp he had to train to throw to 15 to 120 pounds of around backing up backing up backing up backing up because Joe took it to him you see Joe took it to him Jo took it to him Joe took it to him so was a different fight when it came to Joe Fraser Joe knew he was going to get hit but you know you going to get Affliction on your body you know you might get an illness you know you might get a sickness but you can look at it and say greater is he that is in thee than he that is in the world so you you got to understand you got 220 some demons 220 million demons loose now and these all these demons loose but they got to understand they're hiding in religion yes they and that's why some oh you know we get around here why the musicians have to do this this this you got to understand the first ones that were sent out are the s you s out there and when you s out there you're now you're anointed you're prayed up you come and you have to realize your position and when you're in that position you got to understand what God put you there that's why the holy spirit said David he was anointed to drive away Spirits you see Pentecostal got to trying to drum things up because when they first came then they used to be prayed Up and Under The anointing and people used to get slayed in the worship service they got delivered in the worship service we don't want denominational don't bring me that Evolution stuff out there on the uh radio uh uh or what YouTube you bring that foolishness up in here you you ain't driving no demon forces away with that kind of music you just entertaining the flesh we're trying to bring you something so you can get and you can understand the battle that you're really in is that right you're not just National you're International you got all kind of demon forces watching you seeing where you're weak at that's why I was talking about Al there and he knew see when Jo if you were priz fighting Bop if you can hit a man with a jabber you can hit him with any punch okay so you know if he Bob that head you couldn't hit it and the devil know if he see one of you out of order is that right he can start a little Le a Le a whole L is that right is that right we got to realize this we going in this here huh we're in a real war and when you're in a war you're being trained you're not being trained by anyone you're being trained by the best is that right you're being trained by the unadulterated word is that right so you got to realize God is Raising you up God is raising them brothers up God is Raising you everybody's being trained for a work is that right look what he says here Witness he said 4553 4553 now we know when they came to gilgal over in uh Second Kings it was uh chapter uh two over in second Kings chapter 2 we know when they came over to uh uh gilgal Elijah I mean Elijah was about the Rapture out of here okay we know that we ought to be concerned because we know the prophet of God told us Israel is our time piece is that right if Israel being our time piece then we know this Rapture can take place anytime is that right so we know we're soon going home we're soon out of here so we should now be concerned once you convinced you concerned now because where you're at is the right place God is warning us before anything happen we're not concerned about a bomb we're not concerned about those things falling on us is that blowing us to bits or whatever but you got to understand Israel knew that they was going to have a battle going there with hus is that right because hmon operated operate according to that law Old Testament they dug tunnels like ants is that right they put ants in there so they had to be I mean they was moving like ants so they had to be wise approaching them is that right let me get let me keep going I want to get as far as I can on this by the grace of God look what we say paragraph 199 he said then he started from where at gilgal huh he started from gilgal and he went on to the school of the what prophets and I want you to notice when he got up there at the school of the prophets he said the Lord is leading me to Jordan now he had to start moving he getting ready to leave God was moving him God is moving us we getting ready to get out of here he said now look he said three stages that Elisha followed Elijah he said and Elijah was a type of Christ Elijah Elisha the type of the church he says I go up to gilgal first gilgal was a type of justification the prophet of God Ministry was first poor second P third PO is that right bear with me keep your spiritual caps on three stages that Elicia followed Elijah he says and Elijah was a type of Christ he says now justification by faith that's what gilgal typed gilgal was justification by by by faith and then now you say here to the church Elijah and Elsia The Young and the old Prophet a type of Christ and the church he says he says as as your soul liveth not I'll stay here but I'm going with you he says and he went up to where gilgal he says and when he got up there he said now you stay here the Lord is calling me up to the school of the prophets he says and he said as the Lord lives and your soul never dies I'm going with you I'll not leave you that's the church see keep your eyes on Christ remember the the pastor was working with a series with Elijah he said Elijah he had to wait for 10 years because he had to learn to step run a straight line he had to keep his eyes on the promise on what was being preached and brought forth in his time I'm just typing it there right just bear with me he said now look he said the Lord is called him he said so he said as the Lord liveth and your soul never die he said I'm going with you I'll never leave you that's the church keep your eyes on Jesus whatever he moves on with Jesus moves out of Methodist you go out right on out of him follow Jesus if he goes out of the Baptist you go and follow Jesus if he leaves out of the B Tabernacle you follow Jesus he says I he says I'll never leave no matter where Mama belong where Papa belong whatever it happens or another I'll go with you I'll not leave you Hallelujah I am your witness I can't go you're a part of me I'mma start jumping down a little bit over to paragraph 309 he say three places justification justification was gilgal right he says sanctification was the school of the prophets huh ah it's going to hit some y'all going to have to keep me in prayer the devil don't like this let me tell you he said look I'm saying where the Prophet said he said now the school of the prophet and the baptism of the Holy Ghost was at where at Jordan right he said Jordan where Jordan represents death okay at that Jordan represents death notice Martin he said he said Luther Wesley Pentecost he says dying out time still with me we know we pass that we're in the bride age is that right we're in this world but we're not of this world let us keep going he said now Elijah walked right down to the river Elicia and when they got down to Jordan he says and the old Prophet reached over and pulled pulled off his manle and he struck the waters and divided hither and then and two walked across he said was on the what dry land he said the preachers brother brandham said the preacher stood off still with me he said they stood off and looked at them go across now for you to you got to go across Jordan that's why the original pattern of the in time right that was hidden under the seals the Thunders in the seals remember Joshua 4 you got to go back and read I don't have time for all that you got to go back to Joshua and four and Joshua knew the original pattern still with me only Joshua knew it so at that time remember he said I think the pastor was woken that series he said that it was it was 12 Stones on the outside it was 12 Stones on the inside on the inside is that right so now for you to know the pattern first you got to go get the Holy Ghost you got to go get it when the pastor worked that he shown it was a hidden vessel remembering the vessel was going to be Christ he went out of Jeremiah and as he came out of Jeremiah then he went over and when he went over there to HH Joshua four he went to Joshua 4 let's go to Joshua 4 I know this wasn't part of it but let's look at it help me Lord we come back to it I feel some of them right there I'm not I'm not against the I feel that resistance huh but you're going to get it anyway huh how you going to get it anyway cuz God gave it to me God gave it to me I'm not speaking against the the the uh Prophet I know who Malachi 4 is 1730 huh get on your spiritual caps look at verse 19 I think it is he says and the people came up out of Jordan on the 10th on the first month and encamped in gilgal and in the east border of Jericho remember brother Steve was saying that they went to Jordan he had to go to Jordan he said but they had to turn to the east a little bit remember go back and listen to that message it was part 27 open and sealed evidence yes sir you go there and you'll know exactly what what I'm saying he said now he says uh he says which they took out of Jordan and Joshua pitched in gilgal and he spake unto the children of Israel saying when your children shall what ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean these Stones see they go the mystery of asking is that right you can ask but the only one had the Revelation was the anointing of Elijah Elijah knew we going to get I don't want to get ahead of myself uh but he says ask remember the Holy Ghost gave us a a mystery on ask it shall be given seek and ye shall find and knock it shall be open I know some of you looking at me with that look but you need to go back and listen to that message and this chapter will open wide up for you he said now you turn around and you look okay let's go back over there I'm I'm I'm I'm going back to the quote I'm going back to the message I'm going back to the message because the Holy Ghost don't turn the corner this ain't no baby food huh this is not no baby food I'm trying to tell you you got people you got you got people in this message that can quote this message front and back and say because they got the word they got the Holy Ghost and their life don't line up that's why brother brandham left the church ages and he went to the statute of the perfect man before he went into the seals am am it's a character that got to be developed before you can touch those seals before those seals are even revealed to you that's why they don't have the same anointing it's too different anointing from the anointing that's coming from here amen yes you got to believe it huh some don't believe it they don't believe they got they're not concerned so they're not convinced yet they don't believe they got to have the seals they don't believe they got to have the fness they don't believe it getting ready to tell on them too go back and get that message what he gave the pastor I know them sons of the Prophet don't like it I don't I ain't got I Ain't Got No Use For The Devil I don't care about the devil because I'm still representing Jesus Christ when I go in that pits of hell with them prisoners let me tell you something when the co come they took away the Bibles and they brought them tablets and the Lord had already warned us in questions and answers remember the pastor couldn't get away from that point in questions and answers if it wasn't for nobody it was for me when we got in there he was telling us because when you look at that tablet your mind is not just on that Bible now you got other thoughts you got movies you got games you got everything there so we started ministering against it and the inmates turn and when the inmates my my my my my when the inmates the inmates I'mma try to find a way to pull over when the inmates got there because I felt that I know that spirit is here how come God look God unfolding it now huh why is he unfolding it now cuz they don't like it I got no use for the devil religious demons yeah you got to understand every age it was a mixed multitude that came out every age and the mixed multitude caused the trouble the make believer caused the trouble and so when he come in there you got to understand let me keep it going help me Lord says help me Lord look what he says he said it was gilgal he said the preacher stood off and looked at them across he said and they got on the other side now afterward I hope this soak in the in the Tabernacle bones he says not when he was he says not when he was that gilgal not when he was at the school of prophets neither when he was on this side of Jordan but after he had crossed over Jordan he following him every step of the way he said now you look and you he said now I'm I'm I'mma drop down in verse two uh paragraph 23 then what he said I'm going to go with you right on through Jordan amen I like that why I'm going to be a witness of this and he passed through Jordan notice here it is I want you to get it after he crossed Jordan then he said what will you that I do for you you he said that's what Christ wants to know of the church tonight he said after you are separated from these things of the world after you become a new creature in Christ Jesus after you're born again filled with the Holy Ghost crossed over Jordan those preachers never cross over Jordan that's it and y'all think it's the pastor sir no sir no sir God has giving him that it's God that's where the attack is coming from you can't hide from you can't hide nothing it's Christ back on the scene huh you know what I tell them brother when they in there in the institution I tell them thank you Jesus and after they signed that petition they got those Bibles back in in the in the prison just about two weeks ago inmates in prison why because they are convinced and they became concerned and they got the Bible back in there we got look at us all that God has given us if you're really convinced if you really have no doubt uh you will be concerned about those lost souls that struggling we're convinced I'm preaching just like this probably harder and when there I got to fight them religious demons about a month we got about two months ago I need your prayers we had 39 Souls sign up for Christian baptism huh he's teaching us how to fish he's teaching us how to fish he's teaching us how to [Applause] fish I'm talking about religious demon Matthew 28819 that's a big battle out there simple to you but it's a rough battle out there getting them to see acts 237 238 that's what Peter was convinced about was he got the Holy Ghost and he went up there now Peter start preaching he wasn't preaching to some drug addicts prostitutes murder homosexual lesbian Peter was preaching to religious people he Lov those people he had a concern for those people when you are convinced you will become concerned let's keep going look what he says he said they had the past he say they were filled with the Holy Ghost after you're born again filled with the Holy Ghost cross over Jordan all these things of the world is what Dead behind you not ask what can do for you like this see he said that a double portion of your spirit Came Upon me that preacher know what he was talking about a double portion cause why because I wanted to witness that much more why did they go to the upper room to get the Holy Ghost they went to get the Holy Ghost because Acts chapter 1 verse 8 said so that they can become what Witnesses from all the Earth you see once you get it it's like fire shut up in your bones it's too many concerned about their own problems your own situations God is going to take care of it God is going to meet your need he promised is that right he said I we shall do a greater work than what they do what did he do brother brandham said when God sent him on a mission when he sent him on that mission and he had to take out the Amit it was uh in the Sun and was about to go down uh brother BR said J he said Joshua created a condition that wasn't there what about us huh what about about us you need your keys and you really need your keys God can bring those keys if you what speak [Applause] it that's what he had when brother Steve work in that message he said that Elijah see the sons of the Prophet they was looking at the man that's why they say we got to we looking at an idol no no no no we're not looking at the man we looking at the Spirit that's on the man when he come down and after he come down now he said now you look he said he's about to leave I'm just paraphrasing for the sake of time I know just hold your peace huh I'm looking for something is that right I got to go through there is that right he wanted to be a witness is that right brother RAB when he went over Jordan he saw the right order he saw the right order of those stones is that right the pastor was teaching that lesson we they all got the Bible but they can say brother Brandon meant this they could say brother Brandon meant that they can say brother Brandon meant this uh but until uh you cross over Jordan until uh you see uh the hidden Stones uh the hidden Mystery the hidden revelation you under the seals the Thunders under the second oil Matthew 2 you will not have the right interpretation I don't mean to keep you this long I got to pull over it's just dumping out go back and get what the lord gave to pastor had a open up once you convinced you concern you'll be concerned you'll see you'll see what's inside of you you are the hidden Mystery and then he had brother Steve say he said he says then Elisha before he raptured out of here Elisha he just parted it the Jordan River he said but Elisha when he came behind them it was now what you just say brother kma you got to speak it he said where is the god of Elijah he got a double portion you got to understand he was a witness he seen the stones and anointed him we are witness the seals are open the Thunders is being revealed the Capstone I believe them Stones might have been a pyramid Rob brother Robert those stones might have been built like a pyramid it's people going to stop it's something that's going to make it when they become convinced this one this one verse come to me and I'll stop him come on musicians look at acts 7 I didn't and and Pastor forgive me I didn't even do the revelation of that message that the lord gave the pastor but forgive me look at this here we'll close on this once you convinced you're concerned because you're concern is no longer for you that's EXA exactly right brother Robert it's it's no longer for you look at acts 7 and for the sake of time let's just look at verse 54 verse 54 we'll read down we know about Stephen he was Marty first mentioned this where Saul before became Paul he was a witness but look how look how our brother Stephen was so convinced he became concerned he said when they heard these things he said they were cut to the heart and they gashed on him with their teeth he said but he being full of the Holy Ghost he said he looked up steadfast into the heaven and he saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God and said behold I see the heavens open and the son of man standing on the right hand of God he said then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one Accord and cast him out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses down there clothed at the at a young man's feet they threw their clothes at a young man's feet whose name was who Saul and they stoned stepen calling upon God and saying Lord Jesus Jesus receive my what look what Stephen said and he kneel down and cried with a what loud voice lay he said lay not this what to their what to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep those men accept that part and you believe and I believe they did a man they Stone stepen to death they talk about us they put us down they persecute us call us holy rollers because of Sten they'll make it because of Sten that charge is not against them because of Stephen somebody will tell you that testimony that's why brother brandham always talked about Saul mentioned stepen he talked about the testimony of Stephen he saw a power of forgiveness he saw a power of forgiveness and because of him forgiving those souls he said charge not this not against them I said look he said look here in paragraph 2:16 forgive me I said stop but forgive me this come to me he said he said paragraph 216 you asked a hard thing but if you see me when I go away it shall be what you ask you shall have now brother you talk about a preacher watching another one he was really watching him he said that's what the church ought to be doing tonight for a double portion of the spirit is watching Christ watching the Holy Ghost the the way it moves notice it that's why I said it's not the pastor it's the holy ghost moving him not picking on the sisters not putting one down one day you'll become a mother remember over in I think is in ecclesiastics I mean Song of Solomon he said the woman of the dove eyes he said first you are brothers and sisters then you might become a a a a husband and wife down the line is that right so he's building us all up so we'll be on one mind one Accord and of the message of the hour don't no one that take you away from those Seven Seals and those seven Church ages and that's why he's building us up why so the Capstone of Grace Grace can rest upon us let us stand [Applause] I know it was like a shotgun and we were all over the placees was nothing the way that I guess I won't but the Lord know hearts are clear eyes closed head bow please if you just need something from the Lord just raise your hand right where you at God bless you God bless you God bless you God bless you God bless you God bless you Lord God we look into the heel to where our strength and Our Help Cometh From father you know my heart and my motive Lord God anything that was said or done Lord God that wasn't worthy have mercy upon my soul lord God but we only come Lord God to get oursel out of the way and you had your way Lord Jesus I pray that you think because Lord God as we look in there with Elijah and Elisha which is type of Lord God of us going home when Elijah was leaving Lord God we knew you always it was a time for we have to be concerned Lord God because once you're convinced Lord Jesus Enoch was the type of your seventh bride your Seventh Son your bride Lord God of the seventh age over here your bride age Lord God Enoch was the type father once he saw Noah start building the ark he know it was time for him to leave Lord Jesus you showed us Israel Lord God and I didn't even get over to Matthew 25 the show the second oil Lord God that's why you've given that Revelation to the pastor Lord God the the five wise the 10 the five wise and five foolish virgins it was actually more than for you uh uh 10 virgins Lord God that was just a type Lord God so Lord Jesus we thank you for all that you're giving us here Lord God continue to strengthen the pastor his wife his ministry Lord God and remember Lord God the musicians Lord God all the officers and your precious children Lord God that you purchase by your blood so we ask you Lord God to continue to watch over them and those Lord Jesus that are viewing in and those that wanted to be here tonight but wasn't able to be here Lord Jesus have mercy upon each and every one of our soul but let them recognize Lord God when Elisha got a double portion Lord God he got a double portion Lord Jesus when the Manel came down on them Father we were going to do a greater work you've given us the opportunity Lord God God to create and even Grant someone eternal life and so Lord God we have to be slow to speak quick to listen or to hear Lord God as the holy spirit said Sunday Lord God it's the unspoken word that quickens your bride down in her soul lord God because Lord God as us Elijah Lord God he heard you were in the storm you were in the thunder in the rain but the message was in the small still voice so Lord Jesus continue to bless all your bride your Universal bride let them recognize Lord God that is we're wrestling not against flesh and blood we love one another we love each one but father some Lord God have different Ministries and we respect Lord God what you've given us in this hour here now continue to bless this little Fellowship Lord God we thank you for all the testimonies we thank you Lord God for all that

Lord God this word to in this hour here now the storehouse is not just Jeffersonville anymore you have Lord God Outlets all over the world now but we we pray for these Servants of yours that labor in love we know it's not him we know it's you so father we give give you glory we give you praise we give you honor We Lift Your Name up on high and myself I thank you for touching this body father you know what it's going through you know what it's been going through but I Lift Your Name up on high and we thank you grant your children traveling Mercy along the dangerous Highway we make no excuse for the word Lord God but if I kept him a little long I thank you give him strength Lord God we thank you in Jesus name we pray remember the sick the shut in those that are incarcerated those that have loved ones that is incarcerated we thank you for all that you're doing we thank you in Jesus name we pray amen and Amen brother Steve praise God Amen all hearts and mind clear do you remember the ceiling the open evidence again oh somebody's lost I'm a pastor I can feel the church okay two minute okay so you soak in the message I'm a pastor there are things that you won't feel you a father have I say something wrong there are certain things you won't know until you a mama they can teach you all you want to teach the day you a mama you will feel it amen you begin to say oh I understand why mama was saying this there are certain things you won't understand until you a pastor amen when Israel was coming from Egypt they had gilo a city are you following me then the next city there was a city called Beth and then there was Jericho we clear and then you move there there was the River Jordan somehow Jordan was somehow that's why the Battle of Jericho you remember what happened and everything okay Israel was coming following these landmarks here and then when they crossed Jordan and they went and everything finished there I believe they were coming from the east or this way coming to the promised land so when they crossed Jordan and everything Joshua told the children of Israel that go in the midst of Jordan and put 12 stone in there we clear and they put 12 stone there and Joshua said take again 12 other Stone we clear now yes sir and put those Stone outside of Jordan we okay so there were 12 stone inside Jordan and 12 stone outside of Jordan so whenever they finish Crossing Jordan the water closed the stone we okay now so those Stone nobody tempered with nobody could change anything you you you you needed a submarine to go down there or a a tan to go watch those Stone there there was no Tartan back in the day so he was preserved without any problem but the 12 stone outside here anybody can change them over the year somebody can take the order and push this one and push this one until we don't know really the original picture of the stone maybe the stone look like a pyramid over time they begin to look like a trap so we don't know nobody took this screenshot when the stone were placed and say okay whenever something happen you can repair them this way there was no screenshot taken so over the year the stone could be tempered but not this one so the one who placed the stone is Joshua and since Joshua no one was able to see the stone here they were closed until Elijah came we clear and then the Bible says that Elijah begin to follow this path in other word in the Thunder between the line he was telling you that the path Elijah was going he was actually going following the stone you have to read between the line are we together so when they reach here Elisha struck the water we clear so for the first time since Joshua which is the to of the Holy Spirit since the ministry of Jesus Christ all the way to laisha nobody could touch the seals we clear you can temper with the Bible and you can preach any interpretation the Baptist came out from here the Methodist say no the picture was like this and then the the the Pentecostal say no he look like a star then the Presbyterian say know he was a circle so anybody can come with the interpretation but we don't know some even can put the interpretation close but the only way for you to know you need to the original picture and the original picture was hidden in the water so you need the spirit of Elijah everybody okay to strike the word of the word and to open the word and in the word you can see the he in tunders now you can see the original order and the original order can help you refix the picture the add the stone correctly that's why you cannot preach the Bible without the message of the hour it takes the message of the hour to give you the correct picture the correct angle of the scripture are we together first of all Elijah must do that with elha following are we together the first one to preach they still have to be brother Bram with as the Brad listening to him but after the departure of brother Branham the mental of brother [Music] Bram the M that was going with brother Bram never left with BR Bram the mentor remain with the BR so when when you come back with the mentor and you take now the Bible and you take the same message that preach and when you struck now the message of the hour again it begin to unfold the Bible in the things that are differently even things brother Bram never spoke but he would never contradict brother Bram we begin to understand the message better and better and that's when the sons of the that stood far away bow down before Elisha they never were able to touch the seals that's why preacher in this message some don't want to attempt this that's where the anointing is I just did that to put you back in perspective what the brother was trying to say let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we approaching you humbly tonight father I'm sorry I say two minute I took more than two minute Lord It's just to explain and to stabilize somebody as a Shepherd Lord I felt in my heart and I have to do it Lord father thank you for the message that you spoke to us Lord may you strengthen brother Kelly and may you remember again sister Joan Lord a soldier standing and fighting all the way like KF Lord father remember him Lord L and remember Lord father is hble Lord we commit one another unto th hand may you give us travel Mercy as we go into our respective place so that Lord father the Holy Spirit can continue to work in our life and for those that are not con convinced yet May the spirit bring that conviction that Godly conviction that will bring them to be concerned and understand that this is not an era of Dos and don't this is not a legalistic era but it's an era when the Brad is pull by the Capstone the very love of Jesus Christ with a supernatural tag within us bring poor by the word the opening of the word Lord father may you take the remaining of the week unto their hand and continue Lord father to minister to us we thank you and commit everything unto th hand in the name of Jesus Christ amen I just did this just to give you a quick idea I can do better than job than that but you you already got an idea amen glory to God go ahead brother said want to take this s just a closer walk with thee
