[27:41] sacred part of the service Lord God may
[27:43] you have preeminence Lord we thank you
[27:45] Father God for the songs that was sung

[27:48] helping with the song service Lord we
[27:51] pray Oh bless each and every one Lord
[27:52] bless the Saints father Laura may your
[27:54] spirit have preeminence Lord we pray
[27:56] that our worship was acceptable to you
[27:59] father Lord as we've invited you into
[28:01] our midst Lord God we just don't want to
[28:04] invite you but we want to make you
[28:05] welcome father and as we're coming to
[28:07] this sacred moment Lord we ask humbly
[28:09] Lord that you do as you did after your
[28:12] resurrection that vindicated and proved
[28:14] that it was you Lord you took the bread
[28:16] of life and you come by the breaking of
[28:18] the bread Lord the disciples knew that
[28:20] wish you father and Lord has the two
[28:22] disciples that were bewildered Lord
[28:25] confused perplexed Lord on the way to
[28:28] Emmaus how you've stepped in in your
[28:30] grace and your mercy Lord from the
[28:32] roadside and Lord you spoke to them you
[28:35] open their understanding to the
[28:37] scriptures that they might recognize the
[28:38] day in the hour that they're in and may
[28:41] you do so this morning father for I
[28:43] can't open the scriptures and of us can
[28:45] open the scriptures but only you the
[28:47] revealer of the secrets father can open
[28:50] the scriptures Lord we commit this
[28:51] service into your hands in Jesus name we
[28:54] pray amen amen
[28:56] the sound all right sounds good up here
[28:58] there's a little bit of an echo but
[29:00] we'll deal with it praise the Lord
[29:03] do you commend your hands to praise the
[29:06] Lord amen in other words are you is the
[29:09] Spirit of God in your life strong enough
[29:11] to bring your flesh subject to the word
[29:14] amen praise God you know for the Prophet
[29:16] said that this flesh will always be
[29:18] sticky a man it'll get tired it'll get a
[29:21] little bit a little bit fussy maybe and
[29:24] all these different things that we've
[29:25] gotta bring a subject to the Spirit of
[29:28] God and subject to the chapter 1 we're
[29:32] gonna we're gonna read three portions of
[29:33] scripture I'm not in a hurry but I'm not
[29:36] gonna take too long as we announce will
[29:40] it will have a an extra sort service and
[29:43] then we'll go into and more of a church
[29:46] meeting type setting and but we do want
[29:49] to give preeminence through the Word of
[29:50] God a man how many wants to hear from
[29:52] God a man is that your attitude Amen
[29:55] because remember the prophecy is that
[29:56] you you you know you get what you expect
[29:59] amen and if you're expecting to hear
[30:01] from God you know if Balaam was expected
[30:04] to hear from God God spoke through the
[30:06] donkey amen but he wasn't expecting and
[30:09] he missed the Word of God amen and so
[30:12] I'm not a donkey but you know God can
[30:14] still give you heart's desire no matter
[30:17] what Amen the children of Israel needed
[30:18] water and God provided them water out of
[30:21] the rock game and he's supernatural
[30:23] there's an old limits to God him and we
[30:25] limit to him and of
[30:27] unbelief isn't hinder God it only
[30:29] hinders the unbeliever amen so let's
[30:32] just take all the unbelief out let's
[30:34] just take all the flesh our fleshly
[30:37] mentality out let's take everything out
[30:39] and allow the Lord God to speak to us
[30:42] amen and I'm not here to speak to your
[30:44] carnal mind I'm not here to speak boy
[30:46] man and may God help us the Word of God
[30:48] can penetrate your soul and place you
[30:51] I'm not worried about our circumstances
[30:52] going around us I'm worried about the
[30:54] rap dream and I'm worried about the
[30:56] headstone I'm worried about Christ the
[30:58] word of God amen so that's my duty as a
[31:01] minute this hour of this gospel is to
[31:03] place you your soul in the rapture amen
[31:07] and if you're truly predestinated for
[31:09] the rapture you'll believe it and you'll
[31:11] march toward Zion amen and you can have
[31:15] the testimony of Jesus Christ and the
[31:17] scripture said that the testimony of
[31:18] Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy
[31:20] amen and we can talk about the testimony
[31:23] of Jesus Christ you know Jesus Christ
[31:25] testify and he said I am the
[31:27] resurrection and the life I am that I am
[31:29] I mean all these things he identified
[31:32] himself by the scripture and that became
[31:35] his testimony amen now what about you is
[31:38] that your testimony have you identified
[31:39] yourself by the scripture have you
[31:42] allowed the opening of the word to
[31:44] reveal to you who you are in this day
[31:46] can you say I am the rapture Amen I am
[31:50] the resurrection I am The Bride of
[31:53] Christ she is him amen is that your
[31:56] testimony without me there could be no
[31:59] rapture amen without you if that's your
[32:01] testimony there could be no rapture I am
[32:03] the rapture I am the fulfillment of that
[32:07] scripture that future was rid of me amen
[32:10] low in the volume of the book I have
[32:13] seen it is raining on me here I come to
[32:15] do that wheel Oh Lord amen and we submit
[32:17] ourselves to the Word of God and the
[32:20] Word of God does its work in our life
[32:22] amen amen it sounded pretty good there
[32:24] for a while now it's kind of going all
[32:27] over the place but we'll we'll plow
[32:29] through it so
[32:31] st. John chapter 1 verse wanting want to
[32:35] greet everybody that's still on the
[32:37] hook-up
[32:38] streaming the service this morning
[32:40] Madonna virtually Brett bless you we
[32:42] trust him and pray that the service has
[32:45] been a blessing to you so far and that
[32:47] the Word of God will minister to your
[32:49] heart say ma'am God is omnipotent he's
[32:51] no respecter of person or respected
[32:53] distances and he can he can fill those
[32:56] with the Holy Ghost they're on the
[32:58] hook-up as much as he can here amen so
[33:03] we love him we love everybody want to
[33:06] greet you in the name of Jesus Christ
[33:07] and we just want to give preeminence to
[33:10] the word here just for a few minutes I
[33:13] don't have too much I'll try not to be
[33:15] two scattered and would just plow in
[33:19] trust that God will bring the the
[33:22] increase ain't man
[33:23] alright I think that sounds good that
[33:26] sound good to y'all
[33:27] alright we'll work with that okay so the
[33:31] scripture says very familiar reading and
[33:33] I love that I love the writings of John
[33:34] in the beginning was the word and the
[33:38] Word was with God and the Word was God
[33:41] the same was in the beginning with God
[33:53] is that better it's better for me
[34:03] alright praise the Lord st. John chapter
[34:06] one verse one in the very very familiar
[34:08] scripture very powerful reading in the
[34:10] beginning
[34:12] was the word and the
[34:16] Word was with God and the
[34:20] Word was God
[34:22] the same was in the beginning with God
[34:25] all things were made by him and without
[34:28] him the word was not anything made that
[34:31] was made in him the word was life
[34:37] amen he was the source of life we're not
[34:40] just talking about botany life or
[34:42] natural life life it's excuse me in him
[34:46] was life verse four and the life was the
[34:49] light of
[34:50] man think about that now focusing on
[34:54] that light we're gonna be speaking on
[34:55] continuing on what is the message of the
[34:57] hour but for a subtitle the light of God
[35:01] okay all right few more verses in him
[35:05] was life and the life was the light of
[35:09] men the light shining in darkness in the
[35:15] darkness comprehended or not verse 6
[35:18] there was a man sent from God whose name
[35:20] was John
[35:22] the same came for a witness to bear
[35:26] witness of the light
[35:29] a tall man through him might believe
[35:32] amen you may be seated how many father
[35:36] local prayed your blessings to the
[35:38] reading of the word in Jesus name we
[35:39] pray and we'll turn quick to John 17
[35:45] but you notice here you know as our
[35:48] subtitle is the light of God what is the
[35:50] message of the hour a subtitle the light
[35:52] of God and
[35:55] you know it says here in verse 6 well
[35:59] let me back up real quick so in verse 4
[36:01] in him was life and the life was the
[36:06] light of men think about that so what
[36:10] God has given you to bring to be light
[36:12] to you is the life of God his life in
[36:17] him was life and that life is the light
[36:20] of men so when the scripture says rise
[36:24] and shine for thy light has come it
[36:27] could be nothing else than the light of
[36:28] God which is also the life of of men
[36:31] praise God now John John's Commission
[36:35] and I like that you can see the Eagle
[36:37] anointing here upon John the Apostle
[36:40] John how he's riding right he didn't
[36:43] just he didn't write all about the
[36:44] natural and about you know how tall the
[36:47] Lord Jesus was in the flesh and what he
[36:49] looked like and all these
[36:50] characteristics he wasn't so much
[36:52] worried about the aspect of John
[36:55] introducing the man Christ Jesus right
[36:59] because there was a hundreds and
[37:00] thousands of people we can say that saw
[37:02] the man seen the man and they recognized
[37:06] him to be you know so high and so quick
[37:08] so color hair and so color eyes and so
[37:10] on and so forth but John wasn't look
[37:14] judging after the flesh the Eagle
[37:16] anointing upon him realized that even
[37:19] though John did introduce the man Christ
[37:21] Jesus but more importantly that the
[37:24] thing that was the concept the thing
[37:26] that God was trying to get across was
[37:28] the light amen and that's that was the
[37:31] vindication that John was a true prophet
[37:34] of God anybody could have said oh look
[37:37] there there's a there's a middle-aged
[37:38] man that's probably the Messiah but no
[37:41] he recognizes remember the Spirit of God
[37:43] I said the one whom you seen the light
[37:45] descending up and remaining upon that is
[37:48] the Messiah and so John was commissioned
[37:51] to recognize that light and then to
[37:54] introduce that light amen praise God and
[37:59] so you know John he didn't have any
[38:00] miracles there was no signs and wonders
[38:03] that John could say hey this vindicates
[38:05] me so John wasn't vindicated by signs
[38:07] and wonders by miracles but he was
[38:09] vindicated by his ability to identify
[38:12] the light
[38:13] amen and so people heard the Lord Jesus
[38:16] preaching they heard him teaching but
[38:18] they could not see the light and so was
[38:21] it in this hour that's the prophet of
[38:22] God's duty is to introduce us to the
[38:26] light amen the light of this hour
[38:29] amen and so without that without seeing
[38:32] that light you're lost without seeing
[38:34] that light there's no redemption for you
[38:36] without seeing that light there is no
[38:39] rapture for you so you can you can read
[38:41] all the books you want you can listen to
[38:43] all the tapes you want you can read
[38:45] every verse in the Bible and have every
[38:47] person memorize but without coming in
[38:49] contact with that light there is no life
[38:53] for you amen and that is the core that
[38:57] is the message itself is the light of
[39:00] God for this hour amen and without that
[39:04] you're lost without that you're in
[39:06] darkness and heading towards the
[39:07] Tribulation Period amen and I found they
[39:10] were striking when we were listening to
[39:11] that tape this morning as it was playing
[39:14] you know brother Baylor made reference
[39:15] reference that the builders had lost the
[39:17] headstone how embarrassing amen the
[39:20] builders that are supposed to be
[39:22] instructed in the house of God how the
[39:24] house is supposed to be built the
[39:26] contractors are professionals those that
[39:28] are supposed to be able to read the
[39:30] blueprints they lost the headstone and
[39:33] so as in this message am I'm fully
[39:35] persuaded that the majority of the
[39:38] builders in this message have lost the
[39:40] headstone even though the Prophet
[39:42] introduced us to the headstone they've
[39:44] lost it they focus on everything else
[39:47] they focus on the mechanics they focused
[39:49] on on on the do's and don'ts and their
[39:51] legalism and all this other nonsense but
[39:53] they folk they have lost the best stone
[39:56] there was no headstone there's no
[39:57] rapture with no headstone there's no
[39:59] redemption with no headstone there's no
[40:02] redemption for you a man with no
[40:04] headstone there's the Tribulation Period
[40:06] a man at best producing tribulation
[40:10] Saints good tribulation Saints that are
[40:12] to have a holy conviction of the Word of
[40:15] God and are not willing to accept the
[40:17] mark of the beast a man just like the
[40:19] Jews that gave their life some of this
[40:21] back there under the World War 2 and all
[40:23] that amen but we've got to watch that
[40:25] light and when the prophet of God said
[40:27] I'm watching for that light to come down
[40:29] in a meeting a man we've got to find
[40:32] that light we've got to strike that tip
[40:34] is in vain all of our efforts are in
[40:36] vain think about that a man we're in a
[40:40] serious hour a very serious hour we've
[40:43] got to have that light we've got to come
[40:46] to contact with it something to change
[40:49] us a man from a church member from a
[40:52] carnal cane like spirit a religious
[40:55] attitude a fighter a man to a redeemed
[40:59] son and daughter of God coming in
[41:01] contact with the headstone the prophet
[41:04] of God said and you know as we move on
[41:07] further and further into the bride age
[41:09] further and further into the headstone
[41:11] age a man the two are becoming one the
[41:13] intelligence of Christ in the bride a
[41:15] man and you know one of these days we
[41:18] won't have to read scriptures all the
[41:19] time one of these days when when the
[41:21] Word of God is coming forth they won't
[41:22] have to be backed up with a quote just
[41:24] to convince for carnal mind no we'll all
[41:26] be in one heart in one mind and one
[41:28] accord the intelligence of Christ
[41:31] flowing freely through the body amen
[41:33] what will will will be traveling a
[41:35] thought then praise God I'm looking
[41:38] forward to that our a man and it's right
[41:40] upon us it's not around the corner it's
[41:43] not a far off amen now hey man you're
[41:46] not gonna be any more closer to God than
[41:47] your right now amen we got to ask God to
[41:51] help us help us help us help us help us
[41:53] amen praise God so let's see here we're
[41:58] doing good let's see Saint John chapter
[42:00] 17 Amen everybody happy happy in the
[42:06] Lord anyhow praise the Lord praise the
[42:09] Lord praise Lauren st. John chapter 17

[42:15] struggle for me I you know I try to you
[42:18] know you kind of want to take your time
[42:19] and dig real real deep but I'm not gonna
[42:22] be able to dig real deep so I'm just
[42:24] gonna hit the highlights and y'all can
[42:27] can and can can pray and maybe dig down
[42:29] into it a little bit more but y'all
[42:32] would know where I'm coming from so
[42:33] Saint John chapter 17
[42:35] again what is the message of the hour
[42:38] the light of God amen the light of God
[42:41] the prophet of God introduced us to the
[42:45] light amen the light of this hour the
[42:48] light of the coming of the Lord the
[42:50] light of the headstone the light of
[42:51] redemption the light of the rafter the
[42:52] light of resurrection power the light of
[42:55] the bride age' light of the coming of
[42:56] Christ that's the hour that we're living
[42:59] in the bride coming of Christ where she
[43:01] used to come to maturity
[43:03] amen and manifest all that Christ was
[43:06] all that the father was reporting the
[43:07] Christ all that crisis he pours into the
[43:10] bride a man and a man and a man let's
[43:13] listen let's read this st. John 17
[43:16] verses 1 amen these words spake Jesus
[43:21] and lifted up his heart lifted up to
[43:23] heaven heavenly places in Christ Jesus a
[43:27] man not worried about all these natural
[43:29] communistic inspired things going on
[43:31] around this we got a worry up keep our
[43:33] eyes on the headstone we don't want to
[43:35] lose track of the headstone amen because
[43:37] there would just be a headless something
[43:40] running around not knowing what's going
[43:41] on amen amen but the prophet of god
[43:43] introduced us to the headstone say ma'am
[43:45] but with it we've got resurrection power
[43:48] rapturing faith no worries a man we're
[43:51] gonna overcome death death shall be
[43:53] swallowed up a victory amen all right Oh
[43:56] then Jesus lifted up his eyes to heaven
[43:59] and said father the hour is come glorify
[44:03] thy son that thy son also may glorify
[44:07] thee think about that a redeemed Son of
[44:09] God or Jesus Christ the perfect son of

[44:17] said I the father worker that I work in
[44:19] here the to a man is it possible the
[44:21] bride of Jesus Christ can recognize the
[44:23] hour we're in amen the door of the
[44:26] Gentiles closing Amen de the prophet of
[44:28] God said when the door of the Gentiles
[44:29] closed God will anoint the church amen
[44:33] are we in that hour that thy son also
[44:37] may glorify thee
[44:39] so Jesus is asking glorify thy son how
[44:44] powerfully men glorify thy son a man I'm
[44:47] not worried about having a new house a
[44:49] new car and new this or a new that I'm
[44:51] worried about the same glory that's mine
[44:53] that's my inheritance being endowed and
[44:56] coming upon me and me stepping into that
[44:59] that I might glorify my bridegroom amen

[45:16] power over all flesh that he should give
[45:18] eternal life to as many as thou has
[45:20] given him and this is life eternal that
[45:24] they might know thee the only true God
[45:28] and Jesus Christ whom thou has seen a
[45:31] man I would love to break down into that
[45:33] I'm not sure if we're gonna have time
[45:34] but that is eternal life that they might
[45:36] know thee the father and the son amen
[45:40] they might know the father and the lo
[45:42] gosh they might know the father the
[45:44] the self-existing one the one with with
[45:48] all the attributes contained within them
[45:50] that they might know thee and the
[45:52] expressed attributes praise God keep
[45:55] that in mind the father and the son the
[45:57] thoughts and the expression
[46:01] in the on unrevealed still veiled and
[46:04] then the logos the expression of the
[46:07] thoughts which is the light the logos is
[46:11] the light and the light hello is your
[46:13] life the expression of God is the
[46:17] message of the hour
[46:18] praise God not books tapes not carnality
[46:22] not do's and don'ts not legalism not so
[46:25] much dressing and all this other
[46:26] nonsense sorry I shouldn't say nonsense
[46:28] but all these other you know all these
[46:30] other things that go along with that
[46:32] amen it is the express thoughts of
[46:35] Almighty God amen the light of God and
[46:37] this is eternal life that they might
[46:40] know thee the only true God and Jesus
[46:42] Christ whom thou has sent I have
[46:45] glorified beyond the earth I have
[46:49] finished the work which thou gave us me
[46:51] to do and now O Father
[46:54] thou an our Father glorify thou me with
[47:00] thine own self
[47:03] praise God think about that
[47:07] that's where the scripture says that
[47:09] Christ thought it not let this mind be
[47:11] in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[47:13] that Christ Jesus not thought it not to
[47:17] be Robert II make himself equal with God
[47:19] let that mind being you think about that
[47:24] now O Father glorify thou me with thine
[47:28] own self with the glory which I had with
[47:34] thee before the world was
[47:37] praise God you know Jesus recognized
[47:41] that he was with the father before the
[47:42] foundation of the world and brother
[47:44] Branham said that you know of course
[47:46] Jesus the logos being the first one to
[47:48] come out of God the first which was the
[47:51] entire attribute of God expressed in
[47:54] somewhat of a tangible form right the
[47:57] the complete concept of God expressed
[48:00] and brother BAM said that down that we
[48:04] didn't come that way see Jesus came from
[48:07] the thought to the theophany and then to
[48:09] flesh so we bypass that we who know the
[48:13] thoughts of God were still the thoughts
[48:15] of God concerning us up to the time of
[48:18] this message were unexpressed
[48:21] the they were sealed the names in the
[48:24] Lamb's Book of Life was sealed nobody
[48:27] knew anything about it they were never
[48:29] been expressed but yeah so we come
[48:32] through
[48:33] carnality through sin through the womb
[48:37] of a woman
[48:39] unexpressed we come here in the body of
[48:42] this sinful flesh
[48:43] unexpressed to our true DNA are true
[48:47] attribute of God of who we are has not
[48:49] been expressed yet
[48:51] and so but yet Jesus he was from the
[48:54] thought to the expression and then to
[48:56] the word unto the flesh body where the
[48:59] map said we we bypassed that we're
[49:00] coming from the thought well the thought
[49:03] of God being revealed expressed is
[49:05] entering our mortal body amen through
[49:08] this hour of redemption so it's
[49:10] manifesting time its expression time so
[49:12] Jesus is saying glorify me with the
[49:15] glory that I had with thee before the
[49:17] world was alright now let's turn to the
[49:20] second the 22nd verse of that same
[49:22] chapter
[49:24] Jesus is saying and the glory
[49:27] which thou gavest me I have given them
[49:33] that they may be one even as we are one
[49:38] isn't that something praise God you know
[49:41] Jesus said the glory even had the same
[49:44] glory that you endowed me with before
[49:47] the foundation of the world I'm asking
[49:49] you to glorify that with me now and not
[49:51] only that I'm also giving it to them and
[49:54] then though they may be one you know
[49:57] kind of like we're one you know no no he
[50:01] said that they may be one as we are one
[50:04] and Jesus said when you see me you've
[50:06] seen the father the father worketh and I
[50:09] work at hitherto amen so he's saying
[50:12] that I the same glory that you've given
[50:14] me I have given them that they may be
[50:17] one as we are one a man that we can say
[50:20] as you see me you see Christ I am the
[50:24] fullness of the Godhead body I am the
[50:26] manifested Word of God I am at the
[50:28] rapture I am the resurrection and the
[50:31] life praise God because it is my
[50:33] inheritance I have been glorified I have
[50:36] been redeemed think about that strong
[50:39] meat amen be longer to them that are of
[50:42] full age that have their senses
[50:44] exercised by reason of use to discern
[50:47] between good and evil to discern between
[50:50] the two spirits working within the
[50:52] framework of the church amen and so
[50:54] Jesus saying that the same glory that
[50:56] you've given me I'm giving in and they
[50:58] may be one as we are one isn't that
[51:00] something powerful you the proper God
[51:02] said that to all that God was all
[51:05] tell him was he poured into crimes all
[51:09] that Christ was he poured into the bride
[51:13] amen how do you all a part of the bride
[51:16] right amen I am my father are one
[51:19] praise God you know where it's
[51:21] manifesting time a man it's an hour
[51:24] where the varieties that come to
[51:25] maturity the door of the Gentile is
[51:28] closing we've got to recognize where we
[51:31] are a man and being step with the light
[51:34] first John chapter one
[51:40] praise the Lord
[51:43] first John chapter one that which was
[51:45] from the beginning which we have heard
[51:47] which we have seen with our eyes which
[51:50] we have looked upon and our hands have
[51:52] handled of the word of life John was a
[51:55] witness of it he had heard the word of
[51:56] life for the life was manifested and we
[52:00] have seen it and bear witness and show
[52:03] unto you that eternal life which was
[52:06] with the father and was manifested unto
[52:09] us amen so that eternal life which was
[52:11] with the father before the foundation of
[52:13] the world John was a witness of it he
[52:15] was a recipient of it and because he was
[52:17] a recipient of it he could turn around
[52:19] and share it with you amen and that's
[52:22] what our that's where our fellowship is
[52:24] in that's where our fellowship is in
[52:26] email
[52:27] that which we have seen and heard
[52:30] declare we unto you that
[52:33] ye also may have fellowship with us
[52:38] to fellows in one ship going the same
[52:41] direction amen
[52:43] praise God and surely our Fellowship is
[52:46] with the father and with his son Jesus
[52:49] Christ surely our Fellowship is with the
[52:52] pro generator truly our Fellowship is
[52:54] with the creator's truly our Fellowship
[52:56] is with the UH the the the unseen God
[53:00] and him who he has expressed and the
[53:03] expression of him a man truly we've been
[53:06] connected to the thoughts of Elohim and
[53:09] we've been a part of the expression
[53:11] praise God Amen I just explained
[53:14] everything I wanted to explain alright
[53:16] and these things right we unto you that
[53:19] what your joy may be full
[53:23] how many has their joyful Amen if you
[53:26] don't have your joyful then I I suggest
[53:28] that you get into that your joy may be
[53:30] full
[53:31] hallelujah this then is the message
[53:34] which we have heard of him and declare
[53:36] it to you that God is light
[53:39] that's the message of the hour and if
[53:42] you're not preaching that you're not
[53:43] preaching Christ
[53:45] amen and in him is no darkness at all if
[53:49] we say then that we have fellowship with
[53:51] him and walk in darkness we lie and do
[53:54] not the truth but if we walk in the
[53:56] light as he is in the light
[53:59] we have fellowship one with the other
[54:01] and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son
[54:03] cleanses us from all sin hallelujah
[54:07] praise God so let's go back here to st.
[54:10] John chapter one verse one real quick
[54:11] you know brother Branham explains it
[54:13] like this and if the Lord will help me
[54:15] all I'll pick up and kind of and
[54:17] continue with the thought that the
[54:18] Prophet is is is
[54:21] portraying here so in the message is the
[54:24] unveiling of God where the RAM says here
[54:26] this is a part of his way this is the
[54:30] way that he manifests himself to us
[54:32] manifests the Eternal Word God Jehovah
[54:36] made flesh like in Saint John one in the
[54:40] beginning was the word and the Word was
[54:43] with God and in the beginning was Elohim
[54:47] so the prophet of God again is like the
[54:49] Prophet said the thought runs deeper
[54:51] than the word so he's getting down into
[54:53] the thought and you know as a young man
[54:55] and in the message I used to get
[54:56] confused all the times because you know
[54:57] I would hear brother Branham say Elohim
[54:59] it's here you know talking about LEM
[55:01] coming and then Michael coming and then
[55:03] and then El Shaddai and then Jehovah and
[55:06] and then Christ and then Michael and
[55:08] gate you know all these different things
[55:10] and I'm well which one is it you know
[55:12] where we are amen but the prophets come
[55:14] to find out the fullness of the Godhead
[55:16] bodily is here think about that no
[55:18] wonder the Satan is screaming and
[55:21] howling ain't fighting for all he can to
[55:23] keep you from recognizing that light
[55:26] because that light is your life he's
[55:31] fighting to keep you from that life
[55:33] fighting to keep you from Redemption
[55:34] he's fighting to keep you from
[55:36] thereafter he's fighting of your
[55:38] predestinated position out of out of
[55:41] being a squatter in your inheritance out
[55:43] of being a squatter and your rights he's
[55:46] fighting to keep this revelation from
[55:49] you amen with Hollywood with all these
[55:52] all this nonsense of the world the
[55:54] Tribulation Period is right upon us and
[55:56] some of us sleep like like you know like
[56:00] we've got a bunch of Devils this rocking
[56:01] us to sleep amen a bunch of Hollywood
[56:04] worldly Devils we got to shake ourselves
[56:05] we're in a battle a
[56:07] resurrection battle Mount Zion battle
[56:10] RAF during battle a Redemption battle
[56:13] hallelujah amen the kingdom of God must
[56:16] be pressed into yes or you got to take
[56:19] this sword of the Lord and fight shop
[56:22] every devil out of the way shop every
[56:24] hindering spirit chop every carnality
[56:26] shop every Dogma chop every Creed chop
[56:29] everything that's contrary to this light
[56:34] chop everything everything contrary to
[56:37] this light is your enemy just like Peter
[56:42] telling our Lord when our Lord was
[56:44] declaring the light when our Lord was
[56:47] declaring the word for his hour how he
[56:50] must go up to be crucified Peter got in
[56:53] the flesh I said not so Lord Jesus said
[56:55] get behind me Satan get behind me Satan
[56:58] can you recognize when Satan speaks can
[57:01] you recognize when he's trying to
[57:02] motivate you against the Word of God can
[57:05] you recognize when he's hindering and
[57:07] casting a shadow upon your life upon the
[57:10] light of this hour can you recognize
[57:12] that rebuking get it out of the way
[57:15] we're in a battle we're in the evening
[57:17] time we're in the last hours of the last
[57:18] day the Gentile days are closing the
[57:22] sword of the Lord is here bring in the
[57:24] kingdom of God to deliver you to
[57:26] positionally place you in another
[57:28] Ephesians 2 positionally place you in
[57:30] the body of Christ in the mind of Christ
[57:32] think about that can you be one actually
[57:35] one we're supposed to be one in the mind
[57:37] of Christ the body of Christ one with
[57:40] one another amen
[57:42] praise God
[57:43] so a man Satan is doing everything he
[57:46] can to prevent you from coming to this
[57:49] revelation the proper God said if you
[57:51] fail go back to this message crisis of
[57:54] mystery of God revealed you let
[57:55] everything take it away from you your
[57:57] job your husband your wife all these
[57:59] carnal things of the world Jesus for
[58:01] warned us and Saint Luke chapter 21 do
[58:04] to you know take heed of the cares of
[58:07] this life of eating drinking all of this
[58:10] all of this carousing all this type of
[58:12] world events take heed that those things
[58:15] do not overcome you they don't overwhelm
[58:17] you they don't distract you from the
[58:20] revelation of the light of God bringing
[58:22] brought forth in this hour and the
[58:24] property God said how are the people
[58:25] going to recognize him when he comes
[58:27] unless they're constantly in the word
[58:30] amen praise God
[58:32] yes sir so a man the fullness of the
[58:36] Godhead bodily is here amen oh my god
[58:39] the host of heaven Michael Gabriel
[58:41] Elliot and every all the attributes of
[58:43] God have been revealed to the bride that
[58:46] the bride can take on the fullest of the
[58:49] Godhead bodily to probably God said
[58:51] think about what was once a great
[58:53] mysterious secret in the mind of God is
[58:55] now in the body of Christ hallelujah
[58:59] what was once hidden in the mind of God
[59:02] that safety knew nothing about nobody
[59:05] knew nothing about is now in the body of
[59:08] Christ the fullness of God is here the
[59:11] mind of Christ is here the capstone is
[59:13] here the intelligence is here we're in
[59:16] the body of Christ praise God amen what
[59:21] was once a great mysterious secret in
[59:23] the mind of God is now in the body of
[59:26] Christ that's where the prophet of God
[59:28] said that we have the abstract tide OD
[59:30] where's the abstract it was searched all
[59:33] the way back and it couldn't go back to
[59:35] Adam they went back before the
[59:38] foundation of the world before angels
[59:40] before Lucifer before anything back to
[59:43] the mind of God so now they're in this
[59:45] hour the prophet of God was not just
[59:47] connected with anything he went back it
[59:49] was connected with Elohim the Ancient of
[59:52] Days the Wed the wise one the ancient
[59:55] one the all-knowing one the eternal
[59:57] judge of heaven and earth the Prophet
[1:00:00] was connected to the mind of God to
[1:00:02] deliver you the Lamb's Book of Life the
[1:00:05] redemption of your of your souls man so
[1:00:08] the Prophet was connected to the mind of
[1:00:10] God he was connected to Elohim and
[1:00:12] brought you into the living image of the
[1:00:16] Living God a man when you've heard when
[1:00:18] you recognize this message to be your
[1:00:21] attributes the unexpressed thoughts of
[1:00:23] Elohim and you recognize this message to
[1:00:26] be Eagles food you have what heard from
[1:00:29] your theophany a mentor and have then
[1:00:33] been transformed into the image of the
[1:00:35] Living God and and you heard from your
[1:00:38] theophany hallelu so now is the rapture
[1:00:41] now is the expression of God manifesting
[1:00:44] in your life amen Jesus had to come from
[1:00:48] the thought to the expression that was
[1:00:51] before he was made flesh but Satan
[1:00:53] interrupted the plan of God it was all
[1:00:55] part of the plan of God he thought he
[1:00:57] interrupted it now we're here on earth
[1:00:58] born of a woman full of all kinds of
[1:01:01] mass all kinds of hippocrates all kinds
[1:01:03] of trouble but yet we've got a
[1:01:04] predestinated seed in our soul yet
[1:01:09] unexpressed and in this hour the book
[1:01:12] has been open the seven angels brought
[1:01:15] the prophet into the mind of God and ulo
[1:01:18] him from before the foundation of the
[1:01:20] world and picked up those attributes and
[1:01:23] now they're being expressed
[1:01:27] from Elohim to the logos in there now
[1:01:30] you praise God the expression of the
[1:01:34] bride of Jesus Christ past the light of
[1:01:36] the shower brother Stephens telling me
[1:01:39] to slow down all right we're gonna we're
[1:01:41] gonna do the best we can
[1:01:42] praise God so in the beginning uh
[1:01:48] what the Word was with God and who heard
[1:01:51] and in the beginning was Elohim and
[1:01:53] Elohim was became the word and the word
[1:01:56] was Elohim and the word was made Elohim
[1:01:59] and he goes on to say see nothing's out
[1:02:01] of order it's just Elohim materializing
[1:02:04] amen from Genesis to Revelation it's
[1:02:06] Elohim unfolding himself Elohim what is
[1:02:09] Elohim like I said the Father the Pro
[1:02:11] generator the creator the one in whom
[1:02:15] all the seeds come from the one that has
[1:02:17] uh of the self existing one the one that
[1:02:20] was unexpressed amen and now the
[1:02:23] fullness of his expressions are coming
[1:02:25] forth
[1:02:28] yes sir so go st. John chapter one in
[1:02:31] the beginning was the word that's the
[1:02:34] logos in the beginning was the logos in
[1:02:36] the beginning what is the logos a
[1:02:38] thought expressed is a word in the
[1:02:41] beginning was the expression of God
[1:02:42] stopped in the beginning before the
[1:02:45] beginning okay before the beginning
[1:02:48] there was the thought of God unexpressed
[1:02:52] their self existing one but since the
[1:02:56] beginning the thoughts of God were
[1:02:58] expressed in the first son the first
[1:03:01] expression which was God Almighty the
[1:03:03] fullness of God expressed in a theophany
[1:03:06] Jesus Christ so in the beginning
[1:03:10] was the expression of God and the
[1:03:14] expression of God was with Elohim
[1:03:17] and the expression of God was Elohim
[1:03:22] amen so I got the quote right here I
[1:03:24] have time to read it but brother Graham
[1:03:26] said that
[1:03:28] let me just admit me let me just read
[1:03:30] this one particular quote here then out
[1:03:33] of God or out of Elohim oh say came the
[1:03:36] logos out of Elohim out of the
[1:03:38] unexpressed came the expressed which we
[1:03:41] would say is like a little sacred light
[1:03:43] moved out of the darkness or out of
[1:03:45] eternity I hope you guys are listening
[1:03:47] see that light came out of eternity and
[1:03:51] that's when the beginning begun began a
[1:03:55] ma'am and now the prophet of God and now
[1:03:59] the scripture says in this hour Jesus
[1:04:00] reveals himself as the beginning of the
[1:04:04] creation of God Angie tempura brother
[1:04:07] BAM said it has to do with another
[1:04:08] creation he is creating himself his
[1:04:12] bride this is the the work of the Lord
[1:04:15] creating himself his body and sober have
[1:04:18] said that those seven angels came forth
[1:04:20] out of eternity and so here we are out
[1:04:22] of eternity in the beginning is the
[1:04:25] creation of God in this hour expressing
[1:04:28] the thoughts of Elohim that they might
[1:04:30] be materialized in your mortal beings
[1:04:33] hallelujah and safety can't do nothing
[1:04:35] about it any man the squatter has
[1:04:37] finished the accuser of the brethren is
[1:04:39] cast down
[1:04:40] why because we've been fully redeemed by
[1:04:43] the abstract title deed which is now in
[1:04:45] our hand now in the bright hand now in
[1:04:49] the body of Christ the property god said
[1:04:51] when that when when Adam lost the title
[1:04:53] deed it couldn't go back to Adam it
[1:04:55] couldn't go back to the dirty hands of
[1:04:56] Satan where did it go - ello him why
[1:04:59] because it hadn't been expressed yet
[1:05:02] Adam had the title deed Adam had the
[1:05:05] book of redemption but none of it had
[1:05:06] been expressed yet Satan couldn't hold
[1:05:09] that filthy thing with all of his
[1:05:10] unbelief and lust and and and jealousy
[1:05:12] and all this nonsense no and went back
[1:05:15] to the mind of God concealed never to be
[1:05:18] revealed until the end time and the
[1:05:21] prophet of God met that light the
[1:05:24] prophet of God the angels of God
[1:05:25] connected the one like unto the Son of
[1:05:27] Man with Elohim the Ancient of Days and
[1:05:30] and the book was unfolded amen the book
[1:05:33] was open praise God the beginning of the
[1:05:36] kingdom of God being ushered in
[1:05:37] hallelujah yes sir so brother Graham
[1:05:41] says that from Elohim came to logos and
[1:05:44] from logos came the man a man do y'all
[1:05:47] realize that y'all that's the process of
[1:05:51] the birth of a son of God or a daughter
[1:05:54] of God you're no longer the son or
[1:05:57] daughter of your earthly parent amen you
[1:06:00] come forth from the loins of Elohim
[1:06:02] through what through the expression of
[1:06:05] the word
[1:06:07] through the expression of the word
[1:06:10] through the light the bread Brooke the
[1:06:13] Bible says whatsoever makes manifest is
[1:06:15] light the property God said what is
[1:06:17] light it's the spoken word of God made
[1:06:20] manifest
[1:06:21] so in this hour the prophet of God
[1:06:23] connects to the mind of Elohim the
[1:06:25] Elohim though the boss of God dropping
[1:06:26] the Prophet each angel every night
[1:06:28] revealing a seal revealing the thunders
[1:06:30] the whole nine yards what do they do
[1:06:31] expresses the word expresses the logos
[1:06:34] and now from that sons and daughters of
[1:06:37] God are born in this hour of creation
[1:06:39] amen the begin the creation of God this
[1:06:42] is another creation this is a special
[1:06:44] designation of himself just as the Holy
[1:06:47] Spirit overshadowed in the womb of Mary
[1:06:49] the logos the expressed word of this
[1:06:53] hour things that have never been heard
[1:06:55] things that have never been spoken
[1:06:56] things that have never been entering
[1:06:58] into the hearts of man until this hour
[1:07:00] amen the work of redemption what was
[1:07:03] once quads great secret in his mind is
[1:07:06] now in the body of Christ hallelujah
[1:07:10] let the expression of yourself
[1:07:13] amen can you say I and my father are one
[1:07:16] I am my bridegroom are one
[1:07:20] rejoice for the marriage of the lamb has
[1:07:22] come and his bride hath made herself
[1:07:23] ready it was John's job to identify that
[1:07:26] light descending and remaining upon the
[1:07:30] Lamb of God but in this hour the prophet
[1:07:32] of God seen that light descending and
[1:07:35] remaining upon not the lamb but the
[1:07:37] Lambs wife the Bride of Christ she is to
[1:07:41] come on the scene in this hour the move
[1:07:43] is on for the bride thus saith the Lord
[1:07:45] amen the move is on for the bride her
[1:07:49] identification is here what are the
[1:07:50] opening of the seven seals floor at the
[1:07:52] 11th hour Gentile workers might receive
[1:07:56] their inheritance
[1:07:57] amen that's thus saith the Lord that's
[1:07:59] the scripture that's the light of this
[1:08:01] hour where are you are you headed for a
[1:08:03] Tribulation Period are you caught up in
[1:08:05] all this nonsense in the world are you
[1:08:07] in love with Jesus Christ are you
[1:08:09] fellowshipping with elohim and the logos
[1:08:12] are you fellowshipping with the
[1:08:14] attributes of God in the expression of
[1:08:16] those attributes are you Fellowship in
[1:08:18] with the light of this hour amen that
[1:08:22] the blood of Jesus Christ can cleanse
[1:08:24] you from all unrighteousness outside of
[1:08:25] that you're a church member outside of
[1:08:26] that you're in idolatry and the majority
[1:08:29] of the like I said the majority of the
[1:08:32] folks in the message have lost the
[1:08:34] headstone it's that way it's always in
[1:08:35] the minority they've lost the headstone
[1:08:37] they focus on everything else
[1:08:40] they focus on all like I said that the
[1:08:43] framework of it the simulants of it the
[1:08:46] the outworking of it but they have
[1:08:48] missed that light
[1:08:50] and like I said that best they're
[1:08:53] producing tribulations things but it
[1:08:55] takes the Word of God the light of God
[1:08:57] to produce rapturing Saints mmm
[1:09:01] praise God now let's take a breath take
[1:09:04] a deep breath
[1:09:05] everybody all right what is like the
[1:09:08] vindicated spoken word of God I'll try
[1:09:11] to that there's no light see you can't
[1:09:13] lighten the world with flashlights so a
[1:09:15] man-made idea you can't lighten the
[1:09:17] world with that no sir it just cast
[1:09:20] shadows and makes confusion and
[1:09:22] everything else it takes God's Word
[1:09:23] that's manifest the Esso in the Sun
[1:09:27] Amen that's why the scripture said he's
[1:09:29] spoken unto us but in this last day by
[1:09:31] his son by the manifested word
[1:09:33] that word comes through the prophets
[1:09:36] that word comes to the bride that word
[1:09:37] comes to apostles whatever it is it's
[1:09:39] all the Word of God the bride of Jesus
[1:09:41] Christ speaking by the son a man the
[1:09:44] expression of God if we could stop here
[1:09:47] for a moment if it would be possible and
[1:09:51] think of that tonight of the message of
[1:09:55] the hour the express thoughts of Jehovah
[1:09:59] and that's the message of the hour the
[1:10:01] expressed thoughts of Jehovah hallelujah
[1:10:05] before listen mediately where he
[1:10:07] connects that to you he doesn't just go
[1:10:09] like st. John this there's not any other
[1:10:11] he connects it before the foundation of
[1:10:14] the world we are told our names are put
[1:10:18] on the Lamb's Book of Life a ma'am so
[1:10:21] that's the express thoughts of Jehovah
[1:10:23] the property God is talking about we
[1:10:24] know what we can say it's st. Luke 1730
[1:10:26] Malachi 4 revelations 10 relations you
[1:10:28] know all these different scriptures but
[1:10:30] yeah it's also the names that God put
[1:10:33] what was written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:10:34] Life before the foundation of the world
[1:10:35] the expression of Jehovah a man that's
[1:10:39] to bring rapturing faith to the bride of
[1:10:42] Jesus Christ amen where the RAM says
[1:10:45] here as I've already mentioned in other
[1:10:47] words Adam the first man and the lower
[1:10:48] creations of God the first creation was
[1:10:52] God himself
[1:10:53] then out of God came the logo so he's
[1:10:56] saying the first creation was God
[1:10:58] creating himself in a body the logos
[1:11:01] was what which was the son of God then
[1:11:04] out of the logos which was the word
[1:11:08] and the word was made flesh into what
[1:11:10] among us and out of the logos came forth
[1:11:13] the man and it's the same thing that was
[1:11:15] God's Way of creating a son of God at
[1:11:18] the beginning and eye upon that upon
[1:11:22] creating that son that son had received
[1:11:24] the book of life the title deed to the
[1:11:27] earth but we know Satan came in and
[1:11:30] spoiled the plans so he thought and that
[1:11:33] caused the fall that caused those names
[1:11:36] to not be expressed the title deed went
[1:11:39] back to the mind of Jehovah concealed
[1:11:42] still still sealed with seven seals
[1:11:44] never opened and in this hour there was
[1:11:47] only was one that was worthy the Lamb of
[1:11:49] God he paid the price of a Redemption
[1:11:52] and endued and in the fullness of time a
[1:11:55] man those names have been expressed the
[1:11:58] prophet of God said see it comes from
[1:11:59] the mind of God Elohim he says he comes
[1:12:02] forth from eternity those names the Lamb
[1:12:06] of the book of redemption to Christ to
[1:12:09] the seventh angel and then the seventh
[1:12:12] angel does what hands it out to the
[1:12:13] bride a mem so we've got ell him the
[1:12:18] logos and then their sons and daughters
[1:12:20] God being born again by the Lamb's Book
[1:12:23] of Life how do we you're the light of
[1:12:24] God that's the message of the hour
[1:12:27] that's the message over the hour is the
[1:12:29] light of God that's when all hell turn
[1:12:33] loose amen demons begin screaming in the
[1:12:36] image and that certainly worked I woke
[1:12:39] Satan up amen 200 million demons amen
[1:12:42] coming against the bride to keep you
[1:12:44] from that revelation to keep you from
[1:12:46] that but there's more with us than there
[1:12:48] is with them the same ones that kick
[1:12:50] them out in the beginning are with us
[1:12:51] Michael and Gabriel Elohim we have the
[1:12:54] fullness of heaven the hosts of heaven a
[1:12:56] man on our side Bryan amen praise God
[1:12:59] recognize the light a man step into that
[1:13:02] light it is your inheritance a man can
[1:13:06] you say glorify thou me with the glory I
[1:13:09] had with you before the world was a man
[1:13:11] glorify thou me with that which I was
[1:13:14] supposed to have now I'm receiving it
[1:13:16] amen praise God amen what was once in
[1:13:21] the mind of God a great mysterious
[1:13:23] secret is now in the Bride of Christ I
[1:13:25] just love saying that praise God now
[1:13:28] listen to this this is my last cult and
[1:13:30] we'll close
[1:13:32] we've got plenty of time three more
[1:13:35] minutes
[1:13:36] just as we know listen Weber I'm saying
[1:13:39] here as a man asked me a few moments ago
[1:13:43] about the coming and the rapture
[1:13:46] we know we live the time out
[1:13:51] at the time of the at the time of the
[1:13:54] rapture is at hand and we're looking for
[1:13:57] a rapturing faith that can pull the
[1:14:00] church together and give it some
[1:14:03] supernatural strength and the property
[1:14:06] glass Center the third seal he says you
[1:14:07] don't see something has got to happen to
[1:14:10] change this church you know up to that
[1:14:12] time they had just had Creed's and all
[1:14:14] this carnality and all this a dead word
[1:14:17] and everything else like that but he
[1:14:19] said he's got to have something to wake
[1:14:21] the church it'll take the seven thunders
[1:14:23] to awake the church to give the bride
[1:14:25] the rapturing faith proper said the
[1:14:26] opening of the seven seals is the seven
[1:14:28] thunders all this stuff so it's gonna
[1:14:30] take that to give the bride the
[1:14:32] rapturing faith a man so some
[1:14:34] supernatural strength that can change
[1:14:36] these bodies that we live in when we see
[1:14:39] a God that can raise the dead off the
[1:14:41] floor out out of the yard and bring them
[1:14:42] back in life again a breeze in them
[1:14:44] before us when we see a God that can
[1:14:46] take the cancer that's eating man to a
[1:14:47] shadow and raise him to be a stronger
[1:14:50] man that ought to give wrath drink faith
[1:14:52] to the people but still it's got to be
[1:14:54] more than that a man because that was in
[1:14:56] the second poll but brother BAM said the
[1:14:57] spirit spoke and said the third poll
[1:14:59] will be the thing that catches the bride
[1:15:00] the rainbow trout for the rapture we
[1:15:03] know a man
[1:15:04] yes sir and what is the third poll of
[1:15:07] the opening of the word what is the
[1:15:09] opening of the word the expression of
[1:15:10] Elohim the logos bringing you your light
[1:15:14] rise and shine for thy light has come
[1:15:17] and the glory of the Lord is what risen
[1:15:21] upon me
[1:15:23] how do you praise God first and second
[1:15:26] coming a mem all right so listen to what
[1:15:29] he says here all right so strong man I
[1:15:33] oughta give us an afternoon faith that
[1:15:35] in that light flashes from the sky and
[1:15:38] the trumpet sounds the body of Christ
[1:15:40] will be quickly gathered together and
[1:15:42] change in a moment and are tinkling in a
[1:15:45] moment and taken into the heavens yes
[1:15:47] there's got to be something like that
[1:15:49] happen in our schools a theology can
[1:15:51] never produce that yet they
[1:15:53] intellectually are all right but you've
[1:15:56] got to meet that light you've got to
[1:16:00] find that something you've got to meet
[1:16:03] that light and that light is the little
