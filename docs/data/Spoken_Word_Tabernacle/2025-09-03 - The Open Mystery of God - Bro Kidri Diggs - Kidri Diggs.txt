========================================

What if the doctor comes to your house before daylight? &gt;&gt; He takes your pulse, moves back, said, "No, he'll never come out of that one. He's done." Oh, how you wish you'd have put that hand up. It might have meant something. Then pray for me, brother. I don't know who you are unless you let me know. Church don't know who you are. Or if you raise up your hand, God will recognize that. That won't save you. No, but it'll give you that much of a start. &gt;&gt; It'll give you that much start. Then maybe before the revival's over, you'll give your heart to Christ. &gt;&gt; Now, this has been rough tonight. We'll try to get down and more into solid down into the word in the beginning. I mean, as we go on, is there one more? It's been five. Raise your hand. Somebody else could have had just six or seven. I I want you to be honest. God bless you, young lady. Now, I know there's one more person in here that should have your hand up. Now, just put your hand up. Say, "Brother Bill, pray for me. I'm not coming back to where you are. I'm going to pray for you right here." And then just say, "Remember me now." And I am not a Christian, but I've always felt that I should be. And I I know I'm not a Christian. Is there another one now? Put your hand up. I'm fixing to close. Get to the piano, Teddy, if you will. Someone say, "Brother Bill, remember me that my life will be closer to God. I I don't want to be live this halfway life, this lukewarm condition. I want to really my heart be burning on fire. Pray for me. God bless you. God bless you. Heal you. That's fine. That's good. God bless you. I see your hands going up. Look, if God will hear my prayer to open the eyes of the blind, unstopp the ears of the deaf. Make those who are crippled, congressman, kings, potent takes, monarchs, cripples, just straighten out. Look around the world. Millions. Millions. I'd visually say this with true from my heart.

Not looking at today but look a little bit further away. You will see God far away somewhere there. Amen. So you are preparing for something that is way up there. And guess what? God came exactly at midnight. &gt;&gt; How did they know God come? That is the expression of wisdom to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So wisdom was not determined because they were virgin. &gt;&gt; Because all of them were virgin. &gt;&gt; Wisdom. &gt;&gt; If you look at both of them were virgin. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Both of them have lamp. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Amen. Both side have oil in the lamp that didn't determine wisdom. What made the other wise is the ability to foresee &gt;&gt; far away and prepare &gt;&gt; for the oncoming sen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And probably at that time they were not called really wise. &gt;&gt; All right, we talk about it on Sunday. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wisdom was called when actually the the the event happened &gt;&gt; then somebody will begin to call you a wise man &gt;&gt; or a wise woman &gt;&gt; when you were working they didn't see the wisdom &gt;&gt; but when wisdom begin to work then somebody turn again and say how did you know this &gt;&gt; that's where wisdom is declared amen &gt;&gt; amen Both of them have the same opportunity. And as a matter of fact, both of them slumber. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Is my Bible different than yours? &gt;&gt; Both of them slumber and slept. &gt;&gt; In other word, everything happened to everybody. &gt;&gt; But there is a difference. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right, we take that on. I'm not preaching tonight. Tonight is a convention. By God's grace, you pray for Sister Sharon. She's already in a flight. She's taking flight by herself. By God's grace, one of this day there will come a season. Amen. &gt;&gt; Anyway, they call me they they invited me to a wedding and the wedding is on a Friday in the middle of everything that I'm going through right now. And it's a it's a young lady. I knew her. She's a dentist now. She graduated. She's a dentist. She's a she's a message believer, a dentist. She even came all over to the United States and came and shadow me. So, by God's grace, she's getting married. So the parent insisted but I could not with everything that I'm going through right now I can't move. So sister Sharon have to take a flight. So there is a season &gt;&gt; that sister Sharon is traveling alone and there will come a season. Amen. So you be yes sir. Amen. So you bear with me. It's just a season. It's a zone. Amen. Do you know when uh I'm sorry but I have to explain this because church is a family to me. This is my family. The people God's gave me the precious people and I need to really uh uh take care of you. Very good. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know when uh you are in a war military people soldier understand this and if there is a building there and you are in the building here you cannot just cross if the enemy is over there. because you don't know where the enemy is as you crossing in between the two building you can get shot. &gt;&gt; So what they usually do the one that stays behind cover for you. &gt;&gt; So he keep the the machine gun &gt;&gt; going on &gt;&gt; because as long as they shoot the enemy will still duck. &gt;&gt; If they stop shooting then the enemy comes and see who is crossing and shoot you. So one need to stay there and keep shooting and firing to keep the enemy busy and then while the other one is crossing. &gt;&gt; So sometime I have to stay here &gt;&gt; and I have to stay there with a machine gun &gt;&gt; while everybody else is crossing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And when you cross you will see me coming ahead and following and joining you on the other side. But at this time I have to stay with a machine gun left and right because uh the devil is upset &gt;&gt; for everything that people are getting delivered without laying hand. &gt;&gt; So you cannot say brother Steven lay hand on me. No no no the word is laying hand on you. The word brother Brandham say one of this day it won't be the laying on hand of the presitter &gt;&gt; or or an elder. It will be the Holy Ghost himself &gt;&gt; laying hand on you. &gt;&gt; I send my word so that the word can heal you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You remember the Saraphene Phoenician woman. &gt;&gt; What did she say? She spoke the right thing. &gt;&gt; And that's it. Nobody lay hand. Her daughter was way far away somewhere. Just like the Roman centurion, the servant was way far away. Say you don't have to come over here. &gt;&gt; You don't have to trespass again &gt;&gt; and speak the word. Amen. And brother Greg sent me something I didn't know. I spoke it here under inspiration. Brother Greg sent me something that shows that the only time in the ministry of Jesus Christ that he went outside of the border was in that time. &gt;&gt; I just spoke what came to me and I didn't know it was written in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody put a note there and brother Greg took a screenshot and send it to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a season. There's a time. &gt;&gt; Amen. So all is well. Brother Steven love to travel but at this time I have to stay on the machine gun &gt;&gt; and keep the enemy busy when all of you are getting married and uh all the stuff coming in and I'm still shooting over there. And you say but Stephen, you don't move. No, I'm I'm shooting over there. My life is prayer in a car, prayer, cleaning teeth, prayer, pulling teeth, prayer. So constantly meditating because I want to see somebody blessed and delivered. So tonight I'm not preaching. It's brother Dicks who's preaching tonight. [Applause] I told him we love him. He's home and he's going to preach like home and we're going to pull like home and get something from the word of the Lord tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go. Only believe. [Music] We believe. Oh, Robert. [Music] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. [Music] Holy [Music] Oh [Music] my god. [Music] I believe I believe [Music] she [Music] [Music] I believe. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Are we happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. We are counted a privilege to be here with you again. We certainly appreciate your pastor. Amen. Brother Stephen. Amen. And uh love and appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why we come. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. To see him and him alone. Amen. Let's just have a word of prayer and we'll get right into the word of God tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray. If you have a need, you can acknowledge the Lord with uplifted hand. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, Father, we love you, Lord. And we thank you for the goodness, Lord. The grace that you've given us, Father. And we say it so often, Lord. But Lord, if it wasn't for your grace, where would we be, Lord? What would happen to us, Lord? But it's the grace of God that we're here, Lord. And father, we just want to take full advantage of that grace, Lord God. Living in your presence, Lord. And Father God, just knowing you and hearing your voice, Lord, and knowing that the hands of the pot are on our lives, Lord, and you're controlling every move. And Lord, we pray, Father, you would just be with us through the through the rest of the service today, Lord God. In the precious name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Church, say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. If you have your Bibles, let's go to Colossians, the first chapter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Colopian I mean Colossians 1. &gt;&gt; Um I want to start at verse um 20 25. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Colossians 1 and 25. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says, &gt;&gt; "Whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God, which is given to me for you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To fulfill the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Even the mystery which have been healed, which have been hid &gt;&gt; from ages and from generations. &gt;&gt; That's right. But now is made manifest &gt;&gt; of made manifest to his saints. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; To whom God will make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have your Bibles, let's go to Revelations 10. Uh yeah, Revelations chapter 10, &gt;&gt; verse one. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Revelations 10 and one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "And I saw &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a rainbow was upon his head. &gt;&gt; That's right. And his face was as it were the sunhu. &gt;&gt; And his feet were as pillars of fire. That's right. &gt;&gt; And he had in his hand a little book open. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice the book is not closed. &gt;&gt; The book is open. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So when he gave the book, it wasn't a closed book. &gt;&gt; It was an open book. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So anything that our prophet preached, it was already open. So you can't say he left the scene with a mystery clothes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; He said he had in his hand a little book open. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And he set his right foot upon the seat. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And his left foot upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord a bless reading of his word. You can have your seats. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. By the grace of God, today I want to use for a subject the open mystery of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The open mystery of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, uh, church, we ought to feel privileged tonight. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because when it comes because we're the seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It all started with with with Abraham. &gt;&gt; That's right. you know, and what God has been dealing with me. He's been I've been looking into the seventh seal, &gt;&gt; you know, and and many people say nothing is is is in there. &gt;&gt; That's because they don't know God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they don't understand the voice. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Of the one that came. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I'm not the judge. I'm just I'm just going by what God has revealed to me. But you know, even the prophet of God will say that the seals were revealed back in Genesis. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now church, you look and and you you think about who we are. &gt;&gt; God told Are we Abraham's seed? &gt;&gt; God told Abraham, Hallelujah. After his trial, he said, Abraham, there will be nothing that I'll hide from you. meaning that everything that needed to be revealed, it was revealed in Abraham's walk. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And as he walked with God, every door that was closed be to open. Hallelujah. Because he had stood the test of time. He showed that God was more important than anything else. So God said, "You know what, Abraham? I'm not going to hide anything from you &gt;&gt; or your seed. Hallelujah. But you know you when we when we think about the mystery of God, you know the open mystery of God. I ain't going to be long by the grace of God, but the open mystery of God, we just take those two words. &gt;&gt; Before we go to open, let's deal with mystery. &gt;&gt; Now, what is a mystery? A mystery is something that's hidden. &gt;&gt; It's a secret. Hallelujah. You know, it's it's it's something when you think about the Bible, it's something that has to be divinely revealed. &gt;&gt; Your education ain't going to open the mystery. Hallelujah. What family you come out of ain't going to open the mystery. This has to come from God and God alone. But let me say something to you. Hallelujah. If the seed of God is in you as the mystery is being spoken to you because you are a seed of God, something will begin to unlock the word will unlock who God is unto his bride. But but but the thing of the mystery, hallelujah, he said, hallelujah, that when the seventh angel begin to sound, &gt;&gt; the mystery of God will be finished. &gt;&gt; That means it's no longer locked up. &gt;&gt; That means it's no longer closed. We should be able to see exactly what the mystery is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But you think about something that's open. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Take your mind. Glory. &gt;&gt; If you say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The open mystery of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Let's just say that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Spoken word tabernacle was a mystery. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you Hallelujah. Let's just say somebody say, I want to I want to go to spoken word tabernacle. They come to the church, &gt;&gt; but the doors ain't open. &gt;&gt; So what's on the inside is still a mystery. They looking at the building. They in the right place, but they don't know what's on the inside because the doors are closed. But once they get in the inside, the mystery of everything that goes with this church begins to be open. Hal, it begins to be unveiled. You can see with your natural eyes. There are some things inside the church because the doors are open. You can touch it. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can possess it. Hallelujah. You can sit down with it. Hallelujah. And it can be more than just one person. Hallelujah. Because it's not just open to one. It wasn't just open to William Brandham, but it was open to a bride. Hallelujah. But church, as I begin to think about, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; the opening of the seals, as God be to come and and the the first horse rider, we know these things, the first horse rider started to ride and you know, hallelujah, the prophet said that before God spoke to him, he was going to say that that was God [Applause] &gt;&gt; because he was thinking thinking as a man. If you're thinking as a man, you'll never be able to see God for who he is. But then he said he prayed. He sat still. And then God came. Hallelujah. And God unlocked the mystery of the first seal. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But what I want you to see, church, hallelujah, the first seal was a mystery &gt;&gt; and the prophet didn't unlock it. Who unlocked it in? who unlocked the mystery of it. &gt;&gt; It's very clear in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen, &gt;&gt; the Bible says in in Revelation 10:1, &gt;&gt; it says, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I saw another mighty angel &gt;&gt; come down from heaven clothed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. with with a cloud &gt;&gt; and a rainbow was upon his head &gt;&gt; and his face was as the sun and his feet as the pillar of fire &gt;&gt; and in his hand he in and and he had in his hand a little book open. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he sat Hallelujah. one foot upon the sea. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One foot upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Now, we know that the prophet of God said that that was God. &gt;&gt; That was the covenant angel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But as we read church on down a little bit more, verse three said uh uh let's go to verse verse uh four. Verse four, it says, "And with seven thunders he uttered his voice." No, I want to back up. I want to back up. Let's go to verse three. &gt;&gt; It says that he cried with a loud voice &gt;&gt; as when a lion rose. So we look at this mighty angel &gt;&gt; when he came down. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He didn't speak like a regular man. &gt;&gt; The Bible says he roar &gt;&gt; like a lion. &gt;&gt; Now we know that the covenant angel, hallelujah, is the complete angel. Hallelujah. He is the seventh angel. Hallelujah. So the seventh angel came to open the first seal. Hallelujah. cuz he roared just like a lion. And what met that white horse rider? It was a lion anointing. Hallelujah. So church, it was Christ. Hallelujah. Opening the first seal, the second seal, third seal, fourth seal. So how could the Sabbath ever be closed if the first Hudson seal was open by the Sabbath? Hallelujah. If nobody can open it but Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh my church. Church look when he came. He came with the roar of a lion. &gt;&gt; And we know Hallelujah. through a vindication of a prophet. He said that. Hallelujah. That was God sending an anointing to combat false teaching. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He sent an anointing. Hallelujah. He set the book open &gt;&gt; that we will be taught right &gt;&gt; in this end time with so much going on. We needed a word that has sustaining power cuz there will be a lot of things taking place. And you see church, hallelujah. Listen what he said. He said the first beast of God that he went out to meet the antichrist the the antichrist spirit when it just his teaching. Now remember when the antichrist first rose he was in teaching ministry &gt;&gt; and the antichrist rode first in a teaching ministry. Now watch the one that went to meet him. Hallelujah. the lion, the lion of the tribe of Judah, which is the word. Now, we look at this covenant angel right here in Revelations 10. What is he coming down with? &gt;&gt; The word. He has a book open. Hallelujah. A word book. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, my church. And as he comes down, he gives the book to the seventh angel. Open. So the mystery of God lies within the teachings of that prophet. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's why people can't find their place cuz they want to put a prophet on the shelf. Hallelujah. But God sent a prophet with an open book. Hallelujah. So that we wouldn't be Hallelujah. tossed to and fro. Hallelujah. But church, &gt;&gt; look, &gt;&gt; we can see clearly. Hallelujah. Well, some people say, "Well, the service still ain't open because the prophet didn't say anything." &gt;&gt; Remember, remember it is an open mystery. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They were looking for a beast to speak, but the seven seal is a person. is not a beast. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And the prophet of God said when Jesus Christ came down, he restored everything that Adam was. Why? Because it was person to person. So God had to use a person for a person. Hallelujah. So God came down in Jesus Christ opening up everything that was closed. And what did he do? He gave it to the people. So the mystery of God, hallelujah, now revealed in Jesus Christ is where? In the people. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my lovely church. &gt;&gt; Listen. Hope y'all don't mind me reading a little bit. &gt;&gt; Listen. He says, "But God's great mystery." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. What the eternal God had as a mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Has anybody got the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Oh, about about four people raised their hand. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is very important. Because the Holy Spirit, hallelujah, is the unfolding of Christ in your life. Christ taking away the mystery of who you are. See, this is the key. Nobody knows who bride is. The only thing that reveals her is her life. It ain't her church. Hallelujah. It ain't where she come from. is the life inside reveals the mystery of the seed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen. &gt;&gt; He says, &gt;&gt; "You know what? &gt;&gt; Let me go back a little bit." He said, "And he had in his hand a little book open, &gt;&gt; and he set his he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot upon the earth, and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roared. And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices." The seven thunders have already sounded when this angel came down. &gt;&gt; I ain't waiting on eighth thunder. I ain't waiting on the eighth angel. &gt;&gt; Everything was manifested between the mighty angel and the seventh angel on earth. Not in heaven, on earth. It took place on earth because there had to be a transforming of the book. Hallelujah. The book came from God to the prophet and then the prophet handed it to somebody. everything. The book was what? A book of life. &gt;&gt; The last book of life. Hurry. So the mighty angel gave her the prophet Hurah a book of his life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then the then the seventh angel took this very same book that was open &gt;&gt; and gave it to a people. &gt;&gt; Not a closed book, &gt;&gt; but an open book. &gt;&gt; And this book, hallelujah, testifies and demonstrates the life of the mighty angel. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet would say, "My Bible has become a new book." What was it? It was the revelation. Hallelujah. It was the revealing of Christ. Hallelujah. That had nothing to do with a beast sounding. It had to do with a stepping into &gt;&gt; listen church. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Listen. &gt;&gt; He says, "And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not. And the angel, hallelujah, which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth, lifted up his hands to heaven and swear by, hallelujah, and swear by him that liveth, hallelujah, forever and ever. There we go again. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where was the uh the the the first place you hear God swear by himself &gt;&gt; back with Abraham? &gt;&gt; Abraham couldn't do it on his own. Abraham couldn't live the life on his own. Abraham couldn't produce the life. So God said, Abraham, because I could swear by no mother, I'm going to swear by myself that you are and will forever be the father of faith. And you possess the game of your enemy and your seed after you. We still in Genesis. &gt;&gt; I thought he didn't say nothing in Revelation. &gt;&gt; I thought he didn't say nothing about the seal in Revelation. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh my church. What I love about this, the prophet would always say, &gt;&gt; "You can't add nothing to it. &gt;&gt; It has to already be in there. It has to already be in there. You can't add nothing to it. You can't take nothing away. It has to already be in there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But what's but what's catching people? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What's stopping them when it comes to the revealing of the seventh? Hallelujah. Well, they say the Bible says it was silence in heaven &gt;&gt; for the space of a half hour. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And people look at the silence and say, "Well, God never said anything." &gt;&gt; And then the prophet will come back and say, "Hey, it's not a public show." &gt;&gt; Then he come back and he say, God told him, "Meet me in there." &gt;&gt; In a quiet place, Hallelujah. Oh my. Oh my church. Church, let me keep going. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Listen. See, it's all in the Bible. The mystery of God has been finished. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The thing of it is is, see, I'm to a place, brother Shimbo, I'm not looking for little things anymore. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; I'm stepping out there at the prank. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Looking at the sharks saying, "I'll walk on top of you cuz I wasn't created to sinkh. I was created to walk on water." So, church, brother, think of it is. Hallelujah. We look at circumstances and we put God, hallelujah, below our circumstance. We go to prayer. Hallelujah. And we spend 15 minutes talking about how the devil is fighting. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, the devil this. Oh Lord, the devil in my children. Oh Lord, the devil on my job. Oh Lord, give me strength to fight the devil. &gt;&gt; Who you praying to? Are you praying to the mighty one? Are you praying to the mighty angel? If you praying to God, you ought to acknowledge him first. If I can help it, I don't even mention the devil when I'm praying. I don't even call his name. I don't even talk about him. The prophet of God said prayer, hallelujah, is a relationship. He said prayer is you talking to God and God talking back. So you tell me what place does the devil have in your conversation with God? [Music] What place does the devil have in your conversation with God in your prayer room? He said, "The Lord want to do it. &gt;&gt; The Lord want to do even more than we want." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But we go into prayer with, "Oh, Lord, the devil does, the devil that." Don't you realize God created the devil. &gt;&gt; And all he is is a tool in God's hands. God tell him, listen to us now. God tells the devil &gt;&gt; how to test you. He don't have his own trials for you. Those trials are ordained by God. Satan before he does anything, he has to go to God and say, "Can I do this? Can I do this?" And if he try to conspire something for your downfall, God won't give him permission. Cuz you know why? His word says he'll put no more on you than you can bear. [Applause] So let me say right now, if you going through is for your good. If you're going through E, it's just to make you stronger. If you're going through E, it's just to show the devil who you are. See, the mystery &gt;&gt; behind you and I &gt;&gt; is Satan don't know what's in our heart. &gt;&gt; He'll see you make mistakes. He'll see you say the wrong thing. But he'll know if there's repentance in there. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, it's like David. I love David. David fought battles. David had mistakes, but David always repented. Why? Because the mystery behind David was he was a man after God's very own heart. He told a lie man out of God's very own heart. We can't meditate and murder God's very own heart. Adultery never. &gt;&gt; What was it? See, the way to please God, the mystery was open to David. See, it wasn't something that was closed. David knew all he had to do was repent. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's keep going. &gt;&gt; God has a mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ. Then given right down to his church. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "I got it." &gt;&gt; I got it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What was once in God's mind is now in the body of Christ. Think about that, church. He say what was in God's mind is now in the body of Christ. So that means there are no more secrets. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That mean the way to heaven has been revealed. That means healing is revealed. That means, hallelujah, joy is revealed. Every attribute of God is now revealed in the body of Christ because we're not living in mystery form anymore. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen, &gt;&gt; Jesus. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Why did God &gt;&gt; reveal himself to you? Why did God hallelujah took away the blinders? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Took the barricades off the door &gt;&gt; and then stepped inside. Lord, &gt;&gt; the prophet says Jesus making love to the church. &gt;&gt; His bride whispering secrets to her. Hallelujah. See church was being revealed to us the Baptist know nothing about. &gt;&gt; What was it? God making love. &gt;&gt; What was it? See, everybody can't come in that chamber. &gt;&gt; Only him and his wife. &gt;&gt; And you know if the devil is fighting you, hurry. If you made it in that chamber, he got to take you with all your flaws. If you make it to that table, he can't give you back. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Well, let's go back to Genesis. Hallelujah. Let's go back to Genesis. Remember, Jacob worked seven years for a woman. He worked seven years for a I believe it was Rachel. Hallelujah. Rachel. The first one he wanted was Rachel. He worked seven years for a heart. It was no secret. Layman knew exactly who he wanted and he worked and he worked seven years. &gt;&gt; Then they walked down the aisle. Hallelujah. Changed vows, did everything in their customs. Hallelujah. Jacob thought it was her. Then they got in the chamber. Hallelujah. and they start revealing themselves and she took off the veil and he said, "Why didn't he give her back? Why didn't he give her back? He couldn't because she hadn't already saw his secrets. [Applause] She had to saw the parts of him that no other woman had seen. Only a wife can see. If you understand what I'm talking about, they were in the bad chamber. Hallelujah. And she couldn't move out of there saying, "Hey, he don't want me, but I know all the secrets." That's why when you were grafted in, God couldn't give you back. No matter what happened, no matter what they say, we already saw a secret already. I don't know about you, but he injected the seed inside me. I got the seed inside me. He can't give me back. I'm with [Applause] Yes, sir. And God is not one to deny his own. &gt;&gt; So what did So what did God do? What did Jacob do? He worked seven more years. &gt;&gt; And what you fail to realize, hallelujah, Leah was a part of Jacob's secret &gt;&gt; because he had children of promise inside of her. Hallelujah. So what looked like was out of order was really an open door. No, it was God over Satan. It was God's secret being revealed. There was a Simeon. Hallelujah. There was a Levi. Hallelujah. [Applause] They were inside a real Rachel. So God hallelujah had to let the mystery be unveiled. What was it? It was an open mystery. This wasn't done in secret. You know why it had to be done in the open? So those kids couldn't be denied to their inheritance. [Music] [Applause] That's why God called us in a world like this today in front of everybody so our inheritance cannot be denied [Applause] &gt;&gt; Jacob wonderful &gt;&gt; Jacob say you know what I'm going to I'mma keep working. &gt;&gt; Rachel said, "You know what? He really loves me." &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to give him my hands made &gt;&gt; another open mistress. &gt;&gt; Another child came out of the hands made. &gt;&gt; Say you want to fight like that. I'm going to give him my hands made. What looked like it was completely out of order was God straightening things up for the promise to come to pass. Because God, hallelujah, one thing he cannot do, God cannot tell a lie. He said your seed will be like the stars. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you look at it, church. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It looked like to everybody else that Leah should have kept silent. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; She should have kept silent. Hallelujah. But it was the mighty one himself &gt;&gt; doing that work in her life. &gt;&gt; So really church, I'm jumping ahead cuz I ain't going to be long. So really church, the breaking of the seventh seal is God stripping the silence off of your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The reason why it's still silent to some people because they're still bound in sin. But you give me anybody who knows they're redeemed. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You give me anybody that knows they're redeemed by the blood of the lamb. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Listen. &gt;&gt; Everybody all right? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; See what looks like. See, we have to be careful &gt;&gt; that we don't make the message a doctrine. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's not a doctrine. &gt;&gt; It's a lifestyle. &gt;&gt; It's a life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you just can't live the dos and don'ts. Hallelujah. And be unhappy and all this stuff. No. &gt;&gt; That's not the revelation. &gt;&gt; The revelation is a lifestyle. Hallelujah. Remember when David messed up and did all he what was the mystery? Hallelujah. David in his greatest trial of his life. Hallelujah. He wasn't questioning whether God was real. &gt;&gt; It was in his walk. &gt;&gt; He said, "Lord, restore unto me the joy of my salvation." &gt;&gt; And that's what catches people. Hallelujah. Well, sometimes you want to know why you are not where you're supposed to be. Well, let's unlock that mystery. It's because you don't have the joy you're supposed to have. &gt;&gt; If you're going through something, if there's no joy, Dad, it's easy for the devil to sweep you by the wayside. [Music] Even &gt;&gt; Christ's joy was questioned &gt;&gt; when he was going &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; to be crucified. &gt;&gt; He said, "Lord, oh Lord, take this thing from me, Lord." &gt;&gt; See, it was heavy. &gt;&gt; But what overpowered that? &gt;&gt; It was the mystery of his will. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when you catch the mystery of his will for your life, it'll restore the joy that you can go through what you're supposed to go through. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Look. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Look, church. He gave his life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, that that's how the enemy fights. The enemy wants you to be coming to church with no joy. sitting by your husband mad &gt;&gt; cuz y'all had a fight before you got to church. &gt;&gt; And you going to come in here and not clap, don't do nothing. Stay at him. [Applause] [Applause] &gt;&gt; You think God don't know what you going through? &gt;&gt; You know that sound. Hallelujah. When there used to be something on the television. Hallelujah. And then this is only a test. [Applause] It's coming back clear again. Right now it's just a little bit of blood li. But it ain't going to last forever. That picture going to come back clear again. Hallelujah. You just got to sit still. Hallelujah. Because when it comes back clear, it picks back up exactly where it left off. &gt;&gt; Oh, they they try they trying to act like they don't know what I'm talking about on the TV. &gt;&gt; Listen, &gt;&gt; let me let me let me encourage you a little bit. Honey, remember when it comes to trials and tribulations, &gt;&gt; Satan was minding his own business. &gt;&gt; But he but he wanted to go to church. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's his thing. He want to be where the people of God are. &gt;&gt; That's the only place he can be used. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He ain't worried about the ones he got. He want the ones that's resisting him cuz that's when he feel good about himself. &gt;&gt; But church, what he does is he watch you, he study you, he come to church. Hallelujah. He follow you down 85 doing a rush hour. &gt;&gt; It's too much traffic. You might as well turn around, go back home, stream the service tonight. That's for those of you who stayed home. &gt;&gt; You know you was on your way, but then the enemy gave you some reason. &gt;&gt; The mystery of God is open. &gt;&gt; But church, what did he do? He went there. He said, "Hey, God said, "Hey, Satan, what you doing?" The look look, let me say this. God is never on defense. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; If you if if if he's on defense, that mean he doesn't know Satan's move. [Applause] &gt;&gt; But God knows all things. &gt;&gt; For Satan to get by God, God lets him go &gt;&gt; because who he is. But in the spirit, every time he moved, God was like, "Where you think you going? &gt;&gt; You can only go where I tell you to go." &gt;&gt; And church, God is never on the defense. He's always on the offense. Hallelujah. And Satan is always on the defense. You know why? Because he has to see something to pervert it. Right. &gt;&gt; God is the creator. Hallelujah. So there's nothing that Satan can do that gets God's attention. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he calls. He say, "Hey, what you doing in church?" He said, "I'm just walking to and fro trying to get somebody to mess up somebody life." &gt;&gt; Then he says, "Hey, have you considered my servant Job?" Amen. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; he begins to have a I love to say this, a testimony service about Job. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said there's nothing like him in all the earth. &gt;&gt; He's a righteous man. &gt;&gt; He obscured from evil. &gt;&gt; He never even looked at a young maiden wrong. &gt;&gt; Perfect. &gt;&gt; Have you considered him &gt;&gt; perfect? &gt;&gt; Now listen to Satan. Even he knows &gt;&gt; there's an open mystery. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; He looks at Job. &gt;&gt; And the God says that to him, "Have you considered my servant Job?" &gt;&gt; Satan says, &gt;&gt; "Yes, &gt;&gt; but you protect everything about him. &gt;&gt; His house is blessed. His kids are blessed. His cattle is blessed. Everything about him is blessed." Listen to the devil testify about Job just like God did. &gt;&gt; So, Satan knew he was untouchable. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God's children are still the same tonight. &gt;&gt; Still untouchable. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Look church, listen what he says. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit always speaks the word. I've got many things to tell you. You cannot understand it now. But when he comes, he'll guide you to it. &gt;&gt; That's the reason the coming of those seals. &gt;&gt; At the finishing of the seventh seal, the mystery of God should be finished to know. Hallelujah. What is it all about? to know who God is. Now, I'm going to say it again. Are the seals open? &gt;&gt; If they're open, we should know who God is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Without faith, it is impossible to please him. And God is a rewarder of those that diligently &gt;&gt; listen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He saidh it should be finished to know who God is, &gt;&gt; what he is, how he lives, &gt;&gt; his nature, his being. You're supposed to be all the way up here by the time they're revealed. &gt;&gt; No more mysteries. We're supposed to know his nature, &gt;&gt; his being, who God is, what he is, how he lives. He said, "Hallelujah." See, bring us into the full statue, sons and daughters of God, a church that's washed in the blood of Christ. That's brought with that's that's brought without money is paid for by the blood of Jesus Christ. So church, when we think about the open mystery of God, it means that nothing about God is hid from us. &gt;&gt; I heard I heard the pastor say tonight that the flu is going around. &gt;&gt; We got the answer for the flu. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. That's right. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. We got the answer for the food. What is it? It's revealed in the mystery. Knowing who God is. Who is he? He's a healer. &gt;&gt; We got the answer. &gt;&gt; But the thing about it, church, we shouldn't be speaking to our sickness when we get it. &gt;&gt; You have the power to stop the enemy in his tracks &gt;&gt; before he can even plant. Church, as soon as you feel a little scratched, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; you ought to say, "Fool, I bind you right now in the name of Jesus Christ." Hallelujah. That's what's been revealed to us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What does it mean? &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; It means, church, that when the prophet came, and I'm about to close, and get nervous. When the prophet came, he came with a book of food. &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you a testimony of a sister in our church. &gt;&gt; She uh uh something wrong with her car and her car she'd go out and it and it wouldn't crank. She'd go out and it wouldn't crank. Go out, it wouldn't crank. She'd pray about it every time it crank up. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then one time she went out and it didn't crank. She said, "That's enough." So she called her husband said, "Hey, I'm going to AutoZone, wherever it was." She went there and they tested and say, "You need a new battery." Said, "Okay." So she called, she said, "I think I just bought a new battery. You know, my battery should be under warranty." So she called the people she bought the car from, the dealership, wherever. And she said, "Hey, I need another battery." They said, "Said, yeah, it's under warranty. Come on in and get it." So she gets there and the guy she was talking to on the phone, let's just say his name was Jack. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I can't remember his name. So, Jack sounds like a good name. So, let's just say his name was Jack. And she's standing at the counter with Jack and she says, "Hey, Jack, I'm the person who just talked to you." He says, "Okay, give me your invoice." She said, "You didn't say anything about an invoice. You told me it was on the warranty. Come on in." He said, "Well, I can't do nothing unless you got an invoice." She said, "You didn't tell me about no invoice. He says, "Well, I can't do nothing about it unless you show me an invoice." Man, you didn't tell me nothing about no invoice. Now she getting agitated. &gt;&gt; Y'all know if the Holy Ghost don't help us, we'll show out. &gt;&gt; Y'all know we'll show out bad &gt;&gt; if the Holy Ghost ain't present. &gt;&gt; And she start feeling it. See him and her going back and forth. He said, "Well, ma'am, I can't do nothing. All I can do is give you the warranty department." She said, "Give me the warranty department cuz you going to hit by me." So, she get the she get the warranty. She say she go in her car. She riding around in the parking lot. Stupid. Y'all know how we get sometime. &gt;&gt; She said she riding around on the phone waiting cuz they going to hear me waiting. Riding around in the parking lot waiting. She said, "God said, you prayed about it." She said, "Yeah, Lord, I done prayed about it." Said, "God said, pray again." So she prayed again. Still waiting. So she waiting. He said, the man told her, "Jack, before she went in the car, she said, "Hey," he said, "Check your glove compartment. It's probably in your glove compartment." She said, "Man, ain't nothing in my glove compartment." Said, "I don't put nothing in my glove." And if it's in my gug apartment, it probably got oil, all kind, it's probably tore all up, ragged it, all kind of stuff on it. But it ain't in there. She look nothing in there. So now she outside waiting on the people. God say he prayed about it. I said, so she prayed about it. Nothing. &gt;&gt; Y'all y'all should have said amen. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes you pray and it's nothing. [Applause] God be want to see what you made of. &gt;&gt; Do you believe, hallelujah, that the mystery is open, the mystery of the prayer? &gt;&gt; So now, hallelujah, God told her, hallelujah, and this may not be verbatim, but I'm giving you the gist of it. God told her the second time he say, "Pray about it and pray where you want it to be. [Applause] The mystery of God is finished. We ought not to be praying prayers all out in space. We need to say, "Lord, if you need $5,000, don't go to God talking about whatever your will is." That mean you don't believe before you pray you don't believe. You can't sight God out. E believe or you don't. It's either a fraud or a duke. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's either faith or doubt. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But what we do, we try to be all spiritually correct with God. Lord, if it's your will, I need to be blessed with five times. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't pray like that. &gt;&gt; God got to tell me no. [Music] &gt;&gt; He got to tell me no. &gt;&gt; I'm like Paul. I'm going keep coming back. I'mma keep coming back. He rather tell me go sit down. My grace is sufficient. Cuz I'm going to keep coming in prayer. Hallelujah. If I got to fast two times, three times, three weeks, four weeks, I'm going to do it until he until I hear yes or no. We're not in the day of assuming. I got something big right now I'm praying about. And I didn't spoke it. I didn't put it out. I done put it out there in church. I said, "Lord, I want a house with no payments." [Applause] Some of you will say stuff like that cuz you don't believe he can do it. Let me tell you something. I see him do it. &gt;&gt; Let me ask you something. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes God just want you to get in position. &gt;&gt; He already got the blessing waiting on you. &gt;&gt; Devil said, "Ah, y'all was selling that ministry all that time and look what happened. God had this blessing waiting on you. [Applause] God had the building waiting on you." Hallelujah. Church, I said, "Lord, I want a house with no payments. And let me tell you something. &gt;&gt; I ain't talking about no sack. &gt;&gt; I ain't talking about no tiny house. [Applause] Is it is it is it open or closed? &gt;&gt; Has the mystery to God be revealed or not [Applause] &gt;&gt; church. &gt;&gt; But we won't step out there and put hallelujah our God on a pastor. &gt;&gt; But we sing that song. We serve a mighty big God. A very big God. Oh. But when it come to him doing big things, we try to act all super spiritual. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And then we put this false humility. Lord, I don't need it. But if you want to bless me, you already told him you don't need it. So how you going to bless you? church. &gt;&gt; Look, she said she prayed again and she said she felt the spirit of the Lord move in that car. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And she said, "Lord, I want it in the glove compartment where she &gt;&gt; where she looked before and it wasn't there." church. &gt;&gt; Church, &gt;&gt; after she prayed, &gt;&gt; she opened up the the glove box. &gt;&gt; Church, it was an invoice in there so spanking new &gt;&gt; that thing was so white, so crispy, it looked like it just came out of a printer. And she told the testimony. I said, "God got ovens in hell in heaven forever. And God got brilli in church." She grabbed the invoice at the drug compartment. She went back in there say, "Where at? Where Jack at? I got my in. You can't tell me my God ain't great. You can't tell me my God ain't great. Take your ear voice as you testify to all the people about God creating ear voices. Church, &gt;&gt; we ought to know how to get something out of God. [Applause] He's open. &gt;&gt; This ain't a closed book. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's a lot more I can say without feeling led. &gt;&gt; Church, &gt;&gt; another sister in our church. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; They went down to Florida on vacation with the whole family and they've been itching to go with the family. So they finally went. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And they was doing something in the house playing a game or doing something and she ran into the wall and fell. Broke her arm in half. &gt;&gt; Snapped the broke the bone in half. She went to the doctor down there. They said, "Oh, you got to have surgery. Emergency surgery." Said, "No, I ain't got no surgery down here. If I'm going to have surgery, I'm going to do when I get back home." They said, "Well, we going to wrap it up right now, but you need to go see a specialist or whatever." Before she left Florida, she said, "Lord, &gt;&gt; let it be healed before I get back home." [Music] [Applause] See, some of us don't pray like that &gt;&gt; cuz we got good insurance. &gt;&gt; So your faith don't step out. You're not willing to step out there. You got good Medicaid. You got good this, good that. All of it. Yes, sir. So you don't step out there. But what if you ain't got no insurance? What if you ain't got no bomb care? &gt;&gt; Sister, they got home. &gt;&gt; She went back to the doctor. They did the X-ray. Doctor looked at her arm. He's like, "Whoa." &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; It was broke in two places when she left. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. When she got examined back in Columbus, doctor said, "Whoa, looks like somebody already worked on your arm. The book is open. The revelation to healing is in the church. All the doctor could do a soft gas on it. No operation, no nothing. Hallelujah, &gt;&gt; church. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, we need to we need to step before God like there's nothing that he hasn't revealed to us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Everything is open unto us. The mystery of God has been revealed. Amen. See, I I think about this before I close. &gt;&gt; Take your time. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, &gt;&gt; "When you receive this word as eagle food, Amen. &gt;&gt; You have heard from your theophony. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I don't know about y'all, but I'm eating egoful. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So, I want you to catch what has been taking place with us. &gt;&gt; Our theophony, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; has come down to where we are. &gt;&gt; And before we know it, church, right now, what's happening? There's a blending taking place, a supernatural blending. And it's going to come a time when that theophony can no longer leave you. &gt;&gt; Listen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Listen what the prophet of God says. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He says, "And now." Oh my. Oh my. I need to I got to Oh my. He said, "Look. Then after you recognize that every word of God &gt;&gt; was eaglefooled, then you left the other things. You have then been formed into the living image of the living God. &gt;&gt; So do we understand what God has been doing through a message in our day? &gt;&gt; Just like he came down with a book open, he gave it to a prophet. What was he doing? Now that we have the book, he's been forming us into the living image of the living God. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; You heard from your the &gt;&gt; if this earthly body be dissolved, we have one waiting. You say, "Is that right, brother Brandon?" All right. He says, "All right, let's take a couple eagles and look at them." But let's drop down to this church. He says, "And now the logos that went out of God, which was the logos, hallelujah, all this be to form into a body shape." And this body shape was called, hallelujah, in the scholars teaching logos. The logos, hallelujah, went out to God. In other words, a better word for it was what we called a theophony. church. He says, "Oh my, not exactly with flesh, &gt;&gt; but &gt;&gt; hallelujah, not without flesh and blood like it will be it a glorified stage." Amen. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; if we have a theophony &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; and we've heard &gt;&gt; from our theophony &gt;&gt; and we perceive this message &gt;&gt; as eagle food. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Talk to me church. &gt;&gt; That means &gt;&gt; you are already glorified. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If the theophony is representation for heaven &gt;&gt; and you've heard of your theophony, you're connected with your theophony, that means you've already been there. &gt;&gt; That means you have representation there. &gt;&gt; That means that you have a glorified body waiting to connect with you. &gt;&gt; That's what's been open unto us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're not just church people. of God. &gt;&gt; I look &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I done told this testimony over and over again. I just can't stop it. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Go ahead, mama. &gt;&gt; About my friend who ran out of gas. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Ran out of gas in the middle of nowhere. wife home sleep about 2 3:00 in the morning. He said, "What am I going to do?" Say he ain't want to call and wake up. He had just got off from work. What I'm going to do, church, sometimes all we got to do is sit still. &gt;&gt; Because all you got to do is sit still &gt;&gt; and the mystery &gt;&gt; of what you should do next &gt;&gt; will open up to you. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; All you got to do is sit there a little bit and think on God. &gt;&gt; He said he was on the side of the He said he was on the side of the car. He went to the trunk. He said, "I didn't even have a gas cap. I mean a gas jug." Like, man, what I'm going to do? Say, "Look in there. Ain't nothing back there but water. &gt;&gt; Gallon of water. Yeah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A thought came &gt;&gt; was a scripture &gt;&gt; where God turn water &gt;&gt; into wine. &gt;&gt; What was he doing? He was opening up something. He said, "Lord, if you turn water into wine, &gt;&gt; you can turn water into gas." Church, he prayed a simple prayer. He didn't wait till the water changed colors. He didn't wait till the smell changed. He opened up the tank, pulled it in there, jumped in the car, drove all the way home. didn't need to stop at the gas station. Church, it's revealed to us. We ought to be able to bring God. &gt;&gt; It's too often &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.

And brother Digg's testimony is what, you know, told me I needed to go ahead and say it. But um there was a situation at my house with my toilet.

And brother Jojo end up coming out and he said it was nothing wrong with it at all. But as I was meditating upon it, the Lord had to remind me of what he gave brother Kelly. when brother Kelly said the uh that time the when brother Brandon was out there with the squirrels he said he his voice changed brother Brandon didn't pick it up quite cuz it was a change or something and when he brought that back to my mind I said okay but that's what happened and I just wanted to testify because you know the Lord is speaking through our pastor &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; and the ministry &gt;&gt; I'm sorry I just have to testify because I was praying and asking the Lord to make a way for me to testify. So, Brother Charles, thank you. God used you. So, I want to say I came to church, no energy. My head was feeling like it was going to explode and I'm like, Lord, I have to go on backup and sing.
