lord in our hearts we know that you've put something deep in there to love you back father to long for you father to cry have a father that we could know you not just as god above but lord as as our creator and father lord the one that cares so much for each of us there's not a person in this building lord that you don't know lord every thought everything about this person father i believe that each one here is loved by you father help us to respond to that love lord not to turn our back on you in any way lord but that we could just run to you father and fall at your feet and worship you lord for your worthy lord we thank you for the blood of calvary lord that there should be death to come into your presence lord we can come in life father we can come and celebrate this resurrection lord oh god thank you lord thank you lord have your way father move me aside and anoint these lips lord and anoint the ears of the here father that we could have a wonderful time in your presence lord that we could be quickened lord made alive today father may you receive all the glory and the honor lord for you alone are worthy we ask all these things in jesus mighty name amen it's good to be in the house of the lord amen thank you musicians let's um i'm just gonna start a little differently than i was going to just in the last minute i got just a feeling to do something different but brother why don't you just sit down a second and then we'll stand for the reading of the word just so we don't have you standing too long um we just got back from a big trip and we're really thankful to the lord for letting us go and letting us return and just god is good wherever we are whether we're here or halfway around the world his mercies are new every morning he never leaves us nor forsakes us he is a good god and uh just seeing him grant the desires of our hearts it's it's so so good and um brother aaron said well maybe you could share a little bit of a trip report and i'd like to maybe share some things sometimes but i don't feel to to really talk a lot about that but i want to show if possible just one picture and just one one thought that i have related to this picture and so while the brothers maybe could prepare to see if we can get that picture up i don't put it up just yet nope too late there we go there's a teaser a lot of you probably already know what that is um but here here's the thought that goes with this picture is we are in a battle whether we're here whether we're there whatever we do we're in a battle and we're near the end of the battle i do believe i do believe this battle has been raging for since i was before i was born but i believe we're we're coming to the culmination of all things we're coming to to the final victory we're getting we're getting close to something mighty and we don't battle against flesh and blood but we battle against principalities and powers and right now you're here you made an effort to draw near to god you're not here just to see people but you're here to hear from god you're here seeking him and the devil sees that you're here each one of you just like god sees each one of you that's here i don't know everybody but god knows everybody the devil sees you too and he's trying with everything that he's got to get you to turn on this to get you to walk away to get you to go back to the mud that you came from to get you to go to sin and and here's uh i'll just show this picture and and then we'll get to this little thought with the picture is uh let's let's show the picture and it's really one just if i could show one picture of the trip i'd show this because this was the thing that i i felt so privileged to see so privileged to be near is if you look there just over to the left-hand side of where lydia is that's what they think could be calvary the skull golgotha so if you look kind of just to the right of her shoulder you can see two depressions in the rock and those would be the eye sockets and then kind of in between them you can see where you might see a nose and so what they say is that they some people you know there's different opinions but a lot of people think that that's where they would have crucified him crucified our lord jesus would be at the foot of this hill and and uh you know what a place that you could let your mind go back to that day and and you could could just picture a small man with no beauty but just beating for you and me beating like no man's been beaten and and you could almost just you know we're there traveling we're happy but it's it's a somber place it's it's a i would say a holy irreverent place but then the thing that really surprised me you know i could see that before in my mind's eye i could see the cross in my mind's eye i could see the blood i could see the soldiers but what i never thought about until i got there which maybe you already knew but you can see behind us are buses this is all paved over and this is a bus parking lot this is where a lot of the the different buses to go to the different parts of the arab areas around there they the air people have a control over it and and they just decided let's pave over it let's just park a bus there and i thought wow that's you know what a what a what a thing to take this this place without comparison in the world and just drive over it drive over top of it and and it made me think if we can put up let's put up hebrews 10 26 this isn't my text so i'll have you stand for the text this let's let's just read this and we'll read um read here it says for if we sin willfully if we were to listen to those voices tell us to go back to give up to turn around and you know when you repent you turn around and if you repent of that repentance you're back the same way you were going that's i believe what it's talking here is to go back it says if we sin willfully after that we've received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins because you've turned your back on the sacrifice but a certain fearful looking of for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries he that despised moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses now here we're getting to what i thought of about this bus says of how much sore punishment suppose you shall he be thought worthy who has trod and underfoot the blood the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace and then let's let's jump down to the end it says in verse 38 and we'll read 39 it says now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back under perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul amen and so maybe you just can have that in your mind's eye that what we have is so precious what we have here you know i i couldn't imagine trampling that precious blood underfoot i wouldn't even want to park a bus on the spot where that blood was spilled but what god cares about way more than whether there's a bus there or not is whether you'll keep on keep up the good fight or whether you're turned back because if you turn back if you give up that's that's just the same as trampling that blood on your foot so i wasn't going to say any of that but maybe it's for somebody so just let's let's um let's just stand and we'll we'll go to my text here um let's go to ecclesiastes chapter 12 and we'll read the last two verses of the book of ecclesiastes aren't you glad to be in the house of the lord it's a good place to be let's just pray one more time father have your way bless these words forgot to read and inspire the lord to our hearts that we could draw near to you in jesus name amen so here we have a conclusion of the whole matter let's hear it let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear god and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of for god shall bring every work onto judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil and let's also go unto matthew chapter 10 verse 26 i wanted to in this verse look at that every secret thing and then in matthew 10 and 26 we'll read this one verse notice here in ecclesiastes it starts with fear god but then here it says fear them not therefore so we want to fear god but him alone but then here in matthew 10 26 it says fear them not therefore for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed and hid that shall not be known amen you may be seated okay so help me out a little bit here i've got a lot of uh things written down and not a lot of time so just uh just in your heart say to the lord speak to me and then i don't have to get any of my idea of what should happen done but god can speak to you and then we can go home and that'll be good too all right so we heard in ecclesiastes that god's going to bring every work into judgment every secret thing whether it be good or evil and then here in matthew we find that there's nothing hidden or there's nothing covered that won't be revealed and hid that won't be known and that's those are are quite some statements and so my title this morning if i were to give a title would be a question and the question is a simple one it's what are you hiding so do we have any volunteers who wants to who wants to come up and tell us all your secrets maybe brother dave fritz uh you want to come up and uh tell us all yours no he doesn't want to okay anybody else no everybody has secrets good secrets bad secrets the people they helped that no one knows about the times that they maybe spent all night praying for somebody the sacrifices they've made for their family for their loved ones the things that they've done the things that they've done today some are secret but here we find that they're secret only for a time but that every every secret eventually comes out that there's a there's a time there's there's a final judgment and even you know in this in this time though we're not quite that final judgment you just find that in this time we're living there aren't secrets like there used to be there's um you're being watched by by the supernatural realm but you're also being watched by the natural realm and there's uh you're carrying most of your care and a microphone everywhere you go most of you walk by surveillance cameras everywhere you go and and that's okay because that's just the natural showing that we're getting to this place in the spiritual where things are going to show what they really are and these these spirits that have been operating just all the way back they're coming to the point where they're they're bringing forth a good life and they're bringing forth a bad life they're bringing forth the life of christ and they're bringing forth the life of the antichrist and this is that that exciting final age where everything comes out but that's um that can be kind of scary too right um even if we if we um if we look at our age we believe is delayed a sea and age and we look at this um what the church looks like in the latest in age it actually says that it's naked you can't hide anything you know where it's this is the age without secrets so what secrets do you have what are you hiding what am i hiding what am i what are my good secrets what are my bad secrets what would we see if we played the record of your life you got to see one picture of the trip uh you didn't get to see the times on the you know all the other times on the trips where i was frustrated or sad or you know fighting with the kids wasting money because i don't understand the bus system you know there's a lot you don't see right but more than your actions what if we could get a transcript of your thoughts where we've been told that our thoughts are louder in heaven than our voices on earth it's important what we think and those starred in secret but see before you do something you think about it so the thought becomes and i a word and then it becomes an action and so a lot of times your thoughts that were secret the secret will be revealed even without anything other than the natural progression of what happens to a thought a thoughts of seed and so when when we're thinking on things we're planting these seeds that will be manifested and people i can't tell what you're thinking right now but i can get an idea of what you've been thinking by where you are in your life by the choices that you've made and and the way that you choose to conduct yourself and and the values that i can see that you're you're holding to is a way to see what somebody's thinking right um but for now we we hide a lot of that we um we hide the feelings of our hearts we hide a lot of pain and sorrow and and fears and doubts a lot of that gets hidden um our our true feelings what we love is hidden you can see like i said by by the actions uh where somebody's heart is but you can't look at somebody and know if they're keeping the two great commandments you can't look at them and know if they love the lord their god with all their heart soul and mind or if they love their neighbor as their self you can't know at that minute because maybe they didn't before and maybe they've just fallen in love and maybe what they look like doesn't show that they are fulfilling those commandments but in time that should show right if you do love the lord like that if you do love your neighbor like that that should be manifest and that's part of what this is talking about in matthew that that that inner part of your heart that love that you have in your heart if it's really love it will manifest not just by scanning your brain and hope or your heart oh yep it's in there but no everything every seed brings forth after its kind so we want to be very guarded of our hearts of of what we let in our hearts what we let in our minds what we let our earth where we let our thoughts go to um these are secrets now but they're not going to stay that way but it's very natural for us to hide things we've we sons and daughters of adam have been hiding things ever since the fall if you look the first thing that adam and eve did after they had sinned is they hid they hid themselves because they were ashamed and so that goes all the way back to eden this propensity that we have to hide from from god from each other from the light and this goes all the way to the end and in uh revelation you've got these great men rich men chief captains and mighty men and they're all saying to the rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb so all throughout its it's our our natural way is just to hide from god and sometimes you have people that are are really hiding you know out in the the caves and the rocks in the graveyards like legion and they just want nothing to do with with the things of god and and they're out hiding there but then you've also got people that are hiding in churches and they're hiding in in religion and they're they're hiding the darkness they're trying to hide the darkness from themselves and they're just trying to to cover over and and to take these dark secrets of death and sin and hatred and pride and lust and they're just trying to cover it over with some nice clothes and some good manners but jesus saw right through that and he talked to the pharisees and he said you may clean the outside of the cup and the platter but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness see christ the word sees right through that we can trick ourselves we can maybe trick everybody else but the word is is quick it's alive it's sharp and it cuts right through all of that jesus said beware of the leaven of the pharisees which is hypocrisy and that's something we've got to guard against something we've got to watch out against that we don't want to be so good at hiding that we just hide it until the end and then what was the point in the end you know we've only got one life we've got one chance to really run to that cross and wash our sins away now is the time of salvation now is that day and so we ought to just not hide it but just go to the calvary and let that blood cleanse it all away and you know lord help me i'm i'm preaching right to myself i don't want to be a hypocrite i don't want to just have some nice clothes in good manners but i want the lord to change me way down deep there's no hiding from god david knew this in um in the psalms he talks so many times about this moses knew this if we can put up psalm 90 verses 7 and 8 this is from the prayer of moses the man of god and so we look at moses as one of our heroes of faith but here part of moses prayer says for we are consumed by that anger and by thy wrath we are troubled thou hast set our iniquities before thee our secret sins in the light of thy countenance you know moses knew that there was really no hiding this from god so at the end in verse 12 he says teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts to wisdom you know help us by wisdom we've got this problem we've got these these sins that we can't deal with by ourselves we can't hide them so help us to number our days help us to look for wisdom i love us to look to the lord but really this this wasn't dealt with in the old testament this was only dealt with at calvary so you've got you've got this longing in david that's saying hide thy face from my sins and bought out all my iniquities this cry oh there needs to be something that will blot these out i covering these is not enough for god sees right through that but that took place on calvary if we'll we'll go to to colossians chapter 2 and verse 13 we'll go down to 15. it says in you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross he took your sins and he took my sins those that were the things that we were trying to hide the things that would have come up eventually anyway and he blotted all that out he spoiled principalities and powers made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it see for those things that we try to hide those things that we're so ashamed of he took our shame and he put it up there where everyone could see he said i'll tell your secret secret sin worthy of death and i'll wear it so for every secret there if you've come to calvary if you've accepted this atonement that that they longed for your secrets have been dealt with your debt has been paid your shame has already been taken care of surely he's borne our sin and carried our sorrows amen so thankful for that this was prophesied that there would be a fountain opened in the house of david not just some dry well that you could drop your brother in and he might show up again later but this is a cleansing fountain that just like that drop of ink that goes into the tub of bleach you can't even find it anymore those those sins those those secrets that that we had to hide that blood the power in that blood totally annihilates that that before before you come to calvary and before you you're washed in the blood you you've got all these secrets but if you've really gone and entered in okay read my record it's blank it's white it says pardoned even god doesn't remember them anymore when when god looks down and hears your prayer if you're praying through the blood he doesn't say well i sure have forgiven you a lot of times and you know this is your 9 000th sin of the day but i'm a good god i'll forgive it he looks at you as perfect he looks at you as spotless that your secrets have been dealt with but see until that happens there's such a fear of the light this is this is what john talks about where he says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god let's let's just read it let's put up john 1 1. well what while there before we go there let's go to genesis 1 2-4 we're talking about light and darkness here we're talking about these secret things that we hide in the dark and we're talking about the light of bringing it all out dealing with it and we see in in genesis 1 and 2 the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep so the genesis of this earth is this dark and and formless state and that's the state that we all started in in darkness but then in this pitiful state look what god does in the next verse or in the same verse the spirit of god moves on the face of the waters and god says let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that was good and then god is dividing the light from the darkness he's making a separation his word always comes to separate apart and that's where we get scared because we we know we started dark and we say well god is is separating the light from the darkness the sheep from the goats and what if all of me is just goat what if all of me is just dark and so we have that fear and that's why dropping down into john 3 19 it says that this is their condemnation that light has come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil and so when when you've got things to hide you cling to the darkness because that's that's safe that's a hiding place but god wants to send his light he wants to uncover everything and deal with it and say okay there's this darkness that you've got let my word cut that out of you let my word do surgery and and separate that darkness from that seed of god that's inside of you and so we go from from this state of being just so secretive so holding on to these things and being scared of the light to go in and being children of the light that in john 12 and 36 it says while you have light believe in the light that you may be the children of the light it says also in in colossians 1 and 12 giving thanks unto the father which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light who hath delivered us from the power of darkness hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins amen in in first corinthians chapter 6 verse 9 it talks it talks we'll read down to eleven first corinthians six nine to eleven talks about how we were when we're in this dark formless state but then listen how how this light has come it says know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers or extortioners shall i inherit the kingdom of god that just about covers most of it and such were some of you we had secrets we we had things in our hearts and our minds that were just so ungodly that we're so ashamed of but you are washed ye are sanctified ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god justified just as if you never did it let's read hebrews 10 [Music] 10 11. let's see it gets a little bit farther down okay let's read verse 11. well let's read 10 that's good too lord lord has a reason for it by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all by which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all and every priest standing daily ministering and offering often times the same sacrifices which can never take away sins let's go down verse 12 but this man after that he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down at the right hand of god from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool now verse 14 is what i want to emphasize here for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified forever can you put your name there them that are sanctified are you one of those you say for by one offering he hath perfected forever matthew mcfadden robert chicon naomi perfected forever can you put your name amen those things that we we hid so long and see these things that we hid caused us to hide it's related here the hiding of the thing versus the hiding of the person but we're going to get to some good news here i'm running out of time so i better better switch over here here soon but he's perfected forever and that are sanctified he said all in their sins and their iniquities i remember no more when god looks at you he sees the lamb he looks at christ and there's no fault in him amen and now we can't even sin let's go to first john 3 and we'll read from 1 down to 11. i know you know these things you've heard them before but it's good to be reminded of them because we're in that battle and the devil is trying to tell you oh you've got these secrets you've got these sins and these stains don't even come to church hide from god it's not working it is working just hold on to the promise amen behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed bonnie to us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of god now we've got to stay in the word of god to be reminded who we are what's going on there's so many different identities the world would try to put on you oh you're this you're that you're a failure you're a quack i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god maybe i'm still in some kinds of slavery maybe this flesh still is sometimes getting the better of me but that doesn't change whose son i am when i have a bad day i'm still a son i have a good day i'm a son now are we the sons of god and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear i believe that's very soon we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure whosoever committeth sin transgresseth transgresseth also the law for sin is the transgression of the law and you know that he was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin whosoever abideth in him we're going to get to that that's that's where we hide we used to hide from god now we hide in god we abide in him and when we're hiding in him then we're hiding something different in us than what we used to be hiding in us whosoever abideth in him oh that's where we are today can we just stay in him i just feel this is this is such an important part everything's trying to pull you out of christ to get you to go this way that way just stay in him stay in his presence just like the old tabernacle had the three courts there was the the court of the sacrifices you know a place to come and hear the word and eat there was the inner court where there was fellowship those were nice but now we're to live in in that inner court that holy of holies stay in the presence of the lord and that's where the battle is we all know that we all know okay that that's where life is is to stay there but are we are we seeking that with all our hearts is that our our our biggest goal on on the to-do list is just oh abide in him oh stay in his word stay in his spirit stay in that holy of holies that's what's important in this day is to be hid in him to abide in him for whosoever abideth in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth hath not seen him neither known him little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil whosoever is born of god can you put your name there brother aaron doth not commit sin can you say that can you put your name there for the david does not commit sin are you born of god can't say well i was kind of born of god either you were you weren't either you were born of the spirit you're a new creation you're a son you're a daughter of god or you're not don't let the devil talk you out of it if god has let you be born of his spirit then it says here you don't commit sin oh thank the lord i don't have to hide anymore i don't have things that i have to hide and now i don't have to hide but i can come into the light i can come where the saints of light are and i can rejoice together and say he took my sins away for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god amen and now look look where this goes from here we're on board here we say yes amen now look at this verse 10 in this the children of god are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of god neither he that loveth not his brother oh comes back every time those two great commandments love the lord thy god with all thy heart soul mind strength body everything you are love your neighbor as yourself can we do that for this is the message that you've heard from the beginning that we should love one another and if we're born of god here's what it is if we abide in him he says i in you and you and me it used to be we had these sins that were hiding so we hid ourselves now we hide in christ and hide him in us so now here now it becomes a lot more of a joyful thing if i if i call up a volunteer and say what are you hiding well now that you've had your your memory refreshed when you come up you don't have to say well i i was proud yesterday i was angry but now you can say i like to volunteer i'm hiding the life of christ in this jar of clay i'm hiding the spirit of god the creator i'm hiding unconditional love in here i'm hiding the power of forgiveness in here you might not see it all the time it's still hidden sometimes it still looks so foolish sometimes you know you go out to any of these parking lots you look at all the cars some are very expensive some are not so expensive some are nice some are not so nice if you walk through the parking lot you can't tell which of these are full of gas and which ones are empty that's something that's hidden a lot of times when you see people you can't tell right away whether they're hiding the life of jesus christ whether they're not but just like those cars in the parking lot it's going to make a difference the ones that are out of gas aren't going anywhere but we're going somewhere we're we're those people that are going to be found by faith or those people that are going to be found with oil in their lamps ready for the coming of the lord that we've hidden this treasure in our heart that we found this pearl of great price he said that's worth everything to me is that what you're hiding today is him are you hiding in him or hiding from him let's um let's go i want to read in second corinthians we'll start in verse uh second corinthians chapter four verse one and we're going to read quite a bit of this but it's just so good it's life to me it says therefore seeing we have this ministry as we've received mercy we faint not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth well there's so much in here just just let it sink in just let it minister to you this this truth used to be these dark secrets would would come out eventually these things that were kept secret suddenly it's revealed and it's destroying families it's destroying fellowship it's causing wreck and ruin now that we've renounced those hidden things of dishonesty now this manifestation of the truth is coming to be revealed and it's bringing fruit for people to eat it's bringing shade it's bringing faith it's bringing love it's bringing healing because what we're hiding is so different we're hiding the truth and just like the evil was going to be made manifest eventually this truth is is being made manifest commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of god but if our gospel be hid it's hid to them that are lost some people still can't see it it's hiding in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord that which we've hidden in our heart and ourselves your servants for jesus sake see what it does when you're really hiding in him and you're really hiding that it doesn't make you proud it makes you a servant i said brother sister what can i do for you and i've i can't preach that to you as something you don't have because you've you've ministered to me i've seen you all come and and be servants to one another and come and help us with our burdens and i'm so grateful for that i see this working in this body i see this working in your eyes and it's so encouraging the servants for jesus sake for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us here's what it looks like on the outside we're troubled on every side yet not distressed we're perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body of the dying of the lord jesus that the life falsehood of jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you we have in the same spirit of faith according to as it is written i believed and therefore have i spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus see here's what it's coming to you those things that were hidden they're going to come out right well this that's hidden in you that still lets you be perplexed and cast down and still look so foolish so many times it's it's gonna be manifest just like it raised christ it's gonna raise us it's gonna raise us in a newness of life in a demonstration of the power of the holy ghost that's going to raise us off of this world it's that same power it's got to do the same thing so raise up us also by jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes and the abundant grace that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of god for this cause we faint not for though our outer man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen but of the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal what are you hiding is jehovah god living in you for for your homework why don't you read chapter five let it read second corinthians chapter five and it continues on i could just continue going with it but it talks about this building of god a house not made with hands talks about appearing before the judgment seat of christ to receive the things that you've done whether bad or good it goes down and says if any man be in christ he's a new creature old things are passed away the old all things have become new and then in verse 20 it says be reconciled to god verse 21 says for it made for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him amen so that's what we're hiding we have this earnest of our inheritance there's going to be a redemption of the purchased possession we have this this seed gene of god inside of us and as i was studying i was just so amazed that there's so much in there that we're hiding that and it's not just a small thing but it's it's to the point that when when jesus sends the disciples out he says whosoever will not receive you nor hear your words shake the dust off your city it's not going to be it's going to be more tolerable for sodom and gomorrah than for them it says it's not you that speak it's the spirit of your father it says whosoever shall give to drink one of these little ones a cup of cold water in the name of the disciple he shall no eyes receive lose his reward so when you carry this it has a massive significance that people the way that they treat you is going to determine blessings or or no blessings for them that you're going forth as lights in this stage in this day and age now that you're not hiding in the darkness now that you've come into the light you're going and that which is hidden you can't stay hidden it's being manifested and that's what we're waiting for it says in romans 8 and 18 it says for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us do you believe that can you put your name there do you believe that there's a glory that shall be revealed in in rachel and martha in you know each one of you for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestations of the songs of god we're at that day where all the secrets are being revealed and this great secret that we've hidden it's got to come out so we can say like mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to your word it's not by our striving by our might and our power but it's by the spirit of god by entering into his rest by abiding in him no flesh is going to glory in his presence that's why he lets it be this way that he's got this treasure hidden in an earthen vessel that he still lets our our weaknesses show he still chooses the foolishness of preaching to have just flawed people come up and and somehow god can still speak to you because of of his spirit of his power of what he's doing let's let's read colossians chapter 3 and verse 1. it says if you then be risen with christ seek those things which are above for christ sitteth on the right hand of god set your affections on things above not on things of the earth for you are dead and your life is hid with christ and god when christ who is our life shall appear eventually you also appear with him in glory mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence and covetousness which is idolatry for which things seek the wrath of god cometh on the children of disobedience in which ye also walked sometime when you lived in them but now you have put off these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth there in verse 3 it says you're dead and your life is hid with christ in god if you want to to be blessed you might also listen there's the sermon a hidden life in christ and you've probably heard it before you've probably heard it preached before but i heard it again and it was such a blessing to me um i'll give you a little taste of it maybe to pique your interest here get you to read it let's let's have the musicians come maybe and play something softly and we'll kind of finish here it says notice every year the high priest entered into that place the congregation followed him up and he went into this great place where the veil dropped behind him the inner courts the holiest of holies no one dared to go after him then he was alone with god what a beautiful picture it is today of a consecrated life who once enters in to enter with christ dead to the things of the world hid away with god and the veils drop down around and all the worlds shut off then christianity and religion becomes a pleasure to every believer today people just have enough religion to make them miserable knowing they ought to do this they're trying to escape hell if that's the way i felt about it brother i don't know what i would do oh get in with christ shut off from the things of the world for to commune with him is a pleasure it's beautiful it's something that fills and satisfies the soul something that gives you peace that passes all understanding all the crosses become flying wings all the burdens are chariot wheels though you can fly away my burdens are light yoke up with him the oaks all padded with hallelujahs when you're once inside the veil with him he becomes your life the prophet said that in the days of old the people in old days said that he would write his laws anew he would put them in their heart now mount sinai was a place of duty but mount calvary was a place of grace people are trying still trying to live on mount sinai if i go to church if i pay my dues if i do this and that all i'll quit and stop that that's still on mount sinai but when you come to a place where you're dead and your life is hidden god through christ sealed by the holy ghost the whole christian life becomes a great glorious shout and a hallelujah to you and you're hid away daily now notice once in there he was isolated from the world the curtains dropped around him and he was hid away with god everything becomes real a glory in this place where we once get it hid away with christ everything becomes a new thing to us then oh brother why don't you stop that nonsense and come into the holy of holies holiest of holies by the blood of the lord jesus every bit of manna outside of here just lets you ask for tonight or tomorrow next week won't work it dries up overnight but if you ever consecrate yourself to come into where the man stays fresh day in day out year in year out in the holiest of holies you can meet a man that's ever walked in there i don't care if he hasn't had a revival for six months he's just as sweet as he was from the day he was in the revival that's right you can meet him on a shouty day or a cloudy day or whatsoever you want to he's just the same because he's living in the glory of god he's living where the man is fresh all the time where it isn't a burden to get out and pray through today and pray through tomorrow brother stay in stay with him all the time in the holiest of holies now here's a question can a person live that way he says absolutely that's what jesus died for amen can you put your name in that question can i live that way can peter live that way hidden christ abided in him absolutely that's what jesus died for [Music] we don't have to hide from god we don't have to be discouraged because we're looking on the outer things but we're looking on the inner things we're looking at that earnest that he's given us that down payment that holy ghost if you haven't received that holy ghost the bible says come let us reason together though your sins were a scarlet they shall be white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool you can come and receive that today if you haven't received that jesus said all that the father has given me shall come to me he that comes to me i will no wise cast out he said that if we would confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us all our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness he said we can cast all our cares on him for he cares for you so if you haven't come to that place where you're no longer hiding but that you're hit that you're no longer hiding your sin and shame but you're hiding that matchless son of god then come to him today come and cast your cares on him come in and reason with him that your sins will be washed away i believe many of us have have made that that step towards god and he's come and he's he's baptized us he's he's led us to be born again but for those of us that are there then [Music] now is this time where we're coming to the manifestation of the sons of god now there's this time where it's got to shine out and just like john the baptist the greatest man that had been born prior to christ said he said i must decrease he must increase i believe each one of us could say that same thing no matter where we're at we could just say oh god i don't want that [Music] that you've given me just to be a candle that's under a bushel but i want your perfect will i want to manifest that light let me decrease you could increase so i believe for each one of us there's there's more consecration that we can we can come and bring there's there's more that we can surrender that we could just abide in him there's more weights that we can set aside that he could be glorified that's what it's all about it's just that he'd have his way and be glorified i believe that there are hearts that are desiring that i don't believe that this is something that's foreign to you but i believe that not my words but his words i believe you you can just amen with all your heart you could say yes lord be it unto me according to your word yes i believe it i believe that's for me i believe i can put my name there [Music] let's let's just stand and pray father it's been good to be in your house lord i know that you're here and lord i i believe that each one that that asked you lord speak to me i believe that somehow you've spoken to them lord and i don't know lord what portion of the word was for each person lord i don't need to that's not my job but lord you said your word wouldn't return void so every word that you've sent out lord will accomplish something it will do something mighty for the kingdom lord whether it's to bring a son or daughter to repentance or to encourage them or or to call them to a greater commitment lord a more hidden life in you father it will accomplish that which it was sent to do i have full confidence in that lord for your word is quick and alive and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword father as we're here in your spirit lord we believe it's a good thing lord that just like the the the disciples were gathered together and they were in one accord and great things happened lord that you're that same pillar of fire came and fell lord it divided into tongues and it was on every one of them lord let it be so today this this morning that that that same pillar of fire would be divided on each one of us lord that each one of us would just surrender more our lives to you father that we could love you more and we could love our brother our sister more father forgive us the things that we've hidden lord that are not of you [Music] thank you that you paid the price for all those things lord whatever they are whatever they were lord that you'll remember them no more if we'll just come and bring them to that fountain opened in the house of david oh god let your fire fall baptize everyone pray and give you thanks in jesus name amen amen if you if you want to pray this is a house of prayer you're absolutely doing the right thing if you pray you can pray in your seat you can pray at the altar but just don't let this opportunity pass you by be in such a hurry to leave that you just would trample over that blood but just make sure your heart is is right with the lord worship him we're gonna sing some songs and whenever you feel to go god bless you give you a good day and go with you but we're just gonna stay and worship a little bit those that want to those that want to pray pray a little bit amen god bless you let's sing this song o rock of ages hide thou me [Music] oh [Music] rock of ages [Music] high me [Music] refuge [Music] when i stalk [Music] far far from the then i cry oh rock of ages he'll do it hi that's why he was cleft

[Music] oh rock of ages [Music] [Music] but the when life stuck there i wanna [Music] from thee then i cry oh rock of a [Music] i believe this is a very important part of the service this is your chance to react to the word to seek him with all your heart don't let this opportunity pass by if anybody would like to come it'd be my privilege to pray with you you don't have to come you can pray where you are but just go with god make sure you're hitting him amen as as our brother aaron comes let's let's sing there's a fountain open in the house of david i believe that there's a fountain [Music] there are streams of grace flowing down from calvary come now and receive let's sing it again oh there's a fountain open in the house [Music] come now and racing there's a fountain open in the

away my sins nothing but the blood of jesus what can make me whole again nothing but the blood of jesus oh precious is a flow that makes me white as snow [Music] oh precious [Music] [Applause] [Music] you know if you go by a field somewhere and there's a seed been planted and unless you're a farmer or somebody you that what you do you might know not not know what that seed is if you looked at it but the seed is going to bring forth that which what's in it right now around where we live is what fields are left there's a lot of cotton growing you see the farmers prepping the land and then you see the machinery putting the seed in the ground they do everything they can do to get it ready but god gives it life and it manifests what is and right now it's it's that harvest time this morning as we were leaving the house i looked at and i told my wife look at the flowers that first bloom from the cotton but they're looking for the cotton out of it and there's a people are hungry in in in wanting desiring to see the real life of jesus christ that seed's been planted in you let it grow let christ be paul simply said it this way and i it's one of the most profound yet simple statements christ in you the hope of glory and sometimes we go around and and i'm as guilty as anybody else if not more go around in all kinds of ways except for yielding to it and sending it be it unto me according to thy word that's what mary said be it unto me according to thy word let that be all our prayer not just because you're here in church today but because wherever you're at let me manifest because someone is longing to see a reality of christ and brother peter i know that's your heart and your desire to see then that's why you would give it out that way as i told brother lyle on wednesday night and he preached and i said now you're going to be tested on that you're going to be tried on what you hear what you receive and brother peter you'll be tested on that you'll be looked at but there's a promise if we'll yield will surrender will say here i am lord he will manifest that he said all that the father has given me will come and i shall not lose the one of them are you one of those today are you know do you know you're one of those today are you embarrassed put your hand up and say i'm one of them lord that's me i claim that promise i will be there today lord sometimes the word comes in in our flesh it's hard but the breaking of the ground the fellow ground lord it takes it takes a effort and a force to break it open but down in there lord there's life and that life will come forth the life of christ in us lord so many have gone to church and they've gone to this religion and they've gone to this idea and this training to try to find some happiness some happiness some something in life that they would say it's worth it they go from one to another to another place to the latest the latest advertisement the newest fashion lord trying to find that lord but it's always been the same it has never changed it's christ in us the hope of glory lord and that's our desire today lord for it's through the blood we can come into your presence lord you crud out it is
