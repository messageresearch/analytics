[34:25] I'm grateful
[34:27] for uh
[34:28] brother Ryan's service this morning I
[34:31] didn't know him very well but I felt
[34:33] like the Lord was leading to have him
[34:36] minister to us and wow it as as I said
[34:39] this morning
[34:40] my uh
[34:43] thoughts and ideas were far exceeded
[34:46] as he preached and then three more
[34:49] baptisms it's every Sunday more and more
[34:54] people are coming in and these aren't
[34:56] just kids getting old enough to be
[34:58] baptized these are people giving their
[35:00] hearts to the Lord that have never been
[35:02] in church before
[35:04] and what a blessing that when I was up
[35:06] there this morning oh these these
[35:10] brothers up there seeing the tenderness
[35:13] in these hardened men
[35:17] and and as I was talking with them
[35:19] before baptism
[35:22] saying do you understand what you're
[35:24] doing
[35:26] and just seeing the the lips quiver
[35:30] and the tenderness of that those that
[35:33] those
[35:34] manly men and seeing just the sweetness
[35:39] and The Tender Hearts and how that they
[35:43] wanted to give their hearts to the Lord
[35:46] Jesus and how they did
[35:49] and then making that step in baptism to
[35:52] go up there and
[35:53] before all of these people get baptized
[35:58] never take these things for granted
[36:01] and how often we are seeing these more
[36:04] and more and more people coming in and
[36:06] being baptized never take it for granted
[36:11] and another Soul another two Souls
[36:13] another three Souls like this morning
[36:14] and then it was last week and the week
[36:16] before and over and over more and more
[36:18] never take it for granted friends and
[36:20] it's on this this Sunday night you see
[36:22] that this morning
[36:24] we were full and and now tonight and
[36:27] we're very very few people here
[36:30] but let me tell you these are the
[36:32] pillars in the church
[36:35] that are here tonight the ones holding
[36:38] up
[36:39] the church and making it to where others
[36:41] can coming come in and giving them that
[36:44] right hand of fellowship and treating
[36:46] them with kindness and love
[36:49] and not with a judgmental or a mean
[36:51] spirit
[36:53] treating them with love and compassion
[36:55] and that's why they want to come back
[36:57] they want something that we have and you
[37:01] know what that something is
[37:04] Jesus
[37:05] and the Bible says that God is love
[37:08] Jesus is the very love of God
[37:10] personified
[37:12] feel good tonight

[39:48] brother Lyle brought this in
[39:51] what this is
[39:52] I'm not going to pass it around because
[39:54] inevitably it would come back broken
[39:57] um but this is made of alabaster
[40:01] so this is what it looks like
[40:04] and you can see
[40:08] that it's
[40:10] you can scratch it with your fingernail
[40:13] very very soft and this is what I assume
[40:18] brother Lyle what this
[40:20] Mary it was probably her name that she
[40:23] had her oil in this Alabaster Box
[40:27] made here very easy to break but very
[40:30] very like I said I can scratch it with
[40:31] my fingernail very soft and easy easy to
[40:35] make and as a brother said this morning
[40:38] he said
[40:40] it's we need to break it
[40:42] you know that it's what's important is
[40:44] inside and it and it's not
[40:47] the important part isn't the box and we
[40:49] we decorate the box and and make it
[40:52] really nice
[40:54] but the thing of value is inside
[40:57] so brother Lyle thank you thank you for
[40:59] bringing that in it
[41:01] um
[41:02] as I said it's it's uh soft and
[41:05] back then it probably would wouldn't be
[41:07] worth much but the oil inside was worth
[41:11] a whole lot
[41:14] this Acts chapter 25 or Acts chapter 26
[41:17] let's start brother Jeremy if you could
[41:20] put up Acts 25 23 so we'll go to the
[41:23] previous chapter so we'll know what's
[41:25] going on here
[41:27] and
[41:29] for our visitors we've been going
[41:30] through this book of Acts and we're
[41:32] almost done
[41:33] and we started with
[41:36] Acts chapter 1 and when the Lord Jesus
[41:40] gives his instructions in Acts 22 the
[41:43] day of pen or Acts 2 the day of
[41:46] Pentecost and we have come all the way
[41:48] to this point and brother Lyle Johnson
[41:50] and I have been going back and forth
[41:52] with teaching this Bible study usually
[41:54] on Wednesday nights and it has just been
[41:58] um at least for brother Lyle and me it's
[42:00] been a great blessing and I pray that
[42:01] that blessing has come a little bit from
[42:04] this Pulpit to the others and the
[42:05] understood a little bit more about this
[42:07] Acts so Acts chapter 25 verse 23 it says
[42:11] this and on the morrow now Paul is
[42:14] coming
[42:15] for the fourth trial the Apostle Paul
[42:19] um he's constantly being persecuted by
[42:22] his own people the Jews and he's been
[42:24] brought to trial over and over and over
[42:26] again and I believe this is the fourth
[42:28] time
[42:29] that the Apostle is brought to trial and
[42:31] this time it is before two people those
[42:35] people are Agrippa
[42:39] and Festus
[42:41] and let's
[42:43] get started on that and on tomorrow
[42:47] when agripple was come and Bernice with
[42:50] great pomp
[42:51] and was entered into the place of
[42:53] hearing with the chief captains and
[42:55] principal men of the city
[42:57] at festus's commandment Paul was brought
[43:01] forth
[43:02] now brother Lyle explained in the in the
[43:05] previous Bible study we had he explained
[43:07] who this this Agrippa is and this
[43:11] Agrippa is Herod Agrippa the second
[43:15] now Herod Agrippa
[43:18] has very bad genetics
[43:21] he's um
[43:23] he's the son
[43:26] of Herod Agrippa the first
[43:29] he's the one that had the Apostle James
[43:31] beheaded
[43:33] he's the one that gave the speech
[43:36] and if you remember he gave the speech
[43:38] and everybody's like oh wow he speaks
[43:40] like a God and because he didn't give
[43:43] God credit for that speech
[43:46] he died and the Bible says he was eaten
[43:48] of worms
[43:50] pretty bad death
[43:53] so that's that's Agrippa and his grandpa
[43:56] was this guy Herod Antipas
[43:59] now Herod
[44:02] married his married Antipas married his
[44:04] brother's wife
[44:06] and he was so enamored with his
[44:08] stepdaughter when she danced before him
[44:11] creepy story but he was so enamored with
[44:14] his stepdaughter when she danced in
[44:16] front of him that he said hey I will
[44:18] give you I love your dancing I'll give
[44:20] you anything that you ask for
[44:23] so this young lady his stepdaughter goes
[44:26] to her mother
[44:27] herod's
[44:29] wife who he took
[44:32] from his brother
[44:34] and she hated him
[44:37] she hated this man John the Baptist so
[44:39] much she tells her her daughter go tell
[44:43] Antipas
[44:45] that you want the head of John the
[44:46] Baptist on a platter
[44:49] so then
[44:50] he kills John the Baptist
[44:53] and then
[44:55] that was
[44:56] the the grandpa and then the great
[44:59] grandpa of this this
[45:02] um man that we're talking about now
[45:05] was Herod the Great
[45:07] Herod the Great wasn't so great
[45:09] Herod the Great was the the great
[45:12] builder that built up the temple and
[45:14] built all the buildings and everything
[45:15] in Jerusalem but he's also the one that
[45:17] killed all the babies when the wise men
[45:19] came and said that this Prophecy of the
[45:23] Messiah was going to be fulfilled and he
[45:25] got afraid and he killed all all the
[45:26] babies
[45:27] so that's who
[45:29] is is coming here before the Apostle
[45:33] Paul and he came he comes with this this
[45:36] lady this woman
[45:39] named Bernice
[45:42] um
[45:43] Bernice wasn't such a great person
[45:44] either that was his sister
[45:47] she has basically the same genetics as
[45:50] her brother and um
[45:53] their relationship between Bernice and
[45:58] uh
[45:59] this
[46:01] Herod it wasn't
[46:04] like a brother and sister it wasn't
[46:06] platonic
[46:08] so it was it was just everything was all
[46:10] messed up in this whole thing and this
[46:13] Bernice in in uh
[46:15] josephus's writings which brother Lyle
[46:17] and I have quoted quite a few times this
[46:20] this Bernice is she ends up
[46:25] um she's married a couple times and I
[46:26] think her husband's died or are they
[46:28] divorced and then she ends up dating
[46:31] this guy named Titus this guy named
[46:34] Titus comes to help his um his dad who
[46:37] is a general and I think the dad's name
[46:39] was Vespasian I could be wrong about
[46:41] that but I think the general this Roman
[46:43] general this this Roman's name was Titus
[46:46] this man Titus is that this Bernice is
[46:50] dating is actually the Titus
[46:53] that fulfilled the prophecy that the
[46:57] Lord Jesus gave when he said about
[46:59] Jerusalem not one stone will be left on
[47:01] another
[47:03] this man Titus was the one that
[47:05] destroyed Jerusalem
[47:07] so it's all bad
[47:10] everything's bad in the history
[47:12] everything's bad these people coming
[47:14] before Paul here to judge him it's it's
[47:18] just not such a great group of people
[47:21] that are going to be sitting in the sun
[47:23] the Judgment seat for the Apostle Paul
[47:26] as he comes to trial
[47:28] verse number 24. and Festus said
[47:32] King Agrippa that's Herod Agrippa the
[47:34] second king Agrippa
[47:37] and all men which are here present with
[47:40] us ye see this
[47:43] man about whom all the multitude of the
[47:46] Jews have dealt with me both at
[47:48] Jerusalem and also here crying that he
[47:50] ought not to live any longer
[47:52] but when I found that he had committed
[47:54] nothing worthy of death
[47:57] and that he himself had appeared and
[47:59] appealed to Augustus that Caesar I have
[48:02] determined to send him
[48:04] of whom I have no certain thing to write
[48:06] unto my Lord whereof I have brought him
[48:10] forth before you and especially before
[48:13] thee O King Agrippa that after
[48:16] examination had I might have somewhat to
[48:21] write
[48:22] for it seemeth to me unreasonable
[48:25] to send a prisoner and not with all
[48:28] to signify the cries the crimes laid
[48:32] against him so Festus is trying here to
[48:34] get Agrippa to do the Dirty Work to the
[48:37] Apostle Paul because basically Festus is
[48:40] saying he hasn't done anything wrong
[48:42] so I'm going to bring him to you
[48:46] verse number one Acts chapter 26.
[48:51] then Agrippa said unto Paul
[48:54] Thou Art permitted to speak for thyself
[48:57] remember Paul is a Roman
[48:59] so he has certain rights as a Roman and
[49:02] one of those rights is to be able to
[49:03] give his own testimony his own witness
[49:06] then Paul stretched forth the hand
[49:09] and answered for himself
[49:12] we've learned later that Paul's hands
[49:15] were bound
[49:17] so I wonder how he raised his hands here
[49:22] and beckon the people to listen he says
[49:25] this I think myself happy King Agrippa
[49:28] because I shall answer for myself this
[49:32] day
[49:33] before thee touching all things where
[49:35] I'm accused of of the Jews Paul is not
[49:38] afraid
[49:40] especially because I Know Thee to be an
[49:42] expert in all customs and questions
[49:44] which are among the Jews wherefore I
[49:47] beseech thee to hear me patiently
[49:50] so he's saying here that Agrippa is well
[49:52] versed
[49:53] in all the Jewish Customs because
[49:55] Agrippa himself
[49:57] is a Jew kind of
[50:00] my manner of life for my youth
[50:03] which was at the beginning at the first
[50:05] among my own Nation at Jerusalem know
[50:09] all the Jews my manner of life from my
[50:12] youth which was at the first among my
[50:15] own Nation know all the Jews so
[50:16] everybody knows me and everybody knows
[50:19] where I came from everybody all of these
[50:21] people that want to kill me they all
[50:22] know my history
[50:25] which knew me from the beginning if they
[50:28] would testify
[50:30] that after the most straightest sect of
[50:32] our religion I lived a Pharisee now he's
[50:34] got a little dig in here
[50:36] because remember there's nobody
[50:37] testifying against Paul
[50:41] because there's no Witnesses in Roman
[50:43] law would say that these Witnesses if
[50:46] they if they're not just and true then
[50:49] they will suffer persecution so nobody
[50:51] stands up to to witness against Paul
[50:53] nobody's testify testifying against him
[50:56] but here he is
[51:01] and now I stand and am judged for the
[51:05] hope of the promise made of God unto our
[51:07] fathers
[51:09] this hope of the promise made
[51:12] of God under our fathers he is referring
[51:16] here to the Messiah
[51:19] that was to come
[51:23] unto which
[51:24] promise our 12 tribes instantly serving
[51:28] God day and night hope to come for which
[51:31] Hope's Sake O King Agrippa I am accused
[51:34] of the Jews why should it be
[51:37] thought a thing incredible with you that
[51:40] God should raise the Dead
[51:43] so Agrippa you're a Jew you know the
[51:45] story of this Christ you should know
[51:47] that God can raise the Dead
[51:50] you should know that there is a
[51:52] resurrection
[51:54] I verily thought
[51:56] with myself that I ought to do many
[51:59] things contrary to the name of Jesus of
[52:03] Nazareth
[52:05] now
[52:07] what Paul is about to do
[52:11] is something that is extremely extremely
[52:15] important for all of us to understand
[52:19] so Paul is coming here he's brought
[52:22] before this King
[52:24] and he in this this manifestus and in
[52:27] this King and and his sister and they're
[52:30] sitting in the Judgment seat and what
[52:32] does Paul do when he comes before them
[52:35] Paul gives his testimony
[52:40] next Sunday night
[52:43] we're going to have a testimony service
[52:45] and I'd like everybody to come I think
[52:48] it's going to be a real blessing we see
[52:51] that we were as I said before we were
[52:53] talking around the campfire
[52:56] um up up at our camp last weekend and
[53:00] the question I asked the question what
[53:02] what would encourage you to come more on
[53:05] Sunday night and more more on Wednesday
[53:06] what's important to you and the answer
[53:08] came back and it was a consensus we
[53:11] would like to hear more testimonies we'd
[53:13] like to like to be able to uh to take
[53:16] these things and apply them to our own
[53:18] lives and here Paul Paul is life is on
[53:21] the line
[53:22] he's about to be condemned to death
[53:25] and he doesn't go into Doctrine and say
[53:28] well Moses taught this and Abraham
[53:30] taught this and and this is where the
[53:32] Messiah is supposed to come and here's
[53:33] how he is Paul goes and he gives his own
[53:36] testimony
[53:37] he says here's what happened to me
[53:40] and I want to talk for a few minutes
[53:42] before we get back into Paul's Paul's
[53:45] um his testimony that friends we all
[53:48] need to have a testimony
[53:51] every one of us needs to have a
[53:53] testimony and that testimony is not what
[53:56] Paul's testimony was before that oh God
[53:59] sent a prophet or I believe this Bible I
[54:03] read my Bible every day or I listen to
[54:05] sermons I listen to tapes and I believe
[54:08] all these things that's not a testimony
[54:12] the testimony that you need to have is
[54:15] here is how I met Jesus Christ myself
[54:19] that is a testimony
[54:23] Paul had the same so-called testimony as
[54:28] he was growing up from a young child he
[54:31] believed the message of the prophets he
[54:33] was a Pharisee he believed all of the
[54:35] prophets with everything that he had he
[54:37] that was his testimony but he had not
[54:40] met Christ yet
[54:42] he had not met the Messiah
[54:45] and we need to be careful as Christians
[54:48] that we don't have a testimony
[54:53] and you say well
[54:56] I grew up
[54:58] and and I've always believed this and
[55:01] and I've always and I've always held
[55:04] this Bible and the highest esteem and I
[55:06] believe Jesus and and and I believe he
[55:10] sent a prophet and I believe all these
[55:11] things but have you met him
[55:17] think about that question
[55:19] do you have a testimony
[55:24] here's how I met Christ me
[55:27] if you came before this King Agrippa
[55:32] and you had to give a testimony
[55:36] what would it be
[55:39] would it be that I met Christ myself
[55:44] brother Branham said
[55:46] one time and he was quoting the Bible
[55:48] people say that that
[55:51] that um they have they've had an
[55:54] experience or not that they've had an
[55:56] experience but they believe and brother
[55:58] Branham responded with can a woman give
[56:02] birth
[56:04] and not know that she just gave birth
[56:08] and that is the new birth
[56:10] that is our testimony when I met Jesus
[56:14] Christ my life changed I met him
[56:19] personally and if you say well I've been
[56:21] growing up and I've always been a good
[56:23] person and I love the Lord but have you
[56:26] met him
[56:28] I cannot over emphasize how important
[56:31] that is have you met Christ yourself we
[56:36] hear so much of a about a personal
[56:38] relationship
[56:41] how can you have a personal relationship
[56:43] with someone that you have never met
[56:47] he's real
[56:49] Jesus Christ is real he died he rose
[56:53] again his Spirit came down at the day of
[56:56] Pentecost he entered into people they
[56:58] met him Cornelius the the Centurion the
[57:02] Gentile he met Christ he was filled with
[57:04] the Holy Ghost the all of the others
[57:07] disciples were filled with the Holy
[57:09] Spirit they met Christ they had the new
[57:12] birth
[57:14] so they have a testimony
[57:18] but I ask all of us do we have
[57:20] a testimony
[57:23] do our children
[57:25] have a testimony
[57:27] we protect them
[57:28] the best that we can
[57:30] we want to build a wall around them and
[57:33] and take care of them and and say none
[57:36] of this and none of this and cut
[57:37] everything out and and just protect them
[57:40] and then we see so often as soon as they
[57:43] get a little bit of Freedom they fly
[57:45] right into sin
[57:47] why is that
[57:49] because they don't have a testimony yet
[57:53] we do everything that we can to protect
[57:55] them and we want to protect them
[57:57] but we have we have to encourage them
[58:00] you have to know Christ yourself it's
[58:04] not what you don't do for Christ that
[58:06] matters
[58:07] it's what you do for Christ
[58:10] Paul here is saying he's going to give
[58:12] his testimony he's going to say this is
[58:14] what happened to me and no testimony let
[58:17] me tell you something no testimony is
[58:18] any greater than any others
[58:20] every one of us should have a testimony
[58:24] equal to Paul's this is when I met
[58:26] Christ
[58:27] it may not be that you got knocked off a
[58:29] horse and you went blind and you got
[58:30] healed and and then a a man with a
[58:33] prophetic gift in his life came and
[58:34] prayed for you and you you received your
[58:36] sight it may not be that but it's just
[58:38] as important whatever your testimony is
[58:41] and as parents
[58:43] raising our children
[58:46] we protect them watch over them do
[58:49] everything we can but they have to have
[58:52] their own relationship with God with
[58:56] Christ and we see it so often if they
[58:58] don't get it they leave
[59:02] and it's not because they fell away it's
[59:04] not because of they're not predestined
[59:07] or whatever nonsense that you hear it's
[59:09] because they didn't have a testimony yet
[59:12] they didn't meet Christ yet
[59:16] one of the best things I did without
[59:18] with with my children
[59:20] Stephanie and I we raise them we
[59:23] homeschooled them we didn't let them
[59:25] play with the neighbor kids
[59:27] we never went to movies we didn't we
[59:29] didn't have a television we didn't have
[59:31] any of that yet they still sinned
[59:34] why
[59:37] it was because they had not met Christ
[59:40] themselves
[59:41] no matter what you do
[59:43] no matter how much you try to protect
[59:45] them
[59:46] it will fail unless they meet Christ
[59:50] they must know the Lord Jesus that
[59:55] should be the center part of every
[59:57] family you meet him one of the best
[59:59] things I did in raising our children and
[1:00:01] it was hard for me to do
[1:00:04] you talk about legalistic this guy was
[1:00:08] legalistic
[1:00:10] and everything that we did
[1:00:13] and I and and I tell you the truth I
[1:00:15] would I change the way I did things I
[1:00:17] don't know what I would change
[1:00:20] but one of the best things I did and
[1:00:21] it's hard for me as I started telling my
[1:00:24] kids
[1:00:25] I want you to make that decision
[1:00:29] and they're like Oh Daddy just tell us
[1:00:31] what to do you know we don't want to do
[1:00:33] that you know and it's like and then
[1:00:35] Daniel
[1:00:37] I tell the kid I did not he want to go
[1:00:40] snowboarding with some of his friends
[1:00:43] didn't want him to go
[1:00:45] and I said well Bob
[1:00:49] I said you're going to have to make that
[1:00:51] decision does this please the Lord
[1:00:54] and he took it seriously
[1:00:57] and you know what he came back with
[1:01:00] yeah Dad it's okay if I go
[1:01:03] I was like wait wait
[1:01:05] I don't want you to go
[1:01:09] but he made that decision
[1:01:12] and he went and it was okay
[1:01:15] it went well and then I saw from that
[1:01:18] point on I see my children start to grow
[1:01:21] in their relationship with the Lord not
[1:01:23] because it was dad's decision anymore
[1:01:26] but it was because their decision
[1:01:29] and they had to suffer the consequences
[1:01:33] but it was their decision that they made
[1:01:36] and and it it came back on them
[1:01:40] and I saw
[1:01:42] that now they weren't relying on Dad
[1:01:44] anymore
[1:01:46] or Mom
[1:01:47] they were relying on their walk with the
[1:01:50] Lord did they make mistakes yes
[1:01:54] but it built and built and built
[1:01:59] let's read Romans 10.
[1:02:03] um Romans 10 13. I'd like to throw this
[1:02:06] in there
[1:02:08] Romans 10 13 the Apostle who's about to
[1:02:11] give his testimony
[1:02:12] he writes this to the church that was in
[1:02:15] Rome he says for whosoever shall call
[1:02:18] upon the name of the Lord shall be saved
[1:02:22] how then shall they call on him in whom
[1:02:25] they have not believed
[1:02:30] and how shall they believe in him of
[1:02:33] whom they have not heard
[1:02:36] and how shall they hear without a
[1:02:40] preacher now I know many many ministers
[1:02:43] will take that that
[1:02:45] scripture and they'll say oh see this is
[1:02:47] why we need the fivefold ministry
[1:02:49] because you've got to hear it from the
[1:02:50] pulpit and this wait a minute
[1:02:53] you're a preacher every day is your mama
[1:02:58] needs to be telling those kids all the
[1:03:00] time about the Lord Jesus Daddy needs to
[1:03:03] be telling them
[1:03:04] those are your preachers that they're
[1:03:06] always there always telling you it yes
[1:03:09] it needs to come from the pulpit but it
[1:03:10] needs to come from Mom it needs to come
[1:03:12] from Dad it needs to come from your
[1:03:13] brothers and your sisters it needs to
[1:03:15] come from your friends always talking
[1:03:18] about the lord always encouraging to you
[1:03:21] have your relationship with the Lord
[1:03:25] it will fail if you don't have a
[1:03:29] relationship with him if you don't have
[1:03:32] a testimony of how you met the Lord it
[1:03:36] will fail
[1:03:38] you must know Christ yourself
[1:03:42] Paul grew up
[1:03:46] he he grew up as a young man and he was
[1:03:49] always taught this Pharisee faith
[1:03:52] he's always taught to believe the
[1:03:54] message and to do as the prophets say
[1:03:56] and he did he did his best
[1:03:59] following exactly what the Bible said
[1:04:04] but he had not had that relationship
[1:04:07] with the Messiah yet he didn't know
[1:04:08] anything about it
[1:04:11] and I feel like so many people in the in
[1:04:15] in the message
[1:04:17] listen just because you know the God
[1:04:20] sent a prophet as our brother said this
[1:04:22] morning just because you believe him
[1:04:25] the Devils believe him too
[1:04:27] he's been let me tell you brother
[1:04:29] Branham kicked more Devils out of the
[1:04:31] church
[1:04:32] through through
[1:04:34] healings and casting out Devils they
[1:04:37] know him very well
[1:04:39] and they know he's a prophet so just
[1:04:41] because we know
[1:04:45] that God sent a prophet or just because
[1:04:47] we believe this Bible the devil believes
[1:04:50] this Bible also
[1:04:52] but we must know Jesus
[1:04:56] we need to have met him what was he said
[1:04:58] Jesus says one time he says many will
[1:05:01] come in my name
[1:05:03] Jesus Jesus name
[1:05:06] many will come in my name and said Lord
[1:05:08] did not I cast out devils in your name
[1:05:11] did I not I heal the sick did not not do
[1:05:14] this all these great works and Jesus
[1:05:17] will say depart from me get out I never
[1:05:19] knew you
[1:05:21] how could that be
[1:05:23] depart for me I never knew you
[1:05:27] speaking in Jesus name doing great
[1:05:29] things in Jesus name and he doesn't even
[1:05:31] know them
[1:05:33] think about it
[1:05:34] is that me
[1:05:36] is that you
[1:05:38] do you have a testimony
[1:05:41] have you met him
[1:05:46] when you come before when I come before
[1:05:48] the Lord Jesus
[1:05:51] am I going to be able to say Lord I met
[1:05:53] you on this day
[1:05:55] I met you here I sought you my whole
[1:05:58] life and you came to me Lord I had that
[1:06:01] experience I was I had that new birth I
[1:06:04] know you I'm a sinner of course
[1:06:06] deserving of hell but I know you
[1:06:10] and Jesus will say I know you
[1:06:13] I knew this person
[1:06:15] he or she gave her his or her life to me
[1:06:19] I met them
[1:06:21] in this case on the road to Damascus
[1:06:24] this Apostle Paul
[1:06:27] if they don't have that we can protect
[1:06:30] them as much as you can always
[1:06:36] we can build a wall
[1:06:38] around our children
[1:06:40] and it'll sneak in
[1:06:43] it'll sneak in through this
[1:06:46] this is this is the worst thing that we
[1:06:48] have and it sneaks in you think you're
[1:06:50] gonna protect your kids from it you're
[1:06:52] not
[1:06:53] it's going to come in
[1:06:56] and unless they have that testimony I
[1:07:01] met Christ I met God I know I am his I
[1:07:06] was baptized I I I'm here to serve him
[1:07:09] yes I sin but I know him
[1:07:13] unless we have that testimony
[1:07:15] and there are many people
[1:07:17] brothers and sisters there are many 70
[1:07:20] 80 year old people
[1:07:23] in this church and in every other
[1:07:25] Christian Church around the country
[1:07:28] around the world that don't know Christ
[1:07:32] they know a religion they know a message
[1:07:35] they know a Bible but they haven't met
[1:07:38] him personally
[1:07:40] the thing that meant the most to the
[1:07:43] Apostle Paul his life is on the line was
[1:07:46] his testimony
[1:07:51] it says this
[1:07:57] remember
[1:07:58] Paul
[1:08:00] was raised as a Pharisee
[1:08:02] he was raised to believe the Bible
[1:08:06] when Paul had his testimony when Paul
[1:08:08] had his conversion when Paul had his
[1:08:11] experience
[1:08:12] let me ask you this did he throw out
[1:08:14] everything that he learned in the Bible
[1:08:17] did he throw out when Moses said
[1:08:20] did he throw out what the prophet said
[1:08:22] no
[1:08:24] he never said he he never contradicted
[1:08:27] what any of the prophets said ever
[1:08:32] but now he knew why they said it
[1:08:38] Paul says this in verse 10.
[1:08:41] which thing I also did in Jerusalem
[1:08:45] and many of the Saints did I shut up in
[1:08:48] prison
[1:08:49] having received Authority from the chief
[1:08:51] priests did I skip a verse
[1:08:54] no verse 10.
[1:08:57] which thing I also did in Jerusalem
[1:09:00] and many of the Saints did I shut up in
[1:09:03] prison having received Authority from
[1:09:05] the chief priests and when they were put
[1:09:07] to death I gave my voice against them
[1:09:10] these Christians
[1:09:13] God's people
[1:09:15] I Paul
[1:09:17] persecuted them
[1:09:19] my voice was one that rang out against
[1:09:23] them
[1:09:27] I am
[1:09:29] Paul is saying I am that sinner Agrippa
[1:09:33] I'm the one that hated these people
[1:09:35] because they didn't believe like me
[1:09:38] I'm the one that hated these Christians
[1:09:40] I'm the one that wanted to put them to
[1:09:43] death think about how much you believe
[1:09:44] your religion
[1:09:47] would you take it as seriously enough to
[1:09:49] put somebody to death
[1:09:52] Paul did
[1:09:53] he was zealous for what he believed
[1:09:56] he was sincere and he was sincerely
[1:09:58] wrong
[1:10:00] and how he believed
[1:10:08] and I punished them often every
[1:10:10] synagogue and compelled them to
[1:10:12] blaspheme and being exceedingly mad
[1:10:14] against them I persecuted them even
[1:10:16] under strange cities those strains that
[1:10:18] means foreign cities
[1:10:23] look at Paul
[1:10:24] he said I compelled them to blaspheme
[1:10:29] the Pharisee that he was
[1:10:32] and Paul was encouraging them to sin
[1:10:36] even in his legalistic religion even in
[1:10:40] everything that he had taught from the
[1:10:42] prophets Paul said I compelled them to
[1:10:45] blaspheme
[1:10:48] what a statement
[1:10:51] from the apostle
[1:10:54] sitting under gamalia
[1:10:56] the greatest of the teachers
[1:11:01] Paul says I compelled him to blaspheme
[1:11:05] whereupon as I went to Damascus with
[1:11:09] authority and commission from the chief
[1:11:11] priests at midday O King I saw in the
[1:11:14] way a light from heaven above the
[1:11:17] brightness of the sun shining round
[1:11:19] about me and them which journeyed with
[1:11:22] me
[1:11:24] and when we were we're all Fallen to the
[1:11:28] earth I Heard a Voice speak unto me and
[1:11:31] sang in the Hebrew tongue
[1:11:33] saw Saul why persecute us thou me it is
[1:11:37] hard for thee to kick against the pricks
[1:11:41] friends always
[1:11:42] praying about
[1:11:44] moving and
[1:11:46] and I didn't know what to do
[1:11:49] and I opened my Bible
[1:11:52] to that scripture
[1:11:57] and I looked at it
[1:11:59] I was just upset making a a great move
[1:12:04] and I didn't know what to do and I said
[1:12:06] Lord I don't know what that means why
[1:12:08] you're persecuting me it's hard for you
[1:12:11] to kick against the pricks I don't
[1:12:13] understand what that means and my mind
[1:12:15] went to kicking against a cactus and
[1:12:18] saying well yeah I can understand how
[1:12:19] that would not be such a great idea
[1:12:22] but then I looked and there was a note
[1:12:24] in my Bible
[1:12:27] that said kick against the goads
[1:12:31] I looked at it and I
[1:12:33] think I told this testimony before that
[1:12:36] that
[1:12:37] I was like
[1:12:39] against the goads what's a goad my mind
[1:12:42] went to shamgar and the ox goad and
[1:12:46] I I research that I looked and as I'm
[1:12:49] sitting in my chair and it's like five
[1:12:50] o'clock in the morning and I'm just torn
[1:12:53] up it's hard for you to kick against
[1:12:55] these goads and what it is is is that
[1:12:57] there's a a poker
[1:12:59] that a herdsman would have that it's
[1:13:02] it's on a stick and it's got a point on
[1:13:04] the end
[1:13:06] and when they're herding cattle or sheep
[1:13:08] or what it is that when they when they
[1:13:11] won't go where they they're supposed to
[1:13:13] go the shepherd will give them a poke
[1:13:16] the ox or or the the sheep or whatever
[1:13:19] it is and
[1:13:21] when you give them a poke
[1:13:23] if you see a cow they kick
[1:13:27] that's what it is
[1:13:29] and here is the Lord telling me
[1:13:31] my testimony
[1:13:34] this is me
[1:13:36] this is Daniel Evans
[1:13:38] how many times have I kicked against him
[1:13:40] no Lord that's not according to your
[1:13:42] word that is not these people are wrong
[1:13:44] and I kick and kick and kick and he's
[1:13:46] poking me and poking me and if if I
[1:13:49] would just go the way he said
[1:13:51] he wouldn't have to poke me
[1:13:54] but I did
[1:13:58] and I see like
[1:14:00] there it is Lord there
[1:14:02] is me
[1:14:05] and I'm the one that's been kicking at
[1:14:07] you why
[1:14:08] not because of sin
[1:14:11] not because I wanted to do something
[1:14:13] that that was would be considered sinful
[1:14:16] not because I wanted to to to leave the
[1:14:19] what brother brand I'm taught or not
[1:14:21] because I wanted to go into
[1:14:23] entertainment or look at something I
[1:14:25] shouldn't or any of that it was a
[1:14:27] religious spirit
[1:14:31] he's pushing me and saying you're
[1:14:34] fighting against me he's with Paul
[1:14:37] you're fighting against me because of
[1:14:39] your religious spirit
[1:14:43] fighting against God
[1:14:49] oh I think Lord I thought I was doing
[1:14:52] right
[1:14:54] I thought I was I thought I was serving
[1:14:56] you I was teaching your word I was I was
[1:14:57] I was I was zealous for your word and
[1:15:00] he's here and he's talking to a group
[1:15:01] and he's like I was the one that was
[1:15:03] wrong Agrippa
[1:15:07] and I said who art thou Lord
[1:15:11] and he said I'm Jesus
[1:15:13] whom thou persecuted
[1:15:16] but rise
[1:15:18] and stand upon thy feet for I have
[1:15:20] appeared unto thee for this purpose to
[1:15:22] make thee a minister and a witness
[1:15:25] of these things
[1:15:27] which thou has seen and of those things
[1:15:30] in the which I will appear unto thee
[1:15:33] what things had Saul of Tarsus
[1:15:37] seen to that point
[1:15:39] he'd been guilty of murder
[1:15:42] he'd been guilty of blasphemy he had
[1:15:44] been guilty of all of these things that
[1:15:46] he would have never done knowingly
[1:15:48] remember the Ten Commandments Thou shalt
[1:15:51] not kill
[1:15:54] Paul in his zeal
[1:15:56] breaking
[1:15:58] the Commandments
[1:16:00] and sentence and persecuting people to
[1:16:03] death
[1:16:07] and that's your testimony
[1:16:09] it's my testimony
[1:16:12] it may not it may have been a dirty life
[1:16:16] that we lived it may have been mistakes
[1:16:18] it may not have been it may have been a
[1:16:20] religious spirit
[1:16:22] and we have done all of these things
[1:16:24] wrong and you can give witness to those
[1:16:27] things in your testimony
[1:16:30] but also give witness to what you have
[1:16:33] become
[1:16:36] Paul here
[1:16:37] is going to testify to Agrippa
[1:16:40] things are different
[1:16:43] Jesus continues and he's talking Paul is
[1:16:45] giving us testimony Jesus is talking
[1:16:47] delivering me from the people and from
[1:16:49] the Gentiles unto whom
[1:16:51] now I send thee
[1:16:54] to open their eyes
[1:16:56] and to turn them from Darkness to light
[1:16:58] and from the power of Satan unto God
[1:17:01] that they may receive forgiveness of
[1:17:03] sins and inheritance among them which
[1:17:06] are Sanctified by faith that is in me
[1:17:10] whereupon O King Agrippa
[1:17:12] I was not disobedient under the heavenly
[1:17:15] vision
[1:17:18] I love that no matter how bad Paul was
[1:17:21] and everything that he did when Christ
[1:17:24] gave me the opportunity
[1:17:26] I was not disobedient to that heavenly
[1:17:30] vision I love that Lord let that be my
[1:17:33] testimony
[1:17:34] when you showed yourself to me I was not
[1:17:37] disobedient Lord I came when you called
[1:17:40] me
[1:17:43] but showed first unto them of Damascus
[1:17:45] and at Jerusalem and throughout all the
[1:17:48] coast of Judea and then to the Gentiles
[1:17:51] that they should repent and turn to God
[1:17:54] and do the works meet for repentance
[1:17:57] for these causes the Jews caught me in
[1:17:59] the temple and went about to kill me
[1:18:03] having therefore obtained help of God I
[1:18:06] continued unto this day witnessing both
[1:18:08] to small and great saying none other
[1:18:11] things than those which the prophets and
[1:18:14] Moses did say should come oh now he's
[1:18:18] back and he's saying oh they're saying I
[1:18:21] didn't believe the message but I do
[1:18:24] I am testifying that the message that
[1:18:27] God sent is fulfilled
[1:18:30] in Jesus Christ
[1:18:33] Paul's saying that I am his witness
[1:18:35] I have it I have a testimony
[1:18:45] that Christ should suffer
[1:18:48] and that he should be the first that
[1:18:51] should rise from the dead
[1:18:54] and should show light unto the people
[1:18:55] and to the Gentiles
[1:18:58] and as he thus spake for himself Festus
[1:19:01] with a loud voice
[1:19:03] Paul Festus said with a loud voice Paul
[1:19:06] Thou Art beside thyself much learning
[1:19:09] doth make thee mad
[1:19:11] as he he didn't get it at all
[1:19:16] Paul's testimony was that he came to
[1:19:19] Christ
[1:19:20] first
[1:19:21] and that is the testimony of every
[1:19:24] Christian that has ever lived
[1:19:28] including you and me
[1:19:31] that I came to Christ not
[1:19:34] that I believe Moses not that I believed
[1:19:37] Abraham but that I came to Jesus Christ
[1:19:44] he had very wrong ideas before of what
[1:19:47] God was
[1:19:48] even in all of his studying and and
[1:19:50] everything that he he knew and he could
[1:19:52] quote the Bible better than anybody he
[1:19:54] could quote the message backwards and
[1:19:56] forward and it caused him to put other
[1:19:58] people down because they didn't see
[1:20:00] things like him
[1:20:03] he thought they were sinners
[1:20:06] because they didn't see the word of God
[1:20:08] the same as he did
[1:20:09] I really appreciate what our brother
[1:20:11] said this morning
[1:20:12] along the same lines I had no idea he
[1:20:14] was going to preach that and and I was
[1:20:17] thinking Lord I just I feel
[1:20:19] that this is
[1:20:21] Vindication then I'll continue on
[1:20:25] with what I've been teaching and will
[1:20:26] continue to teach
[1:20:28] so Festus interjection he says Paul
[1:20:30] you're crazy
[1:20:32] you're nuts
[1:20:34] all this studying you've done and
[1:20:36] learning under Gamaliel and and all of
[1:20:38] this it's made you crazy
[1:20:41] but he said I am not mad most noble
[1:20:44] Festus
[1:20:45] but I speak forth the words of truth and
[1:20:48] soberness
[1:20:49] for the king knoweth of these things
[1:20:51] before whom also I speak freely for I am
[1:20:55] persuaded that none of these things are
[1:20:57] hidden from him
[1:20:59] for this thing was not done in a corner
[1:21:02] this Christianity thing and and all of
[1:21:05] my testimony Paul's saying hey it's it's
[1:21:07] out there for everybody to see
[1:21:10] and Paul says this
[1:21:12] remember I said how what a creep this
[1:21:14] Agrippa was
[1:21:16] and this weirdo sister he has Bernice
[1:21:20] King Agrippa
[1:21:23] believe it's thou the prophets
[1:21:26] I know
[1:21:28] that thou believest
[1:21:31] then Agrippa said unto Paul
[1:21:34] under Paul almost thou persuaded me to
[1:21:37] be a Christian
[1:21:40] and Paul said listen this what a
[1:21:44] bad person this Agrippa was
[1:21:48] that's why I said what I said earlier
[1:21:50] his lineage and his sister and all of
[1:21:53] this this guy was no good
[1:21:56] but look at the burden
[1:21:58] upon the apostle
[1:22:02] Paul said
[1:22:03] I would to God
[1:22:07] that not only thou
[1:22:10] but also all that hear me this day
[1:22:14] were both almost and all together such
[1:22:17] as I am except these bonds what a kind
[1:22:21] thing
[1:22:23] this Apostle says I wish
[1:22:26] that you had the same testimony as me
[1:22:30] King Agrippa with all of your sin and
[1:22:33] everything that you've done wrong and
[1:22:34] all and everything that you have done to
[1:22:36] all the children of Israel and your
[1:22:40] league with the Romans and your turn
[1:22:42] code and and how you've you've betrayed
[1:22:45] all of your people I wish
[1:22:49] that you had the same reward as I have
[1:22:51] accept I wish you didn't have to go
[1:22:54] through what I'm going through
[1:22:59] and when he had thus spoken
[1:23:01] the king rose up
[1:23:04] and the governor and Bernice
[1:23:07] and they that sat with them
[1:23:10] and when they were gone aside they
[1:23:12] talked between themselves saying this
[1:23:15] man doeth nothing worthy of death or of
[1:23:19] bonds
[1:23:21] look at the impact of Paul's testimony
[1:23:23] had
[1:23:24] on these people
[1:23:26] this man has done nothing
[1:23:28] that's worthy of death or even any type
[1:23:31] of imprisonment
[1:23:35] then set a grip onto Festus
[1:23:39] this man might have been said at Liberty
[1:23:42] if he had not appealed unto Caesar
[1:23:46] so Paul had already gone over their
[1:23:47] heads
[1:23:48] and they were obligated to send him for
[1:23:52] judgment
[1:23:53] sisters if we could come and close and
[1:23:55] brother Jonathan
[1:23:57] so they were saying that
[1:24:01] we've got to send him
[1:24:03] to be judged at Rome
[1:24:07] and their hearts had to feel bad
[1:24:10] and you see the kindness in Paul and the
[1:24:12] love it wasn't the Paul that that we've
[1:24:15] seen with uh when the high priest had
[1:24:17] him smacked in the face when he fought
[1:24:19] back this was love that Paul had even to
[1:24:23] these sinner people
[1:24:26] he says I wish you were like me I wish
[1:24:28] you had my testimony I wish you knew
[1:24:31] Jesus Christ like I know him except I
[1:24:33] wish he wouldn't have to suffer like I
[1:24:35] have to suffer suffer
[1:24:37] wow what a man
[1:24:40] this Apostle Paul was
[1:24:43] and he was so great
[1:24:46] because he had a testimony
[1:24:50] not just your raise right
[1:24:53] not just that
[1:24:56] you believe your Bible not just that you
[1:25:00] listen to tapes not just that that
[1:25:03] you're a good person
[1:25:06] remember what Jesus said
[1:25:10] he said you're going to come to me and
[1:25:11] you're going to say those things and I'm
[1:25:12] going to say depart from me
[1:25:15] because I never knew you
[1:25:18] if you don't have that testimony that
[1:25:22] you met Christ
[1:25:25] Brother David and raising our kids
[1:25:27] and how important it is and how much we
[1:25:30] love them and how much we try to protect
[1:25:32] them
[1:25:36] they don't know
[1:25:38] the Lord Jesus
[1:25:41] all of our efforts will be for naught
[1:25:44] it won't work
[1:25:47] it can't work
[1:25:49] but they have to they have to know Jesus
[1:25:53] Christ
[1:25:55] as I said Stephanie and I did our best
[1:25:58] and raising our kids and the Lord
[1:25:59] honored our prayers and he honored our
[1:26:01] love for our kids but our kids still
[1:26:04] sinned and they will
[1:26:08] if they don't know Christ
[1:26:10] how many testimonies have we heard
[1:26:15] that's why I chose
[1:26:17] Isaac Rosario and Jonathan I forgot his
[1:26:22] last name
[1:26:23] to minister at our youth meetings
[1:26:26] Jonathan had lived
[1:26:28] a terrible life
[1:26:31] drugs and
[1:26:33] and all kinds of bad things
[1:26:36] Isaac
[1:26:37] had lived a life what we would call
[1:26:40] squeaky clean
[1:26:44] but yet they were both
[1:26:46] they both had to have a relationship
[1:26:49] with Christ or both would have been lost
[1:26:54] and however hard we try if they don't
[1:26:57] know the Lord Jesus
[1:27:00] if they haven't met him personally
[1:27:03] then everything that we're teaching
[1:27:05] every time we teach them listen to tapes
[1:27:07] and read your Bible and pray and all
[1:27:09] this
[1:27:10] if they don't know him pray is different
[1:27:12] but if they don't know him
[1:27:15] then it's all lost
[1:27:19] they must have an experience they must
[1:27:23] have a new birth
[1:27:26] they must have Christ
[1:27:29] all of us
[1:27:30] [Music]
[1:27:31] and how we're raised in
[1:27:35] I believe I was raised good and and by
[1:27:37] the grace of God I didn't fall into into
[1:27:40] bad Sin
[1:27:44] but I still and everyone I know I still
[1:27:48] had to come to Christ
[1:27:51] and I think I was maybe in this same
[1:27:54] position as this apostle was
[1:27:57] sincere and zealous
[1:28:00] for what he believed
[1:28:02] standing strong here is what the prophet
[1:28:05] said I'll Stand Strong on that and yet
[1:28:08] was lost
[1:28:11] until he had that experience with Christ
[1:28:15] and all of our testimonies
[1:28:19] are just as great as Paul's
[1:28:21] if we meet Christ
[1:28:24] it's a necessity you hear so much about
[1:28:27] a personal relationship that's what it
[1:28:29] is
[1:28:31] and raising our kids
[1:28:35] that will hurt
[1:28:37] what did I do wrong didn't do anything
[1:28:39] wrong
[1:28:42] the fact is God was dealing with the
[1:28:44] young man or the young lady or whoever
[1:28:46] it is and God had his time and we just
[1:28:49] try to protect him until God gets a hold
[1:28:51] of them
[1:28:53] and then when he does
[1:28:57] they'll still sin they'll still do
[1:28:58] things wrong but I don't worry about my
[1:29:00] boy anymore
[1:29:01] I don't worry about my girl anymore
[1:29:04] because I know God's got a hold of him
[1:29:07] I know he has a testimony
[1:29:10] this is how I came to Christ
[1:29:13] I don't care
[1:29:15] if you're 90 years old
[1:29:17] or you're 12 years old
[1:29:20] if you don't have
[1:29:23] a testimony
[1:29:27] then you need to seek it
[1:29:30] you need to seek that conference with
[1:29:33] God you need to seek that experience you
[1:29:37] need to seek that new birth
[1:29:40] because it doesn't matter that you've
[1:29:43] lived a good life you've still sinned
[1:29:47] Paul lived a better life I guarantee you
[1:29:49] than anyone else in this room yet he was
[1:29:52] still lost until he met Christ
[1:29:54] [Music]
[1:29:56] me too but I know him sister Shirley and
[1:30:00] I know on that day
[1:30:03] it's not going to be uh he preached the
[1:30:06] gospel he he led many Souls it's not
[1:30:09] going to be any of that it's gonna be I
[1:30:11] knew him
[1:30:14] Daniel Evans I knew him
[1:30:18] I know him
[1:30:20] because I met him and he met me
[1:30:24] might not be on the road to Damascus
[1:30:26] might be on Oracle Road
[1:30:29] there's a lot of people on Oracle Road
[1:30:30] that need to meet him
[1:30:33] but we have to have that
[1:30:36] if you don't have it
[1:30:37] seek it
[1:30:39] first way
[1:30:41] baptism
[1:30:45] through the ordinances of God
[1:30:48] seek Him the Bible says to seek God
[1:30:51] while he is near
[1:30:54] so friends it's vitally important
[1:30:57] as I've said as a parent you do your
[1:31:00] best
[1:31:02] but they need a preacher to get them to
[1:31:06] Christ and I'm not talking about the guy
[1:31:08] in the pulpit
[1:31:10] I'm talking about Mama talking about
[1:31:12] daddy
[1:31:14] talking about all of us
[1:31:18] amen let's all stand

[1:33:12] [Music]
[1:33:14] signs
[1:33:21] [Music]
[1:33:23] for you the top our heads
[1:33:32] think about the Lord
[1:33:35] think about how important it is that we
[1:33:37] have that testimony that we
[1:33:39] have that place
[1:33:42] that we have driven that stake down
[1:33:46] say Lord you met me on that road to
[1:33:48] Damascus I will never forget that and
[1:33:51] when I give a testimony when I want to
[1:33:53] witness to someone I can say here is my
[1:33:56] testimony as the Apostle Paul did before
[1:33:59] Agrippa
[1:34:01] this is my testimony
[1:34:04] [Music]
[1:34:05] if you want to meet this same Jesus
[1:34:07] Christ that I know here's how it
[1:34:10] happened to me
[1:34:12] and I would
[1:34:14] [Music]
[1:34:16] that you would meet the same one that I
[1:34:19] have met
[1:34:21] to me
[1:34:23] I hear so many great testimonies I I
[1:34:26] hear
[1:34:27] how people have come out of crime or
[1:34:30] drugs or whatever it is but to me the
[1:34:33] greatest testimony
[1:34:36] is when someone can say I lived a good
[1:34:39] life
[1:34:40] I did my best
[1:34:43] I didn't fall into sin
[1:34:48] I made mistakes and I did wrong
[1:34:53] my parents taught me and I I did my best
[1:35:00] but on this day
[1:35:03] this happened to me and here is my
[1:35:06] testimony
[1:35:08] I love
[1:35:09] I love it
[1:35:12] when I hear that kind of testimony
[1:35:18] and I was protected
[1:35:20] and I believed
[1:35:22] but there was a day
[1:35:25] when Jesus Christ
[1:35:27] came into my heart and gave me that new
[1:35:29] birth
[1:35:34] if you haven't had that testimony
[1:35:37] seek it
[1:35:40] our lord is good
[1:35:43] same God that loved Paul that came to
[1:35:45] him on the road to Damascus is the same
[1:35:48] God that loves you and me

[1:39:34] corresponded with him a little bit over
[1:39:36] the years I asked him

[1:39:41] Lord's work
[1:39:43] in South Africa
