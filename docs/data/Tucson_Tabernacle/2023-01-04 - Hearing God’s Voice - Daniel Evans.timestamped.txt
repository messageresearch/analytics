[30:31] they had four young children
[30:34] I think it was four six eight and ten
[30:37] and they were quite rambunctious
[30:42] and mama was having a hard time because
[30:45] I'm working in the kitchen and they're
[30:47] they're running through it climbing over
[30:49] the countertops and just going

[31:03] and the little girl began to mouth off
[31:06] to her mother
[31:07] and I'm
[31:08] closer than this to here
[31:11] and my first thought was oh my she needs
[31:13] a weapon
[31:15] but I waited a little bit I said no mama
[31:17] needs some encouragement right about now
[31:19] because she's just been totally
[31:20] embarrassed
[31:22] you know so after she kind of calmed
[31:24] down and and things

[31:41] right it'll be okay and such a smile
[31:43] came over her face he goes really I said
[31:45] yes

[31:52] share that with someone else too you
[31:54] know and it just meant so much to her

[37:47] got to turn my microphone on God bless
[37:50] you all
[37:53] while you're standing let's open up our
[37:55] Bibles turn to First Kings chapter 19.
[38:01] it's good to see everyone out on a
[38:03] Wednesday night another week praise the
[38:05] Lord
[38:10] foreign
[38:12] Kings chapter 19 verse 11. familiar
[38:15] scripture we've all read it we've
[38:17] probably all heard many sermons on it
[38:20] the Lord speaking to his servant Elijah
[38:22] he says this and he said go forth
[38:25] and stand upon the mount before the Lord
[38:28] and behold behold the Lord passed by
[38:31] and a great and strong wind to rent the
[38:34] mountains
[38:35] and break in pieces the Rocks before the
[38:37] Lord but the Lord was not in the Wind
[38:40] and after the wind an earthquake but the
[38:43] Lord was not in the earthquake
[38:45] and after the earthquake of Fire
[38:48] but the Lord was not in the fire
[38:50] and after the fire a still small voice
[38:55] and if you'd also turn to James chapter
[38:56] 5 I'll read one verse
[38:58] James chapter 5 verse 17.
[39:03] another very familiar scripture he says
[39:06] this Elias
[39:08] was a man's subject
[39:10] to like passions as we are
[39:13] and he prayed earnestly that it might
[39:15] not rain and it rained not on the Earth
[39:17] by the space of three years and six
[39:21] months
[39:22] it's about our heads father
[39:24] thank you for your worth
[39:26] we love it Lord and we love this example
[39:28] of this man Elijah
[39:30] and how we can relate
[39:33] because it says by the Apostle James
[39:36] that he was a man like we are
[39:39] father I pray that you would bless this
[39:40] service be with us tonight we pray in
[39:43] Jesus Christ's name amen
[39:46] now bless you again take your you can
[39:48] take your seats
[39:49] I appreciate it brother Aaron's
[39:51] testimony
[39:53] imagine
[39:55] if uh brother Aaron would have followed
[39:58] the flesh
[40:00] and uh said something to that lady a lot
[40:02] of good that would have done
[40:04] but no he said something he said
[40:07] something kind the Holy Spirit working
[40:09] through him and who knows what good
[40:11] that's going to do in the long term
[40:13] brother why I don't know these two
[40:15] sisters sitting next to you

[43:00] but there's there's some other decisions
[43:02] that we have to make in the future we
[43:03] need to talk about Sunday school praying
[43:06] about that
[43:07] um
[43:08] any changes to the music program to
[43:10] instruments and all that the the youth
[43:12] meetings that brother Peter started I
[43:13] want to continue those uh maybe even
[43:16] make some changes to them
[43:18] um
[43:19] and then the ministry here in the church
[43:21] how often we're going to minister when
[43:23] we're going to minister when if we're
[43:25] going to keep the same sermon times if
[43:27] if um
[43:28] even if we should take up an offering in
[43:31] the church I know that we've never done
[43:33] that brother Branham did it you know
[43:35] brother Branham taught that we should do
[43:36] it but this is also a different church
[43:37] we don't know if we want to introduce
[43:39] that or not these things require a lot
[43:42] of prayer and another thing they require
[43:44] a lot of prayer not from me only
[43:47] but from all of us
[43:49] because we're a body we need to seek
[43:52] God's voice it's a very very important
[43:55] time that's going to be going to be
[43:57] talking about tonight
[43:59] is
[44:01] hearing God's voice
[44:04] and what does God's voice sound like
[44:07] so many times it's hard to hear
[44:12] and I have to admit the past
[44:15] maybe a year
[44:17] I'll pray about things and the Lord will
[44:20] lead me
[44:21] and as he does all of us
[44:24] but it's been hard for me to hear that
[44:30] voice that I'm going to be talking about
[44:31] today but I believe in the past week
[44:34] he's spoken to me twice one time I
[44:36] announced someone right before Bill
[44:38] Lyle's sermon I believe he gave me a
[44:40] scripture
[44:41] and I announced that to the church right
[44:43] out right after the sermon the sermon
[44:45] that brother Lyle preached
[44:48] but I've been seeking him
[44:50] and what I want to talk about tonight is
[44:53] what does that voice sound like
[44:56] there's um
[44:59] there was a question that was asked the
[45:02] other night when we did our questions
[45:03] and answers and the question was asked
[45:06] how do you feel the Lord is leading you
[45:11] to be the pastor of this church
[45:13] and the way I answered
[45:15] was that when I get something on my
[45:19] heart or I get excited about something
[45:23] then don't just jump
[45:26] but wait
[45:28] because it could be just emotions that
[45:31] you're feeling
[45:32] so I said that I I set it aside and I
[45:36] pray about it and and I continue to pray
[45:39] about it and many many times probably
[45:42] more often than not
[45:44] that burden will leave me
[45:47] and it'll just kind of fade away and
[45:49] it's like okay good I'm glad I didn't go
[45:50] do that I'm glad I didn't move in that
[45:52] direction but then other times it just
[45:55] stays there
[45:57] and it just sometimes it just keeps
[45:59] getting stronger and stronger and the
[46:02] way that I answered that question the
[46:04] other night is is this burden has gotten
[46:06] stronger and stronger and stronger to
[46:08] this point and it hasn't gone away
[46:11] and that's when all of us are praying
[46:13] and when we're putting these things
[46:15] before the Lord these things for the
[46:17] church make sure each of us are praying
[46:20] make sure all of you are praying because
[46:22] each one of us has a role in this church
[46:25] don't forget every single one of us has
[46:28] a part
[46:29] you have a part
[46:31] you need to be praying Lord what do you
[46:34] want me to do how do you want me to
[46:37] contribute to this church not so much
[46:39] Lord how can this church serve me
[46:42] but how can I serve this church so when
[46:47] we're praying about that keep it before
[46:49] the Lord and we might get excited about
[46:51] something I might say I want to be the
[46:53] song leader that ain't my calling but I
[46:57] might get excited about it brother
[46:58] Wilson and say Hey you know I think I
[46:59] could do a good job and then people are
[47:01] like wow you know he's terrible
[47:04] but if I keep putting that before the
[47:06] Lord I believe he would take that burden
[47:08] away from me and that's all of us make
[47:12] sure friends that we are putting these
[47:14] things before the Lord seeking the
[47:17] Lord's voice and he might
[47:19] speak to you
[47:21] like I believe you spoke to me last week
[47:24] or he might do like almost always
[47:27] happens with me as I keep putting it
[47:29] before him and then
[47:31] pretty soon
[47:33] I have to make a step
[47:35] now the world will pressure you and say
[47:38] move go you have to make that step right
[47:40] now go you have to make this decision
[47:42] and sometimes you have to I mean if you
[47:45] step on a rattlesnake you can jump you
[47:48] know don't pray about it just jump get
[47:51] off it
[47:52] there's times like that but then there's
[47:54] other times which is most of the time
[47:56] you're getting pressured pressured wait
[47:59] a minute be still
[48:01] know that I'm God put it before him keep
[48:05] keep putting it before and then
[48:07] you can take a step
[48:10] the Bible says that the word is to a
[48:12] lamp to our feet
[48:14] it lights that next step it doesn't
[48:16] light it all the way down to the end it
[48:20] just lights this next step it may be
[48:23] College
[48:24] it may be Lord what career do you want
[48:27] me to have as a young man or a young
[48:29] lady what who do you want me to marry
[48:31] what these great decisions that our
[48:34] young people make
[48:36] don't jump and run
[48:39] take a step
[48:41] and then Lord do you want me to keep
[48:43] going on this path but he might
[48:46] turn it this way
[48:47] but if you're all the way down there
[48:49] you're gonna have to come all the way
[48:50] back and then go down this way so always
[48:53] put things before the Lord and wait on
[48:56] him and then move with faith you a lot
[48:59] of times you have to take a step
[49:01] but
[49:03] move as he moves the children of Israel
[49:07] when they were in the wilderness they
[49:09] had a pillar of cloud by day and a
[49:13] pillar of Fire by night and they
[49:15] followed that leading when it got up and
[49:19] moved they got up and moved but notice
[49:23] they didn't stop they would stop for a
[49:26] period of time as the Lord LED but so
[49:28] many times we stop and we stop moving we
[49:32] get complacent we get happy with where
[49:34] we're at and we stop seeking we stop
[49:38] pressing we stop praying and we notice
[49:41] then God stops speaking
[49:43] and we we stand there and and we're I'm
[49:46] happy with my house I'm happy with my
[49:48] friends and I you know I like to go on
[49:49] vacation I like to do all this and then
[49:51] we lose sight of the Lord remember that
[49:54] in this age it's the only age there's
[49:57] Jesus standing at the door
[49:59] and knocking it's the only age that has
[50:01] really put them out
[50:02] and that's this age and we have to be
[50:04] very careful where we're at what we're
[50:06] doing always putting God saying Lord is
[50:10] this your will
[50:12] and sometimes many times that I've seen
[50:15] I'll be talking about tonight
[50:18] the Lord speaks to us
[50:20] gives us a certain direction
[50:23] starts us moving and then we dig in in
[50:27] that direction and we're unwilling to
[50:28] move because we know that God God moved
[50:31] us in this direction but then we get our
[50:33] mindset
[50:35] and then we put them out we know that
[50:37] God sent me this way so I'm going to go
[50:38] this way and God is saying I sent you
[50:41] that way but I wanted you to turn a
[50:43] corner but you just kept going
[50:45] we need to be careful about that and
[50:47] I'll be talking about that in the
[50:49] scriptures also
[50:51] I
[50:54] we have to be careful also that
[50:56] everything becomes a sign
[50:59] everything becomes some spiritual
[51:01] revelation
[51:03] you have to be very very careful with
[51:05] that because when we are seeking a sign
[51:09] when we are seeking vindication
[51:12] we'll get it
[51:15] no matter if it's right or wrong we'll
[51:17] get that Vindication I'll give a couple
[51:19] examples in a little while you can open
[51:21] up your Bible and all of a sudden wow
[51:22] this is a miracle I opened up my Bible
[51:24] to this you twist it a little bit it
[51:26] must be what I want
[51:28] and not necessarily the way God is
[51:30] leading
[51:31] I talked the other night
[51:34] I was so scared
[51:37] of telling this testimony that I had
[51:40] about seeing that Vision that I saw
[51:44] I was like I can't lord I can't say this
[51:47] because
[51:49] they're going to think that I'm weird or
[51:52] they're they're going to think that that
[51:54] I'm trying to make myself something that
[51:56] I'm not or
[51:58] they're going to make me something that
[52:00] I'm not
[52:01] and they're going to say oh you're you
[52:03] know you you have a gift or something
[52:04] that's like none of those things
[52:07] just want to give a testimony of what
[52:09] had happened and this book that lays in
[52:12] front of me is full of testimonies like
[52:15] that and I want us to have more but we
[52:18] have to seek God and when that happened
[52:21] to me I was desperately
[52:23] Desperately Seeking him
[52:25] and when he spoke
[52:27] it was a familiar voice that I knew was
[52:30] him because I had heard it before
[52:35] um
[52:36] so just because
[52:39] it looks right and it feels right and
[52:42] when I had that experience I could have
[52:44] taken that experience and ran somewhere
[52:47] with it and what had happened was was
[52:49] God told me
[52:51] he said I made you a preacher to rightly
[52:54] divide my word
[52:56] didn't tell me I was a pastor didn't
[52:58] tell me I was a prophet didn't tell me
[53:01] that I was an apostle or any of these
[53:03] other things he just said I was a
[53:05] preacher I could have taken his word and
[53:08] made it say something that I wanted it
[53:10] to say
[53:12] but I have more respect for God when he
[53:15] does speak to me like that
[53:16] and I thank God that he could trust me
[53:19] in in giving me a little voice and I
[53:22] think all of us have probably heard
[53:24] when he speaks to each of us
[53:27] I am
[53:29] for the church
[53:31] I want us to mature
[53:33] as a body
[53:35] to where our cries out to the Lord
[53:39] that they're not for ourselves
[53:42] we need to mature so when we are crying
[53:44] out to the lord it's for our Brethren
[53:47] and it's for other people that's I
[53:51] believe when God really starts to speak
[53:54] to us
[53:55] and when we're praying
[53:58] and I'm going to get to the scriptures
[53:59] here in a minute
[54:02] there are so many voices in the world
[54:06] more than any other time
[54:08] you know we have we have the voice of
[54:10] the television we have the voice of the
[54:12] radio we have the voice of social media
[54:13] we have the voice of the internet we
[54:15] have the voice of our jobs we have the
[54:17] voice of our friends we have all these
[54:20] different voices that are always going
[54:23] on in our heads and when we get down to
[54:25] pray you think those voices just stop
[54:28] they're loud obnoxious voices
[54:32] and when you get down to pray it just
[54:34] hits you and hit you and hit you and hit
[54:36] you and then you start praying and and
[54:38] we start thinking Lord help me with my
[54:40] job Lord help me with this Lord help me
[54:41] with that and and the all these voices
[54:44] are going on and that's not how God's
[54:46] voice sounds
[54:47] as I read in the scripture it's a still
[54:49] small voice but you know what it is when
[54:52] it speaks
[54:54] and then when we get on our knees also
[54:56] we'll just lose thought
[54:59] get down and start to pray and my mind
[55:03] will go anywhere
[55:06] but but what I want to pray about
[55:09] and I'll start thinking about work one
[55:12] thing that I start thinking about a lot
[55:14] is what I'm going to preach on next
[55:17] Lord
[55:18] it's not you know here I am and that's
[55:21] my mind
[55:23] it's not him speaking
[55:26] and I want to when we distinguish God's
[55:28] voice
[55:30] from our voice
[55:32] that is a sure voice and it's not
[55:35] something that's dominating your
[55:37] thoughts it's not this loud
[55:40] um obnoxious voice that we hear so often
[55:43] in our minds
[55:45] the Bible is constantly especially in
[55:48] the Book of Psalms it's constantly
[55:50] telling us to to be still
[55:54] and it's constantly saying to wait on
[55:57] God
[55:58] and as far as the direction we're moving
[56:02] in the church
[56:03] we need to move
[56:06] but constantly putting it before him
[56:09] constantly praying and in every decision
[56:13] that you all make whether it be who
[56:15] you're going to marry whether it be
[56:17] the job that you take
[56:20] wait on him
[56:23] Isaiah chapter 40 verse 31 says this
[56:28] you all know it because we sing it
[56:30] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[56:33] their strength
[56:34] they shall Mount up with wings as eagles
[56:36] they shall run and not be weary they
[56:38] shall walk and not faint
[56:44] let me uh I did this when I was in
[56:47] Indonesia
[56:49] um and it worked
[56:51] so I'm going to try it here
[56:54] brother Branham says
[56:57] this
[56:59] first quote
[57:04] it's such a beautiful message this
[57:06] message
[57:07] is uh 58 1005 hear his voice listen to
[57:13] this hopefully this will work
[57:19] [Music]
[57:30] and all the 80 years of training had
[57:32] taught him
[57:33] it made a different man out of him
[57:37] it'll make a different man and woman out
[57:39] of you if you'll just stand still long
[57:43] enough to hear his voice
[57:45] like Samuel in
[57:48] still
[57:50] don't be excited
[57:52] if you want something of God asking
[57:55] now listen see what he's going to say
[57:56] about it just open up your heart say
[57:59] what about it Lord Jesus
[58:01] just stay there if he doesn't answer the
[58:03] first five hours then wait another
[58:05] if he doesn't answer later he'll answer
[58:07] tomorrow
[58:08] if he doesn't answer this week he will
[58:10] next week
[58:12] stay there tell the answers
[58:15] hear his voice speak back
[58:17] and say yes I'm the Lord that healeth
[58:20] thee and it's all over
[58:22] you're settling okay I'm the Lord who
[58:25] forgives all thy sins
[58:27] now go and send them
[58:29] on damn you then you can go free you're
[58:33] all right
[58:34] but you want to be sure that you hear
[58:37] that voice
[58:39] amen
[58:41] amen
[58:44] you know and I've been talking
[58:48] how
[58:50] feel like I haven't heard that voice
[58:53] he's helped me and he's led me
[58:58] but I had an experience
[59:00] last Tuesday
[59:02] and I was praying about the church which
[59:05] I have been for a long time
[59:07] and I was asking the Lord
[59:09] Lord what do you want
[59:12] for the church
[59:14] I don't want us to get into something
[59:15] that's going to hurt the people I don't
[59:17] want to I don't want to be wrong Lord
[59:19] what do you want what is your perfect
[59:22] will and just crying out every morning
[59:25] I'd wake up and I'd be praying and as
[59:28] much as I could at all of my prayers
[59:30] Lord crying what do you want for the
[59:34] church
[59:36] and on Tuesday
[59:38] it's on my knees
[59:40] as praying
[59:42] and he said this and it was that same
[59:44] voice by the day and that I know I've
[59:46] heard many many times
[59:48] he said enough
[59:50] don't pray about it again
[59:53] didn't tell me what was going to happen
[59:55] didn't say that the church is going to
[59:58] do this or or any of that but he spoke
[1:00:01] and let me tell you when God speaks it
[1:00:04] doesn't matter what he says
[1:00:06] whatever he says is his Sovereign will
[1:00:10] and that is exactly what I want
[1:00:14] he didn't tell me this is we're going to
[1:00:16] have this pastor that Pastor this Deacon
[1:00:18] or whatever it is he just said I heard
[1:00:21] you enough you don't have to ask anymore
[1:00:25] and I knew just trusting God
[1:00:28] trust in him and it was that still small
[1:00:32] voice
[1:00:34] that spoke to me
[1:00:37] First Kings chapter 19.
[1:00:41] and we know that Elijah
[1:00:44] he had just come down from Mount Carmel
[1:00:46] where incredible miracles
[1:00:51] killed 450 of Bales profits you know the
[1:00:55] the um
[1:00:56] the fire came down and consumed the
[1:00:58] sacrifices you know the story and he
[1:01:01] goes and now he's again seeking God's
[1:01:05] voice and he's trying to get quiet
[1:01:09] before the Lord
[1:01:11] Jezebel that crazy woman was after him
[1:01:14] and she's gonna she's gonna kill him
[1:01:18] and he doesn't know what to do
[1:01:24] and Ahab told Jezebel
[1:01:26] all that Elijah had done and with all he
[1:01:29] had slain all the prophets with the
[1:01:31] sword
[1:01:32] then Jezebel sent a messenger unto
[1:01:34] Elijah saying so let the gods do to me
[1:01:37] and more also if I make not die life as
[1:01:40] the life of one of them by tomorrow
[1:01:42] about this time
[1:01:44] and when he saw that he arose and went
[1:01:47] for his life and came to Beersheba which
[1:01:49] belonged to Judah and left his servant
[1:01:52] there but he himself went a Day's
[1:01:54] Journey Into the Wilderness and came and
[1:01:56] sat under the juniper tree
[1:01:59] and he requested for himself that he
[1:02:01] might die and said it isn't enough now
[1:02:04] oh Lord take my life for I am not better
[1:02:08] than my fathers
[1:02:10] listen to him
[1:02:12] pray it Lord things are bad
[1:02:15] I need help this is really bad Lord are
[1:02:17] you hearing me
[1:02:20] and as he lay and slept under a juniper
[1:02:23] tree then behold then an angel touched
[1:02:25] him and said unto him arise and eat
[1:02:28] and he looked and behold there was a
[1:02:30] cake bacon on the coals and a cruise of
[1:02:32] water at his head and he did eat and
[1:02:35] drink and laid him down again and the
[1:02:37] angel of the Lord came again the second
[1:02:40] time and touched him and said arise and
[1:02:42] eat because the journey is too great for
[1:02:44] thee
[1:02:45] and he arose and did eat and drink and
[1:02:47] went on the strength of that meat 40
[1:02:49] days and 40 nights into Horeb to the
[1:02:52] Mount of God the Mount of God
[1:02:55] and he came tether unto a cave
[1:02:58] and he lodged there
[1:03:00] and behold the word of the Lord came to
[1:03:03] him and he said unto him
[1:03:07] what doest thou hear Elijah
[1:03:11] notice that the word came to the prophet
[1:03:14] in the form of a question
[1:03:16] I think
[1:03:17] God knew what he was doing
[1:03:21] God is he's all-knowing he knew what was
[1:03:23] going on
[1:03:24] but he felt God
[1:03:27] wanted to ask
[1:03:29] this man what are you doing here
[1:03:34] watch Elijah's answer
[1:03:37] and he said I've been very jealous for
[1:03:39] the Lord God of hosts for the children
[1:03:40] of Israel I've forsaken thy Covenant
[1:03:42] thrown down thine altars and slain thy
[1:03:45] prophets with a sword and I even I only
[1:03:48] am left and they seek my life to take it
[1:03:51] away
[1:03:52] James said Elijah is a man like we are
[1:03:55] how many of us have been in that place
[1:03:57] Lord what do you want me to do I I don't
[1:04:00] understand I'm having all these problems
[1:04:03] in life
[1:04:07] Elijah's down on the dumps and he's
[1:04:09] thinking about himself
[1:04:12] he was struggling to hear God's voice
[1:04:14] and he was doing his best to get quiet
[1:04:19] he went into the mountains and then into
[1:04:20] the cave and here he is all worked up
[1:04:22] and depressed
[1:04:25] and acting the way it was
[1:04:29] to the point that he thought
[1:04:32] that he was the only one right in the
[1:04:34] world
[1:04:36] everybody else is wrong but me why
[1:04:41] Lord what do you everybody's wrong
[1:04:44] nobody wants to serve you I'm the only
[1:04:46] one
[1:04:48] and now they're trying to kill me too
[1:04:49] everybody's against me
[1:04:52] and Elijah was like we are
[1:04:58] you know like I said
[1:05:00] we pray about these things
[1:05:02] but those voices that are in our head
[1:05:04] they're really loud and they really
[1:05:06] press on us
[1:05:08] and I
[1:05:11] even even with with Within
[1:05:15] the Christian Community even within the
[1:05:18] message Community some says we're not
[1:05:20] preaching
[1:05:21] enough about brother branham's message
[1:05:23] other says oh you preached too much
[1:05:25] about brother Branham oh you need to
[1:05:27] preach more about the Lord Jesus and
[1:05:30] less about brother Branham you should be
[1:05:32] playing the tapes in the church and how
[1:05:35] can you preach when you have the
[1:05:36] unadulterated word of God through the
[1:05:38] prophet here
[1:05:40] straight from the prophet and we can
[1:05:42] listen to a tape and then the other one
[1:05:44] says I can barely stay awake when you're
[1:05:46] playing a tape I need somebody up in the
[1:05:48] pulpit
[1:05:50] everybody's got their own perspective
[1:05:52] just like Elijah did and you know what
[1:05:55] I'm the only one that's right
[1:05:58] everybody else is wrong I've got exactly
[1:06:02] how we should run our church
[1:06:05] and then
[1:06:07] we hear
[1:06:09] when we when we have decisions to make
[1:06:12] we hear this thing say that says
[1:06:16] you have to pray through
[1:06:18] we hear Brother Branham says you got to
[1:06:20] pray through we hear the evangelists
[1:06:23] come through and he says you have to
[1:06:24] pray through
[1:06:25] and then we hear the pastor and he says
[1:06:27] you have to pray through what does
[1:06:30] praying through mean
[1:06:33] praying through means you're praying
[1:06:36] and those voices that are in your head
[1:06:39] and my head in your head those voices
[1:06:41] that are constantly coming they start to
[1:06:43] die down
[1:06:45] they start to get quieter they start to
[1:06:49] the volume starts to go down and you
[1:06:53] start to get quiet before the Lord
[1:06:56] and then like Elijah
[1:06:59] then you can start to hear that voice
[1:07:02] speak
[1:07:05] it says uh
[1:07:07] let me let me play another one could you
[1:07:10] hear that okay
[1:07:11] Let's uh let's do that again
[1:07:16] this is paragraph 68 my brother
[1:07:18] same same message and brother and I I
[1:07:21] think that we should listen to this one
[1:07:23] this is really good
[1:07:26] um same tape that I mentioned it's right
[1:07:27] there
[1:07:30] here we go again
[1:07:32] no wonder the voice of God is a rare
[1:07:35] thing today
[1:07:36] is smothered out
[1:07:42] so many things that dim and take away
[1:07:50] to a place I'm telling
[1:07:52] dogs are our senses
[1:07:55] until we can't hear the voice of God
[1:08:00] our senses of where we are to shake
[1:08:03] ourselves and realize that you are men
[1:08:06] and women
[1:08:08] and you are the creation of God
[1:08:13] you were put you're just serve him
[1:08:19] our prayers
[1:08:21] Lord we are here to serve you
[1:08:25] we are men and women of God and we're
[1:08:29] always crying out Lord help me Lord help
[1:08:31] me Lord help me and then
[1:08:34] sometimes they'll give you a little
[1:08:35] experience but it wasn't like he gave to
[1:08:37] me I heard you
[1:08:40] he probably would have said I heard you
[1:08:41] the first time
[1:08:44] and then you know
[1:08:46] thank you God
[1:08:48] thank you that you know my situation
[1:08:52] and that you really care
[1:08:55] I was um another time
[1:08:59] that this happened I was upset I was
[1:09:03] working in Jeffersonville and I go in on
[1:09:06] the weekends and I'd get the work done
[1:09:09] that I didn't have phone calls and
[1:09:11] visitors and all that on the weekends so
[1:09:13] I would get the work that I needed to
[1:09:15] get done on the on the weekends and then
[1:09:17] I would spend as much time as I could in
[1:09:19] the chapel a little little church that
[1:09:23] we had inside the building praying
[1:09:25] and I was upset I was
[1:09:28] I was really
[1:09:30] upset at
[1:09:32] two brothers
[1:09:35] one of them was my dad
[1:09:37] and um another another was a brother
[1:09:39] that I work with
[1:09:42] and it seemed like every decision that
[1:09:45] they were making was wrong
[1:09:48] and I was
[1:09:50] walking back to the chapel and I said
[1:09:52] Lord
[1:09:54] what
[1:09:56] is going on why do you keep why do they
[1:10:00] keep making these decisions why do they
[1:10:04] keep doing these things that seem like
[1:10:06] they're against your your word and the
[1:10:08] wrong decisions and not being able to
[1:10:10] get along with people Lord what's going
[1:10:12] on and as I was walking
[1:10:14] that voice that same voice
[1:10:17] it said
[1:10:19] I made them that way
[1:10:21] you expect too much
[1:10:25] amen
[1:10:27] and I look at I believe it's in job
[1:10:31] that says that every man that's born of
[1:10:35] a woman
[1:10:37] is full of trouble
[1:10:41] and how can we have these high
[1:10:44] expectations even from each other
[1:10:47] yes and then
[1:10:49] condemn each other
[1:10:51] when God's the one that made us that way
[1:10:53] we should all be getting better we
[1:10:55] should all be trying but make sure our
[1:10:57] expectations for each other are not
[1:11:00] different or not too high
[1:11:04] because God has expectations for us too
[1:11:08] let me go on to this next next scripture
[1:11:14] verse number 11.
[1:11:17] and he said go forth and stand upon the
[1:11:19] mount before the Lord and behold the
[1:11:20] behold the Lord pass by and a great and
[1:11:24] strong wind rent the mountains
[1:11:27] and break in pieces the Rocks before the
[1:11:30] Lord
[1:11:30] but the Lord was not in the Wind
[1:11:33] and after the wind and earthquake
[1:11:36] but the Lord was not in the earthquake
[1:11:40] we forget
[1:11:42] about this scripture
[1:11:44] that God passed by
[1:11:49] and then there was a wind
[1:11:52] and then there was an earthquake but it
[1:11:54] was because God passed by
[1:11:56] now the voice wasn't in the wind the
[1:11:59] voice wasn't in the earthquake
[1:12:01] but God still
[1:12:03] passed by
[1:12:05] so we're looking at this wind and this
[1:12:09] earthquake this great things that
[1:12:11] happened
[1:12:12] powerful loud all of this stuff going on
[1:12:17] yet Elijah was there wait a minute
[1:12:21] he's not in that
[1:12:24] and the earthquake hits and and we'd
[1:12:26] think I was just praying about something
[1:12:28] earthquake hits I have my answer no God
[1:12:31] wasn't in the worth the earthquake but
[1:12:34] it did happen because he passed by
[1:12:38] there's a
[1:12:40] there was a
[1:12:41] decades ago
[1:12:44] there was a meeting
[1:12:46] young people
[1:12:49] um wasn't wasn't all youth but it was
[1:12:51] you know the 20-somethings and and
[1:12:55] the uh at the end of the service
[1:12:59] the Spirit came down
[1:13:02] in the service
[1:13:04] they came to the altar
[1:13:07] God passed by
[1:13:09] the Spirit came down and people people
[1:13:12] were shouting and they were praising the
[1:13:14] Lord and many of them were speaking in
[1:13:16] tongues
[1:13:17] God passed by the great things were
[1:13:22] happening
[1:13:23] and there at the altar
[1:13:26] was a young lady
[1:13:29] and there was a young man
[1:13:32] praying asking the Lord
[1:13:36] for a spouse
[1:13:38] asking the Lord for this Here Comes This
[1:13:41] powerful Spirit the Lord passed by
[1:13:45] great wind coming through great
[1:13:48] earthquake coming through there they are
[1:13:50] at the altar and all this is going on
[1:13:52] and and the tongues are going on and and
[1:13:54] people are screaming and the girl looks
[1:13:57] up
[1:13:58] and the boy looks up
[1:14:01] and their eyes meet
[1:14:04] pray
[1:14:05] for a husband praying for a wife
[1:14:09] oh
[1:14:10] that's him
[1:14:12] that's her
[1:14:13] that must be with all of this going on
[1:14:17] a few months later they're married
[1:14:21] get married after that experience they
[1:14:23] get married have a child
[1:14:27] turned out to be an absolutely horrible
[1:14:30] marriage
[1:14:32] absolutely terrible
[1:14:35] there what happened was they they got
[1:14:37] married the the um
[1:14:39] they have this child they tried to stay
[1:14:41] for together for a while ended up just
[1:14:44] hating each other
[1:14:46] and all because they got too worked up
[1:14:50] it was God
[1:14:52] don't forget it was God
[1:14:54] just like it was God
[1:14:57] that brought the earthquake he passed by
[1:15:00] the wind he passed by
[1:15:03] but God was not in the earthquake and he
[1:15:06] was not in the wind but he was still God
[1:15:11] don't be careful
[1:15:14] always be ready
[1:15:18] and the problem is we as human beings we
[1:15:21] want our way
[1:15:23] and something big will happen like this
[1:15:26] and we'll put our own interpretation on
[1:15:28] it
[1:15:29] and then it must be God
[1:15:32] and we get off
[1:15:34] like like this young man and this young
[1:15:37] lady
[1:15:38] and this poor
[1:15:40] young man that they produced
[1:15:43] he hates his dad today
[1:15:45] has no contact with his dad
[1:15:47] he's miserable
[1:15:49] his mother's miserable because she's
[1:15:51] gone all these years and not not
[1:15:54] married
[1:15:56] and he's just gone
[1:15:58] the husband
[1:16:00] all because
[1:16:02] they get caught up in the Wind
[1:16:04] they got caught up in the earthquake
[1:16:07] and after the earthquake a fire
[1:16:11] but the Lord was not in the fire
[1:16:15] and after the fire
[1:16:17] a still small voice
[1:16:21] and as I said before
[1:16:23] it doesn't matter what that voice says
[1:16:25] it's God speaking it doesn't have to
[1:16:27] agree with what I want
[1:16:29] if it's God it's God and I want to do
[1:16:33] whatever it says and then you have that
[1:16:35] feeling
[1:16:36] when you know it's him
[1:16:38] a real Christian it doesn't matter what
[1:16:40] it says I'm going to do it and it makes
[1:16:42] you feel good most of the time when I've
[1:16:45] heard that voice most of the time it's
[1:16:47] been correction for me
[1:16:50] another time
[1:16:51] I was uh again same situation that I was
[1:16:56] when I when the Lord spoke to me on that
[1:16:59] time I was walking to the Chapel of kin
[1:17:01] and I was so busy
[1:17:04] and I needed help
[1:17:06] I was answering all of these emails all
[1:17:09] the time with all these people that that
[1:17:11] had questions about about the word and
[1:17:14] new Believers and they were asking
[1:17:16] questions people were coming in and I
[1:17:18] was on the phone I was always praying
[1:17:20] with people and then I also had I was
[1:17:22] publishing a magazine I had a whole
[1:17:25] staff underneath me and they were
[1:17:27] waiting for me to get my job done
[1:17:30] and I'm walking I'm walking to the to
[1:17:33] the um to the chapel and and I'm saying
[1:17:36] Lord I need help
[1:17:38] I just I can't handle it I need help I'm
[1:17:41] doing this magazine and I'm writing
[1:17:42] these articles and and I and it's
[1:17:45] killing me and I'm walking along and he
[1:17:48] spoke
[1:17:50] and he said this
[1:17:52] he says what if I don't want to do that
[1:17:55] I had never considered
[1:17:57] then maybe he didn't want to publish
[1:17:59] that magazine
[1:18:01] I had never even considered all this
[1:18:03] inspiration that I had and everything
[1:18:05] that I was doing and and it's so
[1:18:07] exciting and all the blessing it was to
[1:18:08] the people I never considered
[1:18:11] God
[1:18:13] he was blessing it and everything was
[1:18:15] going good and and then he asked me what
[1:18:18] if I don't want to do that
[1:18:20] oh
[1:18:22] Lord
[1:18:23] I'm sorry
[1:18:25] and all the decisions that we're making
[1:18:28] now
[1:18:29] it may sound good
[1:18:31] everything may be just wonderful let's
[1:18:34] let's move forward with this and let's
[1:18:35] do these things but remember what if he
[1:18:39] doesn't want to do that you notice he
[1:18:40] answered me with a question
[1:18:43] it's okay to answer as if the question
[1:18:45] he did it
[1:18:47] through our example here Elijah
[1:18:55] and all this that had happened
[1:18:57] to Elijah watch what Elijah does what's
[1:19:00] the reverence that the prophet has
[1:19:04] um you know this I believe it's the
[1:19:06] seraphims in Isaiah
[1:19:08] that they covered their face with wings
[1:19:11] and they covered their feet with wings
[1:19:13] and then they had a set of wings that
[1:19:15] they could fly
[1:19:16] you know that story watch what uh watch
[1:19:19] how Elijah answers when he finally does
[1:19:22] hear God's voice
[1:19:24] and it was so
[1:19:26] when Elijah heard it
[1:19:29] he wrapped his face in his mantle
[1:19:32] and went out and stood in the entering
[1:19:34] of the cave and behold there came a
[1:19:36] voice unto him and said what do us thou
[1:19:40] hear Elijah second time God's asking
[1:19:43] that question
[1:19:45] and again
[1:19:47] God knows all things
[1:19:50] and it looked like in the Bible looks
[1:19:53] like it's copied and pasted
[1:19:55] Elijah answers the exact same way and he
[1:20:00] said I have been very jealous for the
[1:20:02] Lord God of hosts because the children
[1:20:04] of Israel are forsaken thy Covenant
[1:20:05] thrown down thine altars and slain thy
[1:20:07] prophets with the sword and I even I
[1:20:10] only am left and they seek my life
[1:20:14] to take it away
[1:20:15] compared to verse 10 it's exactly the
[1:20:18] same
[1:20:21] and we look at God's voice
[1:20:24] and God's voice
[1:20:27] is very seldom
[1:20:30] patting us on the back
[1:20:32] and telling us you're good you're doing
[1:20:36] fine
[1:20:37] just just keep on going and he may say
[1:20:40] that
[1:20:41] but it's not usually the case
[1:20:44] always God's voice has a purpose
[1:20:50] it's a purpose for us to do something
[1:20:52] it's not we're crying out and we're Lord
[1:20:55] things are so bad he just ignored what
[1:20:59] Elijah said
[1:21:01] and he speaks this
[1:21:04] and the Lord said unto him
[1:21:06] go return on thy way to the Wilderness
[1:21:09] of Damascus and when thou comest anoint
[1:21:11] Hazel to be king over Syria and jehu the
[1:21:14] son of nimshi shalt thou anoint to be
[1:21:16] king over Israel
[1:21:19] and Elisha the son of shapeath and a
[1:21:23] bamaloa shalt thou anoint to be prophet
[1:21:26] in thy room
[1:21:28] and it shall come to pass that him that
[1:21:31] escape of the sword of Hazel shall jehu
[1:21:33] slay in him that escapeth from The Sword
[1:21:35] of jehu shall Elisha slay
[1:21:39] look at the purpose
[1:21:40] very specific purpose he didn't pad
[1:21:43] Elijah on the back and say oh you're
[1:21:45] fine you know no it's you're a good
[1:21:47] you're a good prophet and you're a good
[1:21:49] servant and and everything's okay we do
[1:21:51] that to each other
[1:21:53] that's why we're here we need to
[1:21:55] encourage each other we need to lift
[1:21:57] each other up and God uses us to do that
[1:21:59] but usually when he's speaking it's a
[1:22:02] purpose and he does not waste a word in
[1:22:06] anything that he says his words are so
[1:22:08] perfect everything is short and when God
[1:22:12] speaks to us he can say just a few words
[1:22:16] and a volume of books could never touch
[1:22:19] what he says because it brings it has
[1:22:21] Revelation that goes on with it
[1:22:25] and then the next verse
[1:22:27] is really is neat
[1:22:30] and God says
[1:22:33] what Elijah was praying I'm the only one
[1:22:35] and things are all bad
[1:22:37] God still loves us
[1:22:39] and he answered his question right here
[1:22:42] ye have left me seven thousand in Israel
[1:22:46] yea I have left me 7 000 in Israel all
[1:22:50] the knees which have not bowed unto Baal
[1:22:52] and every mouth which hath not kissed
[1:22:55] him
[1:22:56] brother Jeremy I'm glad I got it right
[1:22:58] this time when I was answering questions
[1:23:00] I I actually made a mistake I said that
[1:23:02] it was uh
[1:23:04] I forgot the the brother's name that was
[1:23:06] Elijah's servant and I'm glad that I got
[1:23:09] a chance to make it right in in this
[1:23:11] sermon but
[1:23:13] he said no no no no Elijah you're not
[1:23:15] the only one
[1:23:17] I've got I've got many others and and
[1:23:20] I'm using them also
[1:23:23] and I I think friends and and I'll I'll
[1:23:26] wrap it up if the musicians could come I
[1:23:29] don't want to it's Wednesday night I
[1:23:30] don't want to take too long
[1:23:33] I want you to remember what I say
[1:23:35] and that's why I try to try to keep it
[1:23:38] short but remember this voice
[1:23:43] that God speaks
[1:23:45] it has a purpose in it
[1:23:47] and we have to get quiet
[1:23:50] we have to get quiet we have to pray
[1:23:53] through because if we're getting in on
[1:23:55] our knees
[1:23:57] and we're praying
[1:23:59] and all of these voices which they are
[1:24:02] on all of us am I right
[1:24:05] these voices are hitting us and we're
[1:24:08] thinking if we're not thinking about
[1:24:09] work if that's not it we're thinking
[1:24:11] about somebody said this about about me
[1:24:14] or or this this other person or were
[1:24:18] all this turbulence in the water
[1:24:21] let the waters calm down
[1:24:23] get quiet before the Lord
[1:24:28] ask him Lord what is your will
[1:24:33] and take the time to do it he wants to
[1:24:37] talk to us
[1:24:39] and as we're moving forward as a church
[1:24:41] that's why I wanted to I wanted to
[1:24:42] preach about this on Wednesday night
[1:24:44] brother Joe
[1:24:45] because Wednesday night or generally as
[1:24:48] I've said before the pillars in the
[1:24:51] church are a lot more visible
[1:24:54] usually it's the Wednesday night crowd
[1:24:56] that are really making things happen
[1:24:59] and I wanted to talk about this subject
[1:25:01] to us here because we are the leaders in
[1:25:05] the church
[1:25:06] everyone here as I look out across this
[1:25:09] audience these are the leaders
[1:25:12] these are the ones that make things
[1:25:14] happen
[1:25:15] so let's pray together and as we move
[1:25:19] forward ask the lord lord what do you
[1:25:23] want me to do for your people
[1:25:26] and pray for each other
[1:25:28] and let's do like Elijah get quiet
[1:25:33] and hear that voice speak to us
[1:25:38] amen
[1:25:41] will you do it
[1:25:42] I want you to listen to that tape

[1:26:02] it'll encourage you
[1:26:04] it'll help you it really helped me
[1:26:07] really because it corrected me
[1:26:12] and one of the things brother Branham
[1:26:13] said he says don't get too busy
[1:26:17] even with the things of the church
[1:26:20] make sure you're taking the time to get
[1:26:22] quiet before the Lord
