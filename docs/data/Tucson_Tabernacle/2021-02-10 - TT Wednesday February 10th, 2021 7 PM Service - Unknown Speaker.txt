[Music] one more time [Music] last time [Music] prawn [Music] exchanged tell me when we're ready okay uh god bless you all thank you for giving me a moment to tell my testimony last sunday we were at home i was streaming the kids were still a little bit sick so thank you all for praying for them they're doing fine just taking a long time to get over it um but my dad said you know does anyone want to testify and i was so sad that i wasn't here i was like yeah i want to testify so here i am and the whole service was about faith and you know your confession and all that so it's just like kind of still in my heart that i wanted to do this so last year covet hit obviously lockdown came we were really isolated me being isolated with my thoughts is not a great idea but i was also on a medication that the side effects were nervousness and anxiety and i kind of battled anxiety a good portion of my life i felt like the lord had delivered me before um but because it was a side effect of the medication i kind of was just like oh it's a side effect it's fine and i let it back in so it came in and it took hold and it just like bound me overwhelm me and when i would get um anxious or nervous whatever i would you know sometimes go out for a jog or a walk and that always seemed to work clear my mind one day i went out and i came back and it was even worse and i remember telling amos i feel like i'm losing my mind and it was just so overwhelming well i um was listening to a message and uh it was and i wrote down the date and the message obviously um it was april 22nd it was late at night the kids had gone to bed and it was the angel in his commission preached in 1950 and a lot of the early services are about faith and there's a lot of like prayer lines and healing and stuff and at the end of one of the services um brother branham says this he says now just shake yourself a little bit pinch your inside part wake up what more could god do for you or what more could god do what more could he do he couldn't heal you against your faith no more than nothing he could he and if you do believe him you're healed anyhow and that struck me and i realized the only thing keeping from my healing was myself and so it hit my heart and at the end i believe he had the people stand up and say this prayer so i did i stood up and i said this prayer and it says lord god i now commit myself to you so help me god from this time on i'm going to testify of my healing regardless of what takes place and so i also so i had to pray for a little bit of grace because i know myself and how i like to doubt but i was like okay from now to eternity this is my confession so things changed for me my mind cleared you know if you know what anxiety and depression and nervousness feel like you know what that feels like but if you don't that's a really big blessing because it's so overwhelming yes so my mind cleared and like my mom could tell a difference she's like i can tell you know you're different and every time satan would try and give it back to me i would just rebuke him and stand on the word and remind him and sometimes just try and ignore it and just you know i was happy it was i forget that people were struggling we were in the middle of a pandemic because i was doing great the lord had touched me so come the end of the year i i like new year's i like to look back on what has happened and what i want to go for for the next year and i realized what a great like blessing amidst of all the struggle that i had received because i had been healed so i posted my testimony on facebook trying to you know be a better witness and to testify what the lord has done for me so i posted it and i was kind of like put a target on my back and satan said okay let's see if she really believes this so he came a little harder and i would just rebuke him stand on the word keep going and uh like two weeks ago i think it was two and a half weeks ago when brother glover was here i was here at that evening service and if you're here was just so powerful like you could feel the presence of the lord so strong and i think it was the next day elizabeth text us in a group chat saying you know she had been reading how brother branham said that next 72 hours the lord has done something for you sane's going to come after you so she's like let you know let's claim our victory and she was right that was the worst week i felt like i was beaten around i felt like the anxiety and nervousness and like before i call it oppressive overthinking because i'd lay down at night and it was just my mind would go and go and go and i couldn't sleep you know so those things started coming back and i would rebuke him satan and throw the word at him and just keep claiming the verses doing the things you should do to stand on the word of god and i kind of felt like i was drowning i felt like i was under six feet of mud standing on the word you know just overwhelmed so i'd like to think at the end of the week i was victorious and you know i gained ground not that the lord had to rescue me instead i don't i don't know but the next week it eased up and it still was there a little bit but i kept revoking it and standing on the word a little bit of a testimony in that week i was thinking you know i should text nina she um when i'm struggling she's the one i can text because she knows what i'm going through and she'll pray for me and i pulled out my phone right after that and she had texted me asking me will you pray for me i'm going through something so i kind of laughed and we prayed for each other and the burden eased for both of us after we prayed so that was really nice so the next week it eased up and my mind was a little bit clearer and i just kept reviewing satan and claiming the word come to this week my mind was clear again it's like this is what that like clarity of mine feels like this is fantastic so i just wanted to take this opportunity to testify what the lord has done for me and to remind satan that the blood of the lord jesus christ has healed me i am free from anxiety from nervousness like that oppressive overthinking and he can never ever take that away from me this is [Music] this i'm gonna let it shine let it shine let it shine [Music] don't let satan blow i'm gonna let it shine let it shine let it shine let it shine let it i'm shine let it shine let it shine till jesus comes i'm gonna let it shine let it shine till jesus comes i'm gonna let it shine let it shine let it shine let it shine this little light this little light of mine and i'm gonna [Music] i'm gonna let it shine let it shine let it shine let it shine brother jeremy could you come up pray for the prayer request we have one prayer request tonight from sister shirley she said uh please pray for mercy zomborono's niece betty for salvation and healing of her kidneys also sister mercy would like a touch from god to help her with her balance let's let's all stand god bless you all i was listening to the tape leadership today and brother branham said this little one-liner and he said the holy ghost only feeds on the word and um when you listen to tapes the holy ghost only magnifies himself so i encourage you to listen to tapes i encourage you to pray because the bible says god answers prayer it's not so much that we talk to one another but he answers prayer just like sister abby's testimony we got together and we prayed things settled down it was great you know god's on time comes in the power of your need we just like to bow our heads and take this need to the lord [Music] great heavenly father we just we love you we're ordained to love you and it's it's so wonderful to see like precious faith on display lord it's it's really hard to get up here and talk in front of good peers they're all christians [Music] and it's it's hard to magnify that but lord we we want to lord we should be able to come to one another and confess our faults not not everyone's gonna pray for us but lord if we have maybe one friend just going through something you know sometimes we don't have to speak it because you already know it we just have to say that it's unspoken it's within our heart and lord you look on our hearts and we grow lord if we're not it's so so good to absorb what you you give us to eat lord but we'd love love to bear fruit of it just don't let us all be here suddenly but to ours lord because we're your light that you shine through us and we just give you glory we give you honor we give you praise and we shall overcome by the blood of the lamb we just pray that this request lord that you'll meet it because it's your will to heal it's your will to deliver and your will to of uplift and we're so grateful we ask you to bless brother aaron as he ministers your word lord represents the light in this darkness hour and lord we represent the light too lord you should find a bonfire here tonight yes one that unchews evil and talks about the light we just love you lord we appreciate your goodness to us bless the needy lord give us strength to continue to endure for we need to endure this last leg we just love you father encourage our hearts in your precious name lord jesus christ amen [Music] let's invite brother aaron out at the time at this time [Music] touching jesus [Music] there is only one way to touch it just believe [Music] touching jesus [Music] man is only one way to touch his name one more time then your life will never be the same there's only [Music] just believe when you call on his name aren't you so happy that he doesn't say the only way you could reach him is when you're perfect because you would never get to him but he's provided a way and he said if you'll just come through that provided way just believe you can touch him amen let's bow our hands lord even the songs that were sung today as david cried out created me a clean heart oh god and renew a right spirit in me and then search me oh god and know my heart today and then this little light of mine i'm going to let it shine lord you know how that ties so well with the thoughts in my heart today which lord it just it's just you on the scene lord hear it even brother jeremy's prayer have his testimony how it all just reminds us what a mighty god we serve and lord and that we're part of your plan lord and we appreciate it lord we just want to thank you we just want to love you this evening we just we want to hear from you lord we'll open our hearts we'll bear ourselves before you say here i am lord speak to me today we ask it in jesus christ's name amen amen thank you thank you we had asked brother or mentioned to brother peter when we finished speaking last wednesday night and wondered is there another part to this or did we go in a different direction and god knew there was another part to this so you may be seated just a couple of announcements spoke to brother isaiah chisholm today and he was up in cottonwood yesterday ministering for brother chris long and then tonight for brother dale smith up in flagstaff but he said to greet you folks and that he enjoyed himself the presence of the lord the atmosphere everything was just so wonderful and he had sent a text to brother matt kind of saying the same thing and i spoke to brother matt for a few moments today and he said brother isaiah just kind of repeated those things it was just a pleasure to be here with you so i appreciated him coming and sharing his heart and i said so when are you going home he says i'm going home wednesday and i i've got a call already to go minister at a church on sunday and i said you're 60 years old but you act like you're 18. you know but the joy of the lord is your strength when there is a light when there is something in it can it constrains you it makes you even though maybe you're sitting there and saying i'm tired i'm worn out but something inside of me says you know and i appreciate that so also um there's a young couple here today and um they're they're going to have 50 years married this weekend i don't know the exact date what day is it the 13th lyle and sister heather 50 years married i didn't speak to sister heather about it but brother lyle and he made a comment he said she has a blind spot for me she doesn't look at anything else wrong she just looks at me with a and he called it a blind spot and i'm reminded i was reminded when when we had our 41st and my wife said i'm going to keep you you're a keeper and i said why she said because i don't want to train another one so my question was so i'm trained she gave me a funny look then but you know god has been good to us you know he saw this from eternity he didn't say it would be smooth sailing all the time but he said there is an end an expected end and i appreciate the goodness of the lord in the grace of god so as i was looking and saying lord in in this we started with why fear when you realize that god has met every one of the requirements every need it's things that he's provided why fear there's no reason to be afraid there's no reason to start thinking how is it going to work but we're humans and we do and we question it i i really appreciate when brother matt says here and here god knows it all alpha and omega but we're in the middle here and that's the hard part but you look and you see god has it under control god has it in his hands and and um what else to us seems like forever is but a moment in god's time and one of these days we'll step into that time and we'll realize brother brahm says you'll travel like a thought you know and the things that we don't comprehend right now we've seen a few things we've gotten to taste some uh those that have shared experiences of goddess so we know it's real i can testify i know it's real god has done things but in this flesh you can't live in that atmosphere all the time but soon and very soon there's going to be a body change and that's our desire that's our or what we long for but as as i was looking and i was reading something and and this this made me realize there was another part to this and that is we have a part to play in this redemption you know there's something that we are to do something that we are because we're the body of jesus christ you know and and let me just say it this way the the head is is what controls the body but the body has to go out and do it my head tells me get up and go and my feet say uh i'm still tired i haven't you know there's a response there's a but but when the body is working like it's supposed to it's an amazing thing that god has done but when things go wrong and we heard testimony today of of things that that can go wrong but god is still god and it also makes us appreciate when we go through something and god delivers everyone realize how much god loves us makes us appreciate it also makes us look at somebody else's suffering and have compassion on that one and ask for god's mercy so i want to read a few quotes here and um it's there's i think three or four maybe five of them we're going to read those and then we're going to get into some scriptures here and we'll start with redemption in completeness in joy says i've got kind of like a fleece before the lord for this meeting and i'm expecting god to do something that will start the meeting a rolling right here in the city i'm under expectation i just didn't come to the thing and say well i'm under expectation he says i'm expecting something from god and you have to approach god that way lord it's your word you keep your word and i'm expecting that you don't come in self-righteousness you don't approach and say i deserve it you say god i'm taking you at your word and that pleases him look at this roman centurion a roman century not even what we would call a believer but he realized god's authority and he said i have authority like this i realize that i say they do so you speak and god said i have not found faith like this you know so he says i am expecting god to do something that will start the media rolling right here in this city you pray do your part and then he says when judgment comes we can all stand and say we did our part so that started kind of the ball rolling here there is a part the body has a part the uniting time and sign oh my no wonder they came where is he where is he that's born king of the jews we've seen his star in the east and have come to worship him where is he they know that that that infant messiah was laying somewhere because god gave them a sign of the time and we know god is somewhere because of all that god has shown us he's the same yesterday but it shouldn't be where we're having to go look for him there should be such an experience or relationship now in your life that you know where he is should be in you should be in me he says but here he says gave them a sign the timing and god and man were uniting together what a unity unity when god united himself in a human body the principle the greatest of all uniting that was ever done when god united with a man and left his great strain of being god and stretched forth his tent and took in humanity and became one of them to redeem them unity that what that brought peace between god and man forever how thankful we are god doing his part he had to step down into a body of flesh in order to understand us in order to be able to be touched by the feeling of our infirmities in in order to hear the cry when a mother uh cries out oh lord help me with my children the bible says he learned by the things he suffered the you know it's hard to imagine him being a teenager but he was it's hard to imagine being a child running around getting in the way but he did he had brothers there that the bible says he had to learn to get along that's the only way he would say lord help me i'm having trouble with my sibling and then he could say well it's just hard to put him in that level but that's what he did god's gifts always find their place and this was the quote that kind of really said it mary the mother of jesus in the city of nazareth the meanest city there was in the land but out of there god chose a little lady to give birth to his son an incubator a womb that had to a baby had to be born by he took such a person to do it god just didn't create out of the sky a little baby and put it there it went through the same process of a natural birth god works through human beings to redeem human beings he can take you work through you to redeem humanity if you'll completely dedicate everything you are this little light of mine i'm gonna let it shine i don't know that brother matt said i know what brother aaron's preaching so i must sing that song no that's god working things and i was enjoying myself back there with lord you're you're working this you're doing this in simplicity he says if you're a young woman dedicate your morals if you're a young man dedicate your morals dedicate your mind dedicate your thinking dedicate your heart dedicate your soul dedicate all you are and let christ work through that what a glorious thing now it's not you doing the work it's you giving yourself over to him and letting him do the work you know um one of the things that that we teach somebody or in the shopping house is let the tool do the work don't force it when you force it it causes more trouble when you try to get it to do something it's let it do the work let him do the work in you you yield you surrender you say here i am lord that and it's amazing how that works and then you stop and you go why did i struggle so much for this and then tomorrow you get up in the morning hey you got to do it again every day every moment you know i was reading something from the daily strength and talking about dedicating yourself um you know with uh luther with a just shall shall live by faith and and wesley for sanctification and i was looking at some things that brother branham said about sanctification you're not sanctifying yourself you're yielding yourself to let him sanctify you now there are things that you can do to put yourself in a place where he can sanctify you if you're going to places you shouldn't be how is god going to take and do that but putting yourself in a place where hey lord here i am i'll dedicate this hour to that i have right now to you lord and let him work i'll i'll avoid the other things i'll turn off all the the the things that are about i'll give you some time to work in my heart lord and let him do that it's his work you know when we try to sanctify ourselves it becomes laws it becomes works and works and laws really just take you to fear because all it says is that enough is it enough is it enough is this good enough or it takes you to the other side i'm good enough i deserve it both ways are wrong but if you'll sit with a humble heart and he says dedicate yourself to him watch what he'll do questions and answers the next quote there and watch watch here what brother braham says and then there was another thing that was a conversion of omar price down there that time when he was so critical against me and you know he come to the tabernacle and was baptized in the name of the lord jesus oh he fought me so hard on that and i stayed with him at nighttime i just kept loving him staying right there just the same but he finally come because the lord told me he was going to come so i just stayed right there with him so i'm asking you this question how do you know that person is not a child of god because i gave him the word test and he didn't accept it [Music] well then somebody else comes and gives them a different word test and then somebody else comes in but what about just loving somebody and being a christian in front of them what about your life being the word of god displayed rather than so much our words because you get 10 people get up here to give the instructions on how to win somebody by the word test you're going to get 10 different ways to do it which one is right but if it's christ in you the hope of glory then you can give to somebody else the hope of glory such as i have i give unto you in the name of jesus christ not in the name of peter not in the name of john not in the name of william branham not in the name of tucson tabernacle but in the name of the lord jesus christ why because he was in them i want to show a hands on this how many know they have the holy ghost so you can do the same thing that peter did oh but that was for peter he was a disciple then who are you is god lessened over this time no he's still the same yesterday today and forever he said i just stayed i loved him and it made me think how do i know that person is or is not a child of god i've got to treat it like every one of them is well he sure doesn't look like one while he sure or she now before the eyes of god all of us are filth if we're looking at it this way not a righteous righteous one at all i don't care how you address us what you do if you're looking at it that way but i believe god has saved me has cleansed me has made me so if he can do it for me he can do it for somebody else but who is he going to use sometimes when somebody would listen he had to use a donkey why because the donkey was willing to listen and be used sometimes we're so hard-headed that and we're so s stuck in our ways that god says well go ahead if you're going to be that way go deal with it yourself the last quote there what was the holy ghost give them for and in the cool of the evening he would come down and commune with him and there he lost that fellowship because sin would not let him do it and then he was made flesh and dwelt among us in order that he could come back again to man and live in a man and restore a man to the state of communion with him again and give him back his god-given right it's a god-given right god said it's yours it's not an earned right it's a god-given right that's what he did that's the purpose of the holy ghost it's the father again god the father dwelling in you working out his plans to finish his plan of redemption working through you making you a co-worker with him giving you a place giving you a part for your fallen lost brother and sister giving you his spirit and his love to go hunt the lost as he did in the garden of eden adam adam or art thou that's what the holy spirit does to a man or a woman when it strikes into their heart and it takes its abode there's a thirst and a hungering for lost souls amen you look at your neighbor you look at your brother you look at your sister you look at the person walking down the street and you say oh that they would have this that i have it's not it's without money it's without price it's not a sales giving it's something burning from inside of you wanting to be expressed that little that little fountain that little spring brother branham's talking to it and saying what is it about that why and he said it's just inside of me i couldn't stop it if i wanted to stop it it's important so somebody come by and say come come by and say in this midst of trouble and trial and what's going on how can you be smiling and be happy i just can't help it it's something inside of me well then tell me how to get it tell me and that's how do you know that isn't a child of god and it made me re as i was thinking of some of this just struck me this way brother branham on that boat and says little fishy i give you back your life has god changed is he the same yesterday today and forever could you then say brother sister whatever it is i give you life you have it in you you can't give it i i know that that's real it's happened with me there was a and i've shared it with a uh i don't remember how old she was my little young girl playing in the back here and something happened to her and sister carolyn miles and sister saundra came running up with her and and sister carolyn had her kind of holding her like this and kind of folded over with in her head's back like this and her eyes had rolled back and she was just white and she said brother aaron and i looked at it and i said little sister in the name of jesus christ i give you back your life instantly i didn't stop to consecrate myself or anything just and her head came straight back up her eyes rolled over and she said put me down and she took off ronnie it had it works you know i i don't know what stage she was in that's all i saw it's still the same yesterday today and forever and and then you know when brother braham says little fishy i give you back your life and and there was five times of the spoken word why because brother branham was special sure he was called and god was jesus but he was a man just like you and me and a man who accepted it and lived with it you hear when he is speaking you can hear both sides he's he's talking about himself and and sometimes he's he's making himself so low i'm no good i'm nothing and there's other times he's standing and he's saying i know where i'm standing i know who's here with me and i take every spirit under my control and if we're not careful we let every spirit take under control of us but we can we have that same god he's sitting there and he's squirrel hunting and that voice speaks to him what are you here for what are you here for and brother branham speaks those squirrels into existence it works god is the same yesterday today and forever now what brother branham doesn't tell that story is he consecrated himself for five years alone in the monastery to get that no he was out hunting that morning and god looked at his heart and said what would you desire well i'm hunting it happened to me al cuntin almost three and a half years ago i had shot at one and missed missed twice and i was sitting there and sitting down on the ground there and and at first i was quite disappointed because i'm probably not going to get another shot and then i just began to thank the lord that i'd even got a chance to see one and shoot at one there were those that weren't even going to see an elk and that voice that has spoken to me before said what are you here for and my answer was that was for brother branham that's exactly how i answered it and then again he asked what are you here for took about four times before i realized he's asking me what i'm here for i can speak what i want sitting there i looked up on the hill i said i want the elk to come from there come down this trail come right down the middle and go right through here and i just said thank you lord i stayed sitting there my boss was with me he was using the binoculars and i look up right where i pointed i saw the body of two elk i could not see their heads they were behind the trees his name is jim i said jim up there and he gets the binoculars and he goes don't shoot the first one shoot this the don't shoot the second one shoot the verse or don't i'm sorry don't shoot the first one shoot the second one i said i've got a heart shot on the first one and a gut shot on the thing when he goes i'll wait till it moves and that's when the six by six stepped out and i exactly where i had pointed shot him that's where he fell but the other elk ran down that trail came right down the middle ran in front of us turned around and ran back up and it was until later that day that i realized exactly what i actually happened you don't have to believe it but i know it did he's the same yesterday today and forever so if he can do that and you know what brother branham said god did that so that he could have confidence when he's standing before the people that god would answer the same you can sit there in a situation that looks hopeless but the god of hope is lying in your heart he is part of you and therefore you're part of the plan of redemption the words you speak make a difference now let's just go through some scriptures here let's start with luke chapter one and there'll be a fair amount of scripture reading but can't go wrong with scripture reading that's the word of god you know i could read you what so-and-so says about it and what this man thought about it and there might be some great thoughts and i don't have any problem with that there are some wonderful men out there but god's word never fails as men sometimes we have to do some then have to take it back and say you now that i've looked at it i found a better way this was good but this is better this is eternal brother branhav said if he ever did it once he will continue to do it the same way because it was perfect the first time so luke chapter 1 with verse we'll go to from verse 28 to 38 and these are all from luke and john and then we'll go into acts the book of acts there now what is the book of acts it's god himself indwelling his chosen people those that he call right and it's the acts of the holy ghost in those that it's written it was recorded for us and what are we being restored back to that true pentecost where it's god in the people where it's god manifesting himself it's going all the way back to eden again that's what it is not just a good story not just a good a feel-good thing but a reality eternal reality and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou amongst among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation should this be i just want to let you know mary was human she was not the saint that the catholic churches have made next to god she was a human being could you imagine that salutation coming up to you and something like that sister and you know your reaction it would be like what me you know the next verse and the angel said under fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god and i said to you brother sister fear not you have found favor with god amen you have abby she shared the reality of finding favor with god because god desires to do those things it's his nature it's it's character it's what he does if i could say it makes him happy and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name jesus because of isaiah said this and his word is being fulfilled he shall be great and shall be called son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end and then mary said unto the angel how shall this be seen i know not a man everything i know about this has to be done this way this is this is how a child comes but something in her is because in isaiah a virgin shall conceive had been spoken and god had to find a resting place to set that fulfilling of that word and something in mary begins to respond to that and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god look that hasn't changed the holy ghost shall come upon thee and that holy thing in you is the son of god is jesus himself that hasn't changed it's not a series of works it's not a series of quotes it's not it's god in you the hope of glory let's go to on there and behold watch this and thy cousin elizabeth she has also conceived a son in her old age and this was a sixth month with her who was called barren for with god nothing shall be impossible and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed the joy of the angel knowing that it had been fulfilled as i can go now i've done the part you know and you know when you have done what god has asked you to do you can leave and be at rest and joy you've done with god and you put it in god's hands he'll take care of it you know you put the plant in the ground you've dug you put you put the water you let it grow because that's what it's going to do you put it in somebody's heart and you know and let god bring the increase now we'll go on to 41 i believe it was and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost and she spoke with out with a loud voice and said blessed art thou among woman and blessed is the fruit of thy womb and whence is this to me that the mother of my lord should come to me look for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears the babe leaped for in my womb for joy mary had to speak mary had to say something there had to be something that and that baby inside was given life and blessed is she that believed for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord it could just be a good christmas story or you can see that he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and that hasn't changed those things which god has said and there shall be a performance of those things there will be a people there is a people that are letting those things happen in their life and they are looked at sometimes strange and wondered about but that's okay if they did that with jesus if they've done that with me how much more with you now let's look at john 1 first chapter in 29 through 37. now here's a part that another human plays in this redemption plan the next day john seeth jesus coming unto him and saith behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world what an announcement you know all that has happened since our father adam fell well there's one that's come today here he is he's going to make it all right he's going to restore us back to that place and john gets to make that announcement it wasn't announced in the heavens it wasn't a sky written in the heavens a man announced it with his voice this is he of whom i said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me he was for he was before me john is speaking here and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest to israel therefore i might come baptizing with water and john bare records saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and a podium but john had to make that announcement come see a man she ran down after she saw she ran down to samaria and said come see a man and said many believed what if she would have stayed there oh this is so wonderful so beautiful it's all mine no something made that samaritan run down into samaria and say come see a man let's continue reading there and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining him on him the same is which baptizes with the holy ghost and i saw and bear record that this is the son of god i saw and bare record this is god living in me this is god being manifested it's not me it's not myself you have to bear that same record and again the next day after john stood and two of his disciples and looking upon jesus as he walked he saith behold the lamb of god and watch the result and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed jesus that's the reason for that is to get somebody else to know him to love him to follow him to get into the same place that you're at it's that life in you it's that bubbling spring that you can't help now let's go into the next scriptures and this will be all in the book of acts i believe now so what is the book of acts it's what the holy spirit is doing through the disciples through the apostles through the men and women of of that area in jerusalem to begin with with god in them and when the day of pentecost was fully come and they were all with one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each them and they were filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as a spirit gave them utterance one to four so we know now watch now we're going to skip some parts we're going to jump to verse 14. but peter's standing here with the eleven lift up his voice we know the people said they're drunk there's something wrong with these people and peter says no this is something else but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto him ye man of judea and all you that dwell at jerusalem be it known unto you and hearken unto my words peter is speaking this isn't jesus speaking this is peter speaking hearken unto my words for these are not drunken as you suppose see that is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel this is what god said he was going to do and now he has performed it and it shall come to pass in the last days faith god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your among young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my handmaidens i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy amen is he the same yesterday today and forever was that only for peter no this is a promise because he says to you and continues to go on and going over to verse 37 watch the effect and did i i miss a couple of scriptures i have here uh verses 37 maybe i i missed a sec yeah now when they heard this they were pricked in their hearts all that peter said to them they were pricked in their hearts and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do what if just put yourself in that point your neighbor your coworker your brother your sister and you've just shared with them and they ask you what do i do that there's a uh is something in their heart crying what do we do now how do we get this that you have then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call it hasn't stopped it didn't stop there that day of pentecost in jerusalem it's continuing he said until that last one as brother branham was when he was reading in the message until that last one whose name is in the book has got there yet and with and with many other words did he testify and exhaust saying let's we'll just leave that part right there 41 was it was 41 and 47 not the whole run there 41 and they gladly received his word and were baptized and that same day there were added unto them about 3 000 souls praising god in verse 47 and having favor with all the people and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved because peter dared to stand the same peter who had denied him the same peter who was loud and obnoxious at times and god had to rebuke him sometimes and he and he says ah don't you die and say and jesus turn around get thee behind me satan not calling peter saying he knew what spirit was motivating that the same they said i will not deny thee i will go with you i as you're going to deny me through three times he goes and he hides in shame and after jesus resurrection and he tells us go tell my disciples and peter too sometimes you have to be the and peter too some things you've done in your life some actions you had some ways you felt and you fill yourself with but god says no you're still included in this you're still part of this and if god can take somebody like me then why couldn't he take somebody like any all the others he had to die a full penalty of death with every every bruise and every cut and every drop of blood to redeem me it covers everybody covers everybody acts chapter 5 verses 1 through 5. now just watch here but a certain man named ananias with sapphire and his wife sold a possession and kept back part of the price you know keeping back part of the price was not the problem sometimes you say i'm going to do this i'm a lot this i'm a little like that fine that's what you said you're going to do it's not a problem with that but if you represent it wrong something different takes place and he kept back part of the price his wife also being private to it and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles feet uh but now in peter there's what we call the holy ghost in peter the discerner and the thoughts in the intents of the heart but peter said ananias why has satan filled thine heart to lie to the holy ghost where was the holy ghost in peter where's the holy ghost in you and to keep back part of the price of the land while it remained was it not thine own and after it was so was it not thine own power why has thou conceived this thing in thine heart thou has not lied unto men but unto god yet he was talking to peter but the god in here the one that has the power to life and death in peter now he says you weren't lying to peter you were lying to the god that lies within me and ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghosts and great fear came up on all of them that heard these things we know the rest of the story his wife does the same thing you know but watch this brother branham is told there's a trap laid for you and that night in the service if there was a young couple he said being immoral just well and this this holy spirit told him speak whatever you will and it shall happen did he not say that to him yes brother anything he could have said could have happened but there was something in him but brother branham who says amazing grace that saved a wretch like me calls out and says i can give them life i can give them that same hope that i have and he says i forgive you the spirit of christ does not condem it does not destroy it goes seeking those who are lost you and i don't know who those are so everyone we walk and see we should treat them as one who has the potential to receive christ you're not the judge let god judge that acts chapter eight we'll read verses 26 through 31 and then 35 to 39 and i did that way just to shorten it some watch this and the angel of the lord spake unto him and i know you've never read these scriptures it's all new to you right no it's the word of god and the angel of the lord spake unto philip saying arise and go towards the south the unto the way they go down from jerusalem unto gaza which is desert and he arose and went and behold a man of ethiopia a eunuch of great authority under candace queen of the ethiopians who had the charge of all the treasure and who had come to jerusalem to worship was returning and sitting in his in his chair reading isaiah the prophet and the spirit said unto philip go near and join thyself to this chariot so philip ran them there to him and heard him read the prophet isaiah and said understandeth thou without readers and he said how can i accept some man guide me and he desired philip that he would come up and sit with him philip well no it doesn't work that way you have to have the holy ghost come and fall upon you and hit no philip went up and said because now that holy ghost is lying in philip and the one who wrote the book and has the full understanding of it then now using philip's voice could begin to express what the word of god is and he hasn't changed now he says and then philip let's let's see we were going to go 35-30 on yes then philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him jesus not peter not the apostles not mary he preached to them jesus and they went on their way and they came to a certain water and the eunuch said see here's water what does hinder me to be baptized that which uh philip spoke to him is now burning in his heart and philip said if thou believest with all thine heart thou missed and the answer said i believe that jesus christ is the son of god and he commanded chariot to stand still and they went down both into the water both philip and the enoch and baptized him and when they were come out of the water the spirit of the lord caught away philip that eunuch saw him nor no more and he went on his way rejoicing the joy of who knows what he was singing what he was rejoicing what he was saying this little white of mine i'm going to let it shine but what god used a man named philip it's a book of acts is he not the same yesterday today and forever and let's go to acts chapter 9 and we'll read verse 1 and then we'll go to 10 and 16. and saul yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the lord went unto the high priest now you know the story there saul well he was still named saul in his righteousness self-righteousness of the law was going to take care of all these problems he was going to put an end to this heresy because that was saul under his own spirit now god knew that you and i would have never given saul a chance to be paul he said no way no way that just doesn't work we need somebody who has nev no god can take the vilest dirtiest uh i don't mean this wrong but a filthiest person man or woman and make him a true child saint of god i'm a i'm testimony of that how many are two here what god has done he's the same yesterday today and forever and then and there was a certain disciple at damascus and we know paul's experience now he's had that pillar fire that knocked him off blinds him and there was a certain disciple in damascus named ananias and to him the say the lord in a vision ananias and he said bo behold i am here lord obviously ananias had enough experience to know who was speaking to him because he immediately responds here i am lord and the lord said unto him arising go into the street which is called straight and inquire the house of judas for one called saul of tarsus for behold he prayeth and he's seen a vision in a vision a man named ananias coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive sight and an eye and answer lord haven't you seen the latest news haven't you read the paper lord haven't you heard what's really going on with this guy you know come on get caught up with what's happening now you know lord i have heard by many of this man how much evil he has done to thy saints at jerusalem he justifies himself right there lord he's done so much he's hurting the believers lord how you know i don't know i might have had the same reaction you know and here he hath authority from the chief priest to bind all that call on thy name but the lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the gentiles and kings and the children of israel for i will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake that last part gets added in there too as brother lyle spoke here it comes with could i save the package the benefits package we will suffer but we will ring ananias go pray for this man and then i said yes lord after he argued with him for a little while lord i want to do it but but here we go acts 10 44 through 48. we know the story here peter cornelius peter's up in the temple up in the uh the room up top on the roof resting and cornelius is something in his heart is crying out maybe he doesn't really know what it is but something's crying out there's got to be more to life than this while peter yet spake these words after he comes and he means and you you know the story there god working on both ends since peter over there in cornelius he's expecting him because that's how god works and while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell on them which heard the word and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished as many as came with peter because that on the gentiles also was poured out the gift of the holy ghost oh my lord do you know what you're doing those are gentiles lord hey that may be a believer that may be a child of god there just share what you have let it take its effect let it root down in somebody's heart just like it wrote it down in yours for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify god then answered peter can any man forbid water that these should be not should not be baptized which have received the holy ghost as well as we and he commanded them to be baptized come on over and have another cup of tea with me and share some more of this good news the same neighbor that may have thought you were crazy before that but something inside begins to cry out and if you have it you can give it acts 15 36 through 40. and some days after paul said unto barnabas men full of the holy ghost they were still men let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the lord and see how they do and barnabas determined to to take with him john whose surname was mark but paul thought not good to take him with him who departed from them from family and went not with him to the work and the contention was so sharp between them that they departed asunder one from the other so barnabas took mark and sailed and unto cyprus and paul chose silas and departed being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of god i'd love to say that when the holy ghost dwells your life you're not human anymore but you still have this body you still have to yield it you still have to surrender you still have to say i'm sorry forgive me and he does it doesn't make you a robot it doesn't make you an angel it makes you a child of god filled with the holy ghost who still has to battle with the sky daily that's why these things were put in the word of god so we would understand that and then from there we'll go what was the next scriptures i put acts 69 i think now remember brother lyle spoke here how about that macedonian call and sometimes there's a call in your life sometimes there's something to go go this way turn down this way and somebody there for you to help but it's not your job to save them it's your job to give them share with them i i remember one time driving down the road and i was on the company vehicle with david's kitchens then and there was a flat a car with a flat tire it was a big old cadillac the big cars back then with an older couple the lady was standing outside and she was an older lady so i stopped and to help so i offered to fix you know change out the tire and it was close it's on on silver belt close to the um animal control place there just right right in front there so i began to help her and i put i changed the tire for her the jack and all and she said how much do i owe you i said nothing i didn't do this for money right about there her husband was coming back up this is kind of funny i still laugh think about a laugh and her husband comes up and says what do we owe you and she says oh honey honey no no he doesn't want anything but that's what i told her well it's what i told her all she was doing was telling him what i had said i keep my word and said no thank you now when i drove away i said you could have got some money out of this but you know be a christian keep your word they saw the davis kitchen sign there i don't know that's who i was being employed at the time i was during work hours i was being paid by them maybe somebody said hey i'm gonna i need a kitchen i don't know i was just but it is it is part of the life of a christian because when god is walking through the the jerusalem all of their and there's a situation he would stop jesus would stop they there's a funeral procession and the the sadness and the cry affected him he went raise him from the dead never said now you owe me you got to come to my next meetings and you better fill the offering box up had nothing to do with it i remember a testimony of a ministering brother and it was two brothers and they were ministering they were busy and they were sharing the testimony when they were pen in a pentecostal organization and they were traveled with this one minister and he would tell them what stories he was going to tell the congregation that day or the meeting so he could draw the offering out of him and he would tell him the sob stories and he goes they were made up he said he was so good at it he said me and the other brother would put offering two he goes that that spirit too both spirits work satan has deceived many god has saved his children they were and he goes not only that he said but folks would the sisters would bake him a cake or a pie or something it would come in he said we we traveled with him we'd be in his office and he would take it and dump it right into the trash can and then he would say when he's behind the pulpit he would say oh and thank you for the cake oh it was well taken care of he goes he was throwing him in the trash is that the life of a christian is that the life of god no he went even where he was not wanted why did he go there because he knew there was a woman that was going to be coming by a woman of ill fame a woman that nobody wanted around and was going to come and wash his feet he knew there was one there and he was willing to go and be embarrassed shamed made fun of for that one so a vision appeared to paul in the night there stood a man in macedonia and prayed for him prayed him saying come over to macedonia and help us and it came to pass as they went to prayer a certain damsel possessed where the spirit of divination met us and brought her her masters much again saying but much gain made their income you know the story here they get thrown in prison for casting the demon out of that damsel you know you go share the gospel with somebody and it revives them there's some people are going to get upset there are some people that are going to get mad they're going to say he used to be our drinking buddy she used to hang with us i think but not no more but to the one who received that life it meant eternity to that one so he says so let's go on so i just just wanted to highlight that where we go and when they had laid many stripes on them they cast them into prison charging the jailer to keep them safe the lord through paul delivers one who's being tormented by spirits and the reward was at it is he got beaten whipped and thrown in jail and this is where i always say silas has got some thoughts and some questions paul you've you've told us of these wonderful things god is but you you didn't tell us the whole story you know we went here and over there and here but you know there's a lot more of the story sometimes you know and when the who having received such a charge thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks um couldn't go anywhere so paul says let's take advantage of this we're not going anywhere why don't we begin to have a service and worship the lord here rather than mope and cry and complain let's begin to praise the lord i think paul had been here before maybe had done this before and at midnight paul and silas prayed and sang praises unto god and the prisoners heard them and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were open and everyone's bands were loosed it's amazing how god opens doors with earthquakes huh even for peter and then he gets there to the when the angels combine to deliver him and he gets to the house and they're going that can't be peter you're in prison oh he's still the same yesterday today and forever and the keeper of the prison awakening out of his sleep and seeing the doors open he drew out his sword and would have killed him hoping that the prisoners had fled now can you imagine if that happened here in one of the prisons in tucson i don't know how many of them would stay a lot of them would run but paul crowed with a loud voice saying do myself no harm for we're all here. now did paul go out and check to see if they were all there i don't think so i think that was the holy ghost in him just speaking out then he called for a light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before paul and silas and brought them out and said sirs what must i do to be saved well you've got to clean up your life you got to change you got to go repent about this you got to go death you got to go do this much service you got to go do this you got to come the way i came okay that's the only way god saves people no what did paul say and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house you know paul knew if anybody paul knew his background he writes it i was a a hebrew of hebrews the law and all he said but i also know i killed christians i persecuted them i was a i was against this thing that we called heresy paul in no wise could glorify himself and he knew that but he also knew what god had done in his life and they spake unto him the word of the lord and all that were in his house and he took them that same hour of the night and washed their stripes and was baptized he and all his straightway and when he had brought them into his house he set meat before them and rejoiced believing in god with all his house and silas goes paul it was worth it but a couple hours ago he's asking paul how did we get in here i think he was human acts 18 verses 5 through 11 finishing up with this and when silas and timotheus were come from macedonia's paul was pressed in the spirit and testified to the jews that jesus was a christ and when they opposed themselves and blasphemed he shook his raven and said unto them your blood be upon your own heads i am clean from henceforth i will go to the gentiles paul gave them that option you give them that option you let them make the decision lay it before them what they do with it you don't have control over that but it's your responsibility to be a christian before them and when let's go on to the and he departed then and entered into a certain man's house named justice one that worshipped god whose house joined hard to the synagogue and crispus and the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the lord with all his house and many of the corinthians hearing believed and were baptized and now we have the book of corinthians and now we have all this that was recorded and written because god indwelled a man and that man went out and shared the good news and then spake the lord to paul in this night by vision do not be afraid but speak and hold not thy peace for i am with thee no man shall set beyond thee to hurt thee for i have much people in this city god knew that told paul don't worry about it i have much people that's why you're here you know why you're here on earth today because you represent and give light the lord jesus christ to others the only source of life remember the brother branham talks about the little two and a half dog i think he called it half tall and too long got run over by a car and brother brahm reminds the lord you said if i delighted myself in you you would give me the desires of my heart and he goes and gives that dog back its life remember a possum coming up there to his house because it's christ in you the hope of glory that's how he works today that's what he does today and i know it's a whole lot easier to be around all the christians and you know it's it's it's a beautiful harmony when all the believers are together but we have to go out and shine this light wherever we are and i always remember that fellowship that brother branham is having up in colorado the musicians with me come up he's having that fellowship in colorado with the lord jesus god himself and a storm comes into the way and begins to disrupt it and god tells them speak to the storm because i want to continue this fellowship when that storm in your life begins to interfere with the fellowship between you and god speak to the storm say no not today i'm having fellowship with the king of kings and the lord of lords your part of redemption is to share what god has done for you to someone else and give them life amen say lord help me let me be a true witness let this life that is in me that comes for you be sure to others bow our hands lord it puts us a challenge today it's easy just to stay at home and sit down and say well if they're of god they'll come but how do we not know that somebody is waiting for someone to come and share and that one is you that one is me maybe not by words sometimes it's just an action you told them well you gave me a cold cup of water you fed me you clothed me and they asked you when did you do this and he said to these when you came and you did that to these mind you were doing it unto me lord once we realized that these are your children these are those that you paid the price for those are those that you redeem maybe a word maybe an action something lord that would cause one to turn and look towards jesus as their help lord like you've done for us till that last one is in until that body is whole and you say come up heather come up higher lord help us to do our part and be willing we pray in jesus christ's name amen if he redeemed me can i redeem others if be willing to love me then he would love others he became me so that i might become him so that
