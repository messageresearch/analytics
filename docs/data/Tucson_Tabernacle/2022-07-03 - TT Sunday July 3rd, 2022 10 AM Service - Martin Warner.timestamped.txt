[40:09] scripture tells us be still
[40:12] and know that i am god
[40:15] and it behooves us just to let go and
[40:17] let god
[40:19] sometimes we get anxious we get word we
[40:22] we try to figure things out and make
[40:24] things happen
[40:25] and god says i have it under control
[40:28] i've already seen the end and it is well
[40:31] and just for us to have confidence in
[40:32] that i appreciate
[40:34] you know
[40:36] the time of the the season here in the
[40:37] united states is independence day
[40:41] freedom from the rule of another
[40:43] government
[40:45] but today you look and wonder where is
[40:47] the independence where is the freedom
[40:51] but as i was thinking of that and i
[40:53] opened up the scriptures to revelations
[40:55] chapter 21 verses 3 to 5 of
[40:58] where the jordan would put that up
[41:01] and it said and i heard a great voice
[41:03] out of heaven saying behold the
[41:04] tabernacle of god is with men
[41:07] and he will dwell with them and they
[41:09] shall be his people
[41:10] and god himself shall be with them and
[41:13] be their god
[41:14] and this is what is and god shall wipe
[41:16] away all tears from their eyes
[41:19] he says and there shall be no more death
[41:22] neither sorrow nor crying
[41:24] neither shall there be any more pain
[41:27] before the former things are passed away
[41:31] and he that sat upon the throne said
[41:33] behold
[41:34] i make all things new
[41:36] and he said unto me right
[41:38] for these words are true and faithful
[41:43] you can hang your eternal destination on
[41:45] that and then revelations 22
[41:48] verse 20
[41:49] he which testifieth these things saved
[41:52] surely i come quickly
[41:54] amen and we answer even so come lord
[41:57] jesus
[41:58] in in what an independence day that'll
[42:00] be
[42:01] what a day that'll be just to think of
[42:03] those things so appreciate that sister
[42:06] priscilla
[42:07] always when i see her when she comes in
[42:09] i'll ask i always ask her do you have a
[42:11] song for us and appreciate that today
[42:14] good to be in the house of the lord
[42:15] today and
[42:17] we do have some needs and things to
[42:18] bring to your attention
[42:21] our sister zumbrunnen is asking prayer
[42:23] for her brother-in-law
[42:25] he's in stage four cancer
[42:28] sister kathleen there was a man that had
[42:30] already been put in a tomb
[42:32] and sealed and they closed it and he
[42:35] said lazarus come forth
[42:37] nothing is impossible for our god if we
[42:39] can't believe it
[42:45] just remember sister martha and
[42:47] caitlin and kenneth they'd been

[44:40] as we're together and we know that it is
[44:42] written
[44:43] that wherever two or three are gathered
[44:45] in our lord's name that he would be with
[44:47] us
[44:48] friends if there would be a request
[44:50] that's on your heart
[44:52] something that's dear to your heart that
[44:54] that you need to answer from the lord
[44:56] friends if you would raise your hand

[45:20] up before you cancer or
[45:22] whatever it may be that even the doctors
[45:25] may not know what the sickness is but
[45:27] lord you know
[45:29] father we lift these requests up before
[45:32] the almighty god that created these
[45:34] bodies that created the heavens and the
[45:35] earth that can heal every disease that
[45:38] promised us that you would heal these
[45:40] diseases father we lift them up before
[45:42] you along with these requests whether it
[45:44] be for family or friends or children
[45:47] lord whatever it might be that these

[45:53] they would come into your ears lord and
[45:55] that you would answer
[45:57] lord we bring these requests before you
[46:00] with the faith to know that you are able
[46:03] and father with the remainder of the
[46:04] service we ask that you would be with us

[46:09] brings the message to us
[46:11] father anoint our ears also that we may
[46:13] hear what the spirit is saying to the
[46:16] church
[46:17] father we love you and we have
[46:19] confidence in you
[46:21] in jesus christ's name amen
[46:29] what a mighty god we serve
[46:32] sometimes we wonder lord i might say
[46:34] lord what's taking you so long but he's
[46:36] got perfect timing in all things
[46:39] it's it's for the character building of
[46:41] ourselves not him he's he's he's
[46:43] everything he needs to be but sometimes
[46:46] we need some work and we just have to
[46:47] say lord help me to surrender help me to
[46:50] yield help me to give it all to you
[46:52] sometimes you you struggle with it
[46:54] because you're hanging on to your end of
[46:55] it
[46:56] and he's saying let go and let god
[46:58] have his wonderful way so
[47:00] we have our brother mark warner down
[47:02] from canada and his wife with us and
[47:04] i'll i'll let him uh
[47:07] it's there a little late celebration of
[47:09] your anniversary he said
[47:12] so
[47:13] i don't know how many people come to
[47:15] tucson to celebrate their anniversary
[47:17] but he chose to do so now we're
[47:19] privileged for that today so usually
[47:21] we're trying to go out of tucson
[47:23] especially this time of the year so
[47:25] let's remember those also the young
[47:27] people in the byc camp i know
[47:29] brother kevin and
[47:31] paul murray took some young folks over
[47:33] there and others
[47:34] and not just and i understand that
[47:36] portion of the young people wanting to
[47:37] be around the young people that's when
[47:39] we were young we did the same thing
[47:42] but you know but they would meet god
[47:45] because that is the blessed assurance
[47:47] that is the portion that holds them
[47:50] you know it just i remember as a young
[47:52] man in the pentecostal church all the
[47:54] young people would go to camp and all
[47:57] but they'd come back and then nothing
[47:58] would change
[48:00] it was from camp to camp but when you
[48:01] meet god
[48:03] that's where the change takes place so
[48:05] let's let's pray that that would be
[48:07] something for for those young folks to
[48:09] meet god and have that assurance in
[48:11] their life that god is with me he keeps
[48:13] me he watches over me amen
[48:16] amen
[48:18] amazing grace
[48:20] i don't know that we could ever sing
[48:22] that song too much because it is the
[48:24] grace of god in our lives
[48:26] how many would say amen to that no it is
[48:28] the grace of god in your life amen
[48:32] amen
[48:34] [Music]

[49:17] surgery
[49:18] i'm glad that she was able to come today
[49:21] doing much better
[49:23] just believing god for for a complete
[49:25] restoration of her healing
[49:28] but you know one of these days
[49:30] all of this will be
[49:32] i don't even think it'll be a memory
[49:33] anymore
[49:34] rather it'll be a rejoicing
[49:37] oh
[49:38] when we've
[49:40] been there
[49:43] [Music]
[49:46] make sure that assurance is in your
[49:48] heart that you will be there

[51:54] summer
[51:55] but you know i find god is in odd things

[54:56] in a believer amen that you know you're

[55:49] or five parts or
[55:50] but i just i said i would like to take
[55:53] the two services because

[57:59] lord whatever needs there are this
[58:01] morning we ask in the name of jesus
[58:03] christ that satan would be defeated lord
[58:06] that his spirit would be bound this
[58:08] morning lord and that we'd have our
[58:10] perfect liberty in christ this morning
[58:12] to worship you in spirit and in truth we
[58:15] ask it all in the name of the lord jesus
[58:17] christ amen maybe you shake hands with
[58:19] one another as you're seated wish one
[58:21] another god's blessing
[58:24] amen
[58:28] i didn't have you stand for the reading
[58:29] it's a little lengthy so
[58:31] i don't know if the brothers have it up
[58:34] on the
[58:35] on the screen or not
[58:37] the scripture esther chapter one
[58:43] esther chapter one
[58:50] amen uh
[58:51] we'll read from there
[58:53] this morning
[58:56] esther chapter one
[58:59] now it came to pass in the days of the
[59:00] hazardous this is a hazardous which
[59:02] reigned from india
[59:04] even unto ethiopia over 107 and 20
[59:07] provinces
[59:09] that's really the known world at that
[59:11] time
[59:12] so he this king was
[59:14] alpha and omega
[59:16] he ruled over the whole world as it was
[59:19] at that time so that's the type we're
[59:21] we're looking at the king this morning
[59:22] the king of kings
[59:24] that in those days when the king of
[59:25] hazard sat on the throne of his kingdom
[59:28] which was in shusha and the palace in
[59:29] the third year reign
[59:31] of his reign he made a feast unto all
[59:33] his princes and servants and power for
[59:35] the power of persia and media
[59:37] media
[59:38] and nobles and princes of the provinces
[59:40] being before him
[59:43] so this is uh to the elders
[59:46] like the old testament
[59:48] saints he made a feast to them when he
[59:51] showed the riches and glory and of his
[59:52] kingdom in honor of of his excellence
[59:55] majesty
[59:56] many days even 104 days 180 days
[1:00:01] and when these days were expired the
[1:00:03] king made a feast
[1:00:04] unto all the people that were in were
[1:00:06] present in shushan
[1:00:08] the palace both unto great and small
[1:00:11] seven days
[1:00:13] in the court of the garden of the king's
[1:00:15] palace
[1:00:16] so this is like the new testament
[1:00:18] he had an old testament feasts he has
[1:00:21] new testament feasts
[1:00:24] and then he goes in to describe the the
[1:00:25] hangings on of the court and everything
[1:00:27] we're going to go to verse 9.
[1:00:29] and also vashti the queen made a feast
[1:00:32] for the women in the royal house which
[1:00:34] belonged to king of hazareth
[1:00:38] vastis
[1:00:39] it was not vasti's house
[1:00:42] it was the king's house
[1:00:45] this is the we are god's house
[1:00:49] this is not the deacon's house
[1:00:51] the trustees house
[1:00:53] amen
[1:00:55] the pastor's house
[1:00:57] this is not my house
[1:00:59] this is god's house
[1:01:01] this is god's people
[1:01:03] but she didn't have that revelation
[1:01:06] so
[1:01:06] it belonged to king hazardous and on the
[1:01:08] seventh day when the heart of the king
[1:01:11] was merry with wine he commanded
[1:01:14] muhuman
[1:01:15] bizarr
[1:01:17] harbona big tha abetha
[1:01:20] zazar carcass and the seven chamberlains
[1:01:23] that served in the presence of the
[1:01:25] hazaris the king to bring
[1:01:27] vasti
[1:01:28] the queen before the king with the royal
[1:01:30] crown
[1:01:31] crown royal to show the people and the
[1:01:34] princes her beauty for she was fair to
[1:01:36] look upon so
[1:01:38] a hazardous the king wanted to put
[1:01:41] vasti on display
[1:01:44] he wanted to display her her beauty
[1:01:46] amen
[1:01:47] her royalty
[1:01:49] her as a queen now just think of us the
[1:01:51] church this morning
[1:01:54] the prophet said the bride will be on
[1:01:55] display
[1:01:57] and that's what the king wants
[1:01:59] but the queen vastly refused to come at
[1:02:02] the king's commandment by his
[1:02:03] chamberlains therefore was the king very
[1:02:05] roth and his anger burned within him
[1:02:09] that's verse 12
[1:02:10] now we'll skip to verse 16.
[1:02:13] and we know the story that he was roth
[1:02:16] and his
[1:02:17] he counseled with his wise men it's
[1:02:20] always good to take counsel
[1:02:22] there's safety and a multitude of
[1:02:24] counselors
[1:02:25] you know
[1:02:26] we need one another we need the gifts we
[1:02:28] need the wisdom in the body
[1:02:31] so we look to the elders for counsel
[1:02:35] so mumukum answered
[1:02:37] before the king in the prince verse 16
[1:02:39] vastly the queen has not done wrong to
[1:02:41] the king only but also to all the
[1:02:43] princes to all the people that are in
[1:02:45] all the provinces of the king hazards
[1:02:47] for this deed of the queen shall come
[1:02:50] abroad unto all women
[1:02:51] so that they shall despise their husband
[1:02:53] in their eyes
[1:02:54] when it shall be reported the king
[1:02:57] the king answered a hazardous commanded
[1:03:00] vashti the queen to be brought in before
[1:03:02] him but she came not
[1:03:05] likewise shall the ladies of persia
[1:03:08] media say and say in this day unto the
[1:03:10] king's princes which have heard of the
[1:03:12] deed of the queen thus shall there rise
[1:03:14] too much contempt and wrath
[1:03:16] if it pleased the king
[1:03:18] let there go a royal commandment from
[1:03:20] him and let it be written among the laws
[1:03:22] of persians and meads that it be not
[1:03:24] altered that vashti come no more before
[1:03:26] the king of hazardous and let the king
[1:03:28] give a royal estate to unto another that
[1:03:30] is better than she
[1:03:31] and when the king's
[1:03:33] decree which he shall make shall be
[1:03:35] published throughout all this empire for
[1:03:37] it is great
[1:03:38] all the wives shall give
[1:03:40] to their husband honor both to great and
[1:03:42] small
[1:03:43] and the saying pleased the king and
[1:03:45] princess and the king did according to
[1:03:47] the word of mamukum
[1:03:50] for he sent letters unto all the
[1:03:51] promises unto every province according
[1:03:53] to the writing thereof to every people
[1:03:56] after their language that every man
[1:03:57] should bear rule in his own house
[1:03:59] and that he should be it should be
[1:04:01] published according to the language of

[1:04:08] we'll pick that up we'll pick up a few
[1:04:10] other scriptures i just wanted to give
[1:04:11] you a background
[1:04:13] to where we're at this morning what
[1:04:14] we'll be touching on this morning
[1:04:17] on this story of esther how many are
[1:04:19] familiar with the book of esther
[1:04:21] how many have read the book of esther
[1:04:23] amen it's a wonderful book and it's
[1:04:26] really a hidden book
[1:04:29] you don't you don't hear too many people
[1:04:31] preach on it that much
[1:04:33] i haven't in in my 40 years i think it
[1:04:36] was
[1:04:37] it was about 40 some years 42 years ago
[1:04:39] 40 years ago i was down here at this
[1:04:42] altar
[1:04:44] and i prayed all night and i fell asleep
[1:04:46] right there
[1:04:47] as a young person
[1:04:50] and somebody put a jacket over me
[1:04:52] and i woke up in the morning
[1:04:54] and we were you know we were brother
[1:04:57] aaron we were on fire
[1:04:59] we we were desperate we were desperate
[1:05:02] for god
[1:05:03] and you know
[1:05:04] there's a lot of things that have passed
[1:05:06] by but never lose that fervency
[1:05:10] young people you have a chance at the
[1:05:12] word you had a you have a chance at the
[1:05:14] revival your own revival
[1:05:17] amen so this morning i'll try to keep on
[1:05:20] my subject but
[1:05:21] like the prophet said sometimes you need
[1:05:22] to go over here because this one's down
[1:05:24] here and you need to pull them out of
[1:05:25] the ditch
[1:05:27] don't lose your revival stay in revival
[1:05:31] stay in a revival you can be in a
[1:05:33] revival if you're
[1:05:34] if you're in a hospital bed
[1:05:37] if you're sick as a dog you can be in a
[1:05:39] revival
[1:05:40] i learned that from a widow woman
[1:05:43] that met that met brother branham
[1:05:46] i learned that from her when anything
[1:05:48] would go wrong
[1:05:49] she'd say praise the lord
[1:05:51] praise the lord sister
[1:05:54] you know who i'm talking about
[1:05:56] amen everything was praise god all
[1:05:59] things work together for good
[1:06:02] amen whatever bad things are happening
[1:06:05] it it's it's a good thing in god's sight
[1:06:07] he'll make it work out so
[1:06:10] so here we see this morning the book of
[1:06:12] esther you know the prophet didn't
[1:06:13] preach much about the book of esther
[1:06:16] he talked about it in marriage of
[1:06:18] divorce
[1:06:20] so the book of esther is a is a
[1:06:22] wonderful book it's a book of a love
[1:06:23] story
[1:06:25] amen mainly a love story
[1:06:28] the king's heart
[1:06:30] he loved esther above all the women all
[1:06:33] the virgins
[1:06:34] he had a precious elected
[1:06:37] wife out of all those and that's that's
[1:06:40] his love toward us this morning
[1:06:42] he loves us he desires us to prosper and
[1:06:45] be in good health more than we want to
[1:06:47] be
[1:06:49] he wants us to give the holy give the
[1:06:51] holy ghost to us more than we want it
[1:06:54] he wants to give a refilling to us more
[1:06:57] than we want it
[1:06:59] it's but it's how bad do we want it
[1:07:02] amen this morning so
[1:07:05] a love story first and principally a
[1:07:07] love story about a king and a queen
[1:07:11] about royalty you know people get so
[1:07:14] caught up with england
[1:07:16] and and the platinum what is it the
[1:07:18] platinum anniversary
[1:07:21] yeah and it's wonderful you know
[1:07:22] knickknacks and stories about that and
[1:07:24] all that but you know that's not the
[1:07:26] real royalty
[1:07:28] hallelujah
[1:07:30] there's kings and queens
[1:07:32] sitting here this morning
[1:07:34] amen kings of of the of the earth of
[1:07:38] heaven and earth we're kings and priests
[1:07:40] the bible said
[1:07:41] so we have to rule over something
[1:07:44] god's given us something to rule over
[1:07:46] and this morning we need to rule over
[1:07:49] our own spirits
[1:07:50] we need to get in line

[1:08:09] church for the blessings
[1:08:11] you know and just to shout or sing or
[1:08:12] that's wonderful we should do that
[1:08:15] but this is the house of correction
[1:08:18] this is the house where god will speak
[1:08:20] to us
[1:08:22] sovereignly the king will come down and
[1:08:24] use a vessel
[1:08:26] one that he's chosen
[1:08:28] maybe an oddball like me
[1:08:30] out of the frozen north
[1:08:33] to come to the hot desert

[1:10:08] and the light came through the messenger
[1:10:11] no one could see this
[1:10:13] do you know that esther really in the
[1:10:15] jewish or the hebrew meaning of esther
[1:10:18] there's a connotation of
[1:10:20] hidden
[1:10:21] means hidden
[1:10:23] to be hidden
[1:10:25] to be a secret
[1:10:27] there was a mystery
[1:10:29] around esther
[1:10:31] and amen and there's a mystery

[1:11:10] as the bride as the queen
[1:11:13] of heaven
[1:11:14] we wouldn't we wouldn't be so defeated
[1:11:17] if we were

[1:11:42] i didn't come this far just to play
[1:11:44] church
[1:11:46] i'm not playing church anymore the
[1:11:47] prophet said we've gone to church long
[1:11:50] enough
[1:11:52] we've been here for 40 50 years some of
[1:11:54] us
[1:11:55] and and it's time we recognize like
[1:11:58] esther who we are
[1:12:01] amen
[1:12:02] not not something to make us proud
[1:12:05] not not to get swelled heads that we're
[1:12:07] in the message and we have all the
[1:12:09] knowledge
[1:12:10] no but to have the spirit and character
[1:12:13] of jesus christ
[1:12:15] amen flowing out from us
[1:12:18] amen to to everyone we meet
[1:12:22] amen
[1:12:24] praise god always with a burden
[1:12:26] amen so a book about so many things
[1:12:30] salvation
[1:12:32] redemption
[1:12:34] the book of redemption
[1:12:36] and
[1:12:37] as i thought about it you know esther
[1:12:40] she
[1:12:41] she needed to be cleansed
[1:12:44] you know she needed a cleansing esther i
[1:12:46] might shock it esther was a sinner
[1:12:50] esther was a sinner born in sin shaped
[1:12:53] in iniquity coming to the world speaking
[1:12:56] lies
[1:12:57] esther was
[1:12:59] esther was brought up in the message
[1:13:02] my she had a tutor
[1:13:05] amen mordecai just so you get the
[1:13:07] background a little bit mordecai was a
[1:13:09] type of the holy ghost
[1:13:12] esther's tutor
[1:13:14] king of hazard was christ the king amen
[1:13:18] the seven chambers were the seven church
[1:13:20] age messengers
[1:13:22] and they were one the ones that were
[1:13:23] telling vast he come in come in come in
[1:13:26] it's supper time
[1:13:28] and vastly the pentecostal church
[1:13:30] refused to be further pregnant with the
[1:13:33] word of god for this hour
[1:13:35] right is that right
[1:13:36] amen she refused and to refuse
[1:13:39] the holy ghost to reject the seal of the
[1:13:42] holy ghost is to receive the mark of the
[1:13:44] beast
[1:13:46] what a sad ending for vasti
[1:13:49] she was put away in divorcement
[1:13:52] amen but that's now
[1:13:54] think about it where are we at this
[1:13:56] morning where we had as individuals
[1:13:58] where are we at as a church
[1:14:01] think about it
[1:14:03] amen let the holy spirit
[1:14:05] magnify it
[1:14:07] let him put the the magnifying glass on
[1:14:09] it the prophet said we'll miss it if we
[1:14:11] don't have the token
[1:14:14] to magnify it
[1:14:16] amen that you have to have the token to
[1:14:18] see these things or they're just
[1:14:21] preaching the message amen just like i
[1:14:24] was in the catholic church for 19 years
[1:14:27] before i was saved
[1:14:28] i knew the mass
[1:14:30] i knew the the the emblems i knew the
[1:14:33] whole thing i could
[1:14:34] say it i could say it before the priest
[1:14:36] said it
[1:14:38] and that's the way some people brought
[1:14:40] up in the mess they've heard it and
[1:14:41] heard it and heard it
[1:14:42] but you need that something
[1:14:45] you need a personal contact this morning
[1:14:48] amen i'm getting ahead of myself but
[1:14:50] we'll get into that tonight but
[1:14:52] let's let's let the lord have his way
[1:14:55] amen so it's a complete book of
[1:14:57] redemption amen and esther needed a plea
[1:15:00] placing esther was a sinner saved by
[1:15:03] grace
[1:15:04] amen she had to go through a
[1:15:06] purification process
[1:15:08] she had to be called first she had to be
[1:15:10] justified
[1:15:12] then she had to be sanctified for six
[1:15:14] months with the oil of myrrh and then
[1:15:16] three months
[1:15:18] again with another oil and all the
[1:15:20] things that pertained to the virgins
[1:15:23] amen for what her cleansing
[1:15:26] amen some people sit in the message for
[1:15:28] years with
[1:15:29] with under justification
[1:15:32] or say or even sanctification
[1:15:35] but never get
[1:15:36] filled amen never get filled it's time
[1:15:41] amen you've got to have the wedding
[1:15:43] garment on
[1:15:45] before you go in that place and esther
[1:15:47] had to get cleaned up first
[1:15:49] hallelujah
[1:15:50] esther had to get cleaned up let the
[1:15:52] holy spirit clean us up
[1:15:54] amen that's why we come to church
[1:15:57] amen not just to
[1:15:59] see how good we are
[1:16:01] amen or or you know try to duck the
[1:16:03] preachers
[1:16:04] you know preaching sometimes and hide
[1:16:07] behind somebody else
[1:16:09] amen let's get real
[1:16:11] let's get real let's have the real thing
[1:16:13] or nothing
[1:16:15] god said i'd rather you be cold
[1:16:17] backslidden
[1:16:18] or or hot but not lukewarm
[1:16:21] amen god hates lukewarmness
[1:16:25] he hates it in us saints and i hate it
[1:16:27] when i see it in myself
[1:16:30] if i get lukewarm and slack and lazy
[1:16:32] spiritually and not no burden for souls
[1:16:35] no burden for anyone else just living my
[1:16:37] own life making my own living
[1:16:40] where are we going
[1:16:41] what are we living for what are we
[1:16:44] working for
[1:16:46] the prophet what are you living for what
[1:16:47] are you working for to live what are you
[1:16:48] living for to die
[1:16:50] and you're not fit to live until you're
[1:16:52] fit to die
[1:16:53] and that was the spirit that esther had
[1:16:55] to come to finally she had to be
[1:16:57] willing to die
[1:17:00] she had to be willing to come to that
[1:17:01] place
[1:17:02] to empty out
[1:17:04] amen after she had been sanctified
[1:17:08] after
[1:17:09] it's not just paul said i die daily
[1:17:13] we need to die daily saints not just one
[1:17:16] time oh i had an experience
[1:17:19] here at this altar 40 years ago
[1:17:23] some of you weren't even born 40 years
[1:17:24] ago
[1:17:26] amen
[1:17:27] you know you think of it how many were
[1:17:29] here when paul kane spoke
[1:17:31] in 1981
[1:17:33] one two
[1:17:35] five
[1:17:37] you hear brother
[1:17:39] five hands
[1:17:40] paul kane spoke here i was i was at this
[1:17:42] altar we were praying for a crippled man
[1:17:46] to get healed
[1:17:50] but it doesn't matter how long we've
[1:17:51] been in the message
[1:17:53] how long has the message been in you
[1:17:57] amen how long how long you've been in
[1:17:58] the message
[1:17:59] but how long has it been
[1:18:02] since the message
[1:18:04] christ is the message
[1:18:06] been in you
[1:18:08] amen and if you need something this
[1:18:10] morning if you need a revival there's a
[1:18:12] revival
[1:18:13] here
[1:18:14] it's here
[1:18:16] it's right here in this church
[1:18:18] amen all it takes is one
[1:18:20] to start a revolt what was the welsh
[1:18:22] revival
[1:18:23] one man
[1:18:25] oh my i'm getting off my subject
[1:18:27] see
[1:18:28] praise the lord we'll never get through
[1:18:30] so let's let's but i feel the pull
[1:18:34] you you operate the gift
[1:18:37] you know we can stick to our notes but
[1:18:39] you know maybe you pull on that gift you
[1:18:41] say
[1:18:42] lord have that man speak to me
[1:18:46] amen i think i told that story here
[1:18:48] i was sitting
[1:18:49] just a couple years after that
[1:18:51] in the church
[1:18:53] and the lord been dealing with me about
[1:18:54] the ministry
[1:18:56] and i said well
[1:18:57] if you're the same god that's on those
[1:18:59] tapes
[1:19:00] and the woman said have that man speak
[1:19:02] to me and brother braham said you just
[1:19:03] said have that man speak to me
[1:19:05] so i said have that man speak to me tell
[1:19:08] tell me that i'm a preacher
[1:19:10] say martin brother martin is a minister
[1:19:14] i said well if this this is real
[1:19:17] if this is really real those tapes and
[1:19:19] only god could do that
[1:19:21] he said then have him speak to me and
[1:19:23] brother biscuit was standing there and
[1:19:24] he said by the way brother martin is a
[1:19:26] minister
[1:19:29] is anything too hard for god
[1:19:32] but we make it hard
[1:19:34] we
[1:19:35] we should challenge
[1:19:37] we should challenge it
[1:19:39] we should take the challenge of the word
[1:19:41] the word challenges us to believe only
[1:19:44] believe all things are possible
[1:19:47] this morning only belief
[1:19:50] amen so esther now you know it's placed
[1:19:53] the book is placed perfectly between you
[1:19:55] know after ezra and nehemiah because it
[1:19:58] was the restoration period and then the
[1:20:00] bride was restored
[1:20:03] amen the bride tree was restored and
[1:20:05] esther came on the scene
[1:20:07] amen so uh and so esther
[1:20:11] she she was adopted by mordecai
[1:20:14] and so she had the spirit of adoption
[1:20:19] esther had the spirit of adoption and
[1:20:20] the spirit of adoption is in the bride
[1:20:23] that's why she says abba
[1:20:25] father
[1:20:27] amen that's what draws
[1:20:30] abba father father
[1:20:33] that's what draws us amen that's what's
[1:20:36] that's what's in the bride the spirit of
[1:20:37] adoption
[1:20:38] so this i took this subject because it
[1:20:40] really presses me down and it challenges
[1:20:42] me and it reminds me
[1:20:44] as an individual and as a church
[1:20:47] that we hear what the
[1:20:49] voice behind the voice is saying amen
[1:20:52] the voice behind this voice
[1:20:54] the voice behind revelations 10 7.
[1:20:57] that was not brother branham's voice
[1:21:01] that was not a man's voice
[1:21:03] now i know you can go too far with that
[1:21:06] but it was god's voice
[1:21:08] it was the voice of god
[1:21:10] it was it was the voice of god to a
[1:21:12] generation to a bride
[1:21:15] and you've got to hear that voice not
[1:21:17] just the man's voice
[1:21:19] but the voice the voice of the man
[1:21:21] within the man
[1:21:23] amen so just so we get there and we give
[1:21:25] you the background a little bit and we

[1:23:41] how many times
[1:23:44] was this my last service
[1:23:46] i think the last time i was here i said
[1:23:48] that in phoenix after i left i said this
[1:23:50] brother aaron
[1:23:52] this has got to be my last service i
[1:23:54] mean
[1:23:54] i'm in my 60s i can retire i've i've
[1:23:57] been through the mission fields i've
[1:23:58] i've done my part i've you know i
[1:24:00] figured i'm making a deal with god right
[1:24:03] just let me retire and drift and you
[1:24:05] know and then here he comes again
[1:24:08] here it comes again
[1:24:09] amen you can't retire
[1:24:12] you can't stop i'm sorry you can't god
[1:24:15] needs his soldiers he needs to place he
[1:24:18] needs every one of us
[1:24:20] what if there was no one here this
[1:24:21] morning to hear the word preach brother
[1:24:23] what good would be to be called to
[1:24:25] preach
[1:24:27] what good would be if no one came amen
[1:24:30] so we need one another
[1:24:32] we need every part
[1:24:34] and and this covet isolation thing that
[1:24:37] proves it more
[1:24:39] is satan trying to isolate us
[1:24:42] discourage us
[1:24:44] amen no communication
[1:24:47] oh we can't invite them over for
[1:24:49] fellowship because you know what
[1:24:52] like i told you last time i was here i
[1:24:54] had the rcmp after i come back from
[1:24:56] africa the rcmp at my door
[1:24:59] is that right
[1:25:00] mr margie
[1:25:01] checking on me
[1:25:04] because i refused
[1:25:05] to go
[1:25:06] and stay in a motel with a bunch of
[1:25:08] people with coal bed
[1:25:11] i said i got my rights
[1:25:13] i got a right to go home and be with my
[1:25:15] wife after being on the mission field
[1:25:18] i said i got a right to sleep in my own
[1:25:20] bed
[1:25:21] oh now here i go
[1:25:23] brother aaron
[1:25:26] oh my
[1:25:29] so the reason
[1:25:30] you know it's important to see that
[1:25:33] because
[1:25:34] esther
[1:25:35] had a name change
[1:25:38] she
[1:25:39] god spoke her name before the foundation
[1:25:41] of the world
[1:25:42] god spoke your name before the
[1:25:44] foundation of the world
[1:25:47] because the it was you know revelation
[1:25:49] 13 all all will worship him whose names
[1:25:51] were not written in the land's book of
[1:25:53] life before the foundation of the world
[1:25:56] why doesn't denomination see that
[1:25:59] why don't they see election
[1:26:02] amen
[1:26:03] election looks back to foreknowledge
[1:26:05] predestination looks to destiny
[1:26:08] amen we came from somewhere we're going
[1:26:10] somewhere hallelujah we're we're not
[1:26:13] just sitting around waiting
[1:26:16] no we're we're in motion
[1:26:18] we're men and women and sons and
[1:26:20] daughters of god in motion
[1:26:23] hallelujah like joshua he was a man of
[1:26:25] motion
[1:26:27] amen
[1:26:28] he wasn't a man with a stick
[1:26:30] he was a man with a sword
[1:26:33] we got a sword
[1:26:34] we got a powerful sword this word is
[1:26:37] powerful
[1:26:38] it's a powerful word you got in your
[1:26:40] hands you young people you you you
[1:26:43] schooled aged children
[1:26:46] you know you you that were raised in the
[1:26:48] mess you got a powerful weapon you just
[1:26:50] pray and ask the lord how to speak
[1:26:54] how to talk
[1:26:55] and how to not talk
[1:26:58] amen how to not say nothing sometimes
[1:27:00] just be
[1:27:02] an
[1:27:02] esther on display
[1:27:05] i can't walk like a woman so
[1:27:08] i'm kind of manly
[1:27:11] but
[1:27:12] you know she was on display esther was
[1:27:14] on display
[1:27:16] and that's sometimes all the world is
[1:27:18] looking for
[1:27:20] an example some a real chris there's
[1:27:22] there's something i met a man yesterday
[1:27:24] in the costco there was something about
[1:27:26] him
[1:27:28] and he did a favor from me a
[1:27:30] kindness and another man oh my
[1:27:34] they're just there's all kinds of
[1:27:36] opportunity salvation and redemption are
[1:27:38] two different things
[1:27:42] you can lead somebody in christ they
[1:27:44] could have salvation
[1:27:46] eternal life on the other side maybe
[1:27:48] inhabit outside the city
[1:27:51] just so easy
[1:27:53] they don't have to darken this door
[1:27:57] you can lean them to christ
[1:27:59] but redemption is to bring back
[1:28:02] that
[1:28:03] was was yours brother aaron you you were
[1:28:06] you were there
[1:28:07] hallelujah we knew one another
[1:28:10] hallelujah we knew and then just by
[1:28:12] earthly chance we came in contact
[1:28:15] amen god has a reason god has a purpose
[1:28:19] when i was laying there at the altar
[1:28:22] 40 years ago
[1:28:23] i didn't think i'd be standing here
[1:28:26] but in god's mind
[1:28:28] before the foundation of the world
[1:28:30] he orchestrated
[1:28:33] it twists and turns and ups and downs
[1:28:38] you don't even want to show your face in
[1:28:40] church
[1:28:43] you ever been there
[1:28:44] yeah we've all been there
[1:28:47] if we're real about it
[1:28:50] we've all failed
[1:28:52] many times
[1:28:54] amen it's not the failing it's the
[1:28:56] getting up
[1:28:57] it's it's it's the faith that he's a
[1:29:00] redeemer that he's a savior
[1:29:03] that that what he did on calvary that
[1:29:06] becoming an advocate
[1:29:08] was for me so i could get up again
[1:29:12] hallelujah
[1:29:13] oh i have i feel religious this morning
[1:29:16] you know you hear brother branham say
[1:29:17] that on the tape oh my i'm going to work

[1:29:38] i'm so glad to say that i'm one i'm so
[1:29:40] glad to see that that thrills me
[1:29:43] when i hear the prophet
[1:29:44] say those things and then speak to me

[1:30:15] important
[1:30:17] your children's names are important
[1:30:22] what you name your children
[1:30:24] amen because it brings on a character
[1:30:27] and you keep calling them that you keep
[1:30:29] calling them that
[1:30:30] you see like the prophet said in the old
[1:30:32] testament the
[1:30:35] the patriarchs the mothers when they
[1:30:37] were in childbirth they would groan out
[1:30:39] their names
[1:30:41] issachar
[1:30:43] dan
[1:30:45] amen
[1:30:46] benjamin
[1:30:49] not knowing the prophet not knowing what
[1:30:52] they were saying

[1:30:56] putting them positionally in their place
[1:30:59] amen like he did us
[1:31:02] rather this morning
[1:31:04] positionally in your places
[1:31:06] every one of us
[1:31:09] you have you know other people can get
[1:31:10] up and leave or go here go there but you
[1:31:12] have to stay

[1:31:22] years when i came in the message as a
[1:31:23] single
[1:31:24] boy she she told me that one time

[1:31:30] many many supernatural things she saw
[1:31:32] elijah come up to her door different
[1:31:34] things happened

[1:31:50] trained up
[1:31:51] i was trained up
[1:31:53] god sent me to a widow's house
[1:31:55] funny strange odd young man living with
[1:31:58] a widow
[1:32:00] in her 60s
[1:32:01] but she taught me a lot of lessons
[1:32:04] amen
[1:32:06] and we can we can talk the talk but when
[1:32:08] it comes to the pressure
[1:32:10] that's when we really
[1:32:11] shows who we are
[1:32:14] that's when we we really know if we got
[1:32:16] the goods
[1:32:17] and saints we need to have them
[1:32:20] if god crushes us if he
[1:32:22] whatever he does if he never never heals
[1:32:24] me again
[1:32:26] amen he's still god if i pray for 500
[1:32:31] at this altar
[1:32:33] like i did in africa i prayed for 800 at
[1:32:35] an altar
[1:32:36] individually
[1:32:38] in a hot country
[1:32:41] because my heart went out to them
[1:32:43] amen
[1:32:44] if you're sincere
[1:32:46] and you come to this altar for prayer
[1:32:48] and you know god's going to give it to
[1:32:49] you god will give it to you
[1:32:52] amen
[1:32:53] but you see it's we're
[1:32:56] we're changing
[1:32:58] dispensations
[1:32:59] the prophet said in the rapture message
[1:33:01] we are changing dispensations we have
[1:33:04] not passed this way before in the
[1:33:05] message
[1:33:06] these are different times
[1:33:09] these are these are very different times
[1:33:11] for us a different challenge
[1:33:14] and oppressing
[1:33:16] the darkness is pressing
[1:33:19] we've never met this challenge before so
[1:33:22] it's going to bring something out of us
[1:33:25] amen just stay just stay with it
[1:33:28] stay with christ and that's what i did
[1:33:30] with the widow woman
[1:33:31] that's what i learned with her
[1:33:33] just
[1:33:34] all things work together for good.
[1:33:37] amen and praise god for it so the name
[1:33:40] her name meant something her children's
[1:33:42] names meant something when she named
[1:33:43] them
[1:33:44] see it means something
[1:33:46] and uh
[1:33:48] we
[1:33:49] we like esther esther had to be ester
[1:33:52] she could not be hadassah

[1:34:02] hadassah
[1:34:03] it means myrtle tree

[1:34:08] it's from the tree
[1:34:10] the myrtle tree
[1:34:12] and it's it's it's wood
[1:34:14] so it's an it's wood represents humanity
[1:34:19] amen
[1:34:20] we know that
[1:34:22] amen that's why moses had a stick
[1:34:25] but joshua had a sword
[1:34:28] amen the wood there had to be a change
[1:34:32] from a stick to a sword there had to be
[1:34:33] change from a hadassah to an esther
[1:34:37] there needs to be a change in me
[1:34:40] there needs to be a change in us
[1:34:42] every day i'm not talking about last

[1:35:21] gotta get it pinned so don't don't shake
[1:35:22] my hand too hard after church
[1:35:26] amen
[1:35:27] so
[1:35:28] praise god
[1:35:30] you know she could not stay hadassah she
[1:35:32] had to become esther she had to have a
[1:35:34] name change she had to be adopted
[1:35:38] she had to be adopted her parents had to
[1:35:40] die young
[1:35:41] amen her lineage
[1:35:43] you know all her lineage will get into
[1:35:45] that a little bit here we'll have a
[1:35:46] little time to get into that her lineage
[1:35:48] was predestinated for ordained foreknown
[1:35:51] by god
[1:35:52] from the foundation of the world her
[1:35:54] grandfather her grandmother all those
[1:35:56] things it's same as us
[1:35:58] and sometimes we wonder why am i this
[1:36:00] way i'd like to be like brother aaron
[1:36:03] you know calm and you know
[1:36:05] just you look at brothers and you think
[1:36:07] oh man i'd like to be like that
[1:36:09] but he made us each
[1:36:11] different a flower in his garden
[1:36:14] amen for a purpose
[1:36:17] amen to to reflect
[1:36:19] his nature his character
[1:36:22] amen and all those things see there's a
[1:36:24] meaning behind the name and that's what
[1:36:26] uh esther meant esther means in the
[1:36:28] hebrew star
[1:36:30] esther means in the persian star
[1:36:33] but the hebrew un underneath see in the
[1:36:35] hebrew this is an eastern book saints
[1:36:39] this is an eastern book and i never
[1:36:41] understood why brother bran would say
[1:36:42] that
[1:36:43] like we didn't have the understanding
[1:36:45] and we're english
[1:36:48] like we have the king james bible
[1:36:51] you know we we we
[1:36:53] we
[1:36:53] the prophet came out of america
[1:36:56] and he said it's an eastern book
[1:36:58] and there's hidden things
[1:37:00] and i never understood that so i'll
[1:37:02] start to look at some of the
[1:37:04] customs some of the culture
[1:37:07] some of the ways
[1:37:09] of the hebrews
[1:37:11] amen they're they're interwoven
[1:37:14] and we have some of those same ways
[1:37:17] and when we have some of those same
[1:37:19] cultures there's the same thing in the
[1:37:20] bride because we're we're of the same
[1:37:23] lineage
[1:37:24] we are
[1:37:26] we are the true hebrews
[1:37:28] we are the sons of abraham
[1:37:31] amen
[1:37:32] we we were there with him before the
[1:37:35] foundation of the world the same as they
[1:37:37] were there
[1:37:38] before the foundation of the world their
[1:37:40] names were written our names were
[1:37:41] written

[1:38:41] draconia king of judah whom nezukanezer
[1:38:45] the king of babylon had carried away so
[1:38:47] this this uh
[1:38:51] this lineage i looked into it the
[1:38:52] lineage
[1:38:55] there was a rabbi
[1:38:57] so i looked it up and i found yeah
[1:38:58] that's true
[1:39:00] shimmy i was
[1:39:02] esther's
[1:39:03] and mordecai's grandfather
[1:39:07] and
[1:39:08] their fathers
[1:39:11] what was shimiya's sons
[1:39:13] right
[1:39:15] so i looked it up and uh and
[1:39:17] the tigrum which is is a hebrew
[1:39:20] commentary on the scripture culture
[1:39:22] weighs different things and
[1:39:24] interpretations it's an oral teaching
[1:39:27] on the scripture
[1:39:28] that started in about the time of ezra
[1:39:32] and
[1:39:33] so he says in there he says that
[1:39:35] mordecai was the descendant from shemiya
[1:39:38] benguria as as was esther so mordecai
[1:39:42] and esther were descendants of shimei
[1:39:45] and
[1:39:46] the day and that david's attitude to
[1:39:48] towards shimaya was initially due to his
[1:39:51] prophetic knowledge of the two saviors
[1:39:54] of israel that were to come from him
[1:39:59] so esther and mordecai came from shimaya
[1:40:01] and you know shimayi was the one that
[1:40:03] cursed david
[1:40:05] remember
[1:40:07] he cursed david said you bloody man
[1:40:11] you he cursed him the bible said with an
[1:40:13] evil wicked curse
[1:40:16] you bloody man all these things are
[1:40:18] coming on your head now david was
[1:40:20] walking up the hill
[1:40:22] a rejected king
[1:40:24] running from absalom
[1:40:26] his son
[1:40:28] right
[1:40:29] and walking up that hill and here's
[1:40:31] shimiya coming along the prophet said
[1:40:36] pointing his finger at david
[1:40:39] the prophet said he was a spiritual
[1:40:43] he was accusing his brother
[1:40:45] he was of the tribe of israel
[1:40:47] they were all
[1:40:48] israelites he was a benjamin
[1:40:52] he was a tribe of benjamin
[1:40:54] you know and i find that
[1:40:56] that evil spirit amen a brother will
[1:40:59] accuse the brother
[1:41:01] amen we see it right here
[1:41:04] amen and he had no right to do that he
[1:41:06] paid for that
[1:41:09] he died an awful death
[1:41:11] he paid it for that but he was still an
[1:41:13] israelite
[1:41:15] see
[1:41:16] enemies enemies within enemies without
[1:41:21] and now you know what i preach on in the
[1:41:23] mission field
[1:41:25] these are some of the things we get into
[1:41:29] shimmy and i
[1:41:30] still elect just like
[1:41:33] saul
[1:41:35] he took that javelin man
[1:41:38] david he wasn't he wasn't aiming for the
[1:41:39] wall he was aiming for david
[1:41:42] and he just let her fly
[1:41:44] sometimes you'll see those arrows just
[1:41:47] whoa
[1:41:48] where are they coming from the house of
[1:41:50] my friends
[1:41:52] oh we're getting real this morning
[1:41:54] we're getting real we know how we we
[1:41:56] have to know satan's tactics
[1:41:58] but what was what was david's attitude
[1:42:01] towards saul
[1:42:02] i wouldn't touch the hem of his garment
[1:42:05] it smote him
[1:42:07] to touch the hem of saul's garment
[1:42:10] but an evil spirit was on saul he became
[1:42:13] an enemy
[1:42:14] of the lord
[1:42:16] see and sometimes we'll get into it
[1:42:18] but sometimes saints
[1:42:20] we need an enemy
[1:42:24] esther needed an enemy
[1:42:28] he said she needed an enemy yeah
[1:42:31] to bring out esther
[1:42:33] not hadassah
[1:42:36] not this
[1:42:37] but at the esther inside
[1:42:40] you need an enemy
[1:42:41] i need an enemy it brings out the best
[1:42:44] in us sister marjorie
[1:42:46] it brings out the best in us
[1:42:49] it shows the real us
[1:42:51] when we're under pressure
[1:42:53] from within from without accusations
[1:42:58] as young people not being true at all
[1:43:02] some deacon accusing you some pastor
[1:43:04] some preacher accusing you of something
[1:43:06] you didn't do
[1:43:08] you lived through that and stay in the
[1:43:10] message
[1:43:12] and not say what do i need that for
[1:43:14] right you need it
[1:43:16] to bring out christ in you
[1:43:18] to bring out your adoption to bring out
[1:43:20] your election brother joel amen
[1:43:23] hallelujah we needed saints it's not
[1:43:25] easy
[1:43:26] it's not easy to go through it he didn't
[1:43:28] he didn't say it would be easy he never
[1:43:30] said
[1:43:32] the mountain would be hard to climb
[1:43:34] but he promised he'd be there on time
[1:43:37] amen he promised he'd be with us as
[1:43:39] young people you got a challenge ahead
[1:43:41] of you
[1:43:42] you that were brought up in the message
[1:43:44] you had a real challenge but identify
[1:43:46] with esther this morning
[1:43:47] she had challenges but she needed an
[1:43:49] enemy
[1:43:51] amen
[1:43:53] more of shimmy i was that enemy
[1:43:56] but it didn't matter
[1:43:58] to esther
[1:44:00] what she heard the testimonies
[1:44:03] she heard about that cursing about her
[1:44:06] grandfather cursing david
[1:44:08] she had heard about those things those
[1:44:10] bad things that happened in the message
[1:44:12] but it never bothered her
[1:44:15] amen
[1:44:16] she just kept walking
[1:44:18] she just kept stay she stayed humble
[1:44:20] under the tudor
[1:44:22] mordecai she stayed faithful to church
[1:44:25] she kept going to church anyway
[1:44:28] even if everyone left she she was going
[1:44:29] to go to church if she was going to be
[1:44:31] the only one there she'd be there
[1:44:33] hallelujah that's what god's looking for
[1:44:37] sister angelo that's what he's looking
[1:44:38] for that character
[1:44:40] amen if my mother doesn't go
[1:44:43] don't bother me
[1:44:45] my father doesn't go don't bother me if
[1:44:48] my son my daughter doesn't go don't
[1:44:50] bother me
[1:44:52] actually that's what they're looking for
[1:44:55] they're not looking for you to
[1:44:56] compromise with them
[1:44:58] they're looking for you to stay stand
[1:45:01] take your stand
[1:45:03] i'm standing for this oh yeah we heard
[1:45:05] dad on the internet about all this false
[1:45:07] this and that and yeah i'm taking my
[1:45:09] stand i'll die on this i'll stand and
[1:45:11] i'll die on this
[1:45:13] i believe this i don't care how many
[1:45:14] internets there are
[1:45:16] amen the internet is not our friend
[1:45:19] amen the internet will shut us down one
[1:45:21] day
[1:45:26] amen
[1:45:27] so
[1:45:29] she needed
[1:45:31] that name change because her lineage
[1:45:33] see her lineage
[1:45:35] she had to have something different
[1:45:38] than her grandfather
[1:45:40] her grandfather was in the message but
[1:45:41] she needed something different
[1:45:44] amen
[1:45:45] she needed a
[1:45:47] she needed the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:45:50] which shimmy i never had
[1:45:53] or he would have never cursed david
[1:45:56] you say well they didn't have the
[1:45:57] baptism the holy ghost they had the
[1:45:58] spirit of god
[1:46:00] amen and that was not the spirit of god
[1:46:03] amen so so mordecai was esther's cousin
[1:46:07] her father's nephew
[1:46:09] their fathers were brothers mordecai and
[1:46:11] esther's
[1:46:12] shimmy i being mordecai and esther's
[1:46:14] grandfather and a brother to saul
[1:46:17] no wonder he cursed
[1:46:20] that's my brother yuki
[1:46:22] you know tribe of benjamin cursed david
[1:46:24] on the run from his own son rejected
[1:46:26] king david had to experience that now
[1:46:29] i'm talking about election here david
[1:46:31] had to experience rejection
[1:46:34] we all have to experience rejection
[1:46:37] we all have to experience rejection can
[1:46:39] i hear an amen
[1:46:41] amen we all have to go through that
[1:46:43] friends family church members preachers
[1:46:46] misunderstandings
[1:46:48] we all go through it
[1:46:50] amen it's needed this too is needed
[1:46:53] amen so uh david needed to enrich his
[1:46:57] experience with that
[1:46:59] so you know
[1:47:00] uh but god made david's and and esther's
[1:47:03] too he made his mistakes work for good
[1:47:06] he became a rejected king by his own
[1:47:08] doing
[1:47:10] david's own doing
[1:47:12] his own mistakes in the flesh with
[1:47:14] bathsheba
[1:47:16] yeah that's why it came to visit him
[1:47:18] right in his own home
[1:47:21] we pay for it
[1:47:22] one way or another
[1:47:24] and you know what the prophet said about
[1:47:25] that he said david was exposed
[1:47:29] because he was elect
[1:47:31] he said the others hide
[1:47:34] the others would run
[1:47:36] but
[1:47:37] god put david's sin away samuel said god
[1:47:40] put your sin away he forgets it
[1:47:44] he forgot it
[1:47:46] amen if we could just do that
[1:47:49] as message people
[1:47:50] you know we're ra ready we're willing to
[1:47:53] give service and say oh well yeah i
[1:47:55] forgive you

[1:48:17] mistakes people
[1:48:19] and we oh there that's it
[1:48:22] yeah we forgive them but
[1:48:24] what about restoring
[1:48:26] about restoring them
[1:48:27] god forgot
[1:48:29] you know there's a saying that says
[1:48:32] you know to to
[1:48:34] air as human to
[1:48:35] forgive is divine
[1:48:38] but i i say to air as human to forgive
[1:48:40] his divine
[1:48:41] but
[1:48:42] to forget

[1:48:47] churches can forgive
[1:48:49] the church if you want to just stay i
[1:48:51] don't want to just be a church that's
[1:48:52] forgiven
[1:48:55] i want to be a church i want to be a
[1:48:56] bride that's justified
[1:48:59] that god doesn't even see it it's not in
[1:49:02] his mind it will never come into his
[1:49:04] remembrance
[1:49:06] amen when you think of when saul and
[1:49:08] david are sitting there they're not
[1:49:09] going to be talking about yeah do you
[1:49:11] remember the time by the grace of god

[1:52:58] pew and he's clapping his hands like he
[1:53:00] was always there
[1:53:02] amazing testimonies
[1:53:05] and and have a dysfunctional family like
[1:53:08] that
[1:53:09] now his testimony

[1:53:13] his dad is coming along
[1:53:15] hallelujah
[1:53:16] you take the long road home
[1:53:19] but he took the long road around because

[1:53:23] so many awful things
[1:53:25] can happen
[1:53:26] bad things happen to good people
[1:53:28] sometimes
[1:53:30] amen but he's coming home
[1:53:32] amen that young man is going to say
[1:53:34] going to be the cause
[1:53:36] god's going to use him for his parents
[1:53:39] i don't care what they're in i don't
[1:53:41] care how messed up
[1:53:43] how perverted how god if there's a seed
[1:53:46] inside there was a seed in rahab
[1:53:49] there was a seed and root there was a
[1:53:51] seed in esther
[1:53:53] amen and it draw it brought them to the
[1:53:55] king
[1:53:57] it brought them to election so i want to
[1:53:59] i want to just kind of
[1:54:01] yeah we got a few more minutes we just
[1:54:02] kind of wind this up on election
[1:54:04] i never got to head ship yet
[1:54:08] oh my that's a that's a hard one
[1:54:10] headship
[1:54:11] election is a little easier to speak on
[1:54:13] but headship my
[1:54:16] so anyway christ
[1:54:18] was an esther
[1:54:20] see and and that lineage she had
[1:54:23] amen even the bad things didn't stop her
[1:54:26] god was protecting the seedline
[1:54:30] amen because david could have cut off
[1:54:32] his head
[1:54:34] but he said now
[1:54:36] prophetically he knew that
[1:54:39] saviors
[1:54:41] that be that shimayai was an israelite
[1:54:45] and that was the seed of god
[1:54:47] and the seed would come through shimei
[1:54:50] producing mordecai and esther two
[1:54:52] redeemers
[1:54:53] that's why the book of esther does not
[1:54:55] talk about
[1:54:57] christ
[1:54:59] it doesn't talk about the future coming
[1:55:00] of christ because esther was christ
[1:55:04] mordecai was a type of the holy ghost
[1:55:06] which is christ
[1:55:07] it was all christ
[1:55:09] it was all god redeeming she had to
[1:55:11] stand in in the gap to redeem her people
[1:55:14] in a time of a death sentence
[1:55:16] amen the same as us in this hour
[1:55:19] gross darkness is upon the people we're
[1:55:22] living in the darkest hour
[1:55:24] amen and there's no that's just not
[1:55:25] painting a bad picture that's the way it
[1:55:27] is
[1:55:29] amen look at your gas
[1:55:30] prices i told a woman at the car rental
[1:55:33] i said
[1:55:34] she said how much you pay for gas i said
[1:55:36] oh probably about ten dollars your your
[1:55:38] money
[1:55:41] what
[1:55:42] yeah you're paying five or six here
[1:55:44] yeah in canadian
[1:55:47] right
[1:55:49] we're paying a lot more
[1:55:51] ouch
[1:55:52] ouch it's starting to hurt
[1:55:55] amen
[1:55:56] it's it's it's the squeeze
[1:55:58] it we're being squeezed
[1:56:01] they meant economically
[1:56:02] spiritually
[1:56:04] many ways the squeeze is on
[1:56:07] we're feeling it now
[1:56:09] america is feeling it
[1:56:11] canada is feeling it
[1:56:13] so we are here for such a time as this
[1:56:18] we've been
[1:56:18] placed positioned called elected
