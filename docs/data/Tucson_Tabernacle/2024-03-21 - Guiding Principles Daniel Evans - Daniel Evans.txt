to come please and as I said especially the dads there's some things on my heart that I want to talk with the brothers about and it's it's easier to be a little bit more candid when when we're together and we're just brothers and also if you have any questions for me um that you might have on your heart I'll say a few words and like I said I want to express some things that are that are on my heart and want to get off my heart and then feel free to ask any questions and that's this coming Friday at seven o'clock and we'll meet upstairs in the in the chapel upstairs right I am I was on a trip this past week and um it was uh it was a good it was a good trip I was going back we had a like a leadership conference leadership seminar that I had to go to and I hate to miss and I think that my post of Duty's here and and uh but I had to go and I believe it was the Lord's will that I went because when we were there it gave me a more time to pray and I'd come back home to a to a hotel room by myself in the evenings and and had a little bit of a little bit more quiet time maybe than I usually have and learn to share something that was part of this leadership seminar that that many of the brothers and and sisters have maybe have have attended these types of seminars and they talk about um certain things that makes the company better in my case the USGS the the Bureau of the the government that I work for um and they have what's called guiding principles and these guiding principles are what steers your path as a bureau or or as a company and these guiding principles aren't necessarily they're not at all they're not the end goal but what they are is they keep you on track they're like guard rails or bumpers on the edge where you're you're moving in a in a certain direction and and you start to maybe Veer off and these guiding principles will help you get back on the path so that you can you can get to the goal of the organization and of course I work for a scientific organization and and our goals ultimately is to provide the best science and to make changes in the world and and that direction but these guiding principles point us to that ultimate goal and as I said it's very important he's got any principles aren't our ultimate goal but they steer Us in that direction and that's what I wanted to talk about today the title of my sermon is is guiding principles so I went to this seminar and I was I was thinking about these things during the week and got on the plane and uh went went to the back went to my seat and um see there's a fella there and um I I took my seat and then another guy came and and the guy that was already there he was in the wrong seat so the one asked the other one to move and and a little bit abrupt but uh the one wanted to sit next to the window but his his seat was in the middle and another guy he wanted to be at the window and his ticket said that he got to sit on the window so yeah just a few words and then the guy that had to the middle seat he went to the middle seat so we sat down and uh the the stewardess came and the doors weren't even closed yet of the airplane and she came walking walking by to get to the front of the airplane and he says he says excuse me he says can I get some water and uh and she says yeah you know okay I'm busy but so she went and got him a bottle of water and he didn't even drink it he put it in a seat pocket and I thought okay so then then as we're going we take off and and we're going along and and they come with the carts you know how they do and and she comes up and she says to me she says what would you like to drink and I I got my drinking and uh a snack and uh then the guy next to me he says he says well I would like to have ginger ale and she says okay and he says and orange juice I was like oh he's he's uh he's he's going after it so so then she gives him his ginger ale and his orange juice and the guy next to him he says I want orange juice too and I want a Coke I said okay so I'm I'm watching this whole thing unfold and and she takes she says what kind of a snack do you want you have you can get a cookie or pretzels or nuts or something and he says I want all of them and I'm looking at this guy and she gave it to him so I was thinking what if everybody had the same attitude that this guy had and I was thinking she would never get that cart a third of the way through the through the congregation and and then he's sitting there and he has he has all of his stuff and he spills his his spills his ginger ale all over the place but uh that didn't have anything to do with the story yet but I kind of served him right but uh so he only got the orange juice so then we're going along and he presses the button and he leans back in in the sea I don't know why they put those those seats on airplanes because it just collapses the back the back uh seat that's right behind you so he does that and he's the guys all over the place and it was like this whole flight was just there just to serve him and again I thought what if the whole what if all of the the airline what if the whole congregation here thought like this man did is I'm here for you to serve me and I thought as we were going and I'm and I'm I'm taking my notes I have my laptop out and I'm working on the sermon and I'm writing down everything this guy's doing and and I was thinking what are his guiding principles in life what's this man like outside of this airplane and and I don't want to condemn I don't want to judge the man he may be a perfectly good person but his impression on to me was that he was in this life to be served and his guiding principles what guided him through life is how much he could get from any situation he's sitting there and and I'm typing away and the guy is just all spread out and I'm over in the aisle and I'm I'm typing and and I was I was thinking how many of us might act like this man does and these guiding principles Maybe that are these guiding principles in our lives what steers us through are they to serve ourselves or do we have a goal at the end that's so important that these guiding principles are set to keep us on that road of Excellence as as the seminar said on this road that we will eventually reach that ultimate goal which is not death which is not the the end of life but which is a life beyond here and a life that we will forever be with our lord Jesus and these guiding principles they need to steer us towards that otherwise we are on this Earth to serve ourselves and everything that everything that we do and and even in coming to church what does this church mean do we come to church like this man sitting next to me do we come to church saying what can you do for me how is this church going to serve me or do we come with the attitude of Lord how can I serve other people what can I do as I'm there as a very Foundation of Christianity is to serve others the Lord Jesus came and he was the ultimate example for these things which is this is how I serve others and he was the sacrificial lamb that gave his life for all of us and not only did he give his life at the end this is so important but he gave his life from the beginning he never sinned we think we don't think of Jesus as being God made flesh we think of Jesus as just God he was God but don't forget the word teaches us that he was God made flesh so he had to go through this life with the same temptations that we have to go through and yet he did not sin he went through it not asking to be served but spending his whole life serving and doing for others and not snapping his finger and saying how can you serve me he came here as a servant and I was in this sermon seminar the most important thing about these guiding principles in in going down this road and to reach these ultimate goals every single principle taught us to work together because there is power in unity and brother Dan you've been in business for a long time I assume that that's the case with any company that you've ever been to that training and Leadership teaches you how to work together as one for a common goal and we this is how this this seminar was and I and I was thinking as I was learning this whole thing is not necessarily about the science and making some great discovery or or something that's going to curb global warming or coming up with with some sort of environmental um thing that'll take Plastics out of the ocean or something like that the ultimate goal was to work together because even Satan knows that if the people will be one that they are an Unstoppable Force every company in the world knows that every organization every government knows that if the people can be one then they can accomplish anything we see it in the Bible in the Book of Genesis we see the Tower of Babel and they all of these these people they had got together they they became one and their guiding principles were pointing them in One Direction was to build this great tower God looked down and he said this he said behold the people is one even used is it's not a mistake I didn't say it wrong he said behold the people is one and they are now capable of doing anything that they imagine to do this is a worldly group of people that don't have the Holy Spirit and they're they're moving together and they are able to change the world and build this Tower and God looks down and says wow he says he doesn't say wow he looks down he says I gotta change this he says I've got to stop this so then what what way could God do it to stop all of their working together and building this Tower he says I'm not going to let them communicate so he takes their language away from them and then the tower fails and we see that that but even in even without God unity and moving in direct in One Direction is a great powerful force then time goes on and we see in the book of Acts now we see the other side we see all of this group of people they have their guiding principles here and we see this group of people that receive the Holy Spirit and their guiding principles are keeping them on the path to introduce Jesus Christ to a Dying World that was the ultimate goal and these guiding principles and we read all through the New Testament that these guiding principles kept them on the path everything from from how how to live your life and and not to sin and and all of these and how to believe and how a church should function all of these things were guiding principles that kept them on the path to finally introduce eternal life to so many people and it was the greatest power that has ever been it was it was the outpouring of the Holy Spirit it started at the day of Pentecost and we've been going through the book of Acts and we see just the power and we see normal people like you and me normal people just filled with the holy spirit all in unity so much so it says that that they were of one heart and one soul moving forward in the power of the gospel and putting the word first keeping Within These guiding principles for an ultimate destination can you think of some guiding principles that the lord gave us can you think of what are the most famous ones yes the Ten Commandments so what happened is Moses was they had just come out of Egypt they were only on the on the road for like three months and they're out there in Moses goes up on Mount Sinai and he speaks to the Lord and and the Lord was was speaking back and and there he he sends Moses back down to the people and he says he says tell the people to get ready tell them to consecrate themselves he says tell them to stay outside the perimeter of this mountain he says but I'm going to come down and they're going to see me I'm going to come down in this thick smoke so Moses goes down and he and he tells the people and and the people make themselves ready and then the mountain starts shaking and and there was like a fire going through the mountain and it was it was a frightening thing but then God gives his Ten Commandments to his prophet and it says this and let's start with these Ten Commandments Exodus chapter 20. before I start reading as I said before God wants us together and he wants us moving in the same direction not a denomination not an organization but he wants us led by the same Holy Spirit each one of us and we look in the book of Acts each one of them had a different different role to play and if we don't have if we don't have that vision if we don't have as I said if we don't have this these these guard rails on the side then we can get off and the Bible many times talks about that men did what was right in their own eyes and it they would always they would always get off in Proverbs it says this it says the way of a fool is right in his own eyes so many times people want to serve themselves and they'll look at a situation and they'll make a decision and they'll say that you know what this serves me better so I'm going to do it this way when God wants it his way but most people in this world will make a decision on how this serves me better and as I said it Proverbs 12 15 it says this the way of a fool is right in his own eyes Exodus chapter 20 verse 1. God speaking and giving these first Commandments and God spake all these words saying I am the Lord thy God which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage Thou shalt have no other gods before me number one Thou shalt not make unto thee any Graven image number two or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is on the earth beneath or that is in the water underneath Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God me only is what's God's saying visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and the fourth generation of them that hate me and showing Mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my Commandments Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain number three for the Lord will not hold him Guiltless but taketh his name in vain remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy number four six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God in it Thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter the man's servant nor thy maid servant nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates for in six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth and see and all that is in them and rested the seventh day whereof the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it honor thy father and thy mother number five that thy days May belong upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee Thou shalt not kill number six Thou shalt not commit adultery number seven Thou shalt not steal number eight Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor number nine and thou shalt not covet number ten thy neighbor's house Thou shalt not cover Thy Neighbor covet thy neighbor's wife nor his man servant nor his maidservant nor zox nor zast nor anything that is thy neighbors and all the people saw the thunderings and the Lightnings and the noise of of the trumpet and the mountains smoking and when the people saw it they removed and stood afar off and they said unto Moses speak thou with us and we will hear but let not God speak with us but not God speak with us lest we die and Moses said unto the people fear not for God has come to prove you and that his fear may be before your faces that you sin not then God goes on to give more Commandments many many more Commandments and they all look like they pertain to one of these ten but he starts drilling down and being more specific and more specific and then in Exodus 23 verse 20 God said behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies in an adversary unto thine adversaries thus God had given these Ten Commandments to the people and they started following this thing called this great thing God's word called the law and as time went on we see down through the prophets and as time goes on people it looks to me like people stopped looking at this law as The Guiding principles that was going to get them somewhere and they started looking at the principles they started just looking at the law and they ignored The Giver of the law until as time went on we get to the end of the Old Testament to This Book of Malachi and sin had just went through all of the people of Israel to the point where where they were they were looking at the law and they said okay we have to pay our tithes we have to we have to wash dishes in a certain way we have to we have to not eat catfish and not eat pigs and all these things and they had forgotten what these things represent they'd forgotten that this sacrifice that they were making it represented none other than the Messiah that was to come but they get caught up in the act of doing it they got caught up in just looking at the principles or the Commandments and they had forgotten what these Commandments were pointing them towards to learn the Book of Malachi they were to the point now they were still doing their sacrifices but God didn't mean enough to them anymore to give their best of the flock so they would give the worst it's like well I can I can spare this lamb it's not going to bring me much at the market and they would take that one and sacrifice it they wouldn't spend there they divorced their wives said oh well Moses wrote us the writing of divorcement over here so so I can just divorce my wife for any little thing even more they in Malachi 3 they wouldn't they don't even pay their tithes they're like well you know I'll give a little bit I'll give I'll give a little bit here and there and then we see that they had forgotten they were looking at the principles and they had forgotten where these principles should be taking them we looked at back to where God gave these Ten Commandments they were like three months for the Wilson I think that's right about three months that they were in the wilderness and they stayed there for another 40 years because the enemy came in and started making them talk about each other gossip about each other it says murmuring and that was the sin that kept creeping up is this murmuring and fighting among one another God hated it God would lead them and you have the pillar of Fire by by night and the pillar of cloud by day and they were following this thing Manna was coming down from heaven and all these great miracles happen and they complained God was doing all these things and you see it it goes all the way to the Book of Malachi to where now it was they had all of these different rules and regulations on how to wash dishes and how to wash their hands and all this stuff and it's things that God didn't even intend he had a purpose in doing these things and they had forgotten the purpose and made their doctrines on only the guiding principles and they had lost the meaning for the whole thing then after this Book of Malachi then came the one that was a fulfillment of all of these rules and regulations and laws that they had been talking about and yet like I said they were looking at the rules and disregarding the reason behind the rules brother Branham said this Revelation chapter 4 number 2. he says remember my sermon the other night brother Jordan do you have that is that brother or brother Noah I got two quotes I want to put them up because I want the people to read them uh Revelation chapter four number two it's the first one brother Branham he talks about a and it's a funny word he talks about a that received a gift and he unwraps a gift and he throws the gift away and he keeps the Box I'll read it says this remember my sermon the other night see like the he kept the box and throwed the gift gift away see don't take the box take the gift and I think about well when he says he says he says remember my sermon on the the other day he was referring to God's wrapped gift and this is the quote that he was referring to he says there's something for everybody that's right sinner friend there's something for the Gambler there's something for the liar there's something for every person there's something in this Christmas package for you don't cast it aside how Pharisee the foolish took the tensile and throw it away the gift what a pitiful thing so what they did is they took the guiding principles that were that were packages in packaging this great gift they took just the guiding principles and they threw away the gift and they just focused on the road to get there and they probably wouldn't if they would have understood they probably wouldn't have wandered in the wilderness for 40 years The Seventh-Day Adventist they take these scriptures on the Sabbath about the Sabbath and then they've built a whole religion on if you worship on Saturday now you're the elect and they focus on this this one scripture that says that that honor the Sabbath and keep it holy but then they forget about why that this this sabbath was set in order the Sabbath was set in order Jesus said he made this statement it's a profound statement he said the Sabbath he says man was not created for the Sabbath he said the Sabbath was created for man so often we're looking at it's like we're looking at the Sabbath and the Sabbath was a gift from God God knew he loved us he knew that that if you didn't honor a day that you'd be working every day you'd be staying home and and today and staying home and watching watching the ball games and and not honoring the Lord's day but if he said this is a rule that you have to Worship On this day then he knew that they would honor that and go and be blessed by it but it wasn't created for God it was created to help us to encourage us to encourage these people to to worship and don't neglect those things but so often we're living a life that's focusing on The Guiding principles and The Guiding principles are not directing Us in the right path then we become just like the brother Branham said don't be a we don't want to be that we want to we want to have this gift so we we see these Ten Commandments come down and we see now Jesus comes on the scene and fulfills these Ten Commandments let's turn to Matthew chapter five and watch what Jesus says about these guiding principles verse 17. Matthew 5 17. he says think not Jesus speaking think not that I am come to destroy the law of the prophets I am not come to destroy but fulfill right there we see hey don't cut out the Old Testament this old testament's still true I hear so many people say well that's Old Testament yeah still God's word for verily I say unto you till Heaven and Earth pass past not one jot or one Tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till it all be fulfilled here he is he's talking about the Old Testament these are the words of God and they must be fulfilled he's saying that he's not giving Jesus is not giving a new set of principles here he's taking the ones that have been given and now he's showing us as we see a real Minister Jesus operating here he's showing us how to apply these in our own lives whosoever therefore shall break one of the least of these Commandments and T and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same Shall be Called great in the Kingdom of Heaven for I say unto you that accept your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven how could we how could our righteousness exceed that of these men that have lived their life from when they were babies as perfect as they could before the Lord I really believe it's because they weren't focusing on the god that gave them these Commandments they were focusing on just just the Commandment that's why it's so important that we understand what we're learning when we read this book understand it because these are the words of life we have to know we have to know many times we have to know why he said certain things when we're when we're teaching our kids we set a rule and sometimes the kids will follow and sometimes they won't but if you show them why to follow it now they understand if if you say here's here's the reason you don't stick those wires in the light socket because it's going to hurt you but you just say no don't do that first thing they're going to do is stick them in there but then they won't ever do it again verse number 21 you have heard that it was said of them of old time Thou shalt not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment he's on the sixth commandment here he's on the sixth guiding principle now he's gonna say here's why you don't do this something that that Jesus came to brought this understanding watch how the Holy Spirit applies it to their lives but I say unto you that whosoever is anger angry with his brother Without a Cause shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say to his brother raqqa shall be in the danger of the counsel but whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of Hell Fire he's saying that yeah don't kill but apply this everywhere in your life there's very few people in the world that are murderers but how many of us are guilty of murder according to the Lord Jesus how many people in this room how many of us are guilty of murder brother Branham said this Hebrews chapter 7. number two he said you don't have to stick a knife in a man's back to kill him you can break his character and kill him you can kill his influence speak against your pastor here say something bad about him you might just as well as shot him told something that wasn't right about him well it'll kill his influence with the people like that and you're guilty of it what Jesus said and not just a pastor but of each other we can say something just just a little bit off or just a little bit right it might be perfectly true but then we'll say it and we'll hurt that person and kill that person's reputation and Jesus says right here you are guilty of murder I think how many of us in this room are guilty of murder we might not be in prison for spilling someone's blood but according to the Lord Jesus here we are guilty therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar and there remember us that thy brother hath ought against thee leave it leave there thy gift before the Altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift he's saying here that you're breaking the law so not God is not going to hear your prayers or receive your offering until you go and make this right until you go and make this murder or you make this lie or whatever it is until you go and you make that right I look here what an honor it was for them to be able to bring their gift into the church I see here Jesus is speaking and he's speaking to people that it was important that I'm able to contribute it's important that I'm able to to come in and do something for the church it was so important here and Jesus is saying he's not even gonna he's not even gonna let you he's not even going to hear or receive your offering until you go make this right and I think wow what a difference in today's society look at how many how important it was to these people to be able to contribute to be able to do something for the church and now we see people they don't want to do anything I'll show up on Sunday morning and and uh I'll get something out of it don't come to church to get come to church to give when when you're sitting there the person next to you should be benefiting from you being there that's the Christian way he says agree with thine adversary quickly whilst Thou Art in the way with them lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to judgment and the judge deliver thee to the officer and thou be cast into prison Jesus he's saying here it's it says in the English Standard Version it says come to terms with your accuser first and Jesus is saying in other words if you're going to go to the Judgment against someone if you stick to your guns with your argument you're risking the very worst punishment he says don't go there and I think in uh in law today they have what's called a plea bargain because because this accused this this person that's accused he sees that end result and he's like ah I don't want that so he makes makes a deal and this one we see here that that Jesus is saying listen if you take your brother to task on something you're risking you're risking a lot so Jesus is saying here don't don't do it you don't want to take that chance verily I say unto thee Thou shalt by no means come out hints till thou has paid the other most farthing if you're wrong he's saying you're going to pay for every penny you have heard that it was said by them of old time Thou shalt not commit adultery now we're on the seventh commandment Jesus here is quoting when I just what I read earlier but I say unto you that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart now we look and we see we see the and he's looking at this and he's saying well I didn't commit adultery I didn't I didn't sleep around to my wife no no no no no you're missing it you're just looking at the guiding principles you're not seeing the ultimate the ultimate end game here and it says here that he says that that you committed if if you lust after this woman you have committed adultery with her meaning there's two involved in this so if this man is looking out at this woman and he he just has a desire not that he does it Jesus is raising the level here he says if you just want to you're guilty of it with her so then now she's also guilty for presenting herself in that way for leading that man on for flirting with that man for presenting without presenting it that way so now she's guilty now you have two people guilty Jesus here he's saying this is the reason for this don't just look at the box look at the meaning behind it oh yeah we have our rules on how women should dress or how men should dress and all of these things but remember it's not the Box there's a reason behind it if you understand the reason then you're not going to go there understand the principle if I write I offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members for it is profitable profitable for that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast to hell the stakes are high and If thy right hand defend me cut it off and cast it from me for this profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not for thy whole body not that thy whole body should be cast into hell it has been said whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement they're looking back here to the law and saying oh I can do it Moses said I can divorce my wife Jesus says this but I say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causes her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced commits adultery if the people understood the guiding principle of not committing adultery they wouldn't have tried to divorce their wives in the first place in another place Jesus was called out and they asked him they were trying to trying to trick him and they said well that that uh what about divorcing our wives and Jesus says he says no he says he says it wasn't so he says he says the Lord did that because of the hardness of your heart you're going to do it anyways he said but it wasn't so from the beginning let me let me talk I want to mention maybe to some of the young people that as you're going through life and as as you're getting older and you're thinking about marriage you're thinking about a man or a woman and how that that there's such Joy in having a companion and you might as you might see your parents or you might you might have this idea of spending your life with someone getting married and it's a wonderful thing it is it is a wonderful thing but be so careful be careful because if if if you're looking to someone because they're attractive or that they're successful or whatever it might be be so careful because you can ruin your life make sure that is the right person that you are marrying because it will destroy you wait on the Lord and and these guiding principles they're if you stay within them if you stay Within These Commandments from God and what this Bible teaches it will bring you to happiness but I cannot say enough how important it is to find the right mate I have seen so many lives ruined over the years so many times and it's because they got haphazard if there is any question in your mind about this person wait wait until you hear from the Lord and approach the Lord with an Open Heart Lord what what do you want me to do and he'll show you signs and it might be it might be he'll show you that he'll he'll he'll you'll see a sin rise up in that person or you'll see character rise up in that person be careful with what you want because as I said before he'll give you a sign you'll get a sign that's going to be what you want but surrender to the Lord and wait for his word on these things again young people not married be careful because this decision besides deciding to give your heart to the Lord deciding to serve the Lord is the most important decision that you'll make verse 33 again you have heard that it has been said by them of old time Thou shalt not forswear thyself but shall perform unto the Lord thine thy knows this part is a little hard to understand so I want to keep keep the King James but know if you can go along with me I want to keep the keep the King James up there and I'm going to read out of the English Standard Version verse number 33 says this again you have heard that it was said to those of old you shall not swear falsely but shall perform to the Lord what you have what you have sworn but I say to you do not take an oath at all either by heaven for it is the Throne of God or by the Earth for it is the footstool or by Jerusalem for it is the city of the great king and do not take an oath by your head for you cannot make one hair white or black let what you say be simply yes or no yay or nay anything more than this comes from Evil the Lord Jesus is saying that these Stakes are so high don't go before the Lord and say Lord I promise I'm not going to do that sin again just don't do it don't go and and stand and say I swear I've never cheated on my taxes or I swear I've never done this or I swear I will never do this let your yes be yes and your no be no and we should be living such a good life before the people of this world that they would look at us and say that man or that woman's word is concrete they have great character that's that's the way we should live our lives verse number 38. you have heard that it's been said an eye for an eye on a tooth for a tooth getting back to the Old Testament but I say unto you that you resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him also to the other and if any man again it's back to the Old Testament he's saying that that oh yeah it used to be an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but if you understood this back then that okay it was fair that if this guy did this to me I can do it to him but now that those principles now become life and he says listen if somebody slaps you in the face take it let them do it and if any will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let them have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compare thee to go a mile go with him Twain go two miles verse 42 give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow thee and turn not thou away and friends you know I look at this scripture give to him that assathy and from him that that would borrow a V and turn not away I I look at I know brother Branham said that there's three kinds of Believers in every congregation I've been on my heart all week I've been looking it's like seeing that there's three kinds of people in this world there are those that give and there are those that take and there are those that are in the middle and and I see that like this man sitting next to me may have been a very giving man I'm not trying to condemn him I just I'm just my impression of him he was a taker he wanted everybody to serve him and we come to church and and you see that there's people what are you going to do for me what was it there was a song Maybe done for me lately a long time ago was that a song I don't know nobody would admit it if it was it's okay to smile it's all right but it's not about that it's about what I can do and I see this give to him that asks let's skip for time's sake let's skip to the to verse number 48. it says this it says be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect think about that I think about wow that's that's a really high standard but Jesus commanded it be perfect we can't be perfect if we're like the and we're just we're just looking at the Box there's a gift inside of that box that we need to become one with and Jesus is saying here he's saying listen all of these things all of all of these Commandments that have happened that that Moses brought you follow those but they are to be make you perfect that is the ultimate goal is perfection perfection in the Lord it gets down you know it I think about I think about just think about just the church you know I think about about all of us and and the body of Believers around the world and I think about what Jesus said he says straight is the gate speaking of religious people straight is the gate and narrow is the way and few there will be that find it I think about this room and Lord there will probably be people in here that never enter into the kingdom I know that's not a great thing to say but it's a fact Jesus is saying here he's saying be ye perfect follow these Commandments these guiding principles that I have given you but don't stop with the guiding principle understand it and know where it's taking us we look at there's a scripture that that we use so often I think it's Deuteronomy 22 it says it says that a man shall not wear a garment pertaining to a woman and a woman shall not wear a garment pertaining to a man and we interpret that in a certain way let me tell you something when that was written there were no pants there were robes don't be a he was trying to separate the sexes he was saying a woman should be feminine she shouldn't act like a man and a man he shouldn't be he shouldn't be feminine he should act masculine and it took a prophet to come and to say that this is important today these things and now we see what it's led to never before we've seen such sin in the world we see these influencers in this garbage that we see on on on the social media and on YouTube and all that it's filth and look what it's led to it's not he was warning us he was saying here are your guidelines be careful of these things don't cross over we talk we talk so much about about clothes and dress but as I said it's to separate the Sexes you see now you see women you don't have to wear be wearing a pair of pants you can wear the pants in the family telling your husband we're gonna do this and then that husband because his walk with the Lord isn't good enough he doesn't he's not a leader in his home this book teaches us that that man should lead his home I'm not saying boss everybody around and all that that's that's not what it means it's saying that that man should live such a life as to represent Christ to his family and we see in Deuteronomy it's saying that you separate these things you separate these two genders because each one of them has a different role the two have different roles and Jesus repeats that we see in Romans it repeats it Romans chapter 1 we see throughout the Bible that it'll come to sin and then there's examples of how it's come to sin but instead we look at the Box instead we look at the rule and and deny what that rule is for it's for a masculine and a feminine being that God created think of the greatest all those guiding principles I'll close with this all of those guiding principles that we see all of those beautiful scriptures in the Old Testament and how that you can see that they they represent things that they're not meant as the is not meant to look at the box but there's something that is behind it and if we can if we can just understand what's behind if the musicians would come Jesus made such a beautiful statement I think of this this obedient Sun and how he lived this this perfect life and he said be ye therefore perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect he told us to do that and I see Jesus going through his life and he makes this statement in John chapter 8. verse 29. he says this this is the guiding principle that we should always follow in our lives Jesus said in he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me alone for I do always those things that please him what a statement oh how I would love to be able to say that there is my guiding principle in life Lord I want to do everything that you command Lord let me follow these guiding principles that you've given let me understand them so that I might be able to say these same things that our lord Jesus said that I always do that which pleases my father it goes right back to that first commandment I am the Lord your God and thou shalt not have any other gods before me the father's first Jesus even in going to the Garden of Gethsemane he knew what was going to happen he gets down there and don't forget I said that he is God made flesh he gets down bows down on his knees and the weight of the world was upon him and he says this he says Lord says let this cup pass from me there he was a man Jesus Christ how can we relate to that I don't want to do this there's some things sometimes that we know that it's God's will but we don't want to do it [Music] well yeah Jesus is there and he says he says Lord let this cup pass from me but imagine if that would have been a period but thy will be done how beautiful what a beautiful statement he lived up to what he said I always do that which pleases my father always I'm gonna Lord I'm gonna do whatever you require of me I might be tired I might not want to do it [Music] I might not I might not wanna go and and and I always say go to church go to church or or might not want to go to work or I might not want to want to serve somebody but ask the Lord father what do you want there there is our example I always do that which pleases the father Jeremy I want to do it no I don't want to I don't want to waste any more time I want to Lord I want to do everything I want to follow the example of the Son of God these guiding principles that Moses brought and the prophets brought they they lie in our ways and if we can just stay within within those guiding principles with the ultimate goal of this Holy Spirit telling us what to do at all times always doing that which pleases the father that's what I want do you want the same thing how do we do it how do we please him how do we how do we get to know him how do we how do we hear his voice [Music] ask the question to the congregation to each person what are your guiding principles in life what's guiding every decision that you make foreign what's bringing you down this road how are you making decisions does it to Serve Yourself for me is it just Lord is it to serve myself or can I say and I want to say it so bad can I say Lord I always do that which pleases you I make mistakes of course I make mistakes just wasn't saying don't make mistakes when he said be thou perfect [Music] saying follow these principles [Music] that you might understand that you might go to the father that the Lord Jesus might present us to the father I believe it's Romans chapter I believe it's Romans chapter 12 it says give your body as a Living Sacrifice to the Lord I want to read it I can't I can't skip it believe the Lord wants it read [Music] I beseech you Romans 12 verse 1 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable to God which is your reasonable service [Music] and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God how I want to be able to go before him with the son of God say how I always did that which pleased my father all those mistakes that I've made they're gone they don't matter all the mistakes that I'm going to make in the future it don't matter but if my heart is right and I'm not staring at the Box but I understand why he gave it I understand why it was important that that we underst that that we know the difference the differences between men and women that we understand why it's important that that the men don't look at women in the wrong way and the women don't look at the men in the wrong way and each one isn't presenting themselves in the wrong way not rules like the morons looking at but understanding that there is an end game to this in all friends goes towards this be perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect please we have communion coming up this weekend next weekend please think on these things think on Lord what are my guiding principles in my life because you make your guiding principles each one of us we're making these principles and we're saying Lord I'm going to live my life in this way for what reason is it to benefit me or is it to benefit my brother my sister is it to serve God we cannot we cannot do anything for God he's Sovereign he's our creator he's Eternal he's perfect but what we can do is we can serve his children and that's what he requires now we see a book of Acts we see a Tower of Babel erected and he destroyed it but then we see a book of Acts that was far greater brother Wilson than that Tower of Power it was God's people working together serving each other please please sitter your guiding principles in life consider what you're living your life for considering how you're making your decisions is it because of the box or is it because of the spirit behind is it because of the gift that was in the box [Music] feels important I feel maybe ask maybe the congregation ask you if [Music] but while maybe we can put off the book of Acts till Wednesday my brother Lyle had a sermon prepared for this evening and I was I was thinking about a sermon too I didn't really know what decision to make but but maybe we could take some time [Music] prayer tonight this afternoon this evening and

you speaking just one word from God just one word from him from him speaking to you is more than anyone in this whole world could say seek him so important [Music] I just don't I don't take it seriously don't neglect God don't neglect our Lord that that did so much for us put him first let these guiding principles in this book let them point you to the one that that gave us life and that will give us eternal life we do it don't neglect it it's about our heads I'm sorry for all my sins Lord there's nothing that we could ever do [Music] but the only thing that we can try to do Lord is to follow your word [Music] Place ourselves before you and make our bodies a Living Sacrifice to you let those The Guiding principles that are in this book this blessed book let them rule Our Lives Lord that we might find be able to say that in one day be able to say I always did that which pleased my father Lord that's our goal is to please you pray for every person in this congregation Lord that that your hand would be upon them and as we go through today and we think about you Lord that that you'd be with us and as we evaluate these these guiding principles of Our Lives Lord that that
