through it still love the lord still serving the lord amen thank you musicians wasn't that nice to hear the music tonight it's an encouragement get all those gloomy depression spirits away from us you

help him amen if you have your bibles i want to go over to hebrews the third chapter hebrews the third chapter hebrews chapter three tomorrow uh morning and i just that was our agreement we'd be together for three weeks and then we'd all separate a little bit and pray and i think it's prayer is a good thing you seek the will of the lord that's the best way to find the will of god is in prayer so that was our agreement and i believe that tucson tabernacle needs a pastor i believe the lord's blessed us and seen real i was sitting in the back here and everybody clapped back there and it was like wow this is a this is a wonderful you know everybody clapping and worshiping the lord and uh you know i just thank the lord for his holy spirit i think through the last course of the last eight weeks i think brother arnie baptized one and we baptized about four and it's just blessed my heart to see people get baptized and want to serve the lord and amen see young people repenting and had some young people's services and see them repenting and the fellowship people healed and people back backslid come back to god those that were sliding back decide they didn't want to backslide anymore and they wanted to go forward with god and be closer than they'd have ever been and see the ministers i thought sunday night was special to see the brothers come and minister it was unique but we learned it wrong you know new is not wrong or different is not wrong we talked about new songs we got to learn a new song over in the book of revelation they sang a new song so you got to learn some new songs i was singing or reading over psalms there it said david said singing to the lord a new new song so it's good to have a few you know new songs now and then but amen god's good man he knows what he's doing as i said we just came through a pandemic all of us we've all been through hard times but i tell people i said you know what you're still standing you know we went through the pandemic sometimes in business and all and you just say you know aside from all that we're still in business you know whatever we've been through as a church we're still a church maybe you go through sickness and heartache and pain you say but i'm still a christian i still love the lord jesus i still you know have a pulse i'm still alive and the same spiritually you say you know i still love the lord and still have a desire for the lord jesus and if he comes in the morning i want to be ready amen that's our desire in coming to church hebrews chapter 3 i just want to go to the scripture have a unique thought tonight let's just bow our heads together heavenly father it's so good to be in your house and see all the musicians lord playing their instruments and the singers playing and singing lord together and the saints gathered out on this midweek prayer service lord lord to have the freedom to open our bibles and to read your word and father i pray god as we open the bible that you would just touch our hearts you would strengthen us you encourage us lord you know the frailty of the human mind as we were walking lord and there was sand on the trail up one of the trails and we thought you know man is just like a little piece of sand life is but a moment but lord you know all about it father we're coming to your house we're submitting ourselves to you and pray that you would be glorified tonight as we sing the song lord in our life may you be glorified lord you know every prayer that we've prayed you know the desire of our heart our greatest desires to draw closer to you father i pray god you would strengthen us you would help us tonight as we read your word lord anoint the word of god lord just the letter will kill us but i pray lord the spirit you said my words are spirit and their life and may the spirit of god that wrote the word come into this building and strengthen every heart that's here lord if there's somebody that's sick lord may they be healed lord if there's someone that's away from you may they come to know you in the power of your resurrection lord if there's someone that's never been filled with the holy ghost lord may you fill their life lord completely with the spirit of god and charge them and give them power to be a witness for you lord help them lord we pray lord bless brother ron peterson's brother dawn who's had open heart surgery today and he texts me and asks us to pray we pray god that the our our faith would reach to him and you pray you'd touch him lord and whatever his spiritual condition is may he be drawn closer to you and help him lord jesus i pray for joseph roberts tonight lord you continue to heal his leg lord as he's been in pain but you're the healer of all of our sicknesses and all of our diseases lord pray god you continue to heal sister connie lord and we're believing together lord and she goes to the doctor lord but we believe your report you said by my stripes you can be healed lord may you help us lord you said many are the afflictions of the righteous but lord you promised to deliver us out of them all father you delivered our brothers and sisters at the red sea lord you delivered daniel and the lions then lord you delivered shadrach meshach and abednego father you delivered the disciples on the stormy sea that day father and i believe lord whatever the devil would send our way you're more than a conqueror for everything that the enemy would throw at us lord lift our faith tonight lord we believe that all things are possible to them that believe lord as we read your word it's the scripture says faith comes by hearing and may you just inspire us may you draw us closer to the fire of god and lord anything that's not like you lord may it just leave us in that presence of the holy spirit we ask in the name of jesus christ amen praise the lord hebrews chapter 3 starting with verse 1 the bible says wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus consider the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus i just want to take three words of that consider christ jesus consider christ jesus may god bless you you can be seated i just want to take this little thought tonight that we could study god's word don't you love the word of god amen i love the word of god there's something about god's word it makes you strong amen when you hear the word of god it it lifts you up and i love that what the prophet of god said he said man's faith should not rest on the shifting sands of man's theology but rest and have faith in the word of god so what we believe should come from the word of god i've we sing a little song i've anchored in jesus amen i've anchored in jesus the storms of life out brave i was thinking of the scripture over there in peter it says the scriptures which are able to to save you amen you've believed the holy scripture i think paul told timothy they're able to make you wise and to salvation it comes from the scriptures amen that our faith is in the scriptures in the word of god and as i was reading this scripture i i was thinking about this hebrews chapter 3 but i want to go back to chapter 2 amen because what we know about god should come from the bible so many people they have experiences and and you know those things i appreciate those but brother and he taught us so many things i thank god for this message i love this message it came from jesus christ amen and the prophet of god amen tells us that we should anchor our faith in the word of god verse number 9 of chapter 2 hebrews chapter 2 verse number 9. he said but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man every man god tasted death for every man john said behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the whole world god doesn't judge the world because they were sinners all of us were born and sinned shaped in iniquity now the world is covered with a how could we say a bumper of blood and and the wrath of god the great eternal god one evil thing in his presence would god would just annihilate but he looks and sees the earth through the blood of jesus christ aren't you thankful for that aren't you glad he sees you through the blood of jesus christ amen but one day that blood will be lifted and then he that is filthy let him be filthy still him that is holy let him be holy still and then men will be judged because god provided a propitiation to take away their sins but men chose to stay in their sins and then god judges them for that how's a has a little saying some men sins go before and some men sins come after i want to send all my sins before amen say lord forgive me lord cleanse me of my sins do you believe in the forgiveness of god though your sins be a scarlet they'll be white as snow though they'd be red like crimson amen i believe god could make hillary clinton a prayer warrior in this church do you believe that oh you say well she's done this this and this well then you don't believe that the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sins amen i believe it cleanses us from all sins so it says here he he paid the the debt for all men verse number 10 and it became him for whom are all things and by are all things by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of our salvation perfect through suffering through suffering christ went through suffering and for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren you have a family member like i'm not ashamed to call this my brother he's the bible says he's not ashamed to call you his brother it can only be by the blood of jesus christ i love the blood of jesus christ the bible says we're made nigh by the blood of jesus christ i've heard a lot of doctrines and things that make my head spend but i want to know from the scripture my faith that i'm made nigh to an eternal god by the blood of jesus christ and no one can take that away from me no one can take the scripture out of my heart you can amen you can take all my church from you can take my bible from me but you'll never take a revelation from my heart jesus said i'm going to build a church and the gates of hell will never prevail against this church and it's built on a rock of revelation so many people are built on knowledge i hate to say it a lot of people are built on stories and their faith rests on stories i went to sunset mountain here a few years ago and they had a lot of brothers and we went and it went from what the prophet of god said to a bunch of fanaticism and i could tell you a story and it didn't just a lot of fanaticism and the brother said wait we drove away they said man you're just a skeptic i'm like you've added two and take away brother rem said just say what i say on the tapes and what you're saying isn't what he said on the tapes people saying that blast came down and cut all the trees down to the ground and and uh i said well i don't think he said that i don't think he said that went back and looked at him he said he cut the tops of the trees out and so you go back and hear what the prophet of god said and that's why it's so crucial to say what the prophet of god said and say what the bible says i believe god came down at sunset mountain i believe in 1962 brother branham had a vision he would come out and have a blast and even the vision left him numb for days he said then he comes out and he met the seven angels and there was a blast and he was caught up in a commission to go back and preach the seven seals and it happened just the way it was prophesied then he come out in 1964 and he goes up there and the day before the angel lord said throw it back throw that rock up in there he throws it up in the air and it comes back down and said judgment will hit the west coast and you'll see the power of god and just the next day they're in the camp he tells brother roberson i worked with brother roberts and he was an old veteran he didn't have any muscle i think in the back of his arm and he just held his arm like this and he didn't he was a trustee for brother branham and brother graham they're camping there and brother random told him said brother roberson he said be careful something's about to happen and get under something he was a veteran he got over away from brother adam stepped out and the bla whirlwind came down a blast came down three times so judgment is striking the west coast three days later i believe it was alaska almost sunk amen may god help us to realize these things that we believe are true god vindicated a message in this day i'll say this he didn't vindicate me and he didn't vindicate you he vindicated god's prophet amen paul said let us not nothing will separate us from the love of god and the scriptures that we see fulfilled in our day is that okay because it's a revelation and once it's revealed to you can't see anything but the revelation of god verse number go down here a little bit farther for the sake of time verse 15 and deliver them who through the fear of death were all their lifetimes subject to bondom for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of of abraham wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made likened to his brethren that he may be a merciful and faithful high priest aren't you glad he's a faithful high priest who was it was it you brother aaron that spoke over here and said our god doesn't slumber was that you brother and it said that i think one of the brothers said he doesn't slumber he doesn't sleep it came up on the thing i remember i was sitting there and i was looking at the screen you didn't read that on sunday night one of the brothers he does not slumber he's not like hey i'm checking out here aren't you glad you have a private high priest that doesn't check out on you amen i need a high price priest the bible says he ever liveth to make intercession for us he says he's a faithful high priest in all things pertaining to god and to make reconciliation for the sins of the people in that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able to sucker that word means sympathize with them that are tempted and so in the next chapter it says wherefore holy brethren partakers of the holy calling heavenly calling consider christ jesus consider christ jesus and i i wanted to think about that because it's it's interesting how the bible says it says christ jesus it just doesn't say jesus you all live here close to the border there's many people there to name jesus so it's just not jesus it's the anointed one christ means the anointed one this is christ jesus we do so many things by faith and we don't even realize what we're doing we have a cross up there you know that that that listen to me closer what we do is by faith do you know this cross up here is actually would be the equivalent of putting a an electric chair out somewhere it was the means of capital punishment in jesus day how many are with me so we would set an electric chair out there with the little armbands and the straps that they strapped them up there and we put a symbol of capital punishment in our churches not to symbolize what the romans did two thousand years but it symbolizes one thing it's an empty cross amen they took him off the cross and put him in a tomb if we had a tomb the the tomb would be empty and then christ rose from the dead so our symbol indicates our faith it doesn't indicate a capital punishment are you with me brother robert you see it's not just capital punishment by faith i look at a symbol and it strikes a it tells a story of faith we were talking the other day and i might even mention here you know we sing the song there is a fountain filled with blood people like i'm not going to your church you all got a water of a blood fountain at your church full of blood and you took it out of emanuel's veins and you take people and plunge them beneath the flood and they lose all their guilty stains you didn't think about what you're singing did you because you're singing by revelation you're singing by faith amen and every son of god amen has to make that trip by faith to calvary amen and kneel at the cross and be sorry for their sins and amen place their hands by faith on that sacrifice in the old testament they brought a lamb and that worshiper had to identify with their sacrifice this is my sacrifice oh blessed be the name of jesus i want to identify i want to identify just like pilate said i find no fault in him i find no fault in jesus christ hallelujah blessed be his name and when we sing about jesus we're not singing about some uh mexican girl's boyfriend named jesus we're singing about the christ jesus the anointed one the one that amen was virgin born one day behold a virgin shall conceive and the angel appeared to mary said that which can is conceived in you is of the holy ghost we don't believe it was part of the cell of the female mary and god impregnated no we believe the the seed was was god's seed and the egg and and the germ came together and it was god how's the bible saying acts was it 20 there we were amen were purchased by the blood of god amen he was the virgin born son of god that's why hell couldn't hold him that's why amen he came different than all the other sex-born creatures and man he was virgin born amen he was the son of god that blood is a pure blood amen and that's what we sing about when we sing about the blood of jesus christ we sing about jesus as christ jesus the anointed one amen that died many years ago and rose from the dead and sent out a holy ghost into the church amen to fill the church i was just thinking that testimony came back today when we were back up there at wesley's wedding and many of y'all were there i've told this testimony i'm going to tell it again and that one brother i think it was i can't remember which brother had that little baby was it tears up on his shoulder and the baby fell off and landed on the concrete floor and i think the brother was about six foot tall i can't remember who it was that had him and he dropped the baby off and he landed on his head and brother john sanger said he works in the er and picked up the baby and one eye was looking this way and one eye was looking this way he said i knew it was serious and he called the brothers together brother john mcfadden was sitting at the table with me and myself and brother zachary wallace and brother john sanger and we just came together and we laid our hands on that little baby because the bible says they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover we just prayed a prayer of faith and the bible says the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord will raise them up and we laid our hands on that little baby and prayed for that little baby and god healed that baby delivered it completely its eyes came back normal were completely normal the next morning we had a little service who was there was anybody there was at that service the next morning we had the service there in the little room and john is funny you see a paramedic like that and he's just there he's a nurse and the next morning after we had we're sitting at the meal and he's doing this and the little baby like that little baby's eyes just follow everyone is completely healed our god is a healer our god is a deliverer amen he's the same yesterday today and forever we're not serving a a dead god we're serving a living god people say i want to see a miracle you're looking at the greatest miracle that i have ever seen is i shave his face every day is a miracle amen miracle when the old nature when i pick something up and it falls down that's a nature it's natural for a something to just go to can you say amen to that and we all have a nature and it was against god it was aliens from god and god rich in mercy reached down and changed our nature oh blessed be the name of god hey man i can see somebody healed i was talking to the other day at the meetings down there that brother the boy came into the camp meeting and brother wendell martin's he couldn't walk he was a and they prayed for him and he walked out he was completely healed his mother had cancer they were going to cut her stomach out take half her stomach out and kept praying and praying and believing god and god healed her she went back to the doctor completely cancer-free or god is a healer i don't care how he does that i just want to be well i get my car gets smashed up oh come on oh god heal my car hit my car god's got an agent he's got a man that's been trained and prepared as god's agent to go and help we want to tell god how to do it like no lord i just want to be well i don't you just do it lord however you want to do it if it's through a miracle through its divine healing brother said 90 of healing is divine healing which is over time and it works but paul said the power that now works inside of you amen what was it the other day how many times i've seen little you get like i don't know what it is a growth or something on your body a prophet of god remember he tells us that in demonology if you go back brother preaches demonology spiritually and immunological demonology physically and jesus cursed the tree and he said now that's what it if you have a growth or a cancer in your body he said you don't talk to the body that lives and you talk to the life you take an animal and you you kill it you take the life out and after a while the body there and it decays so he says you get a growth or a cancer in your body he said when we pray he said we cast the devil out which is the the life of that growth and it kills it i remember the prophet god told me that and i had something on the back of my foot man it hurts so bad i remember i was in college i sat at a table this man said look god's not a healer he's not there's nothing happening no you come too late to tell me that because the night before i was so so sick i went up and said brothers just anoint me with oil and pray for me they'd done and i was sitting at a table testifying to this boy and he said oh god's not a healer i said no no i got prayed for last night and god's a healer i felt in my foot and it hurt so bad amen but he's the high priest of our profession our confession that's our subject tonight he's a high priest of your confession when you say oh i'm no good then you can't god can only undercede on what you say they say i am amen i am worth something jesus christ loves me so much he left the portals of heaven and came and died for me for god so loved daniel andes that he gave his only begotten son and if daniel anders would believe on him he would not perish but have everlasting life amen that's the way healing is you got to profess by his stripes i'm healed and then he starts interceding by his stripes he's healed by his stripes he's healed how long do you say it till you believe it so i testified to the boy and man we prayed in that thing there was a growth and the life went out of it a couple days later it just dried up and fell off my foot it was it was amazing my god's a healer so the other day i got a little growth in my hand i put my my arm and it came up and it was growth it was getting big i just put my hand on it saying lord jesus i curse the life that's in that growth just wait a couple days the life goes out of it just falls off my arm and man of god's a healer he's our deliverer greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world who was that the brother that stood up here the other day you know it's like bread you don't know where all the ingredients came from but you know you heard it right that's why it's so important whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely think on these things get away from that junk music get away from those talk shows get away from that television get away from that nonsense and feed your mind on the word of god and the prophet's message amen we're here and just hearing the brothers testifying one how's the bible says one plants another waters and god gives the increase it might make a little baby song little anne and get up here and sing a little song and something lodged down in your heart here's the way it is with me two days later after i hear a song tuesday morning i can tell you tuesday morning and saturday morning i'll wake up singing whatever special songs or whatever song we sing in church i'll just wake up on tuesday i'll start singing a song i said where did i get that song and on sunday we sung that song somewhere i mean it's a spirit your mind is is a is a garden and whatever you put in it it grows it might take a little time but after a while it grows oh that's why you say oh you know some people are strong i'm really weak so what i do is i stay away from bad influences and just stay close to good influences just stay close to the word of god just stay close to christian people just stay close to christian music get away from those people that cuss and try to pull you down just stay with those that are strong what fellowship has light with darkness amen praise the lord god is our healer he's the same yesterday today and forever how many have ever been healed amen we're testimonies i think brother frank was telling me i think he grew that much when he was healed in his was your back amen our god's a healer he healed my back we was laid down one day and my we just moved and shoveled some gravel i don't know maybe the lord wants to heal somebody tonight i've got a whole pile of notes here but god is our healer he is our deliverer it doesn't matter how it looks by faith abraham by faith noah they obtain the promises by faith faith is the substance of things but of hope for the evidence of things not ever yet seen how many came in a car tonight raise your hand here you go how do you know you're going to get home well i'm just going to go home out there and start the car well why do you even do that because you have faith you believe if god if that car started when you're at home it'll start when you get to church oh praise the lord amen and the god that healed you one time he'll heal you the next time amen it's for his glory amen i was walking the other day or just i was walking down this hill and the holy spirit was just dealing with me about that you know god is taking us through tests we just wish that man we just come to church everybody was perfect everybody smiled never went through a trial just everything was good but you know you go through tests you go through trials you go through heartache you go through pain like our little brother joseph breaking his leg and it's we when one suffers we all suffer and we go through it together when you get out the other side you have a testimony god is a healer amen maybe brother joseph will have children someday and they'll break their arm and like oh it's not the end i broke my leg amen so god help us as we go through things of life we go through it together good to see our sister here tonight brother tim's mother god bless you sister amen i was thinking about this philippians chapter two i love the word of god amen i remember the first sermon we preached when we come here in the bible says that they the man's sword clave to his hand do you remember that sermon he fought so much when they tried to lay the sword down he couldn't lay it down because his hand was so tightly gripped to his sword and that's the way we ought to be remember ephesians chapter 6 the sword of the spirit which is the word of god we ought to just hold to the word of god and hold it and hold it do i understand everything about this book i don't understand everything about it but i know the devil is defeated by the word of god the word of god will defeat the devil any place anywhere anytime amen i love the scripture you know those people they talking about the blue devil and all that and that's that's really nice but they don't tell all the story brother and talks about the man backing up and the devil got bigger and bigger and he got littler and littler and then brother you know people like hey boo and then the devil that's not all the story brother man said he reached over and got the word of god amen it's just not saying boo devil boo devil it's quoting the scripture jesus trained us it's not little boo boo boo or whatever that is in spanish i don't know what it is in spanish and you're saying these little things amen the devil doesn't care about that he wants to hear the word of god jesus said it's written it's written it's written jesus didn't argue and fuss he just quoted the scripture praise the lord philippians chapter 2. i was thinking about this verse 5 let this mind be in you which is in christ jesus this isn't just jesus this is the anointed jesus let this mind be in you who being in the form of god thought it was not robbery to be equal with god why wasn't it robbery to be equal with god because he was god great is the mystery of god was god was manifested in the flesh is that timothy 3 16 god was manifested in the flesh and he made himself of no reputation it took upon him the form of a servant so you see people always want to be served and high and lifted up they don't have the mind that was in christ the bible says let he that is great among you be your servant you see people want to be ministers the greatest way to minister is find the weakest spot and help minister at that weak place that's what ministry is it's not holding a microphone and it's ministering to the needs and the bible says let this mind be in you that was in christ and was made in the likeness of man and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore god hath all hath also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name the name of jesus christ is above the name william branham it's the name above every name people that deity spirit comes around remember brother branham when he went beyond the curtain of time he's there and he's meeting all these people what was his what was his desire when he got there he said i want to see jesus i said oh well he no he's a little higher remember that jesus is always higher he's always higher he's always hiring we want to keep him high and lift it up isaiah said i went in he said he's high and lifted up and his train filled the temple oh blessed be the name of jesus and that at the name of jesus every knee shall bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and every tongue shall confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father i was thinking about this brother adam said god came down in a blood cell not through a man but by the holy ghost in that virgin womb a tabernacle for the purpose of death was built we were thinking about this the other day brother and i we went up to sword mountain brother jeff loker and i were walking down we were talking about the messiah and how each person's got to do what they're ordained to do just after jesus you know we're talking about churches jesus when he got done with his ministry he had 12 and one of them was the devil and jesus looks at the devil how's the bible saying the devil having now entered the heart of jesus judas is carrying simon's son to betray him that's our communion service and jesus looks at this disciple and he says what you do do it quickly do it quickly so jesus and remember we talked to this about preached about seasons and he comes to this season and jesus looks at the the the the ones coming to attack him he said this is your hour and the hour of darkness it was his hour he said you know as long as i'm in the world i am the lighter world but he said now this is your hour this is your in other you play chessy like this is my move and now jesus said look it's your move it's your move i can't do anything it's your moment he tells judas hey what you're doing do it quickly do it do what you i tell people i said do whatever god leads you to do do whatever god leads you to do we so i was thinking about that jesus the bible says in acts that we're saved by the blood of god and now this blood of god is within christ but it without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sins so we have the lamb of god but unless that blood is shed we have no remission of sins oh praise the lord so he needed a judas to betray him to put him on a cross that that blood could be shed for your sins in my sense oh my isn't the plan of salvation wonderful and it all started back in genesis what is it a timeline starts this way to we're talking the other day about hebrew and they do it backwards i think the hebrew it's it's backwards but so way back in the beginning and god needed he had this great plan of redemption but he needed somebody to be the villain and now here's cain and abel and cain kills abel and god could have slain cain and it would all been over but he put a mark on him and said don't mark don't kill this man i need his seed all the way down here how the bible says he'll bruise your heel but i'll crush his head and he said don't don't kill this man because i need the serpent seed all the way you see how it's all playing out in god's plan it's all playing out you say is there a judas among the message there probably is but that's okay it just plays his part just play your part i want to play my part he said for the purpose of death it was built the seed of the woman came in order that he was be bruised to bring our salvation when the holy ghost came upon mary he was created in a womb the cell that would multiply and became the body of our lord that cell was created it was the beginning of the creation of god i think what is that john 3 16 the only begotten son adam was a created son but now as a begotten son christ he goes on to talk about he said oh how striking jehovah crying over maneuver manure power jehovah born in a manger of straw jehovah playing as a boy jehovah working in a carpenter shop jehovah washing the feet of the fishermen he said i will give you a sign god said not the sign of a white collared priesthood not the wealth the sign of wealth and power there's nothing in this sign that you would want or think suitable but it is an everlasting sign it is the greatest sign of all jehovah standing in the courtyard bruised and bleeding with thorns on his brow spit on his face mocked and said it not jehovah despised and rejected hanging naked on a cross you think about that the other day i was just meditating on upon that the shame now we put a little cloth on it for for decency but now there is the creator hanging naked on a cross publicly the romans did that to to curb uh uh the violence of an insurrection against the government and the person that was in it uh raising this insurrection they hung them on a cross naked and people went by and saw like oh i better never raise up against the governor i bet and there jesus hung in shame jehovah our savior my doesn't that just make you want to go and sit down and cry hung him on a cross and actually or the earth had a nervous breakdown the sun said i can't even shine the creation just hung the creator and the sun refused to shine and the earth had a nervous breakdown like what did man what was made in the image of god just do to the creator they hung him on a cross and the earth had a nervous breakdown what were we talking the other day about the devil believe wasn't any trembles the devil believes there's one god and he trembles as the one man said if he believed in three gods he'd have a nervous breakdown how's it say in the scripture the old testament said if there's there's one god and if there's another i know not i know not who he is i don't know who he is amen so he was bleeding hanging naked on the cross while the hypocrites jeered and dared him to come down off the cross jehovah died jehovah praying nothing happened you ever feel like that way you pray and nothing's happened you're going through something god's molding character in us god's doing something just like he did with christ then he died and that was a sign for all men now there isn't another like it and it is a great one then darkness came upon the earth they put him in a tomb there he laid there three days and three nights until the earthquake shattered the gloom of the night and he came forth jehovah came forth jehovah ascended on high jehovah returned to indwell his church jehovah came back with a mighty rushing wind and flames of fire jehovah came back to walk in the midst of his church and empower his church once more jehovah came this time to stay in his people he wanted to live in his people we were talking to someone the other day and it's really inspiring if you try to go and you really try to witness not about the trinity about the oneness of the godhead and god the father was above the people and all that was in christ he poor god he poured into christ and all that christ was he poured into a his church and when you say i am filled with the holy ghost what are you saying what are you saying you're saying the great almighty spirit of god that created the heavens and the earth in the beginning god created the heaven earth and now he lives inside of a people oh praise his name amen that ought to just just cause your backbone just to stiffen up and say thank you lord jesus not by works of righteousness that we have done amen that's our subject tonight consider christ jesus consider he that is in you brother and preaches a message uh he that is in you identifies the first uh identification of the of the third pull and the five identifications of the fish down on dale hollow where we go down at the lake and the fish that was resurrection and hatty right and the storm stop and the tumor and the creation of the squirrels and the five identifications of the of the third pool i know some of my brothers they get out uh you know and they get it you know say speak the word and a lot of that stuff but you got to remember brother bannon was there and the angel came to him he said what do you mean he said i don't need anything he said what are you doing he said i'm hunting he said well why don't you speak to the squirrel he speaks to the squirrel he was going remember the storm he that is in you if you're missing he was going down he told us hey get out of the storm you'll die and he's going out running out of the storm and the voice speaks to him go back into the storm it wasn't william branham coming up with this stuff hey i think i'll do this and speak in elk here and my water bill is gone and not no the angel came to him and told him what to speak even with his wife said speak it and it will be it's not just man running out induced god jesus said i can do nothing but what the father shows me and god is bringing us through that time because most of us probably all of us would speak all of our trials out of out of existence think of what you're going through right now and god give anything like oh let this brother in the church just be gone this lord poof but the bible says your trials are more precious than gold they're to try you and bring forth the character of christ in you may god help us not to speak our trials out of existence amen i was thinking about that the gospel of christ it's a finished work on calvary go to first john chapter after um first john chapter one i'm gonna use brother reginald searle's illustration our sister marlene's father he came to our church i was just a young man this is probably 25 years ago this is how powerful the preaching of the gospel is when you open up your mind your womb and someone can say something and point you to scripture and brand you we call it branding in the business world and he branded us and i was going to do it tonight but i don't know that we can because there's not a way and i didn't figure out how to turn the lights off first john chapter 1 and verse number 7. the bible says if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin does your bible say all it says all sins so brother reginald was at our church it's probably been 25 maybe 30 years ago and he turned all the lights out we're in a little storefront mission and he got a little flashlight and he held it over his head and he just walked like this i remember him walking like this and he quoted the scripture he said if we walk in the light as he is in the light he said we have fellowship one with another so we know that the light is the word of god and if we lo walk in the light of the word remember david said thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light into my pathway and if we walk in the light of god's word we have fellowship with god do you believe that we have fellowship with god but when you start cussing you don't walk in the light because the bible says let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth so when you when you lie the bible says lie not one to another then you're not walking in the light and you have no fellowship with god we could go down the list and let the holy spirit just say to you what the light is and maybe you're not walking in the light in the holy spirit he says i'm illuminating but you're away from me you don't have fellowship with me if we walk in the light we have fellowship and the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sin when we're walking in the light of the word of god because when the light illuminates us and he says oh i'm going to cheat on my taxes well you're not walking in the light you're stealing render unto caesar that which is caesar's provide things honest before all men and then you say lord jesus forgive me and whatever you got to do to make it right then you walk back in the light you have fellowship with god again and the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sins isn't that a good verse it's a good illustration i wish i had the flashlight in the lights we'd do the whole thing but it's it's a wonderful scripture and then i was thinking over in john we read this the other day saint john don't you love the word of god amen i don't want to be a part of a movement that's just a feel-good thing i want to know what we believe comes from the scripture and if we're anchored to the scripture there's nothing that can shake you off the word of god amen you can take my bible from me but i've already had the word of god in my heart that i would not sin against god that was david i think right you can lock me away in the prison but i know if i walk in the light as he is in the light the blood of jesus christ we have fellowship and the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sin and you know the two verses behind that 9-1-1 right that was the one right behind that 9-1-1 backwards first john 1 9 if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us of our sins you can take my bible but you'll never take the word of god out of my heart you'll never take it out of my heart what is the only sin unbelief david said thy word have i hid in my heart that i won't disbelieve against god amen drop that piece of paper again you better read it and when you're filled with the spirit here's one of the best signs i know you're so in love with christ and believe every word that he says to be the truth see that's the evidence that you have the holy ghost and your life's full of joy and oh my everything's different see than it used to be that's the holy ghost that's the holy ghost we want in our life love christ with all of our heart and believe all of his word amen that's fell out of my bible twice for a reason i've told one day i'm going to preach the things in my bible and all the things that i have in here brother iran says this in the message love nothing but lost souls is the only thing that's got any value in it money passes away houses decay and go away everything in the world moves away the only value lasting value i'd rather have one soul in glory that i want to christ to know and to see that light of god circling around that soul through all eternity my name to be associated with that then to have every penny of money in the whole world because i'd have to lose it all but when you send it up there is eternal what you send up there is eternal and that's the reason we're trying that's the reason we're trying i don't understand it brother and said somehow your name will be associated with that soul for all of eternity i don't know if their crown will have your name in it but he said somehow you whoever the bible says he that went to souls is wise and somehow you'll be associated with that soul for all of eternity one soul is worth 10 million worlds you see i am easily influenced so i keep that in my bible and that reminds me when the devil comes and says ah no i just keep it there one soul amen he said that's why we're trying first first or saint john chapter three we're talking about walking in the light as he is in the light john 3 16 we read this the other day we want to go down to verse 19. john 3 19 and this is the condemnation that light is coming to the world and men loved darkness they had an affection they just craved darkness so what your bible says they love darkness rather than light why because their deeds were evil their action actually their very nature was dark and their very nature was evil but he that doth verse 20 and everyone that doeth evil hateth the light jesus said don't worry if they hated me they're going to hate you don't think everybody's he said actually beware when everybody speaks well of you sometimes that when you're with unbelievers and everybody speaks well if you're not shining your light bright enough you're not showing your purpose great enough everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light why lest his deeds should be reproved i was reading this book the brother put together some a book of of a subject of just on spirits and brother battery comes as a deserve he said nobody move around he said because you all come to me like waves spirits and he said here's an unbeliever there's a believer and he's just trying to he said when i talked to you he said i'm talking to your spirit not your body he said i'm trying to contact your spirit and that's what he's saying here he's people don't want to come to the light because their deeds are reproved so when you get by one you've got long hair and you're a sister you just walk in and you don't say anything and you're a light to them and it brings conviction on them so don't feel bad when they want to get away from you don't get a complex like no just you know praise the lord he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds maybe may manifest that they are wrought in god amen may god help us i'm going to skip over some of this just for the sake of time let's go to romans chapter 8 verse 28 this should be one of the scriptures that you've hid in your heart this is one of the most basic ones in the bible but sometimes we just pass over it as just something we say this is one of those we know verses starts it out verse romans 8 28 and we know now paul is talking to the romans they were heathens but they got to the place that he said hey we know this i wonder if we know this you know before we were talking about people being babes in christ and they should have grown up and been teachers paul said i've come to you i'm i'm amazed when you should be a teacher and you're just a babe you don't even have the fundamentals of christianity and paul comes to the place and says we know this we know that all things does your bible say all right now some of us believe that the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sins and we'll believe that but we can't believe this all lord i just can't believe that what's the rest of that say all things work together for good not to everybody it's to them that love god so the main thing is love god and then you know that everything that happens to you is working together for your good everything is working together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose and then he goes on that's where we stop sometimes but he goes on to say for whom he did for no he also did predestinate and that's where a lot of people stop right there oh i'm predestinated i'm predestined and this is the thing that really bothers me around our message this is what really gets me in trouble because i press people and they say oh i'm predestinated but that's not what the bible says you're predestinated to what you're predestinated to be conformed to the image of his dear son so what is the image of his dear son in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god so you say you're predestinated but they talk well i'm a predestinated seed but god never did predestinate seeds to stay in the packet he extended except a corner wheat buy a a die and go into the ground it abides alone it's just a pack on the that's a nice potentially that has potential made in the image but now it has to fall in the ground remember our sermon you must be born again he that is not born of water and of spirit washed by the water the land interprets that water washed by the water people don't want to be washed by the water of the word they say oh lord forgive me of my sins but they refuse to be washed by the water of the word and that's what the bible says here to be conformed to the image of his dear son and that's the troubling thing as we come closer and we've been in the message for 20 30 40 years sometimes somebody coming just come in we baptize and we expect them to be a child but now we've been in the message for 20 30 40 years and you're should be a teacher should be conforming to the image and we see worldliness and things of the world because let me just stop right here everybody's predestinated pharaoh was predestinated judas was predestinated so don't get by with the predestination thing right here it is predestinated to be conformed to his image lord help us tonight if we don't have the image of his dear son say lord jesus christ help me lord lord conform me today how's he say romans 12 be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of our mind lord renew my mind lord renew my mind why was it ephesians i just want to go to ephesians here those great words of predestination i was meditating on that ephesians 1 this morning ephesians 1 5. the bible says back to 4 ephesians 1 4 according as he this is god hath chosen us in in him before the foundation of the world oh i love that verse oh isn't that a wonderful verse go over to romans what is it revelations 13 8 and and 17 8 having written their names in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world oh it's just we could just run and shout in glory i love the subject of predestination chosen in him before the foundation but that's not all of it that we should be holy oh my goodness there's more to just being predestinated that we he's predestined and we might be holy others we know that there's none of us righteous no no the best we can do is this filthy rags but our only perfection comes through jesus christ i'd love to preach hebrews chapter 10 right here for by one sacrifice hath he perfected forever them that are sanctified that's a whole other sermon hebrews chapter 10 one of my favorite chapters in the bible he hath perfected us through jesus christ and we're holy through christ that we holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption you go back and he do the hebrew saying not a child anymore but now adoption which is hey whatever daddy says get a pen i got a pen here somewhere and he gives you the pen says all right brother matt here's the checkbook i'm leaving whatever you think we need you just sign the checkin and he's coming to manhood adoption he's predestinated us unto that place of adoption remember jesus come to the place and voice came from heaven this is my beloved son hear him hear him my goodness so many things go through my mind right here you know paul tells timothy i don't i can't remember he said let no man despise thy youth but in other words if you're five years old or seven and god gives don't let anybody like your kid no but then there's a qualification that comes with that but be thou an example of the believer i would like to preach over there what is it hebrews or titus or timothy one of them there he tells the the young man he said be sober be vigilant and be thou up have a pattern of good works isn't this sobering we're reading the scripture i don't know i'm not running the run shout jumping all the way but now we're actually seeing from the scripture brother daniel you're predestinated but you're predestinated to be conformed to his image you're predestinated unto adoption and a young man you should be sober and have a pattern of good works you all probably done this before what is a pattern it's when you take your hand and you do you have done this in school or somewhere hopefully not on the wall and you make a pattern and you say just cut that out and it'll match my hand and paul is telling us you be the pattern that other people come paul told timothy look you just follow me as i follow christ that's what we're predestinated it's sobering it's like and we were at camp we were at um not byc we're at brother ron's camp and they had one of these uh they had one of these a-frame buildings some of you all been there and it goes all down it's like five three foot off the ground and i told the kids i said you know what keeps me from climbing up there and running up the top and running down the other side there's this one scripture in the bible that keeps me from doing that the bible says be thou a pattern of good works because if i do it everybody else is gonna follow me and do the same thing so you got to see you realize you know the bible tells me that i got to have a pattern of good works i don't want to i don't want the bible telling me what to do then you can't be a christian and jesus is not going to ask you to do something that he couldn't do they brought him the bible says he was led as a lamb to the slaughter that's one thing but there was another verse says and he opened not his mouth so when they say tell us who hit you tell you tell us who hit you there was a verse in isaiah that said he couldn't open his mouth see look let's not you committed adultery and you did this this this and he knew it he could have done it and he was bound by the scripture and he didn't asking you to do anything that he wasn't bound by oh lord help us you know it's just some feel good religion bring us some coffee and how much cream you want your coffee hey now take it into church have a good time hey god bless you no we're actually seeing that i've got to be the image of this dear son of amen may god help us go on here where were we romans chapter 8 this preaching isn't very popular is it i'll never win any popularity contest but that's not my goal my goal is if god calls me to be a minister of the gospel of jesus christ i have a responsibility to minister the word of god not my own ideas from the scripture he goes on to say conform to his image that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called you feel called tonight you're in a church and something calls you if he predestined he's going to call you somewhere you get a call from god and whom he called them he also justified what is justification it's just as if you never did it the full revelation it's just this now that'll make us shout and run the isles you sin you confess it to god he puts it in the sea of his gift forgiveness he doesn't even see it anymore it's white as snow the devil comes up he's the accuser of the brother hey do you know what your child did let me look let me look no i don't think so white of snow didn't do it didn't do it but he didn't do it he didn't no he didn't he confessed his sins amen i love the word of god justified in them that he justified he also glorified what shall we say to these things if god before us who could ever be against us isn't that a wonderful verse if god before us who could ever be against us so many other things i'm going to skip over for the sake of time brother uh brother nate dougal asked that we send some verses on salvation i got the whole romans road kind of goes through salvation there and then he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and remember the philip the bible says he was transformed trans uh from samaria he went and he met the eunuch he got and he said he preached unto him jesus we got all done preaching jesus the philips the the eunuch said hey here's water what does hinder us so if you're going to preach jesus somewhere water baptism has got to be in there mark 16 16 he that believeth in is baptized shall be saved amen i was thinking about that not only that repent and be baptized and you shall be filled with the holy ghost amen i say we consider him so many things here i just feel for the sake of time that we're going to pass over i say we consider him for our salvation we consider him tonight for whatever you're going through consider the lord jesus this isn't the end amen your trials didn't come to destroy us it came to make us stronger amen it came to to believe in the lord for salvation i was thinking you take your boys out and you get out in the mud and you know you get along the road you get a flat tire somewhere 20 uh you're miles back in the bush you sit down your friend what are we going to do what are you going to do somebody walks along and said have you ever considered your spare tire oh yeah salvation where you put the spare tire on you go out i mean that's the way mankind was we were sitting along the road one day as sinners with no way to help her and god rich in mercy came by and picked us up i say we consider him in our own lives within considering for others amen born in sin shaped in iniquity but christ came and changed our life what about life after death so many people are selling these books life after death i said why don't you just get read a book that somebody had to experience in life after death jesus he said no man takes my life from me i lay it down i have power to lay it down i power to take it up and then he went on to say because i live you can live also you can live also oh there's so many blessings to be a christian one day here a few months ago i was we were selling roofs and i this man had a roof problem and i went over there just when i drove up started pouring down raining just pouring down so i had an umbrella here's the man's house he has an open garage there i get the umbrella out i'm like hey how you doing it's raining i'm like oh and we run over to the garage and now it's pouring down raining and i'm standing in the garage with this man as we're standing there just a minute we start talking about the the things and then he starts talking about death okay lord that's why we're here we're here because of this he starts talking he said you know i'm a pretty good person i but i said i feared death i see and he believed in reincarnation he said i i'm afraid because i've been a good person in life but i'm afraid i'll come back as another person and i'll pray i'm afraid that person will be evil and it'll be and so he just began to talk to him about the lord and how that is appointed unto man wants to die and christ died and rose again and he said because i live you can live also he said jesus said you know i'm going to go and prepare a place for you and this man he was really worried i might come back as an aunt or i might come back as a tarantula or i might come back as a bird and he was just really worried but jesus said i am going to go away and i'm going to come again and receive you unto myself that where i am you can be also i believe that what is that saint john 14 or 15 right in there he said i'm going to prepare a place for you i mean you might not have anything in this life but jesus is going to prepare a place for the believer and i began to talk about that i was thinking over in revelation just a couple more verses revelations chapter 21 all these promises of god i love the scripture amen you might not have anything in life but if you have jesus christ you have everything you have the promises of god the bible says faith is a substance of things hoped for it's a substance i'd like to preach hebrews chapter 11 right here but these verses revelations chapter 21 verse 3 and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he shall dwell with them do you believe the word of god do you believe god's going to dwell with you brother man said he'll walk out to that marriage supper maybe thousands of miles long he'll walk down and he'll he'll wipe the tears from your eyes with those nail-scarred hands of five precious wounds only thing made in heaven the five precious wounds he goes on to say god will be with them and he shall dwell be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and god shall wipe away all of their tears you don't have to say if you cry sometimes your tears might be of your heart your heart's weeping sometimes it's expressed in your your eyes but the bible says he'll wipe away all your the tears from your eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow oh isn't that a good verse i've got a promise there's a deep calling to the deep there'll be no more sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away he that sat upon their own throne said behold i make all things new it's all going to be new i've never had a new house i've never had a new car but jesus said i'm going i'm making everything new oh man i'm looking for a new body hey man i'm looking for a new body there won't be as you get older and older there'll be no surprise when your body changes i mean some of these young men are right in their prime and they're young and get their body and they get changed and you know they hey i'm 21 i'm 21. yeah but now this body i can walk through a wall bible says it does not appear what we shall be but we know when he shall appear we shall be like him and he ate the fish remember he appeared and he ate the fish and then he walked back through the wall as i said before the wall the the fish didn't hit the wall and slide down the wall somehow the fish became a part of that body oh praise god the bible says i have not seen ear had not heard it's neither entered into the heart of men the things that god has in store for them that believe and he says right here all things will be made new and he said to me right for these things are true and faithful i mean sometimes people pick up a book and they read it like oh that was just fiction was a bunch of nonsense why don't you read something that's true amen something that's faithful something that will help you praise the lord life after death amen i want a new body let's consider him as we just come to a close considering maybe for your healing brother rem said this he said that's then what about healing for the sick greater is he that is in you than the sickness because that's an interruption interrupting the very laws of god sicknesses so god has health and he has life and so what is sickness it's an interruption of god's program and he said well the greater is he that is in you that's the healer and the creator than the devil that's interrupting the very program of god in your life greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world i say lord you're greater now the first thing you've got to come on god's side some people like lord heal me are you a christian first because healing is the is the children's bread but if you're not on the lord's side then god has no obligation to you so the main thing is come over god may be using that to sickness to drive you to the place that you'll surrender to god and then when you surrender to god then god will clear up that sickness and all things are starting to work together for good to them that love god amen let's consider him life after death i tell this little story my grandmother was passing and i remember we went into her room and she was laying there and the bed and my grandfather already passed away and so she was laying there and she she was fading in and out of consciousness and she came to and she said you're talking a little bit she said i saw grandpa i was like oh you wonder you know what they're seeing and this and so my grandfather died he had black hair and turned gray had gray in it so i asked her i believe i'm bringing in a new body right the bible says it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know when we he we shall see him we shall be like him how's the bible say if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we already have one waiting for it we just step over into that new body so i asked my grandmother she's laying there and i said grandma you said you saw grandfather she said yeah i said did he have gray hair or did he have black hair she said oh no he had black hair he was young again amen they get to that place and they stand in that little remember brother the ram goes beyond the curtain time he said i was standing in that little slanted place he said i looked there and saw my body he said i looked here and i saw millions and millions of believers running and new bodies and coming just in a little slanted place just in a little slanted place amen let's consider him today let's not be enticed by the things of the world and pulled aside and let something steal your faith we sing a little song back home don't let nobody steal your joy don't let anybody steal you don't let any situation don't like church problem family problem don't let it steal your joy the joy of the lord is our strength amen for for maybe you've got a financial need i say tonight consider jesus christ philippians 4 19 says but my god shall supply all of your needs according to his riches and glory maybe you're going to make a career move the bible says the footsteps of the righteous they're ordered by god they're ordered by god and everything all things work together for good to them that love god i was thinking about psalms 37 23 it says the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall is anybody falling you don't have to raise your hand we all have made mistakes though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand there's peter he's going through a stormy time and and and jesus come be not afraid it is i be not injured peter said lord let you bid me come and what was jesus saying okay come walk a supernatural life come walk us through and peter steps out of the boat and starts walking a supernatural life which is what all of us are doing it's not natural for you to have a desire and lady you'll see it should be lukewarm and you just stayed home like the coffee it just becomes lukewarm but tonight you've desired to come in the house of the lord and not listen to a patty cake preacher but somebody that's cutting us by the word of god making a masterpiece and we're making ourselves ready and you're living a supernatural life whether you realize it or not and then peter got to looking around and and he got fearful and he got afraid and he started sinking but what did he do what all sons and daughters he said lord save me lord save me and jesus said no peter you should have made it you shouldn't even start it if you don't any man that's not willing to to what do you say count the cost and you just got your eyes on the world and you're seeking you deserve it no peter said lord save me and jesus did a second work in his life reached and got his hand and pulled him back up and the bible says and they both walk back to the ship they both started walking a supernatural life back to the ship you might feel like you're sinking feel like it's all falling apart just say lord save me consider him tonight whatever we're going through how many times i've been to a service a young person walk up and say hey this was my last night i was done i'm so done with this but god spoke to me fear not it is i it's speaking to us something how's the bible say hide that word in your heart he said when you walk it'll speak to you amen it'll speak to you it'll speak and it'll speak when you go home and keep speaking and speaking and it's the word of god proverbs 3 5 trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not to thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him or consider him and he shall direct thy path amen he'll direct our paths i want to consider him in everything that i do don't you every situation i want my lips to say lord your lord amen after musicians will come i wonder if we could sing that song every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that jesus christ is lord some men will wait till then they'll curse god deny there is a god they might say well then a lot of atheists live but there's never been an atheist die an atheist somewhere when they start going through that chasm they oh god oh god amen i want to get to the place that i can call him lord that's your desire tonight amen let's just sing this little song sing it to the lord prayerfully [Music] is risen from

between god and man lord let that relationship be further lord it has nothing to do with me father it has to do with the word of god reaching to the hearts of your children and then responding to it i pray that you would help us lord as the holy spirit is so specific lord he goes down in our lives and he starts touching things so you were conf predestinated be conformed to the image of the word and

provide a way make a way i like that i look it up it's create you'll create a way amen when daniel got to a place he said we're gonna throw you into those lions then god created this thing called the pillar of fire that came down there with him and he made a way that daniel could live and when they got to a famine one day and elijah was going to die and he said look i got some ravens over here going to bring you some cook sandwiches god made a way moses out there with 2 million people pharaoh coming it's kind of like your mortgage and there's things on this side you can't get around it and this and this and then god creates a way where there was no way oh how many times i've seen him do it situations come up but tell my wife say i see no way through this i see no way a couple weeks

way i believe it he always makes a way amen god bless you ask brother aaron if you'll dismiss us in prayer tonight [Music] let's bow our hands lord we just so appreciate your word today so lord we we can be forgetful or maybe just not pay attention sometimes and get caught up with the situation or to just help us to take a moment and say no it's god it's with us it's god's word that we turn to lord sometimes we get to going and doing things and how did i get here lord but help us to quickly turn back and say lord like peter save me lord when we realize that we can't do it on our own but i
