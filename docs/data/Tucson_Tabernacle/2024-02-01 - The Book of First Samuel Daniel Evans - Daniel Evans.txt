you welcome brother I don't know your name behind the coffee family there what what's your name Mike Gibson Brother Mike God bless you welcome it's good to have you in service I think uh I got all the visitors I um the the prayer requests there was many they were talking about cancer and what a what an evil demon that cancer is one day the bride of Christ will sit at judgment and judge that demon and cast that demon to the place that it deserves to go how many people has that demon tormented over the years that is the one sickness when brother brandom received his commission there at Greens Mill that angel came to him and he said if you can get the people to believe you and be sincere when you pray then nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer and he singled that he singled that one disease out because it is a horrible disease and I'll tell you what there was many times that that disease got cast out and brother bram's and during his ministry and during his prayer lines and the same God that William brandham served is the same God that we serve and he's a he's a healing God he's the great physician and he is on the scene today and now we claim those we claim those healings we know that he can do it we know that he's done it and now Lord we just place it into your hands as was done earlier and we trust that all will be well in according to his his word we um appreciate I watched brother Ryan's sermon last night I think he did a really nice job I I really appreciate all that he said I really I really love that that young man he's he's got a calling in his life and and I often kid his Pastor um brother Steve Robson that uh I'm recruiting and um we uh we're going to make a deal to get him to come down here permanently and brother Steve fights me on that I don't know why um we we had a nice time when we went to Los Cruses um it was uh they're really sweet people there and uh brother Caleb has been a good close friend to me for a while now um they've really supported us here at the Tucson Tabernacle and I always want to do the same to them and uh going there it's nice but I'll tell you in ministering to the Believers there I it's not the same I just I love them and they they really love me especially to the youth and they're just they're just a a wonderful group of people but whenever I'm gone I just long to come back home and see these precious people in this audience and just see what the Lord's doing here and my place is here this is where I need to be Brother Martin your place is around all over the place all over the world but my spot is right here in in serving you people I think probably the highlight of my trip was the time I got to spend with brother Josiah and sister Katie on the drive and the numer family the Taylor stit family fryo uh kids it was just and uh sister Gracie your your son Eric what a what a good boy it is just really um really nice being with him and I tell you what they they play basketball when we got there and you know the kids walked out and there was this hush and all this sister Grace's son brother Eric he's like 6'5 and and I mean there's a great basketball player and they're like whoa Tucson Tabernacle has this professional basketball player so so I think he had a really good time since gra we we all had a good time but um brother Josiah and were talking on the way there and I was telling brother Josiah really about the vision that I have for this church and really what I think is the most important there's many churches around the world there's and and every church has a different Spirit not one really any better than the other I never want to compare them but with the Tucson Tabernacle is not a place that I think that especially here tonight brother Joel the pillars in the church seem to be more visible on Wednesday night it's really the a lot of the people that really put their shoulders to the wheel and really work hard and the Tucson Tabernacle I was telling brother Josiah it's not a place that you just come and sit back and hear how great you are and hear how much better you than you are than the denominations or or how you are the elect and you're you're God's chosen people and all that we hear that but you come here to the Tucson Tabernacle to have a Ministry yeah you are here to serve and to work and to go out and bring people to Jesus Christ and to make a difference in the world this is not the place to come and sit back and hear how great you are you are great I believe you're the greatest in the world okay I said it I'm not gonna say it anymore I'm just kidding you are a great people but there is so much work to be done brother Josiah gave me a scripture out of 1 Samuel before we get started I want to read it brother Jordan it's 1st Samuel chapter 22 verse 1 and I thought and I know brother Josiah was thinking the same thing when he gave it to me just now back there I believe this is part of the ministry that we have here at the Tabernacle it says this David therefore departed then and escaped to the cave agela and when his Brethren and his father and all his father's house heard it they went down tither to him and everyone that was into distress and everyone that was in debt and everyone that was discontented gathered themselves unto him and he became a captain over them and there were with him about 400 men and let me tell you those 400 did things that they went through the fire with David they did great things and they didn't lose a battle they they overcame great odds and that's what we should be here at the Tabernacle there are many people to serve there is a lot to do and never be afraid make a step brother Joel make a step go and if you fail you fail it's okay but try do everything that you can so this book this is our Wednesday night bible study it's not a normal service this is where we're going to go through every book of the Bible from Genesis and we'll go through at least the Old Testament all the way to Malachi we're in 1 Samuel now we just got through with the Book of Judges and Ruth now this book of Samuel is right after the Book of Judges some even say that Samuel was the last judge so after Israel was re rescued from Egypt by God they were brought into the promised land with Moses brought up to the Jordan River and then over with Joshua Israel was supposed to be obedient to God and follow his Commandments but Moses had died before they went into the promised land they went over then Joshua LED them he later dies and all that knew Joshua had died the Book of Judges can be summed up in this statement every man did that which was right in his own eyes basically there was very very poor leadership in the land of Israel at that time and it showed the importance of wise and godly leadership everywhere the books of first and first and 2 Samuel show what can happen with good leadership the book is a transition basically from the very lowest time in Israel's history to the very best time in the reign of King David and King Solomon and it's it's a history that goes through this transitional time and this man Samuel plays the pivotal part in taking them from the depths of sin into fellowship with God now there are four main characters in the book in this book of 1 Samuel there's Eli the priest there's Samuel the prophet there's Saul the king and then towards the end there's David and David is the answer to the question about good strong Godly leadership so it starts with a couple Hannah and her husband Elena Hannah was a tremendous sister she was a very f faithful lady a prayerful lady eleno was a good husband always encouraging his wife the problem is El that Hannah couldn't have children so Hannah was made fun of by by the elen's other wife and and she was just she wasn't treated right Elena loved her he even told her one time he said he said he said honey he says am I not better than 10 Sons just trying to make his wife know that that he loved her even though she couldn't give him children verse number 11 chapter 1 and Hannah vow a vow and said oh lord of hosts if thou will indeed look on the Affliction of thine handmade and remember me and not forget thine handmade but will give unto thine handm made a Manchild then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head so Samuel like Samson had a Nazarite vow from his birth and it came to pass as she continued praying before the Lord that Eli marked her mouth so Eli noticed her mouth moving now Hannah she spake in her heart only her lips moved but her voice was not heard therefore Eli thought she had been drunken so she's praying and she's just mouthing the words and the priest seesar and he says this isn't normal that she must she must be drinking but really what was happening is she was in prayer and and praying to the Lord my friends sister Patricia God bless you it's good it's good to see you welcome my friends um we had a uh sister Patricia and the the fros and I had a little bible study the other day and it's good to have you sis in the family I'm looking forward to meeting your husband back there God bless you we're talking about this book of 1 Samuel and we're talking about we we just started and this sister this lady named Hannah couldn't have children and she's praying at the altar and it came to pass as she continued praying before the Lord that Eli marked her mouth now Hannah she spake in her heart only her lips moved but her voice was not heard therefore Eli thought she had been drunken and Eli said unto her how long will thou be drunken put away thy wine from thee and Hannah answered and said no my Lord I am a woman of sorrowful spirit I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have poured out my soul before the Lord she's just crying out Lord give me a baby I I just every everything that I have Lord It's just poured out before you count not thine handmade for a daughter of bile for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hither to that word bile it basically means worthless so she saying here don't regard your servant as a worthless woman then Eli and Eli is the priest Eli answered and said go in peace and the god of Israel Grant thee thy petition that thou Hast asked of him and she said let thine hand made find Grace in thy sight so the woman went her way and did eat and her countenance was no more sad look at the faith of Hannah so she was praying there and just the words of the priest when he said sister receive what you're asking for so she gets up and she remembers what the priest said and she has faith in her prayer so she gets up and she's feeling good and not sad anymore and her faith was raised up and now she is going to receive her prayer so who is this priest that said those words to Hannah this man Eli now remember as I said we're freshly out of the Book of Judges where every man did what was right in his own eyes and there was no strong leadership in Israel which allowed sin to just freely spread not only through the country but right here in the Pulpit through Eli's Sons so Hannah has her child she names him Samuel thus we have the book the name of the book 1 Samuel now first 1 and 2 Samuel let me stop right there first and 2 Samuel they're actually one book they were all written in one big long scroll and the reason that they're split into two is simply because they were too long so they were split into two separate books in 1 and 2 Samuel but they were actually originally written as one so remember there was no strong leadership in Israel and this resulted in sin so whatever you wanted to do you did it without receiving any correction from the church any any correction from the government or anyone else it was just a really bad time in Israel and at this time God is angry with the sons of Eli he's angry with the sons of this priest and his sons are also priests and God calls these men the sons of bile worthless Sons so God is calling the the young men the priests worthless and Hannah saying Lord Eli don't don't call me worthless so why were they worthless these priests these young men they would take the choice cuts of meat so they would bring in the offering the burnt offering to the priests and they would give this this meat for a burnt offering on the altar as we've learned from previous Bible studies what these burnt offerings were about so they would bring these offerings in and these priests they take the prime rib and the T-Bones and whatever the good cuts of meat were and they would bring them home with them not only that but they would take the money from the church and use it for their own personal gain and further they use their positions as priests to sleep with the young women that would come in to the sanctuary sinful but it's a carryover remember from This Book of Judges and things are about to change do this baby that's going to be born so a man of God comes to Eli remember Eli's kids Eli's Sons were these priests so a man of God comes to Eli and he prophesies this in in um 1st Samuel chapter 2:35 so this man comes to Eli speaking on behalf of the Lord and he says and I will raise me up a faithful priest that shall do according to that which is in thine heart in mine heart and in my mind and I will build him a sure house and he shall walk before my anointed forever that faithful priest was a young boy at the time and his name was Samuel and he would be one of the greatest prophets that has ever lived one of the greatest prophets in this Bible so after Hannah had given her son to the work of the Lord remember she promised that I give my son to to the the priest I I'll give him to the work of the Lord so he was trained under this man Eli and one night the young boy was laying down in the temple of the Lord where the ark was now the ark this is the same Ark that Moses built is just this wooden box is about 45 in Long long 25 in high 25 in wide there was Mana that had fallen from Heaven remember when they were wandering in the wilderness there was Mana that had fallen from Heaven inside of this Ark The Ten Commandments were in there and Aaron's Rod that had budded and bore almonds was also in there this is the ark that went before the Israelites and caused them to win the battles in the Book of Joshua this is the ark that went before the priests when they came up to the Jordan River and they were going to go across when the water dried up this is the ark that went before them and the priests walked into the river and they walked across on dry land while carrying this Ark this Ark was a big deal this is the ark Where They Carried around the walls of Jericho and these of this great walled City and the walls fell down when they blew the trumpets this is the ark and here is this young boy Samuel and he is sleeping near this Ark young Samuel was in the room and a voice called him said Samuel the boy got up and he went to Eli the priest and he says here I am he said you call me Eli said go back to bed I didn't call you then again a voice calls him Eli it says Samuel he goes back and he says here I am Eli he said you call me and he said go back to bed I didn't call you then it happens again a third time Eli was a man of God he understood these things and he understood that God was calling the young man so he says if this says if this calls you again then say Speak Lord for your servant heares now remember this is a little boy this man s this young man Samuel so God spoke to Samuel again and this started a relationship this is the first time that God had spoken to Samuel this started a relationship between God and His Prophet that really that the world had not seen since Moses from then on Samuel the the young boy would hear this voice of God and move forward and as Samuel grew he rose to the most prominent leader in all of Israel he provided strong leadership remember the leadership that was missing when everybody did which was right in their own eyes in J in judges well this man Samuel Rose and he provided good moral leadership for the Israelites then so the Israelites went to battle against the Philistines the Philistines are mentioned in the Book of Judges and they seem to be the most powerful force in the area at this time and right now they can be considered at this time they could be considered Israel's biggest enemy so they lose the battle and without praying or considering what they were doing they go to Shiloh where Eli was and they take the ark because they knew what had happened when this Ark goes before you they the Israelites take the ark and now they're going to go back to battle so remember the sons of Eli these worthless Sons they're still priests and they go with the ark so they go into the B they go into battle and the F Philistines end up capturing the ark bad bad deal that was that was that was not a good time this is the Arc of the Covenant I described what it was before so Eli who is now 98 years old and when when this this battle and when when these Philistines had captured the ark they also killed Eli's Sons so Eli who is now 98 years old and blind and fat the Bible says he's sitting in his chair and he's worried about this Ark and he's worried about the Battle and a messenger comes to Eli and tells him that Israel has lost the battle tens of thousands are dead and his two sons were killed buil but it was the last news that made the difference that the Ark of God had been captured by the Philistines when Eli heard this the 98-year old man fell backwards in his chair he hit the floor broke his neck and was dead and that's the closing of the chapter of this for this priest Eli so God ends up bringing curses so they take these Philistines they take this Ark and they put it next to to their God dagging in the same room so the next day they put it in there the next day this God dagin had fell down so they they set him back up and then they come back in the next day and he had fallen down again but this time his head was broken off and his head his hands were broken off so it scared it scared the Philistines to death because it's like okay well this is beating Our God so then they started to get sick many died tumors came on the people so they ended up bringing the ark back to Israel they got to get rid of this thing and they brought gifts with the ark you know what they brought you know what happened to them they got tumors and stuff they brought back five golden tors and then five golden mice so Samuel grows and Samuel leads Israel decades pass Samuel as I said before he provides strong leadership he provide he brings morality and repentance to Israel and he wins the confidence of the country through both his integrity and his relationship with the Lord this power and Leadership produced peace in Israel and the country was strong in military might and strong in in the spirit of the Lord so as Samuel Grew Older he started placing his sons in prominent positions now remember Eli Samuel's Sons were also not moral men and the people saw this and they saw how Samuel started to get older and it worried them that they were going that Samuel was going to pass away and they were going to be ruled by his sons so the people see the other countries around them how they have Kings and they go to Samuel and they asked him to find them a king to rule over them like the other countries had now remember there had never been a legitimate king in Israel so Israel they had never had a king and they always had a man of God who would speak on behalf of God and Lead but rejected that system now and they wanted to be like the other countries and this really grieved Samuel so Samuel he thought that they were rejecting him and they thought he thought that they were rejecting his leadership so you can see both sides right here put yourself in Samuel's position he's like hey he says have not I led you right and have not I been moral and did I ever take any your any of your money or anything like that and they're like no Samuel we love you but you're old man man you're getting old and your kids they're not you they don't have the character that you have so put your your um self in the people's shoes they're like what are we going to do when Samuel passes away the people were wrong in this but I can understand why that they said that so God tells Samuel to warn the people that they are going to regret this choice and they are going to get their King but this king is going to be about himself and he's not going to be concerned with your well-being and you're going to suffer and believe me they did regret this decision 1st Samuel chapter 8: 19 it says this nevertheless the people refused to refused to obey the voice of Samuel and they said nay but we will have a king over us that we also may be like all the other nations all the nations and that our King May judge us and go out before us and fight our battles and Samuel heard all the words of the people and he rehearsed them in the ears of the Lord so he heard what the people were saying then he goes before the Lord and he says Lord here's what the people are saying and the Lord said unto Sam said to Samuel into their voice listen to them and make them a king and Samuel said unto the men of Israel go ye every man unto his City so then God tells Samuel he says go and he says choose this rich man from The Tribe of Benjamin the best looking man in all of Israel Head and Shoulders taller than the other men the people had the wrong idea of what a leader should be they wanted a tall goodlooking strong Warrior to rep represent them to other countries and that was the desire of their heart to have a man that the world would respect rather than a man that God would respect Samuel brings all the people together to Crown Saul King and he tells them that this is your choice and you have disobeyed God 1st Samuel chapter 10 verse 24 says this and Samuel said to all the people see ye whom the Lord hath chosen that there is none like him among all the people so he's he's got Saul here and he's like look at what a great good-looking guy you have to lead you and all the people shouted and said God Save the King King then Samuel told the people the manner of kingdom and wrote it in a book and laid it up before the Lord and Samuel sent the people away every man to his house so Samuel wrote some church bylaws here he wrote maybe what we would call a constitution he said you've made your choice but here are thing how are things going to run so he put this in writing and and then Saul also went home to gibba and there went with him a band of men whose Hearts God had touched it shows that Saul's Reign started off right really as far as him as far as Saul personally and God gave him every resource that he needed but the children of bile said how shall this man save us and they despised him and brought no presence but he held his peace again worthless people and people complain you know they really do they're going to complain no matter what and here they are they got exactly what they wanted and they complained about it and right here maybe they were right brother martin but right here he says no these are worthless people the Bible says it these are worthless people that complained about that now when when I describe David I want you to notice the difference between what man would choose and what God chooses so Samuel is still upset he's hurt about the People's Choice for a king rather than God and he wants to make his point strongly so he does a miracle in front of the people so that it's a time of harvest so he he looks out and he brings down thunder and lightning and rain so the people notice that this man Samuel is bringing a miracle before us God is is with him and in 1st Samuel 12:19 all the and all the people said unto Samuel pray for thy servants unto the Lord thy God that we die not for we have added unto all our sins this evil to ask us a king 1219 is the is the scripture so do you see the repentance of the people and even though they made the wrong decision watch this God honors their humility and Samuel said unto the people fear not ye have done all this wickedness yet turn not aside from following the Lord but serve the Lord with all your heart and turn not aside for then should ye go after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver for they are vain for the Lord will not forsake his people what a statement for the Lord will not forsake his people for his great name's sake because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his people I'll stop right there for moment and say we sin we make mistakes but it doesn't change the fact that we are God's people God's people are made up of individuals it's not like it's a it's the Tucson Tabernacle it's not like it's this group of people or that group of people it's individuals and it pleased God to make us his people and we always don't forget that no matter how many mistakes that we make never never forget that moreover Samuel speaking here he says moreover as for me now this is the man that was offended as for me God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you but I will teach you the good and the right way what a sweet thing to say what a nice what a what a leader right there he says he says you done all this you're not going to you're not believing me you you've sinned in the sight of the Lord but I won't cease praying for you I will continue and I will continue to teach you the good and the right way no matter how much you stray I'm still going to do my job as the priest as the prophet of God only fear the lord and serve him in truth with all your heart for consider how great things he's done for you but if you shall do wickedly you shall be consumed both you and your king so it deeply really deeply touched me I've read that a few times over the past week but this morning I almost brother Jeremy almost cried thinking of Samuel and the kindness that he showed right there and loving the people so no matter how offended he was that they didn't trust him or trust the Lord for all that he had provided for them he still loved the people and he still prayed for them so star so Saul the king over here he started humble and he started little in his own eyes he won some battles and he made some good decisions he did a good job at the beginning but things started to change it started to be more about Saul in his ministry in his kingdom rather than serving the people and although a king he was a king and a spiritually Gifted Man he thought he could take the place of the Prophet So within a couple years of being King Saul makes his first big mistake and he performs a burnt offering that the priest Samuel should have performed he just got impatient first Samuel 13:13 says this and Samuel said to Saul thou Hast done foolishly thou Hast not kept the Commandment of the Lord thy God which he commanded thee for now would the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel forever but now thy kingdom shall not continue sa you made a big mistake here the Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart and the Lord hath commanded him him to be Captain over his people because thou Hast not kept that which the Lord commanded thee thee that man after his own heart was this boy named David I was talking to my wife earlier and reading these and I said honey I said that mistake would have been very easy to make he was Samuel was running late and he's like we got to get the battle we got to get this we got to get this church done we got to get this an offering done so I'll just do it God took the Kingdom from him because of that what I would think is a little mistake but it was important to God so Saul continues in his mistakes and the last straw really for Samuel is when the Lord instructs Saul to go fight this group of people called the amalekites and here's what Samuel says but be first but first let me let me tell a story that's that's sandwiched right in there so Saul has a son this son's name is Jonathan so Jonathan turns out to be this great warrior in the Army so Jonathan and his armor they're going to battle against these Philistines so Jonathan and his armor Bearer armor Bearer is the guy Jonathan was important so he had a guy to carry his armor and his sword whatever he didn't he didn't want to carry this guy would carry it so he tells his armor Bearer he says they they come they come down this this Valley and there's these two big boulders on each side and Jonathan knows that there is a group of 20 Philistines up on the hill now remember these Philistines are big dudes they're not like little little guys like little Israelites they're big strong Warriors so Jonathan goes to his armor Bearer and he's like hey um let's you and me let's go up and fight these Philistines like just you and me so armor bear is like uh okay whatever you want to do Jonathan I'm with you so he says okay here's what we're gonna do we're we're gonna we're gonna sneak up there we're going to climb up the cliff so they the the Philistines had The High Ground so they were already at an advantage AG so he says here's what we're going to do we're going to climb up here and we're going to get up close to them and we're going to show ourselves it's like here we are two guys and if they say why don't you just stay down there and we'll come down there and fight you that means we'll go back but if they say hey why don't you come up here and fight us then we'll go up and and fight him so they're like armor bear is like okay I'm with you Jonathan imagine what this guy thought this armor bear Jonathan had Faith but this armor bear he's going up so Jonathan and the armor Bearer they come out from behind The Rock Says here we are the Philistines look down and they say ah the rats come out of their holes he said come up here and fight us you know that armor bear was like oh great they climb up to the top there was an acre of land Jonathan and his armor Bearer laid waste to these 20 seasoned Warriors and it caused such a stir among the Philistine Army that was about to fight the Israelites that they they got so afraid and they got so discombobulated that they started fighting each other so then Saul sees all this stuff going on and he's like let's go to battle so so the Israelites go to battle and these Philistines are fighting each other so the Israelites come in and they just destroy the whole Army so they they put him on the run so here comes Saul and Saul makes a great decision for a general he's got his Soldier they've been beaten and fighting and he makes he does something really smart and he says let's fast your guys are going they're fighting they're winning they're tired they're thirsty they're hungry and you're going to tell them they can't eat sometimes it may sound good to us but all sometimes it sounds that's a good idea let's do that as as a church I that that that'll really please the Lord but while it may be right over here it may not be right in this instance so he he says he said we're going to have a fast and anyone that breaks this fast is gonna die so Jonathan was doing his thing he's up there fighting and he comes down and there's a bunch of honey in this honeycomb he takes the tip of his Rod dips it in the honey and eats it witnessed by many people so what happened was it gets back to Saul that that someone had broken his commandment one thing leads to the next which leads to the next which leads to the next and then Jonathan comes before Saul and says I'm the one that at when you said not to so Saul said my commandment and you see the narcissist personality come out in Saul right here he said my commandment was that everyone fast and whoever breaks this fast you will be put to death so put Jonathan to death so the people said we not going to do it did you see what he did to those Philistines and you want to kill him they disobeyed the king and you know what it did it produced fear in Saul so Saul continues his mistakes and then the last straw was when Samuel gives instruction for Saul to go fight these amalekites and here's what Samuel says in chapter 15:3 he says go and smite amalec and destroy all that have have all that they have and spare them not very important here but slay both man and woman infant and suckling infant and little baby ox and sheep and camel and ass Saul goes to battle and defeats the amalekites but he doesn't kill the livestock the people wanted to keep the sheep and the goats and the cows so he lets them do what they wanted to do rather than what God had instructed and you can see the fear in Saul right here he fears the people again remember they had just told them we're not going to do what you say so the old Prophet shows up not only that but Saul had not killed the king of the am malachit this guy named name AAG so the old Prophet shows up and he's talking with Saul and he he hears the bleeding of the sheep Samuel does and he hears the sound of the livestock and he's like hey Saul what's that that I hear am I hearing sheep am I hearing cows Saul says yeah the people wanted them and and really I was afraid to tell him no so Samuel says bring me the king AAG told you to kill him too so the king walks up to Samuel very carefully he's in prison he walks up to Samuel and he's like um the killing's over right well killing was not over 1 Samuel 15:33 and Samuel said as thy sword speaking to this King AAG as thy sword has made women childless so shall thy mother be childless among women and Samuel hewed AAG into pieces before the Lord in in in gilgal then Samuel went to Rama and Saul went up to his house in giba of Saul and Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul and the Lord repented Ed that he had made Saul King over Israel wow while the king of Israel Saul is showing all the wrong character traits of a king there's a young man from the tribe of Judah the youngest son to a man named Jesse who God was working on behind the scenes building his character this young boy was named David Samuel anoints David King when he's between 10 and 15 years old God what brings that what brings that to be is God sends Samuel to this man named Jesse with the instructions to anoint one of his sons King over Israel when the oldest son came before Samuel the first one the best looking one the oldest child's always the best looking one he had all the gifts that Saul had he was the perfect choice 1st Samuel 16 Verse 6 and it came to pass when they were come that he looked on elab and said surely the Lord's Anointed The Lord's anointed is before him but the Lord said to Samuel look notd on his countenance or on the height of his stature because I have refused used him for the Lord Lord seeth not as a man seeth for a man lookth on the outward appearance but the Lord lookth on the heart then Jesse called abinadab and made him pass before Samuel and he said neither hath the Lord chosen this then Jesse made shimada pass by and said neither hath the Lord chosen this again Jesse made Seven of his sons to pass before Samuel and Samuel said unto Jesse the Lord hath not chosen these he had eight Sons seven of them came before Samuel and Samuel said unto Jesse here are are here all thy children and he said There remaineth Yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep and Samuel said unto Jesse send and fetch him for we will not sit down until he comes hither and he sent and brought him in now he was r and with all of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look at and the Lord said arise and anoint him for this is he so Saul continues on the throne so he anoints this young man David a very strange thing King but yet Saul stays on the throne for decades after that goes to show that God may have chosen any of us to do a great work for for him but he has a perfect time for that work to come to pass David although he was the rightful king of Israel from that moment he always had the utmost respect for King Saul and the position that the king held in Israel you never talked bad about him and as you'll see here in a few minutes he protected the king so David is a man full of gifts he becomes a great leader a great warrior and he's also a gifted musician and eventually he finds himself playing music in Saul's home Saul loved King Saul loved David and he loved the music so much that David became Saul's personal armor bear D this man Saul he struggled and he would get really down and and you see this this person personality of kind of a narcissist in Saul that he was always thinking about himself he was always worried that somebody was going to take his kingdom or take something that's his and it really started to ruin his life so Goliath so David becomes in Saul's court and he starts playing for Saul and Saul really enjoyed David's playing David's musician U musical Talent so Here Comes This Philistines this Army of Philistines and here we got another War Brewing so we have the Philistines they come and then and then we have the is is the um Jews they come this way and they meet in this Valley and they are going to go to battle and the the Jews are hooting and hollering and they're saying we're going to do it we you know we're going to kill them and we've got the upper hand and then as they are cheering Here Comes This giant almost 10 feet tall they went whoa and they ran away this man comes out with this Shield this sword and this Spear and he comes down and he says Hey Saul why don't you come down and fight me he says why don't you just send one person to come out and fight me why do we all have to die why is there going to be so much Bloodshed just have one come against me me and if I win you serve us and if you kill me then we'll serve you and the Jews were scared to death and he keeps taunting them this giant very intimidating man so David he's out with his sheep his dad's sheep and he's cruising along and his dad says hey son he says hey bring your brother some bread and bring uh this Captain bring him some cheese and David says okay so he takes it and and he's cruising along and he comes down and he's like hey guys what's going on and he sees this giant out there and everybody's afraid of him so David looks and it disgusts him David is a man of great faith and he says listen this this uncircumcised Philistine this uncivilized man is taunting all of us and you're all afraid of him so he starts talking and Saul starts hearing who is this guy what's this this little guy so this little guy comes up David's like I'll fight him I'll fight that guy God's with us why are you so afraid so Saul's like I like his Spirit you know I like I like this kid so he says okay um and then you know had to be thinking well he's going to get killed so then David says listen Saul he says one time I was keeping my father's sheep and he says a lion came to get my father's sheep now who would you bet on would you bet on one of those big African lions or would you bet on Goliath I don't know it would be a good fight but David said this lion came in and he says I took my sling and I killed him and he rose up to get me and I kill killed him with a knife and he says and another time a bear did the same thing he says I can do it he says I've done it before I'll go kill that guy so Saul looks down and he says well let me put on won you put on my armor Saul's like seven feet tall and David's like five feet tall so he puts on an armor he's like man this is way too big I can't even walk in this stuff David says just let me do it let me do it my way so he takes off the armor and he goes down there with his little sling and he walks down to the creek picks up five Stones puts him in his script bag he looks out across and he sees this giant there this giant says oh he's like come on you're sending that guy to fight me this little squirt he doesn't even have armor on you're sending him to fight me so all the Philistines are watching this too too so David listen to the watch the faith of David David doesn't just like walk up and David takes off running at the Philistine look at the faith that is in this man David this little this young man David and he's he's running at the Philistine he takes his sling he takes one of those smooth stones that he got out of the creek puts it in his sling throws it and this rock goes right and hits this Philistine right in the head the Bible says that it sunk into his head the giant goes down it also says this is the literal version the AL It also says that David didn't have a sword with him here's this here's this giant he's laying there David Goes takes Goliath's sword and chops off the Giant's head the Philistines were like whoa that's like the smallest guy in their army I'm out of here they take off running the the Israelites go after them and the Israelites just lay waste to these Philistines so that's David just shows David's faith in God so Saul sees this young man and he starts promoting David and David makes friends with Jonathan remember the warrior remember Saul's son David makes friends with this Jonathan and they become really they become best friends like really close and everywhere David went he was successful he won battle after battle after battle for Saul and one day when David was returning from Battle the women were singing this is a bad deal for David the women were singing Saul's sin this guy come in he's like oh you want again here he comes and the women sing this song they say Saul has struck down his thousands and David his 10 thousands Saul took notice and a spirit of jealousy began to form inside the king and from that day on Saul hated began hating David and trying to kill him the first time the anger came up in Saul he picked up a javelin and he said I'll pin him to the wall and he Chucks this Javelin David Dodges it sticks to the wall and David gets out twice Saul did that Saul was afraid of David because the Bible says he knew that the Lord was with him so Saul gave David a thousand men and send him to battle with the enemies thinking that David he's going to go out and he's going to come back dead so he sends David out and he over and over David fights battles and it was insurmountable odds yet David would come back Victorious so D Saul I forgot to mention had made a promise that whoever kills this giant would get to marry his daughter so David this humbleness of David he said he says I'm not worthy to be the king's son-in-law this is the same man that was anointed king I'm not even worthy to be his son-in-law he ends up going to the ends of the Earth for Saul and winning the impossible battles so that Saul hoped David would die in these battles every time he'd send him on suicide missions David would come back Victorious Saul even plotted to murder David when he returned home from the battle and Jonathan Saul's son warned him and that Spirit would come and go from Saul that hatred of him so cha Saul chases him so it's D D um Jonathan ends up warning David that's hey Saul's coming at you this time so David takes off Saul goes out after David to kill him he brings his army to chase down David and David this man's done nothing except support Saul twice David has the opportunity to kill Saul once Saul was in the cave David and his men were hiding in the cave Saul didn't know they were there Saul comes in to use the restroom David's hiding he comes up to Saul cuts off the bottom of his skirt Saul leaves and another time Saul and his army were asleep and David slips in and steals Saul's Spear and his water bottle while they're asleep both times David repented felt bad for dishonoring Saul what a man this man David was I was reading about him the past few days and thinking Lord how could how could so much character be in one man how much he respected this man was trying to kill him and yet David would never raise his hand against him he even felt bad for stealing a spear sneaking in chapter 25 David meets what would one day David's on the run which is most now the second half of the book of Samuel 1 Samuel David's on on the run and he meets what would become his his second wife he married Saul's daughter this lady named Abigail who at the time was married to an evil drunk guy named nabal David asked for food from nabal and he insults David and his soldiers and this angers the whole Army to where they're like hey we're going to go kill this dude and Abigail his wife comes to her husband's Rescue by sending out food and begging for mercy for her husband nael ends up getting drunk and when he sobers up his wife tells him that she sent help to David and his soldiers and the man ends up having a heart attack and dies 10 days later so so Saul is keeps trying to kill David and David's always a step ahead of him David goes through horrible times hiding in caves and seeing his friends killed just for helping him and yet through all the evil that Saul did David David never turns on Saul he finds a little bit of Peace when he lives with with the Philistines for a year and four months but all the while David was helping Israel secretly killing Israel's enemies right under the nose of the Philistines what a man still helping his people right under the nose of the of where he found peace yet still fighting for the king and for his people Samuel dies in chapter 28 just before a big war between Israel and the Philistines Saul wasn't serving the lord so when he tried to pray God wouldn't hear God wouldn't answer answer him so he ends up going to a witch who he thinks will let him talk to the dead man Samuel remember Samuel just died so he goes to this witch and he's like hey I I need to talk to Samuel and somehow it works the witch tells Saul what Samuel says and basically it's that Saul would die in battle and that God would give the kingdom to David and that Israel would lose this battle against the Philistines and that tomorrow both Saul and his sons would be with Samuel on the other side very strange story I really don't understand it at all but the thing that I take from this story is that God had mercy on this King Saul even at his death because he says that Saul after his death would be with one of the greatest prophets in history the prophet Samuel so Saul loses the battle as Samuel said and he along with most of his sons die and it's sad what they do to Saul's body if uh the musicians would come and we'll close with this 1st Samuel chapter 31 verse 8 says this and it came to pass on the marrow when the Philistines came to strip the slain that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in Mount gaboa and they cut off his head and they stripped off his armor and sent it into the land of the Philistines round about to publish it in the house of their idols and among the people just desecrating Saul's body and putting it on display and they put his armor in the house of ashteroth their God and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth sham and when the inhabitants of jabis Gil Gilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul all the Valiant men arose and went all night and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall at ban and came to jabish and burnt them there and they took their bones and buried them under a tree at jabus jabish and fasted seven days let's all stand we'll close that is the end of the first book of Samuel this is a great time in history Samuel as I showed was one of the greatest men that's written in this whole book and I've never have read with the exception of the Lord Jesus I've never read about a man that had such character and that had such patience and really that had such love as David this young man you can see why that it says that he was a man after God's Own Heart so that's the book of 1 Samuel brothers and sisters let's continue on with our Bible study I was telling Stephan on the way here that I wish more people would have would have come and enjoyed the book of Acts because it it really was it was a blessing in all that we learned about that now we are going through this Bible and it's building this knowledge in us and we have to have knowledge whenever we talk to someone and we don't speak like we un understand or know this Bible it hurts our testimony the more we know about this word the more that we are able to use this word and to witness now now it doesn't understand or knowledge doesn't take the place of worship but then worship doesn't take the place of knowledge either we need both of them so let's continue on continue on studying if we get through this we're gonna have read our whole Bible so let's continue on brother Josiah if you could sing us a song in closing well victory is mine victory is mine Victory today is mine I told Satan get me behind Victory today is mine when I woke this morning when I woke

was inspired and he recorded the strength that he received from God in this book in that book of Psalms amen sister Patricia I want to meet your family so don't don't go too far okay God bless you all
