[35:29] God bless you all let's stand for a
[35:32] moment
[35:36] let's turn our Bibles to Galatians
[35:38] chapter 1. foreign I'm sorry Galatians
[35:42] chapter 5 verse 1.
[35:46] [Music]
[35:56] beautiful beautiful scripture
[35:59] [Music]
[36:01] says this
[36:04] Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty
[36:07] we're with Christ has made us free
[36:11] and be not entangled again
[36:13] with the Yoke of bondage let's pray
[36:18] almighty God we thank you Lord that we
[36:21] can step out of this bondage of the
[36:23] world that
[36:25] the shackles that the enemy has placed
[36:27] upon us
[36:28] and Lord we can be free in Jesus Christ
[36:32] join us Lord this morning and anoint me
[36:35] I pray
[36:37] that father that I could point to a
[36:40] Christ that can
[36:42] take these bonds of slavery
[36:45] from a Dying World
[36:47] in Jesus Christ's name I pray amen
[36:51] God bless you all you can take your
[36:52] seats
[36:53] thank you
[36:58] I
[37:02] thinking on this subject
[37:05] title my sermon slavery by our own
[37:07] choosing
[37:09] and we we see
[37:12] this word bondage and slavery we see it
[37:15] all throughout the Bible
[37:16] from the Old Testament all through the
[37:18] New Testament
[37:20] and
[37:21] I think that more than any other age
[37:25] and of course we don't see out outward
[37:27] slavery today like we have Through the
[37:30] Ages but I think more than any other age
[37:33] that there is slavery in the world
[37:37] and more people are bound in slavery
[37:41] today than I believe that they ever have
[37:43] been
[37:45] and we know that we have a
[37:49] Christ
[37:50] a holy spirit that will liberate us
[37:53] from the slavery
[37:56] I uh let me read the definition
[37:59] we all know what it means but let me
[38:01] read the definition of slavery it says a
[38:03] person who is forced to work for this is
[38:07] a slave a person that is forced to work
[38:10] for and Obey another
[38:12] and is considered to be their property
[38:16] an enslaved person
[38:19] and I think that we may not
[38:23] be be bound
[38:27] today
[38:29] by shackles or in a jail cell but we are
[38:33] bound by sin
[38:36] and it it ruins everything it just it
[38:39] hurts our lives so much
[38:42] in Exodus the 21st chapter
[38:45] Moses is describing
[38:49] this year of Liberation so we would a
[38:53] slave would work for his his or her
[38:56] slave master for six years
[38:58] and then in that seventh year
[39:01] that slave would have the opportunity
[39:05] to to go free
[39:08] and there was there's a few stipulations
[39:10] here that
[39:11] that number one that that slave had to
[39:14] choose to go free that's that's the main
[39:17] thing
[39:18] that slave had to make that choice
[39:21] but second all the dead slave had
[39:24] acquired
[39:25] during that time of slavery had to stay
[39:29] with the slave master
[39:32] it's it's kind of a sad story and I
[39:35] don't know how all that worked out but
[39:38] but if that slave chose to go free then
[39:42] if he married a wife while he was in
[39:44] bondage or had children when he was in
[39:46] bondage then those children had to stay
[39:49] and for you young people
[39:52] be very very careful
[39:54] when maybe you might stray or you might
[39:58] you might sin like all all of us have
[40:02] done
[40:03] be very careful about yoking yourself up
[40:07] with someone while you're in that
[40:09] condition
[40:10] because what might happen is is when you
[40:13] want to come out of that condition
[40:17] that person that your yoke to might want
[40:19] to stay
[40:20] in that condition they might want to
[40:23] stay under bondage of the world
[40:25] so be very very careful
[40:27] when you're not living right or you're
[40:30] you're walking the line and yoking
[40:33] yourself up to something that you can
[40:36] see might not want to change as you
[40:40] change and I've seen it I've seen it so
[40:42] often I've seen so many marriages fail
[40:44] I've seen
[40:46] children and and and parents
[40:50] how they end up they end up hating each
[40:52] other and they they end end up separated
[40:55] from each other because one
[40:58] said I want to make this change in my
[41:01] life I want to go go to the Lord and
[41:04] start serving the lord and the others
[41:06] are like wait a minute I didn't make
[41:08] that choice
[41:09] that's your choice I make my own choices
[41:12] and they stay there
[41:14] so
[41:16] be we need to always use great caution
[41:22] especially if we have chosen
[41:26] to sin
[41:28] especially if we have chosen to live a
[41:31] life that's not serving the lord
[41:34] I would say that the first choice would
[41:36] be to serve the Lord and you can save
[41:38] yourself a lot of problems
[41:40] but if you don't do that
[41:43] and you are straying
[41:46] use great caution in what you're doing
[41:48] because Satan as the Bible said is
[41:51] crouching at the door
[41:53] and he is ready to devour you
[41:57] but then
[41:59] if you can come to Christ
[42:02] then he will liberate he will liberate
[42:06] you
[42:06] and
[42:08] I want to talk today about about the
[42:11] bondage that that we see in the world
[42:13] and and how
[42:15] it's it's so sad
[42:18] but friends I think that all of us
[42:22] struggle with some of the things that
[42:24] I'm going to talk about
[42:25] all of us
[42:27] struggle with slavery of some sort to
[42:32] where we let something else rule over
[42:35] our lives Paul said I believe
[42:39] um Paul said that he says I am a
[42:41] prisoner for Christ
[42:45] and that is the only Master we should
[42:48] have
[42:50] is our lord Jesus but we so often as as
[42:54] you're going to hear we so often put
[42:56] other things as our task master we put
[43:00] other things as our rulers in our lives
[43:05] so much so that we worship these things
[43:08] not knowingly not outwardly worshiping
[43:11] these things
[43:12] but we put it as the authority in our
[43:16] lives
[43:17] let's see what Jesus said about this
[43:19] let's turn to John chapter 8.
[43:32] this morning I'm gonna I'm gonna talk
[43:34] about
[43:35] more
[43:36] about the religious side of things
[43:40] because I believe it's more important
[43:43] and then tonight I'm going to follow up
[43:46] with some of the Natural Things
[43:48] that become our slave master
[43:51] John chapter 8 verse 31 it says this
[43:55] then said Jesus to those Jews which
[43:58] believed on him
[44:01] if you continue in my word
[44:05] then are ye my disciples indeed
[44:08] now Joseph now notice Jesus specifically
[44:12] told them that if you believe me
[44:15] and if you continue in my word
[44:19] then you are my disciples
[44:24] I would go on to say that if you are
[44:26] continuing in someone else's word
[44:29] or taking someone else's authority over
[44:31] things then you become that person's
[44:34] disciples we look at the prophets in the
[44:37] bible
[44:38] and all the prophets they all had
[44:40] disciples you may not know that but they
[44:43] did they had disciples these these
[44:45] brothers that would follow them and and
[44:48] I know that when I was in Israel there
[44:51] was there was this place called the Tomb
[44:52] of the prophets
[44:54] and it was it was this cave that was dug
[44:57] out and there was these tubes I don't
[44:59] know they're maybe about this big around
[45:01] where you could kind of shove a dead
[45:03] body in there and it was it was it was
[45:06] hewed out of the stone and then there
[45:09] were these as you went into the cave
[45:11] there were these holes that were there
[45:13] that used to be where people were buried
[45:15] and each each area that's in this cave
[45:20] had a number of these holes these little
[45:22] places inside of it and I was asking I
[45:26] was asking the guy that was showing me
[45:28] he says well this is where Malachi was
[45:31] buried in this one little room and he
[45:34] said these were Malachi's disciples
[45:38] that were buried with them and then he
[45:40] went to the other Prophet I don't
[45:42] remember which one it was but there was
[45:44] like three prophets in there and and the
[45:46] prophet had his place and then the
[45:49] disciples were buried with them
[45:51] so we see that all of these prophets
[45:53] they had these people that followed with
[45:55] them and we can see that in the
[45:56] scripture
[45:58] but
[46:00] when Jesus came
[46:04] then everyone became his disciple there
[46:08] were still prophets that came you know
[46:10] you had Paul and you had the different
[46:11] ones that still had that gift of
[46:13] Prophecy they were prophets but they
[46:16] told us be Christ's disciple so much so
[46:21] that in First Corinthians chapter 1 Paul
[46:24] is very plain he says some of you say
[46:26] that you're from cephas Peter
[46:28] some of you say you're of Paula some of
[46:31] you say that you're a Paul
[46:34] and he said he says you know he says did
[46:37] Paul was he crucified for you
[46:41] were you baptized in the name of Paul
[46:44] no
[46:45] we are Christ's disciples and every
[46:50] Prophet from Genesis to Revelation and
[46:53] especially in the New Testament they
[46:55] pointed to that man Jesus Christ
[46:59] and we see a separation that goes on
[47:02] when we get outside of that and it's
[47:04] been going on for millennia
[47:08] it's uh
[47:09] let's continue on with John
[47:13] verse 32.
[47:15] and ye shall know the truth
[47:19] and the truth shall make you free
[47:23] and this is one of the scriptures that
[47:25] did so much for me
[47:27] just over the years and when I would
[47:30] sometimes I would see things
[47:33] that
[47:35] in the religious areas of my life
[47:39] I would see things that this doesn't
[47:42] make sense
[47:44] why are we doing this when I can see
[47:47] that the prophet spoke differently or I
[47:50] can see that this book speaks
[47:52] differently of what we're doing I don't
[47:55] I don't understand
[47:56] [Applause]
[47:57] and many times my my eyes would rest on
[48:01] this scripture that says and the truth
[48:04] shall make you free
[48:06] if we can just
[48:09] understand if we can just take in this
[48:13] truth
[48:14] that God has given us
[48:17] then we can have our own relationship
[48:20] with God and we can understand these
[48:23] things and we're not reliant on somebody
[48:26] always feeding us because what if that
[48:29] person is wrong
[48:32] but if I can commune directly with our
[48:36] Lord he's never wrong I'll be wrong all
[48:39] the time
[48:40] but he is never wrong
[48:43] if you receive the truth and he's
[48:46] telling his audience that he's he's
[48:48] talking to these people and these These
[48:50] are Jews it says these are they're
[48:52] Pharisees but they're also his friends
[48:54] he grew up with probably
[48:56] they're people that he knew maybe in the
[48:59] market people that he had talked to
[49:01] fellowshipped with it's it's there's
[49:04] there's Pharisees there and there's
[49:05] scribes there and there's all these
[49:07] different different uh conglomeration of
[49:10] people all different
[49:12] so a good variety here
[49:15] and Jesus is saying that the truth will
[49:18] make you free so if you think about that
[49:21] statement wait a minute
[49:24] if you're saying that Something's Gonna
[49:27] Make Me free
[49:29] you're saying I'm in bondage right now
[49:33] right
[49:34] or else why would you want to why would
[49:36] you need to be free if you're not in
[49:37] bondage
[49:39] next verse
[49:42] and they answered him we be Abraham's
[49:45] seed
[49:47] and we were never
[49:49] in bondage to any man
[49:52] how sayest thou you shall be made free
[49:57] we've never been in bondage what are you
[49:59] talking about
[50:00] we're free we can do whatever we want
[50:03] yet Jesus is saying you are a slave
[50:08] and it it looks to me the way this is
[50:11] written it looks like it offended them
[50:14] who do you think you are I've got it
[50:16] right
[50:17] I've got a good church that I go to
[50:20] I like my pastor I like what we teach
[50:23] you know now those Sadducees I don't
[50:26] really like them
[50:27] you know they've got it all wrong you
[50:29] know and the esteems out there they're
[50:30] weird you know they're on the desert and
[50:32] they're they're doing their but we're
[50:34] right we've got it all we understand it
[50:37] all
[50:40] we were never in bondage how say us thou
[50:42] ye shall be made free
[50:45] Jesus answering them
[50:48] verily verily I say unto you whosoever
[50:52] committeth sin is the servant of sin
[50:57] wow
[51:00] what a statement
[51:03] so if you are sinning
[51:06] Jesus is saying
[51:08] then you are a slave to that sin that
[51:12] you're committing
[51:13] what a statement
[51:15] and you know that they probably didn't
[51:17] like that when when he said that he says
[51:20] you know we've we you know we've never
[51:22] been a a slave to anyone you can say
[51:24] here in the United States it's been 150
[51:26] years since there was slavery
[51:28] here what what are you talking about
[51:30] but Jesus said
[51:33] that you are that slave and if we
[51:37] remember back in Exodus
[51:40] they had a chance
[51:43] to leave after those seven years
[51:46] they had the opportunity I can go
[51:50] but if I stay
[51:54] if I stay and sometimes they probably
[51:56] had a good
[51:58] a slave owner
[52:00] they probably had maybe a man that that
[52:02] loved his slaves that that was a was a
[52:06] good
[52:07] um that took care of them that wasn't
[52:09] mean to them
[52:11] so if they wanted to stay
[52:14] or if they wanted to stay because they
[52:16] had they had a wife and they had
[52:18] children or what it might whatever it
[52:20] might be or they've simply liked being a
[52:22] Slave
[52:23] you know I don't like going out and
[52:24] working on my own I don't have to worry
[52:26] about putting food on the table I just
[52:29] want to get up in the morning go work
[52:30] all day come back and if I'm good I
[52:33] don't get whipped
[52:34] and I just want to come home to my
[52:36] family and I just want to live this life
[52:39] of slavery my whole life and I'm not
[52:42] really I don't really care about
[52:43] anything else
[52:45] and if that was the case
[52:47] then after these then then in this
[52:50] seventh year
[52:51] then they would take this slave and they
[52:55] would bore a hole in his ear
[52:59] and then that person was marked you are
[53:02] now
[53:03] a bondsman to this slave owner
[53:08] because of that that Mark that's on you
[53:12] now we we preach against earrings using
[53:14] that scripture and but in this case
[53:17] it was a mark
[53:20] that this man or this whoever it was
[53:23] said I want to stay a Slave
[53:28] and the bad thing is
[53:31] this is the the saddest part about what
[53:33] I'm what I'm going to say today
[53:36] is they chose that
[53:41] and we choose our own slave masters
[53:47] we make that choice it is up to us do I
[53:51] want to serve this slave master or do I
[53:56] want to be liberated through Christ and
[53:59] we know since the Holy Spirit fell since
[54:01] Jesus came
[54:02] that there is no bondage you no longer
[54:06] have to be bound to sin because of the
[54:08] blood of Jesus Christ now
[54:12] we see people more and more and more
[54:15] choosing I want to be a Slave
[54:20] you know um I see one of the the most
[54:24] difficult spirits
[54:27] I have ever dealt with not the most
[54:30] difficult but one of the most difficult
[54:32] spirits that I've ever dealt with is a
[54:35] drug addict
[54:37] I have counseled so many people they
[54:40] they come in and they're addicted to
[54:43] these drugs they might start with
[54:44] painkillers
[54:46] and then it gets more and more and then
[54:49] they get addicted and and they want more
[54:51] and then it might turn to heroin or a
[54:54] lot of times it's alcoholism
[54:57] and they don't want to stop
[55:01] they worship that and it it totally
[55:04] rules their lives
[55:06] when they start coming down
[55:09] off of that high
[55:11] they will do anything to get it back
[55:13] that's slave master
[55:16] starting to snap his fingers
[55:18] all right you You Gotta Serve me again
[55:23] and they they will lie they will cheat
[55:26] they will steal
[55:27] do anything they would go into the
[55:29] hospital and my wife tells me that they
[55:32] will go into the hospital and they're
[55:33] the nicest people
[55:35] oh nurse Stephanie we I love you so much
[55:37] and and how sweet you are as long as
[55:40] she's pumping
[55:42] the Dilaudid into the veins
[55:45] or the painkillers in there
[55:47] but when she can't when she can't press
[55:50] that button anymore because it's gone
[55:52] and you can't have another one for four
[55:54] hours you see the claws come out
[55:57] you see I need that no you don't need it
[56:02] but they that slave master is always on
[56:05] top of him saying you need it serve me
[56:10] and they do
[56:12] they want it and it is the most
[56:16] important things in their life they'll
[56:18] sell their wife out their son out their
[56:20] daughter out they will sell anything to
[56:22] get those drugs and we've all you don't
[56:25] have to raise your hand but pretty much
[56:27] all of us have seen it
[56:29] that addiction that slave master that is
[56:33] over those people
[56:35] and you know and it's it's become an
[56:38] epidemic in our country where we have
[56:40] all these homeless people now
[56:42] they'll give it all up man
[56:44] you know I don't even have I don't have
[56:46] a house I don't have a car I don't have
[56:47] I don't have anything but as soon as I
[56:49] get my check from the government I'm
[56:52] going to get my fix that's all I care
[56:54] about I'll sleep on the street
[56:57] and I'll get attacked I'll do whatever
[56:59] get robbed all the time you know they're
[57:01] always fighting and and doing each other
[57:03] dirty but as long as they get their fix
[57:05] that's why you know I I feel so bad for
[57:09] those people but I've witnessed to so
[57:11] many of them
[57:13] and I've tried I've reached out so many
[57:15] times
[57:17] but I don't think I have ever seen
[57:20] one recover
[57:22] I'm sure you have and I hope that you
[57:24] have I know there have been but that
[57:27] drug rules them
[57:31] they might come off of it for a little
[57:32] while and then they'll come up missing
[57:34] for who knows how long
[57:37] and it's because the slave master
[57:39] snapped his finger
[57:43] you know we we talk about that
[57:46] but then
[57:49] there's other things that when it snaps
[57:52] its fingers for us we hop to it too we
[57:55] might not have a problem with drugs
[57:57] but we might have a problem with temper
[57:59] you know we might have if somebody says
[58:03] something wrong to you
[58:05] somebody gets under your skin a little
[58:07] bit
[58:09] slave master
[58:10] I'm I'm the boss
[58:13] I'm in charge and you let it out
[58:17] you know and you say things and later
[58:20] you might regret it
[58:22] or you're driving in your car
[58:25] listen a car even if your windows are
[58:28] closed
[58:30] a car is not this magical force field
[58:34] that keeps you from sinning
[58:36] when you're inside that car you're as
[58:39] much of a sinner inside as you are
[58:41] outside
[58:43] and Jesus knows exactly what you're
[58:45] doing inside that car so you're driving
[58:48] along this guy cuts you off
[58:52] and every word that you say is recorded
[58:55] every thought that you have oh and the
[58:58] time that you sped up so he couldn't get
[59:00] in the lane
[59:02] it counts it matters
[59:06] that's that temper that's rising up
[59:09] that's that slave master
[59:11] that he snaps his fingers and we're
[59:15] right up to it
[59:16] even on the street or wherever we are
[59:21] he's the boss
[59:24] but we can
[59:27] we can overcome that I'm going to read a
[59:30] scripture in a little bit I read last
[59:31] week I'm going to read it again
[59:33] here in a little while social media I'm
[59:35] going to talk about tonight that's one
[59:36] of the most obvious ones
[59:38] you know I mean that that little light
[59:40] goes off and that Ding goes off and oh
[59:43] you know yes boss
[59:46] what can I do for you
[59:52] fear
[59:54] fear is one of those task Masters
[59:58] that
[59:59] it controls so many people's lives
[1:00:04] I'm afraid I'm afraid to
[1:00:08] take the next step
[1:00:10] you know and I have to say that
[1:00:14] how many how many times in this book
[1:00:16] does it say fear not
[1:00:20] why does it say fear not
[1:00:22] it says fear not because he's saying
[1:00:24] don't be afraid why because there's so
[1:00:27] much fear
[1:00:29] there's so much fear in the world
[1:00:31] and yet
[1:00:33] we we know we have Jesus we know that
[1:00:35] that everything he said will come to
[1:00:37] pass we know we have all these promises
[1:00:39] yet we are so afraid many times just to
[1:00:42] get sick
[1:00:45] you know we're we're afraid that oh it
[1:00:47] could be this when just on the other
[1:00:50] side you know what's waiting for us
[1:00:52] if we're right if this task master isn't
[1:00:55] our our leader if our leader is Christ
[1:00:58] you know what's on the other side
[1:01:00] who cares if we get sick
[1:01:03] oh man it's it's the best time you know
[1:01:05] I was
[1:01:06] talking with uh
[1:01:08] um well I went to visit brother Marriott
[1:01:12] and I see and I look at the the brother
[1:01:14] and and I feel so bad he's just laboring
[1:01:19] for every breath
[1:01:21] just struggling but what greater time in
[1:01:26] his whole life than is it right now
[1:01:30] it's the greatest time I was witnessing
[1:01:34] to to a lady she was she was walking in
[1:01:37] and and she was all sad and and I you
[1:01:40] know I talked to her about the Lord she
[1:01:41] said well we're not believers
[1:01:44] and I said well now's a good time to be
[1:01:46] and you know she was talking about
[1:01:48] something else that happened
[1:01:50] I said I want to tell the story she was
[1:01:52] I was getting in the elevator and I was
[1:01:54] going up to see them
[1:01:57] and this lady's in there and she's
[1:01:59] looking at me I don't know she's
[1:02:00] probably in her
[1:02:01] 60s or 70s
[1:02:04] and I said uh
[1:02:06] I said how's your day she says terrible
[1:02:10] she said my son got electrocuted and
[1:02:12] he's brain dead and he's dying
[1:02:17] I said
[1:02:19] wow I said I'm sorry do you hear that I
[1:02:22] said
[1:02:23] I said I said I'm a minister
[1:02:26] I says there's something I can do
[1:02:29] I said I'd like to do something for you
[1:02:31] and she said well no she's we're not
[1:02:33] believers
[1:02:35] and I said well it would be a good time
[1:02:38] to start right now
[1:02:40] and she kind of looked at me like well
[1:02:43] she didn't say no but she meant no
[1:02:46] I thought
[1:02:48] who was the task master here
[1:02:50] who's the slave
[1:02:53] I don't care if you believe in God or
[1:02:55] not your son
[1:02:57] there's still life going through his
[1:03:00] veins
[1:03:01] there's still hope but she hasn't been
[1:03:04] taught that way
[1:03:06] how important how important it would
[1:03:09] have been
[1:03:10] if she would have just had that hope
[1:03:13] maybe it wouldn't have happened maybe it
[1:03:15] would have happened it's happened a lot
[1:03:17] of times
[1:03:19] so we but but there's just there's a
[1:03:21] constantly there's a constant fear so
[1:03:24] often plaguing us that we're afraid to
[1:03:27] do anything and I got to tell you the
[1:03:28] truth I'm I struggle with it
[1:03:32] Lord
[1:03:33] with the church it's like Lord I'm
[1:03:35] afraid what if it fails
[1:03:38] what if I fail the people
[1:03:40] and I look and and that's that's when
[1:03:43] the devil boy he will give me every
[1:03:46] single time I've failed
[1:03:49] my whole life
[1:03:52] and last week in the past day
[1:03:56] you know he puts it right in there and
[1:03:58] this fear comes over me and I can't do
[1:04:00] it
[1:04:01] you know I'm afraid I'm afraid to to do
[1:04:05] the young people stuff what if it fails
[1:04:09] what if it doesn't work I'm I'm afraid
[1:04:12] with the church it's like Lord what
[1:04:15] about what about if we're if we're to
[1:04:17] take up an offering what if the people
[1:04:18] get what if the people get offended
[1:04:21] you know and I'm looking at all of these
[1:04:23] different things and Lord if what if I
[1:04:25] fail I can't do it
[1:04:28] but
[1:04:29] something
[1:04:32] carries us through and something gets
[1:04:35] gets just
[1:04:36] it just it's something that just gives
[1:04:38] you strength
[1:04:40] you know and I say you know what I'll
[1:04:42] fail then
[1:04:44] I'll fail I've done it a lot I'm good at
[1:04:47] it
[1:04:49] I'll do it again
[1:04:51] but I will keep trying
[1:04:55] keep serving keep working keep moving
[1:05:00] if we fail we fail
[1:05:04] it's okay
[1:05:05] but if we don't try that's not okay
[1:05:08] it doesn't mean enough to us then we
[1:05:11] take on the task master of being the
[1:05:13] laziness or
[1:05:16] not wanting to do it not wanting to get
[1:05:20] up and serve someone
[1:05:22] now I I think of Peter with fear
[1:05:26] and the the they were out in the boat
[1:05:29] and and the the this it was dark and the
[1:05:32] lightning was crashing and the Thunder
[1:05:34] and the waves were going and and they're
[1:05:37] all afraid and they look out there and
[1:05:40] they see Jesus
[1:05:42] walking on the water
[1:05:44] imagine the fear of a little boat
[1:05:46] and they see him out there
[1:05:49] and Peter says Lord if it's you been me
[1:05:53] to come
[1:05:55] he says come on
[1:05:57] Peter gets out of the boat walks on the
[1:06:01] water
[1:06:03] and then he gets scared fear comes on
[1:06:07] the Taskmaster
[1:06:10] says you're gonna die
[1:06:13] Peter starts to sink and he cries out to
[1:06:15] the Lord Jesus he reaches his hand up
[1:06:17] Jesus grabs him pulls him up and all of
[1:06:21] a sudden
[1:06:22] you know they're back to the shore
[1:06:24] imagine if Peter would have been too
[1:06:28] afraid to step out into the water
[1:06:32] the fact is Peter walked on the water he
[1:06:36] did it and the second fact is is Jesus
[1:06:40] as he always does reach down and pull
[1:06:43] them out and that is what he will always
[1:06:46] do no matter how afraid we are if we'll
[1:06:49] trust in him we'll reach out that hand
[1:06:51] like Peter did he'll pull us right back
[1:06:53] out don't ever worry he's there but you
[1:06:56] gotta step out
[1:06:58] you gotta get out of the boat
[1:07:03] and then
[1:07:04] if you do fail like we all do
[1:07:08] then the guilt starts
[1:07:11] and I struggle with that one
[1:07:14] a guy said I look back at all the things
[1:07:16] that I've done
[1:07:18] all the things that all the dumb things
[1:07:20] that I've said
[1:07:23] and then it just starts working on me
[1:07:26] and and I start
[1:07:29] dwelling on them and we struggle so much
[1:07:32] with our past sins
[1:07:34] we struggle with every these things that
[1:07:36] we've done it's like
[1:07:38] and the devil is so good at throwing
[1:07:41] them back there
[1:07:43] but as I said in the last service
[1:07:46] it's a lack of faith if we can't keep
[1:07:49] those under the blood
[1:07:51] it's a lack of faith if we can't believe
[1:07:54] that Jesus actually died for it first
[1:07:57] time it's over it's us
[1:08:01] that keep bringing about bringing it out
[1:08:03] and bringing it out but we can't do it
[1:08:06] no matter what we've done and how bad we
[1:08:08] feel no matter how much we try to bring
[1:08:11] that out there is nothing there to bring
[1:08:13] out it's gone
[1:08:16] Jesus died once for our sins
[1:08:18] and it's gone and I've seen people
[1:08:21] struggle with that so much struggle with
[1:08:25] they think that they have sinned so far
[1:08:27] they think that they have committed
[1:08:28] blasphemy all the way to they take their
[1:08:30] own lives
[1:08:32] not even knowing that those sins were
[1:08:35] completely gone
[1:08:37] but the enemy
[1:08:39] he puts he puts those things back on
[1:08:41] there the Bible says
[1:08:43] in First Corinthians chapter 10 verse
[1:08:46] 13. let me read this this is just
[1:08:49] no matter how bad you think
[1:08:51] that these these this Taskmaster is no
[1:08:54] matter how strong you think he is no
[1:08:56] matter how much those Cravings that the
[1:08:58] as the drug addict would say no matter
[1:09:00] how bad you think your temper is no
[1:09:03] matter how weak you think you are with
[1:09:05] gossip or whatever it is here is what
[1:09:08] Paul said in First Corinthians he said
[1:09:09] that there hath no temptation taken you
[1:09:14] but such as is common to man you're not
[1:09:18] special
[1:09:20] whatever you're struggling with a lot of
[1:09:23] people have struggling struggle with it
[1:09:24] too don't think that you're special
[1:09:27] you are special to Christ but you're not
[1:09:30] special to the devil
[1:09:37] amen you know you're not he hates us
[1:09:41] the one person that cares about us is
[1:09:44] the man Christ Jesus
[1:09:48] but God is faithful who will not suffer
[1:09:52] you to be tempted above that you are
[1:09:55] able
[1:09:57] but will
[1:09:59] with the Temptation also make a way to
[1:10:01] escape that ye may be able to bear it
[1:10:05] every one of these homeless people every
[1:10:07] one of these drug addicts every one of
[1:10:09] these people that that can't control
[1:10:11] their temper every one of these people
[1:10:12] that are driving and I do you know I
[1:10:16] I'm going to ram him hahaha
[1:10:19] you are able to overcome that
[1:10:22] that guilt that you have
[1:10:25] from the past you are able to overcome
[1:10:28] it
[1:10:29] all of those things you are able
[1:10:32] according to God's word it's not me
[1:10:34] saying this it is the prophet of God
[1:10:36] speaking this
[1:10:39] and James
[1:10:42] he says submit yourselves to God
[1:10:46] he says flee
[1:10:48] resist the devil and he will flee from
[1:10:51] you
[1:10:53] keep trying
[1:10:55] God's not going to give you something
[1:10:56] you can't overcome
[1:10:59] let's go back to John chapter 8.
[1:11:02] verse 35.
[1:11:04] and the servant of the servant abideth
[1:11:07] not in the house forever but the son
[1:11:09] abideth ever
[1:11:11] if the son therefore shall make you free
[1:11:16] ye shall be free indeed and there is the
[1:11:20] key to that whole group of scriptures
[1:11:23] the heroin user he needs Christ the
[1:11:26] person with the temper needs Christ the
[1:11:28] social media addict needs Christ a
[1:11:31] fearful person needs Christ Trust
[1:11:35] in Jesus
[1:11:38] every portion of Our Lives
[1:11:42] needs to have Christ applied especially
[1:11:45] those weak spots I was listening to tape
[1:11:46] yesterday and brother Branham was
[1:11:49] talking about boxing and he said when
[1:11:51] you have a weak spot
[1:11:53] he said always cover that spot
[1:11:56] and it's the same with us when we have
[1:11:59] that weak spot always cover that with
[1:12:01] the blood
[1:12:01] always come always be ready to bring
[1:12:04] that to Christ
[1:12:07] and I was thinking you know about this
[1:12:09] audience
[1:12:12] these people
[1:12:14] in this audience they had in their minds
[1:12:19] that Jesus was talking to these Jews as
[1:12:21] the Bible says they had in their minds
[1:12:24] how things should be
[1:12:28] they had in their mind how we should
[1:12:31] conduct Church
[1:12:32] they had in their mind how long the
[1:12:35] tassels of the of the the brothers
[1:12:37] garments those those Jewish tassels how
[1:12:40] long those should be down how those
[1:12:42] those things should be wrapped around
[1:12:44] their wrists and on their foreheads and
[1:12:46] how long the lady's skirts should be and
[1:12:48] they're long their hair should be they
[1:12:50] had in their mind how everything should
[1:12:52] be
[1:12:55] and it came contrary to what they
[1:12:58] thought
[1:12:59] when Jesus came
[1:13:02] because these people
[1:13:05] and here's the number one
[1:13:07] these people were a Slave
[1:13:10] to their own way of thinking
[1:13:12] these Pharisees and Sadducees and how
[1:13:15] they had it all figured out they were
[1:13:17] slaves
[1:13:19] to their own thought process
[1:13:22] they were slaves to the things that they
[1:13:25] had learned
[1:13:26] that made sense
[1:13:28] but
[1:13:30] when the real thing came
[1:13:32] they missed it
[1:13:34] they condemned it
[1:13:36] and that's what I see so often in US
[1:13:40] today
[1:13:41] you know we become a slave to the things
[1:13:44] that we've we've learned
[1:13:47] the way that we grow up we become a
[1:13:50] slave to that understanding and then
[1:13:52] when God might want to do something
[1:13:55] whoa
[1:13:57] that's not like I remember
[1:13:59] well that's not what I'm used to
[1:14:01] that's different
[1:14:04] and different has got to be wrong and
[1:14:08] then you start reading you start looking
[1:14:10] in the message you start looking in the
[1:14:12] Bible and you start trying to find
[1:14:14] things to condemn it
[1:14:17] because you are a slave
[1:14:20] I am a slave we are slaves to the to a
[1:14:25] thought process to a to a a religious
[1:14:28] system
[1:14:31] and if we would just let Christ in
[1:14:35] then we may understand a little bit
[1:14:38] better you know I see
[1:14:40] you're not allowed to play golf
[1:14:43] you know because of brother Branham said
[1:14:44] this you know some some preach against
[1:14:46] television all the time some only play
[1:14:49] tape sermons of brother Brianna
[1:14:51] some that you have to play the whole
[1:14:53] tape and some just a partial tape and
[1:14:55] then the preaching is the main thing
[1:14:57] and then some that if the spirit doesn't
[1:15:00] move and doesn't promote doesn't produce
[1:15:02] an emotional response in every service
[1:15:05] then that service wasn't successful
[1:15:08] and then some teach that you can't have
[1:15:11] strings and stringed instruments in
[1:15:13] church some teach that you can't have
[1:15:14] drums you know some teach that that you
[1:15:17] don't have to play a tape but you have
[1:15:19] to read quotes of brother Branham on
[1:15:20] every service and then every one of us
[1:15:22] we all have these these things that
[1:15:24] every church service is supposed to be
[1:15:26] and then if it doesn't match that
[1:15:29] I don't want it
[1:15:31] I don't want it because it doesn't match
[1:15:33] the way I think
[1:15:35] you know and
[1:15:37] you know I think about
[1:15:39] brother Brown tells this story about
[1:15:41] this Crow
[1:15:43] that that this farmer caught you know
[1:15:46] he's eating his eating his grain and
[1:15:47] stuff so this farmer caught this Crow
[1:15:49] and he tied a string to his foot
[1:15:52] and then over here he put a stake in the
[1:15:55] ground and tied the other end of the of
[1:15:57] the string to that and this Crow he was
[1:15:59] he would walk around he had to walk
[1:16:01] around in a circle and he would just
[1:16:02] pick and eat everything that he could
[1:16:04] within this strings length and all the
[1:16:07] other crows you know they're flying
[1:16:08] around and coming back and flying around
[1:16:10] and he he tried to fly a couple times
[1:16:12] and he couldn't and he stuck to this
[1:16:14] string
[1:16:15] and he got so weak because he'd eaten
[1:16:18] all the food around
[1:16:20] and this little boy walks up to this
[1:16:23] Crow
[1:16:25] and he unties him after days or however
[1:16:28] long it was and he unties it
[1:16:31] and that Crow still thought he was tied
[1:16:37] he was in bondage to his thoughts he
[1:16:41] could have flown away
[1:16:42] but he still kept walking around in this
[1:16:45] circle not going outside of it
[1:16:48] because that is the way he learned
[1:16:52] and going to and fro and everything and
[1:16:56] knowing that he just couldn't go past
[1:16:58] that even though he could
[1:17:00] if he would have just flapped his wings
[1:17:03] or made a couple hops he would have been
[1:17:04] outside of that but that's so often with
[1:17:08] us
[1:17:10] you know we we're we're Bound by this
[1:17:13] and we're going around
[1:17:15] and we
[1:17:18] get free
[1:17:20] we get liberated
[1:17:22] we accept the Lord Jesus we get filled
[1:17:25] with the Holy Spirit but then we get
[1:17:26] stuck
[1:17:28] because of our way of thinking and that
[1:17:30] task master is still there and we are
[1:17:33] not willing to let something else
[1:17:36] into our lives
[1:17:38] and by doing that we stick our hand out
[1:17:40] say God I don't want it
[1:17:42] Jesus I don't want what you have I I'm I
[1:17:45] made this Choice I'm here
[1:17:48] and if it doesn't come the way that I
[1:17:50] think it should come then it can't be
[1:17:51] right
[1:17:53] the Azusa Street Revival way back 1906.
[1:18:01] it was a very odd thing that happened
[1:18:06] people they were they were
[1:18:08] meeting at this house
[1:18:11] and there was something that was going
[1:18:13] on that was absolutely not right
[1:18:17] according to tradition
[1:18:21] one of those things where blacks and
[1:18:24] whites
[1:18:25] we're worshiping together
[1:18:29] you have to think way back then over 100
[1:18:31] years ago that was not right there's
[1:18:33] something wrong there that doesn't that
[1:18:35] doesn't jive with with what I've been
[1:18:37] what I've learned it can't be right
[1:18:41] yet the spirit was coming down and was
[1:18:45] operating
[1:18:46] and we see these people and you can read
[1:18:48] back in the text and they're saying this
[1:18:50] this is wrong this is unclean
[1:18:54] how can this be right this integration
[1:18:57] them doing this
[1:18:59] they don't look like us they don't talk
[1:19:02] like us they don't act like us they
[1:19:04] don't worship like us how can it be
[1:19:06] right
[1:19:08] but then there were some some that were
[1:19:11] willing to cross that boundary
[1:19:15] and they were willing to say you know
[1:19:16] what if God's in it I want to be there
[1:19:19] there was a great man we've all heard
[1:19:21] his name before named FF Bosworth
[1:19:24] brother Bosworth he saw he had heard
[1:19:27] about this and he went and he said I
[1:19:29] want to see what's going on
[1:19:32] he went he went down there and he said
[1:19:35] this is the real thing
[1:19:37] brother Bosworth started was one of the
[1:19:40] founding fathers of the Assembly of God
[1:19:42] denomination he was a big deal
[1:19:46] he was a great man separated himself
[1:19:49] from him when they said they said that
[1:19:51] you have to agree that the initial
[1:19:53] evidence the first evidence of the holy
[1:19:55] spirit that you receive is speaking in
[1:19:57] tongues but Bosworth said that is not
[1:19:59] right I'm out
[1:20:01] you know when you try to put a yoke on
[1:20:03] the people like that I'm out of that
[1:20:07] and
[1:20:08] with the Azusa Street Revival
[1:20:12] you see
[1:20:13] something that's fairly common
[1:20:16] and it started with young people
[1:20:22] they were they were fairly young these
[1:20:24] ones that that started going and started
[1:20:27] worshiping and it started by a black man
[1:20:30] named William Seymour
[1:20:32] which that cut certain people out
[1:20:35] and then you see that that this is
[1:20:38] mainly Youth and how can they understand
[1:20:40] what's going on how can they know we are
[1:20:42] the educated we're the polished we have
[1:20:46] experience
[1:20:48] and you know you'll find throughout
[1:20:50] history
[1:20:51] that most
[1:20:54] of the revivals that have started at
[1:20:56] least a significant portion of them
[1:20:58] started among the youth
[1:21:01] why is that
[1:21:03] even Jesus and his disciples you know
[1:21:05] he's only 30 years old
[1:21:07] and his disciples were probably around
[1:21:09] that age or younger many of them
[1:21:12] this young man in all of these these
[1:21:15] young men and women given their hearts
[1:21:17] to the Lord why
[1:21:19] why are the youth so receptive
[1:21:23] it's because they probably haven't been
[1:21:25] indoctrinated all these years
[1:21:27] they haven't had all this stuff pounded
[1:21:29] into them for all of this time to where
[1:21:31] now it's like well this has to be right
[1:21:33] and anything else I'm not going to
[1:21:35] accept the youth generally don't have
[1:21:38] that
[1:21:39] they're more open to a Revival
[1:21:43] and that's what happened at Azusa Street
[1:21:46] and it was others it was it wasn't just
[1:21:48] all youth
[1:21:49] but
[1:21:51] they were ready even though if it went
[1:21:54] against what they had been raised
[1:21:57] thinking was right
[1:21:59] and now
[1:22:02] I see and I've read
[1:22:05] on the news
[1:22:07] that there is a Revival breaking out
[1:22:11] in Kentucky
[1:22:13] among the youth
[1:22:15] is it for us
[1:22:17] I don't know
[1:22:19] what's happening there
[1:22:21] in this place
[1:22:23] in Kentucky what is going on
[1:22:27] and I started
[1:22:29] a few days ago I started reading about
[1:22:31] it
[1:22:33] and I started watching some of the
[1:22:34] YouTube videos
[1:22:36] and
[1:22:38] it's
[1:22:40] it's something happened in this Asbury
[1:22:44] University in Kentucky
[1:22:47] this young man they have Chapel in the
[1:22:50] morning
[1:22:51] this young man I think I wrote his name
[1:22:53] down
[1:22:55] um Nick Dawson was his name
[1:22:59] towards the end of Chapel he gets up and
[1:23:03] he gives a testimony
[1:23:05] to the chap to the to the young people
[1:23:07] in there just normal Chapel
[1:23:10] and he said something on the order
[1:23:15] of
[1:23:18] he said uh
[1:23:22] it was it was something on the order of
[1:23:23] how much that he loves Jesus
[1:23:26] and how he he would confess his faults
[1:23:30] and how good Jesus is and the importance
[1:23:33] of spreading Jesus Christ to other
[1:23:37] people
[1:23:38] then another young person got up
[1:23:41] and that person gave a testimony
[1:23:43] then another one got up and that person
[1:23:46] gave a testimony and soon they were
[1:23:48] praising the Lord and they were they
[1:23:51] were shouting and they were they were
[1:23:52] praying and they were singing
[1:23:55] and they they missed class
[1:23:59] and they just stayed in the auditorium
[1:24:03] kept praying kept singing other people
[1:24:06] started to hear about this
[1:24:08] so they started coming in
[1:24:10] other students around they started
[1:24:12] praying they started singing they
[1:24:14] started worshiping
[1:24:16] it went on
[1:24:18] and then day two they continued they
[1:24:20] didn't go home that night
[1:24:23] they stayed in the auditorium
[1:24:25] they kept on kept on worshiping
[1:24:29] day two then then they started doing
[1:24:31] like they do
[1:24:32] you know and this you know videoing
[1:24:35] uploading it to social media this is
[1:24:38] awesome other young people started
[1:24:41] coming
[1:24:42] from the school they started coming then
[1:24:45] day three comes along they still hadn't
[1:24:48] gone home
[1:24:50] you know the the people in the school
[1:24:51] are like well
[1:24:53] they had enough wisdom to say let's let
[1:24:55] this go
[1:24:57] more people started coming
[1:25:01] after a few days the media starts
[1:25:03] covering it
[1:25:04] social media they're getting out the
[1:25:07] best way that they know how these young
[1:25:09] people
[1:25:09] they're getting this message out other
[1:25:12] other kids start coming then they start
[1:25:14] coming from other places
[1:25:16] outside of this Asbury School
[1:25:19] then
[1:25:21] churches in the area start bringing
[1:25:24] buses in
[1:25:25] packing this Auditorium
[1:25:28] it is full
[1:25:30] and they're praising and they're saying
[1:25:31] they still haven't gone home
[1:25:34] one after the other they're coming and
[1:25:37] the News starts to get out
[1:25:39] more and more
[1:25:41] they had to shut her down for a little
[1:25:43] bit to do a little maintenance they they
[1:25:45] set up they set up coffee shops you know
[1:25:47] on the outside and they set up little
[1:25:49] places where they can get food
[1:25:51] 24 hours a day praying
[1:25:55] singing worshiping
[1:25:58] a Revival was sparking up in this place
[1:26:03] so I'm watching this and I'm keeping
[1:26:05] track of it you know I'm reading about
[1:26:06] it's like wow this is something but you
[1:26:09] know what they don't look like us
[1:26:13] laughs
[1:26:16] I don't care
[1:26:20] you know what maybe their hair isn't
[1:26:23] long enough maybe maybe they have a pair
[1:26:24] of shorts on if they're boys
[1:26:30] I don't care
[1:26:33] when's the last time we saw an all-night
[1:26:35] prayer meeting
[1:26:36] among Our Youth and I'm going to
[1:26:38] criticize that I'm not I'm not condoning
[1:26:41] it of course not you know that I mean
[1:26:44] that's I'm not saying that that we
[1:26:46] should we should look like that I don't
[1:26:48] care but something is going on there
[1:26:53] and then who are we we might say you
[1:26:55] know what it can't be right
[1:26:57] because they don't look like me
[1:27:00] it can't be right maybe because they're
[1:27:02] not using the same King James
[1:27:04] translation as I am
[1:27:08] it maybe it can't be right because
[1:27:10] they're not using the same Scriptures it
[1:27:12] can't be right because they don't dress
[1:27:14] like this
[1:27:16] but the fact is God is doing something
[1:27:18] there
[1:27:19] so as I'm watching this I got down on my
[1:27:22] knees yesterday and I said Lord Jesus
[1:27:24] bless those people
[1:27:27] may your spirit go out from that place
[1:27:31] may this revival start
[1:27:34] crying out Lord God may it be may this
[1:27:38] be true bless these people bless these
[1:27:42] young people may it spread and Lord If
[1:27:44] It Be Your Will
[1:27:46] make something spread to this Tabernacle
[1:27:49] and give us the Revival that we all want
[1:27:53] pour out your spirit Lord
[1:27:56] so I'm watching I'm I'm keeping track of
[1:27:59] this and a buddy that I have
[1:28:01] and Jeffersonville somebody that I

[1:30:16] love him
[1:30:18] for others
[1:30:24] because it was so
[1:30:27] genuine so we're thinking and
[1:30:34] real how can I I can't even put it the
[1:30:36] words right now glory be to God and what
[1:30:39] I'm saying is that it wasn't I
[1:30:43] Spirit man it was
[1:30:48] it was hungry for the Lord it was people
[1:30:50] that did not come
[1:30:53] and we know we have
[1:30:58] fleshes we know how to get
[1:31:00] him saying it was so many people brother

[1:31:06] Unity
[1:31:10] income right now unity love thank you
[1:31:12] holy spirit that did not have hidden
[1:31:15] agendas did not
[1:31:17] [Music]
[1:31:19] did not come to try to be known they
[1:31:23] just came
[1:31:25] just came and then the young people man
[1:31:29] these young adults these college kids
[1:31:31] this generation they're just talking
[1:31:33] about
[1:31:35] I was just floored
[1:31:38] a melody
[1:31:39] is played for our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:31:43] I was just I was just at
[1:31:47] a much she
[1:31:50] when I say humility I'm saying how much
[1:31:52] they've demonstrated
[1:31:54] they just they just wanted the Lord
[1:31:57] they just wanted the Lord and how I knew
[1:32:01] how I knew that they just wanted the
[1:32:03] Lord because they were speaking truth in
[1:32:06] love and they was just
[1:32:09] for each other they were just for each
[1:32:12] other for others there it is praise be
[1:32:15] to God I'm still having trouble putting
[1:32:17] it in words my friend I'm so thankful to
[1:32:20] the Lord that he allowed me just to
[1:32:22] experience this
[1:32:24] so thankful
[1:32:25] and all I can do is I'm going to take it
[1:32:28] in I want to take it in for my own
[1:32:31] personal growth but then also I want to
[1:32:33] take it in where then I can just allow
[1:32:36] the Holy Spirit to give me the boldness
[1:32:38] to just try to
[1:32:41] come continuously
[1:32:44] give as much as I can to others
[1:32:48] just just truly being a light to others
[1:32:51] in spite of
[1:32:53] see
[1:32:55] some people's energy and there's some
[1:32:57] some of the self-righteous some of the
[1:33:00] legalism some of the
[1:33:02] um you know just across the board man
[1:33:05] um the church has just failed I I feel
[1:33:08] like we have just but I'm not I'm not
[1:33:10] gonna live down here because we
[1:33:12] we serve a awesome God a sovereign God
[1:33:14] that that's it is in the healing
[1:33:17] business I really feel like that he's
[1:33:19] trying to wake us all up
[1:33:21] really feel like he's trying to wake the
[1:33:24] church up and say look get back
[1:33:31] you going out there and tell them about
[1:33:33] my son Jesus with the balance
[1:33:36] balance of Grace
[1:33:39] truth truth and Grace I don't know man I
[1:33:45] it's just it was just a blessing to me
[1:33:47] I'm telling you
[1:33:49] Thank You Lord thank you Jesus I'm so
[1:33:52] glad I'm able to just share this with
[1:33:54] you to you're the first person I've
[1:33:56] actually been able to to just share this
[1:33:59] with says I've been down there yesterday
[1:34:02] so anyway man I love you thank God for
[1:34:06] you I know that you're trying to walk
[1:34:08] this walk I know that
[1:34:11] you know
[1:34:14] God bless him
[1:34:16] because he went
[1:34:18] you know he wanted to see what was going
[1:34:20] on
[1:34:21] and I understand they don't look like us
[1:34:25] they don't act like us they don't talk
[1:34:28] like us
[1:34:29] but they believe in the same Jesus and
[1:34:32] something is happening among those
[1:34:35] people
[1:34:37] and am I going to say oh am I going to
[1:34:41] critique it like maybe I used to do
[1:34:44] and say well that can't be of God
[1:34:46] because of this this this and this you
[1:34:50] can always
[1:34:52] find a reason not to believe
[1:34:55] you can always do it
[1:34:58] and like I said friends I'm not saying
[1:35:00] that this is
[1:35:01] this revival that's going on in Kentucky
[1:35:03] I'm not saying that it has to be for us
[1:35:06] I'm not I'm not using anything I'm not
[1:35:10] trying to say anything other than don't
[1:35:12] condemn
[1:35:14] other than this is God moving he's doing
[1:35:17] something special and if we as a church
[1:35:23] the Tucson Tabernacle
[1:35:26] if we as a church if God starts to spark
[1:35:30] up a Revival which I think he's going to
[1:35:35] I really do
[1:35:37] but if God Sparks up a Revival
[1:35:41] things start to happen
[1:35:45] how are we going to react if it's not
[1:35:48] something that matches our way
[1:35:53] I think if there's any place brother
[1:35:55] Bobby any place I've ever been it's this
[1:35:58] place that could
[1:36:00] Put the gun down and he said he says
[1:36:03] Billy he says I'm tired of it
[1:36:05] he says he says I'm done he says lead me
[1:36:08] to this Jesus that you're talking about
[1:36:10] brother Branham said right there on that
[1:36:12] snow bank he led that man to the Lord
[1:36:16] Jesus
[1:36:17] my point in saying this
[1:36:20] guess where he ended up
[1:36:21] that you don't know this little bit of
[1:36:23] trivia
[1:36:24] it's on tape
[1:36:27] he became a deacon in a Baptist Church
[1:36:30] and brother Brown was proud of it
[1:36:33] that that man was serving the lord and
[1:36:35] doing even though joining that church
[1:36:39] not one of his churches that church he
[1:36:42] was proud to say that
[1:36:45] brother Bram said this
[1:36:48] in the sermon influence
[1:36:52] he said that we see today as Believers
[1:36:54] in the light in the hour that we're
[1:36:56] living in it's becoming it's becoming to
[1:36:59] us that we fulfill all righteousness
[1:37:00] it's becoming to a Pentecostal church
[1:37:03] that we fulfill all righteousness seeing
[1:37:05] that we have been called by the Holy
[1:37:07] Spirit
[1:37:08] it's Unbecoming that we separate
[1:37:11] ourselves from other brethren
[1:37:14] it's Unbecoming that we denominate
[1:37:17] ourselves and won't have nothing else to
[1:37:20] do with our brother who has received the
[1:37:22] Holy Ghost the same as we did
[1:37:24] it's not becoming to us
[1:37:27] when we see God moving and Performing
[1:37:31] and doing exactly what he said
[1:37:35] and because the person is not connected
[1:37:38] with our organization who is he talking
[1:37:41] to right now that's me speaking who is
[1:37:43] brother Brandon talking to our
[1:37:45] organization
[1:37:47] he's speaking to his own people
[1:37:49] he's speaking to the flock that God gave
[1:37:52] him to Shepherd
[1:37:55] who else would be listening to this tape
[1:38:02] brother Bram says this and because the
[1:38:05] person is not connected with our
[1:38:06] organization
[1:38:07] that we misbehave behave ourselves and
[1:38:11] that's unseemly that's not right we
[1:38:14] should be Christians we should be
[1:38:16] gentlemen we should be God-fearing
[1:38:18] people and Men
[1:38:21] the next quote brother Graham says this
[1:38:23] and the unfailing realities of the
[1:38:25] Living God
[1:38:26] but today we are trying to give people
[1:38:29] something that they really need and they
[1:38:31] don't want to accept it
[1:38:34] they just don't want it and the attitude
[1:38:37] of the people hasn't changed and yet
[1:38:39] that is exactly what the world needs
[1:38:40] today is the religion of Jesus Christ
[1:38:43] deliverance from the things that they
[1:38:46] are fearing and dreading and have need
[1:38:48] to be delivered of
[1:38:50] in the days when he was on Earth one of
[1:38:53] the reasons why that they could not
[1:38:56] receive Jesus of Nazareth and believe
[1:38:59] him and get their Deliverance because it
[1:39:02] was too unusual for them
[1:39:08] think about that Revival
[1:39:10] think about how many ministers
[1:39:14] how many how many
[1:39:17] what how many ministers around the
[1:39:19] country would condemn it
[1:39:22] because it doesn't fit their way of
[1:39:23] thinking
[1:39:27] because it was too unusual for them it
[1:39:30] was
[1:39:31] he brought his Deliverance God had sent
[1:39:33] them deliverance and he was so unusual
[1:39:36] to them that they didn't want to accept
[1:39:38] it
[1:39:40] because it didn't come just the way that
[1:39:42] they were used to receiving religion
[1:39:45] that's
[1:39:47] the one that means so much to us
[1:39:50] that's him speaking
[1:39:52] I see why the musicians could come and
[1:39:56] I'll close I can see why
[1:39:59] brother Branham hated the denominational
[1:40:03] spirit so much
[1:40:06] he absolutely hated it
[1:40:08] you know it's where I I listen to what
[1:40:11] he says and it's almost like God placed
[1:40:14] him on Earth to rip that thing down
[1:40:18] everything that he said he hated that
[1:40:20] denominational Spirit why
[1:40:22] because it divided people and it made
[1:40:27] people think that they were the elect
[1:40:29] that they were the bride that they were
[1:40:32] the chosen of God just because they had
[1:40:35] a name associated to them and let me
[1:40:38] tell you it does not matter
[1:40:40] I don't care if your name is Catholic
[1:40:41] Methodist or message
[1:40:44] Jesus Christ is the only one
[1:40:47] and we take that out and then we go and
[1:40:50] I feel like we do the same thing
[1:40:53] that he stood against
[1:40:56] and we cut out people a move of God
[1:41:00] against friends I'm not saying I'm not
[1:41:03] trying to promote this this Asbury
[1:41:06] Revival
[1:41:08] I'm just saying when a Revival hits when
[1:41:14] God moves
[1:41:16] it probably won't be exactly like we
[1:41:21] think it should be
[1:41:23] because it never has been
[1:41:26] and why would it be this time we got it
[1:41:28] all figured out man we got to figure out
[1:41:30] what brother Brandon's going to come
[1:41:31] back and he's going to have a tent and
[1:41:33] and then this is going to happen there's
[1:41:34] gonna be a small room and there's gonna
[1:41:35] be limbs restored and there's all this
[1:41:36] and and we got it all figured out and
[1:41:38] and then it's like okay and I'm I'm
[1:41:40] looking at my notes nope nope nope that
[1:41:43] can't be because it doesn't line up with
[1:41:45] the way I get it figured out
[1:41:47] we don't know
[1:41:49] God is sovereign
[1:41:53] he will do things the way that he's
[1:41:56] gonna do things
[1:41:57] and we just need to get in line with his
[1:42:01] program
[1:42:02] amen let's stand
[1:42:13] Jesus said I read this before
[1:42:19] John chapter 8 verse 36 he said if the
[1:42:22] son therefore shall make you free you
[1:42:24] shall be free indeed
[1:42:27] Galatians 5 1 as I read at the beginning
[1:42:29] said Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty
[1:42:32] wherewith Christ hath made us free
[1:42:34] and be not entangled
[1:42:37] again
[1:42:40] with the Yoke of bondage
[1:42:43] you've come out of it
[1:42:45] don't get tangled up with it again
[1:42:48] amen
[1:42:50] friends
[1:42:52] we are Christians
[1:42:56] God has done so much for us
[1:43:01] and we should thank him all the time
[1:43:04] but don't let
[1:43:07] the same task master that ruled those
[1:43:10] Jews in John chapter 8 don't let it rule
[1:43:14] us
[1:43:16] go with the spirit follow the spirit if
[1:43:20] it doesn't match the way that I think
[1:43:24] get down
[1:43:26] I want to get down I want to pray
[1:43:28] say Lord is this you
[1:43:31] because I don't want it to be me and I
[1:43:34] don't want to put my hand in God's face
[1:43:35] and say I don't want you
[1:43:37] and I certainly don't want to be a Slave
[1:43:40] to the God of this evil world
[1:43:44] amen
[1:43:45] let's bow our heads
[1:43:52] friends just I like to take a little
[1:43:54] time
[1:43:56] as we hear the piano play
[1:44:00] and just think
[1:44:04] just think on the things that may rule
[1:44:07] your life or my life
[1:44:13] remember that there's nothing in our
[1:44:16] lives
[1:44:18] there's no temptation that we can't
[1:44:19] overcome
[1:44:25] think about him
[1:44:29] think about how we would like to have a
[1:44:31] Revival in this city
[1:44:35] we would like to have a Revival in this
[1:44:37] church
[1:44:43] if you would like to have a Revival
[1:44:45] friends raise your hands
[1:44:48] if it's something that you desire
[1:44:50] to have
[1:44:52] just raise your hand and say Lord
[1:44:56] I would like to have a Revival in my
[1:44:58] life
[1:44:59] a Revival in my church Revival of my
[1:45:02] city
[1:45:04] Lord pour your spirit upon us
[1:45:07] foreign

[1:45:18] I pray in Kentucky and all those that
[1:45:21] have come to to be a part of the of
[1:45:23] their Revival Lord I pray that you bless
[1:45:25] each one
[1:45:28] Lord may they go back when they go may
[1:45:30] they may they go back just filled with
[1:45:31] your spirit and filled with zeal
[1:45:34] to lift up Jesus Christ before a Dying
[1:45:38] World before their Church before their
[1:45:40] friends before their school before their
[1:45:42] cities wherever they are
[1:45:44] Lord may they return excited about you
[1:45:48] about your spirit
[1:45:50] and Lord our little church right here we
[1:45:52] pray Lord that you would re Revive Our
[1:45:56] spirits
[1:45:59] Lord that you would be with us that we
[1:46:03] father would be receptive to whatever
[1:46:05] you would have to say to us
[1:46:09] Granite Lord
[1:46:11] and Lord we just thank you
[1:46:14] we thank you Father that that you have
[1:46:18] given us so much
[1:46:21] and I believe it was written in your
[1:46:23] word that too much
[1:46:25] has been given much is responsible
[1:46:29] Lord we have a great responsibility
[1:46:32] and we pray that
[1:46:34] we could handle that Lord we pray that
[1:46:36] that we wouldn't take that
[1:46:37] responsibility lightly
[1:46:40] strengthen us Lord
[1:46:42] and send your spirit to us we pray just
[1:46:45] visit us dear Jesus

[1:47:02] bless you all
[1:47:03] I'll be ministering tonight
[1:47:07] on some of the things that we're feeling
[1:47:09] going to be a little lighter service
