testimony to his oh uh please be seated i couldn't figure out why brother aaron was waving at me so the testimonies of this our friend john davis he's got quite a life his father passed away at a very young age when john was young and he ended up living on the streets and in with just the wrong crowd and with alcohol and all sorts of all the darkness that you can find on the streets and he his family knew the lord but they just saw him go and then they kept praying for him and they watched his life just turn around they watched him go from just being dark and depressed and bound up with sin to being free and happy and and now he's got a wife and a little boy and another little one on the way and he's preaching and he's just got the joy of the lord in his heart and there's just a sweetness about him and he wrote this song and i really enjoyed it so we're going to try to sing it here for you the mighty hand of god reached down [Music] the mighty hand of god reached [Music] found a slave in bonds of sin [Music] last and beaten by the life i lived and captive to the man i'd been soon delivered by the master's hand he guided me to my red sea parted waters and i walked a crawl following my savior's leaves little did i know he'd lead me to battle to fight a fight i could not win alone but with him i'd overcome [Music] the enemy surrounded me threatening defeat i thought i was to lose but i'd win battles with my jesus little did i know a bed of roses wasn't promised when he said take up your cross my yoke is easy and my burdens [Music] though we suffer much and fight on [Music] is already one with jesus fighting on before [Music] little did i know he'd lead me to battle try to fight i could not win alone but with him i'd overcome the enemy surrounded me threatening defeat i thought i was to lose but i'd win battles with my jesus little did i know little did i know [Music] he'd lead me to battle to fight a fight i could not win alone but with him i'd overcome the enemy surrounding me threatening defeat i thought i was to lose but i'd win battles with my jesus little did i know amen thank you lord for saving my soul oh thank you lord for saving my soul thank you lord for making me whole thank you lord for giving to me so great of salvation so rich and so free thank you lord for saving my soul thank you lord for making me thank you forgiving to

reach out and touch the lord as he goes by reach out and touch the lord as he passes by you'll find he's not too busy to hear your heart cry he is passing by this moment your needs reach out and touch the lord as he goes by [Music] we've got one prayer request written out this evening from brother guerra senior he says pray for my sister nora she's been having pain in her left hip when she walks and we also have a praise from brother john hall an update on his prayer request i was thinking the other day we had a big number of prayer requests not a big number of praises and i thought is is that the way it is is that do our prayer requests outnumber what we have to give praise for and i'd say no because many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivers him out of them all some of them we have to wait a while for but we know for every prayer request there's there's got to be some praise that comes of it the surgery went well for brother john hall the nerve pain and the numbness and the arms and tingling that he had for most of five years is gone praise the lord he's praying for strength to return to his legs and extremities and another praise we were we were over at the johnson's cooking last night and we were using a smoker uh and it wasn't working quite right and we had a fireball and it could have really been bad it could have hurt brother lyle or it could have hurt jonas was just right there just a little bit before that and he could have been hurt it could have caught the house on fire but the lord just let it all work out fine and it didn't even ruin the food so that was an extra blessing and then at work some things are going on just different things that could have been really bad but by god's grace they're not that bad and just some mistakes that were made and the situation and and so just thankful for the lord helping with that uh brother enoch would you come and just take the needs of the people as we sing reach out and touch the lord one more time and whatever need you have let's just stand and make it known to the lord with an up lifted hand reach out and touch the lord as he passes by [Music] you'll find he's not too busy to hear your hearts cry he is passing by this moment your needs to supply reach out and touch the lord as he goes by let's pray dear heavenly father thank you for this time to be together during the week and come and recharge thank you for all your many blessings and all that you do for us and the different incidences that happened thank you for taking care of us and may help the people that need you

really fault this service here tonight uh didn't thought brother jordan's gonna have to come and get us we'd lost our keys and uh and and finally the lord just restored that to us so we're very thankful for that amen we have something upon our heart we'd like to administer and i'd just like to preach to you tonight on a full surrender a full surrender and just look uh into the word of god and what the lord would have me to say uh sort of to end a lot of what we've been speaking especially on wednesdays and the lord just led us in this direction so we're just trusting that he has amen all things perfectly in his control and i believe that he does amen galatians chapter five and verse 1 we're just having we'll read and have you be seated stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage amen be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage turn to jonah chapter 1 and we'll just read one portion and then have you be seated to the book of jonah chapter 1. amen little hard book maybe for you to find they'll have it on the screen here just find joel daniel then joel then obadiah amos and you'll find jonah right there amen jonah chapter 1. now the word of the lord came to jonah the son of amitai saying now listen to the word of the lord arise get up arise it's always the lord what the lord says arise go to nineveh that great city and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me but jonah arose to flee to tarshish from the presence of the lord he went down to joppa and found a ship going to tarshish so he paid the fare and he went down into it to go with them to tarshish from the presence of the lord let's just bow our heads if you have a knee just raise your hand to the lord ask god to remember that here tonight lord jesus we're so grateful for your grace lord i got my hands both hands lifted up to you tonight god asking for you know the need upon my heart lord what i've committed to you now lord i pray for every hand every need every life lord that's here god for those that have gathered lord those that father may be at home streaming or wherever they're at lord we just believe that you have you you do all things well you do all things perfect lord and you you predestinated us before there was a foundation of the world lord you had us in your mind lord and our lives have been mapped out and planned out and lord the word is always perfect it always meets the need it always lord is the answer to the problem now lord may you just come tonight lord by your spirit father beyond your word may your spirit anoint the word to the speaker and knowing it to the hearer lord and may you receive the praise and all the glory meet every need in our midst we ask lord in jesus christ's name amen you can be seated we're speaking here tonight on a full surrender full surrender brother branham says here and i just have control here and i'll i'll begin here brother branham says you say you believe and haven't received the holy spirit something's wrong with your faith god circumcises the heart the minute the believer really comes in full surrender amen say that folks surely you must have done something i felt that even come back get it stop she says get it felt that come back uh when the believer here it is now when the believer firmly believes on the lord jesus christ god's under obligation to give him the holy ghost confirmation to his faith now i'm preaching to you here tonight on a full surrender i'm not going to preach on jonah jonah's life per se though we could and teach on it but we're going to use jonah as just an example here tonight and i just want to pause from this but i wanted to just read you the beginning here and we'll go back to this quote here in a moment but i want you to look here with me in jonah chapter one and just hold your place open amen to that because jonah is uh is very the book of jonah is very different than obadiah or amos or on any of the other minor prophets because the book of jonah though i'm sure he prophesied in his life he was a chosen vessel of god but jonah is very different than any other prophet because his book is not full of prophecies but instead the book is about the life of this prophet and the lord takes a lot of time and brother branham preaches a message on a man running from the presence of the lord and he and he says so much they're just uh such a masterpiece of a sermon if you haven't heard it recently i'd advise you to go and listen to it it's just wonderful but the bible begins here in jonah chapter 1 and it says and we're going to read it here again and he says in verse 3 but jonah arose to flee to tarshish from the presence of the lord he went down to joppa and found a ship going to tarshish so he paid and went down into it to go with them to tarshish from the presence of the lord so what is jonah running from in his life again preaching on a full surrender there was jonah was running from something there was there was it wasn't it wasn't his past that he was running from it wasn't the devil that he was running from it wasn't pressure from the enemy that he was running from elijah brother branham says runs from the pressure from jezebel but something very shocking and very amazing is that the bible says that jonah is just running from the presence of the lord can't imagine ever saying that about my life that i ran from the presence of god but within that presence of the lord was the will of the lord can you say amen it was the direction it was the leading of god and jonah's life it was the mission it was the purpose that god said there's something i i want you to the very first word of of jonah 1 is the bible says the word of the lord came up to jonah saying arise get up jonah go to nineveh that's an important word for a jew it's a it's a the jew has this word aaliyah which means simply to go up and a jew goes up it's a it's a going up to the house of god it's a to get up god says you you see this arise repeat it over and over and over again and especially in the old testament he says that to joshua after aiken's defeat get up joshua arise joshua we know the scripture that was prophesied to us in this generation says arise and shine for thy light has come so the message of god the word of the lord in our life has always arise it's always get up joshua why because as a believer your life is never about going down it's always supposed to be going up our life is can you can you follow me here tonight our life is always about go up get up arise it's ascension the life of serving god should be a life of dissension not descension there's no reverse gear there's no going backwards there's no even stopping and standing still a prophet of god says the minute you stop you're back sliding because there's an automatic trend there's an escalator in this world in lady asea and it's not as an ascending escalator it's a descending escalator everything is about going down so jonah's fleeing the bible says to it this word flee means to if you if you if you look up this word this greek word when it's when it says to flee it means to avoid to avoid to keep a distance from now think of the context of what the bible is saying here that jonah was avoiding the presence of the lord jonah was trying to keep a distance so once jonas god gives him a command and says arise and go to tar go to nineveh but what is jonah's reaction to what god told him he didn't say anything the bible doesn't say that jonah tries to give him a story and give him a sob story and and you know jonah doesn't try to negotiate there's no record of jonah negotiating with the lord as abraham negotiates and says if there be ten if there'd be five there's no record of even jonah trying to get clarity now we know i can teach and i got to be careful here because it's so easy to teach on jonah this was the assyrian the capital of nineveh was the capital of the assyrians who were an enemy to the jews they were one of their greatest enemies so god had already pronounced a curse and said i'm going to destroy them i'm going to wipe them off and no doubt to a jew that was the best news they could hear god was going to destroy their greatest enemy that's why jonah is as depressed and ready to take his own life when when they repent because god's saying lord are you going to wipe them out now their repentance not the result he wanted but but the bible says that he didn't say anything i want you to catch this and i got a key i'm going to keep repeating this theme of full surrender that's what the lord displaced so strongly upon my heart a full real full surrender brother branham says you say you have the holy ghost and he says but but he says you say you believe but you don't have the holy spirit said something's wrong with your faith he said because the minute not that a believer just believes mentally but when you really believe you make a full surrender to the lord the bible says that jonah doesn't he doesn't debate he doesn't contemplate he doesn't negotiate he doesn't converse he just runs he just goes the other way he refuses and he runs from the presence of the lord he avoids the presence of god he goes away what is it represented moving away from the path that god has revealed to you moving away from the presence of the lord in your life moving away from what god's called you to do from what god is convicting i don't care on what level of your life as we've been preaching to the voice of the lord is speaking to you the voice of the lord is convicting the voice of the lord is encouraging the voice of the lord is exposing sin and we as a believer have a choice to make to say i'm going to surrender to what god is telling me and notice the route that jonah's life takes notice what it says here jonah rose up follow me here in the scripture from tarshish he says jonah rose up to flee unto tarshish from the presence of the lord and he went down to joppa and he found a ship going to tarshish so he paid the fare and went down into it to go with them unto tarshish from the presence of the lord so he went down to joppa he found a ship going down to tarshish so he went into the boat and he went down and do you see the pattern here when you run from the presence of the lord you go down and you go down and your life goes down and god says to the believer your life isn't about going down it's about going up oh i just say lord jesus keep me going up i don't want to go down lord i want to ascend the bible says a fish comes along and swallows him and then jonah goes down to the bottom of the ocean down down down down god is sending jonah down to the depths the day he calls it in verse 2 the jonah chapter 2 verse 2 to the depths of sheol and this is what it means to jonah the belly of this well and let me say this to you my brother my sister when you are when you are running from a surrendered life from really surrendering everything you're going down you're not ascending you're descending spiritually the bible says then the mariners verse five then the mariners were afraid uh and and every man cried out to his god i may have the the verse here wrong and you're in chapter two sorry brother i messed you up by quoting chapter two verse chapter one it says then the the mariners were afraid and cried out cried every man i i want you to back up sorry to verse 4 so we get the context here the lord sent a great wind into the sea and there was a mighty temptus in the sea so that the ship was like to be broken verse 5 then the mariners were afraid every man cried out to his god and threw the cargo that was in the ship into the sea to lighten the load but jonah had gone down into the lowest part of the ship and laid down and was fallen asleep notice here's a here's a here's a believer the bible says these heathens are sensitive enough they're they're heathens they're not jews these are not worshippers of jehovah they're crying out the bible says every man to his own god but they know something's wrong they've realized something something something's amiss here the the storm's blowing a great wind is going but but but but now the bible says that here's here's the only vessel of the lord here's the only man who had contact with the only real true living god the heathens are crying out to their god they know something's wrong and they're crying out to their false gods while the man of god is asleep he's asleep fast asleep down jonah runs from the presence of the lord and he goes down to joppa he goes down to tarshish he goes down in the bottom of the boat and here these men are crying out to god and here's the only man here's the only man who could help here's the heathens crying out to god and here's the servant of the lord in the middle of all the calamity and the chaos jonah's just out he's out he's he's just he's there but he's not there you know you can be there but not really there you could be in church and not really there you could be in the family of god but you're not really there you could be absent you may your presence your person may be here but you jonah was absent he was in a stupor he's asleep the bible says he's asleep god says arise anyway and he gets up and he gets up but what does he do he only gets up just to run from the presence of the lord then he goes right back to sleep he goes right back to a stupor he goes right back to his slumber here these men are crying out to god and they say and cast the wares that were in the ship of the sea to lighten it of them but jonah was going down into the sides of the ship notice they're they're they're they're casting everything out they're they're throwing all the baggage out but you know what the heaviest baggage was the heaviest baggage was the man of god who was running from the presence of the lord you see when you're running from the presence of the lord you're a heavy burden to everybody else yeah a man a christian who runs from the presence of the lord who's running from the purpose of god whether he's a father and god's called him to be a godly example and a leader to those children and he's shirking his responsibility he's absent spiritually he's there physically he's very emotional he's there mentally he's there monetarily he's paying the bills but he's he's running from the calling that god has placed in his life to be a real spiritual leader that man his life if god puts a mission in his life and he runs from that calling you take a mother it doesn't matter what capacity we're serving in when we're when we when we are out of the order of god's calling in our life we are a burden to the whole situation you know i want to be careful how i say that because people could feel i just feel like i'm a burden to everybody look you know you know what then you do then arise thou that sleepest wake up it was the heathens but what's clear is that jonah jonah's he's in a stupor he's asleep he's just out of it he's just disconnected he's he's in slumber he's asleep you know we've preached on this one one other time before many months ago you know that slumber is a is a is a a spiritual condition that is referred to that would be unique to this age sleepy late lethargy now we're not talking about sleeping like some may be sleeping in church not talking about kind of sleeping or the sleeping that you're going to do tonight but the bible says there was a condition that would come in the last days that people be because of abounding iniquity because sin went about the love of many would grow cold it would wax cold first thessalonians 5 6. first thessalonians 5 6 therefore let us not sleep as do others who's us let us paul's speaking to believers therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober why brother matt why why be sober why do i get to be awake because there's a purpose there's a job to do for the believer there's a work to be done and so as we preached to you before he's saying be clear be sober be be be awake be there be present remain awake stay awake be watchful romans chapter 13 verse 11 the same exact thing you'll find he says in verse 11 of romans 13 and do this understanding the occasion the hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber pause that here for a moment brother branham says here in the message in the thigh tyrant church agent i know we've read this i want to give a warning right here i want to give a warning it says concerning the last days that because of abounding iniquity the love of many would wax cold in the lady you see in our last age now where that's the age you're in that is the age that you're in got many people preaching that we're in a bright age we are in a bright age but a bright age is not part of the church ages but you say brother matt then where are we we're still here in time now what's happened in your soul and i don't want to get bogged down on this but your soul here today you've been if you've been born of the spirit of god you're seated together in heavenly places in christ jesus yes you're not in lady asea as far as your soul goes but guess what your body is still here and the ladies in church age has not ended don't ever let anybody tell you that because here's why i know it's not even brother branham says that the church ages he says was the was the was the dispensation of the gentiles so the fullness of the gentile dispensation brother branham says happens in the ages and let me just tell you the gentile age thank god is not over yet if ladies see is over then the gentile age is over because brother adam says that's that's the the the dispensation of the gentiles happens in the latest scene brother man says what happens he says the rapture happens in the ladies and church age if if we're not in the latest in church age then we're then who's the messenger brother brandon was the messenger to the last lady seen church age i don't want to get bogged down on that here for a minute but you understand you're still here this is the age that we're in yes we've been called out of it yes christ has been put out of the church yes we're in a bright time yes we're in seed time yes you're in eagle time token time all of the above it's happening to the believer but yet our bodies our flesh that still gets a headache still gets sick still gets tired still gets angry upset depressed troubled and our spirit can become affected by the condition of this last age are you here he says he says in the ladies in her last age self-love the love for material things will take the place of the true love of god and then he says here's the warning we need here's what we need to do we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days so many are getting so hardened because they haven't realized the effect of this last day spirit and he says it's time to draw nigh to god and let him fill our lives yes lord with his love or we will fill the coldness of this last day church and reject the truth of god which alone is able to help us slumber was prophesied notice what the the scripture that you had up there brother in romans 13 verse 11 and do this understanding the occasion in other words paul's saying realize where you're living realize you're in the last church age realize that you're at the end of the end of the end this is the end of the end time that's why you'll see the church age last days referred to in in the new testament church the last days has been happening for years but let me say something brother this is the last of the last days and knowing that he says know this knowing the time for that it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed my brother my sister it is time to wake up for now your salvation is nearer than it's ever been before another parable put forth this is matthew 13 verse 24. this one just just affected me so much today when i read it now the parable put he forth to them say in the kingdom of heaven is liken unto a man who sowed good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat went his way but when the grain had sprouted and produced a crop then the tares also appeared i know the meaning of matthew 13 but i want to just take just a compound meaning out of that he says he says here let me read it one more time verse 24. kingdom heaven's like it unto men and sowed good seed in this field but while men slept there it is slumber jonah what are you doing in the bottom of the boat you got a mission jonah you've got a call you've got an anointing there's a job to do jonah and you're at the bottom of the boat sleeping you're spiritually not at your post of duty what are you doing jonah jesus says it's like your kingdom of heaven is like an into a a a a a a man who sowed good seed in this field good seed but while men slept his enemy came and sowed let me just say this to you bad things happen when watchmen fall asleep terrors are sown when when when watchmen slumber and we finally wake up only to find there's tears everywhere in our life bad things happen when watchmen but when men fell asleep an enemy comes in let me just say this to you my brother my sister satan's eden is pressing at the door sodom is pressing at the door knocking on the door it's always all around us this entire condition of this age so you got to stay alert you got to stay awake you got to stay on guard you got to stay sober for the minute you fall asleep the devil's waiting just to come into your life and your family and wreck your home and wreck your marriage and wreck your children and wreck your mind he's waiting just for a moment to have access tears are sown while we slumber i i asked myself this hit me so hard today even as a as a husband as a father and i just i said how many things and i just asked myself this question in prayer i said lord how many things in my life in my children's life in my family's life how many things do i look at today and i and i and i think oh i wish that would i wish that wasn't there and then i realized they're only a reflection of the times when i was spiritually slumbering in my life are you here can we be honest is it just brother matt or is it all you too how many things do we look at in our life and they're a reflection of those times and those seasons when we were like jonah in the bottom of the boat and then we look around and go how did this how did the how whoa whoa whoa how do we get here and then you look back and you say oh just for that one moment just for that that time i lost my focus i lost just maybe the effect a reflection of times in our life when we're sleeping ephesians 5 14 very simple simple instructions awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and christ shall give the light oh this is exactly what jonah says here in verse 10 of jonah chapter 1 then were the men exceedingly afraid and said unto him why has thou done this for the men knew that they fled from the presence of the lord because he had told them he tells them why why is all this happening man of god and then he admits it well i'm running from the presence of the lord it shows that even these men the bible says then the men were exceedingly afraid and said to him why hast thou done this i just i chuckle when i read it because i realized here's these heathens and then they're looking they're about to die they're about to get some little you know storm but a great wind and they're saying why man why'd you do this what is it they realize all of this is happening because the son of god is out of his place out of order and they say why have you done this for the men knew that he fled from the presence of the lord because he told them that shows that the men were amazed that jonah would do something like this to just completely disagree disregard to completely disregard the presence of the lord they spent their life fearing their gods they didn't understand why you don't obey your god brother brandon preached is your life worthy of the gospel you imagine what what a rebuke that hears heathens saying hey we got our gods we obey our gods who's your god you're god's the only real god really and here you are in the boat not a full story in her life i just want to catch these quotes here before we miss them if you have that brother you guys do great back there wonderful job go back and forth and back and forth listen what brother branham says here say you haven't received the holy spirit something's wrong with your faith god circumcises the heart the minute the believer really comes in full surrender brother and says we try to live by this is the approach to god we try to live by the grace of god like christians ought to live the influence set before him i note if he was lost he'd certainly walk over righteous home now he's speaking of billy brother billy paul this is who brother madam is referring to here and he says we try to live by the grace of god like christians ought to live the influence set before him i knew if he was lost now this is what brother branham's confidence was because he's seeing billy paul and he's seeing how that billy's going astray and he's just a teenage boy at this time and he's and he knows he's going to a high school brother adam tells this story here and he's going to a high school and and he's praying lord don't let him get tangled up and get in the wrong crowd to get with the wrong people and brother madam's even praying he says i'd run to my car and i'd just sit there in my car take him to school and just pray over and say god keep him god protect him oh is that not the prayer that parents pray for their children and he's praying and he says oh he says here he says i knew if he was lost he'd certainly have to walk over a righteous home to be lost by and i want him to have to walk over my life what a prayer what a desire brother adam's saying he says i want him if he's going to go that way what was the prophet of god saying he said if my child is going to be lost i want to make sure that i did everything i possibly could to set the right example in front of him and if you're going to go that way or we ought we ought to be able to say that of our children if they're going to go they better have to come through they better have to climb over a cross he says he'd have to walk over my life and he'd have to walk over the bible he'd have to walk over the blood of christ because i'll certainly by god's grace presented in front of him say lord grant that granted lord let me present it before my family before my children he says that he says i'll certainly by god's grace present it but if his nature isn't changed he will go right on just the same and how i think of the day that billy entered high school how i thought oh my and knowing that he yet he had he'd been baptized certainly but had never made a full surrender you see you can be baptized and never make a full surrender and then brother brendan clarifies consecration to christ knowing that the nature of a child yet was in him how my heart yearned for him how i pray go out in my car and ride around and say god don't let my boy get wrapped up in that kind of stuff out there how that i said god i hope i pray his mother's dead i've been both daddy and mother to him so please don't let him get wrapped up out there and get in trouble some way will you just protect him lord when you fully this is this is that let me let me stop before i before i go to the next slide brother brandon begins to tell this and he says oh he says oh if i if i could just take the time this afternoon to show he says how many times though he says how many times the holy ghost just protected billy's life one was about to take a wrong turn why because he had a praying father remember what brother what the bible says about job but per adventure job would make a sacrifice for his children and he said per adventure they do something and they need forgiveness i'm just going to go ahead i don't know what's going to i'm just going to go ahead and make that sacrifice and and and brother brandon says i could tell you says how many times explain says it's unexplainable how many times the holy spirit's just the blood of christ would just protect billy when he should have been killed one time he's drowning and he's he's in a lake fishing brother sees a vision and he's there and he says suddenly fear struck his heart he said i seen billy fell into the water i stopped and got on my knees and prayed oh god protecting and the holy spirit protected him god did that for the prophet he'll do it for you mother he'll do it for you father you don't stop praying for that lost loved one no matter what you see or what you don't see you don't stop you hold on to faith brother brandon begins to talk about this and he says he was in new albany and he and he gets a word from the doctrine and and he's and he and brother adam begins to tell this reflect from the story and he and he tells him how that uh you know something had happened to him i forget what had happened to to billy any any and he went into the hospital the doctor had given him two shots of adrenaline and he had a adverse reaction almost died the doctor actually thought he was gonna die and he says and any any and he says he says a couple days he says just a couple days before that he says i sat him down and says billy you're treading on dangerous ground son and there's a father trying to come to his child and trying to instruct him he says billy you're trading them he says you're tr you're trading on dangerous ground and he says get away from those friends that you've got now listen to me mother father you can there's there's an age and a time in your life when you control those two you can you can forcefully you know they're just they're the they're the they're the pawns on the chessboard and you're the king and mother you're the queen you tell them where to go right it's a time in your life when you have that kind of power then there comes an age where you got to let go and say lord there i've done all i can now lord i got to let go and let you i gotta i gotta let go and let you take control of their life brother brandon my wife was even testifying of that of how the holy spirit put that upon her heart and and she was you know struggling and worrying over one of the kids and just praying there after dropped him off to school and saying lord just protect them i want to as a mother you just want to add every minute you can just protect them and keep them from every evil thing but you realize you can't and you realize god doesn't want you to god wants you to you dedicated them as a baby you gave them back to the lord you do everything you can to protect them and she was praying and she said lord and she said you're just an overwhelming fear grip to heart it says lord i love them so much but i can't be there to protect them holy spirit quickener and says you love them as a mother and they're your ch and you love them like that as your children how much more don't forget that's my children too and she said the holy spirit just put a peace over heart said don't you forget that's my child too you think i'm not going to protect them aren't you thankful for that kind of mercy pray for your family pray for your children god says don't forget they're mine too i'm not praying i'm not protecting them just because you asked me to i'm protecting because that's my child that's my daughter that's my son and brother branham says he says he told him he was warning him said billy you're on dangerous ground get out of that company that you're in he says the lord the lord just showed him the night before brother madam says they're standing there in the room if and he says i just the holy spirit began to tell him what was going to happen to him he said i seen you billy you jumped out a window and he says and you were falling back your heels were straight up and he says he's falling head head was this way and just gonna crush and hit the ground he says you know he says your body just begin to flip over and over going through space and he says the holy spirit just said billy you've got to get away from those friends you got now brother madam could have said now no you're not you know and could have just cracked the whip and forced it but now billy's at an age where brother madam says he knew he couldn't control it but all he can do was warn him all he could do is pray for him all he could do is all he could do is commit him to god brother and says well you know you'd say you think well you know i'm sure man i'm positive after that you know after brother brandon told him he's seen a vision and after brother adam told him he seen him up flipping over in and he just fell to his death oh man i'm sure brother billy paul just turned around brother madam says no he says being a kid he just kept going i love that kind of honesty don't you he says being a kitty he just kept on kept on didn't listen and he says then here he comes and now he's now something's happened he's rushed by an ambulance and just as brother branham just as god showed him in the vision and here he's in brother adam says he goes to the hospital and the doctor says oh i just about killed your son billy and he says that he reacted he didn't know didn't know why he said he just reacted to to something adversely and he says and he says we billy we brought two specialists in we're trying to get him you know trying to stabilize him and they didn't know they thought he was gonna pass away thought he was gonna die and and and brother branham says oh is this trying you know he says me here's me just trying to be a father you know his mother's passed away so just trying to do everything i can be a father be a mother be a friend minister the gospel be a minister of the gospel and he says then he says and he says and i i said all right doc he says you you're you're my friend you did the best you could you imagine how helpless you you'd feel you just felt helpless because you you knew you gave him the warning and now he's on his deathbed he says all right he says doc he says you know you've done the best of good said uh he and me so the doctor said i didn't know billy i didn't know he'd be allergic to it i've even give it to him before and he says and and and brother branham says you know he says the doctor begin to he says begin to tell him that and he says and he says i don't know what happened and he was wringing his hands at the doctor brother madison begins to say it was he was nervous even trying to tell him they said we were best friends i think this was sam i think dr samadera as i believe who the doctor is and he says he's ringing his hands he's nervous he's billy i tried everything i i didn't mean to i didn't mean to do this we've given him to him before and he's just such a nervous wreck and and here's billy laying unconscious and he and and he started down the hall and and brother branham says he says doc can i see him and he says well we we've we've got tubes all in him you know you don't want to see him like brother man and says can i he says but if you want to you know go right ahead so brother adam slipped in real easy and brother branham says i just watched where he was laying there unconscious any any and he says uh he says i pulled down they said close the door behind me there was just as he says his face just as black as it could be his eyes were set back they were pumping respiration gurgling tube through his nose and everything his tongue out his mouth way back and his eyes just as black as they could be i thought there he is i doubt down i thought god will you take my only boy will you take him lord since i've packed him on my arm i i know lord children you understand i pray that you'll help him just as quietly as i could before god and he says an almighty god who is my judge here before this sacred dest this afternoon approaching him through jesus christ the son of god his own son who died to save mine and while i was in prayer he repeated that vision again i seen his feet and head flying around and around he was going down and down turning like that in the vision which was just a few nights before and i seen two arms reach out and catch him just like that and started bearing him back up like that in a few moments i looked up billy looked and said daddy where am i where am i i said everything is all right son i went around there doctor standing there talking to the intern i waited till he left i put my armor on doc i said it's all over doc he said do you think he's going to make it i said he's already done made it jesus christ has touched him hallelujah what was it it was brother branham's approach to god here's a man who has a fully surrendered life and he says i committed him to god now let's in your hands lord notice it when the vision here's billy following it wasn't fi wasn't brother branham's arms reaching out and grabbing billy it was the lord jesus's arms falling and catching him and what is god saying you've got to take your hands off of it sometimes because when they fall it's not going to be you there to catch them it's not going to be mom it's not going to be you it's going to be the lord jesus there to grab a hold of them brother and begins to talk about that and he and he says here he says oh he says knowing but but but he says i knew that he hadn't made a full surrender to god but you know you know you know who had made a full surrender daddy had made a full surrender we need parents with a full surrender to god we need a church with a full surrender to the holy spirit they say lord you know i've let go of everything lord i'm completely surrendered in the token when you fully obey the word of god in full surrender to it you're entitled to the token yes there are obedience not he that saith the lord but he to do with the will he says a man ready for the present lord but if you're a true christian truly cold like jonah was god had already got your fare paid get off that ship going to tarshish anyhow god predestinated you to this life yes sir if you're a true cold child of god come to christ come into the fullness of him notice the fullness of him you may have came to christ but if you came into the fullness of him and he says he says your way is paid to where it's paid to nineveh not the tarshish you're predestinated your ship there's a ship leaving right now on its road there's only one thing to do is get on it what is that ship full surrender you know and we're gonna we're not gonna be too much longer but you you think of that word surrender you you know what what does it even mean we raise even even when we raise our hands brother adam says what is it he says it's a sign it's a universal sign of surrender you know the enemy hey my hands are up i'd have nothing i'm you'd walk the police officer tells you to put your hands up you put them up what are you doing you're surrendering it's a full surrender you don't hold one hand down you don't halfway go up it's a full surrender you want to let him know i'm completely surrendered what is i in literally the word surrender means to give something up your rights you may give something up you may surrender something to another person but it means to relinquish something that you have right what are you doing when you're surrendering you're relinquishing something that you have but you've decided to surrender it and so what is a full surrender to god brother adam says america it's all about people's rights and he says but when you're really born of the spirit of god you get a lamb nature and what does a lamb do a sheep he says it gives up its rights hope you catch that he didn't say that the sheep doesn't have any rights but it surrenders its rights are you here are you still awake here tonight it surrenders its rights it gives it up it's giving something it's a surrendered life and you say what is a surrendered life it's the it's when a believer gives something they have it's when a believer takes something and they give it to the lord jesus they surrender their life to him say what do i surrender when i surrender to the lord you surrender control you surrender your ambitions you surrender your plans you surrender your goals you say brother matt my goals i gotta give that up yeah you surrender your dreams my dreams yeah you got to surrender those to the lord if now that's if you want to fully surrender you see that's a choice i want to make sure you catch this here because it's the burden of my heart it's your choice god says i'm not going to take it i'm not going to force it you've got to choose to give it to me what do i surrender you surrender my my dreams yep yep gotta surrender you're my my what about what about my plans yeah you gotta surrender all your plans you got to surrender your possessions because now everything is his anything else yeah in fact the most the the main thing you gotta surrender is your entire life you gotta surrender your life you gotta give not just your money not just your time not just your dreams you don't just give that you give your life that's what a surrendered life is an act of giving back to the lord what he's granted to you your dedicated baby god's given that child to you but you give it back you're surrendering it back you're you're giving rights you're saying lord you have all my rights you have all my power all my direction whatever you say i do i'm going to resign for my life and i'm going to give it you say i'm just going to give it i'm just going to i'm just going to lose it no no jesus says he that loses his life shall gain it you're giving back and even even you find what the lord jesus even as we preach on his humanity he's 100 percent god 100 man what brother loud preached here sunday night in his own humanity even he had to surrender even he had to live a life of full obedience a full surrender to the word of god to the to the to the direction of his heavenly father the bible says in john 6 you still love him can i have just a couple more minutes he says in john 6 38 jesus says i came down from heaven not to do my own will this is this is john 6 verse 38 you know this one very well he says for i came down from not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me he says in chapter eight he says not to have my own glory not to seek my own glory so he says in in in john chapter 8 verse 28 i do nothing of myself i do nothing of myself but as my father hath taught me i speak these things look what verse 29 says it's emphasized and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me alone for i do always those things that please him you know what you know what the lord is showing us what a surrendered life looks like you surrender i do only that which would that which pleases the father see brother matt do you do that no i don't but in the bottom of my heart i say lord grant it to me let me do only that which pleases you lord i only do that which pleases the father he says he he notice what he says here and remember this assumed this is a 100 human his own humanity brother branham says he had to get past his own will his own desire what was the death he died prophet of god said he really died in gethsemane think about that just for a moment he really died in gethsemane the cross was the victory you know what the cross was the cross was just the victory it was it was the celebration of the battle that he won in gethsemane because the bible says what happened that gethsemane the garden of gethsemane it means the the olive the mount what was it it was the it was the crushing of what of he didn't he wasn't crucified there in in gethsemane his flesh wasn't but brother branham says his mind and his ambition and his desire he won the battle the greatest battle ever fought when he won the battle over self-will and he says if it be possible lord let this cup pass from me nevertheless my not my will be done but thy will be done lord i believe that you're catching it here tonight and john 10 verse 17 therefore doth my father love me because i lay down my life that i might take it again therefore doth my father love me because i lay down my life that i might take it again no man listen to what lord says no man taketh it from me but i lay it down of myself what is a full surrender when you can say no one forced me to do this no man takes it from me but lord you didn't you didn't force me but here's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna gladly lay it down lord i'm going to lay down my ambition i'm going to lay down my own life that's a full surrender when you can say no man taketh it from me but i of my own self and he says i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it again this commandment have i received of my father and you know who also has the power the lord left that power in your hands i'm speaking of a surrender here he says i'm gonna i'm gonna give you free moral agency you make a choice i'm choosing he says i no man taketh it from me but i lay it down of myself even had a choice he had a choice at a choice to as brother branham you remember the danny henry in the prophecy he says he says because thou has chosen the harder way because thou has chosen the harder way and he re-emphasizes this was of your own choosing you made this choice because of that a great portion of heaven awaits you because you chose and it's my way what was the emphasis on it this is your decision this is your choice this is not it didn't force you and what is the surrendered life when god really when you really surrender to the lord you give away yourself it's it's it's it's you relinquishing what is a surrender brother man how do i surrender to the lord you give up you say i lay down my life the privilege i have i choose a surrendered life no one's forced no one's pushed but you yield yourself to it you yield yourself to the holy spirit you yield yourself in prayer you yield yourself to the power of god you say lord i'm giving it to you i don't have to but i want to there's something in my heart i want to lord i want to i i i make this choice i i make this choice let me just say this to me to you my brother my sister you go as deep in in god as you want to go or you'll stay as shallow as you want to be notice what he says here this was even this goes further you say it was just jesus well that's not possible you know we're not jesus that was the you're speaking of well there's also a man named saul there's a man named saul who persecuted the church here's here's paul who's persecuting christ he he hated christians the man who was so self-elevated self-educated had such a high education he was he was he was persecuting the church and the bible says that he's he's he's a no doubt a learned man even paul speaks of that of himself i was on education ambitious he's he's climbing to the top you know he was just he was the he was the pharisee of what he calls of pharisees educated trained zealous and he says if any man labored he says not not more than me paul says no more not more than i it says i i was a pharisee of the pharisees paul was and paul was going his own direction his own way his own mission is all his own life everything was planned out knowing where he was going but yet the holy spirit one day knocked him off of his high horse you know what god has to get to you to come to a surrendered life sometimes he's got to knock you off your horse and paul hits the ground saul hits the ground and a light appears what is what is god doing god's taking this self-willed self-independent self-driven this man who was who was a a self-directed and he takes that highly esteemed educated man and he and he breaks him he breaks him of his human will and and he becomes one of the greatest examples of a man who has a surrendered life to the holy spirit who's completely surrendered to the purpose of god in his life he becomes one of the most surrendered vessels and he goes from independent to god-dependent he goes from man-filled to god-filled he goes from self-willed to god-willed he goes from self-led to god-led he says in first timothy 1 16 for this cause i obtained mercy that in me first jesus christ might show forth all longsuffering for a pattern this is first timothy 1 16 to them which should hear after believe own him to life everlasting god does something so great in his life the bible says here he's he's going on his own way on the road to damascus and then god a blinding light comes from heaven and he's knocked to the ground it says saul saul why persecute us thou me the holy spirit has a way only a way that only the holy spirit can do to humble us god has a way to humble us my dad has a famous saying it's it says you yourself if you're a child of god you either humble yourself or god will humiliate you to humble you and the bible says the bible says notice but here was here's he was such a such a a humiliating a humbling that paul comes out of it blind can't even see now here's a man who's led by his own two eyes you you imagine this what is it a sign of god's going to take all the leadership out of his own life now he's got to be led now he's blind the bible says in verse chapter 9 of acts verse 6 it says trembling and astonish paul said lord what will you have me to do no more self will no more self ambition no more what i'm gonna do he's just a blind man being led and says lord you know this is a sign the first act of a surrendered life when you can lose all your pride you could lose all of your all of you listen to me friends we've all got pride and pride is one of the most it's pride we have a all of us have a blind spot to pride it's one of the greatest blind spots brother arne we're fellowshipping about it today one of the greatest things christians are blind to you can spot pride in someone else but boy we're blind to it in our own self we fail to see it fail to see that that that that many of the times notice here here was paul in his own pride and the bible says god knocks him off of his high horse takes away all of his pride trembling and astonish paul says verse six lord what will you have me to do the lord said unto him arise there's that word get up get up and go into the city and shall be told thee what thou must do here's this highly educated pharisee of pharisees and now he's dumbstruck he's blind he can't even walk without being led takes him from here and god crushes him you say brother matt why would god do that because paul god needs to use paul and god's going to use him one of the most powerful greatest ways when paul can come to a surrendered a full surrender to god and god brings him to such a full he's a chosen vessel and god brings him to such a a low state in his life god's leading this high pomp high uh prestigious man to a life of surrender and he says lord what would you have me to do sometimes we just need to ask that quit trying to figure it out quit trying to figure it out and say lord what do you what will you have me do lord here's here's a question you asked to the lord how what can i do to please you lord what can i do to please you today lord you know when you ask that you know when you can ask that when nothing else matters that's when you can ask that when nothing else to you matters in your life of what you wake up in the morning and when nothing matters about that day except for what is going to please the lord that's when you can say lord what can i do today to please you because that's all that matters i just want to live a life that's pleasing to you does your heart say that tonight lord i just want to do whatever pleases you whatever pleases your holy spirit lord the bible says he has chosen me in verse 15. brother let us close here he is he is a chosen vessel unto me the lord said to him go that way phrase a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the gentiles and kings and the children of israel for i will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake you know this is where a real surrendered life leads to and this is why so many people don't choose it you're going to surrender your life paul

just a few minutes longer amen than we want to be i'll get that right i promise you i don't like going so long i hope i didn't go too long here tonight did you appreciate the word do you appreciate the lord isn't he wonderful wonderful wonderful isn't jesus [Music] clap your hands ears have heard what's recorded in god's word isn't jesus wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful it's in jesus my lord wonderful well eyes have seen ears have heard what's recorded in god's word isn't jesus my lord wonderful isn't he wonderful wonderful wonderful isn't jesus my lord yes you are lord tell us have seen ears have heard what's recorded in god's word isn't jesus my lord wonderful one more time isn't he wonderful wonderful wonderful isn't jesus my lord wonderful brother peter i have seen heirs have heard what's recorded in god's word isn't jesus my lord wonderful man i'm just reminded here you can keep playing that just for me before we go before brother peter come and sing amen we have two things uh one was the sunday school and so just be keep that upon your heart keep that before the lord in prayer and then we have some things here that we're not able to establish or structure here so lord willem when i come back uh when i return i want to have a meeting amen and we're gonna we're gonna officially announce our what we're gonna be doing uh so i'm gonna be um i'm gonna be looking for the leadership of the lord will you pray say lord will you lead brother matt amen make the right choice for us and so i believe it's important lord put that upon my heart and so we want to do that um the second thing i'm trying to remember what the second thing was oh i wanted just to make this announcement that um and i know we we reiterate it we reiterate it we reiterate i want to just say it again thank you amen for your patience uh darren covid and the the way we've had to do rose and we've had to socially distance and the masks and all of all of the effort that's been put forth there and you know i i can just say this i just from uh from the from the brothers the ushers the deacons who's maybe at times especially on sunday morning who has to have to move us maybe move you around move you to a different seat i promise you they don't do that to upset you to move you out of your seat you've sat in for so many years or where you're comfortable in they're trying to do their best to accommodate the guidelines that we've set forth for them to do so i just i ask you for your grace amen the attitude of a christian if you get moved if you're asked to move hey no one's perfect except me no i'm just kidding none of us are perfect here not even the deacons believe it or not and sometimes then we may move you and move you to a spot and you think well they shouldn't then that it wasn't better would have been better than this well you know those brothers are doing their best amen and and i i just want to say i appreciate all of those brothers who help to usher and to see people try to get it right um we want to and and and brother ed is going to make an announcement concerning this but i just want to go ahead and preempt it by saying we're gonna we're going to do some little small changes um in the way we're doing seating right now um with the back few rows for mothers with small children and we want to reserve those back just the back two rows there for mothers with small children now you may have teenagers and then you also have a small child and that's perfectly fine that family would be perfectly fine to sit there in those back couple rows but we want to do that because they would have to maybe get up and go out and to cause the least amount of distraction amen we want to do that i'd encourage now i wouldn't force this force anybody to do it i'd encourage the young people especially the brothers sit up on the first few rows [Music] no i'm not going to make anybody do that i don't want anybody to make anybody do that but i think you young men you'd receive a blessing from that leave your children receive a blessing from that stay closer brother and even talked about that he said the anointing of god comes from the pulpit flows down and the closer you are the closer you are the more you feel it i promise you the closer you are the less distracted you are now i'm not talking about being right up here in spitting range but if you're back there you know in the front couple rows there and you're up close amen i i believe it does something good especially for young people so uh you know but if a family feels they want their child to sit with them maybe on the back row and you're there and you have a small child i understand that that's perfectly fine and we're not going to disrupt any of that but we would like the last two rows to be reserved for mothers with small children amen and then from there we'll distance we also have some other things we've got the johnsons here the roberts we've got big families sometimes it's hard to see an entire family on one row so we've got some plans for that i'm not gonna uh say anything i'll leave that for brother ed um but who's gonna make an announcement concerning that you love the lord raise your hand if you do say lord i love you amen praise the lord brother peter sing for us god bless you you're dismissed and may go in the fear of the lord we'll see you next time come expecting amen this weekend with brother isaiah isn't he wonderful wonderful wonderful [Music] eyes have seen ears have heard what's recorded in god's word is in jesus my lord wonderful let go and let god have his wonderful way [Music] forward have his wonderful way let go and let god have his way
