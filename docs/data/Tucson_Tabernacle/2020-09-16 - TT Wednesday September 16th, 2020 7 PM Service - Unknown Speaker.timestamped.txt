[43:13] malachi 4 we're going to read verse 5
[43:16] and verse 6 behold i will send you
[43:18] elijah the prophet
[43:20] before the coming of the great and
[43:23] dreadful day
[43:24] of the lord now that's specific he's
[43:27] referring to the day of the lord

[43:36] of the fathers to the children and the
[43:40] heart
[43:40] of the children to their fathers lest i

[43:55] we're glad
[43:56] elijah came in our generation amen and

[45:50] and the omega the first and the last and
[45:52] what god was going to do in the first
[45:54] he would repeat in the last and that's
[45:57] prophesied in the bible
[45:58] but i want to continue with this first
[46:00] ephesian age

[46:22] sort of uh we'll have to make do that's
[46:24] all right well just pull up the one that
[46:25] you do have we'll start there
[46:27] brother branham says and he's speaking
[46:29] of that age he says that cycle of
[46:30] revival and death
[46:32] has never failed and he says all you
[46:35] have to do is recall this last move of
[46:37] god
[46:38] in the spirit when men and women dress
[46:40] like christians went to church
[46:41] prayed all night took to the street
[46:43] corners and weren't ashamed of the
[46:45] manifestations of the spirit
[46:47] they left their old dead churches and
[46:50] worshiped
[46:51] in homes or old store buildings
[46:55] and then he says they had reality
[46:58] and that's just a statement he makes
[47:00] they had
[47:02] reality but it wasn't too long
[47:07] a time until they begin to get enough
[47:09] money to build fine new churches
[47:11] they put in a choir instead of singing
[47:14] to god
[47:15] for themselves they put on put gowns on
[47:18] the choir they organized a movement
[47:20] and ran it by man they soon to begin to
[47:23] read books that weren't fit to read they
[47:25] let down the bars and the goats came in
[47:27] and took over
[47:29] the cry of joy was gone the freedom of
[47:32] the spirit was gone
[47:33] oh they kept on with a form
[47:37] but the fire had died down and the
[47:40] blackness of
[47:41] ashes is about all that was left
[47:46] you're and brother brandon begins to
[47:48] speak here natalie he
[47:49] turns to this uh to this
[47:53] modern age and this is in the seven
[47:55] church ages
[47:56] that brother adams preaches in 1954.
[47:59] brother branham begins to say he says
[48:00] you're in a lukewarm age
[48:02] your evangelists are crossing the earth
[48:05] thank you that's the next one
[48:06] praise the lord we got it the next slide
[48:10] keep going to slide number 14. you're in
[48:13] a lukewarm age
[48:14] and your evangelists are crossing the
[48:16] earth around the earth preaching
[48:18] things like that you'll get nowhere
[48:20] you're hollering
[48:21] you baptist are hollering a million more
[48:23] in 44.
[48:25] what have you got when you got them just
[48:28] a bunch of sinners come in with their
[48:30] names on the book
[48:31] billy graham had that and brother
[48:33] branham refers this many times you'll
[48:35] hear him on the tape
[48:36] 30 000 converts and said in six weeks
[48:40] later he couldn't find 30. why
[48:44] why they never got nothing to start with
[48:48] just a bunch of sinners when they put
[48:50] their name on the book
[48:52] notice this under the spell
[48:55] of a revival they never got nothing to
[48:59] start with
[49:00] they they were just sinners and they put
[49:03] their name on a book
[49:04] and he refers to the billy graham
[49:06] meetings you know
[49:07] massive archer altar calls billy graham
[49:09] said he have thirty thousand and come
[49:11] back and won't have thirty
[49:12] the prophet of god begins to relate this
[49:14] because we know that just as that first
[49:16] age
[49:17] ended that ephesian age ended so very
[49:20] differently than how it started
[49:23] and now brother branham is going to
[49:24] begin to point to the
[49:26] to the the most recent revival which was
[49:29] the pentecostal revival
[49:31] and he points to that most recent
[49:33] revival and he says you know it starts
[49:35] off so good the fire
[49:37] is lit again and he says there's revival
[49:39] fires burning and
[49:40] there's a reality there god had done
[49:42] something very real as we spoke last
[49:44] wednesday
[49:45] the restoration of the gifts was a move
[49:49] of the holy spirit
[49:50] though it started and it turned into
[49:52] something very
[49:53] opposite of how it started the prophet
[49:56] of god said it was a
[49:58] framework it was something god used
[50:01] to further the church and brother adam
[50:05] says but you don't throw the
[50:06] you don't throw the framework out you
[50:08] keep the framework
[50:10] you don't throw it out but it was a
[50:11] framework and the prophet begins to
[50:13] point to that pentecostal age
[50:15] that pentecostal revival uh
[50:18] that starts under daddy seymour and
[50:21] welch and 1906 azuza street
[50:24] and he begins to point to that same
[50:26] revival and it was those same churches
[50:27] that had accepted his ministry
[50:29] a lot of the doors he uses that to
[50:31] preach you go and visit the
[50:33] life tabernacle in arkansas you you
[50:36] visit the
[50:37] uh the the church in in los angeles uh
[50:39] three or four
[50:40] major pentecostal churches that had
[50:42] opened their doors to the prophet's
[50:44] ministry
[50:45] and now he's coming to this place and he
[50:47] says you're in a lukewarm age
[50:48] and he begins to recall and he says he
[50:51] says why
[50:51] why why would you have a revival why
[50:54] would you have all these people that
[50:55] came to the meeting they gave their life
[50:57] to the lord
[50:58] and only just six weeks later they can't
[51:00] find 30 brother madam says why is that
[51:02] because
[51:03] they never got anything to start with
[51:06] you say well then what did they get
[51:08] they were under the spell
[51:11] of a revival it's pretty powerful when
[51:13] you think about it
[51:15] that within a real move of
[51:18] god there is a spell that people can
[51:21] fall under
[51:25] a lot of times people can come to get an
[51:28] emotional experience but never get the
[51:30] real thing
[51:32] and that that spell will hold them for
[51:35] so long
[51:37] even even for years an emotional
[51:39] experience can
[51:40] can stabilize and help you but listen to
[51:42] me brother and sister we need
[51:44] more something deeper than that that
[51:46] holds the individual
[51:48] no matter what they go through
[51:51] he says they were under the spell of uh
[51:54] revival
[51:54] now listen how he begins to relate this
[51:56] again and he says
[51:58] he says it's been very strange in our
[52:01] homelands
[52:02] here i know that's hard to see but just
[52:06] he says it's been very strange in our
[52:08] homelands here the people it certainly
[52:10] has alarmed my
[52:12] emotions to see of the coldness
[52:17] and the indifference that the church is
[52:20] becoming in
[52:22] north american continent in our country
[52:23] in canada also
[52:25] and then he goes back in his memory he
[52:26] says a few years ago i came into canada
[52:29] here and and and had a meeting now here
[52:32] he's in saskatoon
[52:34] he's in the same building he's in the
[52:35] same city he's in the same place
[52:38] but something has changed from the
[52:41] memory he's about to relate
[52:42] he says just a few years ago i came in
[52:45] here in canada here he had a meeting the
[52:46] tinsel was all over the meetings people
[52:48] was gathered to places
[52:49] where the newspaper had to report of
[52:51] people driving as many as
[52:52] 3 000 miles by taxi cab
[52:56] just to be in the presence of the
[52:59] outpouring of the spirit
[53:03] and tonight after much advertisement
[53:06] trying to cooperate with everybody
[53:08] showing the same spirit that we did when
[53:10] we first come
[53:11] yet it's hard to get a little group of
[53:14] people to fill a little small
[53:16] arena like this then you could wonder
[53:19] why it is that a minister's hearts
[53:21] are alarmed so what was he
[53:25] seeing there now this is just not just
[53:27] uh him just relating something
[53:29] and one spot we could read you quote
[53:31] after quote when brother adam starts
[53:33] saying that
[53:34] he he makes comments and he says now
[53:35] listen to me pentecost
[53:37] stand at your post of duty tonight and
[53:39] he says you there that were that you
[53:41] know that seen the revival fires burning
[53:44] he said but where are you at tonight and
[53:46] he says you better destroy delilah
[53:48] before she destroys you
[53:50] you better destroy your enemy before
[53:52] your enemy destroys you and he
[53:54] makes that statement over and over and
[53:56] over again
[53:59] he comes to this place here in the same
[54:01] message and he says now brother tommy
[54:02] osborne the next slide
[54:04] told me that my minister if i've come
[54:05] here in tokyo this coming summer he'd
[54:07] expected at least two or three million
[54:08] converts
[54:09] ministry lord has given me seemed like
[54:11] it went over the head of educated people
[54:12] in the lands where they still have it's
[54:14] not taught
[54:14] they believe that god is real we've
[54:17] accepted him
[54:18] a mental conception they have but he
[54:21] says
[54:21] they have to have reality and when they
[54:24] see it
[54:25] that settles it tens of thousands
[54:27] swarmed to christ in one altar call
[54:30] and the same message the same effort
[54:32] that we put forth
[54:34] and maybe 200
[54:38] 300 whatever it would be here tonight
[54:42] now you see he's alarmed here he says
[54:44] over there in another country it fills
[54:45] up
[54:46] thousands of people and he says but we
[54:48] got the same message
[54:49] the same exact thing and he says and
[54:51] just two
[54:52] you know 300 people he's looking at
[54:54] numbers saying what's happening
[54:56] you know what what what's taking place
[54:58] through whatever would be here
[54:59] where maybe five or six tonight may come
[55:03] to christ
[55:05] where with the same effort across the
[55:06] sea would bring a hundred thousand to
[55:08] christ see
[55:09] that's the difference the revival
[55:13] has left our country we might as well
[55:17] just face it
[55:21] he goes on and he says here in the same
[55:23] it's a pitiful
[55:25] sight but why does this happen friend
[55:27] it's because that this
[55:28] condition has to come there's an atomic
[55:32] bomb laying yonder to settle the
[55:33] difference and that's right god can't
[55:35] pour out his judgments upon a just
[55:36] people it's just the hour
[55:38] there's nothing that can stop it all the
[55:39] preaching i can do all the resurrection
[55:41] christ could show
[55:42] everything will never stop it the bible
[55:44] said but here's what we're responsible
[55:46] for
[55:46] giving a voice against the wrong that's
[55:50] right
[55:51] i can never stop ladies from wearing
[55:53] little old vulgar clothes
[55:55] it's the nature uh the next slide it's
[55:58] the nature of them
[56:00] they already seen it the devil presented
[56:03] it they were subject to it i could never
[56:05] stop men from drinking
[56:07] certainly not i could never make the
[56:09] church spiritual
[56:11] all the preaching i would do it would
[56:13] never make it spiritual
[56:14] but there'll be one glory he says but
[56:18] there'll be one now
[56:20] and then that's a fish god wants him in
[56:21] the kingdom i'll give my voice
[56:23] i don't know who it is but i'll preach
[56:25] it and as i preach it
[56:27] he'll hear for all the father has given
[56:30] me
[56:30] will come to me that's right
[56:34] say brother matt what does it mean what
[56:36] do we do the churches
[56:37] it gets colder the numbers get thinner
[56:39] the crowds get smaller what do we do we
[56:42] keep preaching
[56:43] and we keep preaching and then one will
[56:45] hear it here and maybe one will hear a
[56:47] hearing surrender their life to christ
[56:49] because all the father has given me will
[56:51] come to me
[56:55] we could continue on if you put up my my
[56:57] newest one that i sent you tonight
[56:59] brothers the the other powerpoint
[57:01] so notice what brother brandon begins to
[57:03] say here
[57:04] any any and he says he says this is this
[57:08] was what was happening with
[57:09] that revival he says it was going on now
[57:12] what's so amazing about the culture even
[57:14] that we live in today and i'm just going
[57:16] to take my time
[57:17] with some of this here tonight if we
[57:19] don't get to get to it next
[57:20] wednesday i read an amazing statement
[57:23] you can just hold that screen up there
[57:26] i read an amazing statement by a
[57:29] theologian a man and he says
[57:31] he says we as christians in the western
[57:35] world
[57:36] are limited and suffer because we have a
[57:39] western
[57:40] understanding and perception
[57:43] and a western education and and he says
[57:47] the reason for this he says
[57:49] and when he was relating why we we have
[57:51] sometimes a hard time understanding
[57:53] spiritual things and he says a western
[57:56] education system is based upon greek
[57:59] philosophy and it's not based upon
[58:02] hebrew thinking but the bible was not
[58:04] written on greek philosophy
[58:06] the bible was written on hebrew thinking
[58:09] hebrew understanding a jehovah
[58:12] understanding a jehovah education can
[58:14] you say amen
[58:15] and so the difference between a hebrew
[58:18] understanding
[58:19] and a greek understanding is that greeks
[58:22] have trouble uh tying the natural
[58:25] with the spiritual now i want to see
[58:28] what my first is i want to make sure i
[58:29] got the right
[58:30] slide here before you display it uh yeah
[58:33] no we'll just hold that so just hold
[58:35] that screen there
[58:36] so a a a western education system is
[58:39] based upon
[58:41] greek philosophy and so the difference
[58:43] is is that greeks can never
[58:45] tie the natural into the spiritual to
[58:48] the greek
[58:49] they're not in any way whatsoever
[58:52] connected you have the natural
[58:54] and you have the spiritual but there's
[58:56] no connection between
[58:58] uh either one it's sort of like a deist
[59:01] who you know believes in god but
[59:03] believes he has no
[59:05] inner workings in in daily life in in
[59:07] the lives of of creation
[59:09] but the the greek theology our thinking
[59:13] is
[59:13] that there's no way that they're
[59:15] connected but here's what brother
[59:16] branham taught us
[59:17] the natural always types the spiritual
[59:21] and he says it's always that way you
[59:22] look at nature he says that you you
[59:24] watch how nature runs
[59:26] all nature i love this so much because
[59:28] it it just blows the minds of
[59:31] such simple uh teaching and it just
[59:34] blows the minds off of a high
[59:36] thinking uh theological mind oh nature
[59:40] runs in continuity
[59:42] and then brother madam would go to the
[59:43] seed and he would begin to look at life
[59:45] he'd begin to look at nature that's why
[59:46] he was a hunter why he loved to be
[59:48] outdoors because he learned about god
[59:51] in the woods in nature and he learned
[59:53] about spiritual things by
[59:55] looking at natural things you follow me
[59:57] and so the hebrew says our god
[1:00:00] who is spirit the god the great god
[1:00:03] uh elohim the self-existing one
[1:00:07] that great spirit created everything
[1:00:10] that's natural so everything that's
[1:00:13] natural whether it's science whether
[1:00:15] it's
[1:00:15] medicine whether it's uh a nature
[1:00:19] uh uh a climate uh a seasons
[1:00:23] all of it was created by god all of it
[1:00:26] was created by the lord
[1:00:28] the earth is the lord's and the fullness
[1:00:30] thereof
[1:00:31] so everything within the earth is the
[1:00:33] lord's
[1:00:35] and so the natural and physical we learn
[1:00:37] from the message of the hour the natural
[1:00:39] and the
[1:00:40] the physical and the spiritual run very
[1:00:42] close together
[1:00:44] and so you notice the the man was making
[1:00:47] the point he says but the western theo
[1:00:48] western way of thinking uh has sometimes
[1:00:51] from that western view
[1:00:54] it affects us into thinking that any
[1:00:56] physical event
[1:00:57] can't have a spiritual effect it's very
[1:01:00] much like
[1:01:01] uh people have today with water baptism
[1:01:03] and you have
[1:01:04] most mainstream churches you know have
[1:01:08] uh have just you know chalked up baptism
[1:01:11] into
[1:01:11] well it means nothing it's really just
[1:01:13] uh it becomes more of an ordinance or
[1:01:15] just we do it because we the bible said
[1:01:17] we do it
[1:01:17] but it has no effect whatsoever now we
[1:01:19] know that baptism doesn't
[1:01:21] uh is it isn't uh regeneration it
[1:01:24] doesn't
[1:01:24] you can go down a as they say a dry
[1:01:27] center come up a wet center
[1:01:29] but but we know that there's that
[1:01:31] brother adam said everything that you do
[1:01:33] naturally
[1:01:33] can have an effect in the spiritual
[1:01:35] world
[1:01:36] and so they they've chalked up baptism
[1:01:38] i'm just using this as one example we're
[1:01:40] gonna go to many more
[1:01:42] they've chalked up baptism as ah you
[1:01:44] know it's not really necessary and
[1:01:46] and that's why it doesn't well then if
[1:01:48] it's not really necessary then it
[1:01:49] doesn't really matter
[1:01:50] how you're baptized you know
[1:01:53] they they it doesn't really matter you
[1:01:55] know we've debate we've had a
[1:01:57] conversation with a local
[1:01:58] baptist pastor there back home of a
[1:02:01] massive church
[1:02:02] thousands of thousands people he took an
[1:02:03] entire series on why baptism isn't
[1:02:05] important but they still baptize
[1:02:08] and they still and so i asked the man i
[1:02:10] said well then i guess it doesn't matter
[1:02:12] if someone wants to be sprinkled oh no
[1:02:13] no no we would never sprinkle some we
[1:02:15] believe in immersion i said well
[1:02:16] why does it matter baptism doesn't
[1:02:18] matter
[1:02:20] suddenly it doesn't matter if it's the
[1:02:21] name of the father he said well if
[1:02:23] someone comes to me and says
[1:02:24] he says i baptize people in the name of
[1:02:25] the father son of the holy ghost he says
[1:02:27] someone comes to me says hey will you
[1:02:28] baptize me in the name of lord jesus
[1:02:29] christ i'll do it he said it doesn't
[1:02:30] really matter i said well then if
[1:02:31] someone comes and says
[1:02:32] sprinkle me oh no i wouldn't do that
[1:02:36] i said well it's suddenly not that
[1:02:38] important
[1:02:39] you know when it's the name but if it's
[1:02:42] if it's the process
[1:02:43] immersion you know what it is is they
[1:02:46] can't see how
[1:02:48] something and i'm just going to come to
[1:02:50] this here the bible is full of a
[1:02:52] correlation
[1:02:53] between the physical and the spiritual
[1:02:57] you think of naaman who the bible says
[1:02:58] had to dip seven
[1:03:00] times to be killed of leprosy why why
[1:03:03] would naaman have to go in because there
[1:03:05] was a
[1:03:05] physical act was going to have a
[1:03:07] spiritual consequence in naaman's life
[1:03:12] you notice when jesus was to heal a
[1:03:14] blind person he
[1:03:15] the bible says he spit into the dirt and
[1:03:17] then he took that dirt and he
[1:03:19] he rolled it up and he put it on the
[1:03:20] man's eyes and the man's eyes came
[1:03:22] you know he could see it why was it
[1:03:24] because something
[1:03:25] natural was going to have a spiritual it
[1:03:28] was going to have
[1:03:29] an effect so you can you can see how
[1:03:31] that a
[1:03:32] a jew a hebrew thinking of how that
[1:03:35] burying
[1:03:36] and washing someone in in a bath of
[1:03:39] water can clean them on the
[1:03:41] outside it can wash the conscience as we
[1:03:44] baptize sister debbie
[1:03:46] sunday and i said what is this doing
[1:03:48] it's a it's a
[1:03:49] it's a it's grace for dirty people
[1:03:53] it washes your mind it's a fresh start
[1:03:56] it's something you're doing
[1:03:57] you know and you say whether it's uh
[1:03:59] whether it's public
[1:04:00] you know we do it publicly but it's not
[1:04:02] about everyone watching you think of was
[1:04:04] it
[1:04:04] uh i think it was philip who baptized
[1:04:06] the eunuch in the bible
[1:04:07] and the bible says it was no one but
[1:04:09] philip in the eunuch no one was there
[1:04:12] to watch except the baptized and the
[1:04:14] baptizer
[1:04:16] but you know who was watching heaven
[1:04:21] that's the only audience that really
[1:04:22] needs to take witness of your baptism
[1:04:26] and i'm glad jesus was watching can you
[1:04:28] say amen
[1:04:29] and so you notice this in the bible you
[1:04:32] ask this question
[1:04:33] do you receive the holy ghost by
[1:04:34] physical act well the answer is yes
[1:04:36] and no you notice that in the bible
[1:04:40] many people received the holy ghost
[1:04:42] after a physical act took place like
[1:04:44] laying on their hands now we know that
[1:04:45] was because it was the hebrew way of
[1:04:46] thinking
[1:04:47] laying upon their hands even after they
[1:04:48] baptized them so do you mean
[1:04:51] does it mean that we don't believe in
[1:04:53] physical laying on of hands of course
[1:04:54] not brother branham said in 1965
[1:04:57] he said he still believed in laying
[1:05:00] hands on the sick
[1:05:01] by the by the the order of the bible of
[1:05:04] the book of james
[1:05:06] lay your hands upon the sick and they
[1:05:07] shall recover
[1:05:09] or danny minister by the lady known as
[1:05:11] the prophet of god said he believed in
[1:05:13] all of that
[1:05:14] you know people like to categorize and
[1:05:16] say well you know we don't believe in
[1:05:18] you know it's got a gentile faith you
[1:05:20] know is just to accept that it's true
[1:05:21] gentile faith is just
[1:05:22] say the word i'm a romans and jury and
[1:05:24] there's men if i say it he goes and he
[1:05:26] said jesus if you'll just speak the word
[1:05:29] and he says no greater faith have i
[1:05:30] found in all of jerusalem than this
[1:05:32] brother madam said what is it he says we
[1:05:33] have faith we're the faith seed we just
[1:05:35] accept it
[1:05:36] we don't have to have some physical
[1:05:38] event but it's brother matt that means
[1:05:39] that we shouldn't
[1:05:40] physical events can't happen that's not
[1:05:42] at all what it's saying you know what i
[1:05:44] love
[1:05:44] the prophet of god says he says he says
[1:05:47] god
[1:05:48] will meet you. at whatever level of
[1:05:51] faith you have
[1:05:55] man that makes it so good he
[1:05:58] he prays for a woman and and and
[1:06:01] she's struggling about whether she has
[1:06:02] the holy ghost or not and brother and
[1:06:04] praise and in his prayer you hear me
[1:06:05] says
[1:06:06] lord he says now i know because of the
[1:06:08] sign this woman's born under
[1:06:09] she needs she needs something to happen
[1:06:12] he says
[1:06:13] the lord will you now now what he
[1:06:15] doesn't say is now my sister
[1:06:16] you ought to just have better faith here
[1:06:18] you're seeking some physical experience
[1:06:19] speaking in tongues or some kind of
[1:06:21] sensation you know sister you should
[1:06:23] just you know whether
[1:06:24] you know we believe the message well you
[1:06:26] know i i i can't believe brother man
[1:06:27] doesn't do that at all he stops in
[1:06:28] praise and he says lord now the sign
[1:06:30] that she's born under
[1:06:31] he says she needs something to anchor
[1:06:33] her faith he says so lord
[1:06:34] give her something
[1:06:37] say brother brandon what does that mean
[1:06:39] it means god will meet you
[1:06:41] at whatever level of faith if you only
[1:06:43] have just this little bit god says i'll
[1:06:45] take that
[1:06:48] don't you just love him it's whatever
[1:06:51] level of faith you have
[1:06:54] god will meet you at that
[1:06:58] level we believe in spiritual worship
[1:07:03] but we also believe in physical worship
[1:07:05] that's why we raise our hands in church
[1:07:09] it's a physical act that has a spiritual
[1:07:12] consequence brother said what is a sign
[1:07:16] of surrender you're surrendering to the
[1:07:17] holy spirit
[1:07:19] we believe in clapping our hands it's
[1:07:21] it's we believe in
[1:07:22] singing with our voices not like in
[1:07:25] california california governor says just
[1:07:27] hum
[1:07:27] we don't believe in humming we believe
[1:07:29] in singing
[1:07:31] because it does something when the when
[1:07:33] the when the redeemed of the lord
[1:07:34] say so with their mouth that they they
[1:07:38] something comes out of them it's it's
[1:07:40] it's more than just a
[1:07:42] something that you think in your mind
[1:07:43] but something physical has
[1:07:45] a spiritual we we play music we have
[1:07:48] pianos we have instruments we have
[1:07:50] gifted singers we have people that sing
[1:07:52] you say why is that for the man we just
[1:07:53] fulfilled a religious duty no
[1:07:55] we're making a physical act so that
[1:07:58] heaven will hear and something
[1:08:00] spiritual will take place
[1:08:03] is that what we want we use our bodies
[1:08:07] the bible says
[1:08:08] present your bodies
[1:08:11] as a living sacrifice which is your
[1:08:13] reasonable service
[1:08:15] we believe in the body we we give our
[1:08:18] bodies we use our bodies to worship god
[1:08:20] the bible new testament is full of
[1:08:23] people who lifted up holy hands
[1:08:25] clapping shouting to god what are they
[1:08:27] they're physical
[1:08:28] acts that have a spiritual effect
[1:08:32] baptism is a physical act that can have
[1:08:34] a spiritual effect
[1:08:37] people say i don't want to do anything i
[1:08:38] don't you know i don't want to do
[1:08:40] you know anything with my body uh you
[1:08:42] know i just want to worship in the
[1:08:43] spirit
[1:08:44] but the the bible says the hebrews
[1:08:46] worshiped god
[1:08:47] with their bodies they danced before the
[1:08:50] lord
[1:08:52] they they clapped before the lord they
[1:08:54] sang
[1:08:55] before the lord so we physically do
[1:08:58] things because they have a spiritual
[1:09:00] effect
[1:09:03] and so you say i'm just going to and the
[1:09:05] lord just directed me to go this way and
[1:09:07] it was just perfect timing we
[1:09:09] had a baptism on sunday every christian
[1:09:12] needs two baptisms
[1:09:16] one in water one in spirit
[1:09:19] and until you receive the second baptism
[1:09:22] you're not born again
[1:09:24] now where we get in trouble with this is
[1:09:27] some people say well
[1:09:28] you know after you're baptized then
[1:09:30] you've got to go through this training
[1:09:31] period
[1:09:32] and then maybe i don't know three weeks
[1:09:33] four weeks maybe six
[1:09:35] prophet of god said that that it doesn't
[1:09:37] have to be he says people
[1:09:38] people live in varying degrees of
[1:09:40] sanctification you remember that
[1:09:42] statement
[1:09:43] and he said they've never they've came
[1:09:45] out of egypt but they've never crossed
[1:09:47] in over jordan into canaan
[1:09:49] and he says they live in this varying
[1:09:51] degree of sanctification they're not
[1:09:53] really ever born of the spirit of god
[1:09:55] they're clean but they're empty
[1:09:58] and brother branham says for some and
[1:10:00] i've watched for some that process
[1:10:02] can be years
[1:10:05] and they go from one revival to the next
[1:10:07] revival they go up
[1:10:09] and then they go down and then they go
[1:10:10] up and then they go down
[1:10:12] once they're in once they're out brother
[1:10:14] adam says but but but but in the house
[1:10:16] of cornelius
[1:10:17] while peter yes spoke these words all
[1:10:19] three
[1:10:20] justified sanctified filled with the
[1:10:22] baptisms of the holy ghost
[1:10:23] just like that prophet of god says we
[1:10:25] don't have to go to terry in jerusalem
[1:10:27] up in an upper room and waiting on the
[1:10:29] holy spirit it's
[1:10:30] as you speak the word you believe the
[1:10:32] word
[1:10:33] god quickens that faith to your heart
[1:10:37] and it can happen just like that
[1:10:45] water baptism cleans you it washes you
[1:10:48] but it doesn't
[1:10:48] fill you it leaves you clean and empty
[1:10:52] and let me just say this a a a clean
[1:10:55] christian
[1:10:56] who is empty is in a very dangerous
[1:11:00] spiritual condition in fact more
[1:11:03] dangerous than before they were clean
[1:11:05] they were better
[1:11:06] full of the devil dirty than clean
[1:11:09] with nothing in them
[1:11:13] some of the most miserable christians
[1:11:15] you'll ever meet
[1:11:17] are those who are clean crystal
[1:11:20] clean just
[1:11:23] couldn't put a spot on them but they're
[1:11:25] empty
[1:11:27] jesus warns and he gives us a warning he
[1:11:29] says it's
[1:11:30] dangerous to clean your life up
[1:11:33] and to wash everything and wash your
[1:11:35] entire life but to leave it empty
[1:11:38] because you get one demon out and the
[1:11:41] bible says that when the spirit
[1:11:42] leaves when an unclean spirit leaves a
[1:11:44] man it goes into
[1:11:46] dry places and he says and it gets seven
[1:11:49] more spirits
[1:11:49] worse than the first and he says and he
[1:11:53] comes back to the house
[1:11:55] and he finds it swept clean
[1:11:59] crystal what is that that sanctification
[1:12:01] you kicked everything out
[1:12:03] everything's out you but what jesus is
[1:12:05] pointing to
[1:12:06] is a legalistic uh legalism where you
[1:12:09] get all your
[1:12:10] all your eyes are dotted all your t's
[1:12:12] are crossed everything's clean
[1:12:13] everything's swept everything's empty
[1:12:14] and jesus says but he findeth he findeth
[1:12:17] that it's an
[1:12:17] empty house and he takes those seven
[1:12:20] spirits and he brings now
[1:12:22] he had one to start with now he has
[1:12:24] eight
[1:12:26] and jesus says and the condition of that
[1:12:29] man
[1:12:30] is worse than when he started
[1:12:36] and it's vital that once we are cleaned
[1:12:40] we get filled
[1:12:44] that's why you find in the bible as soon
[1:12:46] as they were baptized in water they laid
[1:12:48] hands on them
[1:12:49] that they might receive the holy spirit
[1:12:52] what a miserable spot to be in clean
[1:12:55] clean crystal clean but empty
[1:12:59] because you have no pleasure in sin and
[1:13:01] no joy from salvation
[1:13:04] you're caught in the middle are you here
[1:13:07] tonight
[1:13:10] religion and i'm going to preach a lot
[1:13:12] on this before we close
[1:13:13] religion is dangerous let me go further
[1:13:17] religion is blinding but the prophet of
[1:13:19] god said one of the
[1:13:20] strongest spirits to break
[1:13:23] is not a demon spirit of alcohol it's
[1:13:25] not a demon spirit of drugs it's not a
[1:13:27] demon spirit of pornography
[1:13:29] or or you know some you could think the
[1:13:30] most horrible the prophet of god said
[1:13:32] the most
[1:13:33] hardest demon spirit to break is a
[1:13:35] religious
[1:13:36] spirit
[1:13:39] hello there's such a
[1:13:42] difference such a disparity such a
[1:13:46] distinction
[1:13:47] between religion and relationship
[1:13:53] sometimes jesus says that comes out with
[1:13:55] seven more spirits
[1:13:57] and a lot of times the reason why the
[1:13:58] man's condition is worse is because
[1:14:00] those seven spirits are religious
[1:14:02] spirits and it leaves the man in a worse
[1:14:05] state than before he was cleaned up
[1:14:08] because now he's religious now he's got
[1:14:10] something and brother branham says the
[1:14:11] heart is spirit you could break as a
[1:14:12] religious spirit
[1:14:13] because they're right you can't tell
[1:14:15] them anything
[1:14:18] so it's important you say brother matt
[1:14:19] what's important not just to get cleaned
[1:14:21] not just to get the spirit out not just
[1:14:25] to get let me just make it real
[1:14:26] practical
[1:14:28] it's important to get cleaned
[1:14:31] absolutely it's important but not just
[1:14:34] to get
[1:14:34] sin out of your life but to make sure
[1:14:37] you get filled with something besides
[1:14:41] sin
[1:14:44] not just to get sins out of a person's
[1:14:47] life but to see he gets filled with
[1:14:49] something else
[1:14:50] or let me say it better someone else
[1:14:55] because that's what you need is someone
[1:14:57] not something
[1:14:58] and people look for some things they
[1:15:00] find church they find
[1:15:02] doctrine they find intellectual doctrine
[1:15:04] and they study the message they study
[1:15:06] and what is it it's an intellectual
[1:15:08] spirit they get a lot of religion
[1:15:09] but they don't get the person i'd rather
[1:15:12] know the author than his book before
[1:15:14] brother branham said
[1:15:16] because nature hates a vacuum
[1:15:20] nature hates a vacuum and human nature
[1:15:24] hates a vacuum so if you're just
[1:15:28] clean but empty that's a very dangerous
[1:15:30] spot to be in you become
[1:15:32] what i call a negative christian
[1:15:35] i don't smoke i don't drink i
[1:15:38] i don't cut my hair i don't curse i
[1:15:40] don't do any of those kind of things i i
[1:15:41] don't
[1:15:42] i don't do that i don't i don't go to
[1:15:43] their movies i don't do this and i don't
[1:15:44] i don't i don't i don't i don't i don't
[1:15:46] i don't i don't
[1:15:49] but you you don't but what you don't do
[1:15:52] but what do you do
[1:15:56] what a way to live they don't have as we
[1:16:00] said they don't have pleasure and sin
[1:16:02] they don't have pleasure of salvation
[1:16:03] they're locked
[1:16:04] in the middle and what does the bible
[1:16:06] call the middle
[1:16:07] the wilderness they're out of egypt
[1:16:10] they're dying in the wilderness
[1:16:13] because all in all deep down in the core
[1:16:15] of their heart they're longing for
[1:16:17] the leaks and the garlics they're
[1:16:19] longing for egypt they never came into
[1:16:21] the experience of the baptism
[1:16:23] of the holy ghost now this is what the
[1:16:25] lord just led me to minister so i'm just
[1:16:27] going to keep on
[1:16:29] you get all the bad things out but none
[1:16:31] of the good things come in to take its
[1:16:32] place
[1:16:35] so one life one baptism cleans your life
[1:16:38] one fills your life one cleans you from
[1:16:40] the past
[1:16:42] and one fills you for the future
[1:16:45] and so we're dealing with the person who
[1:16:47] has repented they've believed they've
[1:16:49] been baptized
[1:16:50] but there's something more than
[1:16:51] repentance there's something more than
[1:16:53] baptism
[1:16:54] there's something more than that they've
[1:16:56] died with christ they've been buried
[1:16:58] with christ but now they need to be
[1:17:00] raised with christ to a new life and you
[1:17:04] say brother matt what does that come
[1:17:06] from from pentecost
[1:17:11] which people immediately freeze up and
[1:17:13] say well
[1:17:14] did you mean to say that but that's
[1:17:15] exactly what i meant to say
[1:17:18] because it's it's what is pentecost it's
[1:17:20] an experience
[1:17:23] what happened 2000 years ago
[1:17:26] wasn't just a historical event but it's
[1:17:29] to be repeated in
[1:17:31] every believer that's why paul said i am
[1:17:33] crucified with christ
[1:17:35] i'm buried with him and so i'm raised
[1:17:38] with him brother madam says when you rey
[1:17:40] when he raised you raised in newness of
[1:17:44] life
[1:17:47] and so the prophet of god begins to say
[1:17:48] this now notice what he says about this
[1:17:50] first church and this is what's
[1:17:52] this is where we wanted to come to you
[1:17:54] know it's amazing because
[1:17:56] we we we asked this question we read
[1:17:58] ours opening scripture malachi 4
[1:18:01] i'll send you elijah the prophet before
[1:18:03] the coming of the great and dreadful day
[1:18:04] of the lord and he shall turn the heart
[1:18:06] of the fathers to the children
[1:18:07] and the heart of the children to their
[1:18:08] fathers lest i come and smite the earth
[1:18:11] with a curse so why let me just
[1:18:14] start here by saying why a message why
[1:18:17] an elijah
[1:18:19] why a prophet what was on god's heart
[1:18:22] what was on his mind what was the need
[1:18:25] of the people what would the condition
[1:18:27] be of the church
[1:18:28] why a restoration why a prophet why an
[1:18:31] elijah
[1:18:32] and and so one of the major purposes uh
[1:18:36] to give us the bible and we can just ask
[1:18:38] some rhetorical questions here
[1:18:40] well you know was the message coming to
[1:18:43] give us
[1:18:44] uh uh you know a greater understanding
[1:18:46] of the bible
[1:18:47] was it coming to give us doctrines
[1:18:50] was god concerned because we wouldn't
[1:18:52] know who melchizedek was
[1:18:54] and he was so concerned i'm just going
[1:18:56] to cindy line just so they know who
[1:18:57] melchizedek is
[1:19:00] was it so that we could understand the
[1:19:02] seals
[1:19:04] what was it was it so that we could the
[1:19:07] message came
[1:19:08] so that we could all know what took
[1:19:10] place
[1:19:11] in the garden of eden and that that's
[1:19:13] that's all it was that's what god was
[1:19:15] concerned about
[1:19:16] that god was so concerned we wouldn't
[1:19:17] know who the horse rider was of
[1:19:19] revelation the white horse rider
[1:19:21] and so god was going to send a message
[1:19:22] to make sure that we knew
[1:19:24] well you say brother matt what is it it
[1:19:26] could be it could it's it's
[1:19:28] me for many purposes you could give
[1:19:29] purpose after purpose after purpose
[1:19:32] but let me just say this what i find
[1:19:35] it's essential
[1:19:37] to understand why god sent
[1:19:41] a prophet we know he needed to send
[1:19:44] a prophet for the elected
[1:19:49] but what was the elect in need of
[1:19:52] knowledge
[1:19:53] intellectual knowledge so that we are
[1:19:54] smarter than the baptist and smarter
[1:19:56] than
[1:19:57] in this group over here are more
[1:19:58] intellectual we understand more about
[1:20:00] the bible than them
[1:20:01] was it a name did we need a name a new
[1:20:04] denomination to name ourself we
[1:20:06] we needed something to be called so
[1:20:07] we're called message believers
[1:20:09] let me let me just give you what the
[1:20:10] bible says it was for
[1:20:12] in the book of job chapter 2 it says
[1:20:15] tell your children
[1:20:17] and your ch let your children tell their
[1:20:18] children and their children another
[1:20:20] generation
[1:20:21] that which the palmer worm has left half
[1:20:23] the locust eaten
[1:20:24] and that which the locust has left half
[1:20:27] the canker worm eaten
[1:20:28] and that which the canker worm hath left
[1:20:30] half the caterpillar eaten but
[1:20:32] ver chapter 2 verse 25 says and i
[1:20:35] will restore people
[1:20:39] so full of the glory of god till they
[1:20:41] shouted and spoke with other
[1:20:44] languages and went and martyrs for the
[1:20:47] faith
[1:20:47] let's earnestly contend for that
[1:20:51] faith until death shall set us free
[1:20:55] earnestly contend for that boy that's a
[1:20:58] speech there
[1:21:00] heard a lot of great politicians get a
[1:21:02] nation risen up and you know can get an
[1:21:05] army or you win some churchill it gives
[1:21:07] a powerful speech
[1:21:09] and an entire nation comes at the
[1:21:11] anointing of that speech
[1:21:12] let me give you this speech if the
[1:21:14] presence of the living god
[1:21:16] abroad of pentecost with power with
[1:21:18] signs with wonders brought a people so
[1:21:20] full of the glory of god until they
[1:21:22] shouted and spoke with other languages
[1:21:24] went became martyrs for the faith and
[1:21:26] let's earnestly contend for that faith
[1:21:28] until
[1:21:29] death shall set us free how many can say
[1:21:32] amen
[1:21:34] if god brought forth his first branch
[1:21:37] out of that
[1:21:38] vine was a pentecostal branch with power
[1:21:41] visions revelations healing
[1:21:43] sanctification holy spirit
[1:21:45] the next branch will be
[1:21:49] the same thing
[1:21:52] certainly will every time every time
[1:21:54] that vine puts forth the branch it'll be
[1:21:56] exactly
[1:21:58] like the one was at the first
[1:22:01] place the martyr stood there without a
[1:22:05] bat of his eye
[1:22:06] he knowed where he was standing he know
[1:22:08] who he had believed he was able knowing
[1:22:10] this that god could raise him up
[1:22:12] the last day because he promised it
[1:22:14] before he'd bowed down to any man-made
[1:22:16] oldie old dirty rag sap lines he'd die
[1:22:19] on that stump
[1:22:21] brother and says hallelujah let me die
[1:22:24] the same place if my god doesn't come in
[1:22:28] my generation
[1:22:29] i'll die on the stump where the
[1:22:31] cankerworms eat it
[1:22:32] believing that jesus christ and his
[1:22:35] church
[1:22:35] and his word is the same yesterday today
[1:22:39] and forever oh if brother branham were
[1:22:41] here that's exactly what he'd preached
[1:22:43] to you
[1:22:44] jesus is still the same yesterday today
[1:22:47] and forever
[1:22:49] i might not be able to produce it out in
[1:22:52] all these branches because old sap lines
[1:22:54] come out here of denomination and creed
[1:22:56] cut me off
[1:22:56] and drop me like a hot potato that might
[1:22:58] be true but i'll stand
[1:23:00] loyal on the stump and cry that the
[1:23:03] hour will come god will restore
[1:23:06] his church to its former condition
[1:23:13] this is just a turn but i want to read
[1:23:15] it from the lacie in church notice this
[1:23:17] now this messenger of malachi 4
[1:23:18] revelations 10 7 is going to do two
[1:23:20] things
[1:23:20] one according to malachi 4 he will turn
[1:23:23] the heart of the children to the fathers
[1:23:24] two he will reveal the mysteries of the
[1:23:27] seven thunders in revelations 10 which
[1:23:28] are the revelations which
[1:23:30] are which are a lot of people don't like
[1:23:33] that but that's what the messenger said
[1:23:36] he said he will reveal the seven
[1:23:38] thunders in revelations 10 which
[1:23:40] are the revelations contained in the
[1:23:42] seven seals
[1:23:46] it will be it will be these
[1:23:50] divinely revealed mystery truths
[1:23:54] that literally so something very
[1:23:57] physical
[1:23:59] that literally notice that
[1:24:02] literally turn the hearts of the
[1:24:03] children to the pentecostal fathers
[1:24:07] a lot of people have focused on the
[1:24:09] mystery truths
[1:24:11] and not the result that the mystery
[1:24:13] truth was to bring
[1:24:16] the focus wasn't the mystery it was what
[1:24:18] the mystery revealed would do to a
[1:24:20] people
[1:24:23] it would literally turn their heart to
[1:24:25] believe
[1:24:26] in the god of the bible to say lord if
[1:24:29] you did that there you're still the same
[1:24:30] here
[1:24:31] if you if i could find an example there
[1:24:33] brother adam said god is no respecter of
[1:24:35] persons what is that
[1:24:36] that's apostolic faith to say lord if
[1:24:39] you can
[1:24:39] heal then you can heal now if you could
[1:24:42] deliver then you can still deliver now
[1:24:44] if you could feel with the baptism of
[1:24:46] the holy ghost you could still do it
[1:24:48] lord
[1:24:51] he says exactly so the pentecostal
[1:24:53] fathers
[1:24:54] he says he turns this abraham's covenant
[1:24:56] confirmed
[1:24:57] he turns the heart of the children back
[1:24:59] to the faith of the pentecostal fathers
[1:25:02] so it'd be back to the original message
[1:25:06] you'll know when it gets here it'll be a
[1:25:08] restoration to send that lukewarm ladies
[1:25:10] in church to the original faith back
[1:25:12] yonder
[1:25:13] again and this time he's to take that
[1:25:16] same
[1:25:16] faith because they got away from the
[1:25:18] original faith he's going to turn the
[1:25:20] faith of the fathers of the children
[1:25:22] back you know except for the matt why
[1:25:23] are you
[1:25:23] why are you reading all this he's going
[1:25:25] to turn the faith of the fathers and
[1:25:26] children back to the father's the
[1:25:27] pentecostal fathers another acts 2.
[1:25:30] why because i find it's so amazing to me
[1:25:32] that people who believe the message yet
[1:25:34] they have no
[1:25:35] idea the purpose of why god sent a
[1:25:38] message
[1:25:41] we've made it so many other things
[1:25:42] listen to me brother and sister
[1:25:44] as i've said this here before it does
[1:25:46] not matter what i say the message is
[1:25:49] it does not matter what you say the
[1:25:51] message of the hour is
[1:25:52] it doesn't matter what i tell you the
[1:25:54] bible is you know what the bible is the
[1:25:56] bible is what the bible is
[1:25:59] the message is not what anybody makes it
[1:26:02] it's not what any
[1:26:03] group makes it and a lot of people have
[1:26:06] made it something that it was never
[1:26:08] intended to be
[1:26:10] the message of the hour is the message
[1:26:12] of the hour it speaks for itself
[1:26:17] and people don't they they they they
[1:26:21] they believe the message but they have
[1:26:22] no idea this was the purpose
[1:26:24] do you realize this was the heart of god
[1:26:27] to turn
[1:26:28] your heart back to bible faith
[1:26:32] not to 1906 people get scared when you
[1:26:34] say message was to restore us to
[1:26:35] pentecost oh no
[1:26:36] he's taking us back to pentecost back to
[1:26:38] the denomination back to speaking in
[1:26:39] tongues back well it may be that
[1:26:42] but we're not pointing you back to azusa
[1:26:43] street we're pointing you back to the
[1:26:44] book of acts
[1:26:46] the alpha church because the omega would
[1:26:50] reflect the alpha the first
[1:26:52] and the last what god did in his first
[1:26:54] church he wants to do in all the ages
[1:26:59] pentecostal faith you say what is it
[1:27:01] brother matt is it
[1:27:02] is it is it speaking in tongue it could
[1:27:05] be that that's part of it
[1:27:07] absolutely that's part of it oh that's
[1:27:10] the least of the gifts then what you're
[1:27:12] saying is you don't even have the least
[1:27:13] of the gifts
[1:27:17] people are so quick to say that have you
[1:27:18] ever spoken in tongues no it's the least
[1:27:20] of the gifts well then you've never even
[1:27:22] had the least of the gifts
[1:27:24] does all speak with tongues well paul
[1:27:26] made it clear no
[1:27:28] not everybody does but that does that
[1:27:30] mean that tongues is something of
[1:27:31] yesterday no god still
[1:27:33] speaks a nuns brother adam says that if
[1:27:34] you ever go deep enough in prayer i
[1:27:35] believe you'll speak in tongues
[1:27:39] i i'll just i'll give you a a let me
[1:27:41] just if anything to
[1:27:42] to increase your faith i'll give you you
[1:27:44] know just a brief
[1:27:46] uh not even really a testimony because
[1:27:48] it take too much time to tell it
[1:27:51] i'll just say that you know the lord in
[1:27:53] my prayer closet
[1:27:55] many times uh now but the very first
[1:27:58] time
[1:27:58] was just one of the the most i would
[1:28:00] just say that i'll say it this way the
[1:28:02] lord
[1:28:02] took me in prayer and uh and just was
[1:28:05] praying
[1:28:06] and just really seeking the mind of god
[1:28:08] for certain things just
[1:28:09] asking god uh uh just just to just for
[1:28:13] for something specific very specific in
[1:28:15] my life
[1:28:17] and was just praying and just in my
[1:28:19] prayer closet there
[1:28:21] forget how long i had prayed you know
[1:28:22] i'd been in the prayer closet for for a
[1:28:24] long time forget how i
[1:28:25] just forgot about time and just begin
[1:28:27] you know that feeling
[1:28:28] you know you pray and and i'll just be
[1:28:30] honest with you tonight many times you
[1:28:32] pray
[1:28:33] most of the time that you're praying you
[1:28:35] know you're not feeling any kind of
[1:28:36] lightning bolts or flashes or anything
[1:28:38] spiritual necessarily but you know
[1:28:40] you're communing with your heavenly
[1:28:42] father
[1:28:42] you know you're listening because the
[1:28:44] bible said he would listen when you pray
[1:28:46] that's how i know because the bible said
[1:28:48] so
[1:28:49] jesus loves me this i know for the bible
[1:28:51] tells me so
[1:28:53] the bible says we're here this is our
[1:28:55] confidence that when we
[1:28:56] pray he heareth our prayers i don't need
[1:29:00] any other answer than that
[1:29:01] i don't need a handwriting on the wall
[1:29:02] the bible says he listens and so he
[1:29:04] listened to my prayer
[1:29:07] and i just got to that point very
[1:29:09] special and unique sometimes you pray
[1:29:11] and then other times you pray through
[1:29:13] maybe it's more rare than the
[1:29:15] you know the times when you're just
[1:29:16] praying it seems very natural
[1:29:19] you know as we've said here before
[1:29:20] serving the lord most of the time is a
[1:29:22] very natural feeling experience
[1:29:24] but there's sometimes god does something
[1:29:26] very special and i remember
[1:29:27] praying there i had a leather chair
[1:29:29] there and just in front of me and was
[1:29:30] just holding on to it and i just
[1:29:32] remember i felt the holy spirit
[1:29:34] just it moved beyond my words and beyond
[1:29:37] beyond praying
[1:29:38] and suddenly i just felt a presence just
[1:29:40] drop into the room
[1:29:42] and i knew that's the holy spirit it's
[1:29:44] right there right now
[1:29:45] and i remember when that moment happened
[1:29:47] i grabbed the leather i literally just
[1:29:49] grabbed it maybe even damaged the chair
[1:29:52] i'm not sure
[1:29:53] but i grabbed the chair and i felt like
[1:29:55] i was i felt like
[1:29:57] like like jacob that's what i felt like
[1:29:59] i'm not leaving until you bless me
[1:30:02] i felt like lord now i've got you here
[1:30:04] now i'm going to plead my case with you
[1:30:06] i know your presence is in this room and
[1:30:07] i grabbed a hold of it i said lord i've
[1:30:09] got to have an answer from you
[1:30:11] and just at that very moment that's the
[1:30:13] last thing i spoke in english
[1:30:15] just out of nowhere the angelic tongue
[1:30:18] and started praying in that
[1:30:19] tongue and and it seemed like the more i
[1:30:22] spoke in that tongue the less i could
[1:30:23] try to get back to my english language
[1:30:26] and the more it
[1:30:27] more and more until i finally just felt
[1:30:28] like it took over my whole body
[1:30:30] and found myself in the corner of that
[1:30:32] office
[1:30:34] corner in that office just in a fetal
[1:30:36] position over in the corner
[1:30:37] and and every time i'd open my mouth
[1:30:39] it'd come out in a different tongue
[1:30:41] and then i felt the holy spirit the
[1:30:43] angel of the lord just come down right
[1:30:45] there in that room
[1:30:46] let me just let me just testify to you
[1:30:48] that was the
[1:30:50] most unearthly experience i've ever had
[1:30:54] in my life
[1:30:57] you know what it did to me it brought me
[1:30:59] closer to the lord
[1:31:01] it was the most supernatural experience
[1:31:04] i've ever had
[1:31:06] and i and then after that i remember
[1:31:08] i'll never forget after that
[1:31:09] and it's happened many times since then
[1:31:11] the holy spirit just you know
[1:31:13] uh not always but sometimes you go into
[1:31:15] prayer and the holy spirit just comes on
[1:31:17] the scene
[1:31:18] and and you know i remember i remember
[1:31:20] after that experience happened
[1:31:22] i sat there and after it left it's as
[1:31:25] fast as it came and it felt like
[1:31:26] it wouldn't stop it just was gone just
[1:31:28] like that just immediately
[1:31:30] and i couldn't have i couldn't have you
[1:31:32] know uh uh
[1:31:33] imitated it at all you know there's a
[1:31:36] real tongue there's the bible says that
[1:31:38] though i speak
[1:31:38] paul said though i speak with the tongue
[1:31:40] of men and angels there's an angelic
[1:31:41] tongue you can speak
[1:31:44] you know then there's tongues and
[1:31:45] prophecy interpretation where god
[1:31:47] brother madam says god gives
[1:31:48] now now i remember i sat there in my
[1:31:50] chair and i'm just crying
[1:31:52] just crying but just shaking experience
[1:31:55] changed me for
[1:31:55] days i remember for for two or three
[1:31:58] weeks i was so affected by that
[1:32:00] experience
[1:32:01] and i i remember i stopped and thought
[1:32:03] of myself i thought why
[1:32:05] would anyone ever
[1:32:08] not want that to happen
[1:32:13] that's what i couldn't figure out i
[1:32:15] thought i heard these people preaching
[1:32:16] against and i'm thinking
[1:32:17] why wouldn't why would someone not want
[1:32:19] that to happen
[1:32:22] i live in this natural carnal flesh
[1:32:24] enough man a little
[1:32:25] minute of breaking out of this cardinal
[1:32:27] getting into the supernatural dimension
[1:32:28] why wouldn't anybody want that
[1:32:35] well anyway we could say a lot more on
[1:32:36] that we won't
[1:32:38] brother and says what was it it was it
[1:32:40] was this time he's to take the same
[1:32:42] faith
[1:32:43] another acts 2. that's right another one
[1:32:46] he said brother matt does that mean we
[1:32:47] all speak in tongues paul said no not
[1:32:49] all speak with tongues
[1:32:51] or we're not preaching that to you at
[1:32:52] all but the prophet another place says
[1:32:54] away with experiences for a measuring
[1:32:56] line
[1:32:58] people always look to some kind of
[1:32:59] experience but the devil can always
[1:33:01] impersonate that experience but does
[1:33:03] that mean god can't give you an
[1:33:04] experience
[1:33:05] absolutely god can give you a very
[1:33:07] physical experience
[1:33:12] he promised malachi 4 that he would do
[1:33:14] this manifest his word to turn the
[1:33:15] hearts of the children back to the
[1:33:16] fathers again back to the original
[1:33:18] pentecostal word the real bible word
[1:33:21] the pentecostal they claimed pentecostal
[1:33:23] organization
[1:33:24] there's no such a thing
[1:33:28] pentecost is an experience
[1:33:33] can you say amen can we get a whole
[1:33:35] hearty whole wide church-wide amen
[1:33:38] pentecost is an experience not an
[1:33:42] organization
[1:33:43] they tried to organize it but you can't
[1:33:45] see it doesn't organize
[1:33:47] pentecost is an experience it's the seal
[1:33:50] of
[1:33:51] god the holy spirit that can't come on
[1:33:54] the day of pinnacle
[1:33:57] and how was the book of acts wrote start
[1:33:59] reading it look how
[1:34:00] we've contaminated it with all kinds of
[1:34:02] foolish things of our own
[1:34:03] but there'll be someone come someday a
[1:34:05] light before the going out this open
[1:34:07] door that's set before the church
[1:34:09] watch and see it if it doesn't come some
[1:34:11] of these days god will send the elijah
[1:34:13] just as certain as i'm standing in this
[1:34:14] pulpit he will sin and that elijah will
[1:34:16] shake the people right straight back
[1:34:18] to the original pentecostal doctrine now
[1:34:21] start out at pentecost see how it was
[1:34:23] see what they did see if it'll be
[1:34:24] shaking hands
[1:34:25] it'll be right straight back and when
[1:34:27] peter preached on the day of pentecost
[1:34:29] up there when they was
[1:34:30] all fit of the holy ghost and speaking
[1:34:32] in other tongues these men said now
[1:34:34] what can we do to get it peter said
[1:34:36] repent
[1:34:38] have you have a church that's marching
[1:34:40] to rock and roll music they're not
[1:34:41] marching to led zeppelin they're not
[1:34:43] marching to ac dc to some heavy metal
[1:34:46] band
[1:34:46] they're marching to christian music to
[1:34:49] the time of rock and roll
[1:34:51] it's prophesied literally you're seeing
[1:34:53] it fulfilled brother branham says you
[1:34:55] billy called me the room says daddy look
[1:34:57] he said if i ever seen a bunch of
[1:34:58] rickets he said
[1:34:59] singing gospel hymns through the time of
[1:35:00] rock and roll snapping tapping their
[1:35:03] what was it it was rock and roll music
[1:35:05] christian so what do they do they become
[1:35:07] more relevant
[1:35:09] well the bible has jesus said something
[1:35:10] very clear he who is a friend of the
[1:35:12] world
[1:35:14] is the enemy to god
[1:35:18] nadab and abbahu aaron's sons the bible
[1:35:20] says they mixed
[1:35:21] strange fire and if you look at your
[1:35:24] your your bible there if you have a
[1:35:26] scofield bible in the very bottom it
[1:35:27] says
[1:35:28] says strange fire was a mixing of holy
[1:35:30] fire and
[1:35:31] unholy fire so and what did what did god
[1:35:34] do god killed nadab and amahu because
[1:35:36] gee because if you go read the verse
[1:35:38] there the bible says god says
[1:35:40] because you'll have a separation he says
[1:35:43] this
[1:35:44] this won't be tolerated because there
[1:35:45] must be a difference
[1:35:49] between what's holy and what's unholy
[1:35:53] and they don't mix
[1:35:56] but today they they have nothing to
[1:35:58] offer so they
[1:36:00] have substitutes and young people
[1:36:03] mostly are disinterested in god they're
[1:36:06] disinterested in
[1:36:06] they're just interested in church you
[1:36:09] even have today church
[1:36:11] a young person who has you know trouble
[1:36:13] you know paying attention or
[1:36:15] or listening you know in church there's
[1:36:16] a disinterest there's if i could just be
[1:36:18] playing here there's a boredom we're
[1:36:20] bored
[1:36:21] there's there's a border to it let me
[1:36:23] just say this to you
[1:36:25] a young person is not bored with god
[1:36:27] they're bored with religion
[1:36:31] they're not bored the world is not bored
[1:36:34] with god
[1:36:35] they're bored with religion and what
[1:36:37] religion has
[1:36:39] produced all kinds of religions in the
[1:36:41] world today you have buddhism you have
[1:36:42] hinduism you have christianity
[1:36:44] you have catholicism islam you have
[1:36:47] judaism you have
[1:36:48] mormonism all of these different isms
[1:36:51] and
[1:36:51] religions today even in the christian
[1:36:55] religion
[1:36:55] today how many uh someone could tell me
[1:36:58] i think it was over two hundred thousand
[1:37:01] that could stand correction denominator
[1:37:03] religions in the world and how many
[1:37:04] how many denominations
[1:37:08] within the christian church alone
[1:37:10] hundreds
[1:37:12] baptist and pentecostal nominations
[1:37:15] methodist presbyterian church of christ
[1:37:17] lutherans episcopalians christian church
[1:37:19] united methodist free methodists
[1:37:21] a christian science seven days business
[1:37:23] jehovah's witness on and on and on and
[1:37:25] on and on and on and on and on
[1:37:27] he said brother matt what is that
[1:37:28] religion
[1:37:30] man's religion religions
[1:37:34] of the earth the bible says that
[1:37:37] oh you know you've said it said it well
[1:37:39] there there may be
[1:37:40] you know many religions you know there
[1:37:43] may be many religions but we all worship
[1:37:45] the same god well
[1:37:48] that's the same thing that islamic
[1:37:49] terrorists say we all we all believe in
[1:37:52] allah then they take planes and crash
[1:37:53] into a building
[1:37:56] so jesus said i am not a way i am
[1:38:01] the way i'm the only way and unless you
[1:38:04] believe in me you'll die in your sins
[1:38:08] but religion you know even even today
[1:38:12] you know and let me just say this who
[1:38:14] invented religion where it is where do
[1:38:16] you find religion starting
[1:38:18] in the book of genesis which is the seed
[1:38:21] chapter
[1:38:21] the beginnings and you find cain brother
[1:38:24] branham says cain was very religious he
[1:38:26] was more religious than abel was
[1:38:28] that's what brother madam says he's more
[1:38:29] religious than abel was religion is just
[1:38:32] a cloak it's a covering satan was at the
[1:38:34] very heart
[1:38:35] the very beginning of religion well you
[1:38:39] know i believe in god you know i'm a
[1:38:40] oh yeah you know i'm a christian i
[1:38:42] believe in i believe in god well james
[1:38:43] says you believe in god you do well
[1:38:45] so does the devil and his angels and
[1:38:47] they tremble
[1:38:50] you know the the the demons shudder at
[1:38:53] the at
[1:38:54] because of god they believe in god let
[1:38:57] me say this to you
[1:38:58] right uh here there's nothing that makes
[1:39:00] god
[1:39:01] more upset than empty religion
[1:39:05] i would that you were hot or cold but
[1:39:08] because you're lukewarm
[1:39:10] i'll spew you out of my mouth
[1:39:14] is that what he said hello there's
[1:39:17] nothing that
[1:39:17] turns god's stomach more and literally
[1:39:21] brother adam said it literally
[1:39:23] nauseates him than just
[1:39:27] empty religion
[1:39:30] religion without relationship
[1:39:34] the religion you notice it was the
[1:39:36] religion
[1:39:37] it was the religion of the jews that
[1:39:39] literally
[1:39:40] blinded them put them in complete
[1:39:42] spiritual
[1:39:43] blindness by binding them with rules and
[1:39:46] they had regulations and they had
[1:39:48] laws and it was all bondage and it was
[1:39:50] all fear
[1:39:52] and you know what jesus was to them
[1:39:53] jesus was a threat to their religion
[1:39:56] he was a threat to their boundaries he
[1:39:58] was a threat to all of their
[1:40:00] rules and and so the bible says that who
[1:40:03] were these scribes they were the
[1:40:04] experts they were the experts on the law
[1:40:08] of jewish religion it was it was in that
[1:40:10] those very
[1:40:11] experts it was in those very religious
[1:40:14] teachers
[1:40:15] in the tenor and the synagogues teaching
[1:40:17] the priest
[1:40:18] keeping the people under bondage
[1:40:22] in so much that they were blinded from
[1:40:24] the messiah
[1:40:25] what blinded them sin no religion
[1:40:30] can i get an amen is everybody still
[1:40:31] awake do we need to stand and then have
[1:40:33] you be seated
[1:40:34] y'all still here it was the religion
[1:40:38] that was blinding to them
[1:40:42] it was religious leaders who turned his
[1:40:44] house into what jesus calls a den of
[1:40:48] thieves
[1:40:51] supposed to be a house of prayer
[1:40:54] where people the hurt and the hungry
[1:40:57] could come to and get fed
[1:40:59] where the lost could come to and get
[1:41:01] saved
[1:41:03] jesus walks in one day and sees what
[1:41:05] they had turned into
[1:41:07] it was a complete chaos and the bible
[1:41:10] says jesus went in the temple and began
[1:41:12] to
[1:41:12] cast out those who sold and bought
[1:41:15] inside the temple
[1:41:16] and overturned the tables
[1:41:19] of the money changer changers whipped
[1:41:22] them
[1:41:23] you say what was that that was righteous
[1:41:24] indignation
[1:41:28] and what was it it was it was religion
[1:41:30] oh
[1:41:31] you religious cheaters oh you blind
[1:41:33] pharisees he calls them
[1:41:37] oh you blind pharisees with your
[1:41:39] traditions
[1:41:41] you've made the word of god of no effect
[1:41:45] oh i stop at that for a moment and say
[1:41:47] my brother my sister
[1:41:48] let's make sure we don't let the
[1:41:50] traditions make the word of no effect
[1:41:54] to where our church just becomes
[1:41:56] religious duty or a religious building
[1:41:58] a religious act that would take place
[1:42:00] and let it be
[1:42:01] the presence of the living god this is
[1:42:04] the heart of my message here
[1:42:06] tonight so just give me a minute just to
[1:42:07] finish it
[1:42:09] it was it was those same religious
[1:42:12] leaders
[1:42:13] who crucified the lord of glory
[1:42:17] it was those same religious leaders
[1:42:20] notice
[1:42:21] jesus wasn't killed by a you know a
[1:42:23] bunch of uh
[1:42:24] you know signed protesting atheists
[1:42:29] wasn't murdered by them he was murdered
[1:42:31] by religious leaders
[1:42:34] in the name of religion
[1:42:39] it was it was it was priests
[1:42:42] who claimed to know the law who claimed
[1:42:44] to know the word of god it was the
[1:42:46] sanhedrin council
[1:42:48] the the the it was the pious those who
[1:42:50] were devoted
[1:42:51] to the law yet yet blinded by their own
[1:42:54] religion blinded by their own
[1:42:57] tradition matthew chapter 7 says not all
[1:43:00] who are religious are godly
[1:43:04] many of them many will say in that day
[1:43:06] lord lord
[1:43:07] didn't we do many wonderful works in
[1:43:09] your name and we and we cast out and we
[1:43:12] we healed the sick and we opened blind
[1:43:14] eyes and jesus says and
[1:43:15] i'll say to them depart for me you that
[1:43:17] work iniquity i never
[1:43:19] even knew you what does that knowing
[1:43:22] speak of a relationship
[1:43:24] there's such a difference between
[1:43:26] religion laws
[1:43:28] codes traditions and relationships
[1:43:32] and you can believe the message and have
[1:43:34] laws and traditions and rules and
[1:43:35] regulations and
[1:43:36] miss the relationship with the person
[1:43:42] and none of those laws or regulations or
[1:43:44] traditions will save you
[1:43:46] they won't separate you and declassify
[1:43:49] you in a different group
[1:43:52] are you here
[1:43:57] you say what does it mean brother man it
[1:43:59] means that it's going to take more than
[1:44:00] just religion
[1:44:02] it's going to take revelation it's going
[1:44:05] to take a
[1:44:05] revelation that produces a relationship
[1:44:08] inside of your heart
[1:44:09] god jesus isn't coming back for
[1:44:12] books he's not coming back for tapes
[1:44:14] he's coming back for people
[1:44:16] who those books and tapes live inside
[1:44:19] who that word lives in he's not coming
[1:44:21] for church buildings church buildings
[1:44:23] are
[1:44:23] beautiful you some of the beautiful some
[1:44:26] of the most beautiful buildings
[1:44:27] that you could ever go and look at go to
[1:44:29] germany and go look at some of the
[1:44:30] prettiest structures you could go into
[1:44:32] as churches
[1:44:34] man just stand there and look at the
[1:44:36] beauty
[1:44:37] uh and on this it's all been dedicated
[1:44:40] unto god dedicated to the glory of god
[1:44:42] but the glory of god isn't in cathedrals
[1:44:44] it's not in steeples it's not in
[1:44:46] buildings
[1:44:49] not in beautiful temples mark
[1:44:52] 13's all these great buildings and
[1:44:54] structures
[1:44:56] all of it all the brick and mortar all
[1:44:58] of the greatest
[1:44:59] structures doesn't doesn't that's not
[1:45:01] not where the glory or the power of god
[1:45:04] dwells the the most high dwelleth not in
[1:45:06] temples made with hands
[1:45:08] the bible says but in hearts of human
[1:45:11] vessels
[1:45:13] earthen vessels marred clay god deposits
[1:45:16] the very
[1:45:17] life zoe life and the seed gene of god
[1:45:21] you know you not you are the temple of
[1:45:22] the holy ghost
[1:45:25] and the spirit of god dwelleth in you
[1:45:27] what he said paul said in first
[1:45:28] corinthians 6
[1:45:29] the spirit of god dwells inside of you
[1:45:33] not in temples made with hands
[1:45:36] there's nothing sacred about a building
[1:45:39] nothing
[1:45:40] nothing it's absolutely nothing brother
[1:45:43] branham would would
[1:45:44] tell about teleteller and the branham
[1:45:46] tabernacle not to run through the church
[1:45:48] it wasn't because the carpet was sacred
[1:45:51] prophet of god said don't run in here
[1:45:52] don't chew chewing gum why was it
[1:45:54] because of the beautiful pews no he said
[1:45:56] because the holy spirit
[1:45:58] stays here so if you take the holy
[1:46:01] spirit out like this building might as
[1:46:03] well it could be a bar
[1:46:05] could be a club it doesn't matter the
[1:46:07] building there's nothing
[1:46:08] sacred about any of it what makes it
[1:46:11] sacred is the presence of who's here
[1:46:16] that's why brother adam said the ever
[1:46:17] presence of the living god
[1:46:19] is the lifeline of the church
[1:46:25] not a building you know god won't send
[1:46:28] one person to hell for not coming to
[1:46:30] church
[1:46:34] church doesn't make you a christian no
[1:46:36] more than a you know sitting in church
[1:46:37] doesn't make you a christian either more
[1:46:39] than
[1:46:39] you stand in a garage does that make you
[1:46:41] a car
[1:46:44] no doesn't and sitting in a church your
[1:46:48] whole life doesn't make you a christian
[1:46:52] saying i believe the message doesn't
[1:46:53] make you a believer
[1:46:57] i belong to this group i belong to that
[1:47:00] group
[1:47:01] i belong to this it's what paul said i
[1:47:03] was the strictest of the strict i was a
[1:47:05] pharisee of pharisees
[1:47:07] but after paul's castle's conversion he
[1:47:09] said i counted all is dung it means
[1:47:12] nothing to know christ
[1:47:15] means nothing oh the only thing that
[1:47:17] means anything is to know him
[1:47:20] to know hillman's life i say today what
[1:47:23] we
[1:47:23] we don't need we don't need i'm going to
[1:47:27] close this we'll finish it next
[1:47:28] wednesday
[1:47:29] we don't need religion
[1:47:32] god's not looking for religion or duties
[1:47:35] or people who keep religious holidays or
[1:47:38] or or or or ordinances god's looking
[1:47:42] for a living tabernacle that he could
[1:47:45] dwell in
[1:47:48] that he could fill with the baptism of
[1:47:50] the holy ghost
[1:47:52] and they could live just as you say what
[1:47:54] kind of life can they live
[1:47:55] the brother adam says that the word
[1:47:57] meets the
[1:47:58] challenge of the hour you can't meet the
[1:48:01] challenge of the hour but the word of
[1:48:03] this
[1:48:03] hour meets it and that word can live in
[1:48:06] you
[1:48:07] i could say lord let it live in me oh
[1:48:10] musicians could you return
[1:48:12] as hands maybe you could raise a hand
[1:48:13] and say lord let it live in me
