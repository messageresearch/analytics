[44:56] I know that that ye all among whom I
[45:00] have gone preaching the kingdom of God
[45:01] shall see my face no more
[45:04] wherefore I take you to record this day
[45:06] that I am pure from the blood of all men
[45:08] for I have not shunned to declare unto
[45:11] you the whole all the counsel of God
[45:14] take heed therefore unto yourselves
[45:17] and to all the flock

[45:21] you overseers
[45:22] to feed the Church of God which he hath
[45:25] purchased with his own blood

[45:30] shall Grievous wolves enter in among you
[45:33] not sparing the flock
[45:35] also
[45:36] of your own selves shall men arise
[45:39] speaking perverse things to draw away
[45:41] disciples after them

[48:22] Camp I'm like you know what Lord I
[48:24] really want to get something from this
[48:25] camp
[48:26] and so I go to service and I just had
[48:29] the hardest time getting in the spirit
[48:31] like I I couldn't like I wasn't feeling
[48:33] the Lord and I was like Lord I was like
[48:35] what's wrong with me I was like maybe
[48:36] I'm nervous but then the Lord on
[48:38] Thursday night he um there's this young
[48:40] brother there who was a new Christian
[48:43] and uh he just got baptized like a week
[48:45] before the camp and the Lord put it on
[48:48] my heart and he said he said you need
[48:49] you need to be Prayed by that brother
[48:50] his name was leilar and I was like no I
[48:54] was like not not a new Christian I was
[48:56] like I was like I was like what can a
[48:57] new Christian do for me
[48:59] and you know and that of course is the
[49:01] wrong Spirit to have
[49:03] amen and so I was like I was like I was
[49:07] like maybe not Lord that's that's a
[49:09] little embarrassing I was like he's a
[49:10] really cool guy I was like you know
[49:12] you're becoming friends I was like maybe
[49:13] not and so uh Friday rolls around and we
[49:17] had two services in the morning and the
[49:19] evening and let me tell you I was just
[49:21] struggling with both of them I was like
[49:23] Lord I was like I was like what's wrong
[49:25] with me and I you know I started didn't
[49:27] get a little scared I was like you know
[49:28] I was like you know brother bear talks
[49:29] about whenever you you know lose that
[49:31] feeling of the Holy Spirit and I was
[49:33] like Lord I was like what's wrong
[49:35] and so you know Friday both of those
[49:37] Services I just couldn't get in the
[49:38] spirit and then Saturday Night comes
[49:40] around and you know it was a great great
[49:43] speaker great Minister and had a prayer
[49:45] line and I was like okay Lord I was like
[49:46] this this is where I'm getting it and so
[49:48] I go through the prayer line and they're
[49:50] just Godly brothers that prayed for me
[49:53] but I I go through and I I still didn't
[49:56] feel anything I was like Lord I was like
[49:58] I don't know I go down to my seat and
[50:00] I'm just defeated I'm like Lord I was
[50:02] like it must be me it must be I'm
[50:04] nervous I'm not right I was like I was
[50:06] like Lord I'm sorry and then I look up
[50:08] and it's laylar and a couple Brothers
[50:11] standing by the altar just praying in
[50:13] the circle with their arms around them
[50:15] and I was like I was like you know what
[50:16] Lord I was like I'm gonna go up there I
[50:18] was like I'm Gonna Stand by these
[50:20] brothers so I'd go up there I get my
[50:21] arms around these brothers and I look at
[50:23] lailar and laylar looks at me and he
[50:25] just makes a b line for me and I was
[50:28] like I was like oh I was like Lord this
[50:29] is you and so he came over and prayed
[50:31] for me and let me tell you guys I've
[50:34] never worshiped like I've worshiped like
[50:36] that in my life it was just such a
[50:39] blessing
[50:41] and so it ended up to where we prayed
[50:43] about two two and a half hours after
[50:45] service and we were all just calling on
[50:47] the name of Jesus praying for each other
[50:49] and it was just such a just a
[50:51] rejuvenation for me I feel like I got so
[50:53] much strength from it absolutely thank
[50:56] you
[50:58] [Applause]
[51:06] he was hoarse
[51:09] from praying
[51:11] that's that's how I want to be hoarse
[51:14] amen
[51:15] you know
[51:17] that's why it's so important as Daniel
[51:20] was talking I was I was thinking about
[51:21] this new believer and and how it was the
[51:25] Lord wanted him to pray for Daniel
[51:28] and he the Lord has his way of doing
[51:32] everything we have our way of doing
[51:35] doing what we want to do but he has his
[51:38] way and we need to get in line with what
[51:41] he wants us to do even though it might
[51:44] not make sense and seeing this
[51:47] seeing these these new people come in
[51:50] they bring an energy they bring life
[51:54] so when they're coming in welcome them
[51:57] and just like this young man the kids
[52:00] like um he's a world-class athlete that
[52:04] Daniel was talking to and and he just
[52:07] had a Zeal he had an excitement and and
[52:09] Daniel when he came in when he was just
[52:11] so excited he's like Dad this guy he
[52:14] just he loves the Lord and and he gave a
[52:17] testimony about this young man how I
[52:20] believe he's from Thailand I believe
[52:24] he came to the um to Canada
[52:27] and and he was in athletics or I don't
[52:31] know exactly what it was but he he
[52:33] finally found the Lord Jesus in Canada
[52:37] and and he's all excited and he's just
[52:40] he's just so happy that he finds the
[52:42] Lord Jesus
[52:44] and he's and what happens friends what
[52:46] happens when we receive the spirit of
[52:50] God into us immediately we have a burden
[52:54] for others
[52:55] that's that is what it does every single
[52:58] time we've been going through the book
[53:00] of Acts it's in the book of Acts every
[53:02] time they receive the spirit and then
[53:04] they have a burden to reach out so this
[53:07] young man he receives the Holy Spirit he
[53:10] gives his heart to the Lord and what's
[53:12] the first thing that he wants to do
[53:15] he wants his family
[53:18] back is it Thailand back in Thailand he
[53:21] wants his family to come to the Lord So
[53:24] Daniel did he go back there did he call
[53:26] him
[53:29] okay so so he gets excited
[53:32] and he wants to lead them to the Lord
[53:34] and have them find this same joy that he
[53:38] has in the Lord Jesus Christ he goes and
[53:41] he starts talking to him witnessing him
[53:43] and they're like son
[53:45] we gave our hearts to the Lord Jesus
[53:47] also
[53:49] his family at the same time his family
[53:53] had given their hearts to the Lord they
[53:55] knew nothing about Christ before so
[53:57] everybody the whole family
[54:00] yes
[54:02] God working on both ends with this it's
[54:05] a miracle brother John just like you
[54:07] just did it's a miracle God working on
[54:09] both sides and seeing Daniel come home
[54:12] and I just feeling that energy
[54:15] how he's so excited Lord let that not
[54:20] let it not become stale that's why we
[54:23] need more coming and then they can bring
[54:25] their lick of fire and this fire starts
[54:28] to brother Tony is fire starts to build
[54:31] starts to get hotter and hotter and
[54:33] hotter and then it affects more and more
[54:36] people
[54:37] I just I was just so bless sister Irma
[54:41] where's sister Irma you sang that song
[54:43] sister Cheryl beautiful song too oh the
[54:47] words of that song are are just
[54:49] incredible and then sister Irma where'd
[54:52] you there you are sister Irma sister
[54:54] Irma singing that song I was thinking
[54:57] that he hung
[54:59] these planets in the Solar System
[55:03] the miracle that happened that God
[55:07] whether it was a big bang or it was a
[55:10] big bang no matter what God Said let
[55:13] there be light and I guarantee you there
[55:15] was a bang something happened but he set
[55:19] all of these planets in the Solar System
[55:23] as their song was going and he he hung
[55:26] he hung the moon and the stars and and
[55:28] it goes on for so long I remember
[55:30] looking at these Stars one time and the
[55:32] Lord was dealing with me and I said Lord
[55:34] every one of these stars that I'm
[55:36] looking at is bigger than the rock that
[55:38] I'm standing on right now and you
[55:40] created it all
[55:41] and I have a problem
[55:43] I have problems
[55:46] you can handle everything Lord you are
[55:49] so great and I was worshiping there now
[55:52] and and just thanking the Lord for all
[55:55] of that he's done in hearing sister
[55:57] Irma's song but yet the greater miracle
[56:01] was not that he hung these stars in the
[56:04] sky
[56:04] the greater miracle was that he saved a
[56:09] Wretch like Me
[56:11] that's the greatest friends
[56:13] because let me tell you something those
[56:16] stars are not eternal
[56:19] they will pass away it may be billions
[56:21] of years but they will pass away but
[56:25] this right here will never pass away
[56:27] because I am in Jesus Christ
[56:31] and he is eternal and if he's Eternal
[56:34] I'm Eternal with him I want to be
[56:37] associated with this man Jesus Christ
[56:41] that died for my sins it gave me eternal
[56:44] life Mr Shirley I love him so much for
[56:46] it I look at my son and my daughter and
[56:49] serving the lord and I'm I'm just
[56:52] I'm so grateful I'm so thankful that
[56:55] that he's done so he's just he's given
[56:59] us so much
[57:01] and I was as I was thinking on
[57:05] I I ministered on Wednesday night on
[57:08] this Acts chapter 20.
[57:11] and what was I read the scripture at the
[57:13] beginning and what had happened
[57:15] is this man Paul
[57:18] he came to this place and he wanted the
[57:21] elders from the church at Ephesus to
[57:24] meet him over in this place
[57:26] so he gets everyone together and they
[57:29] they come and they have like an elders
[57:31] meeting or a Minister's meeting and this
[57:33] is Paul says this is the last time I'm
[57:36] going to see you
[57:38] and they wept because there was
[57:40] prophecies knowing that that when Paul
[57:42] left this place he was going to go to
[57:44] Jerusalem and there were bonds waiting
[57:47] for him in Jerusalem
[57:49] and it was going to be and everyone knew
[57:52] it was going to be hard but but Paul
[57:54] stayed with it and he said no the Lord
[57:55] is leading me there I know I'm going to
[57:57] suffer I know it's going to be hard but
[58:00] I'm gonna go anyways
[58:03] and he said but when I leave
[58:06] he said wolves are going to come among
[58:09] you
[58:11] and I thought about
[58:13] as I read that scripture over and over
[58:15] and over
[58:17] I thought about who are these wolves
[58:20] that are going to come in and Scatter
[58:22] these sheep as Paul prophesied
[58:25] he said that they're going to come from
[58:27] the outside
[58:29] and he said they're going to come from
[58:31] right in among you
[58:33] and I thought who are these Grievous
[58:38] wolves that this apostle was talking
[58:41] about and why was it so important for
[58:44] him to warn us
[58:47] of these wolves our lord Jesus warned us
[58:50] also
[58:51] more than once
[58:53] about wolves that would enter in among
[58:55] you
[58:57] it was
[59:00] I was thinking on this and I was
[59:02] thinking about Lord what do wolves do
[59:04] when the Bible talks about wolves it's
[59:06] always talking about sheep too
[59:09] that there's sheep out here and these
[59:11] sheep are defenseless and these wolves
[59:12] come in and they kill the Sheep
[59:15] and and I've had this
[59:19] continuing anxiety attacks since January
[59:23] and it's almost daily
[59:26] worrying
[59:28] about the church
[59:30] and just and and worrying about these
[59:34] precious people that are in this
[59:36] building now
[59:37] and thinking about every one of them
[59:40] and and thinking about Lord this is the
[59:43] Lord's flock of sheep
[59:47] as as he says many times in these Jesus
[59:50] constantly makes the um the comparison
[59:53] of us and sheep and and thinking about
[59:57] Lord if I was the owner of these sheep
[1:00:00] if I had a hundred sheep
[1:00:03] and I lost a couple of them
[1:00:07] it wouldn't be that big of a deal
[1:00:09] it's like well they're my sheep I'll
[1:00:11] I'll make the money on these other ones
[1:00:14] and and you know you lose one or two
[1:00:18] but these aren't
[1:00:21] my sheep
[1:00:23] these are God's sheep and God places
[1:00:28] pastors over the flock and he says you
[1:00:32] watch out for these sheep they're mine
[1:00:35] you don't lose one of them
[1:00:38] wow and you know I just think about Lord
[1:00:42] this is scary if they were mine it would
[1:00:46] be different but they're yours when you
[1:00:48] come back and say where are my sheep I
[1:00:51] had a hundred of them
[1:00:54] um they'd better everyone be there
[1:00:57] because that is what he has tasked a
[1:01:00] pastor with
[1:01:01] scares me to death I'm thinking about
[1:01:04] about these sheep and it's like Lord and
[1:01:06] there's each one of them it's different
[1:01:07] even each one of us has a personality
[1:01:09] and Lord I I pray for them and and they
[1:01:12] need help and this one goes this way and
[1:01:14] some of them I don't even like
[1:01:18] every time I walk by them they try to
[1:01:20] bite me or kick me or step on my foot or
[1:01:24] do something but they're not mine
[1:01:27] it doesn't matter I was just kidding
[1:01:30] about not they're not liking it
[1:01:32] [Laughter]
[1:01:34] I really was kidding brother Joe
[1:01:40] all of them they'll they lash out and
[1:01:43] they bite and they kick but it doesn't
[1:01:44] matter
[1:01:46] and we see sometimes that that these
[1:01:49] Shepherds that they will look at these
[1:01:52] sheep and they will try to control these
[1:01:55] sheep try to dominate these sheep for
[1:01:57] what for their own benefit
[1:02:00] and it's the way that they control them
[1:02:04] is almost always by fear
[1:02:09] I was
[1:02:10] I was thinking of
[1:02:12] as I was thinking about the sheep and I
[1:02:14] was I was thinking about Lord You're so
[1:02:16] so good you are the great Shepherd and
[1:02:19] and we we want to follow you and I was
[1:02:23] um
[1:02:24] I was thinking about that song
[1:02:28] psalm 23.
[1:02:31] and I I was thinking about it's
[1:02:33] obviously about a shepherd and and sheep
[1:02:36] and it says this it says the Lord is my
[1:02:39] shepherd
[1:02:40] I shall not want you you can probably
[1:02:43] say it by by memory he maketh me to lie
[1:02:46] down in Green Pastures
[1:02:48] he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he
[1:02:51] restoreth my soul he leadeth me in Paths
[1:02:55] of righteousness for his namesake
[1:02:58] yea though I walk through the valley of
[1:03:01] the shadow of death I will fear no evil
[1:03:05] for thou art with me think about that
[1:03:07] Shepherd for thou art with me thy rod
[1:03:11] and thy staff they comfort me
[1:03:15] as I was thinking on that
[1:03:18] I thought thy rod and thy staff
[1:03:22] they're different
[1:03:24] they're two different they're two
[1:03:26] different things
[1:03:27] that this Shepherd uses
[1:03:30] so I started thinking about a staff I
[1:03:34] know that Jacob leaned on it on his
[1:03:36] staff
[1:03:38] when he was when he was out and and
[1:03:39] Moses had this step but Moses also had a
[1:03:43] rod and Aaron had a rod
[1:03:47] different than a staff
[1:03:50] Aaron's rod
[1:03:52] was made out of
[1:03:55] um almond wood it's a very hard wood
[1:03:59] and inside the Ark of the Covenant the
[1:04:01] Ark of the Covenant is less than four
[1:04:03] feet long
[1:04:06] and less than two feet wide
[1:04:10] so Aaron inside that Arc were two tables
[1:04:14] of stones
[1:04:15] the Ten Commandments
[1:04:17] a bowl of manna
[1:04:20] and Aaron put his Rod inside that Ark
[1:04:28] so it was small
[1:04:30] and when it was inside inside that box
[1:04:33] it butted and bore almonds
[1:04:37] so I got thinking what is this
[1:04:41] Shepherd's law thy rod and thy staff
[1:04:44] they comfort me
[1:04:46] and I thought Lord I really don't
[1:04:48] understand that so I was I was looking a
[1:04:51] little bit further and I could see that
[1:04:53] this staff this Shepherd staff he uses a
[1:04:56] tool that that when the Sheep were going
[1:04:58] he would he would take him and he would
[1:05:00] nudge them when they would get stuck
[1:05:01] maybe in a thorn bush or something some
[1:05:04] of these staffs had a hook on the end he
[1:05:06] could go and you've seen the pictures of
[1:05:07] the ones that go up and they have the
[1:05:09] hook he could go and he could grab the
[1:05:10] Sheep maybe if the Sheep was on a cliff
[1:05:13] or in a thorn bush he could go and he
[1:05:14] could pull it out to safety
[1:05:17] very kind
[1:05:19] thing with this this
[1:05:21] the staff but a rod was different
[1:05:26] this Rod was a club
[1:05:31] and so we see that dive rod
[1:05:35] comforts me Lord because I know that you
[1:05:37] have power in this rod and your staff
[1:05:39] that kindness so so this Shepherd he's
[1:05:42] got the staff and he's got this rod and
[1:05:45] this Rod sometimes had Nails sticking
[1:05:47] out of it
[1:05:49] and let me tell you the rod was not for
[1:05:52] the Sheep
[1:05:55] sometimes they use the rod on the sheep
[1:05:57] but it was not for those sheep that Rod
[1:06:01] was made to fight off the Wolves it was
[1:06:05] a club so we see that that there are two
[1:06:09] things at work this this rod and this
[1:06:12] staff and as as we go through this
[1:06:15] Valley
[1:06:17] it's shadowed by death we see sin all
[1:06:20] around us and we're here in the shadow
[1:06:23] of this and we're looking around and we
[1:06:25] see all death and destruction and
[1:06:27] horrible things around us and we're
[1:06:29] going through and we see that this great
[1:06:31] Shepherd his rod and his staff is his
[1:06:35] staff points us and his Rod fights off
[1:06:37] our enemies for us every time
[1:06:40] and this evil world that we live in
[1:06:42] fearful thing
[1:06:44] very very fearful as we go through this
[1:06:48] Valley but he says he is with us and his
[1:06:51] Rod fights off those wolves
[1:06:57] but who are these wolves
[1:06:59] that Paul was talking about to the
[1:07:02] elders at Ephesus Matthew chapter 7
[1:07:05] listen to this
[1:07:06] verse 14.
[1:07:12] he says this
[1:07:13] the Lord Jesus speaking he says because
[1:07:15] straight is the gate
[1:07:17] and narrow is the way which leadeth unto
[1:07:20] life and few there be that find it
[1:07:24] wow he just narrowed it down this is a
[1:07:27] perilous time that we're in
[1:07:29] beware of false prophets
[1:07:32] which come to you in sheep's clothing
[1:07:34] but inwardly they are ravening wolves
[1:07:37] ye shall know them by their fruits
[1:07:40] do men gather Grapes of thorns or figs
[1:07:43] of thistle meaning grapes don't grow in
[1:07:45] Thorn bushes and neither do figs growing
[1:07:47] thistles they grow on trees the
[1:07:50] Amplified version of this the Amplified
[1:07:51] I sometimes I use the Amplified version
[1:07:53] the Amplified means just expounded on
[1:07:56] there's some there are some extra words
[1:07:59] in there that the author took from the
[1:08:01] original translation and he put it in
[1:08:04] context for us and it says this
[1:08:06] it says by their fruits you will
[1:08:09] recognize them that is by their
[1:08:11] contrived Doctrine and self-focus
[1:08:15] do people pick grapes from grapes from
[1:08:17] Thorn bushes or figs from thistles
[1:08:22] I think
[1:08:25] about
[1:08:27] what has happened
[1:08:29] over
[1:08:30] the years and over the past
[1:08:34] 60s 70.
[1:08:36] years
[1:08:38] and I think about
[1:08:40] Lord
[1:08:42] we
[1:08:44] you sent a messenger you sent a shepherd
[1:08:49] to help us
[1:08:51] and then we see
[1:08:53] that things have changed
[1:08:56] and many times that that
[1:09:00] wolves
[1:09:01] have come in
[1:09:04] and changed the original meaning of what
[1:09:08] this man taught
[1:09:11] and it's very it's a perilous time and
[1:09:14] it's happened it's happened over time I
[1:09:16] read this quote last Sunday night but I
[1:09:20] want to read it again
[1:09:22] brother Brown said this in 1958 sign of
[1:09:26] the Messiah he says now
[1:09:28] he was speaking of Jesus he said I am
[1:09:30] the van the vine and you are the
[1:09:32] branches
[1:09:33] now the vine doesn't bear fruit of
[1:09:35] itself
[1:09:36] it only purges the branches and the
[1:09:39] branches bears fruit do you know that
[1:09:43] well then if you went to a grapevine
[1:09:46] thank you if you went to a grapevine
[1:09:48] what would you expect to find grapes if
[1:09:51] you went to watermelon vine you find
[1:09:54] watermelon if it's a fertile Vine if you
[1:09:56] went to a peach tree you'd find peaches
[1:09:59] but then if you if Christ is the vine
[1:10:02] and his members of the churches the
[1:10:05] branches what ought you to find in the
[1:10:08] church think about that
[1:10:11] The Works that I do shall you do also
[1:10:13] More Than This shall you do for I go to
[1:10:15] my father that's what we should see in
[1:10:18] the church
[1:10:19] but what do you find when you go to the
[1:10:23] church
[1:10:24] we are the Presbyterian
[1:10:27] we are the Baptist
[1:10:30] we are the Pentecostals
[1:10:33] we got the message
[1:10:36] we got this that's not Christ Christ is
[1:10:40] love because he was God
[1:10:45] how much have things changed to where
[1:10:49] even we ourselves and I know this
[1:10:52] offends people
[1:10:54] I know it doesn't and I don't I don't
[1:10:56] mean it mean to say it but the Lord
[1:10:58] keeps I really believe it's him that
[1:11:00] lays it on my heart that what have we
[1:11:03] done we have a name
[1:11:06] just like the methodists and just like
[1:11:08] the Baptist
[1:11:09] and we say oh we're on the message and
[1:11:12] what does it do
[1:11:13] it does the same thing that it's always
[1:11:15] does it divides and it says we are an
[1:11:19] elite group and you're out
[1:11:23] the quote right there puts us right in
[1:11:27] with the others
[1:11:29] I was I have a friend
[1:11:31] I know brother
[1:11:34] that he and
[1:11:38] he went on a missionary trip with this
[1:11:40] with his other brother
[1:11:44] and before they left this is way back
[1:11:47] around 1980.
[1:11:50] before they left to go on this trip
[1:11:54] they the one brother minister
[1:11:58] went to visit sister Mita Branham
[1:12:01] brother Brown's wife
[1:12:03] I don't remember if it was here in
[1:12:05] Tucson or if it was in Jeffersonville
[1:12:06] but he goes and he spends some time with
[1:12:09] her he wanted to talk with her about the
[1:12:11] message and about brother Branham well
[1:12:13] they he spends time with her he meets
[1:12:15] this other brother they get on a plane
[1:12:17] and they fly to go overseas and they had
[1:12:20] this long time to talk
[1:12:24] and he says I was talking
[1:12:27] with brother branham's wife
[1:12:30] and he said these words he says you know
[1:12:32] he said it's amazing
[1:12:36] that his brother branham's own family
[1:12:39] didn't understand his message
[1:12:43] think about that
[1:12:45] it's amazing that brother branham's
[1:12:47] family didn't understand his own message
[1:12:51] and then after and after just 10 or 15
[1:12:54] years this brother goes and he visits
[1:12:57] with sister Branham and and brother
[1:13:00] branham's own wife
[1:13:03] let me tell you Stephanie
[1:13:05] knows my message better than anyone
[1:13:09] I talk with her about it every day
[1:13:12] and after just 15 years
[1:13:15] even his own wife didn't even recognize
[1:13:18] the message what it had become
[1:13:22] because it had changed so much
[1:13:25] and now after all of these years
[1:13:28] it has changed to the point where I
[1:13:31] don't even think brother Branham would
[1:13:33] recognize it
[1:13:35] and it's not what he preached
[1:13:37] don't lay a lot of this stuff on him
[1:13:40] that man was a great man and he preached
[1:13:43] the gospel
[1:13:45] and not only did he preach it he showed
[1:13:48] us
[1:13:49] what happens when the Holy Spirit is in
[1:13:53] a man
[1:13:55] could it be
[1:13:57] could it be that these wolves that were
[1:14:01] prophesied to come that they came in
[1:14:05] preaching their own message
[1:14:07] that would benefit them
[1:14:11] and ruined it
[1:14:14] thank God that we have the prophet on
[1:14:17] tape
[1:14:20] could it be
[1:14:22] Jesus warned us
[1:14:25] brother Branham said he says we are
[1:14:27] Presbyterian We Are Baptist we are
[1:14:29] Pentecostal we got the message we've got
[1:14:31] this he said that's not Christ
[1:14:35] when Jesus was
[1:14:36] was with his disciples
[1:14:39] it was the closing hours of his life on
[1:14:43] Earth
[1:14:45] and Jesus in Matthew chapter 23 and 24
[1:14:49] he goes to the he goes to the temple and
[1:14:53] he
[1:14:54] preaches to these Pharisees and
[1:14:56] Sadducees
[1:14:59] he says
[1:15:01] things like you try to honor the
[1:15:04] prophets of old and he says your fathers
[1:15:07] are the ones that put them in there in
[1:15:09] the grave
[1:15:11] he says you honor them he says you
[1:15:12] garnish their tombs and and and you you
[1:15:15] take you build these monuments to them
[1:15:17] and he said your fathers are the ones
[1:15:20] that put them in there
[1:15:26] one after the other
[1:15:30] he he he tells them he says he says this
[1:15:33] he says woe unto you scribes and
[1:15:35] Pharisees Hypocrites because you build
[1:15:36] the tombs of the prophets and garnish
[1:15:38] the sepulchers or sepulchers of the
[1:15:40] righteous and say if we had been in the
[1:15:42] days of our fathers we would not have
[1:15:44] been partakers with them of the blood of
[1:15:46] the prophets
[1:15:47] sounds familiar
[1:15:49] wherefore ye be witness unto yourselves
[1:15:52] that you are the children of them which
[1:15:54] killed the prophets this is Jesus
[1:15:55] talking this isn't me
[1:15:57] wherefore ye be Witnesses unto
[1:15:59] yourselves that you are the children of
[1:16:01] them that killed the prophets fill ye up
[1:16:03] then a measure of your fathers ye
[1:16:05] serpents you Generation of Vipers how
[1:16:07] can you escape the damnation
[1:16:10] of hell
[1:16:13] wow he's talking about these wolves that
[1:16:16] would come in
[1:16:17] and Destroy these prophets message
[1:16:20] and then you know the disciples were
[1:16:22] probably like whoa
[1:16:24] wow that was intense
[1:16:27] up there on that Temple mount
[1:16:30] so they get alone with Jesus a little
[1:16:33] while later
[1:16:35] they're up in the on the Mount of Olives
[1:16:37] which is just across the Valley from the
[1:16:39] temple
[1:16:41] Matthew 24 Jesus says this as he set up
[1:16:44] on the Mount of Olives the disciples
[1:16:46] came unto him privately saying tell us
[1:16:48] when shall these things be and what
[1:16:50] shall be the sign of thy coming and of
[1:16:53] the end of the world
[1:16:56] Matthew 24 verse 4. and Jesus answered
[1:17:00] and said unto them take heed that no man
[1:17:02] deceive you
[1:17:04] he's warning the same thing Paul warned
[1:17:07] in the scripture that I read earlier
[1:17:10] there's coming
[1:17:12] he's saying that there's coming a
[1:17:14] deceiving spirit in the church and that
[1:17:16] deceiving Spirit can take many different
[1:17:19] forms
[1:17:24] it says take take heed that no man
[1:17:26] deceive you for many shall come in my
[1:17:28] name
[1:17:29] saying I am the Christ and shall deceive
[1:17:31] many it says so many shall come in my
[1:17:34] name and say that I am the Christ unto
[1:17:37] Steve many whose name are they coming in
[1:17:39] Jesus
[1:17:41] they're preaching Jesus
[1:17:45] and they'll come in my name and he says
[1:17:47] it's many I've never met
[1:17:51] maybe I don't I don't ever remember me
[1:17:54] ever meeting anyone that said that he is
[1:17:56] Christ
[1:17:58] and deceived anybody
[1:18:00] but but Jesus is saying that many will
[1:18:03] come and do that so many will come in my
[1:18:07] name
[1:18:08] and maybe they're saying that Jesus is
[1:18:10] the Christ
[1:18:12] and shall deceive still deceive many and
[1:18:15] you shall hear of wars and rumors of
[1:18:17] wars see that you be not troubled
[1:18:19] for all these things must come to pass
[1:18:21] but the end is not yet for nation shall
[1:18:23] rise against nation and Kingdom against
[1:18:25] Kingdom and there shall be famine and
[1:18:27] pestilence and earthquakes in diverse
[1:18:28] places all these are the beginning of
[1:18:30] Sorrows
[1:18:32] then shall they deliver you up to be
[1:18:33] afflicted and shall kill you
[1:18:35] and ye shall be hated of all Nations for
[1:18:37] my name's sake
[1:18:42] and then
[1:18:44] many shall be offended and shall betray
[1:18:46] one another and shall hate one another
[1:18:50] so
[1:18:52] Jesus is saying that this spirit
[1:18:56] and it's a religious spirit this spirit
[1:18:59] is going to come into the church and
[1:19:02] it's going to cause hatred and Division
[1:19:04] and I'm not
[1:19:05] saying that this is message churches I'm
[1:19:09] saying that this is Christianity all
[1:19:11] over the place
[1:19:12] and saying that this is going to come in
[1:19:16] but we do see that spirit
[1:19:18] and deceive many
[1:19:22] and
[1:19:24] you look at what happens inside the
[1:19:27] churches
[1:19:28] and you see that
[1:19:31] they fight and they gossip it's not
[1:19:34] normal
[1:19:35] we shouldn't do that you see within the
[1:19:37] families you think you see the fighting
[1:19:40] and and all that that's not normal
[1:19:42] we shouldn't do that
[1:19:44] you say I don't hate anyone but then you
[1:19:47] get offended at any little thing
[1:19:50] it's not right
[1:19:53] Jesus here is saying that all these
[1:19:55] things are coming into the church
[1:19:58] and you are going to be out there as
[1:20:00] sheep among wolves and many Prof false
[1:20:02] prophets shall rise and deceive many
[1:20:05] and because iniquity shall abound the
[1:20:07] love of many shall wax cold
[1:20:11] so all of this we see this coming in and
[1:20:14] what it is we see that that this Spirit
[1:20:18] gets such control
[1:20:20] over the people and we see it Through
[1:20:22] the Ages you just read history
[1:20:25] we see that this Spirit gets such
[1:20:27] control over the people that it and and
[1:20:29] the people are so afraid of of the
[1:20:33] hierarchy they're so afraid of of the
[1:20:35] pastor or the church or whatever it is
[1:20:38] they're so afraid of getting kicked out
[1:20:39] or being or being ostracized that
[1:20:44] they'll sell their own family out
[1:20:47] that that what what the most important
[1:20:51] thing is that they're accepted
[1:20:54] and they'll look at their family
[1:20:57] and
[1:20:58] betray them
[1:21:00] the love of many
[1:21:02] shall wax cold
[1:21:04] and we see it we see it today and I
[1:21:08] think many of us it hits close to home
[1:21:12] that
[1:21:15] the fear
[1:21:17] that Satan puts over the people
[1:21:23] and and we're so afraid
[1:21:27] of the church or we're so afraid of the
[1:21:29] pastor
[1:21:31] where's the fear of God brother Leo
[1:21:34] that's who we should be afraid of
[1:21:37] and don't and and stand and and it's to
[1:21:41] stand up against against these things
[1:21:45] brother Branham said
[1:21:48] himself he was
[1:21:52] when he dedicated the the Branham
[1:21:54] Tabernacle
[1:21:56] he had this Vision beautiful vision
[1:21:59] and the Lord he said basically Lord
[1:22:02] where's my church and he showed them all
[1:22:04] the skies and and brother Branham
[1:22:09] wrote
[1:22:12] second Timothy chapter four
[1:22:15] on a piece of paper
[1:22:17] and put it just as Paul did saying
[1:22:20] wolves are going to come in put it
[1:22:22] in a piece of paper and put it on the on
[1:22:24] the in the Cornerstone of the brown
[1:22:26] Tabernacle I'm not talking about the
[1:22:27] Tabernacle Church I'm talking about the
[1:22:30] ministry that was to come I'm not saying
[1:22:32] anything about the Bram Tabernacle I'm
[1:22:34] saying that brother Branham put this in
[1:22:36] there and it says this for the time will
[1:22:38] come when they will not endure sound
[1:22:39] Doctrine
[1:22:41] but after their own lust shall they heat
[1:22:43] for themselves teachers having itching
[1:22:45] ears
[1:22:47] that scripture
[1:22:49] these teachers having itching ears they
[1:22:53] shall Heap for themselves the
[1:22:55] congregation
[1:22:57] shall put these teachers in place
[1:23:03] and they will dictate what is said
[1:23:06] from the pulpit you know why because the
[1:23:09] pastor is afraid that if he if he
[1:23:12] crosses the line that the people will
[1:23:14] leave
[1:23:15] he fears that
[1:23:17] I know I I have feelings that I've never
[1:23:21] felt before in being in this position so
[1:23:24] I know I can I can relate to that
[1:23:27] and brother Branham put that in there
[1:23:30] saying that this Spirit was going to
[1:23:32] come and it's the spirit of of division
[1:23:35] in this the spirit of not standing up
[1:23:37] for what is right with God
[1:23:39] we see that the way of the world today
[1:23:44] is never making a stand for anything
[1:23:48] I talked about on um
[1:23:51] Wednesday night I talked about Snow
[1:23:53] White and the Seven Dwarfs have you seen
[1:23:56] have you heard about this new this new
[1:23:58] uh I don't know if it's out yet or
[1:24:00] whatever new movie about Snow White
[1:24:02] you heard about it
[1:24:04] there's no doors
[1:24:07] there's there's no little people because
[1:24:09] they were afraid that if they have seven
[1:24:12] dwarfs that they're going to offend
[1:24:15] the little people
[1:24:16] so what did it do
[1:24:18] it upset them because these poor actors
[1:24:22] they don't get the job
[1:24:26] and it's all because everybody is afraid
[1:24:28] of offending anyone else and when you do
[1:24:30] that you offend everyone
[1:24:32] because there's no one that will make a
[1:24:34] stand there's no one that will really
[1:24:36] stand up for what's right and then it
[1:24:39] says that they shall turn their ears
[1:24:41] from the truth and shall be turned to
[1:24:43] Fables
[1:24:44] we worry more about
[1:24:47] what our friends are going to think
[1:24:51] rather than our decisions that we make
[1:24:53] rather than these things that please the
[1:24:55] Lord
[1:24:57] I was
[1:24:59] really friends it's really in my heart
[1:25:01] we have to have that relationship with
[1:25:05] Christ that is what a church is for this
[1:25:08] church comes together to support each
[1:25:11] other to have that relationship with the
[1:25:14] Lord Jesus and don't fear
[1:25:18] don't ever be afraid
[1:25:20] if you are afraid
[1:25:23] Satan is the author of fear we should
[1:25:26] fear God of course that we should please
[1:25:28] him but not man
[1:25:31] so if we really are fearing something
[1:25:35] who do we have faith in
[1:25:37] do we have faith in Satan or do we have
[1:25:39] faith in God
[1:25:40] never fear
[1:25:43] fear is is the opposite of love I
[1:25:46] remember I was
[1:25:48] years ago we were living in
[1:25:50] Jeffersonville
[1:25:52] I want to make sure you know I'm not
[1:25:55] saying anything about any church when I
[1:25:56] said that brother Ben placed that
[1:25:58] scripture in the Cornerstone
[1:26:00] I'm for everybody I I I I'm for the
[1:26:04] church is getting people together and
[1:26:06] loving the Lord but he placed that there
[1:26:08] saying that that the people
[1:26:13] we're going to turn from what's the
[1:26:15] truth to fables not so much not that
[1:26:18] church but I believe my interpretation
[1:26:22] of it
[1:26:23] that they would turn
[1:26:25] to something that was not true
[1:26:28] I was
[1:26:30] this is a sad story I
[1:26:32] I was um
[1:26:34] we lived in Jeffersonville and we came
[1:26:36] out to Tucson
[1:26:39] and uh some uh some people that I knew
[1:26:42] that
[1:26:43] that I used to go to church with they um
[1:26:48] uh one of the brothers died and the kids
[1:26:50] were all there and none of the kids were
[1:26:51] serving the lord anymore
[1:26:54] and I went there and I talked to them
[1:26:57] and and I said
[1:27:00] what what what's going on
[1:27:04] why why aren't you why aren't you
[1:27:06] serving the lord why don't you why don't
[1:27:07] you believe anymore and they said listen
[1:27:09] they said our dad the girl said that if
[1:27:13] we put makeup on our face that our faces
[1:27:15] would fall off
[1:27:18] they said how could we believe
[1:27:21] something like that threatening them
[1:27:25] all the time this Dad threatening these
[1:27:29] kids that if you do this
[1:27:33] then it's you're gonna that Satan's
[1:27:35] gonna attack you
[1:27:37] not not not presenting it in the right
[1:27:40] way not presenting it in love
[1:27:42] presented in in the way that it should
[1:27:46] be presented for First Timothy Chapter 2
[1:27:49] says this it says Paul says I exhort
[1:27:52] therefore I exhort therefore that first
[1:27:56] of all
[1:27:59] supplications prayers intercessions and
[1:28:01] giving thanks be made for all men
[1:28:04] Paul's going to give some correction
[1:28:05] here and it's correction that we in our
[1:28:07] message churches that we use
[1:28:10] for Kings
[1:28:12] and for all that are in Authority that
[1:28:14] we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in
[1:28:17] all goodness godliness and honesty

[1:28:28] sight of God our savior

[1:28:34] to be saved and come unto the knowledge
[1:28:37] of the truth for there is one God and
[1:28:39] one mediator between God and Men the man
[1:28:42] Christ Jesus who gave himself for a
[1:28:44] ransom for all to be testified in due
[1:28:47] time not anyone else

[1:29:00] place

[1:29:17] of faith in faith and Verity
[1:29:20] I therefore that all men pray everywhere
[1:29:23] lifting up holy hands without wrath and
[1:29:25] doubting
[1:29:26] how many of us are doing that
[1:29:30] other translations
[1:29:32] say that I desire that in every place
[1:29:34] men should pray lifting up holy hands
[1:29:36] without anger and without quarreling
[1:29:39] we leave this part
[1:29:41] of the message out
[1:29:44] there shouldn't be any fighting there
[1:29:45] should be any anger among us there
[1:29:47] shouldn't be any attacking each other
[1:29:49] Jesus told us that we're in the last
[1:29:52] days and the love of many would wax cold
[1:29:56] verse number nine
[1:29:59] in like manner also that women Adorn
[1:30:01] themselves in modest apparel with
[1:30:02] shame-facedness and sobriety
[1:30:04] not with broided hair or gold or Pearl
[1:30:06] or costly array but which becometh the
[1:30:09] women professing godliness with good
[1:30:12] works
[1:30:13] so in Even in our very lives even in the
[1:30:18] way that we dress we should represent
[1:30:21] our lord Jesus in every way
[1:30:27] that says let a woman learn in Silence
[1:30:29] with all subjection
[1:30:30] but I suffer suffer not a woman to teach
[1:30:32] nor a serp authority over the man but to
[1:30:34] be in silence for Adam was first formed
[1:30:36] and then Eve and Adam was not deceived
[1:30:38] but the woman being deceived was in the
[1:30:40] transgression notwithstanding
[1:30:43] she shall be saved in childbearing if
[1:30:45] they continue in faith and charity and
[1:30:48] holiness
[1:30:49] and sobriety so in this chapter that's
[1:30:53] used so much
[1:30:55] Paul is bringing out the reason why
[1:31:00] even in a very close that we wear
[1:31:04] should represent the Lord Jesus and a
[1:31:07] man should be praying all the time with
[1:31:09] with with
[1:31:11] sincerity of heart not quarreling not
[1:31:13] fighting but doing his best to serve God
[1:31:17] in every single way
[1:31:22] then
[1:31:23] that's when we see things happen
[1:31:27] but wolves friends have taken these
[1:31:29] scriptures out of context and taken what
[1:31:31] brother Branham said out of context and
[1:31:33] used it not as a staff
[1:31:36] but use it as a club
[1:31:39] to beat people and drive them away and
[1:31:41] put fear into them
[1:31:44] well excommunicates you if you don't
[1:31:46] line up
[1:31:47] we'll kick you out of church if you
[1:31:49] don't do it
[1:31:50] it's not right
[1:31:52] there are reasons to do that and Paul
[1:31:55] laid those out
[1:31:56] but it's not because of my Ministry
[1:31:59] brother Aaron it's not because of what I
[1:32:00] say
[1:32:01] remember
[1:32:03] with my kids growing up and Daniel and
[1:32:06] Madeline and
[1:32:09] saw that like all kids they stray and
[1:32:12] they do things wrong and I remember my
[1:32:15] daughter
[1:32:17] was
[1:32:19] talking to this young man that I knew
[1:32:22] this was not right
[1:32:24] and and I'll tell you in in parents
[1:32:27] growing up
[1:32:28] a lot of times when it's a boy or a girl
[1:32:31] that's when you see your children leave
[1:32:35] so with my daughter
[1:32:38] I laid down the law
[1:32:41] and I said you will not
[1:32:45] see this young man
[1:32:47] in fact I called him
[1:32:50] and I say if I ever see your face again
[1:32:52] it'd be the worst day of your life
[1:32:56] and I I was serious that Rod had Nails
[1:33:00] in it
[1:33:02] and
[1:33:03] and
[1:33:05] what kept my daughter at home
[1:33:10] what kept her from running off
[1:33:14] there was a foundation built and it's in
[1:33:18] that first Timothy that I just read that
[1:33:22] it was a foundation built not because of
[1:33:24] me telling them and threatening them
[1:33:26] you're gonna you're gonna do this and
[1:33:28] your face is going to fall off and and
[1:33:30] all of these nonsense things and me not
[1:33:33] living the life but she had love at home
[1:33:39] and we we build this this church and we
[1:33:44] we build our our lives and Friends it is
[1:33:48] so important that we are representing
[1:33:50] the Lord Jesus Christ at home first
[1:33:55] and when my daughter told me she
[1:33:57] listened she she did what I I said
[1:34:01] and I told her I said it's me or him
[1:34:05] I was firm on it because I knew and
[1:34:08] thank God I did it
[1:34:10] I'm so grateful that I did it because
[1:34:13] she's got the best
[1:34:15] husband that you could ever meet as far
[1:34:17] as a as far as a husband and a good kid
[1:34:20] now and
[1:34:22] and when I was talking to her
[1:34:25] just me and her we we set up a date
[1:34:27] night that we would go out once a week
[1:34:29] once every couple weeks and it was just
[1:34:31] me and me and her and it and I would we
[1:34:34] would talk and and
[1:34:36] I said sweetheart I'm just proud of you
[1:34:38] and you know what she said she said Dad
[1:34:41] she said Do You Remember
[1:34:46] when you'd pray
[1:34:48] she said
[1:34:50] you know I heard you
[1:34:53] I said I said what sweetie she said
[1:34:55] you'd go into the middle bedroom
[1:34:58] and she said I could hear you through
[1:35:00] the wall
[1:35:02] and that's what built it up it wasn't
[1:35:04] what I told her
[1:35:05] it wasn't that I threatened her
[1:35:08] it wasn't that I took a staff and beat
[1:35:10] her it was because she witnessed her dad
[1:35:14] in that other room praying
[1:35:17] she said I couldn't hear what you said
[1:35:19] but I knew from the tone of your voice
[1:35:21] that you were praying
[1:35:23] she said she said dad and and she said
[1:35:27] you know I would listen
[1:35:30] everything that I could say
[1:35:32] every scripture or every quote or
[1:35:35] whatever it was it would be meaningless
[1:35:38] if I didn't live that life to back it up
[1:35:43] we should be living that life or our
[1:35:46] testimonies thrown right out the window
[1:35:49] how many times do I hear criticism
[1:35:51] hear criticism of people not looking
[1:35:54] like like people think that they should
[1:35:56] look or or this person's not he doesn't
[1:35:58] she he doesn't line up the way I think
[1:36:01] it should be or she doesn't line up the
[1:36:03] way that I think it should be and I look
[1:36:05] at their lives the people that are
[1:36:07] saying that
[1:36:09] you're gonna be kidding me
[1:36:12] that's what did it for my daughter
[1:36:15] was her dad in that room praying even
[1:36:17] though she couldn't even hear what I was
[1:36:19] saying I didn't know she could hear what
[1:36:20] I I didn't even know that's why I went
[1:36:22] in that room because it was private
[1:36:25] and yet that's what won my daughter
[1:36:29] was her dad living I look at my son so
[1:36:32] proud of the kid
[1:36:34] you know and then and the Lord dealing
[1:36:36] with him and going there
[1:36:38] you know what one him is the four
[1:36:40] o'clock in the morning me getting up
[1:36:43] and studying and praying and the little
[1:36:45] guy getting up with me
[1:36:48] for years
[1:36:50] doing that
[1:36:51] wasn't what I told him
[1:36:55] it was the example that I set
[1:36:57] and even with all my failures and the
[1:37:00] kids knowing my wife knows that I've got
[1:37:02] many of them
[1:37:04] but setting that example
[1:37:07] and then
[1:37:09] when the wolves come in
[1:37:13] get them dad
[1:37:16] I'll pull that club in no way
[1:37:18] not my kids
[1:37:20] and the same thing friends with all of
[1:37:22] us
[1:37:23] in this church
[1:37:26] we're all Shepherds to a certain extent
[1:37:29] and we're all sheep
[1:37:31] there's a time to pull that club
[1:37:34] and you better have the life to back it
[1:37:37] up
[1:37:38] you better do it because Jesus warned
[1:37:42] brother Branham warned
[1:37:45] that
[1:37:46] these times were coming this they
[1:37:50] wouldn't endure sound doctrine that all
[1:37:53] of this strangeness and all of this
[1:37:55] weirdness would would follow and and we
[1:37:57] see people are so afraid that they're
[1:38:00] going to be kicked out and they're so
[1:38:01] afraid what other people going to think
[1:38:02] what about what God thinks of your life
[1:38:06] he knows what you're doing in your
[1:38:08] private time
[1:38:09] you can point all your fingers all you
[1:38:11] want God knows exactly what you are
[1:38:14] doing
[1:38:16] and let me tell you let me give you a
[1:38:18] warning don't be pointing fingers
[1:38:20] because they'll be three point right
[1:38:22] back at you
[1:38:23] I've made that mistake
[1:38:26] let me tell you
[1:38:28] I lived
[1:38:29] as legalistic and as right and I still
[1:38:32] do as I can
[1:38:34] but I've realized that Lord I'm a
[1:38:38] failure just like sister Irma singing
[1:38:40] that song
[1:38:41] wow
[1:38:43] I am the miracle
[1:38:45] I Lord I don't know how why what but
[1:38:51] thank God you saved me
[1:38:54] thank God that you did it for me that
[1:38:57] that you took care of me because I'm a
[1:38:59] failure I'm a sinner and I've done I've
[1:39:01] done everything wrong and I look and the
[1:39:03] reason
[1:39:04] was a simple thing and being in prayer
[1:39:07] you go into your closet and pray in
[1:39:09] private
[1:39:11] and then God took takes care of it with
[1:39:13] our kids
[1:39:14] and it's never too late
[1:39:16] it is never don't ever think that that
[1:39:19] because you're old or whatever you will
[1:39:22] always be a mother you will always be a
[1:39:24] father
[1:39:25] if you have children those that time
[1:39:28] never ends
[1:39:29] and you always watch out for them you
[1:39:32] always take care of them and when those
[1:39:34] wolves come in
[1:39:36] and try to ruin
[1:39:39] everything
[1:39:41] then you can fight them off because you
[1:39:44] have set that example when I said that
[1:39:46] about sister Brandon when I heard that
[1:39:51] I thought Lord this is exactly what he
[1:39:54] said don't do
[1:39:56] I read the quote
[1:39:59] Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal the
[1:40:02] message
[1:40:03] and what do we do we go and do the same
[1:40:05] thing and what does it do it cuts people
[1:40:07] out and it puts fear in the people that
[1:40:10] they are trying to please man rather
[1:40:12] than pleasing God
[1:40:15] and it destroys everything you know what
[1:40:18] it does
[1:40:19] it takes the love
[1:40:22] out of the people it takes the love
[1:40:26] out of the
[1:40:28] believers
[1:40:30] there's there's one more scripture I
[1:40:32] wanted to read
[1:40:34] I'm so far off my nose brother Jeremy if
[1:40:36] you could put up first John
[1:40:47] first John
[1:40:49] 4 17.
[1:40:57] it's dominated
[1:41:01] by fear
[1:41:03] herein is our love made perfect
[1:41:06] that we may have boldness in the day of
[1:41:09] judgment
[1:41:11] because as he is so are we in this world
[1:41:16] there is no fear in love
[1:41:18] but perfect love casteth out fear
[1:41:20] because fear hath torment
[1:41:23] he that feareth is not made perfect in
[1:41:25] love we love him
[1:41:27] because he first loved us
[1:41:30] the musicians could come
[1:41:33] friends
[1:41:36] I want us to get back to this original
[1:41:42] word
[1:41:43] to get back to Pentecost
[1:41:46] to get back to to what God has ordained
[1:41:50] for us but then when we go and we we
[1:41:52] change what he said and we we denominate
[1:41:55] it it pulls the spirit out
[1:41:59] because there's no love there
[1:42:02] it destroys it
[1:42:05] the reason
[1:42:07] my family is was as close to brother
[1:42:10] Branham as any other family both sides
[1:42:13] and the thing about brother Branham was
[1:42:15] when they would get around him he had
[1:42:17] absolute love
[1:42:21] no matter what they were doing I look at
[1:42:23] the two sides of my family
[1:42:26] look at the one side that was a rough
[1:42:28] group
[1:42:30] now look the other side my mom's side
[1:42:32] was a very very clean and very um Pious
[1:42:36] group
[1:42:38] yet he treated both of them the same
[1:42:41] and how much he how what an example he
[1:42:45] sent to the people so much that they
[1:42:49] would do whatever he said because he had
[1:42:53] such love
[1:42:55] and there is no fear
[1:42:57] and love he would never beat the people
[1:43:01] like we see today and try to instill
[1:43:03] fear
[1:43:05] in them
[1:43:08] think about
[1:43:13] I just I want to say it
[1:43:16] people get hurt
[1:43:19] they get hurt
[1:43:22] because
[1:43:24] of
[1:43:25] being condemned and being beaten down
[1:43:29] and then they do what we call they leave
[1:43:33] the message
[1:43:35] how can you leave something if it's not
[1:43:38] a denomination
[1:43:40] how ridiculous is that statement
[1:43:43] they leave did they leave Christ
[1:43:48] that's different
[1:43:49] but they leave this
[1:43:53] what they're doing is they're leaving
[1:43:55] they're leaving it because it didn't
[1:43:57] take hold at the beginning and maybe it
[1:43:59] wasn't presented in the right way in
[1:44:01] love
[1:44:03] so we need to present this in love and
[1:44:07] present this to our children and you
[1:44:09] young people
[1:44:11] when you grow up when you have a family
[1:44:14] put God first all of the time
[1:44:17] that we spent in our devotions studying
[1:44:20] the Bible
[1:44:21] all of the time that my family and I we
[1:44:24] spent praying together that we spent
[1:44:27] listening to the message to to reading
[1:44:30] and and all of that it
[1:44:33] pays dividends in the future I promise
[1:44:35] you
[1:44:37] love your kids love your families for
[1:44:42] God loved us
[1:44:44] and that's the difference between those
[1:44:47] two staffs bless me so much you got the
[1:44:50] staff and you got the club the staff
[1:44:53] is for our families
[1:44:55] and the sheep and the club is to fight
[1:44:58] off those wolves and you got to use both
[1:45:01] of them you got to have them both God
[1:45:03] bless you all
[1:45:05] brother Aaron
[1:45:16] Lord
[1:45:18] prepare
[1:45:21] to be a sanctuary
[1:45:26] [Music]
[1:45:37] pride and
[1:45:39] truth

[1:47:11] my girls used to ask me
[1:47:13] dad or tell me we're growing up now

[1:47:35] still cares

[1:47:41] greater Is Our Father oh amen it means
[1:47:44] so much
[1:47:45] friends there it is prophesied
[1:47:49] and we have seen them every one of you
[1:47:53] just like I have seen these wolves come
[1:47:58] in
[1:48:00] and Destroy and divide and to make it
[1:48:04] about themselves
[1:48:06] rather than lifting up the Lord Jesus
[1:48:09] never fear a man
[1:48:12] never fear what he says
[1:48:16] fear God in him only
[1:48:20] because that man
[1:48:21] [Music]
[1:48:23] if he's right
[1:48:24] he's going to point you to the one
[1:48:27] that can take care of you the one that
[1:48:29] can can take care of any problem
[1:48:31] [Music]
[1:48:34] but another one will point you to
[1:48:36] himself
[1:48:38] and do it with fear
[1:48:42] it's Bower heads
[1:48:43] [Music]
[1:48:50] I believe that he'll be right tonight
[1:48:54] [Music]
[1:48:57] if we devote
[1:48:58] [Music]
[1:49:00] a service to prayer
[1:49:04] [Music]
[1:49:06] if you would want to come tonight and
[1:49:10] be with us here at the church and
[1:49:13] sing a few songs and
[1:49:16] and just pray to the
[1:49:19] to the one that
[1:49:22] the one that hung the Stars
[1:49:25] the Sun and the Moon and the sky
[1:49:30] the vote
[1:49:32] some prayer to worshiping him tonight
[1:49:35] there's nothing that I could ever say or
[1:49:38] anybody that's else that could ever say
[1:49:40] that could take that place
[1:49:42] of spending a little bit of time in
[1:49:44] prayer with our savior
[1:49:47] [Music]
[1:49:48] so we'll have the church open tonight
[1:49:51] [Music]
[1:49:53] we can we can gather together
[1:49:58] you know there was a time
[1:50:01] when they gathered together for a prayer
[1:50:03] meeting
[1:50:06] and the walls shook from the power of
[1:50:09] God
[1:50:12] Lord
[1:50:14] Let Us return to that
[1:50:17] father protect us
[1:50:20] from these wolves that come in
[1:50:24] Lord let us stand for your gospel let us
[1:50:29] stand for what's what's right
[1:50:34] Lord
[1:50:35] it is written in your word that though I
[1:50:37] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[1:50:39] death
[1:50:40] I will fear no evil for thou art with me
[1:50:44] Lord you're with us
[1:50:49] and pray Lord that we could
[1:50:53] we could just get closer to you and
[1:50:55] thank you
[1:50:58] father I pray for our congregation
[1:51:01] that you would protect us
[1:51:04] from this spirit that the Apostle Paul
[1:51:06] warned about
[1:51:07] the spirit that Jesus warned about
[1:51:10] [Music]
[1:51:12] Lord that we would look out for each
[1:51:14] other
[1:51:16] take care of each other
[1:51:19] lift each other up
[1:51:22] and warn each other and strengthen each
