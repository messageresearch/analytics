[34:53] thank you for being here Welcome to our
[34:56] Wednesday night bible study
[34:58] we're continuing to investigate the life
[35:00] of Joseph the lessons that it has for us
[35:04] the last few weeks brother Daniel has
[35:06] brought us lessons about generational
[35:09] curses and blessings the nature of and
[35:12] need for repentance we'll see these two
[35:15] themes play a major role in tonight's
[35:17] portion of Genesis and uh by the way
[35:21] there's a little single sheet handout
[35:23] with the verses and some of the images
[35:24] tonight back at the ab Booth when you
[35:27] leave if you'd like like a
[35:28] copy before we resume our study though
[35:31] let's one more time join our hearts
[35:33] together before the Lord in
[35:37] prayer Lord Jesus it's such an
[35:41] honor Lord to come together to come
[35:45] together by choice not being forced not
[35:47] being prevented but Lord because we just
[35:49] want to be with each other we want to be
[35:51] with you we want to draw closer to you
[35:54] we want to know you better Lord we look
[35:57] to your your word we look to your spirit
[35:59] Lord accept our worship this evening
[36:01] Lord accept our praise accept our
[36:05] prayers Lord we just pray that you'd
[36:07] guide whatever is said this evening Lord
[36:09] that it would help some Lord and that it
[36:12] would hinder none and we thank you in
[36:15] the mighty precious name of Jesus Christ
[36:18] Our Lord
[36:21] amen for our opening verses I'd like to
[36:24] read three short passages they bear on
[36:28] events in Joseph's life and the parallel
[36:30] life of his brother Judah which we'll
[36:33] cover in tonight's lesson God willing
[36:36] two readings from the gospels and one
[36:40] from Genesis the first is found in Mark
[36:45] 15 is that the
[36:48] crucifixion some of the very last words
[36:51] that Jesus ever
[36:53] SP at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a
[36:57] loud voice voice saying in Aramaic alo
[37:01] alo
[37:04] L which is being interpreted my God my
[37:10] God why hast Thou forsaken
[37:14] me here we see Jesus in the moments of
[37:17] his greatest
[37:18] suffering feeling completely
[37:21] alone not only abandoned by his
[37:24] disciples not only bearing ridicule from
[37:27] from the crowds not only physical
[37:30] torture and torment but abandoned by his
[37:34] own father who had his baptism had said
[37:37] from Heaven you are my beloved
[37:41] Son the second is a portion of the
[37:44] genealogy of Jesus adoptive father is
[37:48] mentioned presented in Matthew the first
[37:51] chapter when the names are from the
[37:53] Greek translation I'll read them from
[37:55] the Old Testament version of the name as
[37:57] we go through these few verses may make
[37:59] it easier to relate as we proceed this
[38:02] evening the book of the generation of
[38:05] Jesus Christ the son descendant of David
[38:08] descendant of Abraham Abraham begat
[38:12] Isaac Isaac begat Jacob Jacob begat
[38:16] Judah and his Brethren Judah begat farz
[38:20] and Zarah of Tamar and farz begat hezron
[38:24] and hezron begat Ram
[38:27] there's something in this thread of
[38:29] generations that should give us hope
[38:33] strengthen our faith assure us of God's
[38:37] grace we'll get to that a bit later this
[38:40] evening and finally two verses from
[38:43] Genesis 41 that were part of our
[38:46] previous uh Wednesday
[38:49] evening and the story of Joseph Genesis
[38:53] 41 verses 50 and 51
[39:03] seem to be having a minor technical
[39:06] difficulty here let's try this
[39:11] again um could you advance the slide
[39:14] please thank
[39:16] you and unto Joseph were born two sons
[39:21] before the years of famine came which
[39:23] asath the daughter of poera priest of
[39:26] own be to him Joseph called the name of
[39:30] the firstborn
[39:32] manasse causing to forget for God said
[39:36] he hath made me forget all my toil and
[39:40] all my father's house another
[39:43] translation says God has caused me to
[39:46] forget the troubles I suffered at the
[39:48] hands of my
[39:50] family please be
[39:53] seated last time Joseph came from
[39:56] Piper's dungeon to Pharaoh's Palace and
[39:58] interpreted Pharaoh's dreams Pharaoh
[40:01] promoted Joseph to be number two in the
[40:03] Kingdom he engineered and had built
[40:06] perhaps the first major Waterworks
[40:08] project in the world known even today as
[40:10] the Joseph Canal thank you to supply the
[40:14] fume Basin and approximately double the
[40:18] cultivated land area of ancient Egypt
[40:21] this assured sufficient grain to feed
[40:24] the people during the upcoming
[40:26] famine along the way we saw biblical and
[40:29] other evidence to determine the years
[40:31] and confirm the Pharaohs of Joseph's
[40:34] time the famine was not only in Egypt
[40:37] but in surrounding areas including
[40:39] Canaan where Jacob and his family began
[40:43] to face
[40:44] starvation let's pick up our story as
[40:47] Jacob prepares to send his sons to Egypt
[40:50] to buy
[40:52] Grain Genesis 421 now when Jacob saw
[40:56] that there was Grand available in Egypt
[40:59] Jacob said to his
[41:00] sons why do you look upon one another he
[41:05] said behold I I have heard there's food
[41:07] in
[41:08] Egypt get up and and get down there buy
[41:12] Grain for us so that we may live and not
[41:14] just sit around until we all
[41:19] die Egypt it's been about 22 years but
[41:24] nine of the sons remembered what they
[41:26] had done selling their brother Joseph to
[41:29] be a slave in
[41:32] Egypt and Joseph's 10 older brothers
[41:35] went down to buy Grain in Egypt but
[41:38] Benjamin Joseph's full brother Jacob
[41:41] sent not with his brethren for he said
[41:44] lest perhaps some Mischief befall
[41:48] him the sons of Israel came to buy Grain
[41:51] among those that came for the famine was
[41:54] in the land of Canaan
[41:57] among those that came it's an important
[42:00] statement to help set the context for
[42:03] what happens next the famine wasn't
[42:05] confined to Egypt but was experienced in
[42:07] the surrounding areas as well this makes
[42:11] this famine really severe it's not only
[42:13] affecting the weather pattern 2,300
[42:15] miles to the South and the highlands of
[42:18] Equatorial Africa which source the Nile
[42:21] here's the equator here's these high
[42:23] mountains the highest mountain highest
[42:24] point Mount kilamanjaro at 6,000 meters
[42:27] nearly so this is very high area you've
[42:30] got uh what's now Lake Victoria feeding
[42:32] the White Nile mountains of Ethiopia
[42:35] feeding the Blue Nile joining at carum
[42:37] now it becomes red but only on the map
[42:40] not in the water unless Moses is cursing
[42:41] it and that Nile then flows north into
[42:46] the
[42:47] Mediterranean but it's not just
[42:49] affecting Egypt and that it's also
[42:52] affecting the weather up here in the
[42:53] Eastern Mediterranean
[42:57] and these strange conditions will
[43:00] persist for seven
[43:03] years the result is that people are
[43:05] coming from all over the region to
[43:06] obtain grain keep in mind that while
[43:09] there are Empires that are forming and
[43:11] what is
[43:12] now
[43:14] Iraq Iran turkey this area these Empires
[43:18] are beginning but they're in very early
[43:20] stages National governments like we
[43:22] think of hardly exist Egypt is very
[43:25] unusual in that regard
[43:28] Canaan consists of various city states
[43:30] for example there would be many small
[43:32] diverse groups coming to Egypt to buy
[43:34] food roads are more like Trails unpaved
[43:38] paths no trucks awaiting entry to Gaza
[43:41] with thousands of tons of supplies no
[43:44] trains no planes no container vessels
[43:48] just pack animals mostly donkeys carts
[43:51] or wagons would be crude and slow with
[43:54] wooden axles and wooden Wheels
[43:58] no tires subject to frequent breakdowns
[44:01] so they couldn't be loaded very heavily
[44:03] no proper suspension systems and they
[44:06] were pulled by animals which also need
[44:08] food and
[44:10] water not all nearby city states are
[44:12] friendly Egypt wasn't always a nice
[44:14] neighbor often conducting raids into
[44:17] neighboring territories so the Egyptians
[44:20] have to set up border checkpoints and so
[44:21] forth more so than normal in the past no
[44:24] one had passports credentials they
[44:26] couldn't fly flash their iPhone and get
[44:28] past the border so there had to be other
[44:31] means by which you would check people
[44:32] and be sure they had a valid reason for
[44:35] coming Egypt would be worried that some
[44:38] of these neighbors under the guise of
[44:40] coming for grain or perhaps just taking
[44:42] advantage of it will be spying reporting
[44:46] back to the local governments on what
[44:47] they see in Egypt probing looking for
[44:50] possible weaknesses things that they can
[44:52] exploit in future
[44:55] conflicts and since Egypt eypt is also
[44:57] experiencing a severe famine it is
[45:00] weakened much of its military is
[45:02] deployed to guard the granaries from
[45:04] theft the result is a heightened concern
[45:07] about foreigners taking advantage of the
[45:09] famine to identify weaknesses in
[45:12] Egypt such was the economic political
[45:16] and Military
[45:19] context and Joseph known as Zapf panea
[45:24] was the governor over the land of E
[45:27] Egypt and he it was that sold to all the
[45:29] people of the land Joseph's Brethren
[45:32] came to Zapf pan and bowed down
[45:36] themselves before him with their faces
[45:39] to the
[45:40] Earth it's unlikely that Egyptians far
[45:43] up the Nile had to come all the way down
[45:44] to Joseph and then go home with grain
[45:46] there were storehouses all over the land
[45:48] but it appears that foreigners were
[45:50] required to see the viser of all
[45:55] Egypt and Joseph saw his Brethren and
[45:58] recognized them but made himself strange
[46:01] unto
[46:02] them it's not too hard with a shaved
[46:06] body a wig not his natural hair color a
[46:10] golden signate ring eyeliner speaking
[46:14] Egyptian and named zapa panea and
[46:17] smelling a bit like a spice
[46:19] Caravan no it wasn't too hard and he
[46:22] spake roughly unto them them that had
[46:25] been so grously cruel to
[46:30] him and zfa said through an interpreter
[46:35] unto them whence Come Ye and they said
[46:40] from the land of Canaan to buy
[46:42] food Joseph recognized his Brethren but
[46:45] they didn't recognize
[46:46] him Joseph remembered the dreams which
[46:50] he had dreamed of them which doesn't
[46:52] mean that he'd forgotten those dreams
[46:53] just that they came to his mind at that
[46:55] point as his brothers were bowed down to
[46:58] him fulfilling his first
[47:01] Dream and he said unto them your spies
[47:05] to see the nakedness of the land you're
[47:07] come playing into the paranoia of the
[47:10] time and maybe just maybe seeing he now
[47:14] has the upper hand over
[47:17] them careful
[47:19] Joseph and they said unto him nay my
[47:23] lord they're afraid spying is punishable
[47:26] by death zapa has the power to have them
[47:30] killed they're veh in their denial n my
[47:34] Lord but but to buy food are thy
[47:35] servants come we're all one man's Sons
[47:38] we're all true men Joseph thinks yeah
[47:42] right true to whom true to what thy
[47:46] servants are no
[47:48] spies and he as Zapf panea the man with
[47:53] the power to snap his fingers order to
[47:55] their deaths no further questions asked
[47:56] no no trial no defense attorney no
[47:59] appeals said unto them nay but to see
[48:03] the nakedness of the land are you come
[48:05] you say you're true and honest I don't
[48:07] believe you you're lying you're
[48:09] spying sometime during this
[48:12] interrogation he asked have you a father
[48:14] or a
[48:15] brother and they said thy servants are
[48:18] 12 brother and the sons of one man in
[48:21] the in the land of Canaan and behold the
[48:23] youngest is his day with our father oh
[48:26] how that Revelation must have hurt and
[48:29] what is
[48:31] not and Joseph as zafa panea said unto
[48:36] them that's what I spake unto you saying
[48:39] you're
[48:40] spies right on the off chance you may
[48:43] actually be telling me the truth hereby
[48:46] you shall be
[48:48] proved by the life of pharaoh you shall
[48:51] not go forth from here except your
[48:53] youngest
[48:54] brother come hither
[48:57] not your father or not even with your
[49:00] father just your youngest
[49:04] brother send one of you let him fetch
[49:07] your brother and and ye the the rest of
[49:09] you will be kept in prison that your
[49:12] words may be proved whether there be any
[49:14] truth in you or else by the life of
[49:17] pharaoh surely you are
[49:21] spies that's a really strange
[49:24] test if they were lying all all they had
[49:27] to do is get someone to come back from
[49:28] Canaan and claim to be the younger
[49:30] brother and an effect called zafaf Pan's
[49:34] Bluff how would he know this Egyptian
[49:37] guy how could this be a truth
[49:40] test but the tenor and fear for their
[49:43] lives not thinking clearly they came in
[49:46] peace with money to buy Grain and now
[49:49] look at their
[49:50] situation and
[49:52] why why is Joseph only concerned about
[49:55] seeing his full brother Benjamin and not
[49:58] his
[50:00] dad stay with
[50:03] me and he Joseph put them all together
[50:07] into Ward not The Roundhouse the VIP
[50:09] prison that he was in but place called a
[50:12] a place of bondage a house of bondage he
[50:14] put in there for three days likely the
[50:18] time he'd spent in the sistern and
[50:21] Dothan wondering about his life
[50:27] and Joseph had them brought to him and
[50:31] said unto them the third day this do and
[50:34] live for I Fear God they've had three
[50:38] days to be in fear for their lives
[50:41] Joseph also had three days to consider
[50:43] his own actions toward them to develop a
[50:47] plan a test to see if they were the same
[50:50] crew that had mistreated him the same
[50:53] crew that had slaughtered the men of
[50:55] sheam or if They Were Somehow different
[50:58] now and in spite of his probable desire
[51:01] for Retribution Joseph knows he can't
[51:04] follow through on those kinds of
[51:05] thoughts he has to resist them
[51:09] why because he fears he respects God
[51:14] he's seen God's hand in his life how God
[51:16] is using him to save the lives of so
[51:19] many remember all this
[51:21] conversation is being handled through an
[51:24] interpreter zafaf pan is speaking
[51:27] Egyptian the brothers are speaking
[51:30] Hebrew this do and live for I Fear God
[51:33] if you be true men let one of your
[51:36] brethren be bound in the house of your
[51:38] prison go carry grain for the Famine of
[51:42] your
[51:43] houses three days earlier he was going
[51:46] to send one and keep the rest of them in
[51:48] prison now he's keeping one in prison
[51:51] and sending the rest why sending one
[51:56] with all all that
[51:57] food through a land that is starving
[52:00] would be inviting attack by others
[52:02] coming to Egypt to get food wheat was
[52:04] like gold now there'd be a large enough
[52:07] group to dissuade any potential attack
[52:10] on the 250 to perhaps 300 mile Journey
[52:14] back home through the
[52:17] desert but bring your youngest brother
[52:20] to me Joseph longs to see his little
[52:23] brother again don't bother to bring
[52:25] Jacob just bring Benjamin again you must
[52:29] ask
[52:32] why why why doesn't he want to see his
[52:35] dad what's going on so shall your words
[52:38] be verified and ye shall not
[52:41] die and they did
[52:43] so and about this time there's probably
[52:46] a conversation in Genesis 44 21- 23 that
[52:50] we'll just insert here because it's
[52:52] likely when it
[52:54] happened and and Joseph said bring him
[52:57] down unto me that I may set my eyes upon
[52:59] him that's what Joseph wants that's why
[53:02] I put Joseph's name there and and they
[53:05] said the lad cannot leave his father if
[53:07] he should if he should leave his father
[53:09] his father would die and zapa pan said
[53:14] except your youngest brother come down
[53:16] with you you shall see my face no more
[53:19] no more food you'll all die of
[53:25] starvation again
[53:27] why would Joseph insist on seeing
[53:30] Benjamin even if it meant his dad might
[53:33] die of a broken heart does he think ah
[53:35] you're just exaggerating he's not going
[53:37] to die of a broken heart or is there
[53:39] some other reason is there something
[53:41] else at
[53:43] play
[53:45] watch and they Joseph's brother said one
[53:49] to another we're very guilty concerning
[53:53] our brother Joseph and that we saw the
[53:56] anguish of his soul when he besought
[53:59] when he begged us and we would not hear
[54:02] therefore is this distress come upon us
[54:05] yeah Joseph's thinking you got that
[54:08] right I begged and pleaded with you
[54:10] so-called honest men you just laughed
[54:14] hit me again then sold me to the
[54:17] ishmaelites I'm being far nicer to you
[54:19] than you
[54:21] deserve listen closely now Joseph is
[54:27] and
[54:28] Reuben
[54:30] unknowingly back again in the role of
[54:32] Reuben The Rescuer I love this part
[54:35] Reuben answered them saying spake I not
[54:39] unto you saying do not sin against the
[54:42] child and you would not
[54:44] hear Joseph is thinking yeah right
[54:47] Reuben you instigated me being violently
[54:50] thrown into the empty system for three
[54:52] days before you conveniently
[54:55] disappeared therefore for behold also
[54:58] his blood is
[55:00] required and Joseph's blood runs
[55:04] cold they knew not that Joseph
[55:07] understood them for he spake unto them
[55:09] as zapan a pan by an interpreter and he
[55:13] turned himself about from them and
[55:16] wept what's going
[55:19] on Joseph has just had a
[55:21] shock probably second only to the shock
[55:24] of being beaten and sold to the
[55:25] ishmaelites
[55:27] or maybe
[55:28] greater for 22 long years he was certain
[55:34] of something that he now realized was
[55:37] probably not
[55:39] true remember the Battleground with
[55:42] Satan is in our minds Joseph's no
[55:46] different than you no different than me
[55:49] we each experience things we understand
[55:52] those experiences from our personal
[55:54] perspective like the brother that stands
[55:55] here some some time and says now you
[55:57] were telling me that this puppet has a
[55:59] cross on it not true I don't see the
[56:02] cross I see a cabinet doors and a shelf
[56:05] and you say what are you talking about
[56:06] brother L there's a cross there well
[56:08] different perspectives looking at the
[56:10] same thing Joseph's experiences in
[56:13] Dothan were brutal but he didn't have
[56:16] the whole
[56:17] picture now he's exposed to a vital
[56:19] truth that will change his whole outlook
[56:22] on his past and on his Dysfunctional
[56:25] Family
[56:26] remember the rule God laid out for Noah
[56:29] After the flood God speaking to Noah in
[56:32] Genesis
[56:33] 9 and surely your blood of your lives
[56:36] will I require at the hand of every
[56:38] Beast will I require it and at the hand
[56:41] of man at at the hand of Every Man's
[56:43] brother will I require the life of man
[56:46] who so shedthemusic
[56:56] or manslaughter that's why they set up
[56:58] the Cities of Refuge if somebody
[57:00] accidentally killed someone there was no
[57:03] bad intent there was nothing if he could
[57:05] get to the City of Refuge they couldn't
[57:07] get to him until he could plead his case
[57:09] before a judge there right and and if it
[57:12] turned out that it really was an
[57:13] accidental thing there was
[57:15] no culpability well then the guy was
[57:18] safe as long as he stayed in that City
[57:20] of Refuge this is a very strong law
[57:22] established from the time of
[57:24] Noah and the state by Reuben
[57:28] behold also his blood is required is
[57:32] another way of saying Joseph was killed
[57:36] and now we have to pay the price his
[57:38] life was taken and now our lives are
[57:42] forfeit and these words of Reuben shock
[57:47] Joseph Shake him to his very
[57:51] core
[57:54] why initially the first wave of the
[57:57] shock because Joseph thought ruin was in
[57:59] on the plan to sell him into Egyptian
[58:02] slavery after all it was his idea to can
[58:04] find Joseph in a pit now he realizes
[58:07] that Not only was Reuben ignorant of
[58:09] what then happened to Joseph but that
[58:11] Reuben had stood up for him against his
[58:14] brothers Reuben wasn't present when
[58:16] Joseph was handed over to the Israelites
[58:18] but apart from that bit of knowledge
[58:21] Joseph had no idea of Ruben's role at
[58:24] Dothan
[58:27] then the second wave adding to the shock
[58:31] he realizes that the other nine were
[58:34] content to let Reuben believe
[58:38] this why would they let him believe that
[58:43] lie that Joseph was
[58:45] dead and what's the gut-wrenching
[58:49] implication the realization that sends
[58:52] him from them to weep and anguish
[58:59] this must be why he never heard from his
[59:03] dad Jacob because if Ruben believes
[59:06] Joseph was
[59:08] killed then Jacob probably believes it
[59:12] too it's not knowledge commonly within
[59:15] the family apart from the nine guilty
[59:17] brothers that Joseph was sold to slavery
[59:20] they saw the coat dipped in goat's blood
[59:23] and thought Joseph was dead his dad must
[59:26] have also been deceived into thinking
[59:27] Joseph was dead the nine covered up
[59:30] their treachery with some other lie some
[59:32] way to convince both Reuben and Jacob
[59:36] that Joseph had been killed and not by
[59:43] them have you ever asked yourself this
[59:45] question perhaps as we've been going
[59:47] through this series or thought about
[59:49] it why did Joseph never reach out to his
[59:52] dad who had loved and protected Joseph
[59:55] as his favorite favorite
[59:57] son we talked about Joseph appealing to
[1:00:00] the ishmaelites when he was being my
[1:00:02] dad's a rich man I'm his favorite take
[1:00:04] me up there you get a lot more money
[1:00:06] from him than you will selling me down
[1:00:08] in Egypt but they wouldn't listen to
[1:00:12] him Joseph never understood why his dad
[1:00:16] didn't send a couple of fast camels with
[1:00:18] money or armed servants to rescue him
[1:00:21] during that horrible two week forced
[1:00:23] march across the sin into Egypt
[1:00:26] Abraham rescued his nephew lot why
[1:00:29] wouldn't Jacob rescue his
[1:00:32] son he never understood why Jacob never
[1:00:36] tried to find him and by his freedom
[1:00:39] after he was sold as a slave where are
[1:00:42] you Dad why don't you come for me I
[1:00:46] thought you loved me I thought you cared
[1:00:48] about me was I wrong my father my father
[1:00:53] why have you forsaken me
[1:00:57] why was he simply
[1:00:59] forgotten left to live in misery and die
[1:01:02] in pain as a slave in
[1:01:05] Egypt it's the most likely reason why
[1:01:08] Joseph never tried to reach out to his
[1:01:10] father once he was able to do so it
[1:01:13] would have been possible at some point
[1:01:15] as pifer's Chief Operating Officer
[1:01:18] easily done by the number two man in
[1:01:20] Egypt for the last eight plus
[1:01:23] years why didn't he
[1:01:26] because Joseph thought that Jacob had
[1:01:29] written him off that his dad somehow
[1:01:31] knew but didn't care about his
[1:01:35] plight either way he didn't want to see
[1:01:37] him Joseph was in anguish and pain over
[1:01:39] his rejection by his own
[1:01:42] dad but now Joseph suddenly suspects the
[1:01:48] reason Jacob never tried to rescue him
[1:01:51] the nine brothers had convinced Reuben
[1:01:53] and therefore likely Jacob that
[1:01:56] Joseph was
[1:01:57] dead and that's why up to this point
[1:02:00] Joseph showed strong interest only in
[1:02:03] Benjamin not his dad why would he name
[1:02:06] his firstborn son
[1:02:09] manasse caused to forget I can see him
[1:02:12] holding his infant son rocking him
[1:02:15] gently telling him in
[1:02:17] tears my dad said he loved me when I
[1:02:20] needed him the most he wasn't there I'll
[1:02:24] do a better job with you son I'll love
[1:02:27] and protect you as he should have done
[1:02:28] me I can forget that whole bunch now
[1:02:31] that I have you
[1:02:34] manasse but now what is Joseph gonna do
[1:02:39] now overcome with emotion at this sudden
[1:02:42] realization based on an overheard chance
[1:02:46] comment from Ruben to his brothers this
[1:02:49] twist in his entire thinking and mindset
[1:02:52] for the last 22 years
[1:02:56] and he turned himself about from them
[1:02:58] and wept and after regaining his
[1:03:01] composure washing his face fixing his
[1:03:05] eyeliner Zapf Pano returned to them
[1:03:08] again and conversed with them and then
[1:03:11] directing his guards took from them
[1:03:14] Simeon and bound him before their very
[1:03:16] eyes and sent him off to the
[1:03:20] dungeon the prison for the brothers is
[1:03:23] not the roundhouse the the VIP Detention
[1:03:25] Center where Joseph was held it's a
[1:03:27] house of
[1:03:28] bondage and why
[1:03:31] Simeon he was the second oldest and the
[1:03:34] one who undoubtedly consistent with his
[1:03:37] nature took pleasure in beating Joseph
[1:03:41] seeing him handed over to the
[1:03:44] Israelites then Joseph commanded to fill
[1:03:47] their sacks with grain and to restore
[1:03:49] Every Man's money into his sack and to
[1:03:51] give them provision for the way and thus
[1:03:54] did he unto them and this is all done an
[1:03:56] Egyptian the brothers don't really know
[1:03:58] what's going on they're completely
[1:03:59] unaware of the plan that Joseph is Now
[1:04:02] setting in
[1:04:05] motion and they the the nine brothers
[1:04:08] because simeon's in prison laided their
[1:04:10] asses with already filled and tied off
[1:04:13] sacks of grain and departed then from
[1:04:16] the
[1:04:18] graner and as one of them opened his
[1:04:20] sack to give his ass provender and all
[1:04:22] of their donkeys not just his at the in
[1:04:26] he saw his money for behold it was in
[1:04:29] his sack's mouth it wasn't buried within
[1:04:32] the sack it was right there right at the
[1:04:36] top all part of the plan all part of the
[1:04:40] test will these honest men return the
[1:04:43] money will they just go on to Canaan
[1:04:47] will they bring it back with Benjamin
[1:04:50] will they pretend it never
[1:04:54] happened and he said said unto his
[1:04:56] Brethren my money is restored it's it's
[1:04:59] in my sack and their heart failed them
[1:05:03] they were afraid saying one to another
[1:05:05] what is this that God hath done to
[1:05:09] us we've just escaped with our lives our
[1:05:12] brother Simeon is in Egypt probably is a
[1:05:15] slave to that strange man ZF pan who
[1:05:19] knows where he is or with whom what's
[1:05:22] going on this is a Strange Land This
[1:05:25] egyp eypt we need to get home figure
[1:05:27] things
[1:05:29] out and they came unto Jacob their
[1:05:31] father unto the land of Canaan and told
[1:05:34] him all that befell them saying the man
[1:05:39] Z AF pan who who's the lord of the land
[1:05:41] spake roughly to us took us for spies of
[1:05:44] the country we said unto him we're true
[1:05:47] men we're no
[1:05:49] spies we're 12 brothers the sons of our
[1:05:52] father one is not the youngest is this
[1:05:55] day with our father in the land of
[1:05:57] Canaan and the man the lord of the
[1:05:59] country said unto us hereby shall I know
[1:06:02] that you are true men leave one of your
[1:06:04] brethren here with me and take food for
[1:06:06] the Famine of your households and be
[1:06:07] gone bring your youngest breth unto me
[1:06:11] then I shall know that you're no spies
[1:06:12] but that you're true men and so will I
[1:06:16] return to you your brother and you shall
[1:06:17] be able to conduct business in the land
[1:06:20] of
[1:06:21] Egypt and it came to pass as a emptied
[1:06:25] their sacks that behold Every Man's
[1:06:29] bundle of money was in his sack and when
[1:06:32] both they and their father saw the
[1:06:34] bundles of money these aren't checks
[1:06:36] these isn't this isn't paper IUS or
[1:06:39] Federal Reserve notes these are gold
[1:06:41] coins silver coins these
[1:06:43] are uh these are real money they're
[1:06:47] they're they're not what you get when
[1:06:49] you push the button on your iPhone and
[1:06:52] they were afraid
[1:06:55] or
[1:06:56] or or even your Android and Jacob their
[1:07:00] father said unto
[1:07:02] them me have you bed of my children
[1:07:07] Joseph is
[1:07:08] not Simeon is
[1:07:11] not and now you will take Benjamin away
[1:07:14] all these things are against
[1:07:18] me and Reuben spake unto his father
[1:07:21] saying slay my two sons if I bring
[1:07:24] Benjamin not not back to thee deliver
[1:07:27] him into my hand and I will bring him to
[1:07:29] thee again my youngest boys
[1:07:33] either my youngest boys
[1:07:39] either and he Jacob said
[1:07:42] remember Jacob holds a grudge against
[1:07:45] Ruben for what he did regarding bilha
[1:07:48] and he'll hold it till his dying
[1:07:53] day my son
[1:07:56] Benjamin shall not go down with you for
[1:07:59] for his brother Joseph is dead he's left
[1:08:02] alone if if if Mischief if some Calamity
[1:08:05] be fallen by the way in which you go
[1:08:07] then shall you bring my gray hairs with
[1:08:10] sorrow to the
[1:08:14] Grave chapter
[1:08:17] 43 and the famine was sore in the land
[1:08:20] it continued when the man said to us ye
[1:08:23] shall not see my face except your
[1:08:25] brother be with
[1:08:27] you and Israel said wherefore have you
[1:08:31] dealt so ill with me Jacob is very
[1:08:36] self-focused as to tell the man whether
[1:08:38] you had yet a brother and he may have
[1:08:41] added something like look this guy's
[1:08:43] number two in Egypt hundreds of other
[1:08:46] groups have come to him for food he
[1:08:48] won't remember you I'm not risking the
[1:08:51] life of
[1:08:53] Benjamin and they said Pro probably a
[1:08:55] little
[1:08:56] exasperated dad the man asked us
[1:08:59] straightly of our state and of our
[1:09:01] Kindred saying is your father yet alive
[1:09:04] have ye another brother we told him
[1:09:06] according to the tenor of these
[1:09:07] questions could we certainly know he
[1:09:09] would say bring your brother
[1:09:12] down Judah said unto Israel his
[1:09:16] father send the lad with me not with us
[1:09:20] with me and we will arise and go that we
[1:09:25] may all live and not die both we and
[1:09:29] thou and also our little ones dad you
[1:09:34] you may think he won't remember us but
[1:09:36] we can't risk all of our Lives hoping he
[1:09:38] will have forgotten us have become her
[1:09:40] husband to raise a child to her Judah
[1:09:43] had promised this to her but he didn't
[1:09:45] follow through he had no intention to
[1:09:47] but she needed a child preferably a son
[1:09:49] for her Security in that place and
[1:09:53] time if there were no male children of
[1:09:55] Judah then he would be expected to siren
[1:09:58] Heir for her in the name of ER because
[1:10:00] in that time and culture women had few
[1:10:03] rights leverate marriage was a way to
[1:10:06] provide so tomarrow sets a trap for
[1:10:09] Judah she knows her father in- law knows
[1:10:12] his habits knows his
[1:10:15] inclinations when Judah saw her he
[1:10:18] thought her to be in Harlot because
[1:10:19] she'd covered her face a cultural
[1:10:22] identity and he turned under her by the
[1:10:24] way and said said go too I pray thee let
[1:10:27] me come in unto thee for he knew not
[1:10:30] that she was his
[1:10:32] daughter-in-law and she said what will
[1:10:34] thou give me that thou mayest come in
[1:10:37] unto me Judah really didn't know his
[1:10:41] daughter-in-law the veil would cover her
[1:10:42] face but not disguise her voice maybe
[1:10:46] she used a different voice to maintain
[1:10:47] the deception I known a few people that
[1:10:50] use different voices from time to time
[1:10:52] and he said I will send the a kid from
[1:10:55] the flock and she said wil thou give me
[1:10:58] a pledge till thou send it she is
[1:11:02] playing him
[1:11:04] perfectly and he said what pledge shall
[1:11:07] I give thee and she said Thy signant Thy
[1:11:11] bracelets and thy staff that is in thine
[1:11:14] hand and he gave it her giving up his
[1:11:17] symbols of authority bearing his name
[1:11:19] for a moment's distraction and came in
[1:11:23] unto her and she conceived by him and
[1:11:25] she arose and went away laid by her veil
[1:11:28] from her and put on the garments of her
[1:11:31] widowhood again telling the world of
[1:11:33] judah's failure as her
[1:11:37] father-in-law and Judah sent the kid the
[1:11:40] Little Goat that he' promised by the
[1:11:42] hand of his friend hyra the adullamite
[1:11:44] to receive his pledge from the woman's
[1:11:46] hand but HRA couldn't find her Judah
[1:11:50] doesn't want to be seen looking for a
[1:11:51] prostitute to pay her appearances are
[1:11:54] very important to Judah
[1:11:57] then hyra asked the men of that place
[1:12:00] saying where is the Harlot that was
[1:12:02] openly by the
[1:12:04] wayside and they said there was no
[1:12:06] harlot in this place hyra uses a
[1:12:10] different word translated as Harlot
[1:12:13] there's two words in Hebrew for this
[1:12:15] there were women who were prostitutes
[1:12:18] and then there were those who were what
[1:12:19] they called Temple or sacred prostitutes
[1:12:22] kesa the word being derived from ho
[1:12:26] cadesh there's no Pagan Temple near the
[1:12:29] place where Judah and HRA encountered
[1:12:30] tomor the men tell them he's
[1:12:32] mistaken Moses is using a clever play on
[1:12:35] words
[1:12:36] here how so tomorrow is actually forcing
[1:12:41] Judah to do what the law required of him
[1:12:45] thus her action can be considered cadesh
[1:12:49] righteous using the term from Pagan
[1:12:51] practice to describe her motive
[1:12:55] we're taught to check our motive and our
[1:12:57] objective before taking
[1:12:59] action judah's motive and objective were
[1:13:02] clearly immoral and sinful but to Mars
[1:13:05] and seeking an heir for her own security
[1:13:07] and in compliance with the law and
[1:13:09] culture of the times were holy
[1:13:14] righteous it's a little hard for us to
[1:13:17] comprehend in this day and
[1:13:19] time and hyra returned to Judah and said
[1:13:22] I cannot find her and also the men of
[1:13:24] the place said that there was no sacred
[1:13:26] harlot in this
[1:13:28] place and Judah said let her take it to
[1:13:32] her in other words let her keep the
[1:13:34] things given her in pledge lest we be
[1:13:37] shamed Judah wants to keep up
[1:13:39] appearances behold I sent this kid
[1:13:42] through you so I could save face and
[1:13:45] thou Hast not find her I I did my
[1:13:48] part well it came to pass about 3 months
[1:13:51] after that it was told Judah saying
[1:13:53] tomorrow thy daughter-in hath played the
[1:13:55] Harlot and also behold she's with child
[1:13:57] by whoredom Judah said bring her
[1:14:01] forth let her be
[1:14:05] burnt again playing to
[1:14:09] appearances this now gathered crowd I'm
[1:14:12] the righteous judge she is
[1:14:16] guilty centuries later judah's
[1:14:19] descendant David would demand death to a
[1:14:21] rich man that stole the only precious
[1:14:22] thing a poor man had and the prophet
[1:14:25] Nathan would point to David and say thou
[1:14:26] art The
[1:14:27] Man 2 Samuel 12 we're
[1:14:32] often I'm including me and the we ready
[1:14:35] and quick to condemn others for the very
[1:14:38] actions of which we ourselves are guilty
[1:14:42] the reference here to David is also a
[1:14:44] text brother Daniel used last week in
[1:14:45] his teaching on
[1:14:47] repentance how appropriate for
[1:14:49] tonight and this portion of Genesis
[1:14:54] watch when she when Tomar was brought
[1:14:57] forth into the Town Square sent to her
[1:15:01] father-in-law she is taking a big risk
[1:15:05] here surrendering the evidence of her
[1:15:09] innocence of her righteousness if you
[1:15:11] will to the one who is demanding her
[1:15:14] wanly cruel
[1:15:16] death
[1:15:17] saying by the man whose th are am I with
[1:15:22] child and she said discern I pray thee
[1:15:26] who are these the the the Signet the
[1:15:29] bracelets the
[1:15:34] staff and Judah acknowledged them that
[1:15:37] they were his and said
[1:15:39] she
[1:15:41] careful it doesn't say he said to
[1:15:44] himself or thought well she he used the
[1:15:47] third person she not the second person
[1:15:50] you he's not speaking to Tamar at this
[1:15:53] point no judah's addressing the crowd
[1:15:57] which had gathered to see a young woman
[1:16:00] burn Judah had just realized he was
[1:16:03] about to not only murder his
[1:16:05] daughter-in-law whom he had betrayed but
[1:16:08] kill his unborn child as well for
[1:16:10] something he himself had
[1:16:12] done he's had a reckoning a realization
[1:16:16] of what he was and had become and no
[1:16:20] longer wanted to be that person a
[1:16:21] process of transformation had begun
[1:16:23] which we'll see comfort fruition in
[1:16:25] chapter 44 Judah said to the gathered
[1:16:28] crowd she hath been more righteous than
[1:16:31] I because that I gave her not Shaya to
[1:16:35] my
[1:16:36] son he's making a public confession 1
[1:16:40] John 1:9 we read if we confess our sins
[1:16:43] he's faithful and just to forgive us our
[1:16:45] sins and to cleanse us from all
[1:16:50] unrighteousness and he Judah knew her
[1:16:54] again no more Judah had just had a
[1:16:57] turning point he's acting on it
[1:17:01] repentance change in heart change in
[1:17:06] Direction it came to pass at the time of
[1:17:08] her labor that behold Twins were in her
[1:17:10] woman came to pass when she travailed
[1:17:12] that one put out his hand the Midwife
[1:17:14] took and bound upon his hand a Scarlet
[1:17:16] thread saying this came out first should
[1:17:19] have been the first born right and came
[1:17:21] to pass he drew back his hand that
[1:17:23] behold his brother came came out and she
[1:17:25] said how hast thou broken forth this
[1:17:28] breach be upon thee therefore his name
[1:17:30] was called perz which means breach
[1:17:33] afterward came out his brother that had
[1:17:34] the Scarlet thread upon his hand his
[1:17:37] name was called Zara when I think of
[1:17:39] this I think sometimes we raise our hand
[1:17:41] to the Lord but then we
[1:17:45] withdraw we have to follow through we
[1:17:49] have to follow through Judah returned to
[1:17:51] Hebron with Tamar and his three sons
[1:17:54] Sons Shaya FZ and
[1:18:02] Zarah his two decades of dulum running
[1:18:05] from his family his responsibilities
[1:18:08] while embracing his sinful life and
[1:18:10] culture brought out the worst in him and
[1:18:13] then in a critical moment the Lord used
[1:18:18] that to make Judah see himself mirrored
[1:18:22] in God's word like us today
[1:18:25] realize his sinful State confess his sin
[1:18:28] and repent turn around he wasn't
[1:18:31] instantly transformed but the journey
[1:18:33] had
[1:18:34] begun much like us just like me a broken
[1:18:38] human a work in progress but a work in
[1:18:43] progress Judah is a changed man now he's
[1:18:48] ready for his role with
[1:18:50] Joseph back to our story let's let's
[1:18:53] pick up at the end of judah's plea to
[1:18:56] send Benjamin with him to Egypt for
[1:18:58] their second trip to buy
[1:19:01] Grain he says to Jacob I will be shity
[1:19:04] for him of my hand shalt thou require
[1:19:07] him if I bring him not unto thee and set
[1:19:10] him before thee let me bear the blame
[1:19:12] forever for except we had lingered
[1:19:14] surely now we had returned this second
[1:19:19] time and their father Israel having seen
[1:19:23] them return
[1:19:25] observed the transformation of Judah
[1:19:28] relented and said unto them if it must
[1:19:32] be so now do this uh take of the best
[1:19:36] fruits of the land in your vessels carry
[1:19:38] down to the the man a present a little
[1:19:43] bomb little honey spices and myrr nuts
[1:19:47] and
[1:19:48] almonds bomb spices myrrh traveling to
[1:19:52] Egypt with the same smells that Joseph
[1:19:55] endured 23 years earlier in his journey
[1:19:58] into
[1:20:01] slavery and take double money in your
[1:20:04] hand and the money that was brought
[1:20:06] again in the mouth of your sacks carried
[1:20:08] again in your hand perhaps it was an
[1:20:13] oversight but take also your brother
[1:20:16] Benjamin and
[1:20:18] arise go again unto the man and God
[1:20:21] Almighty give you Mercy before the man
[1:20:23] this zaap and pan that he may send away
[1:20:26] your other brother Simeon and Benjamin
[1:20:31] if I be bevd of my children I'm
[1:20:36] bered and the men took that present and
[1:20:39] took double money in their hand and they
[1:20:41] took Benjamin and Rose up and went down
[1:20:45] to
[1:20:46] Egypt that trip will take them a week or
[1:20:49] so we'll let them travel wondering what
[1:20:52] fate May await them at the hand of Z
[1:20:54] andna pan when they arrive what a
[1:20:57] surprise awaits Joseph another shock the
[1:21:01] impact of sharing of the testimony of
[1:21:04] the repentant the confirmation of his
[1:21:07] surmising about Jacob we'll meet with
[1:21:10] them again when they arrive next
[1:21:13] Wednesday the musicians would please
[1:21:17] return it's so easy for us to see in our
[1:21:21] lives and the circumstances in which we
[1:21:23] find ourselves and lacking the larger
[1:21:26] picture to misunderstand others even
[1:21:29] those closest to us Joseph had lumped
[1:21:32] Ruben in with his brothers when they
[1:21:34] sold him to the ishmaelites yet Reuben
[1:21:36] was actually doing all he could to save
[1:21:38] Joseph and return him to
[1:21:40] Jacob Jacob whom Joseph thought had
[1:21:43] forsaken him completely was deceived
[1:21:46] about Joseph's condition and convinced
[1:21:48] he was killed by wild beasts he saw it
[1:21:50] on
[1:21:52] Instagram far from forgotten Jacob was
[1:21:56] in mourning and grieving for his
[1:21:59] favorite son Jacob had no idea what it
[1:22:02] actually happened to Joseph and Joseph
[1:22:05] had no idea what his father had been
[1:22:09] told but he imagined what he then
[1:22:12] thought must be the case and he filtered
[1:22:15] the statement from his brothers that his
[1:22:17] father was alive through that imagined
[1:22:19] truth a truth that was no Truth at all
[1:22:23] and felt at that moment even more
[1:22:25] isolated and
[1:22:28] rejected in spite of the additional pain
[1:22:30] his limited perspective brought him and
[1:22:32] even using it Joseph was being trained
[1:22:35] by God for his role in the first
[1:22:38] installment of God's promise to Abraham
[1:22:40] back in Genesis 12 I will bless them
[1:22:42] that bless thee curse them that curseth
[1:22:44] thee and in thee shall all families of
[1:22:48] the earth be blessed we know the
[1:22:50] ultimate fulfillment of that prise is
[1:22:52] fulfilled in Jesus through the line not
[1:22:56] of
[1:22:57] Joseph but of Judah and
[1:23:00] Tamar he came to the lost the sick the
[1:23:05] outcasts Jesus did the despised the weak
[1:23:09] the poor the Hopeless the
[1:23:12] helpless he came to
[1:23:15] me let's close this portion of the
[1:23:18] service and
[1:23:19] worship and sing remind me it's all
[1:23:23] about him his love and mercy and
[1:23:27] abundant
[1:23:30] grace the things that I love and hold
[1:23:36] dear to my
[1:23:38] heart are just
[1:23:41] borrow they're not mine at
[1:23:48] all Jesus only lets me use them to
[1:23:54] Bright
[1:23:56] my life so remind me remind me dear
[1:24:06] Lord roll back the
[1:24:10] curtain of meory now and
