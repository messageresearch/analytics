maybe those that had had gone through a war before and but for a lot of us this is probably one of the most disturbing times a lot of questions a lot of wondering but you're still gone you haven't changed everything that takes place everything that happens you're watching over it you're bringing things to pass lord for your word will not return void but it'll do everything it has said lord so father we come this morning with that assurance in our hearts that you're still god you change not lord that's what our hope is built that's where we stand today asking you lord just have your way this morning bless each heart minister to each one maybe questions that some have and maybe there's some that are not feeling well or going through a hard time in life lord that you would come and minister to each one as you are more capable to do than we could even imagine [Music] but we know you to be the same yesterday today and forever we're standing on that in jesus christ's name just one that peace of god cover me peace of god cover me cover me cover me oh peace of god cover me through the storm through the troubling of the mind sometimes [Music] only in you i find peace so cover me [Music] cover me cover me when i am hurting cover me when i'm not strong cover me when i am going through the storm cover me when all seems hopeless cover me when my faith is gone let the peace that passes all i understand cover me cover me [Music] thank you thank you for singing that song of peace brother man sometimes when you're in the back there you're just saying lord which and then something takes place and says it's okay so while you're standing let's read john 14 27 to open with a scripture here jesus is speaking he says peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid amen you may be seated i like that my peace i give unto you perfect peace holy peace complete no strings attached nothing he just gives you of himself i just appreciate that the word peace freedom from all disquieting or oppression oppressive thoughts or emotions i have been in perfect peace and contentment in the presence of god if you can let him have his way if you can just yield of yourself and say lord you come you can say i have been in perfect peace and contentment because the rest of the time you'll be having a good time you've been enjoying it and then something happens and it breaks it but if you get into the presence of god and just stay there what a wonderful thing so before i forget let me just make this announcement this evening our brother jesse wilson will be with us speaking tonight brother jesse wilson's married sister hadassah and we've heard the testimony just recently of our sister's healing brother jesse wilson is brother green's grandson and oh it's been quite some time now i had talked to him probably over a year ago maybe even two years ago about sharing his testimony with us or something so he said well i'll think about it and he spoke with his pastor brother cadem and brother caleb says you're just starting why don't you just get a little more experience just mannerisms behind the pulpit and things which i thought was pretty good good advice so when they came friday for that potluck after sister hadas had come and we got to see her the the healing the effect of the healing on her face and her emotions all was just marvelous too i had seen her before that i didn't know what was going on and i said there's something wrong with her she's just not herself but the joy that was in her face and brother jesse came up to the side and said brother aaron he goes i think i'm ready and i said well i've been waiting for this day for a while so lord willing brother jesse will be with us tonight he said you want me to preach you want me to give my testimony i said i'd like to hear a little bit of your testimony but if god gives you something to minister just minister it and he says well he goes i never take long i'm never longer than 35 minutes so i won't hold it hold him to that if he wants to take an hour that's perfectly fine so lord willing he'll be with us this evening i'm looking forward to it i believe it'll be a blessing to see what god can do with a young man and just just make it real to him so as as a meltdown to pray before service after the service starts close the door and just kind of close yourself in for a little bit and i uh i just was talking and i heard brother lyle minister about or pray about europe what's going on in europe there and and in the countries back there and it seems so far away from us you know while that's on the other side of the world but there are brothers and sisters out there there there are people they have feelings they have hurts they have families there's so much going on but at the same time you look in the scriptures and it must be it's it's god said this we can look we've had we've been able to look into the scripture and say these times are coming these times are here i still every time i i think of that thought that brother branham said and i have the quote there and i read it every so often it was the tender hand of jehovah that caused what happened in germany to our jewish brethren and if that's tenderness i don't want it in the natural that's not what i consider tenderness and and the sweetness of god but it was because it caused them to turn and go back to israel they wouldn't have gone otherwise they were well to do they had everything they wanted they had everything why should they go back because the scripture said they all shall come from the north the south the east and the west and they shall return and god says i'll bring it to pass so when you look into the scriptures and you begin to read you'll be ready to see what is happening on earth today must come to pass must be now if it was up to us we would do it a little differently uh you know if we have if we have a a good christian attitude you know we try to be as gentle as we can we try to be as soft as we can you know sometimes you look back maybe as a parent and you look at and and i have the opportunity to because having six children how you treated the first one compared to how you treated the last one i always laugh when i think about when naomi was born and we took her to the hospital when she was about three months old because she wasn't breathing and and when i looked at her she was breathing but mama you know so we went to the hospital and they checked naomi over really well she was fine doctor said now i'll go work on mama and she said because that's about normal it's a but when rachel was born and something was wrong with rachel we'd say naomi go see what's wrong with rachel we didn't stir all that much and if we're not careful we kind of get used to things we kind of get but we should have that same urgency that same desire that same push that if it's the first time or the last time it's still god is this what you want god is jewish am i following your will am i am i in your in what you want us to do because sometimes we say oh lord no no don't don't be so harsh don't be so mean don't it's not that it's the tender hand of jehovah sometimes hard to understand but when you take a scripture that peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth and thinking about what's going on over there and you read the news and you know that the news is slanted in certain directions and you know you kind of have to look all around to get a general a better picture if you just listen to one thing you're going to hear it one way if you hear just this it's going to be this way and then sometimes if you get to talk to somebody who's very involved they'll give you a complete different view and and sometimes i know brother greene said he used to read all the different uh magazines from other parts of the world because it would give a complete different view of what we were working but to hear some of the things that are going on and in today's world as i was thinking about as i was praying i just felt the lord brought it to my memory world war ii which i was fascinated by when as a young man i would read the books and um and just just it was something that was interested me and when japan attacked the united states there in hawaii and all that happened there how we we really were forced to get into the war then and i had monk my cousin robert chacon's father my uncle vicente was in world war ii and was in on a schedule and rotation if we would have landed in japan he would have been part of that group and the war ended before that but he shared a few things that they saw and what they heard uncle robert my mom's brother was in the korean war and i worked with him at davis kitchens in fact he's the one that got me into work there and he shared things that he saw war is ugly war is mean wars whereas and generally war in in the human it is because somebody wants power over somebody else somebody wants more of this but god allows these things to happen to bring his will to pass so just thinking about some of that and and thinking how we went and we began to take island after island to cut off the ability for japan to make war but today is different we're not taking island after island we're cutting off the finances we're cutting off the influence we're cutting off the ability to get the news out it's a whole different approach to war today's war is fought here and it affects here nations are breaking israel's awakening the signs that the prophets foretold so is all this that's happening today but now so there's a talk of a possibility of a great nuclear war and i saw an article that said how many people in 45 minutes would be dead it would be they said in 45 minutes to be at least 8 million people lose their lives but it's far away from us it's on the other side of the world but no it's not far away from us it hits home so as i was looking at this and we had talked last last time we spoke we were ministering on rest finding rest and and the way i started it was look at some of the folks like the three hebrew children they found rest when the prince of peace visited with them in that but it sure didn't look restful while they're getting there when when joshua tells him we're about to cross into this land it's going to be that land of milk and honey and it is and he tells them he said but you keep serving those other gods you haven't let them go as for me and my house we will serve the lord and sometimes you say how can you how could you serve a god that requires everything of you it's quite simple when you remember that he gave his all for you and you would do it back so kind of picking up on that same thought again rest but tying it in with peace because without peace there is no rest with the way you know supply and demand is right now it's it's tough it's hard it was with the homeowner on thursday and they've been waiting for a year and a half for us to be able to get into the house and look at the damage that now we have to order the parts for so it'll be another three to five months before the parts come in and i've got this thing that i say you can have it in four months or you can have it in 16 weeks and they stop and i go which one sounds better most of them say 16 weeks just sounds better it's the same amount of time just has a better sound but he worked with transformers he goes i understand he said most of the transformers we're working with right now are two years out and they're still building houses as fast as they can put them down and steal some so i went in to take care of my home that was getting ready to turn into the give over to the the new owners and i go in and and there's still putting the power in they're still putting the water in and i called the superintendent he goes oh no that house closed already they just won't take possession of it until we get water and power in there maybe another month but for the company that the building company close the house we get the money it's a whole different mentality today but i'm thinking of the one who said i will go down and i will do this myself i will bear their burden i will take the hurts i will take the sorrow i will do it but today's world let somebody else deal with it let somebody else have to do with it and so when i opened the scriptures and it was fell on john 14 27 my peace i give unto you not as the world gives you and then philippians 4 7 and here's here's the one the other one that just hit me and the peace of god which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus explain to me sometimes how somebody could have peace today and be at rest without god you have to entertain yourself you have to find something that keeps all those other thoughts away whether that entertainment comes through a drug through a bottle through sports to whatever it might be let me not pay attention to what's going over there but let let something else keep my attention but he says and the peace of god which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus and here is and the peace of god the calm heavenly repose that tranquility of spirit tranquil free from agitation of mind or spirit free from disturbance or turmoil god said it therefore i believe it and i rest on it and sometimes rest his heart i'm going to share a little testimony because god is the same yesterday today and forever you know he said to his disciples when he's when he's with him he says i don't even have a place to lay down and when he's going on the ship across the sea after he told him we'll meet on the other side brother billy paul shares his testimony where he would have trouble when there was a little place he'd have to jump over and then he said brother brown would say come on billy he knew brother brandon had seen him on the other side already now you would think the disciples had known enough with being around jesus that if he said it let's just go do it but no they happen to be human they happen to be like us at times you know i know you were with me just a little bit ago because that was you lord but where are you now and and to think here he is they're going he's already told them he said we're going across let's go on to the other side he's tired he's weary he lays down and he goes to sleep because he's not worried about it it's easy to sleep when you're not worried when you're trusting when there's peace because you don't struggle but if you lay down with something anxious in your mind in your heart it's hard to find sleep it's just constant it's constantly going and he gets up when they wake him up these very ones who had seen him feed 5000 who had seen him do this who this and he stands on the bow of the ship and he says peace be still and they're marveled again but i don't care how many times god visits it's the same effect how wonderful how marvelous how great i just don't understand i don't even know why sometimes i've done nothing to deserve it but he does it anyways it pleases god to bless his children amen so here he gets up and he calms the sea and then he looks at me he said oh ye of little faith have not have not i showed you over and over that that i'm the master of this i've given you power just not too long ago you were casting out demons what's the difference but we're human we forget something else comes our way and we lord where are you but he's the same so this would have been early friday morning not been able to sleep dozing and just things going on things with work things with the church everything and my wife was asleep and it used to be the other way i would wake up quickly now or i would sleep through it and she wouldn't wake up and now it's the other way i wake up and she doesn't wake up and i just said i i i should wake her up and have her pray for me because sometimes you have trouble praying for yourself it's just like lord i don't even know what to say i don't know what to ask and right about then she rolled over and she put her arm on me okay i said are you awake and she said yes i said would you pray for me just lays their hands over in just a 30 second prayer lord give my husband peace give him wrestling within a couple of minutes asleep but here's the amazing part i get a um a text from uh or a call from my brother and i couldn't answer it i called him back and he said i'll call you back in a minute so we made contact and he said early this morning you came on my heart he said and i was going to text you then and i looked and i said it's way too early they're not awake yet so i said about what time was this he said between 3 and 3 30 in the morning he lives on the other side of the country so it was about 5 5 30 their time and he said you just came on real strong and so did the tabernacle and i was praying for you so why should we weary why should we be afraid why should we be so nervous when god has got it in control but it won't take but a few times again and you'll be back in the same place lord where are you lord i need your help but that's okay he said call unto me and i will again if you don't go through any problems you'll never know what kind of god he is he's the god of my mother he's the god of my father he's a god of my grandpa he's a god of this ad or the other but no now i know him to be my god he's careful with me and i'll show again and the peace of god that calm heavenly repose that tranquility of spirit which god only can give as much as i want to help you and you want to help me we can be touched to a certain part of that infirmity but god can be touched to every one of your feelings of infirmity of your thoughts of your he's aware of that all that he says which none can comprehend save he that receiveth it when god gives it to you and the peace comes over only you at that point can understand how god could do this he says it shall keep shall guard as a garrison does a city your hearts your affections your minds your understandings and all the various workings of them i still think quite often when that my case manager when he had the the surgery my my foot and all when she said your body has about 6 000 operations continually that you're not even aware of happening until they go wrong then suddenly you know something's going on all the various workings through the spirit and the power of christ jesus in the knowledge and love of god he understands it all he knows it all and he loves you on top of that you know we're going on 43 years married and i love my wife but every once in a while it gets put to the test and i just and more than every once in a while she gets put to the test from my side i'd say i say i get the better end of the deal but it is there are times things happen things just you know and yeah you lose your cool you you do something you get mad you get upset and you have to stop for a few minutes and and get a hold of yourself and say hey that was wrong and as quick as you can't go make it right because the further along it goes remember the pillow with the feathers it's hard to get it all back he says but he says through the spirit and power of christ jesus in the knowledge and love of god and then he says without a guard set on these likewise the purity and the vigor of our affections cannot long be preserved that was john wesley he was eloquent with his words you know in in that was also under the spirit of man being able to speak the words to get to the people but it cannot long be preserved going down the highway and you're listening to a song you're singing a song and somebody cuts you off and it cannot long be preserved all sudden oh lord help me and somebody is doing this speed limit and you're not why don't they just get into the slow lane then they're obeying the law you're not lord help us all sometimes you go racing down there to get to where you're at and you go wow i was supposed to be here an hour later i'm an hour early because i missed time the work and start figuring out who to blame it on ecclesiastes 3 14. here's something that the a man solomon who asked god for wisdom to rule over god's people god said you can have riches you can have this you can have everything he goes he says give me wisdom to rule your people so great a people and he says i know that whatsoever god do with it it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and god do with it that men should fear before him that we would have respect unto him and understand that he's in control not a fear of being afraid but a respect and a reverence of a god who has everything under control if he says so it is so if he says no then it's no there's no ah maybe you're dead robert mongol i work with him uncle theo you want me to do this way ah the chicon side of the family um yeah maybe um that's five minutes of that until i cut through the power cord then he reacted quickly i worked with my uncle i respected i loved my uncle very much but that was his nature we would go to bid a job and it was a lot of work he did yard maintenance cleanups and stuff and they would say how much and he'd be looking and i'd be thinking well he's got to charge at least 300 for this and he would say we can do it for 50. and i would say i'll get five dollars out of it you know do the work it's just who he was that's the way monko was but you know we serve a god who knows the end from the beginning and the beginning from the end because he's eternal there's no fear in him there's no wavering in him there's no i got to go back to the lab to see and retest this it worked perfect the first time and will continue to be perfect he's unfailing and we need to trust him that way so here's solomon realize that when god does it god does it right you don't you that men should fear in other words you'd have that respect and irreverence to god that lord you're in control you're in charge and it will be okay i half don't have to worry about it let's read a couple of of the the quotes here that i found just sometimes you just do a word search to see what what did braham say about that or you get in the dictionary you say what is the actual definition or maybe you hear another brother ministering and he and his and he shares a question and god allows you to hear and it just becomes real to you from proof of his resurrection you're proof of his resurrection you're living proof of a resurrected living christ the emancipation of the proclamation has been signed you're free and you just don't know it but faith must have a divine resting place before if you have faith in god you've got to have some divine resting place to place it and there's no better place no other divine way only through god's holy word and we want to let our faith rest directly upon the written word of god it never changes it never has to be rewritten it never has to have a theological explanation because it just comes to pass does it work turn the key engine turned on yes it does take god at his word the uncertain sound the next one there says oh the blessedness of believing thank god that he has given us the ability to believe and take him at his word the blessing of not trying to figure it out oh that's the hard part i want it to make sense to this guy right here i want 2 plus 2 to always equal 2. but in today's math i'm not too sure what is it called common core i don't i had enough trouble with basic math don't make it any more confusing you know the blessing of just resting on god's word and say it's true and go on it's life it's life it's real living the blessing of taking god as word and just believing it law or grace therefore jesus didn't make a mistake when he said be there for perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect and how could a human be be perfect he could be perfect by his perfect faith resting in him saying he paid the price for me what is your faith resting on today this revelation that great minister this explanation or the fact that god did it all for you already because a man today could preach it exactly how you feel it and tomorrow turn it because man has a tendency to do things like that i've got a better understanding today i've got a clearer understanding today i read this brother branham said if the angel of the lord had not come into the room when he was going to preach the seals he would have preached them wrong but god rich in mercy knowing that you and i would be here this day made sure the angel of the lord was in that room with him so that it was preached correctly if we're not careful we put way too much in brother adam but he depended on the god the same god that you and i have to depend on it was god allowing somebody to be shown that if you could surrender and give yourself completely over to him he could do the same with you and it doesn't make a difference of your age he said suffer not the little children that come unto me sometimes our grandchildren tells us things that are amazing and they do it in an innocent heart just because they love dad papa can do no wrong daddy can do no wrong mama can do no wrong oh that they would never get to be teenagers then we realized wow daddy and mama are just as human as i am and they've got their issues and they've got their problems too but if you remind them they love you they have their your best interest in their heart and their mind and heart the same as god did he said he could be perfect by his perfect faith resting in him saying he paid the price what a mighty god we serve what a mighty god that loves us this world is not my home i'm just passing through but there are no shortcuts to the passing through while you're on this earth there's something for you to do while you're on this earth there's a life to live there's a glory and an honor that should be given to god there's someone who may on the other side said because you were there that day i'm here today yes and it will be worth it all even if it's just one for that one as brother dan said the other for that starfish it made all the difference for that one oh the joy that will be for to be there in somebody because because of your life you lived because of the cold cup of water because of that little fish or that little loaf of bread you shared with me i'm here today it'll be worth it all right isaiah 32 17 and 18. when you get down and it gets hard and that happens often unless you're dead but if you have life in you you have your up and down every day there are struggles you get up in the morning and as you get a little bit on this side of the age level and parts that shouldn't be hurting or hurting for no reason at all it seems like sometimes didn't do anything to make it hurt i didn't go jogging i didn't jump off of anything i didn't pick up nothing heavy but it hurts anyways when you realize that you're alive because he cares for you and the work of righteousness shall be peace and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance forever and my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation ensure dwellings and in quiet resting places most of us do not go to a busy busy shop with all the motors running everybody working hard and lay our caught down say a perfect place to rest no we're leaving that place to go try to find somewhere to some quiet some shade something get out of all the noise get off all all of the distractions a quiet place but god's word says man my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation and an assure and insured dwellings and in a quiet resting place where there's no turmoil the mind is not going here and there the heart is not pumping twice as much as it should be because there's rest now you ask me how can you be rest when this happens because there's a god of peace living in you not because you're able to manufacture man has tried to manufacture peace many different ways and it has never worked never to the place where they thought they could achieve right now there's a there are those up in the space station and and gotten away from this atmosphere to that atmosphere working in space station and now there's a possibility they'll not be able to come back because man is fighting with men because somebody wants more than the other has because the greed takes place when god said i have everything i own the cattle on a thousand hills every vein of gold every deposit of silver every ounce of oil whatever it is is mine i created it but i'll give it all up for you he left the splendor of heaven knowing his destiny was a lonely hill on golgotha to give his life for you and me and you and i are looking at our bank account and i got to hold on to that i got to hold on to that i got to hold on to that and i'm not telling you to be foolish about it i'm just telling you what you're what's the motive behind your heart there is no peace in all of that i've never heard of a somebody be getting a million dollars and that's it i don't need any more their next thought is how can i make that 1 2 and how can i make that 2 4 and how can i make that 4 8. it's natural but this same god who created the heavens and the earth and said it is good and he rested yet knowing what was going to take place he had read the whole book from beginning to the end he knew of it i i always remember brother neal johnson i've read the back of the book and we went but there's still a battle to go through vic victorious means you fought the battle you know and here's the other thing and right now you know the basketball's going and everybody to kind of get away from everything else is following their basketball team and when the basketball team wins you hear we won we won when the basketball team loses you here they lost they lost the association changes quickly but when he looked down from the splendors of heaven said i'll go i'll go he knew what he was getting into so much that he cried out father if it be possible can this pass from me as a human having this same flesh without sin i understand but he had to be a kinsmen redeemer he had to go through the pain the anxiety the nervousness the worry and he calls out to his father says there a way to get around this without me having to go through this but not my will thy will be done because you and i were on his mind in a quiet resting place sometimes it's can you go sleep somewhere else because while you're sleeping it's not quiet um asher and chloe spent the night for the first time they have sleepover i know it's been a while back and of course grandma nanny had to be there with them and i slept in the room and she slept in the living room and they were on the things and chloe wakes up grandma and she says you're making too much noise and then when mama was in look up chloe had her arm over asher's ears protecting him little brother so they spent last night with us or the night before friday night and so my wife says is it okay if nani sleeps in here it'll be okay i can take the noise she says children just honest straight up i think that god would put up with us as good and as perfect sometimes we think we are he must have a good laugh every once in a while my children have you seen my children watch them look at them but he said have you considered my servant job that's what he thinks of us he would dare put you in satan's face and said have you seen my servant have you seen my daughter because he knows what's in you he knows you can stand and say though god slay me yet i'll trust him with these eyes i shall see my redeemer it's the same god in you now peter here ii peter 1 1-4 simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ remember simon peter when they're there and and and they're there at gethsemane and and and he's one of the ones that goes a little further up with jesus to pray with him along with a couple of his brothers and jesus comes back and finds him asleep and he tells him can't you can't you watch with me can't you pray with me can you stay awake for a little while and he goes to pray some more and he comes back and they're asleep again says three times the third time he says come on get up the time is here the same peter that said i will not deny you but if you read the rest scriptures and so did the others say that not just peter but here's peter he says i will never now i'll go to that cross and hang with you and jesus looks up and says peter you're going to deny me three times and then you're going to hear a rooster crow and you're going to realize what you did i'm sure going through peter's mind he's going no way impossible not me i'm peter i tried to take that man's head off with a sword and i know i missed and you fixed his ear but i tried it sounds like peter didn't it the peter before the day of pentecost a peter who in his his machoism is brave i can do this i can do this and god says you are going to deny me and i think often about it when peter hears that third crow and he realizes exactly what he told me i have done so i'm just going to go back to be a fisherman i'm just going to go back to do what i used to do i'm not i can't even call him my friend anymore and i'm sure he doesn't even care for me anymore i've denied him i turned my back on him i even cursed some of us have gotten to that place maybe not cursed but our thoughts i'm going lord why would you even put up with me why would you want me look what i've done look how i am look what i even thought and he says what what i don't see nothing i'm looking at you through the blood and that's where brother brahm says in that quote there's where that peace and the rest when you realize he took care of it all for you it's not in your ability to figure it out it's not your belly the depth of your revelation and how you can explain it to everybody but can you live it is that the testimony the live life i remember many of the brothers from years ago we've been around it with for some time now since 1975 this message and the testimony of many that would seem so strong and where are they now today you cannot stand on your own it takes the holy spirit in your life for you to stand peter says simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained the like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ peter goes i know that peter but listen to this peter now a peter who said hang me upside down i'm not worthy to die like him and he says an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained the like precious faith that's me is that you amen he's speaking to you then verse 2 grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord grace unmerited favor nothing you did to deserve it but god chose to do it and don't argue with him about it he said oh i wouldn't don't let your life argue about it say it's the grace of god that has me where i am today it's god's mercy that has reached out to me it's god that has turned me around nothing good i did it wasn't that the the 12 steps of self-preservation or this specific diet or this but no it was the grace of god that reached down he says and peace and i like this definition of peace the absence of war i'm not fighting it anymore i'm giving into it the grace and peace of god i'm resting in it i don't need to stay up all night working my salvation through here that's the hardest part to deal with it with there that short space right there well if i was really saved i'd never think that way if i was really saved i would never act like that if i oh man then you're saying that the blood of jesus christ is not strong enough to save you are you putting down the work of god why didn't you just accept it why don't you just be a piece of it saying lord i surrender all when you surrender you're willing to give up the fight you realize i can't do it anyways i know a young man who was a boxer and a fighter he still may be and every time i saw him i know who lost it wasn't the other guy it was him but he did it anyways i was at the point why didn't you why don't you find a less brutal hobby because you've taken the worst of it over and over and over and i know who took the worst of it he took it off for me he took it all for me he was disfigured he was beyond recognition he didn't even have the appearance of man while he hung there for you and for me quit fighting it give it all to him grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of the lord our lord jesus christ not just the understanding but when it settles it down in here and it becomes a revelation to you he paid a debt he did not owe and i owed a debt i could not pay right now if you needed three dollars i couldn't help you because i got two in my wallet if you need two i can help you if you need three i can get you have some help but he paid a debt i could not pay i had 22 dollars but she got 20 of it he had it all but he gave it to you he shared it all with you to be partakers of his righteousness of his power of his honor of his glory your mrs jesus christ now she took it to give it sister rachel to pay for the food so but you know what god meets all our needs but here he says through the knowledge of god not just knowing god but being a personal friend a personal relationship with him and of our lord jesus our lord verse 3. according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness if you're not looking at that there's you're saying there's just not godliness in life it's not because he hasn't given it it's because you haven't yielded that portion of your life to him you're still struggling with it you're still working with it and that's a daily a daily thing if there's breath there's a struggle but the more that i surrender the more that i can humble myself the more that i can say i give it all to you lord he says and given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue through the knowledge and it's not a mental understanding has to become a revelation in your life a revelation is active it's alive it produces something your scientists your great explorers your your men of renown one of them they put their thoughts and ideas into action it became a revelation to them it became to something where they saw it they began to see hey there is a way to get off of the horse and buggy and get on something that has a motor that's going to propel us forward and they begin to work on it the wright brothers saw them getting up off the ground and flying like maybe not exactly like a bird but flying in the air and they had to put it into action it wasn't just drawings anymore and theories it became something real when this is just not red letters in a bible but it's life in you when it becomes a revelation to you it becomes part of your life and then he says in verse 4 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises exceeding great great great uh i don't think this is great you know when i think of great i think great they're building a new amazon plant building over here on on uh aina and silverbell now and that building is big but i haven't been inside it yet and it looks big from the outside but wait till you walk into one of those buildings before you realize how big it is it looks really big and then you got to walk through it especially if you got to work there and you got to stalk it it's going to be the biggest building you've ever seen all of a sudden when you're the one that has to put all the parts in there but great he says great be beyond you can even imagine and precious promises not something you would just take lightly something pressure something you would you would look at and you would adore you would love such promises that by these you might be partakers part of the divine nature god in you the hope of glory that's what paul was preaching christ in you is the hope of glory not he said if if you want to compare credentials let's compare them paul says i match everything better than most of you i was born of this i had this teaching i learned this i knew it he said but i count it as nothing to obtain this christ in you the hope of glory that by these he might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped corruption that is in the world through lust and we know where that started way back in the beginning there was a divine nature there was a divine nature that created the garden of eden and all the world that was god and he spoke into existence his son had nothing to do with lust and then i don't we don't know the amount of time that adam was given to go through all what he knew there and look at every animal look at everything was there because god had was going to provide for him help me somebody that was going to be part of him because you were part of god in the first place and god wanted to express that and and and here he takes eve out of the side of of adam and when adam sees there he goes this is what i've been looking for i walked through this land back and forth and up and down and i named those animals and i called this tree that and i did this and i don't know how much it took a million years five weeks really doesn't make a difference it took some time and adam goes but none of these is filling that spot and god in eternity there was something in him wanting to be a savior wanting to be a healer wanting to have friendship wanting to have a personal relationship with someone and he said i know how i'm going to do this and he says now having escaped the corruption it is in the world through lust he allowed it to happen saint thought he had pulled one on god and god said oh no you're just part of the plan the same one that went up and god said to him have you considered my servant job and he goes well yeah i watch i've been watching him closely in fact i go by every day to see if there's a way to get in but you got him hedged in you got him well protected there's a covering over him and i can't get in there but he says and god had never heard this before i'm sure no he knew exactly why satan was there and he knew job was up to the task he has you here for a reason he's not surprised he chose you for this time and he said i know they're up for it i know they will pass the test although sometimes you're wondering if you're passing the test you're going can i study it a little bit more can i work on it a little bit more but god has already seen you on the other side you were part of him and he says so i will cause this to happen therefore i can express myself back to them a god of love a god of mercy a god of healing but not just that but to get to know him personally brother lyle when you first saw sister heather and you don't have to tell us all of it but did you know she was going to be the one not that moment but a couple moments later maybe but there was a time when you realized that's the one i remember the first time i saw my wife that i looked at her i thought she was gonna drown she was walking with her head up like this walking down the aisle everybody asked me how i what i first remember she was coming on that side i was coming down this side of the spanish church and i looked over and i said who's that young lady over there oh you don't think things like that church i forgot but she walked in a way where she kind of held her head up a little bit and i said if it rains right now that girl's gonna drown but i fell in love with her anyways and she probably got the worst end of the deal and i got the best end of the deal i'm sure but you know god saw you already he knew you were and he said for them i will go and do this and he says are given to us great unto us exceeding in great precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature have an escape corruption that is in the world through lust a couple more quotes here redemption by power hallelujah to the lamb i'm so glad that i've been filled with the holy spirit tonight while we are sleeping rejoicing resting in the promise of god god promised them to make a way of escape and while we're resting on this promise god was down there before them opening up away every man and woman tonight that will accept jesus christ on those grounds the holy spirit while you're asleep while you're resting on his promise he's talking here where while they were resting they had just come out of egypt with a mighty hand they'd been delivered that's all there's to it it was a mighty hand of god that delivered them not only to take them out but they took their wealth egyptians freely gave it to them i don't know how often that happens but it's not often well brother lyle you know uh well they would have probably called you brother lyle but they would have said lyle you're leaving this company and we were so happy with you we are going to give you all the money this company has so you can leave peacefully that didn't happen did it has that ever happened to anybody unless you owned the company maybe but no most of the time you just go on we've got somebody already in your place waiting for you take your place but here god allowed the egyptians to give them all that they needed but now they get to the red sea and the very god who had performed all these miracles now they're standing and saying what god just simply said to moses why could i speak and here brother branham says while they are sleeping and resting and that's what you're supposed to do when you sleep you're supposed to rest that's the purpose of sleep is to get some rest he said god is working on the backside taking care of everything he says god was down there before them opening up a way every man and woman tonight that will accept jesus christ on those grounds the holy spirit while you're asleep while you're resting in his promise maybe you're a maybe you're blind maybe you can't hear maybe you can't see maybe you're sick heart trouble cancer or something dying accept the light tonight and rest upon it and the wind coming like a mighty russian wind on the day of pentecost will move down through there and open up a way for you just like the pillar of fire did then hallelujah and you'll pass right through that valley of sickness right into the land of health again you'll pass through the land of cold formal shackled down in different religions to a holy ghost filled happy rejoicing heart full of joy god said so that settles it but you know it's interesting and that's hard for us to do israel in the church this is what i want to finish on here's paul paul has his it what we know of paul's history anyways what's written in the scriptures but if paul had this credentials that he says if you want to share uh uh compare credentials look at mine obviously he did a lot of stunning a lot of time in the temple a lot of work to get to that place it just wasn't an inheritance dad couldn't pass it down on a piece of paper it's something paul had to go through to get to that state to know the word of god to know what this was and to tie that in that took a lot of time a lot of studying a lot of work paul did not have the the he did not pick who what line he would born god allowed that to be but paul says here and it's satan talking old paul they was building a chopping block out there i mean i'm saying this but he goes he'll go to where satan's speaking they was building the chopping block out there and said and satan he says you know what that is boy i'm going to chop your head off is it i fought a good fight i finish of course i've kept the faith hey you're what are you going to say before you die death said oh you little hook knows jew oh you was beat with stripes let you down and so forth they done this or the other but now i've got you he looked over death said i'll make you shiver and shake he said death where is your sting the grave out there in the mud that roman soldier throwed up some mud to pile him down in there and i'll hold you said o death where is your string grave where is your victory but thanks be to god the grave says i'll hold you all mold you all canker you the worms will eat you up your bones will turn back to dust but paul said look at that empty tomb out there i'm in him he says hallelujah i'll rise again on the morning and receive a crown that the lord the righteous judge will give me not only them but every one of them then he says even in the branham tabernacle even in tucson tabernacle that love his appearing amen sure peace of god cover me come on let me let go of everything else i find myself on sunday worrying about monday's work quite often and you know what that does it robs the joy out of sunday and jobs robs the the joy or the peace out of sunday the rest it's not going to get go away and it's not going to get in there any sooner till monday morning but if i don't leave it alone here it's going to be with me the whole time i'm going to go to work today and i'm going to be anxious and that's your thought on sunday tomorrow morning i got to get up early why he says no no it says look at his shares that he says tomorrow's got its own troubles but let the peace of god let the rest of god let the mercy of god reign in your as hard as it is
