Peter if the piano would continue to play as I read [Music] second Peter chapter one verse 12. [Music] it reads like this wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth yeah I think it meet as long as I am in this Tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance knowing that shortly I must put off this my Tabernacle even as our Lord Jesus Christ has showed me may the Lord add the blessings to the reading of his word you can be seated it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning it's good to see everyone out I am it's been it's been a good week appreciated brother Jonathan's message on Wednesday I was I was as I said I was a bit taken back because he used many of the same scriptures that I'm going to be using this morning he wouldn't he used them in a different way that I'm going to be using them but it gave me confidence to know that we're in the same page We're In The Same Spirit we're moving we're moving in the same direction um we've got there's quite a few birthdays today well this week how many March birthdays are there raise your hands God bless you all sister Rachel Peterson I don't see her anymore I want to embarrass her there she is it's just I want to embarrass you but happy birthday to you too today today is my boy's birthday um he's 21. yeah he's coming in I remember that 21 is a special birthday to me because that's the day on my 21st birthday when I gave my heart to the Lord it was it was late at night I'd gotten home um and I said Lord I don't want this anymore I don't want to be a sinner anymore I want to serve you and from that day I I did my best to hold hold firm to to that commitment to the Lord and and it's held through to this day so the 21st is is special it it's it's a time of passage from from youth to adulthood I remember when I was about that age it's like I I gotta decide what I want to do I want to get married and have kids and a career and and make some very very uh difficult decisions at that age and they're decisions that are going to affect you for the rest of your life as time went on I remember on my 33rd birthday since we're talking about birthdays and my 33rd birthday I was we were living up in ore Valley Stephanie and I and the kids were babies and I got up early in the morning and I was praying and about to go to work and I asked the Lord I said I said Lord 33 years old I'm the same age as Jesus was when he died for all of humanity and as I was there praying I said I said Lord I'm 33 years old and I've never done anything for you and as I was praying the Lord I believe spoke to me and he told me he said move he said move to Jeffersonville Indiana and I I got up and I thought well Lord I don't know how that I'm going to do that but I'm going to do it and I don't want to get into the testimony take me too long but the Lord just paved the way for me to move back east and and thinking about that this morning and thinking about my son's birthday and all these birthdays that are going on and thinking about what the Lord did on that day I thought he spoke to me God in heaven look down at this meaningless human being just as every day guy looked down at me saw me on my knees and he answered my prayer I thought how unworthy that this God that's that's he's he's up in heaven and he's got millions of angels surrounding him and his Holiness that those angels that are so close to him that they have to cover their face and they have to cover their feet with wings just to be in his presence and to think that that holy God looked down and spoke to me who am I who are we that he would humble himself the Mighty God and speak to a human being speak to some young man speak to us how wonderful that he can humble himself just just to talk to us and how we should we should give him more time if he is that willing to speak to us how we should give him more time I remember when when I moved the Lord miraculously gave me a job in Louisville which is right outside of Jeffersonville when I moved things were going good with my new job and it and and I was I was succeeding and I was prospering in everything that I was doing and then once again the Lord laid it on my heart okay now move into the ministry and I was I was about 35 years old then and and I and then the Lord opened up to the for a position for me to have in the ministry they're in Jeffersonville and I remember I went to my boss I I had sent in resumes and and wanting to to to work with the bride of Christ around the world and doing everything that I could and then finally when when I was able to make the transfer and I told my boss I went to him and I said his name is Mark I said Mark I said it's time for me to leave the USGS the government and he said are you nuts those those were his almost his words I left left out one word [Music] but he said are you nuts and and I and I told him I said I said these words I said Mark I said when I get to the end of my road when I get to the end of my life I want to be able to look back and say that I did something I want to I want to be able to look back and see that I accomplished something and studying the environment and and all that it's good but it's all going to perish but if I could accomplish something to lead someone to Christ that's eternal and I I told them that and and he looked at me and he said he says you know he says I know you and he says I could I know you're sincere and he wished me all the best as as I left that and went in and went into the ministry and my point in saying that is what I told them is that I want to be able when I get to the end of this road I want to be able to look back and say Lord I served you Lord I helped someone even if it's just one if you think it could be a child or it could be an adult or whoever it is if I could just say Lord I I accomplish something I didn't spend this whole time of my time on Earth serving myself I did something for someone else and I was as I was pondering on that the past few days I was thinking about all that's going on in the world and we see that there are certain banks that that have collapsed and and it scares people we see that we see the economy and it's just it's just teetering we don't know even The Economist they don't know what tomorrow holds we've spent so much money we've printed so much money that we see the inflation rising and and no one really knows what could happen and I think about the leaders of the country and and the decisions that they are making and I think that when we they get to the end of their roads and they look back and they come before the judge and they look back and what will be their legacy what will they have left in their wake maybe a destroyed country sin in the country and promoting the things that they promote is awful and and just making it okay and actually encouraging the people to to move into sin and when they stand when these politicians and these leaders stand before the Lord will it be like Ahab where it said he where the Bible says that he walked in Wicked Ways and not in the ways of his father David would it be like that or will it be that this was a good man a good woman that accomplish something in their lives thinking about that this week and looking at Sometimes some of these trials that have been going on and these lawsuits and we see that that that they use the courts to further their political agendas today sister Shirley and and I were talking um before church or after church the other day and and talking about this court case that's that's going on with this man this sinner of a man a lawyer that was just convicted of killing his wife and his son and all of the the filth that followed that that man in in this court case and everything that came out and these lawyers on both sides and how they were arguing and and seeing that this is our world that we're living in this filth and so what's his name Alex uh Murdo yeah and and and seeing that and and it brought to remembrance something that a court case that happened about a year ago and it was a young man named his name is Kyle Rittenhouse and this young man he was about my son's age and I was he he got that kind of a big puffed up you know he got a gun and he was kind of the conservative type where the the Second Amendment type where they they they're excited about the guns and and it's it's really important to them to to be able to defend themselves and and have the weapons and and and he got he got into that crowd and he went there was riots going on at that time um in Illinois so he was going to go and he was going to go and protect these businesses so he got involved maybe with the wrong group of people and they weren't doing anything wrong they weren't breaking the law but maybe they got a little bit excited and and he goes and then he got in over his head and this Riot is going through this mob of people and all of a sudden they single him out and he has his his rifle with him and he takes off running and they start chasing him and he he falls to the ground and in self-defense he fires his gun and he kills someone I believe he wounded somebody else so the government takes the the media takes this instance that had happened and they put it in front of the whole country and they are going they are going to crucify this young man because of of the social agenda to get rid of guns which was which was their agenda in doing this so this young man who seemed like a good boy he hadn't done anything wrong he hadn't even broken the law he was defending himself and they made him out to be a horrible person so he he goes into this trial and and the the lawyers are arguing back and forth and they're saying these different things and his lawyer is representing the best that he can and then it comes to the end of the trial and here is this young man he's got five counts against them one of them is murder and here he is in front of the in front of the jury and his lawyers give their closing statements that's the title of my sermon today is closing statements his lawyers give their closing statements for this innocent boy whose life is on the line they did the best that they could these lawyers knowing that this young man was innocent they they gave their their position to the jury and to the judge then the jury goes out and they deliberate over the the case five counts again one of them was murder at least one of them and they bring the jury comes out they reach a decision and the judge they give the decision to the judge the judge has the paper and he says will the defendant rise there that young man was I think of my son with his life on the line standing up by himself in this courtroom and he's standing there and I put myself I don't know why but I somehow I put myself in the position of this defense attorney and that defense attorney is he is sitting there with his notes in front of him and the young man that he represented who he knew was innocent and he's he's there and he's saying William what must have been going through this man's mind he's innocent and all this jury's decision was based on what he said how important were those closing arguments those closing statements of this of this lawyer the young man standing there the lawyer sitting in his his chair and he must have been going through his mind I hope I said it right I hope I presented this right this young man could go to prison because I made a mistake because I didn't do things right he's standing there the judge with the decision and he says on count one I believe the juror read it not guilty on count number two not guilty three four five not guilty not guilty not guilty the young man started shaking he started crying he just collapsed at the last the last verdict Justice was done that day but how much was on that lawyer's closing statements and as I thought about that over the time I thought all of us are in that same position as those lawyers were and how we are presenting Jesus Christ before the world and it is up to us to present this man that died for our sins in the right way and how much is how much is writing on what we say and how we say it and I was thinking of of all of these great Servants of the Lord Through Time that their Ministry built and built and built until they had their final closing statements and I read from the Apostle Peter in his closing statement his last letter that he read Before Peter went to the cross to be to be crucified upside down and how much he must have put into that letter I look at look at John the Baptist and John the Baptist he was he was he's born and he went into the Wilderness and everything that was about John his whole life was building for this closing time that he had John just had a little bit of time he came on the scene he started preaching the gospel he started getting a following people started listening to him people started watching him this man is different he's different than the others that we've heard following him he he got his disciples John did and he's he's talking about and he started talking about the Messiah and he started talking about my job is to introduce this Messiah not be the Messiah they thought that he was the Messiah many of them did but his job was very plainly he said no my job is to introduce him I'm not worthy to untie his shoes that's how great that this man that's coming is then one day John on the Jordan River is baptizing them baptizing people he had many disciples probably far more than even this in this room but there were two two disciples that John had that were were very special that God would use from John's closing statements that God would use these two men to change the world those two men their names were Andrew and John John the Baptist is baptizing and he sees this man walking up to the water and he said behold the Lamb of God I got maybe we should read that scripture I think it's worth reading let's see John chapter 1 verse 36. John the Baptist speaking and looking Upon Jesus as he walked he saith Behold the Lamb of God and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus they did what the prophet said here is here is John the Baptist in his closing statements he said Behold the Lamb of God and there's John and Andrew we love you John we believe you're a prophet we're going to follow him because that's what John said how many people stayed with John the Baptist as I said you know we probably have 100 people in the congregation today how many if there was that many with him it was two just two we know for sure that went and did what he said a very small portion of the people so then John continues on and he continues on preaching his message and his gospel and he's baptizing people and his disciples come up to him and they're like hey John you remember that guy in the river John was probably like yeah the one that the spirit of the Lord descended upon and rested upon him and I said Behold the Lamb of God and then he went into the yeah that guy yeah him they're baptizing more people than us ah you didn't get it they're baptizing more than we are John says listen listen to John's closing statements John says he must increase I must decrease the testimony of every Christian of every minister of every pastor of every of every priest whoever it is I must decrease he must increase and that is the goal for all of us if if I could point to Christ and say lift him up and you come to him you get to him he'll never fail you I will fail you I need to decrease Jesus said the greatest man born of a woman was John the Baptist he had the first converts to Christ no wonder he was so great can you imagine the honor of all the thousands of years that the Bible has written you had the honor to have the first converts to Christ oh I would love to have that so no wonder he was the greatest and then John the Baptist steps back Jesus goes on John's time was over and he was condemned to death killed but he left his closing statements with us in here and they are recorded saying that he is the one I am not the one but he is the one follow him and God bless those disciples that actually did what he said in his closing statements I want to get into another great servant of God that never knew the Lord Jesus in his in his flesh when he came until he was 33 years old the Apostle Paul didn't know him but he knew him in his resurrected power and the Apostle Paul a great man of God how many people we look at John the Baptist and how many converts he had he probably had more than two but we look at Paul Paul took John's message of the Messiah and he took it to the word and had thousands of converts set up churches and it all over the place in in Asia Minor in Europe and and in that and was preaching the gospel with power and demonstration the same as Jesus preached it Paul took that message and he set himself aside and he preached Christ and lifted up Christ the accomplishments of that man Paul are almost without measure taking two-thirds probably two-thirds of the New Testament is Paul's writings this great man and then Paul as with John the Baptist as with Jesus as with Peter as with all of these men of God Paul comes to the end of his ministry and there was one young man that Paul was speaking to and Paul had like I said with these lawyers he just had a small amount of time Lord getting let me get this right because there is so much resting on what I say Paul has this young man named Timothy and he writes Timothy a second letter we call it second Timothy these are Paul's closing statements for his ministry and and listen to what our brother says about how a Christian should be and if you want to read a a book in the Bible that shows us genuine Christianity turn to Second Timothy I'll tell you what he goes through it all and you even see the prophetic gift of the Apostle Paul in second Timothy let's turn to Second Timothy we'll start with verse 1 chapter 1. Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus to Timothy my dearly beloved Son it's his son in the gospel grace mercy and peace from God the father and Christ Jesus our lord I thank God whom I serve for my forefathers with pure conscience that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day greatly Desiring to see thee being mindful of thy tears that I may be filled with joy when I called the remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dealt dwelt first and thy grandmother Lois and thy mother Eunice I am persuaded that in the also look at these two sisters we think about closing statements and we think about Lord have I made an impact and how in raising children how important it is that we teach them correctly and we look at Lois and Eunice and what they did in raising this young man and him seeing their example and them reading the scriptures and teaching this Timothy as he was growing up in Lois probably teaching Eunice and then Eunice teaching Timothy how important is it for us as parents to teach these kids right to show them how important this Bible is how important that the things that are written in here to apply to our lives so much is at stake and Lois and Eunice they were up to the task they didn't waste any time they had Bible reading at night they had prayer in their family and look what it produced It produced a minister that's recorded in this Bible as being a very special man all of us have that same opportunity as Lois and Eunice did and if you're all breathing right now which it looks like you all are there's still time don't ever say well I didn't do it I I I failed that if there's breath in your lungs and your heart's beating then there is time there is time to serve God there's time to make an impact let's skip to verse 12 for time's sake for the which cause uh let's let's go to verse 11. yeah good weren't I weren't too I'm appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles for the which cause I suffer these things nevertheless I am not ashamed ah Timothy listen I'm not ashamed of what I'm telling you I may be Paul is writing this letter from prison and he's condemned to death and as he was on trial which which if I if time allows I'll read it but as he was on trial people left him they were embarrassed of him and yet Paul stood alone but he never wavered for the which cause I also suffer these things nevertheless I am not ashamed for I know whom I have believed brother Wilson who is that man that he believed the Lord Jesus Christ bro I know who I believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day I am persuaded that he is able we pray so often and and we're worried we worry so much we think that that these problems that that we see in the world maybe we're going to suffer for them or it might be a sickness that's that's upon us or it might be a wayward family member or it might be sin it might be something that we've done but ask that question is Jesus able is he able is he able to heal the sick is he able to forgive my sins that's the question is he able not will he but is he able Paul says I'm persuaded that he is able then in second Timothy chapter 2. start with verse 7. consider what I say and the Lord give the understanding in all things remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raid raised from the dead according to my gospel he says remember what I've preached to you Jesus was raised from the dead that's my message remember that where and I suffer trouble trouble as an evil doer and here he is Paul is condemned to death and he's saying I just had this trial where and I suffer trouble as an evil evil doer even under bonds but the word of God is not bound therefore I Endure all things for the elect's sake that they may also obtain the Salvation which is in Christ Jesus Jesus with eternal glory I'll go through these things I'll suffer these things so that someone might receive Christ that's the most important part of life is that someone would receive Christ with eternal glory it is a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shall also live with him Christianity is not an easy walk but in the world today we want easy you know there's there's no sacrifice and very little sacrifice we want our own desires and we can't so often we can't even get along with our own families we can't even get along with our co-workers and yet we claim to be Christians a Christian walk is not an easy walk it is a walk of sacrifice just because somebody's getting more than you or more than me and I want to get up and fight how is that Christianity Christ died Christ died for sinners and if we have the spirit of Christ are we not willing to do the same are we not willing to give up a little bit of our rights Something That We're entitled to you know and it's we've witnessed the people and and we're trying to get them maybe to believe like us and if they will just accept the message and come to my church then I'll serve them no if they will come to Christ and I'm going to serve them anyways Jesus came he preached things that just didn't make sense serve your enemy yes that person that hates you yes that family member that insults you yes serve them be a Christian and then you'll find you'll win that person even all the way to our neighbors you know I talk about I talk about driving in the car because that's a weakness that I have you know is that right though it's wrong to sin no matter if you're in your car or you're talking to your neighbor and your neighbors throwing stuff into your yard or or trying to um whatever neighbors do that's sinful but we need to be Christians that we might win that person you know there's so much more even all the way to giving to our tithes what are we supposed to do with our ties well I don't have quite enough this month so um I'll guess the Lord's gonna have to wait we put God first in all things whether it be our Tides or whether it be our feelings or whether it be our desires or whatever it is Christian Life is a life of sacrifice let's skip to verse 16. but son profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness watch our speech don't be irreverent the Amplified version of that scripture says this but avoid all irre irreverent Babel and Godless chatter with its profane empty words for it will lead to further ungodliness and their word will eat as doth a canker of whom hymenius and felitus who concerning the truth have aired saying that the resurrection has passed already and overthrow the faith of some look how important the speech was of these two brothers they were brothers there were people from the church they were talking about the resurrection they were talking about religious things they weren't talking about March Madness they weren't talking about the next basketball game they were talking about things of God and they're saying that oh the the resurrection is passed and then they they start saying these doctrines over and over again and then as they say these these these doctrines then it becomes the word the more you hear it the more it becomes the truth and then these doctrines get entrenched let me read a let me read a quote from the book an exposition of the seventh Church age of the seven Church ages says this but see yes but see what was happening back there that false Vine was getting a hold and it was teaching that rulership by man was right it taught that the church had to be governed it taught that control over the people but instead of doing it God's way they simply took Authority invested all the spiritual power in their own hands and came out with a holy priesthood standing between God and the people they went right back to the old aeronic system they went right back to Aaron and his sons and the high priest and all that when Christ that veil was torn open and now Christ can come into the person that time stayed God's Wrath until the Holy Spirit could fall they became Antichrist for they disposed of his mediatorship and imposed their own God hated that the Ephesians hated that and any True Believer will hate it too we would have to be Stone blind not to see that same thing at work All Through the Ages and right now it is the worst of all what it was is an organization that separated the people God's people are supposed to be won by one Spirit they are all baptized into the body and everyone is to be moved upon by the Holy Ghost and everyone is to participate in the worship of God when we start drawing circles and separating ourselves when we start cutting each other out because maybe you don't believe it like me we could fall into this exactly what the author is what brother Brandon is saying here but men wanted the preeminence so they took over control and Bishops became archbishops and with imposing titles they bypassed the word of God and taught their own doctrines they got the people to obey them until the time came that their way of worship did not in any way at all resemble the early days after Pentecost that's a statement from Apostolic succession it was one easy and quick step to church membership as the means of Saving Grace the word was reduced to a Creed Antichrist by his Spirit was predominating the church a a look at the the way that the world is going the way that our Brethren have gone sometimes the way that we do church sometimes the way that we have become does it even resemble what was in the book of Acts in this separation we have and drawing these circles smaller and saying we're the elite we're the special ones how does that line up with the apostolic Doctrine how does that line up in reaching out to people I don't care how they look reach out to them don't make them like me or make them like you make them like Christ I I don't have let's let's let's skip to Second Timothy chapter three this know also remember these are Paul's closing statements he's about to die he's about to go to the guillotine and he knows it this also know that in the last days perilous time shall come and he's saying that my son Timothy when you see these things happen no that the end is near for men should be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient into parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection true spirituals false accusers incontinence Fierce despisers of those that are good Traders Eddie high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God we're like oh yeah that's that's everywhere it wasn't back then he's telling Timothy my son listen when you see these things come to pass when you see this ungodliness around you know that this is the last days it's so common to us as that quote I just read over and over and over we just hear it over and over and over and it becomes not a big deal we just walk outside the church and we see all the drug addiction we see all the prostitution we see we see the filth that's around us all it's just it's just what it is we look and we see people constantly promoting themselves as I said before setting up a shrine to themselves online called Facebook and Instagram and all and all of this and and lifting themselves up it was never the case but now it is and the Apostle is saying when you see this having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away they have an outward religion they might profess Christianity but their very lives deny the power of God if they truly believed God being the righteous judge would they live the sinful lives that they're living denying the power thereof denying that God's promises are true with their very lives denying it but they lie but they gossip about each other denying God saying well yeah I know you said it but I'm going to deny that not with my mouth but through my actions verse number 10. but thou has fully known my Doctrine manner of life purpose faith long-suffering charity patience Timothy you've seen the way I lived you've seen that I really believe what I'm preaching stand strong with this these are my closing statements Timothy hold strong I'm about to go to my death then received similar statements to all the disciples and yet we honor this book we read it we say it's absolute truth but then we're not willing to do it we're not willing to to make a step and actually live a life I'm not talking about pointing our fingers at everybody else I'm talking about this guy am I really willing to sacrifice my life for this not give it lip service I've used the illustration before it's your birthday so I'll pick on you Daniel of of my son and cleaning his room Daniel clean your room okay Dad next day room's still dirty dad imagine if Daniel said this and this is our attitude dad I love the way that you said that last night Daniel clean your room he dad that was just that was so great it was so inspired oh it was just it was such a blessing it was so authoritative dad it was so good oh it was so deep wow Daniel clean your room and it was so admit so much you know and there's so there's so many different things Dad I'm gonna learn it in Greek it was just it was great Daniel clean your room and the room is messy and that's our attitude towards this gospel it says it here so why do we not do it Paul is laying out this to his his Apprentice Timothy verse number 13. but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but continue thou in the things which thou Hast learn and has been assured of knowing of whom thou has to learn them you learn this from me is what Paul is saying have I not proven have I not proven to you to be a servant of the Lord and who have we learned from and look at the examples that we have as a congregation and look at how much this means to us this message of the Gospel of the end time and I hear well I'll skip that part um verse number 15. and that from a child thou Hast known the holy scriptures remember Paul is here speaking to Timothy which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus remember his mama Loa of Eunice and his Grandma Lois you know these things because somebody took the time to teach you all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness don't just teach your kids Malachi chapter 4 and Revelation chapter 10 and Luke chapter 17. teach them the whole book all of it is important if we're just teaching certain scriptures that match our doctrines then we are failing our people we're failing our our children we're failing as ministers We are failing just because somebody said that you can't understand it if you don't have a prophet teaching you that is not what this word says this word says right here all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine all of this book it's it's all a blessing every word that's in it is inspired for a proof for correction for instruction and righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works another translation the English Standard Version says that the man of God may be competent equipped for every good work now Paul's closing statements second Timothy chapter four as he was writing this letter to Timothy a Wonder if his hand was shaking I wonder what was going through this man's mind as he's closing this letter knowing that he is about he's in prison knowing that maybe right outside of a cell room was the block that he would lay his head on and the execution would come and kill him imagine this man these closing statements from this representative just as as I was talking about the young man and and his lawyers how important how much more important are caught our Paul's words because this is eternal life this isn't 20 to 40 years in prison this is eternity Paul says this I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead and his appearing in his kingdom I charge you Timothy this is important preach the word be instant in season out of season always be ready reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lusts shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears Amplified version of that says for the time will come when people will not tolerate sound Doctrine an accurate instruction that challenges them with God's truth but wanting to have their own ears tickled with something pleasing they will accumulate for themselves teachers to satisfy their own desires and to support the errors that they hold the people require a pastor or a minister to preach certain doctrines that is what this scripture is saying it's about a weak pulpit and a congregation that is requiring us to say certain things or we don't want that you know what that doesn't feel right pastor that doesn't feel right minister Heap for themselves teachers they accumulate these teachers for themselves and then all of a sudden we're all saying the same thing and who knows if it's right or not because it's not God saying it they shall heed for themselves teachers you know something that after service oh brother Daniel that was such an inspired message made me feel so good I was so encouraging I just I just really love that continue to say that by the way it helps me I know but that maybe telling you something that makes you feel good but doesn't do any good that doesn't help you in this life Jesus said straight is the gate and narrow is the way and few there will be that find it look at our congregation today if Jesus Christ was standing here straight As the gate and narrow his way and few are going to find this straighten up Jesus was telling us that there are going to be very few in Matthew chapter 7. verse 22. the Lord Jesus says this many will say in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and then thy name cast out devils and in thy name done my wonderful works he's talking to Jesus whoever's saying this what name is he talking about Jesus have we not in your name done these things then I will profess the Lord Jesus talking I will profess unto them I never knew you depart from me you that work iniquity you know it's like bro Daniel now are you going to do like all the other preachers you're going to tell us we shouldn't be we shouldn't be spending so much time until watching television we we shouldn't the the women shouldn't be wearing makeup and and we shouldn't be going to movies and we shouldn't be doing all this entertainment no I'm not going to say that what I'm going to say is we're not spending enough time in prayer our precious time then there's only a each one of us is just allotted on a certain amount of time it's not spent in the right ways that's great you know that God sent a prophet nice the Devils know it too you know what's popular is and I'm not talking about Catholics and and Methodist and Baptists and all the different denominations I'm talking about us I'm talking about these closing statements that these Servants of the Lord said verse number four Timothy listen and they shall turn their away their ears from the truth and shall be turned into fables but watch in all things endure afflictions do the work of evangelists make full proof of thy Ministry Timothy was not a prophet Timothy was not an angel messenger Timothy was a man he was just like me just like you he was a human being and he said yet Timothy make full proof of your ministry fulfill the duties of your ministry do this work that this Bible commands you to do we when you know when you when you have somebody come stay with you and you know that they're going to be there in like three weeks family or whatever it is then you start working on the house and it's like okay I gotta get that I got to get the picture hung here and I got to get the I gotta get the new linen for the beds and we got to paint this room we got to do all this and you do it just because that you have to prepare for these people coming well why didn't you do it before but there was a warning saying that someone is coming that you're having a guest so get the work done and that's the same that our brother Paul is saying when you see these things happen it's a warning that there's someone coming for I this is so sad Timothy Paul tells Timothy the musicians could come Paul is telling Timothy he's saying all that I've taught you hold fast to it Timothy these things are important live right don't fail because when you see these things happening the end is nigh the end's going to be here there's a lot at stake Eunice Lois Timothy Daniel all of us there's a lot at stake for I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand oh I've fought a good fight I've finished my course I've kept the faith and henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love is appearing [Music] verse number 16. at my first answer no one no man stood with me this is when he was on trial but all men forsook me I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge look at the Spirit of Christ in Paul he forgave them and they may have left him but who would you want to be on your side flesh and blood or the spirit of Christ notwithstanding the Lord stood with me and strengthen me that by me the preaching might be fully known and that all the Gentiles might hear and I was delivered out of the mouth of a lie of the Lion and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work and preserve me unto his Heavenly Kingdom to whom be glory forever and ever amen [Music] he is warning not only Timothy but thank God that we have this letter he's warning us he's warning us that in these last days a perilous times will come men shall be lovers of their own selves let me read it again [Music] preach the word be instant in season and out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall they Heap for themselves teachers having itching ears [Music] and they shall turn away their years from the truth and shall be turned unto Fables but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the working of an evangelist make full proof thy Ministry [Music] the closing statements of the Apostle Paul [Music] brother Branham took what I just read [Music] wrote it those scriptures on a piece of paper as he was laying the Cornerstone for his church in 1933. took that paper and put it in the Cornerstone of his own church [Music] prophecy of what would come later built the church that's a fact that's not me making that up you can go back and you can read what he said he wrote that scripture down and stuck it in the in the Cornerstone they shall Heap for themselves teachers having itching ears turning from the truth to Fables and then as with Paul brother Branham had his closing statements in this book an exposition of the seven Church ages he finished his book published in the last couple months of his life [Music] and how did he close that book he said this I sincerely believe that the spirit of God has been speaking to us not only teaching us the truths of the ages but he has been faithful dealing with the hearts that they may turn to him that is the reason for all preaching and teaching for it is in the preaching and the teaching of the word that the sheep hear the voice of God and follow him [Music] not for one moment do I bring a message to people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship and organization I have never done that and will not do that now yet we've done that I have no interest in those things closing statements I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and people and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied tell me this as I read this what greater thing could anyone accomplish think about John the Baptist and what he accomplished that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and Men wherein men become New Creations in Christ filled with his spirit and live according to his word [Music] I'll read it again wherein men become New Creations in Christ filled with his spirit and live according to his word I would invite plead and warn all to hear his voice at this time and yield their lives completely to him even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to him God bless you and may his coming Rejoice your heart God's servants are not about cutting the people out look at the Apostle Paul preach the word make full proof of your ministry do what you say live that life [Music] and because in the last day these teachers are going to come and they're going to be saying just what the congregation wants them to say so they can keep their job they're going to be saying they're going to be getting maybe mega churches coming together just love brother just love one another just just just feel good and make sure you pay your tithes and everything will be okay no this gospel is deeper than that [Music] we must live our lives according to what it says and if we are slacking I'll do it tomorrow I'll hang that picture tomorrow I'll clean my room tomorrow but I love the word it says to do it but I don't do it when the disciples came to Jesus and they said but we thought that Elijah was supposed to come first Jesus said he already came and you didn't know him [Music] how many people might say but where's the return of the lord it's already passed missed it we missed it because we weren't living every day according to this gospel [Music] forsaking ourselves and serving one another putting the other person above ourselves these little things as the word says so easily beset us but a little thing can send us to hell [Music] an unconfessed sin something that's not under the blood these are perilous times as the Apostle said so let's make sure we are doing our best we're living right not judging each other but judging ourselves living a life of servitude of Christianity that's what Christ is amen let's stand [Music] one of the closing statements that I mentioned [Music] red brother Branham and how he ended his ministry with those things told this story before but brother Jonathan you you sang that song in the wings of a snow white dove on Wednesday I was listening to that William Branham told my dad told my grandpa in 1961 he said this song that's on the radio on the wings of a snow white dove he said I have a message that I want to preach and I want to title it on the wings of a snow white dove 1961. he said when you hear this message he says you'll know it's my time to go [Music] he died in 1965 December he preached that message at the end of November 1965. closing statements every day could be our last make sure that we are able to look look back and say Lord I did my best I served you LED people to Christ it wasn't about me my life wasn't live for myself as judas's was my life was lit for you Lord can we say that will you do it Amen brother Matthew [Music] he hating me [Music] oh God [Music] Spirit Within me foreign [Music] [Music] Spirit Within Me o cast me not away from that prayer Lord and take not thy Holy Spirit from me [Music] restore unto me the joy of thy salvation [Music] Within Me [Music] creating me a queen oh God and when you were right Spirit Within Me creating me a clean heart oh God and renew our eyes Spirit within me brother the visitor brother here you have such a nice spirits [Music] oh Lord [Music] thy Holy Spirit from me [Music] restore unto me [Music] the joy of thy salvation and renew our right spirit s my brother if you come forward think about what there is to do [Music] let's serve God we only have a short time let's serve him let's do as these Great Men of old in their closing statements and women in their closing statements and the legacies that they left let's create a spirit around us that Holy Spirit Point people to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ the times at hand that our lord Jesus will return there are hard times ahead [Music] only through Christ will we be able to get through and it has to be a relationship that personal relationship it can't be your pastor it can't be a prophet it can't be someone else it has to be your relationship your relationship with Christ and he'll hear you he's heard me before and if you hear me he'll he'll hear anybody I bless you friends think on him as our brother comes in the microphone [Music] watching [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] change our heart mold our mind transform Our Lives for as Daniel told you today the coming of the Lord is not at hand [Music] and he will receive all those [Music] that will come to him in humility in love and ultimately in the strength of his power amen Lord I Thank you for this message this morning Lord I believe that that message was sent right from the Throne of God to our ears here today I'm so grateful for your word [Music] I'm so grateful for your Prophet William Branham that came and took took us back to the word and may we continue in our lives when things come up situations Sorrows pain that we go back to the word amen he says in the last day there's going to become a Revival of the Bride [Music] these days are among us now and that whatever will restart and the two things that you must do to start Revival in your own heart is open confession and esteem the word to first place [Music] his word did deliver it has delivered and it will deliver amen everyone that holds true to him this word that he spoke of today there is nothing else that holds the strength like the Gospel of Jesus Christ [Music] and he said they overcame by the by the Lamb of the blood of the Lamb of the god and by the word of their testimony so we are encouraged to have the same testimony in that testimony [Music] Spirit of Jesus Christ within us reigning as a sovereign God the only living true word that we stand on today thank you Lord again for this message thank you for these people that have come and traveled and are hearing this word and may it resonate not only today but it but during the week when we're not standing
