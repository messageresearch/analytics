Lord God, you are the Almighty. You are the beginning and the end, the alpha and the omega. Lord, you are the creator of all things. And Lord, you blessed us by lowering yourself down to becoming a man here on earth to become our savior, a kinsman redeemer. Lord, we are grateful. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And pray that you would be, Father, with us in this service this morning. I already feel Lord that that you're here. Lord, I pray that we would leave this morning as [music] the disciples did on their road to Emmas and say, "Didn't not our hearts burn with us within us as he talked with us." By the way, bless our service, Father. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You can be seated. God bless you. First, I'll mention a few of the ones that um in a little bit I'll mention a few of the ones that aren't with us this morning. Uh because of some of the prayer requests we talked about earlier. Uh but I do appreciate the visitors that we have with us. My good friend, Brother Joe, Sister Aaron Robson, and the Robson family. God bless you. Brother Josiah's father-in-law, Sister Katie's dad. Welcome. God bless you. And then um say Michael and Cody over there. Bless you. You recognize me again with my beard. Last time they didn't. So we saw him at Costco and like who are you? Come on, man. [laughter] Not don't look that bad. Welcome. God bless you. And uh then uh uh Brother Mark, Sister Renee, Sister Renee there. Brother Mark right here behind me. That's uh Brother Josiah's dad. and mom. And uh then um we have uh Lizzie and John McGinley. Where are you? Right back there. Welcome. Oh yeah. Yeah. Welcome. God bless you. Good to see you again. And uh and then also um didn't recognize these folks in the back there. Brother John, Sister Latin um from uh right back there in the back with the family. Welcome. It's good to see you. You friends with um Sean and Ununice, right? Welcome. It's good to good to have you in service. Welcome our visitors, friend. [applause] Benjamin, my friend, good to see you. God bless you. I um appreciate I appreciate our visitors. I appreciate our congregation, all that we stand for. We have a joyous um dedication this morning. We get to dedicate a new little baby. We've done quite a few over the past few years and really looking forward to this uh dedicating Josiah and Katie's new little boy, Baniah. Before um brother Mark Ao, he uh would like to give a blessing to the child and and take it back to the word. So, brother Mark, if you would come up. There you go. &gt;&gt; All right. God bless you, Tucson Tabernacle. Such a privilege to be here. And it's my uh my first grandson. Um my father was a minister. He passed away last year. He would have loved to have been here. Um but I'm wearing one of his ties in honor of that. So, he would preach in this tie sometimes. So, uh, and then I'm in the ministry and then my son Josiah, you know, so we've got a lineage going here and, uh, I looked up the name that his parents chose, Baniah. And what do you know that the father and the grandfather are also mentioned in the context with that boy Baniah, who is one of David's mighty men. And it calls the grandfather a mighty man. So, that's a good start right there. That goes for brother Joe, too. So names have meaning. So I had to of course look up what the name means. And I'm sure there'll be some more talk about that. But these mighty men uh were warriors and they were like the special forces in David's time in David's kingdom. The best of the best. But before they ever got to that, they had to do something even more special. They had to go against the majority and switch sides from the majority, which was the kingdom and the administration of Saul, and follow this renegade David out there in the wilderness who could offer them nothing. No material rewards, didn't have a kingdom, didn't even really have a home, but he had the anointing that he would one day be king. So one outstanding trait that Banayiah in the Bible had is he was an early adopter. He was one of the first ones to get out there and be on David's side and leave everything and follow that. So that's something rare. But he as things go on, we find out that it's the same uh God, but the anointing changes a little bit. And the people of God can get a little bit confused as the anointing changes even though it's all God. And this type of person is a minority in the in the aspect that they can also change the anointings within the anointing. So that's a very uh more refined kind of discernment. And as the more I read about this story of what Baniah actually did and all the little hiccups that even the people of God stumble over, he went through all of them. &gt;&gt; Amazing. So he made the corner. We even see that in sometimes in the New Testament when you think about the fact that John the Baptist had disciples, a lot of them, but only a couple of them followed Jesus. They continued following John. And they even questioned some of the ways that why don't they behave the way John's disciples behave the same anointing on John and on Jesus but the practice changes a little bit as time goes on. So following God, the early adopters. Well, Banayiah was one of those. He was the son of a priest. Jehoeda, this is a pretty powerful name stacking up here. Son of a priest, a mighty man, quick to follow David. Caught the anointing very quickly. But when David got old, the anointing was going to change again. And it was going to go to Solomon. And it was another time of confusion. All around the country of Israel, there was confusion. Who's going to be the next king? And the majority went after another son, Adonijah. They had the big crowd with them. And of all of David's mighty men, the only one that's mentioned that made the corner from David to Solomon was Baniah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? &gt;&gt; And they were all mighty men. They earned their stripes. They bore the reproach. They were the old fighters. They were with David through thick and thin. But when the anointing changed a little bit, it's a minority within a minority that can make that second corner. This little youngster Solomon that didn't look like that's the way the anointing would go. But it was only the prophet Zadok or the priest Zadok, the prophet uh Nathan and the mighty man Baniah that made it to the kingdom of Solomon and became the general of the army with no battles to fight because it went from the time of war to the time of peace. So he had to actually switch his whole everything he was trained to do to now function in a kingdom of peace. So I was just amazed when I saw all this. That's you know if you're going to pray for a child to be have that kind of gift on it on his life only God can give that raise a person through all that. And so he makes a a wonderful uh person to take into life your name Banaya. Let's look in the scripture and see what that name means. I thank the congregation. I thank all the family and everyone who has supported and been with our family and Josiah and my son William who sang here today. We've got a lot of family today here and my wife and now the newest member we're going to dedicate, my grandson. God bless you, Baniah. This is a blessing on your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] Can I keep you up on the platform? Brother Joe, would I get you to come up to and let's let's dedicate this little guy. Um Josiah and Katie, I um I'm due to be a grandpa any day now. And the thing that I've been most worried about is I don't know if it's gonna be as cute as that. I feel so inadequate. It's such a beautiful little baby. Come on up here so that everybody can see us. Katie, congratulations. Bless you. Thank you. This is little Banayiah David. Am I right? By David, bring him here to dedicate him and give him back to the one that gave him. I'm going to hold you tight. I know how to do it. Little Joe, Mark, lay your hands on the baby, please. Lord God, what a wonderful day that we have that we can dedicate a new life to you. Father, this little boy, we don't know what you have in store for him, but but Lord, we pray for great things upon his life. &gt;&gt; Lord, may he live like Baniah of old lived. Father, may he be fearless, whether it be in the face of a lion or in the face of a Philistine or Lord, today in the face of sin standing for you. May he be strong &gt;&gt; as his name's sake. We pray. May he stand as Baniah stood for David. Lord, may he stand for the king of this day, our king, our lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; May he stand, Lord. And I pray your blessings upon his life and upon the life of his parents &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. Little guy's like everybody else. When I start to get long-winded, he starts to complain. [laughter] What a what a blessing. What a blessing that we have to we can dedicate a little guy back to the Lord and then we look forward to seeing and grow up if the Lord would terry and and be a real servant to God and dedicating this baby. And this past week, I've seen the importance of a church, just a local body. We talk a lot about the bride of Christ and and we talk a lot about the second coming and these things are are very they're great and they're very important. But one of the gifts that God has given us while we're here is a local congregation that can stand by each other and support each other and and love each other. Scripture is on my heart. I'm going to um my sermon today is going to be on Romans chapter 12 but um 1 Corinthians chapter 12 is very similar and it says when one member of the body suffers all the members suffer with it or when one member be honored all the members rejoice with it. Most other translations they um they they give us an understanding of of this in saying that we should be patient with one another in our weaknesses and we should take on the suffering of other people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what a church does. &gt;&gt; That's what I've seen in this past week. We we celebrate the life of of young Banayiah. Praise God for that. But we've also pulled together in uh very very difficult ways. And we have suffered with sister Esther. Is sister Esther here? Bless her heart. We've suffered with sister Esther losing her son. I think he was in his mid30s. Am I right? Ununice was about that. 31 32 31 unexpected. And the mom mourned, of course, the loss of her son and the church gathered around her and suffered with her really fulfilling this this scripture. And then we see uh brother Juan and sister Lima O'Hada and they see how what happened with them this week. And I've been keeping the church informed. This is all in one week. They were in uh their daughter was in a tragic accident. A four-year-old little boy um died and then the three other boys are in the in the vehicle with them. Little boys, they're in critical condition now. Their lives just hanging on the balance and hanging on if um God's choice, what what is he going to choose? Is he going to choose to bring them out or is he going to choose to take them? And I know we as parents, we would be crying out to God, Lord, heal my child. But we should really be praying, Lord, what is your will in this because you know better. You know better than than anyone else. He um as I was in the hospital with them, uh it was late at night, I it was one or two in the morning and um they showed me a video of the little guy and they they sit over in this area here and the little guy had his hands up and he was singing a four-year-old boy. He was singing I give myself away. and just think how how beautiful and how wonderful it is &gt;&gt; that the church would provide a place for these people to worship and and I talked with brother Juan and he didn't have a place really that that really loved him and really really respected him and then he found this church and he sees the the love that we have given him and his family &gt;&gt; and and the support that we've given him and the and the support that brother Lionel Sister Lonnie have have showed and and it's it's it's vital. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, I I think about just something as simple as as brother Josiah choosing that song that day. I give myself away. The choice of the song, having a place to come together, having a place to fellowship, to shake hands, people that that love them and welcome them. How important is that? And I I think Lord, even the song I give myself away, there's a four-year-old boy singing that he wants to surrender his life to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He probably didn't fully know what it meant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he did. And then not too long later, the Lord took the little boy home. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And as I was talking with the family, I was &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. I was saying that you &gt;&gt; that everybody was weeping around when they found out that the child had passed and and my words were this boy, he's never going to have to go through what you're going through right now. &gt;&gt; He's never going to suffer. &gt;&gt; He's never going to go through a hardship. &gt;&gt; He's made it. &gt;&gt; He's passed that. He's not mourning us. &gt;&gt; We're mourning him. &gt;&gt; And he doesn't have to He doesn't have to lose a loved one. He doesn't have to weep. He doesn't have to cry. He is in the arms of Jesus Christ, a sinless little fouryear-old boy. &gt;&gt; And I think raising his hands. I give myself away. How important. been talking with Sister Esther this past week and losing her son and and she was she's so strong and she found joy in this not in joy of loss but in joy that there is a promise &gt;&gt; there's something greater that she has that she knows that her son is he is not struggling there there's nothing there's nothing wrong with him anymore she has a promise that she is going to see him again &gt;&gt; and now she has support in a church that loves her &gt;&gt; and everyone that everyone that that came into the hospital or talking with Sister Esther, they all see they all seem to say the same thing. He's in a better place or you're going to see him again. And that's why we're here. &gt;&gt; We have a we have a hope. We have a hope that Christ that we will see them again. And soon friends that hope that we have is going to become a reality &gt;&gt; and we have to struggle through this day. You know I we we mourn with each other and then brother Manny when we're dedicating your grandbabies man it's just we we're blessed with each other. We just rejoice that God has brought children into the world that we can that we can enjoy and raise and have and we rejoice when we baptize. Friends, when when we come up into the baptismal and and and people come in there and and they want to give their hearts to the Lord, they want to make this outward expression of of this is what the Lord has done in my heart. Now I want to show everyone that I am a Christian and I am going to serve him all the days of my life. And they come up and and they show the congregation. We baptized over the past couple years over 90 people. &gt;&gt; And and most of those new converts. Most of those aren't children. They're adults that that want to make a change in their life. And we're not baptizing them into the Tucson Tabernacle. We're not baptizing them into this church. We are baptizing them into the body of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they are taking on that name. &gt;&gt; And it's it's a blessing. And the thing that I see in our church that I'm so blessed with is that we have patience with each other. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, it's a place really for the sick to come and they can be healed. It's it's a place for the sinner to come and repent. It's a place really for the kindhearted to help someone know that that you're loved and that we'll give you a right hand of fellowship. We'll give you love. And it's just friends, a church is so it's so important. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 15 says, "Then that we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves." English Standard version of that says, "We who are strong have an obligation to bear with the feelings of the weak, the failings of the weak." We who are strong have an obligation to bear with other people's failures and not please ourselves. We have a long way to go, friends. In many ways, we have a long way to go. But our successes have been largely because we have borne the feeling the failings of the weak. And the foundation of this to be able to do that, we haven't pleased ourselves. It's we've served others. And that's what a church is. I say it many times and I say it again. Don't come to this church. And I hear so many people say, "Well, I don't get fed at that church. You don't get fed at that church. Well, then how about you start feeding someone then? &gt;&gt; You know, you start doing something. If you're put out with your church, it's like, well, maybe you need to make more of an effort. &gt;&gt; Maybe you need to do more. That's Christianity. &gt;&gt; We serve one another. And that's what a church does. We're here for one another. And I'm going to be talking about there's gifts there. Every congregation, including ours, every person in the building today has a gift to bring to this church. Or if you're part of another church, to bring to that church. That's why we have church. &gt;&gt; It's to bring our gift to the altar. &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, here's what I have to off to to offer." And then you'll find, you know what you'll find? &gt;&gt; You'll find that you'll receive everything that you need. You will find you'll find that your attitude changes. &gt;&gt; You'll find that you have more love. You have more compassion when you stop thinking about number one &gt;&gt; and you start thinking about other people. &gt;&gt; The there's two chapters in the Bible that I see describe really the church that God wants us to have. That's 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and then Romans chapter 12. Both are speaking to largely gentile audiences, but there is a mixture of some of the Jews in there. And sometimes that mixture is is a little bit hard to deal with. And there's an underlying theme in both chapters. And it's especially made plain in Romans, but it's also it closes that chapter in First Corinthians. And 1 Corinthians, I'll I'll I'll read that last statement. 1 Corinthians 12:31. Now, this is he he lays out how the churches should be. And he talks about the gifts in the church. He talks about prophecy and healing. And he talks about gifts of faith and and serving one another. And then he closes this portion of letter. He said, "But covet earnestly the best gifts." and and talking about the gifts. And they said, "But yet I show you a more excellent way, though I speak with tongue of men and angels and have not charity, which is love, and become a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol." Now, Romans 12, which we're going to read, I want to read the whole chapter, and uh I can cut my word short, but I want I want everyone to just take on this Romans chapter 12. it this this theme of love can be seen throughout this chapter. Romans chapter 12 verse one. Let's just read it. We read it together. Thank you. I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. and be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. I see that scripture every time I walk into my office, I have it plastered on the wall. For I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly according as the grace according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. For as we have many members in one body and not and all members have not the same office, so we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members of one another. &gt;&gt; This is a profound statement. When Jesus was walking the earth, all of the gifts were in sight of him. You notice throughout the gospels, they had to get to Jesus. He would he would give part of a spirit and they would go out and they would heal and they'd come back. But all the time salvation rest in rested in Jesus Christ. Healing rested in Jesus Christ. All salvation it everything rested in this man Jesus Christ. Then when he died on the cross, died for our sins, was in the tomb for three days, rose on Sunday morning, went up and then sent down, broke himself apart, tore himself apart, and placed those gifts into his church &gt;&gt; at the day of Pentecost when we received the Holy Spirit. And now all of us have a portion of those gifts. And I say to you is what what Paul is saying here that we all have a role to play in the work of God. Everyone has a role to play. &gt;&gt; Now Paul's going to go through with the different gifts in the ministry. [snorts] Having then gifts offering according to the grace that is given us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith or ministry let us wait on our ministering. Or he that teaching teacheth on teaching. I uh I have to go against my nature. I always want to stop and talk. I get so excited when I read the scriptures. I want to talk and I want to stop and talk about them, but I'm going to try to read through the whole um through the whole chapter. Or he that exhortth on exhortation. Those are encouraging words. Or he that liveth or he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity. That's generosity. He that ruleth with diligence. He that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness. Let love be without dissimulation. Let love be dis let let love love be sincere without hypocrisy. Abore that which is evil and cleave to that which is good. Be kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly love and honoring preferring one another. Now these next three verses are really the theme for my sermon this morning. Not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord. English Standard Version says, "Don't be slothful in zeal. Be fervent in spirit. Serve the Lord, rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing instant in prayer." That is the theme that I want our church I want our church to have for this upcoming 2026. rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, and continuing instant in prayer. The amplified version, it's a little easier to understand. It says, "Constantly rejoicing in hope because of our confidence in Christ, steadfast and patient in distress, devoted to prayer, distributing to the necessity of the saints, giving given to hospitality." I'll read the rest of the chapter. Bless them which persecute you. Bless and curse not. Rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that do weep. Be of the same mind one to another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits. Recompense to no man evil for evil. Prove things honest in the sight of all men. And if it be possible, as much as lith in you, live peaceibly with all men. Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place under wrath. For it is written, vengeance is mine, I will repay, sayeth the Lord. Therefore, if thine anger, if thine enemy hunger, feed him. Thine enemy hunger, feed him. If he thirst, give him drink. &gt;&gt; For in doing so, you shall heap coals of fire on his head. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. It's my New Year's message this morning. Rejoicing in hope. Verse number 12. Rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing instant in prayer. Another translation in Romans 12 says, "Let your hope, let your hope keep you joyful, &gt;&gt; know just going through this past week, as I was saying, there wasn't a time there was weeping in the week and in all all the all the things that were going on. There was a lot of weeping. There was a lot of crying out to God. But one thing I didn't see, I I didn't see any complaining. What I saw was it was it was it was thanksgiving that when something like this hap happens, there was hope there saying that I'm going to see this person again. &gt;&gt; He's going to be there. And hope lies. It It resides in Jesus Christ. That's the only place that we can have hope. That's right. and thinking and talking about these losses that have happened. We have promises that we all look to. Listen to this. 1 Thessalonians 4:13. You can put it up if you can. 1 Thessalonians 4:13. But I would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep, Jesus will bring with him. Of course, they're rejoicing over that. Of course, Juan and Leman are rejoicing over the loss of their their grandchild is because they have this promise. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of with the voice of an archangel, with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Who is the dead in Christ? They're the ones that have gone before us. So if the Lord Jesus comes today, those that are dead in Christ, those that we have lost, they are going to come up and we're going to go together. If the Lord carries until we die, we're going to be the ones &gt;&gt; that come up out of the grave. There's going to be a generation one day that sees the second coming of Christ. And you know what? If you are a Christian, you're going to be in that generation. No matter if you passed a hundred years ago or 200 years ago, you are going to see it. If you are resting &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. and so shall we be ever with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Wherefore, &gt;&gt; listen to this. Wherefore, comfort one another with these words. &gt;&gt; Brother, that's awesome, man. &gt;&gt; It's what we we're doing. We might not They might not even know that they're quoting that scripture. You're going to see them again. &gt;&gt; And where does this hope come from? Where do we get where do we get the hope? A messenger from God carries this hope with him. or her and gives it to the ones that need it. How many times have people told me I've messed up my life and they're they're thinking that they're beyond happiness that that they can't ever come back because of the mistakes that we we made. Yes, we suffer for our mistakes. But don't you think that Jesus can fix our mistakes? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And return joy to our lives. &gt;&gt; But sometimes you need a messenger of hope. You need an angel of hope to come and tell you, "Listen, it's not all that bad. You can recover from this. I know it seems bad, but there's the the night is going to end and the the sun's going to rise." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was a woman in the Bible, one of my favorite stories from Jesus. She had sinned. There is no doubt that she had sinned and ruined her life and ruined the life of another family. She had committed an adultery with a married man. And the punishment for this back then the punishment was death by stoning. That is what you did. Today you may kick somebody out of church or something like that. And it was as common back then as doing something like that today is stoning. And they come to Jesus and and they knew there were these Pharisees knew they hated him, but they knew that he had a burden for the lost. They knew that this man Jesus Christ had a burden for the sinner. &gt;&gt; Those are who he surrounded himself with. They're like, "Oh, he's around with drunkards and publicans and and dishonest tax collectors. That's who he hangs out with." &gt;&gt; They knew that he had a burden for those people. So they said, "Hey Jesus, let's show your let's show who you really are again. What do you think about this woman?" Maybe she was tied up. Maybe she was on her knees on the ground. They said, "What do you think about this woman?" Jesus, he didn't answer them. I wonder if he was wonder if he was thinking. They knew that the Bible taught very plainly from the books of Moses, this woman should be stoned. They could open up their Bible and they can point. Here's what the word says. Now, you're going to live up to it, Jesus. Jesus bent down, started drawing in the sand, stood up, and he said, "All right." Basically, he said, "All right, go ahead and stone her." He said, "But let you that is without sin, you that has never sinned, you cast the first stone." They're all standing there with their stones. Jesus basically said, "Go ahead and do it." But you that's without without sin, you start the mob. You start you start attacking people. You start you start condemning people. You start judging people. You do it first. You that is without sin. Let me hear you start talking. You start putting people down because you think that they don't live up to your Pharisee religion. Let me see you do it is what Jesus was saying. And then the wise ones, who were the older ones, the wise ones had the stone in their hand, they threw it down. They started walking away. And from the oldest, I assume the more wisest to the young more zealous and maybe more fullheartedly until there was no one left but just Jesus and this woman. &gt;&gt; And Jesus is standing there maybe all the stones laying around her. Can you imagine this woman? I'm talking about hope today. &gt;&gt; There was no hope for her. She had sinned. She was she was finished. She was caught in the act. She had probably ruined another family. She was a lowly person. And now the law said you are to be stoned. There was no hope for her. She was she was gone. But you know what? this voice. When she heard that voice, I wonder if she's heard if she felt a little bit of hope in this man. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ brings hope to our lives. No matter what you have done, no matter what you have gone through, no matter your sins or no matter your loss, Jesus will always bring hope. And there he is. She hears that voice. Jesus says, "Sister, where uh where are your accusers? They're all gone. &gt;&gt; Jesus stood up again and said to the woman, "Where are your accusers? Didn't even one of them condemn you, sis? They're all gone. Didn't just one of them condemn you?" And there she is, and she's seeing the manifestation of the hope that's in Jesus Christ. And she says, "No, Lord. They're all gone. And Jesus said, listen to this. &gt;&gt; Jesus had there is no condemnation in Jesus Christ. You know what Jesus says? He says, "Neither do I. &gt;&gt; Neither do I condemn you. Go and sin no more." The spirit of Christ is not condemnation. &gt;&gt; It tells us that there's a way out. It tells us that there is redemption for our sins. It does not say necessarily you are a sinner. Usually friends they know that it does say that there is hope. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How important is hope in our lives? There was a woman that had a question torn up maybe maybe feeling the same as this woman did in the when she was going to be stoned and she had she had messed up. She asked brother Brandham a question. She said, "I've sinned many years. I have lived many years and sinned until I found the Lord." Please, Brother Brandham, I have sinned again and I'm not worthy to come before you in this holy place. &gt;&gt; Please tell me if I can be restored whole again. The condemnation of the enemy beating this woman down. The answer says, "You have not sinned, my friend, so far in God, but what you could not be restored. If you had sinned so far that you could not be restored, you would have never wanted to be restored. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But as long as there is something dealing with your heart, you're still in line of re of restoration. &gt;&gt; Guilty of the least is guilty of the whole. Brother Bram continues, "I have sinned many times. Every one of us do things that we don't want to do. Every day, every one of us do things that we don't want to do. That's a messenger of hope. That's an angel of hope that could come. And friends, all of us should be those angels. And that's the spirit I want to present &gt;&gt; from this church in 2026 that there is hope. There's hope for our families. There's hope for a a a sinner. There's hope for our neighborhood around this area. There's hope and there's hope for anyone. No matter how bad that they look, no matter how bad the situation is, there is a hope in Jesus Christ. It was not worth It was not worse. There's no situation worse than this woman who is about to be stoned to death. &gt;&gt; There's no situation that's that bad. You could be on your deathbed. The Lord can raise you up. Right. &gt;&gt; You could have sin. I have messed up so bad. Yeah, but you're throwing out hope. You're throwing out Jesus Christ when you do that. The one who ascended up on high, friends and led captivity captive. He gave gifts to men and women. us in this church. Everyone in this church has a gift to bring. You have something that God has called you to do. If you are not operating in in that gift, then the church is incomplete. &gt;&gt; In 2024, we met each other and and the church was growing and and we got to know each other. It was really the the year of of um getting acquainted. Then in 2025, we built, brother Pat, it was a year of construction. You notice everything's changed, man. It's we we built a facility that we can use. The facility doesn't matter, but it's what the what is the facility is used for. And now in 2026, I want to this to be our theme where we go out and we become angels of hope to the world to our ne and let's start in our neighborhood that no that everything's going to be okay that God is on the throne and I am that messenger to tell you that Jesus Christ saves that Jesus Christ heals that Jesus Christ can change the situation. Every person has a gift. Paul's talking about in 1 Corinthians 12, he talks about tongues and interpretation of tongues. He c he talks about administrations. He talks about leadership. He and and we talk about outreach and we talk about the ministry. We talk about gifts of faith, gifts of prayer. But there's also, you know what? There's also gifts of doing the sound in the back. There's also gifts of taking care of the church. There's also gifts of of gardening somewhere where we can help to make this place nice so so everyone can enjoy it. We all have a part to play and we should do the best that we we know how to do the best that we can do in doing that part. And then you watch how God blesses it. &gt;&gt; He will bless you. You you'll be surprised. It's like, "Oh, well, I just I just sweep the floor." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Aaron and I Brother Aaron and I were here one time and uh we were moving stuff around, moving furniture around. We're moving the pulpit around. We're standing there and church is dark. There's nobody here. We're just laboring. We're just working. All right. You never think God could use that, do you? Here we are. And man, we turn around and there is a man sitting on the front row covered in blood. It scared Aaron to death [laughter] and turned around. We're able to witness to that man. We're able to pray for that man. He had just gotten beat up on the street. And why were we able to do it? It was because we were here working. Amen. &gt;&gt; We were operating in the calling that God had placed before us that day. &gt;&gt; You have no idea if you are operating in that calling. You have no idea how great it can be. If it's sweeping the floor, if it's moving furniture, if it's standing in the pulpit, whatever it is, God can use it. &gt;&gt; Let me just let me read the let me read the scripture again. I got way too much going on. I uh I don't I don't want to I always, friends, when when I'm ministering, I I don't want it to be about me and I don't want it to be about me trying to get out what I want to say. I want to I want it to be the Lord using me, using the congregation. And just because I want I want to say something, it doesn't necessarily mean that the Lord wants me to say it. But I do believe he wants me to encourage the congregation today. This is a year and just in the past week, it has shown this is a year that we can be angels of hope that we can give hope to other people. I want to I want to have a um a gathering for the the neighborhood. I want to make it nice for them out here and just say, "Come on in. Oh, we're Christians. We love the Lord and we love you." And that's what Christians do. Brother Josiah and the worship team can come. Romans chapter 12 again, verse 12. Rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing instant in prayer. We rejoice because we have the hope. But we are patient in tribulation. Things happen. Hard things happen in our lives. And we shouldn't always be saying, "Lord, what did I do to deserve this? What did I do to cause this to happen?" Maybe it's not that. Maybe it's just that he wants to give us a tribulation. Give us a trial so that we will draw closer to the to him and rest in him and have comfort in him and continuing instant in prayer. That word instant continuously praying all the time. That is how that we find joy in tribulation. That is how that we can encourage others. That is how that that we can take our place in God's perfect plan is if we're praying and we're putting this before the Lord. I can't that story of that little lady and how that that she's she's there and her life was ruined. It was over. It was done. And yet, I'm sure there was so much shame. I'm sure she was just dying to herself. And I'm sure there was all of this regret. And then here here comes the thought of I'm I'm going to be publicly executed. This shame is going to be on my family. This is just this is the worst thing in the world. And plus, you know what? I would just rather die. I would just rather that these stones come down upon my head. And then Jesus, he shows up. He says, "Listen." He says, "Everybody has sinned. These men over here, they showed a little bit of wisdom in not condemning this little lady." Jesus says, "Listen." He makes a way. He says, "Where are your accusers?" And friends, when people come to this church in 2026, that's what I want them to find is they come in and they say, "You know what? I don't have any accusers here. These people have the spirit of Christ. There's no condemnation &gt;&gt; in there." And then they have hope and that hope starts to build and then the joy starts to come in and then their families start to come in and then then there's more joy and more joy and then then the hardship when the hardship comes they're more able to handle it. When one of their children dies in a car accident or or their son their young son dies of a heart attack, they have the ability now to get through it because they have hope. and who brought him hope is a messenger of hope which should be us. Love one another. Help one another. The Apostle John, the one that was closest to Jesus. Really, if Jesus had a best friend, it was John. Read his epistles. Just love one another, friends. Just love each other. Be there for each other. Don't judge one another. Just just encourage one another. And then that's how the body of Christ grows. It grows. It grows through reaching out a hand of fellowship, not condemnation, but justification through Christ. You with me, friends? None of us I love the way Brother Bram said it. None of us have sinned so far that there's no that that you can't come back to God. That's the devil in your head. He's in there and he's he's pointing out all of your failures. And then you know what? You can just point him to that woman that was about to be stoned and said and say, "Satan, there's all kinds of stories like that in the Bible. I'm one of those. I'm one of them. I'm a Jesus person. I'm a Christian." And [music] you know what? this this blessing, this lack of condemnation that that Jesus had with me, this this spirit of salvation that Jesus had, I'm going to spread it. I'm going to spread it to others in this year 2026. Let's get to work. &gt;&gt; We need help, right? We need help in this church. Let's get to work, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. Bring your bring your sacrifice before the Lord. If it may be that you sacrifice an extra 20 minutes, 30 minutes a day praying for the ones that you see in church. Maybe that's your calling as a prayer warrior. Maybe your calling is to get out and win souls, win souls to Christ. Or maybe your calling is to win your children to Christ. Maybe your calling is to like me and brother Aaron moving the furniture. But you watch what God can do with it. What is the man named Shamgar in the book of Judges? You know what his calling was? He's a farmer. Just a farmer. Not anything special. This man Shamgar, he was nothing. And then he took here comes the Philistine horde coming to destroy him and destroy his his family to destroy his village to rape the women and steal them and and steal their livelihoods and kill all the men. And you know what Sham Shamgar did? He had a he had an ox coat. He had a poker that he would poke the cattle with. The spirit of the Lord came on him and he took that and he killed hundreds of Philistines &gt;&gt; and all his calling was was to be a farmer. He judged Israel. So whatever that calling is, God can make it great if we humble [music] ourselves, love one another, put him first. The way we serve God, I say it many times. It's not what you don't do for God that matters. Well, I quit smoking. I quit drinking. I quit wearing these clothes. I quit doing this. I quit doing that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's good. I'm glad. That kind of stuff just kind of falls off when you have a focus when you're doing something for God instead of instead of not doing something for God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Josiah, &gt;&gt; thank you. Let's sing that song again. I give myself away. I give myself [singing] away. I give myself away so you can use [music] me. Give myself [singing] away. I give myself away. So [music] you can use me. Here I am. [music] Here I stand. Lord, my [singing] life is in your hands. Lord, I'm [music] longing to see your desires [singing] revealed [music] in me. I give myself away. [music] I give myself [singing] away [music] so you can use me. I give [music] myself away. [singing] [music] Give myself away so you can use me. Take my heart. [music] Take my [singing] life as a [music] living sacriice. Lord, all [singing] my dreams, oh [music] my plans, Lord, I place them in your hands. [music] I give myself away. Oh, give myself away so you can use me. [music] I give myself away. I give myself [music] away so you can use me. My life is not my own. My life is not my [singing] own. [music] To you I belong. I give myself I give myself to you. My life is not my own. [singing] Lord to you I belong. Give myself [music] give myself [singing] to you. I was just looking for it. There's a scripture and believe it's in Isaiah. It says when the enemy comes in like a flood that God will raise a standard against them. When the enemy comes in like a flood to to all of these these hardships and trials. It could be drugs with a loved one. It could be someone that's just questioning their very salvation. When that enemy comes in like a flood, God sends us as a standard against it. &gt;&gt; That we might be an angel of hope to people who need they genuinely need something. Do you want to be that standard that God raises up against the enemy that you can go to battle? The way that you battle him is you love that person that needs you. And then let me tell you something. Nothing could ever stand before your prayer. Let's all stand. when he reached down his hand for me. [music and singing] When he [music] reached down his hand [singing] for me. [music] I was [singing] lost and undone without God [singing] or his son. When he reached [music] down his hand for me. Once my soul was astray. [music] Once my soul was a stray. of [music] the head and leave the flame and was red [singing] [music] and vile as could be. Oh, but [music] my savior [singing] above he gave me peace, joy and love. Hallelujah. when [music] he reached down his bed. Oh. Oh, sing it now. When he reached Oh, when he reached down his hand [music and singing] for me. Oh, and he reached [music] down his hand for me. Oh, I [singing and music] was lost and undone without God [singing] for his son when [music] he reached down his hand for [music] me. Can you imagine Peter? He was serving God. He was doing really good. He walked out on the ocean, walked out on the sea, and there he is. He's saying, "I'm being a Christian. I'm doing it. I'm performing well." And then like that question that came in, Lord, I failed. I messed up. Is there any redemption for me? And there is Peter. He loses faith and he begins to sink. He starts looking at all the storms. He starts looking at all the problems and the lightning and the thunder and the waves and he begins to go down and there was no salvation for Peter. There's no way that his his friends could have thrown him a line. They couldn't see him. It was dark outside. All kinds of problems. And then a hand reaches down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And grabs Peter and pulls him back up. Can you imagine? Let's be that hand, friends. Let's be the hand that God uses. One more time. I was nearing [singing] despair [music] when he came [singing] to me [music] then. And he showed [singing] me [music] that I could be free. Then he lifted my feet [music] and gave me glory [singing] complete. when [music] he reached down his hand for me. [music] Oh, when he reached out his [music] hand for [singing] me. Oh, when he reached down [music and singing] his hand for me. [music] I was [singing] lost and undone without God [music and singing] or his son. And he reached down his hand for just one more time. When he reached down his [music] hand. When he reached down his hand [music] for me. [singing] When he reached down [music and singing] his hand for me. I was [music and singing] lost and undone. without [music and singing] God or his son when he reached down. Let's bow our heads. What a beautiful song, friends. Is every one of us here with your heads bowed and thinking on these things? Be that angel of hope. Every one of us is called to that. Reach out your hand to someone that needs you. Let this be the year. And we call many to our savior and our lord Jesus Christ. Jude said, "Pull them out of the fire." &gt;&gt; Jesus reached down and pulled Peter up out of the water. The Lord Jesus, he did it by just a few words. Let him that is without without sin cast the first stone. Compassion, forgiveness, and love in that man, Jesus Christ. I pray that all of us have that. Now I ask each one of you to be that angel to those that need you. Father, Lord, we're grateful that you've given us a work to do. Every one of us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, we pray that we could be good stewards of what you have given us. And as the parable goes that we wouldn't bury our coin in the ground, bury our talent in the ground. But Lord, let us take it and multiply it. Take what you have given us and build upon it. Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, may our lives be focused on you and upon your children. and help us, Father, to look back, look past our own faults and past our own past our own lives and past our own selves and start looking to the needs of others. Lord, I thank you for a church that I've been very proud of this week and have reached out. Lord, thank you for testimony that Josiah gave me about how many people in this church have reached out to him and Katie with their love and good wishes. Lord, I'm thankful. Lord, I never want to neglect to say thank you for what you've given us. &gt;&gt; Now, Lord, I pray that you would give us our commission and help us to move forward into this new year. Father, with patience and spreading hope, the hope of Jesus Christ, that others may rejoice like we do in that hope of Christ. Lord, we thank you and and ask that you would look past, Father, our shortcomings and our weaknesses. Lord, we thank you for each other. And now father we want to do our part in serving you and serving your people in Jesus name. Amen.
