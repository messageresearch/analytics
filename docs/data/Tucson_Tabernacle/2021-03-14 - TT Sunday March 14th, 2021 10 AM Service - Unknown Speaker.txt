heard brother branham i was listening to a sermon this week and he was just singing this song just the way he's saying it i thought that doesn't even sound like i know it's they come from the east and west but i said that doesn't sound quite like that i had to pull up the words to just kind of confirm it in my heart but since jesus has set us free man they come from the east and west they come from the lands of fog to feast with the king to dine as his guest how blessed these pilgrims are beholding his hallowed face a glow with light divine last partakers of his grace as gems in his crown to shine since jesus has set me free i'm happy as heart can be no longer i bear the burden of care his yoke is so sweet to me my soul was as black as night but darkness has taken flight now i shout the

home in those mansions fair his hand hath preserved for all for the wedding beast prepare obeying the gracious call oh since jesus has set me free i'm happy as heart can be no longer i bear the burden

our lord this moment should come for those who are free from sin then would it bring you joy for sorrow and deep despair when our lord in glory comes we'll meet him up in the air since jesus has set me free i'm happy as heart can be no longer i bear the burden of care his yoke is so sweet to me my soul was as black as now but darkness has taken flight now i shouted the victory for jesus has set me free amen oh jesus is coming soon our trials will then be amen amen just welcome all our visitors here this morning just each one of you that's here i didn't get anything wrote down specifically but i know my cousin zachary and hannah wallace are here with their family it's good to have them i believe sister hannah i've asked you to sing a song special if you're available this morning so if you could just make your way now i'm going to read a praise i've neglected to get this to brother aaron he's going to do the prayer requests but i got this sent to me this morning and i neglected to send it to him so i'm going to read this praise that she comes and makes ready this is from brother david hakami he says dear saints just over a week ago while driving north on i-19 between amato and green valley at 75 miles per hour i struck a rock or concrete block about the size of a five gallon bucket i was behind a vehicle in the left lane and switched to the right lane as soon as i turned into the right lane the obstruction appeared traveling at 75 miles per hour i knew if i tried to avoid it i would overturn the car with both hands on the steering wheel i accepted what was to come next after the hit i quickly looked in the rearview mirror and saw the obstruction explode in many directions the rest area was ahead so i pulled to the side of the highway limping along until i got there the right front had a bubble on the edge and the right rear back tire had a hole in it about the size of a half dollar there's a small dent under the right passenger door so i'll know so i will not ever forget this life experience after taking out the spare tire i picked up the car i jacked up the car and pulled off the blown-out tire a young man came behind me and offered to help without giving him a response he immediately grabbed the spare tire put on the lug nuts then returned it to his parents car i always changed my tires myself but i recognized this eagerness to help and truthfully welcomed his offer then while driving home with a thump thump sound i noticed that the rear the right rear hub was tilted inward repairs have been made to the vehicle and i have no injuries i have the full confidence that my lord is with me even in me i give thanks to my lord daily he constantly helps me this was an accident very bad things could have happened but they didn't and he kept me from real danger thanks be to god amen you know my sister-in-law was driving yesterday in louisiana and she noticed a car was coming down the freeway pretty fast and then all of a sudden came across the median and she swerved and missed the car but the car head-on collision with the car right behind her and she just thanks the lord that it wasn't more serious for her and fortunately nobody died but she could have been right there right there at the head-on collision so the lord is gracious and mercy full to all of us amen god bless you when i first began to walk with the lord i did not fully trust him but how he longed for me to understand that i could so through the valley he led me afraid as i could be until i felt his loving arms embracing me and i've been through enough to know he'll be enough for me he's come through too many times and that puts my mind at ease for good and i'll take my very life that he's going to take care of me [Music] you see i've been through enough to know he'll be enough for me how could i ever doubt whose hands hold the universe how could i ever question his ability see there's no place that i could go where my god doesn't know the things that trouble me he's always aware of where i am and what i need you see i've been through enough to know he'll be enough for me [Music] he's come through too many times and that puts my mind at ease for good and i'll stake my very life that he's going to take care of me [Music] cause i've been through enough to know he'll be enough [Music] true so nevermore will i doubt or question why cause i've seen him work before and i know what god can do i've been through enough to know he'll be enough for me [Music] he's come through too many times and that puts [Music] he's going to take care of me cause i've been through enough to know he'll be enough [Music] [Applause] amen amen let's stand this morning ask brother aaron to come and take the prayer requests neglected for the current sister olivia brown they're sitting here in the front they're here so often i just kind of consider them like snowbirds from flagstaff but it's good to have you all with us as well amen let's just sing as brother aaron comes my jesus knows just what i need he satisfies he supplies my jesus knows just what i need oh yes he knows just what i [Music] need [Music] just one one more time sing it as a praise and also and understand why jesus knows just what [Music] oh yes he knows just what i [Music] every night [Music] yes we have some needs here to bring to your attention but knowing that god knows everything already and has already met that need when he said it is finished everything was completed and then so our sister grace taylor still asked us to remember her brother gabriel figueroa he hasn't been feeling well the last few days so we'll remember our brother gabriel [Music] brother lyle and sister heather arrived in egypt with the group that they were traveling with he sent us that note so let's keep them in prayer also in their their time there and sister shirley moore who was traveling this weekend to spend some time with her son just keeping remembering them in prayer and i asked sister roberts how brother dan was doing he said he's feeling better but he's still very weak so let's just pray the lord strengthen his his body as physical being so if he'll do that and then my wife requested a prayer for her nephew and his wife david in claudia alcantar claudia is ill and cannot work the family is struggling but most of all they need salvation so this would be david would be my nephew is the son of my wife's oldest brother and they they came out of the spanish church and they came out very disappointed and discouraged and just walked away from everything and she got quite sick and they took her in found out she was diabetic and she was going through a lot of problems and she's been in a lot of chronic pain and not been able to do but the other day she asked for prayer and there was a time that they would have nothing to do with that but you know you get into a place where you realize that there are only one that can help you and you turn in your luck to him and i'm glad that he doesn't turn his back i'm glad that he's merciful and he knows what we need so you have a need say lord i have a need you know what that need is sometimes you can't even put it in words there's something down deep in your heart something that's that's maybe you can't even explain it but you know there's a need but he's that satisfying portion if we can believe now as we pray lord is as we come to you not in our own merits but under the shed blood lord you bid us come you said to enter into this and and to to place our own hands on that sacrifice lord to to understand that it was for us lord and every need is supplied every everything we've ever even thought that we would need even those things we didn't even realize that we need lord as even in our own body we don't understand the workings as david said i am both fearfully and wonderfully made lord but you understand it very well lord we thank you for the testimony today of our brother david there in what could have been a serious accident and and also for our brother jordan's sister-in-law and sister martha's family there the keeping lord of watching over those lord that that will turn their face towards you lord we just thank you lord now every hand that was raised and every heart represented here lord and even those that maybe couldn't write it or or sometimes maybe lord we're a little embarrassed or we're fearful of even to raise our hands but lord look past that and deal with everyone we pray lord in jesus christ's name amen you may be seated thank you good to have brother zachary and his family with us i appreciate the the family and all that they stand for and as a young young watch them grow up as they would come to the tabernacle and remember years ago took the young people up to prescott there for a thing and got to got to know the the wallace family it's always been a blessing to us so and i i love the song that she sang it's it's one of my favorites is he's more than enough more than enough and we have another visitor here today and really special to my heart and lord willing if everything works out they'll be moving here and that's my daughter nina if their plans are to be here hopefully maybe nina there's a few that don't know you because they're looking for you stand up and [Applause] lord willing by maybe fall they'll be able to move here and it'll make dad mom happy i know that much but she was able to come in and spend a week with us so appreciate the goodness of the lord he is merciful i know sister i i when i see jeremy and his son and mom sitting next to her and she's smiling and happy it's good to know that that god loves us and he cares for us so this past week um i said different things with work and all and you realize how mindful god is of you i'm merciful when you hear things that others are going through and the problems you realize god's been so good to me how many could testify of that today god has been so good to me undeserving nothing that i did to merit it but god said i love you and therefore i'll take care of you so this morning we have a brother nathan erickson i don't know his some of them but i do i told him i knew his uncle ben and his aunt martha and mom and dad or grandpa grandma and grandpa that's that's who got to know brother ray erickson has been a blessing to me made himself available for counseling for for encouragement and so me just call me if you've got any questions or you need some help i'd be and he has and never in a in a a attitude or spirit of well i know better than you but just how can i help you and it's been such a blessing so i i would say that that brother nathan is is is carrying some of that from brother ray it's passed down in the family but you know who it's it's from the same one that loves you the same one that cares for you the same one that watches you i mean that's from the lord jesus christ so it as to each one of the ministers and i said it to him just be who you are stand up here and minister what god has given to you how many believe that how many have come believing and expecting let's stand and i want him to to have the liberty to minister and and let god have his way amen and brother branham said the bride's song amazing grace how many knows it's his grace and his mercy because who would determine otherwise how good is good enough to deserve god i'm glad

honor to be with you uh here in tucson tabernacle and and we just appreciate every opportunity to speak to the bride of jesus christ who is an august body and precious in the eyes of god it's uh it's a real honor just any time we can stand behind the sacred desk you know and minister the word but this desk feels a little more sacred than most to me because of the sentiment you know in my family my grandfather brother ray of course came to the message came to the lord under brother green's ministry and my my my father grew up here my uncles and my aunts and so uh it's just uh it's a precious place to us uh much that the lord has done over the years and and so uh it's just it's it's it's wonderful to be here they all of course send their greetings brother ray and the church there too or tabernacle and bluffton ohio they send their greetings the family sends their greetings the church sends their greetings brother austin peterson that's fellowshipping with us he sends his greetings brother wayne lawson sends his greetings you're very loved people and uh and many people are thinking of you and and uh praying for you and and uh and just think highly of the saints here it was uh it's just good to put faces to names that i've heard all my life uh brother ed dougal it was really nice to fellowship with you and prescott brother when he stopped in there and uh nice to meet brother aaron uh face to face and and uh uh just just everywhere we go around the message of the hour we find kindred spirits we find the family of god so we greet you all we love you and we wonder if you just turn with me to mark the fourth chapter we'll take our text good to see my great uncle kurt brown here this morning god bless you amen we love you just trusting in the help of the lord this morning i i got really heavy under some fresh inspiration yesterday and it sort of changed my approach a little bit maybe we'll be a little all over the place maybe it won't be a technically perfected sermon but that's not what we're looking for we're looking for the leadership of the lord and the ministry of the holy ghost only god can speak the word and only the holy ghost can interpret it to our hearts but i'd like to preach this morning by the help of the lord on the prince of peace prince of peace of course a name and a title by which god is known in the scripture and there's some precious things to me in this subject mark the fourth chapter and we'll start at the 35th verse and just read this very familiar story from the life of jesus and the same day when the evening was come he saith unto them let us pass over unto the other side of course of the sea of galilee and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there were also with him other little ships and there rose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full and he was in the hinder part of this of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awake him and say unto him master carest thou not that we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great call and he said unto them why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith and they feared exceedingly and said one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the sea obey him amen let's just talk to the master of the wind this morning heavenly father we ask that you'd add your blessings to the reading of the word father this morning we just look to you lord in the storms of life and in a dark age lord when when there's there are many turmoils and much strife and many things on the negative side that we could be looking at but father we we don't want to get caught up in those things lord we want to be cognizant father we want to recognize the presence of the master of the wind father amongst the bride of jesus christ we know that you're present with us father you sent a message to reveal that to us and oh god we're trusting in your presence this morning father a man any any human being has nothing within himself to offer your people lord we are helpless before you father but not hopeless lord for you have promised a comforter lord an inside teacher which will lead us into all truth i pray father that thou holy ghost would take complete control lord not only anoint the speaker today father but anoint the ears of the hearers alike lord that that your word would come forth by revelation lord and it would just make a difference in each life for for we want to be a help to your people lord your bride your beloved father i pray lord that you would take complete control as we surrender ourselves we surrender our ideas opinions agendas and thoughts lord to you and your word and ask that you would have your way in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen god bless you as you're seated this morning would you turn with me to take our text uh for the for for this morning uh in isaiah the ninth chapter the prince of peace isaiah chapter nine and just the sixth and the seventh verse there another very familiar portion of scripture of course it's a prophecy of the coming messiah and isaiah says here for unto us a child is born a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father and the prince of peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this amen amen so on this thought of the prince of peace one of my favorite types of studies to do in the scripture is to take the names of god things like the prince of peace or the god of our fathers or the lord of hosts and things by which these names and these titles by which god makes himself known it's always wonderful and edifying to run those through the scripture and and put those together because when god is when god is giving himself a label or a name it's revealing something about his character of course it's uh it's it's showing us something about the lord that maybe we didn't know before like uh you know in the in the in the old times of the old testament everybody knew that god was god but he was a mysterious god john said no man has seen the father at any time we knew that he was jehovah we knew that he was lord but but we find that uh we did not know that he was jehovah jireh until abraham was in need of a ram amen and and so when god revealed himself to be a provider then abraham knew him as not only jehovah but jehovah jireh amen we didn't know that he was a healer until he revealed himself as a healer now we know that he's jehovah rapha he is our healer amen and so we find that he is also the prince of peace and all these names of course are are all the self-same person amen we don't believe in trinitarianism or or or or some manner of polytheism but but we believe that it's all christ and yet he's known by these different names which are revealing aspects of his character and so we know this morning that he is the prince of peace and he is a god of peace and now so we read this prophecy in the book of isaiah and and of course it's a it's an advent promise it's speaking of his coming unto us a child will be born amen the same isaiah said a virgin shall conceive it's a he's coming it's a compound prophecy he speaks of the son of david rain which is for the millennial time when he shall bring the world unto order and so it's an advent promise it's speaking that he's coming and when he's coming he will be the prince of peace whenever the whenever he comes whenever he appears whenever his advent is he brings peace amen because he's the prince of peace just like paul said in the book of philippians he said the lord is at hand see an advent and appearing a coming he says and be careful for nothing don't worry about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god and the peace of god which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus see the lord is at hand it's a coming it's a and when he's coming he's bringing peace when he came when this child was born he brought peace on earth it was good will toward men he came with a good message with a gospel with good news amen it's it's peace not not strife not struggle not worry when uh in his presence there is peace he's gonna usher in this peace now now uh now his peace passes our understanding so his peace is not our idea of peace it uh it does not it does not match our expectations it does not it does not you know many times our expectations are wrong and that's why we have no peace but if he's with us then we have peace amen but it'll be his peace and it passes our understanding of course amen it's a good news advent it's a shalom and we've had a shalom in our time it's we've had an appearing we have had an advent amen of jesus christ revealing himself to his bride and what has he brought he has brought peace he's brought shalom amen a peace that passes understanding paul said don't be careful for anything so his peace is not in relation to our cares his peace is not in relation to what you're worried about what's going on in your life the circumstances around you the circumstances around the message none of those things have any bearing on the peace of god he is the prince of peace amen but it's his peace the first thing we need to know about god's peace it has nothing to do with circumstances it has nothing to do with symptoms it has nothing to do with the stormy skies cloudy skies are not a sign of god's disapproval amen and but it's it's actually in spite of the conditions in spite of what we see around us in spite of what our mortalites are looking at he's coming with peace amen in spite of all those things and his coming is not according to our expectations in the message the world is falling apart brother branham is talking about how the how that people always turn god down because he when he comes he doesn't come according to their taste right and we know these things when he comes it's so mysterious to the world that they always miss his coming they always miss his presence because because it does not match their taste he said it's the same thing today it doesn't come in our theological taste the message was not to the taste of this world it it did not achieve the things that the world and religious powers and religious systems were looking for but it brought peace it brought a shalom amen amen but he said but it comes in the way of the power of the demonstration of the manifestation of god's promise for the age exactly but they refuse it they refused it then he said and they refuse it today because it doesn't meet the expectation of the day according to the way that people expect it amen think about the first full minute fulfillment of the of isaiah's prophecy when this child was born amen when jesus took flesh on this earth and pitched his tent with us it was a great coming it was a great advent amen the prince of peace was amongst us but but there were a lot of disappointed people amen there were a lot of people who could not receive his coming because it wasn't according to his taste the pharisees were disappointed in the coming of the lord because he didn't endorse their religion he was not in favor of their religious systems he didn't pay respect to their power structures and amen judas was disappointed because he thought that jesus would come and he would overthrow the roman rule and he would bring in zealots to power and he would bring the son of david rain on earth and he his his uh his eschatology had one idea but when god came it was totally different amen so he was disappointed the rich young ruler was disappointed in the coming of the lord because he wasn't a respecter of persons he wasn't interested in status he wasn't interested in big names and big ministries and amen and and and power structures of this world but and it seems that today there are a lot of disappointed people with a message amen a lot of people it seems have become disappointed with this end time message that we believe with all of our hearts and many people are refusing this message many people are are rejecting it because it's not according to their tastes others are becoming discouraged because they're looking at the troubles that we see around this world and and not only around the world but around the message we see you know we see we see church is falling apart we see coldness coming in we see we don't see the moving of the spirit like we used to have it we don't see the supernatural like it was promised amen we see fighting preachers skirmishing over their pulpits and firing shots and amen we see doctrinal division we see denominational spirits taking hold of men and ministries and churches and we see all of those things and it causes people to become discouraged amen amen it's caused people to to because they're looking at the great darkness of this time and they become discouraged even with god's message amen i've been preaching a lot over the last couple years about zerubbabel's temple if i could just deviate onto this thought for a moment but you know that temple of zerubbabel is a is a perfect type of of of the ministry that we've received it's a restoration time amen a man is sent with the authority of a king to restore a right form of worship to restore god's temple amen amen it's a it's a it's a beautiful type of the ministry that we've had amen by a prophet through a message in our day amen to restore a message to restore the right worship of god but in and so it was a great time amen this time of zerubbabel but you know you can read there in the scripture about how the people amen the people that were under that restoration message they were under that restoration dispensation and they're they're they're seeing everything all the loose ends tied up as it were they're seeing everything restored back they're seeing the capstone being fitted to that temple and they're seeing all these wonderful things and yet in the hearts of many of the people there was a discouragement until god actually had to address it he had to address it through a prophet's message amen and he calls out this discouragement in the heart of the people and the discouragement was that they remembered solomon's temple they remembered how glorious it was they remember what god had done back then how did he how that fire fell from heaven and filled solomon's temple they remembered the gold and the finery and this and the cedar and the silk and and all the things that deck that temple and so when and here they're living in a great time a time of return from captivity it's a time of restoration amen but but the people were discouraged because what they were seeing with their eyes amen it didn't measure up to what they could look to in the past it seemed so simple seemed too humble and it actually caused the discouragement of the heart of people so what does god do he sends them a prophet in their midst amen and he says don't be discouraged people i know this house is in comparison of of solomon's temple as nothing but he said i'm making a promise i'm making a promise that there's coming a latter glory to this temple which shall be a greater than the former amen a great latter glory this prophecy of a latter glory see see god had something in mind and so it didn't matter the humility of what the people could do amen what was important was what god had in his heart because we know the fulfillment of that we know what that latter glory was it was the personal presence of the lord jesus christ in a flesh body when he came through the front door of that temple amen and the personal presence of jesus christ is a greater glory than all of solomon's amen amen and and that's why a greater than solomon is still here today in spite of the humility that we see in spite of dwindling numbers and church issues and darknesses of this time we're not looking at those things we're looking at a promise of glory coming to this bride christ the mystery of god revealed in you your hope of glory glory be to god amen and you know i i've been studying on that temple how to down through the ages all the things that transpired in history between the making of that promise and the coming of the lord jesus christ it wasn't long after that time that alexander the great conquered all of the eastern lands all of the persian empire and he brought it under his dominion and under that when he died his his empire uh fractured and a man named antiochus one of his generals took over all the persian lands including the land of judea and that's where you read the story of the maccabees and things like that and antiochus was a pagan man he erected a statue to zeus on the temple mount he actually sacrificed a pig on the altar of incense can you imagine amen then the romans come along and they kick out the greeks and the roman general poppy he sacks the city of jerusalem he walks into that temple he opens the curtain and a pagan unbeliever a pagan roman a gentile steps into the holy of holies and defiles it with his presence amen herod tries to patch it up amen but but the uh but the old forms of worship are gone the old the old prophets and the old and the old sacrifices those days were over and and he tries to add a new cord called the court of the gentiles amen so that the so the gentile people could come in and they could mingle with god's chosen people and it just desecrated amen the atmosphere of that temple amen and all those things are a type of our of the our religious day amen their type of how christianity in our day has been perverted even in message churches denominational spirits have had their way in many places and many ministries and many lives say man amen but you know i began to think about that and i began to marvel to think of all the sacrilege and all the and all the profanity and all the terrible things that were committed in that holy temple amen but he came anyway church he came anyway because why because god had a desire in his heart amen to bring his personal presence to humanity amen so that he could fellowship with us oh he knew the roughness of the hue as beautiful as solomon's temple was amen if you were to go back and see that place you would see humanity all over that building every stone that was chipped every every every sheet of gold that was hammered was full of mistakes full of imperfections full of humanity but he filled it anyway church amen because god is so desiring fellowship with his people that he would come he would come down beyond that amen that's the day that we're living in france he sees how rough the hue of these temples amen he sees the humanity of our lives he sees the problems in the world the problems in the churches and the problems around the message but it has not it has not staggered his program amen it has not it has not prevented his desire from coming to pass he is present with the bride of jesus christ amen he's real amongst us he's indwelling us he's with us and he's the prince of peace amen so we can have peace in spite of the humanity peace in spite of your problems peace in spite of your backgrounds if god amen if god would overlook the blood of a pig on the altar of incense a stench in his nostrils and he would come anyway to reveal himself to human race amen how much more amen will he come to a backslidden brother or a backslidden sister you're not bothering god by asking him to come back in you're only surrendering to his desire amen because his desire is to bring all everything he promised to pass and he didn't leave it up to you or i he came anyway with a new program i'm a little off my notes but it's wonderful to think about he came to that temple that had been defiled and how had been profane and every temple that any man ever tried to build god was desecrated and it inevitably fell moses built a tabernacle and it dissolved amen david had a desire to build god a temple but he had blood on his hands solomon built a temple and he was taken into babylonian captivity zerubbabel built a temple and it fell to the greeks herod tried to renovate a temple amen and it didn't work amen but jesus comes and he says you can tear this down because i'm going to build one i'll build one in three days of justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost i'll build a temple and then what'll he do i'll come to the temple that i built and this one won't dissolve this one won't crumble this one won't fail i'll i poured the foundation on the day of pentecost i brought down the capstone crying grace and then i came to the temple that i built and i inhabited with my own presence all that well god was he poured into the bride you or i didn't build this message we didn't build these churches we didn't build this movement we didn't start this revival it's a bride's revival we're not kingdom builders we're but we're in the kingdom hallelujah god so desire to have fellowship with man he comes to a flawed temple and he comes in peace not to destroy but to build to build something lasting to build something eternal to build something beautiful oh unto us a child is born unto us the sun is given you see god's word god's desire and god's plan cannot be defeated by human imperfections and that should bring us peace this morning to think brother branham preached does god change his mind and he spoke of a permissive will and he preaches about balaam and we're familiar with these things he says god has a permissive will and that's where the trouble lies we try to work on god's permissive will and he will permit it but also if we take his permissive will although it's not right he will make his permissive will work out to glorify his perfect will amen why because he's a sovereign god and he's ultimately in control he said there's nothing will go wrong with god every lick is hitting just exactly the way it should be and everything we think it's wrong but he knows that it's right glory be to god church amen we are not to look at the so much on the negative we are not to be discouraged looking at the problems facing the church looking at dark in the the darkness of laodicea amen we may think it's wrong we may think things aren't right we may we may think things need to be fixed but god is not out he's never lost control he's a sovereign god it'll come back to perfect to glorify his perfect will and we're not powerful enough in our humanity and the world is not strong enough in its darkness to frustrate the plan of god amen grace will perform this the zeal of god will perform this god's building up zion you see oh but they weren't satisfied with that son that was given because it was too humble it was too humble so they missed god's peace they thought this prince would come and he would be a great shining general that they that's the prince of peace that they had in mind a great shining general would open up the curtains of the table and step out fully grown and covered with shining armor amen he'd say caiaphas i've arrived let's overthrow the roman rule let's bring the whole world under our subjection let's let's take the jewish faith you know to its zenith and amen and and and by and and overshadow even solomon's empire that's what they expected and they couldn't receive christ in a manger they couldn't receive christ amen amongst animals amongst filth amen uh brother ram said said jesus christ god on a pile of manure god pitching his tent with us god in humanity they could not receive that church and when god comes when this prince of peace comes he always comes that way he never comes according to our grand expectations but he hides himself in simplicity the most powerful messages he ever preached he bookmarked them with god hiding himself in simplicity what do you think that simplicity is brother sister it's your life and my life our simplicity our humility our humanity just like he came in the lord jesus christ amen that's why they weren't satisfied with the son that was given and neither are they satisfied with the advent of the bride amen because people are looking for some something superhuman some kind of a public show some great thing that will just shake the world amen and so they cannot receive christ in you the hope of glory neither can you or i brother sister many times receive what a message is trying to reveal to us because we cannot look beyond this flesh but we have to look beyond the veil amen we must see beyond the veil and see the glory of god working in the bride but you won't see it if you're looking for your expectations amen it must be revealed by the message of the hour god chose to birth his child under the under the reputation of an illegitimate son that was no accident that was no unfortunate happenstance that was god's choosing it was his predestination to birth his own his own blood under illegitimacy under under low reputation under a bad background amen and so is it today what this world sees in is an illegitimate message as some old cult that's fading out and amen of something that's fallen to to warring preachers and differing doctrines and denominational spirits and what the people see is illegitimate amen it's nothing less than his coming it's nothing less than his advent it's nothing less than the prince of peace reveal himself in the bride of jesus christ and it's so close friends you and i would miss it if we weren't elected to see it because we're looking at the veil but we've got to look beyond these badger skins amen look beyond this veil that's the only way you'll see this ladder glory amen we've got to recognize our day and its message amen how many recognize the day that we're living in you believe we're living in the end time i'll tell you something my co-workers believe we're living in the end time people who don't even go to church that i've talked to have it all over their spirit and all over their knowledge that every that the world is coming to an end it's in the mood of humanity everybody knows everybody's recognizing the day but you've got to recognize the message you've got to recognize what god is doing you've got to recognize what he where he is working in this hour god doesn't stop he's working in the year 2021 he's doing something he's accomplishing something but the world will never see it amen what is the message friends you are the message you are the restoration of the bride tree you are god's masterpiece you are christ the mystery of god reveal you're that oddball that's you so don't just recognize the day oh we know it's the end time but don't miss the message christ in you the hope of glory glory be to god if but if you're looking at the storm you don't see the master you don't see the master when you're looking at the storm the disciples we're looking at the great storm looking at the darkness feeling the rocking of the waves and they weren't thinking about who was in the boat hallelujah brother bran preaches a message shalom peace god's peace and he begins to start out there in sierra vista not too far away and he's preaching the message shalom and he begins to talk about the darkness of the world he begins to talk about the sin that's in humanity he begins to talk about the gross dark and he talks about the wickedness of the world and all these things and he stops when he's preaching he says listen now he said now listen i i'm talking about we're talking about the darkness so that we can get to the shalom amen he didn't come amen he didn't come to bring discouragement his message to the to the elect to the church of the living god amen was not to bring our focus on the wickedness of this world on the judgment that's falling but he was bringing us a shalom amen sometimes friends we spend way too much time focusing on the signs of the times looking at the darkness of this world and looking all those things amen problems in the churches and things but but but that's not our message and that's always the way that the word of god comes it has a dual it has a dual effect when the word is revealed into a generation it's a rebuke to the world it's judgment to the world and this message was an indictment to this world but to the bride it's shalom he did not come to judge you he did not come to pass to pass judgment onto you or hold you over hell fire amen you won't bring this bride under lay out of scene rebuke she's not blind she's seen the light glory be to god she has the prince of peace we should have peace we should have a shalom amen brother branham's talking about all this darkness in the world not to bring a discouragement but to bring a contrast that we have a shalom don't you believe that amen oh to get to the shalom we oh you know and so we we we need a revelation need the unveiling of the holy spirit we need god's help to look beyond this veil he's the only one that can open it amen he's the only one that can that can bring and usher us into that holy place where we're cognizant and recognize the presence of god in that shekinah he's the only one that can do it friends and he can do it he has the power to do it he will do it he desires to do it he promised to do it amen and he's doing it amongst our midst you know so it does not behoove the bride of jesus christ to look at our humanity to look at our failures to look at the the problems in our lives and in our churches amen brother branham preached alone and he begins to talk about how god can take creation and he can multiply it amen how he did it many times he took water and he multiplied it to be wine amen he took little loaves and little fishes and and he was able to take that that simple thing and multiply it and that's the kind of god our creator is he's able to take take simplicity take humanity take humility and he can multiply it but in the last days brother branham said he did something a little bit different amen he said in the last days where there is no sign of creation he can speak it into creation anyhow don't miss this now whatever oh it shows that he's the same god that was in the beginning he can create squirrels not not taking something and multiplying it he took nothing and he brought life he brought creation friends he spoke squirrels and so if he can do that brother brahm said he can create whatever he wants to because he's god amen i tell you friends if he can take nothing and make it something surely he can take you or i though we be nothing though he be dust to this world and he can take it and create a life he can create a son of god he can create an invincible army he can create the bride of jesus christ out of nothing and not only create it but then he can take that creation and he can multiply it he can bring things out of your life you never imagined were possible amen he can bring power he can bring the supernatural he can bring healings and miracles and overcoming amen and deliverance he brings all that out of nothing amen so why are we discouraged wondering how we'll get it all together how will how we'll claw our way up to our adoption how we'll ever come to a maturity you don't have to do anything but lay in this light lay under this shalom it will ripen you it will it will dry all the humanity out it will multiply the seed that went into the ground will bring forth a hundredfold because he wants it and he's the creator he's the creator he speaks it into creation anyhow oh brother brandon preach that wonderful message go wake jesus and he begins to tell the people he said what are you anyway he said you're texas clay you're louisiana clay you're nothing amen 16 elements of mud and dust and clay amen is all that we are amen oh but but in that message he makes a wonderful statement he said the very creator that created that dirt created that earth created that clay he said he's riding in that mudship i like that he's riding in that mudship you know that's what you and i are we're nothing every gift every talent that we have he can't even use it amen we have nothing to offer god we have no value we have no intrinsic worth we are nothing but the dust of this world there's nothing that separates you and i from anyone out here under any church or out in this world or any bar stool nothing but dust and clay and dirt but a creator a master a potter can take that and he can shape it friends and he knows how to shape it he knows how to make that mudship he knows the right form he knows the right shape he knows how to bring it amen into the right form and he can make that ship so it won't sink you can't do it the power's not in the clay somebody had to take that clay bring it through pressure bring it through heat and bring it into the right form that's what he's doing hey man in that mud ship i think about i thought about that storm on the sea of galilee in that little ship amen and the disciples are riding there in that ship and just like many of us they didn't understand the situation that we were in how many times have we been through a trial or been through a situation we're just wondering lord what's going on why well why have you why have you brought this upon why why must these things be let this cup pass and how how many times have we been in turmoil and tossed on the waves of the cycle of a christian life amen and and we don't understand the situation amen because according to the disciples they knew it was the messiah but they thought he would bring peace they thought he was going to bring peace not only to that but the whole world they were looking for peace and here they're in the middle of this storm and they're and they're they're fearing that they've come to their end and it's not they're just not going to make that next wave they're not going to survive that next rock amen they just uh uh and so here he's supposed to bring peace but the world wasn't at peace but jesus corrected him amen he said think not that i'm come to send peace on earth i came not to send peace but a sword amen it was a word of separation a word of division waters of separation amen it was not according to their expectation but they were discouraged because they thought it would be all peace they thought everything would be wonderful around the message they thought he preached he preached the opening of the seventh seal and it just fixed all the problems that we had with humanity and amen and uh christ the mystery of god all that he was in christ he poured into the church and now we never disagree and we never fuss and we never have problems and we never get under afflictions and things their expectation was all wrong it was all wrong even the ones who heard his message we you could read right in that script they only heard parables right in that chapter he's preaching things and they're just hearing stories they're hearing apparently it didn't make sense they didn't understand because they had their idea of peace his was different amen so they're crying out just like we cry out master don't you care amen christians get to a place believers sons and daughters of god get to places dark times where we're where we wander where we cry out in times of weakness and unbelief god do you even care am i even called am i even your child did i ever have the holy ghost in the first place these things but it was it was just the wrong understanding amen because they were looking at the wrong thing they were looking at the circumstances looking at the conditions around them they didn't realize there was somebody in that little mud ship amen and all they had to do was go wake him they said master don't you care that we perish he said why are you afraid peace he said peace be still brother braham said you can wake jesus and you don't have to go say oh master master master and scream and cry out and and try to whip him up and try to muster something up or work something up he said no you just go say you just say master just call on him you can wake him amen and then he can speak peace to your storm amen but you've got to wake him up you've got to stop looking you got to stop looking at the conditions long enough amen to look to jesus call on jesus there was not peace in the world but there was peace on that boat i just thought about how my you know they thought he would bring peace to jerusalem he would overthrow the roman empire but there was no peace in jerusalem there was no peace in rome and there was no peace on the sea of galilee but there was peace in the boat oh hallelujah what a picture of a christian life there's no peace in laodicea there's no peace in america there's no peace in the churches there's not much peace around what's called the message of the hour amen but there's peace in this boat amen and there could be peace in your boat hallelujah don't worry when the circumstances don't match your expectations brother branham said they and go awake jesus he said they're trying to control the boat they're trying to they're trying in their own power they're trying to pull on the ropes and and and hang on the sail they're just they're trying to right the ship how many times in our life you know do we do we we really try to take control and get it all back together we we try to make something to happen we try to get brethren together and we try to you know we just try to organize something and achieve something amen and it all and everything ends up breaking brother branstad everything broke water filled the boat everything was falling apart and they were just about to sink and he said it looked like all hope was gone and there they are all troubled and scared he said it was a trouble that they could not remedy anymore and fear set in when they found out they could not remedy it amen and that's where we get afraid friends when we look at issues we look at problems and we look at our things in our life and we're and we say god i can't fix this the best that i do trying my best working my hardest i cannot fix it we cannot remy it we do not have the cure amen and it brings a fear brother brandon begins to go down and go wake jesus and he begins to name all of these troubles and all of these things that we cannot remedy he speaks about natura national troubles he speaks about political turmoil things going on in the nation and all these problems and and the same thing that believers are looking too much to today the problems and the issues and and the politics and looking at those things he said we cannot remedy it amen we're not going to get it fixed he talks about church troubles oh he talks about arguments and fusses and and disagreements and all these things we can't remedy that you and i cannot put god's church together it must be the holy ghost amen he talks about unbelievers make believers people rejecting god's message critics rising up a great falling away everything that the lord prophesied we can't remedy that we can't help it if we could we would he talks about communism he talks about ecumenism amen he talks about worldlyism all of these problems all of these storm clouds all of these things he says we don't have the remedy but don't be afraid amen he said here's what we have we still have the word to bring us out of this he said we've got the bible here and it tells us how to steer this thing amen back to the bible back to its message well what is that message it's christ among us written epistles amen living bibles the word of god living so through you he said that's what we need we can't remedy the rest friends we can't fix all the problems of the world and the churches amen but we still have a message there's still a light there's still peace in the boat christ in you making you a written epistle the message of the hour living and manifested in your individual personal life that's what we need to look to don't look at the storms look at the message amen brother brown takes that written epistles amen he says you know you're written epistles read of all men he said i turn it this way he said in other words you're an epistle that has already been written do you realize if you're a son or daughter of god you may go through trials you may go through hard times but if you were a thought of god in the beginning amen that if now that you have been manifested on this earth that which was a thought has been spoken into you making you part of the spoken word seed amen then if you are the word of god not talking about your flesh now but the word of god in you amen it has an infallibility that is equal and the self-same as this king james bible sitting next to me you will not fail i'm not talking about your humanity i'm talking about a word that is in you which will not return void a prophet said how can he fail he can't lose you he can't lose one of his attributes or he would no longer be god friends it brings peace the prince of peace has sent us a message saying fear not i'm in the boat my word is in you my life is in you that's the message and you become the manifested word of god i'm not talking uh you know i'm not talking out of turn here brother branham said what is the manifestation of this hour it's the word bride he said this time and this place is a promise that's given to her if you think that this message amen uh entered into a hibernation period in 1965 if you don't think god's doing something today you don't think he's raising up a bride you don't think he's calling last seed and filling young people with the holy ghost amen i'm i'm here to to to illuminate you friends amen because god is still writing epistles he's still speaking thoughts amen he's still bringing a message to life and this time and this place is a promised time a promised place and we are walking in the perfect will of god in the middle of a storm in the middle of dark laodicea god has a bride whoo hallelujah amen i know i get a little excited how about you let me be on myself and i'll let you be yourself and we'll have a good time around the word of god amen oh you won't return void amen and you're a pistol that's already been written in other words brother branham said it can't be added to i know that the devil has a whole bunch of footnotes and a whole lot of thing a whole appendix written which he would like to attach to the book of your life how that you failed here and how you went through this trial here and you came out of a certain family situation or a certain church situation or you're dealing with a certain struggle and the devil would like to attach it to that to you but he cannot do it because it's not written it can't it's it's been written friends that's our defense against the devil when he came to jesus amen oh he didn't argue with the devil he didn't he didn't he didn't put his own spin on the facts and bring a new narrative he said it is written and that's the answer to the devil's question you're too late devil to try to pin those things on me too late to try to bring a discouragement too late to point out the turmoil and the church struggles and the national troubles in the darkness of laodicea it's already written it's already spoken i already heard god's message oh hallelujah hallelujah you think about noah tossed on the sea just like those disciples how noah he's there on that boat and and and no doubt without a doubt noah he's sitting there tossed on the sea and the only window that he had was of two above the only visibility the only light that he had was to look up because everything around was darkness and and dung amen and so he's looking up and he's tossed on that sea and without a doubt noah's mind must have been full of turmoil he must have mind battle after mind battle he must have been under fear he must have been under pressure he must have been a worry what if uh what if i what if we just float here for months and months and we never come to land and we just sink and we die and we perish and no doubt noah felt that way but it's not written all that's written is by faith noah that's all it's written friends and all that's been written over this bride is victory the only thing written in this message is overcoming the only thing written for you and i is a rapture amen yes judgment is written for this world it's written over these churches it's written over denominations but it's not written of you you've had a shalom the prince of peace has passed judgment over you with an with a rulership with an authority a headship glory be to god amen all that's written is by faith and all that will be written of you is how your faith overcame layout asia your faith persisted through national turmoil your faith persisted through church troubles your faith uh persisted through personal adversity and trials and tribulations your faith persisted it was never your faith to begin with it's the faith of god within you if you're focused on the problems you'll miss the message you'll miss his presence the creator is in this mudship jesus is in your boat christ the mystery of god is revealed in you we have this treasure in earth and vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us it brings me peace it seems like at the end time brother branham said at this time that the message and messenger both are about broke what a what a statement from a prophet of god end time evangelism he said it seems like at the end time at the end time here's what it seems like at the end time it seems like the message and the messenger are just about broke it looks like satan has tried his best to rim wreck us looks like we're defeated [Laughter] but don't you worry he said you know it's usually at that time when god steps in on the scene of something he's been watching for a long time and it's in those weakest moments when it looks like the true message is just about defeated that's when god steps in and he lets the message and the messenger get to the end of the road and he comes in and he rides the high waves glory be to god friends the creator is in these boats the creator is in this message he's in your ship amen and it might look like you're about to wreck but you're not it might like like there's problems in the message but there's not he knows what he's doing he's at just let him take the helm and he will christ every wave amen i've lived long enough with god even as a young man to know that if it was up to me to hold myself i'd already be gone but there's an anchor friends he's spoken of an acre oh i know people are tossed about but he said there's an anchor and the old ship will hold the waves will never seek her because there's something that hold it sometimes we get in our darkest trials and we get thrown against the chain of that anchor just to find out that it won't break that something's holding you and you can't even hold yourself glory be to god he rides the high waves as christians we often look for peace and all we find is a storm not realizing that peace is with us even in us and never out here not until a time to come not until a son of david rain he said i go to prepare a place for you but i'll not leave you comfortless i won't leave you without peace without hope without security peace i live with you my peace give i unto you not as the world giveth not as the world give you're looking for peace in this world my brother my sister you're looking in the wrong place you're looking in the wrong place but peace is within you life is within you rapture is within you amen it's within you you're carrying it in your little mud ship amen let's give him the helm he said let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid i'm leaving you peace you might be going through your worst trial i don't know the lives of the people here i know that i know it's a tumultuous time i know it's desperate times but you're not alone you're not alone even if it might feel like it brother bran spoke with three hebrew children that felt like they were alone they didn't know they even said look god can bring us out of this but he might not his will will be done they they felt that they're looking at the circumstances and they had no nothing that felt secured to to lean upon they were in a trial fiery trial a test but you find that the fire could only loose them from their bonds the only thing it could serve to do amen was loose them for for somebody who's in the hands of this potter all the fire can do is shape you all it can do is harden you all it can do is bring beauty to your form amen all it can do is bring and what was meant to be their doom becomes their vindication a picture of laodicea amen the storms that are meant to wreck this message wreck our churches wreck the bride of jesus christ all they serve to do is vindicate us why because we're still standing amen tucson tabernacle you're still standing you're still standing for a message you're still carrying it it's still going forward young people are carrying it another generation is carrying it they're carrying it on in their own mudships amen so what is meant to be our doom is only our vindication it only proves that god is with us and so we find peace amen you might be struggling with the lord you might be in your hardest trial god i just can't live the life i can't make it i can't i just can't hold it i can't hold it together god i can't get through this trial i can't go on you feel like jacob wrestling with the lord how he wrestled with that angle he you know what i feel that he was wrestling with was his own insecurities his own complexes his own failures his own the reality of who he was there's jacob just wrestling with the lord feeling unworthy feeling like a fraud and he was right he was a fraud friends amen you feel like i'm just a fake i can't leave this message i'm i backslide i fail i make mistakes you do you are a fraud just like jacob but jacob met the lord amen and he had a name change amen and there was a power in that midst of that struggle that was able to take a fraud take a trickster or a shyster and what do we find in the morning brother branham said a fearless prince and the prince of peace amen is able to take you through the turmoils of your life when you're wrestling not well you're not just wrestling with adversity not just wrestling with layout of seeing darkness and things like that you're wrestling with your own humanity and your own failures and your own insignificance and weakness and frailty and the prince of peace comes and says look you're not known by that name you're not under that identification i spoke a message over you i spoke a new name over you i've married you to myself and now my grace is sufficient for thee and now you can glory in your weakness because all it can do is vindicate who you are vindicate the strength of christ within you oh it brings us peace the prince of peace amen here we're battling with all this lay out of seeing nonsense all this darkness all these politics all these church problems all this negativity that we could be looking at and dealing with and and even in our own churches even amongst the message of the hour we see those denominational spirits trying to get in we see spiritual death coming amongst the people coldness formality all of these things coming in amen but you know brother branham gives a third example he says when you're he said when jesus came and and to the shock of death jesus came even to death but he said when he recovered from the shock of death that's when he was at his strongest friends you can you can kill this bride you can try to bring darkness on her you could try to bring a spiritual death upon her you can bring her under every under every denominational spirit a spiritual death lay out a sea and affliction you can try to bring anything on her you can lock her in a prison you can take away your life amen but one thing you can never do amen is take that resurrection power that's on the inside so let her come even down to death let a young person that's called of god get in such a backslidden condition until they're running away from god as fast as they can if that's elected seed amen they'll come down to the to the to an ultimate spiritual death but a resurrection power on the inside will raise them up amen and stronger than ever before you cannot defeat him he is the prince of peace he has authority he has power amen his will will be done he is he is an ultimate authority he is a sovereign god and he has spoken grace over you and i france amen shall we stand amen he says he said in the end time evangelism it looks like it's pretty weak now for both message and messenger but don't you worry somewhere i don't know how he said but i'm trusting him in that isn't that powerful i don't know how but i'm trusting him he'll come riding in someday don't you worry my brother my sister the prophet said it's always darkest just before the dawn so if you if you're feeling maybe the lord has put it on my heart for you as an individual you feel that you're going through a dark trial maybe your darkest trial your hardest moment maybe you know maybe uh maybe it's challenges in this world and its politics and its economy and those things have impacted you maybe its trouble in the church we know the church is in a transition time and and struggles come from that and uh and it may look dark whatever you're going through may be dark amen but the message has brought us a light it's the rising of the sun it's a new dawn amen and the darkness only makes it brighter amen that thing has not come to wreck you it has come to vindicate you it has come to prove to you that he's in the boat he's in that mudship and that's nothing to do with you and i yeah or what we can do or what we possess or what we have to offer amen it causes me church to just lift up my hands and surrender maybe you would join me say lord take the helm of this boat take control of my life be my prince be my authority be my master speak to my storm o lord the only way i'll make it to the other side is if you step up and captain this ship oh god shall we pray together lord jesus we are your children we are your sons and daughters father but when we begin to look at our humanity and we begin to look at the darkness of laodicea when we look at the challenge and we look at the storms and we look at the clouds we become discouraged god but forgive us for that that's not the right perspective it's not the right narrative god it's not the right revelation it's not the message that you sent us you didn't come to indict us lord but you gave us shalom i pray lord that you would grant that shalom to every life here every every young person every every older one every saint every every believer every backslidden one god every struggling one every discouraged one everyone that's in the battle oh god grant peace not as the world giveth but your peace which passes all our understanding grant it now lord as we just worship you for a few moments in the name of the lord jesus christ hallelujah what are you playing there sister the anchor holds amen the anchor holds though the ship is better [Music] though the sails are torn [Music] i have fallen on my knees as i face [Music] amen the whole christian experience is based on rest hallelujah oh the anchor holes thank you jesus though the ship is battered oh the anchor holds [Music]

hollow of life [Music] you know that you look at yourself so many and i'll times to the same thing and i find no good in this [Music] but if i look at this and see what god said and i'll remind myself how faithful he is how he keeps his word how he never fails [Music] you know he went through the same things that you go through he battled the same way when he's when he sat there or kneeled there at that rock gethsemane and he said father if it be thy will let this pass from me but he said not my will be done but i will so that storm you're going through that battle you're going through that hard time you're going through we would say lord oh let me just get over get past this i don't want to go through it but god said i've seen you on the other side of it already and i've seen the nature and the character that it's going to produce therefore you're going to go through it and that's when we say not my will but i will be done and then on the other side you look back and say thank you lord but you know what it encourages you to give you strength to face the next one to go to the next one the scripture tells us when he said let's get on the ship and go to the other side there were other ships around there it doesn't just say it was the one ship so brother and sister look around for a moment see there's other ships around you today going to the same thing but he's the master of it all
