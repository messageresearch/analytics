turn in our Bibles to James chapter 5. I'm going to start with verse 13. it says this James chapter 5 verse verse 13 it says is any is any among you Afflicted let him pray is any Mary let him sing Psalms is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord in the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man of veileth much may the Lord Jesus add the blessings to the reading of his word you can be seated God bless you all does it feel good to be in the house of the Lord this morning feels good to me we had a we had a nice time of Fellowship on Friday night special thanks sister Angela and brother Jeremy for organizing an event it was it was just a a really nice time of Fellowship we played volleyball I don't know how many people that we had have you told me he was over 40 when I got pizza over 50 people so thanks to everyone for coming out I really enjoyed it I enjoyed the fellowship I um enjoyed playing ball I don't see brother Max here but I've played some basketball with his boys and um the one boy blocked me seven times I counted brother we need to stand aside and talk that's disrespectful oh yeah just such a such a nice time I uh it's good to have brother Lyle and sister Heather back with us I know we recognized you earlier but God bless you brother Jonathan from Zambia my brother good good to see you he's I didn't know it his pastors uh an old friend um brother Ronnie capisha is a servant of the Lord just a great man of God so greet brother Ronnie on behalf of the Tucson Tabernacle sister Eva Eva it's good to have you with us God bless you and then the other sister ever sister ever sit next to her God bless you both God bless and thank you for the visitors I don't see any other visitors but we're thankful to have all of you oh who is this brother oh there you are who is this oh oh yeah brother Matthew I saw over there God bless you my brother good to have you too we met the other other day other night I am you know it's so important that we do gather together you know that's this is you might wonder why why is brother Daniel putting so much emphasis on getting the getting rooms together and getting the people together because because it's strength friends there's strength in unity a church is not a building a church is a unified Body of Christ and it is powerful and we need to we need to go before each other go before the Lord for each other as I read in James we we need to go to battle for each other we need to pray one for another because we're not going to make it on our own we need that's why God gave us each other is is for that strength and when we're praying when we start really praying when we start really getting into the spirit and we start praying one for another it will turn God's eyes to us I remember when Daniel was it was a baby and beholding him and and he'd be talking and and sometimes he would he would grab my face and he'd he'd turn it to me and he'd say Daddy listen to me and I'd be facing he I need something and that's how we are we we'll be praying and and Lord Lord I need something and then sometimes it's like Daddy I need you I need something and then he turns his face and I could never ignore him when he did that he he turns his face to us and he says okay son okay daughter what do you need and then we ask for my daughter for my son for my husband for my wife for a parent whatever it is if we can just get his attention then he'll turn his face to us and he'll he'll hear the devil might get in there and the devil tries to separate us friends he tries to he tries to pull us apart he doesn't want us together he he wants us he wants us separated he there's a there's movements out that that you you shouldn't go to church you can just stay stay home and and either listen to a tape at home or or stream in another service at home but he wants us together he wants us together not just in on Sunday morning but he wants us together like we're trying to do during the week just just fellowshipping with each other there is strength in numbers fellowshipping with each other loving one another and praying one for another and he's there he is there to hear us I remember I was I was just in the lowest time of my life a few years ago and I was just like Lord help me we continue to pray and we pray Lord I need you and then like the little baby grabbing the dad's head and facing I just put my head down on my desk I said Lord get me out of here and he heard me he heard my prayer Psalm 120 says in my distress I crawl I Cried unto the Lord and he heard me what a beautiful beautiful scripture it's happened to so many it's happened to all of us Lord I need you and then all right I hear you my son my daughter I I hear there's I've had quite a few questions over the past couple weeks from different brothers that they're not part of this congregation but just confused and just struggling and and coming coming and saying saying brother Daniel but brother Branham said this over here and then we're doing this over here and then he said this over here and I'm just I'm so confused I don't know what to do then one brother told me he says I'm worldly he says I'm backslidden he says he says my life he says he says all it is he says I'm just confused and then I said brother I said you are putting a man whoever that man may be it may be your pastor it may be whoever it is you are putting a man between you and Christ and if you try to do that of course you're going to be confused when you get on your knees set aside all of these things set aside all of these worries set aside all the confusion and pray to God and don't worry about it and when he answers back listen to him don't say don't don't just throw it out because it doesn't it doesn't match what you think or what you've been taught get on your knees and cry out to God and whenever we put anyone a mother or a father or or a priest or a pastor or anything between us and God it's against the Scriptures it doesn't work go straight to him and that's why all of this confusion and a number just in the past couple of weeks number of people have reached out and so I just don't understand quit trying to figure it out get on your knees have you prayed have you asked God well but I don't understand I don't care if you understand or not just go to him go to our lord Jesus and that is where you will find your answers titled my sermon is the prayer of a believer this morning and as I read in the book of James James is James was a pastor of a church he was a pastor of the church in Jerusalem and as he was writing the these these document he was maybe writing it to those of the 12 tribes that were maybe not at home but he was trying to get the message to them and say listen here is here's what you have to hear is what you need to do and James and loving the people he says in verse 13 chapter 5 he says is any among you afflicted let him pray is any Mary let him sing Psalms is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord and you see that's why many times we will people will come up and brother Aaron especially he will take the the anointing oil and he will anoint the people and we'll pray over them according to this scripture and it's a promise that if we do that that the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if you have committed sins they shall be forgiven him not only will the person be healed of his sickness but he will also be forgiven of his sins and which would you rather have you can have both but we will be forgiven of our sins by something as simple as a prayer brother Jonathan a prayer confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man a veileth much pray fervently the Bible says that when Jesus was in the Garden of Eden I believe it's in Luke Chapter uh end of Luke chapter 22 when Jesus was in The Garden of Gethsemane and he was on his knees and he was praying and and blood and water were coming from him and he was just he was so burdened the Bible says that he fervently prayed he was agonizing over this prayer and he was praying for his people and he even said he even made the statement as he was praying there in the garden he said Lord let this cup pass from me I don't want to go to the cross but then he said but thy will be done imagine if he wouldn't have said that for a while there wouldn't be any salvation but the Son of God said but first Lord I put your will puts your will first we friends we should pray fervently in that same manner that Jesus prayed we should be praying for one another not not for not not necessarily always for yourself we cry out for the Lord and he hears us but that same dedication should be applied to our prayers for each other and our prayers for ourselves how getting on your knees and just saying Lord help brother lion sister Heather as they travel there's more than that help sister so and so because her her daughter her sons out in the world not living right Where is the fervency where is the the the heartfelt desire Lord God help this person that's when as the little boy he turns his dad he said that's when daddy's head turns and it happens then that's that's when that is that is what we have to get to and how many of us are there how many of us am I there I look at my own life and I say Lord I fall short of this what I'm preaching today I do I want more I was one little thing that blessed me so much this morning I was just just in in the apartment there and and uh sister came on my heart I said Lord help this sister and she texted me at that very moment and I hadn't talked with her for a long time but at that very moment right after I had prayed for her the phone rang if a phone dings with the text and it was her I believe it was just the Lord saying pray for my children more pray for them there was a a sister I had met and we talk about prayer warriors let me tell you there are really prayer warriors in this world and all of us should be one of those there was a sister that I met I was in Jeffersonville she lived in West Virginia she had a sister had a rough life she she lived alone she lived way back in the hills of West Virginia all by herself she was in her upper 80s and she had her family was was just wayward and she had she really she had had no one her name was Sister Jarvis Josephine Jarvis was her name so it might be some here that know who she is she uh didn't know her parents she's orphaned as a child she grew up in an orphanage she got polio and got crippled in her leg and she had to walk sideways as a little girl sweet lady and it was and and as she was as she was growing up she always wanted to to be athletic and play like the other kids and she wanted a set of roller skates since this was in the depression she had it hard and she prayed Lord Lord I I need this and she's living there she has no siblings she's by herself and the teacher her daughter or son or whoever it was had grown out of a pair of roller skates and she tells the class she says we're going to have a contest a coloring contest and whoever wins this contest is going to get these skates so sister Jarvis you know the little girl she practiced coloring and practiced and she made the most beautiful picture coloring and she won the contest but they didn't give her the roller skates because she was crippled and she said it just devastated me she wanted to be like the other kids so when the kids would go roller skating sometimes she was able to buy to borrow one of her friends skates just one because the one leg was crippled I believe it's her left leg was crippled and she would she would put the roller skate on the one leg and she was able to skate around and she sounds like she was athletic she was able to to do everything that the other kids could do she ended up crippled as she was she ended up playing softball with with the friends and she said she she says I was good brother Daniel foreign the lord gave first gave her courage she grew up she married an awful man he he he mistreated her and and he would just he brought her to Phoenix one day they were there they were traveling across the country he brought her to Phoenix dropped her off and left her her and her child just left her didn't say anything she was able to find this man there was a church there she found this man named brother outlaw have you heard of brother outlaw she found this man she found this church he took her in he helped her out and then she got introduced to this other man well she was there named William Branham wow this man's got something special so she as time goes on her husband a a smile because she smiled when she said it she said he came back and and found her again and brought her back to West Virginia and he said she said she used to he used to beat her and he said she said one time the spirit of the Lord came over me when he was going to beater and she said she started speaking in tongues and scared the liver out of him and he never beat her from that time on the Lord just taking care of his his daughter the reason I'm talking about sister Jarvis is because that lady prayed she was oh brother could you put the picture up there I'm sorry that uh um she prayed and she knew how to talk to God because she had gone through it so she um a few of the brothers and I went over to help her out I think she wrote in a letter on email I don't remember how she contacted us but she was asking for for prayer or help for her son who was in Florida was a sinner and so I started corresponding with this lady I gave her a call and she uh I was talking I said wow there's something special about this sister Jarvis she's got it she has something that I want there she is right there in her house and so she I said sister I said is there anything we can do for you she said well I don't have any she says well they haven't wrapped if you see in the corner there you see some plastic and what they would what a brother from Ohio who knew her would do is he would show up in the winter and wrap her whole house in plastic on the outside so the draft wouldn't come in she was poor so we we went there and she she was telling us about some of the things that had happened to her and she was telling me about the her husband and and about these testimonies and she uh she says well you know she says I was in Washington DC when brother Branham preached the Deep cloth to the Deep she says I was there at Centennial Hall I think it was Centennial Hall was the name of the place I said really she says yeah she says I was sitting up in the balcony and during the Deep calls to the Deep brother Branham calls out a lady that was up in the balcony he said she said she had like a a hair wrap on her hair and and she had a jar there and she says I was looking at that jar and brother Branham said that's the lady that yesterday yesterday had cancer and that cancer had fallen off and she put it in a jar of alcohol and brought it to the next service completely here assistant driver said I saw that that's what the prayer does and we think it we look at brother Branham and and these things that had happened these these great Miracles that have happened look at the scripture I just read the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man that is what did it Miracle after Miracle after miracle healing after healing after healing fervent prayer their sister Jarvis she said I saw it there was that the bottle there and and that and she said she was she would just pray for people all the time and I started after I went to visit her she made such an impression on me that I started researching this lady Josephine Jarvis she has led many families to the Lord Jesus families that you would know if I said and I don't see any relation in here now but families that you would know if I would say them um some of the Phillips Family David Phillips there's there's sister Jarvis there and Brother Sam borders he cuts his hair like I do um brother Chad Vaughn there's sister Jarvis right in the middle um and others that that lady because of just her testimony living in the middle of nowhere in the hills of West Virginia LED these people to the Lord one of them one of the people she led he was working on the gas lines and this little old lady she you know she's hobbling she's she it sounds like when she walks it's a mechanical sound it goes like she can't precious and she's like that tall and you know maybe a hundred pounds she is just absolutely the sweetest thing in the world and and she would walk and and when we were there she she said brother Daniel I didn't have anything really left we uh it's been snowing so the neighbors hadn't been able to take me to to town she said but I had a turkey in the freezer that's all I had and I made it and she fed us that turkey it's good so we were able to fill our covered coverage with food and and help of the house and put some insulation in there and we became friends me and this little old lady and she would call me and tell me that she was praying for this person or that person and they would get healed and like I said LED I mean besides maybe some ministers that I know more people to the Lord than anyone I've ever met that little lady right there one day she called me like I said she's about 90. by the time she called me this at this time and she said brother Daniel she said I need you to pray for me she said I I went to the doctor had some pain and she says I have they said I have cancer all through my organs and I said I said okay sister I said I said I'll pray for you and and she said and I prayed for her just a simple prayer Lord Jesus I pray that you have mercy on my sister and she said okay thank you I'm Healed okay you know it's that's good I prayed for a lot of people I've seen people get healed and many haven't but I've never had that type of response I'm Healed I said okay so didn't hear for her from remember from a little while and and a caller and she's still kicking and uh oh God bless you brother Daniel how are you feeling oh I feel good I feel good no pain at all she says I can't go to the doctors because she said it's it's too big of a of a an effort to get my neighbors to drive me to to the to get treatment so I couldn't have treatment she said that's why I asked you to pray for me she said I would have gone but I couldn't I couldn't get away to get over there she said so I just called you to pray for me I feel good praise the Lord good wow that's the way it should work years go by like two years staying in touch with sister Jarvis I call her how you feeling I feel good praise the Lord Brother I listen to this tape read this read this scripture I just bro Daniel I'm always praying for you and your little wife and your little family God bless you all I'm thinking I know where she lives praying fervently so she went to the doctor after after that a couple years after we had prayed and the doctor didn't expect her to be alive because he had told her before that you only have a couple months to live maybe not even that long if you don't get treatment if you get treatment so she went back after a few years and the doctor examined her went through the scan or whatever it was and said I can't explain it he said the cancer is still there but it hasn't grown at all in fact he says it's smaller than it was years ago he says this is one of the most aggressive types of cancer he says I can't explain it but all I know is it's still there the sister Jarvis said it's okay went on and and that I don't know she was about 94 95 years old see finally the Lord took her not too many years ago but I saw sister Jarvis as a genuine servant of God someone that prayed and God heard her prayer she knew how to do it she was in that home all day every day and she showed me she says here's why I pray she says but when I'm sore and I can't move around she says and she showed me a chair over here she says I pray in this chair and she says I just pray for the people all day and I just cry out to the Lord and she told me this she says you know one day she said you know she didn't have anybody in her family any of her ancestors she didn't know anyone in her family was a sinner she was by herself and she said you know brother Daniel she says one day I just expect a here knock at the door and she said I expect to go up there and open the door and she says you know in the Bible it says that the dead in Christ shall rise first and those of us that are alive and remain will be caught up together with them she said I just expect one day and like I said she didn't have anybody in her family really she didn't have Rod over the other side she didn't like me I didn't have not my dad or my mom anybody she didn't know anybody none of her family she said I expect to go to that door one day and open it up and there would be brother Branham say good morning friend it's time to go home and she said you know she said it may not happen that way but she said these beautiful words she said but it's just a wonderful thought I thought amen that's the right attitude whether it happens that way or not it will far exceed whatever she was hoping for sister Jarvis was a precious sister but she was a human being verse number 17. in James chapter 5. it says Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the Earth by the space of three years and six months notice that right after James says that the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man he says Elijah was somebody just like us and he struggled with the same things we struggle with you know I I say it a lot that don't think you're special and the same thing James is saying right here about the Prophet Elijah he said he was like we are yet he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the Earth by the space of three years and six months like sister Jarvis like you and me if we will be sincere when we pray then God will hear these prayers I've heard so often and it's it's a mischaracterization of the word I've heard so often that when brother Branham had that experience with the angel at tunnel Mill in Jeffersonville when the angel came to him and gave his commission to go and pray for the sick you know what we just heard the tape not too long ago how the angel came to me in his Commission I have heard that brother branham's commission was to get the people to believe you that is not what the angel said the angel said if you can get the people to believe you if you can get the people to believe you and be sincere when you pray then nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer he was talking about Divine Healing and it happened and let me tell you if anyone proved that the effectual fervent forever righteous man Avail as much it was William Branham thousands of people coming through the prayer lines there's people alive today that were healed in his meetings shows that God's word is true and he Elijah prayed again and Heaven and the heaven gave rain and the Earth brought forth her fruit James is encouraging us to pray and have faith in our prayers that God hears us and he's saying that this Elijah one of the greatest prophets That Ever Walked this Earth he was a man just like we are we we pray for each other but how many of us are praying like this word says you know we get down on our knees and and like brother Aaron's been sick you're down on on my knees and and I'm I try to when when I pray in the morning I have a picture in my mind of the congregation and I go row by row and I start here so sister Shirley Yoon brother Jeremy and sister Angela you usually the first ones that I pray for but I go row by row and I try to call everyone's name out and then I'll go to this one and I'll I'll go through that just from my memory and go over here and and talking and just mentioning everyone's name before the Lord and I believe that's right but there has to come a point when there is a need in the church that we have to go before the Lord with the same Earnest prayer like we are dying that we have to have this Lord this is everything you have Lord Lord we need this this person's crying out it may be a son or a daughter maybe someone that's fallen into sin but Lord this this family saved this young man this young woman Lord I just feel for what was it what if that was my Daniel what if that was my son and we get in we get into that suffering and and we cry out to the Lord and then something happens that face of God turns and he says I heard you and it happened to me it's happened to me a few times in my life and I said oh God you heard me and then he would he provided not necessarily what I was asking for but he provided what was right because he knew my heart my heart was not necessarily to get what I wanted when we pray that way many times that's why we don't get our prayers answered you have to ask ourselves Lord is this what I want or is this your will I believe it's Romans chapter 8 said that the the spirit itself makes intercessions with things that cannot even be uttered for when that Holy Spirit is speaking through us that's when we are in that channel I think about that's the way that we need to be for each other we need to have such love for each other that it's the same as if it was my son or my daughter pray one for another and uh one more when we're praying we're down on our knees Lord I I am short on money this month Lord I I need this Lord I need that I can't afford my Netflix bill they just went up can't afford my cable bill I can't I can't afford the car you know I can't put I'm having all these troubles and uh and help brother Island sister Heather in Jesus name amen I don't know if he hears those prayers because they're not as sincere as they should be we need to get down if there is someone that's suffering it needs to be a fervent prayer in Acts chapter 12. we see a wonderful example James was killed by Herod and Herod saw that ah this pleased the Jews yeah we can make some inroads here and he he says well if James is killed then let me go get the other leader let me go get this guy named Peter and then that'll really please these Jews so here it goes and he has Peter arrested and he's put in prison and he's put in there and he he was so tightly locked down that there was two guards laying beside him on either side and he was in Chains there was no way this guy could get out and it says here verse 5. Peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him why is this Tucson Tabernacle any different than the church at Jerusalem it's the same God am I right it's the same one that we're praying to that they prayed to 2000 years ago am I right it's the same God that was with Adam in the Garden of Eden am I right it's the same God so why can we not pray to that same God just as they prayed we can prayer without ceasing this Earnest prayer and what happened was an angel walked into the prison and says hey Peter wake up change fell off he says hurry up we got to get out of here Peter's like I'm seeing a vision this can't happen so it gets up and he's following the angel and there's light this light comes in the room Peter's walking out he gets out out of the prison he gets out on the street whoa that was real that wasn't a dream that wasn't a vision this really just happened you can read it in Acts chapter chapter 12. it's right there so then Peter is like well I know where to go so he goes to Mary's house and that is where the church was praying for Peter so he goes there and and he knocks on the door let's read let's read verse 12. oh we can go I'll read 12s keep it on 13 there and and when he had considered the thing he came to the house of Mary the mother of John whose surname was Mark where many were gathered together praying and as I said there is something about praying together Brethren if you could check the Stream I don't know if it went off there is something about praying together and everywhere in the Bible there is strength in unity and we see that that they were together praying so Peter walks up to the door and this little lady named Rhoda she's like I'll get it she goes up whoa that's Peter and she leaves the door closed she goes and she said hey Peter's here and you know what they said yeah right what a strange situation they've just been praying without ceasing and when God answered the prayer oh yeah right sure well she's like no really and then finally she convinced somebody probably to go back and Peter's still waiting at the door he's like what's going on I'm home I'm out here on the street so finally they let him in and they're like wow this is this is just this is amazing in fact they they told they told Rhoda they said you're crazy for thinking this verse 16 but Peter continued knocking and when they had opened the door and they saw him they were astonished but he beckoned unto them with the hand to hold their peace and declare it unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison and he said go show these things into James and the bro and to the Brethren and depart and they and he Departed and he went to another place prayer was made I met a brother years ago he's he's a Congolese brother he he lives in Congo missionary always witnessing and miracles followed his ministry his name brother shebango brother shebango he's he has a burden to go to the pygmy people in central Congo and he's praying for these people he wanted to introduce them to the living Jesus Christ and he said Lord he says I want to preach to them he says but I don't speak their language the pygmy language and he says I don't know what to do I don't know how to find a translator and he asked the Lord he said Lord help me he says provide a translator whatever it is I have need of Lord if you want me to go then provide someone to help me preach and this trip was way up from uh from kissing you have to you have to go up in the river and and hike in and and it's just it's a horrible trip very dangerous trip so they get in there and he's he says Lord I'm gonna pray I'm gonna fast about this I feel led to fast fasted seven days asking the Lord to provide something that would help him preach to these pygmy people seven days passed he got hungry and he said Lord I'm hungry I'm going to eat so he fixes himself a nice meal and he he sits down to his meal and he bows to pray and he begins speaking in the pygmy language fluently and to this day he is fluent in that pygmy language and preaching the gospel to the pygmies led many of them to the Lord Jesus a miracle yeah you can clap praise God for that it shows that God answers prayer you know and and the biggest thing with this brother the burden wasn't for himself it was a legitimate cause there was a let's let's turn to Matthew chapter 18. I want to read this it's Jesus talking he makes he makes a simple little statement here in Matthew 18 18 He says verily I say unto you whatsoever you shall bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven again I say unto you if two of you shall agree on Earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven what a promise from our lord Jesus verse 20 says for where two or three are gathered in my name there I am in the midst of them we need that at our church and at every Church in this world that is one day and it has to start somewhere it has to start with prayer and I was and the Lord he turns He he'll just turn his head sometimes I was preaching last Sunday morning let's get you to go to church I was preaching last Sunday morning and we were I was ministering about about the Revival and about Asbury and and how the Lord is moving there among those people and who are we to judge if that's God or not I've heard from from different Minister Brothers saying oh well that's the foolish that's the foolish virgin and and and they're going to find they're gonna they're gonna find that they don't have oil and all this no no no no no no no no my Jesus said judge not that you be not judged if God is moving there Maybe we are the foolish ones how foolish can we be in trying to judge someone else and say that's not God we're better than that they are praying all night long and I was talking about that and I said this I said I said something on the order of I think that God is going to give a Revival here in this Tucson Tabernacle you remember and the light started going on and off you remember that last week well what happened the live stream stopped so so the people on the other end they didn't get to see that it was a power surge or so it was a power surge is what it was it they came in and if if we weren't here then we would miss those things we need to be together and I know we have to sometimes we can't and sometimes we have to miss and I know the Lord understands that but there needs to be more and more and more going on in the church to where we don't want to miss it I uh I look at Ezekiel chapter nine and it's a famous scripture we can all Quote it by heart and it says this and it says I'll read it chapter uh yeah verse 3. and the glory of the glory of the god of Israel was gone up from the Cherub where he where upon whereupon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the writer's inkhorn by his side and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for the Abominations that be done in the midst thereof and to the others he said in my hearing go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eyes spare neither have ye pity slay utterly old and young both maids and little children and women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at My Sanctuary start right here in church that judgment will start right here then they began um the ancient men they began at the ancient men which were before the house think about that I think about Lord I am falling so short in my prayer life I'm praying for the people but Lord that fervency that I've seen that sister Jarvis had I need something more there has to be something something more happened to me I Lord I need it I I need I just want to just grab your holy holy faces as my son did and say Lord Jesus hear me I need you and then cry out for the others it and there's there's a prayer that I wanted to read a beautiful prayer from a man of God named Paul in Ephesians chapter 3. listen to the way that Paul prays for the people he says for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ here he is in heaven of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with the might by his spirit in the Inner Man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and the length and the depth and the height and to know the love of Christ which passes all knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God think about the Holy Spirit and being filled with that now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in US unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all the ages world without throughout all the ages World Without End amen is what our brother prayed how many of us pray like that we have to we have to spend the time we have to do our best when someone walks into this church When a Stranger Comes into this church what are they searching for are they searching for a preacher I can blow you away with this intellect that can take this book and and tie this scripture in with that scripture and go back to the Greek and say Well it means this and and then well the Old Testament it would go to the Hebrew here and the Aramaic here and here's what it actually means you think they're looking for that or do you think they're looking for for someone that has a good sense of humor that can entertain them that can make them laugh that has some Charisma that could keep their attention you think they're looking for that if they're sincere or do you think they're looking for someone who has a true relationship with God do you think they're looking for someone that I can tell that man has been in prayer I can tell that he's been with Jesus that is the one I want to pray for me when they walk into this congregation and they come amongst these people they and they look at all of us and they say I want to be like them they have a relationship with Christ that I don't have that's the way I want to be I want to be part of them because they know God and I want to know God is that what people want to want when they come in that's what we have to offer that's what we need to offer that's what we have to get to the point that we have that to offer you're sick come here on anoint you with oil and you'll be healed because it says it here in the word you know you have problems with your family or whatever we'll pray we'll pray without ceasing and they'll be fine because we bring it before the Lord I mentioned one time this uh Zachariah was his name John the Baptist's Daddy the angel Gabriel comes to Zachariah and he says this this is before John the Baptist was born he's going to make him a promise that he's going to have a son he says Zechariah he says God has heard your prayer you're going to have a son Zachariah says how can this be I'm old my wife is old we can't have children that time's passed a long time ago it doesn't make sense does it why would Zechariah have prayed we know he prayed because the angel said he prayed God heard your prayers Zachariah and he says well I'm too old wait a minute and he says you know what he says you're not going to be able to speak he says until you have that baby call him John very odd thing that happened you know why it happened because God heard zechariah's prayer and he may have been a young man it may have been 50 years ago that he prayed that so when you pray something for your family or you ask the Lord something you place it there and then you have faith that he is able when you are praying when you're asking the Lord and you feel that spirit and that is the holy spirit speaking you leave it there and you know it's going to happen and it happened to Zechariah the minister of the gospel and he didn't he couldn't believe it just like they couldn't believe it when Peter knocked at the door yet they had been praying for the same thing Zechariah and his wife had prayed for this God answered their prayer don't get ever no don't get discouraged if you prayed for something and it doesn't happen right away if you had the right Spirit God heard your prayers he knows I was praying about this church a couple months ago I said Lord I I don't know do you want me to to be the pastor do you want me to to help in some way Lord what do you want and I kept asking him and asking Lord I don't know I don't know and he answered me you know what he said he said I heard you that was good enough for me that was good enough for me he didn't tell me what was going to happen he doesn't have to tell me what was going to happen he said I heard you Lord you know about it I God by the wow God is face and he looked down at me I heard you son I know and his will would be done sisters if you come brother Matt put Matthew chapter 6 up oh no brother here Lord and I've said this many times Lord I don't know how to pray I hear about all these these these great Miracles I hear about maybe sister Jarvis brother sebangu these different ones how the Lord answered their prayer but how Lord how do I do it same question was on the disciples hearts they asked him and he said he said I'll teach you how to pray they asked him teach me how to pray he said I'll teach you how to pray he said pray like this he said our father all of our father brother Jonathan all of our father that includes all of these anointed all of these anointed or not all of these chosen of God people that are called to be Christians every single one of us our father I serve the same God that these people at Asbury serve he's our father I serve the same God that sent that angel to get Peter out of the prison Our Father Who Art in Heaven Hallowed be thy name oh God you're the greatest you're wonderful you are the creator of all things you created the universe you you've done all these you did the Miracles you part of the Red Sea you set Adam and Eve on the earth Lord you've done it all Hallowed be thy name you sent your son to Die For Me Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done Lord not my kingdom not for me but your will in my life let it be done because my will will fail and it will turn out wrong but Lord if I could just find your will thy will be done the same as Jesus prayed to the Garden of Gethsemane [Music] well we're as it is up there where you are now in heaven Lord because I want to make it there let it be done here give us this day Our Daily Bread Lord I Need to survive in this world we live in this world Lord there's certain things that I need I don't need anymore but just give me what I need just give me Lord just just provide for me [Music] and forgive us of our debts our trespasses [Music] Lord forgive me for my sins forgive me for everything that I've done and I've done so much and it seems like I just keep stacking them up and stacking them up Lord forgive me of my sins as I forgive those that sin against me how much more for those of us that maybe have a tough time forgiving how much more have I done to God that has anyone done to me how many times have I forsaken him how many times have I let him down how many times have I sinned against him and then I'm not going to forgive someone for whatever they do to me forgive me in my debts forgiving in my sins forgive me my trespasses as I forgive those that trespass against me [Music] and Lord lead us not ation the world is so full of it everywhere I turn there is sin Lord protect me from the sin protect my family protect us Lord from this sin because it is around and it's coming Lord protect us and this Satan is going forth as a roaring lion Lord protect us and Deliver Us from this evil Lord I want to be there for thine Lord yours is the kingdom not mine yours is the kingdom and the power I know you have the power you have the power to do whatever Lord if I can just get you to turn to me the power of God and the glory forever and then he ends up with amen that's how we should pray and we should pray it fervently Lord fervently to all for all if it's our family if it's whatever it is Lord I come before you in the name of your son Jesus Christ thy will be done as it is here as it is in heaven and if we can just have that oh and all will be well let's stand [Music] pray more [Music] and not just not just say Lord bless this person Lord bless that person but fervently get down and pray like
