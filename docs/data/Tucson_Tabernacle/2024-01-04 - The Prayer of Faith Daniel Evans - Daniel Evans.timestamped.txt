[42:00] there's already a
[42:01] theme started for this service and
[42:05] there's already a
[42:07] spirit and and what the what the Lord
[42:09] has already done so far and when brother
[42:14] Jordan when he read The Lord's Prayer at
[42:18] the
[42:19] beginning I was this morning I was up
[42:23] early and I was going through my sermon
[42:25] and I saying it's too long I got I got
[42:28] too many notes I have too many
[42:31] scriptures and um one the ones that I
[42:34] took out as I really wanted to say the
[42:37] Lord's Prayer with the people but God
[42:40] wanted it said and I'm so thankful I'm
[42:43] so thankful that that he knows our heart
[42:48] and he knows that even though that we
[42:50] might make a mistake and we might fall
[42:52] short he knows that he knows our hearts
[42:54] are right and he knows his will and he
[42:57] knows what's best for us is his will so
[43:02] he's going to have his will done with a
[43:05] willing heart so I could take that out
[43:08] and he says no I want my prayer read I
[43:13] want it said among the people so I'm
[43:15] gonna have brother Jordan do it what a
[43:18] what a what a blessing he's he's just
[43:20] he's so
[43:22] good and brother Kevin and what he was
[43:25] saying when he he was
[43:27] praying it just it just blessed my heart
[43:31] it blessed my heart to to see that we
[43:32] have these prayer
[43:34] requests and and I look and there's some
[43:36] very difficult things pancreatic cancer
[43:38] I believe was one of them that was said
[43:41] it's
[43:42] it's a a terminal
[43:46] disease and I
[43:48] was praying with the congregation about
[43:51] these things and how blessed we are to
[43:54] be able to pray
[43:56] and God takes these
[43:59] trials in his kindness and he puts them
[44:03] Upon Our upon us so that we would go
[44:06] back to
[44:08] him I think that when we
[44:13] stray is when things are going well when
[44:17] things are going good and and and we
[44:19] don't have any problems in our lives and
[44:21] there's no hardships that's when things
[44:24] it seems like that's when we stray from
[44:26] God and we don't pray as much we don't
[44:30] read his Bible as much we don't wen't
[44:33] constantly talking to him when things
[44:35] are going easy and that's the that's the
[44:37] age that we live in it's an easy
[44:41] age we have air conditioning we have
[44:45] vehicles we have all of these things
[44:48] that make life so easy on us and it
[44:52] makes us to where we don't ask God we
[44:55] don't have a need
[44:56] this Leo toan
[44:58] age it says they have need of nothing
[45:01] and that's where we live today and it's
[45:04] a blessing to have a need it's a
[45:07] blessing to go before the Lord and the
[45:09] Lord will send those hardships he'll
[45:11] allow those hardships to come so we will
[45:13] reach out to him because he knows that
[45:16] we will do best his children are the
[45:18] best when they are fellowshipping with
[45:21] God we have communion service
[45:24] tonight and
[45:28] it's not only fellowship with our lord
[45:31] Jesus as it was in John when when Jesus
[45:35] broke the bread and he said this is my
[45:38] body and took the wine and he says this
[45:41] is my blood do this in remembrance of me
[45:43] it wasn't just fellowship with Jesus it
[45:47] was also fellowship with the disciples
[45:49] it was fellowship with each
[45:50] other and that's what we get to do is
[45:54] tonight we'll get to break break that
[45:56] bread and partake of the ordinances that
[45:59] God set before us with each other and
[46:02] it's very very important that we are
[46:04] with each other and with loved ones and
[46:07] we have that that fellowship and that
[46:10] communion and that Unity how how
[46:14] important that is it seems like when
[46:18] people when they get closest to God is
[46:20] when they reach Rock
[46:22] Bottom it's when they're forced to ask
[46:26] God for help and we don't realize that
[46:30] these tragedies become a
[46:32] blessing couple thousand years of three
[46:34] three 3,500 years ago whatever it was
[46:37] there was a man named amram that he was
[46:40] in bondage the King was killing the
[46:44] children amram got on his knees and he
[46:47] cried out to
[46:49] God God said I've heard the cries of my
[46:54] people and he sent a deliverer named
[46:57] Moses we started in the Book of Judges
[47:00] this week and we see that when the
[47:02] people when things get easy they start
[47:04] to sin and they lose track of what God
[47:07] is and they fall into idolatry and then
[47:09] they fall into sin and then the enemy
[47:12] comes in and takes over their lives and
[47:14] then they cry out to God and yet God
[47:16] still hears them even in the worst of
[47:20] the sins how precious is our Lord that
[47:24] he'll even listen to us even when we're
[47:26] in our sins he sends when he he'll send
[47:31] anneal and Gideon and Samson and and
[47:33] Deborah and all of these different
[47:34] judges to help bring the people out and
[47:38] then we go right back into it when
[47:40] things get
[47:41] easy he
[47:43] sent Nebuchadnezzar the king to pull
[47:47] these Hebrews out of Jerusalem and out
[47:50] of their Homeland because they stopped
[47:53] calling upon God he he brought them out
[47:56] and he brought them into into bondage
[47:59] and then there was a man named Daniel
[48:00] that prayed three times a day God heard
[48:04] his
[48:05] prayer same thing with Herod we
[48:08] see Herod was there and he started
[48:11] killing the children and and persecuting
[48:14] the people the Bible
[48:16] says that a cry went out of Jacob a cry
[48:21] went out of Israel and God heard that
[48:25] cry no matter how bad that they
[48:29] were he promised in a time to come that
[48:33] he's going to send a tribulation upon
[48:35] the Earth he's going to send suffering
[48:37] and we always think about that suffering
[48:39] as something as a as the wrath of God
[48:41] but do you think maybe it could be the
[48:43] kindness of God that God will send
[48:46] suffering and
[48:48] tribulation and problems because he
[48:51] loves us because he loves the world he
[48:54] so loved the world that he gave his only
[48:57] begotten son Jesus
[48:59] Christ and these trials and tribulations
[49:02] and even the tribulation the Great
[49:03] Tribulation it is to come it's out of
[49:05] the kindness of God it's not it's not
[49:08] out of the harshness or the Wrath the
[49:10] Bible says that God is
[49:12] love so everything that God does he does
[49:16] through
[49:18] love I've been as as many of you have
[49:22] been in the lowest point of my life is
[49:27] when it felt like God spoke to me the
[49:30] most it's when we get all worked up and
[49:32] there's all this this problems and we
[49:35] get all confused and we don't know what
[49:36] we're going to do and and then we cry
[49:38] out to God and he
[49:41] listens I
[49:44] remember the hardest times of my life I
[49:48] didn't know it seemed like everything
[49:50] had failed in my life everything from
[49:55] from from my career to to my church to
[49:59] even my very it seemed like my religion
[50:02] my thoughts on God were even failing and
[50:04] I didn't know what to do and I was out
[50:06] in the mountains and I looked up at
[50:10] night and I saw all the stars in the
[50:14] sky it wasn't a moon I saw all the
[50:17] different colors in the Milky Way and it
[50:19] went all the way down the stars went
[50:21] down to the Horizon just everywhere and
[50:23] I looked up and I said
[50:26] God I'm worried about all this I said'
[50:30] I'm not even really a Christian I said I
[50:33] I'm a big fake is what I am to think
[50:38] that you created all of
[50:42] this and I doubt
[50:45] you I doubt that you know me I doubt
[50:48] that you can't take care of these little
[50:51] problems that I
[50:53] have and I thought
[50:56] comes to me that scripture we just
[50:59] read God says be
[51:03] still and know that I'm
[51:06] God he said just trust
[51:09] me and that's what I want us to do and
[51:12] that's what I want to talk about
[51:15] today is prayer of faith is praying to
[51:20] God and then having confidence that he
[51:22] is able to do it there's a testimony
[51:25] when Jesus was here Matthew chapter 28 I
[51:28] mean I'm sorry Matthew chapter 9: 28
[51:31] there was these Blind Men and they had
[51:34] heard that there was this man this
[51:37] prophet of God that could heal the
[51:40] sick these two men were
[51:43] blind they came to Jesus and they said
[51:48] this they
[51:52] said and when he was come into the house
[51:56] the Blind Men came to him and Jesus said
[51:59] unto
[52:00] them believe ye that I am able to do
[52:04] this these men were crying out in verse
[52:06] 27 it says the two Blind Men following
[52:09] following him cried out saying thou son
[52:11] of David have mercy on us and then Jesus
[52:14] responds says do you believe I'm able to
[52:17] do this what a
[52:20] question I just I I love that because we
[52:23] get so caught up in our ways of thinking
[52:25] that we don't think is he even able to
[52:28] do this was he able to create all the
[52:31] heavens and the
[52:36] earth I stood under those stars and and
[52:39] I looked at those stars and I see
[52:40] everything moving in Perfect Harmony and
[52:44] and and no star is is any greater really
[52:47] than any other some get some are
[52:49] brighter C certain times of year then
[52:51] they fade out and everything is just
[52:53] moving in perfect time
[52:55] Harmony and then this same God that put
[52:59] everything there came to Earth and he
[53:02] touched their
[53:04] eyes and saying according to your faith
[53:08] be it unto you and their eyes were open
[53:10] and Jesus straightly charged them saying
[53:12] that see that they'll tell see that no
[53:15] man know
[53:16] it God has a way of doing things and
[53:19] it's his way it's not our way it doesn't
[53:23] matter if it makes sense to us
[53:25] we always want to put him in a box and
[53:27] sayl you have to do it my way you have
[53:30] to do it according to the way I think
[53:32] but if we would just one time step back
[53:35] and look at all of he has created and
[53:37] all that he's done and just have faith
[53:40] in
[53:41] him then we would do well Psalm 120 says
[53:44] this in my distress I Cried unto the
[53:47] Lord and he heard
[53:50] me what a statement in my distress I
[53:53] Cried unto the Lord and he heard me
[53:55] deliver my soul oh Lord from lying lips
[53:57] and from a deceitful tongue it wasn't
[53:59] just death that the psalmist was facing
[54:02] there it was
[54:04] people same thing that we suffer with
[54:07] sometimes people talking about us or
[54:09] little infighting or little problems
[54:11] that we get among a family or among
[54:13] friends or or among gossiping or or
[54:15] whatever it was that that he's saying
[54:18] here deliver my soul from lying lips and
[54:20] a deceitful tongue it wasn't Goliath
[54:24] this time
[54:25] it was just a little thing that just got
[54:28] him worked
[54:30] up and he cried to the
[54:32] Lord and he heard
[54:35] him how precious is our Lord how how
[54:40] beautiful are as words and he says be
[54:45] still and know that I'm God I was
[54:47] thinking this
[54:50] morning the sun it it was it was cloudy
[54:53] but it it started to to get
[54:57] light and what a great miracle that
[55:01] happens every day as this sun comes up
[55:06] we know it's going to happen we have
[55:08] faith that it's going to happen it comes
[55:10] up the Bible says Be Still did you ever
[55:14] hear the
[55:16] sunrise all the power that's associated
[55:19] with all of gravity and all of the
[55:21] universe moving around and that great
[55:24] power and yet it's
[55:27] quiet and at night do you hear the Stars
[55:30] moving across the
[55:32] sky no just be still know that I'm God
[55:37] have
[55:38] faith in him James chapter 5 let's get
[55:42] into our scriptures
[55:45] here James says this verse
[55:51] 13 he says is any among you
[55:54] afflicted
[55:55] let him
[55:56] pray is any marry let him sing
[56:00] Psalms he says here whether what he's
[56:03] saying is whether you're suffering or
[56:06] you're
[56:07] blessed cry out to God in both
[56:10] situations is any Afflicted cry to God
[56:14] is any marry still cry out to him give
[56:17] him Praises for the good things always
[56:19] give him Praises for the good things and
[56:21] then it's okay to cry out to him for the
[56:23] things that we need
[56:25] is any sick among
[56:27] you let him call for the Elders of the
[56:29] church and let them pray over him
[56:31] anointing him with oil in the name of
[56:33] the Lord and the prayer of faith shall
[56:37] save the
[56:38] sick and the Lord shall raise him up and
[56:42] if you have committed sins they shall be
[56:44] forgiven
[56:48] him look it not every not every prayer
[56:52] accomplishes what we think it's going to
[56:54] C accomplish look at all that the prayer
[56:57] does in just this scripture not only
[56:59] does it save the
[57:01] sick but it also redeems The Sinner what
[57:05] a what a much greater thing than praying
[57:08] for the
[57:09] sick confess your faults one to another
[57:13] and pray one for another that you may be
[57:15] healed the effectual fervent prayer of a
[57:19] righteous man availeth much look at the
[57:23] kindness of God towards his children he
[57:25] wants us
[57:26] confessing that we were wrong especially
[57:29] to the one that we
[57:31] wronged especially to to the one that
[57:33] we're arguing
[57:35] with confess your faults one to another
[57:38] and then pray for one another you see
[57:41] how the love just comes
[57:47] in it's not just friends let me let me
[57:51] say that too it's not just the one that
[57:53] you are praying for
[57:55] that's healed you can receive your
[57:59] healing by praying for someone else it
[58:01] says right here confess your faults one
[58:03] to another and pray one for another that
[58:06] you may be
[58:07] healed so if I'm praying for this person
[58:11] I'm asking the Lord Lord have mercy for
[58:13] this person suffering with cancer or for
[58:15] my daughter or for my son and then all
[58:17] of a sudden I get
[58:20] healed right there pray one for another
[58:23] that you may be healed
[58:25] not just the one you're praying
[58:29] for then he goes
[58:32] on thinking about talking about this man
[58:36] named Elijah it says Elias Elias is the
[58:39] Greek form of the the Hebrew name Elijah
[58:42] it's the same name he starts talking
[58:45] about this great man
[58:48] Elijah and this man Elijah we know the
[58:52] story one of the greatest prophets
[58:54] that's in the whole Bible he he goes and
[58:56] at the end of his life he walks up to
[58:59] this River Jordan River and it's swollen
[59:02] it's it's spread across and he takes his
[59:05] coat off he smacks the river the River
[59:07] dries up he walks across the
[59:11] river and then God sends down a chariot
[59:15] of fire and Horses of fire come down and
[59:18] pick this man up and take him up into
[59:22] heaven great man right
[59:26] one of the greatest stories that's in
[59:27] the whole book is that story it
[59:30] symbolizes the Rapture for the bride and
[59:32] many many other things and then Jame
[59:35] James says this he says
[59:37] Elias that same
[59:39] man was subject to like passions as we
[59:42] are he was a man he had problems he had
[59:47] weaknesses but there was something that
[59:49] set him
[59:50] apart what was it that Set This Man
[59:53] Apart and he prayed
[59:55] earnestly that it might not rain and it
[59:58] rained not on the Earth by the span of
[1:00:00] three years and six months he's he's
[1:00:02] referring back to win this man Elijah he
[1:00:06] went to Ahab because there was so much
[1:00:07] sin in the country he went to Ahab and
[1:00:10] he said listen it's not going to rain
[1:00:12] again until I call for it because of
[1:00:14] your wickedness and that of his wife
[1:00:18] Jezebel and then imagine three and a
[1:00:20] half years without rain they didn't have
[1:00:23] wells that they could stick a pump down
[1:00:25] and turn a diesel engine on and pump the
[1:00:27] water out they were dependent on rain
[1:00:31] for their crops and for drinking and
[1:00:33] everything
[1:00:34] else the rivers dried up The Creeks
[1:00:38] dried up everything dried up there was a
[1:00:40] famine in the land and then Elijah comes
[1:00:42] back and he prays again and then God
[1:00:46] sends the rain that's that's who we were
[1:00:48] talking about this man prayed and he was
[1:00:50] a man subject to like passions as we are
[1:00:53] he prayed earnestly that it might not
[1:00:54] rain and then it rain not on the Earth
[1:00:56] by the space of three years and six
[1:00:57] months and he prayed
[1:00:59] again and Heaven gave rain and the Earth
[1:01:02] brought forth her
[1:01:05] fruit and he's saying that he was like
[1:01:09] us so how much are we living
[1:01:12] below our expectations of
[1:01:16] God Elijah was praying God closed the
[1:01:19] heavens one man praying and God would do
[1:01:22] all this what if two men were
[1:01:25] praying what if two of us really got
[1:01:28] down and
[1:01:29] prayed what if
[1:01:31] three four five this was just one
[1:01:35] man was praying what about us what would
[1:01:39] God do if we really got sincere and went
[1:01:43] before
[1:01:44] God and prayed like Elijah
[1:01:49] prayed James continues
[1:01:51] on he says Brethren if it any of you do
[1:01:55] he from the truth and one convert
[1:01:58] him let him know that he which converte
[1:02:02] The Sinner from error of his way shall
[1:02:05] save a soul from death and shall hide a
[1:02:07] multitude of sins so he goes straight
[1:02:10] from Elijah
[1:02:11] praying and closing up the heavens and
[1:02:14] says Hey listen we're like him he had
[1:02:18] problems he wasn't perfect he had
[1:02:20] weaknesses we're like him and then he
[1:02:22] talks about a greater miracle that can
[1:02:25] happen what's greater than than being
[1:02:28] able to control the weather and doing
[1:02:30] all that it's when a sinner comes before
[1:02:33] the Lord when a sinner comes and repents
[1:02:36] and gives that soul to the Lord Jesus
[1:02:39] and that soul is saved how much more is
[1:02:41] that one Soul
[1:02:42] worth than all the worlds I was talking
[1:02:45] about
[1:02:46] earlier how much more is that one
[1:02:50] Soul than the land of Israel
[1:02:55] it's worth 10,000 worlds it's worth far
[1:02:58] more than we can even imagine One
[1:03:02] Soul let him
[1:03:05] know that he which converteth The Sinner
[1:03:07] from eror from the error of his way
[1:03:10] shall save a soul from death and shall
[1:03:13] hide a multitude of
[1:03:16] sins how much more important is that
[1:03:19] Soul how much more important is the work
[1:03:21] that we're doing here at the Tucson
[1:03:23] Tabernacle and trying to bring these
[1:03:25] souls in trying to get these souls to
[1:03:27] the Lord Jesus it's far greater than all
[1:03:30] the Miracles that we could ever imagine
[1:03:32] parting the Red Sea and all that but
[1:03:33] what good does parting the Red Sea do if
[1:03:35] a soul doesn't get
[1:03:38] saved doesn't do any good getting that
[1:03:41] soul to Christ through prayer and then
[1:03:44] through witness and most importantly
[1:03:46] through love is greater than anything
[1:03:49] Elijah
[1:03:50] did in all of his
[1:03:52] life we have the opportunity Unity to
[1:03:54] bring
[1:03:55] someone to the one who not only created
[1:03:58] the heavens and the Earth but that can
[1:04:00] also be approached and touched through a
[1:04:02] sincere heart and a sincere
[1:04:06] prayer I see so much so-called Holiness
[1:04:11] outward prayers and everyone's needs
[1:04:12] attention everyone wants to be today
[1:04:15] it's it's our society everybody wants to
[1:04:17] be on Instagram with ridiculous pictures
[1:04:20] of themselves with all the eyelashes and
[1:04:22] all the and all the makeup and all that
[1:04:24] they do and then the moms want to be on
[1:04:28] on Facebook and tell everyone how good
[1:04:30] of a mother they are lifting themselves
[1:04:33] up and then the men want attention and
[1:04:35] respect from the people they want to be
[1:04:38] in the pull pit or or they they want to
[1:04:40] be the the richest person or they want
[1:04:43] the respect of the
[1:04:45] people and they want as the Bible says
[1:04:47] they want to sit in the high places in
[1:04:50] church and everyone know that they're
[1:04:53] important
[1:04:56] but who is the
[1:04:58] person that is the one that is making
[1:05:01] the most
[1:05:03] difference I was talking about the world
[1:05:05] that we live in today and and all the
[1:05:07] internet and all all the apps and all
[1:05:09] all the stuff and and all of the the
[1:05:13] celebrity and all of this but who is
[1:05:16] making the most difference it is is it
[1:05:18] that Elijah that was on his knees
[1:05:21] praying asking the Lord cry crying out
[1:05:24] to the Lord or is it the person that's
[1:05:26] always promoting them and trying to get
[1:05:28] up in front of everybody and trying to
[1:05:29] trying to to make themel something it's
[1:05:33] that person that
[1:05:35] prays that's the person that makes a
[1:05:38] difference one day we're going to see
[1:05:41] that we're one day we're going to see
[1:05:43] how important those prayers are to God
[1:05:47] are to our families are to this whole
[1:05:50] world as I said before that that person
[1:05:55] on their knees crying out to
[1:05:58] God it's like the sun rising up there's
[1:06:03] no great noise there's no great power
[1:06:06] but it just
[1:06:08] happens and it happens because that
[1:06:10] prayer of faith was prayed Matthew
[1:06:13] chapter
[1:06:15] 6 talks about when when Jesus was
[1:06:19] telling us Matthew 6:6 Jesus is
[1:06:22] instructing he says but you but thou
[1:06:25] when thou prayest enter into the
[1:06:28] closet and when thou has shut thy door
[1:06:32] pray to thy father which is in secret
[1:06:34] and thy father which seeth in secret
[1:06:37] shall reward thee
[1:06:39] openly but when you pray use not vain
[1:06:42] repetition as the Heathen do for they
[1:06:44] think that they shall be heard for their
[1:06:46] much speaking be not therefore like unto
[1:06:48] them for your father knoweth what things
[1:06:50] you have need of before you ask them
[1:06:54] what a comfort what a comfort that that
[1:06:57] God knows before we get on our knees he
[1:06:59] requires that we do pray that is one of
[1:07:02] his requirements that we get on our
[1:07:04] knees or we however we're we stand and
[1:07:07] pray as the Bible says sometimes but
[1:07:09] whatever it is when we go before the
[1:07:11] Lord he requires that but the thing is
[1:07:14] he already knows what we have need
[1:07:16] of beautiful scripture in Romans chapter
[1:07:19] 8 verse
[1:07:22] 25 when we are praying remember it's not
[1:07:26] us that's praying if we are truly in the
[1:07:30] spirit of
[1:07:31] God something else is speaking for us
[1:07:34] I'm sure many of us have been there many
[1:07:35] of us that pray you'll be on your knees
[1:07:38] and you'll be praying and you'll say
[1:07:40] something like what was
[1:07:43] that why did I say that maybe that was
[1:07:46] the Holy Spirit speaking through you and
[1:07:49] it had to be spoken out then the father
[1:07:52] would hear it and then answer the prayer
[1:07:56] verse
[1:07:57] 25 says this but if we hope for that
[1:08:01] which we see for that we see not then we
[1:08:05] do with patience wait for
[1:08:09] it so if we're truly sincere then we'll
[1:08:12] have patience to wait for what was given
[1:08:15] likewise the spirit also helpeth with
[1:08:17] our infirmities for we know not what we
[1:08:20] should pray for as we ought but the
[1:08:22] spirit itself make it intercessions for
[1:08:24] us with groanings which cannot be
[1:08:29] uttered there are times we get so caught
[1:08:33] up we get so caught up in the spirit and
[1:08:36] then it becomes sometimes it's even an
[1:08:39] unknown tongue that will come out in
[1:08:43] worship and In Praise in that in that
[1:08:46] quiet time just us and God and there we
[1:08:50] are and we're praying and all of a
[1:08:52] sudden things will be coming out Lord I
[1:08:55] don't even know what that
[1:08:56] is that's a tongue that I don't even
[1:08:59] understand and it's coming out of my
[1:09:01] mouth these unknown tongues will go up
[1:09:04] before God as a sweet smelling Savor as
[1:09:06] praise as prayer and then other times it
[1:09:10] may be that we'll say something that it
[1:09:13] was him that said it and we think like
[1:09:16] Lord that's the farthest thing from me
[1:09:18] but it needed to be said and he that
[1:09:21] searches the hearts knoweth
[1:09:24] what is the mind of the spirit because
[1:09:27] he maketh intercession for the Saints
[1:09:30] according to the will of God so the
[1:09:33] Creator knows the deepest desires of the
[1:09:35] hearts and he knows that his will is
[1:09:38] better for his children than our own
[1:09:40] will is and that same Spirit friends
[1:09:43] that same Spirit if we read in the Book
[1:09:47] of Genesis that same spirit that right
[1:09:51] at the beginning it talks about moved
[1:09:53] across cross the face of the deep there
[1:09:56] was nothing
[1:09:57] there and created the heavens and the
[1:10:00] Earth and separated the light from the
[1:10:02] darkness and and the water from the land
[1:10:04] and did all of those things that same
[1:10:07] spirit that was there at the beginning
[1:10:09] is that same spirit that can come into
[1:10:12] us if we are truly
[1:10:16] sincere and we are truly praying in
[1:10:19] God's spirit it will come into us and
[1:10:22] that same spirit that moved across the
[1:10:25] face of the deep will speak out words
[1:10:29] that we could have never even uttered
[1:10:30] with our own lips that we would have no
[1:10:33] idea maybe what they mean or or what we
[1:10:36] would even say and it comes out and it
[1:10:39] speaks God's word and then the sick are
[1:10:43] healed then the Lost are brought
[1:10:47] forward and brought to the
[1:10:51] Lord and how we should have faith
[1:10:54] brothers and sisters in our own prayers
[1:10:57] there's a story that
[1:11:00] really blesses me it's a story about
[1:11:04] this young
[1:11:05] man he's um he was he was a
[1:11:09] son of a
[1:11:11] minister in
[1:11:14] fact his lineage went way back as far as
[1:11:19] he could really trace it his dad was a
[1:11:20] preacher his his grandfather was AE
[1:11:23] preacher all the way back his family
[1:11:25] were always ministers really really good
[1:11:28] ones he had a very good lineage and he
[1:11:30] was a young man and he was growing up
[1:11:32] and he was going to follow in his
[1:11:34] Father's Footsteps and he was going to
[1:11:36] be a minister he was going to be a
[1:11:39] pastor so
[1:11:41] he found a young
[1:11:44] lady that fine sweet girl her dad was a
[1:11:51] preacher and her grandfather
[1:11:54] was a preacher so she understood how
[1:11:57] this ministry how important it was so
[1:12:01] they end up getting married her name was
[1:12:03] Elizabeth so they end up getting
[1:12:06] married and going into the
[1:12:09] ministry this young man his name was is
[1:12:12] they called him Zach this young man he
[1:12:16] and his wife grew in the spirit and
[1:12:19] serving
[1:12:21] God and after a while as as it is with
[1:12:25] with most young couples they wanted to
[1:12:28] have a
[1:12:29] child and they were trying to have
[1:12:31] children and it never it never worked so
[1:12:35] years
[1:12:37] passed and Zach and
[1:12:39] Elizabeth continue on he kept preaching
[1:12:42] the gospel
[1:12:44] and praying that the Lord would give
[1:12:46] them a child and the child never came
[1:12:50] and Zach went in before the Lord
[1:12:54] probably in the closet as as I was just
[1:12:56] quoting he went in there and he said
[1:13:00] Lord give us a
[1:13:02] son give us a CH give us children that
[1:13:06] we might grow in the Lord and that we
[1:13:08] might raise them and the and Elizabeth
[1:13:11] was so sad and heartbroken that she
[1:13:13] couldn't have a child so time went on
[1:13:16] maybe they they were in their mid 20s
[1:13:17] when they prayed this time went on they
[1:13:19] got to be 30
[1:13:22] 35 40 no
[1:13:26] children nothing
[1:13:29] there continued on they
[1:13:32] continued Zechariah keep kept preaching
[1:13:35] the gospel doing his
[1:13:39] best 40 years old 45 years old 50 years
[1:13:43] old 55
[1:13:45] 60 no more children they were past
[1:13:48] they're beyond
[1:13:50] that but God
[1:13:53] had remembered that prayer and that was
[1:13:56] not Zachariah praying that was the Holy
[1:13:59] Spirit speaking through Zachariah when
[1:14:02] he asked for
[1:14:04] that 55 years old 60s years old the
[1:14:09] thought of that was long since
[1:14:13] past then Zachariah as he was doing his
[1:14:18] duties as the
[1:14:21] priest he went in
[1:14:24] to the
[1:14:25] temple he had his
[1:14:30] incense and the man a man came before
[1:14:34] him and not just any man this is the
[1:14:37] same
[1:14:40] man an angel that went to the Prophet
[1:14:44] Daniel and announced Daniel that this
[1:14:47] this is going to be this many days this
[1:14:49] many weeks until the coming Messiah this
[1:14:52] is the same Angel messenger the most
[1:14:55] well-known angel in the whole Bible and
[1:14:57] he came to a little while later he came
[1:14:59] to this young girl named Mary and
[1:15:02] announced that you are going to have a
[1:15:04] son and he is going to be the
[1:15:06] Messiah the same one came to Joseph
[1:15:09] Mary's husband espoused husband and told
[1:15:12] him that don't worry about these things
[1:15:13] this is me the same Angel the greatest
[1:15:17] Angel and he comes down to this old man
[1:15:22] Zachariah
[1:15:25] and he says
[1:15:29] this he says in Luke chapter 1 verse
[1:15:34] 15 verse
[1:15:36] 13 but the angel said to him Zachariah
[1:15:39] got scared he's in there he's in the
[1:15:41] temple nothing like this had ever
[1:15:43] happened an angel cames down comes down
[1:15:46] the Angels always say the same thing
[1:15:47] they say fear
[1:15:49] not because there must be fear that's
[1:15:52] associated iated with these angels with
[1:15:54] they
[1:15:56] come and the angel said unto him feite
[1:16:00] Zechariah listen to
[1:16:02] this for the Lord for thy prayer is
[1:16:08] heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear
[1:16:11] thee a son and thou shalt call his name
[1:16:16] John God heard your prayer
[1:16:19] Zachariah he heard what you had prayed
[1:16:22] Zachariah must have been brother Aaron
[1:16:24] he's probably 65 70 years old he's not
[1:16:26] praying that the Lord will give him a
[1:16:28] son
[1:16:29] anymore those times are long since past
[1:16:31] he had resigned that this prayer isn't
[1:16:33] going to be
[1:16:35] answered but God had heard
[1:16:38] it and he comes to Zachariah he says God
[1:16:42] heard what you asked Zachariah God heard
[1:16:46] your
[1:16:48] prayer and thou shalt have joy and
[1:16:52] gladness
[1:16:53] and many shall rejoice at his birth for
[1:16:56] he shall be great in the sight of the
[1:16:57] Lord and shall drink neither wine nor
[1:17:00] strong drink and he shall be filled with
[1:17:02] the Holy Ghost even from his mother's
[1:17:04] womb and many of the children of Israel
[1:17:07] shall he turn to the Lord their God and
[1:17:10] he shall go before him in the spirit and
[1:17:12] the power of Elias to turn the hearts of
[1:17:14] the fathers to the children and the
[1:17:16] disobedient to the wisdom of the just to
[1:17:19] make ready a people prepared for the
[1:17:21] Lord and z zaras listen to
[1:17:24] this even with an angel is standing
[1:17:27] before him and the angel says listen
[1:17:30] Zachariah God heard your prayer and he's
[1:17:31] got like
[1:17:33] what I'm an old
[1:17:35] man and Zachariah said unto the angel
[1:17:38] whereby shall I know this for I an old
[1:17:42] man and my wife well stricken in
[1:17:45] years how many of
[1:17:47] us in this room present now have fallen
[1:17:52] in the same trap that Zechariah fell
[1:17:55] into how many
[1:17:57] grandmas Grandma God heard your
[1:18:01] prayer God heard your prayer for your
[1:18:04] children you place it into his
[1:18:08] hand and he will answer but he'll do it
[1:18:11] in his time he knows what's best for all
[1:18:14] of us if he would have answered
[1:18:16] Zachariah and Elizabeth right when they
[1:18:18] prayed it it would have messed up the
[1:18:20] whole plan Jesus wouldn't have come for
[1:18:22] 30 for 40
[1:18:25] years God had a plan Zachariah and
[1:18:28] Elizabeth were perfectly in this
[1:18:33] plan do you think God forgets our
[1:18:37] prayers when we are
[1:18:39] sincere it's easy most of us do think
[1:18:42] that we just kind of put it aside saying
[1:18:46] uh maybe maybe it wasn't his will but if
[1:18:49] it was God speaking through you as I
[1:18:50] said in Romans if that was the Holy
[1:18:52] Spirit speaking he doesn't
[1:18:54] forget and the angel answering and the
[1:18:57] angel answering said unto him I am
[1:18:59] Gabriel that stand in the presence of
[1:19:02] God and am sent to speak unto thee and
[1:19:06] to show thee these Glad Tidings and
[1:19:09] behold Thou shalt be dumb and not able
[1:19:11] to speak until the day that these things
[1:19:13] shall be per performed because thou
[1:19:15] believest not my words which shall be
[1:19:18] fulfilled in their season and the people
[1:19:20] waited for Zacharias and marveled that
[1:19:23] he carried so long in the temple when he
[1:19:24] came out he couldn't speak to them and
[1:19:27] they perceived that he had seen a vision
[1:19:28] in the temple for he beckoned on them
[1:19:30] and remain speechless here is this Angel
[1:19:34] put yourself in the Angel's position now
[1:19:38] he comes down he has word from the Lord
[1:19:40] he comes down and he says
[1:19:42] Zachariah you prayed it and I'm here to
[1:19:45] tell you God's answering says oh I'm too
[1:19:49] old what is anything too hard for God as
[1:19:54] the Bible says
[1:19:56] no and the same thing for us and what
[1:19:58] I'm trying to say is this isn't just a
[1:20:01] story this is to apply to ourselves if
[1:20:04] we have a prayer if we ask God something
[1:20:07] he is able to answer no matter what the
[1:20:10] circumstances seem and if we were on our
[1:20:13] knees and we were praying or as I said
[1:20:16] standing however you were praying to God
[1:20:18] and it was the Holy Spirit speaking
[1:20:20] through you have
[1:20:23] confidence that it will happen it's in
[1:20:26] the Lord's
[1:20:27] hands we don't have to worry that he
[1:20:30] forgot we're constantly trying to remind
[1:20:32] them we're constantly say Lord what
[1:20:34] about my
[1:20:35] kids what about what about my
[1:20:38] job what about my car what about this
[1:20:42] what about
[1:20:43] that we need I need
[1:20:46] it and he's like I heard you the first
[1:20:50] time and I'm gonna answer in my time if
[1:20:54] I answer in your time it won't work out
[1:20:56] right so he answered Zachariah and
[1:20:59] Elizabeth in his time there was a young
[1:21:02] lady who was like 15 or 16 years old
[1:21:05] over here that had to be born and had to
[1:21:08] grow up that she was chosen before the
[1:21:10] foundation of the world to give birth to
[1:21:12] the Messiah everything had to be going
[1:21:15] in perfect line and if Zachariah and
[1:21:17] Elizabeth would have got their way it
[1:21:19] would have messed it all
[1:21:20] up so here is
[1:21:24] born John the
[1:21:26] Baptist as Jesus said the greatest there
[1:21:30] had never been a woman man born of a
[1:21:33] woman greater than John and that's who
[1:21:35] was
[1:21:37] born and as I
[1:21:40] said it was perfect and God's plan was
[1:21:44] brought through perfectly let me read
[1:21:47] that again but the angel said unto him
[1:21:49] fear not
[1:21:50] Zachariah for thy prayer is heard word
[1:21:53] and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear a son
[1:21:55] and th shalt call his name
[1:21:57] JN God never underd delivers he never he
[1:22:03] will always impress us we don't judge
[1:22:06] him with our own carnal
[1:22:08] thinking but be patient with
[1:22:12] God and this world wants to tell you
[1:22:14] that you need your answer right now you
[1:22:17] need this right now whether there be
[1:22:20] young people you need a husband right
[1:22:21] now you need a wife right now when you
[1:22:23] get married you need children right now
[1:22:25] when you order from Amazon you got to
[1:22:27] have it right now you got to have it
[1:22:30] tomorrow wait it's all right you don't
[1:22:33] have to pay the $3 for the extra
[1:22:36] shipping let it go a couple
[1:22:38] days and the same thing with with the
[1:22:41] Lord Jesus be patient when you
[1:22:44] ask don't ask a Miss don't ask things
[1:22:48] wrong ask according to his will asking
[1:22:51] for his will James 1 verse 2 says this
[1:22:56] my brethren count at all joy when you
[1:22:59] follow into divers Temptations knowing
[1:23:02] this that the trying of your faith work
[1:23:03] is patience but let patience have her
[1:23:07] perfect
[1:23:09] work that you may be perfect and entire
[1:23:13] that you may be whole and complete
[1:23:16] wanting nothing wanting means lacking
[1:23:19] nothing God's timing is perfect our time
[1:23:23] is
[1:23:24] flawed as I said we leave it we live in
[1:23:27] I need it now I need it this I need it
[1:23:31] yesterday and we we don't have patience
[1:23:33] God doesn't change
[1:23:35] though he said have patience that
[1:23:39] patience can have her perfect
[1:23:43] work Mark
[1:23:46] 16:14
[1:23:47] Jesus he had
[1:23:51] come and he appeared to the
[1:23:54] disciples he had
[1:23:57] died on the cross gone into the
[1:24:01] grave and then the sisters saw him in
[1:24:04] the grave we know the Easter story and
[1:24:07] then Jesus manifests himself to the
[1:24:09] disciples Mark
[1:24:12] 16:14 says this and afterward he
[1:24:16] appeared unto the 11 as they sat at meat
[1:24:20] and abided them with their unbelief and
[1:24:21] hardness of heart because they believed
[1:24:24] not them which had seen him after he was
[1:24:29] risen so the sisters were telling the
[1:24:32] disciples that the Lord is risen he's
[1:24:35] come but they wouldn't believe it
[1:24:37] because this was just too much to
[1:24:38] believe this was just too much for God
[1:24:41] like Zachariah this miracle would have
[1:24:44] been too
[1:24:48] great and he said unto
[1:24:51] them go ye into all the world and preach
[1:24:55] the gospel to Every
[1:24:57] Creature Jesus is instructing his
[1:25:00] disciples to go out after you have
[1:25:03] received this Faith go out and preach
[1:25:05] the gospel and I'd like to ask the
[1:25:09] brothers and sisters listen to
[1:25:11] me how many here will follow Jesus's
[1:25:15] commandment to go and preach the
[1:25:17] gospel it doesn't necessarily mean right
[1:25:20] here in this pulpit with the Bible open
[1:25:24] explaining the word but we are all to
[1:25:27] preach the gospel the gospel isn't in
[1:25:29] word only don't forget it's also in
[1:25:31] power as the Bible says he that
[1:25:35] believeth Jesus talking still he that
[1:25:38] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[1:25:41] but he that believeth not shall be
[1:25:45] damned how important it is for us to
[1:25:47] tell our friends our family everyone we
[1:25:50] know about this Lord Jesus seeing that
[1:25:53] if they don't believe they're damned
[1:25:55] they're
[1:25:58] gone what does it produce friends what
[1:26:00] does this ministry produce if we really
[1:26:03] believe on the Lord Jesus if we really
[1:26:05] take him as at his his word what does it
[1:26:08] produce in every believer it says this
[1:26:11] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:26:14] believe in my name they shall cast out
[1:26:17] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[1:26:20] they shall take up serpents and if they
[1:26:21] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[1:26:24] them they shall lay hands on the
[1:26:27] sick and they shall
[1:26:31] recover I feel
[1:26:34] like are you with me are you listening
[1:26:37] I'm reading the words of the Lord Jesus
[1:26:40] here this these are promises to God from
[1:26:43] God to
[1:26:45] us this is something that it may seem
[1:26:50] that this is this is something that
[1:26:51] can't happen or that I'm not worthy or
[1:26:54] that I can't do this but we just go day
[1:26:57] by day and we forget about the Lord
[1:26:59] Jesus we forget about the promises of
[1:27:01] God we forget of what he did for us and
[1:27:05] we forget to witness we forget to tell
[1:27:06] our friends we forget to tell our family
[1:27:08] most of all we get so caught up in the
[1:27:10] world and the way that we go and and
[1:27:13] thinking about our jobs and thinking
[1:27:14] about television and Internet and social
[1:27:17] media and everything else we forget to
[1:27:19] get down on our knees and
[1:27:21] pray we forget to go before God as
[1:27:24] Zachariah
[1:27:26] did we forget to go before God as Daniel
[1:27:30] did all of
[1:27:33] us there needs to be more
[1:27:36] praying more listening to God there
[1:27:40] needs to be more consecration there
[1:27:43] friends we can't just walk through this
[1:27:50] world there's
[1:27:52] and science talks
[1:27:55] about you know the the cycle of life and
[1:27:58] it's like four billion years ago this
[1:28:01] they see the first forms of life on
[1:28:03] Earth and it it goes to ultimately to a
[1:28:07] single cell organism and then to more
[1:28:09] complex organism organisms and all and
[1:28:13] and then it evolves into where we are
[1:28:15] right now it's what science says Believe
[1:28:18] It or Not doesn't it's
[1:28:23] it's not
[1:28:25] important but there are those in this
[1:28:29] world
[1:28:31] many say maybe
[1:28:33] most that they're
[1:28:35] born in
[1:28:38] life they go up they grow up they go
[1:28:42] through life maybe they come into
[1:28:43] contact with somebody that believes
[1:28:45] Jesus maybe they they live a good life
[1:28:48] maybe they make a mark on society
[1:28:51] whatever it is and then they die and
[1:28:53] then they're
[1:28:55] gone James says and their life is but a
[1:28:59] vapor so we just there's many that just
[1:29:01] go through life and it is there's no God
[1:29:06] there there's no coming to the Lord
[1:29:10] Jesus they just show up and they were
[1:29:13] gone they weren't in God's mind in the
[1:29:15] beginning and they're not in God's mind
[1:29:17] in the end Jesus Christ himself said
[1:29:19] many will come to me and I'll say depart
[1:29:23] from me I never knew you even Jesus
[1:29:26] Christ himself didn't
[1:29:28] know people and they'll go through life
[1:29:32] without
[1:29:35] anything many many people on the Earth
[1:29:38] are like that I don't want to be one of
[1:29:41] those I don't want my life to just be
[1:29:43] here and go away and then be out of the
[1:29:45] mind of God I was praying yesterday I
[1:29:47] was asking the Lord Lord please whatever
[1:29:49] wherever you send me whatever you do
[1:29:51] with me
[1:29:52] please let me just see
[1:29:55] you before whatever happens let me just
[1:29:59] know you I just want to see what you are
[1:30:03] maybe not even with my my eyes I just
[1:30:05] want to know what God
[1:30:07] is I know Moses asked the same
[1:30:11] thing we should all be asking that same
[1:30:13] question Lord I just want to know you
[1:30:16] that's the biggest desire of my
[1:30:18] heart and then I want others
[1:30:22] to know our Lord friends I feel like
[1:30:25] it's just not important
[1:30:28] enough there is nothing greater that you
[1:30:32] can do than to
[1:30:34] pray there is no way to have communion
[1:30:38] with God if you are not
[1:30:41] praying and I'm not just talking about
[1:30:43] when you sit down at the table Lord Lord
[1:30:46] bless this food and thank you for this
[1:30:47] good day and and we had a good service
[1:30:49] this morning in jesus' name amen that's
[1:30:51] not what I'm talking
[1:30:53] about I'm talking about the effectual
[1:30:56] fervent
[1:30:59] prayer that means something to where
[1:31:03] that Spirit can come down into you and
[1:31:06] into me and then we can speak God's word
[1:31:11] and then it
[1:31:14] happens that's what we need or else are
[1:31:17] we just going to walk through life and
[1:31:19] then
[1:31:20] die this Vapor goes away and nothing
[1:31:23] ever came of
[1:31:26] it we'll
[1:31:28] close the musicians can
[1:31:33] come let me read that scripture
[1:31:37] again Mark
[1:31:40] 16 speaking about a Believer these
[1:31:43] Believers that really
[1:31:45] pray and these signs shall follow them
[1:31:49] that believe in my name they shall cast
[1:31:50] out Devils they shall speak with new
[1:31:52] tongues they shall take up serpents and
[1:31:54] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[1:31:56] not hurt them they shall lay hands on
[1:31:58] the sick and they shall recover these
[1:32:00] are
[1:32:02] promises will we take God at his
[1:32:06] promise if we can't believe in healing
[1:32:08] how can we believe in our
[1:32:11] Salvation I was at church on Wednesday
[1:32:14] night years ago probably 10 12 years ago
[1:32:18] maybe
[1:32:19] more in Jeffersonville
[1:32:22] barely anybody in the
[1:32:24] service and I was sitting up towards the
[1:32:26] front in the middle of the
[1:32:29] church we're were listening to a tape of
[1:32:32] brother
[1:32:33] branam and then brother brandham at the
[1:32:36] end of the
[1:32:38] service
[1:32:40] he did what he did he does many many
[1:32:43] times and he
[1:32:46] said that if you believe he said God
[1:32:50] promised that if they shall lay hands on
[1:32:52] the sick that they shall recover he said
[1:32:56] if you believe lay your hands on one
[1:33:00] another we were kind of going through
[1:33:02] the
[1:33:03] motions I was sitting there like where
[1:33:06] you would be brother Joe and
[1:33:09] and we all bowed our head and tried to
[1:33:11] follow along like we do we all bowed our
[1:33:14] head and a hand touched me on the back
[1:33:16] and it was my friend named Steve
[1:33:19] klopp his family would always sit right
[1:33:21] behind IND us and we all
[1:33:25] prayed and then we closed the service
[1:33:27] like nothing else nothing had ever
[1:33:31] happened but God was
[1:33:34] there God honored his
[1:33:38] word so after the
[1:33:41] service brother
[1:33:43] Steve comes to me we're in the parking
[1:33:46] lot like I said very few people in the
[1:33:48] church brother Steve comes to me in the
[1:33:49] parking lot and he says brother Danny
[1:33:51] says say he says I think the Lord's
[1:33:53] going to he says when I prayed I think
[1:33:55] the Lord's going to heal you of your
[1:33:57] stomach I had suffered pretty much every
[1:34:00] day of my life since I was like maybe 15
[1:34:04] 16 years old with a stomach problem and
[1:34:09] the first time I had it it felt like I
[1:34:11] was having a heart attack there would be
[1:34:13] such an incredible pain in my
[1:34:16] chest and what it was was it was the
[1:34:19] acid that was building up in my stomach
[1:34:21] and putting pressure and causing this
[1:34:23] incredible
[1:34:24] pain and I would just carry around
[1:34:28] tongs every single day of my
[1:34:31] life and that especially when I would
[1:34:34] get nervous that that pressure would
[1:34:36] come up and the pain would be so bad I'd
[1:34:39] just lay down on my my desk because it
[1:34:41] hurts so
[1:34:43] much and it was every day it wasn't like
[1:34:46] it happens
[1:34:48] sometimes so I'd take the an acid with
[1:34:51] with me and that would that would take
[1:34:52] care of it and I would drink a glass of
[1:34:55] water and Steve afterwards he said that
[1:34:59] I think the Lord's going to heal he says
[1:35:01] I think he's going to heal your stomach
[1:35:03] that was the last day that I ever had a
[1:35:06] problem with my
[1:35:09] stomach give thanks to the
[1:35:13] [Applause]
[1:35:15] Lord that happened to
[1:35:18] me and it wasn't some big feeling it
[1:35:21] there was a sincere prayer from the
[1:35:24] brother behind
[1:35:26] me let me tell you something else that
[1:35:28] just happened before I walked in to this
[1:35:31] service that's why I was so torn up I
[1:35:34] was standing I was back there in the
[1:35:36] back and I was praying and that same
[1:35:40] feeling came up in my
[1:35:43] chest and that same pressure and that
[1:35:45] same pain that I used to suffer
[1:35:49] with came up there
[1:35:52] telling me you still got
[1:35:54] it you're
[1:35:56] still never heal I never healed you the
[1:35:58] Lord never healed you it's like Satan
[1:36:01] that happened 12 13 years ago I remember
[1:36:04] when it happened and so you give me a
[1:36:07] little bit of heartburn right now
[1:36:10] because I'm nervous about going out in
[1:36:12] front of these people not today Satan no
[1:36:16] and it went
[1:36:17] away I was able to walk out here
[1:36:27] and claim the Lord Jesus claim is
[1:36:30] healing we're going to have the
[1:36:33] communion tonight as I said this
[1:36:35] communion let a man examine himself not
[1:36:39] only for
[1:36:40] yourself but when you come up here you
[1:36:43] are also
[1:36:44] standing in the place of the
[1:36:47] disciples those disciples went out and
[1:36:50] they healed the sick and they brought
[1:36:51] many to
[1:36:53] Christ when we come up in this communion
[1:36:56] it is together we cannot be divided
[1:37:00] there can't be anything in between us
[1:37:03] because when we do that it damages it
[1:37:07] cuts off the plan of God he wants us
[1:37:11] together he said pray one for another
[1:37:14] why does he require that why can't we
[1:37:15] just go before the Lord and say Lord
[1:37:17] Heal me because he wants somebody else
[1:37:19] praying for us he wants his children
[1:37:22] together and that's the way we need to
[1:37:24] be and that's the way the communion is
[1:37:26] supposed to be you can't take communion
[1:37:28] by
[1:37:30] yourself the very word communion means
[1:37:33] to
[1:37:34] commune to be with each
[1:37:37] other love one
[1:37:39] another Jesus Christ himself you know
[1:37:43] the scripture he said I will know you
[1:37:45] when I return because of your love one
[1:37:47] for another you're going to be taking
[1:37:50] communion you're going to be taking the
[1:37:52] wine you're going to be serving each
[1:37:54] other you're going to as James said
[1:37:56] you're going to be praying for each
[1:37:58] other the Lord's going to be Healing The
[1:38:01] Sick you're going to be speaking in
[1:38:04] tongues these gifts are going to
[1:38:07] manifested themselves and it's all
[1:38:10] because you are doing you in the will of
[1:38:14] God but we need to put him first we need
[1:38:16] to get on our knees we need to
[1:38:19] pray one for another
[1:38:22] we don't do it
[1:38:24] enough I'm guilty we're all
[1:38:27] guilty and he's a
[1:38:30] change pray one for
[1:38:33] another go before the Lord one for
[1:38:36] another brother Dan there's not anything
[1:38:38] greater than we could
[1:38:39] do than going before our lord Jesus not
[1:38:44] on behalf of yourself but on behalf of
[1:38:47] someone else there's nothing greater
[1:38:50] that we could do
[1:38:51] that's what Jesus did that's the very
[1:38:53] Spirit of Christ that Jesus would go to
[1:38:55] the cross for someone
[1:38:59] else read it
[1:39:05] again and he said unto them go ye into
[1:39:07] all the world and preach the gospel to
[1:39:10] every creature that is every living
[1:39:13] person he that believed and is baptized
[1:39:16] shall be
[1:39:17] saved and he that believe not shall be
[1:39:20] damned and these signs shall follow them
[1:39:23] that believe in my name they shall cast
[1:39:25] out Devils they shall speak with new
[1:39:27] tongues they shall take up serpants and
[1:39:29] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[1:39:31] not hurt them they shall lay hands on
[1:39:33] the sick and they shall recover is there
[1:39:37] anything about that that you don't
[1:39:42] believe no give me a little bit here do
[1:39:46] you believe
[1:39:48] it do you believe that the same God
[1:39:51] that healed
[1:39:54] me that's in the
[1:39:57] Psalms do you believe the same God that
[1:39:59] healed me of my stomach can heal
[1:40:02] you do you believe in communion do you

[1:41:10] another I promise
[1:41:12] you I don't have to promise Jesus
[1:41:15] promised that people are going to get
[1:41:16] healed
[1:41:18] today that people will be healed in the
[1:41:20] name of Jesus Christ because we're doing
