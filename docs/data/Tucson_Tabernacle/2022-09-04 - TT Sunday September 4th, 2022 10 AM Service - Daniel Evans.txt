chapter 12. it's a wonderful day to be in the house of the Lord I hope your expectations are high this morning because mine certainly are we'll start with verse 2. the prophet is speaking of the Resurrection and he says this and many of them that sleep in the dust of the Earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt and this is what I wanted to get to and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to the to righteousness as the Stars forever and ever amen let's bow our heads almighty God what a promise

we're going to be using her a lot more I pray where is sister hope where'd she go I think she chickened out um it's good to see you all I don't see I don't see too many visitors brother Elijah it's good to have you in service my friend God bless your loyal heart we uh we appreciate you that's brother Heath son I remember when before I moved to Jeffersonville I remember when you were just a little baby man it's good to see you all grown up and and wanting to serve the Lord it's good to have you in church God bless you Brother David it's good to see you my friend brother Wilson sister Marlene good to see you all all the friends that we have it's it's so wonderful to gather together with people that love the Lord Jesus and want to put him first my subject this morning I want to speak on influence and I know that it's a broad subject but I want to touch on some different things some different influences that we have in our lives and most of how we can be an influence on others so to start I want to read a few scriptures I'm going to go through them fast brother Jeremiah let's start with both with Proverbs chapter 12 verse 26. then I'm going to go to Proverbs 13 20 Proverbs 22 24 Proverbs 27 First Corinthians 15 and Matthew 5 16. I'm not expecting you all to keep up with me thank the Lord for this thing up here and thank the Lord for for our brothers in the back Proverbs chapter 12 verse 26 it says this the righteous is more excellent than his neighbor the water that's a that's an Old English term the Modern English would be the righteous is a guide to his neighbor but the Way of the Wicked seduces them Proverbs Chapter 13 Verse 20. it says this he that walketh with wise men shall be wise but a companion a companion of fools shall be destroyed Proverbs chapter 22 verse 24. make no friendship with an angry man and with a furious man Thou shalt not go lest thou learn his ways and get a snare to thy soul Proverbs chapter 27 verse 17 it says this and I like this one iron sharpeneth iron so a man sharpeneth the consonant countenance of his friend First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 33. oh wait uh wait yeah I can just read it be not deceived evil communication corrupt good manners Modern English translation of that would be evil Communications corrupt good morals Matthew chapter 5 verse 16 says this let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven amen friends influences are all around us they're around us all the time and and we always think about our children we always think about ourselves and when we think about these influences that are on us but don't forget you're an influence you're an influence to whoever you're around I was um my son and I a couple years ago we were in Walmart and we were we're in the fishing section and I was looking at the the different uh lures and and stuff and uh my son who's a lot more observant than I am he noticed that there was this man this big man the big beard long hair he was in he was in like uh biker clothes and change you know how they they walk and they they make a noise when they walk because all the chains that are on them and he uh he looked like that typical biker and he would say I'd say he was in his 50s and I was I was looking at the fishing gear I was focused on that and Daniel said that he was down at the end of the aisle and he walked up behind me and he stood there and then he walked away and then he came back and then he walked up next to me and I was looking at the stuff and and he said he says you know the pumpkin seed color is good for bass he said he said they like that color and I said oh yeah I said I've used that and he said my wife just left me he said she took my my son she said he said I don't know what to do big tears in his eyes this big man you would never think that that big man the way he looked and and and all that was on him that he had a heart like that and I said I said well brother I said do you know the Lord Jesus and he said it's on my heart to know him he said but I don't know what to do he said he said I had some Jehovah Witnesses come by and the other day and I was thinking well I'll go with them and I said well no you know that's maybe not the best thing to do and and we talked about the Lord and and I talked to him about the blood of Christ and and how the Lord wants to fellowship with him and how the Lord sent him there to the Walmart that day so that I could be a witness to him and the man with big tears in his eyes and and he says I I got to know the Lord so we had a little prayer meeting at Walmart that day and it was just it was just precious to me but friends it broke my heart and this is this is a few years ago this is in Jeffersonville I didn't have a place to send him to church I didn't have a place that I felt comfortable sending him that he wouldn't get discouraged that would teach about Christ because so often they come people will come into a congregation and they don't even speak the same language as we speak we start talking about the seventh angel we started start talking about Revelation 10 and we started talking about these things and they come in and they say where's Jesus in all this I came to know Jesus and it just it broke my heart's friends and and I'll I'll tell you I know that we have a smaller congregation here and I just felt on my heart to maybe share a few things that are that are just deep in my heart you know I don't know if we're streaming I don't know if if we're recording and it's good if we are but um I was told that we probably wouldn't so I thought you know I'll just share a little bit deeper things in my heart today and I it is the desire of my heart and it has been my wife can testify for a long time that I could have a place that would people could come and that that I could Point people to and that that it would be a place that is just filled with love that preaches Jesus Christ and him crucified and that they could come in and they would be welcomed in The Sinner could come in The Sinner could come in and say I'm wrong and there wouldn't be no fingers pointed at him because let me tell you something we're all sinners none any worse than any other but come in and that biker the way that he looked and and somebody would look at him and say there's nothing to that man and who knows what his past was but he had a tender heart and I would love to have that it's been the desire of my heart for a long time and I think that the Lord may be moving that way around the world that we can set aside some of our doctrines I'm not talking about this church here I'm talking about around the world that we can set aside some of our doctrines and realize these things aren't that important you know when we we hear so much people get Revelations and they get Revelations of oh this is this is who brother Branham was and and it's and the seventh angel and Malachi 4 tie in this way and and oh and he had this Vision about the tent and this is how it's going to be in the third pole and the squeeze and all this how come that Revelation is never Jesus Christ died for my sins how come it's never God came down in human flesh and died for my sins because that's the revelation we should have and that's when you see the arms open and that's when you see sinners come to the altar remember Jesus he said he had a hundred sheep one left and was astray and he left those 99 to get to that one sheep and that should be our our Focus you know the ones that are saved and filled with the Holy Ghost they're not sick but there's others that are and that needs to be where we reach out and we're not trying to get someone to our way of thinking but get them to Christ and then they can have a relationship with him it's the most important thing man there's nothing more important than that if we know Christ and we're preaching Christ then all the other Revelations will come the first memory I have I mean I was I remember I couldn't even walk I remember pulling myself up and looking over a the big reel the real console players brother Joe I don't want to give away your age but you're about where I am you remember those remember the big reel to reel players and uh brother Wilson you do and I remember pulling up and looking over that and watching those tapes go around and hearing brother Branham preach and I remember thinking okay if this side gets small then then Daddy will come over and he'll flip it over and then when that side gets small we get to the end which is the prayer line I love that as just a little kid I loved it when when brother Brown was talking to the people it was it was such a blessing to me I liked that my point in saying that is this message is inside of me I mean whatever I preach it has influenced me and it's gonna come out I don't have to always make an effort to to get in the cookie cutter way of doing things and say okay you have to read this many quotes you have to read this many scriptures and do that no believe me what's inside of me is going to come out I brother Branham preached about um he prophesied about a squeeze that's coming and there's been so many different interpretations of what the squeeze is going to be you know but if you take sister Angela if you take a orange and you squeeze it what comes out orange juice and that's how you know what's inside of it so let me tell you friends when we get squeezed which is happening which is going to happen and if it's not happening now what's going to come out of us is it going to be love is it going to be compassion or is it going to be judgment is it going to be uh thinking about about ourselves when we get squeezed what's going to come out and it we are going to get squeezed believe me the prophet said we were and it's going to happen so when I when I'm ministering what's inside me my upbringing will come out and that's all of us we had my brother and I my brother Adam and I excuse me my brother Adam and I I've said this before we started a Ministry in the Inner City um of Jeffersonville and these are mostly um black kids that didn't have father figures in their lives and they needed something to to help to help them so we saw a need and our sons were boxing and we saw just the boxing gym that we had them in was so worldly it was just a terrible place to be and I didn't want my kid my son there my brother Adam didn't want his kids there so eventually one of the coaches approached Adam and me and he said hey your kids are really good and he said I want to start a gym and I want to start it with your three kids my son and Adam's two boys and then there was a professional heavyweight fighter that was that was really good and he says I want to start it with just those four and he says and I want to make it a Ministry and now you're speaking my language so so we got we got this together we started with four kids and we started having a Bible say he said well what should we do I said well let's just have a Bible study so we started getting together and started to grow it started to get bigger more people started to come we rented a building pretty soon the building was too small we we formed a 501c3 non-profit we made it a church the the not only were the boxers coming but they're moms and their dads started coming and it started to grow with just this little bible study it continued to grow and then recently a local church donated an eight hundred thousand dollar building and 250 000 cash to renovate it it just it just got bigger and bigger and bigger and testimony started to started to come in and these these churches saw how they would send their kids here in boxing I mean again think of probably a more worldly sport but they would find Christ in this place there was this one kid his name's Jacob Jacob is going deaf he's probably I don't know he's 10 or 11 he's probably 11 or 12 years old and uh Jacob loved Bible study it wasn't a very good boxer but it didn't matter he just loved it when we would talk about the Lord so he would listen and I was teaching on Jesus and how Jesus would said it was better to give than to receive and then the coach his name's Jeremy the coach that um that kind of was the spearhead in all of this after I was finished he wanted to give a testimony he talked about a man a homeless man that he saw walking down the road and the guy only had one shoe so Jeremy stopped and if you knew this this brother he is first class man just he's tattooed from the top of his head to the bottom of his feet but he's got a good Soul right inside of there and he said that he stopped and he saw this man with one shoe and he said hey you know where's your shoe and he said well I lost it and he said you know what he had about the same size feet he took his shoes off and he gave it to the Man so you know it's just a nice little testimony so so Jacob hears this it influenced Jacob this this kid so Jacob he his mom is about this tall and about this wide and hair about as short as mine and no teeth and uh I don't know how to say it as Butch as you can be I mean if I don't know if everybody knows what that means but um well I'll figure it out um but but uh I mean rough looking woman and so Jacob he goes and he's and they're poor is dirt they don't have anything public housing and and not two nickels to rub together and and Jacob's out riding his bike and he sees this man sitting on the on the curb with no shoes on and bleeding and Jacob in his in his voice he doesn't talk really well because of his his ears and he says he comes up to he says what happened to you and he says well I got beat up he says where are your shoes and he says well they took them they beat me up and they took my shoes and Jacob says wait here you stay right here and you wait here Jacob takes all the money that he had he goes to the store he buys the guy a pair of shoes he buys him some clothes and he comes back and he gives him to this man sitting on the curb and he says I just want you to know he said God loves you and he said God cares about you this is an 11 year old kid I want you to know God loves you and he says this man on the street he says I don't know what to do and he says he says Jacob says this he says you just thank Jesus for this so Jacob he goes back home and he tells his mom remember they're poor and he says mom I did this and she says you took all of your money he says I did and his mom started thinking about it she wasn't happy with him so so his mom is back at the gym and and this is before I'm I'm scheduled to teach Bible study we have all these Fighters going everywhere you know everybody's boxing and doing their thing and I see this woman sitting there so I said I want to go talk to her so I went down and I sat down next to her and I I started talking with her and she gives me that testimony of Jacob and what he did and I said well she says I was mad at him I said well uh what do you think about it she says he's the best kid I could ever imagine she says I'd have never done anything like that my whole life and I said I said sister do you know the Lord Jesus she said well I come to your Bible study don't I I never would have thought never would have thought that she was actually interested but there she is sitting there taking in everything that we're talking about the Lord Jesus so Jacob starts witnessing to his mother and you know what that lady gave her heart to the Lord and she and Jacob went to that same church that that sponsored our our gym and got baptized and they even got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and even if they wouldn't have it would have been it would have been something that she did for the Lord and I think the Lord even the inner ignorance I think the Lord would have honored it but he honored it and did baptize her in the name of the Lord Jesus and I saw her the other day and Jacob still texts me every once in a while asked me questions about the Bible and the kid loves the Lord and that was probably four or five years ago that that happened to him but an influence so I'm we're teaching this Bible study and like I said the message that's inside of me it's going to come out what I've learned and that God sent this prophet and and that these wonderful things happened and that this book became not a history book but a living book that's in me so I never mentioned brother Branham it wasn't the place for it in teaching these kids the coach remember his name's Jeremy he's got a tattoo across his chest that says you can't judge me no no I'm sorry it says only God can judge me uh you know it's like I you know it's good so I'm teaching these Bible studies months go on my brother and I are doing this and uh Jeremy the coach I see him on his phone and he says hey check this out and he's on a group chat with coaches around the country at least 10. boxing coaches around the country well I remember I saw one of them was in Las Vegas I don't remember and there was one in Philadelphia but they are all around and you know what they were sending to each other they were sending quotes of brother Brown to each other and they're like man that guy he doesn't put any punches and they're sending them to each other and me never mentioning it and I asked Jeremy I said I said Jeremy uh you know what is this he says I love brother Brandon he says man he says he preaches it he says that man was a prophet of God I was salty Adam was salty and they got thirsty they wanted the same thing that we have and it and by the grace of God now my brother is it has continued to grow and he sends me every week he sends me a little video of the Bible study and there's probably 30 or 40 or more boxers there and they're everywhere from 12 years old all the way up to moms and dads loving the Lord influencing these people God blessed them and we have to make sure that we know everything that we say everything that we do is an influence on others and it could be good and it could be bad we have to watch it all the time it uh last time I ministered I can turn to Second Chronicles chapter six last time I ministered I talked about the Tabernacle that was in the wilderness and how this Tabernacle they would set it up it was a tense and there was there was the Holy place and then there was this place in the back of the Tabernacle that had a thick curtain of in front of it called the holy of holies and that Tabernacle eventually when they crossed over into the promised land years later there was a man named David who got inspired to take that Tabernacle that was mobile and make it a temple of worship make it God's house so David wanted to do it he had it on his heart he laid out all of the plans he wanted to build it and God said no you can't build it he said you can't build it because you've been a man of violence you fought battles and you've killed people he said but your son Solomon he can build the temple so David passed on he had all the plans there and Solomon took those plans that God had had given and he made it into the temple and it's famous is one of the most famous periods in fact they even judged the Bible by the temple period so they they date the Bible by the temple which Temple was this so Solomon it was seven years building this Temple it had to be perfect everything in it the gold and the and and the sensors the way that the priest would come in as I said before the the Aaron had two sons they had their sensors they had to put just the right kind of fire they had to walk into the holy the holies just perfectly they didn't I said as I said they took church for granted they came in with a bit of the wrong Spirit their little lackadaisically coming in and then God struck them dead good men God struck them dead he said grab them by the coat and pull them out it was a place of reverence it was a holy place consecrated place so then they build this Temple seven years as I said it was in the making excited everything had come together everything was finished but you can just build something with your hands and if God doesn't bless it it's not worth it then it's just for you so they were waiting on God to come down and dwell in this house that they had built him Solomon comes up before the people he built a platform a little bit higher than the people and he addressed the people and he prayed a prayer in second Chronicles chapter six and let's start with verse 19. Solomon says this and he's praying to God have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication O Lord my God to hearken under the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee that thine eyes may be opened to this house day and night upon the place whereof thou has said that thou would have put thy name there to hearken under the prayer which thy servant prayed toward this place hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant and of thy people is real which they shall make toward this place hear thou from thy Dwelling Place even from heaven and when thou heareth forgive look how important this Temple is if the people bow down and just face this building and God will hear their prayers if a man sinned against his neighbor and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear and the oath come before thy altar in this house then hear thou from heaven and do and judge thy servants by requiting the wicked by recompenting his way upon his own head and by justifying the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness and If thy People Israel be put to the worst before the enemy because they have sinned against thee and shall return and confess thy name and pray and make supplication before thee in this house then hear thou from heavens and forgive the sin of thy People Israel and bring them again into the land which thou gave us to them and to their fathers when the heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against thee yet if they pray toward this place and confess thy name and turn from their sin when thou Dost afflict them then hear thou from heaven and forgive the sin of thy servants and of thy People Israel when thou has taught them the good way wherein they should walk and sin Reign upon thy land which thou Hast given unto thy people for an inheritance and Solomon goes on in his prayer before the Lord and before the people whatever sin they've committed whatever enemy is before them if they will just face this Temple and pray to God then God will step on the scene the temple is sacred before the Lord it's the most important place in the world back there if we go to Second Chronicles chapter seven so Solomon had finished praying and he he had respected this Temple he had made the Lord welcome and it says this is second Chronicles chapter 7 verse one now when Solomon had made an end of praying the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the Lord filled the house and the priest could not enter into the house of the Lord because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lord's House and when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down and the glory of the Lord upon the house they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement and worshiped and praised the Lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth forever can you imagine being there when this happened can you imagine you worked on this Temple and here the temple come is and you're you're coming and you see Solomon pray and then get reverent and quiet and then the glory of the Lord comes down in Fire and consumes the offering I wish I could have been there oh I wish I could have seen something like that the power of God consuming the sacrifice and everybody saw it and they fell down on their faces with their faces on the pavement and even the ministers couldn't minister because the glory of the Lord was there can you imagine can you imagine seeing something like that I would have loved to have seen it to see how important that this was the reverence that was there the sacredness of that Temple and then could you imagine if somebody walked up to this Temple during this time pulled out a sledgehammer or a can of lighter fluid sprayed it on the temple or took a sledgehammer and was just ready to take a chunk out of it can you imagine what would you do if one of your friends went up to do that with the power of God here and the sacredness of this Temple they're like whoa whoa Whoa man don't what are you doing don't don't do that well I don't like the way the pillars are the pillars aren't exactly right and and these Stones how they're all placed they're not placed right they should have used Limestone and instead of ground they should have they should have changed the shape of the stones wait a minute that is God's Temple what are you doing he will strike you dead don't you remember Aaron's sons he's God don't touch that leave it alone be careful that is God's Temple it's sacred before God remember the god of the Old Testament brother Dan he's the god of the New Testament too and he said I am God and I change not he's the same God that something happened when he sent his son thank God for that but don't forget he's still the same God I'm building this up because I want to get to a scripture that brother Lyle spoke about last on Wednesday First Corinthians chapter 3. we we see this man this woman friend whoever it might be come to the temple spray lighter fluid on it maybe the light of match take a hammer to it say I hate it I don't want it think about what would have happened to that person what would you have done brother Joe if that was one of your children what would you have done if it was your friend what would you have done I've done everything I could to stop them don't do it don't touch that Temple it's sacred First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 9. that Temple is gone today there's the Temple mount the Muslim Dome of the Rock the Muslim Dome of the Rock sits there now in the place probably where Solomon's Temple was it was after Solomon came it fell into disrepair they fixed it up somebody Nebuchadnezzar came he tore it down they you know they tried to rebuild it again it was a building but as the glory of the Lord that made it important First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 9. for we are laborers together with God ye are God's husbandry ye are God's Building today that Temple is you and me it's alive it's Lively Stones it's not dead it's not it's not a bunch of rocks piled up making a building it's alive it's it's flesh and blood skip to verse 16. no ye not that ye you are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you read it again know ye not that ye are the temple of God and the spirit of God dwelleth in you something happened as I send this as I said the Son of God came he promised that this Same Spirit The Same Spirit that came down and burnt the sacrifice the temple the same God that came down in the pillar of Fire came down on 120 people in the upper room after Jesus said he had left and he said I will send my spirit and he did and then those people became that temple of God and that's what Paul here is referring to let's continue on If any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is Holy which Temple ye are you say it again for the temple of God is Holy which Temple ye are first Peter chapter 2 it says that we are those stones those living stones that that make the temple and Jesus himself is the Cornerstone he's the one that you start at and then you build up this Temple and Paul goes on Paul says he says you're the temple of God and that God's spirit dwells in you and he says that if anyone defiles that Temple then God will destroy that math remember Aaron's sons remember the guy that goes up that I made up the guy that goes up with the hammer and he's going to hit the stone in the temple he's going to desecrate that Temple remember that guy I don't want to be that guy you know we think about that we are that Temple and if we if what I've read is true and what Paul said is true which it is that we are that temple of God then friends how careful should we be in speaking against each other are you with me how careful should we be in saying one word against that temple of God no matter how much we don't think that they're right or like the guy that uh wanted to hurt that wanted to break down the temple it's not built the way I think it should be built they don't believe the way that I think they should believe and we go and we attack that we come against it and we speak against it and I think Lord why am I not dead me Daniel Evans why am I still breathing how am I still alive when I see Aaron's sons they just made a little mistake and how much have I done why aren't there dead people all over the place blood of Christ has stayed God's Wrath but friends we have to get there and I've always wondered Lord how can we you know I talked about a place to go to church I've wondered Lord how can we get there I want a church that has miracles I want a church where the sinner can come to the altar I want a church that's just so filled with love even it's five people I want to have that I want that and I thought Lord how can that ever be and I thought for years Lord how could that ever be but now I see you know what it can be it can be if the fear of God would be in our hearts not just not just wanting to do right but fear God to say that if we destroy that temple of God if we destroy that person if we speak against him God it's a promise God will destroy us how careful we should be let's turn to Titus there's a there's a place in numbers and I wanted to preach on today I was reading Stephanie and I were reading it yesterday man it was It was a serious altercation between Moses and Cora and dathan and it was an intense it was an intense conflict I don't have time maybe I'll do it maybe next week I'll talk about that but in saying that Cora and dathan and these ones that were Moses with Moses they influenced others against the servant of the Lord they were the ones that were the aggressors Moses was like hey don't do that just believe God they were the ones attacking all the time and I'll tell you next time I preach what happens to them and it wasn't good Titus chapter 3. this is a faithful saying and these things I will that thou affirm constantly that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works these things are good and profitable unto men but avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and strivings about the law for their unprofitable and vain a man that is a heretic after the first and second admission admonishment admonition reject let me read the English Standard Version of that says this remember the King James version I love it it's the absolute for me it's it's so inspired but English has changed over the God's word doesn't change but English has changed over the past 300 years it says this verse 9 but avoid foolish controversies and genealogies dissensions and quarrels about the law for they are unprofitable and worthless as a person as for a person who stirs up division after warning him once and then twice have nothing more to do with him stirring up division it doesn't say that about homosexuality it doesn't say that about murder it doesn't say that about about fornication it doesn't say that about these dark sins that we think are so dark it says that person that stirs up division worn them twice and then cut them off this is New Testament that's how careful we should be so careful we should be in about speaking about each other we should love one another go to battle for one another scares me to death you know I think about I read I've read these scriptures I was like Lord I'm guilty I am guilty I don't be guilty anymore no more Lord forgive me for for anything that I've said I didn't know now I know I don't want any anything coming out of my mouth against anybody be careful remember what I said the god of the Old Testament is the same God that when we sing Amazing Grace and we're raising our hands he's the same one he hasn't changed he was a loving God before he's loving God now he was a god of judgment before he's a god of judgment now be careful negativity negativity spreads and it does damage every word that we say should come through the Holy Spirit filter love one another and never say a bad word about anyone I don't think that our church necessarily has a problem with that that's not why I'm saying that about this Tabernacle um itself but the world has a problem with it therefore we have an issue with it it's everywhere and we need to be careful we look so often there's some people that are easy to attack like our president you know and it's aggravating the things that are doing we see this country we see this country just going off a cliff because of these policies but yet be careful even speaking against him we should watch our tongue be careful talking against them ain't going to do any good but it could hurt us you know you say brother Daniel um you know God's Gonna God's Gonna destroy me for for something that that's not even that important if it's not that important then don't say it you're with me it's not it's it's more important that we're right with God amen yes speaking about these things in Jude verse 8 says this likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh despise Dominion speak evil of dignities Yet Michael the Archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses does not bring against him a really railing accusation but said the Lord rebuked thee but these speak evil of those things which they know not but what they know naturally as brute beasts in those things they corrupt themselves woe unto them for they have gone the way of Cain and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward and perished in the gain sayings of Korah you know the most evil King I can think of in the Bible there's a lot of bad ones but one of the worst was Nebuchadnezzar that guy he was a killer he came in he's the one that destroyed that Temple that I was talking about before the natural Temple came in he gouged the eyes out of the king's Sons and then or the king I mean killed his sons in front of him awful awful person but yet this Bible when God was speaking about Nebuchadnezzar says the strangest thing brother Wilson it says my servant Nebuchadnezzar wow we've got to be careful be careful when we speak even against Joe Biden or Donald Trump or or whoever it is we have raised the bar and one day Jesus Christ will return for a bride he will return and what will that bride be acting like that bride will be this book in flesh that bride if it says walk this line she walks that line you know um I mentioned the saying the other day aim small Miss small she's going to be aiming small so when we miss it's all right we'll get back on we'll get back on the on the trail we'll get back on the target but that bride when God when Jesus returns she's going to be walking the walk she's going to be talking The Talk second Peter chapter 9. I'm chapter two I'm sorry verse 9. the Lord knoweth how to deliver The Godly out of Temptations and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished but chiefly them that walk after the Flesh and the lust of uncleanness and despise government presumptuous are they self-willed they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities whereas Angels which are greater in power and might bring not railing accusations accusations against them before the Lord wow even the angels they're not talking about about their enemies they're not talking bad about them but these As Natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed speak evil of things that they understand not and shall utterly perish in their own corruption and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness as they that counted pleasure to Riot in the daytime spots they are and blemishes supporting themselves with their own deceivings while they Feast with you right in Among Us communion table maybe Fellowship friends they're right here and I don't want to be that I don't want to be one of those negative people you know I've I've done it like I said I shouldn't be alive today I should not be here if if God judged me which he will only by the grace of God and the blood of Jesus Christ in my life today but I thank God for his son I thank God for Jesus I thank God that that he sent somebody to bring this scripture alive in this day a man that loved the Lord and people would come to the platform sick and be healed because he believed he was an example to us but let me tell you something the man I'm speaking about is William Branham you know what he preached Jesus he please you've tried to find me a taper he tried to find me a page that he didn't he didn't preach the Lord Jesus you can't find it it's because he is the one Jesus Christ is the one and Lord let me stand for him that's the bridegroom that's the one I'm loyal to I love him so much and I thank him Lord I see you in this Old Testament and it scares the liver out of me it does I mean I'm it scares me to death and in the New Testament goes and says the same thing by the grace of God thank you Lord I'm one of your people I'm one of your servants I read it here I'm going to do it I'll fail I don't want to jinx myself but I'm a human I'm a fail but I'm going to try I'm going to do a better job I am thank God you know I I don't know if we're recording or not but uh like I said I want to just make it a little bit more personal is I left voice of God Recordings because they didn't agree but let me tell you something there's two sides no matter how thin you slice it there's always two sides and with with Brother Joseph Branham and I love him and and I don't agree with him but but there's two sides he may be on this side I'm on that side but we're the same piece of bread and we love the same Lord Jesus I will never and you never heard me and nor will you ever hear me say anything negative about where I come from because it's been a it's been a blessing to me and I'm for these men of God you'll never hear me speak about a negative word about brother Donnie Reagan or brother Eddie Biscoe or any of these Great Men of God even though I don't know but even though I may not agree with him like I don't know if I do or not I don't know them all enough but even if I do doesn't matter like I said we're the same piece of bread we love the same Lord Jesus and then this body this body is God's Temple I know he's got my back he does he says whoever comes against you all destroy he's got my back but I also remember that he's got your back too and I don't ever want to be guilty of saying anything against anyone amen don't you love our lord Jesus don't you love how good he is his mercies that Temple that came down that Temple that was built seven years in the making how perfect he was and then God came down and oh I would have loved to been there but I'm here today and I get to be that Temple and I want to take care of it I want to make sure that it's not the filed I want to make sure that I am living for the Lord I'm going to end a little bit early I have a lot more notes I think that's enough you know I I'm just I'm grateful sister hope I don't know where you are if you could if you could come to the piano there you are um I'm grateful I'm grateful for each one of you you know I look and each one of us is a stone in that Temple and every one of them is different but am I going to look at this Stone over here because it's a different shape than me or it has a different perspective that me I may be on this side of the corner it may be on that side of the corner it may be looking East I may be looking South but it's still a stone in the temple and I'm no more important than that stone a one stone that's important is that Cornerstone and that's the Lord Jesus and friends with the love that our God has for us it's the same love that needs to come out of us and I want to think all of us to think Lord I want to serve you better I want to be a better Christian I want to be better and as I'm as I'm speaking if you're thinking about all the people that have done you wrong and you are that stone and you know God has your back you're wrong in thinking that what you should be thinking about is what you have said about others and you should have that repentive sweetheart and say Lord forgive me for that I want to do better I want to be what this word wants me to be amen you raise your hand if you want to be that I want to be it with all my heart I'll close with something I've talked a little bit about brother Branham I want to close with something that he said says this oh how wonderful how glorious I know that he's present oh I wished you felt like I do I know you think I may look silly but I'm not you may think that I don't know where I am but I do oh it is the spirit of the Living God I just can't preach no more there's something The Joy bells of Glory has just set in on me I never had it happen like that there's just something I know there is coming a Time there's coming something that's going to take place I see it in the near future the spirit of the Living God falling fresh on his church there's going to be something take place I hear a sound in the mulberry bushes something just spoke to my heart listen to the prophet prophesied something just spoke to my heart and said fear not preacher there'll be one one of these days one with each other one with Christ there'll be one one of these days they'll believe it may take persecution and things to drive us together but God will drive his church together just as certain as I'm standing in this Pulpit under one that's Christ Christ will be the head no denomination will be the head Christ will be the head of every believer Hallelujah amen can we all say we believe that friends I hope know that I wasn't trying to correct any certain person I'm preaching from my heart I'm correcting myself I want to be right and I pray that as as I as I'm ministering I pray that you see you know what I I am too I want to be brother Daniel I want to be that too I want to be that one that that this word talks about you know when this word ends Revelation chapter 22. you know who's speaking I'll read it to you Revelation chapter 22 at the end I can quote it by heart but I figured it'd be good to just to read it right out of the book it says this revelation 22 17 and the spirit that's the bra that's the Holy Spirit and the spirit and the bride say come the bride is calling out to the bridegroom come the holy spirit is saying come amen let's let's all bow our heads come down foreign just think friends how good Jesus is to you how good he is to me how good he's been to our families he's allowed us to live and some of the things that that we've done we would have been struck down before the blood of Christ was shed but now it's shed and we're grateful for forgiveness we bring up before him these prayers and don't ever think that he doesn't hear your prayers he has his time to answer whether it be a child or brother a sister or mom or dad sickness whatever it is friends if you've brought your request before Jesus he will answer and he heard them just think about him for a minute as the sister plays just love him make sure you know him Lord love you so good to us you're so loving oh Lord we thank you pray
