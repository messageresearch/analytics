much plan on fellowshipping with my son Daniel my my daughter meline my wife for all of eternity and we have a promise if we will give our hearts to the one who is worthy the Lord Jesus Christ then we can claim those promises it's good to see everyone in the house of the Lord today um it's a it's a bit of a odd day I'd say just uh some of the things that have happened I I mentioned on uh on my WhatsApp broadcast that that um that there were some articles coming out just about uh some of the the various churches number one is Golden Dawn Tabernacle and uh I know that there are many of you that have uh maybe some roots in that church and um I uh brothers and sisters I've heard pastors say oh don't don't read that stuff if you want to read it read it what are you afraid of I'm not afraid of anything I'm proud of of my walk with the Lord Jesus I'm proud of our church and there's no fear in in me I'm doing my best to teach this book and and I want to stay with it um then this morning this came out on the on the front page of our newspaper here and uh I haven't read it but I assume it's it's what has been on the uh on the Facebook page um it says readymade for abuse fringed Christian SE sect Sprouts dis destructive Cults worldwide you know one of the things about this when brother Brandon was alive he was on the front page of many newspapers but there was no Scandal it was more saying that he got some of the biggest um religious gatherings that were ever in the United States or or tens of thousands of people in South Africa and all of these testimonies and I ask now it's led to this after he's dead been gone for decades why why has it come to this when he was here it was Miracles and and wonders and and praises and and unity and and now something's changed let me tell you it's not this man's fault and another re another thing that I say I don't think it's even the reporter's fault that that post that that wrote this they don't know something has changed and I ask you and you can ask yourself what has changed why is now this name associated with Scandal and before it was associated with truth what's happened since he's been gone what's happened something that that we need to consider in ourselves we need to we need to ask that question what has happened it's not his fault I tell you if you want to hear what he said listen to him because of all these strange things that have popped up and and and led people astray and cause hurt and cause problems and it was not his fault I hold the newspaper up this morning's newspaper and it is Scandal what has happened in the past 60 years 70 years that has hurt people what has happened and I think we should ask ourselves that that and and read those articles if you want to read them and you'll see you know I read I read them and it's like you know I don't agree with that and uh this I read them because there's people here that that have come from um that church that uh has um have suffered in certain ways um but my God who we just prayed to is Jesus Christ and I believe that same Jesus Christ LED brother brandom when he preached from this this very pulpit and this very building I believe it was the same God I believe it was the same God that healed the sick 2,000 years ago that healed the sick 3,000 4,000 years ago it's the same God that healed the sick 60 70 years ago God hasn't changed he loves us he loves people he heals the sick he he he he he saves the Lost he hasn't changed but we take things and we change them I'm going to be teaching on the Book of James today and we're going to start in a series I don't know how long I'm going to get into James chapter 1 but it's it's a tremendous book the book of James is is a book that that is not so much teaching us who Jesus is like most of the other Epistles like the APO like the uh the gospels the Book of James is teaching us now that you know now put it into action it's the next level and I thought for our church and as I'm praying about Lord what what do you want me to bring how can I how can I bless the people how can I get them closer to you how can I get that relationship better between you and them and it's time maybe to take a step forward in our lives take a step forward as a church and and put these things that we've learned put them into practice into your personal life this book of James it was written by by all accounts uh it was written by the half brother of the Lord Jesus and uh there's there's James that um we watched The Chosen last night there's the James and the chosen there's going to be a couple of them and uh no it's not it's not those Brothers it's not the disciples it's not there's another brother there's another James mentioned in the book of Acts this is most likely and almost Surly the half brother of Jesus Christ it's um the probably the son of Mary and Joseph now the Catholic Church te teaches that Mary was a Perpetual virgin she she um married Joseph but she stayed a virgin for the rest of her life um I don't necessarily think that that's that's right I think that Joseph and Mary probably had children afterwards because the Bible names that is this not Jesus who is the brother of of these ones James is one of them and he even had at least one sister that we know of so this this James is not only the brother of Jesus but he is also the pastor of the very first Christian Church that was ever formed this church at Jerusalem and James was the pastor he was a man of great Authority and he writes this book it's probably this epistle is probably the very first epistle ever written that we have record of it's it's before Paul's Epistles predates those the earliest epistle probably two or three years and it's it's sent to these people that have already accepted Jesus Christ as their savior they he's it's his audience is Jewish people that have given their life to the Lord Jesus we would call them maybe they Messianic Jews or back then maybe Jews that were converted they were the first converts in the anyways they were the first Believers of Jesus were the Jewish people and this is who that book is written to it's not WR written to the novice it's written to to people that that are anchored they're anchored in the word of God and and they're Anchored In Jesus Christ they have given their lives over to to the Lord now there's this man that we all know named Martin Luther who uh over 500 years ago he uh was a was a great great man of God As We Know Martin Luther's opinion of the Book of James was that it shouldn't even be included in the Bible he U he called um the the straw epistle I believe is is what he called it basically that it wasn't inspired and the reason that Martin Luther said that this book of James wasn't inspired the reason that I think is because it didn't match his Doctrine now remember Martin Luther was a great man and a uh a a great scholar of the world the word far greater than I'll ever be but well when I say but three letter letter word is the whole definition of that three-letter word is to contradict what you just said now I'm a Christian but now I like going to church but I like this person but now this person's a very nice person but and here here is my take on Martin Luther he was a great scholar of garden far better than I I could ever be but he was wrong on this and he what had happened is Martin Luther came out of the Catholic Church the Catholic church was a very much a works-based religion and it was that you can pay for what they called Indulgence or you can you can pay for your sins you can do so many Hail Maries and and have those sins absolved it was it was Works based now the Catholics wouldn't say that but the proof is in the pudding it it is very much a works-based religion and Martin Luther says Hey I just came out of this stuff and now I'm reading this book of James and James is saying that you have to do that there has to be works it doesn't match my Doctrine so he just threw it out and we have to be careful in doing that just because something may not match our Doctrine may not agree with the way that we've learned we don't do like Luther didn't just throw it out pray about it set aside you you're you're thinking and say Lord what what is this now Martin Luther we don't throw out what Martin Luther did he was the greatest man of his age I mean he wrote a list of 95 things of how the Catholic church was wrong he wrote put him down took it and nailed it to the church great man and every one of those 95 things that that I see it I agree with every single one that he wrote but Martin Luther I didn't want my sermon to be about that word but I got to stop saying that and now I forgot what I was going to say but Martin Luther said that the Jews were the Antichrist I don't agree with that Martin Luther said many things Martin Luther was a firm hardcore trinitarian so it was John Wesley I don't agree with that either but just because I don't agree with certain things that Martin Luther said I don't just throw out Martin Luther I don't just throw out what he did as I said one of the greatest men that has ever walked the Earth Martin Luther stood up for what was right in the the regime of the Catholic Church wanted to kill him wanted to burn him at the stake because he made a stand saying no you cannot these these prayers for the for your sins this is not right the just shall live by faith and not by works is what Martin Luther said we heard brother nol Johnson talk about habac um on Wednesday Martin Luther was quoting habac when he says the just shall live by faith and that was his Doctrine but I don't throw out Martin Luther's words just because his thoughts on the Jewish people or just because of his thoughts on the Trinity Martin Luther was still a great man and brothers and sisters we have to be careful like in this this article there are are things that have been done wrong but don't throw it all out I don't throw out Jesus Christ because of all the the priests that have molested children I don't throw out Martin Luther because he said that because the Jews crucified Jesus that they were the Antichrist I don't throw out John Wesley because he preached the father Son and Holy Ghost as the the Oneness of God I don't I don't throw those Brothers out because of that they did great things and we need to be careful that we don't just throw something out because you find something something wrong with it we are people every person that has ever walked this earth except for one makes mistakes everyone has aired everyone has done things wrong with the exception of the man Jesus Christ so don't throw things maybe that I say out because I might make a mistake look at my heart and look at look at what I say and look at my love for the congregation same thing with with with William brandom don't throw out what he said just because there there are some things that that may be perceived problems he was a great man of God and God honored him so don't don't the these things as I said brother brandom he was on the front page of many many newspapers 60 70 years ago and what has happened in all of that time because now his name is associated with Scandal and before his name was associated with healing with love with salvation think about that think about that if you if you read these articles think about why that has happened and think about my heart brothers and sisters let's get back to this book Let's Get get back to this this is what brother Brandon preached God honored it this is what Martin Luther preached God honored it this is what the Great Men of old have preached and God honored it that's why it's really important to me I really feel feel like the Lord has been working on my heart to Let's really dig in to many of these books of the Bible and this book of James it really is it is a powerful book people say well well well we're tied about just the ABCs we want to know algebra you want to know algebra we're going to hear it and that's the Book of James the ABCs always believe Christ that's when you you get you get introduced to the Lord Jesus and and he changes your life and then there is a time now don't just stay right there you don't just stop right there you keep going don't be satisfied with the person that you are don't be satisfied with your current walk with the Lord your life should be a journey of events that serve a purpose to make you a better Christian and a series of events that give you a better understanding of who God is that's how your life should be and when James is as he's going through he's telling his audience hey yeah you're good you've you've accepted the Lord you've been baptized you you've had an experience and now you need to step it up in your life he he talks about that in this first per this first um chapter and he also says and I hope that we get to it he also tells us that Temptation that's not a sin it's acting on the Temptation that's a sin and and he and he he says that just because you suffer trials also it doesn't make you righteous just because you're suffering trials but you can take those trials that you suffer and those trials will make you a better person the um James's goal as I said it really isn't to teach a new theology James's goal is to get into your personal life and to make you a better person I um we were talking I was talking with the um the kids last night um when after we watched The Chosen I want to I always want to see what uh what's on their mind and we were talking about how important worship is and and the different songs that that mean a lot to the kids and um one of the songs that came up is a song that that we sing often in church and it's um song I was made for more and I want to read the lyrics of that song and uh and let me see I really think that the brother who wrote this probably read the book of James it says this I know who I am because I know who you are thank you the cross of salvation was only the start pause there and think about that that line the cross of Salvation that was only the start so many times we stop right there you come to the altar you have an experience with God you give your life over to God and then your testimony stops right there this it should not this should be a journey this should be a constant infilling this should be constantly getting closer with God constantly moving forward because if you just stop right there if you just stop and know that Jesus Christ is a savior and he's God later on we're going to hear that James says yeah you know the Devils believe that also there's more says now I am chosen free and forgiven I have a future and it's worth a living cuz I wasn't made to be tending in graved I was called by name born and raised back to life again again I was made for more so why would I make a bed in my shame when a Fountain of Grace is running my way I know I am yours and I was made for more and if you want to see the theme of James we were we were made from more so the the James is saying now let's get moving with this book of James chapter 1 verse one says this James a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ to the 12 tribes which are scattered abroad greetings so James's letter is to the Jews as I said to the Jews that have accepted Jesus as the Messiah and their atonement for sin so the sacrifice they know now that this sacrifice that that was made for all of these years now has been made once and for all with this sinless Lamb of God named Jesus they understand that and this it's this letter is sent out to the dispersion to the to these Jews that have gone out if you if you um were in our Bible study with the book of Acts you saw that there's all of these different groups of Jewish people throughout galatia and and and these different places and this letter is meant to go out to all of them I think it's beautiful that that this man James he knew that his letter was going to be copied and copied and copied and distributed and he has that much faith in what he wrote to send this to basically everyone um and it uh really that James is encouraging us and encouraging the the reader let's put this faith in action and I've said this before and I believe that the greatest deception that Satan has accomplished in this day is to be make people think that they are a Christian to think that they have received a new birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost when all they have done is they've had an experience or been baptized or made a confession I think that should make us all think Lord is that me me I believe that I did have an experience and I go back to that experience but Lord did my testimony stop at that experience or has it moved forward there's a in my house in Jeffersonville um there was a place that was by the back door and under the stairwell that um plant grass in my backyard and I mow my grass and the grass would never grow in that spot and it would never grow in that spot because there was always it was always in the shade even in the middle of the summer in the middle of summer it would get a little bit of sun and it would come up a little bit but as soon as the days got a a little bit longer the the grass would die there and it's because it never was in the right atmosphere to grow it never got Sun it was the same grass over here but that's with with a Christian you have to be in the right atmosphere to grow you have to put yourself in that right atmosphere to open your arms and let this Sun come down and and grow that seed when a Temptation or trial comes along all of a sudden it's there's death there there's no more it just when the when the darkness is there it just falls apart my brethren counter all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing a temptation is sin Jesus himself a Temptation I'm sorry a temptation is not sin Jesus himself the Son of God was tempted in every manner of sin yet he always overcame unlike us he was tempted by Satan himself in the wilderness his enemies talked about his mother accused her of sleeping with a Roman soldier and that's how Jesus was was conceived is what they said I mean you couldn't you couldn't insult a young lady more than that not only was it was it um having a a child out of wedlock and and sleeping around before wedlock but it was sleeping with a very unclean person called a gentile called a heathen accused his mother of horrible things and yet he kept his testimony he suffered sickness he suffered pain he felt emotion when his friend Lazarus died and yet he never sinned he overcame every Temptation and when we now James is saying and Jesus also now when we feel that same tempt temption we are required to also overcome that Temptation and it's not brothers and sisters as I said feeling the Temptation isn't sin but it's acting on that Temptation I'm going to get to that that shortly let's go to um let's just continue on back to James 1 um if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that giveth all men that giveth to all men liberally and abrath not and it shall be given him now James's writing style it's often called the New Testament Book of Proverbs James's writing style is he's kind of all over the place but he's great for onliners just like Proverbs is so so with James you can a lot of times take him out of context and just quote it and a lot of the the the things that James said should be put into our memories and and remembered that we can use those later on so he's saying here let patience feed your growth in the Lord and let's go back let's go to to let's go to verse five now if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally and abrath not and it shall be given to him so he's saying let patience feed your growth in the Lord and if you lack wisdom if you lack if your lack of wisdom hinders your walk with the Lord if you say something wrong all of the time you're constantly saying things that you regret and you need to learn to be quiet rather than opening your mouth which is many many the time many the case of of all of of many of us then pray for these things Abraham Lincoln it was sometimes it's a tested Abraham Lincoln sometimes Mark Twain but but it's said this it's better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove move all doubt so we it is best many times to remain silent and if you keep making the same mistake and you keep praying that God deliver you from making this mistake then there's something wrong with your prayer that if you're not willing to do it if you just say well Lord I I'm just trying just I'm asking the Lord to deliver me from always saying foolish things or I'm asking the Lord to deliver me from always losing my temper well what are you doing about it you're asking the Lord with no faith come on you have something to do you just are feeling bad because you do the same thing over and over it's not God's fault you need to step up the Bible says that he won't tempt you greater than you can bear so there's no temptation that can come to you that you are not able to reject and then when the Temptation Rises to speak foolishly or to make a decision that you haven't prayed through to to maybe make a purchase that you shouldn't make have Hazard Le or to to quit a job just be patient hold your tongue and let patience have her perfect work I know the high pressure sales all of us have been there their tactic is don't let this guy get out of the office or on the phone without giving you the credit card and that's what they want to say they're constantly saying well you know this my boss said that that this is a mistake and this deal is just for today just wait or this Black Friday deal man it's like I want that thing so bad and look at the good deal I I just I just want to buy it be careful let patience have perfect work you don't have to have it right now just wait pray about it and then make a a well-informed decision but let him ask in faith not wavering nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed if you're not asking in faith you're throwing out an insincere prayer really it's being a lazy Christian that you're just constantly putting these things on God and and you have to stop for a minute and sometimes time will go on and you'll be praying you'll be praying about something Lord Lord I I want to I want to stop doing this or I want you to help me doing this a year will pass by and then sometimes it's 10 years and then 20 years and 30 years and you're going to be 40 50 60 years old and you're still praying about the same things that you prayed about when you were a kid and you're still making the same mistakes it's because the prayers that are going up are going up without faith you're not willing to do your part and not do these things let's continue on with James James 1:6 the um English Standard Version says this but let him ask in faith with no doubting for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind he's all over the place when he's asking these things he's serving God and then he's sinning and then he's serving God again and then he's sinning I knew a guy that that was uh this guy was one of the best people that I've ever met in being able to remember the scriptures and give and and quote scriptures and apply scriptures to certain things and he'd always anytime there was a group of people after church he was always there and he was always the one after service really preaching and and really talking and and quoting the scriptures and and really putting them together well and then he would come up missing for a month and then he'd come back and everybody'd be like well where's I'm not going to say his name but where you wouldn't know him but where is this guy you know he's he's been um I haven't seen him in a while and then it came out that the brother was a meth addict and he would go on these binges and be out for a while and lose 20 or 30 pounds and then come back what good was his Doctrine when he had that sin in his life if it was like a it was like a boat just being tossed and and turned in the wind he he was back and and forth and do you think his Doctrine was sound with this sin in his life it wasn't for let not that man let not that man think that he shall receive anything of God you're up and you're down but you can't expect your prayers to be answered because you're not praying with faith verse number eight a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways it means that not only are you double-minded when you can't control your temper when you can't control your tongue but you're also double-minded in your prayers you're double-minded in your spiritual walk just as you're double-minded in your natural walk says here you're double- minded in all of your ways it doesn't say just in in your sin just in the world if there is sin in your life if you're constantly going back to the same well of sin that double-mindedness manifests itself in all of your ways first Peter I'll read 1 Peter chapter 4 verse 1 for as much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind the same mind as what it's the same mind as Christ the NIV translation says arm yourself with the same attitude as Christ ESV says the same way of thinking as Christ for he hath suffered In the Flesh and has ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of God for the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles when we walked in lasciviousness lust and excess of wine revelings banquetings and ab abominable idolatries all of these things that are sin you you're double-minded that's not the mind of Christ wherein they think that it's strange that you run not with them to the same excess of Riot speaking evil of you so you don't sin anymore you don't do these things wrong anymore so then people think you're weird because you don't do it anymore they think it's strange who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead time cycle let's go back to James let not the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted but the rich in that he is made low because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away I'm gonna I'm going to um go through this this fairly quickly because I want to get to the main point here in James but he's saying that that this rich man that may have have an e easy life and have all that he wants when he comes into hardship when trouble hits his life let him thank the Lord for it that he has had troubles that that he has made lower and then let the poor person also rejoice in that they have been chosen by God to believe his word what great G Rich riches could we have than be chosen to believe God's word there's no greater riches the rich man's up here and he's saying that Lord I Thank you for all my trials the rich Christian I thank you for all my trials I thank you what for what you've done for me because it humbled me and I look back and I'm a better person now that I went through this trial and the poor man is saying Lord thank you so much that you chose me to be one of your children to one of your your your Believers for the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat but withereth the grass and the flower falleth therefore falleth and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth so also shall the rich man Fade Away in his bless in his ways blessed is the man that endureth Temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord hath promised to them that love him let no man say when he is tempted I am tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away key thing here when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death so mouthful there what he's saying is when you start entertaining these thoughts that are in your mind of sin whatever would be it might be adultery it might be a lie it might be hatred when you start entertaining these thoughts they eventually become no longer thoughts anymore they become Deeds d David King David he was up on his rooftop his warriors were out fighting a battle and David was out and he looked down and he saw a woman bathing and he he looked at her and there was the temptation of David wasn't sin yet there was the Temptation David should have turned his head and went back in but that Temptation started up in David and it was just like a little little spark and instead of going out and letting the spark go out David looked in the thoughts in David's mind he must have thought well been attracted to this woman he must have entertained the thoughts and then eventually those thoughts became deeds and he sent for her to come to him and the thoughts that were in David's mind manifested themselves into the actual act in sin and then When sin was mature then it it created more sin and David when when the husband of this this woman that he had an affair with he he brings him back and he wants to cover up what he did he sends the man the man won't follow what David David said to cover up his deeds with his wife and it was it was a she conceived when she had the affair with David and he brought the husband back so that they would think that it was his baby or he would think that it was his baby when he wouldn't do it when he wouldn't be with his wife David sent him back out and look at how that sin went into another sin and David had the man murdered and it was all from entertaining those thoughts and you you look at it and and you start it starts with just a little spark and you have some dry tendering there you're starting a fire and or or you just have a spark there and that spark is sin and if you would just let it go out if you just leave it it'll go out but instead your thoughts start going and you you start blowing on it those are your thoughts those are entertaining that sin in your mind could be hatred doesn't have to be adultery it could be anything right and you look and and you you're you're you're you're thinking about this and then maybe you you talk with your wife or with your husband or your brother or your sister and says you know this guy he he he did this to me and can you believe it it's just [Music] you're blowing on that fire you're putting the oxygen in it and you're you're just from the the Deeds that you're doing you're starting to make it grow and eventually it grows and it grows and it grows and it becomes a full flame and now you're full both feet into sin and that's where David was when he committed adultery it started with just Him looking he couldn't help that he saw he couldn't help that the Temptation was there that wasn't sin but when he let it go in his mind same thing with Cain Cain was upset at his as brother he he made his Altar and he had this beautiful Altar and Abel over here he had his Altar and God chose Abel's Altar and Cain was offended and it started in his mind and he let it s settle in his mind he let that hatred settle and there he is as he's thinking about it he's he's blowing on this fire and it's starting to build and then it manifests itself until he was so angry with his brother he was so jealous that he killed him Jesus said he said that if you just hate he said you you've talked about the law says that if you murder someone you are in danger of judgment he says that if you just hate your brother that you're in danger of that judgment he said that he said that yeah you've said that that you commit adultery and you're you are you have committed adultery and you're in danger of judgment he said but if you just want to have an affair on your spouse then you have committed adultery already you're allowing that to go in your mind you're giving it a place in your mind you're allowing the temptation to stay there and then as it goes it will build and build and build and then it will manifest itself in sin if you let those thoughts stay in your mind if you let that Temptation stay and that seed it'll remain dormant until it it sees the right conditions and then it'll Sprout the seed of sin it'll Sprout and then it has to have the right conditions to grow and that's when we as Sinners we give it the right condition to grow even if it sprouts cut it off right when you see it step away from it say Lord I'm sorry I was tempted by that I'm sorry I'm going to step away from it and as I said it could be talking it could be talking with your wife be on the way to church you know this person is really getting on my nerves or or this person said that and then you're just blowing on that fire and it's like well I should I should be able to talk to my wife you should but what are the words that you're saying is it maybe just blowing on the flame just don't say it just keep it back and keep it positive Philippians 4:7 says this in the peace of God which passees all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Jesus Christ your hearts and your minds finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure what ever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things then James here he follows his statement he's giving us correction here he's saying let don't let these things grow he says let patience have her perfect work don't let these things grow in your mind and he redirects the focus from the things of evil now he goes to the things of God in verse 16 James chapter 1 he says don't Heir my beloved brethren every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of Lights with whom is no variable neither shadow of turning of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures first fruits of his Creations that first fruits that is the first one to come ripe and he's saying that we should be those first ones to come right that we should be an example to others we we've talked before about the wave sheath the offering that was made I believe it's in Leviticus where the priest would take the first fruits of the Harvest and he'd wave it before the people and he's saying now this is what's to come Harvest is getting rip and that's how Jesus Christ was when he came he healed the sick and he and he treated people with love and he respected he respected the word and put the word into action and then the disciples did the same thing and here James is saying now we're the first fruits now you do this wherefore my beloved Brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath for the wrath of man worketh not righteous worketh not the righteousness of God anytime we lose our temper no no matter if you are right or wrong the anger of man does not work the righteousness of God never the Bible says that we should do nothing through Strife or vain Glory wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughty naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls that's that's old English let me let me read the NIV it says this therefore get rid of all moral filth and evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you which can save you the seed that I mentioned earlier it can be the seed of God or it can be the seed of the devil the little fire that I was talking about earlier that can either be God's seed that's in us or it could be that Temptation that's there and and you're going to see which one are you going to feed which one are are you going to put the the the fuel on which one are you going to give the oxygen to instead of of blowing on that fire that sin turn and start blowing on the fire that's from God start talking in the Right Way start praying start reading your Bible and then you then you are blowing and starting that fire for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face face in a glass that word glass is mirror for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetthe know what what the pastor said that's right I'm doing that wrong I need to do a better job or you you'll come to a revelation say I need to do I need to step it up in my life and this way and this way and this way and then after after that happens like this morning I looked at I looked in the mirror and I was like wow my beard matches my suit and there I am standing and I I I forgot totally what I look like my thoughts are on something else and that's how we are when we look in this face of the go El when we look at at this face that it's in God's mirror and we see fault and we are condemned and we repent don't just leave and let that fade away and he's saying here that beholdeth he goeth his way and straight way he forgets what manner of man he was he forgets that sinner that he saw in church he forgets that sinner that he saw crying at the altar he forgets that person and he just goes right back slowly into the world and then looking in that in God's mirror didn't really take an effect but who so lookth into the perfect law of Liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed not just a hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in what he's doing if any man among you seem to be religious then bridleth not his tongue but Bridle not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart this man's religion is vain same thing if you're if you're going about and and you see yourself and you see your faults and then you go right back and do them what good is your religion it's not doing any good it's vain pure religion and undefiled as this I love so I said I compared James to Proverbs and Solomon's writing I believe is Ecclesiastes Solomon says that this is the conclusion of the matter this is what it all means and here is the conclusion of the matter for the first chapter of the Book of James and it's not something that's hard to understand it's not something that you have to be a scholar to get to it's very simple pure religion and undefiled defiled before God and the father is this to visit the fatherless and the widows in their Affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world God has a special place in his heart for those that don't have parents God has a special place in his heart for those that don't have a dad don't forget about these young people don't forget about those that don't have both parents they were born into this situation this isn't a situation that they put themselves into reach out to those people James is saying right here he says pure pure religion is this to go to those people because they need help they need somebody to to put the arm around them they need somebody to give them a kind word they need this as I said they didn't put themselves in this situation and also to the widows God loves the widows why they didn't put themselves in that situation either at least most of them kidding they didn't put themselves in that situation either it wasn't their fault and they God wants us to reach out to those people he wants us to help the sisters give them a call sometime you know give them a dinner every once in a while in their honor give them some love tell them how much you appreciate them because they are important and they needed as I said they didn't create this situation and it's going to be said for for pretty much everything do something help these people that need help pure religion is this pure religion and undefiled before God and the father is to visit the the father fatherless and the widows in their Affliction to help those that need help and to give him and to keep himself unspotted from the world don't get caught up when those Temptations come into your mind don't let them stay don't get caught up into that don't give it a place in your mind don't let it manifest itself because one day that Temptation that you're allowing there one day it'll strike to life one day it'll start up and then you've fallen into sin and then it'll spread around you as it did with David musicians can come and we'll close James says I'll read another translation New Living Translation says this pure and genuine religion in the sight of God the father means caring for Orphans and widows in their distress and refusing to let the world corrupt you it's a simple gospel that's that's the the basis that's the meaning that's the conclusion of the matter that's the sum of all things serve God trust God serve his people and stay away from sin and this book of James I believe is is perfect timing that we are starting in this book of James and we see this newspaper article come out right now I mentioned it to you a couple weeks ago I said that they're they're starting to come out and if you read them maybe pray for those people that have been hurt but I'll tell you right now it's not brother Brandon it's not him that did those things it's not it's these scandals aren't from him these scandals are come from people that have taken the word and have Twisted it to serve themselves and to cause and have caused problems I'm not condemning anybody I don't know any of these people that are mentioned in these articles but I'm just what I'm saying is the one thing I do know for sure is the man that is featured on the front of this newspaper has been on the front of many many newspapers in the past and it was always a good thing and now anytime he's featured it's always a scandalous thing it's not his fault it's people that have gotten off of the word and presented the gospel in a way that isn't right and with James don't let the seed or the Ember Don't Let It Grow don't let a Temptation come into your mind you may want to you may say well I read these articles and I want to leave my church or I want to I want to just forsake all that don't forsake Christ stay with the Lord Jesus pray about it and and and choose a church that gets you closer to him a church that will stand upon the gospel and really stand upon the same thing that brother brandom stood on that's what's right God bless you Brothers

to you Peter he said you didn't get this from reading the just reading the book he says you didn't get this from being taught he said My Father which is in heaven revealed this to you and upon this Rock I will build my per my church not Peter not himself but upon the rock of revelation of who Jesus Christ is and I will build my rock upon that and I have that same Rock I'm standing on it I'm
