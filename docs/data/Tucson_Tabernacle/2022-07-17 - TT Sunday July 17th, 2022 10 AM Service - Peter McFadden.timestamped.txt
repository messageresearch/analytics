[50:26] and just
[50:27] god is good wherever we are whether
[50:29] we're here or halfway around the world
[50:33] his mercies are new every morning
[50:35] he never leaves us nor forsakes us he is
[50:38] a good god
[50:40] and
[50:41] uh
[50:42] just seeing him grant the desires of our
[50:44] hearts
[50:45] it's it's so so good and um
[50:49] brother aaron said well maybe you could
[50:51] share a little bit of a trip report and
[50:53] i'd like to maybe share some things
[50:55] sometimes but i don't feel to to really
[50:58] talk a lot about that but i want to show
[51:00] if possible just one picture
[51:02] and just one
[51:04] one thought that i have related to this
[51:06] picture
[51:07] and so while the brothers maybe could
[51:08] prepare to see if we can get that
[51:10] picture up i don't put it up just yet
[51:12] nope too late
[51:15] there we go there's a teaser
[51:17] a lot of you probably already know what
[51:18] that is
[51:20] um but here here's the thought that goes
[51:24] with this picture
[51:26] is
[51:27] we are in a battle
[51:30] whether we're here whether we're there
[51:31] whatever we do we're in a battle
[51:33] and we're near the end of the battle i
[51:36] do believe i do believe this battle has
[51:38] been raging for
[51:39] since i was
[51:41] before i was born
[51:42] but i believe we're we're coming to the
[51:45] culmination of all things we're coming
[51:47] to to the final victory
[51:50] we're getting
[51:52] we're getting close to something mighty
[51:55] and
[51:56] we don't battle against flesh and blood
[51:58] but we battle against principalities and
[52:00] powers
[52:01] and
[52:03] right now
[52:05] you're here
[52:07] you made an effort to draw near to god
[52:10] you're not here just to see people but
[52:12] you're here to hear from god
[52:14] you're here seeking him
[52:16] and the devil sees that you're here
[52:18] each one of you just like god sees each
[52:21] one of you that's here i don't know
[52:22] everybody but god knows everybody the
[52:24] devil sees you too
[52:25] and he's trying with everything that
[52:27] he's got
[52:28] to get you to turn on this
[52:31] to get you to walk away
[52:32] to get you to go back to the mud that
[52:35] you came from to get you to go to sin
[52:38] and and here's
[52:40] uh i'll just show this picture and and
[52:42] then we'll get to this little thought
[52:44] with the picture
[52:46] is uh let's let's show the picture and
[52:48] it's really
[52:49] one
[52:51] just if i could show one picture of the
[52:52] trip i'd show this because this was the
[52:55] thing that i i felt
[52:57] so privileged to see
[52:59] so privileged to be near
[53:01] is if you look there just over to the
[53:04] left-hand side of where lydia is
[53:06] that's what they think
[53:09] could be calvary
[53:11] the skull
[53:13] golgotha so if you look kind of just to
[53:15] the right of her shoulder you can see
[53:16] two
[53:17] depressions in the rock and those would
[53:19] be the eye sockets and then kind of in
[53:21] between them you can see where you might
[53:22] see a nose
[53:24] and so
[53:25] what they say is that they some people
[53:28] you know there's different opinions but
[53:30] a lot of people think
[53:31] that that's where they would have
[53:33] crucified him
[53:35] crucified our lord jesus would be at the
[53:37] foot of this
[53:40] hill and and uh
[53:44] you know what a place
[53:46] that you could let your mind go back to
[53:48] that day and and you could
[53:50] could just picture
[53:52] a small man
[53:55] with no beauty
[53:57] but just
[53:58] beating for you and me
[54:00] beating like no man's been beaten
[54:03] and and you could almost just
[54:05] you know we're there traveling we're
[54:07] happy but it's it's a
[54:09] somber place
[54:11] it's it's a
[54:12] i would say a holy irreverent place
[54:15] but then the thing that really surprised
[54:18] me you know i could see that before in
[54:20] my mind's eye
[54:22] i could see the cross in my mind's eye i
[54:23] could see the blood
[54:25] i could see the soldiers
[54:28] but what i never thought about until i
[54:30] got there which maybe you already knew
[54:33] but you can see behind us are buses
[54:37] this is all paved over
[54:39] and this is a bus parking lot
[54:42] this is where a lot of the the different
[54:44] buses to go to the different parts of
[54:46] the arab
[54:47] areas around there
[54:49] they
[54:50] the air people have a control over it
[54:51] and and they just decided
[54:53] let's pave over it let's just park a bus
[54:56] there
[54:57] and i thought wow
[54:59] that's
[55:00] you know what a what a
[55:03] what a thing to take
[55:04] this this place
[55:08] without comparison in the world
[55:10] and just drive over it
[55:12] drive over top of it
[55:15] and
[55:15] and it made me think if we can put up
[55:20] let's put up
[55:22] hebrews 10
[55:24] 26
[55:29] this isn't my text so i'll have you
[55:30] stand for the text this
[55:33] let's let's just read this
[55:36] and we'll read um
[55:40] read here
[55:42] it says for if we sin willfully
[55:46] if we were to listen to those voices
[55:49] tell us to go back
[55:51] to give up
[55:53] to turn around and
[55:55] you know when you repent you turn around
[55:57] and if you repent of that repentance
[55:59] you're back the same way you were going
[56:01] that's i believe what it's talking here
[56:04] is to go back
[56:07] it says if we sin willfully after that
[56:08] we've received the knowledge of the
[56:10] truth there remaineth no more sacrifice
[56:12] for sins
[56:13] because you've turned your back on the
[56:15] sacrifice but a certain fearful looking
[56:17] of for of judgment and fiery indignation
[56:21] which shall devour the adversaries
[56:24] he that despised moses law died without
[56:26] mercy under two or three witnesses
[56:29] now here we're getting
[56:31] to what i thought of about this bus
[56:33] says of how much sore punishment suppose
[56:36] you
[56:37] shall he be thought worthy who has trod
[56:38] and underfoot
[56:40] the blood
[56:41] the son of god and hath counted the
[56:43] blood of the covenant wherewith he was
[56:46] sanctified
[56:47] an unholy thing
[56:49] and hath done despite
[56:51] unto the spirit of grace
[56:54] and then let's let's jump down
[56:56] to the end
[56:58] it says
[56:59] in verse 38
[57:01] and we'll read 39
[57:05] it says now the just shall live by faith
[57:07] but if any man draw back
[57:10] my soul shall have no pleasure in him
[57:12] but we are not of them
[57:14] who draw back under perdition
[57:17] but of them that believe to the saving
[57:19] of the soul
[57:21] amen
[57:22] and so
[57:25] maybe you just can have that in your
[57:26] mind's eye that
[57:28] what we have is so precious
[57:31] what we have here
[57:34] you know i
[57:36] i couldn't imagine
[57:37] trampling
[57:39] that precious blood underfoot
[57:41] i wouldn't even want to park a bus on
[57:43] the spot where that blood was spilled
[57:47] but what god cares about
[57:50] way more
[57:51] than whether there's a bus there or not
[57:54] is whether you'll keep on keep up the
[57:57] good fight
[57:58] or whether you're turned back
[58:00] because if you turn back
[58:01] if you give up
[58:03] that's that's just the same as trampling
[58:05] that blood on your foot
[58:07] so i wasn't going to say any of that but
[58:09] maybe it's for somebody so just
[58:11] let's let's um let's just stand
[58:14] and we'll we'll go to my text here
[58:18] um let's go to ecclesiastes chapter 12
[58:22] and we'll read the last two verses of
[58:24] the book of ecclesiastes
[58:27] aren't you glad
[58:28] to be in the house of the lord
[58:30] it's a good place to be
[58:36] let's just pray one more time father
[58:39] have your way
[58:41] bless these words forgot to read and
[58:43] inspire the lord to our hearts that we
[58:45] could draw near to you in jesus name
[58:47] amen
[58:49] so here we have a conclusion of the
[58:51] whole matter let's hear it
[58:54] let us hear the conclusion of the whole
[58:55] matter
[58:56] fear god
[58:58] and keep his commandments
[59:00] for this is the whole duty of
[59:03] for god shall bring
[59:06] every work
[59:07] onto judgment
[59:09] with every secret thing whether it be
[59:10] good
[59:11] or whether it be evil
[59:13] and let's also go unto matthew
[59:17] chapter 10 verse 26
[59:19] i wanted to
[59:21] in this verse look at that every secret
[59:23] thing
[59:25] and then in matthew
[59:27] 10
[59:27] and 26 we'll read this one verse
[59:31] notice here in ecclesiastes it starts
[59:34] with fear god
[59:36] but then here it says fear them not
[59:38] therefore
[59:39] so we want to fear god but him alone
[59:42] but then here in matthew 10 26 it says
[59:44] fear them not therefore
[59:46] for there is nothing covered
[59:49] that shall not be revealed
[59:51] and hid that shall not be known
[59:53] amen you may be seated
[59:56] okay so help me out a little bit here
[59:59] i've got a lot of uh
[1:00:02] things
[1:00:03] written down and not a lot of time so
[1:00:05] just uh
[1:00:08] just in your heart say to the lord
[1:00:10] speak to me
[1:00:11] and then i don't have to get any of my
[1:00:14] idea of what should happen done but god
[1:00:17] can speak to you and then we can go home
[1:00:19] and that'll be good too all right
[1:00:25] so
[1:00:26] we heard in ecclesiastes
[1:00:28] that god's going to bring every work
[1:00:29] into judgment
[1:00:31] every secret thing whether it be good
[1:00:33] or evil
[1:00:35] and then here in matthew we find
[1:00:37] that there's nothing
[1:00:38] hidden
[1:00:40] or there's nothing covered that won't be
[1:00:42] revealed and hid
[1:00:43] that won't be known
[1:00:46] and that's
[1:00:48] those are are quite some statements
[1:00:51] and so my
[1:00:53] title this morning if i were to give a
[1:00:54] title would be a question
[1:00:57] and the question
[1:00:59] is a simple one
[1:01:00] it's what are you hiding
[1:01:03] so do we have any volunteers who wants
[1:01:04] to who wants to come up and tell us all
[1:01:07] your secrets maybe brother dave fritz uh
[1:01:10] you want to come up and uh tell us all
[1:01:12] yours no
[1:01:13] he doesn't want to okay anybody else no
[1:01:17] everybody has secrets
[1:01:19] good secrets bad secrets the people they
[1:01:21] helped that no one knows about the times
[1:01:24] that they
[1:01:25] maybe spent all night praying for
[1:01:27] somebody
[1:01:29] the sacrifices they've made for their
[1:01:31] family for their loved ones
[1:01:34] the
[1:01:36] things that they've done
[1:01:38] the things that they've done today
[1:01:40] some are secret
[1:01:44] but here we find that they're secret
[1:01:46] only for a time
[1:01:49] but that
[1:01:50] every every secret eventually comes out
[1:01:55] that there's a there's a time there's
[1:01:58] there's a
[1:02:00] final judgment
[1:02:02] and even
[1:02:03] you know in this
[1:02:04] in this time though we're not quite that
[1:02:06] final judgment you just find that in
[1:02:08] this time we're living
[1:02:10] there aren't secrets like there used to
[1:02:12] be
[1:02:13] there's um
[1:02:15] you're being watched by
[1:02:17] by the supernatural realm but you're
[1:02:19] also being watched by the natural realm
[1:02:22] and there's uh you're carrying most of
[1:02:24] your care and a microphone everywhere
[1:02:25] you go
[1:02:27] most of you walk by surveillance cameras
[1:02:30] everywhere you go
[1:02:32] and and that's okay because that's just
[1:02:36] the natural showing that we're getting
[1:02:37] to this place in the spiritual
[1:02:40] where
[1:02:41] things are going to show what they
[1:02:42] really are
[1:02:44] and these these spirits that have been
[1:02:47] operating just all the way back
[1:02:50] they're coming to the point where
[1:02:52] they're they're bringing forth a good
[1:02:53] life and they're bringing forth a bad
[1:02:55] life
[1:02:56] they're bringing forth the life of
[1:02:57] christ and they're bringing forth the
[1:02:58] life of the antichrist
[1:03:00] and this is that that exciting final age
[1:03:04] where
[1:03:06] everything comes out
[1:03:08] but that's um
[1:03:11] that can be kind of scary too right
[1:03:13] um
[1:03:14] even if we
[1:03:17] if we um
[1:03:19] if we look at
[1:03:20] our age we believe is delayed a sea and
[1:03:22] age and we look at this
[1:03:24] um
[1:03:25] what the church looks like in the latest
[1:03:26] in age it actually says that
[1:03:29] it's naked
[1:03:32] you can't hide anything
[1:03:34] you know where
[1:03:36] it's
[1:03:38] this is the age without secrets
[1:03:41] so
[1:03:42] what secrets do you have
[1:03:44] what are you hiding
[1:03:45] what am i hiding
[1:03:47] what am i
[1:03:49] what are my good secrets what are my bad
[1:03:51] secrets
[1:03:52] what would we see if we played the
[1:03:54] record of your life you got to see
[1:03:57] one picture of the trip
[1:03:59] uh you didn't get to see the times on
[1:04:00] the you know all the
[1:04:02] other times on the trips where i was
[1:04:04] frustrated or sad or
[1:04:08] you know fighting with the kids
[1:04:10] wasting money because i don't understand
[1:04:12] the bus system
[1:04:14] you know
[1:04:15] there's a lot you don't see right
[1:04:19] but more than your actions what if we
[1:04:21] could get a transcript of your thoughts
[1:04:24] where we've been told that our thoughts
[1:04:26] are louder in heaven than our voices on
[1:04:28] earth
[1:04:30] it's important what we think
[1:04:32] and those
[1:04:35] starred in secret
[1:04:37] but see
[1:04:39] before you do something you think about
[1:04:40] it
[1:04:42] so the thought
[1:04:44] becomes and i
[1:04:45] a word and then it becomes an action and
[1:04:48] so a lot of times
[1:04:50] your thoughts that were secret
[1:04:53] the secret will be revealed even without
[1:04:55] anything other than the natural
[1:04:56] progression of what happens to a thought
[1:04:59] a thoughts of seed and so when when
[1:05:01] we're thinking on things we're planting
[1:05:02] these seeds that will be manifested
[1:05:05] and people
[1:05:07] i can't tell what you're thinking right
[1:05:09] now
[1:05:10] but i can get an idea of what you've
[1:05:12] been thinking by where you are in your
[1:05:13] life by the choices that you've made and
[1:05:16] and the way that you choose to conduct
[1:05:18] yourself and and the values that i can
[1:05:21] see that you're
[1:05:23] you're holding to
[1:05:25] is a way to see what somebody's thinking
[1:05:28] right
[1:05:29] um
[1:05:30] but for now
[1:05:32] we we hide a lot of that
[1:05:35] we um
[1:05:37] we hide
[1:05:38] the feelings of our hearts
[1:05:40] we hide a lot of pain and sorrow and
[1:05:44] and fears and doubts a lot of that gets
[1:05:46] hidden
[1:05:48] um
[1:05:52] our our true feelings what we love is
[1:05:54] hidden you can see like i said by by the
[1:05:56] actions
[1:05:57] uh where somebody's heart is but
[1:06:00] you can't look at somebody and know if
[1:06:01] they're keeping the two great
[1:06:02] commandments you can't look at them and
[1:06:05] know if they love the lord their god
[1:06:07] with all their heart
[1:06:09] soul and mind
[1:06:11] or if they love their neighbor as their
[1:06:12] self
[1:06:15] you can't know at that minute because
[1:06:16] maybe they didn't before and maybe
[1:06:18] they've just fallen in love
[1:06:21] and maybe what they look like doesn't
[1:06:22] show that
[1:06:24] they are fulfilling those commandments
[1:06:28] but in time that should show right
[1:06:31] if you do love the lord like that if you
[1:06:33] do love your neighbor like that
[1:06:37] that should be manifest and that's part
[1:06:39] of what this is talking about in matthew
[1:06:42] that that
[1:06:43] that inner part of your heart that love
[1:06:46] that you have in your heart
[1:06:49] if it's really love
[1:06:52] it will manifest
[1:06:54] not just by scanning your brain and hope
[1:06:56] or your heart oh yep it's in there
[1:06:59] but no everything
[1:07:00] every seed brings forth after its kind
[1:07:04] so we want to be very
[1:07:06] guarded
[1:07:07] of our hearts
[1:07:09] of of what we
[1:07:11] let in our hearts what we let in our
[1:07:13] minds what we let our earth where we let
[1:07:15] our thoughts go to
[1:07:17] um
[1:07:19] these are secrets now but they're not
[1:07:20] going to stay that way
[1:07:23] but it's very natural for us
[1:07:25] to hide things
[1:07:27] we've we sons and daughters of adam have
[1:07:29] been hiding things ever since the fall
[1:07:32] if you look the first thing that adam
[1:07:34] and eve did after they
[1:07:36] had sinned
[1:07:37] is they hid
[1:07:39] they hid
[1:07:40] themselves because they were ashamed and
[1:07:43] so that goes
[1:07:44] all the way back to eden this propensity
[1:07:48] that we have
[1:07:49] to hide from
[1:07:51] from god from each other from the light
[1:07:55] and this goes all the way to the end and
[1:07:57] in uh revelation you've got these great
[1:08:00] men rich men chief captains and mighty
[1:08:02] men
[1:08:03] and they're all
[1:08:05] saying to the rocks fall on us and hide
[1:08:08] us from the face of him that sitteth on
[1:08:09] the throne and from the wrath of the
[1:08:11] lamb
[1:08:13] so all throughout its it's our our
[1:08:16] natural way
[1:08:17] is
[1:08:18] just to hide from god
[1:08:21] and sometimes you have people that are
[1:08:23] are really
[1:08:24] hiding you know out in the
[1:08:27] the caves and the rocks in the
[1:08:28] graveyards like legion and they just
[1:08:30] want
[1:08:31] nothing to do with with the things of
[1:08:33] god and and they're out hiding there
[1:08:36] but then you've also got
[1:08:40] people that are hiding in churches
[1:08:43] and they're hiding in
[1:08:44] in religion
[1:08:46] and they're they're hiding the darkness
[1:08:48] they're trying to hide the darkness from
[1:08:49] themselves
[1:08:50] and they're just trying to to cover over
[1:08:52] and and to take these dark
[1:08:55] secrets of death and sin and hatred and
[1:08:59] pride and lust and they're just trying
[1:09:01] to cover it over with some nice clothes
[1:09:03] and some good
[1:09:04] manners but jesus
[1:09:07] saw right through that and he talked to
[1:09:09] the pharisees and he said you may clean
[1:09:11] the outside of the cup and the platter
[1:09:13] but your inward part is full of ravening
[1:09:15] and wickedness
[1:09:17] see
[1:09:19] christ the word
[1:09:20] sees right through that
[1:09:22] we can trick ourselves we can maybe
[1:09:24] trick everybody else
[1:09:27] but the word is
[1:09:29] is quick it's alive it's sharp and it
[1:09:31] cuts right through all of that
[1:09:35] jesus said beware of the leaven of the
[1:09:37] pharisees which is hypocrisy
[1:09:39] and that's something we've got to guard
[1:09:41] against something we've got to
[1:09:43] watch out against that we don't want to
[1:09:45] be so good at hiding that
[1:09:47] we just
[1:09:49] hide it until the end and then
[1:09:51] what was the point in the end
[1:09:53] you know
[1:09:54] we've only got one life
[1:09:56] we've got one chance to really run to
[1:09:58] that cross
[1:10:01] and wash our sins away
[1:10:05] now is the time of salvation
[1:10:07] now is that day
[1:10:09] and so we ought to just
[1:10:12] not hide it but just go to the calvary
[1:10:16] and let that blood cleanse it all away
[1:10:20] and
[1:10:21] you know lord help me i'm i'm preaching
[1:10:23] right to myself i don't want to be a
[1:10:25] hypocrite i don't want to just have some
[1:10:27] nice clothes in good manners but
[1:10:30] i want the lord to change me way down
[1:10:33] deep
[1:10:37] there's no hiding from god
[1:10:40] david knew this
[1:10:42] in um
[1:10:44] in the psalms he talks so many times
[1:10:47] about this
[1:10:48] moses knew this
[1:10:50] if we can put up
[1:10:52] psalm 90
[1:10:53] verses 7
[1:10:55] and 8
[1:10:57] this is from the prayer of moses
[1:10:59] the man of god
[1:11:00] and so
[1:11:02] we look at moses as one of our heroes of
[1:11:05] faith
[1:11:07] but here
[1:11:08] part of moses prayer
[1:11:10] says for we are consumed by that anger
[1:11:13] and by thy wrath we are troubled
[1:11:16] thou hast set our iniquities before thee
[1:11:18] our secret sins
[1:11:20] in the light of thy countenance
[1:11:22] you know moses knew that
[1:11:25] there was really no hiding this from god
[1:11:28] so at the end in verse 12
[1:11:31] he says teach us to number our days that
[1:11:32] we may apply our hearts to wisdom
[1:11:35] you know help us by wisdom
[1:11:38] we've got this problem we've got these
[1:11:41] these sins that we can't deal with by
[1:11:42] ourselves we can't hide them
[1:11:45] so
[1:11:46] help us to number our days help us to
[1:11:47] look for wisdom i love us to look to the
[1:11:50] lord
[1:11:52] but really this this wasn't
[1:11:54] dealt with
[1:11:57] in the old testament this was only dealt
[1:11:59] with at calvary
[1:12:00] so you've got
[1:12:02] you've got this longing in david
[1:12:05] that's saying
[1:12:08] hide thy face from my sins
[1:12:10] and bought out all my iniquities
[1:12:13] this cry
[1:12:16] oh there needs to be something that will
[1:12:18] blot these out
[1:12:21] i covering these is not enough
[1:12:24] for god sees right through that
[1:12:27] but that took place on calvary
[1:12:30] if we'll we'll go to
[1:12:32] to colossians chapter 2
[1:12:35] and verse 13
[1:12:38] we'll go down to 15.
[1:12:45] it says in you being dead in your sins
[1:12:48] and the uncircumcision of your flesh
[1:12:50] hath he quickened together with him
[1:12:53] having forgiven you
[1:12:54] all trespasses
[1:12:56] blotting out the handwriting of
[1:12:58] ordinances that was against us which was
[1:13:00] contrary to us
[1:13:02] and took it out of the way nailing it to
[1:13:04] his cross
[1:13:07] he took your sins and he took my sins
[1:13:11] those that were
[1:13:13] the things that we were trying to hide
[1:13:16] the things that would have come up
[1:13:17] eventually anyway
[1:13:19] and he blotted all that out
[1:13:23] he spoiled principalities and powers
[1:13:25] made a show of them openly
[1:13:28] triumphing over them in
[1:13:30] it see for those things that we try to
[1:13:33] hide
[1:13:35] those things that we're so ashamed of
[1:13:39] he took our shame
[1:13:40] and he put it up there where everyone
[1:13:42] could see
[1:13:44] he said i'll tell your secret
[1:13:47] secret sin worthy of death
[1:13:50] and i'll wear it
[1:13:56] so for every secret there
[1:14:00] if you've come to calvary
[1:14:03] if you've accepted this atonement that
[1:14:05] that they longed for
[1:14:10] your secrets have been dealt with
[1:14:13] your debt has been paid
[1:14:16] your shame
[1:14:18] has already been taken care of
[1:14:22] surely he's borne our sin and carried
[1:14:24] our sorrows
[1:14:26] amen
[1:14:29] so thankful for that
[1:14:37] this was prophesied
[1:14:38] that there would be a fountain opened in
[1:14:40] the house of david
[1:14:42] not just
[1:14:43] some dry well that you could
[1:14:45] drop your brother in and he might show
[1:14:47] up again
[1:14:48] later
[1:14:50] but this is a cleansing fountain
[1:14:54] that
[1:14:55] just like that drop of ink that goes
[1:14:56] into the tub of bleach
[1:14:58] you can't even find it anymore
[1:15:01] those those sins those those secrets
[1:15:03] that that we had to hide
[1:15:08] that blood the power in that blood
[1:15:09] totally annihilates that
[1:15:12] that
[1:15:14] before
[1:15:15] before you come to calvary and before
[1:15:17] you
[1:15:18] you're washed in the blood you you've
[1:15:20] got all these secrets
[1:15:22] but if you've really gone and
[1:15:25] entered in
[1:15:27] okay
[1:15:28] read my record
[1:15:30] it's blank
[1:15:32] it's white
[1:15:34] it says pardoned
[1:15:37] even god doesn't remember them anymore
[1:15:41] when when god looks down and hears your
[1:15:43] prayer if you're praying through the
[1:15:45] blood
[1:15:46] he doesn't say well i sure have forgiven
[1:15:48] you a lot of times and
[1:15:50] you know this is your
[1:15:52] 9 000th sin of the day
[1:15:54] but i'm a good god i'll forgive it
[1:15:58] he looks at you as perfect
[1:16:01] he looks at you as spotless
[1:16:06] that your secrets have been dealt with
[1:16:12] but see until that happens
[1:16:15] there's such a fear of the light
[1:16:22] this is
[1:16:24] this is what john talks about
[1:16:26] where he says in the beginning was the
[1:16:28] word
[1:16:29] and the word was with god and the word
[1:16:31] was god
[1:16:34] let's let's just read it let's put up
[1:16:36] john 1 1.
[1:16:42] well what while there
[1:16:47] before we go there
[1:16:49] let's go to genesis 1 2-4
[1:16:54] we're talking about
[1:16:55] light and darkness here
[1:16:58] we're talking about these secret things
[1:17:00] that we hide in the dark
[1:17:01] and we're talking about
[1:17:03] the light of bringing it all out dealing
[1:17:06] with it
[1:17:09] and we see
[1:17:11] in in genesis 1 and 2 the earth was
[1:17:14] without form and void
[1:17:16] and darkness was upon the face of the
[1:17:18] deep
[1:17:20] so the genesis of this earth is this
[1:17:22] dark and
[1:17:23] and
[1:17:24] formless state
[1:17:26] and that's the state that we all started
[1:17:28] in
[1:17:29] in darkness
[1:17:32] but then
[1:17:34] in this pitiful state look what god does
[1:17:36] in the next verse
[1:17:40] or in the same verse the spirit of god
[1:17:42] moves on the face of the waters
[1:17:46] and god says let there be light and
[1:17:48] there was light
[1:17:49] and god saw the light that was good and
[1:17:51] then god is dividing the light from the
[1:17:54] darkness
[1:17:55] he's making a separation his word always
[1:17:57] comes
[1:17:58] to separate apart
[1:18:00] and that's where we get scared because
[1:18:02] we we know we started dark and we say
[1:18:04] well god is
[1:18:05] is separating the light from the
[1:18:06] darkness the sheep from the goats and
[1:18:09] what if all of me is just goat
[1:18:11] what if all of me is just dark
[1:18:14] and so we have that fear and that's why
[1:18:18] dropping down into john 3
[1:18:21] 19
[1:18:24] it says
[1:18:26] that
[1:18:27] this is their condemnation that
[1:18:29] light has come into the world
[1:18:31] and men loved darkness rather than light
[1:18:33] because their deeds were evil
[1:18:37] and so when when you've got things to
[1:18:38] hide you cling to the darkness
[1:18:42] because that's
[1:18:43] that's safe
[1:18:45] that's a hiding place
[1:18:47] but god wants to send his light he wants
[1:18:50] to
[1:18:50] uncover everything
[1:18:54] and deal with it
[1:18:56] and say okay
[1:18:58] there's this darkness
[1:19:00] that you've got
[1:19:01] let my word cut that out of you
[1:19:04] let my word do surgery and
[1:19:06] and separate that darkness
[1:19:09] from that seed of god
[1:19:10] that's inside of you
[1:19:12] and so we go from
[1:19:14] from this
[1:19:15] state of being
[1:19:18] just
[1:19:19] so secretive so holding on to these
[1:19:22] things and being scared of the light
[1:19:25] to go in and being children of the light
[1:19:28] that
[1:19:29] in john 12 and 36
[1:19:32] it says while you have light believe in
[1:19:34] the light that you may be the children
[1:19:35] of the light
[1:19:37] it says also in in
[1:19:40] colossians
[1:19:42] 1 and 12
[1:19:44] giving thanks unto the father which has
[1:19:46] made us meet to be partakers of the
[1:19:48] inheritance of the saints in light
[1:19:51] who hath delivered us from the power of
[1:19:52] darkness
[1:19:54] hath translated us
[1:19:56] into the kingdom of his dear son
[1:19:58] in whom we have redemption through his
[1:20:00] blood even the forgiveness of sins
[1:20:04] amen
[1:20:10] in
[1:20:12] in first corinthians chapter 6
[1:20:16] verse 9 it talks
[1:20:18] it talks we'll read down to eleven
[1:20:20] first corinthians six nine to eleven
[1:20:23] talks about how we were when we're in
[1:20:25] this dark formless state
[1:20:28] but then
[1:20:29] listen how
[1:20:31] how this light has come
[1:20:33] it says know you not
[1:20:35] that the unrighteous shall not inherit
[1:20:37] the kingdom of god
[1:20:38] be not deceived
[1:20:40] neither fornicators nor idolaters nor
[1:20:43] adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of
[1:20:45] themselves with mankind nor thieves nor
[1:20:48] covetous nor drunkards nor revilers or
[1:20:51] extortioners shall i inherit the kingdom
[1:20:53] of god
[1:20:55] that just about covers
[1:20:56] most of it
[1:20:59] and such were some of you
[1:21:02] we had secrets we we had things in our
[1:21:04] hearts and our minds that were just so
[1:21:06] ungodly
[1:21:07] that we're so ashamed of
[1:21:11] but you are
[1:21:12] washed ye are sanctified
[1:21:16] ye are justified
[1:21:18] in the name of the lord jesus and by the
[1:21:21] spirit of our god
[1:21:24] justified just as if you never did it
[1:21:31] let's read hebrews 10
[1:21:33] [Music]
[1:21:40] 10 11.
[1:21:52] let's see
[1:21:55] it gets a little bit farther down
[1:22:07] okay let's read
[1:22:09] verse 11.
[1:22:14] well let's read 10 that's good too
[1:22:17] lord lord has a reason for it by the
[1:22:19] which will we are sanctified through the
[1:22:22] offering of the body of jesus christ
[1:22:24] once for all
[1:22:26] by which will we are sanctified
[1:22:28] through the offering of the body of
[1:22:30] jesus christ
[1:22:31] once for all
[1:22:34] and every priest standing daily
[1:22:36] ministering and offering often times the
[1:22:39] same sacrifices which can never take
[1:22:41] away sins
[1:22:43] let's go down
[1:22:45] verse 12
[1:22:47] but this man
[1:22:49] after that he had offered one sacrifice
[1:22:51] for sins forever
[1:22:53] sat down at the right hand of god
[1:22:56] from henceforth expecting
[1:22:58] till his enemies
[1:23:00] be made his footstool
[1:23:03] now verse 14 is what i want to emphasize
[1:23:05] here for by one offering
[1:23:08] he hath perfected forever
[1:23:11] them that are sanctified
[1:23:15] forever
[1:23:16] can you put your name there
[1:23:18] them that are sanctified are you one of
[1:23:20] those
[1:23:21] you say for by one offering he hath
[1:23:23] perfected forever matthew mcfadden
[1:23:26] robert chicon
[1:23:28] naomi
[1:23:29] perfected forever
[1:23:31] can you put your name
[1:23:36] amen those things that we
[1:23:38] we hid
[1:23:39] so long
[1:23:41] and see these things that we hid caused
[1:23:43] us to hide
[1:23:46] it's related here the hiding of the
[1:23:48] thing
[1:23:49] versus the hiding of the person
[1:23:52] but
[1:23:53] we're going to get to some good news
[1:23:54] here i'm running out of time so i better
[1:23:56] better switch over here
[1:23:58] here soon
[1:24:04] but he's perfected forever
[1:24:06] and that are sanctified
[1:24:09] he said all in their sins and their
[1:24:11] iniquities
[1:24:12] i remember no more
[1:24:15] when god looks at you he sees the lamb
[1:24:19] he looks at christ and there's no fault
[1:24:21] in him
[1:24:22] amen
[1:24:28] and now
[1:24:32] we can't even sin
[1:24:34] let's go to first john 3 and we'll read
[1:24:37] from 1 down to 11.
[1:24:45] i know you know these things you've
[1:24:47] heard them before but it's good to be
[1:24:48] reminded of them
[1:24:50] because we're in that battle
[1:24:52] and the devil is trying to tell you oh
[1:24:54] you've got these secrets you've got
[1:24:55] these sins and these stains don't even
[1:24:58] come to church hide from god
[1:25:00] it's not working
[1:25:02] it is working
[1:25:04] just hold on to the promise
[1:25:07] amen
[1:25:08] behold what manner of love
[1:25:10] the father hath bestowed
[1:25:12] bonnie to us
[1:25:15] that we should be called the sons of god
[1:25:18] therefore the world knoweth us not
[1:25:20] because it knew
[1:25:21] him not
[1:25:22] beloved now are we the sons of god now
[1:25:28] we've got to stay in the word of god to
[1:25:30] be reminded
[1:25:32] who we are
[1:25:34] what's going on
[1:25:36] there's so many different identities the
[1:25:37] world would try to put on you oh you're
[1:25:39] this you're that you're a failure you're
[1:25:40] a quack
[1:25:42] i'm a son of god
[1:25:44] i'm a daughter of god
[1:25:45] maybe i'm
[1:25:48] still in some kinds of slavery
[1:25:50] maybe this flesh still is
[1:25:53] sometimes getting the better of me
[1:25:56] but that doesn't change whose son i am
[1:25:59] when i have a bad day i'm still a son
[1:26:02] i have a good day i'm a son
[1:26:04] now
[1:26:05] are we the sons of god and it doth not
[1:26:07] yet appear
[1:26:08] what we shall be
[1:26:10] but we know that when he shall appear i
[1:26:13] believe that's very soon
[1:26:16] we shall be like him for we shall see
[1:26:18] him as he is
[1:26:20] and every man that hath this hope in him
[1:26:23] purifieth himself even as he is pure
[1:26:26] whosoever committeth sin transgresseth
[1:26:29] transgresseth also the law
[1:26:31] for sin is the transgression of the law
[1:26:33] and you know that he was
[1:26:35] manifested
[1:26:37] to take away our sins
[1:26:39] and in him is no sin
[1:26:41] whosoever abideth in him
[1:26:44] we're going to get to that
[1:26:46] that's
[1:26:47] that's where we hide we used to hide
[1:26:49] from god
[1:26:51] now we hide in god we abide in him
[1:26:55] and when we're hiding in him then we're
[1:26:57] hiding something different in us
[1:26:59] than what we used to be hiding in us
[1:27:01] whosoever abideth in him
[1:27:04] oh that's where we are today
[1:27:06] can we just stay in him
[1:27:10] i just feel this is this is
[1:27:13] such an important part
[1:27:16] everything's trying to pull you out of
[1:27:18] christ
[1:27:19] to get you to go this way that way
[1:27:22] just stay in him
[1:27:24] stay in his presence just like
[1:27:28] the old tabernacle had the three courts
[1:27:31] there was the
[1:27:32] the court of the sacrifices
[1:27:35] you know a place to come and hear the
[1:27:37] word and eat
[1:27:38] there was the inner court where there
[1:27:39] was fellowship
[1:27:41] those were nice
[1:27:42] but now we're to live in in that inner
[1:27:45] court that holy of holies
[1:27:47] stay in the presence of the lord
[1:27:49] and that's where the battle is we all
[1:27:52] know that we all know okay that that's
[1:27:54] where life is is to stay there
[1:27:56] but are
[1:27:58] we are we seeking that with all our
[1:28:01] hearts
[1:28:02] is that
[1:28:04] our our our biggest goal on
[1:28:07] on the to-do list is just oh abide in
[1:28:09] him
[1:28:10] oh stay in his word stay in his spirit
[1:28:14] stay in that holy of holies
[1:28:18] that's what's important in this day
[1:28:21] is to be hid in him to abide in him
[1:28:24] for whosoever abideth in him sinneth not
[1:28:28] whosoever
[1:28:30] sinneth hath not seen him
[1:28:32] neither known him
[1:28:33] little children let no man deceive you
[1:28:35] he that doeth righteousness is righteous
[1:28:37] even as he is righteous he that
[1:28:39] committeth sin is of the devil
[1:28:41] for the devil sinneth from the beginning
[1:28:44] for this purpose the son of god was
[1:28:46] manifested that he might destroy the
[1:28:49] works of the devil
[1:28:51] whosoever is born of god
[1:28:56] can you put your name there
[1:29:00] brother aaron doth not commit sin
[1:29:03] can you say that
[1:29:05] can you put your name there for the
[1:29:06] david
[1:29:07] does not commit sin are you born of god
[1:29:10] can't say well i was kind of born of god
[1:29:14] either you were you weren't
[1:29:16] either you were born of the spirit
[1:29:18] you're a new creation
[1:29:20] you're a son you're a daughter of god
[1:29:23] or you're not
[1:29:24] don't let the devil talk you out of it
[1:29:26] if god
[1:29:28] has let you be born of his spirit
[1:29:31] then it says here you don't commit sin
[1:29:34] oh thank the lord
[1:29:38] i don't have to hide anymore
[1:29:40] i don't have things
[1:29:42] that i have to hide and now i don't have
[1:29:43] to hide
[1:29:45] but i can come into the light
[1:29:47] i can come
[1:29:49] where the saints of light are
[1:29:51] and i can rejoice together and say he
[1:29:53] took my sins away
[1:29:58] for his seed remaineth in him
[1:30:01] and he cannot sin
[1:30:03] because he is born of god
[1:30:07] amen and now look
[1:30:10] look where this
[1:30:11] goes from here
[1:30:13] we're on board here we say yes amen
[1:30:17] now look at this
[1:30:20] verse 10
[1:30:21] in this the children of god are manifest
[1:30:23] and the children of the devil whosoever
[1:30:25] doeth not righteousness is not of god
[1:30:28] neither he that loveth not his brother
[1:30:31] oh
[1:30:32] comes back every time those two great
[1:30:34] commandments love the lord thy god with
[1:30:36] all thy heart
[1:30:37] soul mind strength body everything you
[1:30:39] are
[1:30:40] love your neighbor as yourself
[1:30:42] can we do that
[1:30:44] for this is the message that you've
[1:30:46] heard from the beginning that we should
[1:30:48] love one another
[1:30:50] and if we're born of god
[1:30:54] here's what it is if we abide in him
[1:30:57] he says i in you and you and me
[1:31:00] it used to be we had these sins that
[1:31:02] were hiding so we hid ourselves
[1:31:04] now we hide in christ and hide him in us
[1:31:08] so now here
[1:31:12] now it becomes
[1:31:14] a lot more of a joyful thing if i if i
[1:31:16] call up a volunteer and say what are you
[1:31:18] hiding
[1:31:19] well now that you've
[1:31:21] had your
[1:31:23] your memory refreshed
[1:31:27] when you come up you don't have to say
[1:31:28] well i
[1:31:31] i was proud yesterday i was angry
[1:31:34] but now you can say i like to volunteer
[1:31:37] i'm hiding the life of christ
[1:31:41] in this jar of clay
[1:31:44] i'm hiding the spirit of god the creator
[1:31:48] i'm hiding unconditional love
[1:31:51] in here
[1:31:52] i'm hiding the power of forgiveness
[1:31:55] in here you might not see it all the
[1:31:57] time
[1:31:58] it's still hidden sometimes it still
[1:32:01] looks so foolish sometimes
[1:32:05] you know
[1:32:06] you go out to any of these parking lots
[1:32:09] you look at all the cars
[1:32:11] some are
[1:32:12] very expensive some are not so expensive
[1:32:15] some are nice some are not so nice
[1:32:17] if you walk through the parking lot
[1:32:20] you can't tell which of these are full
[1:32:22] of gas and which ones are empty
[1:32:25] that's something that's hidden
[1:32:28] a lot of times when you see people
[1:32:31] you can't tell
[1:32:32] right away
[1:32:34] whether they're hiding the life of jesus
[1:32:36] christ
[1:32:38] whether they're not but just like those
[1:32:40] cars in the parking lot it's going to
[1:32:42] make a difference
[1:32:43] the ones that are out of gas aren't
[1:32:44] going anywhere
[1:32:47] but we're going somewhere
[1:32:51] we're
[1:32:52] we're those people that are going to be
[1:32:54] found by faith or those people that are
[1:32:56] going to be found
[1:32:58] with oil in their lamps
[1:33:01] ready for the coming of the lord
[1:33:04] that we've hidden this treasure in our
[1:33:05] heart
[1:33:06] that we found this pearl of great price
[1:33:10] he said that's worth everything to me
[1:33:14] is that what you're hiding today
[1:33:17] is him
[1:33:18] are you hiding in him or hiding from him
[1:33:25] let's um
[1:33:28] let's go i want to read
[1:33:31] in second corinthians
[1:33:34] we'll start in verse uh second
[1:33:36] corinthians chapter four verse one
[1:33:41] and we're going to read quite a bit of
[1:33:43] this but it's just so good
[1:33:45] it's life to me
[1:33:49] it says therefore
[1:33:50] seeing we have this ministry
[1:33:52] as we've received mercy we faint not
[1:33:57] but have renounced the hidden things of
[1:33:59] dishonesty
[1:34:00] not walking in craftiness nor handling
[1:34:02] the word of god deceitfully
[1:34:05] but by manifestation of the truth
[1:34:12] well
[1:34:13] there's so much in here just just let it
[1:34:15] sink in just let it minister to you
[1:34:19] this this truth
[1:34:21] used to be these dark secrets would
[1:34:23] would come out eventually
[1:34:26] these things that were kept secret
[1:34:28] suddenly it's revealed and it's
[1:34:30] destroying families it's destroying
[1:34:32] fellowship it's causing wreck and ruin
[1:34:36] now that we've renounced those hidden
[1:34:38] things of dishonesty
[1:34:42] now this manifestation of the truth
[1:34:46] is coming to be revealed and it's
[1:34:47] bringing
[1:34:48] fruit for people to eat it's bringing
[1:34:51] shade it's bringing faith it's bringing
[1:34:52] love it's bringing healing
[1:34:55] because what we're hiding is so
[1:34:56] different
[1:34:58] we're hiding the truth and just like the
[1:35:00] evil was going to be made manifest
[1:35:02] eventually this truth is is being made
[1:35:04] manifest
[1:35:10] commending ourselves to every man's
[1:35:12] conscience in the sight of god
[1:35:14] but if our gospel be hid
[1:35:17] it's hid to them that are lost
[1:35:21] some people still can't see it
[1:35:24] it's hiding
[1:35:26] in whom the god of this world hath
[1:35:27] blinded the minds of them which believe
[1:35:29] not
[1:35:30] lest the light of the glorious gospel of
[1:35:32] christ
[1:35:34] who is the image of god should shine
[1:35:37] unto them
[1:35:39] for we preach not ourselves
[1:35:43] but christ jesus the lord
[1:35:47] that which we've hidden in our heart
[1:35:50] and ourselves your servants for jesus
[1:35:53] sake
[1:35:55] see what it does when you're really
[1:35:56] hiding in him and you're really hiding
[1:35:57] that it doesn't make you proud it makes
[1:36:00] you a servant i said brother sister what
[1:36:02] can i do for you
[1:36:04] and i've
[1:36:06] i can't preach that to you as something
[1:36:08] you don't have because you've you've
[1:36:10] ministered to me
[1:36:12] i've seen you all
[1:36:15] come and and be servants to one another
[1:36:17] and come and help us with our burdens
[1:36:19] and i'm so grateful for that i see this
[1:36:21] working in this body i see this working
[1:36:23] in your eyes and
[1:36:25] it's so encouraging
[1:36:30] the servants for jesus sake
[1:36:32] for god who commanded the light to shine
[1:36:34] out of darkness hath shined in our
[1:36:36] hearts
[1:36:38] to give the light of the knowledge of
[1:36:40] the glory of god in the face of jesus
[1:36:42] christ
[1:36:45] but we have this treasure
[1:36:48] in earthen vessels
[1:36:53] that the excellency of the power may be
[1:36:55] of god and not of us
[1:36:57] here's what it looks like on the outside
[1:37:00] we're troubled on every side
[1:37:02] yet not distressed
[1:37:04] we're perplexed but not in despair
[1:37:07] persecuted but not forsaken
[1:37:10] cast down but not destroyed
[1:37:14] always bearing about in the body of the
[1:37:16] dying of the lord jesus
[1:37:19] that the life falsehood of jesus might
[1:37:20] be made manifest
[1:37:22] in our body
[1:37:24] for we which live are always delivered
[1:37:26] unto death for jesus sake that the life
[1:37:28] also of jesus might be made manifest
[1:37:31] in our mortal flesh so then death
[1:37:34] worketh in us but life in you
[1:37:37] we have in the same spirit of faith
[1:37:38] according to as it is written i believed
[1:37:41] and therefore have i spoken
[1:37:43] we also believe and therefore speak
[1:37:44] knowing
[1:37:46] that he which raised up the lord jesus
[1:37:49] shall raise up
[1:37:51] us also by jesus
[1:37:54] see here's what it's coming to you those
[1:37:55] things that were hidden they're going to
[1:37:56] come out right
[1:37:58] well this that's hidden in you that
[1:38:00] still lets you be perplexed and
[1:38:02] cast down and
[1:38:04] still look so foolish so many times
[1:38:08] it's
[1:38:09] it's gonna be
[1:38:10] manifest
[1:38:12] just like it raised christ it's gonna
[1:38:14] raise us it's gonna raise us in a
[1:38:15] newness of life in a demonstration of
[1:38:18] the power of the holy ghost that's going
[1:38:20] to raise us off of this world
[1:38:24] it's that same power it's got to do the
[1:38:26] same thing
[1:38:29] so raise up us also by jesus and shall
[1:38:32] present us with you
[1:38:34] for all things are for your sakes and
[1:38:36] the abundant grace that the abundant
[1:38:38] grace might through the thanksgiving of
[1:38:40] many redound to the glory of god
[1:38:43] for this cause we faint not
[1:38:46] for though our outer man perish
[1:38:50] yet the inward man is renewed day by day
[1:38:54] for our light affliction
[1:38:56] which is but for a moment worketh for us
[1:38:59] a far more exceeding and eternal weight
[1:39:01] of glory
[1:39:03] while we look not at the things which
[1:39:05] are seen
[1:39:07] but of the things which are not seen
[1:39:10] for the things which are seen are
[1:39:12] temporal
[1:39:13] but the things which are not seen are
[1:39:15] eternal
[1:39:17] what are you hiding
[1:39:23] is jehovah god living in you
[1:39:32] for
[1:39:34] for your homework why don't you read
[1:39:36] chapter five let it read second
[1:39:37] corinthians chapter five and it
[1:39:39] continues on i could just continue going
[1:39:41] with it but
[1:39:42] it talks about
[1:39:46] this building of god a house not made
[1:39:48] with hands
[1:39:50] talks about
[1:39:51] appearing before the judgment seat of
[1:39:53] christ
[1:39:55] to receive the things that you've done
[1:39:57] whether bad or good
[1:40:00] it goes down and says if any man be in
[1:40:03] christ he's a new creature
[1:40:05] old things are passed away
[1:40:07] the old all things have become new
[1:40:10] and then in
[1:40:12] verse 20 it says be reconciled to god
[1:40:15] verse 21 says
[1:40:17] for it made
[1:40:18] for he hath made him to be sin for us
[1:40:21] who knew no sin
[1:40:22] that we might be made the righteousness
[1:40:24] of god
[1:40:25] in him
[1:40:26] amen
[1:40:28] so that's what we're hiding
[1:40:31] we have this earnest of our inheritance
[1:40:34] there's going to be a redemption of the
[1:40:35] purchased possession
[1:40:37] we have this
[1:40:39] this seed gene of god inside of us
[1:40:44] and
[1:40:46] as i was studying i was just so amazed
[1:40:48] that
[1:40:51] there's so much in there that
[1:40:54] we're hiding that
[1:40:57] and it's not just a small thing but it's
[1:40:59] it's to the point that when when jesus
[1:41:01] sends the disciples out
[1:41:03] he says whosoever will not receive you
[1:41:05] nor hear your words
[1:41:07] shake the dust off your city it's not
[1:41:09] going to be it's going to be more
[1:41:10] tolerable for sodom and gomorrah than
[1:41:12] for them
[1:41:14] it says it's not you that speak it's the
[1:41:16] spirit of your father
[1:41:19] it says whosoever shall give to drink
[1:41:21] one of these
[1:41:23] little ones a cup of cold water in the
[1:41:24] name of the disciple he shall no eyes
[1:41:27] receive
[1:41:28] lose his reward
[1:41:30] so when you carry this
[1:41:33] it
[1:41:34] has a massive significance
[1:41:37] that people
[1:41:40] the way that they treat you
[1:41:42] is going to determine
[1:41:44] blessings or
[1:41:46] or no blessings for them
[1:41:49] that you're going forth
[1:41:52] as lights in this stage
[1:41:55] in this day and age now that you're not
[1:41:57] hiding in the darkness now that you've
[1:41:58] come into the light you're going and
[1:42:00] that which is hidden you can't stay
[1:42:02] hidden it's being manifested
[1:42:06] and that's what we're waiting for
[1:42:09] it says in romans 8 and 18
[1:42:13] it says for i reckon that the sufferings
[1:42:16] of this present time
[1:42:18] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:42:20] glory which shall be revealed in us do
[1:42:22] you believe that
[1:42:24] can you put your name there
[1:42:26] do you believe that there's
[1:42:28] a glory
[1:42:30] that shall be revealed
[1:42:32] in in rachel and martha in
[1:42:35] you know each one of you
[1:42:40] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:42:42] creature waiteth
[1:42:43] for the manifestations of the songs of
[1:42:45] god
[1:42:47] we're at that day where
[1:42:49] all the secrets are being revealed
[1:42:51] and this great secret that we've hidden
[1:42:54] it's got to come out
[1:42:59] so we can say like mary said
[1:43:01] behold the handmaid of the lord
[1:43:03] be it unto me according
[1:43:05] to your word
[1:43:08] it's not
[1:43:09] by our
[1:43:10] striving by our might and our power but
[1:43:12] it's by the spirit of god
[1:43:16] by entering into his rest by abiding in
[1:43:18] him
[1:43:21] no flesh is going to glory in his
[1:43:23] presence that's why he lets it be this
[1:43:25] way that he's got this treasure hidden
[1:43:26] in an earthen vessel
[1:43:28] that he still lets our our weaknesses
[1:43:30] show he still chooses the foolishness of
[1:43:32] preaching
[1:43:34] to have
[1:43:35] just flawed people come up and and
[1:43:38] somehow god can still speak to you
[1:43:41] because of
[1:43:42] of his spirit of his power
[1:43:45] of what he's doing
[1:43:53] let's let's read colossians chapter 3
[1:43:57] and verse
[1:43:58] 1.
[1:44:06] it says
[1:44:07] if you then be risen with christ
[1:44:10] seek those things which are above
[1:44:12] for christ sitteth on the right hand of
[1:44:14] god
[1:44:15] set your affections on things above
[1:44:18] not on things of the earth
[1:44:21] for you are dead
[1:44:24] and your life is hid with
[1:44:26] christ and god
[1:44:31] when christ who is our life shall appear
[1:44:34] eventually you also appear with him in
[1:44:35] glory
[1:44:37] mortify therefore your members which are
[1:44:39] upon the earth fornication uncleanness
[1:44:41] inordinate affection evil concupiscence
[1:44:44] and covetousness which is idolatry
[1:44:46] for which things seek the wrath of god
[1:44:49] cometh on the children of disobedience
[1:44:52] in which ye also walked sometime when
[1:44:54] you lived in them
[1:44:55] but now you have put off these anger
[1:44:57] wrath malice blasphemy filthy
[1:45:00] communication out of your mouth
[1:45:03] there in verse 3 it says you're dead
[1:45:05] and your life is hid with christ in god
[1:45:10] if you want to
[1:45:12] to be blessed you might also listen
[1:45:14] there's the sermon a hidden life in
[1:45:16] christ
[1:45:18] and
[1:45:19] you've probably heard it
[1:45:20] before you've probably heard it preached
[1:45:22] before
[1:45:24] but
[1:45:25] i heard it again and it was such a
[1:45:26] blessing to me
[1:45:28] um
[1:45:31] i'll give you a little taste of it maybe
[1:45:33] to pique your interest here
[1:45:36] get you to read it
[1:45:40] let's let's have the musicians come
[1:45:42] maybe and play something softly and
[1:45:44] we'll kind of finish here
[1:45:47] it says
[1:45:54] notice every year
[1:45:56] the high priest entered into that place
[1:45:59] the congregation followed him up
[1:46:02] and he went into this great place where
[1:46:03] the veil dropped behind him
[1:46:06] the inner courts the holiest of holies
[1:46:09] no one dared to go after him then he was
[1:46:12] alone with god
[1:46:15] what a beautiful picture it is today of
[1:46:18] a consecrated life
[1:46:20] who once enters in
[1:46:21] to enter with christ dead to the things
[1:46:24] of the world
[1:46:25] hid away with god
[1:46:27] and the veils drop down around and all
[1:46:29] the worlds shut off
[1:46:32] then christianity and religion becomes a
[1:46:34] pleasure to every believer
[1:46:38] today people
[1:46:39] just have enough religion to make them
[1:46:41] miserable
[1:46:43] knowing they ought to do this
[1:46:45] they're trying to escape hell
[1:46:47] if that's the way i felt about it
[1:46:49] brother i don't know
[1:46:50] what i would do oh get in with christ
[1:46:54] shut off from the things of the world
[1:46:56] for to commune with him is a pleasure
[1:46:58] it's beautiful
[1:46:59] it's something that fills and satisfies
[1:47:01] the soul
[1:47:03] something that gives you peace that
[1:47:04] passes all understanding
[1:47:06] all the crosses become flying wings all
[1:47:08] the burdens are chariot wheels though
[1:47:10] you can fly away
[1:47:12] my burdens are light
[1:47:14] yoke up with him the oaks all padded
[1:47:15] with hallelujahs
[1:47:17] when you're once inside the veil with
[1:47:19] him he becomes your life
[1:47:22] the prophet said that in the days
[1:47:24] of old the people in old days said that
[1:47:26] he would write his laws anew
[1:47:28] he would put them
[1:47:30] in their heart
[1:47:32] now mount sinai was a place of duty but
[1:47:34] mount calvary was a place of grace
[1:47:37] people are trying still trying to live
[1:47:38] on mount sinai if i go to church if i
[1:47:41] pay my dues if i do this and that all
[1:47:43] i'll quit and stop that that's still on
[1:47:45] mount sinai but when you come to a place
[1:47:47] where you're dead
[1:47:48] and your life is hidden god through
[1:47:50] christ sealed by the holy ghost
[1:47:52] the whole christian life becomes a great
[1:47:54] glorious shout and a hallelujah to you
[1:47:57] and you're hid away daily
[1:47:59] now notice
[1:48:01] once in there he was
[1:48:02] isolated from the world the curtains
[1:48:04] dropped around him and he was hid away
[1:48:06] with god
[1:48:07] everything becomes real a glory
[1:48:10] in this place where we once get it hid
[1:48:11] away with
[1:48:12] christ
[1:48:14] everything becomes a new thing to us
[1:48:16] then oh brother why don't you stop that
[1:48:19] nonsense and come into the holy of
[1:48:20] holies holiest of holies by the blood of
[1:48:22] the lord jesus
[1:48:24] every bit of manna outside of here
[1:48:26] just lets you ask for tonight or
[1:48:28] tomorrow next week won't work it dries
[1:48:29] up overnight but if you ever consecrate
[1:48:31] yourself to come into where the man
[1:48:34] stays fresh
[1:48:35] day in day out year in year out in the
[1:48:37] holiest of holies
[1:48:39] you can meet a man that's ever walked in
[1:48:41] there i don't care if he hasn't had a
[1:48:42] revival for six months
[1:48:44] he's just as sweet as he was from the
[1:48:47] day he was in the revival that's right
[1:48:49] you can meet him on a shouty day or a
[1:48:50] cloudy day
[1:48:52] or whatsoever you want to
[1:48:53] he's just the same because he's living
[1:48:55] in the glory of god
[1:48:57] he's living where the man is fresh all
[1:48:59] the time
[1:49:00] where it isn't a burden to get out and
[1:49:02] pray through today and pray through
[1:49:03] tomorrow
[1:49:05] brother stay in
[1:49:07] stay with him all the time in the
[1:49:09] holiest of holies now here's a question
[1:49:12] can a person live that way
[1:49:14] he says absolutely
[1:49:17] that's what jesus died for
[1:49:19] amen
[1:49:21] can you put your name in that question
[1:49:23] can i live that way
[1:49:25] can peter live that way
[1:49:27] hidden christ abided in him
[1:49:30] absolutely
[1:49:32] that's what jesus died for
[1:49:34] [Music]
[1:49:36] we don't have to hide from god we don't
[1:49:38] have to be discouraged because we're
[1:49:39] looking on the outer things but we're
[1:49:41] looking on the inner things
[1:49:43] we're looking at that
[1:49:45] earnest that he's given us that down
[1:49:47] payment
[1:49:49] that holy ghost
[1:49:54] if you haven't received that holy ghost
[1:49:56] the bible says come let us reason
[1:49:58] together
[1:49:59] though your sins were a scarlet they
[1:50:01] shall be white as snow
[1:50:04] though they be red like crimson they
[1:50:06] shall be as wool
[1:50:09] you can come and receive that today
[1:50:12] if you haven't received that
[1:50:14] jesus said all that the father has given
[1:50:16] me shall come to me
[1:50:18] he that comes to me i will no wise cast
[1:50:21] out
[1:50:24] he said that if we would confess our
[1:50:25] sins he's faithful and just to forgive
[1:50:27] us all our sins
[1:50:29] and to cleanse us from all
[1:50:30] unrighteousness
[1:50:32] he said we can cast all our cares on him
[1:50:34] for he cares for you
[1:50:37] so if you haven't come to that place
[1:50:39] where you're no longer hiding but that
[1:50:41] you're hit
[1:50:43] that you're no longer hiding your sin
[1:50:45] and shame but
[1:50:46] you're hiding
[1:50:48] that matchless son of god
[1:50:51] then come to him today
[1:50:55] come and cast your cares on him come in
[1:50:58] and reason with him
[1:51:00] that your sins will be washed away
[1:51:03] i believe many of us have
[1:51:06] have made that
[1:51:10] that step towards god and he's come and
[1:51:12] he's he's baptized us he's he's led us
[1:51:15] to be born again
[1:51:18] but for those of us
[1:51:20] that are there then
[1:51:22] [Music]
[1:51:23] now is this time where we're coming to
[1:51:25] the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:51:28] now there's this time where it's got to
[1:51:31] shine out
[1:51:32] and just like john the baptist the
[1:51:34] greatest
[1:51:35] man that had been born prior to christ
[1:51:37] said he said i must
[1:51:39] decrease
[1:51:40] he must increase i believe each one of
[1:51:42] us could say that same thing no matter
[1:51:44] where we're at
[1:51:45] we could just say oh god
[1:51:48] i don't want that
[1:51:50] [Music]
[1:51:52] that you've given me just to be a candle
[1:51:55] that's under a bushel
[1:51:58] but i want your perfect will i want to
[1:51:59] manifest that light
[1:52:02] let me decrease you could increase
[1:52:06] so i believe for each one of us there's
[1:52:09] there's more consecration that we can we
[1:52:11] can come and bring there's
[1:52:13] there's more that we can surrender that
[1:52:15] we could just abide in him
[1:52:18] there's more weights that we can set
[1:52:19] aside
[1:52:22] that he could be glorified that's what
[1:52:23] it's all about it's just
[1:52:25] that he'd have his way and be glorified
[1:52:27] i believe
[1:52:29] that there are hearts that are desiring
[1:52:31] that i don't believe that this is
[1:52:34] something that's foreign to you but i
[1:52:35] believe that
[1:52:36] not my words but his words i believe you
[1:52:38] you can just amen with all your heart
[1:52:41] you could say yes lord be it unto me
[1:52:43] according to your word
[1:52:44] yes i believe it
[1:52:46] i believe that's for me i believe i can
[1:52:47] put my name there
[1:52:49] [Music]
[1:52:52] let's let's just stand and pray
[1:53:06] father it's been good to be in your
[1:53:08] house lord

[2:07:08] you know if you go by a field somewhere
[2:07:11] and there's a seed been planted
[2:07:14] and unless you're a farmer or somebody
[2:07:16] you that what you do
[2:07:18] you might know not not know what that
[2:07:20] seed is if you looked at it
[2:07:23] but the seed is going to bring forth
[2:07:24] that which what's in it
[2:07:27] right now around where we live is what
[2:07:29] fields are left
[2:07:31] there's a lot of cotton growing
[2:07:34] you see the farmers prepping the land
[2:07:36] and then you see the
[2:07:38] machinery putting the seed in the ground
[2:07:41] they do everything they can do
[2:07:43] to get it ready
[2:07:45] but god gives it life
[2:07:47] and it manifests what is
[2:07:50] and right now it's it's that harvest
[2:07:52] time this morning as we were leaving the
[2:07:54] house i looked at and i told my wife
[2:07:55] look at the flowers
[2:07:57] that first bloom from the cotton
[2:08:00] but they're looking for the cotton out
[2:08:02] of it
[2:08:03] and there's a people are hungry
[2:08:05] in in in wanting desiring to see the
[2:08:08] real life of jesus christ
[2:08:11] that seed's been planted in you
[2:08:14] let it grow let christ be
[2:08:16] paul simply said it this way and i it's
[2:08:19] one of the most profound yet simple
[2:08:21] statements
[2:08:22] christ in you
[2:08:24] the hope of glory
[2:08:26] and sometimes we go around and and i'm
[2:08:28] as guilty as anybody else if not more
[2:08:31] go around in all kinds of ways
[2:08:34] except for yielding to it and sending it
[2:08:36] be it unto me
[2:08:37] according to thy word that's what mary
[2:08:39] said
[2:08:40] be it unto me according to thy word let
[2:08:43] that be all our prayer
[2:08:45] not just because you're here in church
[2:08:47] today but because wherever you're at
[2:08:50] let me manifest because someone
[2:08:53] is longing to see
[2:08:55] a reality of christ
[2:08:58] and brother peter i know that's
[2:09:00] your heart and your desire
[2:09:02] to see then that's why you would give it
[2:09:04] out that way
[2:09:05] as i told brother lyle
[2:09:07] on wednesday night
[2:09:09] and he preached and i said now you're
[2:09:10] going to be tested on that
[2:09:13] you're going to be tried on what you
[2:09:14] hear what you receive and brother peter
[2:09:16] you'll be tested on that you'll be
[2:09:17] looked at
[2:09:18] but there's a promise if we'll yield
[2:09:21] will surrender will say here i am lord
[2:09:23] he will manifest that he said all
[2:09:26] that the father has given me will come
[2:09:29] and i shall not lose the one of them are
[2:09:32] you one of those today
[2:09:34] are you know do you know you're one of
[2:09:35] those today
[2:09:37] are you embarrassed
[2:09:39] put your hand up and say i'm one of them
[2:09:40] lord
[2:09:41] that's me
[2:09:42] i claim that promise i will be there
[2:09:45] today lord
[2:09:48] sometimes the word comes in in our flesh
[2:09:50] it's hard
[2:09:52] but the breaking of the ground the
[2:09:54] fellow ground lord it takes it takes a
