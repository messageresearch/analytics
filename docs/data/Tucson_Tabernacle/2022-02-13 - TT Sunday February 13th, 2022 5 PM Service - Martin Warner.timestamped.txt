[12:33] amen this monitor is not on i don't
[12:35] think so
[12:37] it's kind of hard to turn back and look
[12:39] this way so
[12:41] amen
[12:43] good to be in the house of the lord this
[12:45] evening again
[12:46] he said where two or three are gathered
[12:48] in his name he'd be in their midst so
[12:50] he's here
[12:51] but ask brother mark to come
[12:53] open the service in prayer
[12:56] and maybe just greet the
[12:59] share a little bit what's on his heart
[13:03] and
[13:05] maybe to warren sister janna that would
[13:07] probably call on her to sing again today
[13:10] so
[13:11] amen
[13:15] [Music]
[13:21] [Music]
[13:25] i guess um
[13:27] why don't you be seated for a minute
[13:33] i wonder if um
[13:36] visiting ministers get called on because
[13:39] they have the reputation of wanting to
[13:41] you know having the itch wanting to say
[13:43] something i've never
[13:45] i've never had that well maybe i had it
[13:46] a little bit but
[13:48] i certainly don't have it now
[13:51] um
[13:52] but i would like to share something with
[13:54] you that maybe i could be a
[13:56] a help or a blessing something that
[13:58] could
[13:59] uh you could take away tonight um
[14:03] it's uh it's springtime
[14:05] in the desert
[14:08] we
[14:09] used to go to this nursery and and this
[14:11] man would tell us that
[14:14] the last day of january is the last day
[14:16] of winter
[14:17] in the desert
[14:18] and
[14:20] first week of february usually you can
[14:21] start to see the buds coming out
[14:24] the birds returning and so forth so
[14:27] we're gardeners and we
[14:29] we have our winter garden
[14:31] i don't know if many know it but the
[14:32] winter garden is the best garden in
[14:34] tucson you can
[14:35] lots of things you can plant
[14:38] and so we're getting our spring garden
[14:40] in now and
[14:41] putting tomatoes in we're a little late
[14:43] on the tomatoes they should have already
[14:45] been in
[14:46] and you start them in little cups and we
[14:48] do the heirlooms
[14:49] and
[14:50] then you put them out when it's you know
[14:52] time to
[14:53] beans and whatever else we
[14:55] we
[14:56] put in
[14:58] but um
[15:01] you know i
[15:02] i got to thinking this morning when
[15:05] when we came into the back of the church
[15:07] i really felt at home
[15:12] we don't have many
[15:14] at catalina byway now we have a few
[15:16] families that's it
[15:19] and
[15:22] you go through life
[15:25] i guess i'm saying this because i just
[15:27] turned 70. you know so
[15:29] if i'm going to say anything i better go
[15:30] ahead and say it
[15:33] but um
[15:34] you through life you you come through
[15:37] the stages of life and you have
[15:39] great expectations you
[15:41] you think you know i'm going to write a
[15:43] great book or i'm going to
[15:45] preach great sermons and i'm going to
[15:48] have
[15:48] hundreds of people to listen to my
[15:51] wonderful
[15:53] words of wisdom
[15:55] and then
[15:56] that's your carnal side you know and
[15:57] then it just doesn't quite turn out that
[15:59] way
[16:00] and you turn 70 and you end up with two
[16:02] or three families and you
[16:04] you still do it every week
[16:07] i'm enjoying myself more than i ever
[16:09] have
[16:11] i come into the back of the church each
[16:12] sunday now we live on the property so
[16:16] we're there all week so i'm in and out
[16:18] of the sanctuary doing different things
[16:21] from time to time
[16:22] but when i enter that
[16:25] sanctuary on sunday morning it is
[16:28] totally different
[16:30] even with just a few people
[16:33] the feeling that's there the sense of
[16:36] god's presence is so powerful
[16:40] and especially with i see you didn't
[16:42] come tonight but with my song leader
[16:45] there
[16:46] leading songs it's just a wonderful
[16:48] atmosphere
[16:50] my wife has to be away from the house
[16:51] now a lot she's working with arne's
[16:54] girls around the clock to take care of
[16:56] an older woman and so when she comes
[16:58] home you know there's a different
[16:59] presence
[17:01] when i'm there by myself it's
[17:03] it's just not the same
[17:05] but the presence on sunday morning is
[17:08] totally different
[17:11] it's different even than my wife's
[17:13] presence which is dear to me
[17:15] and when i came into this church today i
[17:17] felt such a joyous
[17:20] presence
[17:21] there is probably no place that we would
[17:23] be
[17:25] if we ever shut down
[17:27] we would be here with you
[17:30] i was talking about growing things
[17:32] because saints
[17:34] god is growing
[17:36] a garden
[17:38] and this thought came to me recently you
[17:40] know as you grow older and you
[17:43] you go through the stages of life and
[17:45] you you have many disappointments and
[17:48] things didn't turn out just the way you
[17:49] thought they would
[17:52] you look back and you think well
[17:54] you know
[17:55] what did i do what what good was i you
[17:58] know the devil comes to you and
[18:00] starts asking you those questions
[18:03] and
[18:04] you enter your later years and you've
[18:07] got just a few people that you're
[18:08] ministering to and you start to think
[18:10] you know should i shut this thing down i
[18:12] actually came to the church last january
[18:14] and i said look let's just shut down and
[18:16] we'll go down and
[18:17] go to the tabernacle we'll just
[18:19] enjoy
[18:21] no they didn't want that that that
[18:22] wasn't what the in fact several of them
[18:24] started crying immediately
[18:26] so i said okay i'll be here as long as
[18:28] you want me here
[18:31] but the thought came to me this year
[18:33] why not just be
[18:35] a wonderful
[18:37] flower
[18:39] in god's garden
[18:42] why do i have to think about preaching
[18:45] great sermons or
[18:47] doing some great work
[18:49] why not
[18:51] when we go out in the morning and those
[18:53] first little tomato plants come up
[18:56] it's just
[18:57] there's just something about it you know
[18:59] it's so special
[19:01] well we're that little flower in god's
[19:03] garden
[19:05] why can't i just be
[19:08] that little flower
[19:10] that he takes pleasure in
[19:13] day in
[19:14] and day out
[19:17] isn't he wonderful
[19:20] we so often lose sight
[19:22] of what's really important
[19:25] and so often the most important thing is
[19:27] so close to us
[19:30] that we miss it
[19:32] i don't want to miss it
[19:34] i think we're very close
[19:36] how many of you are aware of what's
[19:38] happening with russia now
[19:40] it's it's like it's like we want to go
[19:43] to war
[19:45] we're pushing them
[19:46] into war
[19:48] does that make any sense to you they
[19:49] have everything they need to destroy us
[19:53] we can't compete with the defensive
[19:55] weapons they have
[19:57] i mean it doesn't make any sense but
[19:59] we know that there's a vision that has
[20:01] to be fulfilled
[20:03] let's just be a
[20:04] precious flower
[20:08] in his garden
[20:11] father
[20:13] lord we were so blessed this morning
[20:17] the smiles of those young black boys
[20:21] that picture will be forever painted
[20:24] in my mind
[20:27] to think that
[20:28] what your word does in our hearts lord
[20:32] how it draws us to you and
[20:35] lord it does the same thing
[20:38] to those young boys
[20:40] in that country over across the sea as
[20:43] it does for us
[20:45] lord we just invite you tonight to come
[20:47] and
[20:48] minister to our hearts lord
[20:51] draw us close to you lord a
[20:55] lord just in each heart tonight

[20:59] special
[21:01] lord may we just grow a little closer to
[21:04] you
[21:05] we ask it in jesus name amen
[21:12] amen thank you brother mark
[21:15] he had mentioned that to me that they
[21:17] had thought of coming
[21:19] but the church said no
[21:22] so as a brother who loves his church
[21:23] said then i'll stay with you
[21:26] brother robert figaro had said the same
[21:28] thing to me about that same time
[21:30] as their group had grown smaller you
[21:32] know
[21:33] but then the congregation said no we
[21:35] want to stay together so brother robert
[21:36] said then i'll stay with you so
[21:39] as god leads us we'll go
[21:42] won't it be wonderful there
[21:45] having no burdens to bear

[24:31] amen
[24:33] eye has not seen
[24:35] ear has not heard it says it's not even
[24:37] entered
[24:39] except to those to whom god has revealed
[24:41] if you read the end of that scripture
[24:43] and he gives you a glimpse and a taste
[24:45] of what it will be like so
[24:47] a couple of there's a couple of requests
[24:49] to bring to your attention here
[24:52] my sister-in-law elizabeth we call her
[24:55] misty
[24:57] sent a prayer request saying she's in
[24:59] much pain from the shingles that she's
[25:01] had for quite some time now and they
[25:02] just don't seem to be clearing up
[25:05] and the only comfortable position she's
[25:07] in is lying down the rest of time it's
[25:08] pain so it's been
[25:10] a struggle so she
[25:12] asked us for prayer so let's just
[25:13] believe that today
[25:16] after prayer the healing process will
[25:18] begin
[25:18] and we'll hear a testimony of that
[25:21] [Music]
[25:23] and brother
[25:24] diego asked that we would remember
[25:28] their daughter melinda that she would
[25:29] like
[25:31] us to remember or to uphold little james
[25:34] in prayer he has a high fever
[25:36] that doesn't want to go away james needs
[25:39] a touch from the lord so amen the little
[25:42] ones that all they can do
[25:45] is either cry or express it that way
[25:47] but god knows
[25:49] god knows the cry of the heart so
[25:51] you have a need
[25:53] say lord i have a need and we don't want
[25:57] to approach it in a way say lord this is
[25:58] what you have to do for me
[26:00] but rather lord i present my need to you
[26:03] you minister as you would know what's
[26:05] best if you'll stand
[26:08] brother i'll come up with you and
[26:11] and minister in prayer
[26:13] and hold that before the lord say lord i
[26:15] believe

[36:20] commune each day

[38:50] mr in about 85 86 they came over to the
[38:53] spanish tabernacle
[38:55] brother daniel ramirez brought them over
[38:58] they sang there
[39:00] and i said my goodness who are these
[39:02] folks listen to them sick the three of
[39:04] them
[39:05] and it's been a blessing ever since
[39:08] to get to know the families
[39:10] i've been just wonderful people
[39:13] speaking of the spiritual
[39:15] in the spirit of the lord
[39:19] [Music]
[39:38] gods of peace
[39:42] [Music]

[39:54] [Music]
[40:02] [Applause]
[40:03] [Music]
[40:08] in the presence
[40:11] [Music]
[40:28] is
[40:33] [Music]
[40:45] presence
[40:47] [Music]
[40:56] you made it
[40:58] when i'd come out he still wasn't there
[40:59] yet
[41:01] amen
[41:04] i was asked after service this morning
[41:08] about giving a missionary offering
[41:11] and if you have something you would like
[41:12] to give
[41:13] just put in the offering box if you want
[41:15] to mark it however but there's something
[41:18] we would definitely want to do
[41:20] and it was just a joy to see those folks
[41:23] worshiping the lord
[41:25] and
[41:28] we say they don't have anything compared
[41:30] to us maybe they don't but they have the
[41:32] same god and that's where the joy is
[41:35] that's where the worship comes from
[41:37] because you know
[41:39] this living god
[41:41] and you sing about him you
[41:44] you just believe on him and he draws
[41:46] near
[41:47] and as brother dan we were talking a
[41:49] little bit by dan evans
[41:51] he's not subject to our wants and our
[41:54] desires to tell him this is what you
[41:55] should do but rather we just surrender
[41:58] to him and he works
[42:01] and led him that's how it works right
[42:02] brother dan as we were sharing a couple
[42:04] of testimonies lord i need you to do
[42:06] this
[42:07] and he says no i just need you to wait
[42:09] on me and let me do it his way so
[42:12] this evening our brother
[42:14] martin with us and and i know that
[42:17] this morning was a blessing this morning
[42:19] was a good reminder
[42:21] that god is still god and he's still on
[42:23] the throne so let's stand and
[42:26] give them the time that he needs
[42:29] to minister what god has put on his
[42:30] heart
[42:32] and and you could just in your own way
[42:34] say lord you know my need
[42:36] you know my desires would you minister
[42:38] today and you draw and pull on that amen
[42:42] one more time in the presence of jobs
[42:45] [Music]
[43:09] troubles

[47:22] and it rained not
[47:24] on the earth by the space of three years
[47:26] and six months
[47:27] and he prayed again and the heavens gave

[48:28] he that has ear let him hear what the
[48:30] spirit saith unto the churches
[48:32] may the lord bless his word you may be
[48:34] seated
[48:35] i'd like to take a
[48:37] a text from james tonight
[48:40] on the
[48:42] the
[48:44] life of elijah that he was a man of like
[48:46] passions and we kind of tie that in from
[48:49] this morning speaking about
[48:51] elijah
[48:53] and him being the same yesterday today
[48:55] and forever
[48:58] the brothers over there
[49:00] in this last couple of weeks
[49:02] they had a cyclone hit them just after
[49:05] the meetings
[49:06] and uh it took out about 17 churches
[49:10] to right to the ground
[49:12] and
[49:13] many of the believers houses are gone
[49:16] and
[49:17] so i just had a few slides there i don't
[49:20] know did you have those brother or
[49:22] he says okay so he's he's bringing those
[49:25] up that's just the
[49:27] some of the devastation that was there
[49:31] that's in southern malawi
[49:34] it's it's it's an occurrence
[49:36] uh sometimes there's
[49:38] monsoons or things come in from
[49:40] mozambique and they cross over into
[49:42] malawi in 219 when we were there
[49:46] with the floods we were
[49:47] they experienced the same things
[49:49] but they come across in the low-lying
[49:51] areas and the believers a lot of
[49:54] believers are in those areas that's a
[49:56] vast area there so
[49:58] it it's devastation and i know you had a
[50:03] cyclone or something hit here in
[50:05] kentucky i think it was just recently
[50:07] or
[50:08] i don't know what it was a hurricane or
[50:10] and a
[50:11] tornado yeah and it just destroys
[50:14] a lot of property and they don't have
[50:17] much property
[50:18] but you can see how high the water is in
[50:21] their homes
[50:24] and
[50:25] the problem is uh
[50:27] the way they build the houses they don't
[50:28] put cement they can cannot afford that
[50:31] they just
[50:32] kind of dried mud sometimes
[50:34] and so when the
[50:35] when the rains come and you know the
[50:38] winds hit that it just crumbles
[50:41] so
[50:42] different uh pitchers they sent me and
[50:45] and that's usually the that's typical i
[50:48] mean that's that's no more than 200
[50:50] square feet
[50:51] i would say
[50:52] or less and that's typical it's hard to
[50:55] see i was over there
[50:57] maybe three weeks doing the flood relief
[50:59] and it's hard to walk through those
[51:01] villages and
[51:02] see those people in their homes and like
[51:05] two parents and three big adult children
[51:08] like teenage children and they're living
[51:10] in a something that size
[51:14] you know that's that's that's hard to
[51:15] see and then it's just a piece of mud on
[51:17] the ground
[51:19] so
[51:20] it's it's uh
[51:22] okay that's i just wanted to
[51:25] make you aware that that they are having
[51:27] you know they're having a relief
[51:29] uh fund and we're trying to help them to
[51:32] to get the churches back and to get some
[51:34] of the homes if we can we can help them
[51:36] so
[51:37] pray for them amen we can support them
[51:40] with our prayers
[51:41] and uh pray for them they
[51:44] sometimes they they don't have nowhere
[51:46] to go the government
[51:48] sometimes favors certain people in
[51:50] certain areas of the country
[51:52] and people that are loyal to the parties
[51:55] or to the government
[51:56] so they get the aid and stuff first if
[51:58] there is anything but mostly it's uh
[52:02] international organizations or you know
[52:04] that are that are coming in also and and
[52:06] helping and um i know several of the
[52:09] churches last time got together and and
[52:11] did some work there so so pray for them
[52:14] um
[52:16] as i said this morning uh the the amount
[52:19] of uh
[52:21] success of a revival
[52:23] or a convention like that is the amount
[52:25] of repentance and i didn't mention that
[52:28] many many ministers many people came and
[52:30] and
[52:31] made their
[52:32] made their confessions that they were
[52:34] wrong some of them were into false
[52:35] doctrine
[52:37] and uh different things like polygamy
[52:39] and uh
[52:40] practicing those things and uh
[52:43] and then
[52:44] you know just forsaking the assembling
[52:46] of themselves and some of them were you
[52:48] know just playing tapes and that was you
[52:51] know something that the correction
[52:53] came in and they came afterwards and
[52:56] said we want we want to get right with
[52:58] god
[52:59] we we believe it's wrong so
[53:02] you know that was a that was a big thing
[53:04] for me like that's why i thought it was
[53:05] the most successful meetings i was ever
[53:08] in
[53:09] in africa were these meetings and there
[53:12] was a lot of challenges
[53:14] and usually that's the way there is it
[53:16] is you know that yourselves as a church
[53:18] you you put something together you put
[53:19] harmony in the desert together there's a
[53:21] lot of challenges because there's a
[53:23] blessing
[53:25] waiting there and i really enjoyed the
[53:27] harmony in the desert also we were
[53:29] streaming that up up north a lot of
[53:32] people were streaming it you didn't know
[53:33] you had a lot of people watching you
[53:35] and it was uh we were right there with
[53:37] you and we enjoyed it so much
[53:39] so god is doing things amen god is
[53:42] bringing harmony and that's what we need
[53:44] we need unity
[53:46] and i i mentioned i preached on that the
[53:49] unity of the faith overseas and it's not
[53:52] a physical thing that we're all in one
[53:54] church but it's a spiritual invisible
[53:57] union of the bride of christ amen
[54:00] so we'll take this thought tonight uh
[54:02] get right to it on
[54:04] a man of like passions
[54:06] elijah was a man of like passions
[54:09] in in the book of kings also we read the
[54:12] great
[54:12] exploits that
[54:14] elijah had done
[54:16] and we know he was a great mighty
[54:17] prophet one of the greatest prophets
[54:19] there was and how that god used his
[54:22] spirit five times amen it was a faithful
[54:24] spirit but you know it wasn't the spirit
[54:26] of a man
[54:28] right amen we know that it wasn't the
[54:30] spirit of man it was the spirit of
[54:31] christ
[54:33] the spirit of elijah was the spirit of
[54:34] christ that's what he used five times
[54:36] and the prophet said if you can't see
[54:38] christ in every scripture go back and
[54:40] read it again
[54:41] it was christ
[54:42] all the way through and so elijah did
[54:45] some mighty works he you know he spoke
[54:48] like in in chapter one of verse or
[54:51] chapter 17 verse 1 he he said they'll
[54:53] not be do nor rain till i call for he
[54:56] spoke like god
[54:59] because he was god
[55:01] he was god for that hour
[55:03] for that position for that place amen
[55:06] and it's so close there
[55:09] amen and the prophet said it's so close
[55:11] you can be so close but you can be off
[55:14] if you make me god you're off
[55:16] but you can be so close saying that
[55:19] because that's how god speaks
[55:22] through a prophet so
[55:23] um
[55:25] james here you know he he talks uh he
[55:28] talks about the great works of elijah
[55:30] and how he prayed earnestly he actually
[55:32] you know he spoke like god he stopped
[55:34] the rain he controlled nature he was fed
[55:37] by ravens he created food
[55:39] oil and meal amen he raised the dead
[55:43] amen he rebuilt the altar then restored
[55:46] truth he turned the hearts of the
[55:47] children children of israel back to
[55:49] jehovah
[55:50] amen he called fire down from heaven he
[55:53] said if i be a man of god let fire come
[55:56] down from heaven where have you heard
[55:57] that before
[55:59] where you know where do you see that
[56:01] happen that's a man of god he said if i
[56:04] be a man of god
[56:06] amen if you know and we are the children
[56:10] of god where we serve the same god
[56:13] amen and we can we can claim the same
[56:16] authority
[56:18] amen and we you know he was a man of
[56:20] like passions and sometimes we elevate
[56:23] him way up here but he was a man down
[56:25] here too
[56:27] he had a human side
[56:29] and as we all do so he uh he he
[56:32] destroyed king's armies he was fed
[56:34] angels food he outran horses
[56:38] you imagine
[56:40] the things that happened in elijah's
[56:42] ministry in life
[56:43] you know and he went up to heaven in a
[56:45] whirlwind he's taken off the earth
[56:48] amen
[56:50] many great things and it's often the
[56:52] case that we judge things by sometimes
[56:55] one aspect of a man's life or or vice
[56:58] versa one failure of a man's life we
[57:02] judge sometimes things by just one thing
[57:05] or or what we read but there's always
[57:08] another side to it
[57:10] there's always something else that we're
[57:12] missing sometimes and and the message
[57:15] brings that out
[57:17] the message really brings that out and
[57:19] and the prophet brings it out in the
[57:20] message and we can we can glean a lot of
[57:23] golden nuggets there
[57:25] amen so hopefully we'll find a few
[57:27] tonight and shine them up and take them
[57:29] with us
[57:31] to home so
[57:32] but he did have a a human side and
[57:36] i want to preach to you tonight and
[57:37] speak to you on on that on that subject
[57:40] that
[57:41] we're talking about two u's
[57:44] the real you
[57:46] the inside you and the outside you
[57:47] there's really two of you
[57:49] amen there's not three but there's two
[57:51] of you the real you that c gene that
[57:54] that god that found you before the
[57:56] foundation of the world the prophet said
[57:58] that that's what we're speaking to the
[58:00] deity and there was a conflict between
[58:03] elijah's deity and his humanity
[58:06] there was a conflict and
[58:08] he was a man of like passions the
[58:10] scripture says passions means
[58:13] lapses or deviation from truth or
[58:16] uprightness
[58:18] he was a man that you know he had his
[58:21] lapses
[58:22] he had his failures like every prophet
[58:25] amen or he wasn't human
[58:27] if you're human you're gonna have them
[58:30] amen so that's that's what he's saying
[58:32] here james is taking that side of it
[58:35] right and we're reading in in the book
[58:37] of kings and we're just seeing the great
[58:39] exploits but also in the book of kings
[58:41] you'll see where elijah had
[58:44] lapses
[58:45] he had weaknesses
[58:47] he had complexes
[58:49] amen and so uh it's it's a you know
[58:55] misdeeds or mistakes besetting sins
[58:57] character flaws
[58:58] let me uh let me live with you long
[59:00] enough and i'll see yours
[59:03] if you live with me long enough like my
[59:05] wife now 38 years for 39 years
[59:08] she knows all of them
[59:10] every one of them but i know hers too
[59:14] so
[59:15] we're not perfect
[59:17] we're not it's you know they say
[59:19] in a perfect world well we're not in
[59:21] perfect bodies
[59:23] this is not a perfect body and this will
[59:26] never be perfected
[59:27] and you can never
[59:29] it can never be redeemed it has to be
[59:31] changed
[59:32] it's just a past house like the prophet
[59:35] said you're only living in a pesthouse
[59:37] until you put on that other coat
[59:40] amen you're going to another house to my
[59:42] father's house
[59:43] amen so um you know that the age we're
[59:47] living in is so complex and there's so
[59:50] much that plays on our mind there's so
[59:52] much stress there's so much pressure we
[59:54] live in it's a it's an age where it's
[59:56] almost the prophet said i'm fit to live
[59:59] and how much more is it now
[1:00:02] than it was in his day
[1:00:04] unfit to live there's no clean place
[1:00:07] this is the only clean place
[1:00:10] right in the house of god amen in your
[1:00:13] home
[1:00:14] there's the only clean place there is
[1:00:16] there's the only place the spirit of god
[1:00:18] can rest
[1:00:19] he wants a resting place
[1:00:22] amen he has to find a resting place and
[1:00:24] he finds his rest in us
[1:00:27] amen so it's an age where you know uh
[1:00:29] the greatest battle ever fought is
[1:00:31] intensified
[1:00:33] and uh i see it in myself
[1:00:35] i see it in myself i see uh you know
[1:00:38] with this covet and and the complexes
[1:00:40] that's produced and mental oppression
[1:00:43] mental sickness
[1:00:45] mental disease
[1:00:47] and you see people just going off they
[1:00:49] just lose it
[1:00:51] and violent
[1:00:52] and you know i said that's not my that's
[1:00:55] not that's not where i want to dwell
[1:00:58] i don't want to dwell there
[1:01:00] hey man i don't want to get caught up in
[1:01:01] that you know when i was in africa this
[1:01:04] time i i made sure i just took a a fast
[1:01:07] from
[1:01:08] social media
[1:01:10] hey man i didn't want to read the news
[1:01:13] anymore
[1:01:14] you know and and there and me and my
[1:01:16] wife we have sometimes differences of
[1:01:18] opinion
[1:01:19] and when and when i'm listening to the
[1:01:20] news and i'm grumbling and then she's
[1:01:22] grumbling and then we're just grumbling
[1:01:24] and i'm saying what is this doing to us
[1:01:27] we're feeding on that stuff too much
[1:01:30] you know i mentioned in africa also i
[1:01:33] asked the brothers i said do you have
[1:01:35] any mamba snakes here they said yes i
[1:01:38] said are they ever on the highway no no
[1:01:40] they're mostly in the bush
[1:01:41] we see them
[1:01:43] you know the mamba and the prophet had a
[1:01:45] dream about our vision about the mama
[1:01:48] and he said it come up on the road it
[1:01:50] was chasing a brother he was trying to
[1:01:52] jump out of the way you all know the
[1:01:53] story
[1:01:54] and uh he said it ever strikes him
[1:01:57] it's death
[1:01:58] amen and and i thought you know that
[1:02:00] mambo was on the highway
[1:02:03] and that's that was odd that struck me
[1:02:04] odd why was he on the highway because
[1:02:06] what what do we call the internet
[1:02:08] the information highway
[1:02:11] and i said young people watch out
[1:02:13] watch out and old people too
[1:02:16] these old people
[1:02:18] watch out how much news you listen to
[1:02:21] how much you feed your spirit on that
[1:02:23] stuff
[1:02:24] amen because and and it's a blessing for
[1:02:26] some of them they don't have some of
[1:02:28] them don't have phones they don't have
[1:02:30] internet
[1:02:31] and things and and they're more blessed
[1:02:33] it's just it's a simpler life it's it's
[1:02:35] a lot less stress
[1:02:38] saints amen
[1:02:40] you know the devils tries to pull one
[1:02:42] over on us and get us involved and draw
[1:02:44] us in take sides and let's not do that
[1:02:48] amen
[1:02:49] let's take take sides with jesus
[1:02:52] take signs with the word amen whatsoever
[1:02:54] things are holy whatsoever things are
[1:02:56] good whatever things are a good report
[1:02:58] think on those things speak on those
[1:03:00] things and then stay away from those
[1:03:03] negative things i've seen it in europe
[1:03:05] just divide families divide churches
[1:03:08] amen it's a spirit of the age amen and
[1:03:10] it's on that highway
[1:03:12] you know you just do without that for a
[1:03:13] while wow
[1:03:15] just the stress that everything's
[1:03:17] you know you don't we don't have to know
[1:03:19] everything
[1:03:21] we don't have to know the the the last
[1:03:23] events the last days
[1:03:26] we know the time we're living in
[1:03:28] we know it's a time of judgment but
[1:03:30] there's mercy in a time of judgment
[1:03:32] amen so uh
[1:03:34] now elijah didn't think that he had
[1:03:37] complexes
[1:03:38] because uh we can go to the scripture on
[1:03:41] that i don't know if i'll get to it
[1:03:42] we'll see but
[1:03:45] you know he didn't think he did but he
[1:03:46] did james said he did
[1:03:48] he was a man of like passions
[1:03:50] temptations
[1:03:51] like the lord he was tempted
[1:03:54] but without sin
[1:03:56] right he was tempted but without sin and
[1:03:59] and and it's not a sin to be tempted
[1:04:02] it's not a sin to have have oppression
[1:04:04] sometimes or be mentally oppressed or or
[1:04:07] or you know or bombarded by things
[1:04:09] because that's because we're human we're
[1:04:11] that just means we're human
[1:04:14] we're not robots we're not we're not
[1:04:16] sawdust we're not pieces of metal
[1:04:19] amen
[1:04:20] we're human beings and god knows we have
[1:04:22] weaknesses
[1:04:24] but he's made a provision for those
[1:04:26] things praise god for the blood of the
[1:04:28] lamb
[1:04:29] greater than all my sins greater than
[1:04:32] all my iniquities
[1:04:34] paul said the same thing he struggled
[1:04:36] with it paul did he said you know in
[1:04:38] romans 7 he said the things that i would
[1:04:40] do i do not
[1:04:42] the things i wouldn't do those things i
[1:04:44] do
[1:04:45] look at the prophet when he when he when
[1:04:47] he tried to explain the third the third
[1:04:49] pole
[1:04:50] and the angel came and stood there with
[1:04:52] his arms he said you did exactly what i
[1:04:55] told you not to do he said with his
[1:04:57] stern eyes
[1:04:59] oh
[1:05:00] what a feeling that must have been
[1:05:02] for the prophet he says i know he said
[1:05:05] i'm a dummy i'm i'm stupid i i i'm sorry
[1:05:10] and there was grace
[1:05:12] now now you learn from that let's go on
[1:05:15] this is how you do don't explain this
[1:05:18] amen so we we get into trouble sometimes
[1:05:21] like that but
[1:05:23] we can overcome our weaknesses
[1:05:25] we can overcome our faults and we can
[1:05:28] overcome them they might not ever leave
[1:05:31] but we can overcome them that's why i
[1:05:33] read revelation 3 and 20 to him that
[1:05:36] overcometh
[1:05:38] will sit with me
[1:05:40] it's you're always going to have this
[1:05:42] sticky flesh
[1:05:43] this is always going to be with us so we
[1:05:46] might as well fight the good fight of
[1:05:48] faith
[1:05:49] fight the war that's going on within us
[1:05:52] overcome ourselves
[1:05:54] before we overcome something else
[1:05:56] amen and
[1:05:57] i think that sometimes we we we've got
[1:06:00] to be aware where the battle is really
[1:06:02] raging amen and it's it's just not it's
[1:06:05] not with you know the government right
[1:06:08] now it's not with uh uh
[1:06:10] pierre trudeau or
[1:06:12] uh justin trudeau sorry i'm talking
[1:06:14] about his father
[1:06:15] or or or biden or anyone else it's not
[1:06:18] that's not where the war the war is here
[1:06:21] the war is within us
[1:06:23] and if we can overcome that if we can
[1:06:25] you know uh find satan's tactics
[1:06:28] and and and and and take and overcome
[1:06:31] them
[1:06:32] amen then we've got
[1:06:34] then we got power
[1:06:36] and authority
[1:06:37] with character
[1:06:39] character to handle that power
[1:06:42] god doesn't give it out sometimes
[1:06:43] because we don't have the character to
[1:06:45] handle it
[1:06:46] they meant it sparingly the prophet it
[1:06:48] can be sparingly given out because we
[1:06:50] need the character
[1:06:52] so we got to overcome right here
[1:06:55] right now right in our own church right
[1:06:57] in our own lives right in our own homes
[1:06:59] we got overcome right in our own homes
[1:07:01] that's where it starts that's what we
[1:07:03] bring into church
[1:07:05] i'm going to preach
[1:07:06] i'm going to preach it anyway
[1:07:09] you know you might you might not enjoy
[1:07:10] it like the mission say well the mission
[1:07:12] report was good but that was enough
[1:07:14] but i'm just going to preach there and
[1:07:16] say preach what's on your heart
[1:07:19] so
[1:07:20] when we get into it now the trouble is
[1:07:22] sometimes
[1:07:24] people
[1:07:25] i'll say people we
[1:07:27] we don't want to overcome them
[1:07:30] we're stubborn
[1:07:31] and we cuddle sometimes we cuddle those
[1:07:34] weaknesses
[1:07:36] sometimes we baby them
[1:07:38] because sometimes it makes us feel good
[1:07:41] oh ouch
[1:07:43] sometimes it you know
[1:07:45] it's not that you can't overcome them
[1:07:47] it's you won't overcome
[1:07:49] god help us
[1:07:50] amen to want to overcome to be
[1:07:53] overcomers in this age
[1:07:55] we're predestinated to be an overcomer
[1:07:58] amen nothing can stop us saints nothing
[1:08:01] can stop us and we don't want to let our
[1:08:03] flesh stop us
[1:08:05] or any any of those things so
[1:08:08] we want to
[1:08:09] we like to procrastinate
[1:08:11] it's human that's a weakness
[1:08:14] and uh
[1:08:15] you know like like moses he used his
[1:08:17] weaknesses as excuses
[1:08:20] what was he doing he was cuddling them
[1:08:23] i'm comfortable here
[1:08:25] comfortable with this i'm comfortable i
[1:08:27] don't like it but i can co-inhabit
[1:08:30] god help us not to co-inhabit we got to
[1:08:33] overcome it
[1:08:35] whatever it is and the holy spirit can
[1:08:37] put his finger on that tonight
[1:08:39] so you know
[1:08:41] maybe we'll always have them like i said
[1:08:43] but we can overcome them and they can't
[1:08:46] stop us
[1:08:47] unless you let it stop you
[1:08:50] amen don't let nothing stop you
[1:08:54] don't let yourself the other you
[1:08:57] amen stop you you feel tired you don't
[1:08:59] want to go to church well just drag him
[1:09:02] to church
[1:09:03] you're going to church
[1:09:05] amen you're going to hear the word
[1:09:07] you're going to hear the saints sing and
[1:09:08] rejoice and praise god and feel the
[1:09:11] atmosphere of the holy spirit
[1:09:13] what's wrong with that
[1:09:15] but it's the battle of getting there
[1:09:18] and now in this age satan has made it so
[1:09:20] much easier through the internet
[1:09:23] amen it's a trick of the devil
[1:09:26] sometimes you know we just fall for
[1:09:28] something it looks so good
[1:09:30] but it can harm us too
[1:09:32] if we're not if we're not careful
[1:09:35] so there's a difference between uh human
[1:09:38] weaknesses and complexes i'll use them
[1:09:41] together but there's a difference
[1:09:43] between them
[1:09:44] a weakness which we all have weaknesses
[1:09:49] if we dwell on them
[1:09:51] if we fixate
[1:09:54] if we make them bigger than god
[1:09:57] we make our problems bigger than god
[1:10:00] so then he can't solve them if we make
[1:10:02] them bigger than god he he cannot solve
[1:10:04] them
[1:10:05] because we're the ones that are making
[1:10:06] them bigger than him
[1:10:08] right so we
[1:10:09] we want to not fixate we we understand
[1:10:12] we'll all have a human weakness
[1:10:15] of one sword or the other because we all
[1:10:17] we all you know are born under
[1:10:20] different circumstances
[1:10:22] and you know sometimes uh like the
[1:10:24] prophet said it's a it's like a a plant
[1:10:26] that a rock
[1:10:28] sits on that plant and it grows up
[1:10:30] you know in an angle
[1:10:32] so it's kind of off and you know we're
[1:10:35] all that way we're all really the human
[1:10:37] race right from adam and eve are
[1:10:39] dysfunctional
[1:10:41] we're all dysfunctional
[1:10:42] amen and we need god
[1:10:44] you know when i got saved my brother
[1:10:46] said now oh now you've got a crutch
[1:10:48] you know now you got religion and you
[1:10:49] got a crutch and uh you know i i don't
[1:10:52] need that but he needs it today
[1:10:55] and he wants me to pray for him
[1:10:57] amen but that's what they see you see
[1:10:59] that's all they see at first they just
[1:11:01] say oh you've got a crush i said well
[1:11:02] who's not limping
[1:11:05] who's not who's not sick
[1:11:08] it's a sick that need a physician
[1:11:10] and you know uh i could go on about that
[1:11:12] but you know it's
[1:11:14] people don't see those things we we all
[1:11:16] need god's help and i'm i'm i'm thankful
[1:11:19] that i can raise my hands and say yeah i
[1:11:21] needed god
[1:11:23] yeah you know i couldn't quit drinking i
[1:11:26] couldn't quit those things god took it
[1:11:28] from me
[1:11:29] amen i needed god that gives god praise
[1:11:31] see that give god power amen in your
[1:11:34] life when you give him the glory and and
[1:11:36] and people realize oh you know well
[1:11:38] maybe i should try that
[1:11:41] right there's another there's a better
[1:11:42] way there's a better life
[1:11:44] so so sometimes you know we fixate
[1:11:49] on our weaknesses or
[1:11:51] things that have been passed down to to
[1:11:54] us
[1:11:54] and
[1:11:56] that makes you know when we fixate it on
[1:11:58] it then it becomes a complex
[1:12:01] then it really does some damage
[1:12:04] that's when it really can can
[1:12:06] can throw you off and take you out of
[1:12:08] the will of god
[1:12:10] so we don't want it to get to that point
[1:12:12] pray and that's why he james said pray
[1:12:14] for one another
[1:12:16] confess your faults
[1:12:18] confess your weakness brother i just i
[1:12:20] struggle with this you know i i i have
[1:12:23] confidence you as a brother or sister
[1:12:25] you you won't tattle it all around you
[1:12:27] just pray with me will you
[1:12:29] have the church pray whatever you know
[1:12:31] that we're too proud
[1:12:34] sometimes we're just too proud to say
[1:12:36] that
[1:12:36] and uh it's a complex
[1:12:39] it becomes a complex it becomes a fear
[1:12:43] so uh you know it's like that sister the
[1:12:45] brother branham talked about uh
[1:12:48] or i think it was in one of the books
[1:12:50] she says she was always afraid of storms
[1:12:53] and she didn't know why but her father
[1:12:55] had been in a storm that he saw a dead
[1:12:58] child on the road
[1:13:00] and that was before she was born
[1:13:03] you know that
[1:13:05] yeah before she was born
[1:13:08] and that fear of storms was in that
[1:13:10] sister's life all her life and she
[1:13:12] didn't know why
[1:13:14] and the prophet said oh i see him
[1:13:17] coming down the road with the horses the
[1:13:19] horses stop
[1:13:21] there's a dead baby in the in the road
[1:13:24] and uh he said your father just the
[1:13:26] horses just stopped and your father had
[1:13:28] that fear
[1:13:29] and he said that's why you're afraid of
[1:13:31] storms
[1:13:32] it's not my you know
[1:13:34] how would we ever know that
[1:13:37] what's passed down to us that we don't
[1:13:39] know
[1:13:40] sometimes things that happen in my
[1:13:42] father and my grandfather and my father
[1:13:45] my all my father's brothers were in the
[1:13:46] second world war my grandfather was in
[1:13:48] the second world war out of hartford
[1:13:50] connecticut
[1:13:51] and uh things that they saw
[1:13:54] things that they experienced passed down
[1:13:58] and so we are all in need of god
[1:14:01] we are all in need of help
[1:14:04] amen and and and and we can we have a
[1:14:06] place
[1:14:08] we have a place we have there is a bomb
[1:14:10] in gilead tonight
[1:14:12] amen and it's in god's word and so
[1:14:16] it cannot stop us these things cannot
[1:14:18] stop us unless we let them amen
[1:14:20] um
[1:14:21] and we don't want to do that
[1:14:23] we want to move on move forward i was
[1:14:26] watching uh the life story of uh corey
[1:14:30] tenbu how many
[1:14:31] ever read her story corey tembo
[1:14:34] yeah it's a good story young people you
[1:14:36] want to read that story she was she was
[1:14:39] a young person
[1:14:40] and uh she fell in love
[1:14:43] and and then because of the the class or
[1:14:45] the financial situation then uh she was
[1:14:49] turned down
[1:14:50] and uh that was a great sorrow in her
[1:14:52] life but she instead of dwelling on that
[1:14:55] she turned her life and she started to
[1:14:57] help
[1:14:59] people and people less fortunate
[1:15:01] and people that had disabilities and she
[1:15:04] started to help them
[1:15:06] and that took up her life she started to
[1:15:08] minister saints you can minister
[1:15:12] you can minister to your neighbor
[1:15:14] you can minister to those that are
[1:15:16] around you to the sick that you know
[1:15:18] amen you can do those things and and and
[1:15:21] that gets your mind off of your own
[1:15:23] problems and your own weaknesses
[1:15:26] your own failures your own shortcomings
[1:15:28] when you do something for someone else
[1:15:31] what does the prophet say when you live
[1:15:33] for someone else you're looking heaven
[1:15:35] in the face
[1:15:36] it's so simple saints
[1:15:38] it it's not explaining the seven
[1:15:41] thunders or the third poll
[1:15:43] it's right here just the prophet said
[1:15:45] after he preached those great messages
[1:15:47] he said now just be simple live simple
[1:15:50] christian lives said just leave a live a
[1:15:53] plain christian life
[1:15:55] let the light shine from you amen and
[1:15:57] minister to people
[1:15:59] minister to people at work
[1:16:02] at school
[1:16:03] you can help people
[1:16:05] amen
[1:16:06] so sometimes we're looking way up here
[1:16:09] and it's right down here where we live
[1:16:12] and you'll see the spoken word
[1:16:14] you'll see the supernatural
[1:16:16] you just do the simple
[1:16:18] things so he said you know confess your
[1:16:21] faults one to another and uh
[1:16:24] you know uh corey ten boom she you know
[1:16:28] the story she
[1:16:29] she had uh
[1:16:31] hidden they were hiding
[1:16:32] the jewish people in their home you know
[1:16:34] the story and
[1:16:36] she uh
[1:16:37] they they were found out and
[1:16:39] and uh they were betrayed by someone
[1:16:42] they trusted
[1:16:43] and uh so they were sent to the to the
[1:16:47] to the work camps and her father was
[1:16:49] aging and he died very shortly after
[1:16:52] after going there her sister was ailing
[1:16:54] and sick
[1:16:55] and wasn't in good health and couldn't
[1:16:57] take the the cold and the bitterness of
[1:16:59] the camps and she was slowly dying
[1:17:02] and they had a pact together they stayed
[1:17:05] together they smuggled their bible in
[1:17:07] and
[1:17:08] uh this one time she said uh
[1:17:10] you know she was uh
[1:17:12] they were hiding the bible under their
[1:17:14] pillows and i just thought it was so
[1:17:16] striking that her sister said
[1:17:18] you know she said i can't take corey
[1:17:20] said i i can't take the lice anymore the
[1:17:23] lice in the beds i i can't it's driving
[1:17:26] me crazy
[1:17:27] and and then her sister said no no don't
[1:17:29] look at it that way because she said
[1:17:31] because of the lice
[1:17:33] the guards can't get the bible they
[1:17:35] don't want to touch the bed
[1:17:39] you can thank god for a lot of things
[1:17:41] but i don't know if i've ever thanked
[1:17:42] them for lice
[1:17:44] but her sister had faith
[1:17:47] she had a faith and that kept corey
[1:17:50] going and that boosted her faith see we
[1:17:53] can help one another
[1:17:54] and she just she just maintained it and
[1:17:56] anyway finally she you know she saw a
[1:17:59] guard
[1:18:00] uh
[1:18:01] when her sister was too weak to to do
[1:18:03] the shoveling and things they were
[1:18:05] making them do that a guard started to
[1:18:07] beat her
[1:18:08] and beat her with the shovel and beat
[1:18:10] her and beat her and she couldn't get
[1:18:12] that out of her mind
[1:18:14] that scene of him
[1:18:15] of the guard beating her sister and then
[1:18:17] she died shortly after that so uh later
[1:18:20] in a when she said to her her sister
[1:18:23] said before she died corey when you get
[1:18:25] out of here you tell this you still tell
[1:18:27] the story of christ around the world
[1:18:29] and she did
[1:18:31] she did
[1:18:32] they managed quite a quite a good
[1:18:34] testimony too
[1:18:36] and you know she said she was in one of
[1:18:39] the meetings and and one of the the
[1:18:41] guard actually that was beating her
[1:18:44] sister
[1:18:45] came to that meeting
[1:18:47] in america
[1:18:49] had been converted and he said i have
[1:18:51] become a christian or she said i forget
[1:18:53] it was a man guard or a woman guard but
[1:18:55] said i have become a christian
[1:18:57] and i want to ask you to forgive me
[1:19:01] i want to ask for your forgiveness
[1:19:03] and she looked at her and she said it
[1:19:05] just went back in her mind that day
[1:19:09] seeing her sister being beaten like that
[1:19:11] and frail as she was
[1:19:13] and she she just looked at him for a few
[1:19:15] minutes
[1:19:16] and then all of a sudden she said she
[1:19:18] just reached out her
[1:19:20] hand she just put her hand out
[1:19:24] and she said i forgive you
[1:19:26] and she said when she did that she said
[1:19:29] the love of god just come right down
[1:19:31] through her and flowed to that that
[1:19:33] guard
[1:19:35] there's nothing more powerful than that
[1:19:38] amen there's nothing more powerful than
[1:19:39] the love of god
[1:19:41] oh love of god how rich and pure
[1:19:44] how measureless
[1:19:46] oh my you know
[1:19:48] i thought i thought about that testimony
[1:19:50] because i i think in this day and age
[1:19:53] when you know the love of many will wax
[1:19:55] clothes cold we get so closed up we get
[1:19:59] hardened
[1:20:00] we get hardened among ourselves
[1:20:02] and that love doesn't flow but i can
[1:20:04] feel it here today
[1:20:07] i can feel it here today can you feel it
[1:20:09] my spirit testifies
[1:20:11] amen that's what we need
[1:20:14] let that love of god flow
[1:20:16] amen and the one thing we have in the
[1:20:18] message we have a message complex of
[1:20:21] unforgiveness
[1:20:23] we get we get to a place where someone
[1:20:25] crosses us the wrong way and it's just
[1:20:28] that's it
[1:20:29] that's once that's twice you know we
[1:20:33] we
[1:20:34] we have to get over that
[1:20:37] we have to get over that and not not be
[1:20:39] unforgiving be forgiving
[1:20:41] jesus taught us in his prayer he said if
[1:20:43] you don't forgive you will not be
[1:20:45] forgiven
[1:20:46] amen god help us to do those things and
[1:20:49] you know we we believe we've got the the
[1:20:52] cream of the crop
[1:20:54] amen we believe we got the message for
[1:20:56] rapturing faith we need to just do we
[1:20:59] need to just build that stature of a
[1:21:01] perfect man
[1:21:02] just keep working on that
[1:21:04] amen on that patience have patience with
[1:21:07] one another amen pray for one another
[1:21:10] have temperance and and godliness around
[1:21:13] one another respect even if you disagree
[1:21:16] we can still love each other
[1:21:18] we can have differences the prophet said
[1:21:20] we can disagree bitterly
[1:21:22] and still love
[1:21:23] i was just listening to brother perry
[1:21:26] that testimony he gave about when
[1:21:28] brother branham and him were driving
[1:21:30] and uh brother branham was telling him
[1:21:32] about some brothers that had done some
[1:21:33] bad things
[1:21:35] and then he and then later in the day he
[1:21:37] says well maybe if we had enough time we
[1:21:39] could go over and see them
[1:21:40] and brother perry said
[1:21:42] i'm surprised at you brother branham
[1:21:45] you know after what you said he said i
[1:21:47] felt like giving him the fivefold
[1:21:48] ministry
[1:21:50] you know a couple of those fivefold
[1:21:51] ministries
[1:21:53] he was riled up he got him riled up
[1:21:56] and i probably would have been too my
[1:21:58] flesh would have got the better of me
[1:22:00] you did that to the prophet and uh
[1:22:02] so he said i'm surprised at you brother
[1:22:05] perry
[1:22:06] he said you know it's not
[1:22:09] our our attitude towards them
[1:22:12] you know god's love is
[1:22:14] our attitude to towards them not their
[1:22:16] attitude towards us
[1:22:18] or not what they've done to us
[1:22:20] and i remember him just saying that and
[1:22:22] he said you know brother perry was
[1:22:24] saying i'm i'm getting there i'm
[1:22:26] learning
[1:22:27] right have have we come any further now
[1:22:30] amen that's what it takes
[1:22:33] he said you know
[1:22:34] you be uh you have anything odd against
[1:22:36] a brother you're danger of hellfire
[1:22:39] right so
[1:22:40] we've got to be loving people
[1:22:42] forgiving people and take our stand at
[1:22:44] the same time
[1:22:46] believe the word and preach it pure
[1:22:49] preach it like it is preaching with the
[1:22:50] gloves off
[1:22:52] amen but yet loving
[1:22:54] and i appreciate you know some of the
[1:22:57] brothers that i've had fellowship with
[1:22:59] here and
[1:23:00] and their spirits amen the christ-like
[1:23:02] spirit they've had and i'm a little
[1:23:04] rough sometimes around the edges and i
[1:23:06] you know i get around brothers like that
[1:23:08] and i say oh boy i'm coming short
[1:23:11] i wish i had that kind of
[1:23:13] that gentleness that love that spirit of
[1:23:15] christ that reaches out
[1:23:16] amen and i want i want to be see we
[1:23:19] can't we can't all be the same and and
[1:23:21] that's why we need a body
[1:23:23] and we learn from one another and we we
[1:23:25] give and we take
[1:23:27] amen and it helps us as a body and we
[1:23:30] supply every need to to every joint amen
[1:23:33] so bear with one another
[1:23:36] bear one another's burdens amen pray for
[1:23:38] one another you well you want no faults
[1:23:40] the prophet said uh confess them
[1:23:44] don't hide them
[1:23:46] don't hide them confess them
[1:23:48] amen and and and god will give you the
[1:23:51] power and strength to overcome them
[1:23:53] especially when you have people praying
[1:23:54] for you
[1:23:55] amen so i i've had to do that many times
[1:23:58] and
[1:23:59] um
[1:24:00] so
[1:24:01] so when it it comes to our weaknesses so
[1:24:04] we fix fixate on them they become
[1:24:06] complexes and you know a complex
[1:24:09] sometimes we're trying to
[1:24:11] sometimes we have a complex that we want
[1:24:13] to try to change someone else
[1:24:15] instead of changing ourselves
[1:24:18] we want to change the other person
[1:24:20] and and sometimes that's that's the way
[1:24:23] you know you learn as you go on in life
[1:24:25] and you get older and you're married a
[1:24:27] long time you know
[1:24:29] you're not going to change that person
[1:24:31] sometimes you're going to have to put
[1:24:33] some
[1:24:33] some honey on the salt block you know
[1:24:36] you're going to have to do something to
[1:24:38] to change the atmosphere you know and uh
[1:24:40] that that's you know
[1:24:42] if it if you're always trying to change
[1:24:44] someone then you've got a complex it's
[1:24:46] not them it's you got the complex you're
[1:24:49] trying to change the other person
[1:24:51] and when we should just pray for them
[1:24:53] pray for one another i pray for my wife
[1:24:55] she prays for me
[1:24:57] amen and like i said we're not perfect
[1:25:01] but we we love each other and we've got
[1:25:03] christ and there's nothing we can't
[1:25:06] settle
[1:25:07] there's nothing we can't forgive
[1:25:09] hallelujah isn't that wonderful amen
[1:25:12] that god god could give you brother a
[1:25:14] greater thing besides salvation he give
[1:25:16] you a godly wife
[1:25:19] amen a godly husband
[1:25:21] amen so it's when we fixate you know
[1:25:24] it's like those two sisters remember
[1:25:26] those two sisters the prophet talked
[1:25:27] about
[1:25:28] one of them
[1:25:29] was uh they were i don't know if there
[1:25:31] were twins but one of them
[1:25:32] uh lost her mind and the parents came
[1:25:35] asked brother brandon to pray
[1:25:38] and uh he knew the child from from a
[1:25:40] young age and she had lost her mind
[1:25:42] where the other sister was tough she was
[1:25:45] weaker and she was teased about her hair
[1:25:48] about her her belief as a christian and
[1:25:51] the way she behaved no parties and no
[1:25:53] makeup and no pants and different things
[1:25:55] she was just it all came just
[1:25:58] overwhelmed her
[1:26:00] and uh she she kind of lost she just
[1:26:03] kind of lost her mind
[1:26:04] and the prophet prayed and prayed with
[1:26:07] her and nothing happened and then he was
[1:26:09] just sitting with her
[1:26:11] uh
[1:26:12] at the end of the at the end of the
[1:26:13] testimony and he was sitting with her
[1:26:15] and the spirit of the lord just showed
[1:26:17] him
[1:26:18] that
[1:26:18] he called her name i forget what it was
[1:26:20] mary or something he said mary
[1:26:23] because she was bumbling off on
[1:26:25] weird things and saying
[1:26:28] demonic things and all kinds of things
[1:26:30] and
[1:26:31] he said mary when you were young you
[1:26:33] always wanted to marry a preacher
[1:26:38] and
[1:26:39] she just looked at him
[1:26:41] and she came out of it
[1:26:44] said that was her complex
[1:26:46] because she was rejected and she had all
[1:26:48] that against her and and she would she
[1:26:51] thought she'd never get married to a
[1:26:52] preacher that drove her into a complex
[1:26:56] amen and she lost she kind of lost her
[1:26:58] spirit just drifted
[1:27:00] her mind just drifted
[1:27:02] and and she came right back to herself
[1:27:06] amen because it was something that was
[1:27:09] laying there all the time that no one
[1:27:11] else would have known
[1:27:14] amen
[1:27:15] but the holy spirit knows he's the
[1:27:18] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:27:21] the heart
[1:27:22] he knows what we've been through as ch
[1:27:24] children
[1:27:25] he knows what we've experienced he knows
[1:27:28] our scars he knows our wounds he knows
[1:27:31] our complexes
[1:27:33] he knows our weaknesses but with the
[1:27:35] holy spirit we can overcome anything
[1:27:38] in our lives but we don't want to let it
[1:27:41] get to that place
[1:27:43] amen
[1:27:44] talk to somebody
[1:27:46] amen a lot of times i know situations
[1:27:50] and and people that in the message
[1:27:52] around the message that committed
[1:27:53] suicide and if they just could have
[1:27:56] talked to somebody
[1:27:58] and i know a a personal friend
[1:28:01] uh that
[1:28:02] that that it happened to and
[1:28:04] my son that was not serving the lord at
[1:28:06] the time was staying in my home
[1:28:08] and uh
[1:28:10] this this this believer was having huge
[1:28:14] issues
[1:28:15] and a real complex and i was away i was
[1:28:18] in africa somewhere and and so he was
[1:28:21] staying in my home and and my son he sat
[1:28:24] down with my son on the bed and they
[1:28:26] talked for about he said my son said
[1:28:28] about two hours and he told him a lot
[1:28:30] about himself
[1:28:32] and he just unburdened himself
[1:28:34] to my son
[1:28:36] and and sam i know if you know sam
[1:28:38] furthermore he's he's a real listener
[1:28:41] and he's just such a level-headed headed
[1:28:43] kid you know and i believe god's dealing
[1:28:46] with him
[1:28:47] but uh
[1:28:48] god had him there
[1:28:50] for that brother
[1:28:52] just to listen to him
[1:28:53] and tell him things that he wouldn't
[1:28:55] have told anyone else
[1:28:58] and it just unburdened him
[1:29:01] so we don't know you know just sometimes
[1:29:03] be a listener
[1:29:05] we got to be a listener sometimes oh
[1:29:07] i've heard that before be a listener
[1:29:09] maybe they need to to talk they just
[1:29:11] need to talk
[1:29:13] amen and and we're so me oriented we
[1:29:17] have a me complex
[1:29:19] so i'm talking about complexes now we
[1:29:22] have a message come we have sometimes an
[1:29:24] unforgiveness complex
[1:29:25] amen it becomes a complex
[1:29:28] and we need to get over that elijah had
[1:29:30] to get over that to see the rapture
[1:29:32] and i hope we don't i hope we can get to
[1:29:34] that but that's where satan will make
[1:29:37] his stronghold
[1:29:38] when he becomes a complex
[1:29:41] don't let anything become a complex to
[1:29:43] you you got a difference with a brother
[1:29:45] a difference with a sister don't let it
[1:29:46] be a complex go out of your way to be
[1:29:48] nice to them go out of your way to do
[1:29:51] something kind
[1:29:53] to pray for them
[1:29:54] amen like the prophet did
[1:29:57] like the prophet did he said just pray
[1:29:59] for them
[1:30:01] so something that we sometimes over you
[1:30:04] know we we don't see but we're handed
[1:30:06] down things sometimes that it's not our
[1:30:09] fault
[1:30:11] it's not your fault
[1:30:12] some of this is and and you know people
[1:30:15] blame themselves and the devil just
[1:30:16] loves that game and he jumps on that
[1:30:19] condemnation
[1:30:20] and then there's no victory there's no
[1:30:22] joy
[1:30:23] there's no ministry
[1:30:25] in your life and you're not overcoming
[1:30:28] and you're stagnant you're staying in
[1:30:29] the same place why because you've got to
[1:30:31] overcome that thing
[1:30:32] you're going to overcome that thing i
[1:30:33] know one brother that was in edmonton
[1:30:36] and he was a native man and he was i
[1:30:38] really believe he was called to preach
[1:30:40] the gospel but he had such an
[1:30:42] inferiority complex
[1:30:44] like he would fellowship with me and a
[1:30:46] few others but he didn't like to be
[1:30:48] around believers he didn't like to be in
[1:30:50] in even in church it was hard for him
[1:30:52] but he you know he did start to speak a
[1:30:55] little bit
[1:30:56] but he had to overcome that thing
[1:30:59] you see he had to overcome it and and
[1:31:01] because he wouldn't i said
[1:31:04] his name was keith and i said brother
[1:31:06] keith you know what the prophet said if
[1:31:08] you have a complex about something he
[1:31:09] said just do the opposite
[1:31:11] you don't like to be around people be
[1:31:13] around people
[1:31:14] force yourself i mean you don't have to
[1:31:16] be the social butterfly
[1:31:19] but you should press you should force
[1:31:21] yourself
[1:31:22] to get to get in the company of the
[1:31:24] saints i mean that's where we rub one
[1:31:26] another
[1:31:27] and that's where we strengthen one
[1:31:28] another amen so uh
[1:31:32] it can do a lot of harm and he never
[1:31:34] went in the ministry
[1:31:35] i i believe later he just you know he
[1:31:37] just kind of faded away
[1:31:39] but i definitely believe that that there
[1:31:41] was something in his life
[1:31:43] you know and uh i believe brother
[1:31:44] branham's brother had the same call in
[1:31:46] his life brother branham said he had a
[1:31:48] call in his life to preach the gospel
[1:31:49] also but because of complexes
[1:31:53] women popularity or money
[1:31:55] right there are three things and so we
[1:31:57] got to watch out for so
[1:31:59] many times the satan finds a stronghold
[1:32:02] in weaknesses
[1:32:04] look at judges chapter six we won't turn
[1:32:06] to it but you know the story of gideon
[1:32:08] he had a complex he had a victim complex
[1:32:12] because you know they would come in the
[1:32:14] philistines and take all the all the
[1:32:16] food and everything and he was he was
[1:32:19] thrashing wheat behind behind something
[1:32:21] hiding and and then the angel of the
[1:32:23] lord comes
[1:32:24] the prophet comes and speaks to him what
[1:32:28] you know thou mighty man of valor
[1:32:30] and and and gideon says judges six you
[1:32:32] can read it for yourself
[1:32:34] you know if god is with us where be all
[1:32:36] his miracles
[1:32:37] why isn't he delivering us from this you
[1:32:40] know and that question becomes a you can
[1:32:42] make that if you keep that attitude
[1:32:45] questioning god why why me why this why
[1:32:50] now it becomes a complex
[1:32:53] and and you become a victim

[1:32:59] have to be we don't have to cower under

[1:33:47] very supernatural things and she taught
[1:33:49] me that all things work together for
[1:33:51] good
[1:33:52] amen even even the bad things

[1:34:07] patience
[1:34:09] and patience and virtue and knowledge
[1:34:11] and temperance and godliness
[1:34:14] oh my so uh
[1:34:16] sometimes you know we become victims
[1:34:19] don't take on a victim mentality we're
[1:34:22] not victims we're conquerors
[1:34:24] we're overcomers we're victors not
[1:34:27] victims
[1:34:28] don't be a victim of circumstance well
[1:34:30] i'm a victim of circumstance well like
[1:34:32] the man said you know well how are you
[1:34:34] doing today well not too bad under the
[1:34:36] circumstances he said what are you doing
[1:34:38] under there

[1:34:44] amen just stretch
[1:34:47] stretch your faith
[1:34:49] amen practice these things
[1:34:51] practice overcoming amen those athletes
[1:34:54] that are over in the olympics right now
[1:34:56] they focus
[1:34:58] on their abilities and their their their
[1:35:00] sport that's all they focus on
[1:35:03] and they're at the top of their class
[1:35:05] amen and we are the top
[1:35:07] and we've got to focus now
[1:35:09] and and exercise our faith
[1:35:12] stretch our faith amen do something out
[1:35:16] of the box out of your comfort zone
[1:35:19] like esther
[1:35:20] and then she had to do something out of
[1:35:22] her comfort zone she had to get out of
[1:35:24] her comfort zone
[1:35:26] to to see who she really was amen so
[1:35:30] we don't want a victim mentality so uh
[1:35:32] we can have we could mention lots of
[1:35:35] different things you know but we're not
[1:35:37] slaves we're not inferior we're not
[1:35:39] we're not slaves to fear or lack or want
[1:35:43] you know where we don't have to be
[1:35:46] amen we don't have to be we
[1:35:48] our
[1:35:49] our father is is rich in houses and
[1:35:51] lands
[1:35:52] the he holds the wealth of the world in
[1:35:54] his hands amen like i mentioned this
[1:35:57] morning my you know 1.6 million that
[1:36:00] that was a pretty good little offering
[1:36:02] you know and i thought
[1:36:04] you know what
[1:36:05] i wish i could have got that
[1:36:07] you know at the time but it wasn't for
[1:36:09] me it was for them
[1:36:11] and usually that's the way it is
[1:36:13] that's the way it has to be
[1:36:15] and that's why we need one another so we
[1:36:18] can overcome by the blood of the lamb
[1:36:19] amen and it just takes courage
[1:36:22] it just takes courage now saints take
[1:36:24] courage
[1:36:25] others have overcome
[1:36:27] you know whatever whatever uh thing it
[1:36:30] is that's that's hindering you whatever
[1:36:32] weakness it is don't let it become a
[1:36:34] complex
[1:36:35] amen whether it's for yourself or
[1:36:37] someone else don't let someone else's
[1:36:39] complex get get in between you and god
[1:36:42] because that tries to get on you and and
[1:36:44] i refuse it
[1:36:46] i'll just refuse it
[1:36:48] i just take the opposite just like the
[1:36:50] prophet said and i've had to do that
[1:36:52] saints from experience i've had to do
[1:36:53] that all of my life
[1:36:56] take the opposite to how i feel
[1:36:58] to how to the way i look at myself what
[1:37:01] i know about myself
[1:37:03] and brother greene said that many times
[1:37:05] i'd rather believe what he said about me
[1:37:07] than what i know about myself
[1:37:10] amen
[1:37:12] amen so
[1:37:13] we've got to
[1:37:15] we can overcome and we just need to take
[1:37:17] courage because there's people here that
[1:37:19] have been delivered of things
[1:37:21] that that maybe you're struggling with
[1:37:23] and over and have overcome
[1:37:25] you know and i the the brother that
[1:37:27] witnessed to me uh he had a problem with
[1:37:29] cigarettes
[1:37:31] and he witnessed to me and and uh
[1:37:33] and i came to the lord and
[1:37:35] and and the lord just you know
[1:37:38] wondrously
[1:37:39] birthed me into this message
[1:37:41] into his spirit and and he was just so
[1:37:44] surprised that god used him when he was
[1:37:46] kind of in a backslidden state
[1:37:49] but we're looking at the outside god
[1:37:52] mark is looking at the inside the
[1:37:54] cigarettes didn't mean a thing
[1:37:56] and i remember him at the back he'd run
[1:37:59] from the back to the front to the altar
[1:38:01] just fall down and and just repent and
[1:38:04] god take this thing away from me
[1:38:07] see
[1:38:08] so sometimes people are struggling with
[1:38:10] something that you know someone else has
[1:38:12] overcome
[1:38:14] god's delivered others he can deliver me
[1:38:17] amen but if you fixate on it
[1:38:20] you know i think there was a testimony
[1:38:21] brother branham said there was a man a
[1:38:23] brother in the hospital that had a
[1:38:24] problem with smoking he said i'll go in
[1:38:26] and give him a carton of cigarettes
[1:38:28] you watch and see
[1:38:30] and baptize him
[1:38:32] amen because he saw something in him
[1:38:35] amen
[1:38:36] so sometimes you see something it's not
[1:38:37] what you see a brother or sister
[1:38:39] sometimes struggling with something in
[1:38:41] the flesh or you know a sin or something
[1:38:43] don't don't don't magnify that just pray
[1:38:45] for them
[1:38:46] just pray for them and say you know
[1:38:48] greet them brother sister i'm praying
[1:38:50] for you
[1:38:51] you're on my heart make an effort to
[1:38:53] reach out
[1:38:54] and make that phone call
[1:38:56] you be the one
[1:38:58] don't wait you be the one
[1:39:00] so many people wait
[1:39:02] and they miss the blessing
[1:39:05] you know
[1:39:06] and that happens so often and i think
[1:39:08] we're we're we're
[1:39:10] you know we're living under our
[1:39:11] privileges that way
[1:39:14] and to see the spirit of god move in our
[1:39:16] midst amen and hear those testimonies
[1:39:19] just wonderful today i i really enjoyed
[1:39:22] the testimony about hadessa and i just
[1:39:25] think praise god
[1:39:26] good on you
[1:39:28] good on you sister amen you're an
[1:39:30] overcomer
[1:39:32] and you had the saints behind you
[1:39:33] praying say pray for one another that
[1:39:35] you'll overcome
[1:39:37] and confess those
[1:39:38] faults amen so whatever it is
[1:39:42] if it's smoking or lust or nervousness
[1:39:45] another thing that can become a complex
[1:39:48] nervousness i'm a very nervous person
[1:39:52] and
[1:39:53] i just made that way i'm very nervous
[1:39:55] and i'm very you know uh i wouldn't say
[1:39:58] i'm not i'm not the same as some other
[1:40:01] stoic solid
[1:40:03] uh
[1:40:04] calm
[1:40:04] brothers that i'd like to be like but
[1:40:07] i'm not that way
[1:40:09] i'm just the nervous type and god uses
[1:40:11] that somehow he uses that
[1:40:13] he can get glory from that so
[1:40:15] we don't want to get a complex about
[1:40:17] that comparing ourselves among ourselves
[1:40:21] ministers can do that and get a complex
[1:40:23] about it
[1:40:24] we can have a big complex about it
[1:40:27] and i just refuse it
[1:40:30] i just refuse it you know the disciples
[1:40:32] you know one time they had had that
[1:40:34] going among them who's the greatest
[1:40:36] who's the greatest preacher in the
[1:40:38] message complex
[1:40:40] i don't want that complex if god uses me
[1:40:42] in a little corner and he can he can get
[1:40:44] some glory out of my life
[1:40:46] praise god that's what i want
[1:40:48] i don't want to be the best preacher
[1:40:50] amen i i i know that's that's a complex
[1:40:53] and that that affects all of us
[1:40:56] you know and we we've got to be big
[1:40:57] enough to admit it
[1:40:59] you know we can talk about our good
[1:41:02] points and our strong points but
[1:41:03] sometimes there's weaknesses
[1:41:05] that we have and we're just better off
[1:41:07] being honest
[1:41:09] and and console you know confiding in
[1:41:11] someone confiding in your past fighting
[1:41:13] in the ministry confiding in brothers
[1:41:16] and
[1:41:16] sisters and that's what the blood is for
[1:41:19] amen if we just take courage now
[1:41:21] it only takes one person to take courage
[1:41:25] and then someone else can overcome
[1:41:27] amen i was in a
[1:41:29] excuse me
[1:41:32] i was in a on a train in washington
[1:41:35] coming back from the congo
[1:41:37] and we
[1:41:38] we got into a snowstorm there and it
[1:41:40] paralyzed the city and so flights were
[1:41:42] canceled and we had to get back to the
[1:41:44] hotel and then we couldn't everything
[1:41:45] was stranded and buses all over the
[1:41:47] streets and we were trying to take this
[1:41:49] train and uh we're on this train and
[1:41:52] there was this this uh
[1:41:54] big man that come and drunk on the train
[1:41:57] and uh he was a very big man and uh he
[1:42:00] he was threatening people on on in our
[1:42:03] car and he threatened this young girl
[1:42:05] and
[1:42:06] accused her of staring at him and what
[1:42:07] are you staring at and his voice was
[1:42:09] really loud and he became very
[1:42:11] intimidating and and
[1:42:13] you know i was sitting there and
[1:42:15] just fear gripped the whole
[1:42:17] the whole car the train and everybody
[1:42:19] was just frozen
[1:42:21] because he he was in control that spirit
[1:42:24] that demon spirit was in control
[1:42:26] and uh we didn't know what he was going
[1:42:28] to do next you know if he had a knife or
[1:42:30] what what he was going to do so there
[1:42:32] was this little man at the back little
[1:42:34] little guy at the back
[1:42:36] he got up real slowly you know you just
[1:42:37] get up and just walk slowly up behind
[1:42:39] him where he was sitting and he just
[1:42:42] grabbed him by the neck
[1:42:44] and he put him in a hole he must have
[1:42:45] been a soldier
[1:42:47] because the hold he had him in was he
[1:42:48] was he was he was paralyzed he couldn't
[1:42:51] do nothing and so he pulled him up out
[1:42:52] of the seat and he brought him out to
[1:42:54] the to the aisle where he brought him
[1:42:56] right where i was sitting
[1:42:58] right beside me and i'm looking up at
[1:43:00] him and he's holding this big guy and
[1:43:02] you know i thought this guy has got
[1:43:04] courage
[1:43:05] i got to help this guy so i stood up
[1:43:09] and i grabbed him by the other arm the
[1:43:10] big guy so that he couldn't struggle
[1:43:13] he was struggling he said let me go let
[1:43:15] me go i won't do nothing he said i'm not
[1:43:17] letting you go for nothing
[1:43:20] and i thought this guy's got courage i'm
[1:43:22] going to back him up so when i got up
[1:43:24] and i grabbed him then someone else got
[1:43:26] up and then someone else got up and then
[1:43:28] we were all over them
[1:43:30] we all had them so we couldn't do
[1:43:32] nothing
[1:43:33] so i learned something there
[1:43:36] because it only takes one person
[1:43:39] to take courage
[1:43:41] and and start it
[1:43:43] do something
[1:43:44] and you know when that door when we came
[1:43:46] to that next stop and the doors open in
[1:43:48] the subway or whatever and the doors
[1:43:50] open automatically he's saying you know
[1:43:52] let me go let me go he said no this is
[1:43:54] your stop
[1:43:57] he just let him go outside and he rolled
[1:43:59] on the ground you know
[1:44:01] i'm not i'm not advocating violence
[1:44:05] but you know you know what sometimes
[1:44:08] if you
[1:44:09] the prophets are like peter cartwright i
[1:44:11] must fight if i must win increase my
[1:44:14] courage lord then pray for him after
[1:44:16] hey man but you know i just thought just
[1:44:18] one person one little guy
[1:44:22] that didn't look very intimidating at
[1:44:24] all
[1:44:25] but he knew what he was doing
[1:44:27] he knew what he's doing he had courage
[1:44:29] so take courage
[1:44:31] take courage and do what god puts on
[1:44:33] your heart to do
[1:44:34] you young people at school take courage
[1:44:36] be an example be a testimony
[1:44:38] amen just if it's even praying over your
[1:44:41] food
[1:44:42] i remember in a camp in an oil field
[1:44:44] camp i prayed over my food and that's
[1:44:46] what attracted people and i think there
[1:44:48] was a whole family came in from that
[1:44:52] just for me praying over my food
[1:44:54] they said what do you believe
[1:44:56] what you know and so they see something
[1:45:00] they see the way you dress the way you
[1:45:02] act that's a testimony
[1:45:04] that that's the works of god
[1:45:07] and and you know and if if there is
[1:45:08] something there they're gonna they're
[1:45:10] gonna come nothing's gonna stop them
[1:45:13] amen so
[1:45:14] uh let's uh
[1:45:17] do we have that powerpoint let's just go
[1:45:19] to this quote
[1:45:21] oh that's not it
[1:45:23] perfect strength and perfect weakness
[1:45:25] here's something that'll console us
[1:45:27] here's something that encourages us out
[1:45:28] of weakness and humility god chooses
[1:45:31] people to build his kingdom out of
[1:45:33] if we ever get to heaven if we ever
[1:45:35] stand in the presence of god with his
[1:45:36] church we'll stand with a bunch of
[1:45:39] people that's been weak rejected cast
[1:45:41] out by the world
[1:45:43] and knoweth nothings
[1:45:45] amen
[1:45:47] i'm one of them i'm one of them
[1:45:50] i'm so glad that i can say i'ma know it
[1:45:52] nothing
[1:45:55] isn't that strange god's liking us to
[1:45:57] sheep the sheep is the most helpless
[1:45:59] thing there is
[1:46:01] we've got to become that way
[1:46:04] there's nothing so insufficient in
[1:46:06] defense that
[1:46:08] of defense than the sheep a rabbit can
[1:46:10] run a squirrel can get in a tree a dog
[1:46:12] can bite a lion can tear a horse can
[1:46:14] kick a bird can fly but sheep are stand
[1:46:17] helpless that's the way god wants us
[1:46:20] realize that we are totally insufficient
[1:46:25] perfect strength perfect weakness
[1:46:27] then god takes that person begins to
[1:46:29] mold himself into that person makes his
[1:46:31] hands do what god would have his hands
[1:46:34] do
[1:46:35] wonderful
[1:46:37] makes his lips speak with god god's lips
[1:46:40] would speak because they're not his
[1:46:43] their gods he begins to build a
[1:46:45] character
[1:46:46] begins to take this weakness and make
[1:46:48] his own self he brings us here in the
[1:46:51] earth but then we're so educated so
[1:46:53] smart
[1:46:54] you know the quote
[1:46:57] and he talks about cain's lineage but he
[1:46:59] said but god sides with the
[1:47:01] was weak and humble
[1:47:03] that's how god used them that's god's
[1:47:06] opportunity
[1:47:08] god wants an opportunity in our lives
[1:47:11] so we just got to continue
[1:47:14] it it's in humility isn't it
[1:47:17] it's really in humility and we we've got
[1:47:20] to humble ourselves sometimes we've got
[1:47:22] to humble ourselves from our from our
[1:47:24] message pride
[1:47:26] a lot of that going around message pride
[1:47:29] that we know more that were that we we
[1:47:31] understand more we have more revelation
[1:47:33] you know and there's no one going to
[1:47:35] heaven but us
[1:47:37] sort of attitude there's millions going
[1:47:39] to heaven
[1:47:40] there's millions outside the city
[1:47:43] there's millions that will come into the
[1:47:44] city
[1:47:46] some of my family may come into the city
[1:47:48] and i'll greet them
[1:47:50] they name may never be bride they may
[1:47:52] never see this message
[1:47:54] but they'll be there
[1:47:56] i believe they'll be there
[1:47:58] hallelujah god show me they'll be there
[1:48:01] amen so and don't look at denomination
[1:48:04] don't look at they're catholic they're
[1:48:06] this they're that don't look at that
[1:48:09] amen
[1:48:10] if you give a cup of cold water
[1:48:13] you will not lose your reward
[1:48:15] amen and there's many that'll be there
[1:48:17] that you wouldn't think would be there
[1:48:21] amen so we we want to get over that so
[1:48:24] perfect strength and perfect weakness
[1:48:29] so sometimes it's just things
[1:48:31] that are in the grab bag of life that we
[1:48:34] we get and
[1:48:35] uh
[1:48:36] you know it's
[1:48:37] like elijah
[1:48:39] he was a man of like passions
[1:48:42] and like moses and like all the prophets
[1:48:44] abraham you know they all had
[1:48:47] had weaknesses that they had to overcome
[1:48:51] amen to him that overcometh
[1:48:54] abraham
[1:48:55] had a weakness he had a me complex he
[1:48:57] wanted to save his own height
[1:49:00] so he was going to give away his wife
[1:49:03] and watch another man take her
[1:49:06] my
[1:49:07] abraham the father of the faith
[1:49:10] amen you say well they didn't have the
[1:49:11] holy ghost but they were they were god's
[1:49:13] people they were elected
[1:49:15] it was god's servant he was god's
[1:49:17] prophet
[1:49:18] amen but he had human weaknesses
[1:49:21] amen and so did moses like i said
[1:49:23] earlier
[1:49:24] and you know that's where we need to see
[1:49:27] the deity and humanity the conflict will
[1:49:30] always be there but we have a promise to
[1:49:33] the overcomer that if we we overcome as
[1:49:36] he overcame
[1:49:38] as i have overcome
[1:49:41] jesus had a ma as a man had to overcome
[1:49:44] he had to overcome popularity he had to
[1:49:46] overcome women he had to overcome money
[1:49:50] he could have had it all
[1:49:53] he could have been set up as a king amen
[1:49:56] but he had to overcome that
[1:49:58] so elijah was in first kings 19 we read
[1:50:02] that you know after his his his uh he
[1:50:05] got into a me complex elijah did
[1:50:08] and and so did our profit
[1:50:11] so did brother branham he had a complex
[1:50:13] and i i don't know if i got that on a on
[1:50:16] a quote
[1:50:18] um
[1:50:21] here recently i was going to just to
[1:50:23] quit preaching that people wouldn't hear
[1:50:25] me they just kept on doing the same
[1:50:27] thing and i got discouraged i built a
[1:50:29] complex another place he said i got
[1:50:31] depressed
[1:50:33] and then right at the end
[1:50:36] he said of it to know that i'd left a
[1:50:38] lot of sick people see
[1:50:40] because of his complex
[1:50:42] a ministry not both prophetic but the
[1:50:44] teaching of the word and praying for the
[1:50:46] sick
[1:50:47] you let a man drop dead right there on
[1:50:49] the floor then brought him back to life
[1:50:51] for confirmation that that was true you
[1:50:53] always confirm your word so
[1:50:56] he's saying here and you all know
[1:50:58] that that god dealt with him severely on
[1:51:00] that
[1:51:01] amen but he he says himself that he
[1:51:04] built himself
[1:51:07] we do it to ourselves
[1:51:09] it's not someone else it's not your
[1:51:11] brother it's not your sister it's not
[1:51:12] the pastor
[1:51:14] some people have complex with a pastor
[1:51:17] or ministry it's not them it's yourself
[1:51:21] look at yourself
[1:51:23] look at your attitude
[1:51:25] is it christ-like
[1:51:27] it you know that love it doesn't bend on
[1:51:29] their attitude towards you it's your
[1:51:31] attitude towards them
[1:51:33] that's what the love of god is based on
[1:51:35] so
[1:51:37] brother branham he had to go through
[1:51:38] that
[1:51:39] and god corrected him
[1:51:41] amen he said i built myself a complex
[1:51:45] and it's he said it's so easy to do
[1:51:49] we don't realize it's so easy to do amen
[1:51:52] i think we're getting it
[1:51:53] amen how many has complex how many has
[1:51:55] weaknesses
[1:51:57] amen we're all human we have some
[1:51:59] weakness
[1:52:00] and god can fortify us by his word
[1:52:02] putting on the whole armor of god and
[1:52:05] and and and pressing and pressing for it
[1:52:08] like i said we have to the the the
[1:52:11] righteous they take it by violence
[1:52:13] the kingdom of god is taken by violence
[1:52:16] the kingdom of god is within us and it's
[1:52:18] taken by violence
[1:52:19] we have to war and struggle
[1:52:22] and it's it's it's it's a dark place
[1:52:24] sometimes and i'm speaking from
[1:52:26] experience because i i myself had a
[1:52:28] complex
[1:52:30] it was a me complex same one elijah had
[1:52:34] it was a me complex early in my life
[1:52:36] early in my ministry i thought it was
[1:52:38] all about me
[1:52:39] i thought i had something to do with it
[1:52:42] i thought i i had something to do with
[1:52:43] the gift
[1:52:45] and i was a little bit proud and i was a
[1:52:47] little bit oh great
[1:52:48] i'm a great kind of guy you know
[1:52:50] i'm a real great guy you got to like me
[1:52:53] you know i i find no fault in myself
[1:52:58] quite a complex
[1:52:59] you know it's either inferior complex or
[1:53:02] or you're on the other side of it you
[1:53:04] think too much of yourself
[1:53:06] and uh i know it sounds funny now but it
[1:53:09] you know i had to learn a great lesson
[1:53:12] and you know i left my family behind i
[1:53:14] left my children behind i left my wife
[1:53:16] behind
[1:53:17] and i almost lost my marriage
[1:53:21] you know those are the hard things to
[1:53:22] say
[1:53:23] those are not the easy things but
[1:53:25] they're hard things but i want to be
[1:53:26] honest
[1:53:28] i want to be honest with god and i want
[1:53:29] to be on i want to meet him with a pure
[1:53:32] heart
[1:53:33] and i want to overcome those things and
[1:53:35] i had to you know pride what is it the
[1:53:38] pride cometh before the fall
[1:53:40] and uh and you know and when i realized
[1:53:42] i'd left all that and almost lost my
[1:53:44] marriage i i just said well i'm i'm just
[1:53:47] going to quit preaching
[1:53:49] and i i wanted to stop i i think it was
[1:53:51] close to four years
[1:53:53] and and
[1:53:54] you know it was my pastor that
[1:53:56] that we we you know god used him and
[1:53:59] and uh restored me
[1:54:02] see i say that that's hard to say
[1:54:04] but you know it's true
[1:54:06] it's true we're living uh it's not it's
[1:54:09] not this is not an imagination or or
[1:54:12] something we put on
[1:54:13] we can't put things on we can't try to
[1:54:16] be something we're not
[1:54:18] and you know when you you try to be the
[1:54:19] big guy you try to be you know a super
[1:54:22] super preacher or you know whatever god
[1:54:25] uses you you give me a little gift and
[1:54:27] you know and i i'm thinking i'm a little
[1:54:29] better than someone else
[1:54:32] i soon found out
[1:54:33] you'll fall right on your face god god
[1:54:37] will share his glory with no man
[1:54:39] amen and he'll and and that's his love
[1:54:43] that's his love but god god is a
[1:54:45] restorer
[1:54:46] if you fail if you backslide if you did
[1:54:49] something god is a restorer he can
[1:54:51] restore you
[1:54:53] amen and and he did that for me and i
[1:54:55] could go into that testimony a little
[1:54:57] deeper but i just feel that you know
[1:55:00] you know as ministers
[1:55:02] we need to be honest
[1:55:04] and we're human
[1:55:06] we need to overcome ourselves too
[1:55:09] and you know and what would we be
[1:55:11] without the people
[1:55:13] what would you be what ministry would
[1:55:15] you have
[1:55:17] amen it's the bride's ministry
[1:55:20] it's the bride's ministry that's what it
[1:55:22] is when you realize oh it's all about
[1:55:23] him
[1:55:25] it's all about you lord it's all about
[1:55:27] you
[1:55:28] amen then then all those complexes and
[1:55:31] things starts to fade away and he gets
[1:55:33] greater and then all things are possible
[1:55:35] god has used me more brother aaron since
[1:55:38] that time
[1:55:39] you know when i consider myself
[1:55:41] backslidden
[1:55:42] than he has ever in my life now
[1:55:45] because i learned something
[1:55:47] i learned how great he is
[1:55:50] i learned that it's all about him
[1:55:52] and anything i've done any any good i've
[1:55:55] ever done was him there's none good but
[1:55:57] god
[1:55:58] there's no one good amen none of us are
[1:56:00] any good but god in you is great
[1:56:03] and you're an overcomer
[1:56:05] and i've had to overcome things in my
[1:56:07] life complexes amen
[1:56:10] of the way i was brought up and things
[1:56:11] and you know we've all been like i said
[1:56:14] we've all been in some way scarred or
[1:56:16] hurt
[1:56:17] but you can't let that become a complex
[1:56:19] it takes you out of the body
[1:56:22] it takes you away it was going to take
[1:56:23] the profit away
[1:56:25] and and he said i let the sick lay
[1:56:28] and and there and the and he would hear
[1:56:30] those calls coming
[1:56:32] you know he was still called to do that
[1:56:34] and god dealt severely with him he said
[1:56:37] you'll become a bum
[1:56:39] and your wife will leave you
[1:56:41] you think that would have happened
[1:56:43] yes it would have happened
[1:56:45] he wasn't just mincing words he said you
[1:56:48] do what you're you want to do and this
[1:56:50] is what's going to happen
[1:56:52] amen and and that that was the same for
[1:56:55] me i realized god took me to a point
[1:56:56] where i said oh
[1:56:58] this is now a time of decision
[1:57:01] i need to decide
[1:57:03] what i what i want what i really want
[1:57:06] from life
[1:57:07] that it's not all about me and the
[1:57:09] attention i could get or or you know
[1:57:11] that i'm such a great guy or or you know
[1:57:14] many different things
[1:57:16] that come into the emotions and
[1:57:18] and things that you know it's hard to
[1:57:20] explain you know men let me tell you
[1:57:23] something men sometimes i was at that
[1:57:25] time i was in my 40s early 40s and i was
[1:57:28] going through a midlife crisis
[1:57:31] and men go through that too
[1:57:33] men there's times when men go through
[1:57:35] that and and they want something else
[1:57:38] they want something special they want
[1:57:40] you know
[1:57:41] something outside of themselves
[1:57:43] and they you know and it it's just hard
[1:57:45] to explain because it's like your wires
[1:57:48] get crossed everything gets crossed in
[1:57:50] your mind
[1:57:51] and and you you kind of have a spiritual
[1:57:53] amnesia
[1:57:55] and you know
[1:57:57] i know you're looking at me funny but
[1:57:59] i'm just human
[1:58:01] and and you know that was a very painful
[1:58:03] time
[1:58:04] that was a very painful time for for our
[1:58:07] marriage and for our family but god is a
[1:58:10] restorer we believe don't we that you
[1:58:12] know that the prophet elijah restored
[1:58:16] you know god can restore people no
[1:58:20] backslider god can restore people just
[1:58:22] have some confidence have some mercy
[1:58:25] have some grace have some patience
[1:58:27] amen put yourself in their shoes
[1:58:30] amen and if it was you
[1:58:32] so
[1:58:33] um i don't know i i didn't plan on
[1:58:35] bringing that out but that's that's
[1:58:37] probably why i'm preaching this message
[1:58:39] because i've had some experience with it
[1:58:42] and i know god god can you can overcome
[1:58:47] we can overcome anything saints
[1:58:49] we can overcome any complex any weakness
[1:58:51] satan has put on us anything we've had
[1:58:54] from birth or before our birth
[1:58:57] in our parents or our grandparents
[1:58:59] things that were passed down to us so
[1:59:02] the elijah's biggest complex
[1:59:04] was his
[1:59:05] me complex
[1:59:07] read when you get home read chapter 19
[1:59:10] of first kings and how that elijah
[1:59:14] goes and runs from jezebel and finds
[1:59:16] himself in a cave
[1:59:17] and uh god passes by in a wind and a
[1:59:20] an and an earthquake and a and a
[1:59:23] lightning and different things and yet
[1:59:26] god was not in it
[1:59:28] it was only the effects of his presence
[1:59:31] passing by
[1:59:32] all those supernatural things that are
[1:59:35] out there are only the effects
[1:59:37] of what god's done in this generation
[1:59:40] everything you see on television and tv
[1:59:43] evangelists and different things that's
[1:59:45] the effects
[1:59:46] of what god has done in this generation
[1:59:49] and they weren't the real thing you know
[1:59:52] i'm not looking for those things
[1:59:54] amen and i'm not looking for you know
[1:59:57] okay i'm not looking for the prophet's
[1:59:58] cave
[2:00:02] that doesn't matter to me
[2:00:03] that was for the prophet
[2:00:06] amen that's a special thing god had for
[2:00:08] the prophet amen i'm not looking i've
[2:00:10] been i've had the privilege to to to go
[2:00:12] to jeffersonville and sit in the
[2:00:13] prophet's chair and and and go to his
[2:00:15] grave and and be at sunset and up at
[2:00:19] sabino and i'd like to go again here
[2:00:21] right away but you know
[2:00:24] it's where is the god of elijah
[2:00:27] right where is the god of elijah he's
[2:00:28] here
[2:00:30] he's he's he's been there all the time
[2:00:33] waiting patiently in line
[2:00:36] amen he's waiting patiently sometimes
[2:00:38] and we're looking for him here and there
[2:00:40] you know but god was not in it
[2:00:42] but he takes you know elijah out of that
[2:00:44] depression he goes into a depression
[2:00:46] under a juniper tree
[2:00:48] and and he he takes them up to the cave
[2:00:50] and he says
[2:00:52] the lord says what doest thou hear
[2:00:54] elijah
[2:00:56] sirs what is the time
[2:00:58] he's asking him his prophet a question
[2:01:01] sirs what is the time what are you here
[2:01:03] for what are you doing here why are we
[2:01:05] still here
[2:01:07] in 2022.
[2:01:10] you know what what what
[2:01:12] it was a still small voice that asked
[2:01:14] that question elijah comes out oh i've
[2:01:16] been very zealous for the lord our god
[2:01:19] they've thrown down his altars they
[2:01:20] killed the prophets they've done this
[2:01:22] they've done that and i'm the only one
[2:01:27] preaching the message
[2:01:28] i'm the only one that has the right
[2:01:30] doctrine
[2:01:32] see i can say that with a smile
[2:01:35] that's a complex
[2:01:36] that's a bad one we're the only church
[2:01:40] we're the only ones in the middle of the
[2:01:41] road
[2:01:42] don't get that complex god's got his
[2:01:44] children all over the place
[2:01:46] and you know when he asked he asked
[2:01:48] elijah he said what what is it you know
[2:01:50] what are you doing here and that was his
[2:01:52] answer
[2:01:52] wrong
[2:01:54] wrong answer so he goes on
[2:01:57] then he comes to him again asks him the
[2:01:58] second time obviously the first time was
[2:02:01] the wrong answer but he gives the same
[2:02:03] answer again
[2:02:05] i've been very very zealous for the lord
[2:02:07] our god you know they've thrown down the
[2:02:09] altars they slain the prophet and i only
[2:02:11] remain a prophet
[2:02:13] i'm the only one that's in the middle of
[2:02:15] the world it's not it's not even us four
[2:02:17] anymore it's just me myself and i
[2:02:20] three of us
[2:02:24] so
[2:02:25] you know uh he had that complex that's
[2:02:27] why i said elijah had a complex
[2:02:30] and god just ignored him
[2:02:34] the second time and he says
[2:02:36] i'll give you the answer
[2:02:37] to this question
[2:02:39] because the the answer was in the
[2:02:41] question
[2:02:42] and sometimes that's the way it is the
[2:02:43] answer is right in the question
[2:02:45] you're here for a purpose we're here for
[2:02:47] a purpose
[2:02:49] and and we've got work to do
[2:02:51] you've got work to do
[2:02:53] you've got overcoming to do
[2:02:55] we've got overcoming to do
[2:02:57] and there's something we need to
[2:02:58] overcome
[2:02:59] in our lives
[2:03:00] that's what i want
[2:03:02] i want to overcome myself
[2:03:04] i want to overcome my spirit my thinking
[2:03:07] get it out of the way so god can speak
[2:03:10] and god can use me and god can god can
[2:03:13] win souls
[2:03:15] win a soul for christ amen
[2:03:18] the greatest thing we could ever do or
[2:03:19] support a believer so
[2:03:22] when he asked him the second time and he
[2:03:24] says the same thing again
[2:03:26] god says now elijah here's the answer
[2:03:29] go and anoint hazel
[2:03:31] amen
[2:03:32] to to be king i think it was and jehu to
[2:03:35] be king over israel hazel hazel and jehu
[2:03:39] and elijah he said go anoint elijah to
[2:03:42] be prophet in your stand
[2:03:44] and that was his answer that was god
[2:03:46] giving him the answer that elijah
[2:03:49] it's you're not the only one besides
[2:03:51] that i've reserved me 7 000
[2:03:54] that believe this message
[2:03:56] that are preaching this message
[2:03:58] around the world
[2:04:00] i've reserved me
[2:04:02] and you don't know anything about that
[2:04:04] because that's another group
[2:04:06] elijah was the type of christ elijah was
[2:04:10] the type of the bride
[2:04:11] right so god was saying elijah
[2:04:14] you don't understand there's an elijah
[2:04:17] to come
[2:04:19] elijah christ and the bride elijah
[2:04:22] christ and the bride christ and the
[2:04:23] bride
[2:04:24] elijah there's a bride coming
[2:04:27] there's a bride coming of christ
[2:04:29] and we're living in that time now
[2:04:31] and we need to see who we are
[2:04:34] we need to overcome these little things
[2:04:35] and and and elijah had to overcome his
[2:04:38] his me complex his message complex in
[2:04:41] order to see that
[2:04:44] he needed to see that he he needed god
[2:04:46] had to take him right down to face that
[2:04:48] it's not about you elijah
[2:04:51] it's about them
[2:04:53] it's about the bride there's a bride
[2:04:55] coming to this there's an ephesians to
[2:04:58] this
[2:04:59] amen and and elijah had to see that
[2:05:01] before he could get rapturing faith
[2:05:04] amen and that's that that was very uh
[2:05:07] uh revealing to me that that elijah
[2:05:11] could actually
[2:05:12] not understand that
[2:05:14] that there was something else after his
[2:05:17] ministry
[2:05:20] amen there was something to come
[2:05:23] amen and and that's what we're
[2:05:24] fulfilling now saints
[2:05:26] we're fulfilling a lot of things that
[2:05:28] the prophet saw in vision we are
[2:05:30] fulfilling those things now and those
[2:05:32] things are some of them have been
[2:05:34] fulfilled and people are still looking
[2:05:36] for them
[2:05:38] looking out there for something to come
[2:05:40] when it's already done
[2:05:43] it's already fulfilled and we're right
[2:05:46] at that door now
[2:05:47] so elijah had to come to that place
[2:05:50] where it wasn't about him
[2:05:52] same place i had to come to
[2:05:54] same place every one of us will have to
[2:05:56] come to
[2:05:57] that that christ can
[2:06:00] you know that he can be the the
[2:06:02] preeminent one
[2:06:04] and and the focus and the center of our
[2:06:06] lives
[2:06:07] amen um
[2:06:09] you know a lie once elijah saw that and
[2:06:12] he goes and anoints jehu and hazel and
[2:06:15] then finds elisha
[2:06:17] he found a bride
[2:06:19] right he finds elijah and then and then
[2:06:21] elijah follows him
[2:06:23] and it took 10 years the prophet said
[2:06:25] for elijah's coat to fit elijah
[2:06:29] it took a long span of time for that to
[2:06:32] happen but it happened
[2:06:34] and then they come down to to a place
[2:06:36] where elijah says unto elijah
[2:06:40] he had overcome his complex
[2:06:42] he understood now what it was what he
[2:06:45] was there for
[2:06:46] he was there in preparation
[2:06:49] for a bride
[2:06:50] to call a bride out
[2:06:52] that's what he was there for and then he
[2:06:54] left the scene
[2:06:55] amen and that's and that's where we're
[2:06:57] at today
[2:06:58] it it christ is in bride form
[2:07:01] he's here today in the fullness of his
[2:07:03] of his spirit in bright form and a many
[2:07:06] member bride christ is here in his
[2:07:08] fullness
[2:07:10] now amen not not to come someday
[2:07:13] when it happens
[2:07:15] but now he's here and and that's what i
[2:07:18] see around the world amen and i see it
[2:07:20] here that the spirit of god is is is
[2:07:23] moving in his people
[2:07:25] amen and they have a desire to be to be
[2:07:27] closer to god and to
[2:07:29] and to see god move in their lives and
[2:07:31] and and to see god move in our church
[2:07:33] amen
[2:07:34] so elijah started to
[2:07:38] to tell that to elijah when he had
[2:07:40] overcome and he said elijah what what
[2:07:42] can i do for you and elijah elijah asked
[2:07:46] a hard question
[2:07:48] give me a double portion
[2:07:50] he said you've asked a hard thing but if
[2:07:52] you see me when i'm taken
[2:07:55] if you understand the the the process of
[2:07:57] the rapture
[2:07:59] because there's gonna be a rapture
[2:08:01] amen and i'm gonna i'm gonna leave this
[2:08:03] world
[2:08:04] now if you see me if you endure
[2:08:07] if you stay with the message stay with
[2:08:09] the messenger the message and the
[2:08:11] messenger are one
[2:08:13] stay with that message endure to the end
[2:08:16] if you endure and see this
[2:08:18] you'll you'll have that portion
[2:08:20] you'll have your portion amen and so i i
[2:08:23] can just see them
[2:08:26] amen as they walked
[2:08:28] and and the sons of the prophets see
[2:08:30] after after that battle with elijah with
[2:08:34] himself was over
[2:08:36] amen where he had to realize it was not
[2:08:39] about him
[2:08:40] after that was over then then he could
[2:08:42] relax and now his retirement was in
[2:08:45] sight
[2:08:46] amen are you looking for your retirement
[2:08:48] i'm looking for mine
[2:08:50] amen and i you know and he had a he had
[2:08:52] a great plan
[2:08:54] great retirement plan and i can see him
[2:08:56] brother jeremy
[2:08:57] uh
[2:08:58] if you'll if you'll just come for a
[2:09:00] minute brother jeremy did you just come
[2:09:02] up for a minute i can see elijah
[2:09:06] with elisha
[2:09:09] and them walking towards the jordan
[2:09:13] and elijah said unto elijah
[2:09:16] as they strolled rather if i'll take
[2:09:18] your arm we'll just they just strolled
[2:09:21] they were just strolling he said now i
[2:09:22] want you to understand
[2:09:24] he said have you ever have you heard my
[2:09:26] message on
[2:09:28] things that are to be
[2:09:29] yes yeah have you heard my message on
[2:09:31] the rapture yes perfect faith yes why
[2:09:34] we're not a denomination yes amen
[2:09:37] deceived church by the world yes
[2:09:39] leadership
[2:09:40] elijah these are elijah these are the
[2:09:43] things you have to understand
[2:09:44] and you have to understand that i had a
[2:09:46] complex about myself but it wasn't about
[2:09:48] me
[2:09:49] it was about him amen amen and they
[2:09:52] stroll together
[2:09:53] and as they stroll together the
[2:09:55] scripture says they talked
[2:09:57] i wonder what they talked about why he
[2:09:59] talked about rapturing faith how to get
[2:10:02] rapturing faith and they just strolled
[2:10:03] together and the sons of the prophets
[2:10:05] stood afar off
[2:10:07] right they set a far off and they were
[2:10:08] just elijah and elijah were just one
[2:10:11] together and i'm sure he took his arm
[2:10:14] i'm just almost sure of it
[2:10:16] amen and
[2:10:17] they they become so alike
[2:10:19] elijah and elisha you couldn't tell the
[2:10:22] difference the sons of the prophet said
[2:10:23] now the spirit of elijah rests on elijah
[2:10:27] it's the same spirit
[2:10:29] that christ and the bride
[2:10:31] so that's where elijah had to come to
[2:10:35] in order to
[2:10:36] to have rapturing faith and elijah had
[2:10:38] to do his part he had to stay with the
[2:10:40] messenger all the way
[2:10:43] all the way across jordan
[2:10:45] amen even while the sons of the prophets
[2:10:48] stood afar off
[2:10:50] and criticized
[2:10:53] amen and didn't believe didn't really
[2:10:55] believe in a rapture
[2:10:57] you know people people in the mess they
[2:10:58] some of them say they're believing in a
[2:11:00] rapture i wonder
[2:11:02] i wonder by their actions are they are
[2:11:04] we really looking for the coming of the
[2:11:05] lord
[2:11:07] are we just playing church are we just
[2:11:08] getting comfortable
[2:11:10] oh my
[2:11:11] but elijah said unto elijah
[2:11:14] have you heard my messages on false
[2:11:17] anointed ones at the end time
[2:11:20] on have you heard my message on
[2:11:22] leadership
[2:11:24] amen have you heard my message on
[2:11:26] communion
[2:11:28] or what else will you bill me
[2:11:31] have you heard those messages
[2:11:33] have you have you have you heard what
[2:11:36] the spirit was saying
[2:11:38] or is saying to you
[2:11:40] about that that's more important than oh
[2:11:42] i listen to that one i listen to that
[2:11:43] when i listen to that one
[2:11:45] but now what are you hearing now
[2:11:47] what doest thou hear elisha
[2:11:50] not elijah what does thou hear elisha
[2:11:54] bride what are we doing here what time
[2:11:56] is it
[2:11:58] if we could just
[2:11:59] settle ourselves
[2:12:01] and just concentrate on god in our lives
[2:12:05] god in my life
[2:12:07] amen and focus on that
[2:12:09] and focus on on that love amen
[2:12:13] and having a loving christ-like spirit
[2:12:16] amen god will do the rest
[2:12:18] god will reveal the rest he'll reveal
[2:12:20] the big things and i i can just imagine
[2:12:23] as as elijah talked to elijah along the
[2:12:26] way that it just as he as he rehearsed
[2:12:29] those things that god did
[2:12:31] in his life and in his ministry he was
[2:12:34] rehearsing them that it all came
[2:12:36] together for him
[2:12:37] just in a moment
[2:12:39] in the twinkling of an eye
[2:12:41] it just that's the way it'll happen
[2:12:43] saints
[2:12:44] it won't be a wind or a thunder or an
[2:12:46] earthquake
[2:12:48] amen it'll just be a real simple thing
[2:12:52] the prophet said the rapture will be so
[2:12:55] quiet
[2:12:57] it's not a public show
[2:12:59] it will not be a public show and i don't
[2:13:02] believe it'll be on the internet
[2:13:05] i don't believe it'll be on cnn
[2:13:08] and they'll be watching the two prophets
[2:13:10] in jerusalem on cnn
[2:13:12] and rejoicing
[2:13:13] but we're not going to see it on those
[2:13:15] things get away from those things get
[2:13:17] away from the world amen shun it shun it
[2:13:20] as much as you can i know we have to
[2:13:22] live and do business but you know what
[2:13:24] we don't have to be is distracted
[2:13:27] let's not be distracted amen and in that
[2:13:31] moment
[2:13:32] it all came together it was a simple
[2:13:34] moment and i'm going to close with that
[2:13:36] and say

[2:20:51] amen when i didn't say it this morning
[2:20:53] but when i was in africa you know these
[2:20:56] signs follow them that believe there was
[2:20:58] a there was a lame woman she was
[2:21:00] crippled
[2:21:01] and and i just looked at her and she
[2:21:03] just had the face
[2:21:04] i laid my hands on her and she got up
[2:21:07] and started to dance and run
[2:21:09] run down the around the whole thing with
[2:21:13] by herself
[2:21:14] there was blind people there there was
[2:21:16] mentally mentally

[2:21:45] but it's not
