saw them and may they be answered in Jesus name amen let's remain standing for a minute I I'd like to read a scripture let's turn in the Book of Psalms chapter 71 Psalm 71 [Music] start with verse 14 Psalm 71 verse4 thought this was fitting says this but I will hope continually and will yet praise thee more and more my mouth shall show forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day for I know not the numbers thereof I will go in strength in the strength of the Lord I will make mention of thy righteousness even of thine only oh God thou Hast taught me from my youth and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works as you know we have um about once a month or so we have a testimony meeting I like I like for us all to share our testimony sometimes we'll share within the audience and other times we share with with some of the folks in church and brother Ron gave his testimony one time and and others have given theirs and tonight I've asked brother Ed dugall to give his personal testimony and share with us a recent trip that he took and he got to meet some of the Saints over in Europe and um I'm really looking forward to it brother Ed is somebody that I never knew him before I started coming to church but he's somebody that's just been a blessing to me and he's he's turned out to be just not just a colleague and a and a um somebody that we are work within the church but he's turned out to be just a very very close friend so I really appreciate brother Ed and and sister Kathy is his loyal helpmate just never take him shopping he said amen when I said that this morning I'm just kidding he has a lot more patience than I do um but uh I do I just appreciate brother Ed and sister Kathy so much they are truly pillars in this church and especially recently they have held up this church and everything that they've done with all of the construction and everything that's going on brother Ed has taken the lead on almost all of it and if it wasn't for brother Ed sometimes it's like Lord how could we ever do it lord always provides what we need there's a song that I sang uh I used to sing um well I didn't really sing it but but we used to sing it um when we would travel overseas and and we would sing it when we were talking about overseas missionaries and brother Ed uh mentioned it earlier and I think it's really fitting Daniel knows the song well um they come from the East and West Daniel they come from the east and west they come from the lands ofar to Feast with the King to dine as his guest how blessed these pilgrims are beholding his hallowed face a glow with light Divine and bless partake seers of his grace as gems in his crown to shine since Jesus has Set Me Free I'm happy as heart can be no longer I bear the burden of care his yoke is so sweet to me my soul was as black as night but Darkness has taken flight and now I shout the victory for Jesus has said me free I look on the great white Throne before it the ransom stand no longer are tears no sorrow is known nor death in that goodly land My Savior has gone before preparing the way for me soon will'll me to part no more through time or [Music] eternity since Jesus said has Set Me Free I'm happy as hard can be no longer I bear the burden of care his yoke is so sweet to me my soul was as black as night but Darkness has taken flight and now I sh out the victory for Jesus has Set Me Free one more time since Jesus has Set Me Free I'm happy as heart can be no longer I bear the burden of care his yoke is so sweet to me my soul was as black as as night but Darkness has taken flight and now I shout the victory for Jesus has Set Me Free amen let's just go to the Lord one more time we can never pray enough and I know right now [Music] I could really use your prayers so uh let's let let's approach the throne Heavenly Father once again it's a privilege to be in your house Lord once again we call upon your name and Lord as I would give this testimony would you take my words move me out of the way anoint my thoughts Lord Lord I don't want myself in the way father but as I I share the Wonders that you've done for me in my life Lord May the others see that you can do the same for them would you receive honor and Glory this evening in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen you can go ahead and be seated I really like that song uh a little later toward the end I'll share a couple uh photos that we had on our trip little PowerPoint so I'll do that a little later um yeah I wanted to find out just really what uh a testimony what testimony meant so I looked it up uh this afternoon and there's a couple applications for it in the natural it the dictionary says it's a formal written or spoken statement especially one given in a court of law the other one is evidence or proof provided by the existence or appearance of something and then in a religious uh application a public recounting of a religious conversion or experience so my desire was to to share what the Lord has done for me in my life and I don't want this to be about Ed dugall yet it is about Ed dugall experience with the Lord his walk with the Lord so uh if you'll bear with me a little bit I I you know I get a little nervous here so I grew up in California and my my family was a very were very strong lutherans and we went to a couple different Lutheran Churches as we um moved around a little bit in California and then we ended up in San Jose uh and I'm not sure quite when maybe 63 6263 is when we moved to copertino San Jose area sometime shortly thereafter we uh I don't know how we ended up uh moving or switching churches but we ended up going to a Lutheran Church that brother did linhard was pastor of and his daughter Carol's here and she probably remembers me as a little runt running around but I became brother linhard's alter boy in the Lutheran Church and and I believe brother bradam said the Lutheran Church is was the right behind the Catholic Church uh so it very um very much into the doctrine of uh the Catholics and Lutheran and so on and are very similar but for somehow and I was talking to brother ly because uh I didn't remember everything but back in 66 brother Lawrence Mayfield had come and had apparently shared shared a message of brother brandham with brother linhard brother Lonnie Jenkins and um and at the time this little group of brothers and sisters in California they were looking for more than what the denomination was offering and it was something that they they latched on to and they they could see that yes this is what we we want to know more about this so it ended up they brought it to a group of people and my family was part of the little group of uh Believers there and it was at the first time early 66 uh that we heard the the prophet of of the Lord Brother brandham bring uh a message and I don't remember the the sermon exactly but there was there was a a handful of sermons you know one after another uh that were brought and we were listen listening to and the Lord started to move among the brothers and sisters there and after that we we were able to uh attend a church that I believe is uh correct me if I'm wrong it was brother Muse's Church wasn't it okay brother Muse was selling the church and we had an opportunity to go into this church and use it um and the Lord really moved and there was a a lot of people that wanted more of the Lord and uh was seeking the Lord and so I remember then it's um probably one one evening after service is that we started uh praying for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I remember praying it was the first time i' had ever encountered tongues you know speaking and tugs and um and I believe you know I was baptized and uh filled with the Holy Ghost then my family decided to move here in later of 66 and so we we packed up and the whole family and off we came to Tucson and my my perception of Tucson was still Cowboys and Indians dirt roads boardwalks and you know I I was really shocked when I got here and actually found automobiles driving down the street uh but that was in ' 66 and we arrived less than 10 months uh after brother green had started the church on South Stone so my family the dugall family has been here almost from the very beginning and uh saw a lot of things I saw a lot a lot of things um does it make me special no not absolutely not I'm I'm not special because I was able to witness a lot of that I feel like I'm more responsible uh for what I was able to witness um growing up I remember seeing a spoken word uh start and spoken word was down here on South six uh north6 Avenue I think I sent uh brother Dan picture where it started uh I was part of a group of people or young people that uh we heard that you should love your brothers and sisters so much you should be able to stand around and pass the chewing gum around and you know that's what we did you know outside we a group of young people uh and I was never the first one to get all the flavor I was somewhere in the middle but yeah know we but I wasn't the last one so uh that fortunately and maybe that's why I still like bubble gum my wife says don't don't swallow it so uh I like the flavor so uh but my family moved to uh just outside just to the east of the airbase back in uh 60 built a house and um it was probably late 66 um early 67 and there um the kids on the street and this is uh we started playing um football and you know like all young kids we you know we could be pretty uh brutal in football and uh and it was in front of the house I I fell and I was injured got up went in cleaned off the injury and out back out I was out back out on the street playing football but that was the beginning of a life-changing event in my life little did I know that I had dirt further into the knee which created an infection um and I just didn't understand why it was um not feeling good and it came out to where the not only the the bus driver that used to haul me off to school but the school nurse came by when I wasn't in school took one look at me and told my folks um you need to get him to a doctor right away so Mom and Dad not you know Dad made a big whopping 75 cents an hour back in those days um we weren't we weren't will to do by no means they took me over to St Elizabeth of hungry that used to be over here on Speedway they drew they drew some blood they looked at me and they thought he looks bad drew the blood it was all infection so immediately I went over to TMC I was uh operated on that that night hoping to get the infection under control which ended up being staff and um was in ICU for our the ICU isolation for about 3 weeks and got shipped up to Phoenix to the Children's Hospital and for three months my folks didn't know if I was going to live or die I don't say these things to say oh poor brother red but it's just to to create a base because of that I lost uh I lost some height in my right leg and when I came got out I was I ended up in a body cast for a year and a half um and it made it really really hard to go to school so you know I homeschooled you know correspondence and things like that there was a reason for that I don't know what the reason would have been had I not been sick I may not even be here today uh maybe the Lord was just putting the brakes on me he had a a bigger plan in my life which as I look back now I can see but then I didn't see the plan all I knew is that I'd never be the same after that and as I progressed through through life uh I realized something even worse than the injury was the rejection that I had received growing up back then back in the 60s early 70s people with handicaps were not treat it or accept it the way they are today they were sort of pushed away that no one wanted to do anything with someone that's a handicap or a which left uh really deep scars in my life and so I went through life like that always being rejected uh because technically I wasn't normal and so that created uh in my life that created a stigma and so the only time my friends wanted anything to hang around is when I could provide you know uh the illicit uh things that we us young people got into uh back in the 70s and so I I got mixed up with the wrong crowd and and I and I realized um looking back how much pain I caused my family so I hung with a crowd uh some of them came here uh to the church and some did not and I remember uh some of us young men at the time we sat right here on this front row uh because we had done some things and uh our fathers were right behind us on the second row there and brother grin was right here and um you didn't really you didn't want to see the the wrath of brother green but we saw that the wrath of brother green in a loving way and right after that two of the young men were taken out from under the blood of the church and i' had never seen that I was mortified it was like oh wow you know I mean I was almost afraid to go outside thinking I was going to get struck by lightning or something like that and um it didn't happen but uh I I I'm thankful that um the Lord was mindful of me um the two young men did come back and apologize and uh started coming back to church then in 19 uh and and this went on until about 76 um that I I rebelled and I just I would come to church but I wasn't I was here physically but I wasn't here uh mentally I just showed up to say hey I went to church so in 1976 I walked into the church office it was over on Country Club and Glenn I believe it was with another young man and brother green looked at both of us and said how would you like to go to Israel and so I I'll I'll pause there but I'd like to back up there was a group of brothers and sisters that used to live in the trailer court and they were called the Tucson tribe the trailer court tribe uh wonderful brothers and sisters uh and when we were at the old Tabernacle they used to come up and deliver a message which the message was right but the delivery was wrong especially to a young person if you don't go to church you're going to hell and I'm thinking well forget you you know I don't like being told that so I I resented that group of people so in 1975 brother green um December meetings we were going to go out to Sunset mountain and uh it was going to be an all day outing and I didn't have a ride and there was a brother and sister uh that I I really didn't want to see I didn't want anything to do with them I didn't want I didn't want to talk to them I didn't want to be around them I just just didn't like them so brother green said you don't have a ride I said no he said' get in the motor home and there were two seats in this motor home you know passenger seat you know held two and then right behind was another place for two so I get in and who do I see I think boy this is going to be a long two and a half hours on and I and I was squirming but they started talking to me and it wasn't in a spirit of conf condemnation but it was a spirit out of love and they start explaining to me about Israel and what was going on in Israel they had moved to Israel in 73 and they started telling me everything about it and it was like it sparked my interest a little bit and uh we had two and a half three hours of a a wonderful talk and uh I didn't feel rejected I didn't feel condemned I I just uh that was the way the Lord was getting my attention so in 1976 when I walked into the office and brother green said how would you like to go to Israel I was adventurous you know I wasn't uh I wasn't 21 yet I said sure the other young man uh Steve said nope he didn't want to go brother green looked at brother Lonnie Jenkins who was the associate pastor at the time and said hey get him a ticket well everything that I had dealt with in my life being rejected football accident uh getting in trouble um being arrested ah held overnight all this stuff I I knew that I needed to get away and burn some bridges because I wasn't going to make it on my own if I kept the same crowd so I decided yeah I'd go and so 2 and 1/2 Weeks Later 3 weeks later I'm on my first commercial flight and I'm off uh in 76 and I'm going to Israel little did I know that it was a one-way ticket and there was no return so the Lord knows how to deal with you you know when you when you Rebel so and I think brother green purposely did that in In Cahoots with my folks so I I I don't know but off to Israel I went Adventure seeking yes so I I arrived if any of you know anything about Israel everything shuts down on Friday evening starts shutting down Friday afternoon for the evening because that's the beginning of Sabbath well I arrive probably 4:30 5 o' and there's two brothers on their way to get me and I'm standing out in Israel I can't speak the language I can't read it I can't you know there's no way to Comm uh communicate with anybody and I'm wondering where's my ride so the only thing I knew to do is I have that I have an address where I need to go I get a taxi and happen to be an Arab uh taxi driver because there you know they work on the Sabbath and everything this now you have to understand this is a time when there's hijackings there's bombs going off and there's all this violence happening so I get in the back of this taxi and off we go toward natana and I'm thinking all I see is sand dunes in the ocean or Mediterranean Sea and I'm thinking boy this guy's going to take me and slit my throat throw my body out somewhere and you know no one's going to find me and that's the end well it happened that uh the two brothers were running late and there was no way to communicate so we sort of passed each other you know they're going to Tel Aviv to the airport I'm on my way to um natana and I get there and uh got with the brothers and sisters and um they were pretty happy you know Carol was there uh at the time there was some other brothers and sisters but Brother Ray Ericson some of you know know them uh he was there it was actually brother L's uh father uh and another I forget who the other brother was that was on on their way to pick me up brother Reynold uh Johnson and but I had missed him so that began that was the beginning of a long year which I didn't know that it was going to be a year but but I got there and I realized uh within that first week like what in the world did I do you know I'm here I can't I can't communicate but what it was for me was it was the it was the beginning of a new era I had to burn my bridge I couldn't go back and if you look at the uh in history some of the Conquistadors when they came to the new territory was their commitment was when they got off the ship to discover to go out and to search and discover the new land the new territory they burned their Bridges they burnt their ships and sunk the ships so there was no going back and this is what brother green did for me was that he gave me a one-way ticket and it was either sink or swim and I learned to swim so being there um I'd burnt all the bridges with the people I used to hang with all the drugs all the running around all the drink and that that type of Lifestyle I just had to burn it and I I started to seek the Lord and to get into the message and and read my Bible and to pray and and the Lord became very very real to me um uh during that time and it was in uh it was within the first two weeks I want to say that uh I stayed at brother Reynold Johnson's place with uh brother ly's parents uh and I lived in in an ultra Orthodox section of uh natana with u the ultra Orthodox Jews and it was uh quite different for me but during that time time the lord gave me a scripture and I'd like to read that to you Ezekiel 36 verse 25- 27 and the word says then I will sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statues and ye shall keep my judgments and do them and that really really helped because i' had never been away from home like that and I felt like the Lord was speaking to me directly I did have some experiences there um I worked at a local hospital that was under construction uh like some of the sisters and one night um I I came home late I worked 3: to 11: so it's probably 11:30 midnight uh that I actually you know climbed in bed and the way my bed was is that it was like right here and I had a chair at the head of the bed and I had put my slippers gotten undressed put my clothes there and uh climbed in bed and I'm I'm starting to go to sleep and I hear the this Shuffle of um the slippers moving you know I I heard them very vividly and my face was laying against I was facing the wall and I'm telling you I was freaked out uh because you could feel this evil presence right there I mean it was evil and I have felt that before uh when I was doing stupid things but this you could hear that shuffling of the the slippers and then I started praying with everything I had um calling on God in in the simple way that I could and I was I was terrified to even roll over and look because I I truly expected to see a demon or the devil standing right there and the more I prayed then all of a sudden a sweet presence came into the room I mean it was gone the evil was gone and my my the room wasn't very big you could ask you know Carol brother Lyall how big the rooms were they were very very small and this this room is where we ate had a little closet had my bed and so it was somewhat cramped and I rolled over and there was this white light the room was gone all I saw was this white light and there was such a sweet presence in the room and I know I had been delivered of things in my life in 1977 I came back uh after a year I guess I was paroled I was able to come back to the States I came back we um landed in new uh New York flew to Newark New Jersey on over to uh Pennsylvania picked up another young man at the time and we drove cross country it was in 1977 then I met brother Arie Peterson for the first time in Oakland uh we stayed with them I believe got to know the Peterson Family um and then I came back through uh a azuza California and I was able to to call my great-grandmother at the time and I wanted to find out a little bit about my history where she gave me my lineage uh my mother was Jewish and Bubba as we called her or Sarah you know Grandma Sarah she gave me my lineage all the way back to uh the tribe that we descended from and uh she told me we were Levites at the time so it was sort of my Mo my own mother didn't even know that until I told her uh my aunt was Jewish married in the synagogue so uh it was quite interesting I went back to Israel in late 77 and I started hearing some of the brothers or some of the brothers called me hey we found a young lady for you and they started telling me about my wife Kathy and I said well I'll get back when I get back well you to understand this a little bit brother Fran my brother-in-law came to Tucson in 1970 stayed with brother Lyle brother green invited him uh and he came to Tucson to learn uh to study the message he was young he was a young minister at the time uh didn't know a whole lot about brother brandham and brother green invited him well my sister-in our sister-in-law I should say just not mine but our sister-in-law Susan had got uh came to the Lord in 1970 and had taken French in high school so brother green put Susan together with France wall so she could help him uh understand the the message obviously uh when you put two people like that together um Sparks Fly and uh they ended up getting married in 1970 so I tease uh franois that you came to America and stole an American girl I I'll get you back so in 1977 I started writing U sorry I started writing um the interest sparked up and I won't go back to 75 when I met Kathy the first time I wasn't interested so uh but in 77 I start I hear Kathy this Kathy that and then I started uh get curious and so I write uh to do everything proper because you York is very traditional I write a letter dear brother France wall I was wondering if you'd give me permission to write to your sister Kathy about two weeks later I get a letter back and said dear brother Edwin yes I give you permission to write to my sister Kathy and great so I started writing Kathy only to find out that Kathy was franell secretary and she says franell what do I do whatever you want to do you write the letter so Kathy writes de your brother edman I give you permission to write themiz and I I found out after we were married so I think uh you know it was I was set up but um but I got I got the better of francoa I I went to Europe got his sister and then I I I got a secretary and then I brought her back to the States so I got him where where it hurts um but we Cath Kathy and I did go back to Europe or go back to Israel for a year and um there the Lord you know had given me a scripture about having I just I felt that the Lord was speaking to me about us being there and having children there so um we left went back to Europe and and that's where we uh we stayed until um 84 the first time because I was there I I was able to help brother Francois in the things that he does and it's the things of trivial things you help him around the house help him that I would be a driver um I would take him to different uh churches and we would uh he would Minister so I heard there's three sermons I heard multiple times and uh I still know the titles and I and when I when I'm with brother Francois I said well when are you going to preach this or when are you going to preach that he says you still remember that I said yeah I mean you ingrained it in me uh with all the traveling we did uh but it was the Oak in the Reed the gaying of Kora and there was another one I can't think of it right now but um those really you know I heard them multiple times and I heard him in French he didn't translate him from me I heard him in French and I understood him and got the Gest of them after we were married and I was working it came back you know there again the rejection came back out that I wasn't a normal person I you know I had a limp you know I my leg was an inch and a half shorter I when I worked I had my boss My foreman you know make fun of me because you know I had a handicap and it just refered um the resentment the hurt uh the pain that I had dealt with growing up but yet I I realized that God was mindful at me and brothers and sisters you go through difficult things whatever it may be you go through it you don't understand why you go through it but you go through it because it's character building and then when you look back at it oh that's why right I went through it it's not easy to go through it by no means but there was I look back at it and it's just like you know we we've talked would I go through everything I've gone through here again after losing brother green I and I'm I'm thinking yeah I probably would because it's the experience it's the lessons that I learned um from it doesn't it doesn't didn't make it easier but now I I I yes I would go through it again because the lessons are invaluable you can't put a price on that uh I am today who I am because of what I've gone through and I have no regrets um I've just had to work harder I've had to prove myself um to show people hey I can do this and I can do it better and I can do it faster than other people we we I brought the family back to the states in ' 84 in8 5 we moved up to Flagstaff because I had I was buting heads with my dad uh and then couldn't really make it up in Flagstaff it was a very difficult time it was winter time and then we came back and we realized something uh back in we went back to Europe in ' 86 we were too europeanized for the states we didn't like it I I didn't like it here I'm an American I did not like the states my family didn't like the states people are rude too much Freedom so we all we went back to Europe and the Lord miraculously opened the door for us to go back into Switzerland um to understand this you can't get into Switzerland without a job and you can't get a job without a permit and so it's a catch 22 sort of cancels each other out but immediately you know we applied and had a job to go back into Switzerland and that was at a time that brother francal was building his church in his home and I was able to help him with along with other brothers to go back there uh and build this the church brother Fran and sister Susan bought a at the time it was 300 uh 300y old farmhouse it's probably you know uh 300 50 now um but it was quite old and we totally gutted it and made the church there there at the same time uh Brother Francis was recording many nights I helped brother franwall with the recording of brother brandham in the French uh language at that time brother Fran would would take um a message he he'd play a portion of brother brandham the tape would stop and he translate directly um into the French language and this is how it would go and we often did this at night um until 2 3:00 in the morning because that's when it was quiet we didn't want the noise from the outside getting on to the recording brother Francois was very very um finicky in how the recording came out and that's why he is still the voice of brother brandham in the French language today I I'll show you all here in a little bit uh a couple pictures of of how he does it uh his church and just the different things so back in '89 I really felt led to bring my family back uh to the states and it was something that was important for me but yet I had stiff off position from it my own brother-in-law told me I was not stable it wasn't the will of the Lord and I wanted my kids to know their family uh their grandparents especially so when God wants you to do something God brother brother green used to say and brother br says you look at your motive and see if the the lights line up well the motive was correct the desire was there and then all of a sudden we had the finances everything just lined up we shipped our stuff we uh back and then our our children got to know um their grandparents our kids growing up uh have gone through a lot of difficult times our daughters gone through a difficult time our son's gone through a difficult time and it was the last few years uh and I won't go into details but we lived in a um we went through one of the darkest times of our life I I just couldn't see how the light any light coming through I just didn't understand why we were going through this 2005 our son uh our son's going to go to war it was a stressful time for me our daughter Rachel got married son's going to war uh he was going and then he wasn't going he's going he's not going finally he ends up going uh he's over in in Texas you know getting ready to to ship out to to Iraq I go to work uh one day and um my partner calls me and says Hey where's the trailer with all our equipment I said it's over here and he said no it's not and we're starting at 3:00 in the morning and I get I get to the job and sure enough our trailer had been stolen so we lost you know a lot of money a lot of equipment and then the very you know I'm dealing with that and then the very next day we have a construction accident where I almost lost a brother so my plate was overflowing with a lot of uh stress and a lot of things going on and I had a brother from flaxa call me and ask if I was all right I just you know by the grace of the Lord I'm doing well it was hard to go through so as as we advance the the time I had spoken in 2005 to brother Chester higs and I'm pouring out my heart to brother Chester about my son going to war and as a parent you don't want to see that for your children children and it became a very difficult time for me I felt I'm driving to Phoenix I'm gone and I feel the weight of the whole world on my shoulders and I'm crying to God and it just this weight gets heavier and heavier so as I'm talking to brother Chester about it and I'm sort of complaining crying about it and um I said you know I'm a father and I don't want to see my son go to war I mean never see him again and then it dawned on me and and I don't know why I said it but I said you know if I'm a father not wanting to see my son go to war how much do our heavenly father want care about his children and when I said that the weight the heaviness in the truck lifted now so you you brothers and sisters understand I travel I've traveled extend intensively and I've been gone for many years for a long time uh and I've spent over 300 nights in a hotel in a year uh I come home long enough to change suitcases and out the door again and so that's where I have my time A lot of times that's where I have my time with the Lord is when I'm traveling early and brother bham said early in the morning is the best time because the spirits are calm and so I find that's really the perfect time for me to commune with the Lord listen to uh a message um to pray to sing to Worship the Lord it's it's just in those brief moments and then I realized after I said that if my heavenly father cares about his CH if I care about my children not wanting to see him hurt how much more is our heavenly father and I got a revelation that carry has carried me through to this day that no matter what happens even if my own son came home in a body bag which is hard to accept God was in control and it's it's not something to take lightly and the weight of that statement is a pretty heavy weight and then we we go through this this dark moment I mean I just like where in the world did this come from and what kept coming back was it's okay leave it alone I'm in control I've got it handled don't worry about it every day for about a year when I was strong Kathy is weak when I'm weak Kathy was strong but God gave us a nugget to let us know it's okay I'm in control I've got it handled and I've got a reason I've done this and now as I look back I go Lord how gracious you've been um because we see the fruits of it of what has happened being changed and if you look at the story of Joseph Joseph went through all that he did in order to save lives Joseph Ro Rose to the right hand of pharaoh in order to save lives the other night Wednesday night we you were ministering on Daniel and we were talking about find a character in the Bible that you can identify with brother Daniel was talking about well he identifies with Daniel he identifies with Paul and I got to thinking about that well who do I identify with who can I identify with and then I thought I can identify with Joseph I I I haven't gone through what Joseph has gone through but I can identify with Joseph because when you look at what he went through he kept it he kept the right attitude through it all that's right he kept his attitude he trusted in Jehovah God I I'm sure he was down at times I mean there's there's no doubt he I'm I'm not saying he didn't have his moments but he rose to the right hand of pharaoh no one could come to Pharaoh without going through Joseph and then I started thinking I can identify with Joseph now I'm not the right hand of brother Dan please that's not what I'm saying but I could I could I could identify with the trials that Joseph went through and yet God being merciful and delivering them through that so the Lord has delivered me through many many things and the hardest part was growing up and being rejected because we none of us like uh the rejection no one Everyone likes wants to be liked but growing up I just had to deal with it and I moved on but it shaped my character and now it's like it's okay I I'm fine with uh what people think I don't know if you could go ahead and uh is that ready to the PowerPoint okay so through our life God has blessed my family God has blessed us for a number of years last three years I'm going to guess uh we had desired to go go back to Europe last time I was in Europe was in um 2016 and we saw the family and this trip I I just uh there was something gnawing at me to I need to get my wife Kathy um back to see her family but yet at the same time time I I'm a I like the history of the Second World War and I had desired to go to aitz I had really desired to go Kathy spent probably a year you know actually working on the trip and a lot of things were not lining up and so I wanted to uh it was something I had desired well she worked Hotel wasn't lining up we couldn't get a flight in we couldn't get this we couldn't get the train it just it just wasn't coming together finances weren't coming together um and then little by little we we talked about it what what if we change this and change that and then all of a sudden the pieces of the puzzle started coming together so we we had desired to go to uh oshit so Kathy and I um we left tuon the the 30th of May of this year and our flight was out of Tucson which uh we left half hour laid out of Tucson which wasn't too bad and we had calculated that we were going to have we had about 4 hours in Paris to catch our connecting flight we flew through Chicago and we were sitting in Chicago and about every 20 minutes we got an alert your flight's delayed another 20 minutes another half hour and this finally three and a half hours later we were boarding the plane so we fly to Paris uh I hope this is oh do I have sorry I didn't have it on so we fly to par 3 and 1/2 hours late well we we couldn't get a connecting flight so we had we flew into Paris we had to get our stuff we had had to go through customs get our bags recup our bags and then go to another airline so I put this here to for a reason I'm telling we're we leave three and a half hours late in the in Paris I'm tell well it doesn't look like we're going to make our flight there's no way we can go through customs and all this and get back and be you we only got about an hour and a half and there's no way it's going to take us at least two to go through customs and we're flying easy jet so what happens to the left up here I don't know uh oops how on okay so to the left of the airplane our flight with American Airlines pulls up to the gate wow Lord you must and I told Kathy well Lord I'm I'm saying Lord if you don't want us to go to aitz then you know it's okay we'll we'll do something else so we pull right up next the the next gate next to to the easy jet we go through customs we're we've gone through customs we've recuperated our bags all within 40 minutes we go to easy jet and they won't let us check in because we're too early I okay Lord uh so we stood 20 minutes waiting 20 30 minutes waiting to go check in they wouldn't let us go in until 3 uh 3:15 we they started letting us go we were overweight I got to tell you we were overweight on our bags the only the only time we paid for the extra uh weight was in Tucson we here in Paris the lady at e oh you're overweight but I don't feel like charging you so go ahead so it it was a blessing I got to tell you that the Lord provided some financial means for us to go also so we were we were truly blessed so we catch our flight L we get into CRA uh crack cow never been to Poland we had reached out to some brothers and sisters to see if they and it just wasn't working they just couldn't help us so okay I'm sorry this is new to me so we go to aitz and I posted this if you want to if you want to see I don't know if you can see that I I saw this and this was very true those who do not remember the past are condemmed to repeat it that can even be with our walk with the Lord this is a pretty renowned picture of oshits you when you see the pictures this was uh this was a Fitz 2 we went to number one first and we took a tour with uh a company and had a young man that was just a phenomenal guide I still have his number and we've kept in contact a little bit I need to to reach out to him but he um his family lives up in uh in the close to the Ukraine border but they they've been he was really concerned but I want you to know that people watch you as Christians you may not think it but people are watching you and they're going to see how you're going to react to situations this is the entrance of uh the gas chamber to the left they would put about 700 people here I didn't want to go into all the a lot of the graphic things but the Lord blessed sister Cathy and I with about a week a little over a week alone we we were able just the two of us which we really really needed uh she was been extremely busy uh taking care of things with work and grandkids and I was traveling and it just uh you start budding heads because you don't spend enough time you sort of grow apart a little bit and it was a good time to to reconnect this was one of the uh bunks in the dormatory where they slept it was designed to hold four people and often they put seven or eight on a bunk like this the pray Shaws of those that um gave their life and it was wasn't just Jewish people so often that we hear oh it it's just the Jews it wasn't just Jews but they were they were the majority brother brandham and I'd like to read you a little quote um it's from the third exus brother brandham said and it was in Germany and in up into Russia and Italy the people rised raised up Joseph's Hitler and Stalin melini who hated the Jew they had to go back to their Homeland God you've got ways of doing things that we don't understand I don't understand why I went through the things in my life I don't understand why uh these people were massacred were slaughtered just because they They Carried the label of Jew and you press them no home in Germany everything taken from them also in Italy Russia no place to go and they were sent back to their Homeland just to fulfill the word oh the loving hand of God how sometimes it looks cruel of the way that people suffer but it still it's the tender hand of Jehovah leading his little children we thank you Lord had this not happened brothers and sisters we probably most likely would not H have Israel today they wouldn't be in their they wouldn't be blessed brother Brenham says the Jewish people cannot be blessed outside their Homeland after that we flew in uh we flew to Zurich and we spent uh a week in interlockin it was a time of relaxation Discovery for Kathy and I we love to discover things together places I'd never seen I mean I I'd seen that from there but I'd never actually been up to it this is the young FR when when we left Tucson we looked at the weather and it called for rain every single day that we were going there we took stuffed for the rain we had he heavier clothes we thought it was going to be cold that's why we were overweight besides some of the gifts and yet we ended up with sun the lord gave us every day sunshine there was a brief moment in Poland and crack out that we had 15 minutes of rain and it cleared up every morning sister Kathy and I would hold hands in the room and we'd commit our day to the Lord and ask the Lord to guide us and to grant us a good time I was happy with rain I mean we we didn't get a lot of rain here in two some I'd been happy but uh but the lord gave us Sunshine then we go uh we spent a week in um interlock and then we go see brother Fran so this is Brother Fran on the right Kathy on the left and his aunt Diva 105 years old still going strong still loves the Lord and makes the services every Sunday morning at 105 now brother uh brother Fran was the original translator um for brother brandham in the French language he has been known or has become the voice of brother brandham in the French language there was a time that um due to some things with the voice of God that he wasn't doing it anymore and they uh the voice of God tried to get someone else to be the voice of brother brandham and the people rose up and rebelled because maybe it was the acent I I don't know but the people wanted brother Fran back and to understand this brother Fran does not have an agenda when he translates he may if brother brandham accentuates a word brother franell it accentuates the the same word he makes it as if brother brandham is speaking French he keeps it in the same atmosphere that it was given he tries to make sure that the spirit is the same this is Brother franwell Church believe it or not he has aund about I think 120 people is that right Kathy in his church when I I count at the chairs it'll all and he can get probably about 80 90 people into the church and it's a third this size and they you know they're it's like we were back in the days where people were just crammed I mean we have he has chairs in the aisles chairs in the back VES of you chairs on the side wings I mean but 97 98% of his church is African and they can worship uh they know how to worship uh there they're singing I don't I don't I don't have the uh the audio on that sorry but they uh they get to sing it and shouting and here's a front view of some of the brothers uh this brother this white brother here uh Brother s used to be um a trustee uh let's see I'm not sure where the all the PO on the pointer that's sister Susan right there that's Brother s hose Kathy's uh to the left of sister Susan but uh that's francois's uh cousin Sylvia and that's uh Aunt Diva uh they got her a recliner uh because of her age so the following Monday after after we we arrived um francea is so busy and it's hard for him to shut down we ended up uh getting him uh away for half a day a little over half a day so we took the boat from uh Neil in Switzerland went across the lake into uh France and it's a very old town down and we sat this is the only little restaurant that was open and the reason I took uh put this in here is because we sat down and I and I mentioned earlier we're being watched as Christians so we bowed our heads to pray over our food just a simple prayer and the waitress came up and says you're Christians aren't you and brother Francis saides and she saidwell so am I God bless you and they they built a rapport I he got her number I believe and I don't know if he's communicated with her but just this the fact of saying a prayer bless asking God to bless your food can impact someone's life over here uh brother alexand uh uh this is the song leader with his wife brother Spencer's uh like a associate pastor there brother tal and sister Romy and there's a testimony about this sister here she suffered postpartum depression for over a year closed up went into relle didn't eat a whole lot didn't have any communication with anybody and through prayer of the brothers and sisters God delivered her after a year of postpartum depression all of a sudden she's happy she's cheerful wonderful family um they speak English brother tal translates for for her uh brother Spencer here in the middle and brother tal they both work for the un uh whatever they do you know for the UN a a lot of it's in uh the technical uh computers and things like that now here uh the this is how France uh translates the message of brother brandham it used to be that um the message would be translated by a sister in Canada Kathy for for about a year uh was part of a correction oh part of Translate translation team and it'd go to France wall and then it would it would go to Kathy Kathy would proofread it correct it it get sent back correct it I don't know if uh she did any more Corrections and then sister Susan would proofread it after and then it would go to voice of God and then they'd put it out well now what they do is voice of God has done something with uh art artificial intelligence they've got a program now that they they take all the sentences they put it into a a you know it's in the message is inputed computer trans Ates it and then it's uh proof red sister Susan will do that she'll she'll get it on the computer like this this is a little laptop and then right here is brother brandham and then here uh France wall will TR if it's ready to be translated France will stand there or sit and just like uh you know Kathy's having her hand at it and I'm I'm over here giving giving it a shot just to see what it's like and um he sits there and translates it but it's like a paragraph or a sentence or something at a time well if he he makes a mistake he can go back erase what he can erase this and re-record it and he does like one a week so he does four messages a month to get it out to the French language French is the there's more people speaking French for the voice of God than there is in English so I've SE we've seen the evolution of of the translation of the ministry now brother franah has a church he's also a missionary at the same time he does go out but he also does this and he kept extremely busy well yeah the audio so you don't you don't need to hear me uh butcher it so where where I was real excited was and this this is why I asked brother Daniel uh Jr to see me come from east and west because what this is franois has had a burden for the Arabic countries and so uh this sister's from Switzerland uh Kathy's uh by Fran I'm in another room this a sister uh this sister here is her friend and this Sister Sister Lydia from from Morocco is translating from French into Arabic and then this sister here is from Syria so we we had the privilege of participating in an Arabic Zoom meeting France brother franu would normally have spoken taken a topic and spoke but he asked Kathy and I to give our testimonies Kathy did really really well I got to tell you in French and I'll plead the fifth on me but it was an honor I want you to know it was it was an honor uh even in my broken broken French uh the sister uh sister Lydia would speak English could speak some English she was a teacher so I could I could fall sorry I could fall in uh back as a backup say something in English and she would translate it now this oops sorry this sister here um she sang a little special in Arabic AC capella and it was so sweet um and I have to say I you know all living in Israel uh with the Jews Israelis I became very biased sort of built up a guard against the Arabs brother brandom said this message will go in every to every nation and tongue and I realize that I had to repent of my attitude because these are our Brothers and Sisters in Christ they love the Lord just as much as you do it's the shed blood of Calvary that have saved them now this brother here we H we have Morocco we have Algeria this sister's in Syria he's in Jordan and I'm not sure where this brother's from or that brother but I want to say there was probably 20 different people online for the zoom meeting and I'm not sure if some were from Egypt or Lebanon I I I I that I don't know but this brother brother mmud he took his family and had to flee for their lives because he was a Christian he he hadn't been baptized yet but he he accepted Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior the reason he fled because he used to be a teacher of the Quran to teach uh the Muslim faith so he left and he went to a different city I called brother franell here a couple weeks ago and I wanted to find out because I was so blessed at the service um I was truly blessed the I really felt the presence of the Lord with the test little testimonies and the Spirit uh the interaction with Francois and the brothers and sisters so brother mammut his wife was still a Muslim she fell hit her head Had a Brain Hemorrhage he's a relatively new Christian and he sat with her at the hospital and prayed all night long he prayed and prayed and prayed through the night and early in into the morning and when he said amen she said amen and then went to be with the Lord at the very last moment on her deathbed I believe she accepted Jesus Christ as her savior quite distraught over the uh passing of his wife brother uh the lord gave brother mmud uh a dream and in the dream he saw his wife happy at peace with the one that she loved and he believes that's the Lord Jesus she was with the Lord that so I'm sadden that he lost his wife but I'm I'm rejoicing that heaven got another Angel to sing the choir this was the train that we traveled on oh one like this uh that was our main transportation around Europe Kathy you know had recorded it 223 miles hour uh we had I looked up and took a picture at 197 but it was quite comfortable uh but that's the way we we traveled so a lot in Paris we C sister Kathy and I uh it we had a time to reconnect with family and I was very very happy that her sister a baby sister lives in the southwest part of France uh they she had sort of pushed Kathy away due to whatever um still don't know but it was all right uh when we tra when when we had made the plans to go to um down it ended up that the comment was what me what you're not going to come see us and I really felt that instead of going to see the Lavender Fields that we needed to go see her sister well we spent three wonderful days uh with them both her sister and her husband are retired lawyers and the two girls reconnected after many years they talked for three days straight I don't know how but they did so Kathy and I we were able to reconnect with family she saw all her siblings except one and then we spent a week in Paris this is uh the chapel San Chappel it was influenced by charlan if I'm saying it right who was an early Christian and the reason I took these pictures and as I told Brother Dan because in this Chapel all the way around it tells the story of the Old Testament um uh this is on the south side but this one here starting here working all the way up tells the Book of Genesis in its entirety and then it goes around uh and we're talking Book of Genesis the book of Exodus the Book of Numbers then it combines uh the Minor Prophets and it goes around and then this one here is is the story of Esther it's the book of ES I didn't have I didn't want to put every every uh picture in there but but it tells the story of the Bible and it spoke to me uh and then this one here this picture is the Book of Revelations so it tells everything on the Old Testament and then ends with the Book of Revelations so yeah you can see here there's uh Genesis Exodus Numbers Deuteronomy Joshua Judges then we get into Isaiah John the Evangelist uh The Passion of Christ is in the very middle there and then we get uh John the Baptist and Daniel right there and then we go to Ezekiel and uh Jeremiah job Esther the Kings and then um the story of the relics of the passion on the last one and then it was all about uh The Book of Revelation it's this this circular one and that's how we ended our uh our journey the Lord really really blessed us we met some wonderful brothers and sisters who truly love the Lord and it was just a real honor to to reconnect with some old friends um I was able to reconnect with a an Old Co a colleague that uh I used to work with when I worked in Switzerland and we keep in contact every year especially Christmas time and it's just non-stop I mean it's just doing well he looked really bad but uh it was good and it it just it was a real blessing to to have to have had the time to to get with family to spend the time alone to have quality time with my wife but for me part of the Highlight was to see the brothers and sisters in the Arabic countries so that that's how our trip ended and then we came home and back to the Grind so but the Lord's been good to us um I have no complaints the Lord has truly truly been good the Lord's been faithful through all the tests and trial we've gone through uh the character building it's not easy to go through all that but it's it's worth it all it is truly worth it all so I hope this has been a help don't lose hope keep pressing forward the Lord will see you through all things Lord bless [Applause] you you want one thing about brother Ed's testimony he didn't hear one complaint he went through a lot as a young man and then all the way through um with all the trials and tribulations but there wasn't a complaint it was all like you said it was all the character character building the Lord has something that he's doing in everything that happens to us and it's to build our character like brother Ed said and I really I really appreciated um I really appreciated everything from the time that he was a boy and he got hurt all the way up until now um really man of God and and a servant of God and a servant of God's people I I wanted to mention brother Francois I used to work with brother franu and um he said there was a bit of an uprising when uh they um when he was let go and uh brother franois the way that the translations work brother franu is is um he's French and he's European frenchs uh Swiss yeah swisserland in Europe I'm just kidding okay swits he's Swiss and he and he speaks but he speaks a very very clear French now in translating brother bram's message the French language is Far and Away the most important language there's 70s something different languages that they translate to French is by far the most important brother Ed said that more people speak French that listen to brother brandom than English that's a bit of an understatement there are three million about people that claim to believe brother brandom and claim to listen to his message of those 3 million 2 million speak French so it's not only is it more than English is more than all the other languages combined there's a million and a half in Congo alone and at least another half a million throughout Africa and then just a few more in um in Europe very very few actually in Europe most of those most of those French speakers are um in Africa central Africa and he was talking about brother France wall in this Arabic work he mentioned a little bit but it is a very very serious Danger that these brothers and sisters go through and I've known some of them that have been put in prison because of the work that they're doing and this sister in Syria and uh especially in Syria she'll they'll go to jail if if they're lucky they'll go to jail so very very serious serious thing that they're doing and just Brave we we have a very easy here in the United States but in uh in those Arabic countries they are at the Peril of their own lives in what they're doing so appreciate what brother France W is doing there he mentioned a um an AI work uh program that that they're doing that they're using now it's called the Omega program that um that is helping uh make the translations go faster and more accurate and uh it was it was really nice because my son-in-law wrote the program not that I'm proud but I'm proud I'm proud of him so really really really um touched by what brother Ed said and uh and how he was able to go to Europe and and witness
