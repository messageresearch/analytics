that we know how when we pray father that that you would accept our sacrifice Lord that you would accept our desires that that our prayers and our lives would come up before you as a sweet smelling savior upon your throne Lord father we ask Lord that you have mercy Lord that you'd be with us tonight father that you would bless us by just looking our way granted Lord we love you father we just are so grateful in the name of your son Jesus Christ let's remain standing and let's turn to the book of Philippians chapter 4. sister hope that was a beautiful song let me walk with you Jesus is the desire of my heart God bless you for using your talent to glorify our Lord Philippians chapter seven I'm sorry Philippians chapter 4 verse 7. and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do in the God of Peace shall be with you amen you can take your seeds what a testimony that the Apostle Paul has that he could say those last words the things that you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do I wow that's the Apostle Paul lifted himself up there he must have been living this life that we call Christianity it must have been serious about it I am he was a great man a little while one day I want to shake his hand say thank you for all that you've done we um appreciated brother Peter this morning he talked about talked about snakes and uh it's funny because it goes along I wanted to give a testimony to start out um I was uh I spent the past couple weeks not last week but weeks before that it was I was hunting and uh I was helping a guy that um he uh last time I helped him he killed an absolute monster bull elk and that was about 18 years ago and he got drawn again he said hey I heard you came back to Arizona he said would you want to point me in the right direction and and I love hunting I don't necessarily like killing the animals but I like going and I like you know helping other people so we went up there he's a Lutheran and uh a few people had called me or texted me and said hey I'm praying for you I believe the Lord's got something special and um so I had I high expectations and we went along our hunts and um he uh he asked me he says um what uh what do you hope to accomplish in your ministry what is your ministry about and I said well I said you know we have all these different churches we have all these different organizations and we have all this Division and I said the main thing and I think it comes back to the Bible the main thing is that we could encourage a personal relationship with Jesus Christ I know that sounds cliche because pretty much every Church would say that but that is the main thing is that we can encourage people to have this relationship not with a priest but with Christ and I asked him I said your religion and he wasn't really practicing Lutheran but I said your religion is based on a man that died 500 years ago I said uh where is Martin Luther today I said where is that man that struggled that thought with the devil all night long as Martin Luther did I said where's Martin Luther today I said where is that Martin Luther that stood up against the tyranny of the Catholic Church the murderous nature of the church and took 95 reasons why the Catholic church is wrong and nailed them to the church door I said where is Martin Luther today we talked about it and um I got to thinking that's a good question to ask myself there is there should be Martin Luther's today there should be John Wesley's today there should be William branham's today among the people real Christians and so he was I was I was expecting something brother Aaron and I didn't I didn't know what it was so I uh we finished he uh he had a wonderfully successful hunt he ended up he was very much a perfectionist he ended up not killing one but um he didn't want to kill a little one so so everything was good in the world so I drive home I get home late um on Thursday night and uh it was I don't know midnight if it's dark out so I park my truck where I always park it doesn't matter if you could put that first picture up of the two vehicles there I parked my my truck where I usually park right here yeah right there and uh you can see there's about three feet between between the two bumpers there and so I I got out I got my stuff out I closed the door when you close the door the lights go off and I was walking around the truck and just the fog lights are on and I couldn't see anything and I was walking around the truck and immediately something happened and it wasn't like something spoke to me I knew what was going on I took my foot back I jumped back and I knew that there was a coiled up rattlesnake right on my next step if you could go to the next slide I took a picture of you can't see it can you that's when I turned on the lights of the vehicle and I jumped back and it was the strangest feeling I don't know if it was a involuntary defense response that's in in the human brain but I felt on the bottom of my foot I felt that snake underneath my foot I didn't step on it but I felt it I jumped back and and you know it's like whoa you know this that was that was real I went I turned my lights on and I see the guy you see him right there in the middle of the picture you know obviously my blood pressure was up I'm looking at the thing and there's this giant snake I mean it's like this big seemed that big maybe it wasn't that big but it was big and that fangs you know big fangs and and uh so I jumped back in and I've been around snakes my whole life I grew up in Tucson and I've never really been afraid of them you know brother Peter was saying how much he hates him I didn't care Stephanie's always yelling at me for picking up the the harmless ones and and I don't like them it's not like I have pet snakes or anything but Peter but I don't I don't mind them I like nature um so I wasn't really scared of it but I I saw what had happened there and I knew that God had protected me and I want to give him glory for that brother Peter asked the question he said he said this morning he says well what do you do with your snakes if you go to the next slide he uh he didn't make it but that was him the next day and uh yeah he got the bad end of Stephanie's broom um but uh yeah there he was right there coiled up there is no way I could have walked between those two vehicles without stepping on that snake God protected me and he is always there friends even I brought you know I wouldn't have killed me but it would have been a very in much of an inconvenience to get bitten by that thing but I want to give God the praise and I think it was it was a good timing from what Peter said this morning to give that testimony I'm grateful thank you brother Matt um and another thing that happened is brother Morrow when he was praying this morning he he prayed that his wife he was thanking the Lord that his wife had found her ring and I thought you know it'd be a good time to give this testimony to a few months about a month ago Robert fritzinger y'all probably know the fritzinger family Robert fritzinger um called me he he works he works for me I'm a supervisor um and uh he called and he was back in Indiana and I feel bad for Robert before I left Tucson I was Robert's boss and then I come back to Tucson and I'm still his boss poor guy can't win for losing but but he was in Jeffersonville he was in Indiana and he called me and he says hey he says Nana um I uh would it be okay if I had a couple more days off he said he said my wife she lost the diamond out of her ring and he said we just we want to go back and look for it and I said I said yeah sure I said um where's uh you know where'd you lose it she said he says well it's really bad he says we're at the lake all day and he said you know if we were in the boat she had her hands over hanging off in the water as the water was rushing by in the boat you know she she was on the dock she was at the playground she was and he's like I just I just want to look a little bit more and um I said sure and he said would you pray you know that we find it I said absolutely and I have to admit my faith wasn't what it should have been there was no way to find that diamond out of that ring Robert was he was a little upset and he said he's he said he's got four kids he said the kids were just crying they were so hurt that mom had lost her diamond and Robert you know this is this is he told me he says this is the union this is the token of the Union between me and my wife he says I wanted to find it so I have to admit that my faith wasn't I asked the Lord but my faith wasn't where it should have been but his children were praying earnestly and sometimes when we pray for people the reason that Jesus's prayer meant so much the Bible says that he is a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities Jesus went through it whatever we're suffering with whatever's hindering us whatever temptation's there whatever sickness is there Jesus experienced it he was God made flesh he's been through it so he's someone that we can touch and these these kids I had a burden for their mom they were crying and they're like Lord Jesus and they were praying and there's a Lord give mom back her diamond they looked all day long they looked in the bathrooms they looked on the playgrounds they looked on the beach they looked everywhere that they could find that they could think of they looked couldn't find it obviously they couldn't find it she had her hand in the water you know it was probably at the bottom of the lake so they they went after that they went to Subway and uh that night and and couldn't find it there so Robert called me and said hey can I have another day I said yes they go back and they look again all day for a diamond a little tiny Stone it looked all day it started getting dark and it got dark Robert's wife's name is Kika they had flashlights and they said well let's go let's go over to the um let's go over the playground and sad the kids were just so upset go to the playground and Kika they had the flashlights and and they're looking and Kika shines it over there there was a little Sparkle she gets up closer there's a leaf laying on the ground and underneath that leaf was a sparkle she she walked up she picked up the leaf and there was the little diamond a miracle that God did and we we think about these children imagine how that increased the faith of the children brother Matt can you play that for me this is this is Robert's oldest son where where she would find it and I believed in him and it happened so that means god is real hey man I asked him to put it to put her Stone where she can find it and I also asked him to put where my to put my name to Lori in and wake up where I can find it me and that happened and and since we know what he made that means he's real he's absolutely real wonderful amen isn't that wonderful I I could preach for a month and I couldn't say it like that kid just said it he is real and he cares it was impossible for that diamond to be found but he heard the prayer of this little kid of these children they had a burden friends they had a burden for their mom and the Lord stepped on the scene and when we pray for each other that's why we enter into that suffering with whoever we're praying for and there was there was a time that back in the 50s there was a prayer line that that was that came up and uh but the Branham was standing there and this woman with a baby came up before him and brother Branham he had a gift that he could tell the very secrets of the heart and as people were coming up he would discern this is what's wrong with you this is this is where you're struggling this is where you live this is this is whatever it is this woman came up she had the baby and he said sister he says your baby is not sick and she said okay he said there was a woman over here that saw your sick baby and she was a mother and she had a burden for that child and she came up and asked you sister can I pray for that child I know that you're you're in the prayer line and I know brother branham's a wonderful man but but can I pray for her just before you go up there can I pray for your child he said of course and she was even embarrassed to pray for her because of where she was at but she prayed for the baby because she had that burden because she had that love because she entered into that suffering because she was a mother that baby was healed right there and then when it came through the line there was nothing wrong with it so as we pray we need to remember enter into that suffering of that person I think three is perfection I got a letter from um I uh when I first when I first moved to Tucson I thought Lord what can I do how can I help the body and I noticed that there were some some of the uh Brethren that were in prison from the different churches and I said well maybe I can write them letters encourage them I know how much it means for an inmate to receive a letter that's that's golden somebody out there cares about me they're stuck there don't forget them they're there and we know that there has been great men that had been prison Paul was one of them and this Philippians letter was written while he was in prison so I started writing um these Brethren and one of the brothers gave me a testimony and I just got the letter um I read it a couple a couple days ago and he gave a testimony there was a man named Dustin and this brother is teaching a Bible study inside a prison he's doing everything that he can to lead lead souls to Christ so he's he's teaching this Bible study in this this Justin Justin is from the Aryan Brotherhood rough white guys so Justin is married and Justin made his wife a ring in prison he had access to some of the tools and some of the scrap metal and it was a big No-No but he made his wife a ring because he loved her and he wanted to be able to give her something so he made this ring and he got it finished and he lost it he lost it during their work day so they're looking around and the brother said that they had swept the floor in the whole area they'd swept it twice they couldn't find the ring so so this brother's walking by and he's going he finishes his shift he's walking by he says what do you all do and he says we lost we lost a ring he said we can't let the guards find it we'll get in trouble and the brothers you know and the man he spent long time making this for his wife so so the brother started looking and the guards walked by and they're like yeah we're not doing anything just looking just sweeping so the uh the brother says to the Aryan Brotherhood Justin he says you know what we haven't done he said we haven't prayed so they got together let me read to you what this brother said what this brother wrote in his his letter he prayed this if he places such importance on those little items then would he have the value of this man and what this little ring means to him then when he valued the heart of this man and what this little ring means to him so he was asking the Lord and he says this said amen and this brother has issued a flashlight he said I turned on the flashlight after we prayed I lowered it down to the floor and turned it on and there four inches from my right foot was the ring they found it so he was sharing that testimony with another person in his bible study this guy's name was Spike you never would have guessed that so he is sharing this testimony about this man named Spike about uh this this Justin and the ring and he says he says uh uh Spike tells this brother he says hey he says um I'm about to be released to a halfway house and he says I'm about to be delayed because I owe 25 in fees and he says I have no way to pay that so this brother says well what do you want to do and he said well you prayed about the ring he says can you pray about the 25 dollars he says yeah so he prays about the 25 dollars and then the next morning when he's scheduled to be released they found out that that same day the previous day someone had paid the 25 dollars how much Faith did that raise same as this this boy how much Faith did that raise and spikes are so now he's out and I wonder if he's remembering that testimony it's a I've been uh Stephanie and merely were talking about this lady Corey ten Boom so I started reading about her she's the one that hid all the Jews and and uh I mean a tremendous testimony and she actually what what she did is there was a Judas among them and they told her they said hey this man's coming and he'll turn you in and she says I don't want to know who he is got to protect me so she wouldn't turn this man in and it ends up that that was the man that came in and told on this family and they are all imprisoned after that she has a tremendous testimony but she said this and I thought I thought it was really nice that in thinking about this diamond and thinking about these rings Corey ten boom says this she says let God's promises shine on your problems uh just that blessed me so much I am our God is real as a little brother said it he is absolutely a wonderful God he anointed a man two thousand years ago named Paul to write the biggest part of this new testament Paul had a style of writing that it was very interesting Paul would he he would write a letter and the first part of his letter he would bring correction he would bring instruction now Paul's writings weren't all butterflies and daisies there was a lot of Correction associated with Paul's writings but then he would get to a certain point and then he would say now here's what you do with it and in all of Paul's writings he really showed that there was a relationship between knowing what to do and doing it uh this morning sister Elizabeth came to she came up in the prayer line and I asked her if this was okay and she gave me permission she came up in the prayer line and she wanted us to pray about something that she said she was struggling with and it's something that probably eight out of 10 of us here struggle with and she was spending too much time on social media she was spending too much time on I call it the little square Idol or whatever it is and she said that she made this statement she said I should be the most holy one in this church because of the time that I have and and and then she came up and and we prayed for her and I thought that's exactly what Paul taught identify it and then do something about it and that's what our sister did this morning and I'll tell you what when you make that first step the first step's the hardest when you make that first step Lord I want to change I want to give a little bit more of myself as the song says I give myself away I want to give a little bit more of myself away I'm going to make that stuff and he will honor it he sees it don't ever think that he doesn't see it even when we fail he sees it he knows our intentions and he knows our efforts and I told the sisters this morning I said he won't tempt you any with anything more than you can't overcome yourself that's in his word so Paul in in the Book of Romans he gives correction the first 11 chapters of Romans Paul gives instructions on what to do and then in Romans 12 chapter 1 he says this he says now therefore make your bodies a Living Sacrifice and in Ephesians he does the same thing he goes in the first three chapters and then when he hits the fourth chapter he said I therefore a prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation we're with you called so Paul has a style of writing here First Corinthians he brings correction to this Corinthian Church he said you're all divided he said you're fighting he says and you know what you're doing you're taking sides in the church he says this one over here he says every one of you is saying I'm of Paul I am of Peter cephas I'm of Apollos and then this one over here says I'm of Christ and he says was Paul baptized were you baptized in the name of Paul did Paul die on the cross for you why are we not putting Christ first and you see it that is a problem in Christianity around the world and you see all the different divisions and all that but there's a prophecy that Jesus prayed that everything will come together I just pray there's going to be a lot that doesn't come together that are left out but I want to be part of the coming together let's turn to Philippians this is a prison epistle which means Paul wrote this from prison let's let's start with verse 4. Paul says this Philippians chapter 4 verse 4. rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice let your moderation be known unto all men the Lord is at hand the word moderation Modern English and other translations it means gentleness be careful for nothing again modern translation he says don't be anxious be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be known unto God and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus finally brethren whatsoever I just love reading this by the way I wanna read it loud finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things that's statement don't just read past it I'll say oh I should keep this stuff on my mind what Paul is saying when he says think on these things that's in a very very important statement in fact I think it's more important than what he said before because our thoughts brother Joe is Who We Are what we're thinking of defines us Proverbs 23 7 says for as he thinketh in his heart so is he so our thoughts are exactly Who We Are let's turn to Matthew chapter 15 keep we're going to go through that that whole chapter of Philippians so keep Philippians marked there but let's turn to Matthew chapter 15. verse 7. now Jesus is being accused of not doing the ceremonial hand washing and uh you know they're looking for something to criticize him for Jesus responds by saying this verse 7. you hypocrites well did it say as the prophet well did it says prophesy of you saying this people drawth nigh unto me with their mouth and on Earth me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men talking about not only about hand washing but there's a lot of things and he and he called the multitude and said unto them hear and understand not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man but that which cometh out of the man of the mouth defileth a man then the disciples came said unto him knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended after they heard the saying like whoa this made them mad but he answered and said every plant which my heavenly father hath not plant shall be rooted up let them alone they be blind leaders of the Blind and if the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch sometimes you know Jesus says leave them alone I know a lot of us sometimes feel the same way then answered Peter and said unto him declare unto this this Parable what does this mean and Jesus said are ye also yet without understanding do not ye yet understand that whatsoever enter in at the mouth goes into the belly and is cast out into the draft but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man so these things that are said that come out of our mouth that's what we're thinking and as Proverbs as I said for he that for as he thinketh in his heart so is he so it's these thoughts friends they they Define us and so often the way that that we live our lives the way that we handle things is we might scheme a little bit and we might think well if I do this then this person will do that it never works because that is what you would do if you were put in the same situation so if we're thinking about if we're always thinking about well this person's talking about me or that person's talking about this person's running me down maybe that's what you're doing maybe that is what's being come what's coming out of your mouth and you're worried about everybody else doing it be careful always check your thoughts think on these things our thoughts Are Who We Are so if we're always thinking somebody's trying to cheat me somebody's trying to do me wrong somebody's after me maybe it's not so much even that maybe it's that well that's probably what I would do if I was in that situation so examine yourself as the Bible says and um brother Brown says this that's a little quote and I love it I didn't give it to the brother but it says this a lie is the truth misused a lie is the truth misused so he can take something that's that's pretty much true and then you can twist it and make it into something that's destructive or something against and use it use it for something that's maybe a little nefarious in in the intents and it's just it gets disappointing and let me let me read you something my brother Branham said when I read this a I thought wow we have arrived brother if you put up that quote the trouble of it we go to church and sing to him and the pastor talks about the roses and the flowers and we go back home oh my that's the reason we don't get nowhere that's what's the matter with our Pentecostal churches now I never come here to Pat you on the back I come here to tell you the truth see in all the Pentecostal churches went on a building Rampage it's went on a denominational Rampage it's gone everywhere and cut and divided and pulled out and separated and segregated you know it's going to have this is going to be the biggest and that's going to be the biggest as long as you do that she'll never go nowhere remember I tell you in the name of the Lord but when you'll come together oh my that's it when you'll fully obey God this will all men know you're my disciples when you have love one for the other when you get part of the theology out and get a little love in there it'll do works and wonders and miracles but we have got to do that we have got to have that for who for everybody now here's what I'm getting to oh for that whole bunch of Assemblies of God or that whole bunch of Church of God or old Oneness or threeness or fineness or whatever they got me love them I couldn't love them they're Antichrist have you ever heard that he's talking about denominations here oh we're better than they are they're Antichrist they're mark of the beast they're all these things but what's the the one that we listen to the one that we follow he says this you're lost yourself brother when you think that that's a strong statement his pay grade's a little higher than mine so I can quote him that's right you're not right with God if you can't raise out a hand to the bitterest enemy you God and try to win him to Christ and the spirit of Christ isn't in you for he come he come to his own his own received him not yet he gave his life for his enemy he did how true is it and that spirit of God in you makes you feel the same way about everybody when you get to a place now you can't just act it the devil knows whether you're acting or not and friends I say the same thing and I look at people and I I look at good people and how can we put them down we don't even know oh they go to this nominal Church they go to that church they they like this brother or that brother or or whatever it is and yet we say this person isn't it the elect I got a friend that uh he was um he contacted me today he's he's such a sweet brother he was in um a church in Jeffersonville and uh not associated with us and um he said brother the Lord just placed us together he said brother he said we thought we were the bride he saw he said we thought we were the elite we thought we were the elect let me tell you who the elite is it's those that believe in Jesus Christ and I can't separate that's up to God it was Christ that came in and separated the sheep from the goats not me I love my brothers I love my sisters but it's Jesus Christ that saves us oh yeah I have a friend some of you have met him we were he's the one we're up on Denali in Denali State uh National Park up there and uh I met that that Hindu girl and introduced her to the Lord Jesus I don't know if if um if you remember the testimony but um so we came down and this girl she was all excited and and she said well how do I get in touch with you so I had my my brother give give him give her his phone number and uh she might have been a weirdo you know she wasn't but but but so so my my friend gave her his phone number and uh by the way they've corresponded and uh she has some more questions and she wants to know how do I choose a church a Christian Church so it's been a blessing but I was talking with him um the other day and he's he's asking me he says brother he says he says that the the one of the churches that he knows of they've asked him and they're having problems with the the pastor and problems with with the people so so he'll ask me you know how do you how do you advise on these things and and I said brother you don't understand you have to put yourself in these people's positions and and I said you have to put yourself in the pastor's position in this and he says he says you know he says why don't they just do things that are right for the people he says why don't they just do things according to what is best for the people and I said brother you don't understand all of us are looking from different perspectives we may be looking at this this Hymnal right here and I might be seeing but I don't see anything here you might see all this you know that's what I've been looking at it's a different perspective but it's the same book and I said you have to have patience with him and he said he said this he says well why don't they just do what's right for the people if they know and and um I told him I said I said brother it's it's perspective and and you have to put yourself in that other person's position let's go to Matthew 15 19. for out of the heart precede evil thoughts murders adulterers fornications thefts fault false witness blasphemies again look at Proverbs 23 7. It lines up perfectly as a man thinketh in his heart and Jesus says here out of the heart proceed as evil so friends if we're always thinking about Sin if we're always thinking about evil thoughts if we're always thinking about crime or whatever it is whatever we're thinking about that's what we are Jesus says this he says these are things which defile a man but to eat with unwashing hands defile not a man so what they were doing there was accusing Jesus there's a there's a scripture that talks about when the the priests would come in to the sanctuary to the Tabernacle there was the lava there there was a big Basin for washing their hands they would wash their hands and then they would go in as a ceremonial washing and clean them and then make their sacrifice and do their Priestly work and it was so ingrained into this this Priestly um what do you call it uh something that they did ritual it became ingrained into the people so then the people started doing this for years and Moses set this in order so it was a long time so then we get down to Jesus's time and they're like hey you didn't wash your hands your your people didn't wash their hands this had become so much practiced and so much talked about but it wasn't even the message it wasn't something that the prophet taught but it was something that had been told over and over and over again but it wasn't actually something that pleased God it was just washing your hands Jesus says this let me read it again he says these are the things which defile a man but to eat with unwashing hands defileth not a man so they were condemning Moses or they were condemning Jesus for something that was just part of their own idea of the message and wasn't even real now for you you young mothers out there I'm not trying to usurp the moms and washing your hands before you eat as a little kids are saying Amen brother Dan foreign the fifth commandment honor thy father and thy mother and I think it was Paul that said that's the first commandment with promise to honor thy father and thy mother you don't wash your hands the promise is you're going to get a whooping but let's go back let's go back to Philippians Philippians chapter 4 verse 9. those things which you have learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the God of Peace shall be with you and I appreciate Paul's example Paul lived such a life that in Acts 19 that he was so pure that in Acts 19 they just took pieces of His Garment and they brought him to the and they distributed them to the people and just those pieces of those garments people got healed from them we call him a prayer cloth it was all the way back to the book of Acts and Paul where Paul they would take from from his garments and give them out and then people would get healed a friend of mine his name's David in in Jeffersonville he was witnessing in a place called I believe it was Salem Indiana and um he he talked to this this lady and he said have you ever heard of this man William Branham and and uh uh she said yes as a matter of fact I have and he says oh really well what do you know he says you know I always like to get stories and I believe his I think he was her it was either a grandmother or her mother I think it was her grandmother she was dying of cancer in the hospital and she was in a room and they had they had a curtain between the two rooms there was there was this lady and then there was another lady here a Christian and she had two friends and her two friends were praying for that she would be healed of cancer so they heard that brother Branham was going to have a meeting in Jeffersonville so they made the trip to Jeffersonville and they went into the service and brother Branham called them out and he says you're praying for your friend he said she has cancer he said take that handkerchief his prayer cloth and tell her to pin it under her garment and believe so they said okay so they take the the prayer cloth and they take it to their friend and and they say hey we went to the meetings and brother Brahm said this and if you take this prayer cloth and you put it under here according to the Bible then we believe you're going to get healed and she got embarrassed and she says well you know I don't really I don't want to do that you know it's kind of weird and they're like no no no no no no no no no he said that he called us out take this prayer cloth and put it on you and she said I don't I don't want to do that it's strange the girl on the other on the other side of the curtain she um if she doesn't want it I'll take it so she took the prayer cloth brother Arnie what do you think happened she lived to be an old lady walk down the hospital another woman died and then giving this testimony the lady told my friend he said she said he was as my mother or my grandmother so yes I do know this ministry we um look at Paul and the way that Paul lived his life um so much so that even he had this this way about him and friends you know what it was it was the Holy Spirit is what it is nothing they were different people Paul was different than Peter but Peter was so full of this love and so full of the spirit that Peter would just walked by someone and just his shadow just the shadow going across they'd be healed it's in the butt that is the kind of men and women these were in the Bible they had they had the spirit verse 10. but rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again wherein you are also careful but you lacked opportunity not that I speak with respect of want I have learned in whatsoever State I am wherewith therewith to be content I know both ought to be a based and I know how to abound everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer look at Paul rejoicing in the situation that he was in in this case he was falsely imprisoned I'll read it really quickly we don't turn the Philippians chapter 1 verse 12 Paul says this he says but I would ye should understand Brethren that the things which happen to me unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the Gospel so that my Bonds in Christ are manifested in all the palace and in other places and many of the brethren in the Lord waxing confident in my bonds are much more bold to speak the word without fear Paul is saying that I'm in prison but it's good this is benefiting the people if I'm in prison then there's others and they're going out and they're preaching and I'm preaching inside the prison look at Paul he wasn't looking at himself he was looking at the furtherance of the Gospel many of you are here um I preached a sermon on a Wednesday night and I preached a sermon on Philemon and um I talked about Philemon and how onesimus he had committed a crime and and he left and Philemon was was the owner his owner he was a slave Philemon it was a good man a Christian onesimus goes and he finds Paul in prison and he says hey I'm going to get crucified I'm going to get in trouble I don't know what to do Paul pins this letter called Philemon and made it into this book pins this letter called Philemon and says take this onesimus take this to Philemon announcements goes and he he takes it there and then I talked in the sermon I talked about the prison ministry and how people can leave the church they can get in trouble but always welcome them back in do you remember does anybody remember that service well what I didn't know when nobody else here knew is about three quarters of the way through the sermon I know brother Arne remembers about three quarters of the way through the sermon there's a man that used to attend this church and I don't know brother Arnie was he imprisoned you know Justin he looked like he was he uh had tattoos up to here and on his face and and uh but but anyways he came in and he heard some of that sermon and then it was Joseph I think it was you I met him outside and you came in the back and you said uh he said brother Daniel there's somebody outside that you need to talk to you remember and he was out there and I looked at him and and he uh he uh he said he's a brother he says I want to be baptized he says I used to attend this church and um I said okay remember brother he's up in the back and and I don't want to just and maybe I'm wrong in this but I don't want to just baptize somebody I want to know why they want to be baptized so I talked with him and I said I said brother I said and I talked about the eunuch and Philip I said that eunuch had to make a testimony that he believes in Jesus Christ and he said brother he says he says I do believe in Jesus Christ I need to be baptized and I said okay well do you want to wait until Sunday he said brother I need to be baptized right now okay so uh sister Shirley I think you were there a bunch of them piled back in to the congregation and when we baptized them up there and I don't know where he went but it was a it was just a tremendous testimony that he was listening there's somebody always listening to us I want to give a plug to brother Arnie back there you know brother Arnie is a good man been around the message for a long time I really believe brother Arnie has a calling and a gift to these people that come in you know I've listened to him I've stood next to him and I've listened to him talk to these people and he knows what to say he doesn't back down pat him on the back but he knows what to say it's a gift it's a it's a position in the church that's needed and I love I love it when I see a gift operate that's the brother Arnie I know you've got many other gifts but it's that's it's tremendous to me to see that one in operation where was I at um verse 12 right okay um I don't have time uh verse 13. I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me what a statement Paul here is he's saying he's saying all of these things that we have need of God can do there's a there's a a young lady she's in her mid-30s that um I I go to this gym she's the manager of the gym and she came up to me she had heard me witnessing to other people and I go there and I don't even work out I just preach basically so I I get on the treadmill and somebody will come in and and we'll talk about whatever um it's an honor and I'm thankful I get to do it well anyways she came up and she says uh my daughter her name's Olivia seven years old she's got chronic kidney disease she's too young for a transplant she's on dialysis and she says um she says you know you're a minister obviously she says I always listen to your conversations she says would you pray for my daughter I said of course and um she said just just pray that uh you know my husband and I can make the right decisions and and um we had this we had this talk and about making the right decisions and I said I said let me read to you I said are you a Christian she says yes I said Do you believe the Bible she says yes I said Do you believe Jesus Christ she says yes I said let me read you something that he wrote that he said and I grabbed my phone and I turned I'll do it right now I can quote it by heart but um turn to Mark chapter 16. and I said let me tell you what he wrote and I said I said you know what it is when the letters are in red right she said yes I said that's the Lord talking and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth in is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover she said I've never been taught that I said well Jesus taught it she said she said well she said does that happen today I said let me give you a testimony I said I said when I was in the ministry back east there was a man that lived in England and he jumped he was diagnosed with Hepatitis he was a nurse so he couldn't perform his nursing job and he was going to get laid off because of the disease and you have family to support it's Congolese by birth I believe so he gets on a flight and he flies to Louisville and he shows up and he says I came here to be prayed for I have hepatitis and he says it's it's bad and I said well brother do you believe do you believe that God can heal and I told this this girl I said I read that same scripture to him that I read to you and um he said yes so I brought him into the chapel laid hands on him and we prayed and then he said can I stay for a little while longer and and he stayed I said sure I left and he stayed in the chapel and there's a there's a little altar like this where you can kneel down and he stayed there praying he made that whole trip from England to be prayed for so after a while the receptionist at the front I called down she said well he just left so he left went back home to England and I got an email and it showed me his hepatitis test before he left and then it showed me his hepatitis test when he got back negative no hepatitis and she said this girl named Loretto she said that happened she's like a chills she said that actually happened I said I saw it I was there Jesus healed this man she said you lay hands on him of course with what Jesus said I said yes it works it's alive today and it's real she said I gotta bring my daughter you got to lay hands on her I said bring her in we'll do it that just happened like two days ago let me tell you something I believe with all of my heart that God will heal that little girl why not why would I not believe that I believe it you watch one day she might give a little testimony up here just like this little guy did notwithstanding you have done well that you did communicate with my Affliction now you Philippians know also that in the beginning of the Gospel when I departed from Macedonia no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving but you only how Paul appreciated somebody thinking about it for even in thessalonica ye sent once and again to my necessity not because I desire a gift but I desire fruit that may abound to your account but I have all and abound I am full having received of epaphroditus the things which were sent from you and odor of sweet smell a sacrifice acceptable well-pleasing to God have you ever received a card or text from somebody that sin just you know just thinking about you just appreciate you doesn't that feel good that's exactly what Paul had here he says oh somebody cares about me that's how this is this scripture is think on these things that's what we need to do as Christians think about others you know I think about um think about uh think about my father-in-law Rod you know everybody knew rod you know Rod you know he's he's just a good guy he loved the baseball game and a hot dog you know he was he was just precious good friend good man but um Stephanie was talking with somebody one um not too long ago and she said I heard that your dad passed away and she said it made me sad she said because gave the impression that why he cared about me he thought about me and I thought Rod Carroll I thought what a man how many people were at his funeral this place was packed because of this man Rod this man of God and we think of you know this is how somebody should be or this is how somebody else should be look at the impression that this man made on all of these people Stephanie how many testimonies did we get from your dad saying how much they loved him I want that testimony and I want to I want people to say you know what brother Daniel cared about me brother Daniel thought about me and when when Stephanie told me that you know I thought God bless that man you know he's he he was he was a great man because of how he made others feel because he cared I am I gotta close I'm getting I'm getting to the end but um I was thinking about I used to ride my bike around the Jeffersonville area and I'd look for testimonies and miracles because that area of the country there were in the 50s and 60s there were more miracles there than there were anywhere else in the world so I get on my bike and I I'd ride and I'd look for old people sitting on their porch well I I rode up to um to this convenience store and it wasn't like a chain it was just a uh just a like a mom-and-pop shop and uh I went in and there was this old black man with this trucker hat on and I said um I said you ever hear a man named William Branham I'm doing some research on it and he said yes I do he had a uh his hat was a like a Teamsters hat he says yes I do and I said well tell me about him he said he cared for me he said when I was a little kid he said the blacks and the whites they were separate he says he says the whites they would never have have been seen with young with a little black kid in their car he said William Branham he said he always had to nicest car he said it was shined up and it was nice he said he would drive and he would pick me up and drive me to school and he said I thought I was big stuff getting out of that car made that impression on this this man made that impression so far to where as an old man he still remembers how much this man meant to him hey uh let's continue on with Philippians let me uh let me read a let me read the quote here on door to the heart brother Branham says this now if a man is a great man when you talk to him he will make you think that you are the great one but you take a man that just thinks he's somebody he tries to blow himself up all the time he's a when he's nobody just give him a change of clothes and he's a changed person but a real big man makes himself small that shows that the god of Heaven made himself a foot washer to mankind the Way Up Is Down he that humbles himself shall be exalted that's what the matter what's the matter with people today we don't want to accept that humility of the Gospel we want to think that we're just a little bit too good we know a little more than someone else Philippians 4 9 4 18 419 says this Paul closes his letter to the Philippians he says but my God shall supply all your needs according to his riches and Glory by Christ Jesus now unto God and our father be glory forever and ever amen salute every saint in Christ Jesus the brethren which are with me greet you and the Saints Salute You chiefly they the house of see they that are of Caesar's household the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all friends this book of Philippians this last chapter the sweetness of the Apostle how beautiful sisters are going to come up how sweet he was and we think of a Christian we think of all these great things and we should have miracles and we see Miracles and we should have more the door should be they should be be lined up at the doors to try to get into this church to be healed to be a part to be loved they should be they should be wanting to come in here when we go out when we go out somewhere if we go to the store you know as I said the things that come out your mouth the thoughts that you have are who you are when you go to the store and you talk to someone do you get angry at them if they do something wrong the waitress or the waiter at at the at the restaurant or whatever it is when you leave that place it should leave a spirit it should leave a spirit that says there was something special about her there was something special about him I want to be like that person when you're driving in your car and you're going around don't forget you're a Christian in your car too it doesn't change when you get in when you get behind the wheel when you're in there and you're driving you're still a Christian back off be a Christian let the guy in you know when we're wherever we are whatever we say whatever we do you'll find that a little bit of love will heal so many things it will I've seen it I've seen Miracles as I talked about the brother from England I've seen many many I could stay up here all night talking about the Miracles I've seen but the greatest of these things and where these Miracles come from is [Music] it comes from people that care don't forget to reach out reach out to these people that are around you might like Paul said he said you know you thought about me and it makes me feel good just that you thought about me it doesn't have to be people in this church it should be too but it can be also people outside people that you work with how do your neighbors feel about you are they saying these people that live next to me those are Christians [Music] that's who I want praying for me if I get sick that's how we should be in every aspect of Our Lives friends with me can we try harder love you'll find that when when you display that love it makes everything better it makes everything just happier you know as Jesus said and we always read in the communion service Jesus said if you do these things happy are you and we will be happier and let's continue on let's continue on in that love knowing that our lord Jesus is guiding our steps that they as they did with Peter and Paul and all the disciples display that love display to each other explain it to everybody you're around no matter how much people do you wrong how angry you get at them overcoming it's not worth your salvation and let me tell you something you can win that soul that's how you do it it's not in believe me it's not in how well you know this book and how well you know the author it was I'll close with this I was preaching last weekend in New Mexico and these two parents they have a daughter she's I don't know she's probably 17 16 17 years old and they came to me after service and they said brother this service really meant a lot to our daughter she really needed it she said she said this was the best service I've ever been in and I said okay good and and she said just both the the mom she had tears in her eyes and the dad they said thank you and uh okay I said what'd I say [Music] you know a little bit of validation brother Tim but they said well after service they said when now in the Hispanic culture at church what they do is the people when they leave the first person out will stand at the door and then shake the next person's hand and then that person will go and stand next to that person and then the next person will shake this person's hand this person's hand and then that person will get over here so that way you shake everybody's hand in church and when I was going out I was shaking hands and I get to the young lady and she was so attentive and I said sister I just want to thank you for for listening so closely to my message it really helps me when people when people do that and the mom said when you told her that that's what meant so much to her that you cared but that's not what we say I mean we should do our best but if we can just display that love amen let's let's do it let's uh let's all stand brethren sisters brother Eddie would you come up and close in prayer my friend [Music] brother Eddie's he's got a sweetness to him I appreciate him so much it's been so nice getting to getting to meet him he's a minister [Music] let's pray Our Father we thank you one more time lord for giving you the privilege of being here in your house thank you for the message and I pray Lord that the message penetrates our hearts our minds so that we can become strong Christians and become a strong Church believing in you that only you can do things in our lives you can change us to become great Christians I pray Lord that you dismisses with your blessings take us to our homes may we live our lift up your word in our hearts yes amen we ask you Lord that you bless us in Jesus name I pray amen thank you my brother God bless you well Jordan if you come and close [Music] friends I I can read the book of of [Music] um I forgot what book I was in yeah guys are thinking about the Lord book of Philippians and uh you know the love of God just resonates throughout this whole book you know it resonates from Genesis how how God created his his children and then it goes through when he gave his son Jesus Christ it was just pure love I believe is one of the prophets it was one of the New Testament prophets that said God is love and he is friends I love you all and I'm proud I'm proud that we have a message proud that we have word I'm proud that we have what we have and I don't want to I want to live up to it I want to do a good job I want to like like when when the sister came up this morning she was we might think of it was a little thing I want to get rid of all the little things too because Jesus is coming you know this world is about it's about to go into destruction foreign so let's do it Jesus said you are the light of the world and you
