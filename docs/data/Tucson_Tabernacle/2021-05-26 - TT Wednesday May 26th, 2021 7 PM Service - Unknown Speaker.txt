servant's place of grace [Music] such love such wondrous [Music] no greater love that a man has that he would lay down his life for his friends and that he would call us his friends appreciate that it was a scripture in my heart and i didn't know to read it tonight but after that song i think we should malachi chapter 3 verse 16. and i was going through that whole chapter but it started with malachi 3 16 so let's just look at that for a moment then they that feared the lord spaked often one to another and the lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the lord and that thought upon his name i just i just kept reading it over and over and i said what is our conversation what are our thoughts what are we thinking about and to think that that such love that god would love a sinner such as i how i ought to think about him how i ought to think about those he has redeemed those that he shed his blood for and then he says in a book of remembrance you know what did he say have you considered my servant job you know and he looks upon his children and he says the same thing have you considered my children i love them so i appreciate his grace and mercy good to know the lord these days when all that is happening and even better is to be known of god and he knows your name just a couple of things to bring to your attention [Music] i know it's a three-day weekend coming up and some folks are going to be out of town so if those that are traveling and i'll be out of town lord be with you keep you safe safe trip and time and enjoy your time off we'll meet here sunday and see what god has for us just um tonight we're going to listen to the message who is this preaching 59 brother branham back in jeffersonville and it's just a reminder as go as brother i'm a part of that that tape talks about things that god has done and made me think of of this god who's still alive never changes he's the same yesterday today and forever and he still does and act the same way if you if you could take him at his word brother brahm says that's how you know it's god because he keeps his word you know so my daughter rachel was getting over a cold so she wasn't here tonight she was feeling better and then my daughter abby said that asher and chloe had kind of been going through a little bit of cold and they were a little congested so remember them and then my father because of the covet vaccines they took he was not allowed to take the shot for the pain in his leg for well over a month so it was really bothering him and today they were they were able to to do that but the doctor said for him to rest a day or two on that so he was feeling much better so but a testimony with that um as you know sarah my daughter she goes to dialysis three times a week and recently they had not been able to go and do a full dialysis run so the fluid begins to build up over time and she was beginning to carry a lot of fluid and she said it begins to press up on her lungs makes it hard to breathe you lay down and the water fills all the vacant cavities and their lungs don't want to work and so she asked us this would have been um monday night she came into the room with me and mom said would you have prayed for me i have not been able to have a full run and so we just prayed a simple prayer lord you know this just for a few moments and you know of course dad and mom are touched by the feeling of the infirmities and we know god is the same way so yesterday she came over for dinner and she was quite happy she said i had a full run they were able to take off all the liquid and for those of us who don't have the problem we might not understand that but when someone is going through a hard time suffering let us let us love one another let us pray for one another let us feel for one another so just appreciate that god is mindful of us so how many knows he's mindful of you he's proved himself over and over and over so i feel stan as we get ready to hear this since about 65 minutes long but brother brown really speaking of who is this that we're talking about it's the lord jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever but he talks about some things there that just just encouraged my heart and so we'll hear that but i was going to sing this song god still moves but we'll maybe we'll send that to him let's just at the end of the service and we'll sing only believe all things are possible he's still the same yesterday today and forever he meets the needs he does things you know he does not sleep he does not slumber he's not on a eight to four you know today i i was i they send me up to casa grande and sometimes phoenix on tuesdays and thursdays to help out and this afternoon they still hadn't sent me my schedule and i called the office and the girl that does that was off today the other girl had gone home so they passed me on to somebody else who wasn't answering their phone they finally gave me to the head of the department and she's just recently moved to arizona she doesn't she said is casagrand the name of a job she had no idea it was a city between tucson and phoenix and so she apologized to me that nobody had taken care of that and she said no there's no work up here tomorrow you just stay home but it's already four o'clock in the afternoon and i'm trying to prepare for tomorrow i'm glad god does not work that way but he's already seen he's already taken a care he's already provided how many knows that in your life so only believe all things are possible [Music] all things are possible [Music] oh [Music] i confess lord i believe lord i believe lord i believe all things lord i believe [Music] god bless you as you're seated as we listen to this thank you it's so nice to get to come to the house of the lord i think that i was studying some scripture some time ago and it said that when jesus drew near unto jerusalem that the disciples lifted up their eyes and they saw the holy city in a distance and they begin to rejoice and to say that now will the kingdom be restored and this certain man that was telling or talking about a recent visit to palestine and he said that people now in the last year has been coming to a place that when they come up from the valley and look around the vin the same road that jesus and the disciples were on at that time that when they see the city they start to weep you know i believe there was something those disciples in those days felt that that the kingdom would be restored again and now it's almost time i believe that's the feeling it's on the people that the kingdom is almost ready to be restored again brother neville our gracious and blessed pastor just spoke to me about an oncoming uh revival effort here at the tabernacle in a few nights to be praying about it and i told him i thought it would be a blessed thing you just can't have too many revivals and many times we get the wrong opinion of a revival a revival isn't so much as to bring in new members but it's to revive that which we already have amen and i'm i like to say this because i say it from the depths of my heart i begin to find a different feeling around the tabernacle and what has been for a long time a feeling of of a deep spiritual sense like that it used to be long time ago that something that settles and it's got a real foundation and i trust that god will bless this little church amen again in its power and i see the building program going on and i think that's a great thing for sooner or later we older people are going to take off the armor and hand it back into the hands of our children and walk up that golden stairway the other day i passed that halfway mark now of 50 years old i just can't realize that don't seem like it's hauling groceries for chris meisner about 18 16 18 years old but just went somewhere it just goes to show that here we have no continuing city but we're seeking one to come and that's the city where god is builder and there will never be no end there this morning as i was speaking on the subject of mother's day and trying to place mother not as she really is in the old age with the wrinkles and all this her crutches are an old wheelchair arm chair a little pot of flowers setting by her but mother in the resurrection restored back to her youth and standing shining as a queen that's the way i like to think of my mother i don't like to think of her as she is today old i like to think of what's coming i know you feel that way about your mothers think of her as she really is in her heart though many as this poet says life has not been easy for her but she'll live it all over again just to do something for you amen so god's going to make it a way so she can live forever with you so i'm glad of that i don't know why i made this announcement this morning that i would speak tonight if the lord willing on who is this certainly don't know how i'm going to do it but i've been busy up to about hour and 10 minutes to go on interviews all afternoon and had specials and and emergency calls and couldn't make them i want you to continue to pray for dr sammy he's coming along fine and we're thankful and dr baldwin and ms baldwin are both recovering they're getting along fine now i want you to put a new one on your prayer list this afternoon that's harry leis down here the druggers harry's a personal friend of mine and as long as i've known him i thought he was a christian until this afternoon when his brother made requests for the salvation of his soul brother mike egan brought the our trustee here brought the news and harry is in a serious condition out at the hospital i didn't know he thought that much of me but he turned his own pastor down this afternoon the path to the church where he goes and wanted me to come see him and i want to go see him so pray for herring we're glad here tonight to recognize as my friend chair from down in georgia brother welch evans and his family i see also other visitors that i didn't know them probably was here this morning if i'm not mistaken i see brother sister elmer collins back there from phoenix arizona oh you haven't changed looked like you're to have on your railroad clothes and and uh coming in from the track and uh welcome back home and i can't ask you to stay here because you found a place better that's very fine phoenix like to live there someday myself and then i see brother smith you're the church of god out there brother smith that was giving me your little book the other day or yesterday afternoon late i haven't read it yet but i certainly will endorse it as long as i know you wrote it it's got to be a real true scripture god bless you and i hope it's a success and many others i could say you're all welcome here at the tabernacle and i enjoyed that song this morning of sister stricker that saying he's looking through the lattice at her my mennonite brother here glad to have them in and all of you a friend here i believe from over in illinois and his son's taking recordings in the bank get to meet them again and so many i might don't think i'm psyched if i don't call your name but i just welcome you all now let us read tonight for a scripture lesson out of matthew the 21st chapter beginning at the first verse in reading down in 11th inclusive and when they drew now unto jerusalem there came and came to bed unto the mount of olive then sent jesus to disciples saying unto them go into the village over against you straightway you shall find an ass tied in a cult with her loose them and bring them to me and if any man say ought unto you ye shall say the lord has need of them and straightway he will send them all this was done that it might be fulfilled which is spoken by the prophets saying tell the daughters of sign behold thy king cometh in meekness setting upon the ass and a colt the full of an ass and the disciples went and did as jesus commanded them and brought the ass and the coat and put on them their clothes and they set him there on and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way and cut down branches from the trees and strolled them in the way and the multitude that went before and that followed cried saying hosanna to the son of david blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highs and when he was come into jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this and the multitude said this is jesus the prophet of nazareth let us bow our heads for prayer oh lord we wondered just what we would have said if we lived in those days but we are living in a greater day when we are looking for him to come and as we are making preparation lord getting our hearts prepared and bringing in all the sheaves that we can gather from the harvest fields both at home and abroad we are thinking and and anticipating on the time that we shall see him coming riding on a white horse coming down from the portals of glory to change and fashion this old corrupted bodies of ours into a glorious body like unto his own where there can be no sin or no sign of death ever entered and we shall see him as he is and live and love him throughout all ages that is to come we thank thee farthest church and for its pastor and for the trustees and the deacons and for every person that comes here and for the visitors that's in our gates that sheep are the same foe but from another crowd we would ask that you would bless them tonight with your presence and feed us on thy word amen that we might go from here tonight with the determination to be better christians than we have ever been may we go with the new hope in our heart and with joy waiting for his coming if by chance there would be some among us who are sick and afflicted we will not forget to pray for them that they coming into the building tonight where we have gathered for the worship coming in sick may they go out well and we would ask for those that are convalescents in the homes and the hospitals and are on the beds of affliction we pray o god that your mercy will reach down to them we would pray for those that are indifferent tonight amen that has not yet tasted and seen the lord is good that doesn't know what it means to be loved by god they just don't understand what they are missing oh god made some radio broadcaster some way touch their hearts and their emotions may be turned to thee before the door of mercy be closed and they be shut out to stand the judgments without mercy help us lord these things we pray in the name of the lord jesus and for his glory we asked it amen the people were so crowded around the gates and the streets were jammed and there was not even room for people to sleep they were laying outside the wall all over the grounds because this was the passover and people come from all over the known world to worship at this time it was a time when the paschal lamb was slain and the uh it represented their deliverance out of egypt the bondage and they kept this annually every year this great passover took place it was one of the most outstanding times of the are events of the jewish religion because it meant the time they were delivered all people love to think of that the time they were delivered how that each of us tonight can go back to the time when we were delivered what it meant to us i can remember in my own experience how my poor boy's heart craved to touch god i thought oh if i could only go up and knock on his door and talk to him a little while and of course you know my story i got me a paper in pencil and was gonna write him a letter cause i couldn't talk to him and i know that he lived in the woods because i had heard him not seen his moving in the woods and i a certain old familiar path that i used to go down when it would be hunting or going fishing i thought i'll just tack it on the tree and address it to mr jesus just some way so that that burden could be from my heart amen oh that night down yondu i might forget my age i might even forget my name sometime but i could never forget that hour when he delivered me from sin something took place down inside me that it's helped me through the great hours of darkness the hour of my deliverance the weights of sin left me and i was a new person i'd been the new creature in christ jesus ever since and these jews they come up each year and there was a fountain inside the church and they've taken the the bread and the bitter herbs and the lamb and they drink from this fountain in the church and they rejoice together because that god had showed them favor so this being the passover time and not only was it the passover but it was a special passover you know there's sometimes that we go to church and we always love to go but there's sometimes that something special happens and this was one of those times the air was charged with expectancy just as it is today all the eyes of those who loved him was watching for him to come into the gate and i believe it's a great deal that way today for those who love him are looking for him the air is charged with expectancy when we are living in this day when the earth is actually has become one great powder keg and science is telling us it's just three minutes until midnight and i'm sure you was reading as i the other day that story of this general and the army said that if there was another war it would only last just two or three minutes the old days of battling and shooting rifles and digging foxholes that's all over they claim the next war will be just two or three minutes someday some topsy-turvy person's gonna blow his lid off and fire one of those bombs and when they do we've got listening posts everywhere to fart right back again the world just can't survive that everyone at the passover knew something was going to happen but they didn't know just what it was and that's the way it is today most everyone knows that something's fixing to happen everyone knows that you can talk to the center you can talk to the merchant you can talk to anyone and oh it's such an unresting time for the world but you can talk to a man or a woman that's looking for him coming and the glory is on their face shining out they're watching for that great event so the whole air is charged again expecting something to happen the world doesn't know what's fixed to happen but the church of the living god knows what's going to happen they know that soon the trumpet will sound and we'll see him come riding out of glory on a white horse now armies of heaven following him and those that are dead in christ will be raptured and tucked up to medium in the air that's what we are looking for we're longing for it and we're told that the souls of those mothers and so forth we spoke of this morning just under the altar of god are screaming how long lord how long mother wants to see you as much as you want to see her and our loved ones wants to meet us as well as we want to meet them what a reunion that'll be when he comes to meet our loved ones and see them in their resurrection body and glorified and walking around with the air of the resurrection amen amen watching their character how it's changed the meekness and quietness and it won't be a hustling bustle and jumping jerk but we'll have all eternity to live together all this great neurotic age that we're living just not no time for nothing just climbing and jerking and grabbing why it's a terrible day damn as they waited for something to happen it was too bad those at the passover never got to see him yet they know something was going to happen but yet they didn't get to see him so would be at the coming of the lord there's many restless people today that knows that something's fixing to happen but they they'll never see him for he will come in the stillness of the midnight to catch away that little church amen that's longing waiting and expecting to see him that's the ones he'll come and catch away many of the world who is living on the glamors and the feasting their souls upon the things of the world will never know what happened until the church has gone into glory for he will come as a thief in the night and catch them away so we can see we're back again to the same place now we find out that this expectations that god comes to those who all through the scriptures it's been the same thing that they are he always appears to those who are expecting him always to those who are wanting to see him and i'm sure that that's the hope that's on our hearts tonight it's been about six months ago i suppose i was testifying to some people and i said oh to think of it but just most any time he'll come what caused me to say that i was speaking of brother bosworth when i went to see that old saint when we heard he was dying 80 something years old the wife and i are going down to there to see him before he died i just had to say something to him i like to watch saints when they're entering glory and i had to see him and we burnt the tires off of the car but when i got there and rushed into the door in a little corner laid that old patriarch he raised his head up when he see me coming his old feeble arms hung out with the flesh hanging down and he reached his arms for me and i grabbed him around the neck and screamed my father my father the chariots of israel and the horsemen thereof for he was a sainted godly man and i said brother bynesworth i want to ask you something do you believe that you'll get well he said oh i'm not even sick i said well what's the matter he said i'm going home amen he said i'm tired and i'm wore out and i just want to go home i said then you realize you're dying i said i want to ask you something back down through the 70 some odd years of ministry what has been your most glorious myth could you speak to me sir and tell me what experience do you had down along the line that you could count your greatest hour i shall live to see his age i'll never forget as those dark eyes caught me over the top of those glasses he said my dear brother this is the greatest moment of my life i can't think of any time there was any more glorious than right now i looked him in the face and i said sir do you still know that you're dying he said brother branham i'm laying here waiting every minute for him to open that door and come take me home with him amen that's the way to die that's the way to go and as you know that about two hours before he died he was been laying in a coma for over two days and when he come to himself he raised up in the room and began to speak to his wife then all of a sudden he seemed to be transparent and he was shook hands for a solid hour or more with friends who's been dead for 40 or 50 years who was his converts in his church chuck camp with his mother with his daddy until he was life was left his body laid down on the pillow and went to sleep in the arms of the lord jesus amen there is nothing like serving him expecting him and as i talked to this man about this and told that experience i said this i said sir oh won't it be glorious when we see him or if he would come today he said brother branham don't scare the people like that i said what do you mean he said oh don't try to tell people that the world's coming or christ is coming it worries them oh i said no i beg your pardon to those who aren't looking for him it's the most glorious news that they can hear that jesus is just about to break to and to take his church hallelujah old age will be changed for youth joy will be given instead of gloom life will be given instead of death immortality for morality be exchanged oh what a moment to know that he shall come amen they were looking for him they were expecting him and when he come we found that there was two factions one group was far in and one was against him and that's the way we find it today that's what his coming always has divided the peoples every time when you find jesus you find those around who would be contrary with it that's satan and today when we think of it we don't see much change just the same the people's has changed but the spirit of people hasn't changed so when they finally looked out the gate and saw him come riding on that little white donkey no one of the disciples begin to scream the kingdom of heaven has come the people run to meet him and all jerusalem stared there's something about it when jesus comes it's always a stirring and the whole city was stirred and they they can't hide it and the preachers of that day had to give an account for this stir because it was at the feast of the passover and they screamed up who is this when the air charged and the coming of the lord jesus to jerusalem had charged the air with expectations it looks like that the teachers ought to know what was going to take place it looked like that the high priest would have noted it looked like that all the other priests would have known and it isn't changed any today because the holy spirit is forerunning the coming of the lord jesus and as the holy spirit begins to stretch out across the earth revival fires are broken out everywhere great signs and wonders has been done healings has taken place prophecies has went forth all the gathering of the apostolic blessings has come back to the church again so as it was then so is that now the spirit of the unbeliever still cries out who is this some of them believed on the lord jesus to say he was a good man some of them said he's a good man that's what they say today they try to place him as a napoleon a warrior they try to place him as a george washington a truthful man but he was more than that did you notice the reading of the scripture they said this is a prophet that comes from galilee and they tried to say the same thing today when they see this great move of the lord to restore back to hell the sick and the afflicted to see him use his spirit in his church to discern the thoughts of the people to see him do just as he did when he was here on earth to fulfill what he said would take place certainly the churches and the people as asking this who is this they didn't understand who jesus was because none of them could recognize him by their schools what seminary did he come out of what school of theology did he come from and so is it today most of the people who are anointed with the holy ghost didn't come from any seminary they are products of god's own choosing but the signs and the miracles and the wonders that was promised of the bible accompany this great holy spirit as it moves among the people and they say today what school are they from just as soon as you enter a city to hold a revival what denomination do you belong to i had an interview friday afternoon with the the roman catholic priest from the irish church in louisville i know more than i had been introduced to him a fine scholarly man he said mr branham what denomination are you with i said i'm not with annie and he said then where you ordained i said yes sir he said who ordained you i said the lord jesus gave me the holy spirit to preach the gospel and gave me a commission amen well that's the ordination that we need jesus never said to his disciples go out to the i'm not criticizing those things but they've lived their day he didn't say go study to be a minister for so many years he said tarry he in the city of jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high he said that to man who couldn't sign their own name and after this the holy ghost has come upon you then you shall be my witnesses both in jerusalem judea samira and to the utmost parts of the earth that's the ordination we have no record of jesus ever going to any school or graduating from any seminaries yet there's been more seminaries erected in his name for religious causes and then for any other any other thing that's ever been in the world we never had each any record of him ever going to school but yet there's been more schools erected in his name than there is of any other kind of a name there is under the heavens the schools we never have noticed him right in the book yet there's been more books wrote about him in all the rest of the literature's been written today his bible is the most popular book that there is in all the world amongst all the literature but you see in the day of the visitation they cried who is he see god takes something it seems like it's nothing to make something out of it that's what makes him god and when they seen him come riding into that gate some of them said he's a great man they say that today there are schools of theology that teaches today that jesus was a great man that he was a good man some of them even say that he was a prophet now if he was only a prophet or a good man we're in our sins he was more than a prophet he was more than a good man yet he was a good man yet he was a god prophet but he was more than that he was god manifested in the flesh to take away sin and as he come riding in lots of the people said he's a healer always seen him open the eyes of the blind we seen him make the crippled man to walk we seen him all for prayer and a fever left a child but then those type were only following him for the loaves and the fishes and that's the way the crowds are today many if there's a healer while they they follow him and it's just it's just an always if they get sick they run say oh will you please pray for me that the lord jesus will make me well and as soon as they come out of the hospital or the sick bed right back out into the world they go like a dog to its vomit aura hog to its water as the scripture says just follow him for what good they can get out of him they use him just for a a totem pole or or something that that they can get from him and don't expect to serve him that crowd still goes on today there were nine lepers healed and one returned to give him praise or was it 10. they one of them returned to give him praise and the rest of them went ahead ungrateful and if the people in america has been healed by the power of god turn their hearts to god there'd be a revival strike this nation that would close every bootleg joint that would package stores and whiskey stores to be put out of the picture the churches would be full of theaters to be empty on sunday night and there'd be a revival break out to this nation but when they see it happen the things that god does they still scream who is he who is this that comes where do they come from who is this but what authority is this done never forget at johannesburg south africa i just arrived about 30 minutes before on a plane i've been three days and nights in the air so tired i could hardly stand it they take me out to the fairgrounds where some 50 or 60 000 people were gathered no sooner than god on the platform to the holy spirit i seen coming across the place a a bus and it was had a sign on it durbin i saw a young man had to fuss and slip away from his father and mother with one leg six or eight inches shorter than the other he was wearing a white shirt with suppenders holding up his trousers and i noticed a young man i look back again the vision was gone and then just in a moment i saw that light hanging over a young man way back in the audience and i looked i thought i was seeing him somewhere and i watched him in that light kept holding over him for a few minutes and i was waiting for the interpreter to catch the next words then i seen that same young man stand up throw down his crutches on his six inches short leg came down normal with the rest and i said to mr aj skooman who is in glory tonight i said mr schumann just quote my words it's a vision he said very well and i said the young man setting back there with the white shirt on his suppenders he came from a city called durbin some 1500 miles across the country in a bus and he had to slip away from his father and mother to come but he's believed on the lord jesus and he's got one leg six inches shorter than the other and the young man jumped up there he's standing trying to feel for his crutches and i said young man the lord jesus has healed you and immediately his leg come out six inches to the normal with the rest of them and they brought the young man to the platform and doctors examined him there you see his picture in my book i'd been standing there just a few moments i seen a little green car running down the road in the sip it turned around backward and struck a tree a young blond-headed girl was had a broken back and i said i see a little green car that slid into a tree and a young blonde headed girl of about 18 years old has a broken back she's in a serious condition no one responded i couldn't see her anywhere in that vast big audience of people and i stood there just for a few minutes i said understand it's don't be suspicious it's the lord jesus in the power of the resurrection he sent the holy ghost to continue his work amen and there i seen the vision happen over again and i couldn't see the young woman just then standing right in front of me here stood that light as you see on the picture and the studio and i walked up there and there she laid down below the platform i said young lady the lord jesus has made you well and she started to cry her mother said oh no don't tell her to get up says if she moves she'll die and the young lady jumped to her feet screaming and praising god and the mother faded and fell in the cup that the girl was laying in amen what is it just about that time some critical man raised up back there and stood with one foot on one seat and one on the other and said you american i challenge you to tell me what name you do this in and what denomination church do you belong to see it's just the same they don't understand they're not looking for these things the churches are not looking for the coming of the lord and the holy spirit is sure to confirm his coming to bring it to pass so much each one wants to take his own way that's the way it was there each group had their own idea but that's not the question tonight that's not what i'm talking about amen but the question i'm asking you is what do you think it is it concerns you who is this that's going up and down the nations not man man cannot do those things who is it that's speaking and saying to the people in the audience uh sitting right here over here in different places in the meeting when women and man are brought in here dying who is it that young woman that walked into the baptist this morning that three weeks ago dying with sarcomas cancer lives right here on maple street mrs beatty and i asked three doctors that was with her she didn't have one chance to live with four or five little children in my mother trying to take care of them mama said bill she'll never come home again and i went out to where she was and the lord jesus spoke thus saith the lord if she will go to the church and promise to be baptized into the name of the lord jesus and will serve god she'll go home amen well and i asked her will you do this lady and she said all that you say i'll do it how immediate are the pains left three days later she was home and the doctors can't find one trace of that cancer who is this that cometh in the name of the lord who is it it's the holy spirit of god what's your opinion of it what's your opinion knowing your pastor everyone setting in these seat chair people from out of town setting with epilepsy sitting with here sets a man somewhere in here a mennonite brother right here a supper of epilepsy never knew seen him nothing about him and all of a sudden about two years ago i guess or something in two years the holy spirit called it and said dust saith the lord amen he's never had a spell since who is it who is that this woman was sitting here last sunday the last time i was here had come down from somewhere illinois the next day with a great tumor in her body that was malignant and some of the best medical science of illinois was taken her to a great clinic to be operated on monday and she squeezed her way in never seen or heard of her in all my life and all of a sudden the holy spirit shattered her and it told her who she was where she come from and she was going to be operated the next day how many were sure then to see that see the news flow back the next day when she went to the doctor they'd taken her from clinic to clinic and can't find the trace of it who is this oh god be merciful who is this that's doing this could you dare to say it was your pastor never could you dare to say man had anything to do into it never it's the holy spirit the spirit that was on our lord jesus and he's coming to unite himself with his church is so close that he's spreading forth his great holy light to redeem and to bring into fellowship a church of the living god for the rapture that's near at hand amen who is it i can't answer your question i can't answer for you but i can answer for myself and over this sacred destiny in the ears of this the company and the the purchase of the blood of our lord jesus i say this from the bottom of my heart not because i'm one of you not because i'm just somebody different but one of the redeemed that's washed by the blood i believe that that same light that hangs in this church tonight that same one shows by its nature that it's jesus christ in the form of the holy ghost amen anyone who knows the scripture knows that jesus said i come from god and i go to god amen before he was made flesh with moses in the wilderness he was a pillar of fire and when moses desired to see me pass his back parts to him and moses said it looks like a man when he was shared on earth he was a man he'd done the very same things that he's doing today through man that he has redeemed that he comes and have his picture taken what is it after his death burial and resurrection paul was on his road to damascus one day and a great light struck him down those men around him didn't see the light but it struck paul down to made him blind he had trouble with his eyes the rest of his life and he said one time except i should be exalted above the abundance of the revelation there was given to me a thorn in his flesh a messenger of satan to benefit him because it was the abundance of the revelation and when paul was stricken down on his road to persecute the people that were making too much noise the born-again group the people that were called heretics paul was on his road to persecute those with papers in his pocket to arrest them and bring him to jerusalem and about middle of the day there come a light down that struck him off of his feet to the ground and he fell into the dust of the earth there come a voice in that light saying saul saul why persecutest thou me and saul turned over the blinding condition looked up and they could see that great glorious light and he said lord who are you he said i'm jesus i came from god i went to god i come from god i returned to god and he said it's hard for you to kick against the prince one revelation on that sacred sand one time upon that place man can never be the same amen a man before he should call himself a christian before he can identify himself he should first have that back side of the desert experience where he met god face to face for today you can have any kind of an answer you can see the lord perform just exactly what he said do and smart theologians will explain it away they'll say that was for another day it was for this or it's for another age it's wrong like they said of jesus he's beelzebub the devil he's a fortune teller and all those things they haven't answered but when a man has ever come in contact with christ and seen him as paul did or experienced him there's not enough theologians in the world to ever be able to explain that experience away from a man that's the reason today they don't have the experience that's the reason they can't say they're all saying who is this what is this where does it come from they don't have the answer why because all they know is a theology that some church is made not to know theology is life not to know the bible is life but to know him is life to know him as your personal savior as the one who has filled you with his presence you were there when it happened there's nobody can take it away from you there's no one can explain it away from you when that experience happens to you you know who he is to me he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever who is this is performing these miracles who is it that's doing these great works this is the preacher is it oral roberts is it billy graham is it jack schuler william branham whoever it may be they have nothing to do into their instruments it's the holy spirit coming forth with the gospel and signs and wonders and miracles to make ready a people that heirs charged with expectations with believers expecting him to come and others are saying why are these revivals why do we have it let's settle down to a church what's been said in the church right here that when we start to build a new church say we don't need miracles we don't need these things anymore you want them going out on field where they're having we don't need them here when the branham tabernacle stoops to that low place it's sunk this church is founded upon the principles and the power and the gospel of jesus christ as long as this tabernacle stands may the glorious holy spirit find access to souls to save and fill with the holy ghost and heal the sick amen to me it's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever let us pray if you do not know who he is you do not know what all this is about and you would like to know would you just do so much as raise your hand and say by raising your hand pray for me brother branham that i'll know him and the lord bless you all around and i see your hands not heavenly father we bring this message and the fruits of the people raising their hands that they would like to know who this is they would like to be acquainted with this great jesus that is coming of the resurrection is so close to the sixth beginning to be healed and after that taken place then prophecy came into the church then gifts and miracles now down to that last sign the next will come the rapture the church will be taken away and we lord who have claimed to know you in the power of your resurrection we are waiting and longing and crying and begging come lord jesus rapture your church and get it away quickly lord for soon men are going to blow up the earth that you created for them to live on because they have disobeyed you they have not studied peace but war they have not studied righteousness but they studied mischief how that they would not all be power hungry lord that little spot in their heart that makes them hunger for power they're trying to satisfy a laboratory somewhere to blow up their fellow man god if they could only realize that that power that they long for is the power of the resurrection of the son of god the power of the holy ghost to change their lives not grow up nations but change their lives and make them your servants many people stricken with wild crazed they identifies as a bunch of not knowing nothing and and as herod kicks as they did in the early days but as they returned rejoicing thanking you that they could bear the reproach of your name that's the feeling of your children tonight lord everywhere we're only happy some in your day tried to identify you they said he is a friend of that wild man john who came out of the wilderness with harley clothes on it's an old sheepskin wrapped around him a wild man that filmed the words east and weston said the axes laid to the root of the tree he said he is a a follower of him he's a wild man he's mad he's out of his mind the supernatural ministry that was with you oh lord blinded the eyes of those and so has it again today this great holy spirit forerunning the coming of the lord as john did in his day blinding the people to those who do not want to see but to those who are willing to see thou has chosen them and all that the father has given me will come to me you said and none of them will be lost and i'll raise him up at the last day we thank thee for this and those who have raised their hands tonight we pray o lord god that you'll make yourself known to them in an experience in the power of the resurrection granted lord and others may be here who did not raise their hand but yet in their heart they knew that they needed it i pray that you will bless them and give to them the desire of their heart we leave the building tonight may we go as different people may we go with a different purpose than we had coming in if it was contrary to your divine will may we go out with a determination to hold to the harms of the altar until our soul is satisfied that we have had an experience with you and we know of whom we speak because we have met him and know him and have fellowship with him grant these things father heal the sick and afflicted bless our lovely and precious pastor god we pray that you'll be with him and his lovely sisters as they sang the gospel and preach it in their radio bless the strangers it's in our gates lord may they go out tonight with a charge in their heart and a purpose that they from this our own if they do not know you and have not served you before may they serve you knowing this that all other things will come to know but the word of the lord shall remain forever amen granite father forgive us all of our sins and may we meet at that great goal [Music] just my salvation after the message let's just bow our heads in worship as we sang to him i love him with all your heart he first loved [Music] me [Music] how many really love him raise your hand say this by witness i love oh isn't he wonderful you know i just love to sit like this and just drink in somehow his presence his word gone forth that's fallen

a couple of brothers one day and asked him if god is with us where are the miracles and their answer to me is brother we're so deep in the word we don't need that anymore and i said my what an excuse because you don't see god moving you won't accept it but i know he's the same yesterday today and forever and he's still alive and he never changes brother branham says how do you identify him watch how he acts watch how he moves look through the scriptures how he behaved himself through all the scriptures he's still the same yesterday today and forever amen and brethren says you know him by that experience when he becomes alive to you and not just somebody else's words but something that you can share paul says to him who are you he says i am jesus who we persecute and then later he says let me tell you about this one that i met he's the same yesterday today and forever you know just talking sometimes to some folks and they said oh brother though brother that's just things of the past i said no it's he's the same today he's still alive he still moves amen i need him always daily in my life amen and you know what a day that will be brother branham is talking to brother bosworth and brother bosworth said i've been looking for this day forever what a day that'll be when my jesus christ what a day that will be when my jesus i shall see when i look upon his ways the one who saved me by his grace [Music] verse more sickness no pain no more and forever the one who died for me one a day glorious day what a day that will be when my jesus i shall see when i look the one who saved me

of you trusting that this challenge your heart say lord sometimes maybe we get a little bit sluggish maybe we get a little bit and sometimes even remember john he said go ask him if he's the one or should we wait for another sometimes i believe you can ask the lord remind me of kitten one more time just really who you are and let him be real to you brother paul murray would you come in and dismiss us in prayer tonight god be with you god keep you in and watch for him the little boy he asked an older man one day he said when is the best time to pray the old man told him the day before you die and the little boy says but you don't know when you're going to die and he goes that's exactly right so you pray every day and the other one asked him where tell me where i can see god in that old man said look i see him in the trees look i see him in this if you just open there i say lord open my heart and let me see [Music] let's just power our heads heavenly father we're just so grateful lord for your your reality father we're thankful lord that you've sent a message in this day father god that you've given us a heart to receive it ears to hear father we're so grateful for that that experience lord it's not just something that we heard about it's not just something that we were taught but father something we experienced we just pray for every heart here tonight under the sound of my voice lord we just asked it if there's anyone here that hasn't had that experience if they [Music] if they haven't had that back side of the desert experience that the prophet mentioned or the burning bush experience that moses had that that moment that anchors down in our soul where we know that we know that we know that we've met you lord i pray that you just give that to to the heart that's hungry lord the hour is short if it was short then lord how much shorter is it now everywhere we go people that don't even know you just like the prophet was saying they know that something is amiss that something is wrong that something is out of place and truly you'd have to be blind not to see it but father god just feel the the hunger quench the thirst lord with you not with the things of this world father god but with you granted lord the father i just pray that these words that we've heard tonight would not just come and go but lord may they just continue to minister to us be with
