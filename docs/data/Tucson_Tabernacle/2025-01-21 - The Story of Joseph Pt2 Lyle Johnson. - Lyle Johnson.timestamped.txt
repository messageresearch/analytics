[41:24] amen we concluded Genesis chapter 37
[41:28] last time but we have some unfinished
[41:31] business regarding Joseph being sold to
[41:33] spice not slave but spice traitors who
[41:38] then sold him into slavery in
[41:41] Egypt let's go back a moment for opening
[41:44] verses I'm not going to surprise you and
[41:45] jump to some other place in the Bible
[41:47] we're in
[41:48] Genesis the brothers are in Dothan
[41:52] Joseph is stripped starving and thirsty
[41:56] beaten dumped into an empty and dry
[42:00] sistern meanwhile callously his brothers
[42:04] are having a meal while they discuss
[42:07] what to do with
[42:08] them and they some or all of the nine
[42:12] older brothers Ruben wasn't present they
[42:14] sat down to eat bread uh maybe at their
[42:17] lunch there they had some treats that
[42:18] Joseph had brought from Jacob's a little
[42:20] nuts and honey we know that Jacob likes
[42:22] to send nuts and honey to people so
[42:25] they're sitting there maybe enjoying
[42:26] this snack that Joseph had brought while
[42:28] he was starving in the
[42:30] sstn and they lifted up their eyes and
[42:33] they
[42:35] looked and behold a company of
[42:38] Israelites came from Gilead with their
[42:41] camels bearing Spicer and bomb and myrr
[42:46] going to carry it down to Egypt the
[42:48] spice trade must have been pretty good
[42:50] camels were not in wide use at this time
[42:54] a domesticated camel would have been a
[42:56] very expensive
[42:58] animal and Judah the fourth oldest about
[43:02] age 20 he saw this and he turned to his
[43:05] brothers and he said what profit what
[43:07] what do we gain what what advantage is
[43:09] it if if we kill our brother and and
[43:12] conceal his blood come let's sell him to
[43:15] the ishmaelites let not our hand be upon
[43:18] him for even though we hate him he is
[43:21] our brother and our flesh and his
[43:24] Brethren were content they they
[43:25] consented they
[43:27] greed and their passed by midianites
[43:30] merchantmen and they drew and lifted up
[43:33] Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to
[43:36] the Israelites for 20 pieces of
[43:40] silver and they that the ishmaelite
[43:44] midianites brought Joseph into Egypt now
[43:47] we'll get back to this map in this verse
[43:48] in a moment skipping down to verse 36
[43:50] the last verse of chapter 37 the
[43:53] midianites sold Joseph into Egypt unto
[43:58] potier an officer of pharaohs and
[44:01] captain of the Guard Chief
[44:04] executioner head of the Secret Service
[44:07] and the FBI and the CIA and Homeland
[44:11] Security please be
[44:16] seated there are at least three
[44:18] questions that come to mind when we read
[44:20] these
[44:23] verses why would the brothers think they
[44:26] could get away with their crime against
[44:28] Joseph and against their
[44:31] father by selling Joseph to these
[44:36] Merchants how would they know that word
[44:38] wouldn't get back to Jacob why would
[44:41] spice Traders agree to buy a
[44:46] slave and why does Moses who wrote
[44:49] Genesis make it clear that these were
[44:53] ishmaelites rather than simply calling
[44:55] them midianites
[44:58] once again you know me we need to get
[45:01] context well let's look at the probable
[45:04] route from Dothan to
[45:06] Egypt the brothers know the area they
[45:09] know the likely route the caravan's
[45:10] going to take from Dothan to Egypt and
[45:13] they know
[45:14] Joseph do you see the
[45:17] problem Joseph isn't going to be
[45:20] appliable quiet guys they attach them to
[45:23] the pack animals and force them to walk
[45:25] the next 300 miles
[45:27] to and across the scorching Sinai desert
[45:31] into Egypt he's young strong can survive
[45:35] the journey but he'll be talking he'll
[45:37] be
[45:39] bleading he'll recognize some of the
[45:42] route as well assume they cover 25 or 30
[45:45] miles a day on the second day of the
[45:47] journey they're going to pass within 20
[45:50] miles of heon of Jacob's
[45:54] home hey guys
[45:57] listen to me my my my dad's a very
[45:59] wealthy
[46:00] man very wealthy and if we just detour
[46:05] or or if you can send one of your
[46:07] servants to to Hebron look on the map
[46:09] I've got a little dashed red line for
[46:11] you to follow here my my dad he'll pay
[46:14] you a huge
[46:15] Ransom many times more than you can
[46:18] possibly make by by selling me to the
[46:20] Egyptian slave market you guys are all
[46:23] about making a profit right my my dad
[46:27] will pay plenty for me I tell you no
[46:29] questions asked he he's rich and I'm his
[46:33] favorite no no really I I I
[46:38] am Hey Hey My My grandpa Isaac and your
[46:41] grandpa Ishmael they're Brothers we're
[46:44] some sort of
[46:45] cousins we're
[46:48] family guys guys why won't you to listen
[46:51] to me please ow ow ow why are you
[46:55] hitting me
[46:57] shut up you filthy Hebrew we're going to
[47:00] take you to Egypt frankly we don't care
[47:03] if we lose money on you we're just going
[47:06] to enjoy seeing you suffer and know that
[47:09] you'll be suffering for as long as you
[47:11] live your short life toiling in the hot
[47:14] Egyptian
[47:16] sun you think it's only your brothers
[47:19] that hate
[47:21] you well what's really going
[47:24] on why wouldn't they make a small d sort
[47:27] to cash in on
[47:28] Joseph and how could the brothers have
[47:31] absolute confidence that Joseph would
[47:34] not succeed in persuading these
[47:38] Merchants to do
[47:40] so why would they be willing to risk
[47:44] everything for 20
[47:48] shekels you're right we need more
[47:51] context first let's look at Midian where
[47:54] these guys came from but not looking so
[47:56] much at the place but but the person
[47:58] after whom the place is named the the
[48:01] founder if you
[48:02] will he was born to Abraham of coutura
[48:06] flashback 125 years or so Genesis 251
[48:10] then again long after Hagar's departure
[48:13] sometime following Sarah's death Abraham
[48:16] took a wife and her name was
[48:20] coutura she bear him zimran and yakin
[48:25] and Medan and I and ishack and shua yeah
[48:30] yeah I'm I'm I'm shua we often think of
[48:34] Abraham as having two sons ishmail and
[48:37] Isaac but we see he had at least
[48:40] eight skipping down to verse five
[48:44] Abraham
[48:47] gave gave all that he had unto Isaac but
[48:52] Unto the Sons of the concubines zimran
[48:54] Jan mid Midian ishac and shua which
[48:58] Abraham had Abraham gave gifts and sent
[49:01] them away from Isaac his son while he
[49:04] yet lived Eastward into the East
[49:07] Country into the
[49:10] desert so the midianites were among the
[49:15] disinherited of
[49:17] Abraham Midian received a
[49:20] gift but not an
[49:22] inheritance he was sent away into the
[49:24] desert the Arabian penins Pula Abraham
[49:28] wanted nothing further to do with him
[49:30] nor they him when Abraham died and was
[49:34] buried none of curra's sons were listed
[49:37] as
[49:38] present Midian settled in an area he
[49:41] named after himself it's the area marked
[49:43] on the lower right of the screen it's in
[49:44] present day Saudi
[49:46] Arabia it's the place to which
[49:50] Moses the guy writing this book would
[49:53] later Flee for his life from Egypt and
[49:56] possibly where he began to write Genesis
[49:58] after leaving Egypt the second
[50:02] time moving on who was the first born of
[50:07] Abraham wasn't Isaac it was ishmail born
[50:12] of
[50:12] Hagar sarai's Egyptian slave Sarai who
[50:16] later became Sarah and Abram who later
[50:19] became Abraham received a promise of a
[50:21] son he had Faith Abraham believed
[50:25] God but he didn't trust God for the
[50:28] timing tried to take matters into his
[50:31] own hand slept with sarai's slave Hagar
[50:35] because Sarai didn't trust God's timing
[50:38] either well what did the Lord say about
[50:42] ishmail to Hagar his mother when she
[50:45] fled for her life from Sarai before
[50:48] ishmail was
[50:51] born the angel of the Lord found Hagar
[50:56] by a fountain of water in the wilderness
[50:58] by the fountain in the way to
[51:01] Shure and he said Hagar sise maid once
[51:06] comest thou whether wilt thou go where
[51:08] are you coming from where where are you
[51:12] headed and she said I flee from the face
[51:16] of my mistress
[51:19] Sarah and the angel of the Lord said
[51:22] unto her this Egyptian slave said unto
[51:26] her her return to thy
[51:29] mistress submit thyself under her
[51:32] hands and the angel of the Lord said
[51:34] unto her I will multiply thy descendants
[51:39] exceedingly that it shall not be
[51:41] numbered for
[51:43] multitude you're going to get through
[51:45] this and the angel of the Lord said unto
[51:48] her behold thou art with
[51:51] child this is not news to her but the
[51:53] rest of it is and shalt bear a son
[51:57] and shalt call his name
[51:58] Ishmael God will hear because the Lord
[52:02] hath heard thy
[52:05] Affliction he'll be a wild man his hand
[52:09] will be against every man and every
[52:10] man's hand against him and he'll dwell
[52:14] in the presence of of all his Brethren
[52:17] ESV ends with he shall dwell over
[52:20] against or near all his
[52:24] Kinsmen well we expect ishmail
[52:27] and likely his descendants to be at odds
[52:30] with Isaac and his descendants and
[52:33] ishmael's descendants of course are
[52:35] called
[52:37] ishmaelites well Abraham was 86 when
[52:41] Ishmael was born Genesis 16:16 it's on
[52:44] the handout all the scriptures that that
[52:46] I'm referencing although this ones may
[52:49] not be because we're not actually
[52:50] reading it he was a hundred years old
[52:53] when Isaac was born 14 years later
[52:56] Genesis
[52:58] 215 how is ishmail ultimately treated by
[53:01] Abraham let's flash back to the
[53:03] Celebration when the toddler Isaac was
[53:06] weaned at about three years of age
[53:08] making ishmail about
[53:10] 17 Genesis 219 and Sarah saw ishmail the
[53:14] son of Hagar the Egyptian which she had
[53:17] borne unto Abraham mocking kind of like
[53:20] a normal teenage boy right 17 years old
[53:23] his three-year-old half brother over
[53:25] here look at this little
[53:27] God
[53:29] wherefore Sarah said unto
[53:32] Abraham Abraham cast out this Bond woman
[53:35] and her son the son of this Bond woman
[53:38] should not be air with my son not not
[53:41] with my
[53:42] Isaac well the thing was very Grievous
[53:45] in Abraham's sight because of his son
[53:47] Abraham loved ishmail they were buddies
[53:50] they were pal they got along God said
[53:52] unto Abraham let it not be Grievous in
[53:55] thy sight because of the lad and because
[53:58] of thy Bond woman and all that Sarah
[54:00] hath said unto thee hearken unto her
[54:04] voice for in Isaac shall thy seed be
[54:09] called Abraham she may be throwing a
[54:12] hisy fit but listen to your
[54:16] wife
[54:18] whoa excuse me I don't know where we're
[54:20] at
[54:21] now we'll get there sorry
[54:28] I don't know what happened
[54:34] here you're getting a sneak
[54:49] preview well hopefully it'll come back
[54:52] oh okay thank you and also the son of
[54:56] the Bond woman will I make a nation
[54:59] because he's thy seed he's your
[55:01] Offspring he's your descendant Abraham
[55:03] rose up early in the morning and took
[55:05] bread and a bottle like a win skin a
[55:08] bottle of water and gave it unto Hagar
[55:11] and putting it on her
[55:13] shoulder why ishmail is this strong
[55:16] strapping 17-year-old
[55:18] boy Hagar's carrying it because she's a
[55:22] slave and the child ishma now AED 17 and
[55:27] sent her away and she departed and
[55:29] wandered in the wilderness of Beva
[55:32] that's the southern part of modern day
[55:34] Israel and Islam the Quran claims that
[55:37] hegar was in Medina not Bersa their
[55:41] version of the miracle to be described
[55:43] in the next few verses is why Medina is
[55:45] the second holiest place in that
[55:48] religion and the water was spent in the
[55:50] bottle they they drank it it's a long
[55:51] way they've been Walking In the Heat of
[55:53] the desert and and Hagar cast Ishmael
[55:56] under one of the shrubs a little
[56:00] shade and she went and sat down over
[56:03] against him a good way off about a bow
[56:05] shot a few hundred feet maybe from from
[56:08] here to the to the back wall of the
[56:10] church there or so and she said let let
[56:14] me not see the death of the
[56:17] child and she sat over opposite him to
[56:20] lift lifted up her voice and wept oh
[56:25] Lord what is this
[56:27] happening in her
[56:29] distress she forgot the promise that the
[56:32] angel of the Lord had made to her some
[56:34] 17 or 18 years
[56:36] earlier when I'm stressed out that she
[56:38] usually when I need to be reminded as
[56:40] well that's when I tend to
[56:42] forget and God heard the voice of Hagar
[56:47] no we have no idea but he heard the
[56:50] voice of ishmail he heard the voice of
[56:52] the lad and the angel of God Called to
[56:55] the lad
[56:56] no to
[56:58] Hagar out of heaven and said unto her
[57:01] what aith the Hagar fear not God ha
[57:05] heard your voice no God has heard the
[57:08] voice of the lad where he is arise lift
[57:12] up the lad hold him in thine hand I will
[57:15] make him a great
[57:16] nation he's reminding hegar the promise
[57:19] he made to her before ishmail was born
[57:22] just like the previous time she's in the
[57:23] wilderness she's fleeing from Sarah
[57:31] and I'm a little nervous here okay and
[57:34] God opened her
[57:37] eyes and she saw a well of water just
[57:39] like before in the desert and there's
[57:41] some water and she went and filled the
[57:43] bottle of water and gave the lad drink
[57:46] and God was with ishmail and he grew and
[57:49] dwelt in the wilderness became an Archer
[57:52] he dwelt in the wilderness of pan and
[57:54] Hagar took him a wife
[57:56] out of the land of
[57:59] Egypt you can be sure ishmael's
[58:02] descendants knew the story of the
[58:04] banishment visited upon Him by Abraham
[58:06] and Sarah and here in Dothan are
[58:09] descendants of Isaac the favored son who
[58:12] got the birthright and inheritance that
[58:14] should have been
[58:15] ishmael's Joseph's brothers are offering
[58:18] these ishmaelites from Midian another
[58:22] ill-treated son of Abraham the son
[58:24] favored by Jacob who himself is the son
[58:27] of Isaac whom Abraham favored over
[58:30] ishmail this is the the Hatfields and
[58:33] The
[58:38] McCoys there we go how can the
[58:40] Israelites refuse and at 20 pieces of
[58:44] silver the price is cheap these guys
[58:46] could afford
[58:48] camels the brothers knew that there's no
[58:51] way these ishmaelite spice Traders from
[58:55] Midian will ever let Joseph Escape nor
[58:58] sell him back to Jacob Joseph is going
[59:02] to Egypt to a life of slavery performing
[59:05] harsh labor in their broiling sun or
[59:08] toiling in a mine probably dying in
[59:11] early death how the Merchant's eyes must
[59:14] have glistened at the thought ah Sweet
[59:18] Revenge and even better his suffering
[59:21] will be in Egypt where our matriarch
[59:24] Hagar came from as what a Slave how old
[59:29] was our ancestor Ishmael when he was
[59:31] banished with Hagar 17 how old is this
[59:35] Hebrew grandson of the usurper Isaac the
[59:38] favorite of his father Jacob
[59:42] 17 She Came From Slavery you're going
[59:45] into slavery oh the
[59:48] irony yeah we'll take them well we'll
[59:50] only give you 20 pieces of
[59:53] silver and the brothers thought
[59:56] good riddance good luck with those
[59:58] dreams Joey
[1:00:01] bye-bye and now begins a 300 mile
[1:00:06] trk it is uncomfortable these guys hate
[1:00:09] him for what he represents yet yet that
[1:00:12] very hatred is what is saving Joseph's
[1:00:16] life but what's really going on here
[1:00:18] let's let's turn to Psalm
[1:00:24] 105 I'm using the SV for clarity here
[1:00:27] Psalm 105 opens up oh give thanks to the
[1:00:30] Lord always a good idea call upon his
[1:00:33] name make known his deeds among the
[1:00:35] peoples sing to him sing praises to Him
[1:00:39] tell of all his wondrous
[1:00:42] Works glory in His holy name let the
[1:00:45] hearts of those who seek the Lord
[1:00:47] Rejoice well what may be included in
[1:00:50] this list of deeds and wondrous works
[1:00:54] for which we are to sing praises to the
[1:00:57] Lord Brother Lyall I thought we were in
[1:00:59] the story of Joseph oh oh yeah you're
[1:01:01] you're right oh oh ver verse
[1:01:04] 16 when the Lord summoned a famine on
[1:01:06] the land and broke all supply of bread
[1:01:10] the Lord sent a man ahead of Jacob's
[1:01:13] family Joseph who was sold as a
[1:01:16] slave Joseph's feet were hurt with
[1:01:19] Fetters his neck was put in a collar of
[1:01:22] iron until what he said came to pass
[1:01:26] the word of the Lord tested
[1:01:30] Joseph the Lord was sending Joseph to
[1:01:35] Egypt just not the way we often think of
[1:01:38] these things not on a jet airliner Warn
[1:01:42] and air conditioned automobile not
[1:01:44] staying in nice hotels eating in
[1:01:46] restaurants speaking to Friendly groups
[1:01:49] before jetting home not moving to a town
[1:01:53] with a church to attend but be en and
[1:01:57] starved Shackled
[1:02:00] betrayed
[1:02:02] dehydrated
[1:02:03] thirsting to a life of unrequited
[1:02:08] toil years later Isaiah knew this story
[1:02:12] of Joseph's hardship and misery
[1:02:15] deception and pain yet Isaiah said here
[1:02:17] am I Lord send
[1:02:20] me
[1:02:22] send me
[1:02:26] back to Joseph's
[1:02:27] Journey no mercy from his ishmaelite
[1:02:30] owners other than to keep him alive so
[1:02:32] he'll be marketable hot thirsty hungry
[1:02:37] sunburnt the metal collar even hotter in
[1:02:40] the sun burning his neck the shackles
[1:02:44] doing the same to his ankles and feet
[1:02:46] chafing them besides the heat feet
[1:02:49] swollen ankles raw bleeding
[1:02:52] blistered don't want him trying to run
[1:02:55] away
[1:02:56] and the
[1:02:57] smell not just sweat animal dung in
[1:03:00] urine the usual odors along our
[1:03:02] primitive Road or
[1:03:05] track but the
[1:03:07] spices many of these spices weren't for
[1:03:10] flavoring food they were for perfumes
[1:03:13] and
[1:03:14] incense the Egyptians that that could
[1:03:16] afford it would mix them with animal fat
[1:03:18] then put a GOP of it on their heads
[1:03:20] maybe smear some in other parts of their
[1:03:22] bodies their cleanly shaved bodies was a
[1:03:26] custom in Egypt amongst the elite as the
[1:03:28] day wore on the fat would melt run down
[1:03:32] their scalp neck and so forth to help
[1:03:35] offset the odors of an Agricultural
[1:03:38] Society replacing it with the fragrances
[1:03:40] of the
[1:03:42] elite I don't know about you but to me
[1:03:44] that sounds pretty
[1:03:45] disgusting would you want to put a glob
[1:03:48] of lard on your head mixed with some
[1:03:50] sort of cologne or perfume then let it
[1:03:52] heat up in the Sun and dribble down your
[1:03:54] face and neck
[1:03:56] neither would I but the Egyptians did
[1:04:00] and many of these spices were
[1:04:01] particularly aromatic they fetched a
[1:04:04] good price among the upper classes in
[1:04:09] Egypt and that's what Joseph would smell
[1:04:12] for the long forced March of two weeks
[1:04:15] or so the spices and other Goods weren't
[1:04:18] in hermetically sealed containers or
[1:04:20] wrapped in plastic bags or wrapped from
[1:04:23] Costco or something they were in poorest
[1:04:26] Sachs forced to along to a foreign land
[1:04:30] among people speaking a language he
[1:04:32] doesn't understand strange Customs a
[1:04:36] religion full of various gods and
[1:04:37] goddesses and very different culture far
[1:04:42] from home he would be associating these
[1:04:46] smells of the elite with the Heartbreak
[1:04:50] of leaving his family the cruel
[1:04:52] rejection of his brothers the taunt
[1:04:56] mistreatment by his owners pain
[1:05:01] hunger
[1:05:03] thirst The
[1:05:05] Thirst towards the end of his journey he
[1:05:08] would pass the Eastern edge of the Nile
[1:05:10] Delta an area we know is Goan on on the
[1:05:13] map here that's here this is uh it may
[1:05:15] not look terribly green to you but this
[1:05:17] is the Nile river flowing here you can
[1:05:19] see the desert's all brown and this is a
[1:05:21] very fertile
[1:05:23] area he's coming from Dothan coming down
[1:05:26] across the Sinai now he's at the edge of
[1:05:28] Goan at the Eastern edge of the Nile
[1:05:30] Delta it's Lush fertile almost tropical
[1:05:35] plenty of water lakes ducks and geese
[1:05:39] all sorts of wildlife he'd never seen
[1:05:42] before beautiful place little did he
[1:05:45] know that it would become the home of
[1:05:48] his clan as they became a
[1:05:51] nation a bit further on leaving the
[1:05:54] Delta area he would pass own later
[1:05:57] called heliopolis by the Greeks it was a
[1:06:00] center for among other things worship of
[1:06:03] the sun today this is a location in
[1:06:07] Cairo near the airport and there were
[1:06:10] multiple obelisks there well part of sun
[1:06:13] god
[1:06:15] worship these were Granite needle-like
[1:06:19] structures one piece stood on end with
[1:06:23] no supports not in a socket or got on a
[1:06:26] pit just flat on the bottom and placed
[1:06:28] on a solid surface unlike anything he'd
[1:06:31] ever
[1:06:32] seen this Obelisk and the photograph was
[1:06:35] erected at own to celebrate the 30th
[1:06:37] year of the reign of pharaoh cus R
[1:06:40] first shown on the
[1:06:42] right among other things sinus read the
[1:06:46] first established diplomatic and trade
[1:06:48] relations with various towns in Syria
[1:06:51] and Canaan which would have helped
[1:06:53] enable the Caravan of the ishmaelites to
[1:06:56] trade when Joseph passed by on his way
[1:06:59] to the slave market in Memphis this
[1:07:02] Obelisk would have been less than 50
[1:07:04] years
[1:07:05] old this is an old photograph it's maybe
[1:07:08] a hundred years old or so of one of the
[1:07:11] obelisks that sesr one set which Joseph
[1:07:15] saw a solid piece of red granite
[1:07:19] standing 69 ft tall weighing 120
[1:07:23] tons you can get some impression been
[1:07:26] size by the man standing next to the
[1:07:28] base which I've
[1:07:29] circled that's a full-size man not a kid
[1:07:33] that is one massive thing and here it is
[1:07:37] standing in the same place unmoved the
[1:07:40] weather War
[1:07:43] 4,000 years
[1:07:45] later it's the only Obelisk still
[1:07:48] standing in own it would have been new
[1:07:52] when Joseph walked by he would have seen
[1:07:55] it
[1:07:56] and
[1:07:57] oh by the
[1:07:58] way there may have been a a little girl
[1:08:01] playing outside as he was marched by
[1:08:04] perhaps she she stopped and looked up
[1:08:06] when she caught the powerful scent of
[1:08:09] the passing spice
[1:08:12] Caravan that smells like my
[1:08:14] daddy if so she might have noticed the
[1:08:18] out ofpl slave Tethered to the end of
[1:08:21] the line after it passed she probably
[1:08:24] went back to playing with her friends a
[1:08:26] a little girl daughter of the priest of
[1:08:30] an that would someday be Joseph's wife
[1:08:34] become the matriarch of two tribes of
[1:08:37] Israel and the only wife of any of
[1:08:40] Jacob's sons that is named in the Bible
[1:08:44] a very special little
[1:08:46] girl to a young man who had never seen
[1:08:49] anything more imposing than perhaps a
[1:08:51] two-story Stone building or a defensive
[1:08:54] wall around a small City such a sight
[1:08:57] must have been awe inspiring a gigantic
[1:09:00] pillar of granite carved with strange
[1:09:03] symbols just standing
[1:09:05] there he must have been wondering who
[1:09:09] are these
[1:09:10] people how can they do things like
[1:09:14] this as he continued on to the Nile he
[1:09:17] must have marveled at the size of the
[1:09:19] river in an utterly Barren desert much
[1:09:22] wider and deeper than the branch of the
[1:09:24] Euphrates near his boyhood home or the
[1:09:27] Jordan that he crossed about six years
[1:09:29] old coming into Canaan looking across it
[1:09:32] he would have spotted the Giza plateau
[1:09:34] and the mighty pyramids upon it pyramids
[1:09:36] that were only a few hundred years old
[1:09:39] the tallest most massive structures in
[1:09:42] the ancient
[1:09:45] world the Egyptians were masters of
[1:09:48] stonecraft many of their accomplishments
[1:09:50] are still all inspiring just ask the
[1:09:52] folks in the picture
[1:09:56] finally they came to Memphis the nominal
[1:09:59] capital of may have been U just outside
[1:10:01] of Memphis and established about the
[1:10:03] time Joseph arrived archaeological
[1:10:06] evidence suggest it was a little more
[1:10:07] than one of the royal residences the
[1:10:10] capital before then was stes another 400
[1:10:12] miles further south along the Nile Egypt
[1:10:16] was earlier and from time to time became
[1:10:18] again two kingdoms with the capital for
[1:10:20] the lower Kingdom and for the upper
[1:10:22] Kingdom the reason for the capital
[1:10:24] shifting from time to time time from the
[1:10:25] Delta to thieves well let's rejoin
[1:10:29] Joseph now we've got a lot of context
[1:10:31] here let's rejoin Joseph as he arrives
[1:10:34] in the slave
[1:10:35] market Genesis
[1:10:38] 37 King James the midianite sold Joseph
[1:10:41] into Egypt unto potier an officer of
[1:10:44] pharaohs and captain of the guard and in
[1:10:46] the ESV we read
[1:10:48] meanwhile most translations read
[1:10:51] meanwhile as as Jacob is mourning his
[1:10:53] son and won't be comforted
[1:10:55] meanwhile the midianites sold Joseph in
[1:10:58] Egypt to pitifer an officer of pharaoh
[1:11:02] the captain of the
[1:11:04] Guard now you may have noticed that
[1:11:07] chapter 37 which we read last time and
[1:11:09] had been reviewing this evening so far
[1:11:12] never mentions
[1:11:14] God I've skipped around and read from
[1:11:16] other chapters where references to God
[1:11:18] are present but in chapter 37 his
[1:11:21] mention is
[1:11:22] conspicuously absent he does doesn't
[1:11:25] speak he isn't even referred
[1:11:29] to moses' ancient audience may have been
[1:11:32] wondering just like Joseph and Jacob
[1:11:34] must have been
[1:11:35] wondering Where's
[1:11:38] God has he abandoned me why is all this
[1:11:42] bad stuff
[1:11:44] happening what did I do to bring it
[1:11:46] about and of course why
[1:11:51] me have you ever had the
[1:11:54] meanwhiles wondered where God was in the
[1:11:57] midst of your life let's do a quick
[1:12:00] summary an overview of part of chapter
[1:12:02] 37 and as we leave it to see the hand of
[1:12:05] God working in the
[1:12:08] background Joseph had to be sent from
[1:12:11] heon by his dad exactly when he was so
[1:12:17] he could arrive at
[1:12:18] sheam precisely when he did so he could
[1:12:22] happen to encounter a stranger who had
[1:12:26] just happened to overhear the brothers
[1:12:28] saying they were going to Dothan Dothan
[1:12:31] which just happened to be a perfect
[1:12:34] place to inspire a murder Ruben had to
[1:12:38] persuade his brothers postpone the kill
[1:12:41] and his rescue plan had to
[1:12:45] fail the passing traitors had to be
[1:12:49] Israelites who happened to have a grudge
[1:12:52] against Jacob and they had to be on the
[1:12:55] to gilean to Egypt spice route that just
[1:12:57] happened to go through
[1:13:00] Dothan they had to arrive at the precise
[1:13:03] moment that the brothers were eating and
[1:13:07] they had to have a motive for refusing a
[1:13:10] large reward for returning Joseph to his
[1:13:13] father they had to take him to a
[1:13:16] specific City in Egypt and to sell them
[1:13:20] on a specific day to a specific Man Who
[1:13:24] Would happened to be in the slave market
[1:13:27] at the moment Joseph was for sale and
[1:13:30] happened to have a use for another young
[1:13:34] male slave and happen to be Pharaoh's
[1:13:38] captain of the
[1:13:41] Guard God did and does use all sorts of
[1:13:45] people with diverse motives
[1:13:47] orchestrating the entire sequence in his
[1:13:51] perfect timing working behind the scenes
[1:13:55] with his invisible hand guiding it all
[1:13:59] just as we read in Psalm 105 God sent
[1:14:04] Joseph to Egypt and used people
[1:14:07] motivated by hatred and jealousy to
[1:14:10] accomplish his
[1:14:12] will back to our story chapter 38 deals
[1:14:16] with Judah and we'll get to it God
[1:14:17] willing at a future date because judah's
[1:14:20] story of transformation runs parallel to
[1:14:22] Joseph's and when they intersect
[1:14:26] well you won't want to miss
[1:14:28] it chapter
[1:14:30] 39 opens with a repeat of the last verse
[1:14:33] of chapter 37 with one significant
[1:14:35] addition shesis 391 Joseph was brought
[1:14:38] down to Egypt potier an officer of
[1:14:41] pharaoh captain of the Guard an Egyptian
[1:14:44] bought him of the hands of the
[1:14:45] Israelites which had brought him down
[1:14:48] thither and the Lord was with
[1:14:51] Joseph the Lord was with
[1:14:57] Joseph I've been told I can't
[1:15:00] confirm that one Jewish tradition says
[1:15:03] that potier smelled the aroma that's
[1:15:06] associated with nobility as he passed
[1:15:09] near the slave market that Aroma
[1:15:11] shouldn't be there unless a heavily
[1:15:14] guarded Noble was present but in His
[1:15:16] official capacity he would have known of
[1:15:17] such a visit he had not been advised so
[1:15:21] he rushed in to potentially defend the
[1:15:23] unknown Noble who might need protection
[1:15:26] from the sort of folks that Gather in
[1:15:28] such
[1:15:30] places the sight of potier charging into
[1:15:33] the slave market looking for the source
[1:15:34] of the aroma would have struck fear in
[1:15:36] the people he's the captain of the Guard
[1:15:38] the Royal executioner a very powerful
[1:15:42] and physically intimidating
[1:15:45] person the crowd's perspective would
[1:15:48] have been one of intimidation by his
[1:15:50] sudden presence there would be a sudden
[1:15:53] hush fall on the
[1:15:56] Marketplace Piper's perspective would be
[1:15:58] surprise perhaps confusion and instead
[1:16:01] of seeing a noble perhaps in need of
[1:16:04] protection he sees a young man on the
[1:16:06] slave block that smells of
[1:16:10] nobility yet is clearly a foreigner
[1:16:13] young and strong though clearly
[1:16:16] abused Joseph's perspective on The
[1:16:20] Auction Block in a bewildering Place one
[1:16:22] of the largest cities in the world at
[1:16:24] that that time hearing a language that
[1:16:27] he doesn't yet speak in the midst of a
[1:16:29] culture he certainly doesn't understand
[1:16:32] among people whose values are very
[1:16:33] different than his and smelling like the
[1:16:36] spices he's been marching and sleeping
[1:16:38] with for the past several days a
[1:16:41] fragrance the crowd would associate with
[1:16:43] their oppressors and overlords making
[1:16:45] the crowd hostile towards him everybody
[1:16:49] hates me and suddenly this Hulk of a guy
[1:16:53] comes charging in weapon drawn searching
[1:16:56] the suddenly silent crowd and then he
[1:16:58] stares at
[1:17:00] Joseph eyes
[1:17:02] locked comes closer perhaps he
[1:17:07] sniffs Joseph
[1:17:09] wonders what's going on who is this
[1:17:13] guy potier walks to the person running
[1:17:16] the slave
[1:17:17] market indicates Joseph transactions
[1:17:20] concluded Joseph's shackles and collar
[1:17:23] removed Potter for points Joseph walks
[1:17:27] out of the market just ahead of him
[1:17:30] people moving out of the way clearing a
[1:17:31] path not because of Joseph that'll
[1:17:34] happen many years later right now he's
[1:17:38] just a foreign slave no the crowd Parts
[1:17:41] because of the guy right behind him
[1:17:43] potier one of the most powerful and
[1:17:46] feared men in the
[1:17:48] country how did this
[1:17:51] happen and the Lord was with
[1:17:55] Joseph and always had
[1:17:58] been H looks like we still have time
[1:18:01] let's move on into chapter
[1:18:03] 39 the Lord was with Joseph he was a
[1:18:06] prosperous man that takes time several
[1:18:09] years and he was in the house of his
[1:18:12] master Piper the
[1:18:14] Egyptian and his master saw that the
[1:18:18] Lord was with Joseph and that the Lord
[1:18:21] made all that Joseph did to prosper in
[1:18:23] his hand Joseph found Grace in Piper's
[1:18:26] sight and he served
[1:18:29] potier and pfer made Joseph overseer
[1:18:32] over his house and all that potterer had
[1:18:36] he put into Joseph's hand this is a big
[1:18:40] deal today we'd say he was promoted
[1:18:42] through the ranks from janitor to the
[1:18:44] Sea Suite he became the Chief Operating
[1:18:47] Officer the the COO of the plantation
[1:18:49] and Piper's other business
[1:18:52] interests it came to pass from the time
[1:18:55] that Piper had made Joseph Overseer in
[1:18:57] his house and all that he had since he'
[1:18:59] made him his coo that the Lord blessed
[1:19:02] the Egyptians house for Joseph's sake
[1:19:05] and the blessing of the Lord was upon
[1:19:06] all that Piper had in the house and in
[1:19:09] the
[1:19:10] field this represents the passive of
[1:19:13] some
[1:19:15] years it's from the
[1:19:18] Nile potier didn't March Joseph from the
[1:19:21] market to his house have a conversation
[1:19:23] along the way check out his LinkedIn
[1:19:26] profile on his ey Stone and decide to
[1:19:29] put Joseph in charge of everything upon
[1:19:31] their arrival at the place let me see
[1:19:34] here you dream you wear a fancy coat you
[1:19:39] help watch flocks of sheep you file
[1:19:41] reports wow you're just a guy I've been
[1:19:43] looking for it to run my business no no
[1:19:47] Joseph would have been put in the slave
[1:19:49] quarters taught how to do the most
[1:19:51] menial tasks learned to speak the
[1:19:53] Egyptian language hey Hebrew that means
[1:19:56] muck out the cattle stalls now go do
[1:19:59] it we learn from verse five that Piper
[1:20:02] had fields in fact Middle Kingdom Egypt
[1:20:06] officials were often compensated with
[1:20:08] land to farm for food and trade as as a
[1:20:11] high official Piper's Holdings would
[1:20:13] have been
[1:20:15] extensive near the time of Joseph an
[1:20:18] Egyptian official named MRI was buried
[1:20:21] his tomb was robbed but a sealed off
[1:20:23] area was Miss by the thieves thousands
[1:20:26] of years later it was eventually found
[1:20:29] by archaeologists it contained lots of
[1:20:31] detailed wooden models of Life on his
[1:20:35] estate this is a 4,000 year old wooden
[1:20:39] model of a cattle stall you can see the
[1:20:42] cattle you can see the people taking
[1:20:44] care of them the model on the left is of
[1:20:47] a granery with six workers filling the
[1:20:50] storage areas and several scribes
[1:20:52] keeping accounts it must have been a
[1:20:54] government officials six people are
[1:20:56] working and eight or nine people are
[1:20:57] keeping track of
[1:20:59] them I'm sorry I shouldn't just said
[1:21:01] that the model on the right is of a
[1:21:04] slaughterous with cattle and geese being
[1:21:07] butchered the models provide a glimpse
[1:21:10] of a state life in Joseph's
[1:21:14] era over a period of at least a few
[1:21:16] years Piper would have taken note of
[1:21:18] this exceptional servant for Joseph to
[1:21:21] become prosperous successful takes time
[1:21:24] and work
[1:21:27] determination Joseph would have spent
[1:21:29] years in the field learning the seasons
[1:21:33] how to plant how to get the best yield
[1:21:35] how to harvest and winnow and thresh and
[1:21:38] store and preserve grain after all in
[1:21:42] his first Dream he saw sheep of
[1:21:45] wheat Joseph needs to learn to master
[1:21:48] all aspects of
[1:21:50] Agriculture related to wheat he's in the
[1:21:54] field he's getting some Hands-On
[1:21:56] training and but specifically such
[1:21:59] agriculture is practiced in
[1:22:02] Egypt recall years earlier there was a
[1:22:05] famine in Canaan and Abram traveled to
[1:22:07] Egypt why because unlike the surrounding
[1:22:11] areas Egypt did not depend on local
[1:22:14] seasonal rains for
[1:22:17] crops the Nile is the longest river in
[1:22:20] the world traveling some 4,000 miles
[1:22:24] from the mountain mountains of East
[1:22:25] Africa modern day Uganda and Ethiopia
[1:22:28] nearby areas to the Mediterranean
[1:22:31] Sea the equatorial rains there far away
[1:22:34] from the Mediterranean fed the sources
[1:22:37] of the Nile the resulting flooding of
[1:22:40] the Nile came every year like clockwork
[1:22:44] the river would rise depositing fresh
[1:22:46] soil replenishing the Aid Desert along
[1:22:49] its banks when the floods receded the
[1:22:52] farmers then went into the mud and
[1:22:54] planted their
[1:22:55] crops as the water continued to recede
[1:22:58] lacking irrigation pumps the Farm
[1:23:00] Workers would employ device called a
[1:23:01] shaduf to move water from the river to
[1:23:04] the
[1:23:06] fields the result was good soil a
[1:23:09] reliable supply of water for agriculture
[1:23:13] very different from agriculture in Canan
[1:23:15] and Mesopotamia which depended on local
[1:23:18] seasonal rain often unreliable and a
[1:23:21] very real threat of famine and certainly
[1:23:25] all quite new to a Shepherd like
[1:23:30] Joseph and meanwhile there's always a
[1:23:34] meanwhile Joseph applied himself to
[1:23:36] learn the Customs the culture the
[1:23:39] language the dress of Egypt and and his
[1:23:42] station within that hierarchy as he
[1:23:44] eventually Advanced he learned how to
[1:23:46] win the trust and loyalty of those he
[1:23:49] managed how to motivate them to get the
[1:23:51] best from
[1:23:53] them and with complete Integrity to
[1:23:56] obtain Grace favor with his master poer
[1:24:00] I suspect Joseph's attitude became one
[1:24:03] of
[1:24:04] gratitude he could have been sold to a
[1:24:06] cruel Master condemned to work in the
[1:24:08] minds of the Sinai or the sewage pits
[1:24:10] who
[1:24:11] knows but the Lord was with Joseph and
[1:24:15] he prospered years of toil in the fields
[1:24:19] gaining experience and
[1:24:23] responsibility and
[1:24:26] eventually potier left all that he had
[1:24:28] in Joseph's hand he knew not ought that
[1:24:31] he had he didn't worry about anything he
[1:24:33] had no concern about anything except the
[1:24:35] bread which he did eat what's cooking
[1:24:38] today the estate was booming abundant
[1:24:41] crops healthy cattle everything running
[1:24:45] smoothly with excellent
[1:24:47] results and we're told Joseph was a
[1:24:50] goodly person and and well
[1:24:52] favored by now in his mid-20s Joseph was
[1:24:56] not only successful and smart and wise
[1:24:58] he was also a strong good-looking young
[1:25:01] man other translations say he was
[1:25:02] handsome well-built
[1:25:04] attractive should be no surprise he came
[1:25:07] from a line of Attractive people great
[1:25:09] grandma Sarah was attractive enough she
[1:25:11] was wanted by an earlier
[1:25:13] Pharaoh Grandma Rebecca was another
[1:25:15] good-looking woman as was his mom Rachel
[1:25:17] the Bible rarely comments on physical
[1:25:21] appearances but these three ladies along
[1:25:24] on with Joseph are described to set the
[1:25:27] stage for what happens
[1:25:30] next Joseph's been proed he's no longer
[1:25:33] working in the fields now he's working
[1:25:35] in the
[1:25:36] house danger works in the
[1:25:40] house centuries later Solomon would
[1:25:44] observe talking about a father's advice
[1:25:47] to his son for the Commandment is a lamp
[1:25:50] and the law is light and reproofs of
[1:25:52] instruction are the way of life
[1:25:54] life and here's part of what this will
[1:25:58] protect you from to keep thee from the
[1:26:01] evil woman from the flattery of the
[1:26:03] tongue of a strange woman lust not after
[1:26:07] her beauty in thine heart neither let
[1:26:09] her take thee with her
[1:26:12] eyelids Solomon certainly was an expert
[1:26:15] in this area back to our text this time
[1:26:18] in the ESV is a language is a bit easier
[1:26:20] to follow as Joseph
[1:26:22] speaks after a time his m Piper's Wife
[1:26:25] cast her eyes on Joseph and said lie
[1:26:29] with
[1:26:30] me potier was a powerful man he may have
[1:26:33] been a poor husband but this isn't just
[1:26:35] about hormones or having an affair with
[1:26:38] a hired help she wants to dominate
[1:26:40] Joseph she wants to be in control
[1:26:42] manipulate him and maintain her
[1:26:44] self-image of
[1:26:48] irresistibility but Joseph much to her
[1:26:52] surprise bewilderment and embarrassment
[1:26:55] refused and said to his master's
[1:26:57] wife
[1:26:59] behold because of me Integrity honesty
[1:27:04] trustworthiness my master Piper has no
[1:27:06] concern about anything in the house he's
[1:27:09] put everything everything that he has in
[1:27:12] my charge he's not greater in his own
[1:27:16] house than I am nor has he kept back
[1:27:19] anything from me except you because you
[1:27:22] are his wife how then can I do this
[1:27:25] great wickedness against my master pfer
[1:27:28] and sin against
[1:27:31] God Joseph's God his religion is not the
[1:27:35] Egyptian religion with its many gods and
[1:27:37] goddesses and elaborate rituals he's a
[1:27:40] foreigner his God is foreign to the
[1:27:42] Egyptians and Joseph even as a slave
[1:27:45] torn from his home still worships and
[1:27:48] believes in the god of his
[1:27:51] fathers but he is also a hormonal young
[1:27:55] man in his mid 20s lonely subject to all
[1:27:59] the thoughts and desires that go with
[1:28:00] that and here's a beautiful woman urging
[1:28:04] him to satisfy his own longings and
[1:28:06] telling what he probably wants to hear
[1:28:09] you can be sure he was tempted as we
[1:28:12] read in Psalms God was testing him all
[1:28:15] the while Joseph isn't an angel he's
[1:28:20] human but he knows to give in would be
[1:28:23] wrong
[1:28:24] his final argument is that it would
[1:28:26] displease God so he
[1:28:29] resists another good lesson for us in
[1:28:32] whatever circumstances we find ourselves
[1:28:35] to trust in God and not willfully sin
[1:28:37] against him resist Temptations to sin
[1:28:42] resist means active engagement
[1:28:46] fighting I've never had to resist taking
[1:28:48] street drugs I've never taken them and
[1:28:50] never had any desire to they have no
[1:28:53] Allure or hold on me but other things in
[1:28:56] my life were Temptations I've had to
[1:28:59] fight to
[1:29:01] resist not always
[1:29:04] successfully and as she spoke to Joseph
[1:29:08] day after day relentlessly pursuing him
[1:29:11] he would not listen to her to lie beside
[1:29:15] her or to be with
[1:29:17] her you can be sure Mrs P was a
[1:29:20] beautiful Egyptian woman she was a
[1:29:22] mistress of the Palace of a very
[1:29:24] powerful and feared senior Egyptian
[1:29:26] official she was accustomed to getting
[1:29:29] her way no one denied her
[1:29:33] anything Joseph is painstakingly
[1:29:35] avoiding her avoiding any situation that
[1:29:38] could lead to her winning this battle
[1:29:41] whether by her strength his weakness or
[1:29:45] both battling day after day she was
[1:29:50] persistent she saw Joseph was carefully
[1:29:53] avoiding her her traps yet she was
[1:29:55] constantly coming on to him it's only
[1:29:58] reasonable the other servants in the
[1:30:00] house saw and heard and knew it was
[1:30:02] going
[1:30:03] on Joseph may not have been the first
[1:30:05] young man she went about to seduce but
[1:30:07] Joseph was probably the first to not
[1:30:10] fall for her WS or be threatened by her
[1:30:13] position to comply with her
[1:30:17] demands the struggle goes
[1:30:20] on it came to pass about this time that
[1:30:24] Joseph went into the house to do his
[1:30:25] business and there was none of the men
[1:30:28] of the house there
[1:30:31] within
[1:30:32] coincidence or had Mrs P instructed them
[1:30:35] to hide themselves or sent them to go do
[1:30:38] some task that we get them away from
[1:30:39] being near her when she saw or knew
[1:30:41] Joseph was on his
[1:30:42] way Joseph was being very careful to
[1:30:46] never be alone with
[1:30:47] her he managed the routine of the house
[1:30:50] so he was no doubt surprised caught off
[1:30:53] guard when entered the house and no one
[1:30:56] else was
[1:30:58] visible and Mrs potier caught him by His
[1:31:01] Garment she grabbed she seized his Kilt
[1:31:05] saying lie with
[1:31:07] me and Joseph left His Garment in her
[1:31:09] hand and fled and got out escaped to the
[1:31:13] outside the image on the right of the
[1:31:16] slide is from a tomb of a noble about
[1:31:19] Joseph's time the noble is standing next
[1:31:22] to his wife he can see her hand around
[1:31:23] around his waist and you can see how
[1:31:25] he's
[1:31:27] dressed you may have seen art depicting
[1:31:29] Joseph wearing a cloak or a robe or some
[1:31:32] turbine some heavy medieval
[1:31:35] stuff a lot of Renaissance artists
[1:31:37] thought that Egypt was in northern
[1:31:39] Europe I
[1:31:41] think they didn't dress like that in
[1:31:45] Egypt so Mrs P was grabbing at nothing
[1:31:50] more than the short cotton or linen
[1:31:52] skirt or Kilt
[1:31:54] when he ran out of the palace he was
[1:31:57] almost certainly wearing
[1:32:00] nothing and it came to pass when she saw
[1:32:04] that Joseph had left His Garment in her
[1:32:05] hand she had a tight grip on it as he
[1:32:08] pulled himself
[1:32:10] away and was fled forth out of the house
[1:32:12] he was
[1:32:14] gone and she was a woman
[1:32:17] scorned she called unto the men of her
[1:32:20] house and spake unto them saying
[1:32:24] see she shows him Joseph's skirt pfer
[1:32:28] brought an in Hebrew one to us to mock
[1:32:32] to make fun of us laugh at us he he came
[1:32:35] in unto me to to to lie with me to force
[1:32:38] himself on me and I cried with a loud
[1:32:41] voice when he came at me I
[1:32:44] screamed she's rehearsing the story she
[1:32:46] wants the servants to provide to back up
[1:32:48] her later
[1:32:49] accusations the verse tells us she
[1:32:51] didn't shout when she called the men she
[1:32:53] didn't have to raise her voice they
[1:32:55] weren't very far away at the end she
[1:32:57] claims that she cried with a loud voice
[1:33:00] if what she was telling them was true
[1:33:02] the men would have already been there
[1:33:04] and she would have not had to call for
[1:33:05] them she would have been pushing and
[1:33:07] fighting not holding on to Joseph's Kilt
[1:33:10] not trying to keep him
[1:33:12] there in other words she was saying
[1:33:16] here's the
[1:33:17] deal as you can see this is that Hebrew
[1:33:20] Joseph's Kilt he came in here to attack
[1:33:23] me but
[1:33:24] screamed yeah I know you never heard me
[1:33:26] scream but I
[1:33:28] did what you heard me when I just now
[1:33:31] asked you to come you must have been
[1:33:32] distracted or something because remember
[1:33:34] if you're asked I screamed and that's
[1:33:37] when you came running got
[1:33:42] it and it came to pass when Joseph heard
[1:33:45] that I was
[1:33:46] screaming he left his garment with me
[1:33:48] and fled and and ran out of the house I
[1:33:51] screamed so loud he ran out and H and
[1:33:54] left his clothing
[1:33:56] behind it's nonsense of course no one
[1:33:59] heard a scream it was her pre-planned
[1:34:02] setup to seduce
[1:34:04] Joseph Joseph expected the servants to
[1:34:07] be around invisible doing their normal
[1:34:09] work routine they weren't and Mrs
[1:34:12] spottier grabbed his skirt and demanded
[1:34:14] that he be with her he ran off while she
[1:34:18] clung to his Egyptian cotton Kilt which
[1:34:22] came off and rabinal Legends asserts was
[1:34:25] torn and she held on while he pulled
[1:34:28] away so she kept Joseph's garment by her
[1:34:31] until potier came
[1:34:35] home and she spake unto her husband
[1:34:37] according to these words
[1:34:40] [Music]
[1:34:41] say the Hebrew servant which which you
[1:34:45] brought onto us he came in to mock
[1:34:49] me what happened it's all your fault
[1:34:52] poer you brought this disgusting slave
[1:34:56] into our house and made him your
[1:34:57] personal
[1:34:59] servant look what he did when he saw his
[1:35:02] chance he came on to me that nasty
[1:35:04] filthy
[1:35:05] Hebrew it came to pass as I lifted up my
[1:35:08] voice and screamed he left his garment
[1:35:11] with me it fled
[1:35:15] out it came to pass when pfer heard the
[1:35:19] words of his wife which she spake unto
[1:35:22] him saying after this man did thy
[1:35:25] servant to me that his wrath was
[1:35:32] kindled and Joseph's Master took him and
[1:35:36] that's for next
[1:35:40] time what can we take away from this
[1:35:42] that can help us
[1:35:44] today Joseph was in a terrible situation
[1:35:48] he'd been treated evily by his brothers
[1:35:51] and by the
[1:35:52] ishmaelites yet he was
[1:35:54] successful in spite of it all the
[1:35:57] musicians would would please
[1:35:59] come Paul tells us in Romans
[1:36:03] 1221 be not overcome of evil Joseph but
[1:36:08] overcome evil with
[1:36:11] good his situation with Mrs P reminds us
[1:36:16] not only of Solomon's admonition in
[1:36:19] Proverbs but of the wisdom which Paul
[1:36:21] expressed in his letter to the
[1:36:23] Thessalonians
[1:36:24] 1 Thessalonians 5:22 were told abstain
[1:36:27] from all appearance of evil don't enable
[1:36:30] it right Joseph was careful to be sure
[1:36:35] others were around whenever he was in
[1:36:37] the house never alone with Mrs P a few
[1:36:42] verses earlier Paul tells those in
[1:36:45] thessalonia
[1:36:46] thessalonica see that none render evil
[1:36:49] for evil unto any man but ever follow
[1:36:53] that which is good both among yourselves
[1:36:57] and to all
[1:36:58] men Rejoice ever
[1:37:00] more pray without
[1:37:03] ceasing in
[1:37:05] everything give
[1:37:07] thanks this is the will of God in Christ
[1:37:10] Jesus concerning you this is good advice
[1:37:14] we see it at work in Joseph's life in
[1:37:18] all situations good or bad God's will is
[1:37:22] that we follow for that which is good
[1:37:25] that we Rejoice that we pray and that we
[1:37:28] give
[1:37:29] thanks even when things seem
[1:37:32] insurmountable the
[1:37:34] situation
[1:37:36] impossible like Joseph is once again

[1:44:12] Stephanie and I were out walking the
[1:44:14] other
[1:44:16] day and we were talking about talking
[1:44:19] about brother ly's sermon last Wednesday
[1:44:21] and talking about um what I preached on
[1:44:26] on
[1:44:28] Sunday and I said honey these people
[1:44:31] these
[1:44:32] prophets these great Servants of God
[1:44:35] they were just like you and me I said
[1:44:37] we've learned
[1:44:38] that and Stephanie said she said but
[1:44:42] there's one big
[1:44:43] difference she said they've suffered
[1:44:46] they suffered a lot more than any of us
[1:44:49] have ever
[1:44:50] suffered and you wonder why they had
[1:44:53] such great
[1:44:55] character I have nothing else Fit For A
[1:44:58] King except this Hallelujah imagine
[1:45:01] Joseph down there in that
[1:45:02] well imagine Joseph these people that
[1:45:05] hate hate
[1:45:06] him not because of because of Joseph but
[1:45:10] because he was a Hebrew and they were
[1:45:13] ishmaelites and that rivalry between
[1:45:16] Isaac and ishmail comes all the way down
[1:45:18] to today and we see that hatred that
[1:45:20] that is just as prevalent today as it
[1:45:22] was when Joseph was there look at what
[1:45:24] happened in our day brother ly so
[1:45:27] eloquently said it they said they hate
[1:45:29] you they hated Joseph and they didn't
[1:45:33] care if it was 20 pieces of silver they
[1:45:35] didn't care if if his dad would have
[1:45:36] paid him more and look what they did a
[1:45:38] year
[1:45:39] ago to the
[1:45:42] Hebrews and look at how they made them
[1:45:44] suffer and look at look at the the
[1:45:47] ruthlessness it's not nothing's changed
[1:45:51] that rivalry is still here
[1:45:53] brother L thank you so
[1:45:55] much for showing us
[1:45:58] that makes it makes makes it so
[1:46:01] plain these prophets wow what a hard
[1:46:06] life Mrs P what a nasty woman you know
[1:46:11] and and what a
[1:46:13] great young
[1:46:15] man with with such character and I love
[1:46:19] what brother Lyall said that Mrs P this
[1:46:21] probably wasn't her first time
[1:46:25] Joseph he didn't fall for it God bless
[1:46:29] his loyal
[1:46:31] heart that
[1:46:33] character that is in these prophets I
[1:46:37] believe we can have that same character
[1:46:39] we may not suffer as much as they
[1:46:43] suffer and I know when we suffer boy
[1:46:46] it's it's hard on us but it does build
[1:46:49] character
[1:46:53] I
[1:46:54] am yeah amen all I have is a Hallelujah
[1:46:59] to give to the
[1:47:01] Lord I want to continue on with these
[1:47:04] great characters in The
[1:47:06] Bible Well um the L will come to the the
[1:47:11] last chapter of Joseph the Lord's
[1:47:13] willing next
[1:47:14] Wednesday and then we'll start up I
[1:47:16] might try to pull on brother Aaron a
[1:47:18] little bit more maybe you can help out
[1:47:20] in some of these lessons maybe some
[1:47:22] mothers could help on u in teaching
[1:47:26] about these these men of God and one
[1:47:29] thing that's been on my heart and I
[1:47:32] would like the
[1:47:34] church um to give me some feedback on
[1:47:37] this brother Jordan and I were talking
[1:47:39] before
[1:47:41] service and uh he told me something that
[1:47:44] that has been on my heart for a long
[1:47:46] time and and we did it a little bit on
[1:47:48] Sunday night but I would like to take a
[1:47:51] topic
[1:47:53] that you might not
[1:47:55] understand that and it could be it could
[1:47:58] be personal
[1:47:59] finances it could be
[1:48:02] music it could be it could be different
[1:48:05] translations of the Bible something that
[1:48:07] you don't
[1:48:09] understand that that would help you if
[1:48:12] if you did have a better understanding
[1:48:14] of it why do we do certain things rather
[1:48:17] Christians do certain things as long as
[1:48:20] it's bible-based um
[1:48:23] bring it tell one of the deacons or or
[1:48:26] tell one of the brothers tell Daniel and
[1:48:30] get the message to me and maybe we could
[1:48:32] devote a service here and there a
[1:48:35] Wednesday night to talking about these
[1:48:38] questions that you might have these
[1:48:41] subjects in the Bible and I and I could
[1:48:42] go through different places um that they
[1:48:46] are in the Bible and and help you to
[1:48:49] understand because you got to understand
[1:48:52] it'll help
[1:48:54] you and and just
[1:48:57] because the Pastor said so it doesn't
[1:48:59] cut it it's because brother brandom said
[1:49:04] so you need more you need to really
[1:49:07] understand these things so if you have
[1:49:10] something on your heart tell one of the
[1:49:12] brothers and and they can get it to me
[1:49:14] and give me some time to pray about it
[1:49:17] and and time to study on it and we can
[1:49:20] do some of those subjects
[1:49:22] I I would like um would you like to do
[1:49:25] that does it sound like a good
[1:49:28] idea I hope so um if it doesn't it won't
[1:49:32] do it but I I think um I wish somebody
[1:49:36] would have I wish I'd have had something
[1:49:37] like that when I was a
[1:49:39] kid um and I could just say you know I
[1:49:42] just I just don't understand I don't
[1:49:45] understand why we do these things I
[1:49:48] don't understand where in the Bible are
[1:49:51] my are is and divorce how come we don't
[1:49:54] believe in divorce we see it in
[1:49:57] Deuteronomy we see it in different
[1:49:59] places why do we not believe in it you
[1:50:02] know when I'm when I'm when I want to
[1:50:04] get
[1:50:05] married what type of a of a man or what
[1:50:09] type of a woman should I marry and where
[1:50:11] is that in the
[1:50:13] Bible whatever it is it's on your heart
[1:50:16] and I know that I know we'll be blessed
[1:50:18] by the brothers and bringing out these
[1:50:21] different characters in The Bible and I
[1:50:24] I want to be a good pastor I want to be
