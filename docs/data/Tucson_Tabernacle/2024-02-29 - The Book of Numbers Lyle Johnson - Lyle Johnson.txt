hand I claim the blood Jesus shed on calary those preious blood stains were made there just for me for all my sin my sickness and my pain when I I clim those preious blood [Music] stains amen amen is that what you claim that's what I claim I'm claiming it tonight thank you so much tonight we'll be taking a look at the book we call numbers in Hebrew it's called bumed Bal in the desert Exodus was the story of Israel coming to Mount Si Leviticus was the story of Israel at Mount Si numbers is largely the story of Israel going from Mount Si it's a challenging study we see God getting frustrated with Moses and with the people we see the people getting frustrated with God and with Moses we see Moses getting frustrated with God and the people if we run a bit long tonight I hope you won't be frustrated with me let's invite the author to be with us once again and help us Lord Jesus we do claim those precious blood stains for healing Lord you said If any man lack wisdom to ask Lord we're looking looking for wisdom we're looking for insight we're looking for the life of this book through that blood to come to us Lord we desire to be conformed to your image we desire to be obedient we desire to be your children Lord that you love we desire to bring a smile to your face forgive us Lord where we fall short be with us this evening thank you Lord accept our praise our worship and be with us as we look into your word Jesus said that if they had known the words of Moses they would have known me and these are the words of Moses help us tonight Lord and we thank you in Jesus name amen we'll look to the gospels to set the stage for our study this evening one from a parable about an Unfaithful Steward and the other a prophecy about persecutions of witnesses for Christ Luke 12:47 he says and that servant which knew his Lord's will and prepared not himself neither did according do his will shall be beaten with many stripes but he that knew not and did commit things worthy of Stripes shall be beaten with few stripes for unto whomsoever much is given of him shall be much required and to whom men have committed much of him they will ask the more and going to John's gospel chapter 15: 22 Jesus said if I had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sin but now they have no covering for their sin we'll see a huge contrast between the relationship of God and the nation going to Mount Si that we saw in Exodus and Israel coming from Mount Si contain in the Book of Numbers please be seated The Book of Numbers consists of three parallel accounts three kinds of things are are going on here one is a kind of a travelogue it's telling where the nation traveled some of the things that happened along the way it's full of lessons for us to observe and take to heart I do mean full another is a census actually more than one of the people by their ancestry or tribe the last is additional laws that God gave at different times and I include this part where Moses tells the camp how to be arranged when how to March when they go to their Journeys and so forth perhaps those aren't actually laws but they're certainly instructions to add to the mix to the challenge the account is not chronological for example numbers 1:1 takes place on the first day of the second month of the second year but numbers 91 nine chapters in takes place on the first day of the month of the second year two to four weeks earlier than the first verse of the first chapter so it's a little bit of a challenge you can't just sort of knot off and go to sleep please don't knot off and go to sleep we'll study tonight proceeding through the book digging in here and there as we go we'll be reading a lot a lot from the Bible makes sense after all this is a Bible study and I'm glad to see enough of you sitting up front I'm sorry I don't have any little tiny print Maps tonight but thank you for sitting up front remember what we're looking for we're looking for Jesus Christ of the New Testament as Jehovah god of the Old Testament keeping in mind our opening verses where Jesus expects us to grow and mature and take on responsibility will be reading Moses seeing Jesus Paul tells us pretty much the same thing in 1 Corinthians 13 He says when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I grew up I put away childish things in Exodus Israel's a child but after Leviticus because here in numbers more is expected of Israel there are lessons for us too consider Paul's encouragement to Timothy in his very last letter second Timothy chapter 3 he says to Timothy and that from a child thou Hast known the holy scriptures the the very ones that we're studying tonight which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Jesus Christ all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness why that the man of God may be perfect that means complete thoroughly furnished unto all good arguments and debates no to all good works with that background and guidance let's take a look at numbers Numbers Chapter 1 is a census of Israel's Warriors it comes out to 63,000 men aged 20 and up and plus Levites the tribe of Levi are not considered Warriors they're not part of that group but they numbered them from age one month and up all the male and there was a total of 22,300 of them this is a large group of people chapter 2 details the arrangement of the camp now the they've built the Tabernacle now those of you that are up front are happy you're up front I hope so this shows the Tabernacle in the middle the dark blue around them are the Levites and the mo and the uh priests and Moses and you notice there's a little L3 I put these L's and lzs and rs and stuff l means that Leia Leah was the mother of that tribe uh the R means that Rachel was the mother the LZ means that zilha Leah's slave was the mother and the RB means that bilha Rachel slave was the mother and and you'll notice here on the East the camp of Judah it's Judah isachar and Zebulon those are the fourth fifth and six Sons of Leah after them go uh these folks marari and gersan those are two of the three sons of Levi and they're the ones that carried the Tabernacle and the post and some of the stuff from the outside of the Tabernacle following them we have Ruben Simeon and God you'll notice that all of these are related to Leah and then finally we get Kath which are carrying the sacred items from within the Tabernacle they're Then followed by the ones that came from Rachel Ephraim and Manasseh I had them as r1a and B because they're descendants of Joseph and Benjamin and then finally is the camp of Dan and you notice that they are all children through the slaves and that's the order they March Judah marari and gersam then the camp of Ruben the south camp the rest of the Levites and the rest of the Tabernacles then the west camp Rachel's and finally the north camp and led from there so each of those four camps and marches in their birth order there won't be a test it's okay chapter 3 lists the sons of Aaron tells of the general duties of the Levites and describes the Redemption of the firstborn chapter four details the duties of the coites the gershonites and the meites the lines of the three sons of Levi and it tells us that for all of these groups and it list their their jobs that they start to work at age 30 and they retire at age 50 uh so people say well there's no retirement in the Bible well there is for Levites in chapter 5 are laws regarding unclean people confession and restitution and a test for adultery chapter 6 tells about the Nazarite vow and Aaron's blessing we often hear about the Nazarite vow uh Samson is probably one of the most familiar characters in the Bible that is involved with that the intent of a person taking this vow is one of total separation of that person to God for a period of time and don't confuse Nazarite a vow of Separation with Nazarene which is a person from Nazareth today in Hebrew uh Christians are called not which is the Hebrew way of saying nazarenes and and then there's the blessing of the high priest did I go one too far I was supposed to have deleted those I'm sorry here we go the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons saying on this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel saying unto them the Lord bless thee and keep keep Thee the Lord make his face shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace and they shall put my name upon the children of Israel and I will bless them verse 27 here describes what happened last Sunday morning dedicating young children and babies to the Lord chapter 7 list the offerings of the the Tabernacle congre at the time of the Tabernacle consecration when is completed this takes place on the first day of the first month of the second year according to Exodus chapter 40 chapter 8 discusses some things in in inside the Tabernacle the seven lamps discusses the cleansing of the Levites getting them ready to serve into the Tabernacle and it talks about the retirement of the Levites but here is a little interesting thing that it says that the ages are 25 to 30 25 to 50 not 25 to 30 so the way I looked at that was at age 25 to 30 is like an apprenticeship then age 30 when they're carrying this Stu then they become Journey men okay that didn't go over very well I don't do that again okay up until here we're still at Mount Si in chapter nine the Passover is celebrated the 14th day of the first month of the second year after leaving Egypt chapter 10 the last items to be manufactured for the journey are two silver trumpets as soon as a Passover ends the tent is packed the congregation moves out on the 20th day of the second month of the second year there's a definite order of the camp and we just discussed that but we see here that God is a god of order speaking of how worship should be conducted in the church Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians Ians 14 let all things be done decently and in order and telling Titus in chapter 1 he tells cus this is the reason I left you in cre that you should set in order the things that are wanting and ordain elders and every city is I had appointed thee well they go three days journey and then we begin chapter 11 recall in Exodus after crossing the red see the the last verse in Exodus 14 tells us that the people believed the Lord and they believed his servant Moses only three days later after they've crossed the Red Sea they've sung a song of Celebration they walk for three days and they come to a place in the waters bitter and the Lord that they believed and Moses that they believed they start murmuring and complaining what are we gonna do what are we going to drink what you bring us here for don't you have a map but what happens they're murmuring and complaining the Lord chose Moses to throw something in the water heals the water they have good water to drink and everything's okay there's no repercussions if you will but Leviticus they read the law at SI and now numbers 11 3 days after packing up the Tabernacle three days journey it's sorry these were this is a different file then uh I I apologize numbers 11 verse1 when the people complained it displeased the Lord doesn't tell us what they complained about the Lord heard it we're told and his anger was kindled and the fire of the Lord burnt among them and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp and the people Cried unto Moses and Moses prayed un to the Lord and the fire was quenched but this didn't really seem to get their attention back in Exodus 16 about a month after leaving Egypt they apparently ran out of food and complained that the Lord had led us into the Wilderness to starve God sent them Quail that evening and Mana started appearing the very next morning and would do so for the next 39 years but in numbers after Mount Si numbers uh chapter 11 verse 4 and the mixed multitude that was among them fell austing and the children of Israel also wept again and said who shall give us flesh to eat we remember the fish which we did eat in Egypt freely the the cucumbers and the melons and and the leaks and the onions and the garlic but now our souls dried away there's nothing it all be because of this Mana before our eyes I'm tired of this plan for day after day meal after meal no seasoning to give it flavor there's no Variety in our diet I need [Music] prot skipping down to verse 18 the Lord tells Moses say thou unto the people sanctify yourselves against tomorrow you shall eat flesh for you have wept in the ears of the Lord saying who shall give us flesh to eat for it was well with us in Egypt therefore the Lord will give you flesh and you'll eat you'll not just eat one day or two days or 5 days or 10 days or 20 days but even a whole month until it come out at your nostrils and it be lome unto you because that you have despised the Lord which is among you and have wept before him saying why did we come out of Egypt it wasn't because you were slaves it wasn't because Pharaoh was giving you hard time no okay no skipping down to verse 31 there went forth a wind from the Lord and brought quailes from the sea and let them fall by the camp as it were a Day's Journey on this side and a Day's Journey on that side how far you can walk in a day that's how wide this band of quailes was round about the camp and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the Earth three feet deep that's a lot of quail and the people stood up all that day and all that night and all the next day and they gathered the quailes he that gathered least gathered 10 rers you know how much that is 50 bushels the least that a person gathered was 50 bushels 50 bushels 30 day one and two3 bushels of quail per day that's a lot and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp to dry the meat to preserve it and while the flesh was yet between their teeth before it was chewed the Wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people and the Lord smote the people with a very great plague and he called the name of that place Kata atava because there they buried the people that lustered that means Graves of the longing in the first case going to SI God took care of them put up with their whining and the second one going from SI God dealt harshly to show them their foolishness lack of faith rather than being thankful for the miraculous provision in a desert Wilderness that people complained that it wasn't good enough there in the midst of a miracle what we commanded rather than complain Paul tells us in Philippians 4 be careful be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication petition with Thanksgiving let your requests be known unto God God in the verses we skipped in numbers 11 the Lord told Moses to gather 70 leaders and the Lord will divide from the spirit of Moses unto them Moses was complaining about how hard his job was and this happens these 70 leaders come and they prophesy we see a parallel here where Jesus early on sent 70 disciples out to spread the gospel or in Pentecost where the spirit divides over the 120 in the upper room but two of the 70 in numbers didn't gather with the others but were elsewhere in the camp and they prophesied too let's pick this up for yet another parallel with the New Testament numbers 11:26 there remained two of the men whose names were on the list of TW of 70 in the camp the name of the one was eldad the name of the other Maad and the spirit rested upon them and they were of them that were written but went not unto the Tabernacle even though they'd been directed to go there and they prophesied in the camp and there ran a young man and told Moses and said Moses Moses El dad and M dad they're prophesying in the camp and Joshua the son of nun the servant of Moses one of his young young man answered and said my Lord Moses forbid them Moses said unto him envest thou for my sake would God that all the Lord's people were prophets and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them 70 is a good start we got another few hundred thousand out here that can handle a little help here too it reminds us of Jesus words to John in the Gospel of Luke we read Luke 9 and John no doubt looking for approval answered and said Master we saw one casting out devils in thy name we stopped him we forbat him because he didn't follow with us he's not part of our group he's not part of our little elected group in the corner over here he's one of those other people out there Jesus said unto him forbid him not he that's not against us is for us it's a good lesson for us as as well God is not limited to our group well in the very next chapter chapter 12 we read that moses' two siblings Aaron and Miriam they got upset with him I'll read this from the NIV has the Lord spoken only through Moses they Aaron and Miriam asked hasn't he also spoken through us and the Lord heard this verse four at once once the Lord said to Moses Aaron and Miriam come out to the tent of meeting all three of you so the three of them went out the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud he stood at the entrance to the tent and summoned Aaron and Miriam when the two of them stepped forward he said listen to my words when there's a prophet among you I the Lord reveal myself to them in Visions I speak to them in dreams but this is not true of my servant Moses he is faithful in all my house with him I speak face to face clearly not in riddles he sees the form of the Lord why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses the anger of the Lord burned against them and he left them Miriam was stricken with Leprosy for seven days after which the encampment packed up and moved on chapter 13 opens with the congregation making their way to a mysterious location called Kadesh barnea I say mysterious because archaeologists and Bible scholars if you pick eight different maps and they aren't all published from the same company they'll have kades barnea and in eight different locations so this kades Baria we get that name from numbers 328 is in the wilderness of pan we get that from numbers 133 well there's 12 men that are sent once they get there Moses says I want 12 of you guys one from each trive go up this way go up through the South go spy out the land check it out what are we facing when we cross over there is it a good place is it a less good place bring us back the report let us know what's going on so they go out there to spy out the land and report back after 40 days they return numbers 13 and they returned from searching of the land after 40 days and they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel unto the Wilderness of pan to Kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and and showed them the fruit of the land and they told him and said we came into the land where you sent us surely it flows with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it however nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land the cities are walled and very great moreover we saw the children of anch there the amalekites dwell in the land of the South the Hittites the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains Canaanites dwell by the Sea and by the coast of Jordan people are starting to get a little unhappy here Caleb Steed the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it we're well able to overcome it but the men that went up with them said we be not able to go up against the people they're stronger than we are and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel chapter 14 opens with the reaction of the people to this report and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried the people wept that night and all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron the whole congregation said unto them what God we had died in the land of Egypt or what God we had died in this Wilderness and wherefore hath the Lord brought us into this land to Fall by the sword our wives children should be a prey were it not better for us to return unto Egypt they said to one another let's make a captain and let's return into Egypt excuse me to go to Pharaoh the guy that sent his army to kill all of you 40 years ago his sword these swords what's the difference oh maybe he let you be slaves again under cruel taskmasters that'd be fun what a brilliant idea then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assmbly of the congregation of the children of Israel and Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the son of jauna which were of them that searched the land rent their clothes and they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel saying the land which we pass through to search it it's an exceedingly good land if the Lord Delight in US he'll bring us into this land and give it us a land which flows with milk and honey only rebell ye not not against the Lord neither fear ye the people of the land they're but bread for us their defenses departed from them The Lord Is With Us fear them not the congregation's reaction was let's Stone these guys what's the lord's reaction the glory of the Lord appeared in the Tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel and the lord said unto Moses how long will this people provoke me how long will it be before they believe me for all the signs which I have showed among them I will Smite them with the pestilence disinherit them and I'll make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they let's flash back to the people complaining in numbers 11 about flesh to eat we we skipped these verses earlier numbers 11 verse 10 then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families oh you what quail every man in the door of his tent and the anger of the Lord was kindled greatly Moses also was displeased Moses said to the Lord wherefore hast thou Afflicted thy servant wherefore have I not found favor in thy sight that thou layest the burden of this people on me have I conceived all this people have I begotten them that thou should as say unto me carry them in thy bosom as a nursing father beareth a sucking child unto the land which thou sawest unto their fathers once should I have flesh to give unto all this people for they weep unto me saying give us flesh that we may eat I'm not able to Bear all this people alone it's too heavy for me if thou deal thus with me kill me I pray thee out of hand if I found favor in thy sight let me not see my wretchedness Moses is one frustrated upset depressed individual but watch Moses here back in numbers 14 God said step aside he'll destroy them all and replace them with Moses descendants reading Moses seeing Jesus numbers 14:13 Moses said unto the Lord oh then the Egyptians will hear it for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them and and and and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land for they have heard that the Lord that thou Lord art amongst this people that thou Lord art seen face to face and that thy Cloud standeth over them and that thou goest before them by day by daytime and a pillar of a cloud and in a pillar of Fire by night now if if if Thou shalt kill all this people as one man then the Nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak saying because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land which he swear unto them therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness now I beseech thee let the power of my Lord be great according as thou has spoken saying back in Exodus 34 the Lord is longsuffering and of great Mercy forgiving iniquity and transgression and by no means clearing the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation pardon I beseech Thee the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy as thou has forgiven this people from Egypt even until now reading Moses seeing Jesus pleading for the people and the Lord said I have pardoned according to Thy word but as truly as I live all the Earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord because all those men which have seen my glory and my Miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness and have tempted me now these 10 times and have not hearkened to my voice 10 times how many plagues were in Egypt that's a clue 10 yeah just like Pharaoh 10 plagues 10 rejections 10 testing t 10 tempting surely they shall not see the land which I swear unto their fathers neither shall any of them that provoked me see it skipping to verse 26 the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying how long shall I bear with this evil congregation which murmur against me I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel which they murmur against me say unto them as truly as I live saith the Lord as ye have spoken in my ears so will I do to you I'm going to give you exact exactly what you asked for I heard you and I'm going to respond the way you asked me to that we would die in the wilderness right your carcasses that's a pretty blunt word your carcasses shall fall in this Wilderness and all that were numbered of you according to your whole number from 20 years old and upward which have murmured against me doubtless ye shall not come into the land concerning which I swear to make you dwell therein except Caleb the son of jauna and Joshua the son of nun but your little ones which you said would be a prey them will I bring in and they shall know the land which you have despised verse 35 I the Lord have said I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation that are gathered together against me in this Wilderness they shall be consumed and there they shall die wow and this next verse is a part that we often Overlook and the men the spies which Moses sent to search the land who returned and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up a slander upon the land even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land died by the plague before the Lord they were given special treatment but Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the son of jauno which were of the men that went to search the land lived still reminds me of a service recently we talked a little bit about not we but brother Daniel I believe was talked a little bit about from Solomon saying seven things that the Lord hates he that puts Discord among the Brethren these 10 guys Discord amongst the whole congregation the next day the people say oops we're sorry we we'll go take the land now Moses told him not going to work guys it's too late God's pronounced judgment done deal but skipping to verse 44 but they presumed to go up unto the hilltop nevertheless the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and Moses departed not out of the camp then the amalekites came down and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill and smote them and discomforted them even unto Horna compare that back in Exodus 17 before SI when they were attacked by amalec and defeated them now amalec defeats the tribe of Israel chapter 15 opens with laws about sacrifices laws about unintentional sins and then something happens let's flash back in our thinking to Exodus when Mana first appeared as food in Exodus 16 Moses told the people that on Friday they should gather a little extra and it wouldn't spoil the next day as it otherwise would on the Sabbath but don't go looking for it on the Sabbath because there won't be any but some of the people went out on the Sabbath anyway they came back empty-handed but there was no punishment for that Disobedience was before they had come to SI now in numbers after Mount Si I apologize here I had the wrong while the children of Israel were in the wilderness they found a man that gathered sticks upon the Sabbath day and they that found him Gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron and unto all the congregation and they put him in Ward they they locked him up they secured him because it was not declared what should be done to him and the Lord said unto Moses The man shall surely be put to death all the congregation shall Stone him with stones outside the camp and all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him with stones and he died as the Lord had commanded it's a different relationship here and now a new regulation then comes from the Lord to wear tassels on their garments he tells them it's a reminder to follow the Commandments not suggestions Commandments of the Lord I'm reminded of a story brother green sometimes told of his times with brother brandham he noticed brother brandham had a cross hanging from the rearview mirror of his car brother brandham told Brother green that it was to remind him of the Lord very much like the tassels here that we read about in Numbers chapter 16 details a rebellion led by a group of Levites whose leader was Kora oh I really apologize here because the PDF I think that's the one you want yeah the the PDF I I'm I apologize for all this I I won't go into the technical details but we are having technical difficulties please be patient fasten your seat belts it's numbers 16 verse1 is the slide I'd like to pick up I am normally better prepared thank you I was this was a different experience preparing for tonight and so up until 5 o'clock this evening I was still putting things together which is my excuse for having this messed up thank you brother Jordan now Kora the son of ishar the son of Kath the son of Levi so he's a levite and he's and he's uh of the kath group the ones that carry the most important objects of the Tabernacle when they move and Dayan and abam the sons of elab and on the son of pel Sons of Reuben took men and they rose up before Moses with certain of the children of the congregation of Israel 250 princes of the assembly famous and the congregation well-known men and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and said unto them you take too much upon you seeing all the congregation Are Holy they must not have remembered what happened with Aaron and Miriam every one of them and the Lord is among them wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the lord we see jealousy people dissatisfied with how things are going and seeing opportunity arguing that they're holy Sanctified by obedience to the law and their leader is the same Branch as Moses the line of Kath son of Levi there's 250 of these folks they Rebel God separates them destroys them of an earthquake it says that the Earth swallows them up a plague then breaks out and another 14,700 people perish it it take too long to go any further details about this tonight I encourage you to read this chapter in chapter 17 God has each tribe write their name on a rod with Aaron's name on the rod representing Levi the rods are placed in the Tabernacle and we find that in the morning Aaron Rod it came to pass that on the tomorrow Moses went into the Tabernacle of witness and behold the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded brought forth Buds and bloomed blossoms and yielded almonds and Moses brought out all the rods from before the Lord unto all the children of Israel and they looked and took every man his rod and the Lord said unto Moses bring Aaron's Rod again before the testimony to be kept for a token against the rebels and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me that they die not doesn't blank but that's okay chapter 18 describes the duties of priests and Levites chapter 19 is about laws for purification chapter 20 opens with the death of Miriam we read that they came to Kadesh and Abode there there but there was no water let's flash back once again to Exodus just before they came to Mount Si they're in a desert Wilderness and there's no water and Moses Cried unto the Lord saying what shall I do unto this people they're almost ready to Stone me and the Lord said unto Moses go on before the people take with thee the Elders of Israel and thy rod that stick wherewith thou SM modus the Nile River and turned it into blood before Pharaoh take that in thine hand and go behold I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb and thou shalt Smite The Rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink and Moses did so in the sight of all the Elders of Israel notice Moses was commanded to go to the rock with his staff and hit the rock in Exodus before Mount Si now here in numbers 20 after Mount Si they are again in a place there to Camp without a source of water let's read and the Lord spake unto Moses saying take the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and Aaron thy brother and speak ye under the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so Thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink and Moses took the rod from before the Lord as he commanded him and Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the Rock and he said unto them here now ye Rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock and Moses lifted up his hand and with his Rod he smot The Rock twice he was told to speak this time not not strike and God honored Moses performed the miracle anyway as the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their beasts also and the Lord was displeased with her Disobedience and spake unto Moses and Aaron because you believed you obeyed you believed me not to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given thee we see that disobedience is equated with unbelief in the Lord's eyes and both Moses and Aaron are denied entry to Canaan even though Moses is the one that hit the rock so there here at Kadesh there are conflicting views whether Israel remained in Kadesh for the next 37 years or that they went on unrecorded wandering this is based on chapter 33 in numbers which lists all the encampments of Israel God told Moses write a list of every stop you made they came to Kadesh one time it's about the third year and then about the final year we're 12 they're leaving Kadesh and they go around Edom so if if either they stayed there for 37 years or they didn't but if they didn't Mo they must have not stopped because Moses didn't record any other stops but if they stayed water flowed from this rock for 37 years so now we jump to the end of the Journeys in this chapter they asked permission of Edom to pass through pass through the land we'll pay for whatever we use Edom says no so they leave Kadesh they head to mount on the border of Edom Aaron dies There They Mourn for 30 days in chapter 21 as they march on a southern Canaanite King named Hamas I mean aod attacks and takes captives sounds like October 7th 2023 Israel seeks revenge and asks the Lord to help them and they completely destroy them in their towns sounds like Gaza today well they continue on South towards modern elot to go around the territory of Edom this is in the opposite direction of their destination from Canaan they're supposed you know well we're supposed to be going north and heading across to the river and now you got us going south oh Moses get a map numbers 21 they journeyed from Mount by the way of the Red Sea so they're going all the way back down to what is modern day elot so they can go around the land of Edom and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way we headed south we're supposed to go north the people spake against God and against Moses wherefore have you brought us out of Egypt to die in the wilderness well God said you were all going to die out here didn't they for there is no bread neither is there any water and our soul loath us this light bread we hate this Mana we're sick and tired of it and the Lord was so happy when he heard that the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of Israel died therefore the people came to Moses and said we have sinned we have spoken against the Lord and and against the pray unto the Lord that he take away the the serpents from us notice the the people came and repented and recognized that Moses had to intercede for them who intercedes for us when we repent parallels Moses prayed for the people and the Lord said unto Moses make thee a fiery serpent set it upon a pole it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten when he lookth upon it shall live and Moses made a serpent of brass put it upon a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld The Serpent of brass he lived this is a symbol of modern medicine it's not in contradiction to the first commandment about having no graven images and so forth it may appear so says you're not to make an image and then worship it The Mercy Seat had two cherubim on the lid images of things of Heaven above numbers tells us that God spoke to Moses from between the cherubim but the cherubim were not objects of worship they were not idols and neither were the serpents God didn't say pray to them when you see them or offer them a sacrifice or worship them he just said in effect look up Jesus said in one of the most famous passages in all the gospels as he taught Nicodemus one evening I wonder maybe it was a Wednesday evening we read in John 3 as Moses lifted up The Serpent and the Wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up reading Moses seeing Jesus that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved well they loop around Edom and start heading north again they seek Passage through the land of the amorites but king sihon attacks them instead they defeat him take his territory King Ang of Bashan is similarly destroyed and Israel occupied those lands as well chapter 22 opens with a very nervous guy named Balo he's king of Moab he sees the Israelites coming and realizes he doesn't have a chance of stopping them so he attempts to enlist the support of a prophet a fellow named balum who lives to the south in near Midian he wants him to curse Israel balum consults the Lord and as a result he refuses to go I'm not going with you guys I don't care what you give me Bayo tries to entice him again God tells balum go but only say what God wants him to say nevertheless God was angry with balum for going to Moab and and on the way the angel of the Lord tries to stop him balam's donkey sees the angel and tries to stop balum doesn't see the angel so he gets down and starts hitting the donkey the donkey then speaks I guess that stops him from hitting the donkey and then balum sees the angel he offers to return home oh I'll I'll head back I don't need to go but the angel says no no no go go go to Moab just only say what you're told to say baam finally arrives at Moab where bik scolds him for not coming sooner balum consistently says he will only say what the Lord tells him in chapter 23 balb offers sacrifices and speaks blessings on Israel much to the displeasure of BAC again B ask him to curse Israel and balam again blesses Israel instead and then in chapter 24 and when balum saw that it pleased the lord to bless Israel he went not as at other times to seek for enchantments but he set his face toward the Wilderness and balum lifted up his eyes and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes and the spirit of God Came Upon him and he took up his Parable and said balum the son of beor hath said the man whose eyes are open hath said Heath said which heard the words of God which saw the vision of the almighty falling into a trance but having his eyes open how goodly are thy tents oh Jacob and thy Tabernacles oh Israel as the valleys are they spread forth as Gardens by the river's side as the Trees of Lian allows which the Lord hath planted as cedar trees beside the waters he shall pour the water out of his buckets and his seed shall be in many Waters his King shall be higher than a gag in his kingdom shall be exalted God brought him for for out of Egypt he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn he shall eat up the Nations his enemies he shall break their bones and Pierce them through with his arrows he couched he laid down as a lion and as a great lion who shall stir him up blessed is he that blesseth thee and cursed is he that curseth the the earlier part of that reads like a Psalm how beautiful ful are thy Tes the latter like Jacob's blessing to Judah about the lion and it ends just like God's promise to Abraham his fourth and final Oracle points to the coming of the Messiah I shall see him but not now I Shall Behold Him but not nigh there shall come a star out of Jacob and a scepter shall rise out of Israel and shall Smite the corners of Moab destroy all the children of sheth Edom shall be a possession sear shall also be possession for his enemies and Israel shall do valiantly out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city balum heads for home bik is not happy reading Moses seeing Jesus in chapter 25 while encamped in the area many in the camp break out into rald rry and start worshiping local Gods worshiping Bal at this location called peor God tells Moses to kill those that worship Baal as he's giving the command at the door of the the Tabernacle one of the men of Israel brazenly takes a woman of Midian into his tent Finos grandson of Aaron kills the man and the woman right there and the Wrath of the Lord is turned away 24,000 are killed God tells Moses destroy Midian for this that'll happen in chapter 31 chapter 26 is a census of the new generation chapter 27 there's a law regarding inheritance some ladies come and say our father died and didn't have a son and what happens to the inheritance and they said the rule was well if a man dies with no son then his daughters get the inheritance if he has no daughters and they go to his brothers and so forth it trickles it down it figures out this whole uh this whole uh inheritance this is in the days before death taxes okay God reminds Moses that he will die I not enter the land Moses asked God to not leave the people without a leader God tells him to have eler anoint Joshua to succeed Moses in a public ceremony which is then performed chapters 28 and 29 describe various offerings Chapter 30 gives rules concerning making vows in the next chapter chapter 31 Moses sends an army of 12,000 to destroy Midian balum is killed in the attack they take the wealth of Midian and the livestock but they also take captives captives which include thousands actually tens of thousands of women which incites Moses anger since the men of Israel being taken with the medanite women was part of the problem back at peor well there's a compromise the items animals and people taken are divided up chapter 32 tells of the descendants of Reuben and God wanting to settle in the already conquered lands we don't need to cross Jordan we like this place they agree to help the rest of the congregation to send their armies to fight and to take the land of Canaan and they're told the well if you do that then you can come back and stay on this side of the Jordan so the terms are agreed upon in chapter 33 Moses is commanded to record the stops made in the journey from Egypt to the banks of the Jordan and reminded that they must drive out the inhabitants in chapter 34 the boundaries of the land are described if you take the time to dig into this you'll find the borders to the south in particular and to the north are kind of fuzzy keep in mind while we think of Nations as having borders that are neat lines drawn on a map and mostly respected in this era there were city states there were Empires the borders were not aligned on a map they didn't have good maps anyway but it was all fuzzy it depend if your army was successful then this was your border but if they pushed you back then it that became your border it was Fuzzy uh so there were boundaries that were fought and shifted all the time one little side note in there is it talks about part of the South border is the river of Egypt and a lot of people think well that's the Nile I I think it's not the Nile and why would you say that brother the L the river of Egypt because if the Nile river forms a border then when they were in Goan they were already in the promised land and Moses who was never going to go in the promised land when they crossed the Red Sea they were in the promised land nearly this whole time the Nile River would be a contradiction anyway that's just W your appetite you say well then what is it well I'll let you go look I I don't want to spoil it for you chapter 35 lists the cities for the Levites and makes provision for what are called Cities of Refuge this this is what we would think of a person's guilty of of of manslaughter or third deegree homicide in other words it's not premeditated it was an accident but somebody got killed the family was going to seek Vengeance for that guy that got killed so the guilty party can flee from the the Vengeance and if he runs faster than they do then he can go into one of these Cities of Refuge and he's safe they can't go after him there but it's only for accidental death numbers ends at chapter 36 with rules regarding marriage of female heirs so now at the end of numbers Israel is now in Moab they're ready to cross the Jordan River and move into the land of promise while in Moab Moses will rehearse their journey in his final writing known as the book of Deuteronomy which brother Daniel will present next Wednesday God willing you'll have noticed that I skipped over the census results and except for that first one in the various laws I wanted to emphasize the difference between the relationship of God with Israel based on faith and Grace as we found in the book of Exodus before Mount Si and contrast with the relationship that's based on Law and urance as Christians the law of God should be written in our hearts if the musicians would please come at this time and we have a high priest to whom we can come who need not offer sacrifices for himself but himself became our one and for all time sacrifice we'll close tonight with with this verse from the apostle Paul Hebrews 7 for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto God and the blessing the Lord bless thee and keep Thee the Lord make his face shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace as brother Aaron comes to close the service let's sing the chorus of the song look and live not to a brass serpent on a pole but to the Christ that bought our freedom to serve him look look and live my brother live look to Jesus now and live is recorded in his word hallelujah it is only that you look and will look and will look to Jesus now and live it's recorded in his word hallelujah it is only that we look and live one more time look and live my brother live look to Jesus now and live it's recorded in his word hallelujah it is only that you look [Music] and you know God never wanted to deal with Israel through the law but but he gave them a law when they asked for a law and he told them this is what you want this is what you're going to get and and to to his bride today it's not by La but we try to make it law because for us it's easier we feel that if we do the law then we've achieved something but when you realize that it's his grace what can wash my sins away nothing but the blood he is able more than able to keep I'm I'm just I'm not sure s which song it is so but it he is able more than able to keep his promise to do what he said it's it's kind of like a child learning and we want them to learn but at the same time you don't want to let go of their hand because they will fall you know but there comes a time when you let go of their hand and they do learn and that's when you set your wings in Winds of faith and God says come on up you know and he just reminds you that every promise in the book is yours everything these were the songs that came to me as as each part came and I just realized God's word is true he is faithful he doesn't you know and if it depends on Works who does the right amount of Works who does the right Works what really pleases God so if you look to Jesus Christ and you live let stand amen let's do a couple of verses of what can wash away my sin nothing but the blood of Jesus oh precious is a [Music] flow what can wash away my sin nothing
