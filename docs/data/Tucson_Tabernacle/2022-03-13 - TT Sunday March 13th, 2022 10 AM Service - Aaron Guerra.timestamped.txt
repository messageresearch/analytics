[45:12] you haven't changed
[45:15] everything that takes place everything

[47:58] thank you
[48:00] thank you for singing that
[48:02] song of peace brother man
[48:06] sometimes when you're in the back there
[48:07] you're just saying lord which
[48:09] and then something takes place and says
[48:11] it's okay so
[48:13] while you're standing let's read
[48:16] john 14 27 to open with a scripture
[48:22] here jesus is speaking he says
[48:26] peace i leave with you
[48:28] my peace i give unto you
[48:30] not as the world giveth give i unto you
[48:33] let not your heart be troubled
[48:36] neither let it be afraid
[48:38] amen you may be seated
[48:43] i like that
[48:45] my peace
[48:47] i give unto you
[48:50] perfect peace
[48:52] holy peace complete
[48:55] no strings attached
[48:57] nothing he just gives you of himself
[49:02] i just appreciate that
[49:06] the word peace freedom from all
[49:08] disquieting or oppression oppressive
[49:11] thoughts or emotions
[49:16] i have been
[49:18] in perfect peace
[49:20] and contentment
[49:22] in the presence of god
[49:25] if you can let him have his way if you
[49:28] can just yield of yourself and say lord
[49:31] you come
[49:32] you can say i have been in perfect peace
[49:35] and contentment
[49:36] because the rest of the time you'll be
[49:38] having a good time you've been enjoying
[49:40] it and then something happens and it
[49:42] breaks it but if you get into the
[49:44] presence of god and just stay there what
[49:46] a wonderful thing so
[49:49] before i forget let me just make this
[49:51] announcement
[49:53] this evening our brother jesse wilson
[49:55] will be with us speaking tonight
[49:58] brother jesse wilson's married sister
[50:00] hadassah and we've heard the testimony
[50:02] just recently
[50:04] of our sister's healing
[50:06] brother jesse wilson is brother green's
[50:08] grandson
[50:10] and oh it's been quite some time now i
[50:12] had talked to him
[50:14] probably over a year ago maybe even two
[50:16] years ago
[50:17] about sharing his testimony with us or
[50:20] something
[50:21] so he said well i'll think about it and
[50:24] he spoke with his pastor brother cadem
[50:26] and brother caleb says you're just
[50:27] starting why don't you just get a little
[50:29] more experience just
[50:31] mannerisms behind the pulpit and things
[50:33] which i thought was pretty good
[50:35] good advice
[50:37] so when they came friday for that
[50:39] potluck after sister hadas had come and
[50:41] we got to see her
[50:44] the the healing the effect of the
[50:46] healing on her face and her emotions all
[50:48] was just marvelous
[50:50] too i had seen her before that i didn't
[50:52] know what was going on and i said
[50:53] there's something wrong with her she's
[50:55] just not herself
[50:57] but the joy that was in her face and
[50:59] brother jesse came up to the side and
[51:00] said brother aaron he goes i think i'm
[51:02] ready
[51:03] and i said well i've been waiting for
[51:05] this day for a while so lord willing
[51:06] brother jesse will be with us tonight
[51:10] he said you want me to preach you want
[51:11] me to give my testimony i said i'd like
[51:13] to hear a little bit of your testimony
[51:14] but if god gives you something to
[51:15] minister just minister it
[51:18] and he says well he goes i never take
[51:20] long i'm never longer than 35 minutes so
[51:23] i won't hold it hold him to that if he
[51:25] wants to take an hour that's perfectly
[51:27] fine so lord willing he'll be with us
[51:29] this evening
[51:30] i'm looking forward to it
[51:32] i believe it'll be a blessing to see
[51:34] what god can do
[51:36] with a young man
[51:38] and just just make it real to him so
[51:42] as
[51:43] as a meltdown to pray
[51:45] before service after the service starts
[51:48] close the door and just kind of
[51:50] close yourself in for a little bit
[51:52] and i uh
[51:55] i just was talking and i heard brother
[51:57] lyle minister about or pray about europe
[51:59] what's going on in europe there and
[52:01] and in the countries back there and it
[52:04] seems so far away from us
[52:07] you know while that's on the other side
[52:08] of the world
[52:10] but there are brothers and sisters out
[52:12] there there there are people they have
[52:14] feelings they have hurts they have
[52:15] families there's so much going on
[52:18] but at the same time you look in the
[52:20] scriptures and it must be
[52:23] it's it's god said this we can look
[52:25] we've had we've been able to look into
[52:26] the scripture and say these times are
[52:28] coming these times are here
[52:31] i still every time i i think of that
[52:34] thought that brother branham said and i
[52:36] have the quote there and i read it every
[52:37] so often
[52:40] it was the tender hand of jehovah
[52:44] that caused what happened in germany
[52:47] to our jewish brethren
[52:50] and if that's tenderness i don't want it
[52:53] in the natural
[52:55] that's not what i consider tenderness
[52:57] and and the sweetness of god but it was
[53:01] because it caused them to turn and go
[53:04] back to israel
[53:06] they wouldn't have gone otherwise
[53:08] they were well to do they had everything
[53:10] they wanted they had everything why
[53:11] should they go back
[53:13] because the scripture said they all
[53:15] shall come from the north the south the
[53:17] east and the west and they shall return
[53:19] and god says i'll bring it to pass so
[53:22] when you look into the scriptures and
[53:23] you begin to read you'll be ready to see
[53:25] what is happening on earth today must
[53:28] come to pass
[53:29] must be
[53:31] now if it was up to us we would do it a
[53:32] little differently
[53:34] uh you know if we have if we have a a
[53:36] good christian attitude
[53:38] you know we try to be as gentle as we
[53:40] can we try to be as soft as we can
[53:43] you know sometimes you look back maybe
[53:45] as a parent and you look at
[53:48] and and i have the opportunity to
[53:50] because having six children how you
[53:51] treated the first one compared to how
[53:53] you treated the last
[53:54] one i always
[53:57] laugh when i think about when
[54:00] naomi was born and we took her to the
[54:02] hospital when she was about three months
[54:03] old because she wasn't breathing
[54:06] and and when i looked at her she was
[54:08] breathing but mama you know
[54:11] so we went to the hospital and they
[54:13] checked naomi over really well
[54:16] she was fine doctor said now i'll go
[54:17] work on mama
[54:19] and she said because that's about normal
[54:21] it's a
[54:22] but when rachel was born
[54:24] and something was wrong with rachel we'd
[54:26] say naomi go see what's wrong with
[54:27] rachel
[54:29] we didn't stir all that much
[54:31] and if we're not careful
[54:33] we kind of get used to things we kind of
[54:35] get
[54:36] but we should have that same
[54:38] urgency
[54:40] that same desire
[54:41] that same push
[54:43] that if it's the first time or the last
[54:44] time it's still
[54:46] god is this what you want god is jewish
[54:49] am i following your will am i am i in
[54:51] your in what you want us to do
[54:54] because sometimes we say oh lord no no
[54:56] don't don't be so harsh don't be so mean
[54:57] don't it's not that it's the tender hand
[55:00] of jehovah
[55:03] sometimes hard to understand
[55:05] but when you take a scripture that peace
[55:07] i leave with you
[55:08] my peace i give unto you
[55:11] not as the world giveth
[55:14] and thinking about what's going on over
[55:15] there and you
[55:17] read the news and you know that
[55:19] the news is slanted in certain
[55:20] directions and
[55:22] you know you kind of have to look all
[55:23] around to get a general a better picture
[55:26] if you just listen to one thing you're
[55:28] going to hear it one way if you hear
[55:29] just this it's going to be this way
[55:32] and then sometimes if you get to talk to
[55:34] somebody who's very involved they'll
[55:35] give you a complete different
[55:37] view and and sometimes i know brother
[55:39] greene said he used to read all the
[55:41] different uh magazines from other parts
[55:43] of the world because it would give a
[55:44] complete different view of what we were
[55:46] working
[55:48] but to hear some of the things that are
[55:49] going on and in today's world
[55:52] as i was thinking about as i was praying
[55:54] i just felt the lord brought it to my
[55:56] memory world war ii which
[55:58] i was fascinated by when as a young man
[56:00] i would read the books and
[56:02] um and just just it was something that
[56:04] was interested me
[56:06] and when japan attacked the united
[56:09] states there in hawaii and all that
[56:11] happened there
[56:12] how we we really were forced to get into
[56:15] the war then
[56:17] and i had monk my cousin robert chacon's
[56:19] father
[56:21] my uncle vicente was in world war ii
[56:24] and was in
[56:26] on a schedule and rotation if we would
[56:28] have landed in japan he would have been
[56:30] part of that group
[56:33] and the war ended before that but he
[56:35] shared a few things that they saw and
[56:37] what they heard uncle robert my mom's
[56:39] brother was in the korean war and i
[56:41] worked with him at davis kitchens in
[56:43] fact he's the one that got me into work
[56:44] there
[56:45] and he shared things that he saw
[56:48] war is ugly
[56:50] war is mean wars whereas
[56:52] and generally war in in the human it is
[56:55] because somebody wants power over
[56:56] somebody else somebody wants more of
[56:58] this but god allows these things to
[57:00] happen
[57:01] to bring his
[57:03] will to pass
[57:05] so
[57:06] just thinking about some of that and and
[57:08] thinking how we went and we began to
[57:10] take island after island
[57:14] to cut off the ability for japan to make
[57:17] war
[57:20] but today is different
[57:23] we're not taking island after island
[57:25] we're cutting off the finances we're
[57:27] cutting off the influence we're cutting
[57:29] off the ability to get the news out
[57:32] it's a whole different approach to war
[57:34] today's war is fought here
[57:37] and it affects here
[57:40] nations are breaking israel's awakening
[57:42] the signs that the prophets foretold
[57:45] so is all this that's happening today
[57:49] but now so there's a talk of a
[57:51] possibility of a great nuclear war and i
[57:53] saw an article that said how many people
[57:55] in 45 minutes would be dead it would be
[57:57] they said in 45 minutes to be at least 8
[57:59] million people lose their lives
[58:02] but it's far away from us
[58:05] it's on the other side of the world
[58:08] but no it's not far away from us
[58:10] it hits home
[58:12] so as i was looking at this and we had
[58:14] talked last last time we spoke we were
[58:16] ministering on rest
[58:18] finding rest and and the way i started
[58:20] it was
[58:21] look at some of the folks like the three
[58:22] hebrew children they found rest
[58:27] when the prince of peace visited with
[58:29] them in that
[58:31] but it sure didn't look restful while
[58:32] they're getting there
[58:35] when when joshua tells him we're about
[58:37] to cross into this land it's going to be
[58:40] that land of milk and honey
[58:44] and it is and he tells them he said but
[58:46] you keep serving those other gods you
[58:48] haven't let them go as for me and my
[58:50] house we will serve the lord
[58:54] and sometimes you say how can you how
[58:56] could you serve a god that requires
[58:58] everything of you
[59:00] it's quite simple when you remember that
[59:02] he gave his all for you
[59:04] and you would do it back
[59:07] so
[59:08] kind of picking up on that same thought
[59:10] again rest
[59:12] but tying it in with peace
[59:14] because without peace there is no rest
[59:19] with the
[59:21] way
[59:22] you know
[59:23] supply and demand is right now it's it's
[59:25] tough it's hard it was with the
[59:27] homeowner on thursday and
[59:30] they've been waiting for a year and a
[59:31] half for us to be able to get into the
[59:33] house and look at the damage
[59:36] that now we have to order the parts for
[59:39] so it'll be another
[59:40] three to five months before the parts
[59:42] come in
[59:44] and
[59:45] i've got this thing that i say
[59:47] you can have it in four months or you
[59:50] can have it in 16 weeks
[59:53] and they stop and i go which one sounds
[59:55] better
[59:57] most of them say 16 weeks just sounds
[59:59] better it's the same amount of time just
[1:00:01] has a better sound
[1:00:04] but he worked with transformers he goes
[1:00:06] i understand he said most of the
[1:00:08] transformers we're working with right
[1:00:09] now are two years out
[1:00:13] and they're still building houses as
[1:00:14] fast as they can put them down
[1:00:16] and steal some
[1:00:17] so i went in to take care of my home
[1:00:19] that was getting ready to turn into the
[1:00:22] give over to the the new owners
[1:00:25] and i go in and and there's still
[1:00:27] putting the power in they're still
[1:00:29] putting the water in and i called the
[1:00:31] superintendent he goes oh no that house
[1:00:32] closed already
[1:00:34] they just won't take possession of it
[1:00:36] until we get water and power in there
[1:00:39] maybe another month
[1:00:41] but for the company that the building
[1:00:43] company close the house we get the money
[1:00:47] it's a whole different mentality today
[1:00:51] but i'm thinking of the one who said i
[1:00:53] will go down
[1:00:55] and i will do this myself
[1:00:59] i will bear their burden
[1:01:01] i will take the hurts
[1:01:03] i will take the sorrow i will do it
[1:01:08] but today's world let somebody else deal
[1:01:10] with it let somebody else have to do
[1:01:12] with it
[1:01:14] and
[1:01:15] so when i opened the scriptures
[1:01:18] and it was fell on john 14 27 my peace
[1:01:22] i give unto you
[1:01:24] not as the world gives you
[1:01:26] and then philippians 4 7
[1:01:30] and here's here's the one the other one
[1:01:31] that just hit me and the peace of god
[1:01:33] which passes all understanding
[1:01:37] shall keep your hearts and minds through
[1:01:39] christ jesus
[1:01:41] explain to me sometimes how somebody
[1:01:45] could have peace today and be at rest
[1:01:48] without god
[1:01:52] you have to entertain yourself
[1:01:54] you have to find something that keeps
[1:01:56] all those other thoughts away
[1:01:59] whether that entertainment comes through
[1:02:01] a drug
[1:02:02] through a bottle
[1:02:04] through sports to whatever it might be
[1:02:07] let me not pay attention to what's going
[1:02:09] over there but let
[1:02:10] let something else keep my attention
[1:02:13] but he says
[1:02:15] and the peace of god which passes all
[1:02:17] understanding
[1:02:18] shall keep your hearts and minds
[1:02:21] through christ jesus
[1:02:25] and here is
[1:02:29] and the peace of god the calm
[1:02:31] heavenly repose
[1:02:34] that tranquility of spirit
[1:02:37] tranquil free from agitation of mind or
[1:02:40] spirit
[1:02:41] free from disturbance or turmoil
[1:02:46] god said it
[1:02:47] therefore i believe it and i rest on it
[1:02:51] and sometimes rest his heart
[1:02:53] i'm going to share a little testimony
[1:02:56] because god is the same yesterday today
[1:02:58] and forever
[1:03:00] you know he said to his disciples when
[1:03:02] he's when he's with him he says i don't
[1:03:03] even have a place to lay down
[1:03:06] and when he's going on the ship across
[1:03:08] the sea after he told him we'll meet on
[1:03:09] the other side
[1:03:12] brother billy paul
[1:03:13] shares his testimony where he would have
[1:03:16] trouble when there was a little place
[1:03:17] he'd have to jump over
[1:03:19] and then he said brother brown would say
[1:03:21] come on billy he knew brother brandon
[1:03:22] had seen him on the other side already
[1:03:24] now you would think the disciples had
[1:03:26] known enough with being around jesus
[1:03:28] that if he said it let's just go do it
[1:03:31] but no they happen to be human
[1:03:33] they happen to be like us at times
[1:03:35] you know i know you were with me just a
[1:03:37] little bit ago because that was you lord
[1:03:39] but where are you now
[1:03:43] and and to think here he is they're
[1:03:44] going he's already told them he said
[1:03:46] we're going across
[1:03:48] let's go on to the other side he's tired
[1:03:50] he's weary he lays down and he goes to
[1:03:52] sleep because he's not worried about it
[1:03:56] it's easy to sleep
[1:03:58] when you're not worried
[1:04:00] when you're trusting when there's peace
[1:04:03] because you don't struggle
[1:04:05] but if you lay down with something
[1:04:06] anxious in your mind in your heart it's
[1:04:08] hard to find sleep
[1:04:10] it's just constant it's constantly going
[1:04:13] and he gets up when they wake him up
[1:04:15] these very ones who had seen him
[1:04:17] feed 5000 who had seen him do this who
[1:04:20] this
[1:04:20] and he stands on the bow of the ship and
[1:04:22] he says peace be still and they're
[1:04:23] marveled
[1:04:24] again but i don't care how many times
[1:04:27] god visits it's the same effect
[1:04:29] how wonderful how marvelous how great i
[1:04:32] just don't understand i don't even know
[1:04:33] why sometimes i've done nothing to
[1:04:36] deserve it
[1:04:37] but he does it anyways
[1:04:39] it pleases god
[1:04:41] to bless his children
[1:04:44] amen
[1:04:45] so here he gets up and he calms the sea
[1:04:48] and then he looks at me he said oh ye of
[1:04:50] little faith
[1:04:52] have not have not i showed you over and
[1:04:54] over that that i'm the master of this
[1:04:58] i've given you power
[1:05:00] just not too long ago you were casting
[1:05:02] out demons what's the difference
[1:05:05] but we're
[1:05:06] human we forget
[1:05:10] something else comes our way and we lord
[1:05:12] where are you
[1:05:14] but he's the same so
[1:05:15] this would have been
[1:05:17] early friday morning
[1:05:20] not been able to sleep dozing and just
[1:05:23] things going on
[1:05:24] things with work things with the church
[1:05:27] everything
[1:05:29] and my wife was asleep
[1:05:31] and it used to be the other way i would
[1:05:34] wake up quickly now or i would sleep
[1:05:36] through it and she wouldn't wake up and
[1:05:38] now it's the other way i wake up and she
[1:05:39] doesn't wake up
[1:05:42] and i just said i i
[1:05:43] i should wake her up and have her pray
[1:05:45] for me because sometimes you have
[1:05:46] trouble praying for yourself
[1:05:48] it's just like lord i don't even know
[1:05:50] what to say i don't know what to ask
[1:05:51] and right about then she rolled over and
[1:05:53] she put her arm on me
[1:05:56] okay
[1:05:58] i said are you awake and she said yes
[1:06:00] i said would you pray for me
[1:06:02] just lays their hands over in just a 30
[1:06:05] second prayer
[1:06:06] lord give my husband peace give him
[1:06:08] wrestling within a couple of minutes
[1:06:10] asleep
[1:06:13] but here's the amazing part
[1:06:16] i get a um
[1:06:18] a text from uh or a call from my brother
[1:06:20] and i couldn't answer it
[1:06:22] i called him back
[1:06:24] and he said i'll call you back in a
[1:06:26] minute so we made contact
[1:06:28] and he said early this morning you came
[1:06:30] on my heart
[1:06:32] he said and i was going to text you then
[1:06:35] and i looked and i said it's way too
[1:06:36] early they're not awake yet
[1:06:39] so i said about what time was this he
[1:06:40] said between 3 and 3 30 in the morning
[1:06:44] he lives on the other side of the
[1:06:45] country
[1:06:47] so it was about 5 5 30 their time
[1:06:50] and he said you just came on real strong
[1:06:52] and so did the tabernacle and i was
[1:06:53] praying for you
[1:06:56] so why should we weary
[1:06:58] why should we be afraid why should we be
[1:07:00] so nervous when god has got it in
[1:07:02] control
[1:07:05] but it won't take but a few times again
[1:07:07] and you'll be back in the same place
[1:07:08] lord where are you
[1:07:10] lord i need your help but that's okay he
[1:07:12] said call unto me and i will
[1:07:18] again if you don't go through any
[1:07:20] problems you'll never know what kind of
[1:07:22] god he is
[1:07:24] he's the god of my mother he's the god
[1:07:26] of my father he's a god of my grandpa
[1:07:28] he's a god of this ad or the other but
[1:07:30] no now i know him to be my god
[1:07:33] he's careful with me and i'll
[1:07:35] show
[1:07:37] again
[1:07:38] and the peace of god
[1:07:39] that calm heavenly repose that
[1:07:42] tranquility of spirit which god only can
[1:07:46] give
[1:07:49] as much as i want to help you and you
[1:07:51] want to help me
[1:07:53] we can be touched to a certain part of
[1:07:55] that infirmity
[1:07:57] but god can be touched to every one of
[1:08:00] your feelings of infirmity of your
[1:08:02] thoughts of your he's aware of that all
[1:08:04] that he says
[1:08:06] which none can comprehend
[1:08:09] save he that receiveth it
[1:08:11] when god gives it to you and the peace
[1:08:13] comes over only you at that point can
[1:08:16] understand how god could do this
[1:08:18] he says
[1:08:20] it shall keep shall guard as a garrison
[1:08:22] does a city your hearts your affections
[1:08:25] your minds your understandings and all
[1:08:29] the various workings of them
[1:08:32] i still
[1:08:35] think quite often when that
[1:08:37] my case manager when he had the the
[1:08:39] surgery
[1:08:40] my my foot and all when she said your
[1:08:43] body has about 6 000 operations
[1:08:45] continually that you're not even aware
[1:08:47] of happening
[1:08:49] until they go wrong
[1:08:50] then suddenly you know something's going
[1:08:52] on
[1:08:54] all the various workings through the
[1:08:56] spirit and the power of christ jesus
[1:08:59] in the knowledge and love of god
[1:09:05] he understands it all he knows it all
[1:09:07] and he loves you on top of that
[1:09:11] you know
[1:09:12] we're going on 43 years married and i
[1:09:14] love my wife
[1:09:16] but every once in a while it gets put to
[1:09:18] the test
[1:09:20] and i just and more than every once in a
[1:09:22] while she gets put to the test from my
[1:09:24] side
[1:09:26] i'd say i say i get the better end of
[1:09:28] the deal
[1:09:30] but it is
[1:09:32] there are times things happen things
[1:09:34] just you know and yeah you lose your
[1:09:36] cool you you do something you get mad
[1:09:39] you get upset
[1:09:40] and you have to stop for a few minutes
[1:09:42] and and get a hold of yourself and say
[1:09:44] hey that was wrong
[1:09:46] and as quick as you can't go make it
[1:09:48] right
[1:09:49] because the further along it goes
[1:09:52] remember the pillow with the feathers
[1:09:55] it's hard to get it all back
[1:09:58] he says but he says
[1:10:02] through the spirit and power of christ
[1:10:04] jesus in the knowledge and love of god
[1:10:08] and then he says without a guard set on
[1:10:10] these likewise the purity and the vigor
[1:10:14] of our affections cannot long be
[1:10:17] preserved
[1:10:19] that was john wesley
[1:10:22] he was eloquent with his words
[1:10:26] you know in in
[1:10:28] that was also under the spirit of man
[1:10:31] being able to speak the words to get to
[1:10:33] the people
[1:10:36] but it cannot long be preserved
[1:10:41] going down the highway and you're
[1:10:44] listening to a song you're singing a
[1:10:45] song and somebody cuts you off
[1:10:48] and it cannot long be preserved
[1:10:52] all sudden
[1:10:53] oh lord help me
[1:10:58] and somebody is doing this speed limit
[1:11:00] and you're not
[1:11:04] why don't they just get into the slow
[1:11:05] lane then
[1:11:07] they're obeying the law you're not
[1:11:12] lord help us all
[1:11:14] sometimes you go racing down there to
[1:11:16] get to where you're at and you go wow
[1:11:19] i was supposed to be here an hour later
[1:11:21] i'm an hour early because i missed time
[1:11:23] the work
[1:11:26] and
[1:11:27] start figuring out who to blame it on
[1:11:31] ecclesiastes 3 14.
[1:11:35] here's something that the
[1:11:37] a man solomon who asked god for wisdom
[1:11:42] to rule over god's people
[1:11:44] god said you can have riches you can
[1:11:46] have this you can have everything he
[1:11:47] goes
[1:11:48] he says give me wisdom to rule your
[1:11:51] people so great a people
[1:11:54] and he says i know that
[1:11:56] whatsoever god do with it
[1:11:58] it shall be forever
[1:12:00] nothing can be put to it nor anything
[1:12:03] taken from it and god do with it that
[1:12:06] men should fear before him
[1:12:11] that we would have respect unto him and
[1:12:13] understand that he's in control
[1:12:15] not a fear of being afraid but a respect
[1:12:18] and a reverence of a god who has
[1:12:20] everything under control
[1:12:22] if he says so it is so if he says no
[1:12:25] then it's no
[1:12:27] there's no
[1:12:29] ah maybe
[1:12:32] you're dead robert
[1:12:33] mongol i work with him uncle theo you
[1:12:37] want me to do this way
[1:12:39] ah the chicon side of the family
[1:12:43] um
[1:12:45] yeah
[1:12:46] maybe um that's five minutes of that
[1:12:50] until i cut through the power cord then
[1:12:52] he reacted quickly
[1:12:54] i worked with my uncle i respected i
[1:12:56] loved my uncle very much
[1:12:58] but that was his nature
[1:13:01] we would go to bid a job
[1:13:04] and it was a lot of work he did yard
[1:13:06] maintenance cleanups and stuff
[1:13:10] and they would say how much and he'd be
[1:13:11] looking and i'd be thinking well he's
[1:13:13] got to charge at least 300 for this and
[1:13:15] he would say
[1:13:16] we can do it for 50.
[1:13:18] and i would say i'll get five dollars
[1:13:20] out of it you know
[1:13:22] do the work it's just who he was
[1:13:24] that's the way monko was
[1:13:26] but you know we serve a god who knows
[1:13:28] the end
[1:13:30] from the beginning and the beginning
[1:13:31] from the end because he's eternal
[1:13:34] there's no fear in him there's no
[1:13:36] wavering in him there's no i got to go
[1:13:38] back to the lab to see and retest this
[1:13:41] it worked perfect the first time and
[1:13:42] will continue to be perfect
[1:13:45] he's unfailing
[1:13:48] and we need to trust him that way so
[1:13:51] here's solomon realize that when god
[1:13:53] does it god does it right
[1:13:55] you don't you that men should fear in
[1:13:57] other words you'd have that respect and
[1:13:59] irreverence to god
[1:14:01] that lord you're in control you're in
[1:14:02] charge and it will be okay
[1:14:06] i half don't have to worry about it
[1:14:09] let's read a couple of of the the quotes
[1:14:11] here that
[1:14:13] i found just
[1:14:17] sometimes you just do a word search to
[1:14:18] see what what did braham say about that
[1:14:21] or you get in the dictionary you say
[1:14:23] what is the actual definition
[1:14:26] or maybe you hear another brother
[1:14:27] ministering and he and his and he shares
[1:14:29] a question and god allows you to hear
[1:14:31] and it just becomes real to you
[1:14:34] from proof of his resurrection
[1:14:39] you're proof of his resurrection you're
[1:14:41] living proof of a resurrected living
[1:14:43] christ
[1:14:47] the emancipation of the proclamation has
[1:14:49] been signed
[1:14:50] you're free
[1:14:52] and you just don't know it
[1:14:55] but faith must have a divine resting
[1:14:58] place
[1:14:59] before if you have faith in god you've
[1:15:02] got to have some divine resting place to
[1:15:05] place it
[1:15:06] and there's no better place
[1:15:08] no other divine way only through god's
[1:15:11] holy word and we want to let our faith
[1:15:14] rest directly upon the written word of
[1:15:17] god
[1:15:19] it never changes
[1:15:21] it never has to be rewritten
[1:15:23] it never has to have a theological
[1:15:25] explanation because it just comes to
[1:15:27] pass
[1:15:29] does it work turn the key engine turned
[1:15:32] on yes it does
[1:15:34] take god at his word
[1:15:36] the uncertain sound
[1:15:40] the next one there
[1:15:44] says oh the blessedness of believing
[1:15:48] thank god that he has given us the
[1:15:50] ability to believe and take him at his
[1:15:52] word the blessing of not trying to
[1:15:54] figure it out
[1:15:57] oh that's the hard part
[1:15:59] i want it to make sense to this guy
[1:16:01] right here
[1:16:03] i want 2 plus 2 to always equal 2. but
[1:16:05] in today's math i'm not too sure
[1:16:08] what is it called common core
[1:16:11] i don't i had enough trouble with basic
[1:16:13] math don't make it any more confusing
[1:16:16] you know
[1:16:17] the blessing of just resting on god's
[1:16:20] word
[1:16:21] and say it's true and go on it's life
[1:16:25] it's life it's real living
[1:16:29] the blessing of taking god as word and
[1:16:31] just believing it
[1:16:35] law or grace
[1:16:39] therefore jesus didn't make a mistake
[1:16:41] when he said be there for perfect
[1:16:45] even as your father in heaven is perfect
[1:16:48] and how could a human be
[1:16:50] be perfect
[1:16:51] he could be perfect by his perfect faith
[1:16:55] resting in him saying
[1:16:56] he paid the price for me
[1:17:01] what is your faith resting on today
[1:17:04] this revelation
[1:17:06] that great minister
[1:17:07] this explanation or the fact that god
[1:17:10] did it all for you already
[1:17:13] because a man today could preach it
[1:17:15] exactly how you feel it and tomorrow
[1:17:18] turn it
[1:17:19] because man has a tendency to do things
[1:17:21] like that
[1:17:22] i've got a better understanding today
[1:17:24] i've got a clearer understanding today i
[1:17:26] read this brother branham said if the
[1:17:28] angel of the lord had not come into the
[1:17:30] room when he was going to preach the
[1:17:31] seals he would have preached them wrong
[1:17:35] but god rich in mercy knowing that you
[1:17:37] and i would be here this day made sure
[1:17:40] the angel of the lord was in that room
[1:17:41] with him so that it was preached
[1:17:43] correctly
[1:17:45] if we're not careful we put way too much
[1:17:47] in brother adam but he depended on the
[1:17:49] god the same god that you and i have to
[1:17:51] depend on
[1:17:53] it was god allowing somebody to be shown
[1:17:55] that if you could surrender and give
[1:17:56] yourself completely over to him
[1:17:59] he could do the same with you
[1:18:03] and it doesn't make a difference of your
[1:18:04] age
[1:18:06] he said suffer not the little children
[1:18:07] that come unto me
[1:18:09] sometimes our grandchildren tells us
[1:18:10] things that are amazing and they do it
[1:18:12] in an innocent heart just because they
[1:18:14] love
[1:18:16] dad papa can do no wrong daddy can do no
[1:18:18] wrong mama can do no wrong
[1:18:21] oh that they would never get to be
[1:18:22] teenagers
[1:18:26] then we realized wow daddy and mama are
[1:18:27] just as human as i am
[1:18:29] and they've got their issues and they've
[1:18:31] got their problems too
[1:18:32] but if you remind them they love you
[1:18:35] they have their your best interest in
[1:18:37] their heart and their mind and heart
[1:18:39] the same as god did
[1:18:41] he said he could be perfect by his
[1:18:43] perfect faith resting in him saying he
[1:18:47] paid the price
[1:18:51] what a mighty god we serve
[1:18:54] what a mighty god that loves us
[1:18:58] this world is not my home i'm just
[1:19:01] passing through
[1:19:03] but there are no shortcuts to the
[1:19:05] passing through
[1:19:08] while you're on this earth there's
[1:19:09] something for you to do
[1:19:11] while you're on this earth there's a
[1:19:13] life to live
[1:19:15] there's a glory and an honor that should
[1:19:16] be given to god
[1:19:19] there's someone who may on the other
[1:19:21] side said because you were there that
[1:19:23] day i'm here today yes
[1:19:26] and it will be worth it all
[1:19:30] even if it's just one
[1:19:32] for that one as brother dan said the
[1:19:34] other for that starfish it made all the
[1:19:37] difference for that one
[1:19:41] oh
[1:19:42] the joy that will be for
[1:19:44] to be there in somebody because because
[1:19:46] of your life you lived
[1:19:48] because of the cold cup of water
[1:19:51] because of that little fish or that
[1:19:53] little loaf of bread you shared with me
[1:19:54] i'm here today
[1:19:57] it'll be worth it all right
[1:20:00] isaiah 32 17 and 18.
[1:20:08] when you get down
[1:20:10] and it gets hard
[1:20:12] and that happens often
[1:20:15] unless you're
[1:20:16] dead but if you have life in you
[1:20:19] you have your up and down every day
[1:20:22] there are struggles
[1:20:23] you get up in the morning and as you get
[1:20:25] a little bit on this side of the age
[1:20:27] level
[1:20:29] and parts
[1:20:30] that shouldn't be hurting or hurting
[1:20:33] for no reason at all it seems like
[1:20:35] sometimes
[1:20:37] didn't do anything to make it hurt i
[1:20:39] didn't go jogging i didn't jump off of
[1:20:40] anything i didn't pick up nothing heavy
[1:20:42] but it hurts anyways
[1:20:45] when you realize that
[1:20:47] you're alive
[1:20:49] because he cares for you
[1:20:52] and the work of righteousness shall be
[1:20:55] peace
[1:20:57] and the effect of
[1:20:58] righteousness quietness and assurance
[1:21:02] forever
[1:21:05] and my people shall dwell in a peaceable
[1:21:07] habitation
[1:21:09] ensure dwellings
[1:21:10] and in quiet resting places
[1:21:15] most of us do not go to a busy
[1:21:18] busy shop with all the motors running
[1:21:21] everybody working hard and lay our
[1:21:22] caught down say
[1:21:24] a perfect place to rest
[1:21:27] no we're leaving that place to go try to
[1:21:29] find somewhere to some quiet some shade
[1:21:31] something get out of all the noise get
[1:21:33] off all all of the distractions a quiet
[1:21:36] place but god's word says man my people
[1:21:39] shall dwell in a peaceable habitation
[1:21:42] and an assure and insured dwellings and
[1:21:44] in a quiet resting place
[1:21:48] where there's no turmoil the mind is not
[1:21:50] going here and there the heart is not
[1:21:52] pumping twice as much as it should be
[1:21:54] because there's rest
[1:21:58] now you ask me how can you be rest when
[1:22:00] this happens because there's a god of
[1:22:02] peace living in you
[1:22:04] not because you're able to manufacture
[1:22:07] man has tried to manufacture peace many
[1:22:09] different ways
[1:22:11] and it has never worked
[1:22:14] never to the place
[1:22:16] where they thought they could achieve
[1:22:19] right now there's a there are those up
[1:22:21] in the space station
[1:22:26] and and gotten away from this atmosphere
[1:22:28] to that atmosphere working in space
[1:22:30] station and now
[1:22:32] there's a possibility they'll not be
[1:22:33] able to come back
[1:22:36] because man is fighting with men
[1:22:39] because somebody wants more than the
[1:22:41] other has because the greed takes place
[1:22:45] when god said i have everything
[1:22:48] i own the cattle on a thousand hills
[1:22:51] every vein of gold every deposit of
[1:22:53] silver every ounce of oil whatever it is
[1:22:55] is mine i created it
[1:22:59] but i'll give it all up for you
[1:23:04] he left the splendor of heaven
[1:23:07] knowing his destiny
[1:23:10] was a lonely hill on golgotha
[1:23:13] to give his life for you and me
[1:23:16] and you and i are looking at our bank
[1:23:18] account and
[1:23:20] i got to hold on to that i got to hold
[1:23:21] on to that i got to hold on to that and
[1:23:23] i'm not telling you to be foolish about
[1:23:24] it i'm just telling you what you're
[1:23:26] what's the motive behind your heart
[1:23:29] there is no peace in all of that
[1:23:32] i've never heard of a somebody be
[1:23:35] getting a million dollars and that's it
[1:23:36] i don't need any more their next thought
[1:23:38] is how can i make that 1 2 and how can i
[1:23:40] make that 2 4 and how can i make that 4
[1:23:42] 8.
[1:23:45] it's
[1:23:46] natural
[1:23:48] but this same god
[1:23:51] who created the heavens and the earth
[1:23:54] and said
[1:23:55] it is good and he rested
[1:24:00] yet knowing what was going to take place
[1:24:06] he had read the whole book
[1:24:08] from beginning to the end
[1:24:10] he knew of it i i always remember
[1:24:13] brother neal johnson i've read the back
[1:24:14] of the book and we went
[1:24:17] but there's still a battle
[1:24:19] to go through
[1:24:20] vic victorious means you fought the
[1:24:22] battle
[1:24:24] you know and here's the other thing and
[1:24:27] right now you know the
[1:24:29] basketball's going and
[1:24:31] everybody to kind of get away from
[1:24:33] everything else is following their
[1:24:34] basketball team
[1:24:36] and when the basketball team wins you
[1:24:39] hear we won we won
[1:24:41] when the basketball team loses you here
[1:24:43] they lost they lost
[1:24:45] the association changes quickly
[1:24:49] but when he looked down from the
[1:24:51] splendors of heaven said i'll go
[1:24:55] i'll go
[1:24:56] he knew what he was getting into
[1:24:59] so much that he cried out father
[1:25:01] if it be possible can this pass from me
[1:25:06] as a human
[1:25:07] having this same flesh without sin i
[1:25:10] understand but he had to be a kinsmen
[1:25:13] redeemer he had to go through the pain
[1:25:15] the anxiety the nervousness the worry
[1:25:18] and he calls out to his father says
[1:25:20] there a way to get around this without
[1:25:21] me having to go through this but not my
[1:25:24] will thy will be done
[1:25:26] because you and i were on his mind
[1:25:31] in a quiet resting place
[1:25:36] sometimes
[1:25:39] it's
[1:25:42] can you go sleep somewhere else
[1:25:45] because while you're sleeping it's not
[1:25:47] quiet
[1:25:49] um
[1:25:50] asher and chloe spent the night
[1:25:53] for the first time they have sleepover i
[1:25:55] know it's been a while back
[1:25:57] and of course
[1:25:58] grandma nanny had to be there with them
[1:26:01] and
[1:26:02] i slept in the room and she slept in the
[1:26:04] living room and they were on the things
[1:26:06] and
[1:26:07] chloe wakes up
[1:26:08] grandma and she says you're making too
[1:26:11] much noise
[1:26:14] and then when mama
[1:26:16] was in look up chloe had her arm over
[1:26:18] asher's ears protecting him little
[1:26:22] brother
[1:26:24] so they spent
[1:26:25] last night with us or the night before
[1:26:27] friday night
[1:26:28] and so my wife says
[1:26:30] is it okay if nani sleeps in here it'll
[1:26:32] be okay i can take the noise she says
[1:26:37] children just honest straight up
[1:26:41] i think that god would put up with us
[1:26:46] as good and as perfect sometimes we
[1:26:48] think we are
[1:26:50] he must have a good laugh every once in
[1:26:51] a while
[1:26:53] my children have you seen my children
[1:26:54] watch them look at them
[1:26:58] but he said have you considered my
[1:27:00] servant job
[1:27:02] that's what he thinks of us
[1:27:05] he would dare put you in satan's face
[1:27:07] and said have you seen my servant have
[1:27:10] you seen my daughter because he knows
[1:27:12] what's in you
[1:27:15] he knows you can stand
[1:27:17] and say though god slay me yet i'll
[1:27:19] trust him
[1:27:20] with these eyes i shall see my redeemer
[1:27:25] it's the same god in you
[1:27:28] now peter here
[1:27:32] ii peter
[1:27:34] 1 1-4
[1:27:36] simon peter a servant and an apostle of
[1:27:38] jesus christ
[1:27:41] remember simon peter
[1:27:43] when they're there
[1:27:45] and and and they're there at
[1:27:47] gethsemane and
[1:27:48] and and he's one of the ones that goes a
[1:27:50] little further up with jesus to pray
[1:27:53] with him
[1:27:54] along with a couple of his brothers
[1:27:56] and jesus comes back and finds him
[1:27:58] asleep
[1:28:00] and he tells him can't you can't you
[1:28:02] watch with me can't you pray with me can
[1:28:03] you stay awake for a little while and he
[1:28:05] goes to pray some more and he comes back
[1:28:08] and they're asleep again
[1:28:10] says three times the third time he says
[1:28:12] come on get up the time is here
[1:28:16] the same peter that said i will not deny
[1:28:18] you
[1:28:20] but if you read the rest scriptures and
[1:28:22] so did the others say that
[1:28:24] not just peter
[1:28:27] but here's peter he says i will never
[1:28:29] now i'll go to that cross and hang with
[1:28:31] you
[1:28:32] and jesus looks up and says peter you're
[1:28:34] going to deny me three times
[1:28:37] and then you're going to hear a rooster
[1:28:38] crow
[1:28:39] and you're going to realize what you did
[1:28:42] i'm sure going through peter's mind he's
[1:28:44] going no way impossible not me i'm peter
[1:28:47] i tried to take that man's head off with
[1:28:49] a sword and i know i missed and you
[1:28:50] fixed his ear
[1:28:52] but i tried
[1:28:55] it sounds like peter didn't it
[1:28:57] the peter before the day of pentecost
[1:29:00] a peter who in his his machoism is brave
[1:29:03] i can do this i can do this
[1:29:05] and god says you are going to deny me
[1:29:10] and i think often about it when peter
[1:29:12] hears that third crow
[1:29:15] and he realizes exactly what he told me
[1:29:18] i have done
[1:29:20] so i'm just going to go back to be a
[1:29:21] fisherman
[1:29:24] i'm just going to go back to do what i
[1:29:25] used to do
[1:29:27] i'm not i can't even call him my friend
[1:29:30] anymore and i'm sure he doesn't even
[1:29:32] care for me anymore
[1:29:34] i've denied him i turned my back on him
[1:29:36] i even cursed
[1:29:41] some of us have gotten to that place
[1:29:42] maybe not cursed but our thoughts i'm
[1:29:44] going lord why would you even put up
[1:29:45] with me
[1:29:47] why would you want me look what i've
[1:29:48] done look how i am look what i even
[1:29:50] thought
[1:29:53] and he says what
[1:29:55] what i don't see nothing i'm looking at
[1:29:57] you through the blood
[1:30:00] and that's where brother brahm says in
[1:30:01] that quote there's where that peace and
[1:30:03] the rest when you realize he took care
[1:30:05] of it all for you
[1:30:07] it's not in your ability to figure it
[1:30:09] out it's not your belly the depth of
[1:30:10] your revelation and how you can explain
[1:30:13] it to everybody but can you live it
[1:30:16] is that the testimony the live life
[1:30:22] i remember many of the brothers from
[1:30:24] years ago we've been around it with for
[1:30:26] some time now since 1975
[1:30:29] this message
[1:30:31] and the testimony of many that would
[1:30:32] seem so strong
[1:30:34] and where are they now today
[1:30:36] you cannot stand on your own
[1:30:39] it takes the holy spirit in your life
[1:30:42] for you to stand
[1:30:44] peter says
[1:30:46] simon peter a servant and an apostle of
[1:30:48] jesus christ
[1:30:50] to them that have obtained the like
[1:30:53] precious faith
[1:30:56] with us through the righteousness of god
[1:31:00] and our savior jesus christ peter goes i
[1:31:03] know that peter but listen to this peter
[1:31:05] now
[1:31:07] a peter who said hang me upside down
[1:31:10] i'm not worthy to die like him
[1:31:14] and he says an apostle of jesus christ
[1:31:18] to them that have obtained the like
[1:31:21] precious faith
[1:31:22] that's me
[1:31:24] is that you
[1:31:26] amen he's speaking to you then
[1:31:29] verse 2
[1:31:31] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[1:31:34] through the knowledge of god and of
[1:31:36] jesus our lord
[1:31:38] grace
[1:31:39] unmerited favor
[1:31:41] nothing you did to deserve it but god
[1:31:43] chose to do it
[1:31:45] and don't argue with him about it
[1:31:49] he said oh i wouldn't don't let your
[1:31:51] life argue about it
[1:31:52] say it's the grace of god that has me
[1:31:54] where i am today it's god's mercy that
[1:31:56] has reached out to me it's god that has
[1:31:58] turned me around
[1:32:01] nothing good i did it wasn't that the
[1:32:03] the 12 steps of self-preservation or
[1:32:06] this specific diet or this but no it was
[1:32:08] the grace of god that reached down he
[1:32:10] says
[1:32:11] and peace
[1:32:13] and i like this definition of peace the
[1:32:15] absence of war i'm not fighting it
[1:32:17] anymore
[1:32:19] i'm giving into it the grace and peace
[1:32:21] of god i'm resting in it
[1:32:24] i don't need to stay up all night
[1:32:25] working my salvation through here
[1:32:29] that's the hardest part to deal with it
[1:32:30] with
[1:32:31] there that short space right there
[1:32:34] well if i was really saved i'd never
[1:32:36] think that way if i was really saved i
[1:32:38] would never act like that if i
[1:32:41] oh man then you're saying that the blood
[1:32:42] of jesus christ is not strong enough to
[1:32:44] save you
[1:32:45] are you putting down the work of god
[1:32:48] why didn't you just accept it why don't
[1:32:50] you just be a piece of it saying lord i
[1:32:52] surrender all
[1:32:55] when you surrender you're willing to
[1:32:56] give up the fight
[1:32:58] you realize i can't do it anyways
[1:33:02] i know a young man
[1:33:04] who was a boxer and a fighter
[1:33:08] he still may be
[1:33:10] and every time i saw him i know who lost
[1:33:14] it wasn't the other guy
[1:33:16] it was him
[1:33:17] but he did it anyways
[1:33:20] i was
[1:33:21] at the point why didn't you why don't
[1:33:22] you find a less brutal hobby
[1:33:25] because
[1:33:26] you've taken the worst of it over and
[1:33:28] over and over
[1:33:29] and i know who took the worst of it he
[1:33:31] took it off for me
[1:33:33] he took it all for me he was disfigured
[1:33:37] he was beyond recognition
[1:33:40] he didn't even have the appearance of
[1:33:42] man while he hung there
[1:33:44] for you and for me
[1:33:47] quit fighting it give it all to him
[1:33:51] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[1:33:52] through the knowledge of god and of the
[1:33:55] lord our lord jesus christ not just the
[1:33:58] understanding but when it settles it
[1:33:59] down in here and it becomes a revelation
[1:34:02] to you he paid a debt he did not owe
[1:34:06] and i owed a debt i could not pay
[1:34:10] right now
[1:34:12] if you needed three dollars i couldn't
[1:34:14] help you because i got two in my wallet
[1:34:18] if you need two i can help you if you
[1:34:20] need three i can get you have some help
[1:34:22] but he paid a debt
[1:34:24] i could not pay
[1:34:27] i had 22 dollars but she got 20 of it
[1:34:32] he had it all but he gave it to you
[1:34:35] he shared it all with you to be
[1:34:38] partakers of his righteousness of his
[1:34:41] power of his honor of his glory your mrs
[1:34:45] jesus christ
[1:34:48] now she took it to give it sister rachel
[1:34:49] to pay for the food so
[1:34:53] but you know what god meets all our
[1:34:55] needs but here he says through the
[1:34:57] knowledge of god not just knowing god
[1:35:00] but being a personal friend a personal
[1:35:04] relationship with him and of our lord
[1:35:07] jesus our lord
[1:35:08] verse 3.
[1:35:11] according as his divine power has given
[1:35:14] unto us all things that pertain unto
[1:35:17] life and godliness
[1:35:21] if you're not looking at that there's
[1:35:23] you're saying there's just not godliness
[1:35:24] in life it's not because he hasn't given
[1:35:26] it it's because you haven't yielded that
[1:35:29] portion of your life to him
[1:35:32] you're still struggling with it you're
[1:35:33] still working with it
[1:35:35] and that's a daily a daily thing
[1:35:38] if there's breath there's a struggle
[1:35:42] but the more that i surrender
[1:35:45] the more that i can humble myself
[1:35:48] the more that i can say i give it all to
[1:35:50] you lord he says
[1:35:52] and given unto us all things that
[1:35:54] pertain unto life and godliness
[1:35:58] through the knowledge of him
[1:36:00] that has called us to glory and virtue
[1:36:04] through the knowledge and it's not a
[1:36:06] mental understanding has to become a
[1:36:07] revelation in your life
[1:36:10] a revelation is active
[1:36:13] it's alive it produces something
[1:36:18] your scientists your great explorers
[1:36:20] your your men of renown one of them they
[1:36:23] put their thoughts and ideas into action
[1:36:26] it became a revelation to them it became
[1:36:28] to something where they saw it
[1:36:33] they began to see hey there is a way to
[1:36:35] get off of the horse and buggy and get
[1:36:37] on something that has a motor that's
[1:36:39] going to propel us forward and they
[1:36:40] begin to work on it
[1:36:43] the wright brothers saw them getting up
[1:36:45] off the ground and flying like maybe not
[1:36:47] exactly like a bird but flying in the
[1:36:48] air
[1:36:50] and they had to put it into action
[1:36:53] it wasn't just drawings anymore and
[1:36:55] theories it became something real
[1:36:59] when this is just not red letters in a
[1:37:01] bible but it's life in you
[1:37:04] when it becomes a revelation to you it
[1:37:06] becomes part of your life
[1:37:10] and then he says in verse 4
[1:37:14] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:37:16] great and precious
[1:37:18] promises exceeding great
[1:37:22] great
[1:37:24] great uh i don't think this is great you
[1:37:27] know when i think of great i think great
[1:37:30] they're building a new amazon plant
[1:37:32] building over here on
[1:37:34] on uh aina and silverbell now
[1:37:39] and that building is big
[1:37:41] but i haven't been inside it yet and it
[1:37:43] looks big from the outside but wait till
[1:37:45] you walk into one of those buildings
[1:37:46] before you realize how big it is
[1:37:51] it looks really big and then you got to
[1:37:52] walk through it especially if you got to
[1:37:54] work there and you got to stalk it it's
[1:37:55] going to be the biggest building you've
[1:37:56] ever seen all of a sudden
[1:37:58] when you're the one that has to put all
[1:37:59] the parts in there
[1:38:01] but great he says great be beyond you
[1:38:04] can even imagine
[1:38:07] and precious promises
[1:38:09] not something you would just take
[1:38:11] lightly
[1:38:12] something pressure something you would
[1:38:14] you would look at and you would adore
[1:38:15] you would love such promises
[1:38:18] that by these you might be partakers
[1:38:21] part of
[1:38:22] the divine nature god in you the hope of
[1:38:26] glory
[1:38:29] that's what paul was preaching
[1:38:31] christ in you is the hope of glory
[1:38:34] not he said if if you want to compare
[1:38:39] credentials let's compare them
[1:38:42] paul says i match everything
[1:38:44] better than most of you i was born of
[1:38:46] this i had this teaching i learned this
[1:38:49] i knew it
[1:38:50] he said but i count it as nothing
[1:38:54] to obtain this
[1:38:56] christ in you the hope of glory that by
[1:38:58] these he might be partakers of the
[1:39:00] divine nature having escaped corruption
[1:39:04] that is in the world through lust
[1:39:07] and we know where that started
[1:39:09] way back in the beginning
[1:39:13] there was a divine nature there was a
[1:39:14] divine nature that created
[1:39:17] the garden of eden and all the world
[1:39:20] that was god
[1:39:22] and he spoke into existence his son
[1:39:26] had nothing to do with lust
[1:39:32] and then i don't we don't know the
[1:39:33] amount of time that adam was given to go
[1:39:35] through
[1:39:36] all what he knew there and look at every
[1:39:39] animal look at everything was there
[1:39:40] because god had was going to provide for
[1:39:42] him help me
[1:39:46] somebody that was going to be part of
[1:39:48] him
[1:39:48] because
[1:39:49] you were part of god in the first place
[1:39:52] and god wanted to express that
[1:39:56] and and and here
[1:39:59] he takes eve out of the side of of adam
[1:40:03] and when adam sees there he goes this is
[1:40:05] what i've been looking for
[1:40:07] i walked through this land back and
[1:40:09] forth and up and down
[1:40:11] and i named those animals and i called
[1:40:13] this tree that and i did this and i
[1:40:15] don't know how much it took a million
[1:40:16] years
[1:40:17] five weeks really doesn't make a
[1:40:19] difference it took some time
[1:40:22] and adam goes but none of these is
[1:40:24] filling that spot
[1:40:28] and god
[1:40:29] in eternity
[1:40:31] there was something in him wanting to be
[1:40:34] a savior
[1:40:35] wanting to be a healer
[1:40:37] wanting to have friendship wanting to
[1:40:39] have a personal relationship with
[1:40:41] someone
[1:40:43] and he said i know how i'm going to do
[1:40:45] this
[1:40:46] and he says now having escaped the
[1:40:49] corruption it is in the world through
[1:40:52] lust
[1:40:53] he allowed it to happen
[1:40:57] saint thought he had pulled one on god
[1:40:59] and god said oh no you're just part of
[1:41:01] the plan
[1:41:03] the same one that went up and god said
[1:41:05] to him have you considered my servant
[1:41:07] job
[1:41:09] and he goes well yeah i watch i've been
[1:41:11] watching him closely in fact i go by
[1:41:13] every day to see if there's a way to get
[1:41:14] in but you got him hedged in
[1:41:17] you got him well protected there's a
[1:41:18] covering over him and i can't get in
[1:41:20] there
[1:41:22] but he says
[1:41:24] and god had never heard this before i'm
[1:41:25] sure no he knew exactly why satan was
[1:41:27] there
[1:41:29] and he knew job was up to the task
[1:41:33] he has you here for a reason
[1:41:37] he's not surprised
[1:41:39] he chose you for this time
[1:41:42] and he said i know they're up for it
[1:41:44] i know they will pass the test
[1:41:47] although sometimes you're wondering if
[1:41:48] you're passing the test
[1:41:51] you're going can i study it a little bit
[1:41:52] more can i work on it a little bit more
[1:41:54] but god has already seen you on the
[1:41:56] other side
[1:41:57] you were part of him
[1:42:00] and he says so i will cause this to
[1:42:01] happen
[1:42:03] therefore i can express
[1:42:06] myself back to them
[1:42:08] a god of love a god of mercy a god of
[1:42:11] healing
[1:42:12] but not just that but to get to know him
[1:42:15] personally
[1:42:19] brother lyle when you first saw sister
[1:42:20] heather and you don't have to tell us
[1:42:21] all of it but
[1:42:23] did you know she was going to be the one
[1:42:26] not that moment but a couple moments
[1:42:28] later maybe
[1:42:30] but there was a time when you realized
[1:42:31] that's the one
[1:42:34] i remember the first time i saw my wife
[1:42:36] that i looked at her i thought she was
[1:42:37] gonna drown
[1:42:39] she was walking with her head up like
[1:42:40] this walking down the aisle everybody
[1:42:43] asked me how i what i first remember she
[1:42:46] was coming on that side i was coming
[1:42:47] down this side of the spanish church and
[1:42:49] i looked over and i said who's that
[1:42:50] young lady over there
[1:42:52] oh you don't think things like that
[1:42:53] church i forgot
[1:42:57] but she walked in a way where she kind
[1:42:58] of held her head up a little bit
[1:43:00] and i said if it rains right now that
[1:43:02] girl's gonna drown
[1:43:05] but i fell in love with her anyways
[1:43:08] and she probably got the worst end of
[1:43:11] the deal and i got the best end of the
[1:43:13] deal i'm sure
[1:43:15] but you know god saw you already
[1:43:19] he knew you were
[1:43:21] and he said for them
[1:43:22] i will go and do this
[1:43:26] and he says are given to us great
[1:43:29] unto us exceeding in great precious
[1:43:31] promises
[1:43:32] that by these you might be partakers of
[1:43:35] the divine nature
[1:43:37] have an escape corruption that is in the
[1:43:39] world through lust
[1:43:45] a couple more quotes here
[1:43:50] redemption
[1:43:51] by power
[1:43:56] hallelujah to the lamb
[1:43:59] i'm so glad that i've been filled with
[1:44:00] the holy spirit tonight
[1:44:02] while we are sleeping rejoicing resting
[1:44:06] in the promise of god
[1:44:08] god promised them to make a way of
[1:44:10] escape and while we're resting on this
[1:44:12] promise god was down there before them
[1:44:15] opening up away
[1:44:16] every man and woman tonight that will
[1:44:19] accept jesus christ on those grounds the
[1:44:21] holy spirit while you're asleep while
[1:44:24] you're resting on his promise
[1:44:27] he's talking here
[1:44:29] where while they were resting they had
[1:44:31] just come out of
[1:44:32] egypt with a mighty hand they'd been
[1:44:35] delivered
[1:44:37] that's all there's to it it was a mighty
[1:44:38] hand of god that delivered them
[1:44:40] not only to take them out but they took
[1:44:42] their wealth
[1:44:43] egyptians freely gave it to them
[1:44:46] i don't know how often that happens but
[1:44:48] it's not often
[1:44:50] well brother lyle
[1:44:52] you know uh
[1:44:53] well they would have probably called you
[1:44:54] brother lyle but they would have said
[1:44:55] lyle you're leaving this company and we
[1:44:58] were so happy with you we are going to
[1:44:59] give you all the money this company has
[1:45:02] so you can leave peacefully
[1:45:05] that didn't happen did it has that ever
[1:45:07] happened to anybody unless you owned the
[1:45:09] company maybe
[1:45:10] but no
[1:45:11] most of the time you just
[1:45:13] go on we've got somebody already in your
[1:45:15] place waiting for you take your place
[1:45:18] but here god allowed the egyptians to
[1:45:20] give them all that they needed
[1:45:23] but now they get to the red sea
[1:45:26] and the very god who had performed all
[1:45:27] these miracles now they're standing and
[1:45:29] saying what
[1:45:31] god just simply said to moses why could
[1:45:33] i speak
[1:45:35] and here brother branham says while they
[1:45:36] are sleeping and resting
[1:45:40] and that's what you're supposed to do
[1:45:41] when you sleep you're supposed to rest
[1:45:43] that's the purpose of sleep is to get
[1:45:45] some rest
[1:45:47] he said god is working on the backside
[1:45:50] taking care of everything he says
[1:45:53] god was down there
[1:45:55] before them opening up a way every man
[1:45:57] and woman tonight that will accept jesus
[1:45:59] christ on those grounds the holy spirit
[1:46:02] while you're asleep while you're resting
[1:46:04] in his promise
[1:46:06] maybe you're a maybe you're
[1:46:08] blind
[1:46:09] maybe you can't hear maybe you can't see
[1:46:12] maybe you're sick heart trouble cancer
[1:46:14] or something dying
[1:46:17] accept the light tonight and rest upon
[1:46:19] it
[1:46:21] and the wind coming like a mighty
[1:46:22] russian wind on the day of pentecost
[1:46:24] will move down through there and open up
[1:46:27] a way for you
[1:46:29] just like the pillar of fire did then
[1:46:31] hallelujah and you'll pass right through
[1:46:33] that valley of sickness right into the
[1:46:35] land of health again you'll pass through
[1:46:37] the land of cold formal shackled down in
[1:46:40] different religions to a holy ghost
[1:46:42] filled happy rejoicing heart full of joy
[1:46:47] god said so
[1:46:49] that settles it
[1:46:52] but you know it's interesting and that's
[1:46:54] hard for us to do
[1:46:57] israel in the church
[1:46:59] this is what i want to finish on
[1:47:03] here's paul
[1:47:06] paul has his it
[1:47:08] what we know of paul's history anyways
[1:47:11] what's written in the scriptures
[1:47:14] but if paul had this credentials
[1:47:17] that he says
[1:47:19] if you want to share uh uh compare
[1:47:20] credentials look at mine
[1:47:22] obviously he did a lot of stunning a lot
[1:47:24] of time in the temple a lot of work to
[1:47:26] get to that place
[1:47:29] it just wasn't an inheritance dad
[1:47:30] couldn't pass it down on a piece of
[1:47:32] paper
[1:47:33] it's something paul had to go through to
[1:47:35] get to that state to know the word of
[1:47:37] god to know what this was and to tie
[1:47:39] that in that took a lot of time a lot of
[1:47:41] studying a lot of work
[1:47:43] paul did not have the the he did not
[1:47:45] pick who what line he would born god
