Jews home amen it's coming soon and it's coming soon let's let's open up our Bibles to Acts chapter 20. verse 25 sister hope if you can continue to play just for a little bit until I pray Acts chapter 20 verse number 25. foreign and now behold this is the Apostle Paul speaking and he's talking to a group of brothers he said and now behold I know that that ye all among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God shall see my face no more wherefore I take you to record this day that I am pure from the blood of all men for I have not shunned to declare unto you the whole all the counsel of God take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood for this I know that after my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears and now Brethren I commend you to God and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are Sanctified let's pray Lord God those important words of the Apostle Paul and on my heart father for weeks now I pray Lord that your anointing would be here in this service and Lord that you would bless us father with your presence Lord help me to minister your word I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated thank you Daniel if you'll stay for just a minute um I uh before we get started first let me agree all of our visitors brother Gabriel bless you my friend good to see you hey the freyjo family there in the back for the angel and sister Priscilla and family welcome it's good to see you all again God bless you and there's there's probably a few more here that I'm missing well it's always it's always sister hope I mean sister Holly your mama God bless you welcome and and brother I always forget your name what's your name yes God bless you welcome also I am I told Daniel to stay um because Daniel just went to this Camp up in Cloverdale and he came home and his he was all hoarse and and he could barely speak and uh he told me the testimony of him being there at camp and there was a reason that he was hoarse and I thought you know brother buddy I want you to I want you to tell the church maybe if you could just give a just a report of the camp that you went to this past week up at up at Cloverdale up at Mount Baker and then then we'll get into this into the message this morning God bless you all um I just wanted to give a quick testimony about what happened to me at Camp it really blessed me um so I I got I go to Camp last about two weeks ago I think on on a Wednesday and we immediately go up to camp and you know we go up there we start hanging out with the youth and then we had our first service on Thursday night and I was going and I was really excited to go to Camp I'm like you know what Lord I really want to get something from this camp and so I go to service and I just had the hardest time getting in the spirit like I I couldn't like I wasn't feeling the Lord and I was like Lord I was like what's wrong with me I was like maybe I'm nervous but then the Lord on Thursday night he um there's this young brother there who was a new Christian and uh he just got baptized like a week before the camp and the Lord put it on my heart and he said he said you need you need to be Prayed by that brother his name was leilar and I was like no I was like not not a new Christian I was like I was like I was like what can a new Christian do for me and you know and that of course is the wrong Spirit to have amen and so I was like I was like I was like maybe not Lord that's that's a little embarrassing I was like he's a really cool guy I was like you know you're becoming friends I was like maybe not and so uh Friday rolls around and we had two services in the morning and the evening and let me tell you I was just struggling with both of them I was like Lord I was like I was like what's wrong with me and I you know I started didn't get a little scared I was like you know I was like you know brother bear talks about whenever you you know lose that feeling of the Holy Spirit and I was like Lord I was like what's wrong and so you know Friday both of those Services I just couldn't get in the spirit and then Saturday Night comes around and you know it was a great great speaker great Minister and had a prayer line and I was like okay Lord I was like this this is where I'm getting it and so I go through the prayer line and they're just Godly brothers that prayed for me but I I go through and I I still didn't feel anything I was like Lord I was like I don't know I go down to my seat and I'm just defeated I'm like Lord I was like it must be me it must be I'm nervous I'm not right I was like I was like Lord I'm sorry and then I look up and it's laylar and a couple Brothers standing by the altar just praying in the circle with their arms around them and I was like I was like you know what Lord I was like I'm gonna go up there I was like I'm Gonna Stand by these brothers so I'd go up there I get my arms around these brothers and I look at lailar and laylar looks at me and he just makes a b line for me and I was like I was like oh I was like Lord this is you and so he came over and prayed for me and let me tell you guys I've never worshiped like I've worshiped like that in my life it was just such a blessing and so it ended up to where we prayed about two two and a half hours after service and we were all just calling on the name of Jesus praying for each other and it was just such a just a rejuvenation for me I feel like I got so much strength from it absolutely thank you [Applause] he was hoarse from praying that's that's how I want to be hoarse amen you know that's why it's so important as Daniel was talking I was I was thinking about this new believer and and how it was the Lord wanted him to pray for Daniel and he the Lord has his way of doing everything we have our way of doing doing what we want to do but he has his way and we need to get in line with what he wants us to do even though it might not make sense and seeing this seeing these these new people come in they bring an energy they bring life so when they're coming in welcome them and just like this young man the kids like um he's a world-class athlete that Daniel was talking to and and he just had a Zeal he had an excitement and and Daniel when he came in when he was just so excited he's like Dad this guy he just he loves the Lord and and he gave a testimony about this young man how I believe he's from Thailand I believe he came to the um to Canada and and he was in athletics or I don't know exactly what it was but he he finally found the Lord Jesus in Canada and and he's all excited and he's just he's just so happy that he finds the Lord Jesus and he's and what happens friends what happens when we receive the spirit of God into us immediately we have a burden for others that's that is what it does every single time we've been going through the book of Acts it's in the book of Acts every time they receive the spirit and then they have a burden to reach out so this young man he receives the Holy Spirit he gives his heart to the Lord and what's the first thing that he wants to do he wants his family back is it Thailand back in Thailand he wants his family to come to the Lord So Daniel did he go back there did he call him okay so so he gets excited and he wants to lead them to the Lord and have them find this same joy that he has in the Lord Jesus Christ he goes and he starts talking to him witnessing him and they're like son we gave our hearts to the Lord Jesus also his family at the same time his family had given their hearts to the Lord they knew nothing about Christ before so everybody the whole family yes God working on both ends with this it's a miracle brother John just like you just did it's a miracle God working on both sides and seeing Daniel come home and I just feeling that energy how he's so excited Lord let that not let it not become stale that's why we need more coming and then they can bring their lick of fire and this fire starts to brother Tony is fire starts to build starts to get hotter and hotter and hotter and then it affects more and more people I just I was just so bless sister Irma where's sister Irma you sang that song sister Cheryl beautiful song too oh the words of that song are are just incredible and then sister Irma where'd you there you are sister Irma sister Irma singing that song I was thinking that he hung these planets in the Solar System the miracle that happened that God whether it was a big bang or it was a big bang no matter what God Said let there be light and I guarantee you there was a bang something happened but he set all of these planets in the Solar System as their song was going and he he hung he hung the moon and the stars and and it goes on for so long I remember looking at these Stars one time and the Lord was dealing with me and I said Lord every one of these stars that I'm looking at is bigger than the rock that I'm standing on right now and you created it all and I have a problem I have problems you can handle everything Lord you are so great and I was worshiping there now and and just thanking the Lord for all of that he's done in hearing sister Irma's song but yet the greater miracle was not that he hung these stars in the sky the greater miracle was that he saved a Wretch like Me that's the greatest friends because let me tell you something those stars are not eternal they will pass away it may be billions of years but they will pass away but this right here will never pass away because I am in Jesus Christ and he is eternal and if he's Eternal I'm Eternal with him I want to be associated with this man Jesus Christ that died for my sins it gave me eternal life Mr Shirley I love him so much for it I look at my son and my daughter and serving the lord and I'm I'm just I'm so grateful I'm so thankful that that he's done so he's just he's given us so much and I was as I was thinking on I I ministered on Wednesday night on this Acts chapter 20. and what was I read the scripture at the beginning and what had happened is this man Paul he came to this place and he wanted the elders from the church at Ephesus to meet him over in this place so he gets everyone together and they they come and they have like an elders meeting or a Minister's meeting and this is Paul says this is the last time I'm going to see you and they wept because there was prophecies knowing that that when Paul left this place he was going to go to Jerusalem and there were bonds waiting for him in Jerusalem and it was going to be and everyone knew it was going to be hard but but Paul stayed with it and he said no the Lord is leading me there I know I'm going to suffer I know it's going to be hard but I'm gonna go anyways and he said but when I leave he said wolves are going to come among you and I thought about as I read that scripture over and over and over I thought about who are these wolves that are going to come in and Scatter these sheep as Paul prophesied he said that they're going to come from the outside and he said they're going to come from right in among you and I thought who are these Grievous wolves that this apostle was talking about and why was it so important for him to warn us of these wolves our lord Jesus warned us also more than once about wolves that would enter in among you it was I was thinking on this and I was thinking about Lord what do wolves do when the Bible talks about wolves it's always talking about sheep too that there's sheep out here and these sheep are defenseless and these wolves come in and they kill the Sheep and and I've had this continuing anxiety attacks since January and it's almost daily worrying about the church and just and and worrying about these precious people that are in this building now and thinking about every one of them and and thinking about Lord this is the Lord's flock of sheep as as he says many times in these Jesus constantly makes the um the comparison of us and sheep and and thinking about Lord if I was the owner of these sheep if I had a hundred sheep and I lost a couple of them it wouldn't be that big of a deal it's like well they're my sheep I'll I'll make the money on these other ones and and you know you lose one or two but these aren't my sheep these are God's sheep and God places pastors over the flock and he says you watch out for these sheep they're mine you don't lose one of them wow and you know I just think about Lord this is scary if they were mine it would be different but they're yours when you come back and say where are my sheep I had a hundred of them um they'd better everyone be there because that is what he has tasked a pastor with scares me to death I'm thinking about about these sheep and it's like Lord and there's each one of them it's different even each one of us has a personality and Lord I I pray for them and and they need help and this one goes this way and some of them I don't even like every time I walk by them they try to bite me or kick me or step on my foot or do something but they're not mine it doesn't matter I was just kidding about not they're not liking it [Laughter] I really was kidding brother Joe all of them they'll they lash out and they bite and they kick but it doesn't matter and we see sometimes that that these Shepherds that they will look at these sheep and they will try to control these sheep try to dominate these sheep for what for their own benefit and it's the way that they control them is almost always by fear I was I was thinking of as I was thinking about the sheep and I was I was thinking about Lord You're so so good you are the great Shepherd and and we we want to follow you and I was um I was thinking about that song psalm 23. and I I was thinking about it's obviously about a shepherd and and sheep and it says this it says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want you you can probably say it by by memory he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in Paths of righteousness for his namesake yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me think about that Shepherd for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me as I was thinking on that I thought thy rod and thy staff they're different they're two different they're two different things that this Shepherd uses so I started thinking about a staff I know that Jacob leaned on it on his staff when he was when he was out and and Moses had this step but Moses also had a rod and Aaron had a rod different than a staff Aaron's rod was made out of um almond wood it's a very hard wood and inside the Ark of the Covenant the Ark of the Covenant is less than four feet long and less than two feet wide so Aaron inside that Arc were two tables of stones the Ten Commandments a bowl of manna and Aaron put his Rod inside that Ark so it was small and when it was inside inside that box it butted and bore almonds so I got thinking what is this Shepherd's law thy rod and thy staff they comfort me and I thought Lord I really don't understand that so I was I was looking a little bit further and I could see that this staff this Shepherd staff he uses a tool that that when the Sheep were going he would he would take him and he would nudge them when they would get stuck maybe in a thorn bush or something some of these staffs had a hook on the end he could go and you've seen the pictures of the ones that go up and they have the hook he could go and he could grab the Sheep maybe if the Sheep was on a cliff or in a thorn bush he could go and he could pull it out to safety very kind thing with this this the staff but a rod was different this Rod was a club and so we see that dive rod comforts me Lord because I know that you have power in this rod and your staff that kindness so so this Shepherd he's got the staff and he's got this rod and this Rod sometimes had Nails sticking out of it and let me tell you the rod was not for the Sheep sometimes they use the rod on the sheep but it was not for those sheep that Rod was made to fight off the Wolves it was a club so we see that that there are two things at work this this rod and this staff and as as we go through this Valley it's shadowed by death we see sin all around us and we're here in the shadow of this and we're looking around and we see all death and destruction and horrible things around us and we're going through and we see that this great Shepherd his rod and his staff is his staff points us and his Rod fights off our enemies for us every time and this evil world that we live in fearful thing very very fearful as we go through this Valley but he says he is with us and his Rod fights off those wolves but who are these wolves that Paul was talking about to the elders at Ephesus Matthew chapter 7 listen to this verse 14. he says this the Lord Jesus speaking he says because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it wow he just narrowed it down this is a perilous time that we're in beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves ye shall know them by their fruits do men gather Grapes of thorns or figs of thistle meaning grapes don't grow in Thorn bushes and neither do figs growing thistles they grow on trees the Amplified version of this the Amplified I sometimes I use the Amplified version the Amplified means just expounded on there's some there are some extra words in there that the author took from the original translation and he put it in context for us and it says this it says by their fruits you will recognize them that is by their contrived Doctrine and self-focus do people pick grapes from grapes from Thorn bushes or figs from thistles I think about what has happened over the years and over the past 60s 70. years and I think about Lord we you sent a messenger you sent a shepherd to help us and then we see that things have changed and many times that that wolves have come in and changed the original meaning of what this man taught and it's very it's a perilous time and it's happened it's happened over time I read this quote last Sunday night but I want to read it again brother Brown said this in 1958 sign of the Messiah he says now he was speaking of Jesus he said I am the van the vine and you are the branches now the vine doesn't bear fruit of itself it only purges the branches and the branches bears fruit do you know that well then if you went to a grapevine thank you if you went to a grapevine what would you expect to find grapes if you went to watermelon vine you find watermelon if it's a fertile Vine if you went to a peach tree you'd find peaches but then if you if Christ is the vine and his members of the churches the branches what ought you to find in the church think about that The Works that I do shall you do also More Than This shall you do for I go to my father that's what we should see in the church but what do you find when you go to the church we are the Presbyterian we are the Baptist we are the Pentecostals we got the message we got this that's not Christ Christ is love because he was God how much have things changed to where even we ourselves and I know this offends people I know it doesn't and I don't I don't mean it mean to say it but the Lord keeps I really believe it's him that lays it on my heart that what have we done we have a name just like the methodists and just like the Baptist and we say oh we're on the message and what does it do it does the same thing that it's always does it divides and it says we are an elite group and you're out the quote right there puts us right in with the others I was I have a friend I know brother that he and he went on a missionary trip with this with his other brother and before they left this is way back around 1980. before they left to go on this trip they the one brother minister went to visit sister Mita Branham brother Brown's wife I don't remember if it was here in Tucson or if it was in Jeffersonville but he goes and he spends some time with her he wanted to talk with her about the message and about brother Branham well they he spends time with her he meets this other brother they get on a plane and they fly to go overseas and they had this long time to talk and he says I was talking with brother branham's wife and he said these words he says you know he said it's amazing that his brother branham's own family didn't understand his message think about that it's amazing that brother branham's family didn't understand his own message and then after and after just 10 or 15 years this brother goes and he visits with sister Branham and and brother branham's own wife let me tell you Stephanie knows my message better than anyone I talk with her about it every day and after just 15 years even his own wife didn't even recognize the message what it had become because it had changed so much and now after all of these years it has changed to the point where I don't even think brother Branham would recognize it and it's not what he preached don't lay a lot of this stuff on him that man was a great man and he preached the gospel and not only did he preach it he showed us what happens when the Holy Spirit is in a man could it be could it be that these wolves that were prophesied to come that they came in preaching their own message that would benefit them and ruined it thank God that we have the prophet on tape could it be Jesus warned us brother Branham said he says we are Presbyterian We Are Baptist we are Pentecostal we got the message we've got this he said that's not Christ when Jesus was was with his disciples it was the closing hours of his life on Earth and Jesus in Matthew chapter 23 and 24 he goes to the he goes to the temple and he preaches to these Pharisees and Sadducees he says things like you try to honor the prophets of old and he says your fathers are the ones that put them in there in the grave he says you honor them he says you garnish their tombs and and and you you take you build these monuments to them and he said your fathers are the ones that put them in there one after the other he he he tells them he says he says this he says woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites because you build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepulchers or sepulchers of the righteous and say if we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them of the blood of the prophets sounds familiar wherefore ye be witness unto yourselves that you are the children of them which killed the prophets this is Jesus talking this isn't me wherefore ye be Witnesses unto yourselves that you are the children of them that killed the prophets fill ye up then a measure of your fathers ye serpents you Generation of Vipers how can you escape the damnation of hell wow he's talking about these wolves that would come in and Destroy these prophets message and then you know the disciples were probably like whoa wow that was intense up there on that Temple mount so they get alone with Jesus a little while later they're up in the on the Mount of Olives which is just across the Valley from the temple Matthew 24 Jesus says this as he set up on the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world Matthew 24 verse 4. and Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you he's warning the same thing Paul warned in the scripture that I read earlier there's coming he's saying that there's coming a deceiving spirit in the church and that deceiving Spirit can take many different forms it says take take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am the Christ and shall deceive many it says so many shall come in my name and say that I am the Christ unto Steve many whose name are they coming in Jesus they're preaching Jesus and they'll come in my name and he says it's many I've never met maybe I don't I don't ever remember me ever meeting anyone that said that he is Christ and deceived anybody but but Jesus is saying that many will come and do that so many will come in my name and maybe they're saying that Jesus is the Christ and shall deceive still deceive many and you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famine and pestilence and earthquakes in diverse places all these are the beginning of Sorrows then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake and then many shall be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another so Jesus is saying that this spirit and it's a religious spirit this spirit is going to come into the church and it's going to cause hatred and Division and I'm not saying that this is message churches I'm saying that this is Christianity all over the place and saying that this is going to come in but we do see that spirit and deceive many and you look at what happens inside the churches and you see that they fight and they gossip it's not normal we shouldn't do that you see within the families you think you see the fighting and and all that that's not normal we shouldn't do that you say I don't hate anyone but then you get offended at any little thing it's not right Jesus here is saying that all these things are coming into the church and you are going to be out there as sheep among wolves and many Prof false prophets shall rise and deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold so all of this we see this coming in and what it is we see that that this Spirit gets such control over the people and we see it Through the Ages you just read history we see that this Spirit gets such control over the people that it and and the people are so afraid of of the hierarchy they're so afraid of of the pastor or the church or whatever it is they're so afraid of getting kicked out or being or being ostracized that they'll sell their own family out that that what what the most important thing is that they're accepted and they'll look at their family and betray them the love of many shall wax cold and we see it we see it today and I think many of us it hits close to home that the fear that Satan puts over the people and and we're so afraid of the church or we're so afraid of the pastor where's the fear of God brother Leo that's who we should be afraid of and don't and and stand and and it's to stand up against against these things brother Branham said himself he was when he dedicated the the Branham Tabernacle he had this Vision beautiful vision and the Lord he said basically Lord where's my church and he showed them all the skies and and brother Branham wrote second Timothy chapter four on a piece of paper and put it just as Paul did saying wolves are going to come in put it in a piece of paper and put it on the on the in the Cornerstone of the brown Tabernacle I'm not talking about the Tabernacle Church I'm talking about the ministry that was to come I'm not saying anything about the Bram Tabernacle I'm saying that brother Branham put this in there and it says this for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall they heat for themselves teachers having itching ears that scripture these teachers having itching ears they shall Heap for themselves the congregation shall put these teachers in place and they will dictate what is said from the pulpit you know why because the pastor is afraid that if he if he crosses the line that the people will leave he fears that I know I I have feelings that I've never felt before in being in this position so I know I can I can relate to that and brother Branham put that in there saying that this Spirit was going to come and it's the spirit of of division in this the spirit of not standing up for what is right with God we see that the way of the world today is never making a stand for anything I talked about on um Wednesday night I talked about Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs have you seen have you heard about this new this new uh I don't know if it's out yet or whatever new movie about Snow White you heard about it there's no doors there's there's no little people because they were afraid that if they have seven dwarfs that they're going to offend the little people so what did it do it upset them because these poor actors they don't get the job and it's all because everybody is afraid of offending anyone else and when you do that you offend everyone because there's no one that will make a stand there's no one that will really stand up for what's right and then it says that they shall turn their ears from the truth and shall be turned to Fables we worry more about what our friends are going to think rather than our decisions that we make rather than these things that please the Lord I was really friends it's really in my heart we have to have that relationship with Christ that is what a church is for this church comes together to support each other to have that relationship with the Lord Jesus and don't fear don't ever be afraid if you are afraid Satan is the author of fear we should fear God of course that we should please him but not man so if we really are fearing something who do we have faith in do we have faith in Satan or do we have faith in God never fear fear is is the opposite of love I remember I was years ago we were living in Jeffersonville I want to make sure you know I'm not saying anything about any church when I said that brother Ben placed that scripture in the Cornerstone I'm for everybody I I I I'm for the church is getting people together and loving the Lord but he placed that there saying that that the people we're going to turn from what's the truth to fables not so much not that church but I believe my interpretation of it that they would turn to something that was not true I was this is a sad story I I was um we lived in Jeffersonville and we came out to Tucson and uh some uh some people that I knew that that I used to go to church with they um uh one of the brothers died and the kids were all there and none of the kids were serving the lord anymore and I went there and I talked to them and and I said what what what's going on why why aren't you why aren't you serving the lord why don't you why don't you believe anymore and they said listen they said our dad the girl said that if we put makeup on our face that our faces would fall off they said how could we believe something like that threatening them all the time this Dad threatening these kids that if you do this then it's you're gonna that Satan's gonna attack you not not not presenting it in the right way not presenting it in love presented in in the way that it should be presented for First Timothy Chapter 2 says this it says Paul says I exhort therefore I exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving thanks be made for all men Paul's going to give some correction here and it's correction that we in our message churches that we use for Kings and for all that are in Authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all goodness godliness and honesty First Timothy chapter two brother Jeremy for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our savior verse number four who will have all men to be saved and come unto the knowledge of the truth for there is one God and one mediator between God and Men the man Christ Jesus who gave himself for a ransom for all to be testified in due time not anyone else the Lord Jesus himself where unto mine or brother Jeremy am I in the wrong place I'm sorry I meant First Timothy yeah thank you First Timothy chapter 2 verse 7 where unto I am ordained a preacher and an apostle I speak the truth in Christ and I lie not a teacher of the Gentiles of faith in faith and Verity I therefore that all men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting how many of us are doing that other translations say that I desire that in every place men should pray lifting up holy hands without anger and without quarreling we leave this part of the message out there shouldn't be any fighting there should be any anger among us there shouldn't be any attacking each other Jesus told us that we're in the last days and the love of many would wax cold verse number nine in like manner also that women Adorn themselves in modest apparel with shame-facedness and sobriety not with broided hair or gold or Pearl or costly array but which becometh the women professing godliness with good works so in Even in our very lives even in the way that we dress we should represent our lord Jesus in every way that says let a woman learn in Silence with all subjection but I suffer suffer not a woman to teach nor a serp authority over the man but to be in silence for Adam was first formed and then Eve and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith and charity and holiness and sobriety so in this chapter that's used so much Paul is bringing out the reason why even in a very close that we wear should represent the Lord Jesus and a man should be praying all the time with with with sincerity of heart not quarreling not fighting but doing his best to serve God in every single way then that's when we see things happen but wolves friends have taken these scriptures out of context and taken what brother Branham said out of context and used it not as a staff but use it as a club to beat people and drive them away and put fear into them well excommunicates you if you don't line up we'll kick you out of church if you don't do it it's not right there are reasons to do that and Paul laid those out but it's not because of my Ministry brother Aaron it's not because of what I say remember with my kids growing up and Daniel and Madeline and saw that like all kids they stray and they do things wrong and I remember my daughter was talking to this young man that I knew this was not right and and I'll tell you in in parents growing up a lot of times when it's a boy or a girl that's when you see your children leave so with my daughter I laid down the law and I said you will not see this young man in fact I called him and I say if I ever see your face again it'd be the worst day of your life and I I was serious that Rod had Nails in it and and what kept my daughter at home what kept her from running off there was a foundation built and it's in that first Timothy that I just read that it was a foundation built not because of me telling them and threatening them you're gonna you're gonna do this and your face is going to fall off and and all of these nonsense things and me not living the life but she had love at home and we we build this this church and we we build our our lives and Friends it is so important that we are representing the Lord Jesus Christ at home first and when my daughter told me she listened she she did what I I said and I told her I said it's me or him I was firm on it because I knew and thank God I did it I'm so grateful that I did it because she's got the best husband that you could ever meet as far as a as far as a husband and a good kid now and and when I was talking to her just me and her we we set up a date night that we would go out once a week once every couple weeks and it was just me and me and her and it and I would we would talk and and I said sweetheart I'm just proud of you and you know what she said she said Dad she said Do You Remember when you'd pray she said you know I heard you I said I said what sweetie she said you'd go into the middle bedroom and she said I could hear you through the wall and that's what built it up it wasn't what I told her it wasn't that I threatened her it wasn't that I took a staff and beat her it was because she witnessed her dad in that other room praying she said I couldn't hear what you said but I knew from the tone of your voice that you were praying she said she said dad and and she said you know I would listen everything that I could say every scripture or every quote or whatever it was it would be meaningless if I didn't live that life to back it up we should be living that life or our testimonies thrown right out the window how many times do I hear criticism hear criticism of people not looking like like people think that they should look or or this person's not he doesn't she he doesn't line up the way I think it should be or she doesn't line up the way that I think it should be and I look at their lives the people that are saying that you're gonna be kidding me that's what did it for my daughter was her dad in that room praying even though she couldn't even hear what I was saying I didn't know she could hear what I I didn't even know that's why I went in that room because it was private and yet that's what won my daughter was her dad living I look at my son so proud of the kid you know and then and the Lord dealing with him and going there you know what one him is the four o'clock in the morning me getting up and studying and praying and the little guy getting up with me for years doing that wasn't what I told him it was the example that I set and even with all my failures and the kids knowing my wife knows that I've got many of them but setting that example and then when the wolves come in get them dad I'll pull that club in no way not my kids and the same thing friends with all of us in this church we're all Shepherds to a certain extent and we're all sheep there's a time to pull that club and you better have the life to back it up you better do it because Jesus warned brother Branham warned that these times were coming this they wouldn't endure sound doctrine that all of this strangeness and all of this weirdness would would follow and and we see people are so afraid that they're going to be kicked out and they're so afraid what other people going to think what about what God thinks of your life he knows what you're doing in your private time you can point all your fingers all you want God knows exactly what you are doing and let me tell you let me give you a warning don't be pointing fingers because they'll be three point right back at you I've made that mistake let me tell you I lived as legalistic and as right and I still do as I can but I've realized that Lord I'm a failure just like sister Irma singing that song wow I am the miracle I Lord I don't know how why what but thank God you saved me thank God that you did it for me that that you took care of me because I'm a failure I'm a sinner and I've done I've done everything wrong and I look and the reason was a simple thing and being in prayer you go into your closet and pray in private and then God took takes care of it with our kids and it's never too late it is never don't ever think that that because you're old or whatever you will always be a mother you will always be a father if you have children those that time never ends and you always watch out for them you always take care of them and when those wolves come in and try to ruin everything then you can fight them off because you have set that example when I said that about sister Brandon when I heard that I thought Lord this is exactly what he said don't do I read the quote Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal the message and what do we do we go and do the same thing and what does it do it cuts people out and it puts fear in the people that they are trying to please man rather than pleasing God and it destroys everything you know what it does it takes the love out of the people it takes the love out of the believers there's there's one more scripture I wanted to read I'm so far off my nose brother Jeremy if you could put up first John first John 4 17. it's dominated by fear herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us the musicians could come friends I want us to get back to this original word to get back to Pentecost to get back to to what God has ordained for us but then when we go and we we change what he said and we we denominate it it pulls the spirit out because there's no love there it destroys it the reason my family is was as close to brother Branham as any other family both sides and the thing about brother Branham was when they would get around him he had absolute love no matter what they were doing I look at the two sides of my family look at the one side that was a rough group now look the other side my mom's side was a very very clean and very um Pious group yet he treated both of them the same and how much he how what an example he sent to the people so much that they would do whatever he said because he had such love and there is no fear and love he would never beat the people like we see today and try to instill fear in them think about I just I want to say it people get hurt they get hurt because of being condemned and being beaten down and then they do what we call they leave the message how can you leave something if it's not a denomination how ridiculous is that statement they leave did they leave Christ that's different but they leave this what they're doing is they're leaving they're leaving it because it didn't take hold at the beginning and maybe it wasn't presented in the right way in love so we need to present this in love and present this to our children and you young people when you grow up when you have a family put God first all of the time that we spent in our devotions studying the Bible all of the time that my family and I we spent praying together that we spent listening to the message to to reading and and all of that it pays dividends in the future I promise you love your kids love your families for God loved us and that's the difference between those two staffs bless me so much you got the staff and you got the club the staff is for our families and the sheep and the club is to fight off those wolves and you got to use both of them you got to have them both God bless you all brother Aaron Lord prepare to be a sanctuary [Music] pride and truth [Music] sanctuary [Music] for you oh Lord foreign [Music] sanctions [Applause] [Music] can I say something here for this dude my girls used to ask me dad or tell me we're growing up now not say you know your grandpa he calls me still and he says Dad as a son it's cold out there are you wearing a jacket it's hot out there do you have water because he's still my father Yes amen he still cares now I'm always care for you yes greater Is Our Father oh amen it means so much friends there it is prophesied and we have seen them every one of you just like I have seen these wolves come in and Destroy and divide and to make it about themselves rather than lifting up the Lord Jesus never fear a man never fear what he says fear God in him only because that man [Music] if he's right he's going to point you to the one that can take care of you the one that can can take care of any problem [Music] but another one will point you to himself and do it with fear it's Bower heads [Music] I believe that he'll be right tonight [Music] if we devote [Music] a service to prayer [Music] if you would want to come tonight and be with us here at the church and sing a few songs and and just pray to the to the one that the one that hung the Stars the Sun and the Moon and the sky the vote some prayer to worshiping him tonight there's nothing that I could ever say or anybody that's else that could ever say that could take that place of spending a little bit of time in prayer with our savior [Music] so we'll have the church open tonight [Music] we can we can gather together you know there was a time when they gathered together for a prayer meeting and the walls shook from the power of God Lord Let Us return to that father protect us from these wolves that come in Lord let us stand for your gospel let us stand for what's what's right Lord it is written in your word that though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me Lord you're with us and pray Lord that we could we could just get closer to you and thank you father I pray for our congregation that you would protect us from this spirit that the Apostle Paul warned about the spirit that Jesus warned about [Music] Lord that we would look out for each other take care of each other lift each other up and warn each other and strengthen each other Lord May a unity and a love be in this in this congregation Lord that that we wouldn't let one fall we wouldn't let one leave Lord we would bring them back through love the love of Jesus Christ let us be strong in this day Lord I pray for every single one that's here today to give them strength in Jesus name friends if you would with our heads still bowed if you'd have someone on your heart [Music] there's someone that that needs a touch from the Lord or someone that that's maybe struggling or a wayward sheep Lord looking down on us now if you would raise your hand on behalf of that person Lord as the hands are raised the thoughts of these people in the hearts I pray that your holy spirit will go get those sheep may your Holy Spirit father protect them and guide them for there on this Sunday there was someone that lifted their hand for this person Lord I pray that you would honor that in the name of Jesus Christ amen as I said let's pray tonight I think it'd be good for us you're welcome to come here the church and and we'll uh we'll sing a couple songs and and then we'll pray and if you can't come to the church friends spend time in the closet with him it'll do you good I promise you the more time you spend with the Lord Jesus the more time you're going to want to spend with him do it encourage each other love one another God bless you all I had in my notes to encourage them to come to church My Friends Church isn't here to beat you over the head the church is here to encourage you it's good for you to come I pray that that uh we can see more of of everyone coming here and fellowshipping with one another because there's strength in numbers I want to be together God bless you all if the Lord willing to see you tonight in our prayer meeting whatever hey my sins nothing but the blood of Jesus what can make me whole again nothing but the blood of Jesus oh preciousness [Music]
