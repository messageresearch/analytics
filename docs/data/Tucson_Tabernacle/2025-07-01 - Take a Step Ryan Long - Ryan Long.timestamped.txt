[15:47] [Music]
[15:48] The words to that song say, I'll never
[15:51] know.
[15:52] And it made me think about Mary after
[15:54] she had heard from the angel said that
[15:58] and she pondered those things
[16:01] and she does have a little a little baby
[16:04] and watches him grow pondering that
[16:09] and all the time it was God working all
[16:12] the time it was God doing what he hadn't
[16:14] planned. Maybe now how you see it and
[16:16] how I see it and sometimes we wonder God
[16:18] where are you? But he's working all the
[16:21] time. He's bringing everything
[16:23] accomplished.
[16:25] We would maybe make the road go
[16:27] differently. We would say, "Lord, it
[16:28] would have been better, but he knows
[16:29] best."
[16:31] We thank him for that.
[16:33] Sister Shirley Moore asked us to
[16:35] remember
[16:37] for a man she met outside the church who
[16:39] was in a car accident. I told him we
[16:41] would pray for him and the church, the
[16:45] church would. So, didn't have the name
[16:48] of the person, but Lord knows who that
[16:50] is
[16:53] that says, "Please pray for my little
[16:55] sister, Kelly Dripper." Says she needs
[16:58] all the help we can give her through
[17:01] prayer. As much as we see sometimes
[17:05] wonder, Lord, where are you? God answers
[17:08] prayer
[17:09] in his time. Amen.
[17:12] Sister Merrily says, "Please pray for my
[17:16] sister Sue,
[17:19] I believe that's Wilson, she has
[17:22] pulmonary fibrosis and is on oxygen uh
[17:25] most of the time. She's also a widow and
[17:28] is trying to live on her own, but it's
[17:30] very hard. You know, she's not on her
[17:33] own. God is with her.
[17:36] He's an everpresent help in the time of
[17:38] trouble.
[17:39] So pray with me. And she lives in
[17:42] Montana. So she's part of our family
[17:45] here then because our sister's part of
[17:48] our family and if our Lord can be
[17:50] touched by the filling of our
[17:51] infirmities and he would give his life
[17:53] for it then how much more would we say
[17:57] Lord if you have a need something you
[17:59] want to raise your hand and say Lord
[18:01] remember me. So Lord, as as you've heard
[18:04] these requests and they don't come as a
[18:06] surprise to you, you didn't have to stop
[18:09] and try to figure out how you're going
[18:10] to, Lord, you've already provided.
[18:13] And we just want to say thank you. Every
[18:14] hand that is raised and every heart
[18:17] represented, those that are listening
[18:18] in, Lord, and those that might hear this
[18:21] at another time, Lord, you're still the
[18:23] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[18:26] Lord, if we have failed you, and we know
[18:28] we do, Lord, if we have failed one
[18:30] another, we forgive one another as
[18:32] you've forgiven us, Lord. And we thank
[18:34] you for that, Lord. And as as our
[18:36] brother Ryan here this morning, Lord,
[18:39] that you would just give him that that
[18:41] assurance even right now that all is
[18:43] well, Lord. What you've placed in his
[18:45] heart and you'll feed you'll give to us
[18:48] what we have need of, Lord. We thank you
[18:50] for all things, Lord. And as the
[18:52] offering is taken up, Lord, may we be we
[18:55] be willful givers, Lord. Chill cheerful
[18:58] givers, Lord. And it be put to the use
[19:00] that you have designed it for, Lord. We
[19:02] thank you, Lord. We give you glory and
[19:05] honor for what you've already answered
[19:07] and done for us, Lord. In Jesus Christ's
[19:09] name. Amen.
[19:14] You may be seated. If Sister Naomi would
[19:16] make way, let's just sing that chorus
[19:18] one more time. And here I am to worship.
[19:24] Here I am to bow down. Here I am to say
[19:32] that you're my God.
[19:36] You're all together
[19:39] worthy.
[19:41] All together

[20:12] of Jehovah.
[20:15] Paul preached that all is lost save
[20:22] Christ.
[20:24] John said he is precious
[20:28] by leaning on his bosom.
[20:32] So for a moment
[20:35] may I humbly
[20:37] testify?
[20:40] Did I mention
[20:43] that I love him? How I worship
[20:48] and adore him when I could see
[20:55] he made a way
[20:58] for me.
[21:00] And did I mention
[21:03] he's been faithful
[21:05] to every promise he ever made me?
[21:11] I love him.
[21:14] That's all I have to say.
[21:19] How many sermons
[21:22] can be preached about my Jesus?
[21:27] How many songs
[21:30] can be sung about God's son?
[21:35] There are not enough words,
[21:40] enough notes in the music
[21:44] to tell the story of all myior.
[21:51] [Music]
[21:53] Did I mention
[21:55] that I love him? How I worship
[22:00] and adore him?
[22:03] When I could sing a way, he made a way
[22:10] for me.
[22:12] And did I mention
[22:15] he's been faithful
[22:17] to every promise he ever gave me? I love
[22:24] him. That's all I want to say.
[22:30] And I
[22:33] faithful
[22:35] to every promise he ever made me. I love
[22:42] him.

[32:30] what this word is about.
[32:33] all the other things,
[32:36] all the other doctrines, all the other
[32:37] stuff that will all fall into place. But
[32:40] really, the sum of the whole matter is
[32:43] to serve God and to know that God loves
[32:46] you and he cares. He knows your name.

[33:56] then if we are truly Christians,
[34:00] everyone around us should be blessed.
[34:04] That includes the people that live next
[34:06] door. They should be blessed. They
[34:09] should be blessed number one, first and
[34:11] foremost, by our prayers, but second,
[34:13] they should be blessed by just having an
[34:16] outpost of Jesus Christ right next to
[34:19] them.
[34:20] All blessings should rest upon if we are
[34:24] truly walking in the light of Jesus
[34:26] Christ. Then you know when you turn on a
[34:29] light the darkness just flees away.
[34:32] That's right. And if we are walking in
[34:35] that light everywhere we walk, it should
[34:38] just be light. It should be spreading
[34:40] all all over the place. And that
[34:42] includes that includes our neighborhood
[34:44] here. So um Janette and Ben, welcome.
[34:48] Thanks for coming. We we we appreciate
[34:50] you. Thanks to all of our visitors.
[34:52] Yeah,
[34:59] Sister Connie. It's good to have you
[35:00] back in service. God bless you. Welcome,
[35:03] Heath and Melissa, my friends. Welcome
[35:07] those uh those Miller boys, man. You
[35:10] boys are first class. It's good good to
[35:12] have you in service. God God bless you.
[35:20] I'm just grateful, friends. I'm grateful
[35:22] that we have a church that stands for a
[35:25] a living God, a resurrected Christ, and
[35:29] one and and to live our lives like
[35:32] Christians. Jesus said, "Prefer the
[35:36] other person." And it's just that
[35:39] simple. He did it. He died on the cross
[35:41] preferring the other person. And we
[35:43] should do do the same. Whether it be for
[35:45] our wives, husbands, our children, our
[35:48] parents, our neighbors, brothers and
[35:52] sisters in church, whatever it might be.
[35:54] Always prefer
[35:56] the other person. Uh for tonight's
[35:58] service, we will uh I want to have a
[36:01] prayer service tonight and I want to
[36:03] start um answering some questions. I
[36:07] asked the congregation if you have
[36:09] something on your heart you want to know
[36:11] maybe it could be anything it'd be how
[36:13] do I overcome this it be it could be
[36:16] brother Daniel how do you stand on
[36:17] certain certain doctrines it could be
[36:20] why do our church why does our church do
[36:21] this or it could be um I don't
[36:24] understand this scripture write them
[36:25] down put them in the box give them give
[36:28] them to uh one of the officials in the
[36:30] church or their wives and get them to me
[36:32] tonight I want to I got a I got a really
[36:36] sweet question from Sister Elizabeth uh
[36:40] Gara and it's a question that I just
[36:42] didn't get from herds that I've got from
[36:44] other ones is that when I pray
[36:49] how can I get all these voices out of my
[36:51] head and how can I really just approach
[36:56] the Lord in the right way and I think
[36:59] that that's a
[37:02] a question that I don't know if there's
[37:05] one that would be more important
[37:06] important than that one. So, I'll be
[37:09] talking about that maybe 15 minutes, 20
[37:12] minutes. I just want to just have just
[37:14] that one question tonight and then I'll
[37:16] just talk 15 20 minutes and then let's
[37:18] put it into action. Let's pray tonight.
[37:21] Amen. We do that. Um I want to announce
[37:27] uh brother Steve Robson and and the
[37:30] Flagstaff Church where brother Ryan here
[37:32] is from. They're having their annual
[37:34] meetings August 1st through the 3rd up
[37:38] in Flagstaff
[37:40] and uh Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
[37:43] Um ministers are Evan Kerion and Daryl
[37:47] Ward will be ministering.
[37:49] Um
[37:51] I've heard of heard those names, but I
[37:53] don't know either of them. But I do know
[37:56] brother Steve Robson and I know that
[37:58] he's uh he has good discernment with
[38:02] ministers.
[38:03] So please uh I want to encourage the
[38:06] church to attend those meetings. Again,
[38:07] that's August 1st through 3rd. And we're
[38:09] not having camp this year. So even if
[38:11] the youth wanted to plan a trip up,
[38:14] maybe the church could help in in some
[38:16] way with transportation or something
[38:17] like that. So that's August 1st through
[38:20] 3rd. And uh from that same church, a
[38:24] dear friend of mine, Brother Ryan Long,
[38:27] I first heard Brother Ryan preach, I
[38:30] don't know, a year and a half
[38:33] ago or so at a minister's meeting. And I
[38:37] saw in Brother Ryan something that I
[38:41] think is so rare in the world today. And
[38:44] that is a man that is an individual that
[38:48] has his own walk with the Lord and has
[38:50] his own understanding of the scriptures.
[38:53] And he's not dependent maybe on an
[38:55] organization or maybe a way of thinking.
[38:57] I believe he's dependent on the Holy
[38:59] Spirit. He's not perfect. None of us are
[39:01] are perfect, of course. But when I heard
[39:04] him speak, there was something in my
[39:06] heart that uh that really drew me to
[39:10] him.
[39:11] And I know that we've heard him. We've
[39:13] heard brother Ryan preach a number of
[39:16] times over the past year and a half or
[39:19] so here and and he's been a blessing to
[39:21] me and and I told brother Ryan yesterday
[39:25] I said you know said a pastor is a
[39:29] shepherd
[39:31] and I try to lead the sheep to the green
[39:34] fields and I try to lead the sheep to
[39:37] the good nutritious food but there's
[39:40] sometimes there's vitamins that I just
[39:43] can't give them. And I want to bring in
[39:47] maybe others that maybe are full of
[39:49] those vitamins that can give that
[39:52] vitamin that maybe the pastor can't
[39:54] give. I'm still I'm still looking after
[39:56] the sheep and I want them to be nice and
[39:58] fat in the gospel.
[40:03] And I'm doing my best, brothers and
[40:05] sisters. So, so join me in welcoming our
[40:08] brother Ryan Long from Flagstaff here.
[40:11] And brother Ryan, feel free. I feel like
[40:15] these are your friends now. You know
[40:17] them and they love you and you love
[40:19] them.
[40:20] [Applause]
[40:24] You're worthy of it all.
[40:32] You're worthy of it all.
[40:35] [Music]
[40:39] For from you are all things
[40:42] and to you are all things.
[40:46] You deserve the glory.
[40:49] [Music]
[40:53] You're worthy of it all.
[40:56] [Music]
[41:00] You're worthy of it all.
[41:07] For from you are all things
[41:11] and to you are all things.
[41:15] You deserve the glory. One more time.
[41:18] You're worthy of it all. Why don't you
[41:20] just lift up your hands worship worthy
[41:23] of it all.
[41:24] [Music]
[41:28] You're worthy of it all.
[41:35] For from you are all things and to you
[41:40] are all things.
[41:43] You deserve the glory.
[41:47] Amen.
[41:49] Amen. Before we approach our scripture,
[41:52] let's just approach the author this
[41:54] morning. If you would just bow your
[41:55] heads.
[41:57] Heavenly Father, Lord, we can never,
[41:59] Lord, pray enough to you, Lord. And
[42:03] we want to just approach you, Lord,
[42:05] before we open your word, Lord, and
[42:06] before we set aside this small portion
[42:11] of time, Lord, and we want to just
[42:13] prepare the ground, Lord. And Lord, if
[42:15] there be any distractions, Lord, in my
[42:18] mind or in the in the mind of those that
[42:20] are listening this morning, may we just
[42:22] even just for a time, Lord, would you
[42:23] help us set those aside, Father, and may
[42:25] we just receive from your throne this
[42:27] morning, Lord. May you just take Lord
[42:29] just words on a page and words from a
[42:33] insufficient person Lord and may you
[42:35] just expound those Lord to the hearts of
[42:37] your people Lord may you just protect
[42:39] their ears Lord protect their hearts
[42:41] Lord
[42:43] Lord we don't want to come here out of
[42:45] ritual Lord and want to come here
[42:47] because it's a custom Lord we want to
[42:48] come because it's a fountain of life and
[42:51] Lord that we can't live unless we get
[42:53] another drink of life from you this
[42:55] morning Lord we can't live, Lord, unless
[42:58] we get another taste of bread from you
[43:00] this morning, Lord, that this is what
[43:01] you mean to us, Lord. This is what your
[43:03] word means to us. And Lord, would you
[43:06] just help us, Lord, to surrender for
[43:09] this for this time, Lord, and may we see
[43:12] from that, Lord, just
[43:14] Lord, blessings that we just can't
[43:16] account for, Lord, in our lives and
[43:18] change, Lord. We just want to approach
[43:20] your your word now and with the the
[43:23] sanctity and and the holiness that it
[43:25] deserves. and we just love you, Lord. We
[43:27] just want to tell you that and we
[43:28] believe that you love us, Lord. But just
[43:30] help us to to make way for you this
[43:32] morning, Father, in Jesus name. Amen.
[43:35] Let's read a scripture. If you have your
[43:38] Bibles or you want to turn in Psalms 37,
[43:44] two verses. Thank you, brother Daniel.
[43:46] Thank you, Dan. Brother Daniel Jr. as
[43:48] well, the musicians. Just a real
[43:50] inspired worship service this morning.
[43:53] How many feels his presence here with
[43:55] you this morning? Amen. And if you
[43:58] don't, you know, maybe just uh take
[44:01] another look around. Maybe just
[44:04] let him
[44:07] show you how mighty he is and let him
[44:10] show you how good he is.
[44:12] Psalms 37 verse 23 and 24 it reads like
[44:16] this. The steps of a good man are
[44:19] ordered by the Lord, and he delightth in
[44:22] his way. Though he fall,
[44:25] he shall not be utterly cast down. For
[44:28] the Lord upholdeth him with his hand.
[44:32] You may be seated as I turn to one more
[44:34] scripture if you want to turn or if you
[44:36] want to note it down. First Peter
[44:38] chapter 2.
[44:49] 1 Peter chapter 2, we'll read a first,
[44:53] let's see, five verses here, starting
[44:54] with verse 21. For even here unto were
[44:57] you called, because Christ also suffered
[45:00] for us, leaving us an example,
[45:05] that you should follow in his steps,
[45:08] who did no sin. We just heard that in
[45:11] the song a few moments ago about Jesus
[45:14] Messiah did no sin neither was guile
[45:16] found in his mouth who when he was
[45:18] reviled reviled not again.
[45:22] And if I just read this scripture I just
[45:24] want to say thank you to brother Dan as
[45:25] always for the invitation and um it's
[45:29] it's always a pleasure to come down and
[45:30] speak to the saints and the people here
[45:33] in in Tucson. Uh, I really do feel like
[45:36] it's a a family and I've just come to
[45:40] know uh some and maybe most of you and
[45:43] just a real love and I hope that comes
[45:46] through in the message that it it's more
[45:47] than just coming up here and repeating
[45:49] words or saying words, but it's a real
[45:51] love that I have for the people and um I
[45:54] hope that that comes across in the
[45:56] message. I certainly love brother Dan
[45:57] and his family and the church here and
[45:59] just um sorry I just want to calm my
[46:03] nerves a little bit. So, I just uh maybe
[46:05] I start talking a little bit, but I pray
[46:06] that the Lord would just come and help
[46:08] me this morning. And you know, the
[46:10] scripture is talking about Christ um
[46:13] leaving us an example. And if I look at
[46:15] the example that Christ leads, it uh
[46:17] it's a pretty high standard that Christ
[46:20] leaves for us to follow. Would you agree
[46:21] with that? Um, when I look at this and I
[46:24] look at the steps that I'm supposed to
[46:26] follow at as a human being in 2025, when
[46:28] somebody reviles against me, when
[46:31] somebody does something against me
[46:32] that's wrong, you know, if I had the
[46:35] spirit of Christ, I would not do wrong
[46:36] back to them. Amen. And, you know, maybe
[46:40] we don't maybe I don't do wrong back to
[46:42] them in my actions or with my my
[46:45] physical body, but I wonder if sometimes
[46:47] I think about it in my heart or in my
[46:48] mind about doing something back to
[46:50] somebody.
[46:52] But Christ led us gave us an example
[46:54] that even when he was reviled, he
[46:56] reviled not again. And when he suffered,
[46:59] and boy, we suffer, don't we?
[47:02] He threatened not, but committed himself
[47:04] to him that judges righteously,
[47:07] who his own self bear our sins in his
[47:10] body on the tree, that we being dead to
[47:12] sin should live unto righteousness, by
[47:15] whose stripes you were healed.
[47:18] For as you were sheep going astray,
[47:24] but are now returned unto the shepherd
[47:26] and bishop of your souls.
[47:30] And I think this first verse, if I if I
[47:32] maybe had a I don't know about a
[47:33] subject, I'm not real good at subject or
[47:35] titles, but
[47:37] just something I've been thinking about
[47:38] a lot lately is just about about
[47:41] footsteps in the Bible and about making
[47:44] progress and about moving forward. Not
[47:45] for the sake of moving forward, not for
[47:47] the sake of progress itself, but because
[47:49] that's what I believe that the Lord
[47:50] calls us to do. I'm going to set a I
[47:54] want to make sure that
[47:56] I should have set this I got a free two
[47:58] minutes there before setting a timer.
[48:01] You forgive me. All right. Uh
[48:05] I I believe that the Lord calls us to
[48:07] move forward.
[48:10] We hear about staying with the word. We
[48:12] we hear about always constantly staying
[48:14] with the word. Stay with the word. If
[48:16] the word that would seem like it would
[48:17] be easy to do except for the word is
[48:19] always moving. The word is always what
[48:22] you understood today may not be the same
[48:24] thing as tomorrow as the Lord unfolds
[48:27] that to you. As the Lord, you know,
[48:28] shows more of himself to you. I don't
[48:30] know if I look back, brother Dan, I was
[48:32] thinking about this. If I could know
[48:33] what I believed 10 years ago and maybe
[48:35] even what I spoke about 10 years ago, I
[48:37] probably wouldn't even agree with
[48:38] myself. Amen.
[48:41] I don't know about you. I don't know if
[48:42] maybe you could hear a conversation that
[48:43] you had with somebody and just outside
[48:45] of the church, maybe you had an opinion
[48:46] on something 10 years ago. Would you go
[48:48] back and would you agree with yourself
[48:50] now? But see, we because we grow and we
[48:52] learn and we gain more knowledge, we
[48:54] gain more experience and then thus our
[48:56] experience not only in the world in our
[48:58] daily lives, but I believe our
[49:00] experience with the Lord should also
[49:01] grow and it should also change and it
[49:03] should also move. Amen. And I think the
[49:05] Bible is calling us to make footsteps.
[49:06] And it says here in the scripture that
[49:08] the footsteps of a good man are ordered
[49:11] by the Lord. And and I love this
[49:13] scripture because it says uh this is an
[49:15] important part. Though you fall,
[49:19] I don't know if this is encouraging to
[49:21] you, but this is encouraging to me. The
[49:22] Bible's not saying if you're going to
[49:24] walk after the Lord, you're not going to
[49:26] fall.
[49:28] That's an impossible standard, and
[49:31] that's why it's not in the Bible. But
[49:33] what the Bible says is though you might
[49:36] stumble.
[49:38] That's what the translation of this.
[49:39] Though you might stumble, you will not
[49:42] fall to the ground. And why is that? Why
[49:44] is it that is it impossible for a son
[49:46] and daughter of God to really fall to
[49:48] the ground to be cast down? And it says
[49:50] it right at the end of the scriptures
[49:51] because the Lord has you with his hand.
[49:55] And he has you with his hand because he
[49:57] knows that you're going to fall. He
[50:00] knows you're going to stumble. He knows
[50:01] you're going to trip over your own ways,
[50:03] your own thoughts. You might trip over
[50:05] brother Dan's thoughts or mine or
[50:07] somebody else's words might cause you to
[50:09] stumble. But if you are the Lord's, he
[50:14] has you with his right hand.
[50:17] It's not going to be easy. You might you
[50:19] might hear something. You might see
[50:20] something that just I just don't
[50:22] understand that. I don't understand what
[50:24] the Bible means about that. I don't
[50:25] understand what the church said over
[50:26] here. But but watch the Lord come and
[50:29] say, "Okay, I know that you might
[50:30] stumble over this, but I have you in my
[50:33] hand." And that to me is a comfort. And
[50:36] and these steps that are ordered by the
[50:38] Lord, it's it's it's a couple ways to
[50:40] look at this in my opinion, you know,
[50:43] the footsteps are ordered by the Lord.
[50:45] So in one way to look at this, the Lord
[50:47] is is really commanding, he's ordering
[50:49] you that you need to take steps,
[50:53] that you need to move forward. But if
[50:54] you don't mind, I want to read you
[50:56] something that is uh that kind of gave
[50:58] me the basis for this thought. I hadn't
[51:00] planned on reading this, but I I'm going
[51:01] to this morning. This is something that
[51:03] I was just had these notes and my and my
[51:07] wife didn't know this and and she sent
[51:09] me this little this little snippet. I
[51:13] don't know who the author was, but she
[51:14] goes, "I just read this today. It was
[51:15] awesome." She didn't know what I was
[51:16] studying on and she sent it to me about
[51:18] a week and a half ago. Can I read this
[51:19] for you this morning? It says, uh, "God
[51:22] cannot order steps that you don't take."
[51:27] I don't know. Anybody ever been on the,
[51:29] uh, I'll just wait and see bench?
[51:31] Anybody ever sat on the B? Yeah, me too,
[51:33] brother Daniel. Anybody say, "I'm going
[51:34] to wait and see what the Lord is going
[51:36] to he's going to open a direction for
[51:38] me, and when I see that the Lord opens
[51:39] direction me, that's the direction I'm
[51:40] going to I'm going to take." But that's
[51:41] not how the Lord works. He does not
[51:44] order steps that you don't take.
[51:48] You're praying for direction while
[51:50] you're standing still.
[51:55] I again, I got to raise my hand. I pray
[51:56] for direction so many times. Lord, give
[51:58] me a direction. And when I see you give
[51:59] me a direction, I I promise you, Lord,
[52:02] I'll move in that direction. And the
[52:04] Lord is saying, I want you to move so
[52:07] that I can direct your steps.
[52:11] You're asking for clarity while avoiding
[52:14] obedience.
[52:17] You want God to light a path, but you
[52:19] won't leave the driveway.
[52:22] He said this this quote says that's it's
[52:25] again I don't know who the author is,
[52:26] but it says uh it would seem real
[52:27] inspired to me. He says that's not
[52:29] faith.
[52:32] Do we hear that? That's not faith.
[52:35] That's fear dressed in spiritual
[52:37] language.
[52:40] I'm afraid to move. I'm afraid to move
[52:42] forward. But I don't want to say that
[52:44] I'm afraid. I don't want to admit I'm
[52:45] afraid. So, I'll just say, "Lord, I'm
[52:47] waiting for a direction from you."
[52:48] Because that sounds It sounds pretty
[52:50] good, right? Sounds pretty good. But
[52:53] that is fear. I'm operating actually,
[52:56] I'm not really doing anything, Brother
[52:57] Daniel, but I'm I'm I'm operating in my
[52:59] mind off of fear and not off of faith.
[53:04] God is not in the business of steering
[53:07] parked cars.
[53:09] He's a God of movement and a God who
[53:12] meets you on the way, not just in the
[53:16] waiting.
[53:18] He orders steps, not stagnation.
[53:24] Because obedience, uh, excuse me,
[53:26] because obedience unlocks the next
[53:29] instruction.
[53:31] I'm waiting on an instruction from the
[53:32] Lord, but he already gave you one, and
[53:34] that was to obey him. That's right. And
[53:37] if I can't follow that one, and I'm
[53:39] waiting on number two, step number two,
[53:41] I haven't taken step number one yet. God
[53:43] didn't promise to order your
[53:45] imagination.
[53:47] He promised to order your steps. That
[53:49] means, it's real simple this morning. It
[53:51] means you've got to move. Even if it's
[53:54] trembling,
[53:57] even if it's shaky. I'll tell you this.
[54:00] Even if you stumble,
[54:02] he still has you with his hand. Amen.
[54:04] But how are you going to stumble,
[54:06] brother Daniel? How are you going to
[54:07] stumble so that the Lord can show you
[54:09] that he's got you in his hand if you're
[54:11] standing still?
[54:13] I I have never seen somebody trip and
[54:15] fall while standing still.
[54:20] I I I haven't seen it yet. If you're
[54:23] going to stumble, it means you got to be
[54:25] taking a step. And you know the Lord, it
[54:28] talks about in Revelations about this
[54:30] about this day and age. Now, I I know
[54:32] it's kind of hard to hear about your day
[54:34] and age when it's a when it's a negative
[54:36] thing, but the book of Revelations calls
[54:37] the Leoysian age, which we are in a
[54:40] lukewarm age.
[54:42] It's an age of comfort. It's an age of
[54:45] uh complacency. It's of an age of just
[54:48] staying where I'm at sometimes under the
[54:51] guise of I'm waiting on the Lord to show
[54:52] me where to go.
[54:54] And you know, Revelations, he would say,
[54:56] he says this in Revelations, you know, I
[54:58] would actually rather that you were cold
[55:01] or hot. And to me, when I hear this, I
[55:04] hear the Lord telling me, not not just
[55:05] telling you, Tucson Tabernacle, he's
[55:07] telling me, I would rather have you take
[55:09] a step in the wrong direction
[55:12] than to do nothing.
[55:14] I would rather have you step out and it
[55:16] just be in the opposite. I know we I
[55:18] think most of us want the will of the
[55:20] Lord. I think those of us that that seek
[55:22] the will of the Lord, that's what we
[55:23] want. We don't want to just walk off
[55:25] randomly and we just walk around. I I
[55:27] believe that our heart is sincere when
[55:29] we're asking for direction. I believe
[55:31] it's sincere. But I think sometimes that
[55:34] we we we have complacency and we have no
[55:37] movement because we're waiting on the on
[55:39] the movement of the Lord because we're
[55:40] afraid again going back to fear to take
[55:42] a step in the wrong direction. when the
[55:44] Lord is saying, "I'd rather you step in
[55:46] the wrong direction so that I can order
[55:48] your steps into my will."
[55:52] And I think that's the condition of this
[55:54] age. I don't want to be a part of this
[55:56] age. And I don't want to be in the
[55:57] condition of this age. I don't want to
[55:59] use the condition of Leoya as an excuse
[56:02] for my walk with the Lord. In fact, it's
[56:04] not a walk with the Lord unless
[56:07] you're taking steps and walking. I got
[56:10] to walk with the Lord. I you don't have
[56:12] a walk with the Lord unless you're
[56:13] walking.
[56:16] Even if it's in trembling, even if it's
[56:18] small, you don't have to take big steps.
[56:21] You just got to take a step. Even if
[56:24] it's unsure, he's not obligated to
[56:26] choreograph a life you refuse to
[56:29] participate in. And if you never lift
[56:31] your foot, listen now, this is just not
[56:35] we're talking about in the spiritual
[56:36] now. We're talking about decisions that
[56:38] we make in our lives. Amen. Decisions we
[56:41] make in our lives are steps. If you
[56:43] never lift your foot, there's nothing
[56:44] for him to guide.
[56:47] We say we trust him, but trust looks
[56:50] like motion.
[56:54] Anybody ever done a trust fall? I don't
[56:56] know if I want to experiment with that
[56:58] right now, brother Dan. Right? But you
[57:00] know what I'm talking about, right? You
[57:02] trust fall, you put your arms out. It's
[57:03] not a trust fall until you do what?
[57:06] until you you got to you got to you got
[57:08] to surrender all the way, right? It you
[57:10] might look back and you kind of stumble
[57:12] and put your hands out. That's not a
[57:13] trust fall. A trust fall doesn't happen
[57:16] until you fall. But you got to you got
[57:19] to commit to it. You got to commit to
[57:22] and now I don't know what it is for you
[57:24] because I think for every person it's
[57:25] different in their lives, whether it be
[57:26] in their natural lives, in their
[57:28] workplace. I'm not sure where the Lord
[57:29] has has got you at. I think we're in
[57:31] multiple places that we need to make
[57:32] decisions. might be in your personal
[57:34] life. It might be in your workplace. It
[57:36] might be in your church life. It might
[57:38] be you just you just met God and you're
[57:40] not sure what direction to take. Just
[57:42] take a step.
[57:44] And if you take a step with him on your
[57:46] mind, he's actually obligated. We're
[57:49] going to read here in a minute that he's
[57:50] actually obligated to guide you.
[57:53] Which I love. I love I just love when
[57:55] the Lord obligates himself
[57:58] because then it cannot fail. It can't
[58:01] fail. when he obligates himself, you
[58:03] know, if I obligate him, well, then it's
[58:06] kind of up to my faith and it's up to
[58:08] how good I'm But. But when he obligates
[58:10] himself, you know, it's going to happen
[58:12] with 100% short. I just want to finish
[58:15] this. It says, "Trust looks like
[58:17] starting the business or applying for a
[58:19] job or walking away from what's breaking
[58:21] you or saying yes to what scares you."
[58:24] Trust looks like taking steps even when
[58:27] the staircase isn't finished.
[58:31] the or the the Lord orders the steps of
[58:34] a good man. Now, let's just talk about
[58:35] that scripture for a minute. What is a
[58:38] good man?
[58:42] And
[58:43] if you think that you are a good man or
[58:46] a good woman, let's just start right
[58:49] there. I know this is so basic and this
[58:51] is just going to be real, this is gonna
[58:53] be real simple. That's just where I like
[58:54] to stay.
[58:56] Um, many men and women consider
[58:58] themselves to be good or good enough for
[59:01] the Lord to order their steps.
[59:04] And maybe because they don't do things
[59:06] that they consider wrong or things they
[59:08] consider sin. And there are a lot of
[59:09] people who don't consider themselves
[59:10] good. But I think the danger uh one of
[59:13] the dangers, you think there's not a
[59:15] danger of going to church, but there is
[59:16] a danger of going to church. One of the
[59:18] dangers of going to church and following
[59:20] the Lord is that you can become
[59:21] religious.
[59:24] And actually being religious is worse
[59:27] than being worldly.
[59:31] I don't know if you I don't know if you
[59:32] if that how that lands, but being
[59:34] religious is being is worse than being
[59:37] worldly.
[59:41] We'll talk about a couple of those
[59:42] issues in a minute here. Maybe maybe you
[59:44] agree, maybe you don't agree, but maybe
[59:46] by the end of this you might might see
[59:47] what I'm talking about. Maybe because we
[59:49] go to church or read our Bible or pray
[59:51] to God, I'm good and now the Lord can
[59:53] order my steps. But you know, as I read
[59:56] the Bible and I just read real simple
[59:58] the Bible, there's only one person
[1:00:01] who is ever qualified to be called good.
[1:00:04] We know who that was.
[1:00:06] All right. He's the only one who's ever
[1:00:09] lived in a body of flesh and never made
[1:00:12] a mistake and never did anything wrong
[1:00:14] and never sinned and never had a an evil
[1:00:17] thought. He's the only one. And when he
[1:00:20] in the Bible was called good
[1:00:24] because he was good.
[1:00:27] And when they said good master, he said,
[1:00:29] "Why do you call me good?" So the one
[1:00:32] person, think about this now, I think
[1:00:33] that we could learn from this. The one
[1:00:35] person who could be called good when he
[1:00:38] was called good said, "There's nobody
[1:00:40] good but the father." He refused to take
[1:00:44] on the title of good.
[1:00:47] proving to me that without the heavenly
[1:00:51] father living inside, there's not one
[1:00:53] person that's good. So if I want to have
[1:00:56] my steps ordered by the Lord, I cannot
[1:01:00] earn that. I cannot be good enough for
[1:01:02] that. I cannot come to church enough for
[1:01:04] that. I cannot uh write all the right
[1:01:07] things in my Bible or read enough
[1:01:09] scriptures for that. I can't even I
[1:01:10] can't even pray enough for me to be
[1:01:12] good. The only way that I can be good so
[1:01:16] that the Lord can order my steps is to
[1:01:18] let the one that is good inside. That's
[1:01:20] so simple. It's just a simple basic
[1:01:23] message. But that is what I believe the
[1:01:26] Lord wants us to know. And he wants us
[1:01:28] not only to know, but he wants us to put
[1:01:30] into action. Not just say, "Oh Lord, I
[1:01:33] believe that now. Would you just come
[1:01:34] inside and and then when you come
[1:01:35] inside, I'll take a step."
[1:01:39] But that's not what the Lord says. No,
[1:01:40] no. Take a step towards me and I'll
[1:01:43] guide you. Take a step towards the cross
[1:01:46] and watch the cross take a step towards
[1:01:48] you.
[1:01:50] Lord, he says, "Come unto me. Pick up
[1:01:53] your cross and follow me."
[1:01:56] And that's not easy. I I we were just
[1:01:58] talking about this yesterday. It's not
[1:01:59] easy to pick up your cross.
[1:02:02] Jesus himself couldn't carry his cross
[1:02:06] and he dropped it and it fell. and
[1:02:09] someone asked it's not an easy thing to
[1:02:10] pick up your cross but he says pick up
[1:02:12] your cross take a step towards me I'll
[1:02:14] take a step towards you the only way you
[1:02:17] can be good enough and you know if you
[1:02:19] don't feel if you don't feel like your
[1:02:21] steps are ordered by the Lord anybody
[1:02:22] ever feel that way that you don't your
[1:02:24] life doesn't feel like the Lord has
[1:02:26] control of it fully I think it's time to
[1:02:28] start checking the good man
[1:02:31] and see if that good man is really in
[1:02:34] the pilot's seat
[1:02:37] or do I just let him in when things are
[1:02:39] going real real bad and then things are
[1:02:42] going real real good. I take over again.
[1:02:46] I didn't plan to say any of that, so
[1:02:47] we're just going to keep moving forward.
[1:02:48] All right, I been about 15 minutes. I
[1:02:50] want to give you some some some examples
[1:02:52] in the Bible. Would that be okay? I know
[1:02:54] this is real dry. This isn't a this
[1:02:56] isn't a big hurrah message, but um for
[1:02:58] for me, it's like this is I just want to
[1:03:00] I just want to take a step in the Lord.
[1:03:01] I just want to move forward with the
[1:03:03] word. That's what I want to move
[1:03:05] forward.
[1:03:06] these uh praise the Lord. These steps
[1:03:08] are ordered by the Lord and he directs
[1:03:10] you. Let's just let's just uh change
[1:03:12] gears. He directs you in the way that he
[1:03:14] wants you to go. And I want to tell you,
[1:03:15] and I think you know this, a lot of you
[1:03:17] are older than me and have been walking
[1:03:19] this way with the Lord a lot longer. Um
[1:03:21] and you could probably back me up on
[1:03:22] this. Brother Arie has does he always
[1:03:24] direct you in the way that you want to
[1:03:26] go? No. In fact, I would say it's hardly
[1:03:29] ever in the way that I want to go. It
[1:03:32] almost always looks the opposite of the
[1:03:34] way that I think I should go. Even when
[1:03:36] my goal is to improve my life with
[1:03:38] Christ and improve my Christian walk
[1:03:40] with him, I'll say, "This is the
[1:03:42] direction I think I need to move, and
[1:03:43] I'm going to take a step." And then the
[1:03:44] Lord just takes me and like just turns
[1:03:46] me this way. But that's what he promised
[1:03:49] to do. And actually, that is a good
[1:03:50] thing when he does that because that
[1:03:52] means it's like, "Hey, you're doing
[1:03:53] okay." You know, maybe he looks down at
[1:03:55] the footsteps of your life and your
[1:03:57] footsteps just look like this.
[1:04:01] But if they lead to him,
[1:04:04] then he's ordered them. And at the end
[1:04:06] of the road, where do those steps lead
[1:04:08] to? Though they might have went over
[1:04:10] here, and they might have went over here
[1:04:11] because I had control. But where did
[1:04:14] they end up? That's the place that
[1:04:16] matters. The children of Israel, they
[1:04:18] were led by the Lord. So what they would
[1:04:20] do, and I think you know this, but let's
[1:04:21] just go over it real quick. They would
[1:04:22] set up a camp. So they've left Egypt,
[1:04:25] and they would set up a camp. They'd
[1:04:26] have a tent. They'd build a tabernacle.
[1:04:28] Just I'm sure it it wasn't easy. They
[1:04:30] set it up just exactly and then they
[1:04:32] would camp around it. And as they camped
[1:04:34] around it, every morning they would walk
[1:04:37] outside and what the Bible says happened
[1:04:39] is that the that the cloud, the pillar
[1:04:40] would be resting on top of the
[1:04:42] tabernacle and saying, "This is where I
[1:04:45] want you to stay." And I think it says
[1:04:46] sometimes it would be days, weeks,
[1:04:48] months, and even years. They would stay
[1:04:51] in one place and they'd walk outside
[1:04:53] every morning. They would look up and
[1:04:54] they would see the cloud over the
[1:04:56] tabernacle. Okay, we're going to be here
[1:04:57] another day. I'm going to go about my
[1:04:59] business. I'm going to go take care of
[1:05:00] my flocks. I'm going to go gather some
[1:05:01] mana. I'm going to go look after my
[1:05:03] family. We're here for another day. But
[1:05:05] one day they would walk out of the tent
[1:05:07] and the pillar of fire was moving. And
[1:05:10] it doesn't matter now you could say,
[1:05:12] okay, now this is the children of
[1:05:14] Israel, but this is picture us in our
[1:05:15] own lives now. It doesn't matter how
[1:05:17] comfortable they were. They might have
[1:05:19] been in the greenest spot with the best
[1:05:21] grass and their flocks are just they're
[1:05:24] prospering and they're like, "Man, I
[1:05:25] really like it here. I really like it.
[1:05:27] It's beautiful right here." When that
[1:05:28] cloud started moving, it was time to
[1:05:30] pack up and it was time to go.
[1:05:33] I think sometimes I get a little bit
[1:05:34] comfortable in church. I get a little
[1:05:36] too comfortable with my worship. I get a
[1:05:38] little bit too comfortable in my daily
[1:05:40] life. Oh Lord, I pray to you, but it's,
[1:05:41] you know, it's exactly 15 minutes or
[1:05:43] exactly 30 minutes or exactly 5 minutes.
[1:05:46] I read x amount of scriptures every
[1:05:47] sometimes I just get a little bit
[1:05:49] comfortable. And if I'm not careful, I
[1:05:51] fall into a lukewarm condition. And a
[1:05:54] lukewarm condition is not always uh it's
[1:05:56] not always that you're not doing things
[1:05:58] for the Lord and that you're doing bad
[1:06:00] things. It means that you're just doing
[1:06:01] things that are comfortable to you.
[1:06:05] So we think about the lukewarm condition
[1:06:06] is like, oh well that's somebody's just
[1:06:08] kind of wishy-washy and they're just
[1:06:09] kind of No, no, no. It might be somebody
[1:06:10] that's super dedicated.
[1:06:13] They might read their Bible every day.
[1:06:14] They might pray every day. They might
[1:06:15] make every church service without fail.
[1:06:17] But if it's done out of comfort, if it's
[1:06:19] done out of repetition, if it's done out
[1:06:21] of ritual, then it's a lukewarm
[1:06:23] condition.
[1:06:25] And I'm not saying to not do those
[1:06:26] things. I'm saying, Lord, have I I'm
[1:06:29] saying maybe we could ask the Lord,
[1:06:31] Lord, have I actually taken a step with
[1:06:33] you recently?
[1:06:35] Or am I have I taken steps and then I
[1:06:37] came to a camp? I came to a point where
[1:06:39] you did something for me. I know you did
[1:06:42] something for me. I see the Holy Spirit.
[1:06:43] I see what you've done, but now I've
[1:06:45] kind of set up camp there.
[1:06:50] There's another example of this we'll
[1:06:51] read in a minute. Every day they'd walk
[1:06:52] out and they look and and and it doesn't
[1:06:54] matter. It just it doesn't matter how
[1:06:56] comfortable they were. They packed up
[1:06:58] and they followed the Holy Spirit.
[1:07:01] Footsteps ordered by the Lord. They
[1:07:03] didn't even know where they were going.
[1:07:04] They didn't know the next place they
[1:07:06] were going to stop and camp, but they
[1:07:07] went because the Lord said to watch the
[1:07:09] Lord just ordering more steps. I I
[1:07:11] wanted to talk about Abraham a little
[1:07:12] bit. Abraham called out by the Lord. He
[1:07:14] was called out of his father's house by
[1:07:17] the Lord. You know, if you actually look
[1:07:19] into Abraham's life, Abraham was
[1:07:21] wealthy.
[1:07:23] You know, he was not called out of a bad
[1:07:25] life.
[1:07:27] He was called out of a comfortable life.
[1:07:29] He was rich. He was just living in his
[1:07:31] father's tents until he was 75 years
[1:07:33] old. Talk about somebody living at home
[1:07:34] a little bit too long, right?
[1:07:38] He was in 2025. Brother Dan, we can say
[1:07:41] he was No, you I wasn't talking about
[1:07:42] you.
[1:07:44] You still got another You still got
[1:07:45] another 50 something years. You're good.
[1:07:47] If in 50 years you're still at home,
[1:07:49] Brother Dan and I will we'll be we'll be
[1:07:51] getting together, but that's okay. He in
[1:07:55] 2025, he was like in he was in his dad's
[1:07:58] basement.
[1:08:00] Now, I don't mean to talk about Abraham
[1:08:01] that way, but that's what the Bible
[1:08:02] says. He was in his father's house. He
[1:08:04] was rich. He was comfortable. didn't
[1:08:06] have need of anything.
[1:08:08] And the Lord said, "Okay, you're going
[1:08:10] to have to leave all that behind. Leave
[1:08:12] all the family behind." Is that a hard
[1:08:14] one to do? There's someone in here that
[1:08:16] know exactly what I'm talking about.
[1:08:18] Leave all the family behind. Leave the
[1:08:20] comfort of home behind. And I'm going to
[1:08:22] call you unto a place. And the Bible
[1:08:23] says, "I'm going to call you into a
[1:08:24] place you've never been to before."
[1:08:27] Now, what did Abraham have to do? Now,
[1:08:30] he didn't do things the right way. This
[1:08:31] is why I love the story of Abraham. Some
[1:08:33] Sometimes Abraham is preached on. and
[1:08:35] he's talked about and he's put on this
[1:08:37] pedestal which which he's the father of
[1:08:39] the faith, don't get me wrong, but he's
[1:08:41] put on this pedestal of something that I
[1:08:42] feel like I can't obtain. And I really
[1:08:44] think if you read through the Bible and
[1:08:46] you read through the story of Abraham,
[1:08:47] it's very attainable.
[1:08:50] It's very attainable. Like like Abraham
[1:08:52] makes a lot of mistakes, but I love I
[1:08:55] love that at the end of the Bible, it
[1:08:56] doesn't talk about Abraham's mistakes.
[1:08:58] It just says he he didn't even You know
[1:08:59] what I love is that he he he actually
[1:09:02] stumbled so many times.
[1:09:06] Let's I'll just read through him a few
[1:09:07] times. He stumbled so many times. But at
[1:09:11] the end of the Bible, it says he never
[1:09:12] stumbled.
[1:09:14] That's what it says. It said he
[1:09:15] staggered not at the promises of God.
[1:09:18] But I we'll read right here in the Bible
[1:09:20] where he staggered. But yet what God saw
[1:09:22] of him and what God inspired a writer to
[1:09:25] write down, he said he never even
[1:09:26] staggered one time. Because when God now
[1:09:30] when you see your steps, I I tell you
[1:09:32] when I look back, even if listen, if you
[1:09:33] could look back, maybe somebody just
[1:09:35] took a first step into this church, you
[1:09:36] might look back and see that step and
[1:09:38] it's just all over the place. Maybe
[1:09:39] you've been here 10 years and you can
[1:09:41] look back and see those steps and
[1:09:42] they're just going like this. But when
[1:09:43] God see those steps, they're exactly the
[1:09:45] way he wants them
[1:09:47] because they're ordered. Because he
[1:09:49] knows the end. And he might look at you
[1:09:50] and you might think you are all over the
[1:09:52] place, brother Aaron. All the things
[1:09:54] that you've done wrong and all the
[1:09:55] mistakes you made, but when God looks at
[1:09:57] your steps, he goes, "Oh, my son Aaron."
[1:09:58] Yeah. He's never staggered one time.
[1:10:01] Never even staggered one time. Thank God
[1:10:03] for that. Because if I was in charge of
[1:10:06] writing my own part in the Bible over
[1:10:08] there in Hebrews, it would be like he
[1:10:09] was all over the place.
[1:10:12] He failed here. He did this wrong. He
[1:10:14] thought this. He was reviled and he
[1:10:16] reviled again.
[1:10:19] Yep. He suffered and he made somebody
[1:10:21] suffer for his suffering.
[1:10:24] But thank God he writes the final
[1:10:26] chapter of my life and your life.
[1:10:29] Abraham, he starts to take steps. He's
[1:10:31] called out by the Lord. So he's he, you
[1:10:33] know, maybe you could say it was like
[1:10:35] his first day in church. He was called
[1:10:37] out by the Lord. Oh man, this feels
[1:10:38] good. I love it. This is new. I I love
[1:10:40] this. And then one chapter later, you
[1:10:43] see him in Egypt.
[1:10:45] Oh, wait a minute. I thought the Lord
[1:10:47] called him out. He called him into a
[1:10:49] promised land. In the very next chapter,
[1:10:51] we see him down in Egypt. I I asked you,
[1:10:53] what was he doing in Egypt?
[1:10:56] It wasn't doing anything good. In fact,
[1:10:57] when he went down to Egypt, he lied.
[1:11:00] First thing he did when he got there,
[1:11:02] hey, wait a minute. Okay, you're my
[1:11:04] wife, but I need you to lie and say that
[1:11:06] you're my sister, and I'm going to lie
[1:11:07] and say you're my sister. And you know,
[1:11:08] really, if you look at that, uh, if you
[1:11:10] look at Abraham on Earie's life, he
[1:11:11] wasn't actually trying to protect Sarah,
[1:11:14] right? He's trying to protect himself.
[1:11:16] That's what it says. He goes, "They are
[1:11:18] going to look upon you and if I'm
[1:11:20] married to you, they're going to kill
[1:11:21] me.
[1:11:24] He was he had himself to me when I read
[1:11:26] the Bible, I see, okay, that's a lot of
[1:11:28] stumbling. That's a lot of mistakes."
[1:11:31] And that's why it's encouraging to me.
[1:11:34] And that's why the faith of Abraham is
[1:11:36] attainable to me.
[1:11:39] But you know what he was always doing?
[1:11:41] He was always moving sometimes the wrong
[1:11:44] direction right down into Egypt where he
[1:11:45] didn't belong. But he was moving, you
[1:11:47] know, right before he went into Egypt. I
[1:11:49] know this is a little bit slow, but I I
[1:11:50] I think maybe we just stay right here in
[1:11:52] this part if you're okay. So I think
[1:11:54] right before he went down to Egypt, he
[1:11:56] came out of his father's house and he
[1:11:57] built an altar and he worshiped the
[1:11:59] Lord. But then you see him down in Egypt
[1:12:01] and he and he's down there for a time
[1:12:03] and he and he tells some lies and he
[1:12:05] does some things wrong. And then the
[1:12:06] Lord directs his steps and and he says,
[1:12:09] "I need to keep moving." You know what
[1:12:10] he does? He comes back to where he built
[1:12:13] the altar. And I want to ask you, have
[1:12:15] you ever been to a place where he built
[1:12:17] an altar to the Lord?
[1:12:19] And if you if if you're confused what I
[1:12:21] mean by that, I mean, has the Lord ever
[1:12:23] really truly done something for you that
[1:12:25] you remember? Amen. And if he's really I
[1:12:29] I would encourage you. I I don't know
[1:12:30] how you would build an altar. Maybe if I
[1:12:32] asked myself, how do you build an altar
[1:12:33] into the Lord in in today's day? We're
[1:12:35] not going to maybe form a pile of rocks,
[1:12:37] although maybe that would help you. But
[1:12:39] how do I build an altar to the Lord? If
[1:12:41] I'm in a church service or I I'm going
[1:12:42] to I'm in a prayer service or I'm at
[1:12:44] home and praying and the Lord does
[1:12:45] something for me, maybe through somebody
[1:12:47] else. How do I remember that? You know,
[1:12:49] you have some blank pages in your Bible
[1:12:51] and if I just had a suggestion for you,
[1:12:52] I would fill up those blank pages with
[1:12:54] some altars. You say, "You know what? On
[1:12:57] such such today, I have some in my Bible
[1:12:59] where the Lord did some things for me."
[1:13:00] I write them down. I say, "Lord, you did
[1:13:03] this for me today, and I don't want to
[1:13:04] forget about this." And you might say,
[1:13:06] "I'll never forget about this." But you
[1:13:07] know what? There's a lot of there's a
[1:13:09] lot of trials coming your way. And
[1:13:11] sometimes it's hard to remember exactly
[1:13:14] what it was that the Lord did for you.
[1:13:16] And then you got the other side of it.
[1:13:17] You got the adversary coming to you and
[1:13:19] saying, "He didn't do that for you."
[1:13:22] You just imagine that was a really good
[1:13:24] thing. Now that you're here, you realize
[1:13:26] that's that's not that great. He's going
[1:13:28] to be right there in your ear just
[1:13:29] whispering to you. I know he is because
[1:13:30] he does it to me. That wasn't really the
[1:13:33] Lord. You just imagined that. That was
[1:13:36] just a good feeling. Uh, may you were in
[1:13:37] a good service. It was good, but it was
[1:13:39] just a feeling. But look at you now.
[1:13:40] Look at all the stuff you do wrong.
[1:13:41] You're down in Egypt.
[1:13:44] You said that the Lord brought you out.
[1:13:46] You said that the Lord did something for
[1:13:47] you, but now you're down in Egypt, and
[1:13:48] you're lying again. See, I told you you
[1:13:50] weren't his seed.
[1:13:52] That's what he's telling Abraham. But
[1:13:54] Abraham had an altar. He had an altar
[1:13:57] built. And he had an altar built that
[1:13:59] said, "This altar is to signify that the
[1:14:01] Lord called me out of my old life."
[1:14:03] Amen. And when I'm in trouble, I'm going
[1:14:07] to come back to this altar. It's still
[1:14:10] there. Now, he built a physical altar.
[1:14:11] I'm going to come back and I'm going to
[1:14:12] worship at this altar and I'm going to
[1:14:13] pray at this altar. This is the altar
[1:14:16] that you can't take me past.
[1:14:19] And I think maybe you just note it in
[1:14:20] your Bible. I just giving you
[1:14:22] suggestions. It's not it's not a thus
[1:14:23] sayaith the Lord type of thing. I note
[1:14:25] in your Bible, this is what the Lord has
[1:14:26] done for me on this day. He did this and
[1:14:29] nothing. Put down there. Write it down.
[1:14:32] Don't let yourself talk you out of this
[1:14:34] five years from now.
[1:14:36] Don't let the devil tell you something a
[1:14:38] year from now that this wasn't real.
[1:14:39] This is real. Come back to that altar.
[1:14:41] If you now, now listen. What's the
[1:14:43] danger of an altar
[1:14:46] is that you stay there.
[1:14:49] And if you notice, read through
[1:14:50] Abraham's life. Read through Jacob's
[1:14:52] life. He built altars, too. But he
[1:14:54] didn't stay where the altar was at. You
[1:14:56] know what he did? He moved forward.
[1:14:58] Because I think I think sometimes I've
[1:15:00] been a little guilty of the Lord doing
[1:15:02] something for me and I and I make an
[1:15:04] altar and then I just stay there and I
[1:15:05] worship at the altar and two years go by
[1:15:08] and the Lord's like, "Have you made any
[1:15:10] progress?" I'm like, "Lord, I'm right
[1:15:11] here at that thing that you did for me."
[1:15:12] And the Lord's like, "I did it for you,
[1:15:15] but not so you could stay there." Yes.
[1:15:16] Amen. Not so you could just sit right
[1:15:18] there at that altar. I did that thing
[1:15:19] for you. That is from me. That's a
[1:15:21] testimony. Tell a testimony. Tell people
[1:15:23] about what I did for you. But I need you
[1:15:25] to take some steps. I need you to move
[1:15:27] on. Now, if you get lost, if you find
[1:15:28] yourself in Egypt, you can come back to
[1:15:30] that altar cuz I did that thing for you.
[1:15:32] But that altar, the altar to God is not
[1:15:35] God.
[1:15:36] Can I say that again? The altar to the
[1:15:38] Lord that you build is not the Lord.
[1:15:40] It's just a reminder of the things that
[1:15:42] he's done for you, in case you get lost
[1:15:44] a little bit. In case you start taking
[1:15:46] steps and the steps are wrong, he can
[1:15:48] bring you right back to that altar. But
[1:15:50] that altar that Abraham built was not
[1:15:52] because if you read through Abraham, I I
[1:15:53] I I give you a I just some homework. Go
[1:15:57] read through the story of Abraham and
[1:15:58] watch the altars that he built,
[1:15:59] including the one he was going to
[1:16:01] sacrifice his own son on. But he didn't
[1:16:03] stay in those places.
[1:16:06] He comes back to it uh after after going
[1:16:08] off and kind of wandering over here into
[1:16:10] Egypt. And I want to tell you, you can
[1:16:12] come back to that altar. Just just make
[1:16:14] an altar to the Lord. You can come back.
[1:16:16] I don't care if the devil tells you you
[1:16:17] can't go back. You you you can't be that
[1:16:19] person. You've messed up too badly. No,
[1:16:21] you haven't.
[1:16:23] Can I tell you? You have not messed up
[1:16:25] too badly
[1:16:27] for the Lord. You might have stumbled,
[1:16:29] but you were not utterly cast down.
[1:16:33] If somebody, even if it's your own,
[1:16:35] Listen, I love this. We're going to get
[1:16:36] to something. Even if it's your own
[1:16:38] self, Daniel, that's telling you that
[1:16:39] you're no good, don't listen to that
[1:16:40] person either. It's not always the
[1:16:42] devil. It's not always the devil.
[1:16:44] Sometimes it's my own thoughts. My own
[1:16:46] heart says, "Oh, you're not good enough
[1:16:47] to be a Christian. You're not good
[1:16:48] enough to be a believer. You're not good
[1:16:50] enough to be even in the same sentence
[1:16:51] as Abraham. You are
[1:16:54] not because I said so, but because God
[1:16:57] said so. And then God obligated himself.
[1:16:59] Let's read about it.
[1:17:01] He says, "The Lord made a the Lord made
[1:17:03] a covenant with man." So if let's just
[1:17:08] go over what a covenant is. Would that
[1:17:09] be okay? I don't care if we don't even
[1:17:10] get any farther than this. Let's go over
[1:17:12] what a covenant is. Brother, uh, let's
[1:17:14] say I make a deal with brother Lyle. I
[1:17:16] make an agreement with brother Lyall.
[1:17:17] This is how it would work in the Bible
[1:17:18] days. And I think we all know this, but
[1:17:20] if you don't know this, it's okay. Let's
[1:17:22] learn it right now. This is how it
[1:17:23] worked in the Bible that when they made
[1:17:24] a covenant with each other, they would
[1:17:26] take some animals. Now, let's say,
[1:17:28] Brother Laauo, I tell you, I'm going to
[1:17:29] sell you my car, and you tell me you're
[1:17:32] going to buy my car. What what what they
[1:17:34] would do is they would take animals, the
[1:17:36] the poor animals, but they had to be
[1:17:37] part of this. And they would cut them.
[1:17:38] They cut them into pieces. They take a a
[1:17:40] heer, and they take a ram, and they take
[1:17:42] a goat, and they they cut them into
[1:17:43] pieces, and they make a pile over here,
[1:17:45] and they make a pile over here. And then
[1:17:47] brother Lyle and I would we would walk
[1:17:49] together between the piles of animals.
[1:17:52] And what that would signify is if I
[1:17:56] don't sell him my car or he doesn't pay
[1:17:58] me, let it be done to us what was done
[1:18:00] to those animals. That's what a covenant
[1:18:03] meant. It was serious. It wasn't just it
[1:18:05] was more than just a handshake deal. If
[1:18:07] you didn't keep your word, there was a
[1:18:09] consequence to you not keeping your
[1:18:11] word. May it be done to me what was done
[1:18:14] to those animals if I don't keep my
[1:18:16] word. to brother Lao or if he doesn't
[1:18:17] keep his word to me. That's a covenant.
[1:18:19] You know, God made those with man. You
[1:18:22] know, he made one with Adam in the
[1:18:23] beginning. He said, "Adam, you I'm this
[1:18:25] is what I'm going to do for you and
[1:18:26] here's what you need to do."
[1:18:29] And Adam failed
[1:18:32] and he didn't keep his side of it.
[1:18:34] And then he makes one with Israel. Now,
[1:18:36] now he didn't want, let me tell you
[1:18:38] this, he didn't want to make this
[1:18:39] covenant with Israel.
[1:18:41] Israel wanted this covenant.
[1:18:44] He called Israel out and he said, "Look,
[1:18:46] I will be your God. I will take care of
[1:18:49] you. I will clothe you. I will feed you.
[1:18:51] I will do everything for you. Just walk
[1:18:53] in my way." And now Israel, Israel made
[1:18:56] uh I think it's called the biggest
[1:18:58] mistake they've ever made. And that's
[1:18:59] what they wanted a covenant with God
[1:19:02] that says, "God, I want you to do
[1:19:03] something and I want to do something
[1:19:05] back."
[1:19:06] Now, that sounds good. If you're just if
[1:19:09] you're in church and you and maybe that
[1:19:11] just sounds good to you. Wait a minute.
[1:19:12] Well, so if you mean if I'm going to
[1:19:13] serve the Lord, I'm going to do
[1:19:15] something for the Lord and then the
[1:19:16] Lord's going to do something back for
[1:19:17] me. That sounds like a pretty good
[1:19:18] arrangement. Here's the problem is that
[1:19:21] the part that you have to keep, you will
[1:19:22] never keep.
[1:19:26] Unless you think that you're good.
[1:19:29] And if you think that you're good, you
[1:19:30] already have a problem. You've already
[1:19:33] not kept part of the covenant. You and I
[1:19:36] cannot keep a covenant with the Lord.
[1:19:39] Do you realize that we cannot keep a
[1:19:41] covenant with the Lord? We might be able
[1:19:42] to make a small little promise that we
[1:19:44] know we can fulfill, but I'm talking
[1:19:46] about a lifelong covenant with the Lord.
[1:19:48] We cannot keep that.
[1:19:50] And so when the Lord comes to Abraham, I
[1:19:52] love this. This is again, it should be
[1:19:54] encouraging. He comes to Abraham. Um I
[1:19:57] think it's in I I'll tell you the
[1:19:58] chapter in a minute. So he makes a
[1:19:59] covenant with him and he says, "Here's
[1:20:02] the animals. Split them apart. Put a
[1:20:04] pile over here. Put a pile over here."
[1:20:06] And Abraham does it. And then the Lord
[1:20:08] says, "Now you're going to go to sleep."
[1:20:12] And Abraham sleeps. And that evening, as
[1:20:15] he sleeps next to the pile of the
[1:20:17] animals that he cuts, the Bible says a
[1:20:20] flame, a torch walked between the
[1:20:23] animals.
[1:20:26] Abraham did not wake up and walk between
[1:20:28] the animals. The covenant that the Lord
[1:20:32] made with Abraham involved one person,
[1:20:35] the Lord. Amen. He did not make it
[1:20:39] dependent on Abraham, Abraham's faith,
[1:20:41] Abraham's goodness, Abraham's works,
[1:20:43] Abraham's anything. He said, "This
[1:20:45] covenant is going to be dependent on me,
[1:20:48] the Lord, because I can keep the
[1:20:52] covenant.
[1:20:54] It doesn't matter what you do. It
[1:20:56] doesn't matter how you live. I if I'm
[1:20:58] the only person involved in this
[1:20:59] covenant, I can keep this covenant." And
[1:21:02] the Bible says he swear by himself.
[1:21:08] What a person to swear by. The Lord
[1:21:11] swore by his own self that that covenant
[1:21:14] would not be broken. In fact, he said,
[1:21:16] "Let it be done to me like these animals
[1:21:18] if I don't keep my word."
[1:21:21] And the Lord is more than able to keep
[1:21:23] his word. And so, I I I don't know if
[1:21:26] you've ever heard this before, and I'm
[1:21:28] sure we have, but have you ever heard
[1:21:29] that the Lord's forgiveness and the
[1:21:31] Lord's love is unconditional?
[1:21:33] I want to tell you, it's unconditional.
[1:21:35] that that that you're never ever too low
[1:21:38] or too dirty or too vile or too filthy
[1:21:42] for the Lord to come and save and the
[1:21:44] Lord to come because he didn't swear by
[1:21:46] your goodness and your works. You'll
[1:21:49] have the devil to come in and tell you,
[1:21:50] "Oh, you're just not good enough for the
[1:21:52] Lord. You're too you've done too many
[1:21:53] wrong things for the Lord to really
[1:21:56] save." He only saves people who are
[1:21:58] right on the verge of goodness.
[1:22:01] But that would be the case if you had
[1:22:04] made a covenant with the Lord and you
[1:22:06] had a part to maintain. Then you would
[1:22:08] have to be worried about what you did.
[1:22:10] You'd have to be worried about what you
[1:22:11] look like. You'd have to be worried
[1:22:13] about your life. But when you accept now
[1:22:15] listen the the covenant to the Lord for
[1:22:18] the from the Lord to you is
[1:22:20] unconditional. It's it's in whatever
[1:22:22] condition you are right at this moment.
[1:22:24] He says I give you this covenant.
[1:22:27] Now where is the condition come in? on
[1:22:30] your acceptance of that
[1:22:32] forgiveness to you is unconditional.
[1:22:34] He'll forgive no matter how bad you are,
[1:22:37] no matter how vile you are, no matter
[1:22:38] how to him it would be filthy, he'll
[1:22:42] forgive you. In fact, he already has
[1:22:44] done that. That covenant has already
[1:22:47] been made with you, but you have to
[1:22:50] accept it. And and Abraham's faith was
[1:22:54] not so Abraham could live a good life.
[1:22:57] His whole faith of the faith of Abraham
[1:22:59] that we hear about was all in accepting
[1:23:02] the covenant of the Lord. He's called
[1:23:05] the father of the faith because his
[1:23:08] faith, no matter how many times he
[1:23:10] stumbled, and let me tell you, he
[1:23:11] stumbled.
[1:23:14] I tell you, he went down to Egypt, but
[1:23:16] then later on he says, uh, you know, he
[1:23:19] his his nephew Lot goes out and gets
[1:23:21] captured by by an army. He goes goes and
[1:23:24] and Abraham's going to go and get him
[1:23:25] back. read the Bible about what Abraham
[1:23:27] says. You know what he says? Uh he says
[1:23:29] to the king after he conquers him. He
[1:23:31] says, "Now give me back my goods."
[1:23:34] Oh, and also, yeah, give me lot too.
[1:23:38] His priority when he was younger was not
[1:23:41] good. He didn't He was like, "Give me my
[1:23:44] stuff back." Oh, also, yeah, I'll take
[1:23:46] lot too.
[1:23:48] He He You know why? Because he was
[1:23:50] growing in the Lord. Abraham was growing
[1:23:52] in the Lord. But if you see him later
[1:23:54] on, he's concerned about Lot. He's
[1:23:57] concerned. He goes and stands above the
[1:23:59] hill of Sodom and Gomorrah. And now
[1:24:02] things don't matter anymore to Abraham
[1:24:04] because he's taken steps and the Lord
[1:24:05] has grown him. He now people matter to
[1:24:07] him. Before people didn't matter to him.
[1:24:10] Oh, I guess I'll take a lot too, but
[1:24:11] give me my stuff back.
[1:24:14] But Abraham constantly taking steps in
[1:24:16] the Lord. And the Bible says that the
[1:24:19] covenant that he made with Abraham that
[1:24:21] day is not just in Galatians 3:29. He
[1:24:24] says it's not just for Abraham, but it's
[1:24:26] for his seed after him. If you be
[1:24:28] Christ's then are you Abraham's seed and
[1:24:32] heirs according to the promise. That
[1:24:33] means every single promise made to
[1:24:35] Abraham is also for his seed.
[1:24:40] And if you recognize that covenant, I
[1:24:42] think it actually changes your
[1:24:43] footsteps. Amen. Because before you're
[1:24:46] taking footsteps in your footsteps look
[1:24:48] like this.
[1:24:50] H how do I how do I get some grace from
[1:24:52] the Lord? How do I how do I get some
[1:24:55] mercy from the Lord? How do I how do I
[1:24:57] worship him the right way? And I I'm not
[1:24:59] I'm not I'm not mocking these ideas. I
[1:25:01] think they're good for us to be
[1:25:02] conscious of the Lord and what he wants.
[1:25:05] But if you don't know, take a step.
[1:25:10] You say, "I don't know how to pray to
[1:25:12] the Lord." You know that a bad a bad
[1:25:15] prayer is better than no prayer.
[1:25:21] Maybe you just got to take a piece of
[1:25:22] paper and write it down. Just write it
[1:25:24] down. You know, that's better than
[1:25:26] going, "I don't really know how to pray,
[1:25:27] so I don't pray."
[1:25:31] A bad step, what we would think is a bad
[1:25:33] step, is better than no step at all.
[1:25:35] Because now he can order it. Now he can
[1:25:37] say, "I'm going to show you exactly how
[1:25:40] to do that thing that you're doing." And
[1:25:42] I know he's going to do it because he
[1:25:44] made a covenant that he would do it.
[1:25:53] Now, people around the country thought
[1:25:55] that Abraham had lost his mind. Did you
[1:25:57] know that?
[1:25:58] He says he's going to have a baby. They
[1:26:00] thought he was crazy. But Abraham just
[1:26:03] kept moving forward. You gonna have it?
[1:26:06] How you feeling today, Sarah? I feel the
[1:26:08] same. Praise the Lord. Another step.
[1:26:13] Another step. 25 years of just making
[1:26:16] steps. Sometimes, brother Dan, sometimes
[1:26:18] I get tired after like a week,
[1:26:21] two months waiting on the Lord, three
[1:26:23] months waiting on the Lord, couple days
[1:26:25] waiting on the Lord for an answer.
[1:26:27] Abraham waited 25 years.
[1:26:30] But what did he believe in? The
[1:26:32] covenant.
[1:26:34] And watch him make mistakes. He tried to
[1:26:37] bring the promise to pass by his own
[1:26:38] means through the handmade.
[1:26:42] When I w when I read that, I'm like,
[1:26:44] "Okay, uh, he staggered."
[1:26:47] And I go back to the end of the Bible.
[1:26:49] Nope, he didn't stagger.
[1:26:51] It It's a paradox. But the Lord, see,
[1:26:54] the Lord, this is what I love is God is
[1:26:56] not, if he makes a covenant with you and
[1:26:59] you accept that covenant, he's not even
[1:27:01] going to let you mess it up.
[1:27:04] He's not even going to let me mess it
[1:27:06] up. When I would mess up,
[1:27:09] he says, "No, no, no. I made a covenant.
[1:27:12] It cannot fail."
[1:27:14] So, I'm not even going to let you mess
[1:27:16] it up. So, when you do wrong, I'm not
[1:27:19] even going to see that. No, I'm not
[1:27:21] advocating that we go and do wrong.
[1:27:23] That's that somebody, you could take
[1:27:25] this and go this extreme direction. I'll
[1:27:27] just live however I want to and the
[1:27:28] Lord's just going to wink at it.
[1:27:31] What you're saying is you're not really
[1:27:32] a son of God. You're not really a
[1:27:34] daughter of God. You're not really a
[1:27:35] seed of Abraham. Abraham did what the
[1:27:38] Lord wanted him to do and he made
[1:27:39] mistakes along the way. Amen. Let's just
[1:27:41] keep moving forward.
[1:27:43] You might say and you might say, you
[1:27:45] know, like I've already failed. Like you
[1:27:46] you're telling me this sermon, but I've
[1:27:48] already messed up.
[1:27:50] And and I'm just telling you just look
[1:27:52] at look at the life of Abraham. And and
[1:27:54] I'm telling you that what Abraham gained
[1:27:56] through his life is attainable for you.
[1:27:58] And and I think that that Satan attacks
[1:28:00] us on that point.
[1:28:02] And maybe we'll just I'll try to bring
[1:28:05] this to a close. The other way that
[1:28:07] Satan attacks you. There's two ways I
[1:28:09] think that he attacks you. And one of
[1:28:12] them is this. That you are good enough
[1:28:15] to be called a child of God. Now, this
[1:28:18] attack comes, I'm going to say, for the
[1:28:20] most part, on people who have been in
[1:28:22] church for a good amount of time, maybe
[1:28:25] even like me who just grew up going to
[1:28:27] church. That's who that I don't want to
[1:28:29] use the word veteran, but if I
[1:28:30] understand if I say veteran, do you know
[1:28:31] what I'm talking about? Like somebody
[1:28:33] who's been around church or been around
[1:28:35] a church life for a while, that's the
[1:28:36] attack they have to face. The attack
[1:28:38] they have to face is that you are good
[1:28:40] enough to be called a child of God.
[1:28:41] Well, I've been sitting in a pew and
[1:28:42] I've been doing this for so and so long.
[1:28:44] We don't say these things, but sometimes
[1:28:45] with our attitude, we look at somebody
[1:28:47] who hasn't been doing that as long as us
[1:28:48] and saying, "Well, they're not good
[1:28:49] enough. You need to be living the kind
[1:28:51] of life that I'm living." And you are
[1:28:54] not, you know, that that's a battle. And
[1:28:56] and I'm going tell you that if you're
[1:28:57] not in a battle, you have a big problem.
[1:29:00] So I'm telling you about two battles
[1:29:01] that you should be in. One or one or
[1:29:03] both. But if you have no battle, I think
[1:29:05] that there's a problem. And I think the
[1:29:07] problem is you might be standing still.
[1:29:10] But that's for another time. So you are
[1:29:12] good enough. You are righteous enough to
[1:29:14] be called the child of God through your
[1:29:16] works.
[1:29:19] um that your works and your deeds and
[1:29:20] your sacrifice and your preaching and
[1:29:22] your worship and your singing and your
[1:29:23] attendance and your and your prayer life
[1:29:26] and your Bible life all good things they
[1:29:28] are worthy for you to be called a child
[1:29:30] of God.
[1:29:34] You say that doesn't sound like a battle
[1:29:36] but the problem with that battle is is
[1:29:38] that you and if and I if I do this I
[1:29:41] have made myself part of the covenant
[1:29:43] with God and it's dependent on my
[1:29:45] actions. See, what I've done is I've
[1:29:47] actually by saying that I'm good enough,
[1:29:50] I have actually refused the covenant of
[1:29:52] God that he made with himself and I've
[1:29:54] say, "I'd like to enter a new covenant
[1:29:55] with you, God, like Israel did. And I'd
[1:29:57] like this covenant to be between me and
[1:29:58] you, and I want something to do with it.
[1:30:02] Look at the good things I do. Look at
[1:30:04] the Look at Lord, look at where you
[1:30:06] brought me from and look where I'm at
[1:30:07] today. I I'm not that person that But
[1:30:09] the Lord doesn't want that because you
[1:30:11] can't keep it.
[1:30:13] You and I can't keep it. And if you're
[1:30:15] if you're not if you're if you get
[1:30:17] confidence in yourself and not
[1:30:18] confidence in him, you'll start to want
[1:30:20] that covenant with him. And I think
[1:30:21] that's one battle. And and I just think
[1:30:23] about something so simple that the Bible
[1:30:25] says he'll clothe you with his
[1:30:27] righteousness. Amen. How can he clothe
[1:30:29] you with his righteousness when you're
[1:30:30] already clothed?
[1:30:32] With your own.
[1:30:35] You got to come to him with nothing.
[1:30:39] With nothing. And I don't mean I did
[1:30:42] that, brother, at the beginning of my
[1:30:43] walk. No. No, every day I have to come
[1:30:46] to him with nothing so that he can
[1:30:48] clothe me. And the other way I think
[1:30:51] Satan attacks you is the opposite side.
[1:30:52] That you're too low and you're too
[1:30:54] filthy and that anybody ever been told
[1:30:56] by the devil you've sinned away your day
[1:30:57] of grace.
[1:30:59] Okay, so that's a battle. You're in a
[1:31:01] battle. He's told me that. He's told me
[1:31:05] that a lot. You have sinned. You are not
[1:31:08] what you say that you are. You're not
[1:31:10] this. You're no good. You say you have
[1:31:12] Christ. You say that you've accepted
[1:31:14] salvation. You say you believe in the
[1:31:16] cross. You say these things, but then
[1:31:17] you go out and make mistakes and you go
[1:31:19] out and do this thing. And then you and
[1:31:21] and then somebody did something to you
[1:31:22] and you and even in your mind, you did
[1:31:24] something back to them.
[1:31:27] And then you know, somebody like me gets
[1:31:28] up here and reads a scripture. Well, if
[1:31:30] you're reviled against, you're reviled
[1:31:31] not. And sometimes Satan uses as an
[1:31:32] opportunity to come and go, see, you're
[1:31:34] not that thing he's talking about. Has
[1:31:37] he done that to you? You're not that
[1:31:39] type of Christian he's talking about.
[1:31:40] You're a failure. you're no good.
[1:31:44] But I can I can tell you that you
[1:31:48] I if it's dependent on you, you are a
[1:31:50] failure.
[1:31:52] Can we just say it just simply and
[1:31:54] plainly? If it's dependent on you and I,
[1:31:57] then you know what? It is a failure.
[1:31:58] It's as good as it's as good as done.
[1:32:01] But there was a covenant made
[1:32:06] that has nothing to do with me.
[1:32:09] All I have to do is accept this.
[1:32:13] And if you happen to be in the position,
[1:32:16] you say, "I don't have either one of
[1:32:17] those battles," then you have the first
[1:32:19] battle.
[1:32:21] I just want to tell you that if if you
[1:32:23] think you don't have, you know, none of
[1:32:25] those applied to me, the first one
[1:32:27] applied.
[1:32:29] And I just want to say because I've had
[1:32:30] the I've had the thought, Brother Aaron,
[1:32:31] where I was like, "Oh, man. I'm I'm I'm
[1:32:33] doing pretty good."
[1:32:36] It's It's rare. It's rare. and it's been
[1:32:39] for a moment and then I get humbled real
[1:32:41] real quick. But if you don't have if you
[1:32:43] don't think these battles apply, I think
[1:32:44] it might be the first battle. It's time
[1:32:46] to go check the good man again. I let's
[1:32:49] just let's just kind of come to a close
[1:32:51] here. I if you want to know if your
[1:32:52] footsteps are ordered by the Lord. Yes,
[1:32:54] you can look at your life and you can
[1:32:55] look at all the things you do and say,
[1:32:57] "Lord, have you ordered my footsteps?"
[1:32:58] Let's look at Abraham. Abraham lied
[1:33:00] about Sarah and called her called her
[1:33:02] his sister. And then he went through a a
[1:33:05] great period with the Lord where the
[1:33:06] Lord gave him a sign of circumcision.
[1:33:08] all these things in the Bible that we
[1:33:09] don't have time to go over. Then the
[1:33:10] Lord gave him a covenant that just just
[1:33:12] with the Lord, this is after Abraham had
[1:33:14] done wrong. And then uh the Lord himself
[1:33:18] in flesh came down. You know that God
[1:33:20] created a body and came down and had
[1:33:22] lunch with Abraham.
[1:33:24] I mean what a place to be. And we we
[1:33:26] look at that and we go, man, I don't
[1:33:28] think I could ever attain that. Like I'm
[1:33:29] so full of mistakes, right? So he he and
[1:33:32] then he has his name changed. He has his
[1:33:34] name changed to what the Lord wanted his
[1:33:36] name to be. And then he stands on a hill
[1:33:38] looking over Sodom. And he he he
[1:33:41] typifies not only does he typify the
[1:33:43] bride who's not going through the
[1:33:45] tribulation down there in Sodom, but he
[1:33:47] also typifies Jesus Christ who is saying
[1:33:49] an intercessor position saying, "If
[1:33:51] there only be a hundred, don't don't do
[1:33:53] anything to them." He actually takes on
[1:33:55] the intercessor part of Christ that
[1:33:57] says, "Look, if there just be if there
[1:33:59] be 20, don't destroy that city." Though
[1:34:01] the city was vile. If there'd be 10,
[1:34:05] don't destroy that city. And I'll tell
[1:34:07] you, Christ took it a step further. He
[1:34:09] said, "If there'll only be one in this
[1:34:11] church right now today, who will not
[1:34:13] bow, I'll come and I'll die."
[1:34:16] That's the spirit of Christ. Are you
[1:34:18] that one?
[1:34:20] There's one.
[1:34:22] There's two. Are you that one that
[1:34:24] Christ says, "If there just be one in
[1:34:27] Tucson Tabernacle, I'll go I'll be torn
[1:34:30] apart
[1:34:32] like those animals so that they can be
[1:34:34] saved." You know, you know, in that
[1:34:36] covenant God made that Jesus was
[1:34:37] actually the one torn apart so that you
[1:34:40] and I could be partakers of that
[1:34:41] covenant. That before we enter into
[1:34:44] that, before we can accept it, the blood
[1:34:47] from his son is how Jesus doesn't see
[1:34:49] what you're doing. But what does that
[1:34:51] take? That takes you putting it under
[1:34:52] the blood. That's why it's not a
[1:34:55] carefree life of sin. It's not a
[1:34:57] carefree life of this. It's it's a
[1:34:59] serious thing when you really have to
[1:35:01] come before the Lord and put it under
[1:35:02] the blood. So, he's standing up on the
[1:35:05] hill. And so, just imagine your life
[1:35:07] now. Imagine you if you had met God. You
[1:35:09] sat down and you had lunch with God.
[1:35:13] And then you stand with God and you're
[1:35:15] interceding. You're actually negotiating
[1:35:16] with God for the lives of other people.
[1:35:18] I mean, you you'd probably consider
[1:35:20] yourself kind of up here, right? And
[1:35:22] then one chapter later, he goes down
[1:35:24] into another place and lies again
[1:35:27] about his wife. Same lie that he did
[1:35:29] when he had started off. And I just want
[1:35:31] to ask you, have you ever done it again?
[1:35:36] Have you ever done it again?
[1:35:40] Have you ever
[1:35:42] had the Lord take you to a place where
[1:35:44] you believe that you're free from
[1:35:45] something and then you do it again?
[1:35:47] Amen. You ever you ever communed with
[1:35:51] God, whether it be in your prayer life,
[1:35:53] whether it be in a service,
[1:35:56] and you know that he heard you and you
[1:35:58] know that you saw him and you know that
[1:36:00] he did something for you. You know he
[1:36:01] changed you.
[1:36:03] Like Abraham had your name changed. You
[1:36:05] know that he's come in and done a work
[1:36:07] in your life and then you do it again.
[1:36:12] The thing that you battle, you do it
[1:36:14] again.
[1:36:16] And it's not discouraging to me when I
[1:36:17] read about Abraham doing it again. It's
[1:36:19] encouraging.
[1:36:23] Because sometimes, brother Dan, I've
[1:36:24] done it again.
[1:36:27] You say, you've done it again and I'll
[1:36:30] do it again.
[1:36:32] Why? Because I'm a failure. And when I
[1:36:35] try to enter a covenant with God as a
[1:36:37] failure, but I fall onto the mercy. I
[1:36:42] fall onto the grace.
[1:36:45] And and I trust I there is not a time I
[1:36:49] hope I hope we never in our Christian
[1:36:51] life get to a place where we think,
[1:36:53] "Okay, God, you can let go of me now. I
[1:36:56] can walk.
[1:37:00] I can't do it. I I can't do it." And
[1:37:03] there's not a man or woman that I have
[1:37:05] met that can do it.
[1:37:08] There are good people. There are there
[1:37:10] are people who are so solid in what they
[1:37:12] believe and their faith is incredible
[1:37:14] and there but I know that if the Lord
[1:37:17] lets go,
[1:37:19] they're going to fall
[1:37:21] because that covenant cannot be
[1:37:23] dependent on you. It cannot be dependent
[1:37:25] on me. It cannot be dependent on our
[1:37:28] good man.
[1:37:31] And
[1:37:35] I I don't think that it's I think that
[1:37:39] because of the way the world is and the
[1:37:41] way that sometimes even even church
[1:37:44] culture is
[1:37:47] I I'm just saying this. I don't have a
[1:37:49] plan to say this. I just want to say
[1:37:50] this the way the Lord wants it said. I
[1:37:52] think because of church culture that
[1:37:54] it's looked on as a weakness
[1:37:57] to be helped by the Lord.
[1:38:00] It's looked on as a well, you don't have
[1:38:03] faith or you don't have this or you're
[1:38:05] not the kind of Christian because the
[1:38:07] Lord has to continually have his hand on
[1:38:09] you.
[1:38:11] That is wrong.
[1:38:14] That's wrong.
[1:38:16] That is not what we should be teaching
[1:38:19] in the church. And I'm just saying
[1:38:20] churches. I'm just saying churches. I'm
[1:38:22] I'm not not saying that's taught here. I
[1:38:24] don't believe that's taught here. But
[1:38:25] I'm saying that there is a there's the
[1:38:26] wave of of of confidence put into people
[1:38:31] that doesn't belong there. If I the
[1:38:34] moment I have a confidence in myself, I
[1:38:36] I'm I have missed something. I'm in a
[1:38:38] battle that I don't want to be in.
[1:38:41] The confidence has to be in that
[1:38:44] covenant that he made. The confidence
[1:38:46] has to be in the blood of his son that
[1:38:48] he tore apart for me. That's where the
[1:38:50] confidence has to be. If it's in me, I
[1:38:53] guarantee you I will go wrong.
[1:38:57] I could not guarantee anything more than
[1:38:59] that. That if the confidence that I have
[1:39:01] is in my works, it's in my goodness,
[1:39:04] it's in my ability. And you know what
[1:39:06] that is? That's a religious spirit.
[1:39:08] And that's why it's worse to be
[1:39:10] religious than it is to be in the world.
[1:39:12] Because then at least if you're in the
[1:39:14] world and you're living a life that
[1:39:15] maybe you don't like or that you're not
[1:39:17] proud of, at least you can turn to the
[1:39:19] Lord and say, "Lord, I need you." But if
[1:39:22] you're living a religious life, you know
[1:39:23] how hard it is to turn to the Lord and
[1:39:25] say, "I need you." Because the religious
[1:39:27] life is, "I already have you and I'm
[1:39:29] good."
[1:39:32] That's what the religious spirit is. Is
[1:39:34] that I already have the thing that I
[1:39:36] need and I'm good to go. Instead of
[1:39:38] every single day saying, "Lord, it's not
[1:39:40] on me. It's not on me, Lord. I did it
[1:39:43] again. I'm coming back to the covenant
[1:39:46] again. And maybe you got to come back.
[1:39:47] Now, I don't believe in I don't believe
[1:39:49] in I don't think it's a good thing that
[1:39:51] if you have to keep coming to the altar
[1:39:53] of the Lord over and over and over again
[1:39:55] for the same time. I think maybe maybe
[1:39:57] you never left it. Maybe steps aren't
[1:40:00] being taken. But if you have to come
[1:40:01] back to that altar, come back to the
[1:40:03] altar and say, "Lord, I don't know what
[1:40:05] I'm doing. I've done wrong. I've gone
[1:40:06] out here and I've done something I
[1:40:07] shouldn't have done, but I built an
[1:40:09] altar right here. That one day, that one
[1:40:11] day, whatever it was, you did something
[1:40:13] for me. And I don't know where else to
[1:40:15] go, but I'm going to come back here.
[1:40:16] Will you help me?
[1:40:18] And that's something that a religious
[1:40:20] thing when it gets on you doesn't allow
[1:40:22] you to do.
[1:40:24] It says you are good the way that you
[1:40:26] are.
[1:40:28] You deserve to be called a child of God.
[1:40:31] Look at your works. Look at all the
[1:40:33] Lord's brought you through. Forgetting
[1:40:35] that it was the Lord that brought you
[1:40:36] through it and had nothing to do with
[1:40:39] you. All I did was accept it.
[1:40:42] That's all I did. Like the simple I just
[1:40:45] accepted it. Now that you know what?
[1:40:46] Accepting it takes faith. That's the
[1:40:49] faith that Abraham because you're going
[1:40:51] to look, if you're really being honest,
[1:40:53] you're going to look in the mirror and
[1:40:54] you're say there's no way the Lord made
[1:40:55] a covenant with that thing.
[1:40:58] I hope that's how we look in the mirror.
[1:41:02] in the in in the re in the re in the
[1:41:03] mirror of the word. I'm looking Yeah,
[1:41:06] I'm looking pretty good. Pretty good
[1:41:07] Christian. That's not where I want to
[1:41:09] be.
[1:41:11] I want to look in the mirror of the word
[1:41:12] and say, "Lord, without you, I'm lost."
[1:41:17] Without you, I don't care if I've been
[1:41:20] walking this way my whole life. Without
[1:41:21] you, I'm lost.
[1:41:24] And I can look back on Abraham's life
[1:41:27] and that's what I see. And
[1:41:30] I I I don't know if I could just tell
[1:41:32] you this, but we'll close if you want to
[1:41:34] come, brother Daniel and you musicians,
[1:41:36] but
[1:41:39] just stay with what the word says
[1:41:44] and know that the word
[1:41:47] is always moving. It's always unfolding.
[1:41:51] It's always opening itself up more so
[1:41:54] that we continue to move with it. Now,
[1:41:57] there's more that could be said on that,
[1:41:58] but we'll just I think I think for
[1:42:00] time's sake, maybe that's that's
[1:42:02] sufficient. But I I could just I just
[1:42:04] want to encourage you to not be afraid
[1:42:07] to take a step.
[1:42:10] Maybe that could boil down the whole
[1:42:12] message of this. Even if it's the wrong
[1:42:15] step and you find yourself in Egypt,
[1:42:17] take a step. fall back on the covenant
[1:42:19] that the Lord's made with you and and
[1:42:22] and made with himself really and just
[1:42:24] accept it and watch him order your
[1:42:26] steps. They might be like this. They
[1:42:27] might be all over the states, but where
[1:42:28] do they lead at the end? And just a I
[1:42:33] think just a real simple message, but I
[1:42:35] have forgotten to do this so many times
[1:42:37] and I've concentrated on these big
[1:42:38] things and I've I've made serving the
[1:42:40] Lord so overwhelming.
[1:42:43] You ever feel that? It's so
[1:42:45] overwhelming. It shouldn't be
[1:42:46] overwhelming. It's simple.
[1:42:48] Take him at his word. He said he's going
[1:42:50] to do it. He made a covenant.
[1:42:52] [Music]
[1:42:54] It's time for the trust fall.
[1:42:56] It's time to commit to that trust fall
[1:42:58] and say, "Lord, I can't do this. I I
[1:43:00] cannot do this. I need you to catch me.
[1:43:02] And Lord, if it cost me my life, so be
[1:43:05] it."
[1:43:06] That's the kind of steps he can order.
[1:43:09] That's when he can start to work is when
[1:43:11] I have that attitude. And I don't just
[1:43:13] say it because it sounds good, but I do
[1:43:15] it. I'm standing before you today
[1:43:17] because I'm going to take a step even
[1:43:19] towards something I don't think that I
[1:43:21] want to do and like to do, but I'm going
[1:43:23] to I'm just going to take a step for in
[1:43:24] the Lord. Let the Lord direct the rest.
[1:43:26] Let him take over. Amen. I think I think
[1:43:28] that's I think I'm done. Brother Daniel,
[1:43:30] thank you. God bless you.
[1:43:32] [Applause]
