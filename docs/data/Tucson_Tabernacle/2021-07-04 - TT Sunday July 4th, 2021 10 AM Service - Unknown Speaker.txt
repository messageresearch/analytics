[Music] amen god bless you while we're standing we'll pray and just ask god to minister us to us today lord as we we've come this sunday morning honor of the resurrection we sing that song jesus paid it all all to him i own sin had left such a crimson stain but your blood covered all and washed it white as snow lord it's our confidence we place it in in the work that you've done lord because nothing that we could do nothing that i could do would would be sufficient to pay any any debt lord but jesus paid it all lord so we come this morning honoring the resurrection this morning honoring you lifting your name on high lord and we thank you because you said where two or three are gathered you'd be in our midst lord and you'll keep your word lord we're trusting in that we surrender to that now in the name of the lord jesus christ amen while you're standing we'll read one scripture then you may be seated thank you musicians and the book of psalms verse chapter 19 and verse 9 and it's just to open this morning the fear of the lord is clean enduring forever the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether it's clean it's wholesome it it's worth i don't know how else to do you think of the word clean unmoored drinkable touchable something you would eat it's clean it's everything you have need of when you respect and reverence him he says enduring forever and the judgment his thoughts his commandments everything that he does he issues of the lord are true they never fail and are righteous all together so amen you may be seated grateful to the goodness of the lord today and all that he's done for us undeserving as we are but he still does so just a couple of announcements to to remind you of just the morning service today the evening service is cancelled quite a few of the folks are out of town that let us know they'd be gone this weekend and i know it's this summer and folks do travel and i believe there's a youth or some kind of a meeting or what would you call it a camp meeting or all that the youth have gone to and stuff so those that are traveling those that will be out in the camps then and may the lord bless each one of them and grant the desires of their heart so and then on sunday i believe it's july 25th the last sunday of july we will have the morning service and then a potluck lunch and then that afternoon a church business meeting we had intended to do it today and then as soon as we announced it then quite a few folks responded saying they would be gone this weekend and wanted to be part of that so um we just needed to get it out so we could get some response too and and again so that gives us a couple of sundays between now and that last sunday if you have thoughts if you have something you would like to express and you would write it down or just to give us an opportunity to begin to to see what's in the hearts of the you know some of you folks are faithful in letting us know and others we don't hear about it till the meeting so what preparation we can do and we're just trusting in the lord i know that we were up at the minister's meeting uh last week and myself brother lyle and brother peter and um folks at brothers that you know want to know what's going on what's happening and there's a church up there that's going through the same thing so that the ministering brother who was helping out just had questions but i think probably the most common response is you don't have a pastor yet and then but it also opens up the door again because i've heard from different folks different brothers who as one brother said i want to put my name in the hat another brother spoke to us so um lord knows who who we are to have or how it's going to be but in the meantime let's press forward as a family let's continue to to work continue to pray continue to love one another encourage one another and um and see what god has for us we had spoken to brother tim cross last month i believe it was about him possibly coming out the last minister's meeting he was here in in arizona so i got to see him there he was ministering for one of the other churches so there's a possibility that brother tim cross could be coming this month to minister one possibly one of the weekends so we'll just trust in what the lord would allow us to do and in the the prayer request for brother kurt brown's great-granddaughter brother had had a opportunity to speak to brother curt i believe he said thursday and the young young girl she's four years old they are working on putting the fingers all back together she did not lose them but they're at st joe's in in phoenix i believe one of the hospitals up there they're working to restore and um i would just pray that god would would lead those surgeons as doctors talking with my dad he just had an mri he's been going through some some difficulties and all and dad got injured i believe it was in 1974 from his back the doctor told him then you're walking i cannot guarantee that if i do surgery on you that you'll be walking when i'm done he said so i i would just leave that alone but today by the grace of god the doctors and god has given them the knowledge and wisdom to be able to do things today that we would have never thought being been able to to do and so if that's the way the lord wants to work then we just ask him to to guide their hands especially for that little one that little one doesn't know why and and how to deal with it and and maybe sometimes that's better because when when we get into a situation we try to work it out the little child there may not understand and then they can turn and put their trust and i'd say sometimes we should be like children with god lord i don't know how to deal with this so i'm not even going to try i'm just going to lay it in your hands and let you have have your own way so we'll just continue to believe and trust in the lord so brother lyle spoke on on wednesday night of the two influences than in paul's day in our day and it's a great and a strong influence there's no question about it because there's only two spirits in this world they can manifest themselves in different ways god manifests manifests himself in various ways you can't put him in a box and say this is only god only this but he's infinite and and and he manifests himself but satan does it in every manner that he can because all he has ever done is copy he's not he's not original at all but he manifests himself in many different ways and and um there's a way that seems seemeth right to a man it looks good in the beginning the the start of the journey the the plans the thoughts that you might have but if it's not through god then it's death because that's all satan has ever produced is death so as he was thinking that i knew what the lord had put in my heart from a scripture i had read and it just started to to kind of just stay there and think about it and listen to what what some of the brothers spoke at the minister's meeting and some of the conversations we had and god is not a god in confusion he's not the author of confusion and sometimes you might look at something and they look so opposite and and or something looks so good but it's not what it is it's it's a cover over it it's what they call a facade like the the front of a store a storefront and ty says you to come in and then you open the door and what's inside is you were expecting a whole lot more than what the front was so these two thoughts that we're kind of working together here is the thought of that that we are here on this earth and there's a work to do and we're here until he says we're done yes and he knows that time in that day now my heart says even so come quickly lord jesus but i find myself being a little bit um what's where i were to use thinking about myself because i don't want to deal with this anymore you know i i just okay lord come take me home i don't want to deal with this anymore just just take your bride home let's but there are those others that there should out people out there that should touch our hearts and so god like you had mercy on me have mercy on them god has not shown me not given me the vision or the ability to see who is and who isn't therefore my attitude is that could be one also brother greene used to tell us who's my neighbor anyone that crosses the path of my life and so there was that thought of even so come quickly lord jesus because he said he would but there's also work to do and then the other part of is is and i'm going to have the brothers play the quote it's it's a few minutes long it's from questions and answers right after the sixth seal and the question was asked so as we as as evangelists or so should we stop now now that the seals have been unveiled should we stop evangelizing it's over and and so part of me is saying let's go home and the other part of me is saying no they're still souls out there i still have loved ones i still have friends i still have you know i want to see i want him to to come to that same place that i by the grace of god have gotten to to know him so showing brother brother lau was speaking what he was saying and saying lord we want out of here and we want even so come quickly lord jesus but i also want my brother my sister my neighbor to have the same opportunity so the first quote there let your light so shine before men and i know that it's hard to read up there and that's one of the reasons i want them to play the second quote because it would be hard to read but this was the quote of the day here just last week that voice of god put puts up every day so i read that and then i went in and and took that message and i said i'll read up to that point to see what brother band was saying and the first 80 paragraphs brother branham is dealing with everything but the message he's talking about the plans he's talking about they had baby dedication and all and then he gets into this and what brought this thought was he was driving down the road and there was a a advertisement a sign up that said are you hungry just those three words and down at the bottom says three miles ahead and that's all the sign said so he began to talk about a sign an advertisement it's usually uh there's something about a sign that catches your attention they make it in a way to make sure they get your attention and whatever it is but he goes it was just kind of interesting that it just says are you hungry three miles ahead so he began to talk about the advertisement and this is the quote where that comes from let your light so shine before men now the only way that the world will ever see christ is when they see it in you and me that's the only way they'll ever see christ they're conscious or numb to the sunsets to the call of the birds to the leaves and the grass and the flowers and the music and the message and so forth that we enjoy after we've found christ but until we get to the place that we display christ now remember that each one of you from tonight on remember you are god's billboards and you're god's advertising agent now the world will look at you to see what christ is so we don't want to smear a big lot of stuff out there that testify testify about things that we really are not let's first be that then when we be that then the world will see christ in you and me so for some people if i could put it this way you're their hope when they see you how do i get what you haven't that peace that that that satisfaction that no matter in all the turmoil and everything that is going on there's something about you that shows peace that shows an atmosphere that's pleasant to be around now some i i caught that because i caught it myself too not always no we're not always pleasant to be around but there's something catches us quickly and says you ought not to be that way you ought to make that right you you know rather than go on and go on and go on and go on and live that way but he's telling you're god's billboard people are looking at you say you say you're a christian let's see what happens let's see how you handle the situation let's see is this product that you are advertising is it genuine does it really do what you say it does so then the question is asked so here's the other side you're god's advertising agent but other side of me says lord come take me home so let's go to that quote and it's in 63 the seals question and answers and that first line 174 should evangelists continue on the field and brother branham begins to speak on that if they'll play that right now it's a few minutes long and just you can hear that evangelists continue on the field in this hour of course what they mean certainly by all means don't change the thing if jesus is coming in the morning preach today like if it will be tenure or some day but live like it's going to be at this hour don't don't get scrupled up now that's what i'm trying to warn you about see just don't be odd peculiar don't change nothing but if you're doing something wrong or doing evil repent come back to god continue on your evangelistic service just as you always did if you're building a house put it on up jesus comes tomorrow you'll be found faithful of the duty you're building your church go on put it up i'd rather be put my money in something like that be found within my pocket see that so just just keep on continue as you are everybody understand now continue right on just go right on as you are now this uh amen just don't stop don't do nothing just go right on just as you are keep on serving the lord now for instance if you was if you was working for a man and you know what it was 15 minutes before quitting time well you'd say huh just 15 minutes more so i might as well just go over and sit down you get docked for that 15 minutes you're planting wheat blanchard wheat you're digging potatoes go on digging out say well nobody eat them i'll make a difference dig them out anyhow just continue on as you are i got a letter from somebody of these somebody told them said well the time's at hand sell the farm now you won't need the food that you live off of on farms that cost just the millennium is going to start and you won't need it so just go ahead and um while the tribulation period is going on your children's not safe so just let them let the children have the farm or they can eat off but you all sell your farm and uh and uh something like that all they had i said oh my god if i know he's coming tomorrow i was a farmer i put my crop in today amen sir he made me a farmer i'm going to stay right at my duty that's right if he made me a mechanic say who's somebody um said the other day he said a fellow come in and said say um brother you know what he said i'm going to give you the second set of keys i bought a new car he said i'm going to give you the second set of keys i told his pastor so i'm going to give you the second set of keys because the rapture might come you know and said i won't be needed anymore [Music] pastor's gonna miss it let's make it ready isn't it all right well that's that's the way it is see we mustn't be that way we must be a a sane solid christian but i'm put here to work right up to the last minute i've got a job to do and i'll be right bound faithful to foster duty if he comes this morning i will be standing right here in the pulpit you say brother i'm if he has come this morning shouldn't you be out there no sir this is my post of duty amen i'll be standing right here preaching when he comes saying the same things i am there when he comes i'll just move right on out with him if i'm holding potatoes i'll just be horn away just as hard as i can when he comes i'll just drop the hole and take off remember in the jubilee year if they just horn with the hole they kept on holding they know the jubilee years maybe 10 minutes more and the trumpet will sound at the jubilee year they just kept on pitching hey whatever they're doing but when the trumpet sounded then they dropped the fish fart and gone that's it just keep on pitching hey until the trumpet sound all right question according to the opening that that would be say he puts it pretty straight out we'll work till jesus comes i thought about that as as i was i had just read that the last couple weeks and this and what about that thief on the cross at the last moment he hears this day you'll be with me in paradise the 11th hour worker gets the same reward as that first hour worker would we be so how should i say so selfish so hard-hearted that we would say lord they came in at the last minute and i worked for 50 years the reward is the same that's right the reward is the same but if our hearts are right we would want everyone to come in sure and it's it's sometimes and i've known that as a minister and it's it's hard to believe now it's 33 years that we've been coming here um my children were young i sat in the back there we were raising our daughters and i have a little compassion on the young families they get one to finally sit down in church and the next one you're training and then the next one you're training and it's i remember brother jerry mcfadden brother al peterson asked myself and brother jerry to start helping out and ushering and just greeting the folks at the door and after about six months brother jerry asked brother al if he could go sit down with sister amy and help raise the children peter and sharon and eddie and i don't think your youngest sis laura was born yet at that time and brother hal says sure brother jerry you can go do that so i thought surely he'll let me go i got more than brother jerry does and brother al says no brother aaron you stay back here i need you here and i wondered about that and i was talking to brother jerry one day and i said brother jerry i took your place you were here before me and and all and brother jerry looked at me said brother aaron last night i had a dream i was talking to brother branham and i asked him about doing some work and he turned around and said brother jerry you don't speak spanish and that was about the time all these folks began to arrive and we would have the uh balcony full of a spanish-speaking speak student and i would take them up there but i didn't know that but brother al says no you need to stay here god has a reason for all these things standing here looking back that way it's easier to understand but standing here looking that way he was saying i don't know why but there's a reason for all these things that god has done i look at brother brother jordan and brother peter now as young men who have become part of the the body here and and being a part of it in in in now they're my age or a little older than when i got here and we never thought we'd see that day but we're still here and even so come quickly lord jesus but we may have 10 more years so let's keep our shoulder to the wheel and let's keep working so i would like to just bring bring some scriptures here and let's look at the two sides a little bit and we just read psalms 19 9 just to remind you god is in charge he has it all under control nothing is amiss although sometimes it might question why and why but we'll understand it all by and by and sometimes i think do i really need to understand it it's god's word therefore believe it take him out and let him bring it to pass so hebrews 12 verses 1 and 2 chapter 12. and we'll start it this way wherefore seeing that we are are also compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses many that have gone on before us and if i could say even some that are still living but have gone through this already and could tell us hold on don't give up now i have been where you've been i thought it was the end of it it wasn't going to work but here we are today yet he says we have a great cloud of witnesses just speaking of chapter 11 as paul had named it one after another of abel and of moses and he's going down this great cloud of witnesses we have he said let us lay aside every weight that which causes us to to to slow us down to to drag us he's let us lay it aside he says and the sin sin is unbelief brother brahma says sin is unbelief we take and apply sin to everything else and he said no it's unbelief therefore because you don't believe then the other things happen and sometimes that's hard in our understanding he says which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us he says here therefore since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us let us lie lay aside everything that encumbers us sometimes you have to take the heavy coat and take that off sometimes you have to take the work boots off and put little light a lighter pair of shoes to run on some of the greatest runners ran barefoot you ever seen some of those from the from african contents they run barefoot they never had shoes and they're great runners yet sometimes we put everything on to try to run the race but he said let us lay aside those things that we think we need to wear in order to get there now i'm not preaching to disrobe yourself no not at all but the things that you need that you think i got to have this to accomplish this god has placed in you everything you have need of laying aside those things he says and let us run with endurance i've got a goal set before me i know it's if you're doing a marathon 26 miles of running you don't burn yourself out at a hard run over the first two miles there's a pace that is set to be able to endure all 26 miles and let us run with endurance the race that is set before and verse 2 looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith not only does he start it he finishes it the author the one that wrote it described it put it in the book and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross my brother my sister run this race endure this race for the joy that is set before you because sometimes and i ran cross country and um it it was you always had well let me let me rephrase that i always had somebody ahead of me because i never finished first there was always runners ahead of me and sometimes i'd have to key on one and try to pace myself with that one because they were running a little a little faster pace than i was um one time i did manage to start out way out in the very front for the first couple hundred yards and also and i start hearing folks the the the some of my co-runners and come on aaron keep it up keep it up but it didn't take long when i found myself in the middle of the pack and then pretty soon towards the back of the pack but you know what you still set your eyes on the one that's ahead of you and you begin to run and i remember being towards the back of one of the very first runs i did and there was another guy walking and i caught up to him and he says come on just walk with me i don't want to be alone while the rest of them were already way down the the track and i said no at least jog i i'm going to jog at least i'm not going to walk i may not catch those guys but i don't want to walk in the back either i want to give an effort i want to endure as best i can he says but for the joy that was set before him he endured all the way until he said it is finished so there's a thing for us to do as christians as brothers and sisters to endure to encourage to get in a pace of running where we can help one another it's not to the one that finishes first in this race this is not one where just one gets the prize this is one where you run your race to get the prize but we ought to encourage one another it says he despised the shame and he sat down at the right hand of the throne of god and then philippians 1 6 tells us being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ and who started the good work in you was it brother green was it yourself are you able to accomplish it yourself no we need one another we're all part of the body of christ but persuade yourself come to that understanding encourage yourself that he started the work therefore he'll finish the work in me being persuaded the grounds of which persuasion are set down in the following verse that he who hath begun a good work in you will perfect it until the day of christ that he who having justified have begun to sanctify you will carry you on this work till it issue in glory he began it he'll finish it he's not one oh you know what i gotta plan change we're gonna go a different way we've done that enough times on a trip you see a another road hey let's go find out where that road goes let's go the long way let's see me and my wife and the last time we were up in the mountains we decided just to take any dirt road we saw while we were cruising up up there by big lake and all that let's see where this goes five hours later we saw a lot of places we had never seen before and then it's i'm tired let's go find something to eat let's go find something to rest at it was no more all over the mountain it was getting on a road and let's get back to the cabin we're hungry and tired but he realizes he says you you're you're being persuaded you know that this is a race set your eyes on the goal and go pursue that and then hebrews 13 and this is the the scripture that started this hebrews chapter 13 and verse 14 for here we have no continuing city but we seek one to come this world is not my home i'm just a passing through you know and when you've gone on a trip and you've gone and you've passed through it especially if you've been down that road so many times we we used to go camping a lot in california dad loved to take us out we did quite a bit all the way up into canada all over the west states on the west side and of the united states and all but one of the most places we went to was a high sierras on the east side of the house here's kind of would be on the east side the backside of the mountains from yosemite a lot of streams and lakes and it was the same road we would take off through the devour cut off hit 395 drive about eight to ten hours and get to the mountains and there was an a w we would stop at hey kids remember these things to get a soda and ice cream and there was a little museum that we would stop at quite often it's the first time i've ever actually seen gold a gold nugget you could actually see it there but after 10 times on that same trip for an eight-year-old nine-year-old 10 year old 12 year old nothing changed in that museum it was still but dad liked to stop every time and later on as as me and my brothers got older he remembered the museum you remember how dad stopped every time and nothing ever changed but dad liked to go see it you know so we got off we walked we saw it we got in the truck and can you our our vision our thing was getting to the campground that's all we thought of dad enjoyed the trip all the way up there he was the driver too then when we got there we jumped out of the truck and took off running as hard as we could towards the river or the lake whichever one we camped at and then we would hear it get back here boys we still got to unload and that's the part we tried to get away from every time and dad never let us till we got a little older we realized that was part of the job you know there are things at times that get in front of us and we don't want to deal with it it only took at most an hour to get everything unloaded get the camp set up and then we had the rest of the week to enjoy but we thought if we missed that one hour how much we were going to miss sometimes you have a reason to stop and lend a helping hand and encourage somebody and pray for somebody and do something good for somebody on your journey on your trip wherever it is that you're going with the hope and the the heart to get there but not so focused on getting there that you miss somebody on the side of the road that you could help that you could encourage knowing that this is not our home this is not where we're building our empire because we're looking for a city that is to come the same one that abraham said there's that one we're looking for that same one he said we have no permanent city but our longing for that city which is soon to be ours soon brother and it's been 30 years for me it's been 50 years for me it's been compared to eternity that's nothing sometimes you just have to be reminded verse 15 tells us by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name in this journey in this trip in this effort however you want to put it continue to magnify continue to worship him continue to be thankful continuing to be grateful he says and then he tells us but to do good and to communicate forget not or he said for with such sacrifices god is well pleased and then just another way as i was looking at some of the other translations but go on doing good and giving to others because god is well pleased with such offerings let's not get so focused in our journey again that we leave everybody standing on the side of the road that needs help god is well pleased he's walking along the seashore of galilee and and as as the service started and brother matt was leading the song surface and i just i knelt to pray back there and just in my heart i began to say lord you had time to stop and minister to others even though your your heart and everything was set for calvary but you called your own disciples and said come on over the side of the shore and you made them some fish you cook them some fish for them tea you stopped you would stop there with lazarus and martha and mary and have some fellowship with them he went to the woman at the well knowing if anybody saw him with her they'd have a whole different idea of why he was there but he knew why but if you will came around the corner and you saw brother aaron on the corner and there's a lady working that street corner i pray god all of you would say brother aaron is being a missionary a missionary to that sister and not thinking the other way around but we're human and you know what goes to somebody's mind immediately but he had time to stop and minister on his journey to calvary he says in hebrews 10 34. he said for you had compassion of me in my bonds and took this is paul speaking and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that you have a heaven in heaven a better and enduring substance the losses made necessary by becoming christians knowing in yourselves that you have in heaven a better and enduring substance knowing that if they are lost on earth they would gain in heaven i don't have time right now to stop because i could lose this this world's not my home i'm not amassing my fortune and my building and all here but i shouldn't be so preoccupied at being the first to get to heaven that i don't have time to lend to helping him this is what paul said to them he says you had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your in other words you gave of what you had to help someone else but i only have one left give and you shall receive abundantly but be careful that you don't give to receive abundant faith lord i'm going to give these two and knowing you're going to make 10 out of them because i really want the 10. oh that's not where the blessing is all that i am and ever hope to be i owe it all to him so we're looking at that right now as we have no enduring sitting here we're not looking to make this our home now do i say well then just go live in a mud hut go go just live in a tent don't worry but i said no brother ram says no if you're a farmer farm plant if you're a house builder build your house go on some of you young people are going through college nobody wants half a doctor nobody wants somebody who had a year or two as a pharmacist but then quit because i'm not going to that one to get my prescription filled i want one who's graduated i want one who endured i want one who has a good reputation i want one that can read the doctor's writing i say that all the time i when i do a job and the homeowner has to sign you give them the ipad and they sign and some of them do their best and it's we don't we don't provide a stylist to do with your finger and i'm sure that's because the company knows we'd lose all the stylists and they'd be replaced buying them all the time so they use their finger and some of them try to do the most perfect signature but most of us just go like that so when they do something like that oh i see you're a doctor or i say i'm glad you're are you a pharmacist by a chance i go why because that's you have to read those kind of writings and they all kind of laugh and i say i wonder why how a pharmacist reads a doctor's writing manages to get the right prescription i told them one one of them i said i think the pharmacist goes to school for eight years seven and a half to learn to read the writing and the other six months is just to understand medicine and they just kind of laugh but you know what we want somebody who has gone through somebody who has has learned by experience we want somebody whose life shows that they are dedicated to what they're doing a reputation that follows them so again no enduring city we're not building this because i plan to live here eternally no but while i'm here let me be faithful let me be honest let me work till jesus comes it is i know the the the scripture tells us beware when all men speak good of you but i think there's a balance to that too you should have a good reputation you should be a christian you should be honest about things we should have that known about us my my the man that was my boss the the longest he was my boss for almost 20 years he told me one day he says you've got to be the slowest worker i've ever had but when the day is done you get all your work done and it's right he goes so that's good enough i worked with a couple of guys that oh they just never stopped and when the day was done neither was their work because all they did was move around the whole time but a good reputation they come to work they they they give a full day of effort they're they're good people to be around you know and and those are the kind of people that you that you want to hire that you want to be around you know he said so you want that but this world is not your home trying to keep the balance of those two things looking at your checkbook sometimes or your savings account or your 401k and you look at it and say my goodness i really need to push this hard and again i'm not saying don't do that i've seen those that went the other direction and jesus didn't come in 77 and their whole life fell apart they lost their hope you know what does he live like he's coming today a plan like he's not coming for a thousand more years there's a balance to live there on hebrews 13 5-6 let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as ye have for you for he hath said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee so that conversation is not really speaking of the word you speak the things you talk it's the life you live when you look at the word conversation in the scriptures most of the time it's speaking of your lifestyle although at times it is speaking of the conversation the words jesus so another way to say make sure that your character is free from the love of money i wonder why paul goes at this quite often in the scriptures about the love of the things of the world and you really can't love the things of the world participate without money because very little is free out there you know so he says when your drive when you're you everything that you're doing is push to make money therefore to accomplish this he said what is that speaking of your character well brother aaron if i had millions i'd give millions away can you give the one you have away right now i'm talking to myself because i struggled with this for a long time too lord i only have five dollars in my wallet i can't help nobody i find out quickly that if i give those five those five multiply quickly i also found out that i can't give it away so it will multiply i have to do it with the right attitude in the right heart that's what paul is saying here he says that your character is free from the love of money being content with that which you have for he himself said i will never desert you nor will i ever forsake you the same god that was there on the side of the hill and says we've got to feed these people and peter and the disciples who should have known better you could say he turned the water into wine he'd done enough things in front of them that they should have said what did mary say go ask him i've watched him i've seen him i've seen what he does go ask him he knows how to take care of this the disciples said lord how are we going to feed there's so many of them and he goes what do you have well there's three fishes and five loaves and jesus goes well it's more than enough wow this i gotta see it was more than enough he says for the lord is my helper so that we may boldly confidently without fear say the lord is my helper and i will not fear what man shall do unto me well aaron it's happened a few times i've gotten laid off work got slow got laid off god never failed because there's layoffs happening because there's work short god never fails if he can take two fishes and fi five levels of bread or three loaves of bread whatever and feed twelve thousand is he not the same yesterday today and forever and then paul tells us in philippians 4 9 those things which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the god of peace shall be with you why could paul say that because paul had experienced it paul a man who who looked at his own genealogy look where his his lineage was and said if you want to compare uh uh what's the word who is who is fit for this who has more reason to justify himself or stand on his own merits listen to mine and he gives them and they're flawless but he says i had to count that as nothing because if paul had had said i'm that first church age messenger and therefore i understand the scriptures therefore i will be able to lay it all out for you the same thing that brother branham said at the seventh age messenger if that angel had not come into the room with me when he's going to minister the seven seals he said what a mess i would have made because it's not of ourselves paul was the first sage of messenger to recognize it's not of me learn of thee he said and the god of peace because he understood where he came he'll be with you too so we're not left alone you're not in this by yourself we're part of family of god we're a body joined together but the eye can't be the finger and the finger can't be the eye in fact most of the time the finger is poking the eye if you're not careful i've never had my eye chase my finger down to bite it or anything but my finger has poked my eye quite a few times but it's part of the body and it has its place i've never been able to grab the glass of water with my eye and drink out of it but i can take my hand and use my fingers and bring it to my mouth and drink it's part of the body every part you'll remember some of those things it's part of the body we need one another but paul says those that you have learned and received and heard and seen in me there is a visible testimony that a christian gifts not in words but in actions brother greene taught us something i always remember it so when god speaks to you and you remember he would say don't say a little bird he told me it blew in in the wind he said understand that's a god working in your life don't get credit to a little birdie he would say yeah you know what that was i was building up your faith to understand that god deals with you too that he's mindful of you he knows you by name he's and he would say you see god tells you to do something you don't do it and you get in trouble for it and you question was it really god and then he tells you again and you question it and you don't do it you get in trouble for it kind of like mom and daddy would do when we were young children learning and then he said about the third or fourth time you began to pay attention and say god said it i'm gonna go do it because i know what happens if i don't i'm beginning to learn a lesson and that's how we learn lessons by doing them and doing it sometimes you can get less and right the first time sometimes you don't it's all part of the character building so paul reminds us and brothers and sisters there are those that are new in christ there are those that are young and they're looking at you you who have served god for a long time and they're watching so that to see if it's the same as with you as it was with paul those things which you have seen both learned and received and heard and and seen in me do do also the older sisters ought to teach the youngers you older brothers ought to be men in front of the young because you've learned by experience we have to continue the same way philippians chapter 1 verse 27 again paul tells us only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of christ he says i i i look at that and you say it becometh the gospel of christ that whether i come and see you or else be absent i may hear of your affairs that you stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel not a church that's split not a body that's broken up this one pulling that way this one going that way but a body that's united a people that are encouraging one another that are strengthening one another let it be heard of that let it be seen of that he said let that which is manifested in how you act and live let it be seen that way or only conduct yourselves in a matter manner worthy of the gospel of christ simple way to understand then in philippians we'll go through philippians here chapter 3. you know sometimes in reading the messages studying the messages and brother branham and then getting into the scriptures especially in the new testament realizing how much paul wrote how much time he had to deal with dealing with the church's congregations we would have loved if brother branham could have just come and not had to deal with all this other and just get into the depth of the word and the message like everybody says brother it's in the depth of the message but he said you are yet children i i had this this habit i don't know if that's the right word but i did it to my daughters when they're little and i've done it to my granddaughter and it's mean but i seem to like it so i do it they start counting one two three and i start going no no it goes five three seven six till mama would get mad she would say stop it you're going to confuse them and i thought it was funny but then i realized it's not that funny because i am confusing them but you see as children we have to learn i hear chloe and asher now they're mama's teaching them to count teaching them their colors and she'll send us a snap of them counting and their colors and all and we're excited to say wow look at she can count all the way to 20 now but it took somebody to teach them and work with them we just don't sit down and it all comes there's a conversation a life to be lived so that others coming in can learn can receive paul said it that way those things that you have learned of me so he says here paul says this and watch what paul says here starting with verse seven but what things were gained to me those i counted lost for christ now we know paul because he had just been talking about his lineage about his heritage about his qualifications he said if you want to count it that way i am more qualified than you are i have more phds i have more degrees i have more schooling than you have if you want to count it that way he says yea doubtless i count all things but loss for the excellency of the of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord i think about paul on as a first age messenger and the things that god brought through him the scriptures and all the foundation of christianity and and it was allowed to be written so that we could have it and here's a man who battles his education he has to say i count it for loss i can't depend on it i i can't that's not my foundation in fact i trot on it i count it as dung that which was walked over on the road and you have a seventh age messenger brother branham who comes to restore us back to what the first stage messenger brought and he struggles because he did not have education all that i could have and you hear him you hear him he's walking through oral roberts university and he says this of himself the splendor and the beauty of it all and he says obviously lord you couldn't trust me to handle all of this i wouldn't be able to do it and he says many times oh that i could have had some education i could do this i could have in his mind it was a struggle and then when he steps out of that university those buildings god did not speak to him while he was in there but when he got out of the influence of that then that voice said but i am your portion if we're not careful we get caught up in all that's around us and we're not hearing god is saying i am more than that i am more than that and that's what paul is saying here i realize that i have to count that i have to lay this for the knowledge the excellency of getting to know him personally he says well yea doubtless and i count all things but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that i may win christ the loss of all things everything that he deemed that he had worked for he said i've lost it all for the excellency of getting to know him then he says and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law the works the do's and don'ts performing this taking care of that making sure that i pray for three hours every morning that i read a message every day that i and if we're not careful it becomes allah rather than a desire see when you desire to do something it's easier to do it when it becomes a law it becomes a work and we talk about this in relationships all the time you know and um a relationship is work it just doesn't happen in its own but there's joy in a good relationship there's desire it it's um we were talking the other day because sarah has gotten in into making some of her own arrangements with flowers just something she does to keep herself occupied and one day i was coming home and i don't really remember what what the occasion was and i stopped at a at the grocery store to pick up something and i saw the display of flowers and i don't remember if it was mother's day or what it was and and i went to the lady and i'm looking there and it's been displayed and i couldn't find something i lied and she goes well can i make you something i said yeah that would be nice and so she goes what would you like and i said put some of these and put some of these and and i i arranged it i don't know how it happened but i did you know got it all arranged and she put it in and i walked from there to the cash register and i kept getting stopped where did you get that it's so beautiful and and they i said well the lady actually made it for me and walking out to the vehicle again i was getting stopped that's such a beautiful arrangement i think but here was an amazing part i get home with it and there was a flower for each one my wife and each one of the girls and i didn't know this but each flower is in there was a favorite of each one of them now i knew that and i arranged it no i didn't god knows how to do that part you make you yield yourself you say lord use me and watch him go to work but they all were saying and they remember we're talking about it sarah she goes i remember that you came home and it was beautiful and each one of our flowers were in there um half the time i forgot to get flowers from my wife on our anniversary it was just one of those things that god showed me he's in charge he made a bouquet of flowers for me one time you say oh brother aaron how could that be well i know what it did for me sitting in my company vehicle at lunch parked on the side of the road and a little whirlwind come down the street and the palo verde trees have all the little flowers and had just fallen it picked it up and was coming down the street in a bouquet like that in that shape and it went around my truck and then it went down and i said he's mindful of me you could see it any way you want to but i said he's mindful of me he just went by and said he loves me that's how i saw it and another time sitting at the at the at the kitchen table was home by myself and i just spoke these words out loud i said lord is everything okay between me and you and i heard a rushing sound i looked out the west window with a kitchen window looking out west and that tree is not moving at all but suddenly my front door or the kitchen door opens which i didn't have it all the way closed it opens and there's a little whirlwind right there and it stops at my door and it just spins for a while and then it goes out and continues but it didn't touch anywhere else now i saw that i know it happened you don't have to believe it but he came by to tell me it's okay see he knows how to do those things we just have to make ourselves available to him use me lord however it is on my journey home paul says i found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law which is of my works but by the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death being willing to say not me lord you not my will but thy will be done that if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead because i know i cannot raise myself i know i cannot live eternally without the eternal one in me paul's saying all that i have done doesn't guarantee me a resurrection but this him he does and then he says this not as though i have already attained either were already perfect complete whole mature but i follow after that i may apprehend that for which i am also apprehended of christ that i can go after that the way he came after me and took a hold of me because that's what paul says that i may go after and apprehend that the way he came and apprehended me he came down and knocked me off my high horse put me on the floor until i could recognize who he was and then he says and not that or another way they're not that i have already obtained the prize or i'm already perfected but i pursue that i may also get possession of it seeing that also i have been taken possession of by christ jesus it's christ in me he says the hope of glory he says brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before i look back sometimes and say i don't want to go back that way i made a mess out of it looking past that uh maybe some of those steps were were good steps but sometimes they weren't but i'm still i'm not going to judge myself by that and live in that i'm going to go forward i'm going to continue to press towards the mark of the high calling verse 14 i press towards the mark of the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus let us there for as many as be perfect well most of you said well that's not me the perfect one lives in you and he sees you through the blood and you're his righteousness you're as righteous as he is righteous because it's his righteousness in you you have to be careful sometimes what you say about yourself and i understand that's why i was trying to show you with show you with paul and brother branham him battling his education and brother brandon battling the lack of education but in in all both of them yielded completely to christ and let christ do the work the same is for me and you there's things that brother lyle can do that i can't touch you know he shared some of the things that that he did and and what what what is his work field on i i wouldn't even know where to start but i'm trying to think of something that maybe he can't do that i could do that's kind of hard but no i know let's get a brother up here and speak in spanish and let's have brother lie interpret for him brother lyle wouldn't even come up okay but god has ordained you to do i dare sister holly to come and play the piano she's not even going to try to get up but if i ask sister lily to come she'll come up and play the piano watch because that's what sister lady does each one of us has a part to play each one of us has something god has placed us to do and therefore i can do all things through christ who strengthens me because it's him and you then he says that he says let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and then he says and if anything he otherwise be otherwise god will reveal this unto you if you have some questions you're wondering god will reveal it unto you this is the way my child this is the way to go brother brahm had a lot of questions one day he's walking through greens mill 14 mile creek where the cave was and jehovah god jehovah of the old testament is jesus christ of the new and brother brown said the whole bible becomes a whole new bible when god begins to show it to you it changes the whole view and another way paul says is then let us all have become to full growth be of this mind and if anything you are of if anything you are of a different mind even this will god make clear to you paul knew that he was writing the word of god and that's why he had to stand and his brother branham says if any man teach anything different paul says it let him be a curse brother ramstein says this is the word of god he says stand on it he couldn't be any different than that first stage messenger neither with every messenger in between what god gave him they stood on every bit of it he said nevertheless where to we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing or another way let's not lose any ground let's not go backward let's go forward he says for our conversation is in heaven from whence we also look for the savior the lord jesus christ or another word for this is our citizenship is in heaven from whereas we also wait for a savior the lord jesus christ and i looked up the word citizenship the state of being vested with the rights privileges and the duties of a citizen now who vested that in you was it brother green at tucson tabernacle was it brother branham for this message was it paul knows christ he says been vested in you as a citizen of this country and then he says it this way who will change or shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself and this one line who shall fashion a new the body of our humiliation how much how often this guy embarrasses this guy often oh there you go again haven't you learned anything when are you going to grow up oh lord how long i'm glad you're patient with me lord but i've done it again paul says there's a change coming in the meantime let us press towards the mark of the high calling let us work with our all give it our all but in my giving now all let me have some time to reach my arm over my brother take my brother by the hand encourage my sister say come on let's go forward till we get there it's christ in us the hope of glory let me say it again it's christ in us the hope of glory without it there is no hope of glory the musicians would come lord i have no continuing city here my aim my heart is looking forward to that city whose builder and maker is god oh that city where the lamb is the light all those things but i've got a journey yet to complete i have some more steps to take and let me put my shoulder to the wheel let me continue as brother branham said if you're a farmer keep farming whatever you're affiliated keep working on as a christian till that day beulah land i'm longing for you [Music] let's bow our heads for the lord our hearts desire i believe everyone here maybe there's some immediate things that we would say well i need to get this done i've got to finish this but really down deep our hearts desires is to leave this life behind and to go with me be with you for eternity lord but you told us today lord there's work still to do until that day let us be of that mindset and press towards the mark of the high calling [Music] to encourage one another to be faithful in the position the place you've you've put us to be or because that that one part that doesn't get done could cause the failure of the whole process we've seen it happen many times that last little bolt didn't get tightened all the way it was missing a washer or a seal the lug nuts didn't get tightened all the way and the tire fell off and there was an accident in it lord let us make sure the lord we do that which we're called to do as we seek and if we go forward wanting to go home we ask jesus christ i'm kind of [Music] oh [Music] no sad good [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Music] let's stand as we sing this next verse [Music] it will end inside oh there's just a few more days and i will take my heavenly [Music] shall we sweet the chorus one more time [Music] and [Music] shall be [Music] sweet [Music] brother aaron you just told us that we still got to work till we get to there but you're singing about yeah my heart is longing for that but until then my heart will go unseen and until then with joy i'll carry on rather than that mean i have to have a good attitude at work too yes this world's not my home sometimes when it gets hard just begin to realize that this is about to end and we're going to be crossing [Music] let's start with the first verse my heart can sing when i pause to [Music] remember [Music] there's [Music] but until my [Music] i'll carry on [Music] until the day my eyes behold [Music] until the day god calls me the things of earth [Music] and the things that cause the heart to tremble remember [Music] i'll carry on [Music] until my eyes behold [Music] until the day god calls me if you can purpose in your heart to do that until that day lord which could be tomorrow morning it might not be for five more years i don't know that he knows but until then my heart will go and with joy i'll carry him until that night oh that day when when we realized it's we start seeing the saints amongst us it's here it's here but he didn't say then to stop and sit down he said if i knew he was coming i worked to that moment right to the area and this step from this life god bless you this morning god be with you and as like i said we won't have service this evening but set your wings on the winds of faith set them there rather than it's so tiring it's so hard and i know it gets that way we all do but let my wings be set on the wings of faith if i get to get the words to them oh there are [Music] oh take the word god [Music] [Applause] [Music] do not struggle it's my grace way oh watch [Music] much [Music] it will move to the wind [Music] it's my grace [Music] he does not struggle he does for the power that makes him right here's already [Laughter] [Music] you can fly to a higher place do not struggle it's my grace [Music] do not struggle it's by grace brother aaron i just can't do it that's right you can't yield it all to him let him do its christ in you he's your everything he's your god bless you thank you be with you until wednesday night when we meet again and see what god has for us amen god is god [Music] and is love him i love him love him [Music] and i'll praise his man [Music] you
