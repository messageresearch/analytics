[Music] oh [Music] all things are possible [Music] only believe all things are possible only believe amen amen you can you can have your seat do you get it if you fail come back to this tape again i don't know how much longer i'll be with you remember this is the truth of thus said the lord it's the truth it's a scripture like the seven mysteries of the seven last seals the mysteries of them the seals have done been broken every age had come down and there they left a lot of scattered and god not willing that it should be scattered he comes back and picks up those things those doctrines that started and brought it on out and revealed the whole thing same thing he's doing now in revealing the mystery of christ how he was god's threefold purpose for the church oh my let him not reveal reveal webster says is to make no one make noise and especially webster says in divine truth that revelation means revelation it is christ's way of making himself known to his church now we're going to say now brother braham you're just saying this no we won't say just say this i notice he made himself known to peter now if you want to mark this down and we if you want to read it we'll read it if you want to and um uh matthew 16 15 and 17 are quoted when they come from the mount transfiguration he says who does man say i the son of man am some says oh they think you're elijah and some says you're one of the prophets jeremiah or some of them but that wasn't what he asked he said who do you think that i am now now there's a church he's talking to what does man think i am today he's a philosopher this social religion he's a good man we believe his teachings right it's a subject to be lived by i think it make us all better if we did we already have our churches or our so forth that's a santa claus like a santa claus story it's not expressions of some church that we should express some it's a life that you don't live yourself that he comes in you and lives by itself and you become a prisoner to any human intellectual being at all you're led by the spirit how do you know now you say i might know i was losing my mind maybe a mass loses his mind does that but if you have the mind of christ christ expresses himself through you shows that it's him and not you've not lost your mind some people under illusions of things goes out and becomes insane well that we know that's wrong that's the devil trying to impersonate the real thing before he gets here always the bogus but a real man is to lose his own thoughts and his own thinking not come up blindly like that no sir you come up with your right senses and christ takes you over and expresses itself and out to the world you're an insane person now if you're insane you're actually insane then there's nothing the devil can't take you in complete control he'll make you do everything contrary to this word but when christ takes you over he'll express that word right through because it's him he is the word and then you can see the expression of christ not some illusion of some sort but a real genuine christ expressing himself right through you how beautiful now watch he said who do you say i am he's asked in the church he's 12 out of the millions of that day he asked 12 his church in the millions in the days of noah he asked eight amen and he said as it was in the days of noah so will it be in the coming of the son of man where eight souls were saved i don't say go be eight save now i don't get that all wrong i never said that i don't know how many people be saved and that that's the that last moment to to rapture that little group it'll be a small group i'll tell you that or straight is the gate and there is a wave a few there will be they'll find it but when the great ransom body through all ages comes up man that's going to be a great throne there revelation 7 expresses great number which no man can number through all the ages has come up down it's walked in the light of the bible as far as it was revealed to them and now we know that wesley had more light than luther did we know a pentecost outshine wesley see certainly does because it just gradually let loose as it did down through the prophets and so forth it was perfectly made known to godhead bodily in christ and now the christ in the church is just being made known the whole thing is a revelation of god to take eve back to her right position again with her husband noticing god is the husband of the church and the church is his bride now peter when he calls said thou art the christ the son of the living god now watch blessed art thou simon bar jonah says which means son of jonah see blessed art thou for flesh and blood never reveal this to you you never learned it from some school but my father which is in heaven has revealed you notice what he said to him upon this rock that's peter the predestinated seed of god that will receive this light and give me the keys to the kingdom upon this rock of revelation of who jesus christ is he's a full manifested god upon this rock not a father son and holy ghost and him being the second person up on this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell will never shake it down never prevail against me i'll build my church upon this a revelation of jesus christ look christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation see christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation amen christ in the bible makes the bible the complete revelation of christ christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what god's trying to do what is the new birth then you'd say brother brown what is new birth it is the revelation of jesus christ personally to you amen not you joined the church you shook a hand you done something different you set a creed you promised to live by a court of rules but christ the bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's christ pastor priest whatever it might be it's christ in you that is a revelation that the church was built upon you say well i'm a lutheran i'm a baptist i'm presbyterian that don't mean don't mean that to god not a thing not a snap of your finger what is it it's christ being revealed and he is the word and when the word is revealed it expresses itself see that's god's purpose for jesus christ was to express himself to take his own laws and live by his laws con and fulfill his law by death christ god died in flesh in order to condemn uh sin in the flesh that he might bring to himself a glorious bride redeemed back that will believe only in the word of god and not swap it like eve did for intellectual conceptions of man amen sin that's christ's idea that's god's idea the new birth reveals this and if a man says he's born again and try to place these promises of christ in this last days to some other age making him christ gesture but not today then that man or that person has been in a delusion by satan and if that man says that he believes that and it doesn't manifest itself through him jesus said in mark 16 these signs shall follow them to believe and all the world's ever aged casting out devils and speaking with tongues and and all these great manifestations of gifts that would follow that they shout not they may be they ought to they will and heavens and earth will pass away but his word won't so it's christ expressing himself in the individual whether he's intellectual or whether he's he don't know his abcs half the apostles didn't know it but they know christ they never taken heed to peter and john knowing if they had been out of some seminary they said they'd taken he notices they've been with christ when they healed the lame man thing at the gate they know they had been with christ the new birth is christ is a revelation god has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth now what are you going to do and get all that group together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and god expressed it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the wrath shall go when it knows what it is now notice you say brother brandon but that is oh yes it is too it is the truth did you notice paul never knew jesus physically paul never knew him the only way that paul knew him was by a revelation by a vision is that right paul only knew jesus by the revelation just like peter did peter had seen in flesh but he didn't know him by flesh because jesus said so flesh and blood didn't reveal it to you even my own life didn't reveal it to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed the thing to you that he is the word of god and upon this rock i build my church peter didn't know him by flesh man walked and handled him and everything else paul had something greater than any of the apostles did see they said well i i've got more of a revelation you paul because you know i'll walk with him i went fishing with him one day i heard him talk he sat in a boat with me and actually told me let's go over here and fish in this place we get more fish and we did it see we see him do things but paul saw him after he was dead buried rose again and expressed himself in the pillar of fire that led the children of israel knowing paul being a jew would never call that lord unless he had seen the expression he was back the same yesterday and forever he said paul in other words i'm the same god today that it was yesterday here i am in the same light the pillar of fire that moses talked to in the burning bush no wonder he could separate the law from grace over in the book of hebrews he met that same pillar of fire he said i'm jesus whom you persecuted expressed himself in vindicating himself the same revealing the mystery of god that's been a hit since the foundation of the world sin paul only knew him about knew him by revelation peter knew him by revelation he walked with him talk with him therefore you can set this word i just said that he was the word now a scholar can sit down and read that word well he can just tie your mind up in any way he if he wants to do it because he's smart brilliant get a catholic priest or not so much as that as a real good trained theologian in the bible brother a baptist or a presbyterian or something he'll make you think that you don't know nothing when it comes to talk why see because that he has noted him in the flesh the word but the only way you're saved is by knowing by revelation if i can take i take the presbyterian doctrine and tie you pentecostal you want to i take the baptist doctrine and show you pentecostals a million things that you know nothing of them ryan but that's not it that's not his church that's not his church his church is himself revealed amen do you see it and expressed by the word itself that he is god how can you say father son holy ghost and be baptized tonight amen how can you say you know jesus christ he's the word well it's not a scripture in the bible there is not a place where anybody was ever baptized in the name of father son holy ghost and you and you jesus only people just using the name jesus for baptism i'm personally acquainted with four or five jesus is myself so you see what your denominations lead you into that's the darkness the expression of cain who brought fruits instead of blood amen but the revelation come through the blood through jesus christ who is the blood of god creating blood in the womb of mary and paul knew him by revelations that's how we know him today is only the only way you can do it now say i'm methodist that means nothing i'm baptist that means nothing i'm catholic that means nothing but by the revelation that god has revealed the word to you he is the word and the word how you know it's revealed it lives itself and expresses itself through you oh churches has long forgotten that great revelation that's right revelation of the truth they have forgotten they went to now when luther raised up he was a great man he had the revelation of that day but what happened a bunch of ricky's got in flat top haircuts as we call him today and ricketts and all of them they got around there and uh and uh and the first thing you know it's their uh that's expression if you only only knew the numerology of the bible you know what elvis or ricky means to the scripture just like why did jesus say there's nothing to that your name there isn't that name could only come in this last days for this last days people why did jesus change abram's name to abraham man sarah to sarah why did you change um a saul to paul why did you change simon to peter and so forth you see it certainly means something that name cannot be spoken till this day that's the reason we got this hellish thing we got in the earth today because of such things the whole human race is corrupted it's it's gone that's why it is notice now he was all right he was in his days luther and he had the revelation as soon as he left look what they did wesley had a message look what it did the old early pentecostals hadn't looked like they did they got a bunch of man together it's not exactly the same thing that god by grace sent israel a pillar of fire a prophet a sacrifice and showed himself among them and brought him out of egypt across the red seas and they wanted a law so they could have great dignitaries they could have something to do into it and what did they do they was left in the wilderness for 40 years to wander and not one of that organization ever went over and joshua the only two stood out and said we're able to take it to look at the word of god every one of them died in the wilderness and jesus said they were eternally gone right after it showed his blessings and power their ages like luther wesley and so forth did he said our fathers eat man in the wilderness she said and they're everyone dead that's eternal separated from god their carcass is perished in the wilderness they're dead i'm the bread of life that come from god out of heaven they couldn't see it they just couldn't see it all right church has long forgotten it they accepted intellectual uh message intellectuals membership knowledge instead of the revelation of the truth of the word now look here they say today do you believe that god commissioners go into all world heal the sick and preach the gospel and cast out devils oh oh yes i suppose that right but you see a lady told me the other day she said well all the churches are in harmony i said there isn't one of them in harmony with the other amen there's catholics standing there i said how about you you're a methodist and that's catholic are you in harm in one another i said this pope conrad united together that's a good thing for all that kind of people but the church of god has nothing to do with it it's out from the whole bunch yes sir you want to unite that together and one believes in something the other methodist takes franklin the baptist taking person and both of them denying the holy ghost and his fullness of the power they said we receive the holy ghost when we believe the bible said have you received the holy ghost since you believe there's a difference that's right see and they say we're the catholic church we started early we did this the methods say we are based upon the bible jesus said these signs shall follow them and believe now where's that works that i do shall you do all so every creature every person that believes in him now where is it at that's his words heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail now where's it at right oh it just shows what is it it's a hybrid condition look here you take a big fine grain of corn it's hybrid and you take a hybrid corn it's a pretty corn but you plant it what do you get a little stalk comes up like this and turns yellow and wheels down that's where every denomination is once hybrid with man's words mixed with god's word it'll come up to the signs and wonders and what jesus said about believing the word it turns yellow and say we can't accept it go back just like all them other spies that it went over look at canaan they come over there and say oh we look like grasshoppers sodom we can't take them the amalekites so all these what they're going to do and they went back and caleb and joshua being thoroughbreds amen by the word of god no god said i give you that man they said we're more than able to take it amen it depends on where you're born from if you're born to the word of god god's word has a preeminence is in his church that's what he died for that's his purpose that he might uh be able to achieve to have his premise working in his church let the word of god shine forth first no matter what anything else looks like i don't care if the intellectual says this that it has nothing to do with it god's word said so and we were more than able to take it if i preached that my church the minister told me said i'd be preaching the four posts in the church i said i'd preach that god's word said so we can do it god said do it amen amen oh yeah they excuse themselves for this see that's why they're blind to the message of the end time this last days when god is proving himself they try to class it as some kind of a spiritist or some uh oh what would i call it some mental an illusion or something on that order see they they try to make it something that it is and just like they did when he was here when jesus is here they called him beelzebub a fortune teller now they say it's kind of like a mental telepathy thing when they know that he could stand there and look upon the people and discern the very thoughts is in their heart the bible said so well does not hebrews the fourth chapter says the word of god is quicker and sharper than a two-edged sword and concerned the very thoughts of the mind and he was that word and when that word is permanence in the man the same thing takes place again for it is the word amen see how you can stumble over this they're so perfectly plain see all right that's why they're blind same as it was in the days crisis on earth oh my they staggered the same way they said he's bills above yeah they said he could do it so they said he's just a he was born a legitimate child kind of an odd fella he just got possessed for some devil he's a he's a samaritan over there and he's got a devil in him that's how he does that jesus said i'll forgive you for that is he calling the word of god the works of god an evil spirit he said i forgive you for that but someday the holy ghost will come one word against it will never be forgiven neither in this world or the world that is to come or that great day it will not be forgiven so i see that's written plain in the scripture so when people come to that day no matter how intellectual how big a denomination they belong to it's condemned they have to be they blasphemed the holy ghost calling it holy roller in something that had an un tasty name or something like that and god's church had to bear it all the time even paul before griffith said in the way that's called heresy which means crazy that's the way i worship the god of my mother that green international scholar had to come to that place in a way that's called heresy why it was revealed to him that killed our fire hanging before him said i'm jesus the great god that was in the wilderness out with moses i am he and it's hard for you to kick against the preacher when paul said i know that life was laying at stake he said the way it is called heresy that's the way i worship the god of our father it was called that because it was revealed to him what the great truth of christ was and today people say it's a denomination it's jesus christ the new birth revealed in you and he has a premium and it says that he might express his words and anything that he's promised in his last days he can bring it to pass to his body as he's working hey man it's just exactly the word of god made manifest notice all right same as in the days of christ god holds a key to this revelation of christ himself you believe that schools of theology can never find it jesus said so if you want to read it now in saint matthew 11 25 and 27 i thank the old father god of heaven's earth that thou s hid this from the eyes of wise and prudent reveal it to babes such as would learn amen see see i don't care look at them scholars of that day those jews very fine man they're organizations of pharisees sadducees and herodians and whatever they might be see all the great organizations and jesus said you're blind you lead the blind isaiah speak of you you have ears and can't hear an eyes that you can't see because isaiah said this in the spirit therefore the god of heaven has blinded your eyes you're doing like eve did accepting the intellectual side and know nothing of the spirit of god therefore won't they all fall in the ditch both the leader and the blind too the leader will fall with the blind because he's blind also the leader fall as blind leading the blind they both fall in the ditch and god also holds this king expressed the same thing in the previous scriptures a while ago when i read it when he said uh who does man say i the son of man am and peter said the art the christ the son of the living god he said blessed art thou simon a son of jonathan flesh and blood never revealed this to you my father which is in heaven upon this revelation here alone i'll build my church the gates of hell will never prevail against it see now you see so therefore there's no school no theologians no teachings of the bible among any school that knows anything about it they cannot know nothing about it's impossible for them to know anything about it god has hid the senses of anointing from the very elected teachers and everything else it's a personal individual affair with the person that christ has revealed to them and if you say it's been revealed to me and then the life that christ produced here in the bible that same life is in him does not produce itself in you then you've got the wrong revelation if i put a life of a pumpkin into the life of a pear tree it would bear pumpkins or other fruits you shall know them exactly right if the first you put out a tree a grapevine and it put out a bunch of grapes the first shoot it put out broke grapes the next brought out lemons and nixon brought out pears and next brought out apples there's some kind of a grafted a fairy in there it's bearing its own life every denomination will bear life of itself but if that original vine ever puts out another uh uh shoot it'll bear grapes like it did the first time if the life the life of jesus christ ever puts out another body of believers it'll bear the fruit that the first one did they'll write a book of acts behind it because it'll be the same the same life praise god see what i mean you just can't get away from it it's the life of christ in you being injected in you by the holy spirit itself living its life through you blind leaders of the blind notice god holds this key alone no theologian can tell you it's not known it's hid from them they know nothing about it so the schools when you say i got a phllld you only make you're to me now i believe into god and to any real true believer that means you're just that much farther away it's backed off god is not known by education he's not knowing about how to explain it god is known by simplicity and of revelation of jesus christ is the most illiterate person see not your theology it's a revelation of jesus christ upon this rock i'll build my church no other rocks accepted no other things accepted no other roman rock nor the protestant rock nor other school nor there nothing but on exactly the revelation of jesus christ through the new birth he borns in there and he injects his own life and your life is gone and the life of christ is projecting itself through you with the preeminences to the people that they see the very life and works and signs and wonders that he did is doing the same thing through you outside of that the rest of us not even called to it all watch god's great revelation unfolding by lack of this revelation is why we have so many different divisions among us and so much mockery so much uh division among us that because the people like that revelation they like that revelation the teachers paul after his great revelation of christ said in first corinthians the second chapter be sure to read that as you write it down watch oh he said i ever come to you with wisdom look at that man who did have the wisdom but look at that man who had the scholarship i'd never come to you with them kind of a word first corinthians the second chapter of first corinthians oh let's just read can you stand a minute let's read this first or two i'd just like to read it so you you wouldn't be can get even the people on the tape to turn back to it anyhow give them a chance first corinthians the second chapter listen to this great apostle here paul the intellectual servant of god let's look at here i paul when i come to you came not with excessively a speech of wisdom declaring to you the testimony of god i never said i i'm dr so and so for i am determined not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified and i was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling my speech and and my beseeching was not with any enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and power of the power there see there's a gospel jesus said go you know the world preach the gospel didn't say go teach he said go preach in other words demonstrate the power and these signs shall follow them just teaching doesn't do it it takes the actual spirit itself demonstrating these signs listen to this that your face should not stand in the wisdom of man but in the power of god oh my see to change the man none of what i can explain away and say he's not the same when he is the same if i do that it shows to me it's surely a man tell me that which showed me he don't have the revelation the threefold revelation of god hey now in high bid and weakness among you that are perfect yet we're not with the wisdom of the world but all the princes of this world that come to naught but we speak the wisdom of god in mystery see the threefold mystery of god even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew none of the priests rebuy rabbis pardon me or anything knew anything about it for had they known it they would have not crucified the lord of glory you said you're wrong about rabbis and preachers there who crucified him amen save time because we got uh uh just not getting late yet but we just got plenty here to say if the lord will help us now lack of this now and paul this great intellectual man never tried to express his great theological terms upon the people he humbly accepted the word of the lord and he lived the word so it expressed he lived so it was so godly until they seen jesus christ in him so much so they wanted his handkerchief to take and laid upon the sick there's the life of christ i watched something oh you see elijah done that long time ago ladies stick but oh that was the days of elijah now the world thought that the intellectual priests and things and churches that they thought that but the unbelievers they no different they seen the revelation of christ that was in elijah the same thing was in paul expressed the same kind of life because he was a prophet he foretold things that happened exactly the way it was and they know that was god's identification of a prophet and they know that he was god's prophets you couldn't shake them from it at all even when they seen peter foretell those things and come to pass they said just let his shadow pass over me amen that's the church that's the ones that believe it yes sir it was revealed by why paul say because i i got a ph.l.d and so forth they believe me no he said i forgot all those things the wisdom of mans that had to die now i know him in the power of his resurrection that's what i come to you at for the demonstration of god's power what was it making jesus christ the same yesterday and forever the same works that jesus did paul did the same and they seemed god the great father that had demonstrated in the burning bush had demonstrated to paul and here it was being demonstrated and he's the same in every age god's threefold manner yesterday today and forever what redeemer in his church for eminence in the coming kingdom amen you see it just as perfect as it can be oh notice the holy ghost is the only revealer of the divine revelation of christ there's no school can do it no scholar can do it no man how well educated how godly or anything else is no man can do it i could sting hard here how many christians born again raise up your hands filled all the ghosts all right here we go then all right notice and he will only do it to the predestination all the father has given me will come and no man can come except the fathers give him to me first look at that present this man's belgium he's a fortune teller he's a devil that little woman walking around there living with six husbands she lived with five and had the sixth one then and jesus said go get your husband come here she said i have no husband said yes you've got six you've had five and the one you're living with now is not your husband she said sir what that light struck that seed when he shut down priests and said this man is a fortune teller see no life there hybrid could come up as far as the organization but died from their own but this woman's not a hybrid he said sir i perceive i can see your big pretty eyes shine up like that tears running on her cheeks sir i perceive that you're a prophet i'm looking for a messiah and when that messiah comes he'll do this very same thing he'll tell us these things he said i'm he oh lord she left her there he is see a man who's told me the things what was it that light struck that seed that life was there to come forth same thing today but the theologian said now wait just a minute i'll find out it's so-and-so pastor moody settered what's pastor moody got to do with this this day pastor moody lived in his day but not now certainly luther lived in his day but not in the day of wesley wesley in his day not the day of pentecost pentecost leaving their day but they're a long ways from this we're in the last hour sure there are organizations and scruples up proves that it's not there the word has never been correctly vindicated just only in his strength seeds denominations and it make denomination put that old gypsum weed seeds in with that genuine wheat died right out crop went to jameson all right green bars and nettles went all back to that it died right out then they broke the field up and started over again playing some real seeds and some of them come up and choked it out but then god said in this last days he'd bring out our people washing his blood and they were predestinated to be there they've got to be there god said so and it would reveal and the very sign i was malachi 4 and what he would do restore back again bring back in the last days these great things that he promised it bring the revelation what is what c to do malachi 4 was to bring back the faith of the fathers to the children see that's right bring that same thing the same pillar of fire in on the scene the same signs the same wonders the same jesus making him the same preaching him the same vindicating him the same yesterday today and forever i will restore saith the lord all the years that the methodist worm and the caterpillar worm and the baptist and the catholic and all them words eat that faith down to become a denominational stump where there's no seeds left in there but i will restore again saith the lord all the years for all the signs and wonders that they've forsaken i'll take it right back to that original tree again and i will restore it saith the lord that prophet was a vindicated prophet his word has to come to pass amen the holy ghost alone is the revealer of the divine revelation of christ and has been in all ages remember all ages who did the word of the lord come to prophet alone that's right is that right amen and the prophet had to be vindicated first not because he said he was a prophet because he was born a prophet and proved to be a prophet and everything he said was exactly on the word and come to pass then everything else let go see it was the word of the lord came only by the holy ghost the bible said the man of old moved by the holy ghost amen wrote the word look john the baptist would never had known jesus if it hadn't had been for the holy ghost pointing him out that ryan john the baptist that great prophet that come forth and said there's one standing among you right now an ordinary man standing here somewhere that's the lamb of god yeah john said that i bore record i bear record i saw the spirit of god the holy ghost descending from heaven like a dove and it went upon me and a voice said this is my beloved son whom on please what was it the holy ghost that i'll pour him out that's the only way you know him today only way you'll get the threefold revelation of god is for the holy ghost and the only way it can ever be is you're predestinated to see it if it don't you'll never see it if you're not predestinated to see it you'll never see it cause that light confession will go away make fun of it and explain it away for some intellectual conception when the very god himself manifested himself and proven it see but if it ain't up on you to see it you won't see it god never just said i'll choose this one choose that and but he knew by his reasons he could procrastinate because he's infinite and he he knows er he's infinite so therefore he knowed everything he know the ending can tell the end from the beginning he's god we can't do that he's not god yes sir he's infinite all right john would have never known him no sir had the holy ghost not pouring out see how god hides his mystery to the high educated and everything look every one of them people say and simplicity reveals it to whom he has predestinated to see it look here others standing by never even seen the duh they never heard no voice for it was always sent to that predestinated seed predestinated certainly was procrastinated well isaiah 712 years before he was born in the spirit raised up out of these human senses and said there's a voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord all the prophets of the old testament that mainly that great prophet standing at the end of the age he was predestinated certainly he was malcolm i saw him too jesus said if you can receive it this is he who is spoken about sam a messenger before my face malcolm 3 to prepare the way before me see sure he was predestinated to see that message no wonder he could look at her and see that dove coming down that light that was in the wilderness with israel coming moving down the god himself saying this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell in god and man becoming one i bear witness john said i'll be happy the only begotten of the father amen i'm a witness of it amen there you are simplicity with an old preacher his father his father was a great theologian you know he come out of a school looked like he went back to his father's denomination that wouldn't be in the will of god when god touched him at his birth back there and he received the holy ghost three months before he's born yes sir when mary went up there and little john was six months old in his mother's womb and had never done little muscles that never moved yet and mary was afraid the little muscles were growing but she couldn't feel no alive elizabeth his mother other and when mary came up and grabbed her and hugged her put her arms laid hands on her what's up god has spoke to me now i'm going to have a baby too are you and joseph mary no mary how can this be the holy ghost shall overshadow me now be created in me amen and i shall call his name jesus he'll be the son of god and as soon as that word jesus spoke little john began to leap [Applause] the mother of my lord the mother of my lord over my health comes the mother of my lord for as soon as your salutation come into my ears my baby leaped in the womb for joy don't worry he didn't want no seminary something to indoctrinate him or something he had a important job he was a man of the wilderness went out into the wilderness and waited god told him out there so now a reveal to him oh there's your revelation again i'll tell you who he is you're a prophet the words to you you know who you are you've got to come that answers a question from last sunday you know who you are john keep yourself quiet don't say nothing wall out there and when you see this one there'll be a sign coming from heaven like a light a dove will come down that'll be him when you see him that's the reason when jesus walked out in the water john looked already seen that dove coming down he said behold the lamb of god there he is he's the one that'll take away the sin of the world jesus would walk right straight out the water to him and two eyes of john met them two eyes of jesus they were second cousins by flesh mary and elizabeth were first cousins their eyes met one another there was god in his prophet damn man john said i need to be baptized of thee why come now to me jesus said suffer to be so now but remember thus said be who with us to fulfill all righteousness why did john do it because he was the sacrifice john was a prophet he know and the sacrifice has got to be washed before he's presented and and then he baptized him when he lowered the heavens open oh my god that dog come down upon him and the boy said this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell in king james puts it in whom i'm pleased to dwell so it's just the way you won't turn it around same thing dwell in this is my beloved son in whom i am pleased to dwell or to well in either one you want to put it same thing all right we see then it was revealed to him others stand there didn't hear nothing about it the holy ghost alone reveals it same when he reveals himself to paul another predestinated seed that was paul going around he mike said if i get a hold of that bunch i'll turn the pieces because i'm dr saul i'll come up under amelia i'll come to the moody bible or some other one saying i'm a scholar i know what i'm talking about i'll tear that bunch of holy rollers to pieces i'll tell you a great holy father you just give me the permission to go down there and i'll rest every one of them noise makers down there always divine healing stuff we'll stop it put in his pockets at him on the road down that dame about 11 o'clock in the day of a light showed in his face and he fell to the earth why he was a predestinated seed god said i have chose him i'm gonna show him what great things he'll suffer for my name's sake i'll send him to the gentiles and disgrace him in every way that they can be just crazy but yet he'll bear my name paul went down the entry he got all his ecclesiastical stuff cut off of him down the back side of the desert for three years and a half down there in arabia until he learned the word and the word become he and he become a prisoner here he come back in chains of love all my seminary experience is gone i'm a prisoner to jesus christ amen filming my brother i'm a prisoner of jesus christ i only can speak and say what he tells me god needs prisoners today that'll prison yourself to his will to his word that's what paul was for no matter how much intellectual he learned he had known god by revelation the intellectual went all the way out of business and when the revelation come which upon the rock the church is built yes sir notice he was a predestinated seed the holy ghost alone shows you who he is there's no man they'll make you father son and holy ghost and everything else out of it see but the holy ghost will reveal him as a lord god of heaven made manifest that is oh him now i notice not prophets not kings not nothing else but here for the first time god was revealed in christ in the fullness of the godhead bodily in human flesh that's the revelation oh my god sing you a verse now amen nations are breaking israel's awakening are they the signs that the prophets foretold the gentile church nomination their days are numbered with horrors encumbered return o dispersed to your own you're kicked out of them the day of redemption is near man's hearts are failing for fear all their hollywood jokes ain't covering up like a little boy whistling over the graveyard at night be filled with the spirit your lamps trimmed and clear look up your redemption is near false prophets are lying god's word there tonight that jesus the christ is our god that's right this generation spurns god's revelation but we're walking where the apostles have trod the day of redemption is near man's hearts are failing for fear be filled with the spirit you're lamp streamed and clear look up your redemption is near get the revelation brother this generation's spurning god's revelation false prophets are doing that by other fruits you shall know them they're they're hybrid they're bred into our organization instead of the word of god the revelation of god revealing himself through christ who is the word oh my we could stop here but if uh you get again want to come back if you want to guys you want to go ahead that's up here just a little i'll hurry so it's take time enough that you you got some time to rest after this same notice that predestinated seed the holy ghost alone shows you who he is no prophets kings and here god is manifested in flesh here is a fullness he is completely revealed and made known to the world oh my look on mount transfiguration when the testimony of god himself this is my beloved son here i am there stood moses represent the law that's to the elijah representing the prophets but he they passed away and he said this is my beloved son hear him there's three represented there the law of the prophets and mo and christ and he said this is him god fully not manifested in the prophets not manifested by law but manifested in christ he is christ has mercy the law put you in jail but couldn't get you out the prophet says god's justice will condemn you and kill you fart that's right but jesus was god's love and revelation to let no to a predestinated seed that he'd called you this is him hear him no the fullness of godhead is made known this secret of mystery is now revealed that god is manifested god and man become one the anointed man christ what does christ mean the anointed one the anointed that was anointed with the fullness of the godhead bodily oh my how can people doubt it where once partly moses had him partly david had him oh my but here he is manifested in the fullness deity himself standing on earth god in his fullness to die for the sin of the people that he might bring to his church a sanctified life that he might have the premise and fullness in his church to manifest every promise in these last days that he promised for the last days see what was listen now all right uh just pinch yourself a little bit what what was jesus manifested for to show god he was god he had to be no man could die no prophet could die he was god he was the god of the prophets he was a prophet he was a king he was the history he was he that was to come he that was he that is and he just be in this day the same yesterday and forever he was manifested for that purpose and through that purpose he achieved a church that he the fullness of god might bring to pass every promised word of god in these last days when he gets the premise in the church the position his place in the church jesus said he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he also even more than this shall he do for i go to my father see that was his purpose there was a manifestation and now today he wants to get somebody that can so see it that they can let the word see jesus so seen it so we're so perfectly born for the day until god expressed every move that he made he was god's revelation god revealed now he's sanctified with his spirit and blood a church that he might make every promise in this last day be revealed now i see he could go back and pick up what these other fellows has left off here in the last days about his holy spirit reveal all the mystery of the seven seals he's expressing himself that's his purpose that's why he died that's the second fold of his threefold manifestation first you express himself in christ then express himself to the church and the same thing christ was the word and the church becomes a word when it lets the word go through them but when they accept the hybrid denomination how can the word go through it right now and it's grounded and it causes short blows of views but when the current is flowing freely the word of god it expresses itself the works that i do shall yield ye also and in the last days it shall come to pass behold i send you elijah the prophet and he shall turn the hearts of the of the children back to the faith of the fathers and in there there would be a time come forth when he could express himself in fullness of his godhead deity through his church have the preeminences in this church oh my what the anointed man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom anointed by why accepting what eve turned down in adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit anointed with the word what he turned down he comes back and we accept see how that hybrid condition again just exactly what he done eve he told eve don't you do this and don't you do that and you can do this and that and satan said oh you know but she turned around and listened to him but the even the last day is not going to do it because she predestinated not today god's going to do it he knows he'll have he said his spot church should be there without spotter or wrinkle she's gonna stand there in the splendor of him his word made manifest she'll be a token to the world she'll be in the she'll be something to the world the world can look and say well the rest was ah she's a holy roller she's the second cousin she don't belong to our group i know that's a good thing she belongs to this group up here a man said a day to me saying talk he said well what denomination do you belong to i said none what none i said i belong to a kingdom how do you join that you don't join it you're born then what kingdom is that i said the mythical body of jesus christ by one spirit we're baptized into this body born of his spirit and we belong to a kingdom and our lives are not americans we're not germans we're not nothing we're christians we are settled and walk in the spirit our love slave from the things of the world and our rights to the world we sold out and bought this pearl of great price and walked and let the holy spirit manifest itself that's what his real church is that's what you are what i am if we let ourself go and serve god and by his word and not watch some creed says notice the anointed man the christ himself here god has made known but now look but but now why he has the premises god fully manifested in jesus christ god's great secret of his revelation this great light of revelation has always blinded the wisdom of this world in the days of jesus christ when he's here on earth they had blinded and he said well you even make yourself god you make yourself equal with god he was not only equal with god he was god himself see they don't get it by the way some of you might i've heard infidels one time told me that jesus never did say he was the son of god he sure did you certainly did you just don't know your bible what did you say to a woman as well i think what do you tell her i know messiah cometh and when he comes he'll do these things he said i'm he it speaks to you and to paul also in different one notice but now the church has the premise god's great secret has always blinded the wisdom of the world they can't get it they just don't understand it satan don't understand it now the rest of them understands it but just those who are predestinated to understand how god and christ are one they'll make him three every time they certainly will notice next secondly the manifested christ in you the hope of glory that great manifested god in christ now christ manifested in you will hurry look what was once god's great secret great mysterious secret in his mind is now put in the hearts of the believer that is the body of christ what was god's once great secret in his mind before the foundation of the world is now made manifest oh i'm i'm sure we don't we don't get it well i can't see it the way i ought to and i'm sure you don't see but god's great mystery what the eternal god had as a mystery has now been unfolded in jesus christ and give it right down to his church what was once in god's minds now in the body of christ jesus making love to the church's bride whispers secrets to her you know how you tell your wife things you know the little girl you're going to marry you love her so much you just tell her the secrets and get her up next to you and love you and everything you know how it is that's what god christ is doing to the church he's letting to know the secrets just the secret not these flirters i mean he's wise all right now look by having the revelation of a secret made known to them by his grace how the grace of god people i know it i hope you don't think this sounds personal to a bunch of people or this that but the secret that god is sharing with the whole church if they would just receive it it doesn't mean just me or just you it means the church that he he's trying to get into and you say well why don't they receive it they can't receive it he said again he said these things and how could it because isaiah said they can't see him and he's always said the prophet paul said in the last days that people would be heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god truth breakers false accusers incontinent and despisers are those that are good heady high-mindedness having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such eternal way for this is the kind that goes from house to house and leads silly women laying away with divers lust with shorts and bobbed hair and everything else led away with divers lust and say it's all right oh they're crazy out there don't feel see never able to come to the knowledge of the truth and these men resisted into james and james with stood moses able to produce a church and produce a group of people just about only will be made manifest when jesus takes his pride and sets her up here and said this is her and way he goes therefore they will be made known look at having the revelation of this secret made known to them by his grace look when this great revelation revealed mystery is made known to you then you denounce all the things of the world amen now i'm going to come back once again as i was saying i'm pointing to it the tape satan and those that are going across this tape goes across the world see you women that claim you've got the baptism of the holy ghost and not the audacity to let your hair grow out when the bible condemns it and said a woman's a man's got a right to put away his wife in divorce if she bobs her hair honored before god to do so the bible says she cuts her hair she dishonors her hand and it's a common just know what any old common thing is for a woman to even pray with bob there wearing shorts and these slacks and things the bible said any woman that'll or you say it put on a garment that pertains to a man it's an abomination to god filthy dirty like an old stinking bathroom somewhere see oh my the filth in god's nostrils and then you try to pray or offer up prayers and such a thing is that god refuses and turns it away well you say now wait a minute brother brain you're talking about the old testament he's the same yesterday today and forever it's a full revelation of god god ever says anything you can never change it he over magnifies it not changing the law was magnified not changed magnified whosoever commits adultery shall be guilty of death but whosoever now magnified looked upon a woman to lust after her he never changed the commandment he magnified it remember the sabbath day and keep it holy one day in the week now he magnified it oh rest comes from keeping the spirit of god precept upon pre-sipping line up online here a little in there a little whole face that was good for with stammering lips and other tongues will i speak to these people and that is the rest that's a refreshing from the presence of the lord yet they would not hurt and wipe their heads and walk away through their denominations this is a refreshing the magnifying the sabbath day to you sabbatarians and so forth oh my you don't change he magnifies it hell is spreader gates to receive them now you can see now the end time message why it's rejected can you now no denomination but the revelation of his mystery see no denomination the revelation god's not known by denomination he's known by revelation look god in his body christ and christ in his body the bride and god may manifest in christ christ may manifest in the bride and as god took from the body of adam the woman and she fell then god is stuck from the body of christ his flesh his body which is his word is bringing the bride out [Music] i hope every man that hears this tape and every woman will understand that she's a second eve but she's not breaking in and spawning her skirts of purity and holiness to her husband she'll stay with his word regardless of what anybody said you can have all the economical moves you want to and all the affiliations and you're going to bring a persecution on pretty soon and shut up all the churches you see that and churches like this who's not denomination they'll use them for storehouses and if any man goes and offer a prayer for anybody else that don't belong the economical movement be shot on the spot yeah man it's already that lutheran minister of the head of this sense right you're right here in your magazines right don't make any difference what they say that church will stand true enough she's already proved it back on her and she'll do it again in the face of everything it's a word of god and then all the connective movements and everything else be gone she's going to be there without spot or wrinkle right she'll stand there notice god manifested himself in his body christ now you see the threefold beautiful thing christ in his body the church vindicating his promised word like god did through christ who can condemn me a sin if i do not the worst of the father and where about where have i failed now you fellas say that you're doing it your denomination not not show me show me where i feel to be the messiah sure i failed on one sign that god said the messiah do it i haven't fulfilled it he said god in his body now christ the works that i do shall you do all the see the same god the works that i do shall you do also more than this for i go unto my father the church will be a little longer in life see vindicating his promised word as god did his promises in christ's body so is christ doing his same works in christ's body the church see now making his mystery known to his bride tree in the last day bringing forth the fruits that was in the tree at the beginning watch the tree puts forth a branch a lutheran what did it do when the tree started coming up here come the fruit coming up with it what happened they denominated so the pruner come by the father husband and he cut it off it's dead up come the wesleyan you've done fine coming up what did it do the fruit went right back into the tree again so he cut the vine off it did show me one one church i want to know i've got 33 years of church history show me one time one place where any church ever organized that

brought forth denominational fruit lemons on an orange tree so he pruned it all i think brought it for it kept on but where is the heart of the tree right in the middle and he's pruned them all down but right in the top he's got a seed down here the root like a tree that's playing by the rivers of water he takes god's laws and love in his heart and he shall be like a tree psalms one planted by the rivers of water his leaves shall not whether in his season he'll bury his fruit and here it is right and where is the fruit right now quickly and top of the tree why the lights on us amen that's right and right in the top of the tree in this last days he's bringing forth a bride treat now remember he is that tree of life contrary to the serpent seed you see he's that seed the woman seed the tree of life in the garden unless they put forth their hands and move this tree they'd eat that tree and live forever and he's the only tree that can be taken that you live forever his word is life and that's be the lord then the word of god which eve turned down in the garden of eden and here's christ the word made manifest and when he come on earth he was the tree of life do you believe that and rome what did they do he had to be chopped down and he was put on a tree of disgrace cursed his either hang on tree become a curse for the human race and now through that he brings forth a bride
