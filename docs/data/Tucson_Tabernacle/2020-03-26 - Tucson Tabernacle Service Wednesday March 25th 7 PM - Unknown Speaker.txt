[Applause] [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] Oh would you play that just as I am it was so fitting to the song that you girl thing and then to that and it fits just right so I appreciate the goodness of the Lord today how he he comforts you how he strengthens you how he he comes to where you're at you might be going through a hard time and hard struggling but he'll take you just as you are and sometimes when you realize you come to that realization that there's nothing you can do with in it it's the place that me realize that you can let him have preeminence the last song that I heard before I came to service was the love of God and I just had just blessed my heart to see that how things go together in the tortoise beings we do have a couple of prayer requests that we were made aware of so brother had to go I sent me a text today and said he'd be on his way home tomorrow driving back in from work so let's me remember brother had as he's driving in and also my daughter Naomi she yesterday was her last day of work at Pima College as they've closed everything down except for management but they found out that one of their co-workers named Sandra who worked in the cafeteria she's been gone for several weeks if she had gotten sick and all the symptoms that she has looks like the corona virus so some of those workers may have been exposed to that oh we have a mighty God they can take it and do anything that is it would be harmful to us so we don't we don't let that take us and make us full of fear or anything like that if you have a need there wherever your abdomen should be nice to see everybody back here in service but the Lord willing that won't be too far down the road but wherever we are he's the same yesterday today and forever so if you'll raise your hand up if you have a need and just say Lord I accept I believe I'm coming just as I am I'm not I'm not gonna present myself in a way Lord that you would know better but Lord that you've said I could come as I am and you would accept me so let's pray Lord it's just so fitting more to hear those two songs tied in together [Music] we can't even walk without you holding our hands we think we're strong we think we're we're able to Lord and then we're faced with something Lord we don't even know what to do or where to turn but if we'll commit ourselves to you and we will approach you as you said we could more through the shed blood and enter into that holy of holies Lord and let you minister to us today Lord in all the knees Lord you know each one where they're at right now and what that need is Lord father would you go and minister would you would you draw an eye to them Lord for this lady Lord that worked there with my daughter Lord possibly had the coronavirus Lord and those that could be affected around her Lord would you go through Lord and touch each one of them Gordon not only them but wherever Lord in this whole world wherever your children are Lord but to be with each one or do we give you honor well give you glory and we'll give you Prince and Jesus Christ name Amen [Music] also a couple of testimonies that were shared and a thank-you and we prayed for Stephen and Nina and they left yesterday morning go back up to Kansas and they arrived home safely appreciate about 16 hours of driving and all is well and my niece Eunice she sent in a praise her and the girls were in the backyard and they were swinging some golf clubs and Avis swung one or one of the girls swung then as she saw that Avis suddenly held her mouth and went down and looked like she had been hit in the face with a golf club so Eunice went over quickly thinking she'd find a busted lips and broken teeth but there was just a slight mark just a small grace Fork what could have been so she just wanted to thank the Lord also I've heard several testimonies now from the service that when brother Joe Adams was here and he ministered in prayer after the services I've heard some testimonies of the the power of God coming in and meeting some needs and I heard one today they sent it to me to forward it to brother Joe just thanking him and I did that and someone he had prayed for because they had been having just some very dark thoughts and suicidal tendencies and and just depression they said from that day the prayer not a single one again so we praise God for that and I know there were others that the Lord touched in a week we all thank the Lord that he's the same yesterday today and forever so amen do you believe that so appreciate that thank you musicians I just appreciated that just as I am Lord you'll take meal accept meal but you won't leave me as I am I won't go back out torn and broken and downhearted but will be encouraged so thank the Lord for those good things he does for us so this evening we'd like to maybe continue a little bit on what we ministered last Wednesday just taking God at His Word where brother Branham said God's Word defeats Satan every time without fail so we were looking at some of those things and another testimony to and was called brother Matt because he had sent me me and my wife a little devotional book that he said he just felt the Lord impressed one morning send this to brother Aaron sister Rachel so the very next day we received it in the mail because he did exactly what he felt to do and when Nina and Steven got ready to leave and with everything that's going on well the thoughts well are we gonna see them again it's something gonna happen and that was so I was in the in there and my office is also in the bedroom and you know was thing and momma got down to pray before she went to bed and I heard her crying and I said I think I know what this is just thought of possibly that we might not see them again and so when she finished praying I turned to her and I looked and I said was was that part of it and she said yes it was but just a lot of troubling times but she said yep give me that book that brother man said let me let me read to you or let us read what what today's devotional is and there was a I don't know if he'd call it a poem but a five stands a portion that was written there and it talked about the dark cloud in your life and and and the things that you would look at it as a dark cloud but it was a promise of God behind that dark cloud and sometimes you look at that and as as we read through it every one of those answered a question that she had in her heart and III just appreciate the brother Matt followed the leadership with the Lord and it was timely for us so it's the goodness of the Lord he does not leave his sheep alone he stays with them because they're his so let's so let's let's read the first scripture here in second samuel chapter seven verse 22 and i had just written this scripture down a while back and i went back to look at it i'd like to just start here and it says wherefore thou art great o lord god for there is none like thee neither is there any god beside thee according to all that we have heard with our ears so let's just bow our heads lord we thank you that it's not only that we've heard with our ears but we have been privileged to experience and to get to know you personally lord and there is none like You Lord no one else could know about us so intently so deeply so personally like you Lord and therefore be able to minister to us that way and we thank you lord now speak to us Lord let our hearts and our ears be open Lord let us just receive that which we have need of as you know best we ask in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen so again therefore thou art great o Lord our God for there is none like thee neither is there any God besides thee according to all that we have heard with our ears and this with the children of Israel as they were as a Word of God in the the testimonies had been rehearsed to them and reminded and this was their their exclamation or their response there is none like the O Lord so and that's our same the same reaction that we have Lord there is unlike you amen and if we'll go to that first quote there brother Jeremy from the beginning it wasn't so and I had had heard a portion thing and it just this caught my attention so I looked it up and in brother Brahma had been to India and they had all the fences made of stone and all the walls so he describes that but picking it up from here if the little birds had been in there and he's speaking of those stone walls and the homes they'd been killed if the cattle had been standing under these fences that have gotten killed but the holy spirit that worn two cattle the birds to go into the ark to escape the judgment of God the same Holy Spirit drove them cattle those Lyn he send the Holy Ghost in this last days just before the great judgments coming to to send you into Christ to safety the only place that you could be redeemed and resurrected the only place there is salvation in Christ and the Holy Spirit is here tonight trying to bring you and woo you out from the things of the world into himself and you can look at that of the world the worldly thinks or the situations that are around us but he'll draw you to himself he's the same yesterday today and forever and then I had read read another portion and blind bartimaeus and may use this the whole quote here and then just portions of the other court quote here and he says now I if I went out there in the ocean and picked up a spoonful of water now like all the ocean that that's what was in Jesus the fullness of God but what's in me and you is just little spoonfuls he said but if he took that spoonful of water to the laboratory and tested it the same chemicals that were in the spoonful would be what was in the ocean that's right the same kind of chemicals is that right the same Holy Ghost then amen and with your spoonful and my spoonful and their spoonful and all of it put together we can do things for God if we'll just let it flow together it'll bring the presence of God well you said he say well I'm just a little part what good in mind he says if we all get together then again from be not afraid and just the last part the response to what he was talking again the same thing of that spoonful of water but he says but when God on the day of Pentecost when he come down like a rushing wind did you see he was a pillar of fire but you notice he separated himself from the pillar of fire divided himself among his people and cloven tongues of fire set upon each of them God separating himself to his church no wonder he spoke wherever two or three are gathered in my name all be in their midst so that same he's again he's taking that same quality oh that's in the ocean he ties it to a spoonful or the same quality all that God was he poured into Christ and a greater than Solomon is here well then when we think of the Spirit of Christ that we have enough see it's just a spoonful of what was in him see he had all of it in him and that that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ to us he poured into the church so if you have God in you you have everything you have need of and in it it's a it's Christ in you the hope of glory I can't even walk without you holding my hand you realize he becomes our everything and it's it's it's that which all together brother Branham said making that deck of fire and I have heard but now I see the last quote here one day when the lepers were laying all over the country he used his power and put a curse on a tree and began to wither when there was people laying everywhere needing that healing power but you see he wanted to show he's got over everything whether it's small whether it's big whatever it is he's still God over all things all the creation so we love him because that he gives us to know if he's interested to speak the Word of Life into a little insignificant fish laying there dead on the water for a half an hour he's speaking of that when he called gave that little fish back his life he can certainly someday speak life into his children no matter if your body be no more than a spoonful of dust he'll speak and we'll answer him someday he's God who is interested in everything all that we do all that we say everything he's interested and that was reading that myself I said thank you Lord there's not a situation there's not anything going on right now that you're not aware of you're not paying attention to your thing so we appreciate him being that way so as we go into some scriptures here Psalms 119 101 oh five and you read the Book of Psalms and some of the most to me some of those inspiring some of those times that I've gone in and read something from Psalms I'm just maybe needing to hear from the Lord and I just said I'm gonna open the Book of Psalms and I'm gonna begin to read and God will always have something just to encourage just to say hey I'm aware I I know what's going on and and what I like about it too is David was a man just like me he had problems he had issues he had things but God still went ministered to him talk with him walk with him he called him a man after my own heart so David says this in Psalms 119 I have not departed from thy judgments I'm not gotten so caught up on everything that's going around that I've forgotten what you said Lord for thou hast taught me and he said how sweet are they words unto my taste yayyyy sweeter the honey to my mouth we could eat a good meal but I'm gonna need another one after a while but if he have you have the words of life in you you have eternal life in you he says through thy precepts I get understanding therefore I hate every false way through your word david says sooth I presume you know what is true he said though therefore everything even how I feel even how I think even my emotions can be false but God's Word is true he said that's where I hate every false way and sometimes we get frustrated with ourselves we get oh why am I like that but take God at His Word and apply to every situation he says then he says it thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path in a situation right now and you every time you open the news or talk to somebody it seems like every conversation even today and in working in some of the houses listening the conversations and someone would come up and say so what do you think about the situation today and that's got everybody's concern you know you turn on the news everybody's talking about what's happening today and both sides of it and you look at what politics is doing what politicians are doing and each one is trying to use the situation for their good to enhance their standing you know if you elect me I'll do this and you know like if they have any control of it through their through their politics and that's what everybody's doing some are saying doing this and I was thinking about it and they were saying wash your hands and and we should do that I'm not saying to be foolish and not go out and I'll just do anything anyway we should be we should do those things that the the medical field is doing their best as they can but they were talking wash your hands do this and as I was sitting there studying and it's to wash your hands and I started thinking washing me oh Lord cleanse me Lord wash me not only from those things we see the effects of a corona but wash me from every spirit wash me and cleanse me from anything that the after effects or the the what is going to show is going to show the the sickness of it down the road the evil of it cleanse me even of the things that I don't see he says thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path because I must continue on the journey and he said I'll take your word and now we say how could this how could these things happen and come upon a child of God how Lord you know where are you in this and as I was thinking that just just kind of going over some of these things and I thought Lord what about Jobe so I went over to job chapter one and I started reading through there and and when God says have you considered my servant job you know God God had full confidence in job he got new jobs end from the beginning but joke didn't know you know and neither did his friends but God did so listen let's look at chapter 1 will pick up verses 6 through 12 here now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them and the Lord said unto Satan whence cometh thou and Satan answered oh I've been going from to and fro on this earth he said walking up and down all over it and the Lord said I say have you considered my servant job there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man that was the god speaking of job now you and I being around Joe maybe I don't know that we would have described him maybe job's wife wouldn't have described him that way maybe his children would have described that way but God said he is a perfect and upright man one that feareth God and his choose evil he turns his back he does he does not want to participate in evil let's continue on there then Satan answered Lord he said does choke fear thee for not I mean there's a reason why he's that way has not thou made a hedge about him and about his house and I'm glad God does I'm glad as as brother Matt talked about that fire about us and about all that he has on every side so he promises to you and your children in your household Satan is just quoting what God has done for his children he says thou has blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land let's continue on there but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy faith same goes just make it hard on him and he's going to be like the rest of the people they're gonna turn on saying where is God in all this what have I done wrong what did I do and the Lord said unto Satan behold all that he hath is in thy power only upon himself put not forth thine hand so Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord and it just wanted to read that because Satan had to get permission from God he walked around and I know he saw Jobe he knew where Jobe lives he didn't have to ask God okay where's this Jobe guy tell me where was that so I can go after him he knew exactly where to go back to but he had seen the hedge around him he had seen all of that he says I can't get to him God's got him protected God said go so again in job chapter 2 verses 6 & 7 we know the story there of job well how well he was having one of the messengers telling him what had just happened another messenger comes and we know job says naked I was born naked I shall return blessed be the name the Lord so just to save some time we'll jump to job chapter two six and seven and Satan goes back up to to speak to the Lord about Joe because the Satan says well did Joe back here like you said job chapter 2 verses 6 & 7 but put forth thine hand now and touch his bone and his flesh and he will curse thee to thy face Satan tells him now touch him you you've let me touch everything else let me go touch him and the Lord again said unto Satan behold he is in thine hand but save his life again God puts the limits God says you can but you're not going to do this and he has not changed he's the same yesterday but will we go through hard times will we go through troubles and trials yes we do but God has already seen you victorious God has already seen you as an overcomer because to John in the book of Revelation he says now look let's preview let's look at this bride that is adorned for him and brother Branham calls that that many many membered bride and that's meeting you just to show you there that he's a great God as Samuel said and David says thy word is a lamp but Satan can still come and tempt us in this flesh but God never turns his back then Psalms 103 verses 1 through 5 David here and he's and David is speaking out and and as they as a man of God as a man called of God and he's writing these things having no idea that how many years down the road you and I would be sharing these would be reading these would still be receiving the blessing out of it because God's Word is the same yesterday today and forever because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and for him bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless His Holy Name in parentheses when everything's going okay no it says bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless His Holy Name bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowns thee with loving-kindness and tender mercies who satisfies thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like an eagle's these are David's words but not David's words they were inspired by God for David append them for David to sing them for David to say them and to record them so that you and I could say the same thing I will bless thee O Lord with these lips with my actions with everything I say and do I will bless thee O Lord I will give you praise I will give you honor it says and with all that is within me I'll bless His Holy Name and I'll not forgive his benefits because it because of his benefits I am Who I am you know it's not one of those when last what was that the day that we had the lunch here at the church and Elizabeth drover his story in the man hit her car well - they called her and they offered a settlement for the vehicle and and for the bruising of the arm and they told her it's all it's worth is this and this that's all the benefits you have and that was to his insurance and we know that the insurance eight companies there wanna good get as low and payout as little as possible it's how they work but David says here forget not all his benefits their eternal benefits their unlimited benefits you cannot the more you draw from him the more you can receive it's not it's not like that word brother Branham talked about that little mouse and the grains in the Garner's of the grains or the little fish in the ocean no part at all he says who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowns thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies who satisfies of thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like an eagle to me when I read that I remember what brother Branham talked about and he said one of these days somewhere between 19 and 21 years old my youth is renewed there are some days I wake up in the morning it's Oh Lord I'm gonna need some help get out of bed this morning just the parts don't quite do like they used to but I have a promise I do have a promise and that's God's Word Isaiah says in chapter 41 verses 8 and 9 and I chose this too - Lord willing to get to something at the end here but Isaiah 41 8 and 9 but thou Israel art my servant Jacob whom I've chosen the seed of Abraham my friend and we are the spiritual children of Abraham every promise everything is given to his children he says but thou Israel aren't my servant Jacob whom I've chosen the seed of Abraham my friend to whom I have taken from the ends of the earth and called me from the chief men thereof and said unto thee thou art my servant I have chosen thee and have not cast the away now I know Isaiah speaking to Israel he's speaking to Israel at that time but we can take the very promises God and given in fact brother Branham always told us if you're not finding Jesus Christ all the way through the scriptures go back and read it again and you'll see that was the fulfillment he said I've come to fulfill the law and he says that I have chosen thee thou art my servant I will not cast me away isaiah 54:17 he tells them in this in Isaiah 54 no weapon that is formed against the shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against the in judgment thou shalt condemn and we get to think well I'm gonna condemn them you know that's not my heart to condemn somebody but let my life speak of the righteousness of God rather than a condemning spirit but your life full of God let that be what if they choose to know they're not denying you they're denying God but not because you're condemning him but rather let that be the life of God in you this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me saith the Lord and I'm glad it's of him because there are some days that I sure get get upset with myself you know it's just Paul said it this way I find myself doing things that I don't want to do and not doing the things that I should be doing and we hit you know in this life sometimes the day goes long work gets busy you have a lot to do at the end of the day you're tired and you said you know I'd love to just spend and you kneel down and you start falling asleep it happens how and you say but that's okay because he knows the desire of your heart he says righteousness is of me in if it if it came to our goodness and what we were able to perform and what we were able to keep and meet all the statutes and and come down exactly in fact to me that's what what when he said the law they chose law over grace and he said if you want the law here's my law this is the only way you can come and get it and have and talked to me through the law and you can see how it is described down to how many steps to take what you could wear how you could act what you were supposed to do on this day how you were supposed to be if the high priests went in and was missed one step he lost his life that's best before the presence of a righteous God but God desired your fellowship he wanted to meet with you and talk with you and share himself again like he did with Adam and Eve so he says my grace Paul is sufficient for you but we sometimes want to go back to the law and you can't live the law you know I was driving down the road and Annie was talking with my wife and we were talking about you know she looked at that at the speedy City what's your speed limit right now I said I'm going a little bit over the speed limit you know it says 55 I'm doing 58 but that's okay because for the next mile I'll drive at 52 so I'll make up I don't think it works that way doesn't I don't think so the speed limit says 55 but you know sometimes it's okay well I'll do two good deeds to make up for that bad deed no it doesn't it doesn't work that way that is the law oh but he became me so that I through his love could become him he bore the penalty of the law for of us the four of us all of us nothing so here he's saying they chose law over grace they wanted to be like the others now we get over to st. John chapter 14 we'll go from verse 26 to 29 and he says but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you he's talking to his disciples here and there he tells them I must go away I've gotta go these things I've got to do and they're telling them no no you know we had hope we had wanted you to restore the kingdom we thought the Romans would be gone where we would become the sovereign nation you would this is this and he says no I've got to go away because there's a better way than this and you know and you think about that and and and the book of before accident in the Gospels and they record the events before the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and you saw his disciples his followers fall away at one time 70 at another time all of them except for John who was there at the foot of the cross but the rest I mean Peter even denies him the very same one who Jesus has said to him blessed art thou simon barjona for the father has revealed this to you but he denies him he said because the comforter had to come the same one that Isaiah had spoken him behold unto you and he speaks of this comforter well while he was there they were gonna be happy with him and everything but he said I've got a better way he said because and he said when you receive this comforter these things that have I've taught you and have showed you you will remember let's go on he says peace I live with you my peace I give unto you not as a world giveth give I unto you and let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid you know when a heart gets troubled in and when you gets anxious and and you start to think in little things like that come big things which just continue to grow you know it you we talk about him and then when you come back and you you see it you look at Wow that little thing sure became something big in my life and and when the doubts and when the fears get to be in working they draw other spirits to them you know it's amazing because even the Scriptures tell us that a man has been cleaned he's been washed out he's been made clean and those spirits cast out of them they go around and they look for another place to get into and they come back and look to see this house they were comfortable in that house one time they liked that place they had made themselves at home there and they come back to see and he says see if it's still empty so that spirit comes back and he calls that says his friends over and is 7 times worse that little thing suddenly is this big maybe explain it this way to understand you just kind of shaded the truth a little bit to the side and we're probably all guilty of that sometimes it's it's mostly true but we leaned it a little bit to make ourselves look a little better maybe so I wouldn't be so embarrassed or so and then you got to retell it again and now you've got to work with it a little bit more and work with a little bit more and pretty soon this story is nowhere near this story and there's a lot of fixing to do at that point it's like throwing the what is a pillow full of feathers out into the wind go back and try to collect them it is a difficult thing to do he says so he says he says let let let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid this piece that I give with you how does that piece come well he is the Prince of Peace but there is something else - they might that piece comes because he gives us to know what this word of God means so not through somebody else's interpretation is not your idea of it but this is so because you know what he desires what he wants you can do it and there's a peace in doing what God asks you to do there's a joy in that I was able to not as a work but because you love him and you know the fruit of it he says so again let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid and fear can grip a person to do things that is you read that you read things that people have done because of a fear thing and and from people lifting up a car for somebody to come out just in that month things that we normally couldn't do but in that moment but God can do it all the time if we let himself let's go on the last 29 it says verse 29 there and now I have told you before it come to pass that when it come to pass you might believe as you see these promises of God are being fulfilled you can say yes and you can be encouraged and you can be strengthened and you can learn upon each one and say the same God like David did that delivered me from the lion and delivered me from the bear is going to deliver me from you and the next one because in this life we face troubles we face things all the way through but the same God the overcomer in you overcomes every one of them and I like the way he's Paul says this and in Thessalonians chapter 3 verse 5 and the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patient waiting for Christ and as I was looking at that I was looking at some of the other ways it was waiting steadfast not movable not not with every time the wind blows you shift to one side every time you go but waiting steadfast waiting there is it or in a quiet waiting for not an anxious not a worked up not a frustration but in a quiet waiting for Christ where the peace of God is there saying lord I don't see the end I don't see the end of the tunnel or I see the light from a distance but I'm waiting on you knowing that you're taking me there I like the way Paul put that it just spoke to me I said you know the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God o love of God how rich help here how measureless it provided everything that we had to eat him because he loved us now let's go into Romans and this is kind of where I'd like to to bring this thought to Romans we'll look at Romans chapter 10 we know Romans chapter 8 28 probably one of the most quoted scriptures Romans 8:28 I don't I didn't give it to brother Jeremy but I'll just for we know that all things happen for our good and as as to those who are the called and I put my name in there put your name in there to those that are called he says we know that but when we get into Romans 10 Paul opens this and in Romans chapter 10 and Paul is speaking of the children of Israel he goes those who God blinded for your and my sakes so let's go to chapter 10 we'll start with verse 8 so we know how Paul starts as speaking of Israel being blinded and then he comes to say this he said because it's not of circumcision or uncircumcision and he says but what saith the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the Word of Faith which we preach Paul said aplenty it's this Word of God that we're preaching if any angel would come and say something different than this let him be accursed and that still holds that wasn't just in his time of writing that still today if anything if a thought and something in your heart would be contrary this let that be set aside let that be pushed away but rather stand by faith that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God has raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved no is that salvation a one-time thing no it's a continual work of God he redeemed us but he is still working everything out for our good let's go to verse 10 for with a heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto it's it's a part that we play it's our part in this he's telling he he blinded the Jews from this to give us this opportunity and he says with a mouth confession is made unto salvation with what we speak we do or we don't it's not that God's Word doesn't it's how we speak God's Word never fails God's Word is the same yesterday today and forever but if you won't let what we talked about that behold I stand at the door and knock if you'll open the door I'll come in but if you don't open the door he stays on the outside I think was brother Matthew they talked about a little bit went last Sunday when he said they they call for a time of Prayer but no time of repentance Lord saved me from this so I can go on doing what I was doing that's really why I want you to save me for because I want to continue but when a heart turns around and says Lord saved me from this and changed my life so I don't desire that anymore let that be the confession let that change me Oh Lord take this out of my life I don't want to deal with it I don't want to I think do that to me for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed you know as sometimes you know maybe a product has failed you you've you've told somebody you know hey we went over this restaurant and it happened to me and that's when when say my boss he asked me do you know a place where they made good Manila and I said yeah there's this place that I go to and I buy it all the time there so he went and got some and he got home and he said I've never tasted a lousy room I knew them all my life I don't know if what his expectation was or they just made a bad batch so then I tried it one more time we were we were out working together in horror where is a good place to stop and get some DEET I said well there's this little truck over here and I really liked their food so we went over there and we ordered and he ordered what in and then we went we were both going on to a different when he called me back up he says I've never had such a bad burrito in my life he goes to meet I'm going like oh wow I'm never gonna recommend anything to you I guess then you know for me it was good but I'm just saying you know so I was embarrassed to do it now so sometimes he now he hasn't asked me lately where's a good place to eat I think he just goes to where he wants to go now but I'm just saying for the scripture says whoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed you you you have no fear of recommending this to someone else because it doesn't fail I remember this testimony as a young man one of my cousins and they not been raising the Pentecostal church that we were they were raised Catholic because their mother was Catholic and that's how they were raised and and the older the older cousin mark he was my older brothers age he was experimenting started experimenting with with drugs and things and and and when this message came and we were dad had gone over and we're all talking together there and so he makes a comment he says well tell me why smoking is wrong and I knew that you know the different family members had preached to them and and and my uncle used to go to the same church we did but you know my aunt was Catholic and all and it was a difference in the in their up raising and we began to say some of the same things I've heard all those it's bad for my health it's this than the other but tell me why it's wrong but because God had shown us already through the unveiling of God's Word the spirits that caused those things we began to tell him and when I say well i was i was listening as my older brother told him that it's a spirit in you that craves that and it's the first time he says that's the first time i've ever heard anything that makes sense but he didn't accept it but it didn't make sense so it's not that just making this sense but rather receiving it letting it become part of you letting it bring it to its fruit and it will not make you shamed you can say I can recommend this for there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him he has more than enough more than enough let's go on for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved and how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and I stopped though like that without a preacher does that mean every preacher has to stand behind a pulpit I don't think I think the life that we preach every day wherever we're at wherever a situation we're in where we find out I think that put has the ability to reach up more people sometimes sometimes in a church service we might get one or two or three visitors that never heard but most the time in our church service most of us are here are believers but you and you're out there whatever your situation is wherever you're at what is your life preaching is there preaching joy is a preaching happiness is a preaching contentment or is there preaching a self-righteous attitude I'm a Christian therefore you can't be that way I've heard that one before in fact I had to one happen to me the other day my my I I called him my old boss the guy worked for a long time his name is Tony and he sent me a tax he said can we play golf and I said but at this time I can't play so he sent me you know how they put all the little things for cursing on the text you know and I I just texted back to my said decode that please and he says I can't you're a minister not that I okay so did get your attention didn't it because he's my boss or he wasn't my boss who worked many years but I never said those things about them I never treated them wrong but I didn't talk like them I didn't act like them had no desire to and here.his those who hit was his response was I can't say those words because you're a minister and I wouldn't do it now I wish she would act like that to everybody not just me just not use the words but the life you preach the life you live speaks louder so many times than the words that are said now I know the preaching of the word but I'd like to looked at also the life that we live 15 and it's going to versa and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things and I know that is that is part of a ministry but it's also part of a life we have you know somebody could say and I saw it happen at work they would they would do their things they would say their stuff but I hadn't come I said your you're a Christian right can you pray for my daughter can you do this they knew where to go I never treated them wrong I never tried to to insult them or anything but I just wanted to be a Christian in front of them and then they would come to the point that I had one of them asked me if I would do his funeral when he passed away and I said why he says because you'll speak honestly about me because you know me he says you'll be an honest man there he said you won't make up all these stories and make me sound like an angel I said no I know you're not an angel but then neither am i I say and I thought that isn't interesting that somebody would come and say that you will speak the truth and I thank God for that but it's a life lived it's it's a voice preaching not so much behind a pulpit but a life live but yet at the same time how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring good tidings and I'm glad there are ministers that will stand behind the pulpit and do that and tell us and preach and minister the goodness of the Lord but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah said Lord who have believed our report so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word so when the life you minister the words you speak back right into what the Word of God says then faith comes with it and those things that God has said he will do those things that God said he will perform because of faith puts them into action and you know it doesn't say because of your holiness of your righteousness because of how many hours you prayed about how many good deeds you did but rather you had faith because you've heard his word and you've taken at it and I thought about that as I was reading my mind went back to that Centurion that Roman centurion who looked at God at Jesus standing in there and he says my servant is dying and Jesus as well go and he says now wait a minute I understand the authority you have he goes because I have authority I say to one go and they go I say to another one do and they do he said if you'll just speak these spirit sicknesses and all are under your command they're under your authority so just speak and that Centurion turns around and says no he says I have Jesus says I mean says to him I have never seen such a faith he says so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God and his faith that takes a we are the children of Abraham the father of faith and that's what God honors and respects he says and to think about that how a man would faith a man who could take God's Word assist I think about sister Hetty right and brother branham is talking about those those five times of the spoken word and and maybe to us who were raised as Christians or raised in a message church we've been raised around all of this it's it's it's not something that catches us by surprise but imagine those who were raised in the church where they told him those things don't happen anymore and she is she has this tutu where bread bran talks about speaking creation speaking things into life and she says brother branham bat is nothing but the truth and God says give her what she wants because it please God because when job said though God slay me yet I'll trust him God is still looking said job there's gonna be a chapter 38 written and in your book of life Joe isn't there yet but God is already preparing those things there's going to be a chapter in your life where that comes to affect and it should be now it should be daily taking God at His Word and watching God bring it to pass and when you get to that fellowship or that relationship with God we're we're it's it's not let me it's not a surprise it's not a something you got to work up to but it's part of the fellowship what you do all the time it's it's his desire to be with you like your desire is to be with him and it's evident and so that faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God we hear a lot of things a lot of things are being said today over the news over this and you know you get on and you read the news and like I said this the Democrats are pulling this way and the Republicans are pulling this way and this group is doing that and this church is going this way and these people are saying well we don't have to listen to the government you're hearing everything that's going on that doesn't bring faith that can bring fear that can bring nervousness that can bring criticism like I can bring everything else but when you go back Lord what do you say in a time like this what do you have to say about this situation what have you said let me go back if I have to and as our brother spoke I believe it was the brother Tim that said go back to that place where you met him go back and remind yourself that was God that was God that was God and encourage yourself again go back to what the Word of God said I will be with you I'll never leave you I will deliver you I will comfort you I'll be your piece also pry every one of your needs yes Lord you're still the same yesterday today and forever and then you can say like David Lord though I walk through the valley of shadow of death I will fear no evil but I wrought in thy staff they comfort me that's the word of God and that defeats Satan every time every single time because he cannot combat the Word of God the musicians would come if if it was our thoughts we would be in trouble sometimes our thoughts are good and sometimes our thoughts are not very good sometimes our thoughts are full of hope and full of faith and sometimes they're critical but if you take guarded word and say I'll think on these things well what God has said what God has given unto us in this day through a message it has come and we can go back and say what did God and we can look at it and God will speak to us today so amen sheltered safe in the arms of God that is my rants Lord we you said you would never leave us you we would never be left all alone trying to fight through this time through these thoughts through these actions through these ways which said I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world you said you told your disciples I have a better way a comforter she'll come and he told teach you all these things he'll bring them back to your remembrance you said father we just appreciate that today lord help us to be a little more quiet a little more restful a little bit more at peace and take you at your word and let you speak to us Lord not to be so anxious and caught up with the events of the day and the events of time and and everything that they're saying Lord but rather what does God's Word say what is God trying to speak and tell us today more that our spirits be quiet even as you said for us the peace that passes all understanding you even tell us to be still and let and know that you are God Lord let not be better us not be anxious and and disquieted Lord but to be at rest to be still and let you know let us know that you are God we ask it in Jesus Christ's name Amen I heard that the testimony of this song it was written by Dottie Rambo and she couldn't come find the words to the first verse she said you were just coming to Jeremy if you would put the first verse up to that and and she was out at the ocean she's by the beach after a storm and the storm was was washing everything up that it driftwood and stuff all over and she was thinking she said Lord you know why all of this and this is her testimony she said as she was walking she just couldn't find the first to the chorus and she said she felt a hand of touch her shoulder she said I literally felt the five fingers of the hand reach and touch me on the shoulder and these work escape and sometimes they'll combine and he'll meet you touch you in a way that you [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you know to think sheltered safe in the arms of God and as she was giving that testimony you've seen the song and Lord knew I had this song in my heart already for today so I looked it up didn't know who wrote the song is written by Dottie Rambo and as she's singing it she began to sing the last line of their purse and she was saying they're sheltered safe in the arms of God and she began to speak to folks he said your children your mother sheltered safe maybe they're going through something maybe they're going through but you've committed them to the Lord you've given them to God they're sheltered in that comforted me to to realize that the Lord is mindful sometimes we look at situations and our families and in friends maybe our children or our brother or sister or maybe a husband wife a mother father and wondering why alone they're given over to God we've committed to the Lord and though job was going through all of what Joe was going he was still sheltered safe in the arms of God because God watches over him so let the storm treat you so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah [Music] he's worth all the gold every precious thing he's worth there was one more song the name of the Lord is a strong to a reminder of the Bible study tomorrow and brother Jordan can give you that information or if you have the whatsapp [Music] righteous [Music] [Applause] [Music] so we'll meet together again Sunday morning at 10:00 or unwilling brother Matt will be speaking and trusting this time that maybe run a little smoother but if you didn't hear it and you can get on neither the whatsapp or the Facebook you can go back and listen to what he ministered Sunday morning it so much of the gaps in the space and they're covered in so we'll get together and worship the Lord trusting this so we'll be able to gather together as we go the name of [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]
