[0:00] [Applause]
[0:05] [Music]
[0:13] How I
[0:14] long to breathe the air of heaven
[0:20] when pain is
[0:22] gone and mercy fills the streets
[0:26] [Music]
[0:28] to look upon
[0:31] The one who pled to save me
[0:35] and walk with him
[0:38] for all eternity.
[0:41] [Music]
[0:46] Oh, there will be a day when all will
[0:50] bow before him.
[0:53] There will be a day when death shall be
[0:58] no more.
[1:01] Standing face to face with he who died
[1:06] and rose again.
[1:11] Holy, holy is the Lord.
[1:16] and every
[1:18] prayer we prayed in
[1:22] desperation. The songs of faith we sang
[1:27] through doubt and fear.
[1:31] In the
[1:32] end, we'll see that it was worth it when
[1:38] he
[1:39] returns to wipe away our tears.
[1:47] Oh, there will be a day when all bow
[1:52] before him. There will be a day when
[1:58] death will be no more.
[2:01] Standing face to face with he who died
[2:06] and rose again.
[2:11] Holy, holy is the
[2:15] Lord. And on that
[2:18] day we join the
[2:20] [Music]
[2:22] resurrection and stand
[2:25] beside the heroes of the faith.
[2:29] [Music]
[2:31] With one
[2:32] voice, a thousand generations
[2:38] sing worthy is the lamb who was slain.
[2:48] And on that day we joined the
[2:51] resurrection.
[2:55] Stand
[2:56] beside the heroes of the faith.
[3:02] With one voice a thousand generations
[3:09] sing worthy is the lamb who was
[3:15] slain
[3:16] forever he shall reign.
[3:21] [Music]
[3:23] So let it be today. We shout the hymn of
[3:29] heaven with angels and the saints. We
[3:33] praise a mighty
[3:36] roar. Glory to our God who gave us life
[3:41] beyond the
[3:44] grave.
[3:46] Holy, holy is the Lord.
[3:50] So let it be your day. We shout the hymn
[3:54] of heaven with angels and the saints. We
[4:00] raise a mighty
[4:02] roar. Glory to our God who gave us life
[4:08] beyond the
[4:10] grave.
[4:12] Holy, holy is the Lord.
[4:18] Holy, holy is the
[4:23] Lord.
[4:25] Holy, holy is the
[4:31] [Applause]
[4:36] Lord. Lord, let's all stand to our feet
[4:39] as brother Ryan gets ready to come.
[4:40] Let's sing hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[4:43] Hallelujah means God be praised.
[4:46] Hallelujah. God be praised. When you're
[4:48] saying hallelujah, it's not just a empty
[4:51] word. It means God be praised. Let's say
[4:53] that to him just for a few moments as
[4:55] brother Ryan gets ready to come and
[4:56] create a create a good atmosphere.
[4:58] There's a good atmosphere here this
[5:00] morning.
[5:02] [Music]
[5:05] Hallelu. God be
[5:07] praised. Oh hallelujah.
[5:13] [Music]
[5:21] Hallelujah.
[5:22] [Music]
[5:27] Hallelujah.

[7:21] Hallelu. Hallelu.
[7:23] [Music]
[7:33] Hallelujah.
[7:36] [Music]
[7:39] Hallelujah. Then sings my soul,
[7:44] [Music]
[7:46] my
[7:47] Savior
[7:49] God to thee.
[7:52] [Music]
[7:55] How great thou
[8:01] are. How great thou
[8:06] [Music]
[8:08] are. Then sings my
[8:13] soul, my
[8:16] savior God to thee.
[8:20] [Music]
[8:23] How great thou thou
[8:28] are. How
[8:31] great thou are. Let's just bow our heads
[8:35] as they continue to play that. And we
[8:37] just want to approach the throne this
[8:39] morning,
[8:40] Lord. We love you, Father. And
[8:43] we, Lord, just even words to songs,
[8:46] Lord, just don't quite say what we feel
[8:48] about you, Lord. And maybe they're the
[8:51] closest that we could come in in words,
[8:53] Lord. But I pray that you would see the
[8:54] heart, Lord, behind these songs, Lord.
[8:56] And Lord, the heart of the the believer,
[8:59] Lord, that just wants to yield their
[9:00] life to you, Lord, and to turn
[9:02] everything over to you. I believe that's
[9:03] what you want this morning,
[9:05] Lord. Praise and worship, Lord. I mean,
[9:08] I know that they mean something to you,
[9:10] Lord, but Lord, a surrendered heart. I
[9:11] don't know if there's anything that you
[9:13] want more than that. And Father, I want
[9:15] to surrender my heart this morning,
[9:16] Lord. I pray that there's many in here,
[9:19] Lord, maybe every person, Lord, that no
[9:21] matter what we came into the building
[9:23] with, Lord, distracted in our hearts and
[9:25] in our minds, Lord, or what we're
[9:26] thinking about, I pray that we would
[9:28] just turn that over to you right now,
[9:30] Lord. And Lord, maybe just by a lifted
[9:33] hand, Lord, with eyes closed, Lord, just
[9:35] saying, "Lord, I surrender to you this
[9:37] morning, Lord. Lord, I give you my heart
[9:39] this morning." Maybe I've held back a
[9:41] little bit. Maybe, Lord, I I think I've
[9:43] given it to you, but Lord, I want to
[9:44] fully surrender to you this morning,
[9:46] Lord. I think Lord, if we could all do
[9:47] that, Lord, if we could all just get
[9:49] into one place, Lord, where you could
[9:51] just start to move among the people,
[9:52] Lord, and move in their lives and move
[9:54] in their hearts, I believe we would see
[9:56] genuine change, Lord. I believe that we
[9:58] would see lives transformed, Lord. I
[10:01] believe we would just have such an
[10:02] anchor, Lord, in the word of God that
[10:05] though the storms would come as as many
[10:07] songs sing about, Lord, we would not be
[10:09] shaken, Lord. That anchor would hold,
[10:11] Father. And I pray you would do that for
[10:13] me this morning, Lord. And I pray you
[10:15] would do that for every heart, Lord,
[10:16] that's hungry for you this morning.
[10:18] Lord, your word has said it that if
[10:20] we're hungry and we thirst after you,
[10:22] after righteousness, Lord, we will be
[10:24] filled,
[10:25] Lord. Let us not be satisfied, Lord,
[10:29] with yesterday's
[10:31] word, yesterday's
[10:33] preaching, last week's Lord, presence.
[10:36] Lord, may we have something fresh and
[10:38] new from you this morning, Lord.
[10:40] Lord, mana is good, Lord, but it's only
[10:42] good, Lord, when it's fresh, Father. And
[10:45] would you just have a special portion
[10:47] for us this morning, Lord, that Lord, we
[10:49] could just enjoy you new this morning,
[10:52] Lord. Lord, not having to live off an
[10:54] experience, Lord, of long ago or last
[10:57] week, Lord, or 10 years ago, but a new
[10:59] experience with you this morning, Lord.
[11:02] I pray that for myself. I pray that for
[11:04] my brothers and my sisters that are here
[11:05] this morning, Lord. And Lord, we feel
[11:07] your presence, Lord. I I I pray, Lord,
[11:09] we've made you welcome, Lord, with our
[11:12] worship, Lord, and our hearts. And if
[11:14] you're welcome, Lord, would you come and
[11:15] talk to us this morning, Lord? We just
[11:18] trust in you, Lord. We just want to turn
[11:19] our our minds over to you this morning,
[11:22] Lord, right
[11:23] now. And Lord, may you just come and
[11:25] speak to us out of your word, Father, in
[11:27] Jesus name we pray. Amen. God bless you
[11:29] this morning.
[11:31] and just have
[11:34] a just have a different feeling this
[11:36] morning even than when I came in. It
[11:38] just uh such a gratefulness to the Lord
[11:41] for his presence this morning.
[11:44] And I just feel a little softness
[11:48] that comes when he comes in the
[11:52] building. And I just appreciate those
[11:54] specials that we're saying. I appreciate
[11:56] the the brothers and sisters
[11:59] that dedicate their hearts in the
[12:02] morning to playing an instrument or
[12:03] singing a song. And I I appreciate the
[12:05] praise from the people this morning. I
[12:07] appreciate our the pastor here, Brother
[12:09] Dan. Just
[12:10] a somebody I just not I just can't think
[12:13] of anybody else I'd rather just lock
[12:14] arms with and be next to than precious
[12:17] brother Dan. Yesterday was a blessing
[12:19] and and just a real blessing for me. Uh,
[12:21] I don't know about anybody else, but it
[12:23] was it was a blessing for me to be there
[12:24] with him and just I I just see the Lord
[12:27] moving like I've never seen him move
[12:29] before. I've seen him move many times,
[12:31] but I've I'm just seeing something
[12:33] different. I've seen uh, you know, we we
[12:36] preach about and and talk about and read
[12:38] about in the Bible about unity, but when
[12:40] you start to see it really happen, it's
[12:43] uh, it's something to behold. And I I
[12:45] think it's going to be even so much
[12:46] better than I imagined it's going to be.
[12:48] And it's just not a unification of the
[12:49] ministry, but I see a unifying of the
[12:52] people of the of the the people that
[12:54] really matter, which is you. Amen. You
[12:57] know, the ministers are they have their
[12:59] place. But you know who really matters
[13:01] is you, right? Amen. I don't know if you
[13:04] feel that. I don't know if sometimes you
[13:06] you know that God cares so much about
[13:08] you that he actually puts ministers in
[13:11] in places, but they're there to protect
[13:13] you. They're there to feed you. They're
[13:15] there to serve you because you are
[13:16] really his prized possession. You know
[13:19] what has more value, the the sheep or
[13:21] the shepherd? The sheep are so valuable
[13:24] that he that the owner of the sheep
[13:26] employs a shepherd to take care of them,
[13:29] to watch over them, to keep them safe,
[13:30] because the sheep are his prized
[13:33] possession. And that's what you are this
[13:35] morning. And I I don't know if maybe I
[13:37] don't know when the last time you knew
[13:38] that about the Lord and how he feels
[13:40] about you. Maybe you already know it,
[13:41] but if you don't know it, I want to tell
[13:42] you it this morning that you're
[13:44] valuable.
[13:47] You're so valuable that he he he he
[13:49] values higher than the blood of his own
[13:51] son.
[13:53] Because that's what he paid for you.
[13:55] Wow. True. Amen. And I think that if we
[13:58] just remember that, you know, it's
[13:59] really easy to forget that sometimes
[14:02] because the world just wants to devalue
[14:04] you and the world wants to tell you that
[14:06] there's nothing about you that's unique.
[14:08] And you know what? You're just like
[14:09] everybody else. And even in the church
[14:11] world, well, you're just another you're
[14:13] just another person that a convert to
[14:15] another religion. No, you're something
[14:16] special.
[14:18] You're a prized possession of the one
[14:20] who created everything that we see.
[14:22] Amen. And and I think that if we just
[14:25] get a hold of something like that this
[14:26] morning, I believe that we would see the
[14:29] bigger picture of what God's trying to
[14:30] do for us. Amen. And um I I'm sorry I
[14:32] didn't plan on saying anything like
[14:34] that. I just want to surrender to the
[14:35] Lord this morning. And um I don't really
[14:38] have much to talk to you about. I know I
[14:40] make the little ones real happy when I
[14:42] tell them I don't have
[14:44] much. Uh maybe some of the older ones,
[14:47] too. But you know, especially the little
[14:48] ones, they they think, "Well, I'm I'm
[14:50] going to get out a little bit early."
[14:51] And so if that makes them happy, amen.
[14:53] You know, maybe they'll we'll get to
[14:54] leave a little happy. I just it just the
[14:56] Lord is so good. And and those words are
[15:00] just so they're so feeble there. They
[15:01] just don't say it. But the Lord is so
[15:03] good that he that he has you here in
[15:06] this building this morning. You know,
[15:08] you could be a hundred different places
[15:10] and none of them good.
[15:12] But he's got you in a place this morning
[15:14] where he wants to come and communion you
[15:16] with you this morning. He wants to come
[15:17] and speak. I'm not speaking to you. I
[15:20] have nothing to say that would help you,
[15:22] but the Lord wants to talk lip to ear to
[15:24] you this morning.
[15:26] And it's there if you want to receive
[15:28] it. Amen. Let's just read a scripture. I
[15:29] know you've been standing and um I'm
[15:31] just kind of waiting on the Lord and
[15:33] waiting to make sure that he is is uh
[15:36] given a direction.
[15:38] Amen. Let's just read out of Revelations
[15:40] chapter 3.
[15:42] And I didn't even plan on speaking on
[15:45] this and and last night real late I just
[15:49] I just felt a little nudge from the
[15:52] Lord. And I I know good enough to follow
[15:54] that nudge, Brother Dan. And you just
[15:56] follow that direction. You don't know
[15:57] where it's going to go. You don't know
[15:58] where it's going to lead. You don't even
[15:59] know who it's going to help. And maybe
[16:01] in my mind as a as just a common man, I
[16:03] think I don't know who needs to hear
[16:05] this. But the Lord knows who needs to
[16:07] hear it. And the Lord's going to take it
[16:09] and he's going to he's going to break it
[16:11] down and he's going to impart it to
[16:12] somebody in a way that is only he can do
[16:15] it. Now, you have to decide, am I going
[16:17] to be that
[16:19] somebody? You know, God won't force feed
[16:21] you his
[16:23] word. You got to be willing. You got to
[16:25] be open. You got to accept what his word
[16:27] is. Amen. Let's just read a scripture in
[16:28] Revelations
[16:29] 3:19. I love this. It says, uh, "As many
[16:33] as I love, I rebuke and chasen.
[16:42] Be zealous, therefore, and repent. Amen.
[16:45] You may be
[16:47] seated. I don't know if you've heard
[16:49] this scripture before. I'm sure you
[16:54] have. I heard this scripture a lot
[16:57] growing up. And every time I heard this
[17:01] scripture, and no no disrespect to the
[17:03] to the men that that were repeating, I I
[17:05] just want to just can I just talk to you
[17:06] from my heart? this morning and just
[17:08] real I just want to be real. I'm not I'm
[17:09] not a minister. I'm not a preacher. I
[17:11] just I could just talk to you about what
[17:12] the Lord's done for me. Every time I
[17:14] heard this scripture, it was always used
[17:17] as a
[17:18] club. It was always used as a as almost
[17:22] a a tool of fear.
[17:25] you know that that if you did
[17:28] wrong that the Lord was going to come
[17:30] and rebuke you and he was going to
[17:31] chasen you and and that the love of
[17:34] God and I know there's there's many
[17:36] places that that say this that that that
[17:39] love is corrective and I believe that
[17:40] love is corrective. I believe if you
[17:42] have a child, how many have children in
[17:44] here? Okay, you don't want to see your
[17:46] little child run towards the street and
[17:48] run towards traffic and you don't want
[17:50] to see them put their hand on a hot
[17:51] stove or pick up a sharp knife and run
[17:53] around with it. Amen. I know we don't
[17:55] want them to do that. And maybe after
[17:56] you tell them a few times, you go,
[17:58] "Look, I I don't want you to touch
[17:59] that." And so maybe I'm I'm going to
[18:01] smack your hand a little bit when you
[18:03] reach for that stove. So that you
[18:04] associate that thing with with a little
[18:07] bit of
[18:08] constructive correction. Does that make
[18:10] sense? And you know, there's nothing
[18:13] wrong with
[18:14] that, but if we do it out of love, then
[18:18] that's what makes it uh the correct
[18:19] thing. And and this is so simple. I
[18:21] don't think that this should really fly
[18:22] over the heads of anybody. And you know,
[18:25] the Lord is just so corrective, but he
[18:27] does it he doesn't even do it the way
[18:29] that we do it a lot of times. You know,
[18:31] a lot of times I I would punish my kids
[18:33] out of anger. Lord, forgive me. I'd
[18:34] punish them out of anger. And you know,
[18:36] I don't know if the Lord has ever done
[18:38] that to me.
[18:45] The thing is, I think that the Lord has
[18:46] had plenty of reason to do it.
[18:50] I it's not because I haven't angered the
[18:52] Lord.
[18:55] But he's so much greater than me and so
[18:57] much greater than the way we do things
[18:59] that I've never I've never felt the
[19:03] anger of the Lord against me when he's
[19:05] corrected me. I've I've always felt his
[19:08] love.
[19:09] And that doesn't mean the correction was
[19:11] easy, brother Aaron. It didn't mean it
[19:13] was just this nice soft gentle thing.
[19:15] Sometimes it was a smack on the hand
[19:17] spiritually.
[19:19] maybe even physically,
[19:22] but I've never felt the anger of the
[19:24] Lord. And that doesn't mean it's not
[19:25] there. It doesn't all through the Bible
[19:26] is the Lord getting angry with his
[19:28] people and maybe allowing something to
[19:30] happen to him, but it's never without
[19:33] love at the end of it. Even when he's
[19:36] the children of Israel, again, I don't
[19:38] have any as my notes, so we're just
[19:39] going to go with what the Lord wants to
[19:41] say this morning. But even the children
[19:42] of Israel when they would turn their
[19:44] back on him over and over and over again
[19:46] and turn to the world and turn to
[19:48] Babylon and turn to Egypt and turn to
[19:50] the spoils and maybe a material and
[19:52] today we could say that's material goods
[19:55] or maybe we could say that's our our job
[19:57] or our life outside of the church is
[20:00] sometimes we turn towards those things
[20:02] instead of God. And when the children of
[20:03] Israel did this over and over again, you
[20:05] know, the Lord would would allow maybe
[20:07] an army to come in and conquer them, you
[20:10] know, and and he did it out of love.
[20:12] Even though when we read the Bible, it's
[20:14] so harsh, you know, but he did it out of
[20:16] love. But then I I would see that and
[20:18] you know, when I read through some of
[20:19] those books, it hurts to to see what
[20:22] Israel went through. And of course, I'm
[20:24] looking at it from hindsight and I
[20:25] think, well, why wouldn't you just do
[20:26] what God
[20:27] said? Why wouldn't you just I mean, look
[20:30] what he's brought you to. He's brought
[20:31] you to a land. Why would you just enjoy
[20:33] the land? But that's where I'm at today.
[20:36] All the places that God has brought me
[20:38] through and where he's brought me to and
[20:40] how he feeds me and how he nourishes me.
[20:44] And yet sometimes I still feel see
[20:46] myself looking towards something that's
[20:47] not God. So I can't really judge Israel
[20:51] too harshly. Neither should we judge him
[20:53] too harshly. I think we do sometimes the
[20:55] same thing. And I I would see the anger
[20:56] of the Lord would say it's kindled
[20:58] against them. and he would allow an army
[21:01] to come in and he would allow them to be
[21:02] conquered. But if you if you read
[21:04] through those those scriptures, there's
[21:06] a lot more to it than that. You know,
[21:08] always when they're they're they're
[21:09] they're maybe enslaved to another uh
[21:12] army, they're enslaved to another
[21:13] country, and they're certainly getting
[21:16] what they
[21:17] deserved. And then I I see the
[21:20] compassion of the
[21:21] Lord rise
[21:24] up. And this people, his people, now you
[21:28] got to apply this to yourself or not
[21:30] this morning, that he allowed to be
[21:34] corrected. All of a sudden, he would
[21:36] rescue them out of the correction that
[21:39] he brought him in. He would say, you
[21:41] know, if one of my favorite scriptures,
[21:44] I believe it's in Ezekiel, he would say,
[21:45] you know, I've allowed you to be
[21:47] conquered. I've allowed you to be
[21:48] punished. I've allowed you to be
[21:50] corrected because of you wouldn't you
[21:52] wouldn't listen to me. You wouldn't do
[21:54] what I was telling to you. So, I've
[21:56] allowed you to become slaves of this
[21:58] other country, but if you will just turn
[22:01] and look at me. Amen.
[22:04] And it was so powerful. He didn't say,
[22:07] "I need you
[22:08] to talk about all the things that you've
[22:11] done
[22:14] wrong." He didn't say, "I need you to to
[22:17] take a a whip and just start beating
[22:19] yourself up.
[22:22] You need to you need to tell me all that
[22:24] you've done wrong. He knows what you've
[22:26] done wrong.
[22:29] And sometimes I think repentance becomes
[22:32] so hard because we we make it
[22:36] hard. We make it into something that's
[22:39] so daunting of a
[22:41] task that it becomes impossible in our
[22:44] mind to fully repent. And so we just put
[22:46] it on the shelf sometimes. That's right.
[22:48] Well, Lord, how could I know all the
[22:50] things that I've done wrong to you? Man,
[22:52] repenting I sometimes I've walked away
[22:54] from repenting feeling like I didn't
[22:56] really do it right. And then when you
[22:59] feel like you don't do it right, you
[23:00] feel like the Lord didn't hear it and
[23:02] accept it. But in the Bible, he would
[23:04] tell Israel when they're, "Oh man, you
[23:06] read about some of the stuff they do."
[23:08] Brother Aaron, it was it was I think a
[23:10] lot worse than sometimes what we do. But
[23:12] if you translate it today, maybe it's
[23:14] the same thing. Idol worship. Certainly,
[23:16] we have some idols, right? We don't
[23:18] nobody nobody carries around an idol
[23:19] with them, right? We have some idols and
[23:23] other things can become idols. I've made
[23:25] work an idol. I've made I've made my own
[23:27] opinion an idol. I've made my own will
[23:31] an idol. Something that I put before
[23:33] God. And and and certainly you see the
[23:35] things that Israel did and it just like
[23:37] wow I can't believe they would do that
[23:38] to God. And he didn't ask them to go and
[23:40] make all that stuff right. You know what
[23:42] he said? If you will just turn and look
[23:44] at me.
[23:48] I'll he says, "I'll wipe away
[23:52] every wrong that you've done." He says
[23:55] this. He says, "If you'll turn and just
[23:57] look towards me, I'll
[24:00] restore all the years that you lost
[24:05] when you weren't obeying me." He even
[24:08] says, "I'll wipe away the wrinkles and
[24:11] make you young again."
[24:14] And I think about the grace of God in
[24:16] that that he didn't
[24:19] require
[24:22] penance. He didn't require that you beat
[24:25] yourself up.
[24:27] He didn't require that you just think of
[24:30] yourself as the lowest thing.
[24:34] And he didn't require that you do
[24:35] anything because at the end of the day,
[24:37] brothers and sisters, we can't do
[24:39] anything
[24:40] to save oursel. We can't do anything to
[24:42] cleanse oursel. We can't do anything to
[24:44] atone for our own sin. He says, "If
[24:47] you'll just turn and look at
[24:52] me, as many as I love, I rebuke and
[24:55] chasen. Be zealous, therefore, and
[24:57] repent." And the scripture was always,
[24:59] it was used, at least in my life. I
[25:01] can't I can't speak for you, but just
[25:03] maybe the maybe it was the kind of
[25:04] people I was around. It was uh you know,
[25:07] this rebuke and chasing. It was this
[25:08] punishment. And it was this, well,
[25:10] you're going to get a good weapon from
[25:11] God. And it was used as a fear tool to
[25:13] keep me in line. And I heard a brother
[25:15] say this uh just a week or so ago. And
[25:17] it just struck me. He said, you know,
[25:19] rules without a relationship is
[25:20] dangerous.
[25:23] And it just, man, it struck me so like I
[25:26] hadn't put it together quite like that.
[25:27] He said, "Rules without a relationship,
[25:29] it's dangerous. You know, you can come
[25:31] to church and you can read the Bible and
[25:33] you can hear a message preached and you
[25:35] can even fellowship with each other. And
[25:37] if there's a lot of rules put out there,
[25:38] well, you know, you shouldn't be doing
[25:40] this. You know, and a real Christian,
[25:42] they won't dress this way, look this
[25:43] way, talk this way, they won't do these
[25:45] things. And you know, there's truth to
[25:47] that. It's in the Bible. But if you just
[25:49] have those rules without a relationship
[25:51] with God, you won't be able to live by
[25:53] those rules. And then those rules
[25:56] condemn you. And then because you don't
[25:58] have that relationship with God, those
[25:59] rules actually push you out of a
[26:02] relationship with God. and they push you
[26:03] right back into the world because you
[26:05] don't feel worthy to have the
[26:07] relationship because you're trying to
[26:08] have it and I'm trying to have it by
[26:10] rules. When if you get the relationship
[26:13] with God first, the rules become
[26:16] something that you want to do for God
[26:20] rather than try to do the rules to make
[26:22] uh yourself presentable to God. That's
[26:25] not what he wants. He wants you like you
[26:28] are so that he can make you into what he
[26:31] wants.
[26:32] He doesn't want you to make yourself
[26:34] into something you think he wants.
[26:36] That's not what God wants. And I know
[26:37] this is just so baseline. It's so
[26:39] simple, but I think I've missed him so
[26:42] many times because I'm trying to be
[26:46] something and he doesn't want me to be
[26:48] that.
[26:50] He says, "If you'll just turn and look
[26:53] at me."
[26:58] To rebuke. Now, I don't know. Do you
[27:00] have an idea in your mind what rebuke
[27:02] means? Anybody? You got Do you have an
[27:05] idea in your mind what rebuke means? In
[27:07] my mind, if I didn't read the
[27:08] definition, Brother Dan, sounds really
[27:10] harsh, right? A rebuke. Those that I
[27:13] love, I
[27:15] rebuke. But the definition of the word
[27:17] is those that I love, I convince them.
[27:24] Changes it, doesn't it? Yes. Doesn't
[27:26] feel so much like a hammer
[27:29] that the minister uses to beat you into
[27:33] submission. Now, you better watch what
[27:34] you do because the Lord's going to
[27:36] rebuke
[27:37] you. It says, "Those that I love, I
[27:42] convict. Not condemn. I
[27:46] convict. Those that I love, I tell them
[27:49] about their fault."
[27:52] And the last definition is those that I
[27:54] love I
[27:56] admonish. You see how the Lord does
[27:58] things so much different than we do
[28:00] them. And chasing. Well, chasing sounds
[28:03] pretty bad. At least when I was growing
[28:05] up, chasing was pretty bad. I don't
[28:08] know. I don't know where you grow up the
[28:09] definition of that word, but for me,
[28:11] that meant brother Aaron a
[28:15] spanking, a
[28:16] beating. I not necessarily physically,
[28:19] although there were some of those, but I
[28:20] I deserved them. But those that I love,
[28:24] I chasen. You know what it means? I
[28:26] educate them.
[28:30] Those that I love, I teach them. Amen.
[28:35] Those that I love, I train them up like
[28:38] I would a child. That's what that word
[28:40] means.
[28:42] Does that mean that the Lord is is
[28:44] wishy-washy? No, it doesn't mean that.
[28:47] You know, if if if if I keep putting my
[28:50] hand on the stove, now let's just take
[28:52] that and you could say whatever thing
[28:53] that you're tempted with, whatever thing
[28:55] you struggle with is the stove. If I
[28:57] keep putting my hand towards the stove,
[28:59] and the Lord says, "Don't do that. Don't
[29:01] do that. Don't do that. Listen, this is
[29:03] why you shouldn't do that. This, let me
[29:04] teach you. Let me convince you. Let me
[29:06] convict you a little bit." And I keep
[29:07] doing it. You know what? He might have
[29:09] to go, "Look, don't put your hand on
[29:11] that stove."
[29:13] You know, the Lord is so he has such a a
[29:16] large view picture of our lives that he
[29:18] might go, "Look, I don't want you to
[29:20] touch that
[29:21] stove." But if the only way you're going
[29:23] to find out is to touch that stove, I
[29:25] might let you touch that stove. And then
[29:26] I'm going to I'm going to take you and
[29:28] I'm going to hold you and I'm going to
[29:30] say, "I know that burns. I know that
[29:32] hurts. Let me soothe that for you." You
[29:34] see what happens when you don't listen
[29:36] to me? That's so true. And I've he's
[29:38] done it so many times in my life
[29:42] that I've just come to love him for it.
[29:46] And I hope, brothers and sisters, I I I
[29:48] I haven't even read a note yet, brother
[29:51] Dan, because I'm just going to lean on
[29:53] the Lord. I really hope that you never
[29:55] get to the
[29:56] point that you never get too
[30:00] mature that God can't correct you and
[30:05] then take you aside and hold you. Amen.
[30:07] And hold that thing that he had to
[30:09] correct in your hand. And look, I'm
[30:10] sorry that you burnt your hand. I'm
[30:11] sorry that you did that, but I'm here
[30:13] for you. I hope that you don't get too
[30:16] mature and too old and too seasoned and
[30:18] too veteran in the word or in church
[30:21] that God still can't bring a little
[30:25] correction. Psalms says this. I want to
[30:27] read a different scripture if that's
[30:29] okay. Um, two places in Psalms.
[30:34] I didn't think I was gonna be that long,
[30:36] brother Dan. But I already started
[30:37] talking more than my notes were. So,
[30:39] sorry little guys. Sorry little ones.
[30:41] But it was it was we were close. We
[30:45] almost got out early. Psalms
[30:49] 51:17. Um, if you want to mark it down,
[30:51] if you want to read it, Psalms 51:17.
[30:53] And this is what I really well had on my
[30:55] on my heart to talk about. So, we'll see
[30:57] if the Lord wants to go that direction.
[30:58] The sacrifices of God are a broken
[31:01] spirit and a broken and contrite heart.
[31:04] Oh God, thou wilt not despise.
[31:10] Psalms 34:18 says something similar. It
[31:13] says, "The Lord is nigh." That means the
[31:15] Lord is near. How many wants the Lord to
[31:17] be near? Oh, I Okay, that was good. I
[31:20] love that. The Lord is near unto them
[31:24] that are of a broken heart,
[31:27] and saveth such as be of a contrite
[31:29] spirit. I love the Lord because that's
[31:32] who he wants to be close to.
[31:36] Oh, no. He's close to you the stronger
[31:39] that you
[31:40] get.
[31:41] No, he's close to you the more broken
[31:44] that you get.
[31:49] If you're not broken, you don't have
[31:51] room for him.
[31:53] You don't have a need for him if you're
[31:55] not broken.
[31:57] And you might think, well, you know,
[31:58] brother, this sounds like a message for
[32:00] for a new convert. And it
[32:03] is. But if if we're not, this is also a
[32:07] message for
[32:09] anybody who really wants a closer walk
[32:11] with God.
[32:13] And you know, I think that I I think
[32:15] that over the year I'm not that old and
[32:17] I'm not that young. I'm kind of in that
[32:18] middle, that weird awkward middle where
[32:21] I think I'm old until I meet, you know,
[32:24] an elder and they're like, "You're not
[32:25] old." And then, but then I think that
[32:28] I'm young until I hang out with the
[32:29] youth and I'm like, "I'm
[32:31] old. I don't even know what that word
[32:33] means that you just said or how to use
[32:37] it." So, I'm in that weird stage, but I
[32:40] think I I I kind of like it. And I'm in
[32:41] this I'm in this little in between where
[32:43] I can really I can see where the elders
[32:45] are coming from now. But I also feel for
[32:49] what the youth are going through and
[32:52] everybody in between. And I'm really
[32:54] really really empathetic now and really
[32:56] hit my knees for parents who have
[32:58] teenagers. Don't say amen, Aiden, back
[33:00] there. Really, really hit my knees for
[33:02] parents who have teenagers who I'm
[33:05] telling you when you when you get that
[33:06] they're they're awesome when they're
[33:08] little and they're running around. They
[33:09] get to a certain age and all of your
[33:12] cares become about them having a
[33:14] relationship with God.
[33:17] You're I'm telling you my whole my whole
[33:19] care in the world if I could I tell you
[33:21] this and it's the truth. I don't even
[33:22] know if it's the right way to think,
[33:24] brother Aaron. If I could give up
[33:27] everything I have that my children would
[33:29] be saved, I would do it just like that.
[33:31] Amen.
[33:33] If I could give up my own salvation so
[33:36] that they could have salvation, I would
[33:38] give it up just like that. That's how
[33:40] much they mean to me. And it's just a a
[33:43] a place that maybe the Lord's brought me
[33:44] from. So maybe this comes a little bit
[33:46] from that place, you forgive me.
[33:49] But I I I thought maybe because I I've
[33:52] been in the message my whole life and
[33:54] grew up in church my whole life.
[33:55] Although I've left the Lord and I've
[33:57] come back and I've tried to live my own
[33:59] life and I've come back and I really
[34:01] truly haven't been serving the Lord
[34:02] except for maybe the last few years, you
[34:05] know, for the most part, I think he was
[34:07] serving me.
[34:10] And I I really haven't been a good
[34:12] servant of the Lord like I want to be.
[34:14] But and and I I I just love the Lord
[34:18] because you know when you think that
[34:20] you're doing well and you think that
[34:21] you're doing okay and that you think
[34:22] that man I'm I'm doing well in the Lord.
[34:25] You know we had a we had a brother come
[34:26] and preach for us just a week ago and
[34:28] the Lord just absolutely broke me
[34:32] down and I realized I wasn't serving the
[34:34] Lord like I should have been serving
[34:36] him. And it didn't hurt me to feel that
[34:40] like maybe it would have hurt my my ego
[34:42] or my attitude a few years ago. I was so
[34:45] thankful to the Lord
[34:47] that he allowed somebody to come in and
[34:50] didn't know what I was going through,
[34:51] doesn't know how I live, and and speak
[34:53] something from the word that just
[34:55] absolutely broke me down. And then I
[34:57] started to read this scripture. I said,
[34:58] "Lord, that's that's when you came near
[35:01] to
[35:02] me." When I allowed myself to be
[35:07] broken and I thought I I started to
[35:10] think I said, you know, why, Lord? Why
[35:11] are you near someone with a broken
[35:14] spirit? Why are you near somebody with a
[35:16] with a contrite
[35:19] heart? And you know, I started to maybe
[35:22] to think about that a little bit and I
[35:24] thought, you know, there are things that
[35:26] live inside of
[35:29] you. There are things that that live
[35:31] inside your minds and live inside your
[35:33] hearts. If I could just name a few of
[35:34] them and then maybe you could see what
[35:36] I'm talking about. You know what lives
[35:37] inside of you are your thoughts, right?
[35:39] You're thinking them right now.
[35:42] Maybe good, maybe bad. I don't know.
[35:45] Maybe the thought is like, "All right,
[35:46] man. Speed this up.
[35:49] Maybe the thought is, "Hey, okay, all
[35:51] right. I see where you're going, but you
[35:52] know, I don't know what the thought is."
[35:53] You know what the thought is? Man, I
[35:55] just argue with my wife on the way to
[35:56] church. And you know what? She's wrong.
[35:59] She's wrong. And she's thinking, "No,
[36:01] no, he's wrong." Right? Our thoughts,
[36:03] they live inside of us. Sometimes they
[36:05] have us. Sometimes we don't have them.
[36:07] Sometimes they have us. You know, the
[36:09] other things that live inside of you,
[36:10] your ideas, maybe your ideas of how a
[36:13] church service should
[36:15] go, maybe your weakness and your
[36:17] strength and all and our ways. You know,
[36:18] the other thing that lives inside of us
[36:20] is your will. That's a that's a really
[36:22] dangerous one. That lives inside your
[36:25] will, your nature, your spirit, your
[36:26] life. We could just go through all these
[36:28] things, but there are things that that
[36:29] dwell inside your heart and dwell inside
[36:31] your mind that dwell in your spirit that
[36:34] the Lord wants access to.
[36:38] He wants access to that. And so maybe
[36:42] that's why there's there's a brokenness
[36:44] that he seeks out. And you know, the
[36:46] simplest answer I would think of why the
[36:48] Lord wants to be around a broken person,
[36:50] a broken heart, a broken spirit, is
[36:54] that no matter what we say, I just want
[36:57] to I just want to tell you, I'm in this
[36:58] with you. No matter what I say, I say I
[37:01] would let go of those things, but I
[37:04] won't.
[37:06] I say, 'Lord, I want to surrender my
[37:08] will to you, but but do I?
[37:13] Lord, I want to give you all of my
[37:14] thoughts. I want to give you all of my
[37:16] ideas. I want to give you everything
[37:18] about me, but do I do
[37:21] it? Sometimes I find myself with a
[37:23] thought that doesn't belong to the Lord.
[37:25] And then I wonder, did I really give him
[37:27] my mind? Did I really give him my heart?
[37:30] And you know, we're we're flesh. You
[37:32] know, we have a battle.
[37:34] We're not going to we're not going to be
[37:36] in control 100%. But you know what? When
[37:38] I have a thought right then, I can
[37:40] surrender it to the Lord.
[37:43] And you know, we can say that we would
[37:44] let go of the things that God wants to
[37:47] voluntarily, but I just don't know if we
[37:48] can. And maybe here's a point. Um I
[37:51] think that you have things and I have
[37:53] things right now that we need to
[37:55] surrender to the Lord, but I think we're
[37:57] holding on to them.
[38:00] And so I could say, and it sounds so
[38:02] good, Brother Dan. No, I can do it. I I
[38:04] can I can I can surrender that thing to
[38:06] the
[38:06] Lord. I I can I can I can have the
[38:10] willpower to not do that thing that I
[38:13] know is wrong. I can have the willpower
[38:14] to do it. But do you have it
[38:19] when it comes
[38:20] to carrying it out? Do you carry it out?
[38:24] Or do you find yourself back on your
[38:26] knees a day later, a week later saying,
[38:28] "Lord, I did that thing again.
[38:32] I thought I surrendered it to you, Lord.
[38:34] I'm I'm strong enough, Lord, to
[38:37] surrender it to you. I'm going to give
[38:38] it up to you, Lord. It's for reals this
[38:40] time. And a week later, you're on your
[38:42] knees again, Lord. I don't know why I
[38:43] did that thing again. I don't know why I
[38:46] said that thing again. I don't know why
[38:47] I thought that thought
[38:49] again. And you know, the Lord knows how
[38:52] we are because he made us that way. And
[38:55] I love that the Lord knows how we are.
[38:57] And he knows that we're not strong
[38:58] enough to surrender it. Our Lord makes a
[39:00] way to get it out of us. And the way
[39:03] that he makes to get it out of us is to
[39:06] break
[39:08] us. And that sounds cruel, but it's not
[39:12] cruel. And it sounds like chastening,
[39:14] but it's not
[39:16] chastening. It's education. It's love.
[39:20] It's convincing.
[39:22] I think the hardest work that the Lord
[39:24] has to do, this is me personally. I
[39:27] think the Lord the the hardest thing
[39:28] that he has to do is to convince me that
[39:30] I'm his child
[39:34] because the entire time my mind and my
[39:36] heart is telling me of all the things
[39:38] that I do wrong and all the things and
[39:39] all the reasons why I'm not his child.
[39:42] And he's working hard to convince me
[39:43] that I am his child. No, no, no. I did
[39:46] die for you. Yes, I know that you're
[39:49] guilty of this. Yes, I know that you've
[39:50] done that, but I did die for you. If
[39:52] you'll just turn and look at me.
[39:55] And you know, the first thing you can
[39:56] imagine, you know, maybe when I say that
[39:58] you're holding on to something, I don't
[39:59] know where your mind goes. If I were to
[40:02] hear that from a preacher, where my mind
[40:03] goes is immediately it goes to the
[40:04] things I'm doing
[40:06] wrong. Now, you know what those are for
[40:08] you. I don't know what those are for
[40:10] you. I don't want to know what those are
[40:11] for you. I got my own have to deal with.
[40:15] But but I know that that should come up
[40:17] in our minds because the Lord convicts
[40:20] us. He pricks our heart and and and and
[40:22] it's it's the rare person that has gone
[40:25] so far that can't be pricricked by the
[40:28] Lord. And the first thing you might
[40:30] imagine what you're holding on to is
[40:32] your sin or things you're doing wrong.
[40:33] And and and why is that? Why does that
[40:35] come up immediately into your mind? And
[40:37] you know, I want to tell you that it's
[40:39] not it's not the pastor that causes that
[40:41] thing to come up in your mind.
[40:44] And it's not me. It's not the minister.
[40:46] It's not the Bible that causes it. It's
[40:48] none of those things. You know what what
[40:50] what causes that to come up is you.
[40:54] You're the one that your soul is crying
[40:56] out for something. And when you start to
[41:00] think about what you need, your soul
[41:01] says, "Here's all the things that are in
[41:03] the way of me getting that thing that I
[41:04] need. I need and I hunger for something
[41:08] and there's something in the way." And
[41:10] your soul is going to tell you what's in
[41:12] the way. When the Lord brings conviction
[41:14] and something comes up in your mind, oh
[41:16] man, I you're right, Lord. I don't do
[41:18] that thing that he's talking about.
[41:19] Lord, I don't do that. And Lord, I do
[41:21] these other things. It's your own soul
[41:23] saying, I'm hungry and there's something
[41:25] in the way.
[41:27] That's exactly how the Lord works. And
[41:29] sometimes we'll hear something from the
[41:31] pulpit or from whatever it might be a
[41:32] source. And it's a it's a Holy Spirit
[41:34] inspired word. It's it's a true word.
[41:37] And what that word does is it breaks
[41:39] through our
[41:40] wall and it and it causes a reaction in
[41:43] our heart. And and then when it causes
[41:45] that reaction, something inside of you
[41:47] brings to attention something that the
[41:49] Lord wants you to know about yourself.
[41:51] He brings to your attention something
[41:53] that's getting in his
[41:56] way.
[41:58] And you know, this is I I it's okay that
[42:02] if it's quiet, I don't actually don't
[42:04] mind if it's quiet. I'm not a preacher
[42:05] that says you need to be saying amen
[42:07] because I think that if you're quiet,
[42:09] you might be thinking about what I'm
[42:10] telling you
[42:12] or you're getting some good
[42:14] rest. Either way is
[42:16] good. Either way is good.
[42:20] But you're resting. I I've I've seen
[42:23] people rest in a in in multiple
[42:27] ways. But but when that happens and and
[42:30] brothers and sisters, I believe that
[42:31] happens really truly I think that
[42:33] happens almost every time we're in
[42:35] service, every time we're around the
[42:37] Lord, every time that we're around his
[42:39] presence, his presence comes in and
[42:42] immediately our our our our own heart
[42:46] and our own
[42:47] soul thinks about the things that we're
[42:49] ashamed
[42:51] about. And you know, you're going to
[42:52] have a choice. I don't know if you know
[42:55] this, but you have a choice.
[42:59] Amen. You have a choice. What are you
[43:02] going to do when that
[43:04] happens? How are you going to react when
[43:06] the Lord pricks your
[43:07] heart? And you can react in many
[43:10] different ways. You can be hurt at the
[43:13] Lord. I've been hurt at the
[43:15] Lord. You can be angry. I've been angry
[43:19] at the Lord. I'm just going to I'll just
[43:21] confess to you before this morning. I've
[43:23] been angry at the Lord. You can be
[43:25] prideful. You can make excuses. I've
[43:27] done both of those. Made excuses for why
[43:30] I do that thing or why I don't do this
[43:32] other thing. Oh, you know what? You're
[43:33] right, Lord. I I don't pray like I
[43:34] should, but you know, I'm so
[43:37] busy. You know, I got a family to take
[43:40] care of and I got it's hard to take
[43:41] care. You know what? The world is
[43:45] expens and and really the Lord just
[43:47] broke me a few weeks ago with somebody
[43:49] talking about this and just saying all
[43:52] the things that you make time for and
[43:53] you don't make time for the Lord.
[43:56] And I started to think, "Oh, well,
[43:58] that's yep, that's true. That's true."
[44:00] Now, I could have been angry. I could
[44:02] have been prideful. I could have been
[44:04] hurt. But but I believe it's the Lord
[44:06] inside of me reacting to the Lord
[44:09] pricking my own heart, saying, "That's
[44:10] the truth, Lord."
[44:13] And how are you going to feel? Maybe
[44:14] you're going to feel ashamed of it. A
[44:15] lot of us feel shame when the Lord
[44:18] exposes us a little bit or tears or how
[44:22] you going to react. And you say, "Well,
[44:23] what does it matter?" I think it matters
[44:25] because what what I'm telling you when
[44:27] that happens, you are experiencing what
[44:30] it's like to be
[44:32] broken. Because what is inside is coming
[44:36] out. And why does that matter? And and
[44:39] it matters because you're at a
[44:41] crossroads right
[44:43] there. Now, maybe it's not even
[44:45] happening right now, but maybe it is
[44:46] happening for one person. Maybe you're
[44:48] at a crossroads right now. You can
[44:50] decide what you're going to do when the
[44:52] Lord comes in and shows you just a
[44:54] little bit about yourself. You're at a
[44:56] crossroads. You have a decision to make.
[44:58] You can either go forward or you can go
[45:00] back.
[45:04] You can go forward or you can go back.
[45:05] There's no other direction. You know,
[45:07] the word teaches us when you come into
[45:09] the presence of God that you cannot
[45:10] leave the same person that you came in.
[45:13] Amen. The word tells us that if you come
[45:15] into the presence of God, he certainly
[45:16] is here this morning, that you will go
[45:19] out from that presence a better or a
[45:22] worse person.
[45:25] And you know, you actually decide which
[45:26] one that is. God doesn't decide that.
[45:30] Brother Dan doesn't decide that. Brother
[45:32] Josiah song leading doesn't decide that.
[45:34] Your your spouse next to you doesn't
[45:35] decide that. You decide that.
[45:38] How am I going to leave the presence of
[45:40] God this morning?
[45:43] And and and I think there are many
[45:45] people who are come into the presence of
[45:48] the Lord and maybe hear a genuine
[45:50] inspired word of God and they're broken
[45:52] by it and they leave instead of
[45:55] continuing forward. And I want to tell
[45:57] you that if you leave, if you decide,
[45:59] you know what, that's not for me. I
[46:00] didn't like that feeling, brother Dan. I
[46:01] didn't really like that conviction that
[46:03] was brought on. I'm just not going to go
[46:04] to that place anymore so I don't have to
[46:06] feel that con conviction.
[46:09] I'm just not going to read the Bible
[46:10] anymore because the Bible brought the
[46:12] conviction. And you know, people can
[46:13] make this choice. You can make this
[46:15] choice. But I want to tell you this that
[46:17] if you make that choice, you still are
[46:19] leaving broken.
[46:22] You're not whole because you decide I
[46:24] don't want to hear that word anymore. I
[46:26] don't want to, you know, the church was
[46:27] nice and the people were nice, but every
[46:29] time I went there, I felt a conviction.
[46:31] Even though if you really look at it,
[46:33] that's the Lord
[46:35] wanting to get inside, wanting to get
[46:37] something out of you. I just am not
[46:38] going to go back there because uh I felt
[46:40] ashamed of I I felt ashamed of myself
[46:42] and I don't like to feel ashamed of
[46:44] myself. So, I'm going to leave. I'm
[46:45] going to tell you that you didn't leave
[46:46] healed.
[46:48] You didn't leave whole. You didn't put
[46:50] yourself back together and walk out the
[46:52] door and then continue your life outside
[46:53] of of God's presence. You left broken.
[46:58] And what will happen, and I've seen this
[47:00] almost without exception, what will
[47:02] happen is if you leave broken, then you
[47:05] it's going to have an effect on your
[47:07] life. If you decide, I don't want to
[47:10] move forward. I don't want to go further
[47:12] into this really uncomfortable
[47:14] feeling. Is it uncomfortable sometimes
[47:16] when the Lord exposes what's going on
[47:18] inside your heart? I think that's
[47:20] something we should all be able to
[47:21] agree. Is it embarrassing sometimes when
[47:23] the Lord shows you a mirror of exactly
[47:26] how you act and how you talk and how how
[47:28] much time you give the Lord? That's what
[47:29] he did to me just a week ago. He put a
[47:32] mirror up in front of me. He said,
[47:33] "Look, this is how much time you give
[47:35] me." And I was ashamed of it. I was
[47:37] ashamed of it. Calling myself a
[47:39] Christian, calling myself a believer,
[47:42] and that's what I gave my Lord.
[47:44] And I was I was ashamed of myself. And
[47:47] you know, that's not a good feeling.
[47:49] But that feeling doesn't go away if you
[47:51] just walk out the doors and say, "I'm
[47:52] not coming back anymore." What'll happen
[47:55] is is because a part of you has been
[47:57] exposed. I'm just I'm just going to
[47:59] preach you from my heart. Because a part
[48:01] of you has been exposed. And I know this
[48:02] because I've walked out and said, "I'm
[48:04] not going back anymore because I don't
[48:06] like that feeling. I don't like that
[48:09] conviction. I don't like that prick in
[48:11] my heart that I felt. So, I just not
[48:12] going to listen to it anymore." I was so
[48:14] miserable
[48:17] because I was already broken. And what
[48:18] happened is when I left, I really
[48:20] started to resent
[48:22] anybody that had was associated with
[48:25] that church or that that that word that
[48:27] I heard. I really started and really who
[48:29] I really started to get angry with was
[48:30] the
[48:31] Lord. Really started to have a
[48:33] bitterness against them. And here's the
[48:35] transition. Um and I don't know if
[48:37] you've ever you you ever hear somebody
[48:38] go, I just don't like that church
[48:39] because they're so judgmental over
[48:41] there.
[48:43] And you know, let's be let's be honest.
[48:45] Sometimes we can be judgmental, right?
[48:47] Amen. Amen. We should have some that one
[48:49] we should that one I'll say we should
[48:50] say amen to. Sometimes we can be a
[48:52] little judgmental. Sometimes we can look
[48:54] at somebody and in our minds we we have
[48:56] what the Bible says and we we scan them
[48:59] with the Bible and go, "Oh, you just
[49:01] don't line up."
[49:03] And that part you don't have to say amen
[49:04] to because I know what happens. I know
[49:06] we do that. I I don't I don't think that
[49:08] we should do that, but I think it's
[49:10] natural. You have rules, but do you have
[49:12] a relationship? That's right. And
[49:15] sometimes you'll look at somebody and
[49:16] go, "Oh, well, hm, they're just not
[49:18] really fitting what the Bible says you
[49:19] should be." But why don't you let God do
[49:21] that?
[49:23] You don't need to impose rules on them.
[49:25] Let God cleanse them from the inside
[49:27] out. Then it's something that's real.
[49:29] You know, you can put on um you know,
[49:32] sisters, you can put on a dress. That
[49:33] didn't make you a Christian.
[49:37] I'm sorry. Didn't brothers, you can you
[49:39] can clean up your language. That didn't
[49:41] make you a Christian.
[49:45] Now, if you're a Christian, he'll clean
[49:46] up your language.
[49:49] But sometimes we get we we got the we
[49:51] got the the cart behind the in front of
[49:54] the horse and the horse behind it.
[49:57] And no wonder sometimes people are
[49:59] driven away from church, driven away
[50:01] from the Lord. There's a standard that's
[50:03] set by me sometimes. You don't have to
[50:07] raise your hand, but by me sometimes.
[50:08] That's an impossible standard for
[50:10] somebody to live up to. And really when
[50:12] they look at you, they go, "You're not
[50:13] even living up to that standard." I
[50:15] think that's what we were talking about
[50:16] yesterday. Wait a minute. Okay. So, um I
[50:19] I I I love the church here, it's just so
[50:21] awesome. Um what about that other church
[50:24] across town? You guys you guys get along
[50:26] with them? Well, you know, kind of. And
[50:29] then this person's like, "Well, wait a
[50:30] minute. You don't get along with
[50:31] some Well, there's nothing different
[50:33] about you than the other churches.
[50:36] There's nothing different about you than
[50:37] another denomination if you can't just
[50:39] get a what do you mean you guys believe
[50:40] the same thing and this is what you're
[50:42] inviting me into,
[50:47] you know, and eventually that person
[50:49] will will will hate
[50:51] themsself because they're
[50:53] broken. And I want to tell you this. I I
[50:56] I just want to move forward. I I have a
[50:58] few more minutes. We're okay.
[51:00] I know. I I I'm sorry, little guys. We
[51:03] were we were going to get out. But you
[51:06] know, moving forward is is is the
[51:08] hardest thing to do, but it's the best
[51:10] thing to do. And I'm telling you, going
[51:12] back and leaving is the it's the easiest
[51:15] thing to do and it's the worst thing
[51:16] that you could do. And and and why why
[51:19] you might ask, why is it hard to move
[51:21] forward? I think I got through the hard
[51:22] part. You didn't get through the hard
[51:24] part yet.
[51:27] All God did
[51:29] was by his grace, by his presence, by
[51:32] his word, maybe by a song, is he just
[51:35] broke you open and exposed you.
[51:38] The hard part comes
[51:39] next. See, because he's near to those
[51:42] that have a broken
[51:43] heart and a contrite spirit. You know
[51:46] what contrite
[51:48] means? To be
[51:51] crushed. It literally means to be just
[51:54] crushed into
[51:58] powder. You thought it was going to get
[52:01] easier. After he breaks
[52:04] you, now comes
[52:08] crushing. And that's hard. I'm telling
[52:10] you, that's hard.
[52:14] Um, through the breaking, God shows you
[52:18] cuz God already knows what's inside of
[52:20] you.
[52:21] But through that breaking, God shows you
[52:23] what's inside of you. And then he tells
[52:25] you, "Okay, now if you want to be rid of
[52:27] that, if you want to decide to move
[52:29] forward, there's only one way to be rid
[52:30] of
[52:31] it." And you'll say, "No, no, no, Lord,
[52:34] don't crush me. I'll give it up to you."
[52:36] But you
[52:37] won't. I won't.
[52:40] You know what I'll do? Let me let me put
[52:42] some bondo over the cracks. And Lord,
[52:45] I'll go to church every Sunday. I'll go
[52:47] every Sunday night. I'll go every
[52:48] Wednesday. and I'll sing it and let me
[52:50] just kind of patch that up a little bit
[52:51] and and Lord, I'll give it to you.
[52:57] Yeah. Now, maybe you never said that to
[53:00] the Lord, but I and I don't think I've
[53:01] ever said that to the Lord, but I
[53:02] certainly have acted it out.
[53:05] I've certainly done that. But see, and
[53:08] this is a beautiful thing, and maybe
[53:09] this is just a depressing message to
[53:11] you. It's not supposed to be depressing.
[53:13] You know, there's a difference between
[53:15] God and Satan. And we'll get to the
[53:16] encouraging part, I promise.
[53:20] The difference between God and Satan is
[53:21] that God doesn't just show you where
[53:24] you're wrong.
[53:26] See, Satan, he can just he'll whisper in
[53:28] your ear and he'll tell you how bad of a
[53:30] person you are. Maybe you feel that way
[53:31] right now. That wasn't the intention.
[53:33] Maybe he'll tell you how bad of a person
[53:35] you are. He tell you how bad of a
[53:36] Christian you are. You're not worthy.
[53:40] You're not worthy to be saved by the
[53:41] Lord. You're not worthy that he died for
[53:43] you. You are too bad. He'll whisper that
[53:46] you're in sin. you tell you you're not
[53:47] good enough, he'll tell you all these
[53:48] things, but that's all he can do is tell
[53:50] you those things. He can't give you a
[53:52] way out.
[53:54] He cannot give you a way of escape. Um,
[53:57] if you could put it this way, he can
[53:58] only give you a report about what's
[54:00] going on with you.
[54:03] He has no ability to give you a path out
[54:05] of that. But the Lord, who is rich in
[54:08] mercy,
[54:10] Amen. I don't know if you've experienced
[54:12] his mercy, but it's it's one of the best
[54:14] things you'll ever experience.
[54:16] He will not only rebuke you, which isn't
[54:19] what we thought it meant, but like the
[54:21] good father he is, he'll chasen you.
[54:23] He'll teach you. He'll bring you up as
[54:26] though you're his child. Not just
[54:28] disciplined like I heard about my whole
[54:30] life, which is just like a a club, a
[54:33] whip,
[54:35] but with an arm around you.
[54:37] You know, I I want to read this. It
[54:39] says, "If you can't different with a man
[54:41] and love him at the same time, then shut
[54:44] up.
[54:47] was right out of the message. It's
[54:49] pretty harsh
[54:52] language. That's a That's a lesson I
[54:54] need to learn right there, brother
[54:55] Josiah. Just if you can't love somebody
[54:58] you're different with, shut
[55:00] up. I'd do a whole lot of good if I just
[55:03] shut up a lot of
[55:05] times. If you can't tell him like a
[55:08] father correcting his child with a
[55:10] willing arm to put around his neck and
[55:12] hug him afterwards, you better leave it
[55:13] alone.
[55:14] You haven't went far enough yourself to
[55:18] know what you're talking about. I can
[55:20] differ with a man certainly. Still, he
[55:22] is my brother. I'll hold his hand. I
[55:23] can't let him get by with that. If I do,
[55:25] if I didn't tell him, I wouldn't be a
[55:27] correct brother to him. That's correct.
[55:29] But I can tell him and then tell him I
[55:31] love him and prove it to him that I love
[55:33] him. And see, God will show you where
[55:36] he's wrong. God's never going to ask you
[55:37] to do something that he hasn't done
[55:38] himself.
[55:40] God God put that in his word because
[55:42] that's how God is. He's going to give
[55:45] you a path forward and and and he's
[55:47] going to he wants to change you. He
[55:48] wants to transform you. And how does he
[55:49] do that? Oh, he do does that by building
[55:51] me up. No, he doesn't. He does that by
[55:53] crushing you and it turns you into
[55:56] powder. And it sounds cruel, but it's
[55:57] the most loving thing that God can do
[55:59] for you and for me. And and there's a
[56:01] there's a three-fold purpose in this.
[56:02] I'm just going to hurry and we'll close.
[56:04] It's not just to expose you. You know,
[56:06] God's not in the business of
[56:07] embarrassing you. Now, I'm embarrassed
[56:10] about what I've done, what I've thought.
[56:12] But he's not he's not he doesn't get
[56:14] pleasure out of shaming
[56:16] you. But you know, there's something
[56:18] that's beautiful. It's not just to
[56:20] expose you, but it's to deliver you and
[56:24] be free of the things that he exposed.
[56:27] You will never, and I would never be
[56:28] free of my own
[56:30] will unless he crushed
[56:33] me. I'll never be free of my weakness or
[56:36] my ways. It takes a crucifixion. And I'm
[56:38] going to prove it to you in just a
[56:39] minute. And you know, as unlimited as
[56:41] God is, God is unlimited. He has a way
[56:44] that he's going to do
[56:45] things. He made a way for him to and he
[56:48] abides right by that word. It's in the
[56:49] word. He cannot make you into what he
[56:52] wants you to be until he breaks you and
[56:54] then crushes you down. He know he
[56:56] doesn't take that we hear about the
[56:57] potter and the clay. He does not take,
[56:59] brother Aaron, you we know this. He
[57:01] doesn't take a halfbroken vase and
[57:03] transform it into what he wants.
[57:07] He crushes you down to the
[57:10] material and starts over. And you say,
[57:13] "You know what? Amen. He did that for me
[57:15] 30 years ago. Woo. Praise the
[57:18] Lord. He did that for me 10 years ago.
[57:22] And you know what? He just did it to me
[57:23] last
[57:24] week. God
[57:26] because he didn't quite like what I was
[57:32] becoming. Even though I've turned my
[57:34] life over to him, I I surrender to him,
[57:37] right? Oh, wait a minute. There's a
[57:39] little something I need to expose right
[57:40] there. Oh, I didn't I don't like that.
[57:42] You know what? Take the clay down. Start
[57:44] over again until I'm perfect. Until
[57:48] you're perfect. Never get so so mature.
[57:52] Never get to the point in your walk
[57:53] where the Lord can't break you down to
[57:55] dust and start over with you. That's
[57:59] what he wants to do. And and I'm going
[58:02] to close here with this. You see, you
[58:03] know, there are things you think, man,
[58:05] that was
[58:06] depressing. That's that hurts. That was
[58:08] just a bunch of Hang on. Now, there are
[58:11] things that live in you also that cannot
[58:13] be released until he crushes you. You
[58:17] know that that my worship is so much
[58:20] different than it used to
[58:22] be because I had a praise and worship
[58:25] that was inside of me that needed to
[58:28] come out.
[58:32] And and and again, I'll prove it here by
[58:34] the word in a minute, but you know,
[58:36] songs mean something different after the
[58:38] Lord crushes you.
[58:41] Lyrics aren't just common lyrics that
[58:43] rhyme and they sound good. No, they mean
[58:45] something different after the Lord's
[58:46] dealt with you. You know, and even my
[58:48] prayer, my prayers are are they're
[58:50] different after the Lord crushes you.
[58:52] Well, why is that? Because they were in
[58:54] you and they needed to come out. And the
[58:56] only way to get a sincere prayer out of
[58:58] us sometimes is the Lord to crush it out
[59:00] of us.
[59:01] Sometimes the only way to get sincere
[59:03] worship that goes beyond how good it
[59:05] sounds, it goes beyond the rhythm and
[59:07] the beat and the key. It might be too
[59:09] high. It might be too low. But but when
[59:11] the Lord crushes it out of you, oh, it's
[59:13] it's sweet. It's the sweetest prayer.
[59:16] It's the sweetest praise. You know, even
[59:19] our service to the Lord, oh man, it's a
[59:21] drag. We got to go to church again. When
[59:23] the Lord crushes you, oh, service
[59:25] becomes a joy.
[59:27] I'm telling you, it's a joy to serve the
[59:30] Lord. It's not a burden. It's a joy to
[59:32] serve the Lord. Why? He crushed that
[59:34] part out of me and it became a it beca
[59:37] my service became a joy to him. It never
[59:39] would have been that unless he crushed
[59:41] me.
[59:44] I'm going to read this. And every man
[59:45] that really gets close to Jesus can
[59:47] never be the same anymore. You can't
[59:49] associate with that old dry formal
[59:51] religion anymore. You've got something
[59:53] in you that changes you and makes you
[59:55] different if you've ever come close to
[59:57] him. Now, you can go close to the church
[1:00:00] and do anything, but you can't come
[1:00:01] close to Jesus and be the same anymore.
[1:00:04] And you know, God has never asked you to
[1:00:05] do something that he hasn't done
[1:00:07] himself. Lord, you're asking me to be
[1:00:08] broken and you're asking me to be
[1:00:10] crushed. Lord, it's too much for me to
[1:00:11] bear. And he says, I did it for you.
[1:00:16] Because inside of Jesus now, Jesus
[1:00:18] himself had even though he was the son
[1:00:21] of God and God in flesh, the Godhead
[1:00:23] bodily we believe, yet he had to go to
[1:00:26] the cross and be crushed.
[1:00:30] And and why? As an example, just to just
[1:00:32] to just to tell you, well, I can do it.
[1:00:34] So if I can do it, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:00:36] Because there are things that lay in
[1:00:39] Jesus and the son of God that could not
[1:00:41] come out unless he was broken and
[1:00:44] crushed.
[1:00:46] You know that your healing, how many
[1:00:48] wants healing for anything, a physical,
[1:00:51] mental, spiritual, you need healing or
[1:00:53] you know somebody that needs healing, it
[1:00:54] could not have come out unless God
[1:00:57] himself went to a cross, was broken and
[1:00:59] crushed. It would have laid inside of
[1:01:02] him and you would have had no hope.
[1:01:06] You could have prayed to God Almighty,
[1:01:07] Lord, heal me, and he would have had no,
[1:01:09] listen now, God, as unlimited as he is,
[1:01:11] he has a way of doing things. He would
[1:01:13] have had no way to heal you unless he
[1:01:17] was crushed first. And the healing that
[1:01:18] dwelt inside of him came out.
[1:01:23] When was he crushed? Before the
[1:01:25] foundation of the world, he was crushed.
[1:01:28] We just got a physical view of it on
[1:01:30] Calvary. And my salvation. What about
[1:01:32] the blood of Christ? Where we where we
[1:01:34] put our There can't be no blood unless
[1:01:37] somebody
[1:01:39] bleeds. He had to be crushed. God is
[1:01:41] going has gone through what he's asking
[1:01:44] you to go through.
[1:01:46] Your salvation lay in
[1:01:49] Jesus and it could not have made it to
[1:01:51] you unless he was crushed first. And the
[1:01:54] most important thing I think the Holy
[1:01:55] Spirit lay in
[1:01:57] him and it needed to be
[1:02:00] freed and he was crushed at Calvary.
[1:02:05] Isaiah 57:15 says,"For thus sayeth the
[1:02:07] high and lofty one that inhabitth
[1:02:09] eternity, whose name is holy, I dwell in
[1:02:12] the high and holy
[1:02:14] place." Sounds good. Sounds we picture
[1:02:17] maybe God in a throne in heavens, right?
[1:02:21] I dwell in the high and holy place with
[1:02:23] him that is of a contrite and humble
[1:02:26] heart to revive the spirit of the humble
[1:02:30] and to revive the heart of the contrite
[1:02:33] ones. the crushed ones. That's where he
[1:02:35] dwells. The reason Jesus had to be
[1:02:38] crushed, this uh it says here in this
[1:02:41] message from I know, it's called I know.
[1:02:44] To bring forth what he
[1:02:47] was. That's
[1:02:49] powerful. The reason Jesus had to be
[1:02:52] crushed was to bring forth what he was.
[1:02:55] He could not stand before the
[1:02:56] crucifixion and say, "All power in
[1:02:58] heavens and earth are given to my hand."
[1:03:00] But after the crucifixion, he could
[1:03:03] stand and say all powers and heaven are
[1:03:06] mine. What did it do? It took the
[1:03:08] crucifixion first. Now listen, it taken
[1:03:11] the crushing and the
[1:03:16] disappointment. The apostles had seen
[1:03:18] their savior, the one they had loved,
[1:03:20] and seen him even raise up the dead from
[1:03:22] the grave. They had seen him do that.
[1:03:24] And then they think there he lays cold
[1:03:26] in the grave by himself this morning.
[1:03:28] See, it took a crucifixion. It took It
[1:03:31] takes the crushing of the flower to
[1:03:35] bring perfume from it.
[1:03:38] It takes, if you don't listen to another
[1:03:41] thing I tell you, this should be on your
[1:03:44] mind right here because it comes right
[1:03:45] out of the word of God. It takes the
[1:03:47] crushing of a life to get the best out
[1:03:51] of it that there is.
[1:03:55] We are not. If you're a believer, if you
[1:03:59] want to be a believer, but if you have
[1:04:01] anything inside that calls out for
[1:04:04] something, I want to tell you this. We
[1:04:05] are not kept from
[1:04:09] trouble. You want to be a Christian,
[1:04:11] you're going to you're going to you're
[1:04:12] going to run into some trouble. Amen.
[1:04:16] We are not kept from trouble. We are
[1:04:17] delivered out of trouble.
[1:04:20] And we are not. I'll tell you, if you're
[1:04:22] a Christian, you're not born free. No,
[1:04:25] you're made free. You are a prisoner.
[1:04:28] And we are not saved. God is not going
[1:04:31] to save us from being broken and
[1:04:32] crushed. He's going to transform us by
[1:04:35] it. Amen.
[1:04:37] When God sees a man contrite, broken
[1:04:39] spirit, sincere in heart, down at the
[1:04:41] altar, God closes the door of the world
[1:04:45] to
[1:04:47] him and seals him in there by the
[1:04:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And it
[1:04:54] lasts until Jesus comes.
[1:04:58] Not from one revival to the other, but
[1:05:00] until the day of your redemption. Amen.
[1:05:02] Let's just stand to our feet.
[1:05:04] I'm sorry that I went longer than I told
[1:05:06] you I was going to
[1:05:12] go. I do mean that. I I don't want to
[1:05:14] take your time up and Lord
[1:05:17] knows we want to just give him control.
[1:05:19] Brother Dan, if you would come. I think
[1:05:22] I've spent enough time. So, God bless
[1:05:24] you. Stay here.
[1:05:36] I want I want want you to do something
[1:05:38] for
[1:05:41] me. Next time you're outside, next time
[1:05:44] you're out for a walk,
[1:05:47] um take if you see a flower, you know,
[1:05:50] you can smell the flowers on the trees.
[1:05:53] If you see a leaf on a tree, take that
[1:05:56] leaf and pick it. Take that flower, pick
[1:05:59] it and smell
[1:06:01] it and then crush
[1:06:05] it and then smell it. There's a big
[1:06:10] difference between something that's
[1:06:12] crushed, it gives off its aroma, and
[1:06:16] then something that's not, something
[1:06:17] that's whole. As brother Ryan said,
[1:06:20] Jesus had to be crushed on the
[1:06:22] cross for that salvation to come out. Do
[1:06:28] that. And remember what our brother
[1:06:32] said about being
[1:06:34] crushed. And even right now as we
[1:06:37] prepare for
[1:06:38] baptism, even right
[1:06:42] now to
[1:06:45] yourself, take a
[1:06:48] moment and just crush
[1:06:52] yourself. Crush yourself. And and and as
[1:06:56] as all those those thoughts as our
[1:06:58] brother told us, they come to our minds
[1:07:01] say say, "Lord,
[1:07:03] okay, here is my
[1:07:06] fault. Here's what I've
[1:07:09] done.
[1:07:11] Now I am repenting to you. Now here is
[1:07:17] this sweet smelling savor that's coming
[1:07:20] up before you, oh God.
[1:07:24] Hear it. Feel it. Lord, smell it from
[1:07:27] me. This crushed person, Lord, I give it
[1:07:31] to you. Here are my sins, Lord. They
[1:07:34] come out of me and they go to
[1:07:37] you and you'll leave a different person.
[1:07:40] Our brother
[1:07:42] said that God
[1:07:45] requires that you don't leave the same
[1:07:47] person that you came in. Now, you have a
[1:07:51] choice. Are you going to leave a better
[1:07:53] person? Are you going to leave a worse
[1:07:55] person? It's up to each one. You can
[1:07:58] just
[1:08:00] disregard that and just go about your
[1:08:03] business or you can take it seriously
[1:08:05] and you can leave a different person.
[1:08:08] [Music]
[1:08:10] Peter
[1:08:11] [Music]
[1:08:13] said in the book of
[1:08:15] Acts, the first
[1:08:17] revival that had
[1:08:20] happened since Jesus Christ had come,
[1:08:23] the first real
[1:08:25] revival that had
[1:08:28] happened. The people were cut in their
[1:08:31] hearts. They were
[1:08:33] crushed in their hearts. And then they
[1:08:38] said, Peter, friends, they said, 'What
[1:08:42] was must we
[1:08:43] do to have this same spirit that you
[1:08:49] have? Peter said
[1:08:51] this. The Bible says, now that when they
[1:08:54] were heard this, they were pricricked in
[1:08:55] their heart. They were cut. They were
[1:08:57] crushed in their heart. And they said to
[1:08:59] Peter and to the rest of the apostles,
[1:09:01] "Men and brethren, what shall we
[1:09:04] do?" And Peter said unto them,
[1:09:09] "Repent.
[1:09:11] Repent. Make a change in your life.
[1:09:13] Don't just feel convicted. Make a change
[1:09:16] in your
[1:09:17] life and be baptized in the name of
[1:09:21] Jesus Christ. You are taking on that
[1:09:25] name of baptism. Lord, I am no longer
[1:09:27] taking my own name. I'm no longer my own
[1:09:30] person, Lord. Now I am your person. I
[1:09:32] take on the name of Jesus
[1:09:39] Christ. And it gets
[1:09:42] better for the washing away of your
[1:09:45] sins, for the remission of your sins,
[1:09:48] and
[1:09:50] then you shall receive the gift of the
[1:09:53] Holy Ghost. Amen. For this promise is
[1:09:56] unto you and to your children and to
[1:09:59] them that are far off, even as many as
[1:10:00] the Lord our God shall call. That means
[1:10:02] those right here with us today, Alexis,
[1:10:06] that means you. It's a promise to you.
[1:10:09] It's a promise to all of us. And we're
[1:10:12] going to baptize now. Keep those words
[1:10:14] in your heart. If you have a desire in
[1:10:17] your heart to lay around lay back that
[1:10:19] old person to crush that old
[1:10:23] person and be filled with the spirit of
[1:10:26] Jesus Christ, it's a good time to be
[1:10:30] baptized. Amen. Whoever would be whoever
[1:10:33] would want to be baptized, if you would
[1:10:34] go back and and meet the deacons, they
[1:10:36] will show you where to go if one of the
[1:10:38] sisters could could
[1:10:42] go. And I bet I promise you it'll be one
[1:10:45] of the greatest decisions you can ever
[1:10:46] make. Amen. You can be
[1:10:51] [Music]
[1:10:52] seated. Those that would like to be
[1:10:54] baptized, go in the
[1:11:00] [Music]
[1:11:07] back. Praise God.

[1:11:38] Look
[1:11:40] full in his

[1:11:47] face. And the
[1:11:49] things of

[1:12:05] [Music]
[1:12:07] Oh,
[1:12:09] turn your

[1:12:22] wonderful face.
[1:12:26] And the
[1:12:28] things of
[1:12:30] earth will grow
[1:12:33] strangely
[1:12:35] dim in the

[1:12:45] time. Just
[1:12:47] turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[1:12:53] [Music]
[1:12:55] Look
[1:12:57] for in his

[1:13:25] He became
[1:13:28] me so that I
[1:13:31] might become him by
[1:13:35] [Music]
[1:13:39] grace. He became
[1:13:43] me so that I
[1:13:46] might become
[1:13:49] him by
[1:13:51] grace. Isn't he wonderful?
[1:13:55] He took my
[1:13:58] place so that
[1:14:00] I by his love could take

[1:16:04] me so that I might become him by grace.
[1:16:16] [Music]
[1:16:25] Praise God.
[1:16:32] Okay. Okay. Alexis, come on over here.
[1:16:38] Yeah. Let me ask you.
[1:16:41] Alexis called me this
[1:16:43] morning and she
[1:16:45] said, "I want this to be my
[1:16:49] decision." She said, "This is this is
[1:16:52] something that I want to do." She said,
[1:16:54] "I have accepted the Lord Jesus as my
[1:16:56] savior. I have made a change in my life.
[1:16:59] I am serving God now. This is my
[1:17:03] choice." And that is baptism. You don't
[1:17:06] You're not baptized because your mom
[1:17:08] wants you to be baptized. You're not
[1:17:09] baptized because your pastor wants you
[1:17:11] to be baptized. You are baptized because
[1:17:13] you are saying, "Lord, I want to come in
[1:17:15] front of all these people." And I want
[1:17:17] to show all of these people that I am
[1:17:20] obedient to you, God, and that from this
[1:17:23] day forward, you can look at me, you can
[1:17:26] look at my life, and you can see that
[1:17:28] there's a change in my
[1:17:30] life. You have something to say?
[1:17:35] Sorry if I like stutter. I I get like
[1:17:39] really awkward with the audience. But
[1:17:41] yeah, so I just want to praise God first
[1:17:44] and foremost for waking me up this
[1:17:46] morning for just continu continuing to
[1:17:49] show me his way. For me continuing to
[1:17:51] learn about and actually having a
[1:17:54] relationship with God, not just knowing
[1:17:56] God, but knowing not just knowing of
[1:17:58] God, but knowing God. And I'm just
[1:18:01] grateful for this church, for pastor,
[1:18:04] for everybody.
[1:18:05] And just what he was talking about um
[1:18:09] what was his name? Ryan. What he was
[1:18:11] talking about today. It it literally
[1:18:15] like I'm sure it wasn't just me but it
[1:18:17] literally spoke to me today too because
[1:18:20] I've been learning about
[1:18:22] well first of all the other day I was
[1:18:25] like reading
[1:18:29] Ecclesiastes and it was talking about
[1:18:32] vanity and vexation of spirit. So I had
[1:18:34] looked it up in my Bible study the other
[1:18:37] night and vanity is basically meaning
[1:18:41] having the emptiness of your soul. So
[1:18:45] you know when you pursue worldly desires
[1:18:48] obviously you know your soul isn't going
[1:18:50] to be filled by that. It's temporary and
[1:18:53] you still always have that emptiness no
[1:18:56] matter what. Like no matter how much you
[1:18:57] try to get rid of any pain, any
[1:19:00] depression, anything, you know, it's
[1:19:03] temporary and you know, the devil tries
[1:19:06] to get in your head with that,
[1:19:08] but it just makes you it just makes
[1:19:11] things worse for you in your life. So
[1:19:13] anyway, so I learned about that
[1:19:15] inexation of spirit and how just not to
[1:19:19] pursue that. And
[1:19:23] I already knew that, but it was I don't
[1:19:25] know why I'm saying it, but it was just
[1:19:26] a good listen in case you didn't know
[1:19:28] what that meant in the Bible. I just
[1:19:29] wanted to let you know. Now I'm And
[1:19:32] yeah, God bless. Thank you, Sister
[1:19:34] Alexis. Amen. She's pretty comfortable
[1:19:36] with a microphone.
[1:19:39] And you
[1:19:40] know, you know that this
[1:19:43] baptism, you know that this is what
[1:19:45] Christians have done for 2,000 years
[1:19:48] that they are saying that I give my
[1:19:50] heart to the Lord Jesus, not to this
[1:19:53] church, but to Jesus Christ. And then
[1:19:56] you know that there's a promise of the
[1:19:58] Holy Spirit dwelling within you.
[1:20:01] Yes. Amen.
[1:20:23] baptize you in the name of the Lord
[1:20:25] Jesus Christ.
[1:20:28] [Applause]
[1:20:55] My
[1:20:56] friend is coming down. You can just grab
[1:20:59] a hold of me if you want.
[1:21:03] We've been praying for you that the Lord
[1:21:06] would heal your his knee,
[1:21:10] right? Come on, stand over here, Sister
[1:21:16] Melissa. It was a nurse that you worked
[1:21:19] with that witnessed to you first, right?
[1:21:21] That really touched your heart. Yes,
[1:21:25] Sister Melissa. The Lord's been working
[1:21:27] on her. Alexis has been in our
[1:21:29] congregation for just a a couple weeks
[1:21:31] now and the Lord's been dealing with her
[1:21:34] and now Melissa who's a friend. The
[1:21:38] Lord's dealing with you and I just want
[1:21:41] to know by your own confession. This is
[1:21:44] your choice that you're making to be
[1:21:46] baptized. Absolutely.
[1:21:50] Praise God. Our sister, the Lord's
[1:21:53] dealing with her. This is the next step
[1:21:56] in all of our walks with the Lord is
[1:21:58] that public confession of I want to take
[1:22:01] on this name of Jesus Christ. That's why
[1:22:03] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:22:05] and not in the titles of the father and
[1:22:07] son and holy ghost because the it's it's
[1:22:10] a name that I want to be associated
[1:22:13] with. I want to be associated with that
[1:22:15] name that man Christ Jesus. Amen.
[1:22:43] Melissa, by your own
[1:22:45] testimony, by your own confession, I
[1:22:48] baptize you in the name of the Lord
[1:22:50] Jesus Christ.
[1:22:55] [Applause]
[1:23:07] Praise God. God's
[1:23:11] good. Brother Ryan, if you could come
[1:23:13] and close. Brother Ryan, if you could
[1:23:15] come and close. Brothers and sisters,
[1:23:18] it's a good day. Any day that we see a
[1:23:20] child of God coming into these waters of
[1:23:23] baptism, it's it's a glorious day. We we
[1:23:27] are happy here and there's smiles on our
[1:23:28] faces, but by the word of God, not by my
[1:23:32] words, but by the word of God, the
[1:23:35] angels are rejoicing in heaven. Praise
[1:23:39] God.

[1:24:26] these these sisters, Lord, that have
[1:24:29] decided, Lord, that you are the most
