[43:27] real baby for baby Jesus here and and
[43:31] this was no different um on Thursday we
[43:35] were rehearsing and and I got to pick up
[43:38] little baby Jesus and I looked at him

[43:42] little shake and he threw up on
[43:48] me you know thank the Lord you know
[43:51] really the real baby Jesus we don't
[43:54] consider these things but the real baby
[43:56] Jesus did the same thing he was a he was
[44:00] a normal little baby that grew up in
[44:03] this world that got sick and he cried
[44:06] and he got headaches and and he was
[44:10] just he was a baby very special baby the
[44:14] baby that we had today little Evan uh he
[44:18] is a foster child for for the jery and
[44:21] sister
[44:22] Angela and um just a he's a wonderful
[44:26] little guy he few months ago he had
[44:29] chronic
[44:31] seizures and he would was very scary
[44:35] thing for Jeremy and Angela and what
[44:37] they had to go through and it was common
[44:40] that the the seizured would would strike
[44:42] the
[44:43] baby and they felt led to bring the
[44:46] child up to be prayed for and we prayed
[44:50] for little 11 and that was the last
[44:52] seizure that he had and it's been months
[45:00] so that God is still God he's still a
[45:03] Healer he's still he's still everything
[45:05] to us and we we just love him so much we
[45:10] come today to um a few days we'll
[45:13] celebrate the Christmas
[45:15] holiday and it's an important time we
[45:19] know of course that Jesus wasn't born on
[45:22] December 25th it wasn't really possible
[45:25] for him to be born at that time but he
[45:28] was in fact born and this is the day
[45:31] that we celebrate his birth when we
[45:34] celebrate these holidays and especially
[45:38] Christmas we celebrate something that
[45:41] happened in the in the past and this is
[45:43] a Jewish tradition that goes way way
[45:46] back all the way to Moses they
[45:50] celebrated these different things that
[45:53] had happened whether it be crossing the
[45:55] Red Sea or whether it be the Passover
[45:58] when Moses was there and and God smokee
[46:01] Egypt whether it be the Harvest God
[46:05] wants us to bring these things back to
[46:08] our
[46:09] remembrance and we do we do here we
[46:12] celebrate the Passover when we take
[46:15] communion we celebrate the Lord's Day we
[46:19] celebrate the resurrection every Sunday
[46:21] morning when we come together these
[46:23] things ought to be recognized and they
[46:26] bring
[46:27] what happened in the past to our
[46:29] remembrance and Christmas is no
[46:31] different it's the one holiday that
[46:33] actually has Christ in it it's a
[46:37] Christian holiday and we have to
[46:40] understand what it means what what
[46:42] Christmas is or else it is what many
[46:46] people call it is a a pagan holiday or
[46:48] or a holiday that was that was set up by
[46:51] the Romans or or whatever it might be if
[46:53] we don't know but if we do know
[46:57] then we should be able to celebrate this
[46:59] day and we should be able to honor our
[47:03] lord Jesus with this day if we were
[47:07] going to celebrate someone's
[47:10] birthday and we just got a bunch of
[47:13] people together and said let's have a
[47:16] birthday and you might say well whose
[47:18] birthday is it no we're just going to
[47:19] celebrate a
[47:21] birthday well we don't know how to
[47:24] celebrate the birthday well what do you
[47:27] mean well it could be a birthday for a a
[47:29] baby it could be a birthday for an
[47:31] elderly person it could be anybody's
[47:33] birthday we have to know who this person
[47:36] is so we can celebrate their birthday
[47:39] and that's what Christmas is if we don't
[47:42] know who Jesus Christ is then how can we
[47:45] truly celebrate his birthday how can we
[47:47] truly give him Honor on this
[47:50] day how else it turns into what many
[47:53] people said it's just a commercial day
[47:57] where you swap gifts and you have a
[47:59] Christmas tree and it turns into nothing
[48:02] but a bunch of
[48:04] commercial that's not what we're here
[48:05] for we are here to honor the true
[48:09] Christmas that has Christ in it we think
[48:13] about a Christmas tree and I know that a
[48:16] lot of people condemn the Christmas tree
[48:18] and they should if it's not about Christ
[48:21] a Christmas tree according to history
[48:24] first came about with the reformer named
[48:27] Martin
[48:28] Luther Martin Luther was walking home
[48:32] one winter night and he was looking up
[48:34] in the
[48:36] stars and he
[48:38] thought of the one that created the
[48:41] heavens and the
[48:42] Earth stars were there and he was
[48:45] walking and and he took
[48:49] candles and lamps and there was a
[48:52] tradition to bring an evergreen
[48:54] tree in that that would symbolize in in
[48:57] German tradition that would
[48:59] symbolize
[49:01] the promise of a resurrection a promise
[49:05] that they that it would be green once
[49:07] again so Martin Luther takes candles and
[49:11] and ornaments and he places them on this
[49:15] tree and he brings his children to it
[49:18] and he says now you bring people to this
[49:21] tree and you tell them what these stars
[49:25] on this tree what this this represents
[49:28] tell them what the
[49:29] star on the top of the tree represents
[49:32] it represents that Star of Bethlehem
[49:35] that the Wise Men
[49:37] followed tell them what the presence
[49:39] underneath the tree it's not just that
[49:41] you get to swap gifts tell them what
[49:45] these these presents represents how how
[49:47] the wise men brought gifts to this young
[49:51] baby Jesus in honor of the
[49:54] king but we can make it about a worldly
[49:59] celebration where it's just about a tree
[50:01] and it's
[50:03] about who can put what on the on the
[50:06] tree and having a day off but if we
[50:08] truly give Jesus the credit for it it
[50:12] should lift up Jesus Christ and we
[50:15] should be able to bring people into our
[50:17] home and bring people into our our
[50:19] church and say this is why we celebrate
[50:22] Christmas it's about Jesus Christ amen
[50:26] no it was he was not born on this day
[50:28] but we don't know when he was born this
[50:29] is the day that we celebrate his birth
[50:32] we celebrate our
[50:34] birthdays so why can't we celebrate the
[50:36] birth of Christ it is a wonderful
[50:40] wonderful day Hebrews 4:15 says we have
[50:44] not a high priest which cannot be
[50:46] touched with the feeling of our
[50:48] infirmities but was in all points temp
[50:51] tempted as we are yet without sin Let Us
[50:54] therefore come boldly unto the throne
[50:56] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[50:59] and find Grace to help in time of need
[51:03] this baby that was
[51:05] born as we acted out here the the kids
[51:09] came up there was no room at the end
[51:11] brought the Child Jesus to the lowest of
[51:15] Low
[51:16] Places put him in this manger because
[51:22] there wasn't room for the King of Kings
[51:25] the Lord of lords
[51:27] Mary gives
[51:29] birth
[51:31] and is unsanitary place but God the
[51:36] father chose for his son to be born
[51:39] there he chose for his son to understand
[51:44] what it is when you don't have money to
[51:48] understand what it is when you are sick
[51:51] to understand what it is when your
[51:54] friends don't treat you right to
[51:56] understand what it is to be persecuted
[51:59] and this man this baby Jesus was born in
[52:03] the lowest of the low he was in all
[52:05] points tempted and yet without sin but
[52:09] he was that pre that high priest that
[52:11] came that knows how it is to be me he
[52:15] knows how it is to be you and he was
[52:19] wonderful he was in fact his name is
[52:21] called wonderful a mighty
[52:24] God he came and and suffered in fact
[52:29] let's read it Isaiah chapter
[52:33] 53 start with verse
[52:37] one says
[52:40] this who has believed our report and to
[52:44] whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for
[52:46] he shall grow up before him as a tender
[52:48] plant and as a root out of dry out of a
[52:52] dry ground he ha no form or comeliness
[52:55] and when we shall see him there is no
[52:58] beauty that we should desire him he even
[53:01] came as a man wasn't the best looking
[53:04] well-dressed most charismatic
[53:07] guy he understands he understands how it
[53:11] is for maybe to be made fun of when
[53:13] you're young he understands how it is to
[53:16] not be the most affluent
[53:21] person he is despised and rejected of
[53:24] men a Man of Sorrows
[53:26] and acquainted with grief and we hid as
[53:29] it were our faces from him he was
[53:32] despised and we esteem esteemed him not
[53:35] surely he hath borne our griefs and
[53:38] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[53:41] him esteem him stricken smitten out of
[53:43] God smitten of God and Afflicted he was
[53:46] wounded for our transgressions he was
[53:49] bruised for our
[53:53] iniquities his the chastisement of our
[53:55] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[53:58] we are healed you know what the word
[54:00] stripes mean he was beaten down
[54:04] embarrassed and because of those stripes
[54:08] that he went
[54:09] through little Evan can be healed in the
[54:13] name of Jesus
[54:14] Christ all we like sheep have gone
[54:17] astray we have turned everyone to his
[54:20] own way and the Lord hath laid on him
[54:23] the iniquity of us all
[54:27] he was oppressed and he was afflicted
[54:30] yet he opened not his mouth he is
[54:33] brought as a lamb to the slaughter and
[54:36] as sheep before her shears is dumb so he
[54:40] opened not his mouth going going to the
[54:44] Cross he didn't fight he
[54:48] didn't he he he didn't scream and
[54:51] yell he was like a a sheep a humble
[54:55] sheep being led right to his
[54:59] Slaughter skip to verse
[55:01] 12 therefore will I divide him a portion
[55:06] with the great and he shall divide the
[55:08] spoil with the strong because he hath
[55:11] poured out his soul unto death and he
[55:14] was numbered with the
[55:16] transgressors and he be the sin of many
[55:20] and made intercession for the transgress
[55:24] transgressors that is the one that that
[55:26] was prophesied to come long before 700
[55:32] years before Jesus came this prophet
[55:35] Isaiah told us who he would be and I
[55:38] read Isaiah chap um chapter 9 before
[55:41] this is who was coming this is this baby
[55:44] that is going to be
[55:45] born and he will be
[55:48] bruised he will be beaten but because
[55:52] this
[55:54] happened we can receive
[55:56] our healing we can receive our joy we
[56:00] can receive most of all we can receive
[56:02] our Salvation because of this baby that
[56:05] was born and we have to know why we
[56:09] celebrate
[56:11] Christmas
[56:13] otherwise it's
[56:15] nothing we celebrate Christmas because
[56:18] of Jesus Christ because of this baby
[56:22] that was
[56:23] born Martin Luther lifted him up
[56:26] all the prophets lifted him
[56:29] up and we want to lift him up on this
[56:33] day and in the days to come as you
[56:35] celebrate Christmas Christmas with your
[56:38] families if you have a
[56:41] tree talk about that
[56:43] tree why do we have
[56:47] this if you have a dinner talk about why
[56:50] you're having the dinner if you exchange
[56:53] gifts talk about why you exchange gifts
[56:55] no matter where you are if you're with
[56:58] your friends if you have a gifts
[57:00] exchange or whatever it is mention Jesus
[57:03] Christ because that's why we do it
[57:05] otherwise it's
[57:08] meaningless I'm talking
[57:11] anytime if you have a gift exchange at
[57:14] work talk about Jesus if you have the
[57:17] day
[57:20] off if you have the day off give Jesus
[57:24] credit for it
[57:26] and if you have to work give Jesus
[57:28] credit for it because you have a
[57:32] job Jesus gets credit for it
[57:36] all I was
[57:39] amazed in reading the birth of
[57:44] Christ how many people actually knew the
[57:49] importance of when Jesus was born when
[57:53] he was first born they were celebr
[57:56] celebrating
[57:58] Christmas before Christ was even born
[58:02] months before Jesus was born they were
[58:04] giving God praise for it they knew what
[58:08] Christmas was and we'll read here in
[58:13] Luke how
[58:16] great this Revelation was on these
[58:19] people we know the story Jesus had a
[58:23] cousin named John the
[58:25] Baptist John the Baptist had a mom
[58:30] Elizabeth dad Zachariah dad was a
[58:33] priest
[58:35] and John was before he was even born
[58:42] Zachariah obviously they were old they
[58:45] couldn't have children Zachariah it was
[58:48] his time to to give the um to give the
[58:51] offering and he goes in and to I believe
[58:55] burn incense he goes in
[58:57] behind private area and the angel
[59:02] Gabriel comes down and tells him that
[59:05] he's going to have a son and then this
[59:08] this boy is going to be
[59:09] great
[59:11] Zachariah wondered how this could
[59:14] be and you can imagine an angel coming
[59:17] to you and saying that this is going to
[59:21] happen and then somebody argues with you
[59:25] it's like hey
[59:27] I'm an
[59:28] angel and you're saying that these
[59:30] things I came to you to talk to you and
[59:32] you're saying that these things can't
[59:35] happen so he says I am Gabriel who comes
[59:38] comes from the presence of God you will
[59:40] not
[59:41] speak until this boy is born so then
[59:46] Zachariah can't talk anymore he comes
[59:49] out the people are um wondering what's
[59:52] going on they thought he saw a vision or
[59:53] whatever and and um his his wife
[59:58] Elizabeth she's starts expecting she
[1:00:01] becomes pregnant she's she's expecting
[1:00:03] and
[1:00:04] then the same Angel goes over to Mary
[1:00:09] and to Joseph and tells them that you
[1:00:12] are going to have a son in different
[1:00:13] times that you are going to have a son
[1:00:17] that you're going to call his name
[1:00:19] Jesus so you have over here you have
[1:00:21] Mary and Joseph you have over here you
[1:00:24] have Elizabeth and Zachariah that sets
[1:00:27] the stage for Luke chapter 1 let's start
[1:00:32] with
[1:00:33] verse
[1:00:44] 41 this will show us this great
[1:00:49] Revelation that these people had
[1:00:57] Luke 1:
[1:01:03] 41 says this and it came to pass that
[1:01:07] when Elizabeth heard the salutation of
[1:01:10] Mary so
[1:01:11] Mary she's expecting she gets up and she
[1:01:14] leaves town and she goes and stays with
[1:01:18] her cousin
[1:01:20] Elizabeth and it came to pass that when
[1:01:22] Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary
[1:01:25] so Mary greets
[1:01:28] and the Babe the Babe leaped in her womb
[1:01:32] and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy
[1:01:35] Ghost if you listen to that so she's
[1:01:38] there Mary greets Elizabeth then this
[1:01:41] baby jumps in her womb that she had
[1:01:44] there I believe the child was probably I
[1:01:48] know between three and six months old
[1:01:50] this baby leaps in her womb so Mary and
[1:01:53] you'll see in the next verses Mary must
[1:01:56] have told Elizabeth the testimony of
[1:01:59] what happened to
[1:02:00] Mary and Elizabeth was so so grateful
[1:02:05] the Holy Spirit comes down and remember
[1:02:08] it says that John the Baptist was was
[1:02:11] filled with the Holy Ghost I wonder if
[1:02:14] this was the very moment that he was
[1:02:16] filled with the Holy Spirit in his
[1:02:19] mother's womb it says that he would be
[1:02:21] filled with the Holy Ghost in his
[1:02:22] mother's womb I wonder if this is the
[1:02:24] moment because he jumped and he shouted
[1:02:25] even inside her
[1:02:28] belly and she
[1:02:31] spake Elizabeth speaking and she spake
[1:02:34] with a loud voice and said blessed art
[1:02:36] thou among women and blessed is the
[1:02:39] fruit of thy
[1:02:41] womb and whence is this to me that the
[1:02:44] mother of my Lord should come to me look
[1:02:49] at the Revelation that Elizabeth
[1:02:52] had Mary
[1:02:56] who am I that the mother the child that
[1:03:00] you're going to have the mother of my
[1:03:03] Lord would come to me who am
[1:03:07] I and there's
[1:03:13] Mary for lo as soon as the voice of thy
[1:03:17] salutation sounded in my ears The Babe
[1:03:21] leaped in my womb for joy and blessed is
[1:03:24] she that believes for there shall be a
[1:03:27] performance of these things which were
[1:03:29] told her from the Lord so she knew
[1:03:34] Elizabeth knew and she started
[1:03:36] celebrating Christmas right there seeing
[1:03:39] I'm not worthy that you would come
[1:03:41] because this baby that's born in your
[1:03:44] womb is my
[1:03:46] Lord that's going to be born out of your
[1:03:48] womb is my
[1:03:50] Lord then the Holy Spirit comes down on
[1:03:54] Mary and she breaks into this prophetic
[1:03:58] song and Mary said listen to what Mary
[1:04:02] is is glorifying God worth and Mary said
[1:04:05] my soul doth magnify the Lord and my
[1:04:08] spirit hath rejoiced in God my savior
[1:04:11] for Heath regarded the lowest state of
[1:04:13] his handmaiden for behold from the hence
[1:04:16] from hence forth all generations shall
[1:04:19] call me blessed Mary is celebrating
[1:04:24] Christmas before this baby's born she's
[1:04:27] saying I'm going to give birth to God in
[1:04:30] flesh and from this day forward
[1:04:33] everybody's going to call me
[1:04:35] blessed for
[1:04:37] he that is mighty hath done to me great
[1:04:41] things and holy is his
[1:04:44] name and his Mercy is on them that fear
[1:04:47] Him from generation to generation he has
[1:04:50] showed strength with his arm he has
[1:04:52] scattered the proud in the imagination
[1:04:54] of their hearts he had put down the
[1:04:56] mighty from their seats and exalted them
[1:04:59] of low
[1:05:00] degree a prophetic voice coming from the
[1:05:06] mother the prophetic voice saying that
[1:05:09] he has exalted those of low degree you
[1:05:11] saw the the the the Shepherds that were
[1:05:14] here the Shepherds were the lowest of
[1:05:17] the
[1:05:19] low and yet they were the first
[1:05:23] witnesses to the great king
[1:05:26] that was
[1:05:28] born he hath filled the Hungry with good
[1:05:31] things and the rich he has sent empty
[1:05:34] away he hath helped his servant Israel
[1:05:39] in remembrance of his Mercy as he spake

[1:30:38] reputation and took upon him the form of
[1:30:41] a servant and he and was made in the
[1:30:44] likeness of men not only made in the
