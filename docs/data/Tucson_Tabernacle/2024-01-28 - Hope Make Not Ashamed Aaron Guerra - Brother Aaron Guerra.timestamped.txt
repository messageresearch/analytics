[37:30] through said there's many of those great
[37:33] crocodile and things along the banks and
[37:35] said they begin to scream out to this
[37:37] devil Rock to turn their boat over said
[37:40] brother brandom I don't know how much
[37:41] you believe this but said our boat begin
[37:44] rocking now
[37:46] look a devil has a power that's right
[37:50] now I believe just as much a personal
[37:52] devil as I know there's a God there's
[37:54] because God said there was and there the
[37:57] boat began to rock and he said my wife
[38:00] got off of the seat back there in the
[38:02] stern and S down raised up her hands and
[38:05] said father dear you sent us over here
[38:08] now help us will you said they come on
[38:11] by The Rock went on to the shore and
[38:15] said when they landed said oh there was
[38:17] a all of the natives was down there and
[38:19] they was making a big screaming beating
[38:21] those Tom Toms and things said after a
[38:24] bit while they heard him screaming again
[38:27] and they were screaming through this
[38:29] rock to turn over these boys that were
[38:31] coming somewhat 100 yards behind them
[38:34] coming in and said brother Brandon their
[38:37] boat turned over a crocodile turned
[38:39] their boat over something out there and
[38:41] there was their boys right out there
[38:44] among those
[38:46] crocodiles and the mother started
[38:47] weeping in the church when they was
[38:49] telling it she said oh I just knew that
[38:52] they just pull those boys apart and said
[38:55] dad and I put our arms around around one
[38:56] another and fell down on the bank and
[38:58] begin cre screaming to God with all of
[39:01] our heart to save our boys and know that
[39:04] God had sent us down there and said
[39:06] these people went into a frantic cutting
[39:08] themselves and everything because their
[39:10] God had overcome their God seemingly
[39:12] they were screaming and jumping around
[39:14] said expecting anytime to field a big uh
[39:17] Stone Hammer maybe to MH through their
[39:20] skull and kill him as it was kneeling
[39:22] there praying so all at once everything
[39:24] got quiet they didn't know what would
[39:27] happened so they listened closely and
[39:29] all thing they could hear them was the
[39:30] waves coming into the shore so directly
[39:33] they begin to hear some singing they
[39:35] looked out and said these boys were
[39:37] lined up and every one of them perfectly
[39:39] in harmony swimming right through those
[39:41] crocodile singing Rock of
[39:45] Ages CL for
[39:48] me let me
[39:50] hide myself and thee I'm telling you
[39:54] brother the same God that could close
[39:57] the lion's mouth and the Dan with Daniel
[39:59] can C close the crocodile's mouth he's
[40:02] the same God today that he was back in
[40:05] those days yes he
[40:07] is then he said when they was converted
[40:10] if they that People Prayed day and night
[40:12] just happy and he was back there taking
[40:15] up money and I gave him all I had try to
[40:18] build a little church down there and so
[40:20] forth they got them started how they
[40:23] prayed and God gave them rain and what
[40:25] all more things to take them faing there
[40:27] oh what a truth it is to go and to work
[40:31] for our Lord in other fields amen
[40:35] amen God can take any
[40:38] situation and turn it
[40:41] around and I wanted to play that because
[40:44] sometimes we wonder God where are
[40:46] you why am I going through this why does
[40:50] it look so difficult why does it look so
[40:54] hard but every power is subject to his
[40:57] power amen and you're one of his you're
[41:02] his redeemed amen you're his you're the
[41:04] reason why he went to
[41:07] Calvary shall you know he watches over
[41:10] you
[41:12] amen so in Proverbs chapter
[41:16] 3 verses 5 and six very very familiar
[41:20] scriptures trust in the Lord with all
[41:23] thine heart and lean not unto your thine
[41:27] own understanding in all thy ways
[41:31] acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy
[41:35] paths and that's nothing but the truth
[41:37] in all thy ways acknowledge Him and you
[41:42] know in in the morning when you get
[41:45] up and it sometimes for some of you it's
[41:49] it's very early in the morning start
[41:50] your day some not as early but whenever
[41:53] it is that you get started and you're
[41:55] you acknowledge Him say Lord I commit my
[41:59] way my day all of this into your hands I
[42:03] Surrender it to you you know and and
[42:06] sometimes you it might you might
[42:07] question you might wonder why I'm in
[42:10] this am I in this
[42:12] situation and God has a purpose in a way
[42:16] and a work to do
[42:18] show and as I was saying brother brother
[42:21] Daniel spoke on worshiping at the the
[42:23] altar of
[42:25] fear
[42:26] and you would say I would never do that
[42:28] but when you give way to your fears
[42:30] that's what you're doing you're giving
[42:32] you're you're lifting it above God Amen
[42:36] and we're all subject to fear yeah um
[42:41] when something bangs you're asleep and
[42:43] something bangs loudly at night and
[42:45] startles you
[42:46] awake I don't think most of us get up oh
[42:49] well I'll just go see what that
[42:51] is in fact it's usually nudging the
[42:54] other the husband or the wife go see see
[42:56] go see yourself you
[42:58] know it it's a it's a startling but as
[43:01] quickly as you can you say okay I'm
[43:03] going to go you get a light you turn on
[43:04] all the lights to where you get to where
[43:07] and you come back in it it's it's part
[43:09] of it's the nature of Fallen
[43:12] man but you know what the angel said to
[43:15] to little Mary Don't Fear do not
[43:18] fear Satan Works through fear amen God
[43:22] works through love and love is a comfort
[43:26] love is a strength Love is Everything is
[43:29] if God is love God is everything
[43:32] anything you need out of God is
[43:34] there so lean not to your own
[43:37] understanding he says and in all things
[43:40] acknowledge
[43:41] Him well brother Aon I'm in in in a
[43:44] situation that I don't feel I can talk
[43:46] to
[43:47] God you can talk to God anywhere any
[43:50] place if you're willing to say Lord I'm
[43:52] sorry I need your
[43:55] help there's nowhere in the scripture
[43:57] says You must come to the altar at the
[44:00] church there as soon as you brother bam
[44:02] says you can get brother green just say
[44:03] as soon as you can get a hold of
[44:05] yourself turn around and acknowledge Him
[44:09] leaning not to your own understanding
[44:12] our understanding is limited our vision
[44:14] is
[44:15] limited you know but if we look to what
[44:17] God's word
[44:19] says there is there's a promise
[44:22] there as I was looking at this and as I
[44:25] was talking to brother Daniel after
[44:27] last last uh Sunday
[44:30] morning I had a couple of thoughts in my
[44:32] heart and he had asked me about
[44:34] ministering and sometimes you're do I go
[44:37] this way do I go this way and you don't
[44:40] want to get behind the pulpit and preach
[44:42] exact opposite of what the brother
[44:43] before you preach and seem to be you
[44:45] know and and you would want it to follow
[44:47] in continuity so I telling a little bit
[44:50] to brother Dan about what I was thinking
[44:53] about and he goes here and he hands me
[44:57] a a page and on there are two quotes he
[44:59] hadn't read yet he didn't get to Sunday
[45:03] morning and I looked at him I said well
[45:05] I got them for Sunday next Sunday
[45:10] night and and in in the first quote a
[45:14] personal experience with
[45:16] God I gave it to the brothers we'll read
[45:19] it a personal experience with
[45:24] God not your neighbor 's experience not
[45:26] your father's experience not the
[45:28] pastor's experience but your experience
[45:31] with
[45:32] God so if you can get that first one up
[45:35] there they can follow
[45:39] along from the message a personal
[45:41] experience with God preached in
[45:45] 54 he says just a minute sir and these
[45:49] were the quotes of brother Daniel had
[45:51] okay like I have him here just a minute
[45:54] sir an evil spirit went from the man and
[45:57] I seen it rise somewhere else just he
[46:01] says oh kind heavenly father who knows
[46:03] all things and then he says he it's it's
[46:06] your faith has saved you lady you have
[46:09] been nervously broken down and you have
[46:11] been told a lie by Satan Satan has told
[46:15] you that you have committed the
[46:17] unpardonable sin and you cannot be
[46:21] forgiven your sins are forgiven you
[46:24] sister Jesus Christ makes you whole
[46:27] stand up on your feet and accept that
[46:29] now as God's blessings raise up your
[46:32] hands and stand up and give him
[46:34] praise was there something wrong with
[46:36] this man there Satan thought he would
[46:38] get by with that but he couldn't do it
[46:40] you're both delivered God bless you go
[46:43] on your road rejoicing there's an angel
[46:45] of the Lord standing around them both
[46:48] God be praised and
[46:50] blessed a prophet could see
[46:53] this it's it's got a special place for
[46:55] those those things but it was for that
[46:57] man and for that lady it wasn't for
[47:00] brother brandom you understand and then
[47:04] in question and
[47:05] answers
[47:08] 62 this is a question I have lived I
[47:11] have lived many years in sin until I
[47:13] found the Lord please brother brandom I
[47:15] have sinned again and I am not worthy to
[47:18] come to you in this holy place please
[47:20] tell me if I can be restored whole again
[47:25] yes
[47:26] you have not sinned my friend so far in
[47:29] God but what you could be
[47:31] restored if you had sinned so far that
[47:34] you could not be restored you would
[47:36] never want to be restored
[47:39] see he said but as long as there's
[47:42] something dealing with your heart you're
[47:44] still in line of
[47:46] restoration guilty of the least is
[47:49] guilty of the whole I have now here's
[47:51] brother Brown saying I have sinned many
[47:52] times every day every one of us do
[47:54] things we don't don't want to do that's
[47:58] true if you'll be honest that's true
[48:01] it's in it's it's in our heart you don't
[48:04] want to be that way you wouldn't ask a
[48:06] question see that itself a proof that
[48:09] God is still dealing with you you've
[48:11] probably gotten nervous probably Satan
[48:13] telling you that you can't be restored
[48:15] he's lying certainly he is because look
[48:19] if there's a deep deep calling there's
[48:21] got to be a deep deep to respond to the
[48:23] call if there's a hunger for
[48:27] it and I'm glad when something in my
[48:29] heart says I I I need forgiveness I need
[48:33] help I need changing I need cleansing
[48:35] there's still there something there for
[48:37] you to reach out to and you know there's
[48:41] some days that I could leap over a wall
[48:44] and run through a
[48:45] troop and there are some days that I'm
[48:47] hiding in the corner with
[48:49] fear if we'll be honest there are days
[48:51] like that saying Lord where are you
[48:54] Gideon said if God be for us then where
[48:56] are the
[48:58] Miracles you know what he was he was
[49:00] hiding he he he was he was threshing the
[49:03] wheat hiding because the enemy had kept
[49:05] coming stealing it but he called out to
[49:08] God he said where are
[49:13] you and then Abraham and his seed after
[49:17] him says do you see it don't look at
[49:20] yourself look at your
[49:23] sacrifice God don't look at you he looks
[49:25] at your sacrifice which is Christ don't
[49:28] look at yourself I'm not worthy you're
[49:31] not worthy nobody's worthy but he is the
[49:33] one I'm not counting on what I've done
[49:37] or what I am I'd never make it but
[49:39] looking to what he's done that's where
[49:41] I'm trusting what he's done He's My
[49:46] Sacrifice I'm not worthy of healing no
[49:49] no sir Lord I ought to have died long
[49:51] ago ought to have never been born but I
[49:53] live I got eternal life I'm going to to
[49:55] Heaven why because he done it for me he
[49:58] was the one he took my place then he
[50:01] said I was knock needed cross-eyed in
[50:03] every kind of condition but he took my
[50:06] place spiritually speaking I was all
[50:09] twisted up and all messed up but he took
[50:11] my place so he makes me a perfect Son of
[50:15] God a perfect daughter of God the word
[50:18] perfect there is whole complete missing
[50:21] nothing we take the word perfect and we
[50:24] look at ourselves and we try to say make
[50:26] no mistakes no have no run thoughts no
[50:28] fail that's not what he's talking about
[50:31] you have everything in you to make it
[50:34] home you are complete says a perfect
[50:37] daughter of God his sacrifice did it not
[50:40] mine I had nothing to do with
[50:43] it if we had something to do with it
[50:46] we'd make a mess out of
[50:50] it this one here we maybe we'll we read
[50:53] it at the end here
[50:58] now as I was I was looking into some of
[51:00] some of these some scriptures and things
[51:03] and some of the examples in the
[51:05] scripture and the scripture are written
[51:06] are for our
[51:08] example that's why the detailed life of
[51:11] many is given that's why you go to the
[51:13] Old Testament you see their failures and
[51:16] their victories because if the Bible was
[51:19] only written in about everybody's
[51:22] Victory we'd have a hard time with it
[51:25] because we try to measure up exactly to
[51:28] that but because God shows both sides
[51:31] you could say hey I have hope I have a
[51:35] promise look at Paul look at Peter look
[51:38] at what they did but look where they
[51:39] ended up
[51:40] at and I have a hope he
[51:43] says now sometimes in the message hope
[51:47] is not a um not using your name sister
[51:50] hope the word hope is sometimes people
[51:54] say well hope is is not
[51:56] Faith have you ever written and looked
[51:59] into what Biblical hope is when the
[52:02] Bible is being using the word hope it is
[52:04] used quite a few times in the
[52:09] Bible the The Hope description in the
[52:11] biblical hope is The Confident
[52:15] expectation that God will fulfill his
[52:18] promises to
[52:20] us it's not I hope so I'm barely oh God
[52:24] I hope so
[52:26] it's I know therefore I am resting my
[52:28] Hope on your promises and what you are
[52:31] able more than able to do it is based on
[52:35] what God has done for us in the past and
[52:39] what he will do in the future that same
[52:42] God that delivered me here will deliver
[52:44] me there that same God that healed me
[52:46] here will he heal me here it doesn't
[52:51] change it said it's also it's not a
[52:56] passive thing or a static thing but it's
[52:59] Dynamic active directive and life
[53:02] sustaining
[53:04] Force that's
[53:06] biblical
[53:09] hope hope is a sense and it's that Faith
[53:13] sense of trust in Jesus and his saving
[53:17] work so when you get to look in in in in
[53:20] the scripture
[53:22] sometimes you find that and this
[53:24] lamentation the Prophet
[53:28] Jeremiah Lamentations 3: 18-
[53:34] 26 I just I I I pulled up the word hope
[53:37] in the Bible how many times it comes up
[53:40] and it comes up quite often and I said
[53:44] my strength and my hope is perished from
[53:47] the
[53:48] Lord My Hope and my strength is perished
[53:52] from the Lord I think Jeremiah began to
[53:55] to look at his situation how he was
[53:57] feeling and he said oh I have no
[53:59] strength he's not saying that God didn't
[54:01] have it he just couldn't see it he says
[54:05] remembering mine Affliction and mine
[54:07] Misery the wormwood and the gall he
[54:11] says my soul has them still in
[54:14] remembrance and is humbled in
[54:18] me here's Jeremiah
[54:20] saying all this is just governing me
[54:23] it's it it's all just just suffocating
[54:26] me it just seems to be taking me over
[54:29] but then he said then I recall to my
[54:32] mind this I recall to my mind therefore
[54:36] have I
[54:39] hope it is of the Lord's mercies that we
[54:42] are not consumed because of his
[54:45] compassion because his compassions fail
[54:47] not they are new every morning great is
[54:52] thy
[54:54] faithfulness
[54:55] now I know every one of you I can
[54:58] honestly and I can say with an assurance
[55:00] woke up this
[55:02] morning you're all
[55:05] here so this morning you had new
[55:08] mercies waiting for
[55:11] you that's what that's what he says it
[55:13] it's new mercies they they are new every
[55:16] morning it they're renewed they're
[55:19] refreshed Great Is Thy
[55:22] Faithfulness the Lord is my portion
[55:25] sayith my soul therefore I will have I
[55:28] will hope in him I will have my
[55:30] expectation it is in him the Lord is
[55:34] good unto them that wait for him to the
[55:37] soul that seeketh it is good that a man
[55:40] should both hope and quietly wait for
[55:43] the Salvation of the
[55:45] Lord and you look at that word
[55:48] quietly it's what we tell our
[55:51] grandchildren sh go play quietly over
[55:54] there please wake no what are you doing
[55:57] when you're quiet you're not stirred up
[55:59] in
[56:00] yourself you're resting you're not you
[56:04] know bringing agitating everything I
[56:06] will quietly I will be at rest I will be
[56:09] at peace while God is doing this
[56:12] work I will praise him I will give him
[56:15] honor I will give him glory quietly
[56:18] doesn't mean you can't praise him it's
[56:20] say you're at rest about it this is what
[56:22] Jeremiah says it is good that a man
[56:25] should both hope and quietly wait for
[56:28] the Salvation of the Lord because God
[56:30] has promised
[56:35] that and you
[56:38] know sometimes you have to do this and
[56:41] then I recall to my mind therefore have
[56:45] I
[56:48] hope sometimes I just have to remember
[56:50] you remember brother Brandon would say
[56:51] that I had to remind myself what God had
[56:55] done for
[56:56] me and Satan would begin to talk to him
[56:59] and begin to want to to to bring him
[57:00] down and he would say then he'd say ah
[57:02] but who healed that one ah but who did
[57:05] that one who took care of that situation
[57:07] who and he said I would begin to
[57:09] encourage
[57:11] myself I would begin to strengthen
[57:14] myself I've I've shared this with you
[57:18] and
[57:20] um when I was in that that one house
[57:22] working and they had this music on and
[57:25] that music got stuck in my head the
[57:26] words and all and I just couldn't break
[57:29] it mostly one time you walk out of the
[57:31] house and I'm going to work at another
[57:33] house the music has turned off I don't
[57:35] hear it anymore it just was oh it felt
[57:37] like something was poking me and I said
[57:40] God can you help me with this and that
[57:43] song think about his love think about
[57:45] his goodness just started coming right
[57:47] through
[57:48] me I said he was singing it to me that's
[57:51] how I felt it was and you know what
[57:54] every time this has happened again I've
[57:56] just gone right back to that song and
[57:57] encouraged myself and you know what that
[58:00] does it just makes the rest of it go
[58:02] away I'm not turning that music on I
[58:05] walked into a situation with that but
[58:07] greater is he that is in me than he that
[58:10] is in the world that's his
[58:13] promise so he says this I recall to my
[58:17] mind you know it is both good it should
[58:21] both hope and quietly wait quietly again
[58:24] mean meaning not in in frustration all
[58:28] but being at rest Lord you said Lord you
[58:31] will you and and it's it's amazing how
[58:34] many things if you'll go back into the
[58:37] scriptures there were so many different
[58:38] ways to see how people had to do that
[58:42] great prophets you can look at it in the
[58:44] thing uh um Elijah Lord I'm the last one
[58:49] there's nobody else serving you but me
[58:50] and God I like this God said there's
[58:53] 7,000 that have not bowed their
[58:56] knees he didn't said I know I have a
[59:00] bunch he knew exactly how many there
[59:02] were he was very he's got you name he's
[59:05] got you numbered he knows who you are
[59:06] where you are he can call you by
[59:11] name so this hope and you know you look
[59:15] and and I I just wrote down a few of
[59:17] these maybe would encourage
[59:19] you let's see where I put
[59:23] it but you think of about Peter you
[59:25] think about some of these men that that
[59:28] had a uh you know their their their
[59:31] their stories are written in the Bible
[59:33] for our
[59:35] example Peter who uh who
[59:38] struggled a man who said I will not
[59:41] forsake thee I'll never leave you I'll
[59:43] never depart in fact I'll I'll go hang
[59:45] on the cross with
[59:49] you let's start with some of the
[59:51] disciples here and I just I'm not going
[59:53] to quote the actual script scriptures
[59:55] I'm just going to tape or some of them
[59:56] and just say what what he did and and
[59:58] look at this and Jesus here in the
[1:00:01] scripture says and when he entered into
[1:00:03] a ship his disciples followed him and
[1:00:05] behold there arose a great Tempest in
[1:00:07] the sea in so much that the ship was
[1:00:09] covered with the ways but he was
[1:00:12] asleep now if your savior is asleep in
[1:00:15] the boat with
[1:00:18] you the captain of the ship is asleep in
[1:00:20] the boat and resting
[1:00:22] peacefully I would think that would say
[1:00:24] everything is
[1:00:26] okay if the captain of the ship the
[1:00:29] pilot of the ship is nervous and anxious
[1:00:31] and fretting then I would say the whole
[1:00:32] crew is going to be the same way but if
[1:00:35] Jesus is resting is your ship and you're
[1:00:37] crossing the sea I think you can be at
[1:00:39] rest
[1:00:40] too he
[1:00:43] says and the disciples came to him and
[1:00:46] awoke him and saying Lord save us we
[1:00:48] perish and he said of the unto them why
[1:00:51] are you so fearful oh ye of little faith
[1:00:55] then he arose and rebuked the winds and
[1:00:57] the Sea and there was a great calm but
[1:01:01] the men Marvel saying what manner of man
[1:01:03] is this that even the winds and the Sea
[1:01:06] obey
[1:01:08] him well he's still the
[1:01:11] same there were some boys that got
[1:01:14] dumped into the water with
[1:01:16] crocodiles and he said don't touch
[1:01:19] them they're doing my work
[1:01:22] here now we just read those scriptures
[1:01:26] there Peter says to the Lord and I'm I'm
[1:01:29] taking just different portions here then
[1:01:31] Peter said Lo we have left
[1:01:34] all and followed
[1:01:36] thee we know Peter didn't have any
[1:01:39] trouble speaking
[1:01:40] out he said and then in different parts
[1:01:44] again he
[1:01:45] said and he said unto them but whom say
[1:01:48] ye that I am Peter answered said Thou
[1:01:50] Art the Christ of
[1:01:52] God and that's when Jesus chur blessed
[1:01:55] art thou Simon barjona because my father
[1:01:58] has revealed this to you this is not not
[1:02:01] something you learn earned or worked for
[1:02:03] but God has made it real to
[1:02:05] you so that made Peter
[1:02:08] superhuman he was almost oh God you know
[1:02:11] but no
[1:02:13] watch then not too long down from there
[1:02:15] Peter answered and said unto him though
[1:02:17] all men shall be offended because of
[1:02:19] thee yet I will I never be
[1:02:23] offended
[1:02:24] you've read the
[1:02:28] scriptures and then you know Jesus is
[1:02:30] being
[1:02:31] crucified and there's some Maiden that
[1:02:34] comes and
[1:02:35] identifies and points out at Peter he
[1:02:37] said you're one of them and about the
[1:02:39] space of one hour after another company
[1:02:42] affirm saying of a truth this fellow
[1:02:45] also was with him for he is a Galilean
[1:02:48] and Peter said man I know not what thou
[1:02:52] sayest the same Peter that said Thou Art
[1:02:55] the Christ the son of the Living God and
[1:02:58] immediately while he yet spake the
[1:03:00] crew and the Lord turned and looked upon
[1:03:02] Peter and Peter remembered the words of
[1:03:06] the Lord and how he said unto him before
[1:03:09] the cockro Thou shalt deny me the r and
[1:03:12] Peter went out and wept
[1:03:15] bitterly I have failed I'm no good I'm
[1:03:20] useless I don't have a
[1:03:23] chance and there was Resurrection
[1:03:26] morning right after
[1:03:28] that and if it wasn't for the
[1:03:30] resurrection where would we be
[1:03:33] today but on Resurrection morning he
[1:03:36] tells his disciples or the the ones that
[1:03:39] were there he says but but go your
[1:03:41] way tell his disciples and
[1:03:48] Peter specifically said and Peter the
[1:03:52] one who had just Den denied him call him
[1:03:56] tell him that he goeth before you into
[1:04:00] Galilee there ye shall see him as he
[1:04:04] said unto
[1:04:09] you I don't know who I'm talking to
[1:04:11] today maybe somebody listening on
[1:04:14] somebody watching maybe somebody
[1:04:16] here that in your life you wondered have
[1:04:19] I denied him have I turned my back on
[1:04:22] him does he still care for
[1:04:26] me remember Peter literally said he
[1:04:29] cursed he said I don't know that man
[1:04:32] turned his back on him and then he tells
[1:04:34] him tell his disciples and
[1:04:39] Peter to meet me I'm going to meet
[1:04:43] them here's Daniel and the three Hebrew
[1:04:48] boys Nebuchadnezzar spake unto them and
[1:04:51] said Is it true oh Shadrach Meshach and
[1:04:53] Abednego
[1:04:55] do not ye serve my gods nor worship the
[1:04:57] golden image which I have set
[1:04:59] up and they answered if it be so our God
[1:05:03] whom we serve is is able to Deliver Us
[1:05:05] From The Burning Fire
[1:05:07] furnace and he will deliver us out of
[1:05:09] thine hand O King but if not be it known
[1:05:13] unto thee Oh King what we will what that
[1:05:16] we will not serve thy Gods nor worship
[1:05:19] the golden image which thou has set up
[1:05:22] he tried to hit him with fear
[1:05:24] make him
[1:05:26] afraid and then after they're thrown
[1:05:28] into the the furnace and Nebuchadnezzar
[1:05:30] the King was astonished and Rose up in
[1:05:32] the haste and spake unto the his
[1:05:34] counselors did not we cast three men
[1:05:37] Bound in the midst of the fire they
[1:05:38] answered and said to the king true oh
[1:05:41] King oh and I like this answer that
[1:05:43] answered and said lo I see four men
[1:05:47] loose walking in the midst of fire and
[1:05:51] they have no hurt and the form of the
[1:05:53] fourth is is like the Son of
[1:05:58] God they said we won't deny you and even
[1:06:01] if he won't come and rescue me I'm still
[1:06:04] not going to deny
[1:06:07] him he didn't deny you when you failed
[1:06:10] he didn't deny you when you were living
[1:06:12] in sin he didn't deny you when he said
[1:06:16] come on unto me and I'll give you
[1:06:21] rest you could go through the scriptures
[1:06:24] and
[1:06:25] find every example
[1:06:28] Paul who had those put to
[1:06:31] death for the way they were serving
[1:06:35] God and you know what Paul had to live
[1:06:37] with himself after
[1:06:39] that oh miserable man that I am who
[1:06:43] shall deliver me I find myself wanting
[1:06:46] to do this but doing this instead with
[1:06:50] my you know he struggling through this
[1:06:53] why imagine yourself struggling with
[1:06:56] that that you had your neighbor put to
[1:06:58] death because they didn't believe the
[1:07:00] way you
[1:07:03] believed you had your fellow countrymen
[1:07:06] put to death because they were believing
[1:07:09] different than the law of
[1:07:11] Moses and yet this same God that they
[1:07:15] were serving has now called you to be
[1:07:17] his
[1:07:19] Prophet this same God now has called you
[1:07:24] to be a living testimony of a living
[1:07:27] God amongst those who at maybe at one
[1:07:30] time you served Satan with or you drew
[1:07:34] back on but today he calls you and said
[1:07:37] you're my
[1:07:38] light he has confidence in
[1:07:45] you in Romans chapter
[1:07:49] 5 verses
[1:07:52] 1-5
[1:07:57] therefore being justified by faith we
[1:08:00] have peace with God through our Lord
[1:08:03] Jesus
[1:08:04] Christ peace is the absence of
[1:08:09] War which is the absence of
[1:08:14] fear right now there's so much going on
[1:08:17] all over the
[1:08:19] world every day if you look at the news
[1:08:22] something else is happening happening
[1:08:25] battles Wars There Are People Dying
[1:08:27] there are people
[1:08:30] suffering but he tells us don't be
[1:08:32] afraid don't have
[1:08:38] fear and if you pay too much attention
[1:08:41] to the
[1:08:42] news and if you look at every channel of
[1:08:45] the news you'll get a different uh
[1:08:47] interpretation or version of the news
[1:08:49] this one will blame it on that one and
[1:08:50] that one will blame it I know which one
[1:08:52] is to blame
[1:08:54] there is only one that is to blame and
[1:08:56] that's
[1:08:57] Satan and there is only one to get honor
[1:09:00] and glory and that's Christ that's
[1:09:03] God he
[1:09:05] says by whom we also have access by
[1:09:08] faith into the grace wherein we stand
[1:09:11] and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God
[1:09:15] and again if you think of that word hope
[1:09:18] with an
[1:09:19] anticipation wi with a draw with a pull
[1:09:22] towards and not only so but we glory in
[1:09:25] tribulations also knowing that
[1:09:28] tribulation worketh
[1:09:32] patience Lord I want patience and would
[1:09:34] you please give it to me right
[1:09:37] now because I need to be patient right
[1:09:40] about now no patience has come through
[1:09:43] tempting and trying and
[1:09:45] working they that weigh upon the Lord
[1:09:49] shall renew their
[1:09:52] strength and and patience
[1:09:56] experience how do you gain experience by
[1:10:00] reading a
[1:10:02] book by watching somebody
[1:10:05] else um brother no you're laying on the
[1:10:08] table and you need heart
[1:10:11] surgery and you hear the doctors talking
[1:10:14] and you hear one say to the other have
[1:10:16] you done this before he said no but I
[1:10:18] read the
[1:10:19] book no but I watch another doctor do it
[1:10:24] no you want to hear oh I've done
[1:10:26] hundreds of these this is not the first
[1:10:30] one when you're talking to God you're
[1:10:33] talking the one that lived this life
[1:10:35] already the one who knows every ins and
[1:10:38] out about it with
[1:10:42] patience
[1:10:44] experience he tabernacled himself in a
[1:10:47] body of Flesh so he could understand
[1:10:49] your feelings be touched by the feeling
[1:10:51] of our
[1:10:52] infirmities an experience worketh a hope
[1:10:56] an
[1:10:57] expectation he says and hope this
[1:11:01] expectation this desire maketh not
[1:11:04] ashamed because the love of God is shed
[1:11:07] abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
[1:11:09] which is given to
[1:11:11] us it make us not ashamed nothing you
[1:11:14] have to be embarrassed about nothing
[1:11:17] that you would say well I tried it but
[1:11:18] it didn't work I don't know you can you
[1:11:20] can say he is
[1:11:22] faithful he never fails he never misses
[1:11:25] he's right on
[1:11:33] time Romans chapter 15 verse
[1:11:39] 13 and now the god of
[1:11:43] hope this God that will meet your
[1:11:45] expectations your desire your earnest
[1:11:47] desire may this God fill you with all
[1:11:50] joy and peace in believing that you may
[1:11:54] abound in hope that you may abound that
[1:11:56] this will be the drive within you I know
[1:12:00] he can I know he will he's faithful he's
[1:12:04] proven himself over and
[1:12:05] over through the power of the Holy
[1:12:09] Ghost and I'm glad that Paul put that in
[1:12:12] there because it's not based on my
[1:12:14] ability to
[1:12:16] Hope but through the power of the Holy
[1:12:19] Ghost and that's Christ in you the hope
[1:12:22] of glory
[1:12:25] the expectation the desire the draw is
[1:12:28] Christ in
[1:12:31] you
[1:12:32] remember there is no fear in perfect
[1:12:36] love God is love greater is he that is
[1:12:40] in you than he that is in the
[1:12:43] world there is no fear fear is the
[1:12:46] absence of
[1:12:49] love you know it it's it's it's
[1:12:53] interesting interesting child and I I
[1:12:55] was watching lurel a little bit with the
[1:12:57] with her her sisters and stuff she's not
[1:13:00] afraid that they're going to drop her
[1:13:02] that they're they haven't done anything
[1:13:04] to do that to make her fear
[1:13:07] that now when they get a little bit
[1:13:09] older and they realize that Mom and
[1:13:11] Daddy are human and we do make
[1:13:14] mistakes sometimes they you know they
[1:13:16] might say well well we heard this a few
[1:13:19] times daddy said yes and mama said yes
[1:13:22] and they said they would but they never
[1:13:24] did we had intentions to do it and maybe
[1:13:27] it didn't
[1:13:28] happen but I know one who has never
[1:13:31] failed and never
[1:13:33] will there is no
[1:13:36] fear in perfect love God is love greater
[1:13:40] is he that is in you than he that is in
[1:13:43] the

[1:14:00] in a desperate
[1:14:01] situation you can get on your
[1:14:05] knees and you can call out to God for
[1:14:07] that person those who they are with a
[1:14:10] confidence that God
[1:14:12] hears and you know you may never get an
[1:14:15] answer back from that one that ask you
[1:14:18] to

[1:14:46] helping it didn't say God take the heal
[1:14:48] what God provided
[1:14:52] away
[1:14:54] it's that simple God provided a
[1:14:59] way uh
[1:15:01] Ephesians chapter
[1:15:03] 3 20 and
[1:15:08] 21 now unto him that is able to do
[1:15:11] exceeding abundantly above all that we
[1:15:14] ask or
[1:15:15] think according to the power that
[1:15:18] worketh in
[1:15:21] us it's in you
[1:15:24] it's Christ in you the hope of
[1:15:27] glory and when you have Christ you have
[1:15:29] every one of his attributes everything
[1:15:31] that he
[1:15:33] supplies he he walked he was born in
[1:15:36] flesh he grew up in the flesh so that he
[1:15:40] could understand the feeling of your
[1:15:42] infirmities the hurts the weaknesses the
[1:15:46] troubles the hard times the thoughts
[1:15:49] Satan as we even heard this this morning
[1:15:51] Satan came and tempted him
[1:15:55] he stopped and said but the word of God
[1:15:57] says but the word of God says but the
[1:16:00] word of God
[1:16:02] says it'll work for you
[1:16:05] too but God said God said God
[1:16:11] said he said to that woman where they
[1:16:13] caught her in
[1:16:14] adultery and he said to her where are
[1:16:17] thy condemners those that accuse you
[1:16:21] there are none when she looked around
[1:16:23] and he goes neither then do I accuse
[1:16:27] you he just said go and sin no
[1:16:30] more go and disbelieve no
[1:16:33] more and if you do make a mistake just
[1:16:36] say I'm sorry forgive me it it it's one
[1:16:41] of the easiest things if
[1:16:43] that that's the wrong way to say
[1:16:46] it if we'll do it it's one of the
[1:16:49] quickest ways to get peace and Harmony
[1:16:52] again just just make something
[1:16:55] right to say I'm
[1:16:58] sorry don't blame don't make an excuse
[1:17:01] to why you're sorry just say I'm sorry
[1:17:05] forgive
[1:17:06] me he says now unto him that is able to
[1:17:10] do abundantly above all exceeding
[1:17:12] abundantly above all that we ask or
[1:17:15] think according to the power that
[1:17:17] worketh in us again Christ in us the
[1:17:20] hope of glory now to him
[1:17:23] who is able to in full measure more than
[1:17:27] all our desires or
[1:17:29] thoughts through the power which is
[1:17:31] working in
[1:17:33] US sometimes I'll go to one of the other
[1:17:36] translations just to see how that is
[1:17:38] word sometimes I'll word it away in in
[1:17:41] in in the Bible and you go back and look
[1:17:43] at it and it just it'll just make it a
[1:17:47] little easier to understand he's able to
[1:17:49] do in full measure more than all our
[1:17:52] desires or thoughts through the power
[1:17:55] which is working in
[1:17:57] us it's not something that I have to get
[1:18:00] down and pray and say oh Lord send me
[1:18:01] the power send me it's in you
[1:18:04] already take that what you have and use
[1:18:10] it now here's
[1:18:14] something it it's that
[1:18:16] power and and in the most beautiful uh
[1:18:20] graduation or or how it increases when
[1:18:23] he has given us exceeding yay Abundant
[1:18:27] Blessings still we may ask for
[1:18:30] more and he is able to do
[1:18:33] it but we may think of more than we have
[1:18:38] asked how many have done
[1:18:41] that we think of more than what we'll
[1:18:43] actually
[1:18:45] ask God I know you're able you can heal
[1:18:48] you can lift up you can there it's
[1:18:50] unmeasurable what God can do
[1:18:54] brother Jordan the other day speaking
[1:18:56] about this the the sand on the sea and
[1:18:59] the stars and the comparison and all
[1:19:02] he's a God that created all
[1:19:04] that he knows the number of hairs on
[1:19:07] your
[1:19:09] head it was Sister Janna stro Corp and
[1:19:14] brother Al Peterson and we got a little
[1:19:17] bit of laugh of this and brother Al was
[1:19:19] saying
[1:19:21] about I think she was cutting his hair
[1:19:23] some and brother Al said something about
[1:19:26] him knowing the numbers of of hairs on
[1:19:29] my head and sister Jan said Dad I think
[1:19:32] there's so few left you could probably
[1:19:33] name them
[1:19:36] now got a little bit left but you know
[1:19:38] even the ones you've lost he knew
[1:19:41] those and when we get to the other
[1:19:44] side brother Braham says something
[1:19:47] between 19 and 21 years
[1:19:49] old a full head of hair
[1:19:53] not needing a haircut once a month and
[1:19:56] all those other things that go with life
[1:19:59] today but he
[1:20:01] says more but we may think of more than
[1:20:05] we have
[1:20:06] asked he knows our thoughts he is able
[1:20:09] to do this also yay and above all this
[1:20:13] above all we ask above all we can think
[1:20:16] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[1:20:19] can either ask or think
[1:20:25] you'll never delete you'll never
[1:20:29] exhaust he is more than
[1:20:32] able and then Paul says unto him be
[1:20:35] glory in the church by Christ Jesus
[1:20:38] throughout all ages World Without End
[1:20:44] amen amen it is finished thus sayeth the
[1:20:48] Lord to think of this this almighty God
[1:20:53] that would come and say I love
[1:20:56] them Father I will not lose a single one
[1:20:59] of
[1:21:00] them they're number they're listed on
[1:21:03] the palm of my hands and not a single
[1:21:05] one of them will be
[1:21:10] lost sometimes we get a little
[1:21:12] disappointed we get a little bit
[1:21:15] frustrated we get a little bit impatient
[1:21:18] because we want it
[1:21:20] now I've got to have it now I need it
[1:21:23] right now God knows your
[1:21:26] situation he knows what's best for
[1:21:29] you and sometimes when you give a child
[1:21:32] everything when they that they want when
[1:21:35] they want it you create a spoiled
[1:21:39] child the the child that will embarrass
[1:21:41] you at the
[1:21:44] store the child that will will will uh
[1:21:48] oh I don't know how to say this
[1:21:50] nicely you wish you left him at home
[1:21:53] maybe that's about the best way to say
[1:21:55] that hadn't taken him with
[1:21:57] you I'll tell this this little story my
[1:22:01] my wife's youngest brother
[1:22:03] Jonathan
[1:22:05] um he did this on purpose mama would
[1:22:08] have him at the store and he would want
[1:22:10] something and she would say no so she he
[1:22:13] would throw himself on the floor and
[1:22:14] start thrashing and and then she would
[1:22:16] come and then he would say don't beat me
[1:22:18] like you beat me at home mom don't beat
[1:22:20] in front of the whole
[1:22:21] crowd
[1:22:23] children can can get even with their
[1:22:24] parents quite
[1:22:27] quickly I'm glad God doesn't treat us
[1:22:29] that
[1:22:31] way but you
[1:22:33] know sometimes he'll let you go do what
[1:22:35] you think you want to
[1:22:37] do he gave that that story of the
[1:22:40] prodigal son who said father I'm of the
[1:22:43] age now I want my
[1:22:46] inheritance I'm capable I'm mature I can
[1:22:49] go do this and I can take well care of
[1:22:51] it
[1:22:53] but we know what happened we know where
[1:22:56] he ended up we know the sad situation he
[1:22:59] got
[1:23:00] into and it was a bad
[1:23:03] situation and and the Bible doesn't say
[1:23:05] anything
[1:23:07] about uh where he lived but I suppose it
[1:23:09] was in a neighborhood his father house
[1:23:12] was up here and one day the young man
[1:23:15] comes to himself gets a hold of himself
[1:23:19] and he's in such a low estate he said
[1:23:21] the servants at my father's house live
[1:23:24] better than I
[1:23:25] do and I'm a son of the
[1:23:28] king but I'll humble myself I'll go back
[1:23:31] to my father and tell him I'm not worthy
[1:23:34] to be your son I'll just be one of your
[1:23:38] servants the Bible didn't say that he
[1:23:41] got new clothes and dress himself up and
[1:23:45] washes himself up to go meet the father
[1:23:47] it said he just got a hold of himself
[1:23:50] and he meant began to make the Journey
[1:23:52] Back to dad's
[1:23:53] house and my thought has always been
[1:23:56] this the neighbor saw him walk out take
[1:23:59] off on his
[1:24:00] journey proud dressed nice got a picture
[1:24:04] of him you know with the stick and all
[1:24:06] the money in the bag I didn't know how
[1:24:08] it really was but just that's the
[1:24:09] picture I have I'm going to go have a
[1:24:12] great time in life I'm going to go do
[1:24:13] the things I want to
[1:24:15] do but that same boy coming back up had
[1:24:19] a whole different
[1:24:21] look looked Haggard he was his his
[1:24:24] clothes was bad he hadn't hadn't bathed
[1:24:26] he was
[1:24:27] hungry and I think the neighbors might
[1:24:29] have been looking out and said who's
[1:24:31] that coming up the
[1:24:33] street and they're all kind of looking
[1:24:35] at and I don't know what his dad's name
[1:24:38] we're going to call him Bob It's usually
[1:24:40] the name I use when I don't know
[1:24:42] anybody's
[1:24:43] name and uh isn't that Bob's son sure
[1:24:48] looks like him look at the mess he's
[1:24:51] made remember remember how he went down
[1:24:53] the street remember what he looked like
[1:24:55] then proud had all the riches dressed so
[1:24:58] nice looked like he was going to conquer
[1:25:00] the world here he comes torn up broken
[1:25:04] shredded probably didn't smell very good
[1:25:06] maybe like we see some of the homeless
[1:25:08] people and now you know the way they are
[1:25:11] today but in his heart he said I'm going
[1:25:13] to make it back to my father's house and
[1:25:16] I'm going to tell him I've sinned
[1:25:17] against him I'm going to humble myself
[1:25:20] and I'm going to say I'll just be your
[1:25:22] servant I'll have a good place to sleep
[1:25:25] at least some nice clothes I can take a
[1:25:27] bath every day and I'll have something
[1:25:29] good to
[1:25:29] eat that's
[1:25:32] enough but it says the father was
[1:25:34] looking down looking for him looking for
[1:25:37] his return maybe there were reports that
[1:25:39] came back do you know what your son is
[1:25:42] doing down here do you know what it tore
[1:25:44] the father's heart
[1:25:46] apart that's my son he don't have to be
[1:25:49] living like
[1:25:51] that the same one that looked down at
[1:25:54] the fiery furnace says I'll
[1:25:56] go the same one that knew that we would
[1:25:59] need to be redeemed he says I will
[1:26:00] inhabit a body of Flesh so I can bear
[1:26:03] their sin that same father is looking
[1:26:06] down and he sees you and he sees that
[1:26:09] you have need of him he sees your
[1:26:11] failures he sees your
[1:26:14] mistakes and the boy comes up and it
[1:26:17] says father went out to meet him went
[1:26:20] out to meet him again in my mind I hear
[1:26:22] the neighbors talking about it look at
[1:26:24] that look at him he don't deserve that
[1:26:27] he's he's made a mess if that was my son
[1:26:29] I wouldn't even let him
[1:26:32] in but the father was looking for his
[1:26:35] son there was a part of him that was
[1:26:39] missing and he wanted him
[1:26:41] back and when the father comes and his
[1:26:44] son meet he said dad I have sinned
[1:26:46] against thee I I I've I I've I've shamed
[1:26:50] your name I I've done done this that and
[1:26:53] the other I'm not worthy to be your son
[1:26:56] again but I'll be one of your slaves
[1:26:58] I'll be one of your
[1:26:59] servants and I'll just said nonsense my
[1:27:02] son you don't even know what you're
[1:27:04] saying you're still my
[1:27:06] son nothing you have done has made me
[1:27:09] you not be my
[1:27:11] son he said you're still my son you're
[1:27:14] not one of the hired servants you're
[1:27:17] heir to all that your father
[1:27:21] has
[1:27:22] and he says come and he tells the
[1:27:25] servants to clean him wash him get his
[1:27:28] clothes
[1:27:29] ready because my son which was lost
[1:27:32] which was dead is alive he's been
[1:27:36] found that's the God we
[1:27:39] serve I I don't know I just feel that
[1:27:43] someone that might be listening is in
[1:27:45] this stage right now how can I get back
[1:27:49] to
[1:27:49] him Come As You Are
[1:27:53] you can't make yourself holy enough to
[1:27:56] approach him on your own you can't make
[1:27:59] yourself good enough to get to God but
[1:28:03] if you'll come as you are and humble
[1:28:04] your heart before him and say have mercy
[1:28:07] on me he will accept you you're part of
[1:28:12] him and Paul finishes unto him be glory
[1:28:16] in the church by Christ Jesus throughout
[1:28:19] all ages world without
[1:28:22] and
[1:28:26] amen you're not going to get too low
[1:28:29] where he can't rescue
[1:28:33] you I I liked what brother Ryan said
[1:28:36] when he there at the end when he
[1:28:38] described the the
[1:28:40] Kings I had never looked at that never
[1:28:44] even noticed that lot his nephew he
[1:28:47] called him my brother we part of the
[1:28:50] same family of God you're my brother
[1:28:52] you're my sister I'm so glad I'm a part
[1:28:54] of the family of God not a distant
[1:28:58] relative of my brother and my sister
[1:29:01] join
[1:29:03] heirs and he said these Kings of fear of
[1:29:08] Torment of problems of habits of
[1:29:11] whatever it
[1:29:13] is Abraham said I'm going to go to
[1:29:16] deliver him I'm going to bring him back
[1:29:19] for a lot the other one he says let's go
[1:29:21] you know these are the Kings this is
[1:29:23] what is this is what's got into into my
[1:29:26] my my brother my sister but there's
[1:29:28] Deliverance for
[1:29:30] it I I was thinking and reading in in a
[1:29:33] message and brother Bram gets into a
[1:29:35] description because they asked him a
[1:29:37] question and he said where are those
[1:29:41] spirits that were cast out of the swine
[1:29:44] that were cast out of I'm sorry of
[1:29:46] Legion and they went into the swine he
[1:29:48] said they're still here he said if you
[1:29:51] remember they asked asked God not to
[1:29:53] send them back he said today those
[1:29:55] Spirits are still
[1:29:57] here and he says they get in through
[1:29:59] sickness they get in through fear they
[1:30:01] get in begin they're just there to
[1:30:05] destroy but you know he set Legion
[1:30:09] free Legion was not the man's name
[1:30:12] legion was those Devils that was in
[1:30:15] him you know he might have been named
[1:30:17] Robert or Bob or Jeff whoever it was but
[1:30:19] he called him Legion because he was
[1:30:21] addressing what the problem
[1:30:23] was and in Deliverance he said he set
[1:30:27] them
[1:30:29] free and God will set you free from
[1:30:33] anything that's binding
[1:30:36] you the hardest the biggest
[1:30:40] battle where brother brandom says this
[1:30:44] is a religious
[1:30:46] spirit a spirit that says I'm good
[1:30:49] enough I don't need help I do this I
[1:30:53] read my Bible I pray I pay my tithe I go
[1:30:57] to church therefore I'm good
[1:31:00] enough Mercy rewrote my
[1:31:03] life it is the grace of God in my life
[1:31:06] that I am where I am
[1:31:07] today if we're not careful sometimes we
[1:31:10] can go to the other side I'm good enough
[1:31:13] no every day I I want to be humble
[1:31:16] before the Lord and say make me more
[1:31:18] like you for musicians would come
[1:31:24] from the last quote broken
[1:31:29] sisters watch
[1:31:32] this I've heard some of these
[1:31:34] testimonies from folks that got to
[1:31:37] know brother Brandon
[1:31:40] personally believe I gave you the the
[1:31:43] quote broken
[1:31:46] sisters I read this
[1:31:50] and and and and I just I read through
[1:31:53] and sometimes you read some of the
[1:31:54] things that brother baham says that he
[1:31:56] it's kind of hard to kind of to believe
[1:31:58] it in a sense see that he could do
[1:32:06] that greater is he that is in
[1:32:10] me he says I'm looking now at a man
[1:32:12] sitting in the back of the room
[1:32:15] here I remember telling him that on an
[1:32:18] old barn stall One Day by a manger and
[1:32:20] he said but I'm no good I said I know
[1:32:23] you're not and I said I'm not either but
[1:32:26] I said you're looking at what you are
[1:32:29] and quit looking at what you are and
[1:32:31] look at what he is he said if I could
[1:32:35] just get rid of these cigarettes brother
[1:32:36] brandom I would be a
[1:32:40] Christian I said don't get rid of them
[1:32:44] you're trying to get good and then come
[1:32:47] to him he never came to save good men he
[1:32:51] come to save bad men that know they were
[1:32:54] bad he said well I listen you don't want
[1:32:57] to go to hell do you he said no well you
[1:32:59] don't have to he died that you might not
[1:33:01] have to go what do I have to do I said
[1:33:04] nothing it's just that simple and then
[1:33:06] he said but if I can ever he said there
[1:33:08] you go back to that cigarette again quit
[1:33:11] thinking about that cigarette just
[1:33:13] remember think about him what he did
[1:33:15] what he is not what you are you're no
[1:33:18] good and you never was and never will be
[1:33:21] but what he is he's the one and I said
[1:33:24] now the only thing you have to do if he
[1:33:27] took your place down there just
[1:33:29] willingly accept what he did only thing
[1:33:32] you have to do is just accept it why he
[1:33:35] said it's it's that simple I'll do it I
[1:33:38] said here's a creek see I brought him up
[1:33:40] there and baptized him in the name of
[1:33:42] Jesus Christ some of his people are
[1:33:45] sitting here and I know that they felt
[1:33:46] funny at me for doing that but I know
[1:33:48] what I was doing I seen in the man
[1:33:52] something that was genuine I could see
[1:33:54] it there and I took him and baptized in
[1:33:56] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:33:59] when he did that it wasn't long that
[1:34:01] after till I was went down to his son's
[1:34:03] house we had a a vision of a tree being
[1:34:05] broken a certain place and the man fell
[1:34:07] almost broke him his back took him in
[1:34:09] the hospital and that night the Lord
[1:34:11] revealed to me that was the end of the
[1:34:13] cigarette so on the next day he wanted
[1:34:16] some cigarettes I said and I said I'll
[1:34:18] buy him a carton and take it to him you
[1:34:22] just watch and see his cigarette days
[1:34:24] are done he's never smoked one since and
[1:34:28] never wanted one
[1:34:30] since brother brandom says you're
[1:34:33] struggling to become good enough to
[1:34:36] receive
[1:34:38] God just as I
[1:34:41] am just as I Am Lord take
[1:34:45] me Lord receive me just as I am let's
[1:34:49] bow our heads
[1:34:56] Lord
[1:34:59] you we could look through the
[1:35:03] scriptures and see how you took men that
[1:35:06] we would say were not worthy to
[1:35:08] be to be helped by you or received by
[1:35:11] you but you weren't looking at their re
[1:35:14] their were worthiness you were looking
[1:35:17] at what what you were going to do with
[1:35:20] them as you walked along the
[1:35:23] shore and you saw them fishermen and he
[1:35:26] says come follow me I will make you
[1:35:28] Fishers of
[1:35:30] Men a man that was self-righteous in his
[1:35:33] actions and he was going had gotten
[1:35:36] letters and the authorization to go have
[1:35:39] these new Christians put to death or
[1:35:42] imprisoned but you knew he was one of
[1:35:46] yours and you knew what a great place or
[1:35:48] what a great position Paul would have
[1:35:53] in
[1:35:55] Christianity you had mercy on
[1:35:58] him there's so many Lord we could look
[1:36:01] through the
[1:36:03] scriptures we could even look in our
[1:36:05] lives how good you've been to us how
[1:36:07] merciful you've been to us
[1:36:09] Lord and it's not us trying to do good
[1:36:12] deeds to make you accept us lord it's us
[1:36:16] accepting what you've done for us and
[1:36:19] letting it live in US letting it apply
[1:36:21] to us lives Lord It's the spirit of
[1:36:24] Christ in us that is the hope of glory
