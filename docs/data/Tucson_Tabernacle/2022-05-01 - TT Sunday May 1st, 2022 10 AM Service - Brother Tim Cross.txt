away with his playing i could hardly remember the words and this morning it's a real privilege of mine to have my brother play with me and so i'd like to sing a song that he played for me many many years ago i don't know how many it was but it was quite a while back oh what a savior once i was straight [Music] in since dark valley no hope [Music] they searched through [Music] to save so [Music]

his mercy we can be who we are today because of who he is amen we appreciate brother aaron and the saints of the tucson tabernacle welcoming us this morning my family's here with me it's nice to have my wife and a little girl that we're in the process now of adopting we can talk about it it's it's all public it's all legal and uh it's for ordained before the foundation of the world so we're simply stepping into what god saw before time began and uh real nice to have my friend here this morning brother swanson i remember that meeting we had on the platform of bible tabernacle in ruth north carolina i'd heard all these accounts all these reports of this this great singer and i was privileged to be his accompanist that day only organ actually i was on an organ which my wife is an accomplished organist and i more comfortable in 88 keys but you know as a musician your job is to accompany the singer and to complement what they are doing because they are featured if you will and i think you know as christians that's our role is to complement the lord jesus it's all about him he's the great composer he's the great conductor he gave each of us our place in this great symphony that is unfolding and so i want to pay compliment to him most of all this morning and that's why we're here is to honor the resurrection not as a historical event but as an ongoing life that is living and we're witnesses to that not having seen it but having experienced it and so we're giving witness to a resurrected savior and he gives witness to his own word when we come in faith believing and i would challenge your faith this morning by saying whatever you have need of if it's physical if it's spiritual if it's in your body or your soul or your mind just give compliment to him this morning and watch him compliment his own word his own promise and honor your faith and perform the promise of his word you know that's one thing god's a great physician but he's not practicing he's performing amen because he made our bodies he made this earth he made the elements he is our creator our designer our god our king we're giving glory to him this morning and he's getting glory to himself amen i'm preaching already but you know god god referenced pharaoh one time he said i'm going to get me honor upon pharaoh i'm going to use this vile creature of a man to get me honored i said god is using adversity god is using trials god is even using tensions and strife and controversy to place us where he would have us to be that he may be glorified and so i i feel very humbled to have this place behind this sacred desk this morning and as i so often do i feel ill prepared but uh god gives us the pieces many times he doesn't show us the whole puzzle and so we just want to see what he'll what pieces he'll put in place today invite you to take your bibles and turn with me to first kings chapter 19. i want to say it was a real honor to be with you here in february and to be a part of the harmony in the desert and then to speak that sunday morning and i've received some reports of things the lord did in that service that only as eternity unfolds will we perhaps realize what god did in just that one gathering of his people together and we're so thankful to see god just performing his word and performing his promise amongst his people amen i'm i might be bringing my father's day message to you here this morning and so it may be a little premature but um i pray it'll be a blessing to you i want to take for a thought or for a title this morning it's kind of a long title uh but we'll hear the prophet elijah use the term better than my father's and i want to take for a thought or a subject taking on the identity of god through christ the revealed word of the hour and as we approach his word this morning i'd like to invite you to bow your heads in prayer and lift your hand if you have something in your heart you're desiring from the lord this morning and you say lord i want you to speak and i want you to speak to me lord and give me an ear to hear and a heart to receive most gracious and holy god and father you are lifted up this morning in our hearts and in this tabernacle lord that has been set aside as a sanctuary for your children to come and be sheltered so that they can enter into your divine presence lord and be replenished be recharged and be renewed lord as we struggle and we journey through lord the path that you have ordained us to walk in our earthly journey as we lord are crossing that great bridge across the chasm of time and we're nearing the end of that bridge and what i would call the resumption of eternity lord because within each of your children there is an eternal quality that began before there was a creation before there was time and before lord there was a world as we know it now we were there lord as your desire and now here we are fulfilling you're fulfilling your own desire lord in our lives and you're taking us from this realm of time and all lord that sin and corruption and perversion has turned this earth and this creation into you're taking us from that back into the eternity lord that we realized in you lord as job said when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy lord that's why we're bound together this morning lord our hearts lord an inseparable bond has been formed by the holy spirit lord a unique connection has been made lord because when your words sounded lord something resounded from within our hearts to say amen lord not an intellectual amen not lord theological lord not an agreement or a sympathy but lord an actual identification lord you called you have called the names of the elect lord through the revealing of your word and something in our hearts lord it it transcends our minds it it transcends lord what we're able to to comprehend humanly or intellectually lord but something in our lives is saying amen to your word and lord that's what we're here to say man to this morning lord we say amen to the word that says i am the lord thy god that healeth all the diseases that forgiveth all of thine iniquities lord may our lives be the amen lord to your prayer on earth lord that your children would be joined as one here lord inseparably lord despite every attempt of satan lord to bring division to bring strife lord oh god your body lord is an army that's rising up father god under the voice of prophecy lord you're regathering bone to bone lord you're you're standing an army up lord that is invincible father god under the divine unction of the holy spirit lord i'm here to yield my vessel to you this morning lord these worshippers are here each of us are here to yield lord to what you would minister through us and to us lord in your divine presence this morning we bow and we give you thanks lord we're thanking you for our healing we're thanking you for our strength we're thanking you for the peace of god that passive comprehension of man that's beyond what we can understand lord we give you thanks and praise and now may you break the bread of life to our hearts and lord when this service is concluded may you be the most memorable member of our gathering today may your presence here perform lord what gives you the honor and the glory and what has enabled you to gain the reputation that you have lord jesus further your desires in our lives today we ask in jesus name amen amen first kings chapter 19 beginning at verse 1. and ahab told jezebel all that elijah had done and with all how he had slain all the prophets with the sword you might take note there that elijah's not the one who lifted the sword it was his followers that were charged by his message but elijah got the blame and that's okay because it was the divine action of the holy spirit through his lips that charged the people to take action against the unbelief then jezebel sent a messenger unto elijah elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if i make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time and when he saw that he arose and went for his life the bible says one translation says he ran for his life he went for his life and came to beersheba which belongeth to judah and left his servant there but he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die and said it is enough now oh lord take away my life for i am not better than my fathers may the lord bless the reading of his word as you're seated this morning i am not better than my father's what a sobering realization elijah must have come to at this at this point at this time in his life in his ministry and after all of the great mighty powerful things that god had achieved through the life and ministry of his prophet here he has he has reached this place where as a man he feels that in no way is he any better or more significant than all of those who have lived and died before him and you know i think as as sad or as disheartening as that may be to to see elijah in this place yet i think this was key because i think that too often even in who we are as the children of god and the people of god our adversary has very skillfully used those truths to try to inflate our egos or somehow lift us up in pride or in self-esteem to think of ourselves more highly than we ought to think of ourselves and so we must be careful i think even the apostle paul said lest i be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelation that was sent to me the the messenger of satan to buff it god was actually using those adversities in those trials to keep paul from becoming too puffed up in which case he would have suffered perhaps if you will the same end that lucifer suffered having become exalted in his position he was not satisfied to channel worship he wanted to become a detour for the worship to be filtered through him where he would gain something from that that suited his own demonic lusts and so i i think this is a caution for us as christians now paul was not immune from temptation he was not exempted from temptation and i think that's important for us to realize because as a young person i know in my mind i thought you know i just need to get justified sanctified and filled with the holy spirit and be sealed away in god and then i'll be this invincible christian living in this nice bright bubble that god has created for every son and daughter of god to live in and enjoy an earthly existence in until we're taken until all of the others come to their place of perfection and then we'll all be raptured away in a glorious rapture but i'm finding that was a little bit of a dream that was a little bit of a fantasy that i had imagined in my mind because we all want an end of suffering we all want an end of of all the things we wrestle with and struggle with the and the things that you know war at our spirit i'm a peace loving person i don't like contention i don't like strife i i won't necessarily shy away from it but i don't enjoy it i like peace i like harmony i i like when love prevails and and the people of god and the church of god i wish the whole world i i'm sorry to reference the phrase of a worldly song but my dad really lives uh loves the guitar of chet atkins and jed atkins was was a renowned guitarist and there was my dad would play these cassette tapes of chet atkins and he would play these classic tunes often with an orchestra and different accompaniment but he played this song called i'd like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony i'd like to buy the world of coke and keep it company you know world peace is something everyone strives for but we've never reached it and we're not going to until jesus christ is the king and we reign supreme with him as his bride in the throne amen the peace that the world seeks and strives for is not going to be realized amen until the millennium the millennial reign sets in amen but but still if there's something there's a desire there's a yearning and i believe that especially as the sons and daughters of god the family and the children of god what we're desiring is not even our own desire but it's his desire that is realized through us amen he's a god of peace he's a god of love he's a god of healing he's a god of restoration he's a god of redemption this is who he is and this is what he does but he but he formed this this angel whose name was lucifer and within that within that created being which where there's no redemption for angels amen there once they fall that's it that's their state perpetually amen but for sons and daughters there's redemption so god allowed lucifer amen for this desire to be harbored and to grow into fruition in his heart to to take one-third of those angels and entice them away to become his constituents to become you know he his his supporters and in doing so amen they were cast down by michael the angelic form of jesus christ they were cast into the earth amen for the battle to resume amen but for the same end that was achieved in heaven to be achieved here on earth amen so when god even created adam in his own image and then from the side of adam he formed mrs adam the bride of adam showing what he would do 2000 years later on calvary amen when the roman would would thrust his spear into the side of the almighty god and released from his side amen the humanity the creation the desires of god and bodies of flesh amen satan had no idea what he was achieving he was not destroying god's plan he was unfolding god's plan he was allowing those hidden attributes that were within christ to be expressed here on the earth oh my i tell people the devil is only as determined as he is dumb he keeps on losing but yet he won't stop trying and with every junction and every joint every time he looks like he gets a victory it only serves to a greater victory and a greater expression of what would only have been achieved by satan doing what he did amen so it's god's desires it's god's plan and it's actually it's actually the person of who god is that is unfolding down through time it's his plan of redemption the fall enabled him to exhibit his characteristics as a savior as a healer as a father with a family that he favored he favors you this morning he favored israel above all the other nations they didn't deserve it they didn't earn it they didn't merit it it was unmerited grace and favor that was extended to his people because it was his desire amen oh oh i love i believe it was brother lonnie jenkins who made this statement god didn't just want to have a family god wanted to be a family we're not something that was spun off of god to see whether or not we would return to god we are the very manifested expression of god which can only return to our origin to our source jesus the bible says knowing that he came from god and must return to god he had complete security in who he was because he knew who he was before he came became an embryo he knew who he was before he condescended from the realms of glory and was born in a manger even he knew who he was it didn't matter what the tabloids said it didn't matter what the rumors were it didn't matter what the romans said it didn't matter what the paid messengers the pilot said he had an agenda he had a purpose he had a plan and when he subjected himself to the roman guards and the roman authorities there in the garden of gethsemane what looked like death what looked like defeat amen what what what what disbanded his disciples and dispersed them abroad amen was actually the preparation for the greatest victory that god would ever achieve amen so i want to tell the devil this morning this is god's doing this is god's plan unfolding and i'm a part of it by the grace of god i didn't wake up one day and decide i wanted to be a christian i didn't decide one day i think i'll be a child of god or a son of god it was decided before time began and i'm here reacting to what god has already decided i'm here to say amen to the word of god amen it's not filtering through my mind it's not what i'm able to wrap my intelligence around it's the intelligence of god which is overtaking me amen it's his desire i've said this before perhaps even in this pulpit you can run from god all you want to but his arms are longer than your legs his grace goes beyond the boundaries of what you can run what you're running from is going to overtake you one day amen is going to wrap you into it and you're going to say like saul why did i fight this for so long it's who i am it's who i was ordained to be amen it's what god was calling me to even the years that saul spent there trying to become the greatest of the pharisees or the greatest of the religious leaders all those years of preparation were god instilling into his servant what would he would one day quicken to the realization of jesus christ fulfilled that law he was the embodiment of that law he did not come in contrast to the law he came in contrast to what man had defined that law to be that's what jesus contrasted was the religious hierarchy and the teachings of what man had perverted that law to mean or to be but jesus wasn't wasn't contrary to the law he was the fulfillment of the law he was the expression of the law to show that what man and humanity was unable to achieve to become the righteousness of god he became that amen he took his own punishment upon himself amen to liberate his attributes his children his family both old and new testament amen both those who had died in the faith looking forward and those who would die in the faith in the next two thousand years looking back to who christ is and seeing their identity in him and looking forward to his coming which will be preceded by an out resurrection from among the dead oh my i'm saying a mouthful this morning but it's wonderful and so the thing about it is now if you can give me grace and i don't know that i'll hurry this morning but i'll try to finish by noon but this word is your identity this word gives you your place in the kingdom of god in the family of god in the ministry of god whether you ever stand behind this sacred desk and expound upon the word of god you do have a ministry because everyone who is a part of the body of christ is part of the expression you're an outlet for his characteristics and he is king he is priest he is lamb he is god those attributes will express through you in ministry now the word of god places boundaries there to to keep the administration of the life of christ in a divine order that is there to prevent the distortion or perversion of that order by our enemy into something that would be counterproductive satan is trying his best to corrupt the cells of the body of jesus christ here on the earth the bride he's trying to corrupt those cells through outside influence through diet through taking of something that's not the revealed word of god or not the inspired word of god to take a twist and so it's how he achieved his first attack on humanity was he came to the feminine expression of the first adam and began expounding the word yea hath god said but see he wasn't just there to share the word he was there to flavor the word with something he was going to take it apart from its original context to lure her into something that he would present to her as having a greater meaning than the simplicity of the fortification and protection that god had already placed her behind yeah hath god said now eve did god really mean that death death in this perfection in this bliss in this splendor death the day you eat thereof that day ye shall die how could god but see death was already entering when she stopped for one second to give ear to what another husband had to say death was already entering because it was it was attracting her interest to something that was a difference or a deviation from the simplicity of the word and you know what i i am i'm sorry to have to say this but there are some people who will never be satisfied with the simplicity of the word they've just got to have a twist they've got to have a little added flavor they've and so it's how ministries distinguish themselves and set themselves apart from others is they offer a flavor in the message of thinking man's filter brother bradham deals with it very clearly it's a filter because they're convinced the filter is there to protect against the harmful contents of the cigarette or to enhance the flavor in a way that appeals everybody has unique tastes you're all formed differently everyone has a different idea of what a comfortable temperature is i know i'm in that business we've made a lot of money trying to make everybody feel comfortable believe it or not there have been times when fake thermostats have been installed in areas of homes or offices to convince people that they actually had control and it made them more comfortable just the illusion that they now had control absolved their anxieties and made them more comfortable so comfort is subjective taste is subjective it varies by person so satan realized i can gain a following by offering a filter that appeals to a certain taste why do you think we have dozens of brands of cigarettes because they all appeal to a unique demographic which wants that flavor amen whether it's even about the taste or not they want to smoke a certain brand because it gives them an identity amen they're not smoking the cheap cigarettes they're smoking the expensive ones right think about it friend what brother branham was describing in cigarettes had a a a more striking or a more devastating reality in churchianity and the religions of the world the simplicity of the word of god is too often not enough for mainstream religion they all want a flavor they want the roman catholic flavor they want the protestant church's flavor they want what is in their family heritage and we're not exempt or immune from this as believers of the message those same spirits are now here attacking the bride of jesus christ and might i say have raised up ministries that will take you right out of this bible and right out of a vindicated message and say you need my flavor you need my ministry to break this message down to you i want to tell the devil this morning no i don't your ministry is what got us in this mess and there's only one thing that's going to get us out of this mess and that's the pure unadulterated word of god amen it worked back then it will work now amen amen i don't need a man's opinion i don't need a man's idea i don't need to be identified with some big movement i don't believe in an eighth messenger there were seven there were seven that god sanctioned and the seventh one was to introduce us to jesus christ and i don't look for that to happen in the future i have already been introduced to the person of jesus christ in the revealing of his word [Applause] you say are you looking for brother brandon to come back absolutely i'm looking for paul to come back i'm looking for irenaeus to come back i'm looking for all those messengers and all those believers to come up in a general resurrection amen but i'm not waiting on some ministry to rise up and punctuate what god has already punctuated with divine vindication we have what we need to take us into the rapture what we need is a greater appreciation for what we already have i'm preaching now just from my heart but the only way satan could ever convince eve that she needed what he was offering was to make her a bit dissatisfied with what she'd already had you watch that when a spirit begins to rise up and breed this satisfaction you watch that because that's how satan moves he's not overt he's not the blunt broad edge of a maul he's a little fine wedge that comes in to create division and dissatisfaction and a discontentment and from there he he he he begins to generate a hunger and a desire for something different or something more i'm going to tell you the conversation that that the serpent had with eve in the garden of eden didn't happen one day there was no time being marked at that time he had conversation after conversation after conversation with her he attracted her to what he was offering over a period of time to relax any inhibitions or any uh fortification or any barriers that she might initially put there all those barriers became relaxed he became her best friend he became closer to her than her own husband and then enticed her into the transgression because he took her away from her identity as a daughter of god and made her brother brenham caught her a prostitute no woman will enter prostitution without first losing her self-respect and her self-esteem and her own self-worth must first be obliterated before she will enter into prostitution the same is true spiritually no church will ever deviate from the word of god until they first lose the esteem that the word of god gives them the world calls paul a woman hater paul was not a woman hater paul was there to give the woman her rightful place and position as the queen of heaven and the very people that call paul a woman hater call themselves the queen of heaven the roman catholic church isn't it fascinating how the devil so slyly removes what god has given you and offers you something that is a complete it's diametrically opposed it's the complete enemy to god and to who you are and people gobble it up and believe it's eternal life and you know what i'm just going to say this about roman catholicism it offers you no surety it offers you no confidence in an in an end that god has already determined it keeps you pursuing something for your entire life and the life thereafter in hopes that you can one day obtain that is roman catholicism as opposed to christianity which says it's already settled it's already finished god has already determined this end for you and just invites you to accept it by faith and enter into it i love the words to that song it's already done hallelujah because the real christianity is belief in a finished work which is bringing you into the final product or the final result of that finished work but satan you know he's not attacking our ideas he's not attacking our doctrines he's not attacking william branham as a man or the message as a movement he's not attacking tucson tabernacle he's not attacking uh you know the the branham family he's attacking the bride he's attacking the feminine expression of jesus christ by attacking the word of god which was sent through the lips of his prophet messenger to give us for the first time in 6 000 years who we actually are and what god in the back part of his mind had determined was too precious too valuable too powerful to be prematurely released now it's been released and satan's attacking it because it's always been his enemy and it's the only thing that's keeping him from the full realization of his own ambition is that word being realized in the heart of faith by the sons and daughters of jesus christ because the moment you realize that word is who you are that word is your healing that word is your salvation that word is your power over temptation over depression over every demonic attack this word gives you authority over the devil it gives you full authority over the devil this word gives you unlimited and invincible power as sons and daughters of god amen let me tell you something friend we're not taking the devil's property back from him we're taking our own property it's been ours all along amen when they dispossessed canaanites they were dispossessing squatters that had been on their land that god had given their father abraham i'm not here to take my healing back from the devil i'm here to take my healing that's always been mine it never was the devil's but he's trying to be a squatter on your property whether it's healing whether it's salvation whether it's resurrection whether it's the rapture whether it's an overcoming life your unbelief is the only thing standing in the way of your victory but you're going to have to feed on the word of god that's the only thing that will feed your faith and quicken those hidden potentials that god has already placed within you this word is the only thing that will extract those potentials and activate them in your life you won't get it through psychology you won't get it through medical science i believe in doctors i appreciate their contribution but god alone heals i am the lord thy god that healeth all thy diseases you know why the devil can't heal because god didn't leave him any room to god said i heal all amen so all healing comes from god and the medical world in this science world is their amen to help create the conditions for healing they can mend the broken bones they can do great things today there are marvels to modern sites but god heals healing is a divine characteristic of god alone and while the devil may try to mimic it and replicate it the devil cannot heal amen i feel good this morning i'm way off of my notes but i want to tell you something in ezekiel 37 ezekiel spoke through the valley of dry bones and god said these bones are the whole house of israel they've been smashed they've been scattered they've been dismembered they've been disunified but he said speak brother bradham said this book of revelation can only be understood by a certain class of people i want to tell you this morning you're special you're not just any church you're not just anybody you're somebody this message resonated to you for very special reasons it may not attract the attention of the world it's not supposed to it's here to attract the attention of the bride but he said ezekiel you've got to speak it in other words no matter how great it is as a desire of god something has to give birth to god's desire in speaking and when the prophet spoke those bones responded they were divinely programmed to react to prophecy it wasn't a conscientious reaction it wasn't a rib bow and said you know what i think i'll just get up and go go join myself to a sternum no it was a divine intelligence that was calling those bones back to order back to where they had originally been joined to putting the muscle putting the sinew putting the blood even putting all the organs putting all the faculties back to everything they had once been and then breathing life into them to go and be better than they were before because the armies they were going out to destroy had modernized they had advanced their weaponry and their strategy and their tactics they had developed themselves but god amen i'll just say this this morning we don't need a modernized gospel we don't need a new translation of the bible and we certainly don't need another interpretation of the message the original still works it's the old time holy spirit and the devil won't come near it that's the reason unbelievers fear it but it's good enough for me if our young people get the same holy ghost that fell on the day of pentecost it doesn't matter how modern the temptations are it doesn't matter how many devices it doesn't matter how diabolical satan's plan god is greater greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world god is still greater what you need is god you don't need a church you don't need a youth camp amen you don't need a new pastor you need a relationship with jesus christ you need the holy ghost amen and what some of us need is another dip in the same holy ghost we want to do this and to do this why don't we just get a new outpouring a new feeling of god saying god one more time let me stand there like samson and say it's not about me it's about you god you gave my mother this promise you gave me a nazarite identification i failed to protect my identity as a nazarite but god you've restored it now for your glory one more time lord let me and my death gain a greater victory in all the victories of my life that's what we need friends a death to self a death to our desires and our ambitions so often they're well intentioned but friends it's just like and i preached a message called better than before because when god puts things back they're not as good they're better when god restored adam and eve but see whatsoever god hath joined together let not man put asunder so much of the division and the schisms within the body of christ today they're the works of man and they're failing and they're dissolving and the kingdoms that men have built are one by one crumbling and the kingdom that god started is rising it's growing in power and in love and the bond of the holy spirit which is the great unifying agency of god is bringing a body into order that is better than anybody before when god restored adam and eve together they had a greater bond because now through the appreciation they had gained through contrast of what they experienced in the loss of fellowship and the loss of companionship and knowing that horrible tragedy that had brought separation being rejoined they could now be guarded against the wiles of the adversary and say adam i'll never listen to another voice i'll never listen to another message i'll never look to another man she could have never been married to that serpent because there was a difference in origin and specie so where he could never understand her heart she could never understood his they would have never grown old together in love they would have always been tensions and why doesn't he understand me why why can't she get this because they came from different places but god had joined adam and his wife together before they were separated they were together so god could not go out into the garden and find another lump of clay because there was no other there was no other peace that could complement him and could complement one another like adam and mrs adam so they were rejoined together better than before this resurrected army of ezekiel 37 was better than before because they were able to defeat a new enemy with an old god an old experience an original experience if you will god god has never needed to polish his word he just puts it back and what it was originally will still work today if we will adhere to it and there it is the key you say brother tim i i i have such great faith you don't have any faith other than what god gives you if you have faith at all in god it's what he imparted it's his own divine attribute which is echoing an amen to his voice god put that you say brother tim you're trying to weaken my self-confidence no i'm trying to strengthen your confidence in who he is in you because if your confidence is just in yourself it will falter and it will fail but if your confidence can ever be anchored into what god says you are that is steadfast that is sure that will stand the test of time and will withstand every storm amen oh my i'm kind of lost here but i want to i want you to know that i'm not preaching this just you know this is in third timothy chapter one this is right out of the bible this is right out of the message amen brother man said i used to remember as a little boy i hope i'm not holding you too long that knowing sitting out on the creek bake and i'd sit there and look around at nighttime pop and mom they're going on now to their rest and then days they were sinners there was no christianity in our homes at all and oh my drinking in parties and carrying on made me sick it made me sick i'd take my lantern and my dog and go to the woods to stay all night in the winter time i'd hunt till the party was over maybe daylight in the morning come home wouldn't be over i've laid on top of a shed and sleep waiting for daylight to break now brother betterment showing you the pond that the lily came up through now it's 1965 the world is seeing a ministry that is so profound in its impact almost every realm of world powers have given testament to god has visited this earth this generation the political powers gave gave acknowledgement to it congressman upshaw kings queens monarchs i mean god didn't do this in a corner friend god did not do this in obscurity god did this on the front pages of major media outlets god didn't do this in a dark corner and i'm not ashamed of what god did i don't have to apologize for it god did it i'm standing behind it supporting it say i know god did that i don't have to answer the unbeliever's questions they've always had questions that can never be answered because it's a bottomless well of doubt and no answer will ever satisfy their desire because their un their d their desires are driven out of unbelief they are in essence unbelievers and had they lived 2 000 years ago they would have called him an illegitimate son they would have called him you know why doesn't he come in the main stream of the religions they would have found reasons to doubt then just like they find reasons to doubt today so you don't have to answer their questions you don't have to go to the library you don't have to go into the archives you don't have to go in into the micro fish and try to fish up an answer be the answer you are the echo to this message amen behold i send you you are who elijah was sent to you are who the ministry resonates to amen your your presence here this morning is an amen to malachi 4. your life is an amen to malachi 4. the baptism of the holy ghost to you is an amen amen a photograph is not the vindication of this message it's just one of them but the greatest vindication are the lives of the men women and boys and girls who today are changed creatures because god sent a prophet and god restored truth to us that had for 2 000 years been perverted and polluted by man's opinions and the last thing the true bride of christ is going to do is turn from this and start wandering toward yet one other man's opinion the true bride won't do it she's not interested womb is sealed the spiritual womb is sealed and she's satisfied and content that god did this god started it god's going to finish it and i'm here preparing for his return oh my glory you know i i i'm going to go to this story and brother ben talked about that armor meat packing man's son whoever found in chicago what he was desiring and a wife so he says you know i'll find it out west and out west he felt they dressed a little differently they they had a little different customs you know they had the ranch house and all those things but yet everything else as far as what was in those girls was no different than what was in the girls from chicago they just had a different decor but when he found the little cousin when he found the little girl out behind the ranch house throwing out the dishwater no shoes on her feet just a little ragged dress on you know just there just being who she was she wasn't trying to impress anybody would to god we had more people in this earth today that would just be themselves our world has been ruined by hollywood i go overseas i go to romania and see women trying to dress like americans they dress worse than most americans because all they see is what's on television and they think every american woman dresses that way because they've never been here they've only seen what's been projected to them on a screen and that's what they're ascribing to is what image and so hollywood has ruined the world because nobody can be themselves everybody's got to be an actor everybody's got to put on a good front everybody now has got multiple personalities because they're like movie characters they get in a personality and they can't get out and friends just be what god has made you if you can ever realize you're a created vessel unique you are the unique expression of god's glory no one can take your place it's your place but if you'll just do and be what god has called and ordained you to be and quit trying to live up to others expectations or quit trying to create put some image in front of yourself to impress friends if people aren't impressed with who god has made you why try what who cares they're not your god they're not your savior they didn't bleed and die on calvary for your salvation for so who cares what their opinion is i'm interested in pleasing one person and that's the almighty god and if we had more people who could just be satisfied in the skin that god gave me man we'd probably put some of these beauticians out of business i'm sorry that was free but we're living in a world today where people can't be satisfied being themselves they're committing suicide because they're trying to live up to an image that others are trying to form them to be i'm happy the way god made me amen i'm not perfect but i'm becoming the image that he's called me to be i'll tell you i'll be the first to tell you he's still working on me he hadn't put me up on the shelf for sale or for the viewer's pleasure he's got me there as a testament to what he can transform a person into that's what i'm giving witness to but there was let me go back to brother branham we see his home life we see the the environment he was raised in come home i'd lay on top of a shed and sleep waiting for daylight to break then i think of hell at times then being out there in the summertime get my sticks put them down for a little wind break where if it rained lay there and have the pole sticking in the water fishing my old dog laying there i'd say looky here you know last winter i camped right here one night i built a fire right here when i was waiting for my old dog here to treat i had a fire here it was froze five or five inches deep in the ground but little flower where did you come from see well and where'd you come from who who came out here and planted you and what hot house did they bring you out of or what what where'd you come from that little flower i'd say well it was froze and everything and i built a fire on top here besides the freezing element there was a heat element laying here on a big old log where i burned you and yet here you are and you're alive where did you come from all night all day angels watching over me my lord god planted something there and it doesn't matter what the devil has put on top of it god is watching that life that seed what was it there was another william branham see a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of god oh my the word of god that was placed there each one of you can think of similar things see it was working then look up at the trees and i'd say leaf i'd seen you fall off last year and why are you back there again where'd you come from what brought you here see it was that eternal life working in the body brother bradham was not a theologian brother brethren had not been to seminary brother brennaman hardly gone through the years of public school but there was an eternal quality down deeply embedded in his young boy heart that was looking out and seeing god and wondering who am i where did i come from where am i going and what is my identity and then one day as i walked on that voice talking don't ever drink smoke and so forth and the young fellas and all got older see there was something moving and all at once i looked up and i said i'm not the son of charles and elle branham now i'm tying this back to elijah under the juniper tree i am not better than my fathers you will live and die in that if it's all you ever see you can't be better than your natural lineage you can't reform yourself hardly two weeks ago my wife and i were in a court proceeding and we were watching a man on the witness stand his mother was the prosecutor and she was renewing a restraining order against her 38 year old son frail little little lady probably 100 pounds soaking wet standing up there probably in her 60s getting the court to reinforce to reinstate a restraining order against their 38 year old son and he's there on the and he's there on the witness stand high on drugs it was plain to everyone in the court he was and the the judge asked him four different times sir have you within the last 48 hours taken any mind altering substance any illegal drugs or any alcohol anything that would impair your state of mind and his own conscience prohibited him from giving the judge a straight answer he said oh your judge you know i'm from florida and i'm this and i'm that and i'm in this self therapy and i'm in this self-rehab self this self that i think that's the problem you're broken and you're trying to fix yourself and he's dosing himself he said i take recreational drugs and i take prescription this and prescription that i think you're a mess and here you are and your your own mother has having to to to plead to the mercies of the courts to put something in place that will protect her from the child of her womb you're not going to be better than your fathers you can't my point is you can't reform yourself you can't diagnose your own problems you are the problem i'm the problem without god we're lost without his grace and mercy we're hopeless we have no future we have no identity we have no security we have nothing outside of him we are completely reliant and dependent on his mercy and his grace amen so i'm here this morning pleading to the mercies of god god you called me you saved me you're the one who picked me up out of the clay lord you saw something in me that was worth saving that was worth redeeming that was worth starting oh god will you come and finish what you started because i will only in all my efforts to avoid the mistakes of my predecessors i will only repeat them and worsen them unless another life takes over unless i find a higher identity i love my earthly father and i love my earthly mother but i know i need a heavenly father i know i need a new birth and i thank god for the day he came and saved me filled me with his spirit and said i'm starting you on the way and the bible says he that began a good work in you will be faithful to perform it to the day of jesus christ my hopes are built on nothing less than jesus and his righteousness that's the only thing this world is teetering and tottering and falling apart amen it's scripting anxieties and depressions and demonic possessed people are running to and fro they don't have enough institutions they don't have enough asylums they don't have enough doctors they don't have enough prescriptions but if you can ever reach that well of water that that little woman found two thousand years ago we know that when messiah's coming he said i am he that's speaking to thee one drink from that well brother and sister gave her a new identity amen i'm not a prostitute that barred from the temple i am the temple of the holy ghost amen i don't have to be good enough for the world you'll never be good enough for the world but you're too good for him to lose and he thought enough of you to come and give his life on calvary as our sisters come back to the music may the lord help us this morning friends this message god did it god said william branham god called him god told him don't drink don't smoke don't defile your body in any way because i've got to work for you to do when you get older god did it god vindicated that man and that ministry he does not need my endorsement he has gods [Music] he does not need my endorsement he has gods i'm giving testament to what god has done i'm declaring to this generation not what god is about to do but what god has already done and continues to do as the ripples of the impact of what god did over 40 years ago they are still echoing [Music] not only across this earth but across the entire universe the order of god's creation is being restored right now it's already underway and it will be realized in a millennial reign and the resumption of eternity and the universe will be restored to a perfect order and we'll be a part of that by the grace of god i'm just here to say amen to it brother swanson i don't offer an opinion on it i just say amen i want my life to be the amen to his desire his prayer brother said anything that's an enemy to this word is your enemy so i will tell you this morning be bold be courageous any ministry that rises up i don't care how many signs and wonders accompany it if it doesn't say what a vindicated message has already said flee from it it's death you can't ask for more vindication than what god has already given be confident and be satisfied in what god has already done and that will bring you into it and it's transforming powers amen i was looking for a scripture here just to close on second corinthians 5. [Music] verse 14 for the love of christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead and that he died for all that they which live should not live [Music] should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again wherefore henceforth know we know man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all all [Music] things are become new friends what i'm trying to get to is he became everything that you were so you could become everything that he is the divine transaction that took place amen of which you are benefactor and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and have given to us the ministry of reconciliation you talk about a priesthood amen we're here as the unifying agents of the body of jesus christ to put down dissention to put down schisms to put down division and controversy and strife and bitterness our job is to be the healing the healing of christ's body is a is is a power that is residing within the body it's an inherent power for the body to heal itself as it drinks in the word of god in the spirit of god oh my you don't you don't have to to spray a tree with pesticides to protect it against the foreign creatures that want to take its life just feed it good nutrients and the strength of who the tree is by drawing those nutrients from the earth will repel oh amen if we just drink in the word of god and let the holy spirit rain down upon our lives amen we won't need all the programs and all the pesticides and all the theology and all the psychology the strength is already there in your members and is activated by the nurturing of the holy spirit oh my to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world to himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and have committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then are we ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christ instead be reconciled to god for he hath made him to be sent for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him amen can you say amen lord let it not just be my vocal cords but let it be the very life that you live out through me be the amen to your word would you like to stand this i shall foreign [Music] to the cross jesus [Music] the grace that calls my fault he looked beyond [Music] amazing grace waste my song of mine [Music] i do not know [Music] [Applause] all my i shall [Music] [Applause] forever lift [Music] to view the cross where jesus [Music] [Music] the grace that caught [Music] he became me so that i might become him by [Music] grace do you believe that this morning he became me so that i might become him by grace he took my place he [Applause] took my place so that i through his love could take yes [Music] so that i might become him my grace is that your testimony this morning sing it with all your hearts all that i was so that i become all that he is my grace that's his grace manifested that's his glory became all that i was so that i might become him by grace he took my place he took my place so that i through his love could take [Music] perhaps this morning as we bow our heads for prayer [Music] the holy spirit has spoken to your heart this morning the adversary has been exposed [Music] that voice that conscience that besetting sin something that's creeping into your life [Music] to try to move you away [Music] from who you are as a son of god as a daughter of god to try to lure your interests and your desires into something apart from the word of god and thereby [Music] marginalize the effect of the word of god in your life you see i don't believe satan can destroy you he just wants to sideline you neutralize you so you cannot be an effective witness [Music] for the power of the gospel but i wonder if your heart has been gripped this morning you say lord jesus i want to put away i want to shut out i want to silence this voice [Music] i want to cauterize i want i want the great scalpel of the holy spirit to cut away this influence this foreign life that's trying to enter as a parasite to weaken [Music] to hinder me from fully realizing the joys and the peace the power the healing the salvation [Music] you see friends that's the only thing that stands between you and your promise is unbelief and if you foster it if you harbor it if you feed it if you give it the time of day it will grow but if you'll resist the devil just lift your hand this morning and say i resist this attack of satan against my life i bleed the blood of jesus christ over my life over my marriage over my home over my family over the charge that god has given me [Music] god has given you a dominion friend within his kingdom god has given you a dominion but until you recognize it until you stand up and let the power of god declare itself through your life you'll never fully realize the boundaries of your possession as given to you in this great abstract title of redemption but if you're standing here this morning saying i refuse to be weakened by the enemy and i'm here to declare today i'm driving down a stake and from this day forward i'm going to focus on the word of god and my identity in christ and i'm going to move in that direction as the holy spirit gives up and let the power of god form me and make me into what brings glory honor to him and to him alone lift your hand this morning as it has been spoken so may it be done [Music] may it be your unction and your voice heavenly father lived through our lives i do not believe william branham was your only mouthpiece but i believe lord through the ministry that came from that vessel you have quickened lord you have you have energized our lives to resound and to echo and to reverberate what has already sounded and to echo it into every corner of the earth until that last predestinated seed comes in lord let my life be a faithful witness to what you have sounded and may it continue lord to resound through your body your breath may we not be captured lord by this great and sobering and even depressing reality that faced elijah but lord you brought him to the mouth of the cave and you stood him up [Music] and you showed him lord that not only had you given him this ministry but you had given him followers it would continue on and even be magnified through the lives of those who had been activated by the message you brought through his life and lord that's where we are today may we not be defeated in our natural lineage but lord in the realization of who you have ordained and called us to be and the faith and confidence lord that you will do that for your own glory lord you're doing it now may we rest in that father may it absolve all lord of the tensions and all the strife and all the dissatisfaction and unrest lord that tries to grip our lives may the holy spirit speak peace now bring faith and confidence in your word and who we are peace [Music] over my eyes just open yourself now to his spirit wherever i pray in fact of love let's repeat that course now with all your hearts [Music] from the father [Music] just envelop me lord take charge father forever [Music] of love and there's never been a day there's never been a day like this there has never [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh there's never been a lot that shines so bright as this day this glorious let your heart swell with song to the lord oh there's never been a day like this stage hallelujah there has never been a day like this day my eyes can see oh there's never been a lie that shines god bless you brother so bright as this day oh there's never been a day like this [Music] never been a day like this [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] this day [Music] on the way in this morning my wife asked me a question about being human and struggling through those things [Music] and that simple question got a very uh very full answer today even we talked about elijah being in that same place god is so mindful of us and then our brother swanson sings oh what a savior oh what a savior tucson tabernacle god has spoken to you today he's with us he'll never leave us and let me just say it this way real simply the target is jesus christ and his word anything outside of that is not what we should be looking and aiming at and if you when you're shooting at that target and it's not hitting the target it's dead center don't move the target [Music] go back to the gun and make sure the gun is sighted right dead center on the target too many people have moved the target to where they're shooting and it's no longer jesus christ

you testify to that raise your hand up say lord i love you [Music] each day is like heaven my heart overflows a longer i serve him the sweeter he grows test him on that test him and see if he can't give him he's that overflowing fountain he'll never dry him up amen let's pray lord [Music] i don't know that we could have sat here for hours and said what is the best thing how could we put this all together to just meet the needs lord but you saw to it today you saw the desire of every heart you you you knew who who would be coming under what burden under what what question they would even have lord and you used lord a voice of our brother to minister because you love your children because she is dear to you your bride or this portion of your bride lord and we want to say thank you lord let

[Music] man [Music] of god above [Music] the scroll [Music] no stretch just before we're dismissed this morning for some reason i feel compelled to share this with you when we speak of how god can restore things back better and greater than before one illustration i've used is over in kentucky where they mine the coal oftentimes they use dynamite and very powerful machinery to destroy the mountains and the hills all in the effort to extract the coal the value from those hills and then they're required by law to rebuild those hills and mountains they call it they call it the um yes reclaiming they call it reclaiming that land reclamation and see they can put the dirt back they can they can make it resemble exactly what it looked like before they even have to plant grass and trees but they can't put the value back in it it takes god to do that so often we try to put things back together but it takes god that was originally there that can only be put back by god but i want your faith to be lifted this morning to believe for god that makes it better if it's your home it's your family whatever it is you know what it is say god i'm gonna believe you not only to restore it back to what it used to be but to make it better than it was before that's where god gets his glory and you're involved in that this morning your life is involved god has staked his reputation on your success [Music] because you are the proof you are the proof that calvary and the resurrection and the return of the holy spirit to the church you are today's proof of that victory so god has staked his reputation on your victory as a christian and god has never lost and never will so you can no more lose than he can lose have that confidence this morning and trust in him [Music] remember what you're going through is not god looking to see if there's gold in you but because there is gold in you you're going through it so the gold can be expressed amen god bless you as you go oh jehovah jireh is his name for him [Music] myself [Music] myself [Music] he lives and reigns he forever and reigns forever [Music] more blessed blessed be the rock of myself [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] is his name for him [Music] so [Music] so [Music] you
