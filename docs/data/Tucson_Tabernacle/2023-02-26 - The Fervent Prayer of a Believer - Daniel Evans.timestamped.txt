[27:43] have you too we met the other other day
[27:45] other night
[27:47] I am
[27:50] you know it's so important
[27:54] that we do gather together
[27:57] you know that's this is you might wonder
[28:00] why why is brother Daniel putting so
[28:02] much emphasis
[28:03] on getting the getting rooms together
[28:07] and getting the people together because
[28:10] because it's strength
[28:13] friends there's strength in unity a
[28:16] church is not a building a church is a
[28:19] unified Body of Christ and it is
[28:23] powerful
[28:25] and we need to
[28:26] we need to go before each other go
[28:30] before the Lord for each other as I read
[28:34] in James we we need to go to battle for
[28:37] each other we need to pray one for
[28:39] another because we're not going to make
[28:42] it on our own
[28:44] we need that's why God gave us each
[28:46] other is is for that strength and when
[28:50] we're praying when we start really
[28:53] praying when we start really getting
[28:55] into the spirit and we start praying one
[28:59] for another
[29:01] it will turn God's eyes to us
[29:05] I remember when Daniel was it was a baby
[29:08] and beholding him and and he'd be
[29:11] talking and and sometimes he would he
[29:14] would grab my face
[29:16] and he'd he'd turn it to me and he'd say
[29:19] Daddy
[29:20] listen to me
[29:24] and I'd be facing he I need something
[29:29] and that's how we are we we'll be
[29:33] praying and and Lord Lord I need
[29:35] something and then sometimes it's like
[29:38] Daddy I need you I need something and
[29:43] then he turns his face and I could never
[29:45] ignore him when he did that he he turns
[29:49] his face to us and he says okay son
[29:52] okay daughter what do you need
[29:55] and then we ask for my daughter for my
[29:59] son for my husband for my wife for a
[30:01] parent whatever it is if we can just get
[30:04] his attention
[30:06] then he'll turn his face
[30:09] to us
[30:10] and he'll
[30:12] he'll hear
[30:14] the devil might get in there
[30:16] and the devil tries to separate us
[30:19] friends he tries to he tries to pull us
[30:22] apart
[30:23] he doesn't want us together he he wants
[30:26] us he wants us separated he there's a
[30:29] there's movements out that that you you
[30:31] shouldn't go to church you can just stay
[30:33] stay home and and either listen to a
[30:36] tape at home or or stream in another
[30:39] service at home but he wants us together
[30:44] he wants us together not just in on
[30:47] Sunday morning
[30:48] but he wants us together like we're
[30:50] trying to do during the week just just
[30:53] fellowshipping with each other there is
[30:55] strength in numbers
[30:57] fellowshipping with each other loving
[31:00] one another and praying one for another
[31:03] and he's there he is there to hear us
[31:07] I remember I was I was just in the
[31:11] lowest time of my life a few years ago
[31:15] and I was just like Lord help me we
[31:18] continue to pray and we pray Lord I need
[31:22] you
[31:23] and then like the little baby grabbing
[31:28] the dad's head and facing
[31:31] I just put my
[31:35] head down on my desk I said Lord get me
[31:39] out of here and he heard me
[31:42] he heard my prayer
[31:45] Psalm 120 says in my distress I crawl I
[31:51] Cried unto the Lord and he heard me
[31:55] what a beautiful beautiful scripture
[31:58] it's happened to so many it's happened
[32:00] to all of us Lord I need you and then
[32:04] all right I hear you my son my daughter
[32:09] I I hear
[32:11] there's I've had
[32:13] quite a few questions over the past
[32:16] couple weeks from different brothers
[32:19] that they're not part of this
[32:21] congregation
[32:23] but just confused
[32:27] and just struggling
[32:29] and and coming coming and saying saying
[32:33] brother Daniel but brother Branham said
[32:36] this over here and then we're doing this
[32:39] over here and then he said this over
[32:41] here and I'm just I'm so confused I
[32:44] don't know what to do
[32:46] then one brother told me he says I'm
[32:47] worldly
[32:49] he says I'm backslidden
[32:52] he says he says my life he says he says
[32:54] all it is he says I'm just confused and
[32:57] then I said brother
[32:59] I said you are putting a man
[33:03] whoever that man may be it may be your
[33:05] pastor it may be whoever it is you are
[33:07] putting a man between you and Christ
[33:12] and if you try to do that of course
[33:15] you're going to be confused when you get
[33:19] on your knees set aside all of these
[33:21] things set aside all of these worries
[33:23] set aside all the confusion and pray to
[33:28] God and don't worry about it and when he
[33:32] answers back listen to him don't say
[33:37] don't don't just throw it out because it
[33:39] doesn't it doesn't match what you think
[33:42] or what you've been taught
[33:44] get on your knees and cry out to God
[33:48] and whenever
[33:50] we put anyone a mother or a father or or
[33:56] a priest or a pastor or anything between
[33:59] us and God
[34:01] it's against the Scriptures it doesn't
[34:04] work
[34:05] go straight to him and that's why all of
[34:08] this confusion and
[34:11] a number
[34:12] just in the past couple of weeks number
[34:15] of people have reached out
[34:17] and so I just don't understand
[34:21] quit trying to figure it out
[34:23] get on your knees
[34:26] have you prayed have you asked God
[34:29] well but I don't understand I don't care
[34:32] if you understand or not
[34:35] just go to him go to our lord Jesus and
[34:39] that is where you will find your answers
[34:44] titled my sermon is the prayer of a
[34:46] believer
[34:47] this morning and
[34:49] as I read
[34:50] in the book of James
[34:53] James is
[34:54] James was a pastor of a church
[34:58] he was a pastor of the church in
[35:00] Jerusalem and as he was writing the
[35:04] these these document he was maybe
[35:07] writing it to those of the 12 tribes
[35:09] that were maybe not at home but he was
[35:12] trying to get the message to them and
[35:14] say listen here is here's what you have
[35:16] to hear
[35:18] is what you need to do
[35:20] and James and loving the people
[35:24] he says
[35:26] in verse 13 chapter 5 he says is any
[35:30] among you afflicted
[35:32] let him pray
[35:34] is any Mary let him sing Psalms is any
[35:37] sick among you let him call for the
[35:39] Elders of the church and let them pray
[35:41] over him and anoint him with oil in the
[35:45] name of the Lord and you see that's why
[35:48] many times we will people will come up
[35:50] and brother Aaron especially he will
[35:52] take the the anointing oil
[35:55] and he will anoint the people and we'll
[35:57] pray over them according to this
[36:00] scripture
[36:01] and it's a promise that if we do that
[36:05] that the prayer of faith
[36:08] shall save the sick
[36:11] and the Lord shall raise him up
[36:14] and if you have committed sins
[36:16] they shall be forgiven him
[36:18] not only will the person be healed of
[36:21] his sickness but he will also be
[36:24] forgiven of his sins and which would you
[36:25] rather have
[36:27] you can have both
[36:30] but we will be forgiven of our sins
[36:34] by something as simple
[36:37] as a prayer brother Jonathan a prayer
[36:43] confess your faults one to another
[36:47] and pray one for another that you may be
[36:50] healed
[36:51] the effectual fervent prayer
[36:55] of a righteous man a veileth much
[37:01] pray fervently the Bible says that when
[37:04] Jesus was in the Garden of Eden I
[37:06] believe it's in Luke Chapter uh end of
[37:09] Luke chapter 22 when Jesus was in The
[37:12] Garden of Gethsemane and he was on his
[37:15] knees and he was praying and and blood
[37:18] and water were coming from him and he
[37:21] was just he was so burdened
[37:25] the Bible says that he fervently prayed
[37:28] he was agonizing over this prayer
[37:32] and he was praying for his people and he
[37:35] even said he even made the statement as
[37:38] he was praying there in the garden he
[37:39] said Lord let this cup pass from me
[37:44] I don't want to go to the cross
[37:46] but then
[37:47] he said but thy will be done
[37:50] imagine if he wouldn't have said that
[37:52] for a while
[37:53] there wouldn't be any salvation
[37:55] but the Son of God said but first Lord I
[37:58] put your will
[38:00] puts your will first
[38:05] we friends we should pray
[38:09] fervently in that same manner that Jesus
[38:14] prayed we should be praying for one
[38:16] another
[38:17] not not for not not necessarily always
[38:20] for yourself we cry out for the Lord and
[38:23] he hears us
[38:25] but that same dedication
[38:29] should be applied to our prayers for
[38:31] each other and our prayers for ourselves
[38:33] how getting on your knees
[38:36] and just saying Lord help brother lion
[38:38] sister Heather as they travel
[38:42] there's more than that
[38:45] help sister so and so because her her
[38:47] daughter her sons out in the world not
[38:50] living right
[38:52] Where is the fervency
[38:55] where is the the the
[38:57] heartfelt desire Lord God help this
[39:01] person that's when as the little boy he
[39:05] turns his dad he said that's when
[39:06] daddy's head turns
[39:09] and it happens then
[39:12] that's that's when that is that is what
[39:15] we have to get to and how many of us are
[39:17] there
[39:19] how many of us am I there
[39:21] I look at my own life and I say Lord I
[39:24] fall short of this what I'm preaching
[39:27] today
[39:28] I do I want more
[39:31] I was
[39:33] one little thing that blessed me so much
[39:35] this morning
[39:36] I was just
[39:38] just in in the apartment there and
[39:42] and uh
[39:44] sister came on my heart
[39:46] I said Lord
[39:47] help this sister
[39:50] and she texted me at that very moment
[39:55] and I hadn't talked with her for a long
[39:57] time but at that very moment right after
[40:01] I had prayed for her the phone rang if a
[40:03] phone dings with the text
[40:05] and it was her I believe it was just the
[40:08] Lord saying pray for my children
[40:12] more pray for them
[40:15] there was a a sister I had met and we
[40:19] talk about prayer warriors let me tell
[40:21] you there are really prayer warriors in
[40:23] this world
[40:25] and all of us should be one of those
[40:28] there was a sister that I met
[40:30] I was in Jeffersonville she lived in
[40:32] West Virginia
[40:35] she had a sister had a rough life
[40:39] she she lived alone she lived way back
[40:43] in the hills of West Virginia all by
[40:47] herself she was in her upper 80s
[40:50] and she had her family was was just
[40:53] wayward
[40:55] and
[40:56] she had she really she had had no one
[41:00] her name was Sister Jarvis Josephine
[41:02] Jarvis was her name so it might be some
[41:05] here that know who she is
[41:07] she uh
[41:10] didn't know her parents she's orphaned
[41:12] as a child
[41:13] she grew up in an orphanage she got
[41:15] polio and got crippled in her leg and
[41:18] she had to walk sideways
[41:20] as a little girl
[41:23] sweet lady
[41:25] and it was and and as she was as she was
[41:28] growing up she always wanted to to be
[41:30] athletic and play like the other kids
[41:32] and she wanted a set of roller skates
[41:35] since this was in the depression
[41:37] she had it hard and she prayed Lord Lord
[41:41] I I need this and she's living there she
[41:44] has no siblings she's by herself and the
[41:47] teacher
[41:48] her
[41:49] daughter or son or whoever it was had
[41:52] grown out of a pair of roller skates
[41:55] and
[41:57] she tells the class she says we're going
[41:59] to have a contest a coloring contest
[42:02] and whoever wins this contest is going
[42:04] to get these skates
[42:06] so sister Jarvis you know the little
[42:09] girl she practiced coloring and
[42:11] practiced and she made the most
[42:14] beautiful picture
[42:16] coloring and she won the contest
[42:22] but they didn't give her the roller
[42:23] skates because she was crippled
[42:26] and she said it just devastated me
[42:30] she wanted to be like the other kids so
[42:32] when the kids would go roller skating
[42:34] sometimes she was able to buy to borrow
[42:37] one of her friends skates just one
[42:39] because the one leg was crippled I
[42:41] believe it's her left leg was crippled
[42:42] and she would she would put the roller
[42:45] skate on the one leg and she was able to
[42:48] skate around and she sounds like she was
[42:51] athletic she was able to to do
[42:53] everything that the other kids could do
[42:55] she ended up crippled as she was she
[42:58] ended up playing softball with with the
[43:01] friends and she said she she says I was
[43:04] good brother Daniel foreign
[43:07] the lord gave first gave her courage
[43:11] she grew up
[43:13] she married an awful man
[43:16] he he he mistreated her and and he would
[43:21] just he brought her to Phoenix one day
[43:22] they were there they were traveling
[43:24] across the country he brought her to
[43:26] Phoenix dropped her off and left her
[43:30] her and her child
[43:33] just left her
[43:35] didn't say anything she was able to find
[43:37] this man
[43:39] there was a church there she found this
[43:41] man named brother outlaw have you heard
[43:44] of brother outlaw
[43:45] she found this man she found this church
[43:47] he took her in he helped her out
[43:50] and then she got introduced to this
[43:53] other man
[43:55] well she was there named William Branham
[43:58] wow
[44:00] this man's got something special
[44:04] so she as time goes on
[44:07] her husband a a smile because she smiled
[44:11] when she said it she said he came back
[44:13] and and found her again and brought her
[44:15] back to West Virginia and he said she
[44:18] said she used to he used to beat her
[44:21] and he said she said one time the spirit
[44:24] of the Lord came over me when he was
[44:27] going to beater and she said she started
[44:29] speaking in tongues and scared the liver
[44:31] out of him
[44:33] and he never beat her from that time on
[44:37] the Lord just taking care of his his
[44:39] daughter
[44:41] the reason I'm talking about sister
[44:43] Jarvis is because that lady prayed
[44:47] she was oh brother could you put the
[44:49] picture up there I'm sorry that uh
[44:52] um
[44:53] she prayed and she knew how to talk to
[44:57] God because she had gone through it
[45:00] so
[45:02] she um
[45:03] a few of the brothers and I went over to
[45:07] help her out I think she wrote in a
[45:10] letter on email I don't remember how she
[45:11] contacted us but she was asking for for
[45:17] prayer or help for her son who was in
[45:19] Florida was a sinner
[45:21] and so I started corresponding with this
[45:24] lady I gave her a call
[45:25] and
[45:27] she uh
[45:29] I was talking I said wow there's
[45:31] something special about this sister
[45:32] Jarvis
[45:34] she's got it she has something that I
[45:36] want there she is right there
[45:38] in her house
[45:40] and so she I said sister I said is there
[45:44] anything we can do for you she said well
[45:46] I don't have any she says well they
[45:48] haven't wrapped if you see in the corner
[45:49] there you see some plastic
[45:52] and what they would what a brother from
[45:55] Ohio who knew her would do is he would
[45:58] show up
[45:59] in the winter and wrap her whole house
[46:01] in plastic
[46:04] on the outside so the draft wouldn't
[46:06] come in
[46:08] she was poor
[46:11] so we we went there
[46:14] and
[46:16] she she was telling us about some of the
[46:19] things that had happened to her and she
[46:22] was telling me about the her husband and
[46:24] and about these testimonies
[46:27] and she uh
[46:29] she says well you know
[46:31] she says I was in Washington DC
[46:36] when brother Branham preached the Deep
[46:39] cloth to the Deep
[46:40] she says I was there at Centennial Hall
[46:42] I think it was Centennial Hall was the
[46:44] name of the place
[46:46] I said really she says yeah she says I
[46:49] was sitting up in the balcony
[46:50] and during the Deep calls to the Deep
[46:52] brother Branham calls out a lady that
[46:55] was up in the balcony he said she said
[46:58] she had like a a hair wrap on her hair
[47:00] and and she had a jar
[47:04] there and she says I was looking at that
[47:07] jar and brother Branham said that's the
[47:10] lady that yesterday yesterday had cancer
[47:14] and that cancer had fallen off and she
[47:17] put it in a jar of alcohol and brought
[47:20] it to the next service
[47:22] completely here assistant driver said I
[47:24] saw that
[47:25] that's what the prayer does
[47:28] and we think it we look at brother
[47:29] Branham and
[47:31] and these things that had happened these
[47:33] these great Miracles that have happened
[47:35] look at the scripture I just read the
[47:39] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[47:43] man
[47:44] that is what did it
[47:48] Miracle after Miracle after miracle
[47:51] healing after healing after healing
[47:54] fervent prayer
[47:57] their sister Jarvis she said I saw it
[47:59] there was that the bottle there and and
[48:01] that and she said
[48:03] she was
[48:04] she would just pray for people all the
[48:07] time
[48:09] and I started after I went to visit her
[48:12] she made such an impression on me
[48:15] that I started researching this lady
[48:19] Josephine Jarvis
[48:22] she has led
[48:25] many
[48:27] families to the Lord Jesus
[48:31] families that you would know
[48:34] if I said and
[48:36] I don't see any relation in here now but
[48:39] families that you would know
[48:42] if I would say them
[48:45] um some of the Phillips Family David
[48:47] Phillips there's there's sister Jarvis
[48:49] there and Brother Sam borders
[48:51] he cuts his hair like I do
[48:53] um
[48:55] brother Chad Vaughn there's sister
[48:56] Jarvis right in the middle
[49:00] um
[49:01] and others
[49:03] that that lady
[49:06] because of just her testimony living in
[49:10] the middle of nowhere
[49:12] in the hills of West Virginia
[49:14] LED these people to the Lord one of them
[49:18] one of the people she led he was working
[49:20] on the gas lines
[49:22] and this little old lady she you know
[49:24] she's hobbling she's she it sounds like
[49:26] when she walks it's a mechanical sound
[49:29] it goes like she can't
[49:34] precious and she's like that tall and
[49:36] you know maybe a hundred pounds she is
[49:39] just absolutely the sweetest thing in
[49:41] the world and and she would walk and and
[49:44] when we were there she she said brother
[49:46] Daniel I didn't have anything really
[49:49] left we uh it's been snowing so the
[49:51] neighbors hadn't been able to take me to
[49:54] to town she said but I had a turkey in
[49:57] the freezer that's all I had and I made
[49:59] it and she fed us that turkey
[50:02] it's good
[50:04] so we were able to fill our covered
[50:06] coverage with food and and
[50:09] help of the house and put some
[50:11] insulation in there and we became
[50:14] friends me and this little old lady
[50:17] and she would call me and
[50:20] tell me that she was praying for this
[50:22] person or that person and they would get
[50:24] healed
[50:26] and like I said LED
[50:30] I mean besides maybe some ministers that
[50:32] I know more people to the Lord than
[50:34] anyone I've ever met that little lady
[50:36] right there
[50:39] one day she called me
[50:41] like I said she's about 90. by the time
[50:44] she called me this at this time
[50:47] and she said brother Daniel she said I
[50:50] need you to pray for me
[50:53] she said
[50:54] I I went to the doctor had some pain and
[50:58] she says I have they said I have cancer
[51:01] all through
[51:02] my organs
[51:05] and
[51:06] I said I said okay sister I said
[51:10] I said I'll pray for you
[51:12] and and she said
[51:15] and I prayed for her
[51:17] just a simple prayer
[51:19] Lord Jesus I pray that you have mercy on
[51:21] my sister
[51:23] and she said okay thank you I'm Healed
[51:29] okay you know it's that's good I prayed
[51:33] for a lot of people I've seen people get
[51:35] healed and many haven't but I've never
[51:37] had that type of response
[51:40] I'm Healed I said okay
[51:43] so didn't hear for her from remember
[51:45] from a little while and
[51:47] and a caller and she's still kicking
[51:51] and uh oh God bless you brother Daniel
[51:55] how are you feeling oh I feel good I
[51:57] feel good no pain at all she says I
[51:59] can't go to the doctors because she said
[52:01] it's it's too big of a of a an effort to
[52:04] get my neighbors to drive me to to the
[52:07] to get treatment so I couldn't have
[52:08] treatment she said that's why I asked
[52:10] you to pray for me she said I would have
[52:12] gone but I couldn't I couldn't get away
[52:13] to get over there
[52:14] she said so I just
[52:17] called you to pray for me I feel good
[52:20] praise the Lord
[52:22] good
[52:23] wow that's the way it should work
[52:27] years
[52:29] go by
[52:32] like two years
[52:34] staying in touch with sister Jarvis
[52:37] I call her how you feeling I feel good
[52:40] praise the Lord Brother I listen to this
[52:42] tape read this read this scripture I
[52:44] just bro Daniel I'm always praying for
[52:46] you and your little wife and your little
[52:48] family
[52:49] God bless you all I'm thinking
[52:51] I know where she lives
[52:55] praying fervently
[52:58] so she went to the doctor
[53:01] after after that a couple years after we
[53:04] had prayed
[53:06] and the doctor didn't expect her to be
[53:08] alive because he had told her before
[53:10] that you only have a couple months to
[53:12] live
[53:13] maybe not even that long if you don't
[53:16] get treatment if you get treatment
[53:20] so she went back after a few years and
[53:23] the doctor examined her went through the
[53:26] scan or whatever it was and said I can't
[53:28] explain it
[53:30] he said the cancer is still there
[53:34] but it hasn't grown at all
[53:36] in fact he says it's smaller than it was
[53:39] years ago
[53:41] he says this is one of the most
[53:42] aggressive types of cancer he says I
[53:45] can't explain it but all I know is it's
[53:47] still there
[53:49] the sister Jarvis said it's okay
[53:52] went on
[53:54] and and that I don't know she was about
[53:57] 94 95 years old see finally the Lord
[54:02] took her
[54:03] not too many years ago
[54:05] but I saw sister Jarvis
[54:08] as a genuine
[54:10] servant of God
[54:12] someone that prayed and God heard her
[54:16] prayer she knew how to do it she was in
[54:19] that home
[54:20] all day every day and she showed me she
[54:24] says here's why I pray she says but when
[54:26] I'm sore and I can't move around she
[54:28] says and she showed me a chair over here
[54:30] she says I pray in this chair
[54:33] and she says I just pray for the people
[54:35] all day and I just cry out to the Lord
[54:37] and she told me this she says you know
[54:40] one day
[54:43] she said
[54:45] you know she didn't have anybody in her
[54:47] family
[54:49] any of her ancestors she didn't know
[54:52] anyone in her family was a sinner
[54:55] she was by herself
[54:58] and she said
[54:59] you know brother Daniel she says one day
[55:03] I just expect a
[55:05] here knock at the door
[55:07] and she said I expect to go up there and
[55:11] open the door and she says you know in
[55:14] the Bible it says that the dead in
[55:16] Christ shall rise first
[55:19] and those of us that are alive and
[55:22] remain will be caught up together with
[55:24] them
[55:25] she said I just expect one day and like
[55:28] I said she didn't have anybody in her
[55:30] family really she didn't have Rod over
[55:32] the other side she didn't like me I
[55:34] didn't have not my dad or my mom anybody
[55:37] she didn't know anybody
[55:39] none of her family
[55:42] she said I expect to go to that door one
[55:45] day and open it up and there would be
[55:46] brother Branham say good morning friend
[55:49] it's time to go home
[55:52] and she said you know she said it may
[55:55] not happen that way but she said these
[55:57] beautiful words she said but it's just a
[56:00] wonderful thought
[56:01] I thought amen that's the right attitude
[56:05] whether it happens that way or not it
[56:08] will far exceed whatever she was hoping
[56:11] for
[56:14] sister Jarvis was a precious
[56:16] sister but she was a human being
[56:20] verse number 17. in James chapter 5.
[56:28] it says Elias
[56:30] was a man subject to like passions as we
[56:33] are
[56:35] and he prayed earnestly that it might
[56:38] not rain and it rained not on the Earth
[56:40] by the space of three years and six
[56:44] months notice that right after James
[56:46] says that the effectual fervent prayer
[56:48] of a righteous man he says Elijah was
[56:51] somebody just like us
[56:54] and he struggled with the same things we
[56:56] struggle with
[56:57] you know I I say it a lot
[56:59] that don't think you're special
[57:02] and the same thing James is saying right
[57:05] here about the Prophet Elijah he said he
[57:09] was like we are
[57:11] yet he prayed
[57:14] earnestly that it might not rain and it
[57:17] rained not on the Earth by the space of
[57:19] three years and six months
[57:24] like sister Jarvis
[57:26] like you and me
[57:29] if we will be sincere when we pray then
[57:34] God will hear these prayers
[57:36] I've heard so often and it's
[57:38] it's a mischaracterization of the word
[57:42] I've heard so often that when brother
[57:44] Branham had that experience with the
[57:46] angel at tunnel Mill in Jeffersonville
[57:49] when the angel came to him and gave his
[57:51] commission to go and pray for the sick
[57:53] you know what we just heard the tape not
[57:54] too long ago how the angel came to me in
[57:56] his Commission
[57:58] I have heard that brother branham's
[58:00] commission was to get the people to
[58:01] believe you
[58:03] that is not what the angel said
[58:07] the angel said if you can get the people
[58:11] to believe you if
[58:14] you can get the people to believe you
[58:16] and be sincere when you pray
[58:20] then
[58:22] nothing will stand before your prayer
[58:24] not even cancer
[58:27] he was talking about Divine Healing
[58:30] and it happened and let me tell you if
[58:33] anyone proved that the effectual fervent
[58:36] forever righteous man Avail as much it
[58:38] was William Branham
[58:40] thousands of people coming through the
[58:42] prayer lines there's people alive today
[58:45] that were healed in his meetings
[58:49] shows that God's word is true
[58:53] and he Elijah prayed again
[58:57] and Heaven and the heaven gave rain and
[59:00] the Earth brought forth her fruit
[59:03] James is encouraging us to pray and have
[59:06] faith in our prayers that God hears us
[59:10] and he's saying that this Elijah
[59:13] one of the greatest prophets That Ever
[59:15] Walked this Earth
[59:16] he was a man just like we are
[59:20] we
[59:21] we pray for each other
[59:25] but
[59:27] how many of us
[59:29] are praying like this word says
[59:33] you know we get down on our knees and
[59:36] and like brother Aaron's been sick
[59:39] you're down on on my knees and and I'm I
[59:43] try to when when I pray in the morning I
[59:47] have a picture in my mind of the
[59:49] congregation
[59:50] and I go row by row and I start here so
[59:53] sister Shirley Yoon brother Jeremy and
[59:55] sister Angela you usually the first ones
[59:57] that I pray for but I go row by row and
[1:00:00] I try to call everyone's name out
[1:00:03] and then I'll go to this one and I'll
[1:00:05] I'll go through that just from my memory
[1:00:07] and go over here
[1:00:10] and and talking and just mentioning
[1:00:13] everyone's name
[1:00:15] before the Lord
[1:00:18] and I believe that's right
[1:00:20] but there has to come a point
[1:00:22] when there is a need
[1:00:25] in the church
[1:00:27] that we have to go before the Lord with
[1:00:29] the same Earnest prayer like we are
[1:00:32] dying
[1:00:33] that we have to have this Lord this is
[1:00:37] everything you have Lord Lord we need
[1:00:40] this this person's crying out it may be
[1:00:43] a son or a daughter
[1:00:45] maybe someone that's fallen into sin
[1:00:48] but Lord
[1:00:50] this this family
[1:00:52] saved this young man this young woman
[1:00:57] Lord I just feel for what was it what if
[1:00:59] that was my Daniel what if that was my
[1:01:02] son
[1:01:03] and we get in we get into that suffering
[1:01:05] and and we cry out to the Lord
[1:01:09] and then something happens
[1:01:12] that
[1:01:14] face of God
[1:01:16] turns
[1:01:18] and he says I heard you
[1:01:20] and it happened to me it's happened to
[1:01:22] me a few times in my life and I said oh
[1:01:25] God
[1:01:26] you heard me
[1:01:29] and then he would he provided not
[1:01:32] necessarily what I was asking for
[1:01:35] but he provided what was right because
[1:01:39] he knew my heart my heart was not
[1:01:41] necessarily to get what I wanted
[1:01:45] when we pray that way many times that's
[1:01:47] why we don't get our prayers answered
[1:01:49] you have to ask ourselves Lord is this
[1:01:51] what I want
[1:01:53] or is this your will I believe it's
[1:01:56] Romans chapter 8 said that the the
[1:01:59] spirit itself makes intercessions
[1:02:03] with things that cannot even be uttered
[1:02:06] for when that Holy Spirit is speaking
[1:02:09] through us that's when we are in that
[1:02:11] channel
[1:02:13] I think about
[1:02:15] that's the way that we need to be for
[1:02:18] each other we need to have such love for
[1:02:20] each other that it's the same as if it
[1:02:23] was my son or my daughter
[1:02:26] pray one for another
[1:02:31] and uh
[1:02:33] one more when we're praying
[1:02:35] we're down on our knees
[1:02:39] Lord I I am short on money this month
[1:02:43] Lord I I need this Lord I need that
[1:02:48] I can't afford my Netflix bill they just
[1:02:50] went up
[1:02:51] can't afford my cable bill
[1:02:54] I can't I can't
[1:02:56] afford the car you know I can't put I'm
[1:02:58] having all these troubles and uh and
[1:03:01] help brother Island sister Heather in
[1:03:02] Jesus name amen
[1:03:06] I don't know if he hears those prayers
[1:03:09] because they're not as sincere as they
[1:03:13] should be
[1:03:14] we need to get down if there is someone
[1:03:19] that's suffering
[1:03:22] it needs to be a fervent prayer in Acts
[1:03:26] chapter 12. we see a wonderful example
[1:03:30] James was killed by Herod
[1:03:35] and Herod saw that ah this pleased the
[1:03:38] Jews yeah we can make some inroads here
[1:03:42] and
[1:03:43] he he says well if James is killed then
[1:03:47] let me go get the other leader let me go
[1:03:49] get this guy named Peter
[1:03:51] and then that'll really please these
[1:03:54] Jews so here it goes and he has Peter
[1:03:57] arrested and he's put in prison and he's
[1:03:59] put in there and he he was so tightly
[1:04:01] locked down that there was two guards
[1:04:04] laying beside him on either side and he
[1:04:07] was in Chains there was no way this guy
[1:04:09] could get out
[1:04:11] and it says here verse 5.
[1:04:15] Peter therefore was kept in prison
[1:04:18] but prayer was made without ceasing
[1:04:22] of the church
[1:04:26] unto God for him
[1:04:30] why
[1:04:32] is this Tucson Tabernacle
[1:04:35] any different
[1:04:38] than the church at Jerusalem
[1:04:41] it's the same God am I right
[1:04:43] it's the same one that we're praying to
[1:04:45] that they prayed to 2000 years ago am I
[1:04:49] right it's the same God that was with
[1:04:52] Adam in the Garden of Eden am I right
[1:04:55] it's the same God so why can we not pray
[1:04:59] to that same God just as they prayed
[1:05:02] we can
[1:05:05] prayer without ceasing this Earnest
[1:05:08] prayer
[1:05:11] and
[1:05:12] what happened
[1:05:14] was an angel walked into the prison
[1:05:19] and says hey Peter wake up
[1:05:22] change fell off he says hurry up
[1:05:26] we got to get out of here
[1:05:27] Peter's like
[1:05:29] I'm seeing a vision
[1:05:31] this can't happen so it gets up and he's
[1:05:34] following the angel and there's light
[1:05:35] this light comes in the room Peter's
[1:05:38] walking out
[1:05:40] he gets out out of the prison he gets
[1:05:42] out on the street
[1:05:45] whoa that was real
[1:05:48] that wasn't a dream
[1:05:49] that wasn't a vision this really just
[1:05:52] happened
[1:05:53] you can read it in Acts chapter chapter
[1:05:55] 12.
[1:05:57] it's right there
[1:05:58] so then Peter is like well
[1:06:01] I know where to go so he goes to Mary's
[1:06:04] house
[1:06:05] and that is where the church was praying
[1:06:09] for Peter
[1:06:11] so he goes there
[1:06:13] and and he knocks on the door
[1:06:18] let's read let's read verse 12.
[1:06:21] oh we can go I'll read 12s keep it on 13
[1:06:23] there and and when he had considered the
[1:06:26] thing he came to the house of Mary the
[1:06:27] mother of John whose surname was Mark
[1:06:31] where many were gathered together
[1:06:33] praying and as I said there is something
[1:06:36] about praying together Brethren if you
[1:06:39] could check the Stream
[1:06:41] I don't know if it went off
[1:06:44] there is something about
[1:06:47] praying together
[1:06:50] and everywhere in the Bible there is
[1:06:52] strength in unity and we see that that
[1:06:56] they were together praying so Peter
[1:06:58] walks up to the door
[1:07:04] and this little lady named Rhoda
[1:07:06] she's like I'll get it she goes up
[1:07:10] whoa
[1:07:12] that's Peter and she leaves the door
[1:07:14] closed she goes and she said hey Peter's
[1:07:16] here and you know what they said
[1:07:19] yeah right
[1:07:22] what a strange situation they've just
[1:07:24] been praying without ceasing
[1:07:26] and when God answered the prayer oh yeah
[1:07:29] right
[1:07:30] sure
[1:07:31] well
[1:07:32] she's like no really
[1:07:35] and then finally she convinced somebody
[1:07:37] probably to go back and Peter's still
[1:07:39] waiting at the door he's like what's
[1:07:40] going on
[1:07:41] I'm home I'm out here on the street
[1:07:43] so finally they let him in and they're
[1:07:45] like wow this is this is just this is
[1:07:49] amazing
[1:07:50] in fact they they told they told Rhoda
[1:07:53] they said you're crazy
[1:07:55] for thinking this
[1:07:57] verse 16 but Peter continued knocking
[1:08:00] and when they had opened the door and
[1:08:01] they saw him they were astonished but he
[1:08:04] beckoned unto them with the hand
[1:08:06] to hold their peace and declare it unto
[1:08:09] them how the Lord had brought him out of
[1:08:11] the prison and he said go show these
[1:08:14] things into James and the bro and to the
[1:08:16] Brethren and depart and they and he
[1:08:18] Departed
[1:08:20] and he went to another place
[1:08:23] prayer was made
[1:08:25] I met a brother years ago he's he's a
[1:08:28] Congolese brother he he lives in Congo
[1:08:32] missionary
[1:08:34] always witnessing and miracles followed
[1:08:38] his ministry
[1:08:40] his name brother shebango brother
[1:08:42] shebango he's he has a burden to go to
[1:08:45] the pygmy people
[1:08:47] in central Congo
[1:08:51] and he's praying for these people he
[1:08:53] wanted to introduce them to the living
[1:08:55] Jesus Christ and he said Lord he says I
[1:09:00] want
[1:09:00] to preach to them he says but I don't
[1:09:03] speak their language
[1:09:05] the pygmy language
[1:09:07] and he says I don't know what to do I
[1:09:09] don't know how to find a translator and
[1:09:11] he asked the Lord he said Lord help me
[1:09:13] he says provide a translator whatever it
[1:09:16] is I have need of Lord if you want me to
[1:09:19] go then provide someone to help me
[1:09:22] preach
[1:09:23] and this trip was way up
[1:09:26] from uh from kissing you have to you
[1:09:29] have to go up in the river and and hike
[1:09:32] in and and it's just it's a horrible
[1:09:34] trip very dangerous trip
[1:09:36] so they get in there
[1:09:39] and he's he says Lord I'm gonna pray I'm
[1:09:42] gonna fast about this I feel led to fast
[1:09:47] fasted seven days
[1:09:50] asking the Lord to provide
[1:09:52] something
[1:09:54] that would help him preach to these
[1:09:56] pygmy people
[1:09:59] seven days passed
[1:10:02] he got hungry
[1:10:04] and he said Lord
[1:10:07] I'm hungry
[1:10:08] I'm going to eat so he fixes himself a
[1:10:10] nice meal
[1:10:12] and he he sits down to his meal
[1:10:16] and he bows to pray
[1:10:19] and he begins speaking
[1:10:21] in the pygmy language fluently and to
[1:10:25] this day
[1:10:26] he is fluent in that pygmy language and
[1:10:29] preaching the gospel to the pygmies led
[1:10:32] many of them to the Lord Jesus
[1:10:36] a miracle yeah you can clap
[1:10:43] praise God
[1:10:46] for that it shows that God answers
[1:10:50] prayer
[1:10:53] you know and and the biggest thing with
[1:10:55] this brother the burden wasn't for
[1:10:57] himself
[1:10:58] it was a legitimate cause
[1:11:01] there was a
[1:11:04] let's let's turn to Matthew chapter 18.
[1:11:07] I want to read this it's Jesus talking
[1:11:09] he makes he makes a simple little
[1:11:11] statement here in Matthew 18 18 He says
[1:11:13] verily I say unto you
[1:11:16] whatsoever you shall bind on Earth shall
[1:11:19] be bound in heaven
[1:11:21] and whatsoever you shall loose on Earth
[1:11:22] shall be loosed in heaven again I say
[1:11:25] unto you if two of you shall agree on
[1:11:29] Earth as touching anything
[1:11:33] that they shall ask
[1:11:35] it shall be done for them of My Father
[1:11:38] which is in heaven what a promise from
[1:11:42] our lord Jesus
[1:11:43] verse 20 says for where two or three are
[1:11:46] gathered in my name there I am in the
[1:11:48] midst of them
[1:11:50] we need that at our church and at every
[1:11:55] Church in this world
[1:11:56] that is one day
[1:12:00] and it has to start somewhere
[1:12:03] it has to start with prayer
[1:12:07] and I was and the Lord he turns He he'll
[1:12:11] just turn his head
[1:12:13] sometimes
[1:12:14] I was preaching last Sunday morning
[1:12:17] let's get you to go to church
[1:12:21] I was preaching last Sunday morning
[1:12:24] and we were
[1:12:26] I was ministering about about the
[1:12:28] Revival and about Asbury and and how the
[1:12:31] Lord is moving there among those people
[1:12:33] and who are we to judge
[1:12:36] if that's God or not I've heard from
[1:12:37] from different Minister Brothers saying
[1:12:40] oh well that's the foolish that's the
[1:12:41] foolish virgin and and and they're going
[1:12:43] to find they're gonna they're gonna find
[1:12:45] that they don't have oil and all this no
[1:12:47] no no no no no no no
[1:12:49] my Jesus said judge not that you be not
[1:12:51] judged
[1:12:53] if God is moving there
[1:12:55] Maybe
[1:12:58] we are the foolish ones
[1:13:01] how foolish can we be in trying to judge
[1:13:04] someone else and say that's not God
[1:13:06] we're better than that
[1:13:07] they are praying all night long and I
[1:13:11] was talking about that and I said this I
[1:13:13] said I said something on the order of
[1:13:17] I think
[1:13:19] that God is going to give a Revival here
[1:13:22] in this Tucson Tabernacle you remember
[1:13:24] and the light started going on and off
[1:13:26] you remember that last week well what
[1:13:29] happened
[1:13:31] the live stream stopped
[1:13:34] so so the people on the other end they
[1:13:36] didn't get to see that
[1:13:38] it was a power surge or so it was a
[1:13:41] power surge is what it was it they came
[1:13:44] in and if if we weren't here
[1:13:49] then we would miss those things
[1:13:52] we need to be together and I know we
[1:13:55] have to sometimes we can't and sometimes
[1:13:57] we have to miss and I know the Lord
[1:13:58] understands that but there needs to be
[1:14:00] more and more and more going on in the
[1:14:03] church to where we don't want to miss it
[1:14:08] I uh
[1:14:11] I look at
[1:14:12] Ezekiel
[1:14:14] chapter nine and it's a famous scripture
[1:14:16] we can all Quote it by heart
[1:14:19] and it says this and it says I'll read
[1:14:22] it chapter uh yeah verse 3. and the
[1:14:26] glory of the glory of the god of Israel
[1:14:29] was gone up from the Cherub where he
[1:14:32] where upon whereupon he was
[1:14:34] to the threshold of the house and he
[1:14:37] called to the man clothed with linen
[1:14:40] which had the writer's inkhorn by his
[1:14:43] side
[1:14:44] and the Lord said unto him go through
[1:14:46] the midst of the city through the midst
[1:14:48] of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the
[1:14:51] foreheads of the men that sigh and cry
[1:14:54] for the Abominations that be done in the
[1:14:57] midst thereof
[1:15:00] and to the others he said in my hearing
[1:15:02] go ye after him through the city and
[1:15:05] smite
[1:15:06] let not your eyes spare neither have ye
[1:15:08] pity
[1:15:09] slay utterly old and young both maids
[1:15:13] and little children and women but come
[1:15:16] not near any man upon whom is the mark
[1:15:20] and begin
[1:15:23] at My Sanctuary
[1:15:25] start right here
[1:15:27] in church
[1:15:29] that judgment will start right here
[1:15:33] then they began
[1:15:36] um
[1:15:36] the ancient men they began at the
[1:15:39] ancient men which were before the house
[1:15:43] think about that
[1:15:44] I think about
[1:15:47] Lord
[1:15:48] I am falling so short
[1:15:52] in my prayer life
[1:15:55] I'm praying for the people but Lord that
[1:15:58] fervency
[1:15:59] that I've seen that sister Jarvis had
[1:16:04] I need something more
[1:16:07] there has to be something something more
[1:16:10] happened to me
[1:16:12] I Lord I need it I I need I just want to
[1:16:16] just grab your holy holy faces as my son
[1:16:21] did and say Lord Jesus hear me
[1:16:24] I need you
[1:16:27] and then cry out for the others it and
[1:16:30] there's there's a prayer that I wanted
[1:16:32] to read a beautiful prayer from a man of
[1:16:35] God
[1:16:36] named Paul
[1:16:37] in Ephesians chapter 3.
[1:16:41] listen to the way that Paul prays for
[1:16:45] the people
[1:16:47] he says for this cause I bow my knees
[1:16:49] unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:54] here he is in heaven
[1:16:56] of whom the whole family in Heaven and
[1:16:59] Earth is named
[1:17:02] that he would Grant you according to the
[1:17:05] riches of his glory
[1:17:07] to be strengthened with the might by his
[1:17:10] spirit in the Inner Man
[1:17:12] that Christ May dwell in your hearts by
[1:17:16] faith that ye being rooted and grounded
[1:17:19] in love
[1:17:21] may be able to comprehend with all the
[1:17:24] saints what is the breadth and the
[1:17:26] length and the depth and the height
[1:17:29] and to know the love of Christ which
[1:17:32] passes all knowledge that ye might be
[1:17:36] filled with all the fullness of God
[1:17:40] think about the Holy Spirit and being
[1:17:42] filled with that
[1:17:44] now unto him that is able to do
[1:17:47] exceeding abundantly above all that we
[1:17:50] ask or think according to the power that
[1:17:53] worketh in US unto him be glory in the
[1:17:56] church
[1:17:57] by Christ Jesus throughout all the ages
[1:18:00] world without throughout all the ages
[1:18:03] World Without End
[1:18:05] amen is what our brother prayed how many
[1:18:09] of us pray like that
[1:18:13] we have to
[1:18:16] we have to spend the time we have to do
[1:18:19] our best when someone walks into this
[1:18:22] church
[1:18:23] When a Stranger Comes into this church
[1:18:25] what are they searching for
[1:18:28] are they searching for a preacher
[1:18:31] I can blow you away with this intellect
[1:18:33] that can take this book and and tie this
[1:18:36] scripture in with that scripture and go
[1:18:39] back to the Greek and say Well it means
[1:18:40] this and and then well the Old Testament
[1:18:43] it would go to the Hebrew here and the
[1:18:44] Aramaic here and here's what it actually
[1:18:46] means you think they're looking for that
[1:18:49] or do you think they're looking for for
[1:18:51] someone that has a good sense of humor
[1:18:53] that can entertain them that can make
[1:18:55] them laugh
[1:18:57] that has some Charisma that could keep
[1:19:00] their attention you think they're
[1:19:01] looking for that if they're sincere
[1:19:04] or do you think they're looking
[1:19:07] for someone who has a true relationship
[1:19:10] with God
[1:19:13] do you think they're looking for someone
[1:19:15] that I can tell that man has been in
[1:19:18] prayer
[1:19:19] I can tell
[1:19:21] that he's been with Jesus
[1:19:23] that is the one I want to pray for me
[1:19:27] when they walk into this congregation
[1:19:29] and they come amongst these people
[1:19:32] they and they look at all of us
[1:19:36] and they say I want to be like them
[1:19:39] they have a relationship with Christ
[1:19:41] that I don't have
[1:19:43] that's the way I want to be I want to be
[1:19:46] part of them
[1:19:47] because they know God and I want to know
[1:19:50] God
[1:19:51] is that what people want to want when
[1:19:54] they come in
[1:19:55] that's what we have to offer that's what
[1:19:58] we need to offer that's what we have to
[1:20:01] get to the point that we have that to
[1:20:03] offer you're sick come here on anoint
[1:20:06] you with oil and you'll be healed
[1:20:08] because it says it here in the word
[1:20:10] you know you have problems with your
[1:20:12] family or whatever we'll pray we'll pray
[1:20:14] without ceasing
[1:20:16] and they'll be fine
[1:20:18] because we bring it before the Lord I
[1:20:21] mentioned one time this uh
[1:20:23] Zachariah
[1:20:25] was his name John the Baptist's Daddy
[1:20:28] the angel
[1:20:31] Gabriel
[1:20:33] comes to Zachariah
[1:20:37] and he says this
[1:20:39] this is before John the Baptist was born
[1:20:41] he's going to make him a promise that
[1:20:42] he's going to have a son
[1:20:44] he says Zechariah he says God has heard
[1:20:48] your prayer
[1:20:50] you're going to have a son
[1:20:53] Zachariah says how can this be
[1:20:57] I'm old
[1:20:58] my wife is old we can't have children
[1:21:00] that time's passed a long time ago
[1:21:04] it doesn't make sense does it
[1:21:06] why would Zechariah have prayed
[1:21:09] we know he prayed because the angel said
[1:21:11] he prayed God heard your prayers
[1:21:13] Zachariah
[1:21:16] and he says well I'm too old
[1:21:18] wait a minute
[1:21:21] and he says you know what he says you're
[1:21:24] not going to be able to speak
[1:21:26] he says until you have that baby
[1:21:28] call him John
[1:21:32] very odd thing that happened you know
[1:21:33] why it happened
[1:21:35] because God heard zechariah's prayer and
[1:21:38] he may have been a young man
[1:21:41] it may have been 50 years ago
[1:21:43] that he prayed that
[1:21:45] so when you pray something for your
[1:21:47] family or you ask the Lord something
[1:21:50] you place it there and then you have
[1:21:54] faith that he is able when you are
[1:21:56] praying when you're asking the Lord and
[1:21:58] you feel that spirit and that is the
[1:22:01] holy spirit speaking you leave it there
[1:22:04] and you know it's going to happen and it
[1:22:07] happened to Zechariah the minister of
[1:22:09] the gospel and he didn't he couldn't
[1:22:12] believe it just like they couldn't
[1:22:13] believe it when Peter knocked at the
[1:22:15] door yet they had been praying for the
[1:22:17] same thing
[1:22:18] Zechariah and his wife had prayed for
[1:22:21] this God answered their prayer
[1:22:23] don't get ever no don't get discouraged
[1:22:26] if you prayed for something and it
[1:22:29] doesn't happen right away
[1:22:32] if you had the right Spirit God heard
[1:22:35] your prayers
[1:22:37] he knows
[1:22:39] I was praying
[1:22:40] about this church
[1:22:43] a couple months ago I said Lord I I
[1:22:45] don't know
[1:22:47] do you want me
[1:22:49] to to be the pastor do you want me to to
[1:22:51] help in some way Lord what do you want
[1:22:54] and I kept asking him and asking Lord I
[1:22:56] don't know I don't know and he answered
[1:22:58] me you know what he said
[1:23:00] he said I heard you
[1:23:03] that was good enough for me
[1:23:05] that was good enough for me he didn't
[1:23:07] tell me what was going to happen he
[1:23:09] doesn't have to tell me what was going
[1:23:11] to happen he said I heard you
[1:23:13] Lord
[1:23:15] you know about it I God by the wow God
[1:23:18] is face and he looked down at me I heard
[1:23:21] you son
[1:23:22] I know and his will
[1:23:25] would be done
[1:23:27] sisters if you come brother Matt
[1:23:33] put Matthew chapter 6 up
[1:23:36] oh no brother
[1:23:42] here
[1:23:44] Lord
[1:23:46] and I've said this many times
[1:23:49] Lord I don't know how to pray
[1:23:53] I hear about all these these these great
[1:23:56] Miracles I hear about maybe sister
[1:23:58] Jarvis

[1:24:02] these different ones how the Lord
[1:24:04] answered their prayer but how Lord how
[1:24:06] do I do it
[1:24:09] same question was on the disciples
[1:24:11] hearts

[1:24:17] and he said
[1:24:19] he said I'll teach you how to pray they
[1:24:22] asked him teach me how to pray he said
[1:24:23] I'll teach you how to pray
[1:24:26] he said
[1:24:28] pray like this
