rather he gives of himself and it's just wonderful to know a living God so I do have some requests some to bring to your attention and some announcements before brother Dan comes up to minister this this morning but brother Merle Baggett is going to be going into surgery next week for for some work on his knees so let's remember him on that and I appreciate the doctors can do what they can do and but all healing is of God so and then I had heard that brother Dale Smith the brother pastors the church up in Flagstaff was to have heart surgery so I called him this morning and on December 8th brother Dale is going to have open heart surgery [Music] um they had had some some physical problems and when he went in for a thing they found an aneurysm and they found blockages and the doctor told him if they didn't do something soon he may not be around much longer so he he sounded good on the phone didn't sound depressed or anything like that but he said he would appreciate it prayers for our brother Dale Smith so and then our our brother brother Dan asked me he said if we would remember a sister Gina who is in a very dark place and I shared a testimony we heard yesterday with brother Dan and he had heard it also I believe it was a pastor's daughter yesterday when we were up at the ministers meeting and his daughter had gotten into a very dark place and she said I'm going away I'm leaving all of this I'm just gonna go away and he said I put myself into prayer and she came back one day not too long and says Daddy no I'm not going I'm gonna stay here and I'm gonna let God bring me through this so we have a god that is more than able to do those things and brother Dan also mentioned it had a a praise for our sister Olivia a seven-year-old with a with a kidney promise and he had asked prayer for them and she's doing much better so I know a god that is able do you know that God Amen let's stand you have a need [Music] you know I I've lifted up my hands a hundred times Lord but you're still the same yesterday today and for Lord we thank you that that we have a living God not a far away up there uh that we have to get permission make appointments to go in and see you like a a doctor what we would do today Lord but you said come unto me and I will give you rest Lord and in every part of that rest Lord there's healing there's peace there's joy that is everything that we have need of Lord this this this sister in a dark place Lord oh how Satan would get in and make a mess out of someone's life Lord try to turn off all the light and make it in a place that would just be so horrible Lord but you can be touched by the feelings of her infirmities the things she's going through Lord and I know you can do this Lord because I've heard testimony of those who said there's there's a flicker of Hope suddenly and it begins to grow Lord for this this sister Lord would would that just happen today Lord each hand raised each heart represented here Lord meet that need today Lord may they believe and take you at your word we thank you for that Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated good to have you all here this morning and we have some visiting folks and you're always welcome and the Home Folks you're welcome to so amen that we myself and brother Lyle went to the ministers meeting up in up in Phoenix yesterday and brother Steve Robson had asked me to be one of the speakers [Music] and he said you're the senior brother so you get to speak first the first time I've been called a senior show but it was good to to minister with a Brethren there and have a good time and then they broke there's a break for for lunch and the the young people that were here a few weeks back with brother rivet on a Sunday it's his church and each one of them was wearing a vest outside to park all the cars because it was a small parking lot and then each one of them became servers and helpers and they each one had a table what would you like to have steak or salmon or there was another plate everything prepared I said brother this is going to be hard to beat for the next meeting but we were treated so kindly by the folks and it was so nice but but to hear the minister speaking also in in the topic was complexes and I told Brother Steve I got a complex thinking about I was going to minister on complexes we all have complexes we all have issues in life but to know that your brother is going through the same thing and God has helped him through it and he then encourages you and it's a good thing it's a wonderful thing so appreciate that brother Steve good to see you I had seen you at the restaurant the other day and you were doing well and then they said you had gotten sick good to see you brother Steve was it is was one of the best cabinet installers we worked for years together and Davis he had the unfortunate circumstance circumstance I've had to work under me for several years but uh a good brother a good brother show some announcements for things that are coming up in the next couple months this Wednesday night service is canceled for Thanksgiving as we have done over the years I know folks will be traveling and family have a good time together enjoy it if you don't have a place to go uh invite one another I know we did it one time we ended up with about 60 people in the house and that was quite all right but we were ready for it and it's good don't don't be alone you know have a place to go so and then right now we're planning on having brother Robert chacon's memorial service the Second Sunday of December have the morning service here and then the and the afternoon have the memorial service we're making plans um for that and we we do have some more information now and and putting things together so let's plan on that and then December 15th through 18th which is a Wednesday a Thursday I'm sorry through Sunday brother Joe Adams and brother Aaron Oglesby so we'll have Thursday night Friday or evening Thursday evening Friday evening Saturday evening and Sunday morning and then we'll have a fellowship meal after and that's the plans for those services and then Harmony in the desert um in January 11th Wednesday the 11th through Sunday the 15th has been scheduled here at the Tabernacle like they did last year so just looking forward to some of those things just announcements this is the time of the year that the folks come to Arizona because it's a lot more pleasant than other places and then in May through September October they go away so and I don't blame them sometimes but we serve a living God amen every need is supplied not a thing missed but he times it at the right time we just they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength so if you'll stand with me see we'll we'll pull and we'll we'll draw on that which Lord has placed on brother Dan's heart and how many would do that with a left lifted hand say yes I'll do that and you know it helps the minister a lot when the reactions of the people is there's amens they're they're smiles there's there's acknowledgment it helps the minister when the people sit stone-faced the minister begins to think it's his problem you know and it might be not saying that I haven't caused that at times but it sure is nice to to to see the people receiving and you say you have a need you say Lord minister to me and God will do that amen Amazing Grace how sweet to sound that saved a Wretch like Me [Music] Amazing Grace how sweet oh it says rich like me I once was lost I was blind but now I see let's praise him praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God amen greetings to every one of you in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I love to see the church pray we bring the prayer request before the church there is a story in the book of Acts where Peter was in prison and the church prayed without ceasing for our brother and then one night the church was all together they're all worried about things and Peter is released from prison a angel came and brought him out and brought him to the door and he knocked on the door and this little sister opened the door and then she she slammed it because she didn't expect that to be Peter she said it must be his ghost or something she didn't expect the prayer to be answered but when we pray we expect our prayers to be answered amen I want to keep you standing for just a second let's turn to James chapter 4. thank you sisters it reads like this James chapter 4 verse 14 it says this whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow for what is your life it is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanisheth away let's bow our heads Lord once again we pray to you and father asked that you would add the blessings to this scripture and Lord that you would be welcome in this congregation this morning in Jesus name amen you can take your seats I read the scripture um I ministered about a week and a half ago and I I ministered on on the scripture I didn't have a chance to finish my sermon and I I preached on Absalom which is I want to talk a little bit about Absalom this morning and then I went on and then on Wednesday night the time started ticking and I ran out of time so I stopped my sermon see when I preach friends it is the message of the hour it's not the message of the two hours or the three hours I try to keep it within an hour because I want you to enjoy it and I want you to remember what I say this um this scripture in James he's writing whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow for what is your life it is even but a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away and I I've been praying on that scripture for weeks now and um when I was living back in Indiana often in the morning there would be a fog as just as the Sun would rise there would be a fog that would lay down in the low areas and then as the sun would come up the fog would just quickly disappear and it's strange you look at it it's just here and then it's gone and then there's no trace of it whatsoever and I think about us and I think about our lives and I think about how many of us raise your hand how many of us know or new are great grandparents say half of the congregation then how many of us know or knew about our great great grandparents Steve and Sister Sarah brother Aaron maybe a few more very few that's just a couple Generations and our lives are completely gone we don't even have a memory of ourselves some of some of the families really make a mark on History we see this book right here is is full of of those people but there are very few people outside of this book I see brother Steve there brother Steve's last name is Hickerson and I was I was um um I see this guy out outside he was doing some Plumbing work and and uh I went out and and talked to him and just briefly didn't know who he was and then I came back and my wife called her somebody and I said I said no I'm I'm witnessing to the plumber and they just Plummer out there and then it ends up when I finally meet him this plumber ends up witnessing to me brother Steve his dad is brother Holland Hickerson many of you know brother Hickerson AKA hick he uh he was a deacon at the Branham Tabernacle for many years and Deacon in the 60s moved out here he was best friends with my grandfather brother wheeler who was also a deacon let me tell a little story about brother hick and brother wheeler so there was there's this famous uh series of sermons preached in the 60s that brother Brandon preached um where he preached marriage and divorce and who is this Melchizedek and and a couple other sermons and they had they had meetings in this Middle School Parkview I think is the name of the middle school is that right Parkview Middle School it is out of middle school so everybody there's thousands of people lined up outside to get in the doors so the deacons but the hick and and brother wheeler and the other ones they have the doors closed and everybody's lined up and finally it's time to let the people in they open the door and it was like a flood of people coming in and it was brother Jerry it was like ASU Arizona basketball game man there was elbows being thrown and and pushing and and going in and they'll get their seats they all want to be in the front row to to hear what's what's on the prophet's mind and they're all excited and it wasn't they weren't acting like Christians so my grandpa brother hick they rounded all the people back up and said get out and come in like a Christian so so they brought everybody out then they brought them in and have had them act like Christians so I I appreciate those those old stories you know I'm sure brother Steve you could just go on and on and on telling the stories about about the old times but now we live in these times and uh I think about all of our families and I think about just a couple generations and we have no idea where we came from you know we can do some genealogy stuff I guess and say oh I was related to this person or that person this famous person that may have made a mark on history but what mark when we leave this world in this short little time that we have what Mark will we leave and um like I said I I preached on this a couple weeks ago on a Wednesday night and I'd like to start there and that's about this man named Absalom now Absalom was the third son of King David Absalom was he was a fine looking young man very charismatic had a whole lot going for him in life so Absalom what had happened was Absalom had a sister and uh now David obviously had a lot of wives so they all had the same father but they they had different mothers so Absalom had a sister and um one of absalom's Brothers committed um a trespass against absalom's sister really bad um it upset Absalom so after um and Absalom never forgot about it after a couple years Absalom took the law into his old hand in his own hands and he ordered his servants to kill his brother and it of course really hurt David the father so it ends up Absalom is told to leave the kingdom and after a while David's loyal servant General named joab he sees that David would really like to have his son back so AB so um joab makes a way for this Absalom to come back and be reunited in in the area there of the city of David so he comes back and then Absalom who is a very ambitious young man and is all about himself Absalom was a man that was full of himself and that's the title of my sermon today is it's not about you so Absalom he starts he has he develops this plan in his mind and he starts waiting at the gates of the city for when the people come in to see the king and obviously the king doesn't have time to visit all these people so Absalom says hey let me judge this and everybody knew Absalom he was the son of David so he had respect among the people so he started winning the respect among the people and Absalom started using this for his own selfish ambitions now as I said before Absalom ended up being just a spoiled brat and no more so he's starting to get the support of the people so finally Absalom sees that he has an opportunity to take the throne now Absalom like I said he was a very charismatic very capable young man he may have ascended to the throne anyways but he ends up he's going to take it so David sees that more people are with Absalom than with him so David everyone is weeping and it was just an awful time in Jerusalem so David takes his men and he leaves the city one thing that David did that I thought was just just precious is there's a a priest named zadok zadok obviously was a wise man a very very good man he has all the Levites get together they pick up the Ark of the Covenant and they start walking out the city out of the city with David and David stops them and says no he says leave the ark here here this is where the ark should be look at the humility in David he says is God's with me he says then I'll be back he said but this Ark needs to stay here remember that Arc wherever that Ark went that battle was won it went before the people and David in his humility and in the sweetness of the spirit of Jesus Christ said no leave it here in the city if it's meant to be it's meant to be I'll be back if the Lord wants but he didn't know so David ends up going out Absalom takes control of the city there ends up being a war between David and Absalom and David being the great leader that he was wins this war and it ended up with 20 000 people dying an awful awful thing because this young man Absalom rose up and came against the rightful King and just brought destruction I don't even know if I can't really even tell these 20 000 people that died which side they were on but they died Jews anoint uh chosen people they died because of this man Absalom and then but before Absalom died let me read this let me read this scripture um before Absalom died in second Samuel Verse 18 I'm sorry chapter 18 verse 18. it says this now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar which is in the Kingsdale for he said I have no son to keep my name in remembrance and he called the pillar after his own name and it is called unto this day absalom's place now brother uh who is that back there brother Peter and Brother Joseph if you could put up that picture I showed this the other day there's a place in Jerusalem called absalom's Place absalom's pillar absalom's tomb and that's what you see up on the screen now if you do the research that when they first found it they thought that this must be absalom's tomb it's actually probably not it was probably built many years later but it represents this pillar that this man Absalom reared up for himself so that he would I have a legacy and it's the most disrespected place that I found when I was in Israel I went there and I I saw I saw this beautiful Monument which is just outside of the gates in the in the Kidron Valley and and I saw this beautiful place I wanted to go see what it was so I go down there and there's trash around it smelled bad it was a place of disrespect the only place that I saw actually in the whole time I was in Israel and I thought what is this and then I look at the sign and it says absalom's tomb so I did some research about it and Through the Years mothers and fathers would bring their children to this place and they would throw rocks at the monument and the mothers and the fathers would say this is what happens to a disobedient son and tell them the story of Absalom it is a place of disrespect and it is a monument to this man and what he did thank you Brothers so look at the difference between this man absolute and his father David in all the mistakes that he made in life and there were many yet God said he's a man after my own heart and every king after him was judged according to the standard that David set has had a wonderful wonderful Legacy in this this man David I do want to read in second Samuel chapter 18 verse 33 when this young man Absalom when they went to war and uh you know the story had a bunch of hair and he got it caught up in the in the oak tree and he was hanging there and joab comes and kills him they bring news back to David and David's first question is what happened to Absalom this is the man that took his kingdom with hatred took his kingdom disgraced David disgrace the city yet David was worried about this this young man Absalom and he says this and the King was much moved he got 1833. the King was much moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept and as he went thus he said my son o my son my my son Absalom would God that I had died for thee Absalom my son who does that sound like does that not sound like the Lord Jesus himself do you see the Holy Spirit there in this man David that this man sinned against him and yet he said I would have died in your Stead and look what Jesus did for each of us and how important it is to have that same spirit and look at the Legacy between the two men one is a legacy of Shame and reproach and the other is a legacy that God says a man after mine own heart David and I look at David and I see how it didn't matter all the mistakes that he made and there were many of them but David had in his heart to be right and he wanted to be right he had humility with David it wasn't so much about David as it was about the Lord with Absalom it was all about me and all about about what I can do and what I can accomplish there's a famous author named C.S Lewis he uh he said this in one of his books he said humility is not thinking less of yourself but it is thinking of yourself less humility is not thinking less of yourself but is thinking about yourself less and be good for us to have a little bit more of that in today's society today's society it's instead of it's it's giving me this I'm entitled to this I should be this this this is mine instead of that we should ask the Lord Lord help me use what I have to bless others not for myself an Absalom would have used his talents for King David he could have helped he could have done maybe great things and Jesus himself he says this he says who whoever wants to be my disciple they must deny themselves follow me and then so often friends and and I uh you know I look at myself here standing in the Pulpit it's so often that this Pulpit fails that I've seen I've heard so many pastors trying to beat the people over the head saying come to church you got to come to church you got to come to church you know there's you got to be in church and you should be in you should be in church and you're a sinner if you don't go to church I understand that and the pastors are saying that so we'll come in and they can do they can make an impact in our lives but I say sometimes brother why are they not coming to church thank you is it always their fault or is it this fault right here at the pulpit why don't they want to come let me tell you brother brother Steve is when uh brother hick and and brother wheeler and and all of these these things were happening in the 1960s brother Branham didn't have to tell people to come to church he didn't have to try to pull on him they were lined up at the door trying to get in because they were expecting something to happen because things were happening they were expecting things to to take place and now we see not not just this church we see churches around the country any Christian church we see the Pew is just emptying why is that there should be more coming from this part of the church there should be more Revelation coming there should be more miracles coming there should be more leadership coming so that the people want to come in but instead we beat him over the head you're wrong you should be in church we should be in church of course we should but we should want to come to church and that's the leadership from the pulpit is being able to move with God and say why do people not want to come Hebrews chapter 10. verse 22. says this let us draw near with a true heart and full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled from all evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast to the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works provoke it means to encourage or the spur others under good works get them excited get them get this get the Lord make the Lord welcome so things happen so they want to come this Pulpit should provoke you to be here not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching again it's not always the congregation many times it's a weak pulpit and I see I'll just say it I see I hear I hear often we got to put brother Branham back in the pulpit and I know what that means I know it means to play tapes in the church and that's good and I think that's that's good we should play the tapes in the church but it doesn't make sense it's it's that's not that's not successful what we should do is put Jesus Christ in this Pulpit that is why brother Branham was so successful he put Jesus in this pulpit and Jesus was able to work through him and look at all that happened back then that's what should happen today is put Christ in this Pulpit let this guy get out of the way and let it come forward whether it's playing a tape in church 100 agree with that or whether it's ministering however the spirit is leading but let Christ be here put Christ back in the pulpit I was uh I was brother brother hick the wheeler my grandpa my mom and my dad were in the Branham Tabernacle I'm sure you're too young but the um brother Branham was preaching the sermon on the church ages and my mom I think it was my mom that was closest there on the wall was a supernatural light it came in it's it stayed on the wall you can listen the people start shouting and rejoicing and they're scared and and Mom said she looked at it and it would move and it would change there was the light from God on that wall not able to to to um mimic it it was real and there they are watching that light move in and out and the whole church was seeing it my mom was sitting right there my dad was sitting a little further away everyone was watching it it was real why would you not want to come to church if that's happening Sister Barbara why would you not want to be here I was in church a few years ago at the Bram Tabernacle and and we were at um we're at the the youth center because there's there was too many people there was a lot of excitement about getting back to church that there was there was a lot of excitement about what God was going to do I was sitting Stephanie and Daniel and I were we were sitting in the pews and they started taking up the offering and I saw a little commotion over to my left maybe about here to meet a brother Aaron no farther than that about that about that distance and I see my brother Adam who's a paramedic and I see Dr Matt golden who is a um he's a trauma surgeon doctor I see my brother get up and brother Matt every time he sees my brother get up he knows that he needs to get up they go over and I look and there is a man named James Jackson who I've known my whole life and old man and he was dead as a hammer he was out his eyes were open his his he was slumped down in his chair his face was a color that I can't even describe gray he was dead and you know what he had been dead for almost an hour so they're over there they're my my brother opens up his shirt puts his hands on his chest Dr Golden Gets behind him standing behind the chair has has his hands underneath his his um jaw right here trying to find a pulse they weren't working on him no CPR my brother told me he said God told him as he had his hands on this man God told him make sure he is dead because this is going to be a testimony Dr Golden was standing behind him I was looking down the aisle here watching and they they were just standing there basically Brother Joseph Branham was in the Pulpit he comes down comes around the aisle kneels down my brother had his hands on brother James and brother James's chest Brother Joseph slides his hands under there and let me tell you something there was a spirit in that Congregation of God is going to do something I can only speak for myself but I knew that that man was going to rise from the dead I knew it I can only speak for myself but I got to tell you I probably there was a thousand other people feeling thinking the same thing Adam was standing Adam was kneeling down he had his hands there we were praying all of a sudden chest moves up starts moving Adam tells Dr Golden he says I have respiration Dr Golden he had his hands right here on his on his carotid or his artery right here and he felt boom he says I have a pulse the man came back to life and I would venture to say I doubt there was ever a more documented case of a resurrection a man being dead and raising than this one having a doctor and a paramedic they're witnessing this they took him to the hospital the only difference that this this man had was his temperature was four degrees low the doctors were talking of talking about it and brother Matt's like well that probably means he was dead for about an hour before he came back I saw that that is what should be present in our churches it was common in the book of Acts it happened a lot I know there was a lot of times that that aren't recorded in here that they they probably sat through the service and maybe nodded off to sleep or whatever well we know one nodded off to sleep this guy named Utica because he was sitting up in the rafters yeah I'm glad that that's in there and the guy the kid fell down don't fall asleep the kid fell down dead Paul goes over and raises him back up that is what these things should produce but friends they will not produce that I look at what happened there at the Tabernacle things were going really good people were excited to be there there was hundreds of people lined up to get in and then it just died now they don't even go to church in years I don't even they don't even go because it stopped being about the Lord and about the people and it gravitated to be about the narrative and about the denomination and about the way of thinking and that's when it kills it every single time it kills it and we look at this man Absalom it was about him and yeah it was going really good at for a while but it ended in disgrace and I'm not saying that that's ended in disgrace by any means um I believe the Lord's gonna do things but with Absalom it ended in disgrace and look at the Legacy that he left and now we see our failures as people are almost always because we make the same mistake that Absalom did and we make it about us we make it about this guy right here rather than about the Lord and it's prophesied that it would come in this day second Timothy chapter 3. I have in my Bible right here written this modern day because that's what the prophet said that we are living in this day this scripture that I'm about to read this note also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves coveters boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy and it's normal in today's society how many followers can I get how many likes can I get on my videos how many friends can I have in Facebook and I'm not saying friends I'm not saying those things are wrong I'm not don't get me wrong I'm not saying that's wrong I believe that social media can be used for the Lord I have no doubt that it can be used from the Lord for the Lord but don't deny don't look over where we are right now you know I've said many times put yourself in this Bible Jump Right In and then look around we are it says here it says lovers of their own selves look around what's going on wow you know there's there's a story I've never done this and I don't plan on doing it by the way but if you put a frog in a pot of water of room temperature and you turn up the heat pretty slow and it starts to get hotter and hotter and higher he doesn't even know that it's getting hot in there and pretty soon the poor little guys boiled like I said don't do it it doesn't matter if it happens or not it's just the moral of the story you know it's a parable look what's happened around with us these things have come to pass and it's slowly working in and we're just sitting there and the pot's getting hot and it's starting to boil lovers of their own selves promoting their own selves verse number three without natural affections I hope you know what that is perversion pornography it's almost sexuality it's these strange lusts that have snuck in and always been condemned in times past but today in this recent hour all of a sudden it's okay in fact it's encouraged it's never been that way the water's getting hot and the Frog's starting to boil and he doesn't even know it truce Breakers false accusers look at the gossip that goes on all the time the Democrats are calling the Republicans Nazis and racists you know and the Republicans are calling the Democrats fascist and they compare them to all sorts of evil people saying oh this man's like Hitler and all this these are some of the evilest people that have ever been on the earth and yet we're throwing out these insults like they're nothing you think that's always gone on I don't think so I think that's in this day and then we as you were preaching the other night I heard what you said you made a couple statements that you just kind of slipped them in and uh I really appreciated that we have to be careful about separating ourselves we have to be careful about saying we're better than someone else just because we have maybe a little bit more light or maybe that just because we can put ourselves in the Bible and say I would have been one of those that followed John the Baptist and I am this guy Daniel Evans I am I can place myself in this Bible and say I would have followed John the Baptist and I would have done what he said when he said follow Christ but don't forget there was a Matthew there's a Mary magdorn there were others that may not have had the same light but they still came to Christ foreign fierce and despisers of those that are good and how careful we should be that we are not cutting out people just because they don't believe like we do it could be somebody that that you say oh well they don't they just don't have the light they're the foolish virgin or they're not the elect and this person may be spending hours in prayer speaking to God studying this word and praying for you and yeah we might say eh they're not good enough careful this scripture as I said it is for today traitors Hedy high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God snuck up on us the past 60 to 70 years all this entertainment and stuff and like I said friends I'm not legalistic I'm not against these things but I just want to show where we're at when Stephanie and I got married tomorrow's anniversary don't forget didn't want to forget that one um when we got married I was being 24 oh it's 24 years yeah tomorrow honey don't forget make me feel bad if you forget um we didn't have cell phones that's 24 years ago let alone smartphones and today it comes right in and now we have YouTube and Netflix and and all of these different things Lover's a pleasure more than lovers of God let me ask you let me ask each one of you you don't have to raise your hand how much time do you spend on these other things and then how much time do you spend on things of God think about it each one of us YouTube and Netflix and anything else like I said I'm not trying to I'm not a legalistic person I think legalism is a failure because there's always a loophole but how much over time are we spending on these things and we know that this is the end all of these things are starting to happen and yet yeah you know I'll do it tomorrow you know I'll waste I'll waste a little bit more time I was I wasn't going to talk about this but I was driving with Daniel or Stephanie one of them and we're driving and we're going along I was by myself and we're going along and this guy is is just in front of me and he's got his blinker on to uh to change lanes so I'm going along and I'm a very courteous driver you know um that's the ninth commandment I am a courteous driver so I back off a little bit and you know come on blinker blinker blinker so I back off a little bit more I'm like come on man get in there you can come over blinker blinker blinker I'm starting to get fired up here get in there blinker blank forget it boom I go on I go on right ahead and that is the case with so many of us today I'm gonna do it blinker blinker I'm gonna do it I'm gonna start spending more time with the Lord blinker blinker no now turn don't even turn on the blinker just go turn move I didn't I wasn't planning on saying that um but it's true um Traders heady High minded love is a pleasure more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away for of this sort are they which creep into houses and leave cap lead captives silly women Laden was sinned LED away with divers lusts ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth merrily asked me the other night we were talking and she she said what does that mean what's that scripture ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth and it's they don't have a sincere heart they're reading these scriptures learning them they're listening to these sermons and they're listening for just what they want to hear they're reading for just what they want to further their narrative to make them feel better about themselves but never able to come to the knowledge of what God is trying to tell us in this last day I uh message of the hour have to be careful um let's turn to Galatians chapter six verse 1. in talking about it's not all about us and talking about the seeds that we plant here the Apostle Paul in writing this letter to the Galatians in chapter 6 he says this Brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such a one to the spirit of in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted I love that I love that scripture oh man that just felt so good if a man be overtaken in a fault you words are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness if this man or this woman say I made a mistake I did something wrong bring them back in never never put them out now there may be things arise in the church of bad spirits then you say there's the door but in meekness this person comes back I don't care what they've done bring them back into the fold and it says here Paul says consider yourself consider what you have done to Christ everyone in this room has sinned against the Lord Jesus every single one of us has fallen consider what I have done to you Lord what have I done to you and when I start thinking about that nobody's ever done anything to me you know we get mad at somebody oh this person said this about me or you know this you know it wasn't me money or whatever what have I done to God it just kind of wipes it all the way right there bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ for if a man think of himself to be something when he is nothing he deceives himself how many I could go how many times do you see somebody trying to be something they're not and not it never the Lord never blesses it you know you see people trying to to go into business or preach preach the gospel or or do whatever they're trying to do they do it for the wrong motives and then you see God doesn't bless it it doesn't grow it doesn't we don't see the the Sinners coming to the Lord you know in in business you see it keep failing and failing and failing and ending bad they're trying to be something that they're not where was I 3. um let's skip down to seven be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever man soweth that shall he reap also the Amplified Bible says this God will not allow himself to be ridiculed he will not allow his precepts to be scornfully set aside I say God backs up his word it says here for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he reap no if you don't know what the Apostle is talking about there he's talking about if you plant a tomato plant and it grows and then it Bears Tomatoes you plant a grapefruit tree you plant the little seedlings in a few years you're able to reap the Bounty from this grapefruit tree you're able to you're able to go out and pick it and you know you planted it you you watered it you fertilized it and after a little while you can pick the fruit off of it and enjoy it and that's the same thing with us we plant these seeds and then later they flourish and the Lord adds the increase but let me tell you we can also plant the negative seeds we can see how how a negative seed can be planted and then it grows it could be gossip saying something about somebody I'll give my own testimony when I was a kid I don't know I was 13 14 years old I used to watch the Chicago Cubs play on on TV is when I get home from school they were playing I just I love baseball and uh between Innings there was a song that would play it's kind of a catchy tune so my friend had that cassette tape so my friend loans me that tape and I started listening to that song on there and then I started listening to the other songs Van Halen brother Steve you wouldn't know that is right I'm just kidding I don't know I think started listening to it and it took root inside of me as a Young Man and it started to grow this listening to this music music is meant for worship so as I'm listening to this music then you know it becomes worship and that was the door for me as a young man that was the door for sin to enter into my life and then other things followed after that when as I got older it was if things started getting it turned into other other sins that that I would do you know maybe one of them was was my mouth and and not speaking appropriately you know cussing and there's and it leads to many other things but it started right here that I invited I planted the seed and it grew then I gave my heart to the Lord on my 21st birthday got rid of all of it ah praise the Lord is right it feels really good that that it's been that long I was thinking about music and how important it is and like I said it's worship be careful what you're listening to I was a few years ago I was um downstairs and you know we all go through things up and up and down and uh I was down and I I started I got on the uh down in the basement of my house I got on the uh the um stationary bike and I'm exercising and I'm just kind of praying to the Lord and I I get my iPad and I turn on YouTube and I searched I think Christian music and I found this song and it was a song there was this man that he went into this prison and he had a concert and the name of the song the song as I was listening the man saying these words he says I'm no longer a Slave To Fear I am a child of God he says you unravel me with a Melody you surround me with a song of deliverance from my enemies and until all my fears are gone gone I am a child of God and I I put my hands up and I just was praising the Lord and I looked at on the on the video and there's all these these prisoners and their hands are up and tears are coming down their face and I see what seeds were planted in these prisoners that put them there in that prison and I see this man God bless him come in there and sing songs of worship to plant good seed in these men verse 9 it says this and let us not be weary and well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not if we keep going and we keep trying as we have therefore opportunity let us do unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith that's a nice little thing to put in there especially now do good don't stop doing good to everybody but especially those that believe Christ charity starts here don't neglect one another in this room you know so often I've seen people get upset and they're the nicest people out to others at Walmart or Costco or wherever they go but then man they run each other down inside of church don't do that says right here start right here this love that we have one for another that this should be first priority um I'm gonna I'm gonna skip I want to go down to um let's go down to Second Peter chapter three but beloved verse 8. but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years is one day the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but his long-suffering to us word he knows when to answer our prayers not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance you know we all we pray we pray for our families we pray for ourselves we pray for our sickness and we wonder Lord why has this not happened yet it's not about you God knows God knows the begin from the beginning from the ending and these sicknesses that we have maybe it's our children that are Wayward maybe whatever it is it's not about you he is accomplishing something he's accomplishing a goal and we should have faith in him faith in when he is going to answer we know he's going to answer because he promised but wait on him because we don't know when these things are going to happen you know sometimes we make mistakes has anybody made a mistake good Daniel raised his hand I can testify um we make mistakes friends we do and every single one of us and sometimes we look back and we say Lord why did I make that mistake why Lord I messed up so bad why did you let me make this mistake and Lord I'm so sorry I I did this and I shouldn't have done it I committed this sin or I made this transgression I did all of this Lord and you feel so bad but remember it's not about you sometimes he allows us to make mistakes just as he did with David just as he did with many others sometimes he allows us to make mistakes because it's going to accomplish his perfect will if you've made a mistake and you can't put it under the blood you're not even a Christian I don't mean to condemn anyone but that's kind of the whole book we put it under the blood and let it go and we thank God and sometimes he lets us make these mistakes he allows it whether it be David we know the story of Nellie Sanders who who she lived in sin she lived a rough life she gave her heart to the Lord Jesus she was a dancer she liked to go to the clubs so she's she she changed she's walking by and she hears the music oh and then she goes up to the step and then she goes inside and pretty soon she's in a boy's arms and completely fell then a little while later we know that it turns out to be a supernatural thing she comes and a demon was cast out of her a little bit later do you think maybe God allowed Nellie Sanders to make that mistake so we could tell this story it's a sure is a blessing to me and how many times I've messed up but he allowed her to make this mistake so remember keep planting the seeds and the mistakes that all of us have made don't worry about them they could very well be for the glory of God God knew every mistake that we're gonna make we didn't surprise him but he allowed it and if we do right he allowed it for his glory I am once again I'm gonna have to cut cut it short sisters if you could come and brother Matt I want to close with the story about a man who made a very serious mistake and this mistake that he made it was because it was about himself and this is an Absalom this is another man his name is Peter famous we all know Peter was with the Lord for three and a half years he knew the ups and downs he had seen Jesus cast out Devils he saw Jesus heal the sick he saw people come give their hearts to the Lord he knew this man was the Messiah that was promised to come Peter was there man he was there from the beginning Peter knew what Jesus said and then when things got a little rough Peter himself started thinking about this guy he was worried about his own skin let me read a scripture to You Luke 22 31. this is at the end of the story of the Gospels it's a hard time Jesus says this he said Simon behold Satan has desire to have you that he may sift you as wheat I have to admit I don't know what that means but if it's Satan it's not good but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brother now listen to this and he said unto him Lord I am ready to go with thee both into prison and to death and he said I tell thee Peter the shall not Crow this day before thou hast Thou shalt Thrice deny me that deny that thou even knowest me this man that had been with Jesus he said the rooster ain't gonna Crow until you've denied me three times just in this very day there's like no way I could never do that the same story is told in Matthew 26 verse 31 he says this Jesus said unto them all you shall be offended because of me in this night for it is written I will Smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad but after I am risen again I will go before you into Galilee Peter answered and said unto him though all men shall be offended because of thee yet I will never be offended and again Jesus tells him this day you're going to deny me three times so Jesus comes before Pilate beaten and here is this man that had been with him all of these days he says he was scared he was thinking about himself he says I don't even know you I don't even know Jesus imagine that there's a scripture I guarantee you Peter knew what Jesus has said let me see if I can find it yeah Matthew chapter 10. verse 32 and 33. Jesus says this he says whosoever shall confess me before men him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven but so whosoever shall deny me before men him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven and Peter denied him not once but three times he sees this man beaten down and they say oh you look like one of the ones that was with him I wasn't with him I don't even know him then again happens again I didn't know him I don't even know him and then what does Peter do he cussed he swore said cuss words young people look how Peter tried to separate himself from Jesus Christ there is no way someone that swears and has a dirty mouth could be associated with Christ scary Peter himself three times denies the Lord Jesus goes to the cross and it says after the third time he heard the rooster crow and he just fell down said Lord I'm so sorry and he just wept there is Peter broken and and and comes comes down and doesn't know what to do no matter what sin that you have committed no matter what you have done Peter did about as bad as you can compare Peter and Judas one man's heart was right and the other one wasn't wasn't but they both did a similar thing Peter repented he his heart was right so whatever sin we have committed no matter what it is the whole reason that we're here in church today the whole reason that we pray is because we know that that grace is sufficient never never make the mistake of saying Lord I've done this I've sinned all this oh I have all of this in my past so I really can't do anything for you no Peter did about the worst that you can do and then God chose him to preach the very first sermon after the Holy Spirit had fell said some said great things like they asked Peter they said how do we receive this Holy Ghost and he says repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus for the remission of your sins and you shall receive this gift of the Holy Ghost for this promise is unto you and to them that are far off us even as many as the Lord our gods are called the Lord chose this man to preach that message that had just denied him I thank God for the Amos I thank God that my sins are under this blood and I want to sow those seeds those good seeds of the Gospel and I don't want to make it about me about this guy sister if you could start playing I don't want to make it about this guy because it'll fail and then our um Legacy would be like absolute destruction I am I ask each of you what seeds are you sowing in this life you're sowing seeds every single one of us is sowing seeds somewhere just think of these seeds that we're throwing out are they going to grow into good things are they going to grow into bad things some of these seeds we live in Arizona how many times have we tried that cut off and dig up a baby Mesquite I mean that thing's this big and it's root is this big it's hard to get rid of that thing imagine if that was a good gospel raising our children that root goes way down there is nothing in the world that can yank that out it'll grow and flourish one day as soon as it gets a little bit of sunshine and a little water make sure it's not a negative seed because sometimes those things are hard to get rid of too foreign once again read [Music] this verse that I started with James chapter 4 verse 14. says this it says whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow for what is your life it is it is even a vapor that appeareth for a little time and then vanish at the way how important is this time that we have here friends how I want to make a mark I want to sow seeds that are going to grow into trees that are going to give fruit you know take this one little seed just this one little seed and you plant it and you never know how great it's going to be but sometimes that plant will grow and I may be the little seed but I want to see in the future if there is one I want to see a whole tree but Steve just bearing fruit everywhere it can I want to see it happen to you too do you brothers and sisters it's an opportunity I I've read in this second Timothy how this is our modern day and that frog that was in the water he didn't even notice he didn't even notice what was going on around him but these things have never happened they've never gone on it's never even been possible for these scriptures to come to pass until today but they are like I said I'm not preaching against social media or anything like that I just want to look around and say that it is here lovers of their own selves oh yeah thank God I thank God that he has given us his word I thank God that he has given his son Jesus Christ and and I really I thank God that all the mistakes that I've made they're under the blood of Jesus Christ and I can still like Peter like David like all these other ones I can still preach his gospel I can still follow him even though there are stains in the past which every one of us there are stains there but by the grace of God we can spread this gospel and we can move forward and let me tell you friends if this is the end which it is Jesus is coming he's coming soon it's going to be any day so be ready and make sure others are ready I got a letter I get a couple letters that correspond with a few of the of the prisoners and I was thinking that scripture about those when they they reprint bring them back and I look at some of these these prisoners these inmates they're in prison and they are taking these seeds that they have and they are preaching the gospel trying to plant these seeds so they'll grow in other places you know that song comes to my mind I I thought about that video and I just raised my hand thanking God that no matter what we've done and those those people in that prison they've done a lot I'm sure God Made A Way and I thank God he's made a way for me brother Matt if you'd come oh yeah it's just it's a somber moment but I want to end end on a happy note friends I I want us to all appreciate one another appreciate each other what the gods get what God's given us he's given us a place to worship he's given us good friends he's given us loved ones I'm I'm grateful brother and I'm grateful for all of it I thank God that I have an opportunity to be part of a congregation I thank God I have an opportunity to call myself a Christian today let's sing them let's let's sing it a little bit more

lifting up the people encouraging the people serving the people that's why they were successful that's why our brother Peter was successful that's why our brother David was successful I can't wait to see him one day we are going to fall down at the man that died on this cross we're gonna fall down on his feet and we're going to worship and we're going to worship him forever in eternity we're going
