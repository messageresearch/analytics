is [Music] God bless you all yeah um it's been about close to a year ago that I finished um a Bible that I read from Genesis all the way to Revelation and I humbly say that that was probably about the 10th time reading the Bible from beginning to end and um after I finished Bible I started another one because I highlight the whole Bible to Market and and whatever and so I said well I'm gonna have to see if I can find me any other Bible usually I pick him up as a thrift store and um anyway so a few days later after I finished the Bible um I was uh in front of the building waiting for my nephew and I was going to take him somewhere and um this man that I know came to choose a car and he said I have a book for you and he says I know how you'd like to read the Bible and pray and I have this book for you and so he gave me this bag I took out the I took out the book and it turned out to be this uh King James version of a Bible and with big letters so I was so blessed with that oh I've just kept praising the Lord all the way to where me and my nephew my daughter were going to go I was just so happy and I showed it to my nephew and shared with him how happy I was about that Bible well having said that um luckily I'm able when I work I've been working all week and whenever I work I'm able to take my Bible and read it I pray at home for half an hour or so and then I pack up my Bible with my food and take it to work and um and the co-worker he knows not to interrupt me when I'm reading and if he does I just look at him and and then he shuts up anyway so uh luckily I've been able to nobody says anything I'm able to take my Bible to work and as soon as I get a little something done I pull up my Bible and read the chapter for the day uh and uh anyway so but on Thursday of last week um I was called to see if I could help out in the in at the food program they were handing out food and I was called and it was be I was supposed to be there between nine and ten so I stayed there and I finished what I had to do and then I had to go up and grab something to eat in my Bible and and I hadn't read my Bible that morning and so I went and grabbed my Bible and a book I was reading of the Holocaust and then I had to go work in the council office um because they made me vice president anyway so um I went to go work and um and I took a couple of jokes water but I mean jokes that I had to fill up so I I get there and the president of the council was there so um so I wasn't able to use my desk and and when she was busy doing paperwork with a social worker so I went I took my Bible and the book I was reading out and I placed them on a little shelf uh that was you know that was there and I took the and I excused myself and went to go get my jokes a while or came back and um and I didn't know where else to go so I went to a back room and I grabbed my book of of the Holocaust I'm going to finish reading it I read that and then uh it was probably close to New and I was getting hungry so I excused myself again and I had begun something at my apartment so I left to go to my apartment to pick up what I was going to get and when I came back nobody was in the office it was left open it was empty and nobody was there so I went back to my little spot in the back and I prepared my meal and oh and then I excused myself again while I went down to pick up some ice cream from where they had Danielle ice cream I came back and I ate my meal and I was throwing away a plastic bag and the trash can back there I'm hardly ever there I you know um anyway and so I went to go throw this plastic bag away and I see the covering put my Bible in there and the first thing that I think is why did they throw my Bible away I look in there and I got the cardboard out and it had been torn off of my Bible and but by my Bible wasn't there and and so I went into the office by then there was a few people coming and going of the council and I said does anybody know what happened to my Bible and some of them they said no whatever anyway to make sure this one woman said your Bible's missing I go yeah somebody took the cover up and threw in the trash but my my Bible is gone and I was really close to tears you know and um anyway and so then um this woman one woman that worked in the council well as council member she says well we could buy you another Bible and um I mean I wouldn't I wouldn't have taken your Bible she said I just got I just barely started going to church and this lady that I'm going to church with gave me a brand new Bible and so I you know I wouldn't take your Bible everybody was saying they didn't take it anyway um I everybody laughed funny and about they left about three o'clock the president of the council and so I had to work until four but um anyway I finished reading my book on the Holocaust and I just sat there and wait you know did my duties and I went home as soon as I went home I just burst out crying I was so sad but I'd be you always tell tears of joy but anyway um that went on that was Thursday when on Thursday Friday I think on Friday I um I had talked to um uh a security guard and asked him if he would look at the footage on the cameras because we have cameras outside the office anyway he did and he they run they asked him and he said no I didn't show anything I mean I could really tell people coming and going to the office then on um I think it was on Saturday I'm not too sure what day maybe but oh yes it was Friday night I talked to another security guard and he let me go in the office and look at the footage and there was one person that I could see like getting something from the shelf and putting it in a bag and then she walked out with her bags and then um before I told the the security guard I think he says you know it seems like there's that woman with the yellow blouse and I had come to the same conclusion and so I let it go and and I was praying Lord forgive me if I'm feeling uh selfish but maybe that woman needed it more than me um if that's the issue then you know whatever your will is but then again with Christ says Lord I want that Bible it means a lot to me anyway and then so anyway um that went on for days and Sunday I was just crying and crying and so I got another Bible I was reading another Bible and I thanked the Lord that at least I was able to read that Bible and take it to work with me Saturday and Sunday I took it to work with me on Monday I'm trying to make this as quick as possible and monkey that woman that I suspected um that had uh had taken my Bible she came down and to the back dog where I was working and she said have you found the Bible and has it showed up and and I got up and I said well you know I took it down the hall and I took her you know what it's being brought to my attention that you took it you know and um and I thought maybe you need it more than me or whatever and she said no you remember I told you I had a brand new Bible I would never take it and I go well I mentioned it to management that my Bible was stolen I've taken and I also mentioned it to the president of the council that my Bible was taken and um I I saw it in the in the book footage from the cameras and I said some and it shows that you took it and she goes well and I said maybe you took it by mistake whatever reason you might take it have taken it from my mistake but uh and I have another Bible but I I really love I really would like that Bible back and she's everything called I will go back up to my apartment I will look for it and if I find it I'll bring it back to you um about half an hour or so later me and my daughter were going out I was had to go pick up a prescription and the young the security that worked in the morning came out he says oh I heard you found your Bible I says what who told you about it he said and he mentioned the woman's name that had taken my Bible and and so um it's oh that's great anyway um I go we start going back to back to the car and then she calls me and she told me uh that she had found my Bible that yeah she had up an apartment and she must have gotten by mistake picked you know pet with the stuff that she had taken up anyway so I met her in the lobby and she gave me my vibe I was so happy and she showed me the brand new Bible that the other girl that she's going to church with uh had buy was a beautiful Bible with big letters everything I fell in love with it too but anyway um I was so happy to get my Bible and she hugged me and she said I'm sorry and she had tears in her eyes but um I don't know but I got my Bible back [Applause] [Music] [Music] let's all stand didn't have any prayer requests tonight [Music] oh Lord Jesus we just we're here to worship you tonight Lord and hear from

just want to give my own back to you let's just bow our heads for a moment Lord we are the testimony of our sister Amelia Lord Lord there are many books books of everywhere Lord but how precious your word is to us Lord it's not so much the book itself Lord [Music] because many have read the book many have read it from cover to cover and argued over and but it's that life Lord that wrote that book lord that we desire and it's precious to us today Lord it's all our hope it's all our desire father we just thank you Lord that you return that Bible Lord to our sister Lord it just shows how mindful you are of us Lord Lord as we Minister your word Lord those things are placed in our Heart Lord may we just may we just Express those things Lord each heart expressed you how much we love you Lord as you've expressed to us your love Lord Jesus we ask you in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you you may be seated good to have sister Lily back feeling better now I appreciate that amen and sister Martha isn't here to thank her personally but glad to have sister Martha helping out and it's uh it's always good to to help one another and be with one another and I know tonight is graduation night from schools for the Lyle sister Heather we're going to be with one of their granddaughters grandchildren not sure but many places so it'll be the start of a different part of life especially for the high school and the college grads and God bless them the Christian ones and and those all that would turn their face to him and say Lord Direct Me Guide Me a lot of decisions to make way to go how to continue what's next in life but if we get committed to the Lord he said he would never leave us and never forsake us so I appreciate that and God bless each one of you coming out tonight lord said where two or three are gathered in his name he'd be in our midst and that's what makes it worth it also brother Daniel had mentioned to me if I would take the service tonight and I said it will I began promise I will preach or what because sometimes I get out quite late and he said well I'll give you I'll set up a tape to be ready if that if that's what you can't make it will do and so I listen to that tape and I listened to there's three different tapes of brother Daniel and he was I heard this one you ought to hear this one and I don't know there's one that's not a good tape to listen to they're all but sometimes just something just strikes your heart something that are in the show I just finished listening to Restoration of the Bride tree and then there's the acts of the Holy Spirit and and it's just realizing the work that God has done but it's not just a work in the sense I did this work now admire but a work that he did so that you could participate and be part of it and it's his desires so we'll take it this portion out of the book of Romans and I would call it it's it's the acts of the holy spirit in US it's not wasn't the the acts of the disciples or the apostles but the Holy Spirit acting through them and them giving of themselves and yielding brother Branham says in in brother Jordan there's just one to go over three short quotes here and some things that brother Branham said about this and um the first one in my angel shall go before thee he says Thou was not Moses that was sent Moses was just the instrument and you and I are the instrument that God God uses today now in my heart I I believe that God has always been the same All Through the Ages in every age he's been just as it was at the beginning he was manifested in the fatherhood he was manifested in the sonship he would he's manifested now in the dispensation of the Holy Spirit we're not living we're living not in the Christian dispensation but in the Holy Spirit dispensation the acts of the holy spirit in the church the church reaction to what the holy spirit is in them as I read that last line is what you're manifesting shows what spirit's in you and he said it's the reaction of of the holy spirit in them and then from Witnesses the next quote there he says and now I want to read some in the New Testament in the first chapter of the acts of the Apostle the apostles I think this should be called the acts of the holy spirit in the apostles it was the way the Holy Spirit made the apostles act after he came and in in 63 in the token he said but Believers take the token and what Jesus began to do in Galilee he continues to do now through his display of the token of the Holy Spirit back upon the church for it was not the acts of the Apostle it was the acts of the Holy Ghost in the apostles and that was the token and sometimes it's we might look at well that's a godly man that's a Godly sister that's a Godly brother and boy he's full of the Holy Ghost well that's it he's full of the Holy Ghost she's full of the Holy Ghost I was I was talking um with my wife and and you know we as Christians and as humans we we want to be good we want to do good um you know I don't think sister Emilio wanted to get angry at that lady but she wanted her Bible you know it's but our good deeds will not save us but I would ever say stop doing the good deeds because it won't save you in fact Christ in you should be allowing you to do those things you know and I was telling you there's just some wonderful people out there some great people well known in the world well known through history talk about Abraham Lincoln we talk about the different ones they talk about Mother Teresa and the wonderful people doing great Deeds doing good things and that is wonderful but that will not save you it's what God did for you that brings salvation now what you do back is because you love him and you say Lord I would do this and I want others to know this and we said that is the token the Holy Spirit In You and without it there is no way to go on there is no token to continue on as he would say oh you're going to get on the train brother Ramson there's that token you're gonna you show that that the price has been paid already and as as I was looking at this and from the restoration of the Bride tree as I was listening to that and I realized it was Christ taking back that which had been lost or had been set back in the beginning and restoring it and I was sharing some things with my wife she usually gets to hear it first and I tell her you know does it make sense is it coming you know I know what I'm thinking but sometimes the words don't come out that way and I said the restoration of the Bride tree and it just made me think you can't get in an argument with the Devil because he will say I was there when it happened in fact I caused the trouble in the first place I was there he said before I was cast down I could tell you what it's like you can't get into an argument with him you have to take God at his word sometimes I my imagination will go this way my thoughts will go that way but you got to check it does it stay true to the word of God and and how many times brother Branham brought this to our attention even Jesus when Satan came to Temple and he said it is written it is written it is written he didn't go be beyond anything so if we can go back to the word of God we can see what God has to us and then we have to say it be it unto me according to Thy word Lord and then so in the restoration of the Bride tree it's a he is bringing back that which was lost but it was lost for a purpose for a reason and and as I thought about that you you start looking through history as you know there's a job and then there's Noah and we come to Abraham and thinking about Abraham and Sarah and I said here's Abraham and Sarah let's tell my wife they they became older folks as time went on they had not had children they wanted children and they got beyond that that age to Bear children but God said through thy seed and that was what God's word said through you Abraham and Sarah and we know when he gives them that promise sitting there in the tent that Sarah laughs in her heart saying how can this be I'm beyond that how can all of this be but God had said so and he restores them back to a young couple and and that's that's a view of what God is going to do with us restore us back to but Abraham and Sarah got old again and Abraham and Sarah passed away so that was just a type but today there is a group of people who are not going to see death but they're going to be changed from this Mortal to immortality and I count myself as one of those and Lord I I've confessed your word I've accepted you I've been baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ you've given me the Holy Ghost I believe I'm one of them and I'll stand on that and brother Branham says on just some things as I was listening it's a good thing to be a Christian I like that statement it's a good thing to be a Christian because there is no hope on the outside and he says and then he says when God speaks it's perfect it doesn't have to be retracted Rewritten hey can you check this to no when God speaks it's perfect it's complete it's whole it's as it should be and then as he's talking through through and this was through the three different messages just some notes out of that it's God's in spirit form in you Christ in you the hope of glory I I shared this before with you and it reminded me brother Ram says they would say you don't know him well your theology is not that good you know how to put all the words together he goes I may not know the book very well but I'm very good friends with the author the one that wrote the book and that's where the difference is and and to me we were driving into church one day and we were talking about it this and I said it would be like if you wrote a book and I'm reading it and I read through a verse there or or a paragraph and I turn around and goes I think you meant this and this what you wrote that and then she would say no when I wrote that I was thinking this and this and this because she's the author of the book well if we go and talk to him and say Lord I'm reading your scripture what does it mean I'm not understanding this part it's and then he begins to share it with you and then it's real then it becomes so is it so it's God in that Spirit form in you he says you didn't join this body you were born into it it's God in spirit form and you're born you're Christian you're part of the family of God you know so God predestinated you and sometimes that word predestined or or uh you know foreknowledge of God depends which word you some people they foreknowledge I understand predestination is based on the foreknowledge of God he knows what's going to happen it's kind of like a mother or father that has a child that is sticking their hand in the fire you pretty well got an idea what's going to happen don't you because you probably did it yourself too you're going to burn yourself you know it's it's I know it so I I I stop them don't do that that's going to hurt how do you know Dad because I've done it before and it hurts you know so he said you are predestinated and then he ties it in all that the father has given me will come and not one will be lost not a single one that faith on the cross you and I had we been standing there watching the crucifixion would have said if we'd known Jesus he doesn't deserve it but those two do they're up on the cross before their crimes but he did no crime but I I just said this I I to my thought was Lord Jesus he said it's time to get on that cross now because there's going to be a thief next to me that I'm going to turn around and speak to and say this day you'll be with me in Paradise had it happened the day before but God's timing is perfect without fault he says and not one will be lost saved by grace and not by works not your ability to live a Christian Life but you do it because you love him never because Lord this is good enough therefore you have to save me and this is where Paul gets into that in in Romans chapter 8. and um I I was thinking of a good friend of mine a good brother and but when he lived in the world he he got tattoos on his arms and stuff like that and when he became a Christian he was so embarrassed of them so he always wore long sleeve so that nobody would see it he'd always said I'm just embarrassed of it I wish I'd never done it and it just made me I was remembering that it made me think I I understand you can go now and have them removed it's a painful project I'm sure but when this portal shall put on immortality all the evidence of that life will be gone and done with what a hope we have brother Branham says when the angel of the Lord asked him he says would you like to get a come over onto the other side and brother Brown said oh it would help me so much wouldn't it be wonderful just to be able to step in there and just see it just for a few moments to know it's worth it all you know and he said they were young they were beautiful they were clean they were holy there was no evidence of of this world there on the other side but in the meantime you have to battle with it you have to and and this where I believe Paul is talking there in in Romans Romans chapter 8 there that we're going to get into a little bit you know and and so let's look at let's start with verse 1 chapter 8 and and we're not going to read the whole chapter straight through we're going to go through most of it but to save a little bit of time and try not to be too long you know brother Branham tells you see yourself in the scriptures see yourself in the scriptures there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit there is no condemnation you are not guilty when you are condemned you're found guilty but he says there's no condemnation now you'll stop and you start looking at your own life sometimes well I've done this I've done that but his blood covers it all you know when you go and you make it right and you put it under the blood you confess your sin whatever it is you make it right and it's it's done away with except it stays here in you in your memory yeah but you go to God and you tell them I've done it again and he looks at the book he says no this is the first time you've done it there's no evidence that you've ever done it before if you've made it right but you struggle with it here and and so but Paul says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit remember you are a child of God you are in Christ Jesus you're part you know Mary had to say be it unto me according to Thy Word when the angel came to her and said you're going to have a child without knowing a man and she said be it unto me according to Thy Word you have to say the same thing be it unto me according to Thy word there is therefore no condemnation you're not found guilty he took the guilt for you for the law of the spirit of Life In Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death not bound not tied to it there are going to be a people who are going to be raptured are going to have a change without death and they're going over to the other side there is some because the scripture says so and I believe I'm going to be one of those and so the law of the spirit that is the gospel has freed me from the law of sin and death which was a mosaic dispensation for Moses Moses gave them the law you shall do this and you shall not do this if you do this this is the the results of that and who could keep the law no one was able to keep the law perfect they would stand outside the congregation with us then when the when the high priest went in once a year to offer that sacrifice and it would stay out to watch the smoke to see if it had been accepted by the Lord and they knew their sins were forgiven rolled back for another year but then they went back out and began to do the same things they had done before there was not a change but in today when you accept that perfect sacrifice and it is accepted for you it brings a change into you the desire begins to change and no longer and sometimes yes this flesh what you have on you and you battle it this flesh is not the redeemable part it's that which is inside of you that Christ is but you came in flesh and that's the one you struggle with but you have to take the word of God and apply there is therefore now no condemnation for what the law could could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh he put it the end of it you know when brother Branham he talks about that that time that he he went to the that restaurant and that that lady was there and all that was going on and he got very critical very upset very how can how can you stand this God how you can and he's the angel that pulls him outside and begins to show him what he looked like before God that reminds me what brother green said brother Branham told him he said brother mcgreen he said where you stand everything you do is send to me and boy that that had been pretty hard to take I'm sure but he says before God where I stand everything I do is send to him so and the honest truth all of us are sinners saved by grace how many appreciate the grace of God the mercy of God amen so he says for what the law could not do that it was weak through the flesh you could not serve perfect law through the flesh David is David a man after God's Own Heart that was his desire that was Israel as a man after God's Own Heart yet he looks and he sees a woman that is another man's wife and has the man put to death so he could take her yet he was a man after God's Own Heart but you know where it showed when the prophet comes and he comes up to him and says David let me tell you what happened down here there was two men one had a large flock of sheep and one had one and the one that had a large flock of sheep one of his friends came over and in order to feed him he took and killed the Lamb of the one that only had one and fed him and David says that man should die and the prophet says that's you David that's you you took another man's wife and caused him did I and David throws himself down and says Lord forgive me immediately and didn't make excuses didn't begin to say well it's because of this and it was that fault in this but he began to say God have mercy on me because he was a man after God's Own Heart and what is God's Own Heart forgive them they don't know what they're doing that's God's Own Heart Jerusalem Jerusalem how oft what I stood over you in the mount look at him he said and and coverage you as a hand covers it but you would not and then they hear you later after when he appears again to them when we're up in heaven and he's they ask him where did you get those scars in the house of my friends he comes back to them because his desire was to them how he says and then we'll jump over to chapter verse 9. but you're not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you I'm gonna raise my hand and acknowledge the spirit of God dwells in me amen I look at myself sometimes I say oh Lord sometimes this Spirit seems to be stronger than your spirit but I know I know it's you and me he says but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if it's so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of God Christ is none of his so he says if you could be very religious you could go to church every day you could read your Bible today if you could pray but if the spirit of Christ I mean he says there is nothing there I I I've some good friends some wonderful people sometimes I think they embarrass us sometimes they're better than us but they'll deny the word of God but they're good people but as if the spirit of Christ is not in you you're not one of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness the body is dead you have to reckon it dead Paul says that I have to but then also Paul says oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me I find myself doing what I don't want to do and what I want to do I'm not doing not Paul not the one that wrote all these scriptures yes he was a man verse 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you to Quicken to bring to life something that we thought had life but was really dead I'm having a great time in the world I'm having a wonderful time doing all this but the scripture says you're dead just don't know it yet you know but if that it'll Quicken it'll bring to life and and to me I've always looked at this scripture the Rapture I'm going no it's right now it's what's happening today it's bringing it to life today this is and then for we'll go to verse 11. I mean verse 14. for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God amen they are the sons of God it's an attribute of them more and more I look in the mirror and I see my dad I said boy that's I'm looking a lot like my father now and that's in the natural mirror I'm talking about and I I said well you know they always tell me don't get older because all those things began to happen but unless a Rapture takes place we're all going to get older and we look back now and and those things happen but I see my father and I've always said it's a good thing that I see my father in me because if I didn't see my father and me there might be a question who is my father but if I have the the attributes of my father then they say you're like your father and that's who a Christian is the attributes of the father and he says for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear you were in bondage at one time and there was a fear with it have I done enough to please God is there enough works done to get me into heaven is this good enough or do I need to do more when will it be enough in your own goodness to get you there who's going to judge that who is the standard to be like Jesus but it's with his spirit he says before you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have the received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father my father my God verse 16 the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirits that we are the children of God you know I um I was my oldest daughter's birthday the other day and all she asked Mom was could you make tacos for my birthday and I said that's my daughter because she'll ask me what do you want to eat tacos you had him yesterday I said yeah that was yesterday today's yeah but you know just the simple things that's my daughter that's my son you know the father is up there and he's proud that those are my children look at them they're they're doing the things that please me you know and he said we are the children God and if children then heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we also that we be also glorified together there is suffering a Christian Life some of the suffering we do ourselves with things that we know we shouldn't have done that we shouldn't have done it Lord forgive me but if you are a Christian Satan knows you're a Christian he knows a Christian a real true Christian and he's going to go after them he's going to try to cause them all he wants to make a display of you make others say well if that's Christianity I don't want any of it but if you go back into the New Testament and I love that and even in the ultimate it shows both sides of the life their failures their faults and the blessings and the wonderful things that God did Jacob wrestling with the angel was the same Jacob that defrauded his father but here he is wrestling with it shows both sides the same brother Branham who could stand here and say I take every Spirit under my control as the same brother at Branham that told sister me to tell them I'm not here and ran out the door the man's side you and I the same one that sister Melia wanted that Bible but also thinking she stole my Bible the evidence but she said I just wanted the word of God I wanted that back you know he said for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US and you know That Glory is being revealed now that's not something that we wait till we get to heaven it should be being revealed that's Christ in you the hope of glory you say you know the Lord did this for me and somebody comes up to you and says you know there's a light about you there's something about you or whatever it is that you did and it's God being manifested in you it it it's it sometimes seems this little but it might be life to someone else if you just shared one sentence one word one scripture and it clicked in their heart and with that they gave their life to God it would be worth it all wouldn't it even though it was just one something minor would seem to you he says for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestations of the sons of God what is the manifestations of the sons of God they're just like Jesus they had to take notice that they had been with Jesus they're doing the same things they're acting the same way Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I give to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ rise up and walk was that Peter doing no it was Christ in him that's what the Holy Ghost is that's what the indwelling of the holy spirit is likewise the spirits also help us helpeth our infirmities and there's a lot of those sometimes you know I said for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself make us intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and and that is the truth sometimes you're just there and you're groaning you're moaning you desire God so much you don't mind much you can't even put it into words sometimes I think maybe we put it into too many words we pray God a whole Bible and God is looking past all that he said I know what you have native and they know how to work it and so and that he searches the heart he that searches the heart knows what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh the intercession for the Saints according to the will of God what is best for you what is best for me that is the acts of the holy spirit in you and in me and if you want to see how it acts go back to the scripture and let's see how it acts go back to to to those that got to be around brother Branham they thought he was God because he lived this it actually worked if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover it was a man of faith and you say well God gave him that gift yet but he had to accept and believe it too just like you have to believe it for yourself and and sometimes I think the the problem becomes when we have time to think about it and we talk ourselves out of a promise we think ourselves out of a situation but if you stand there and you say I am a child of God and you let God Act watch what he'll do there was a uh two brothers and and they were at a at work and it was right next to the road and somebody got run over in front of them and they ran over to see and I believe it was a lady and she was on the on the road and um like hopeless is what they thought and the other brother who saw them go he goes did you even pray for her and the other brother stopped because I didn't even think of it he goes well that should have been the first thing you should have done reached out and asked but sometimes we look at a situation and say it's hopeless but there's nothing hopeless to God there's nothing too far gone is able to take and restore you know and and I have found some of my greatest blessings when I didn't stop to think about it but just ask God to take care of it I didn't tell Lord this is how you need to do it but Lord can you take care of this and he does he knows how to do that he that searches the heart no noeth what is the mind of the spirit because he make his intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and I like this and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose even though the wrong turn you go down the wrong Street you have to Make U-turn to come back and you're a little frustrated because you lost five minutes but God said okay in those five minutes I took care of this sometimes we just have to say Thank You Lord you know what's best for me for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren predestinate by foreknowledge he understood he knew why it wasn't just a random choice but he knew you would be part of there you were part of him moreover whom he did predestinate he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified to be justified brother green used to say he's a crooked as lawyer around he takes the evidence that of what you did and gets rid of it and then he says no they didn't do it prove it to me that he did it because he took care of it through the blood I can come and do his presence it's been washed it's been cleaned but sometimes we come into the prayer his try to come in his presence with the memories of what we've done Lord I don't know how many he says come and put it under the blood come into that direction and let me deal with it I've heard testimonies of those who have come to the altar with a cigarette happen and just leave it right there and walk out without it that habit let God took it then he'd come up and say Lord I did a hundred years or 100 days of good works now you owe it to me they come up here and say Lord I've got a habit can you get rid of it for me and God do it what shall we say then to these things if God before us who can be against us well I'll tell you who I struggled the most with against us and that's me that's the one I struggle the most with because I say God how could you love this how could you put up with this and he says because I love you because I care for you because you're one of mine you know it's it's it's you know I'll say this because it is true when you have more than one child you look at this one and you compare them sometimes and you say this one and they compare each other I heard one man say we had two children there for I could have my favorite and she could have her favorite you know just kind of laughed about it but that's human We compare we look and we say but God looks at us all the same there's not one more Bader there's not one worse there's not one less they are all children of God we ought to look at one another that same way if God before us who can be against us who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God's it is God that justifies when I looked at that who I tend to do it to myself that's the one yeah sister Shirley yes no problem she's a saint she's perfect she doesn't have an issue but that sister surely tell her side of it I have my struggles I have more hard times you know I know brother Dave Fritz there a perfect man are you awake Dave yeah he moved his head you know I just that's who we are the struggle is within ourselves I can give Grace to everybody but I have to also say Lord I'm yours also I'm your child and he says who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us father they didn't mean to do that in their in their intentions they wanted to do right they wanted but but they made a mistake forgive them and the father looks down at that sacrifice and he says it's all taken care of it's covered it's paid for then he goes on to say who shall separate us from the love of God shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or naked or Peril or sword or my own thoughts my own feelings my own actions no nothing shall separate us from the love of God he loved us you heard brother green always said this one he said could God love you more and he said no he's loved you fully perfectly completely his love is perfect could he love you less no he loves you so what can you do about it you can love him more but he's loved you he gave his life he did everything for you he's provided for that already he says as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter I wonder sometimes when Paul writes it was writing these words how much he's being troubled himself about himself but under inspiration he's writing this you know he says on every side we're persecuted on every side where but then he says nay in all things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us we are more than conquerors I like brother Green's description of a conqueror the boxer got into the boxing ring and fought all 12 rounds and he beat the other man he was the winner the Conqueror and then they gave him the check and he went home and he gave it to his wife and she was more than the Conqueror we are the benefits of the one who conquered all and he says we are more than conquerors we receive the benefits of what he did for us for I am persuaded he says that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come what you're going through today the battles that you're going through today if you live through tomorrow what you go those things to come nothing he says I am persuaded nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord now if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you that's Christ Jesus our lord so nothing shall separate you from the love of God unless you refuse to accept it unless you refuse it that's your choice that that Rich Young Ruler he comes good Master what should I do what can I do to inherit eternal life the Lord looks at him and the Bible says he loved that young man and he says do this this he goes I've done that since my youth I've obeyed the law one thing thou has he looks past that bingoes here's your issue sell all that you have and give it to the poor and come follow me and a man stopped for a minute he goes wow just can't do that I just can't do that yet he said the Lord love that man but he couldn't give up that last little bit what is it I really have to look at my own life what is it that I'm still holding on to nor Heights he said for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord now the holy spirit is God in spirit form in you not the physical body but his Spirit his presence in you he's with you where you go and brother Brandon makes this statement he says sometimes you can offend him sometimes we offend each other sometimes I tell her she says what's going on I'm just going to go outside and I'm going to clean the yard because I'm upset and rather than take it out on her or one of them I take it out on the weeds and the dirt and everything else and then when I've tired and burned it all out then I come back in and I sit down with her and I say okay let's make this right because all the anger is now burned out all of that and you're not going to do something you're going to regret even more so it works for me it may not work for you but it works for me that way if I'm frustrated get away from it for a while let it burn off let it go away and then come and speak reasonably yeah you know where we're not having then to make something else right again and and we do those things we get angry we get upset we get hurt we react you know and then the quickest way the fastest way to resolve that is just say I'm sorry forgive me I didn't mean to do that honestly and and forgiveness is in two parts you ask for forgiveness the person forgives you and then you have to forgive yourself I have put it under the blood therefore it's not there anymore and yet you have to believe that that when God forgives you and cleanses you it's done with don't bring it up again now tomorrow you might fail again and you might have to make that right again but that there is no record in there brother Ram talks about that Vision when he saw the book it opened up there was nothing against him in the book it had been cleaned it had been washed it had been erased it's been thrown into the sea of God's forgetfulness and if he can't bring it up then don't bring it up yourself either and sometimes we live too much in the memories of things that have happened I was talking with a brother one day and I told him about that experience of making that right at at Old Tucson and he says brother Aaron what about some things that happened way back in your life that you don't even know where those people are you have how what do you do about those I said I know what you're talking about because there are some things that people I wish I could go back and say I'm sorry when I did that to you but sometimes you can't who knows what happened when you've never seen them again you're never you know that which you can make right you make right you do right the rest you have to put under the blood and say Lord I'm sorry but again nor heightened nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord and you know which creature you suffer with most how many knows which creature it has brother Silas said it's him he pointed at himself we should all be pointing at our own selves this is the one you suffer with the most this is the one that you take with you go everywhere this is the one this is the one that gives you most of the trouble but he says no creature shall God looks at you through the blood the acts of the Holy Spirit in you it's Christ in you the hope of glory and you know it's it's one of those things sometimes that we I could I say we overthink it and and sometimes and and I I get to thinking about the things that this God has done for me it overwhelms me and I just say Lord you've been so good to me and then I get to the thinking about the things I've done to him and I'm saying Lord how can you even be want to be around me you know but I'm his son when he takes that that example of the of the father and the Prodigal Son the the son that went out and took his inheritance and went and wasted it but it says the father was looking out for the sun to come back the Sun finally comes to himself and says the servants in My Father's House live better than I do they can eat they have a place to sleep they have and here I am in the in the pig pen fighting with the pigs for for their food and I'm trying to eat it myself I'm a mess it doesn't say how long it took but there came a time when he came to that place and he says I'll go back to my father's house and that was the first thing I'll go back to my father's house go back to him he's the one that loves you he's the one that cares for you he knows you by name he knows who you are he knows everything about you and he loves you anyways and and he goes I'll go back to my father's house and I'll come back and I'll tell him dad I made a mess in my life I've wasted all the inheritance I did things I should have never done this and the other I got to a point dad that I was living in the pig pen with the pigs remember I remember how when when I was younger you counseled me I remember all the things you shared with me I remember what you told me and you gave me good advice but I went against it and I left and I did these things is there any hope for me I'll just be a servant of yours they get treated better they're treated better than how I'm living and he's coming back up thinking all those things going through his mind that the scripture talks about but he's come back and said this is what I'm going to ask my father this is how I'm going to ask for forgiveness this is what I'm going to do but the father is on this side looking for the return of his son wait in fact he has a robe there for him he is prepared to receive his son but I've always wondered what the neighbors thought they seen the son leave there was probably a great commotion when he left my son is going out he's going to do this and he I'm going to be this I'm going to be that you know now here they see the sun coming up and doesn't look like the same guy that left he looks like a poor wretched beggar destroyed and they're probably maybe look at that look look what he's done with this life you know but the fathers runs towards his son he became me so that by I could become him through his love the father runs to him and the son says Dad I've made a mess in my life I'm not worthy to become be called your son not worthy at all let me be one of your servants I'll go and I'll live I'll live in the bunk house I'll clean the yard I'll do this I'll do that he goes you're my son you were my son from the beginning you'll always be my son this water cup stays here all the time and I always wonder at the end of service why didn't I drink any yeah but you're my son but he had a brother who never left his father's house and he gets upset at the father because his son who had gone out into the world and done all those things is now being treated and and you know exalted in front of everybody so when they came to where they had the the older brother wasn't there so his dad calls for him and he says where were you he said I've never left you Dad I've never done anything like that I've been the good boy I've I've been the one that's made you proud I'm the one that should be inheriting everything that's yours and you've never given me a party like you did for my brother who made a mess out of his life and he goes son all this is yours you just chose not to participate and take part of it all this is yours every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line but if I choose not to participate in it who's at fault I am you know the dinner is served and you choose not to eat what you know you can't blame the person that prepared the meal you chose not to eat you know I was listening reading listening to questions and answers and they asked brother Branham the question I think this was in the question answers in 64. and they asked brother Branham he said can we go should we go to another church or if you're not here he says can we should we go or should we not should we not go to another church unless you're preaching there and brother Brown says no no no absolutely not go to another church even if all you receive is one bite go get that bite be a brother be a friend what a difference in the spirit you know Jesus walked amongst the lowly the common people it was when they come looking for him they couldn't fight he couldn't find him because he disappeared right amongst the common people he became me so that I could become like him the musicians would come up brother Matt he would come up also the acts of the Holy Spirit In You that's what it's there for you can't do this by yourself you can't earn enough points to get into him and it's not a point system it's a token and he paid for it already he's already met the price he's already provided it you know we um we went up to the Flagstaff meetings last year we've been going up for a few years now enjoyed the time away enjoying the fellowship up there and all and we had rented a hotel or motel through the Flagstaff Tabernacle they set some aside and get it at a better price and brother Steve called me and he said brother Aaron how many of you are coming up I said just me and my wife and he goes could we move you to a a different place because we got a family that needs the two rooms I said sure whatever he goes he says we got an Airbnb and you guys can stay in there at no charge I didn't ask for them that wasn't in our thoughts we were going to go pay so I said well if that'll work that'll that'll be okay you know turned out to be a nice little place didn't it a very very nice place and it was owned by a brother so there was no Spirits in there it was a nice place we stayed in there five minutes away from the church so when it was time to leave my wife said we're going to clean this place very nice we're going to leave it and span and we did washed everything mopped and cleaned and made it look really nice really clean so when we got home brother Steve sent us a text and he said the brother said that you the the brother said the brother clean there was the cleanest uh this place has ever been and I said tell the brother it was the sister yeah but it's just an appreciation of what somebody did for you it's in no way to earn your salvation but in appreciation for what God has done for him he looked beyond my faults and he saw my need and I love him for that and his desire is for each one of you to draw closer to him and not just a draw closer but take that which he's given you and use it it's not just to have the book there but to put it into action he said they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover they will cast out demons in my name if they have any need of anything just call out for it and you can have it he's provided all your needs brother Brandon will say like that little mouse and the gardener and say I can't eat up all the thing or the little fish in the ocean I can't drink up all the water he said no it's full it's all yours let's stand [Music] I'm just gonna raise my hand I said Lord help me to be that which you you desire Lord we we acknowledge and we relieve your word tells us it's Christ in us the hope of glory the acts of the holy spirit in our life that that draws that part that is good Lord not ourselves Lord we just have to surrender you know say Lord you you you guide us you direct us let us be conscious of that and when we do fail we do something wrong quickly to make it right quickly say Lord turn back and walk where we should be walking it's your Amazing Grace It's Your Love To Us Lord and we appreciate it let that light Christ in us shine out to others that they may be desires
