[34:56] of us like the guy in the pulpit
[34:57] sometimes we'll get on a testimony and
[35:00] and keep going but um a testimony or if
[35:03] you have a song to bless the
[35:05] congregation with so come tonight and
[35:07] come tonight expecting because I think
[35:08] that we're going to hear some really
[35:10] really good things one thing that sister
[35:11] Amelia just shared with me um just
[35:14] coming in she so if you were here last
[35:18] week I gave the testimony about the
[35:20] thrift store that's down on Stone uh
[35:23] Avenue down here and how it was just an
[35:26] amazing coincidence that the one of the
[35:30] people that has been through the the
[35:32] drug abuse program the substance abuse
[35:34] program and was in the middle of it was
[35:37] actually from Jeffersonville where I was
[35:39] for about 17 years and I remember I was
[35:43] I was asking the Lord Lord is this
[35:45] something that that is is pleasing to
[35:48] you and then one more he gave me another
[35:52] um
[35:53] Vindication so then sister Amelia goes
[35:55] down there and uh were you shopping or
[35:58] dropping off stuff I think you were
[36:00] shopping so sister milia is in there and
[36:04] she uh she talks to the same brother
[36:06] that's behind the counter that I talked
[36:08] to remember there was all of these uh
[36:11] people in there that had been through
[36:13] the program and I was praying Lord give
[36:15] us something that we can turn people to
[36:18] that that we can help out the community
[36:21] and um so then I met the guy that was
[36:24] from Jeffersonville and uh so anyways it
[36:27] was just an amazing time so sister
[36:29] Amilia goes in there and she um tells
[36:35] the the guy behind the the counter she
[36:39] um uh he asked or I think he asked you
[36:41] where you go to church right or did you
[36:43] tell him first he asked sister milia
[36:46] where you go to church and she says well
[36:47] you just go up here at the Tucson
[36:50] Tabernacle and he and she told told him
[36:54] about the testimony that I gave last
[36:56] week and and he's like oh yeah and he
[36:58] remembered and he he started telling her
[37:00] about it was just amazing and then he he
[37:02] looked at sister Amilia and he said
[37:04] what's your
[37:06] name and she said Amilia Gonzalez and he
[37:10] goes I knew it he said you're Adam's
[37:14] mom so he had known sister Amelia's son
[37:19] previously and I don't know were they
[37:21] the same
[37:23] age about the same age maybe went
[37:25] through some of the same troubles
[37:28] together so it's just another
[37:30] Vindication another blessing to me so
[37:32] we'll the Lord's willing we hear
[37:34] testimonies like that um tonight and
[37:39] um I uh let's see I don't think I forgot
[37:43] anything as far as announcements the
[37:45] camp and then tonight I'm looking
[37:47] forward to the camp it was it was a real
[37:50] blessing to us last year and it's going
[37:52] to be better this year it's going to be
[37:55] exciting I um again I I appreciate the
[37:57] visitors coming I just saw brother Amos
[37:59] I haven't seen you in a long time he's
[38:01] been in Africa for a while it's good to
[38:04] have you back home back sitting here
[38:06] with us God bless you my friend and then
[38:09] as I said all the all the visitors we
[38:11] have know brothers and
[38:14] sisters we often separate
[38:19] ourselves and it doesn't please the Lord
[38:22] he says Jesus Christ himself said that
[38:26] there will be one
[38:28] Shepherd and one
[38:30] fold so how can there be all of these
[38:35] different groups I understand that we
[38:37] have to have a place to go to church and
[38:38] there's there's different groups that we
[38:40] have together but how can these these
[38:42] not agree with each other and I know the
[38:45] reason it's because our foundations are
[38:48] different there is only one foundation
[38:51] on and that is the foundation of the
[38:53] Gospel of Jesus Christ what is the
[38:56] gospel the gospel is is the good news
[38:59] that God sent the Messiah Jesus Christ
[39:03] now tell the world anything other than
[39:05] that is not the gospel the very
[39:06] definition of the Gospel is that is
[39:09] Jesus Christ that is our foundation that
[39:12] is the love that we should have for each
[39:14] other and and we do have for each other
[39:16] it is not in well I believe this way or
[39:18] I believe that way or I believe in this
[39:20] Prophet or that prophet of this way of
[39:22] having church or that way of having
[39:24] church I believe in Jesus Christ and him
[39:26] alone and he is the reason for every all
[39:30] of the love that's in the world it comes
[39:33] from him and he is the reason that we
[39:36] can gather together and you look at this
[39:38] church and there's many different types
[39:40] of people there's many people that look
[39:43] different ways and it should be that way
[39:46] brothers and sisters it should be that
[39:48] way you know how I know that because the
[39:50] man Jesus Christ
[39:52] came he had Mary
[39:55] Magdalene in his group a
[39:58] prostitute he had
[40:02] Nathaniel a well-rounded polished
[40:06] believer strong no gu in that man he had
[40:11] Peter and John rough
[40:14] fisherman Peter even a man that
[40:18] cussed I'm not right in doing it
[40:21] obviously but a man that had probably a
[40:24] foul mouth before he was with Jesus
[40:27] Jesus a whole different variety of
[40:30] people and that's who Jesus called his
[40:33] disciples and that's what we should have
[40:36] the Tucson
[40:37] Tabernacle as I've said many times it's
[40:41] a
[40:41] church but more important it is a
[40:46] Ministry if you come to this church
[40:49] don't come just to come and enjoy a
[40:53] sermon and sing songs of praise brothers
[40:56] and sisters there's other places that
[40:59] that that's four if you come here you
[41:02] have a Ministry you have something to do
[41:05] and there is a lot to do and it may be
[41:08] anything from helping around the church
[41:10] to witnessing everybody should be a
[41:12] witness first of all not everyone is a
[41:15] witness yes everyone is and it's to your
[41:18] family to your friends to the people on
[41:21] the street and I don't care what they
[41:24] look
[41:24] like I don't care their past
[41:28] right Jesus Christ didn't care he
[41:30] brought them in and then he wiped that
[41:32] past away he wiped those sins away and
[41:35] that's what this church is about it is
[41:37] about a Ministry in doing good and
[41:41] remember when you come to
[41:43] church it's not all about you something
[41:46] I say all the time you come to not only
[41:50] receive a blessing but more importantly
[41:52] you come to give a
[41:54] blessing you come to encourage you you
[41:57] come to to have a part in a great work
[42:01] what greater work is there than leading
[42:04] someone to Christ brother Mark there's
[42:06] no greater work and that person that
[42:09] that you lead to Christ maybe your
[42:10] daughter your son your brother your
[42:12] sister your neighbor someone on the
[42:15] street but there's no greater work that
[42:17] we could do and this book of
[42:20] Hebrews for our visitors we started a
[42:23] few months ago and I felt usually on
[42:25] Wednesday night we have a Wednesday
[42:27] night Bible study and that's that's our
[42:29] Wednesday night service and we we
[42:31] started in the book of Acts and we went
[42:33] chapter by chapter line by line all the
[42:35] way through the book of Acts then after
[42:38] that we started and we it's like well
[42:40] let's go through the whole Bible let's
[42:41] take one service and devote it to each
[42:43] book of the Bible so we do that on
[42:46] Wednesday night uh I'll be teaching on
[42:48] Jeremiah this coming Wednesday give an
[42:50] overview of of that book but I felt on
[42:56] my heart that this book of Hebrews is
[42:59] something that I would like to take for
[43:02] a Sunday
[43:03] morning and we've gone line by line word
[43:07] by word from Hebrews 1 all the way until
[43:10] now and if the Lord's willing we'll
[43:11] finish the book this morning it's
[43:14] written to Hebrews you can remember that
[43:19] it's written to Jewish people that had
[43:24] converted to Christianity so these are
[43:27] the the original Messianic Jews now
[43:29] today you see Messianic Jews and what
[43:31] they are is they converts to Judaism
[43:33] that now want to um have Jesus and
[43:36] Judaism together that's not that's just
[43:40] that that's called being a Christian if
[43:42] you accept Christ but these are the
[43:44] original ones the original Jews who
[43:47] accepted this man Jesus Christ and the
[43:50] author of this book is writing saying
[43:52] hey don't let these things
[43:55] slip you're starting to go back to your
[43:58] old way of thinking you're starting to
[44:00] go back to your legalism you're starting
[44:02] to go back to the what what you learned
[44:06] as a child but no this is something that
[44:09] you don't know the importance of it it
[44:11] is something so great this man Jesus
[44:14] Christ and the Very things that you want
[44:17] to go back to are what he
[44:19] fulfilled I've talked about it talks
[44:22] about the the high priest and how Jesus
[44:25] Christ is that true high priest one that
[44:27] doesn't have to make a sacrifice for
[44:29] himself because of his own sins because
[44:31] he was without sin he was the sacrifice
[44:35] and then it goes and we talk about we
[44:37] talked about MDC and his role this was
[44:39] actually this man Jesus Christ in
[44:42] another form way back hundreds and
[44:45] hundreds of years before Jesus came in
[44:48] the flesh and he made himself known to
[44:51] this man Abraham but he was different
[44:53] because he had no beginning of days or
[44:54] ending of life this man was
[44:59] God manifested in front of Abraham we
[45:02] talked about those things and we talked
[45:05] about in the the book of Hebrews keeps
[45:08] going back to the Jewish way of thinking
[45:11] and it keeps saying listen this man is
[45:14] the Fulfillment of all this all the
[45:18] prophets pointed to this man all of the
[45:23] scribes and all of the true teachers
[45:26] point
[45:27] to this man he is everything and that's
[45:30] what the book of Hebrews is is all about
[45:33] it's reminding the reader don't let
[45:36] these things
[45:37] slip you've been given a great honor and
[45:40] we take that all the way to today we
[45:42] have been given a great honor to know
[45:45] Jesus Christ as our
[45:47] savior so in Hebrews 11 Let's uh let's
[45:52] start let's let's dig into the word into
[45:55] the Bible let's go to Hebrews 11
[45:57] and we'll start with verse 32 just as a
[46:00] review of what we just came for Hebrews
[46:04] 11:32 says this and what shall I more
[46:08] say for the time would fail me to tell
[46:12] of Gideon and of baric and of Samson and
[46:14] of jeepa of David also and Samuel and of
[46:17] all the prophets who through faith
[46:20] subdued kingdoms W wrought righteousness
[46:23] obtained promises stopped the mouths of
[46:25] lions quenched the violence of fire
[46:28] escaped the edge of the sword out of
[46:30] weakness were made strong waxed Valiant
[46:33] in fight turned to flight the armies of
[46:35] the aliens women received their dead
[46:38] raised to life again others were
[46:40] tortured not accepting Deliverance that
[46:43] they might obtain a better
[46:45] resurrection and others had trial of
[46:48] cruel mockings and scorings yay moreover
[46:51] of bonds and imprisonment they were
[46:53] stoned they were saw asunder they were
[46:55] tempted were slain with the sword they
[46:57] wandered about in sheep skins and goat
[46:59] skins being destitute Afflicted and
[47:02] tormented of whom the world was not
[47:05] worthy I love that
[47:08] part praise the Lord because I want to
[47:12] be numbered with those people I want to
[47:15] be right there with them they lived in
[47:17] their day we live in this
[47:20] day they wandered in deserts and in
[47:22] mountains and in dens and caves of the
[47:24] earth and these all having obtained a
[47:26] good report through faith receive not
[47:28] the promise keep that in
[47:31] mind the author here is laying a
[47:33] foundation for what the close of his
[47:36] letter is going to be they receed not
[47:39] the promise God having
[47:41] provided some better thing for us that
[47:45] they without us should not be made
[47:48] perfect chapter 12 wherefore seeing we
[47:51] are also compassed about with so great a
[47:54] cloud of witness let us lay aside every
[47:56] weight and the sin which does EAS easily
[47:58] beset us and let us run with patience
[48:02] the race that is set before us so he he
[48:04] says here he says lay aside those things
[48:07] that weigh you down can you imagine a
[48:10] sprinter in the Olympics carrying a
[48:12] backpack and trying to run the 100
[48:15] meter and that's what he's telling us
[48:18] he's saying you're carrying a weight
[48:21] that you you don't have to
[48:23] carry he says get off Let It Go
[48:27] let that weight go and that weight can
[48:29] be anything we always think that that
[48:32] weight is a sin that we're doing and it
[48:35] is
[48:36] usually it's something that hinders our
[48:39] walk with the lord it's something that
[48:40] hinders our prayers and we're carrying
[48:43] this and we don't want to give up this
[48:45] this burden that we're Laden with so we
[48:48] carry it and he's like you got to run
[48:52] the race man run faster and you can't
[48:56] run faster
[48:57] carrying this heavy burden many times
[49:00] that heavy burden is our
[49:02] church many times it's the way that we
[49:05] believe and we we Laden ourselves with
[49:08] this heavy
[49:10] weight and down deep we know that it's
[49:13] not
[49:15] necessary in another
[49:18] place Paul says he says you lay these
[49:23] burdens upon these believe it's in
[49:24] Galatians you lay these burdens upon the
[49:27] people who which you yourself weren't
[49:30] able to
[49:31] carry and then you ministers are trying
[49:34] to pack them down with
[49:36] this that's not the way you throw these
[49:39] things off and now you're free and say
[49:43] Lord now you use me Lord now you tell me
[49:47] what I need to know that's the role of
[49:50] every minister of every true minister of
[49:52] God it's not to lay down a certain
[49:57] theology or a certain way of thinking
[50:00] everything that we do every scripture
[50:02] that we read every story that I tell
[50:06] should be to get you to talk to
[50:11] him and the closer you are to him the
[50:15] more that the pastor steps out because
[50:18] I'm going to
[50:19] fail but he will never fail the holy
[50:23] spirit that is within you will always
[50:24] tell you the right thing whether it be
[50:27] what time you get up in the morning to
[50:29] what what job that you take to where you
[50:31] go to church if you just know
[50:34] him then he will lead and he will guide
[50:38] and he promis to do it it's not just
[50:42] coming to
[50:43] church many times we come and we are
[50:48] ladened with a big burden sister
[50:52] milia that's that's some of the in the
[50:56] past pass there
[50:58] and it hasn't got us any closer to God
[51:03] but what gets us closer to God is throw
[51:06] off that burden and run the race to the
[51:10] author and finisher you you have your
[51:12] mind set and your heart set on Jesus
[51:14] Christ that's the Finish Line run that
[51:17] way don't run off the track this way or
[51:19] that way focus on
[51:25] him where was
[51:28] I for consider him that endured such a
[51:31] contradiction of Sinners against himself
[51:34] lest you be weary and faint in your
[51:35] minds you have not resisted under blood
[51:39] striving against sin so he's saying that
[51:41] listen I know you've tried and I know
[51:43] you've been working but you haven't
[51:45] resisted so
[51:47] much that you have shed your own
[51:50] blood against
[51:52] sin
[51:54] nobody set a beer in front of you and
[51:58] said drink it or we're going to beat you
[52:00] to death nobody's done that we do it we
[52:04] do it to
[52:05] ourselves nobody has has has told you
[52:09] that if you don't do this thing or that
[52:12] thing that you're going to get stabbed
[52:14] or you're you're going to get you're
[52:15] going to shed your own
[52:17] blood we can do it we can we can
[52:21] overcome
[52:24] sin and you have forgotten
[52:27] the exhortation which speaks unto you as
[52:30] unto children my son despise not thou
[52:33] the chastening of the Lord nor faint
[52:35] when thou are rebuked of him for whom
[52:37] the Lord loveth he chasteneth and
[52:40] scourges every son who whom he
[52:43] receiveth if you endure if ye endure
[52:46] chastening God dealth with you as Sons
[52:48] for what son is he whom the father
[52:51] chasteneth not if ye be without
[52:54] chastisement whereof all our partakers
[52:56] then you are bastards and not Sons
[53:01] Chason the dictionary says Chason is to
[53:04] inflict suffering upon for a purpose of
[53:07] moral Improvement every pretty much
[53:10] every other translation of the Bible
[53:12] says
[53:13] discipline we are disciplined a child
[53:16] without
[53:17] discipline will almost
[53:20] always go to immoral
[53:23] Behavior because they're taught to do do
[53:26] whatever when a child's growing up and
[53:28] you don't discipline that child he's
[53:31] always taught to do whatever feels good
[53:33] do whatever you like to do and Satan's
[53:35] right there and he has this attraction
[53:38] and he draws these children and if they
[53:41] don't have if they didn't grow up with
[53:44] parents that had rules and discipline
[53:46] them then they will almost always go
[53:49] towards sin almost
[53:54] always furthermore
[53:57] we have had fathers of our flesh which
[53:59] corrected us and we gave them reverence
[54:01] shall we not much rather be in
[54:03] subjection under the father of spirits
[54:05] and
[54:06] live so we had all of us have dads that
[54:10] that gave us correction and mothers that
[54:12] gave us
[54:13] correction but shall much much more
[54:16] rather shall we be in subjection to the
[54:19] father of spirits and live so so being
[54:22] in subjection to God and remember when
[54:24] when uh tell a story about Daniel
[54:27] where's my boy at where's there he is so
[54:30] we had
[54:31] moved and uh we're in this this house
[54:35] and and Daniel I don't know he's like
[54:37] four or
[54:38] five and uh my wife reminded me of it
[54:41] this morning that's why I'm thinking
[54:43] about it so Daniel um he gets in he and
[54:46] his friend get into our
[54:48] bedroom and they get into
[54:51] Stephanie's jewelry
[54:54] box and they proceeded to flush all of
[54:57] her jewelry down the
[55:02] toilet I guess he was a step ahead the
[55:04] woman shall Adorn herself in modest
[55:05] apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety
[55:07] not with gold or pearls or costly
[55:09] array I don't think that was his purpose
[55:12] in doing it but the but the boy needed
[55:14] to be chastened he needed to be
[55:17] corrected I wanted to kill
[55:21] him not kill him just maim him that that
[55:25] he will always remember remember what he
[55:27] did but it required correction what if I
[55:31] would have just said oh you know it's
[55:32] okay it's okay buddy he needed I don't
[55:36] remember if I spanked him or not I know
[55:37] I wanted to but I know that it said
[55:43] Daniel this is mom's
[55:46] stuff buddy you you you ruined it you
[55:49] lost it you you know how much money that
[55:51] cost
[55:52] me so then Stephanie this morning she
[55:55] has a little charm and she says I used
[55:56] to have a blue
[55:58] one I knew where she was going with it
[56:01] didn't you
[56:03] honey and she told me do you remember
[56:05] where the first one went I said
[56:07] yeah Jeffersonville
[56:12] sewer we need to correct our
[56:14] children we need to show them what is
[56:17] right we need there has to be
[56:20] chastisement there or they will it's
[56:24] human nature will go towards sin
[56:27] furthermore we have had Fathers as I
[56:29] just read of our flesh with flesh with
[56:31] corrected us and we gave them reverence
[56:33] shall we not much rather be in
[56:35] subjection under the father of the of
[56:37] spirits and live for verily for a few
[56:41] days chastened us after their own
[56:44] pleasure but he for our
[56:46] profit that we might be partakers of his
[56:49] Holiness I know it's difficult to
[56:50] understand more modern translation says
[56:52] this for they meaning our Earthly
[56:55] fathers dis disciplined us for a short
[56:57] time as it seemed best to them but he
[57:01] disciplines us for our
[57:03] good that we may share in his
[57:07] Holiness now no chastening for the
[57:10] present seem to be joyous but Grievous
[57:13] sure Daniel was not enjoying what
[57:16] happened after he flushed the
[57:19] jewelry but it was for his own good but
[57:22] he for our
[57:24] Prophet I'm sorry now
[57:27] chastening for the present seem to seeth
[57:30] to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless
[57:33] afterward yith the Peaceable fruit of
[57:35] righteousness unto them which are
[57:38] exercised thereby let me let me read
[57:40] another translation for the moment all
[57:43] discipline for the moment all discipline
[57:45] seems to be painful rather than pleasant
[57:48] but later it yields the peaceful fruit
[57:50] of righteousness to those who have been
[57:53] trained by it where therefore lift up
[57:56] the hands which hang down and the feeble
[57:58] knees and make straight paths for your
[58:01] feet lest that which is lame be turned
[58:04] out of the way but let it rather be
[58:06] healed so if if you break a
[58:10] bone and it's out of place that bone
[58:13] needs to be set right so it can heal and
[58:17] move in the right direction otherwise
[58:19] it's going to be deformed there's going
[58:20] to be a problem there but when we make
[58:23] mistakes we need to go back and we need
[58:25] to set those right so after that then we
[58:28] can continue on James says therefore
[58:32] confess your sins one to another so if
[58:34] we've done wrong set that bone confess
[58:37] your sins one to another and pray one
[58:39] for another that you may be
[58:41] healed the effectual fervent prayer of a
[58:44] righteous man avails much it has great
[58:47] power in it's working so when we take
[58:50] communion and there's sin there and
[58:53] there's Discord Among Us the Bible says
[58:56] for this cause many are sick and weakly
[59:00] among you and many are
[59:03] dead and they died
[59:06] needlessly if we would be where we're
[59:08] supposed to be with the sin set aside
[59:11] and these these weights that we have off
[59:13] of
[59:15] us then we would see more of the
[59:19] blessings of God but it's our own fault
[59:20] that we don't see more of his blessings
[59:23] we're always saying brother this is
[59:24] going to happen and that's going to
[59:25] happen the earthquake is going to be
[59:26] over here and this is going to be over
[59:28] here and then we're going to just speak
[59:29] the word brother and then we're going to
[59:30] speak worlds in existence wait a minute
[59:32] but you're lying right now you're
[59:35] sinning right
[59:37] now how can God bless
[59:41] that how can God give us this if we are
[59:44] not doing what we should be
[59:47] doing follow peace with all
[59:50] men and Holiness without which no man
[59:54] shall see the Lord it means strive for
[59:58] peace strive for peace with
[1:00:01] everyone and for the Holiness without
[1:00:04] which no one will see the Lord so there
[1:00:07] is a Holiness
[1:00:08] associated with serving the lord there
[1:00:11] is a Holiness associated with salvation
[1:00:14] looking diligently lest any man fail of
[1:00:17] the grace of God lest any root of
[1:00:20] bitterness spring up any root of
[1:00:23] bitterness springing up trouble you and
[1:00:25] their five therefore many be defiled so
[1:00:28] the author is saying that this root of
[1:00:30] bitterness between you this Strife this
[1:00:33] fighting it's
[1:00:35] sin you know we think of sin as as
[1:00:39] infidelity or or or lying or or doing
[1:00:42] those but but Strife between
[1:00:47] Brethren that's
[1:00:50] sin I look at the love having this
[1:00:56] cross behind
[1:00:58] me as I
[1:01:00] preach you look at that cross and you
[1:01:02] look at how many victories were won on
[1:01:05] the
[1:01:07] cross we all know Jesus conquered death
[1:01:10] hell on the grave he
[1:01:13] conquered
[1:01:15] hell death he went
[1:01:18] down after he
[1:01:21] died made atonement for those that were
[1:01:25] waiting and then he took his own life
[1:01:27] and raised it up let me give you a
[1:01:30] victory on the cross that you may not
[1:01:32] have you may not think about very much
[1:01:35] when
[1:01:37] Jesus during his ministry he was
[1:01:41] hated you know that a lot of times
[1:01:43] people will talk about
[1:01:45] us and maybe we can handle it some of us
[1:01:48] can't when somebody criticizes you or or
[1:01:52] um says maybe something false about you
[1:01:55] or maybe says something true about you
[1:01:57] that really gets to you but what about
[1:01:59] if someone criticizes your children or
[1:02:02] criticizes your
[1:02:04] mother I told Jesus that his mother
[1:02:08] slept with a Roman soldier Romans were
[1:02:12] unclean according to the Jewish beliefs
[1:02:14] they were they were filthy filthy they
[1:02:16] many times they couldn't even touch a
[1:02:18] Roman telling him his mother had an
[1:02:22] affair and he was the product of this
[1:02:23] affair imagine how that would make you
[1:02:25] feel
[1:02:26] put yourself in that
[1:02:28] situation this
[1:02:30] insults and then as time went on more
[1:02:33] insults calling him all of these lies
[1:02:35] saying that he was a worshipper of the
[1:02:37] devil and and saying that he did these
[1:02:38] Miracles by the devil and he's just
[1:02:41] going on and doing the best that he can
[1:02:43] and then finally they they bring him to
[1:02:46] the Cross they bring him to the trial
[1:02:49] condemn him to death he carries the
[1:02:52] cross through
[1:02:53] Jerusalem carries his own
[1:02:56] instrument of death they lay him down on
[1:02:59] there nail him to this cross and they
[1:03:01] put him up if I be lifted
[1:03:04] up I will draw all men to me there he
[1:03:07] was lifted up in front of the
[1:03:12] people and I want to I want to tell you
[1:03:14] a victory that he gave and I want
[1:03:17] everyone here some struggle with it more
[1:03:21] than others but I want everyone here to
[1:03:24] think of someone
[1:03:26] or something that has bothered you that
[1:03:29] you hold against
[1:03:31] someone Jesus was there none of us have
[1:03:34] been done as wrong as him and what were
[1:03:36] his words father forgive
[1:03:40] them Father forgive them for they know
[1:03:44] not what they do imagine us let me tell
[1:03:48] you something if someone does you
[1:03:51] wrong if someone hurts you talks about
[1:03:54] your children
[1:03:57] if you want
[1:03:58] Victory get on your knees and pray for
[1:04:02] that person
[1:04:04] wow that's the victory he
[1:04:07] won there as I said there were many
[1:04:09] victories on the cross but imagine he
[1:04:11] won that Victory Satan was there saying
[1:04:14] speak against them have thoughts in your
[1:04:17] mind against them hate
[1:04:21] them and if we have the spirit of
[1:04:24] Christ we pray pray for those
[1:04:27] people as Jesus said in the Beatitudes
[1:04:30] in the on The Sermon on the Mount pray
[1:04:32] for those which despitefully use
[1:04:36] you do we do
[1:04:38] it I will give you advice if you do it
[1:04:42] you will get the
[1:04:43] victory you will be
[1:04:45] amazed get on your knees enter into that
[1:04:49] person's suffering whatever that person
[1:04:51] may be that person that did you wrong
[1:04:53] and pray for that person
[1:04:57] loving that
[1:04:58] person and then you will have the
[1:05:01] victory so you think I forgive them so
[1:05:04] who got the victory do you think it was
[1:05:06] the person that Did You Wrong got the
[1:05:07] victory no you don't get the victory you
[1:05:10] get the victory because you overcame it
[1:05:13] now you raised yourself higher then the
[1:05:15] Bible says that when you do
[1:05:18] that you pour heaping coals upon their
[1:05:23] head you don't want to do that that's
[1:05:26] not why it's like well I'm going to
[1:05:28] forgive them so they have coals dumped
[1:05:30] on their head no that's not that's not
[1:05:33] that's not the right it's not the right
[1:05:35] way of
[1:05:36] thinking but God instructs us he says
[1:05:40] listen there's one thing that's for me
[1:05:43] and this is God speaking God the father
[1:05:45] he says vengeance is
[1:05:48] mine you don't do it you don't fight it
[1:05:52] out
[1:05:53] vengeance is from me I take care of that
[1:05:57] Romans 12 it says dearly beloved avenge
[1:05:59] not yourself but rather give Place unto
[1:06:03] wrath leave to wrath leave it to the
[1:06:06] wrath of God for it is written vengeance
[1:06:09] is mine I will repay sayeth the Lord
[1:06:12] therefore if thine enemy hunger thine
[1:06:14] enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give
[1:06:18] him drink for in so doing Thou shalt
[1:06:20] Heap coals of fire on his head but be
[1:06:23] not overcome of evil
[1:06:26] but overcome evil with good sometimes
[1:06:28] it's a little bit by a little bit
[1:06:30] sometimes it's harder for some people to
[1:06:32] do it than others a little bit in a
[1:06:36] little bit and then finally you'll say
[1:06:39] oh I have victory over
[1:06:41] it back to Hebrews
[1:06:45] 12 lest there be any fornicator or
[1:06:47] profane person as Esau for one for who
[1:06:51] one who for one morsel of meat sold his
[1:06:54] Birthright for you know how afterward
[1:06:57] when he would have inherited the
[1:06:58] blessing he was rejected for he found no
[1:07:01] place of repentance though he sought it
[1:07:03] carefully with
[1:07:05] tears another translation says verse
[1:07:08] number 16 that no one is sexually
[1:07:10] immoral or Unholy like Esau who sold his
[1:07:15] Birthright after a single meal for you
[1:07:17] know that afterward he desired to
[1:07:19] inherit the blessing he was rejected for
[1:07:22] he found no chance to repent though he s
[1:07:25] sought it with tears so we look at Esau
[1:07:27] and Jacob we know the story of them if
[1:07:29] you've been coming to our Bible studies
[1:07:30] you know in Genesis we talked about
[1:07:33] really the fathers of the faith and
[1:07:34] Jacob was that so you have Esau and
[1:07:36] Jacob they're twins they came out of the
[1:07:38] womb fighting Esau came out first he was
[1:07:41] the first born Jacob had a hold of his
[1:07:43] foot his
[1:07:45] eel and then they came out and they they
[1:07:47] didn't get along their whole lives so
[1:07:50] but Esau had the birthright he had the
[1:07:54] blessing of his father remember what we
[1:07:56] talked about last week that we can bless
[1:07:58] our children and Esau blessed his
[1:08:01] children
[1:08:03] so Esau was hungry he didn't really
[1:08:07] care necessarily about serving the lord
[1:08:11] but he was by if you outward look Esau
[1:08:14] was a better man he was a better son to
[1:08:17] his father he was maybe a harder
[1:08:20] worker he was somebody brothers and
[1:08:23] sisters he was the person that maybe we
[1:08:25] would elect as a pastor of a church or
[1:08:28] as as a leader because he looked more of
[1:08:31] the part and he maybe could talk more of
[1:08:33] the part but God chose Jacob because
[1:08:36] Jacob he had more of a reverence for
[1:08:40] God's word he had a more of a reverence
[1:08:42] for God so Esau's hungry you know the
[1:08:45] story he comes in Jacob makes this
[1:08:48] pottage this this bowl of
[1:08:51] stew and he says give me some of that
[1:08:53] I'm starving I feel like I'm going to
[1:08:54] die and he's and and Jacob says sell me
[1:08:58] the
[1:09:00] birthright and I'll give you some Esau
[1:09:03] didn't
[1:09:04] care about the
[1:09:06] birthright that really wasn't in him to
[1:09:09] have that reverence for
[1:09:11] God he says whatever didn't think much
[1:09:14] of it whatever take it yeah yeah sure
[1:09:17] just give me something to
[1:09:20] eat God was looking down at that moment
[1:09:24] and he saw that decision by
[1:09:27] Esau be careful whatever you say
[1:09:33] whatever decision you make whatever
[1:09:35] Covenant you enter
[1:09:36] into because that was that Covenant
[1:09:40] right there and it was a b it was over a
[1:09:41] bowl of soup and he didn't even think
[1:09:43] about it it wasn't important to him but
[1:09:45] God saw
[1:09:47] it it might be an engagement to a boy or
[1:09:51] a girl it might be a a a a business deal
[1:09:55] It Whatever It Is be careful with what
[1:09:59] you say be careful with what you do
[1:10:01] because God is looking down and it may
[1:10:04] be a covenant like this was so then
[1:10:07] later
[1:10:10] on Isaac their dad is ready to give the
[1:10:15] blessings and he was going to bless his
[1:10:18] firstborn prophet of
[1:10:21] God so Jacob comes and he deceives his
[1:10:25] dad Esau was a hairy guy so he put the
[1:10:28] goat the piece of goat hide on his on
[1:10:31] his
[1:10:32] arm he makes his dad some
[1:10:36] food and his dad can't see his dad's
[1:10:39] blind he comes in and he says who who
[1:10:42] are you and he says I'm I'm Esau and
[1:10:45] he's like man you sound like
[1:10:47] Jacob and he's like nope I'm Esau here
[1:10:50] feel my hairy
[1:10:53] arm said
[1:10:56] comes in
[1:10:59] and Isaac says
[1:11:01] okay and it was time for his Blessing
[1:11:04] Isaac's time was coming to an end he
[1:11:06] lays his
[1:11:07] hand on his son Esau and gives him the
[1:11:10] blessing of the
[1:11:12] firstborn he lays lays his hand on Jacob
[1:11:15] and gives him the blessing of the
[1:11:16] firstborn Esau so then Esau comes in a
[1:11:19] little bit later who was going out to
[1:11:21] get to kill a deer so he could make it
[1:11:24] for his dad his favorite meal and he
[1:11:26] comes in and the dad was like wait a
[1:11:30] minute you sound like
[1:11:33] Esau and he says yeah Dad bless me he
[1:11:36] says no I already blessed your
[1:11:38] brother he said he tricked me but God
[1:11:42] had already seen the Covenant
[1:11:46] before Isaac was in the perfect will of
[1:11:49] the Lord when he blessed
[1:11:51] Jacob he blessed Jacob because they had
[1:11:54] all God knew he they had already made
[1:11:56] that deal earlier Esau had already given
[1:11:59] up the birth right so now he blesses
[1:12:03] Jacob they call it the stolen blessing
[1:12:06] wasn't the it was it was the deal that
[1:12:09] they made Jacob Esau didn't
[1:12:13] care we should always brothers and
[1:12:15] sisters everything that we do take great
[1:12:18] care take great care in every decision
[1:12:21] that you make take great care in
[1:12:22] everything that you say because God is
[1:12:27] watching let's continue on well let me
[1:12:29] let me let me stop there for a minute
[1:12:31] you notice he puts in the same in the
[1:12:34] same sentence he puts J Esau who
[1:12:39] despised the birthright didn't care
[1:12:40] about the birthright and then immoral
[1:12:43] sexually immorally
[1:12:45] living and puts Esau right there you
[1:12:48] know
[1:12:49] Esau as I said he didn't care much about
[1:12:52] the birthright he didn't care much about
[1:12:54] about serving the lord so what he did he
[1:12:58] goes and he marries a worldly
[1:13:02] girl broke his parents'
[1:13:05] heart he marries these girls they his
[1:13:08] polygamy was back then he marries them
[1:13:11] the Canaanite women the idol
[1:13:14] worshippers and it it just destroyed him
[1:13:18] he didn't listen to Mom and
[1:13:21] Dad there's a reason for you kids
[1:13:23] there's a reason mom and dad are trying
[1:13:25] to get you to
[1:13:27] be with good Christian boys and
[1:13:32] girls it's because we see just like
[1:13:35] Isaac and Rebecca we see that your life
[1:13:40] could be
[1:13:41] ruined don't despise that Birthright
[1:13:44] don't despise what the Lord has done for
[1:13:46] you and
[1:13:47] don't run with the
[1:13:49] world don't go after the worldly
[1:13:53] things go after the things of
[1:13:56] god let's continue on verse number 18
[1:14:02] for you're not come under the
[1:14:04] mountain for ye are not come unto the
[1:14:06] mount that might be touched and that
[1:14:08] burned burned with fire nor unto
[1:14:12] Blackness and darkness and Tempest and
[1:14:14] the sound of the trumpet and the words
[1:14:16] and the voice of Words which which voice
[1:14:19] they that heard entreated that the word
[1:14:23] should not be spoken to them anymore for
[1:14:26] they could not endure that which was
[1:14:28] commanded and if so much as a beast
[1:14:30] touch the mountain it shall be stoned or
[1:14:33] thrust through with a dart and so
[1:14:35] terrible was the sight that Moses said I
[1:14:37] exceedingly fear and Quake so you know
[1:14:39] what he's talking about here he's
[1:14:40] talking about the time that Moses got
[1:14:42] the people together he said consecrate
[1:14:44] yourself because we are going to meet
[1:14:46] the Lord so they go to the foot of Mount
[1:14:48] Si and the the rule was that no not a
[1:14:52] beast not a man anything can touch this
[1:14:55] mountain and the the lights were going
[1:14:57] off and the fire was going off and the
[1:14:59] Thunder was going off and it was a it
[1:15:00] was a it was a terribly frightening
[1:15:03] experience and the people go up there
[1:15:05] and they're like whoa this is this is
[1:15:08] way more than we thought it would be we
[1:15:10] don't we don't want this because if
[1:15:12] God's going to speak and they saw all
[1:15:13] their sins they said we're going to die
[1:15:16] they said let Moses speak and not
[1:15:20] God God says
[1:15:23] okay and that fear of God was in the
[1:15:26] people but
[1:15:28] remember that fear of God will
[1:15:32] fade and the next thing we know they
[1:15:35] build a golden calf Moses leaves for a
[1:15:37] while they build a golden calf they they
[1:15:40] throw all their jewelry in there and and
[1:15:43] and Aaron Aaron builds this Idol and
[1:15:46] they're living worldly they're they're
[1:15:48] they're living like they're living
[1:15:50] terrible sinful lives and this was not
[1:15:53] too long after they had just come to
[1:15:55] that mountain and saw the power of God
[1:15:57] and were scared to
[1:15:59] death the be the fear of God as the
[1:16:03] Bible says is the beginning of
[1:16:07] wisdom that's just the start of it but
[1:16:10] there's more and here's what that more
[1:16:15] is but ye but you so they
[1:16:20] went to this other Mount Si but you are
[1:16:24] come to Mount
[1:16:26] Zion and under the city of the Living
[1:16:29] God the heavenly Jerusalem and to
[1:16:31] innumerable company of angels to the
[1:16:34] general assembly and the Church of the
[1:16:35] firstborn which are written in heaven
[1:16:38] and and to God and to the judge of all
[1:16:41] and to the spirits of just men made
[1:16:43] perfect so this is not all just Christ
[1:16:46] that's the firstborn when you are born
[1:16:49] reborn when you have that new birth and
[1:16:52] you are filled with the Holy Spirit now
[1:16:54] you are the firstborn of
[1:16:57] God you are born to
[1:17:00] him you are his son you are his daughter
[1:17:04] how many times have we heard brother
[1:17:06] brandom say that God doesn't have
[1:17:09] grandchildren and that's the same with
[1:17:11] this you are not there is no no one in
[1:17:14] between you and Christ it is you and him
[1:17:18] and when you are reborn now you come to
[1:17:21] Mount Zion now remember Abel from the
[1:17:23] last service remember when abble when
[1:17:25] his voice cried out from the blood to
[1:17:30] God there was such Faith there that even
[1:17:33] in his death and and and his blood
[1:17:35] poured out on the ground it was crying
[1:17:37] out to God but what was it crying out
[1:17:40] for he was crying out for
[1:17:43] justice but now through the cross and
[1:17:47] that blood that poured out from the
[1:17:49] cross and came out on the ground that
[1:17:52] blood is no longer crying for justice
[1:17:54] jce for us that blood now is crying out
[1:17:58] for Mercy for
[1:18:00] us is a different
[1:18:04] Covenant and to Jesus the meteor of the
[1:18:07] New Covenant and to and to the blood of
[1:18:10] the sprinkling that speaketh better
[1:18:12] things than that of Abel remember Abel
[1:18:15] wanted
[1:18:16] Justice
[1:18:18] Christ is
[1:18:22] Grace whose voice then sh shook the
[1:18:25] Earth remember the
[1:18:26] mountain I'm coming to the mountain but
[1:18:30] now he hath promised saying yet once
[1:18:32] more I shake not the Earth only but also
[1:18:36] heaven and this word yet once more
[1:18:39] signifieth the removing of those things
[1:18:41] that are shaken and of the things that
[1:18:43] are made and those things which cannot
[1:18:45] be shaken May remain wherefore we
[1:18:48] receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[1:18:49] moved let us have Grace whereby we may
[1:18:52] serve God acceptably with reverence and
[1:18:55] godly fear for our God is a consuming
[1:19:00] fire so even though that blood that was
[1:19:02] spilled out on the ground from Christ it
[1:19:05] is crying out for grace and crying out
[1:19:08] for
[1:19:09] Mercy our God is the same
[1:19:14] God and just because we have Grace and
[1:19:17] just because we have mercy doesn't mean
[1:19:20] that we can sin we're going to sin we're
[1:19:23] going to make mistakes
[1:19:26] but the author is talking about before
[1:19:29] chastising his children so we'll suffer
[1:19:32] for everything that we do every mistake
[1:19:34] that we make and I want to suffer here
[1:19:36] on Earth because I don't want to suffer
[1:19:38] on the other
[1:19:40] side Hebrews 13 now the author he's
[1:19:44] closing this letter and he wants to give
[1:19:46] instructions to the people remember he's
[1:19:48] gone through a lengthy
[1:19:51] dissertation on bringing Christ out of
[1:19:53] the Old Testament making him higher than
[1:19:56] the prophets higher than the angels and
[1:19:58] replacing that sacrificial lamb with
[1:20:00] Jesus and and he's he's told the people
[1:20:05] that there is a better way than what you
[1:20:08] have done you did the best that you
[1:20:10] could but now there is a New Covenant
[1:20:16] that's better than the old one so before
[1:20:19] it was you came to the priest you
[1:20:21] offered a sacrifice for your sins and it
[1:20:23] stayed the WRA of God that was the Old
[1:20:27] Testament the old Covenant but then when
[1:20:31] Christ came there was a New Covenant a
[1:20:34] new testament and that's why we have our
[1:20:38] separation between the two
[1:20:40] books this is after Christ has come in
[1:20:44] the book of Hebrews over and over it
[1:20:45] says it's a better
[1:20:47] way and what does he say in his closing
[1:20:50] statements he wants us he wants to leave
[1:20:52] us with something very important he says
[1:20:54] let brother Brotherly Love
[1:20:55] continue be not forgetful to entertain
[1:20:58] strangers for thereby some have
[1:20:59] entertained angels unaware I have a few
[1:21:02] minutes I'll tell I'll tell a story I
[1:21:04] believe I saw an angel one time I was a
[1:21:07] young man I was a boy Adam how old are
[1:21:10] you yeah 13 I was like two years younger
[1:21:14] than you and I um was hunting with my
[1:21:18] dad and I just loved to go hunting I
[1:21:23] thought I mean it was just my mind my my
[1:21:25] heart everything was always wanting to
[1:21:27] be in the woods and and I always just
[1:21:29] longed to go elk hunting so what I did
[1:21:33] is I read the I got a hold of the
[1:21:35] sporting good store I got a hold of the
[1:21:37] the regulations and I read cover to
[1:21:40] cover and I was able to get a check from
[1:21:42] Mom and Dad and um put us in for the
[1:21:45] lottery for going elk hunting while we
[1:21:47] got drawn me and my dad and a couple
[1:21:51] others so we go up there and I'm just
[1:21:54] I'm just a kid and it's uh cold and it's
[1:22:01] snowing
[1:22:03] and we're out hunting and I got
[1:22:06] separated from my dad they had shot an
[1:22:09] elk and I wandered off and then I saw
[1:22:11] some elk running out in the distance so
[1:22:14] I go after them and now I'm this little
[1:22:17] boy in this snowstorm freezing cold and
[1:22:21] I'm not thinking of anything but killing
[1:22:22] one of those elk so
[1:22:25] one stops and I lay down as my dad had
[1:22:28] taught me and I shoot the
[1:22:31] thing and I walked up to it and I'm just
[1:22:34] smaller than Adam I'm this little
[1:22:37] guy and I go up there and I was like oh
[1:22:40] I remember dad dragging it back um with
[1:22:42] a deer so I I couldn't even lift the
[1:22:44] head of the thing I'm like man what am I
[1:22:47] going to do so I get my backpack and I
[1:22:49] get my knife out I was like okay I can
[1:22:51] do this remember watching dad do it so
[1:22:55] I'm looking at the
[1:22:56] thing pouring down snow can't see from
[1:23:01] me to you Harley Manny I just it was
[1:23:03] just a blizzard condition and I'm
[1:23:08] like okay and Out of the Woods out of a
[1:23:12] blizzard comes a man he walks up to me
[1:23:17] and he says uh he says nice one and I
[1:23:20] said I said
[1:23:22] yeah I shot it
[1:23:27] and he
[1:23:29] says he says you know what you're going
[1:23:31] to do now and I was like yep I'm GNA gut
[1:23:34] it and he said you need some help I said
[1:23:37] yes
[1:23:38] sir so he helped me get through cleaning
[1:23:42] this
[1:23:43] elk again it's snowing and cold
[1:23:47] and and then uh we got about finished he
[1:23:50] says okay he says you can finish from
[1:23:52] here on out I'll see
[1:23:55] and he walks back into the blizzard and
[1:23:58] into the
[1:24:01] forest so finally after an hour or so I
[1:24:05] get in my backpack and I had this orange
[1:24:07] Poncho and uh I set up a little Camp
[1:24:10] there and and um it clears up and then I
[1:24:14] see my dad over across the meadow a
[1:24:16] couple hundred yards away and he sees my
[1:24:18] orange Poncho and he comes and and he
[1:24:21] says wow buddy you really good job he
[1:24:26] says you did all that I said
[1:24:29] yep
[1:24:31] lied
[1:24:33] um and I felt bad but then my dad goes
[1:24:36] and tells everybody that yeah my son 11
[1:24:39] years old he he goes out and he kills
[1:24:41] his elk he gutted it himself and cleaned
[1:24:43] it and got everything ready and I was
[1:24:45] like man I can't confess
[1:24:47] now so years went on decades actually
[1:24:51] went by I never told that
[1:24:54] but I really
[1:24:57] believe that that was an angel that came
[1:25:00] out of the woods may it may not have
[1:25:03] been I mean it may have been just
[1:25:05] another Hunter he didn't have a gun he
[1:25:06] didn't have a knife it may have been
[1:25:07] another hunter that came out of the
[1:25:10] woods in the middle of nowhere in a
[1:25:12] snowstorm and and helped me a
[1:25:15] 11-year-old boy and uh then walked back
[1:25:19] into the snowstorm and left this
[1:25:21] 11-year-old boy by himself in a blizzard
[1:25:24] it could have been that but I don't
[1:25:26] think it
[1:25:28] was
[1:25:31] we entertain Angels not knowing that
[1:25:34] they are
[1:25:35] angels let's continue on and finish
[1:25:38] remember them that are in bonds as bound
[1:25:41] with them and them which suffer
[1:25:43] adversity as being yourselves also in
[1:25:46] the body put yourselves brothers and
[1:25:48] sisters all of us either have family
[1:25:50] members or we know people that are in
[1:25:52] prison or there's people here that have
[1:25:54] been in
[1:25:55] prison how much does it mean to you when
[1:25:57] somebody visits how much does it mean
[1:25:59] when you get a
[1:26:00] letter how much does it mean when you
[1:26:03] have contact from the outside it's very
[1:26:05] very important don't neglect those
[1:26:09] people as if you were in
[1:26:15] prison let me let me read um Jesus said
[1:26:18] this Matthew 25 he said when the son of
[1:26:20] man comes in his glory and all the Holy
[1:26:22] Angels with him then he will sit on the
[1:26:25] throne of his glory all the nations will
[1:26:27] be gathered before him and he will
[1:26:29] separate them one from another as the
[1:26:31] she Shepherd divides his sheep from the
[1:26:33] goats and he will set the sheep on his
[1:26:35] right hand but the goats on his left
[1:26:39] then the king will say to those on his
[1:26:41] right hand Come Ye blessed of my father
[1:26:44] inherit the Kingdom prepared for you
[1:26:46] from the foundation of the world for I
[1:26:48] was hungry and you gave me
[1:26:50] food I was thirsty and you gave me drink
[1:26:54] I was a stranger and you took me in I
[1:26:57] was naked and you clothed me I was sick
[1:26:59] and you visited me I was in prison and
[1:27:02] you came to
[1:27:04] me and we know the story they say when
[1:27:06] did we ever do that and he says in so
[1:27:09] much as you have done it unto these the
[1:27:11] least of these you've done it to me so
[1:27:14] don't neglect those that are in
[1:27:18] need the musicians can come and we'll
[1:27:21] finish marriage is Honorable in all and
[1:27:24] the bed undefiled but hor mongers and
[1:27:27] adulterers God will judge he's saying
[1:27:29] here that keep the marital relations
[1:27:32] between a husband and a a wife God
[1:27:34] allows
[1:27:36] that but keep it
[1:27:39] holy make sure if you are married that
[1:27:43] your relations are with your
[1:27:46] spouse don't bring pornography into your
[1:27:50] home have upright with your spouse
[1:27:54] and and love your
[1:27:58] spouse and then if you are not married
[1:28:02] you live a celibate
[1:28:05] life there is no brothers and sisters it
[1:28:08] is very very plain here that there is no
[1:28:11] sex outside of marriage we don't say
[1:28:13] that enough too too much too often we
[1:28:16] are telling our children you're bride
[1:28:19] and you're special and and you're gonna
[1:28:21] do all these things and we're just
[1:28:22] waiting for the coming of the Lord and
[1:28:24] he's going to call his bride and you're
[1:28:26] different and we don't teach him about
[1:28:27] this Morality In our
[1:28:30] homes and then they go and it causes
[1:28:32] them to
[1:28:33] sin and then they
[1:28:36] fail it needs to be taught I know it's
[1:28:38] an uncomfortable subject but we need to
[1:28:42] understand that our children need to
[1:28:43] understand live a clean moral
[1:28:47] life and
[1:28:49] marriage is before
[1:28:53] God it is a wonderful thing but honor
[1:28:57] it and as he's saying here the bedroom
[1:29:00] is undefiled don't bring sin into your
[1:29:04] house you
[1:29:06] men not that of course you're not going
[1:29:09] to have an affair with a woman but don't
[1:29:10] even want to have an affair with another
[1:29:12] woman Jesus said that if you look up a
[1:29:16] if you look on a woman and you want to
[1:29:19] have that then you are
[1:29:20] guilty of that make sure that that
[1:29:25] home is undefiled that bedroom is
[1:29:28] undefiled I need five more minutes
[1:29:30] before we
[1:29:32] start let your conversation be without
[1:29:35] Covetous and be content with such things
[1:29:38] as you have said as you have for he hath
[1:29:41] said I will never leave thee nor forsake
[1:29:44] thee so that we may boldly say the Lord
[1:29:47] is my helper and I will not fear what
[1:29:50] man shall do unto me remember them which
[1:29:53] have rule over over you who have spoken
[1:29:55] unto you the word of God whose Faith
[1:29:57] follow consider the end of their
[1:29:59] conversation another translation says
[1:30:01] remember your leaders those who spoke to
[1:30:04] you the word of God consider the outcome
[1:30:06] of their life of their way of life and
[1:30:09] imitate their faith I believe the author
[1:30:12] is talking about pastors in the ministry
[1:30:15] I believe that that's why it's so
[1:30:16] important for a pastor to live a life
[1:30:19] that is worthy of the Gospel not try to
[1:30:22] control the people not try to beat down
[1:30:23] the people people but be an example to
[1:30:25] the people so that the people want to
[1:30:27] imitate your way of life to to see that
[1:30:31] love that comes from the pulpit that's
[1:30:33] the
[1:30:34] representation but he's also I believe
[1:30:37] he's also talking about those that teach
[1:30:40] your
[1:30:41] children they should want to be like
[1:30:44] their
[1:30:45] parents our children should want to be
[1:30:48] like us because we have set that word
[1:30:50] before him and then we have acted upon
[1:30:52] that word we need to be
[1:30:55] examples a as Christians as
[1:30:59] Believers the way that we win people to
[1:31:02] the Lord is we have a good
[1:31:05] representation of Jesus Christ so that
[1:31:07] people want to be like us instead we try
[1:31:11] to separate and separate and
[1:31:13] separate and what good does that
[1:31:16] do we should live a life that is full of
[1:31:20] love full of kindness and compassion and
[1:31:24] giving so that people look to us as
[1:31:28] being someone that they want to imitate
[1:31:30] as the as the Bible says sister
[1:31:33] Priscilla was telling me um about uh I
[1:31:37] don't know if it's her brother or her
[1:31:39] brother-in-law but she said that he gave
[1:31:41] his heart to the Lord and he said that
[1:31:44] everybody just loved him so much and he
[1:31:46] was such an important part of their
[1:31:48] family and the kids just really looked
[1:31:51] up to him because he loved him so much
[1:31:53] and he would talk about the
[1:31:55] Lord they wanted to imitate him he was a
[1:31:58] very very important part in their life
[1:32:00] because they knew he loved
[1:32:03] them Jesus
[1:32:05] Christ the same
[1:32:08] yesterday and today and
[1:32:11] forever our most common scripture that
[1:32:13] we all know brother brandom's theme
[1:32:17] scripture and it's talking about setting
[1:32:20] an example this Jesus Christ that
[1:32:22] manifested it in these Hebrew Hebrew
[1:32:25] these um Heroes of Faith in in chapter
[1:32:27] 11 should be the same Jesus Christ
[1:32:30] that's here today doing the same
[1:32:32] thing and how do you do it you live that
[1:32:35] life you you put God first in everything
[1:32:37] take off those weights and run the
[1:32:42] race be not carried about the divers and
[1:32:45] strange doctrines for it is good a good
[1:32:48] thing that the heart be established with
[1:32:49] Grace not with Meats which have not
[1:32:51] profited them that have been occupied
[1:32:55] therein he's talking about legalism
[1:32:57] these
[1:32:58] doctrines the way that you will
[1:33:01] recognize a strange Doctrine brothers
[1:33:03] and sisters is when it points
[1:33:07] you to himself the man or if it points
[1:33:11] you to a special Revelation that they
[1:33:14] have instead of pointing you to
[1:33:17] Christ read your
[1:33:19] Bible everything in this book from
[1:33:22] Matthew through Revelation everything
[1:33:25] points us to
[1:33:28] Christ and if these doctrines come in
[1:33:31] whether be our church or wherever and
[1:33:33] it's something that pointing you to some
[1:33:35] new revelation or something that's
[1:33:37] different and it's not lifting up Christ
[1:33:39] before you if it's lifting up a man or
[1:33:41] or or some other Doctrine then it is
[1:33:45] false be careful we are constantly
[1:33:48] warned of false Doctrine and false
[1:33:51] teachers and they're trying to Domin at
[1:33:54] the people they're trying to control the
[1:33:56] people and it's really
[1:34:00] easy is this does this book line up does
[1:34:04] their Doctrine line up with this book or
[1:34:07] is it something new or is it something
[1:34:09] different it's got to line up
[1:34:13] there and if you know your Bible you
[1:34:16] have to to discern the truth from a lie
[1:34:19] you got to know the truth
[1:34:21] first it's important to know the book
[1:34:25] it's important to read it it's important
[1:34:27] to understand it if you have trouble
[1:34:29] with the King James get another
[1:34:32] translation it doesn't do you any good
[1:34:34] if you can't understand
[1:34:36] it and let the Holy Spirit lead
[1:34:39] you as you read
[1:34:42] it you have to know the truth before you
[1:34:45] can
[1:34:46] discern the truth from
[1:34:49] falsehood let's skip to uh verse 17
[1:34:53] obey them that have rule over you and
[1:34:55] submit yourselves for they watch over
[1:34:57] your souls as they must give
[1:35:01] account that they may do it with joy and
[1:35:03] not with grief for that is unprofitable
[1:35:07] to
[1:35:14] you brothers and sisters as I
[1:35:20] said every man every Minister will give
[1:35:23] an account of what he
[1:35:25] preaches and if he is
[1:35:28] trying to fill a church if he's trying
[1:35:31] to control the people or if he's trying
[1:35:33] to be if he's a minister for money or
[1:35:35] for popularity or for influence or
[1:35:37] whatever it will
[1:35:40] fail but if that minister is trying to
[1:35:43] point you to Christ and doing everything
[1:35:45] that he can that is the what's right but
[1:35:49] if you see that creeping in run away
[1:35:52] from it get away from that dominating
[1:35:55] Spirit there's a warning in the Book of
[1:35:58] Revelation say talking about the Nicol
[1:36:03] itans they
