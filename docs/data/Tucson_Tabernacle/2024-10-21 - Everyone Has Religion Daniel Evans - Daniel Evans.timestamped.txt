[44:54] turn to Romans the first chapter
[44:58] in the 20th
[45:02] [Music]
[45:12] verse the Apostle Paul the author of the
[45:14] book of
[45:16] Romans he says this for the invisible
[45:18] things of him from the creation of the
[45:21] world are clearly seen being understood
[45:25] by the things that are made even his
[45:27] eternal power and godhead so that they
[45:30] are without
[45:32] excuse because that when they knew
[45:36] God they glorified him not as God
[45:40] neither were thankful but became vain in
[45:42] their imaginations and then their
[45:44] foolish heart was darkened professing
[45:47] themselves to be wise they became
[45:49] fools and changed the glory of the
[45:52] uncorruptible god into an image made
[45:54] like corruptible man and birds and
[45:57] four-footed beasts and creeping things
[45:59] wherefore God also gave them up to
[46:02] uncleanness through the lust of their
[46:04] own heart to dishonor their own bodies
[46:06] between themselves who changed the truth
[46:10] of God into a lie and worshiped and
[46:14] served the creature more than the
[46:17] Creator who is blessed
[46:20] forever amen God bless you you can be

[48:05] series is everybody here here familiar
[48:08] with the chosen series if you are raise
[48:10] your hand you know what it is
[48:13] wow that is absolutely
[48:16] outstanding I I know that back way back
[48:18] in the 1950s when the um Ten
[48:21] Commandments came out and benur came out
[48:24] it really stirred up the the the um the
[48:28] country and and really got people
[48:30] thinking about the Lord and I think that
[48:32] this chosen series is doing the same
[48:35] thing and I'll tell you what we watched
[48:37] that first episode and it is
[48:42] great the the way that they put it
[48:45] together and and you you can't just the
[48:48] scriptures are very plain but there most
[48:51] things are not written in the
[48:53] scriptures and we but this
[48:57] show has the ability to really put you
[49:01] into that situation and relate with each
[49:05] character and it starts out with Mary
[49:08] Magdalene um and what she was going
[49:11] through we know from the scriptures that
[49:13] that Seven Devils were cast out of her
[49:15] and and that that she had all these
[49:17] problems and it it starts with her and
[49:20] wow what a
[49:22] incredible just show that really C you
[49:27] in there and and what I want to do is I
[49:29] want I want the youth to get together

[50:00] welcome to come I want all of all the
[50:02] young people to come it it's really it's
[50:05] a blessing and I'm really excited about
[50:08] it and this is more of an Evangelistic
[50:11] show it really like I said it puts you
[50:14] into the Bible so with you kids invite
[50:17] your friends this is something and and
[50:19] I've seen testimonies all kinds of
[50:21] testimonies about this is something that
[50:22] people can give their heart to the Lord
[50:24] Jesus by just watching this show and
[50:28] brothers and sisters I don't care how
[50:30] you give your heart to the Lord Jesus I
[50:32] don't care if you come to this church I
[50:33] don't care if I baptize you up there I
[50:35] don't care if you find the the Lord in a
[50:37] Baptist Church or or in a any other
[50:40] church or if you find it watching a a
[50:43] show like the chosen as long as you give
[50:45] your heart to him that is the most
[50:47] important thing and I believe that this
[50:50] show is something that will be a
[50:52] blessing I I'm excited about it so let's
[50:57] um as I said talk to my son I'm going to
[50:59] pull on brother John sister an again to
[51:02] get you to go uh we had the nicest
[51:04] conversation afterwards too it just it
[51:07] brought a spirit that that encouraged us
[51:10] to talk about
[51:11] God and it was just as you can tell I I
[51:15] was blessed by being there and um I want
[51:18] other people to partake in that blessing
[51:21] and we got to figure out some way I
[51:23] don't want to just limit it to the kids
[51:25] because it is it's something that I
[51:27] think that all of us would would benefit
[51:29] from um we have I believe I wouldn't be
[51:35] a good pastor and especially a pastor if
[51:38] I didn't mention the upcoming election
[51:40] that we're having the national election
[51:43] it's um it's something that there's
[51:45] there's a lot at stake as as there is
[51:47] with every presidential election
[51:50] and the the the two sides seem to have
[51:55] diver more and more over the past couple
[51:59] decades to where you you almost can't
[52:03] they're completely completely separate
[52:05] even when they vote on something you
[52:07] have one party votes this way and the
[52:10] other party votes this way and they just
[52:12] hope that they have a couple defectors
[52:14] going back and forth It's not what this
[52:15] country was founded on it's not it's not
[52:18] it's it's not the best for the country
[52:21] but we do have um an election coming up
[52:25] and many people people most of the
[52:27] Believers actually I'd say most of the
[52:29] Believers that I know they say that that
[52:32] politics are all evil and and they don't
[52:35] vote and and I understand that and I've
[52:39] even heard people say that they don't
[52:40] vote because they don't want to be
[52:42] responsible for who is elected
[52:45] well I I I understand that also but I
[52:49] also want to point out that if you don't
[52:52] make a
[52:53] stand in your life whether it be voting
[52:58] as an
[52:59] American whether it be voting in this
[53:02] church whe what whatever it is if you
[53:06] don't make a stand then the stand that
[53:08] you are actually making is in support of
[53:11] whoever wins by simple
[53:14] math so if you don't vote then you're
[53:17] supporting whoever wins so I just want
[53:20] to point that out to the church I'm not
[53:23] telling you how to vote or or or or
[53:27] really how
[53:29] to who to support but it is important
[53:33] and it's going to affect all of
[53:35] us and whether and if it's going to
[53:38] affect me I want to have a say in it
[53:42] number one I want to have a say on my
[53:43] knees in prayer the bi the Bible teaches
[53:45] us that we should pray for our leaders
[53:48] and whether our leader is somebody that
[53:50] you can't stand their policies or
[53:53] someone that you like we are commanded
[53:55] to pray for for our leaders so we need
[53:58] to do that also that's the most
[54:00] important thing and then we need to V
[54:03] vote Voice our legal rights as as a
[54:08] people
[54:10] um and it's starting to really kind of
[54:13] heat up all of this rhetoric going
[54:16] around I um as uh many of you know I
[54:19] have an office on campus at the
[54:21] University of Arizona and I had to walk
[54:23] across campus the other day so I I go
[54:27] walking and uh it was just there was a
[54:32] funny feeling around it was a it's kind
[54:35] of a got a
[54:36] weird kind of weird vibe as I was
[54:39] walking around and and I started seeing
[54:42] a lot of t-shirts with writing on them
[54:45] political statements on both sides so I
[54:48] thought well this is this is kind of
[54:49] strange so keep
[54:51] walking and I get to uh this one a
[54:56] area and there is there are all these
[55:00] people all these students and they're
[55:02] just buzzing and there's Maga hats on
[55:07] and and there's uh keep your laws off my
[55:09] body t-shirts and there's all these
[55:12] different things and I'm I'm thinking
[55:15] this is weird what's what's going on so
[55:19] as I'm making my way and I have to get
[55:20] through here and it starts getting more
[55:21] and more
[55:22] crowded uh and as I'm going I there's
[55:25] this young man man he's standing on a
[55:28] bench and he's got the little uh the
[55:30] little green Gideon Bible and he's
[55:33] standing up and he's reading it out loud
[55:36] and I thought oh that's you know that's
[55:38] cool that's good and and then uh you
[55:41] know I kind of listen to what he was
[55:42] saying and then I see there's another
[55:43] kid um maybe a few feet from him and
[55:46] he's sitting down and he's reading and
[55:48] he's probably reading along with what
[55:49] the young man was saying when he was
[55:51] standing on the
[55:52] bench and then as I'm walking I get I
[55:56] get over here and I see all these real
[55:59] madeup like sorority and
[56:02] fraternity um students and they're man
[56:06] they're all they're all made up like
[56:07] they are and and
[56:09] um they got there this one girl had this
[56:12] gold Maga hat on with all these sink
[56:15] ones on it and stuff like that and and
[56:17] I'm looking and I'm thinking okay they
[56:19] they really are strong and they have
[56:20] their their petitions and and they're
[56:22] out there and they're they're they're
[56:24] saying their thing and and then as I'm
[56:26] walking and I see over here and I see
[56:28] these other ones and they have their
[56:29] keep your laws off of my body um
[56:32] t-shirts and uh and uh and and what was
[56:36] the other one that uh it said um
[56:39] reproductive Justice and uh social
[56:43] justice and there was there's all these
[56:45] different different people and
[56:47] everybody's voicing their their their
[56:49] their their concerns and as I get closer
[56:52] I see these big there's this there was
[56:54] this um these Shades and there's this
[56:56] big awning and there's this name on
[56:59] there and it says Charlie Kirk do you
[57:01] know you guys know does anybody know who
[57:02] that is yeah he's this young man that
[57:05] debates on college campuses so he was
[57:09] going to be there I thought I remember
[57:10] seeing him on YouTube but I didn't have
[57:12] time to stop I was I was busy um plus I
[57:15] didn't want to get in the middle of all
[57:17] this weirdness so I'm I'm I'm I'm going
[57:20] along and and as I'm looking at these
[57:24] people the thought came to my mind that
[57:29] this is their
[57:31] religion whatever they were they were
[57:33] voicing their concerns for one side the
[57:36] conservative side the Republican side
[57:37] the Democrat side whatever it was
[57:40] everybody had something to say everyone
[57:42] had passion and it was
[57:45] all they were wired in a way that that
[57:48] this is what they wanted to promote and
[57:51] I thought this is
[57:53] religion this is this has replaced
[57:57] salvation through Jesus Christ whether
[58:00] it be Republican or
[58:01] Democrat and now they're just trying to
[58:03] get their way and as I was going through
[58:08] I I came back and and just didn't like
[58:12] it and and and I'm coming back and I see
[58:15] the the
[58:17] um as I get to uh the area on U mall I
[58:20] see that they say um that the the
[58:22] abortion rights places were there and it
[58:26] said reproductive
[58:29] Freedom reproductive
[58:32] freedom is a fundamental right of all
[58:36] human beings and it's in the book of
[58:39] Genesis God
[58:42] commanded Adam and Eve multiply and
[58:46] replenish the Earth but what they have
[58:49] done is they have taken those words and
[58:51] they have changed them to mean the
[58:53] opposite of what they were
[58:56] and you can have an an oppressive regime
[58:58] like in China or whatever reproductive
[59:00] Freedom would mean that the government
[59:03] is preventing you from having children
[59:05] you're not allowed to have children but
[59:07] they turn it around and make it to where
[59:10] now reproductive freedom is the ability
[59:12] to destroy the
[59:14] children and the ability to not have a
[59:18] family that that's what the enemy does
[59:20] he takes the human the the English
[59:22] language or whatever language it is and
[59:24] he twists it to make it sound to make it
[59:28] provide his own his own um
[59:34] purposes and and then you see as as I
[59:36] was going I seeing the signs keep your
[59:38] laws off of my body that's really good
[59:41] for your um cause right there but what
[59:44] about when Co
[59:46] hit and they forced you if you're going
[59:49] to have a job you have to have a vaccine
[59:52] what happened to keep your laws off my
[59:55] body it's
[59:57] hypocrisy it's hypocrisy that people
[1:00:00] want to have their own ways and and all
[1:00:05] of this and both sides all of it it
[1:00:07] downplays the teaching of Christian
[1:00:09] values and it promotes different social
[1:00:13] issues and you know it's like these
[1:00:17] political rallies there's this all of
[1:00:18] this energy and all this was going on
[1:00:20] around and I thought why where is that
[1:00:22] energy for the Lord Jesus Christ really
[1:00:25] thank the Lord for the guy that was up
[1:00:26] there reading his his Gideon's Bible but
[1:00:28] I don't know how sincere he was I don't
[1:00:30] know if he was just trying to make a
[1:00:31] stand or if he was really concerned
[1:00:33] about all of those people because every
[1:00:34] one of those people thousands of them
[1:00:37] everyone had a
[1:00:38] soul and everyone was worthy of our time
[1:00:42] everyone was worthy of our prayers no
[1:00:44] matter if they they hate us no matter if
[1:00:47] you completely disagree with what they
[1:00:49] with what they think they're still
[1:00:52] worthy to reach out to them
[1:00:57] there's a scripture in
[1:01:00] Daniel that talks about the Prince of
[1:01:03] Persia and how that that Gabriel was
[1:01:08] commissioned he was sent out from God to
[1:01:11] come to Daniel and he tells Daniel when
[1:01:13] he gets there was some 21 days later he
[1:01:16] says Daniel he says as soon as you
[1:01:18] started praying and set your mind to
[1:01:20] have this understanding he said God sent
[1:01:23] me but I was hindered 21 days Days by
[1:01:26] this Prince of Persia and the angel and
[1:01:29] the Prince Michael had to he come and he
[1:01:32] came and helped
[1:01:34] me and if these things these spiritual
[1:01:39] battles were going on in the Book of
[1:01:42] Daniel then they are most certainly
[1:01:44] going on
[1:01:45] today and you you look at there's around
[1:01:49] the Throne of God I believe it's
[1:01:51] Revelation
[1:01:52] chapter early chapter five or somewhere
[1:01:55] around there
[1:01:56] it talks about a 100 million angels that
[1:02:00] surround the Throne of God and if there
[1:02:03] are all of those
[1:02:05] angels that that are are are surrounding
[1:02:08] singing praises to God those angels are
[1:02:12] influencing us also so if there's all of
[1:02:14] those angels then there must
[1:02:16] be millions of demons
[1:02:20] also and those those demons are also
[1:02:23] influencing people to get their own way
[1:02:26] right and we see this influence on both
[1:02:29] sides and what matters is the way that
[1:02:32] we make our decisions if we are
[1:02:36] going to serve God and truly seek God or
[1:02:41] ultimately it is Satan's way it is his
[1:02:45] desire it is his nature to serve
[1:02:48] himself are we going to serve ourselves
[1:02:51] or are we going to serve
[1:02:53] God and the way that we serve God is we
[1:02:57] deny
[1:02:59] ourselves and accept him so there is all
[1:03:04] of this conflict going on and and people
[1:03:06] really they they don't care about the
[1:03:09] truth what they care about is getting
[1:03:11] their way and and I'm going to talk a
[1:03:13] little bit more about politics you did
[1:03:15] you see the 60 Minutes Scandal that's
[1:03:18] going on right
[1:03:19] now where they interviewed kamla Harris
[1:03:23] the the next the the potential president
[1:03:25] pres that's running they interviewed her
[1:03:29] and they changed her
[1:03:32] answers they they they took a clip from
[1:03:35] later on in the program and they moved
[1:03:38] it forward to answer another question
[1:03:42] just to make her seem more co coherent
[1:03:44] and more able to be the
[1:03:46] president they didn't care if it was
[1:03:49] true they didn't they they didn't care
[1:03:51] if she's capable what they care about is
[1:03:54] getting their way it's a mess it's it's
[1:03:57] a terrible thing and this is our news
[1:03:59] media this is who is reporting out to us
[1:04:02] this is who is giving us news and
[1:04:06] blatantly right out there cutting and
[1:04:09] splicing to make a candidate seem more
[1:04:12] palatable for the
[1:04:15] people and what I want to tell the
[1:04:18] church is we always think that we're
[1:04:20] living in the end time and I believe we
[1:04:22] are but the King Solomon
[1:04:27] who's considered one of the wisest men
[1:04:29] that's ever lived he made this statement
[1:04:31] he said there's nothing new Under the
[1:04:33] Sun these things that are going on today
[1:04:37] have always gone on I've read the
[1:04:40] scripture a number of times saying that
[1:04:42] the things that you are suffering
[1:04:44] whether it be sickness whether it be
[1:04:45] oppression whatever it is you're not the
[1:04:48] only one that has ever suffered these
[1:04:50] things you're not the only one that has
[1:04:51] ever had marital problems you're not the
[1:04:53] only one that has ever had drug problems
[1:04:55] you're not the only one that has ever
[1:04:57] gotten sick this has happened all
[1:04:59] throughout
[1:05:01] history and it just repeats
[1:05:04] itself Matthew chapter 21 I want to read
[1:05:08] this I want to my my subject is going to
[1:05:12] be in the Book of Romans that everyone
[1:05:15] has religion but I want to show you the
[1:05:18] spirit behind much of these politics
[1:05:21] that we see today and really it's behind
[1:05:23] much of what is said in the church is
[1:05:26] it's behind what's said everywhere if
[1:05:29] you go to Matthew chap
[1:05:32] 21:23 this is the Lord Jesus and he's in
[1:05:34] the temple and these are probably the
[1:05:37] Sadducees that are talking with him and
[1:05:39] trying to catch him on certain
[1:05:43] problems or or certain things and trying
[1:05:46] to lessen his
[1:05:48] influence Matthew chapter 21:23 listen
[1:05:51] to this this is a by the way before we
[1:05:54] get there this is a very very important
[1:05:56] scripture this a very important story
[1:05:58] and it's a story that I believe we can
[1:06:01] not only relate to what we are seeing in
[1:06:04] our
[1:06:04] elections not only in what we see at
[1:06:08] work but we can bring it all the way
[1:06:10] down to our relationships with our own
[1:06:12] spouse with our own children with their
[1:06:15] own
[1:06:16] friends Matthew chapter 21:23 says this
[1:06:21] speaking of Jesus and when he was com
[1:06:23] into the temple the chief priests
[1:06:26] and the Elders of the people came unto
[1:06:28] him as he was teaching and said by what
[1:06:31] Authority doest thou these things and
[1:06:34] who gave thee this Authority so what
[1:06:36] they're saying is how are you casting
[1:06:37] out these Devils how are you healing
[1:06:39] these sick how are you doing all of
[1:06:42] this and Jesus answered and said unto
[1:06:45] them I also will ask you one thing which
[1:06:49] if you tell me I and likewise will tell
[1:06:53] you by what Authority I do these things
[1:06:55] so he's saying if you answer my question
[1:06:59] then I will answer your
[1:07:02] question the baptism of John speaking of
[1:07:04] John John the Baptist the baptism of
[1:07:08] John whence was it from heaven or from
[1:07:13] men so did this come from God or was
[1:07:16] this a
[1:07:17] carnal flawed
[1:07:20] thing and they reasoned with
[1:07:23] themselves saying if we shall shall say
[1:07:26] from
[1:07:27] Heaven he will say unto us why did ye
[1:07:31] not then believe
[1:07:33] him but if we shall say of
[1:07:36] Men We Fear the people for all whole
[1:07:40] John as a
[1:07:42] prophet so their religion was the
[1:07:45] sadducee religion and they they had it
[1:07:48] had never entered their mind to really
[1:07:51] seek God for the answers about this this
[1:07:54] Rabbi named Jes
[1:07:56] Jesus all they could think about was
[1:07:58] their agenda their philosophy their
[1:08:00] political views and their opinions
[1:08:03] that's all that they could think about
[1:08:05] right here and it didn't cross their
[1:08:07] mind Lord am I
[1:08:09] right to me the stories in the Bible
[1:08:12] especially this one should always be
[1:08:14] kept in the back of our
[1:08:15] minds when you take a position on
[1:08:18] anything whether it's religious position
[1:08:21] or a political position or a position on
[1:08:24] something in the church or something in
[1:08:26] your family you are taking this position
[1:08:29] are you taking this position because of
[1:08:31] your own
[1:08:32] opinion because of your own
[1:08:35] desires or are you taking this position
[1:08:39] because it's God's
[1:08:43] position so there these Pharisees and
[1:08:46] these Sadducees are coming to Jesus
[1:08:50] Jesus asks them a question says I'll
[1:08:52] answer you very important I will answer
[1:08:54] you
[1:08:56] if you will answer me the baptism of
[1:08:59] John of God or of
[1:09:03] men I just thought of this and I think
[1:09:06] I'm going to read two quotes really
[1:09:10] quick and I'm sorry brother Jeremy I
[1:09:13] didn't give you these quotes but uh I
[1:09:15] just when I was back
[1:09:17] there listen to
[1:09:20] this this is from time of decision a
[1:09:23] sermon called time of decision
[1:09:26] in the late 1950s you
[1:09:29] see God don't make all of our decisions
[1:09:32] and there's many times that God doesn't
[1:09:34] tell His prophets just what to do
[1:09:36] because they have to make the decision
[1:09:39] if there is no decision that we have to
[1:09:41] make just wait every move on
[1:09:45] God there is no over overcoming on our
[1:09:49] part and sometimes speaking of the
[1:09:52] prophets and sometimes they make the
[1:09:55] wrong
[1:09:57] decisions God's anointed prophets makes
[1:10:01] the wrong decisions and many times are
[1:10:05] deceived end
[1:10:06] quote from time of decision 1959 0611
[1:10:11] next
[1:10:13] quote this is from
[1:10:15] 1955 June 7th a True Vine and a false
[1:10:19] Vine look at this Elijah sitting there
[1:10:23] and here come the shunamite woman women
[1:10:25] and fell down by him like that and said
[1:10:28] God's troubled her heart and kept it
[1:10:30] from
[1:10:32] me they don't know all things they just
[1:10:35] know what God will let them know they're
[1:10:39] not infallible
[1:10:41] people the Bible said Elijah was a man
[1:10:43] subject to like passions as we are his
[1:10:46] ups and downs and
[1:10:48] differences I just threw those in there
[1:10:50] as I was in the back and I was I I was I
[1:10:52] was going over my sermon and I was I was
[1:10:54] thinking on things these two quotes came
[1:10:57] to my mind and I looked them up and put
[1:10:59] them in my my notes because I wanted to
[1:11:01] ask the question to the people here and
[1:11:05] to the people that will listen to this
[1:11:07] and probably
[1:11:10] criticize how do you
[1:11:12] answer are they
[1:11:14] infallible or not if you go back and you
[1:11:20] say well if I answer that are fallible
[1:11:26] and they make mistakes then everything
[1:11:28] that I have taught and everything that I
[1:11:29] believe my whole life that I have to
[1:11:31] throw that
[1:11:32] out but if I answer that they are
[1:11:37] infallible then they'll ask them why is
[1:11:39] that not
[1:11:41] true I don't have an
[1:11:44] answer and then God then Jesus will say
[1:11:47] and neither will I answer you when you
[1:11:49] ask me
[1:11:50] things if you are not able to answer
[1:11:53] that if you are not able to set aside
[1:11:54] your differences then neither will I
[1:11:57] answer this verse number
[1:11:59] 27 and they answered Jesus and said we
[1:12:01] cannot tell and he said unto them
[1:12:04] neither tell I you by what Authority I
[1:12:07] do these things so that we so when we
[1:12:11] have that attitude towards the
[1:12:12] scriptures or anything else towards any
[1:12:15] subject then it's about our way and our
[1:12:18] way of thinking and our opinion then if
[1:12:21] we if we if if we try to answer
[1:12:23] according to our doctrines then and we
[1:12:26] can't
[1:12:27] answer then Jesus will say neither will
[1:12:31] I answer you when you pray to
[1:12:33] me it's written in the Bible this is
[1:12:37] Jesus Christ talking this is God in
[1:12:39] flesh and they asked him he asked them
[1:12:42] is John this Prophet is John's baptism
[1:12:46] from God or from men they said well if
[1:12:50] if we say it's from God then they know
[1:12:52] that we were against John and then if we
[1:12:54] say that it's from
[1:12:57] men then they believe God's a prophet oh
[1:12:59] we can't answer then Jesus says and
[1:13:01] neither will I answer you what a
[1:13:04] statement neither will I answer
[1:13:06] you imagine if we have that attitude and
[1:13:11] he won't answer us because of our
[1:13:15] opinions and our wanting to get our
[1:13:21] way you know the we look
[1:13:26] at the Old
[1:13:28] Testament and we think that the Old
[1:13:30] Testament is this
[1:13:32] harsh corrective
[1:13:35] thing that that is very unforgiving and
[1:13:39] legalistic in its Commandments and then
[1:13:42] we go to the New Testament and we see
[1:13:44] people like Paul and he says I'm free to
[1:13:47] do all things and so are you and we
[1:13:50] think that that maybe the rains loosened
[1:13:53] a little bit from God from when Jesus
[1:13:56] came from the Old Testament to when
[1:13:58] Jesus came and the answer is
[1:14:01] no what happened with the New Testament
[1:14:04] is we have less freedom than we did in
[1:14:07] the Old Testament because there are
[1:14:08] certain things in the Old Testament that
[1:14:10] that aren't taught
[1:14:11] about like social
[1:14:15] media like like many
[1:14:18] things but we are more bound Now by
[1:14:22] Christ by by the word than we were were
[1:14:25] in the Old Testament because the holy
[1:14:27] spirit is now answering every single
[1:14:30] question and directing Us in every
[1:14:31] single thing so now we are more
[1:14:37] responsible than we were in the Old
[1:14:40] Testament and God's Commandments are now
[1:14:44] infinitely more than they were in the
[1:14:46] Old
[1:14:47] Testament because he is constantly
[1:14:50] correcting us and constantly telling us
[1:14:52] and before they just had to look it up
[1:14:54] well Moses said here that you had to
[1:14:55] trim your beard this certain way Moses
[1:14:58] said over here that no you have to if
[1:15:00] you want a divorce you have to write her
[1:15:01] a letter and then and then get it
[1:15:03] notorized and then let her take it out
[1:15:05] and then then you can
[1:15:07] divorce but then when Jesus came he says
[1:15:11] no everything in your life I require a
[1:15:16] complete
[1:15:17] surrender and he said now you I have
[1:15:20] taken up this cross I have given my
[1:15:21] heart my life fully to God from the from
[1:15:26] from my whole life I have given my life
[1:15:29] fully to God now you you take up your
[1:15:32] cross and follow me you do as I did so
[1:15:37] this new testament there is far less
[1:15:40] freedom than the Old
[1:15:42] Testament Paul said I am a prisoner for
[1:15:45] Christ in all things I am a prisoner so
[1:15:50] brothers and sisters when we're making
[1:15:52] these decisions when we're thinking
[1:15:54] about things whether it be religious
[1:15:56] things on on how we believe and the
[1:15:58] doctrines that we have are you just
[1:16:00] trying to further your Doctrine like the
[1:16:02] guys in the booth at the University are
[1:16:04] you just trying to further
[1:16:06] that or do you really seek God lord what
[1:16:10] is right I would like to know am I going
[1:16:13] to take these quotes that the brother
[1:16:16] read am I going to be offended at
[1:16:19] them up to me I'm not telling you how to
[1:16:21] believe I'm not telling you to believe
[1:16:23] whether they're infall prophets are
[1:16:25] infallible or not infallible that's
[1:16:27] that's between you and God you're not
[1:16:28] going to hear me preach that kind of
[1:16:30] stuff I've heard both sides preach it
[1:16:33] and it's nonsense all it does is Just
[1:16:35] Cause
[1:16:36] division my point as a minister of the
[1:16:39] Gospel is to present it to you as Jesus
[1:16:42] did and said now what do you
[1:16:45] say let's go to Romans chapter one
[1:16:47] before I get too far I want to get to my
[1:16:48] subject here uh let's start with uh
[1:16:51] let's start with verse
[1:16:53] 15 keep this in mind mind these politics
[1:16:56] that are going on right now and and what
[1:16:58] I talked about about about the abortion
[1:17:01] issue and and about all the social
[1:17:03] justice and and all of these things keep
[1:17:05] those things in mind and as I was
[1:17:07] praying about this this is really a
[1:17:12] testimony a couple days ago I was like
[1:17:14] Lord I'd really like to tell that
[1:17:17] story and there's a poster that um I uh
[1:17:21] we'll show up here in a minute and I I
[1:17:24] really want to Minister on that but I
[1:17:26] can't find I don't know anywhere in the
[1:17:29] Bible that it
[1:17:32] says these that everyone has that
[1:17:36] everyone has religion and and we all are
[1:17:39] religious and really I believe the Lord
[1:17:42] directed me to Romans chapter 1 and
[1:17:46] you'll see how these questions are
[1:17:47] answered
[1:17:48] here let's start with verse 15 so as
[1:17:52] much this is the Apostle Paul speaking
[1:17:54] so as much much as in me I am ready to
[1:17:56] preach the gospel to you that are in
[1:17:58] Rome also thus we have the book of
[1:18:00] Romans so it's it's it's sent to the
[1:18:04] people in Rome for I am not ashamed of
[1:18:06] the gospel of Christ for it is the power
[1:18:09] of God unto salvation to everyone that
[1:18:11] believeth to the Jew first and also to
[1:18:15] the Greek for therein is the
[1:18:17] righteousness of God revealed from Faith
[1:18:19] to Faith and it is written the just
[1:18:21] shall live by faith for the wrath of God
[1:18:24] is revealed from Heaven against all
[1:18:27] ungodliness and
[1:18:29] unrighteousness of men who hold the
[1:18:32] truth in unrighteousness now that who
[1:18:37] hold the truth in unrighteousness that's
[1:18:40] difficult to understand in in the old
[1:18:44] language what that means is it doesn't
[1:18:47] mean that they're holding fast to the
[1:18:49] truth it means that they are um holding
[1:18:53] it back
[1:18:55] they're suppressing the
[1:18:58] truth remember the priests in the temple
[1:19:01] who wouldn't answer Jesus because John
[1:19:03] the Baptist didn't match their religion
[1:19:05] and remember 60
[1:19:07] minutes because K Harris couldn't give a
[1:19:10] coherent
[1:19:11] answer they're holding back the truth
[1:19:15] because it doesn't match the way that
[1:19:16] they think it's
[1:19:18] everywhere it's it's believe me this is
[1:19:21] this is all over the place the spirit
[1:19:26] verse number 19 because that which may
[1:19:30] be known of God is manifested in them
[1:19:33] for God hath showed it unto them for the
[1:19:35] invisible things of him from the
[1:19:37] creation of the world are clearly
[1:19:40] seen being understood by the things that
[1:19:43] are made even his eternal power and
[1:19:46] godhead so that they are without EXC
[1:19:49] excuse so that's a very strange
[1:19:51] statement it says that the invisible
[1:19:54] things of him from the creation of the
[1:19:56] world are clearly
[1:19:58] seen so how can you see something that's
[1:20:02] invisible the Apostle here is saying
[1:20:05] that he's saying that the the invisible
[1:20:08] God is clear for us all to see
[1:20:12] how as I was reading that I said how how
[1:20:16] can how can that
[1:20:19] be
[1:20:21] people and it doesn't matter if you're a
[1:20:23] Christian it doesn't matter if you're an
[1:20:25] atheist doesn't matter if you're
[1:20:27] agnostic Hindu or whatever you
[1:20:31] are it says here that God is plain to
[1:20:35] see for
[1:20:37] everyone and if you if you think about
[1:20:40] it look up at the
[1:20:43] stars you don't have to know your Bible
[1:20:46] to see that there is something greater
[1:20:49] than us that created that now you can be
[1:20:52] the scientist and say oh no it all came
[1:20:54] from from from uh this or that the big
[1:20:56] bangang Theory or whatever it is okay
[1:20:58] you can say that but you're still you
[1:21:01] are still responsible because God set
[1:21:04] that in
[1:21:05] order I was I was um yesterday I was
[1:21:09] raking my
[1:21:10] yard and I looked and there was this ant
[1:21:14] hill with those those big black ants and
[1:21:18] and I was like raking and I thought wow
[1:21:20] that's that's kind of cool and I see
[1:21:21] that this train of ants went way over to
[1:21:24] the side of my yard and there's these
[1:21:26] little ants and they're carrying flower
[1:21:28] petals and they're cruising along and I
[1:21:31] was like wow look at these guys and and
[1:21:33] like every 10th one they all had
[1:21:35] something and they're carrying them and
[1:21:37] they're going into the into the thing
[1:21:39] and and the they Dro their stuff off and
[1:21:41] they'd come out and and I'm I'm looking
[1:21:43] at this thinking well wow that's that's
[1:21:45] that's neat and so I rake a little bit
[1:21:46] on the antill and they freak out man
[1:21:50] they start going everywhere and out of
[1:21:52] this antill comes all of these other
[1:21:53] black ants
[1:21:55] and I was like
[1:21:56] whoa you know chill out guys and they
[1:21:59] come out and they are ready to do
[1:22:01] battle so you see that that these ants
[1:22:04] are carrying in the food and then when
[1:22:07] something shakes a little bit here comes
[1:22:08] all the soldiers and they draw their
[1:22:11] sword and it whether it's a horny toad
[1:22:13] or a lizard or whatever it is they're
[1:22:15] going to take him out so they're all
[1:22:19] working in Perfect
[1:22:21] Harmony these ants
[1:22:24] remember Job in the Bible he didn't have
[1:22:27] a bible to read there was no Bible in
[1:22:29] job's time Moses was way after him that
[1:22:33] wrote Genesis so here's job and he sees
[1:22:36] this
[1:22:37] tree and he says wow that tree was dead
[1:22:41] and now it's
[1:22:43] alive God what about
[1:22:45] me if I die can I live again job looked
[1:22:51] around and he saw the Great Jehovah God
[1:22:55] even without a Bible and this scripture
[1:22:58] is saying listen you are
[1:23:02] guilty because not only did I give you a
[1:23:05] Bible not only did I give you a minister
[1:23:08] not only did I give you a kid standing
[1:23:10] up on his bench reading the Bible out
[1:23:12] loud but I also gave you the stars and
[1:23:15] the moon and I gave you ants and I gave
[1:23:17] you trees I gave you all these things
[1:23:19] for my own
[1:23:20] Glory so that you will be you will not
[1:23:24] be Guiltless on that day you can see
[1:23:29] God Proverbs it says go to the ant
[1:23:33] consider the
[1:23:35] ant thou Slugger consider her ways and
[1:23:38] be wise which having no guide no
[1:23:42] overseer no ruler she provides food in
[1:23:45] the summer and gathers food her food in
[1:23:48] the
[1:23:49] Harvest there's no king ant I think
[1:23:53] there's a queen but I don't know if they
[1:23:54] exactly give orders they don't but but
[1:23:58] they all know their job and they're all
[1:24:00] doing their job so do they have little
[1:24:03] radios saying Josiah go get this and
[1:24:06] that and and no they just do it and you
[1:24:10] look at God's Ministry and he gave some
[1:24:14] Apostles and these Apostles aren't under
[1:24:17] any type of Direction they are under the
[1:24:19] direction of the Holy Spirit just like
[1:24:20] the ant is and they're going out and
[1:24:23] they are setting Church is in order and
[1:24:25] he gave some prophets that come and they
[1:24:28] they prophesy and they warn the people
[1:24:31] of impending
[1:24:33] judgment evangelists they get the people
[1:24:36] stirred up all working under the same
[1:24:40] Holy Spirit pastors they oversee the
[1:24:43] congregation they're always taking care
[1:24:45] of them and looking out for him and
[1:24:46] worried about him and then the teachers
[1:24:48] come in and they're expounding upon the
[1:24:50] word and talking about talking about
[1:24:52] here's what this scripture means here's
[1:24:53] what it means to day all working perfect
[1:24:57] let me tell you these ants they are led
[1:24:59] by the Holy Spirit to do what they're
[1:25:01] doing the one carrying the flow
[1:25:04] pedal he was under the anointing of the
[1:25:07] Holy Ghost the soldiers that came out
[1:25:09] when I R their
[1:25:11] home operating under the same holy
[1:25:14] spirit that I'm operating under the same
[1:25:17] holy spirit that you are operating under
[1:25:19] an ant in the ground and that's what
[1:25:22] this scripture is saying for the
[1:25:24] invisible things of him from the
[1:25:26] creation of the world are clearly seen
[1:25:29] you can look at an anill
[1:25:32] as Solomon said being understood by the
[1:25:35] things that are
[1:25:37] made these things that God created the
[1:25:40] heavens and the Earth even his eternal
[1:25:42] power and godhead so that they are
[1:25:44] without
[1:25:47] excuse because that when they knew
[1:25:51] God they glorified him not as God
[1:25:55] neither were thankful but became vain in
[1:25:58] their imaginations and their foolish
[1:26:00] heart was
[1:26:01] darkened English Standard Version says
[1:26:04] for although they knew God they did not
[1:26:06] honor him as God or give thanks to him
[1:26:10] but they became feudal in their thinking
[1:26:13] and their foolish Hearts were
[1:26:15] darkened professing themselves to be
[1:26:18] wise they became fools what a statement
[1:26:23] professing them elves to be to be wise
[1:26:26] they saying that we are wise we are
[1:26:28] smart we are educated and they became
[1:26:31] fools as I was walking around there and
[1:26:33] I see all this weirdness going on on
[1:26:35] campus this is
[1:26:38] education this is what our children are
[1:26:40] being filled with is all of this
[1:26:43] nonsense I don't I'll just say
[1:26:46] it the most foolish people in this world
[1:26:49] are often the most
[1:26:52] educated why is that
[1:26:55] because they think they're better and
[1:26:57] they want to do
[1:26:59] dominate or denominate both the little
[1:27:03] guy we know better for you you little
[1:27:06] simple guy we know better so you just
[1:27:10] vote for us you just do what we say and
[1:27:12] then we'll take care of you and look who
[1:27:15] promotes the
[1:27:16] worship of animals and the environment
[1:27:20] and the all of
[1:27:22] the the the cre
[1:27:25] look who promotes that it's the most
[1:27:30] educated and change the glory verse
[1:27:33] number
[1:27:35] 23 I'll get to that one just a
[1:27:40] second it's a weird
[1:27:43] picture I'll get to it I'll explain what
[1:27:45] it
[1:27:46] is it's odd um
[1:27:51] and you talking about weird
[1:27:55] I mean these people they ignore God and
[1:27:59] they start worshiping they start
[1:28:01] worshiping the environment and and and
[1:28:03] worshiping the the cows and worshiping
[1:28:07] the the plants and worshiping the
[1:28:09] environment and and worshiping the the
[1:28:12] used to be the ozone
[1:28:16] layer and now it's global warming and
[1:28:21] all this I'm not saying it's wrong most
[1:28:23] of you know I've devoted my professional
[1:28:26] life to studying the
[1:28:29] environment so
[1:28:31] anyways verse number 23 and changed the
[1:28:35] glory of the uncorruptible god into an
[1:28:37] image made like to corruptible men so
[1:28:40] they changed this Jehovah Yahweh Elohim
[1:28:44] this great self-existing one they
[1:28:47] changed God into something that was
[1:28:51] corruptible into an image made like
[1:28:54] corruptible men and to birds and
[1:28:56] four-footed beasts and creeping things
[1:28:58] let me tell you we look back in the Old
[1:29:01] Testament and we see look at all this
[1:29:03] idolatry where did all this idolatry
[1:29:06] come from let me tell you there is more
[1:29:07] idolatry here in the United States than
[1:29:09] there is throughout the whole Bible it
[1:29:11] is everywhere and I'm going to show you
[1:29:13] where it is now you can put up the
[1:29:15] creepy
[1:29:16] picture so as I was coming back from my
[1:29:21] journey across campus this was was taped
[1:29:24] to my office
[1:29:27] wall veganism is a moral
[1:29:30] urgency as I said everyone has
[1:29:34] religion this is these people's religion
[1:29:37] you have a half calf and a half dog and
[1:29:40] they're saying don't eat these things
[1:29:44] I've eaten both of them by the
[1:29:47] way yesterday I had a tostada a shredded
[1:29:51] beef tostada from pho's Taco Shop it was
[1:29:54] great it was made from dead
[1:29:56] cow and when I was in
[1:29:59] Indonesia I ate a dead
[1:30:01] dog it wasn't so good it wasn't as good
[1:30:04] as the as the dead cow I'd recommend the
[1:30:06] cow over the dog but but they're saying
[1:30:09] here they're putting here and they're
[1:30:11] saying basically if you won't eat the
[1:30:13] dog why are you eating the
[1:30:20] cow and it says veganism is a moral
[1:30:24] urgency as I said it's a flyer outside
[1:30:26] my office okay you take down the creepy
[1:30:28] picture um so then what do I do I go to
[1:30:32] the website looks like it's sponsored by
[1:30:33] the University of Arizona there and it
[1:30:35] says this on the website it says there
[1:30:37] are three pillars in our movement this
[1:30:40] is the
[1:30:42] um Allied Scholars for animal
[1:30:45] protection we have three pillars
[1:30:48] Outreach which is this we ensure strong
[1:30:51] and conspicuous Outreach presence on
[1:30:54] campuses and continuously find and
[1:30:56] Inspire vegan students or to help
[1:30:58] students go vegan get active and pursue
[1:31:01] impactful careers one of their pillars
[1:31:04] the next one community and education and
[1:31:06] empowerment we build supportive
[1:31:08] Community for vegans and provide
[1:31:09] educational seminars and the third one
[1:31:12] is accessibility we support campaigns to
[1:31:15] transition dining Halls towards
[1:31:17] plant-based eating to make plant-based
[1:31:19] food more acceptable if you're a
[1:31:22] vegetarian I don't care I'm not saying
[1:31:25] that it's wrong to not eat meat what
[1:31:28] they're doing is do you see do you feel
[1:31:30] the religious undertones in
[1:31:32] this we are going to take these areas
[1:31:36] and we are going to separate them that
[1:31:38] you have a place to worship that you
[1:31:41] have a place you you have
[1:31:45] accessible we would say accessible to
[1:31:47] the word of God and they're saying
[1:31:49] accessible to plant-based food Outreach
[1:31:53] I mean we're all we're all about a
[1:31:56] Christian the whole thing one of the M
[1:31:58] foundations one of our pillars is to go
[1:32:01] out and preach the gospel tell everybody
[1:32:03] about Jesus Christ that that's their
[1:32:06] first one is Outreach we need to get our
[1:32:09] message out listen to these
[1:32:13] testimonies says
[1:32:16] this one of the testimonies on the
[1:32:18] website veganism finally allowed me to
[1:32:19] align my actions with my values and it's
[1:32:22] the best decision I've ever made in my
[1:32:23] life
[1:32:27] life my only regret not doing it
[1:32:31] sooner an un unexpected side effect of
[1:32:35] plant-based diet it's also protecting
[1:32:37] the environment and reduces human
[1:32:38] suffering things I've always cared about
[1:32:41] and that's the founder and CEO of this
[1:32:44] this
[1:32:46] movement another person says as a PhD ma
[1:32:50] as a PhD student in math at Harvard
[1:32:54] I was introduced to ASAP this is the
[1:32:56] acronym for this um this movement during
[1:32:58] Dr harini whose I just read Dr hen's Le
[1:33:02] lecture at Harvard in
[1:33:04] MIT ASAP has been a tremendous source of
[1:33:06] motivation for animal activisms in
[1:33:08] Boston including myself though they're
[1:33:10] organized and and effective animal
[1:33:13] advocacy which includes a range of
[1:33:15] Outreach and educational events I am
[1:33:16] thrilled to be part of creating a
[1:33:18] positive change at
[1:33:20] Harvard is this not religion
[1:33:24] these
[1:33:26] testimonies it's it's a perversion of
[1:33:28] the real thing how many people can say
[1:33:30] I'm so glad I started going to church
[1:33:33] because I gave my heart to the Lord and
[1:33:35] I got rid of the drugs and I got rid of
[1:33:36] the alcohol and they're saying I got rid
[1:33:38] of
[1:33:39] meat what a mess what an impersonation
[1:33:43] of
[1:33:45] Christianity there's for time's sake I
[1:33:47] won't go through these other ones let me
[1:33:48] read this this one another testimony
[1:33:52] meeting meeting for us during animal
[1:33:54] activism in New York City was a
[1:33:56] remarkable moment that changed the
[1:33:58] course of my life through through our
[1:34:00] connection fra recognized and
[1:34:01] appreciated my Outreach skills and he
[1:34:03] extended an opportunity for me to join
[1:34:05] the join the ministry no join the team
[1:34:09] at ASAP it fills my heart with joy to
[1:34:13] know that my position and abilities are
[1:34:15] valued and that I have the privilege of
[1:34:16] working alongside like-minded
[1:34:18] individuals who share deep commitments
[1:34:20] to animal
[1:34:22] Liberation what what about the
[1:34:24] liberation of a soul what about the
[1:34:26] liberation of a soul from the shackles
[1:34:29] of the
[1:34:31] devil that is what we should be looking
[1:34:33] at and not this
[1:34:36] nonsense but it's
[1:34:40] religion and every group like
[1:34:44] this guy here they all have their leader
[1:34:47] they all have the one that they look
[1:34:49] to it might be Oprah Winfrey it might be
[1:34:52] Donald Trump it might be Barack Obama
[1:34:53] Obama it might be Joseph Smith whoever
[1:34:56] it might be they've got their leaders I
[1:34:59] want to tell a a story really quick as
[1:35:02] um when I was in the ministry in
[1:35:04] Jeffersonville I got a call from an
[1:35:06] English an a man from England and he was
[1:35:09] a he was a reporter and he said you know
[1:35:12] they talk funny
[1:35:14] anyways so he says he said
[1:35:19] that I just want to
[1:35:21] know he says does your min
[1:35:24] teach that people should eat
[1:35:29] monkeys and I was
[1:35:32] like I don't understand the
[1:35:35] question and he says does your religion
[1:35:37] teach that people should eat monkeys and
[1:35:39] I was like I don't
[1:35:41] know I said and I told the story about
[1:35:44] Peter I went in this big long story
[1:35:45] about how Peter prayed and and and God
[1:35:47] said no you can eat anything and he said
[1:35:49] not anything unclean the guy could care
[1:35:50] less what I what what I was saying
[1:35:52] because that wasn't his point point he
[1:35:54] says specifically
[1:35:58] apes and I said man I'm sorry I just
[1:36:01] don't know what you're talking about and
[1:36:04] he says here's the deal he
[1:36:07] said you all your ministry is spreading
[1:36:11] like
[1:36:12] wildfire through the Congo through the
[1:36:15] pygmies and through the through the
[1:36:17] natives and through back in the jungles
[1:36:19] and he said what's happening is these
[1:36:21] people they had an animous religion
[1:36:23] where they worship the animals as their
[1:36:26] ancestors and he says when they accept
[1:36:29] your message and when they give their
[1:36:31] hearts they didn't say Jesus Christ but
[1:36:33] he says when they're baptized when they
[1:36:35] give and I say this when they give their
[1:36:37] hearts to Jesus Christ they stop fearing
[1:36:39] and worshiping the animals the monkeys
[1:36:42] and they start eating
[1:36:45] them and I was like well
[1:36:49] yeah they're not afraid of them anymore
[1:36:52] I said they have to follow the laws of
[1:36:53] the Bible very plainly teaches us to
[1:36:55] follow the laws and he says well then
[1:36:57] you need to tell them to stop so what
[1:36:59] this man is doing he did not like that
[1:37:02] the fact that they were these heathens
[1:37:04] were giving their hearts to Jesus Christ
[1:37:06] having an experience getting saved
[1:37:10] filled with the Holy Ghost he was like
[1:37:11] no no no go back because they're eating
[1:37:14] monkeys that was what was important to
[1:37:17] him was his religion which had nothing
[1:37:21] to do with God
[1:37:25] wherefore verse 24 wherefore God G also
[1:37:30] gave them up to uncleanness through the
[1:37:32] lust of their own Hearts to dishonor
[1:37:34] their own bodies between themselves look
[1:37:38] what this
[1:37:39] produces this worshiping of animals and
[1:37:42] and worshiping of liberal ideologies and
[1:37:45] and these and and worshiping of the
[1:37:46] environment Watch what it produces and
[1:37:49] then you will be able to see it plainly
[1:37:51] now wherever you go who changed the
[1:37:54] truth of God into a
[1:37:56] lie and worshiped and served the
[1:38:00] creature the creation more than the
[1:38:03] Creator notice it doesn't say rather
[1:38:05] than it just says more
[1:38:09] than more than the
[1:38:12] Creator who changed I'll read it again
[1:38:15] who changed the truth of God into a lie
[1:38:18] and worshiped and served the creation
[1:38:20] the creature more than the Creator who
[1:38:23] is blessed forever now watch what Paul
[1:38:25] says he says you're they serve the the
[1:38:29] creation more than the
[1:38:32] Creator and he says God is blessed
[1:38:35] forever and then he says amen it's the
[1:38:38] only time he says it in this he must
[1:38:40] have been getting going on writing this
[1:38:42] letter and he's like yeah Amen to
[1:38:46] that now watch what happens when they
[1:38:50] start going off into this idolatry and
[1:38:52] as I said brothers and sisters we are
[1:38:54] surrounded by
[1:38:55] idolatry we don't see it because they
[1:38:58] don't have a a little
[1:39:00] Idol sitting maybe on their desk or or
[1:39:04] in their car well they're
[1:39:07] everywhere but they're worshiping the
[1:39:09] creation more than the
[1:39:12] Creator for this cause watch what
[1:39:15] follows now for this Goda cause God gave
[1:39:18] them up into vile
[1:39:21] affections NIV says shameful
[1:39:24] lusts for this cause God gave them up
[1:39:26] into vile affections for even their
[1:39:28] women did change the natural use of that
[1:39:31] which is against nature and likewise
[1:39:33] also so these women did something
[1:39:35] perverted and likewise also the
[1:39:39] men leaving the natural use of the woman
[1:39:42] burned in their own lust one towards
[1:39:46] another and if you didn't understand
[1:39:48] that he makes it very plain here men
[1:39:50] with
[1:39:51] men working that which is unseemly and
[1:39:54] receiving in themselves that recompense
[1:39:56] of the error which was met so when you
[1:39:59] allow Satan in when you put God aside
[1:40:02] you can look at an antill you can look
[1:40:04] at a tree you can look at a mountain and
[1:40:06] you can see that there is a Jehovah God
[1:40:08] and if you choose not to see that watch
[1:40:10] what comes
[1:40:15] in I even
[1:40:17] saw I mean it's getting really bad I
[1:40:20] even saw a young man
[1:40:24] makeup the long eyelashes full dress
[1:40:28] brand new dress heels like a girl and a
[1:40:34] beard I saw it and it's been a couple of
[1:40:38] them it's getting really strange but if
[1:40:41] you throw out God you just open the door
[1:40:44] for any type of perversion to come in
[1:40:46] which is what we have done as a country
[1:40:48] and I cannot I can't believe that we are
[1:40:51] electing people that are for this type
[1:40:53] of
[1:40:54] Filth and we are
[1:40:57] responsible being filled with all
[1:40:59] unrighteousness and fornication and
[1:41:01] wickedness and Covetous and and
[1:41:03] maliciousness full of envy and murder
[1:41:04] and debate deceit malignity wh
[1:41:06] Whisperers backbiters haters of God
[1:41:09] despiteful proud boasters inventors of
[1:41:12] evil
[1:41:14] things disobedient to
[1:41:17] parents disobedient to parents he just
[1:41:20] mentions that in there he mention all of
[1:41:23] this
[1:41:25] perversion and then he says Disobedience
[1:41:28] to parents gender altering drugs without
[1:41:31] a parent's
[1:41:33] permission surgeries gender changing
[1:41:36] surgeries without parents permission
[1:41:39] abortions without parents
[1:41:41] permissions all of this this worship of
[1:41:44] the creation it brings in all of this
[1:41:47] nonsense and disobedient to
[1:41:51] Parents Without understanding Covenant
[1:41:54] Breakers without natural AFF affection
[1:41:58] implacable
[1:41:59] unmerciful in of NIV says they have no
[1:42:03] understanding no Fidelity no love and no
[1:42:07] mercy who knowing the Judgment of God
[1:42:10] that they which commit such things are
[1:42:12] worthy of death not only do the same but
[1:42:16] have pleasure in them that do
[1:42:18] them I assume that the apostle was
[1:42:21] referring back to the law of Moses and
[1:42:23] the punishment and he's saying that they
[1:42:26] know the consequences of doing these
[1:42:28] things but yet they do them
[1:42:31] anyways musicians can
[1:42:33] come my hour is up and
[1:42:38] uh that's a good place to stop brothers
[1:42:42] and sisters the reason that I am
[1:42:44] preaching
[1:42:45] this is I want you to understand what is
[1:42:48] surrounding you these things are not new
[1:42:51] they were here when Paul wrote The Book
[1:42:53] of Romans exactly the same people
[1:42:57] worshiping the creation rather than the
[1:43:00] Creator and then we goes on and on and
[1:43:02] on and here we are now with an election
[1:43:05] before us with one group that stands for
[1:43:10] the
[1:43:11] weirdness of the poster that I put up
[1:43:15] here and the the perversion that's in
[1:43:19] life it's
[1:43:21] here it's been here here and now it's
[1:43:25] here again and it's nothing new it was
[1:43:28] all the way back to the Garden of
[1:43:33] Eden when God told
[1:43:37] them not to sin God told them what not
[1:43:40] to do and then they did it
[1:43:42] anyways they did not have the respect
[1:43:45] for God's
[1:43:47] word then and do we have it now and I
[1:43:52] ask you
[1:43:53] brothers and sisters whether it be for
[1:43:57] something in church whether it be for
[1:43:59] your personal decisions that you make
[1:44:01] whatever it
[1:44:03] is are you taking those Pharisees
[1:44:07] Sadducees
[1:44:08] ways when they're trying to figure
[1:44:13] out is it if we answer this way then
[1:44:17] this will happen if I answer that way
[1:44:19] then that will happen or are you truly
[1:44:22] taking
[1:44:24] God and saying No this is what I believe
[1:44:26] the word of God teaches brother lonel
[1:44:29] that's the most important thing we can
[1:44:31] do is make a
[1:44:33] stand and not be a
[1:44:36] wishy-washy believer like these sades
[1:44:39] were when they said ah we can't
[1:44:42] answer then
[1:44:44] Jesus if we do the same then Jesus will
[1:44:48] give us the same answer that he gave the
[1:44:51] Sadducees neither will I answer
[1:44:53] you when you get on your knees and you
[1:44:57] need
[1:44:58] something neither will I answer you
[1:45:01] because you didn't put me first because
[1:45:04] you didn't you didn't surrender to me
[1:45:06] you wanted your
[1:45:09] way so here's your
[1:45:11] way it's yours now you live with
[1:45:15] it or you can
[1:45:17] repent say Lord I've been wrong in one
[1:45:22] thing
[1:45:23] brother the one one right one thing
[1:45:25] about Jesus is no matter how much you
[1:45:28] have done wrong no matter your all of
[1:45:32] your mistakes in the past if you truly
[1:45:36] come before him and you say Lord I'm
[1:45:38] sorry I want your will he will always
[1:45:40] take you back he will always say come
[1:45:43] unto
[1:45:44] me come unto me ye that labor and are
[1:45:48] heavy laden and I will give you rest but
[1:45:50] we have to be able to surrender
[1:45:53] ourselves to him unlike these Pharisees
[1:45:57] and unlike these educated elit not
[1:46:01] against education I have an education
[1:46:03] but the educated Elite who think that
[1:46:05] they are better think that they have a
[1:46:07] better understanding because of their
[1:46:09] moral
[1:46:10] superiority let me tell you moral
[1:46:13] superiority is Jesus Christ follow
[1:46:18] him and then your life is not your own
[1:46:21] as the book of Romans says I think it's
[1:46:23] Romans then you're not your own you give
[1:46:25] your life to the Lord Brother
[1:46:30] Josiah on Christ the
[1:46:33] solid rock I stand all other ground is
[1:46:40] sinking
[1:46:42] sand all other ground is sinking

[1:49:01] this if ye then be risen with
[1:49:04] Christ seek those things which are
[1:49:07] above where Christ sth on the right hand
[1:49:10] of God set your affections on things
[1:49:13] above and not things on the
[1:49:17] earth for you are
[1:49:20] dead and your life is hid with Christ
[1:49:22] Christ in
[1:49:24] God when Christ who is our life shall
[1:49:28] appear then shall ye also appear with
[1:49:30] him in glory that's a promise I'll read
[1:49:34] it again when Christ if you are dead and
[1:49:38] your life is hid with Christ and
[1:49:40] God when Christ who is our life shall
[1:49:44] appear then shall ye also appear with
[1:49:47] him in
[1:49:49] glory
[1:49:50] mortify Therefore your members
[1:49:53] which are upon which are upon Earth put
[1:49:56] to death is what that means put to death
[1:49:59] therefore that which is Earthly in

[1:50:07] you mortify Therefore your members which
[1:50:10] are upon the Earth fornication
[1:50:13] uncleanness inordinate affection evil
[1:50:16] conc concupisent concupisent is
[1:50:20] covetousness I'm sorry is evil
[1:50:23] desire and
[1:50:26] covetousness which is
[1:50:29] idolatry so he's saying that those
[1:50:32] things we say where is idolatry he's
[1:50:34] saying that these things are
[1:50:36] idolatry for which things say sake the
[1:50:39] wrath of God cometh on the children of
[1:50:42] disobedience in the which ye also walked
[1:50:47] sometime I say that's probably me and
[1:50:51] many of you
[1:50:53] yeah I have walked in ungodliness I have
[1:50:55] walked in sin and the Apostle here is
[1:50:57] saying many of you walked that way
[1:51:01] too when you lived in
[1:51:04] them but still we have a
[1:51:07] promise we have a
[1:51:09] [Music]

[1:51:24] brothers and sisters when I believe it

[1:51:36] yourselves from
[1:51:37] idols and I say the same thing in the
[1:51:40] name of Jesus Christ keep yourselves
[1:51:42] from these Idols of the world they will
[1:51:45] do nothing but cause sin in your lives
[1:51:48] you can look at a tree you can look at
[1:51:50] an antill you can look at what whatever
[1:51:52] you want whatever is in this world and
