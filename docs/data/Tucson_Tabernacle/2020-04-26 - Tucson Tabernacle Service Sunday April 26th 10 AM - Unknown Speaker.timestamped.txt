[28:21] people take him at his word and say I'll
[28:24] stand on this we do have some requests
[28:27] to bring to your attention this morning
[28:31] sister Jenny Bouchard if he had not
[28:34] heard she was taken into emergency here
[28:38] a couple of days ago and they found that
[28:41] she had cancer so they put her in in
[28:44] Hospice any more updates she was able to
[28:49] receive visitors at the last information
[28:53] we received but if it's time for her to
[28:56] go home I'm sure that that desire in
[28:59] your heart to be reunited with brother
[29:03] Jerry and not only that but to leave
[29:04] this life to that life that we've all
[29:06] desired the Lord desires to make her
[29:09] whole and make her well then we just
[29:11] believe that be with the family at this
[29:14] time
[29:15] brother Robert Chacon called me
[29:17] yesterday and tomorrow he's to have one
[29:19] more test
[29:21] as they just do the annual test that
[29:24] they do and just said remember that all
[29:26] would be well and then brother Matt
[29:28] forwarded the prayer request for sister
[29:32] Karen Pruitt where the temporalis wife
[29:34] she had been taken to the hospital with
[29:36] a brain bleed they were able to stop it
[29:39] but as the last report they had not
[29:41] determined what was causing that I don't
[29:44] know if there's any updates on that
[29:47] perfect example okay she had a perfect
[29:52] exams so our God is able you know man
[29:56] would look at it we would look at it and
[29:58] there might be some fear some things
[30:00] that would it but if we'll take God at
[30:02] His Word said Lord you said by your
[30:04] stripes we are healed also we just
[30:07] believe that and then brother Matt
[30:09] Watkins and speaking with him
[30:11] yesterday's he mentioned that one of the
[30:14] brothers in their church was tested for
[30:19] the kovat the corona virus and he did
[30:22] come back positive one of the young
[30:24] brothers there and just remember them
[30:26] but also an elderly brother there at the
[30:28] church had gone in and they thought
[30:30] maybe he had the virus he did not test
[30:33] positive for the virus but he was not
[30:36] doing well and he's older single brother
[30:39] who the church is his family and they
[30:42] were not allowing anybody to go in and
[30:44] see him at the time as kind of the
[30:47] conditions of the hospitalization is
[30:49] today so just needing comfort and
[30:52] healing and strength so
[30:54] and I know there are needs everywhere
[30:57] and we we keep them before the Lord and
[31:02] we trusted him but we take him at his
[31:04] word is said by my stripes you were
[31:07] healed it was a finished work done
[31:09] already so we confess that and we
[31:12] believe that today so if you have a need
[31:15] wherever you're at you could even raise
[31:17] your hand there where you're at saying
[31:19] Lord you know my need you know what I
[31:21] have made of and maybe I can even in
[31:24] words explain it but Lord you know the
[31:26] need the root cause the the the
[31:29] situation maybe sometimes you get phone
[31:33] calls and and someone just requests
[31:34] prior but you don't know what the reason
[31:36] is but the God the Lord does so as we
[31:39] bow our heads and speak to him let's
[31:40] believe Lord or whatever we confess them
[31:43] according to your word we can begin to
[31:45] praise you and worship you and accept it
[31:48] as being done Lord we thank you this
[31:50] morning that we do have a source we do
[31:53] have a place to go Lord we don't have to
[31:55] stand in line and be tested and checked
[31:58] before we even allowed to go into to be
[32:01] maybe looked at by a doctor or at a
[32:03] hospital Lord but we can walk right into
[32:05] your presence into that holy holy of
[32:07] Holy's by the shed blood Lord and there
[32:11] speak with you have a have that that
[32:13] intimate conversation with you Lord and
[32:15] it's it's not just words but you go in
[32:17] and you see the spirit you see the
[32:19] motive you see everything that's going
[32:21] on or it even as brother Peter mentioned
[32:23] that you would come in you you would
[32:25] come in the cool of the evening and you
[32:27] would call your children Adam and Eve
[32:28] and you would come in fellowship with
[32:30] them Lord and that has not changed Lord
[32:32] this Sunday morning here Lord that we've
[32:35] gathered together Lord and we're calling
[32:38] on your name but but even more so you've
[32:40] drawn nine to my Lord you know the needs
[32:42] of every heart Lord and maybe not even
[32:45] being able to express it in words today
[32:47] but Lord you look down and we saw it
[32:50] over we heard it over and over and
[32:52] through the tapes Lord through the
[32:53] listening the messages as they would
[32:55] come forth and the angel of Lords to
[32:58] would look into the lives of these
[32:59] people and begin to tell them the cause
[33:01] and the reason what was happening Lord
[33:04] but your word says by your stripes we
[33:06] are healed so we're taking that we're
[33:08] believing that and we're confessing that
[33:10] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[33:13] think Amen just a couple of things to to
[33:17] announce to say brother Arnie and sister
[33:21] Rachel had their 39th anniversary
[33:23] wedding anniversary so we'd like to
[33:26] congratulate them on that and and Lord
[33:30] willing if we're here more if not
[33:33] welcome we'll celebrate that eternal
[33:35] marriage together and then today I know
[33:38] she's listening and I'll hear about it
[33:42] when I get home but today's my wife's
[33:44] birthday I don't know what her age is
[33:47] cuz she won't really tell me except I
[33:50] told her I would give her a dollar for
[33:52] each age so I might get the truth out of
[33:54] her hand today so but thank the Lord for
[33:57] my wife and the blessing she is to me
[34:00] and and the help in the care she is so
[34:03] appreciate that may the Lord bless each
[34:06] one of you and and as we sing just just

[50:17] know that we're coming into living rooms
[50:19] today and into vehicles and and into the
[50:23] church they're also gathered amen and it
[50:25] reminds me so many times of hearing the
[50:27] prophet and as he would speak he would
[50:30] say you there in radioland and you
[50:31] gathered in churches we find ourself in
[50:34] the same exact scenario here and I'm
[50:37] glad that the abiding presence of Jesus
[50:39] is with us no matter where we're at I'm
[50:41] reminded of the quote where the army
[50:44] sent me a brother branham saying that
[50:45] distance means nothing to God and he
[50:48] says some of my greatest miracles that
[50:50] have ever taken place in my ministry
[50:53] were done through telephone amen and so
[50:55] it doesn't matter where you're at today
[50:57] doesn't matter what your situation is in
[51:01] life what you're facing God's Word meets
[51:03] the challenge of the hour and we believe
[51:06] that with all of our hearts

[51:12] come bring your expectation to the Lord

[51:18] chief Shepherd the scripture calls him
[51:20] and we believe that he feeds his sheep
[51:23] and it doesn't matter it doesn't matter
[51:25] who's speaking it takes the the onus off
[51:28] of the man and it puts it on God and I'm
[51:30] thankful to do that today I believe that
[51:32] he has something for you amen and I'm
[51:35] just I'm gonna trust that that that you
[51:38] feel the same today amen so just have an
[51:41] expectation I mean let's just pray
[51:43] before we turn it over to brother
[51:44] Aaron brother Aaron has gathered there
[51:46] in Hickory at Hickory Bible Tabernacle
[51:49] he's able to use and preach straight
[51:51] from there from the pulpit so we're glad
[51:53] for that amen so let's just pray here
[51:55] just for a moment before we begin
[51:57] Heavenly Father were we have joy in our

[52:03] opportunity to worship you
[52:06] serve you father in whatever capacity
[52:09] Lord you've caught us in we just want to
[52:12] be faithful to serve you today we ask
[52:14] God that your word Lord which has
[52:17] transforming power in it Lord brother
[52:20] Aaron has labored he's prayed father
[52:23] he's waited on you Lord as as your
[52:25] servant now God would you come and do
[52:27] the impossible now Lord may you move our
[52:29] brother out of the way Lord is gathered
[52:31] in a building Lord uncle
[52:39] race today
[52:41] anointing power may the unction of the
[52:43] Holy Spirit fallen brother Aaron fall on
[52:46] the church Lord and Tucson lured me here
[52:48] those that are gathered at home Lord may
[52:51] we be connected in another dimension
[52:53] Lord as we pull upon the Word of God I
[52:55] pray for Lord for you to have your
[52:57] perfect way give us liberty we ask in
[53:00] Jesus Christ name Amen amen god bless
[53:03] you amen brother Aaron go
[53:07] praise the Lord hallelujah Maya what a
[53:11] wonderful worship today and the song
[53:14] service I just felt the presence of the
[53:16] Lord just here singing together with my
[53:17] family a great privilege to be gathered
[53:20] together with you as brother Matthew was
[53:22] saying gustin's means nothing to God and
[53:24] we're joined together by the word and I
[53:27] so appreciate the fact that brother
[53:29] Matthew had it on his heart and followed
[53:30] the leadership of the Lord to have me to
[53:33] minister today it's just a wonderful
[53:35] privilege to speak to the bride of Jesus
[53:37] Christ and so we're just going to get
[53:38] right into the word if you want to stand
[53:40] together with me if you have a Bible and
[53:42] I want to be reading from Psalms chapter
[53:45] 105 I want to start with verse 8 and
[53:48] then read to verse 19 Psalms 105 verse 8
[53:53] to verse 19 and we'll read the scripture
[53:56] then just go to the Lord in prayer then
[53:58] if you if it's your custom to stand
[54:00] while the word is reading then we'll
[54:02] have you to be seated but Psalms 105
[54:04] verse 8 and it's talking about how God
[54:07] did wondrous works and I begins this
[54:09] Psalm by saying remember the great works
[54:11] of the Lord and his judgments and all
[54:13] the earth and then I wanted to read this
[54:16] part so that it gets our minds thinking
[54:18] about the Covenant the promise that
[54:19] God's made to us says he hath remembered
[54:21] his covenant forever the word which he
[54:24] commanded to a thousand generations
[54:26] which Covenant he made with Abraham and
[54:29] his oath unto Isaac and confirmed the
[54:32] Same unto Jacob for a law and to Israel
[54:35] for an everlasting covenant saying unto
[54:38] thee will I give the land of Canaan the
[54:40] lot of your inheritance now remember as
[54:43] the bride we don't have a natural
[54:44] inheritance but we have a spiritual
[54:46] inheritance we have a spiritual promised
[54:49] land and he says verse 12 when they were
[54:52] but a few men and number gave very few
[54:54] and strangers in it when they went from
[54:57] one nation to another from one kingdom
[54:59] to another people and this is showing
[55:00] how they went into Egypt he suffered no
[55:03] man to do them wrong a he reproved Kings
[55:06] for their sakes saying touch not my
[55:08] anointed and do my prophets no harm
[55:11] moreover he called for famine upon the
[55:13] land he braked the whole staff of bread
[55:16] and this was where I'll begin to focus
[55:19] later on this morning he sent a man
[55:22] before them even Joseph who was sold for
[55:25] a servant he's just taken us through the
[55:27] narrative of the exodus now and and even
[55:30] what brought them into Egypt and then
[55:31] bringing them out he sent a man before
[55:33] them even Joseph who was sold for a
[55:35] servant whose feet they hurt with
[55:37] fetters he was laid in iron were giving
[55:40] the background of Joseph's story until
[55:42] the time that his word came the word of
[55:45] the Lord tried him and that a wonderful
[55:47] statement till the time that his word
[55:49] came the word of the Lord
[55:50] tried him the king sent and loosed him
[55:53] even the ruler of the people and let him
[55:55] go free he made him Lord of his house
[55:57] and the ruler of all his substance it
[55:59] will just stop there as it begins to go
[56:02] further in this Exodus let's just bow
[56:04] our heads in a word of prayer as we ask
[56:06] God to bless the reading of his word our
[56:08] gracious Heavenly Father is such a
[56:10] wonderful privilege to be gathered
[56:12] together today in your presence Lord
[56:15] not just dining as your guest but we're
[56:17] dining as your bride Lord as a part of
[56:19] your body the very representation of the
[56:22] word on earth and Lord as many are
[56:24] gathered in different settings as
[56:26] brother Matthew has already expressed
[56:27] some may be driving some around the
[56:29] kitchen table around tablets and cell
[56:32] phones and desktop computers whatever it
[56:35] might be Lord we're looking to you now
[56:37] to come and speak to us and take the
[56:39] bread of life and rightly divide it so
[56:41] father I commit myself to you desire
[56:43] them that you just take control of this
[56:46] entire service for your glory may you
[56:48] make sure the technology apart goes well
[56:50] and that the hearing part goes well but
[56:52] more importantly Lord we open up our
[56:54] hearts to hear from you so we ask this
[56:56] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[56:58] amen and then you may be seated I want
[57:01] to begin by reading a statement from the
[57:04] world is falling apart and I was
[57:07] studying about a year ago it's almost
[57:09] exactly a year ago I was starting
[57:11] studying on the subject of being born
[57:12] into war and born into chaos and as a
[57:15] part of that I was listening to the
[57:17] world is falling apart in those
[57:18] different places in the message and
[57:20] Satan's Eden and god of this evil age
[57:22] just to fully understand this world that
[57:24] we've been born into and this statement
[57:27] stood out to me very very profoundly and
[57:29] the Lord just brought it back into my
[57:31] heart yesterday actually Ford the
[57:33] service and it says the whole systems
[57:37] are falling apart something's wrong we
[57:39] want to seriously think of this for the
[57:41] next few minutes just don't enter this
[57:43] now just to say well we've walked over
[57:45] and sat down we had a breakfast we heard
[57:48] testimonies and so forth but let's with
[57:50] all our hearts get down to this and
[57:52] think of it remember it's our life so
[57:56] he's bringing life before us this this
[57:57] isn't just going to church it's not just
[57:59] getting by said this is our life there's
[58:01] nothing no more important than our life
[58:03] there's nothing no more important no
[58:05] matter how much we gain in the world or
[58:07] how great we become here but we got to
[58:10] come to the end of the road
[58:11] that's a telling time we must approach
[58:14] it with all sincerity we know how to do
[58:16] when the people and other times and I
[58:18] want you to really focus it on this
[58:20] particular part right here there's what
[58:23] people in other times when people tried
[58:25] to find some way of survival they went
[58:28] to systems so when it seemed as if
[58:30] survival was necessary or they were
[58:32] coming to a controversy or chaos or or
[58:35] something where they felt like we need
[58:37] to persevere we need to preserve we need
[58:39] to be sustained it says they went to
[58:42] systems so we talked about survival
[58:44] systems in a way of survival and the
[58:46] only way that they can go to any other
[58:49] system than the way that God has laid
[58:51] down is to get away from his word so
[58:54] what he's emphasizing is that when man
[58:56] wanted to survive they went to systems
[58:59] and in order to go to a system they go
[59:01] away from God's provided way in God's
[59:04] provided way to survive is his word so
[59:07] that's what we're wanting you to ponder
[59:08] right now is that there's survival
[59:10] systems and there's man's way of
[59:12] surviving and there's God's way of
[59:14] surviving and it's certainly fine if you
[59:17] want to take what we're talking about
[59:18] now and put it in the context of this
[59:20] great pandemic and all the stay at home
[59:22] orders and the fear of coronavirus it's
[59:24] certainly fine to do that because that's
[59:27] really where the Lord's leading me is to
[59:29] put with taking place right now in a
[59:31] different perspective so he says you
[59:33] have to get away from his word meaning
[59:35] the other men and other ages have done
[59:37] this in times past they've all tried to
[59:39] get away and tried to control the world
[59:42] and make a system of politics in
[59:44] different things to try to control
[59:47] and hold the world together now this is
[59:49] very profound thinking of it in light of
[59:51] the things that are happening now and
[59:52] they in order to do that they have to
[59:55] get away from God's plan of doing it God
[59:59] has a way of keeping this thing together
[1:00:01] what a beautiful reminder God has a way
[1:00:04] of keeping this thing together and the
[1:00:06] only way that men can ever adopt some
[1:00:09] other way he has to get away from the
[1:00:12] original way with those words just
[1:00:16] ringing in your ears right now and
[1:00:18] hopefully just pumping something into
[1:00:20] your heart and thrilling something in
[1:00:22] your soul the God has a way of survival
[1:00:25] and that way is his word there is no
[1:00:29] other way of survival there's no other
[1:00:30] systems he says God has a way of keeping
[1:00:33] this thing together
[1:00:35] so there could be systems of politics
[1:00:38] and different things to control and hold
[1:00:40] the world together and they get together
[1:00:42] to do that he says they get away from
[1:00:43] God's plan and so I have a question to
[1:00:46] ask you today and that's the title of my
[1:00:48] sermon and so this next question I'm
[1:00:51] about to ask is the title so I don't
[1:00:53] want you to think I'm changing the
[1:00:54] subject at all but my title is what are
[1:00:56] you looking at and I know that I was
[1:00:59] talking to you face-to-face that might
[1:01:01] get a little bit confusing it says well
[1:01:02] I'm looking at you I'm wanting to know
[1:01:04] what your title is brother Aaron but
[1:01:05] that is my title what are you looking at
[1:01:07] what is it that we're viewing what is it
[1:01:09] we're hearing what is it we're saying if
[1:01:11] we're looking at something are we really
[1:01:13] seeing what is there if we're hearing
[1:01:14] something
[1:01:15] are we really hearing what is actually
[1:01:17] they're not just seeing without looking
[1:01:19] and understanding and comprehending not
[1:01:21] just listing without really hearing and
[1:01:23] understanding because we've got to
[1:01:25] understand in this hour that we live in
[1:01:27] and we want to know God's way of doing
[1:01:29] something and in Isaiah chapter 33
[1:01:32] verses 5 & 6 this scripture has meant
[1:01:34] more to me over the last month or so
[1:01:36] month and a half than ever says the Lord
[1:01:39] has exalted for he dwelleth on high he
[1:01:42] hath filled Zion with judgment and
[1:01:44] righteousness and as we read in Psalms
[1:01:45] 105 it says he is the Lord our God his
[1:01:48] judgments are in all the earth and so we
[1:01:50] see some continuity with our text and
[1:01:53] this scripture here in Isaiah 33 says
[1:01:56] and wisdom and knowledge shall be the
[1:01:59] stability of light
[1:02:00] so in an uncertain time in a time when
[1:02:03] we're not sure what the next week will
[1:02:05] hold or what certain parameters are
[1:02:07] gonna be placed upon us there's a lot of
[1:02:09] talk about it we'll never go back to the
[1:02:11] way it was before and we have to
[1:02:12] anticipate a new normal
[1:02:14] listen it doesn't matter what unfolds in
[1:02:16] this natural world
[1:02:18] the Bible's tell us that wisdom and
[1:02:20] knowledge shall be the stability of thy
[1:02:22] times and strength of salvation so the
[1:02:26] stability of our times and the strength
[1:02:28] of our salvation is connected with
[1:02:30] wisdom and knowledge and it says the
[1:02:33] fear of the Lord is his treasure
[1:02:34] so our treasure is the fear of God not a
[1:02:38] fear of the circumstances not a fear of
[1:02:40] the condition of our times out of fear
[1:02:42] of the future but our treasure
[1:02:44] the real gold that we have is our fear
[1:02:46] of the Lord and wisdom and knowledge are
[1:02:49] the source of our stability and the
[1:02:52] source or our safety during this time
[1:02:55] wisdom and knowledge shall be the
[1:02:56] strength of thy salvation wisdom and
[1:02:59] knowledge shall be the stability of
[1:03:01] their times so we have a wisdom and we
[1:03:04] have a knowledge that is our stability
[1:03:06] we have a wisdom and we have a knowledge
[1:03:09] that is our safety that is our strength
[1:03:10] and brother Branham when he preached the
[1:03:13] rapture message he took Psalms 27 and he
[1:03:16] brings it out beautifully the Lord he is
[1:03:18] the strength of my life he who whom
[1:03:21] shall I be afraid the Lord is the
[1:03:22] strength of our salvation the Lord is my
[1:03:25] light and my salvation whom shall I fear
[1:03:27] so the Lord is that source of wisdom the
[1:03:30] Lord is that source of life he is that
[1:03:32] knowledge that is our safety during
[1:03:34] difficult times and our faith can only
[1:03:38] rest in the Word of God and I I want to
[1:03:42] just maybe emphasize this in a very
[1:03:45] direct way so that you catch what we're
[1:03:47] pinpointing right now is faith can only
[1:03:51] rest in the word believing the wrong
[1:03:54] thing is not faith you can be convinced
[1:03:57] of something you can absolutely believe
[1:03:59] it you can sell yourself out to it you
[1:04:01] can trust in it you can depend upon it
[1:04:03] as it were but that's not the faith that
[1:04:05] our that we are that we have as
[1:04:08] believers it's not the faith that rests
[1:04:10] upon the Word of God if you really
[1:04:12] believe in something that's a lie that's
[1:04:14] really not
[1:04:14] in reality it's actually doubt in
[1:04:17] reality it's unbelief because you're
[1:04:19] believing something that's not true
[1:04:21] so if we believe or trust in something
[1:04:23] that isn't certain that isn't sure then
[1:04:26] it can only breed ultimately a lack of
[1:04:28] confidence for trusted in something that
[1:04:30] isn't true that isn't trustworthy it's
[1:04:33] only going to make us uncertainty
[1:04:34] because what we're trusting in fails us
[1:04:36] and if we have a certain expectation
[1:04:38] that the economy is going to be a
[1:04:40] certain way or that governments are
[1:04:41] going to be a certain way or that the
[1:04:43] health care system is going to be a
[1:04:44] certain way or the stimulus is going to
[1:04:46] be a certain way those things can let us
[1:04:48] down and because we trusted in it we
[1:04:50] only begin to doubt it if somebody ever
[1:04:52] promised you that they were going to do
[1:04:54] something and they don't do it then the
[1:04:55] next time they promise you something
[1:04:57] that trust hasn't breed a bread in you
[1:05:00] more trust it actually a cautious and
[1:05:02] uncertain is this really gonna happen is
[1:05:04] he really going to do what he said
[1:05:06] proverbs chapter 25 verse 19 says
[1:05:08] confidence in an unfaithful man in the
[1:05:11] time of trouble is like a broken tooth
[1:05:14] and a foot out of joint
[1:05:15] my goodness ponder that when you trust
[1:05:18] in someone who's unfaithful when it
[1:05:20] comes to the time that you really need
[1:05:22] them he says it's like a broken tooth or
[1:05:24] foot out a joint trusting and ally will
[1:05:27] fail you trusting in a make-believe or
[1:05:29] trusting in something that's not true
[1:05:31] trusting in just an opinion will fail
[1:05:33] you it can't provide the support or the
[1:05:35] stability that you need or the strength
[1:05:37] that you need in the moment that you
[1:05:39] need it so think about that deeply in
[1:05:42] your hearts even in light of the
[1:05:43] circumstances that we're in right now
[1:05:45] confidence in an unfaithful man when you
[1:05:48] need them the most in a time of trouble
[1:05:50] and a time of uncertainty is like a
[1:05:52] broken tooth it may bother you and it
[1:05:55] may have a lot of pain but then as soon
[1:05:57] as you go to use it and rely upon it to
[1:05:59] do what it's supposed to do
[1:06:00] it fails you and it will not produce the
[1:06:02] outcome you need it's like a foot out of
[1:06:04] joint as soon as you put that weight
[1:06:06] upon it you may experience pain but when
[1:06:08] you go to step on it you go to use it to
[1:06:10] push yourself forward it's going to fail
[1:06:12] you and cons you to stumble and the
[1:06:14] Bible's treating a very beautiful
[1:06:15] picture here confidence in an unfaithful
[1:06:17] man if I could put it this way confident
[1:06:20] or trust in the wrong kind of teaching
[1:06:22] or the wrong kind of understanding or
[1:06:24] the wrong kind of wisdom cannot inspire
[1:06:27] faith but it
[1:06:28] only produced doubt in uncertainty in
[1:06:31] fear confidence in an unfaithful man in
[1:06:34] the time of trouble is like a broken
[1:06:35] tooth and a foot out of joint the wrong
[1:06:38] kind of teaching cannot inspire faith so
[1:06:41] and maybe I'll just interject this it
[1:06:44] just creates an uncertainty I sincere
[1:06:47] but misguided teaching sincere misguided
[1:06:50] opinions can breed uncertainty even
[1:06:53] though it's trying to encourage your
[1:06:55] lift you up as a matter of fact as I was
[1:06:58] pondering this and even ministered on it
[1:06:59] recently if we were to take the
[1:07:01] scripture and try to preach that because
[1:07:03] you have the Holy Ghost you don't have
[1:07:05] to worry about an infectious disease or
[1:07:06] because you have the Holy Ghost you
[1:07:08] don't have to worry about covet 19 my
[1:07:11] purpose in doing that may be to give you
[1:07:13] the faith to not fear covin 19 but I
[1:07:16] actually create doubt and uncertainty in
[1:07:19] your own experience because by preaching
[1:07:21] that I get you to think well if I have
[1:07:24] the Holy Ghost I won't get this virus
[1:07:26] and I'm trying to build your confidence
[1:07:28] but then you think well I guess this is
[1:07:30] going to be another test of whether or
[1:07:32] not I have the Holy Ghost if I don't get
[1:07:34] coronavirus then I'll know I have the
[1:07:37] Holy Ghost listen that's not the way
[1:07:38] that we think that's not the way that we
[1:07:40] function that's not the way we operate
[1:07:42] your venturing into a realm of
[1:07:44] uncertainty your venturing into a realm
[1:07:46] of self interpretation and you actually
[1:07:48] create more uncertainty and you produce
[1:07:50] another evidence of what the Holy Ghost
[1:07:52] is and we get away from what we know to
[1:07:55] be certain in the message what is the
[1:07:57] evidence of the Holy Ghost so we must be
[1:08:00] if we're going to have the right kind of
[1:08:02] faith in this hour we must be looking at
[1:08:05] the right thing we must be hearing the
[1:08:07] right thing if we're gonna have faith we
[1:08:10] have to see the right thing
[1:08:11] so I'm asking what are you looking at
[1:08:13] brother Branham says in the message one
[1:08:15] in a million
[1:08:16] he says the time and hour that we're
[1:08:18] living in if a person don't know which
[1:08:20] way to go or what to do or how to turn
[1:08:22] you're not walking by faith anymore
[1:08:24] you're just guessing you are presuming
[1:08:27] she's and presume is to advance without
[1:08:30] official Authority so we don't want to
[1:08:32] go forward in the time that we're living
[1:08:34] and we don't want to advance ever in our
[1:08:36] Christian life on presumption or
[1:08:39] assumptions or opinions or
[1:08:40] interpretations of man
[1:08:41] we must know exactly where we're
[1:08:44] advancing to presume is to advance
[1:08:46] without official Authority so if we
[1:08:49] haven't got the real official authority
[1:08:51] to know what God has said would take
[1:08:53] place in this hour how are you ever
[1:08:55] gonna face this hour now think of how
[1:08:57] easy it is for us to try to take
[1:08:59] scriptures and quotes and use them or
[1:09:02] try to interpret them by the things that
[1:09:04] are taking place in the world today
[1:09:05] because we have all these modern events
[1:09:07] I'm going to take the situations we're
[1:09:09] facing now and use the modern events to
[1:09:12] understand the Word of God to understand
[1:09:14] the Bible to understand the message and
[1:09:16] he's and in doing that we're really
[1:09:18] advancing without official Authority and
[1:09:21] how are we going to know what's taking
[1:09:23] place in this hour to know how to face
[1:09:25] this hour unless we stick with what is
[1:09:27] certain what the word has already told
[1:09:29] us we've got to face it knowing by faith
[1:09:33] in his word the things that's supposed
[1:09:34] to be happening now so there's something
[1:09:36] that has happened that gives us the
[1:09:39] faith and the wisdom and the knowledge
[1:09:40] to face the time that we're living in
[1:09:42] now something has already been given to
[1:09:46] allow us to face what is happening now
[1:09:48] it's the very thing that brother Branham
[1:09:49] is expressing to us if you're not
[1:09:51] walking if you're not walking by faith
[1:09:53] and you're just guessing then you don't
[1:09:55] have official authority and you can't
[1:09:57] really face the hour so he's preaching
[1:10:00] this one in a million it's a part of a
[1:10:02] series of little sermons he was preached
[1:10:04] and I believe on the air in Los Angeles
[1:10:06] so he's saying that you've got to know
[1:10:07] the time we're living in something's
[1:10:09] supposed to be happening now the
[1:10:11] conditions of the nations the conditions
[1:10:12] of the people the condition of the
[1:10:14] church and so forth we've got to know
[1:10:16] that and then how to walk out to face it
[1:10:18] if you don't know how to do that you
[1:10:20] just what we used to call kind of
[1:10:22] haphazardly just jump in and hoping
[1:10:24] it'll be there hoping this and hoping
[1:10:25] that and it will be and will it be and
[1:10:28] God don't want us to do that he wants us
[1:10:31] to know what he has said about this day
[1:10:34] he wants us to know what has been said
[1:10:36] about this day not speculated not
[1:10:38] opinion not interpretation but what is
[1:10:40] he said about this day and then meet it
[1:10:42] by faith how can you do that how do you
[1:10:44] meet this day by faith when you know
[1:10:46] what he said about this day when you
[1:10:48] know what he has said about this day
[1:10:49] then you can meet it by faith we want to
[1:10:52] know what he is said about this day then
[1:10:54] meet it by faith
[1:10:55] because he said it would be that way
[1:10:56] then you know then we know you are truth
[1:10:59] then because you haven't got some
[1:11:01] person's word for it when you've got
[1:11:02] God's word for it then you know what the
[1:11:04] truth is you've got his word of what we
[1:11:06] must do so we want God's word of what we
[1:11:09] must do now with that as a foundation
[1:11:13] here as I as I'm expressing this and
[1:11:16] laying this out there kind of just
[1:11:18] laying this as a as a foundation to go
[1:11:23] further now let me think about these let
[1:11:25] me just raise some things into our mind
[1:11:28] and get us pondering some of these
[1:11:29] things for a moment because he's talking
[1:11:31] about facing this day Isaiah 33 is
[1:11:34] talking about the stability of side
[1:11:36] times and saw proverbs 25 is talked
[1:11:38] about in a time of trouble we're living
[1:11:40] in a time of trouble we're living in
[1:11:41] perilous times or living in a time of
[1:11:43] great calamity and as we think about the
[1:11:47] day that we're facing the hour that were
[1:11:49] living in brother brems saying how are
[1:11:50] we ever gonna face this hour we've never
[1:11:53] lived in a day like this I was talking
[1:11:56] to a client of mine over the past week
[1:11:57] or so and as a young young child he
[1:12:00] lived in the UK during World War two and
[1:12:03] he said that he faced the bombings and
[1:12:05] the hear of the sirens and he lived in
[1:12:07] that time and he lives in West Vancouver
[1:12:09] now and he said Erin this is this is
[1:12:12] worse than what I experienced as a child
[1:12:14] in World War two he's in his 80s said
[1:12:16] this is worse than what I experienced
[1:12:18] then why because he's facing he's facing
[1:12:22] something that he's never faced before
[1:12:24] if there were sirens in war maybe he'd
[1:12:26] have a point of reference but now he's
[1:12:28] got no point of reference to how
[1:12:30] different his life is right now and so
[1:12:33] we've never lived in a day like this
[1:12:35] and so the prognosticators and the
[1:12:37] economists and the scientist and and the
[1:12:40] healthcare industry they're all trying
[1:12:41] to find a point of reference and what
[1:12:44] can we compare this to because we want
[1:12:46] to understand what's happening and
[1:12:47] there's two points of reference that are
[1:12:50] often used to understand our current
[1:12:52] circumstances two points of reference in
[1:12:54] the past and I'm using this very
[1:12:57] deliberately now and this really forms
[1:12:59] kind of the inspiration of what I'm
[1:13:01] wanting to share with you just take
[1:13:02] something very simple from history to
[1:13:04] get us to think about what you're
[1:13:06] looking at what we're pondering what
[1:13:08] we're considering and so two points of
[1:13:10] reference let me refer to the first
[1:13:12] point of reference and it has to do with
[1:13:14] the the scientific things that we're
[1:13:16] facing in the the disease that we're
[1:13:18] facing and so you have a pandemic
[1:13:20] standpoint from a pandemic standpoint
[1:13:22] from an infectious disease standpoint a
[1:13:25] lot of scientists and the ones who are
[1:13:28] looking into this
[1:13:29] the nature of this disease that we're
[1:13:30] facing right now they used the Spanish
[1:13:33] flu as a comparison now the Spanish flu
[1:13:35] spread widely throughout the world in
[1:13:37] 1918 to 1920 some say that it actually
[1:13:41] began in 1916 but it began to widely
[1:13:43] spread in 1918 interestingly enough
[1:13:47] there's a study several years ago that
[1:13:48] came out that concluded that the Spanish
[1:13:51] flu began in New York and they're
[1:13:53] actually showing early signs of an
[1:13:55] outbreak in Kansas near a an army base
[1:13:58] in the January of 1918 and then the
[1:14:01] first reported case in the United States
[1:14:02] was on an army base later that spring in
[1:14:05] Kansas but through investigations and
[1:14:08] looking at certain numbers and data they
[1:14:09] feel it probably begin to spread in 1916
[1:14:12] and this is what scientists and even the
[1:14:15] media and a lot of us are going back and
[1:14:16] looking at the Spanish flu to even
[1:14:18] understand the sheer numbers and the
[1:14:20] impact of kovat nineteen and a third of
[1:14:23] the population in those days from 1918
[1:14:27] to 1920 was infected by the Spanish flu
[1:14:31] as I had 500 million a half a billion
[1:14:34] people infected by the Spanish flu at
[1:14:37] least fifty million people worldwide
[1:14:39] died because of the Spanish flu in the
[1:14:42] United States alone six hundred and
[1:14:44] seventy five thousand Americans died as
[1:14:46] a result of the Spanish flu now we can
[1:14:48] take our numbers in our data today and
[1:14:50] say well we've had about 50,000 died now
[1:14:52] six hundred and seventy five thousand
[1:14:55] died then and this is how much we
[1:14:56] anticipate will die and so they're
[1:14:58] comparing the spread of the Spanish flu
[1:15:00] to the time that we're living in now to
[1:15:03] understand the data to understand the
[1:15:05] numbers so that's a point of reference
[1:15:07] from a pandemic standpoint from an
[1:15:10] economic standpoint that the the things
[1:15:12] that we're seeing transpire in our life
[1:15:15] right now from an economic standpoint
[1:15:17] they say we have no other point of
[1:15:19] reference than the great
[1:15:20] depression and the Great Depression
[1:15:22] unfolded from 1929 to 1939 and with what
[1:15:26] we're facing now our current current
[1:15:28] economic situation is so stupendous or
[1:15:31] staggering that the economists and the
[1:15:34] rioters and and those that are tweeting
[1:15:36] and those that are blogging those are
[1:15:37] doing podcasted everybody is saying we
[1:15:39] don't have anything else we can compare
[1:15:41] the unemployment to than the
[1:15:43] unemployment of the Great Depression we
[1:15:45] don't have any market shifts to compare
[1:15:47] this to than the the market shifts of
[1:15:49] the Great Depression and this Great
[1:15:52] Depression some of the worst years I
[1:15:54] think they're pretty definitive about
[1:15:55] this the worst years of the Great
[1:15:58] Depression were 1931 1932 in 1933 during
[1:16:03] the Great Depression
[1:16:04] industrial production fell almost 50%
[1:16:07] they say that homebuilding dropped by
[1:16:09] 80% that in 1933 alone unemployment rose
[1:16:14] to 25% I think it was like the
[1:16:16] high-water mark of unemployment in 1933
[1:16:19] 25 percent of the American population
[1:16:21] was unemployed there was 15 million
[1:16:24] people over 15 million people unemployed
[1:16:28] 5,000 banks closed over all during the
[1:16:32] Great Depression and in 1933 alone four
[1:16:35] thousand banks closed during the Great
[1:16:37] Depression it is said by many that it
[1:16:40] was the worst hard time these are people
[1:16:43] that endured even moving out west and
[1:16:46] settling and digging up land that had
[1:16:49] never been farmed before and all the
[1:16:51] travails of pioneering the west and and
[1:16:53] facing even the uncertainty and
[1:16:55] difficulty of a world war these are
[1:16:57] people who had lived through something I
[1:16:58] had lived even through diseases before
[1:17:01] and even had lived in the Spanish flu
[1:17:03] and they're saying hey this is the worst
[1:17:05] hard time and even the the drought that
[1:17:08] came in the Midwest and things that were
[1:17:10] transpiring in Kansas and the panhandles
[1:17:12] of Oklahoma and Texas and even in
[1:17:15] Colorado it produced circumstances and
[1:17:17] situations that were so tried and so
[1:17:19] terrible they said this is the worst
[1:17:20] hard time there's ever been and so now
[1:17:24] as we live there are great speculation
[1:17:27] about our current social climate there's
[1:17:30] great speculation about our current
[1:17:32] economic conditions
[1:17:33] and there's a lot of uncertainty how are
[1:17:36] things going to be going forward in
[1:17:37] light of the corona virus how are things
[1:17:38] going to go forward in light of our
[1:17:40] economic crisis and so we're drawing our
[1:17:43] comparisons from what has been what has
[1:17:46] happened in the Spanish flu what
[1:17:47] happened during the Great Depression can
[1:17:49] we use those things to understand the
[1:17:51] time we're living we're living in now
[1:17:52] and I want to say this before I go
[1:17:54] forward it depends on what you're
[1:17:56] looking at whether or not you're going
[1:17:57] to get something that's really useful
[1:17:59] because our greatest danger in times
[1:18:02] like these it's not the infectious
[1:18:04] disease it's not even the economic
[1:18:06] uncertainty or even economic difficulty
[1:18:08] now I'm speaking to the elect our
[1:18:10] greatest danger is not the disease
[1:18:12] itself our greatest danger is not the
[1:18:14] economy itself because we're not just
[1:18:17] merely Americans that are trying to
[1:18:19] endure this great impact of a pandemic
[1:18:22] we're not just Americans or Congolese or
[1:18:24] we're not just we're not just Canadians
[1:18:28] whatever it might be however you would
[1:18:29] identify yourself we're not just human
[1:18:31] beings enduring a crisis and trying to
[1:18:34] make it through government government
[1:18:36] restrictions as the bride of Jesus
[1:18:38] Christ we have a different identity as
[1:18:40] the bride of Jesus Christ we have a
[1:18:43] different promise as a matter of fact I
[1:18:45] would go so far to say that is the bride
[1:18:47] of Jesus Christ we are governed and
[1:18:49] moved by a greater law that we're not
[1:18:51] just merely subject to a governmental
[1:18:54] restrictions you ever stay at home or do
[1:18:55] you have a social distancing of six feet
[1:18:58] listen we've been under social
[1:18:59] distancing as the elect for a very very
[1:19:01] long time because we've been told it as
[1:19:03] a believer you've got to separate
[1:19:05] yourself from your worldly friends
[1:19:06] because they only call you back into the
[1:19:08] world again we've had a healthy fear and
[1:19:11] a healthy reservation of social media
[1:19:14] we've applied the token to our homes and
[1:19:16] kicked the television out listen we've
[1:19:18] been social distancing from the very
[1:19:20] moment that God has called us into this
[1:19:21] blessed truth why because the Bible says
[1:19:24] brother Branham said that when we caught
[1:19:25] we heard that Eagle scream we heard from
[1:19:27] our theophany we left the other thing
[1:19:30] why we have been governed by a greater
[1:19:32] law for a long time we're not just
[1:19:35] merely governed by the economic we're
[1:19:37] not governed by the physical as we
[1:19:39] believe right now many of us are doing
[1:19:41] it rightfully and we're doing it
[1:19:43] respectfully we're rendering under
[1:19:45] Caesar Caesar's but listen we must
[1:19:47] always
[1:19:47] and unto God God's we don't just merely
[1:19:51] render unto Caesar but the Bible tells
[1:19:53] us the very same scripture we're using
[1:19:54] right now to stay at home to social
[1:19:56] distance to not have the congregation
[1:19:58] assemble together says that we're gonna
[1:20:00] render under Caesar Caesars but we must
[1:20:02] also render under God God's when he
[1:20:06] asked us to do we must also do for him
[1:20:08] and the danger is I'm really coming to
[1:20:11] my thesis here my real the real fest of
[1:20:13] my inspiration the real danger as I
[1:20:16] mentioned a moment ago is not the
[1:20:17] disease it's not the economy the danger
[1:20:19] is if we're not careful if we're not
[1:20:21] diligent we will only be hearing what
[1:20:24] the world hears ponder this if we're not
[1:20:27] careful if we're not diligent we'll only
[1:20:29] be seen what the world is seeing what
[1:20:33] will we hear what everyone else is
[1:20:34] hearing we'll only see what everyone
[1:20:36] else does see we're going to the same
[1:20:37] world don't meet or we're going to John
[1:20:38] Hopkins we're going to this blog we're
[1:20:40] going to this podcast we're what
[1:20:42] following this person on Twitter we're
[1:20:43] listening to the news we're consuming
[1:20:45] all the data we can we're catching our
[1:20:47] governors announcements in the afternoon
[1:20:49] what's what's the latest on kovat 19
[1:20:51] what's the latest response what's the
[1:20:53] latest data telling us and if we're not
[1:20:55] careful that's all we're hearing but let
[1:20:57] me take it a step further that the bride
[1:21:00] with the bride is looking at what the
[1:21:02] bride is listening to is different than
[1:21:05] what everyone else is seeing and what is
[1:21:06] different than whatever else is hearing
[1:21:08] and let me put it in this context as the
[1:21:11] bride of Jesus Christ we're not just
[1:21:14] listening to the data and the numbers if
[1:21:16] they say 500 people got sick in North
[1:21:18] Carolina yesterday then the whole world
[1:21:19] can hear that and understand the data of
[1:21:21] it but we're not just merely listening
[1:21:24] to the numbers we're here in a different
[1:21:25] voice something totally different than
[1:21:28] the data and the information and the
[1:21:29] noise that's out there but let me make
[1:21:32] this even a little bit more personal
[1:21:33] we're not even listening to the same
[1:21:35] thing that nominal Christians are
[1:21:36] listening to every pulpit right now is
[1:21:41] preaching some of the same things all
[1:21:44] around the world and when I say every
[1:21:46] pulpit I'm not referring only to message
[1:21:48] pulpits I'm referring to every home
[1:21:51] Bible study every home meeting you go
[1:21:54] online you'll see that the Pentecostal
[1:21:56] churches are doing services like this
[1:21:57] the Lutheran Church the Baptist Church
[1:21:59] every single
[1:22:00] nation every independent every
[1:22:02] nondenominational are all gathering
[1:22:04] within their homes they're doing
[1:22:06] sunday-school zoom meetings they're
[1:22:07] doing living-room specials they're doing
[1:22:10] all sorts of things to keep the body
[1:22:12] together to keep the dynamics of church
[1:22:15] continuing and many of the preachers in
[1:22:17] the world today nominal even message
[1:22:19] believers are preaching this thing so
[1:22:21] I'm not trying to make a distinction on
[1:22:22] the subject matter we're all hearing the
[1:22:24] same thing because every pulpit is
[1:22:26] preaching about the Exodus you're in
[1:22:29] many many ministers today out even in
[1:22:31] the nominal world and even we as message
[1:22:33] believers myself included our pastor
[1:22:35] included we're looking at the Exodus as
[1:22:37] a point of reference for what we're
[1:22:38] going through now and we're hearing
[1:22:40] Exodus chapter 7 through 13 we're
[1:22:42] hearing about the plagues that afflicted
[1:22:44] Egypt we're hearing about how the the
[1:22:46] children of Israel had liked in their
[1:22:48] dwellings during the time of the plague
[1:22:50] of darkness we're hearing about how
[1:22:52] there was a token that was applied to
[1:22:53] keep them from the plague of death and
[1:22:55] he's a lot of the themes that are being
[1:22:57] rehearsed in everyone's ears right now
[1:22:59] second chronicles chapter 7 verses 13
[1:23:02] and 14 is is read a lot right now let me
[1:23:05] just read it to you and this is the
[1:23:06] light that the nominal world is putting
[1:23:08] it in second chronicles chapter 7 verse
[1:23:11] 13 if I shut up the heaven that there be
[1:23:13] no rain and they're saying look at what
[1:23:15] was happening in Australia there was
[1:23:16] wildfires in Australia there's
[1:23:18] unprecedented droughts that's causing a
[1:23:20] human a crisis of humanity in Australia
[1:23:24] and says and or if I command the locusts
[1:23:27] to devour the land and it's a great epic
[1:23:30] of locusts are sweeping through Africa
[1:23:33] and this is something that's catching
[1:23:35] everyone's attention minders droughts in
[1:23:37] Australia's locust sweeping through the
[1:23:38] land he says where if I send the
[1:23:40] pestilence among my people and so you
[1:23:42] say well wild powers fires in a drought
[1:23:44] in Australia locusts in Africa now a
[1:23:46] pestilence or disease that comes upon
[1:23:48] the entire world all the people well
[1:23:50] this gets everybody's attention drought
[1:23:52] locusts now a disease says if my people
[1:23:54] which are called by my name shall humble
[1:23:56] themselves and pray and seek my face and
[1:23:58] turn from their wicked ways then will I
[1:24:00] hear from heaven and will forgive their
[1:24:02] sin and will hear their land all the
[1:24:04] pulpits in the world are probably
[1:24:06] preaching from this scripture most
[1:24:08] ministers maybe a majority of preachers
[1:24:10] in the world today have caught this
[1:24:12] this connection and you know what many
[1:24:14] men of God within the message who are
[1:24:15] the true voice of God in this age to the
[1:24:18] elect to build them up in the faith
[1:24:19] they're taking these things and using
[1:24:21] them they're appropriately to help us
[1:24:23] and to encourage us but listen we can't
[1:24:25] just be hearing the same thing the world
[1:24:27] is hearing many are hearing Psalms 91
[1:24:31] and I think that scriptures probably
[1:24:33] been used more now than there ever has
[1:24:35] been used before how that there's
[1:24:37] pestilence and the snare of the Fowler
[1:24:39] and the noise and pestilence and
[1:24:41] pestilence that walketh in darkness and
[1:24:42] destruction that wasteth at noonday but
[1:24:44] it won't come 90 if you make the LORD
[1:24:47] thy God thy habitation of the evil
[1:24:49] befall thee no plague shall come nigh
[1:24:51] thy dwelling and it's talking about that
[1:24:54] all those different verses there in
[1:24:56] Psalms 91 are being used to encourage us
[1:24:58] rightfully because it's the Word of God
[1:25:00] but it's also being used in the nominal
[1:25:02] world Psalms 91 is being used by more
[1:25:04] people around the world today than it's
[1:25:05] ever been used before perhaps and then a
[1:25:08] lot of people are preaching from Isaiah
[1:25:09] 26 this one is a very interesting one
[1:25:12] and verse 20 come my people enter thou
[1:25:15] into thy chambers enter thou into thy
[1:25:17] house is what one translation renders it
[1:25:18] as and shut thy doors about thee hide
[1:25:20] thyself as it were for a little moment
[1:25:22] until the indignation of the wrath be
[1:25:25] over past here's a scripture that we
[1:25:27] could use even to encourage believers
[1:25:29] the Bible tells you there's a time when
[1:25:30] you have to go to your homes you can
[1:25:32] have a stay at home order shelter in
[1:25:33] place as the language used in some
[1:25:35] states closer nor hide yourself for a
[1:25:37] little while until this time this
[1:25:39] indication this disease or whatever the
[1:25:40] uncertainty is until it be over passed
[1:25:42] and that scriptures being used and then
[1:25:45] there's also other scriptures in Matthew
[1:25:47] chapter 24 where it speaks of
[1:25:49] pestilences and famines in Luke chapter
[1:25:50] 21 and plagues such but there shall be
[1:25:53] famines and pestilence and earthquakes
[1:25:54] and diverse places talking about how
[1:25:56] that there's going to be a Great
[1:25:58] Tribulation that's never been seen
[1:25:59] before Luke chapter 21 men's hearts
[1:26:02] failing them for fear for the things
[1:26:03] which are coming on the earth these are
[1:26:05] the scriptures that are being used right
[1:26:07] now over every pulpit in the world
[1:26:11] perhaps and I know I'm speculating
[1:26:13] because I haven't taken the time or last
[1:26:15] few weeks to listen to every sermon over
[1:26:16] every pulpit so maybe just give me the
[1:26:18] the latitude there a little bit to
[1:26:20] speculate that these things are being
[1:26:21] preached over most pulpits but I want to
[1:26:23] just point out there
[1:26:24] we're hearing these things in
[1:26:25] denominational realms we're hearing them
[1:26:27] properly placed even within the message
[1:26:29] and I want to emphasize with the voice
[1:26:31] that's coming with these scriptures that
[1:26:33] we must be seeing something different
[1:26:35] than what the nominal person is hearing
[1:26:37] we must be seeing something different
[1:26:39] than what the world is seen when they
[1:26:41] look at these scriptures we must be
[1:26:43] hearing something different when these
[1:26:45] things that rehearsed in our ears
[1:26:46] because even if we go to some of these
[1:26:49] scriptures there's things that we can
[1:26:50] begin to point out even in Psalm 91 in
[1:26:52] 2nd chronicles 7 Isaiah 26 and I'll just
[1:26:56] start here in Matthew chapter 24 let me
[1:26:58] commend you for having a wonderful pull
[1:27:00] and attentiveness to the Word of God
[1:27:02] your pastor brother Matthew can attest
[1:27:04] to this you can sense a pull on the Word
[1:27:06] of God as you minister even in a
[1:27:08] sanctuary that's nearly empty air is all
[1:27:10] empty except for my family today in
[1:27:13] living rooms that maybe it's just you
[1:27:15] you there's a pool in the Word of God
[1:27:17] the man of God can feel that and let me
[1:27:19] commend you and thank you for that the
[1:27:21] wonderful expectation and pool you have
[1:27:23] on the word but let me look at Matthew
[1:27:25] chapter 24 right in the middle of all
[1:27:27] these things about famines and plagues
[1:27:29] and pestilences and those things it says
[1:27:32] for wheresoever verse 28 for wheresoever
[1:27:34] the carcase is there will the eagle's be
[1:27:36] gathered together you read Matthew
[1:27:38] chapter 24 hundred times say lo he's
[1:27:40] here lo he's there could it be this this
[1:27:42] is it here it is there it is hid this is
[1:27:44] it we have a word right there in the
[1:27:46] midst of Matthew 24 in a time of
[1:27:47] pestilence and famines right there a
[1:27:50] time of earthquakes
[1:27:51] we're not gathered to the the need in
[1:27:53] the famine we're not gathered to the
[1:27:54] reality of the earthquake
[1:27:56] we're not gathered to those things right
[1:27:57] in the middle that comes is where the
[1:27:59] carcass is there the Eagles are gathered
[1:28:01] they're not gathered around the news
[1:28:03] what's happening with the earthquakes
[1:28:04] what's happening with the famines what's
[1:28:06] happening to the pestilence right in the
[1:28:07] time of all that there's a gathering
[1:28:08] that's taking place and a time reverence
[1:28:11] is low he's here low he's there the
[1:28:12] Eagles are gathered to the carcass and
[1:28:14] what are we taught and anointed ones at
[1:28:15] the end time brother man said the son of
[1:28:17] man is Christ says in another place he
[1:28:20] is those seals he's the one that opened
[1:28:21] those seals says the son of man is
[1:28:23] Christ he's the one that you're feeding
[1:28:25] on why because we're the carcasses
[1:28:27] they're the Eagles will be gathered
[1:28:28] you're not feeding on a man a man his
[1:28:31] words will fail but you're feeding on
[1:28:33] the unfailing body word of the
[1:28:35] man that's what we're feeding on today
[1:28:38] why because in the midst of famines and
[1:28:39] earthquakes and pestilences there's been
[1:28:41] a gathering to the unfailing body word
[1:28:44] of the son of man I'm not feeding on
[1:28:46] that famine I'm not feeding on those
[1:28:47] pestilences I'm not feeding on though
[1:28:49] the outcome and the fallout of
[1:28:51] earthquakes I'm feeding on the unfailing
[1:28:52] body word of the Son of Man and if you
[1:28:55] read that statement he says it gives
[1:28:56] yourself to give yourself strength to
[1:28:59] fly above these denominations and the
[1:29:01] things of the world so at a time of
[1:29:03] famines at a time of earthquakes there's
[1:29:04] something else you're feeding on that
[1:29:06] gives you spiritual strength to fly
[1:29:08] above what's taking place in the world
[1:29:11] does that mean you want endure an
[1:29:13] earthquake does that mean you won't
[1:29:14] endure maybe the fallout of food
[1:29:16] shortages if they thought it has nothing
[1:29:18] to do with that it's a different reality
[1:29:19] that were connected to and tied to
[1:29:22] Matthew chapter 24 verse 35 heaven and
[1:29:24] earth shall pass away but my words shall
[1:29:26] not pass away right there in the time of
[1:29:28] this famines and pestilences and
[1:29:29] earthquakes in diverse places and the
[1:29:31] beginning of Sorrows all these things
[1:29:32] he's talking about he's some of the
[1:29:33] coming of the Son of Man in those very
[1:29:35] passages about only the elect not being
[1:29:37] able to be deceived and how deceptive
[1:29:39] those times will be right now we can
[1:29:41] take those things and ponder them and
[1:29:43] realize it's challenge to focus on
[1:29:45] something else because heaven and earth
[1:29:46] will pass away but his word will never
[1:29:47] pass away verse 45 woo then is the
[1:29:51] faithful and wise servant whom his Lord
[1:29:53] hath made ruler over his household to
[1:29:54] give them meat in due season so we have
[1:29:57] meat in due season there can be a
[1:29:58] worldly famine but we have meat and due
[1:30:00] season there can be things taking place
[1:30:02] all throughout the world but we have a
[1:30:04] word which will never pass away there's
[1:30:06] a lot of gatherings around a lot of
[1:30:07] rumors and opinions but we've been
[1:30:09] gathered to the unfailing body word of
[1:30:11] the son of man I love how it's written
[1:30:13] in Luke chapter 21 because his men's
[1:30:15] hearts are filling for fear and all
[1:30:16] these things but a couple verses later
[1:30:18] says when these things begin to come to
[1:30:19] pass then look up now it's not talking
[1:30:22] about physically looking up it's not
[1:30:23] talking out naturally with your eyes
[1:30:24] begin to gaze at the skies he says and
[1:30:27] lift up your heads for your Redemption
[1:30:29] draweth nigh when these things begin to
[1:30:30] happen it's time of your spiritual
[1:30:32] attitude your spiritual expectations let
[1:30:34] it change that you're not not your
[1:30:36] natural gaze or your natural I don't
[1:30:38] mean looking up don't be looking down
[1:30:40] don't worry about how the natural eye is
[1:30:41] oriented what are you looking at I'm
[1:30:43] looking above it my reading
[1:30:45] I'm looking to something that's been
[1:30:46] revealed in this day from heaven that
[1:30:48] excites me and invigorates me and moves
[1:30:50] me along in God's channel times like
[1:30:53] this I've lifted up my spiritual
[1:30:55] attitude I've lifted up my spiritual
[1:30:56] expectation and I'm looking at something
[1:30:58] totally different well as the bride we
[1:31:01] are looking at something different we
[1:31:03] are listening and hearing another voice
[1:31:05] we're listening to the voice of
[1:31:07] revelations 18:4 come out of her my
[1:31:09] people that you receive not of her
[1:31:11] plagues why there's a voice that goes
[1:31:13] for it that calls us out of
[1:31:14] denominational systems we've heard that
[1:31:16] voice come out of here my people that
[1:31:19] we've been uh partakers of her plagues
[1:31:20] and those plagues aren't the things that
[1:31:22] are in the world today it's a plague
[1:31:24] coming in Revelations 19 at a time of
[1:31:27] tribulation
[1:31:27] after the bride is gone to the wedding
[1:31:29] supper in the sky that's the voice that
[1:31:31] we've heard we haven't heard a message
[1:31:33] that says now if you'll do this and
[1:31:35] you'll do that then you don't ever have
[1:31:36] a worry about the flu you don't ever
[1:31:38] have to worry about cancer you don't
[1:31:39] ever have to worry about divorce or or
[1:31:41] our disease or loss of a job no we have
[1:31:44] a promise of provision but he's never
[1:31:46] promised that we would live a life
[1:31:48] without affliction many are the
[1:31:50] afflictions of the righteous they that
[1:31:51] live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[1:31:53] persecution as brother john kaufman
[1:31:55] shared it with me this past week he
[1:31:57] shares me how that we are free from the
[1:31:59] wrath of god but he doesn't say we're
[1:32:01] exempt from the wrath of man there's a
[1:32:03] lot of things that men can do that can
[1:32:05] cause great calamity even in our natural
[1:32:07] lives where this this virus spreads
[1:32:09] throughout all the world and message
[1:32:11] believers succumb to it and are infected
[1:32:13] in sickness but even in that time when
[1:32:15] we're sick we can believe by His stripes
[1:32:16] I'm healed his promise isn't that we
[1:32:19] wouldn't get sick but his promise is by
[1:32:21] His stripes I'm healed but we have heard
[1:32:24] another voice that's called us out of
[1:32:26] Babylon that we not receive those
[1:32:27] plagues which the last plague is
[1:32:29] spiritual death revelations chapter 3
[1:32:32] verse 20 we heard another voice behold I
[1:32:34] stand at the door knock any man hear my
[1:32:36] voice only the bride hears this voice
[1:32:38] and open the door I will come into him
[1:32:40] and know sup with him and he with me
[1:32:43] that's the those are the things that
[1:32:45] we're hearing right now we're not
[1:32:47] connected to CNN we're not connected to
[1:32:48] AP News we're not connected to Bloomberg
[1:32:50] or comm we're not listening just to all
[1:32:52] those things we're connected to
[1:32:53] something different I want to go further
[1:32:56] in this I know time may seem
[1:32:58] to be getting away but I want to be sure
[1:33:01] that we just delivered this burden on
[1:33:02] our hearts from the Lord I believe it's
[1:33:04] not happenstance at all that your pastor
[1:33:06] felt led to ask me and I feel honored to
[1:33:08] be able to do this to be able to
[1:33:09] minister the word but let me say our
[1:33:11] message does not change in light of
[1:33:13] current events when current events
[1:33:15] happen when things begin to transpire
[1:33:17] around us and things are turned
[1:33:18] upside-down in the way we expected
[1:33:20] things done forward doesn't unfold
[1:33:21] exactly the way we thought it would it
[1:33:23] doesn't change our message that has
[1:33:25] already been divinely revealed and given
[1:33:26] by God modern events do not make the
[1:33:29] message clear and I know in your mind
[1:33:31] you're already thinking of the modern
[1:33:33] events made clear by prophecy and I want
[1:33:35] to read a statement from there in a
[1:33:36] moment but the things that happen around
[1:33:38] us don't make the message clear but the
[1:33:40] message makes clear the modern events
[1:33:42] and if that's so if the message is what
[1:33:45] makes things clear that when things like
[1:33:47] this begin to happen we don't change our
[1:33:50] focus we don't begin to emphasize what's
[1:33:53] been taking place around us we don't
[1:33:55] change our focus or emphasis because
[1:33:57] other things are happening we must keep
[1:33:59] our focus the same I thought about this
[1:34:02] it's more of a distraction pandemic than
[1:34:05] it is actually an infectious disease
[1:34:07] pandemic that we've got to worry about
[1:34:08] an epidemic is something that spreads
[1:34:11] widely perhaps within a community or a
[1:34:13] state or an area a pandemic is when that
[1:34:14] same disease has infected the entire
[1:34:17] world it begins to spread globally we're
[1:34:19] not in an epidemic we're in a pandemic
[1:34:20] and let me say that there is a global
[1:34:22] pandemic of a distraction a disease that
[1:34:26] has infected the entire Christian world
[1:34:28] because now everyone's focused on a
[1:34:29] virus everyone's focusing on a disease
[1:34:32] everyone's focused on the things that
[1:34:33] are happening in response to it
[1:34:35] but what about the bride she's not
[1:34:36] looking at coronavirus she's not looking
[1:34:38] at coba 19 she's not looking at the
[1:34:40] World Health Organization or what the
[1:34:42] CDC what Donald Trump and all these
[1:34:44] governors that's not the voice we're
[1:34:45] hearing the bride is not to be
[1:34:48] distracted from the Word of God why
[1:34:50] because her attraction is different as a
[1:34:52] believer your attraction is the word and
[1:34:55] your distraction is the world brother
[1:34:58] branham writes in the church age book no
[1:35:00] true believers any stronger and
[1:35:02] spiritually healthy and alive then his
[1:35:04] knowledge of and adherence to the pure
[1:35:06] Word of God we cannot be any more
[1:35:09] stronger than our knowledge of
[1:35:12] our adherence to the pure Word of God we
[1:35:14] cannot be any more spiritually healthy
[1:35:17] than our knowledge of the Word of God
[1:35:18] and our obedience to the Word of God we
[1:35:21] cannot be any more alive than our
[1:35:23] knowledge of the Word of God and our
[1:35:25] obedience to and our adherence to the
[1:35:27] Word of God our strength our spiritual
[1:35:30] health and our liveliness and how live
[1:35:32] we are depends upon our knowledge and
[1:35:34] revelation of the word and our obedience
[1:35:36] to that word therefore if our spiritual
[1:35:39] health and us being alive in our
[1:35:41] strength is connected to our
[1:35:42] understanding of the Word of God our
[1:35:44] knowledge of the word of God of strength
[1:35:46] and of salvation and stability is the
[1:35:49] wisdom and knowledge of the Lord then in
[1:35:51] times like these a distraction from it
[1:35:53] corrupts our strength a distraction from
[1:35:57] the Word of God a distraction from
[1:35:59] adherence to the Word of God corrupts
[1:36:01] our health I know it's been said before
[1:36:04] a lot of us are realizing just how
[1:36:06] important our relationship with Christ
[1:36:08] is right now because our relationship
[1:36:10] with church attendance has been taken
[1:36:11] away from us and realizing oh my
[1:36:13] goodness you better have a relationship
[1:36:15] with Christ and we're beginning to
[1:36:16] appreciate a personal relationship with
[1:36:17] Christ in the absence of physically
[1:36:19] gathering together in our sanctuaries
[1:36:21] but on the other hand we're also
[1:36:22] realizing how important that gathering
[1:36:24] is because God never called us to a
[1:36:27] relationship with him without there
[1:36:28] being church and actually said assemble
[1:36:30] yourselves more so as you see that Day
[1:36:32] approaching is so we know that this
[1:36:34] gathering together is a body around the
[1:36:36] Word of God is something in the word to
[1:36:39] perfect us and to mature us and we're
[1:36:41] realizing now this is important and I
[1:36:43] think my spiritual health and my
[1:36:45] spiritual growth depends upon the Word
[1:36:47] of God and the dynamics of the Word of
[1:36:49] God and a distraction from it corrupts
[1:36:52] our health God's given a great blessing
[1:36:55] in a time like this he's giving us a
[1:36:57] great grace in a time like this
[1:36:58] but we know that God uses the gather
[1:37:00] into the local assembly for the strength
[1:37:02] of the believer and our greatest danger
[1:37:05] in a time like this is that we take our
[1:37:07] eyes off the Word of God brother Branham
[1:37:09] said in modern events made clear by
[1:37:10] prophecy as his father as we open this
[1:37:12] word now speak to us directly out of
[1:37:14] this word that we might know the hour
[1:37:17] that were living in how are we gonna
[1:37:18] know the hour limited as he speaks to
[1:37:19] his word if we know the I were living
[1:37:21] and then we can prepare for that hour
[1:37:23] I'm coming to a stretch now where I
[1:37:25] begin to
[1:37:26] in the corner I don't if in a baseball
[1:37:28] analogy I don't know if I'm rounding
[1:37:29] second or rounding third but I know
[1:37:31] there's a way home I says how father we
[1:37:34] look to the word speak to us out of the
[1:37:36] word that we might know the hour that
[1:37:37] we're living in that we can prepare for
[1:37:39] that hour so our preparation for the our
[1:37:41] living and comes from the word but if we
[1:37:44] go blindly not knowing who or where or
[1:37:46] what or where then we don't know how to
[1:37:48] prepare so if we go blindly that would
[1:37:50] be going by your own eyesight your own
[1:37:51] understanding of your own ears then we
[1:37:53] don't know how to prayer so father
[1:37:55] prepare so father we pray that you'll
[1:37:57] let us see the arc there and the door
[1:38:00] open and the message calling us in grant
[1:38:03] it through Jesus Christ's name Amen
[1:38:05] then he takes his text there and Luke
[1:38:07] where that was the as they walked with
[1:38:08] him on the road to Emmaus and they were
[1:38:09] broken up in their hearts and they were
[1:38:11] discouraged because of great so he says
[1:38:14] he reads that text he said now it's
[1:38:15] always been the unchanging God's way to
[1:38:18] let his people for know before certain
[1:38:20] events happen and so God has already
[1:38:24] prepared us God has already shown us
[1:38:27] given us a message to show us the arc to
[1:38:29] show us the door open the message
[1:38:31] constant we've had a voice calling us
[1:38:33] out of Babylon we've heard a voice at
[1:38:35] the door we've opened up we're something
[1:38:37] with him and he with us I am you and you
[1:38:39] and me it's that day that we're living
[1:38:41] in and breve I said this is a message to
[1:38:43] help us to prepare now if you want to
[1:38:46] look at the text which we read and I
[1:38:47] want to launch into this now and begin
[1:38:51] to look at this as we're thinking about
[1:38:52] these words we need to have the Word of
[1:38:54] God the voice of God to help us prepare
[1:38:56] for that hour to help us to see the art
[1:38:58] the door open the message calling us in
[1:39:00] to give us certainty and stability
[1:39:02] psalms 105 verses 16 and 17 says
[1:39:06] moreover he called for a famine upon the
[1:39:07] land he braked the whole staff of bread
[1:39:10] this is a famine that came in the land a
[1:39:11] time of Joseph being in Egypt he says he
[1:39:15] sent a man before them even Joseph now
[1:39:19] if you think of the children of Israel
[1:39:20] those that still remain there with Jacob
[1:39:22] in the in Palestine or the promised land
[1:39:25] there was a great famine that went into
[1:39:26] all the land but God had already placed
[1:39:29] Joseph in Egypt and think about the
[1:39:31] circumstances that put him there
[1:39:32] jealousy among his brethren and he was
[1:39:34] sold into slavery and he served in a
[1:39:36] house in slavery until he was falsely
[1:39:38] accused and was thrown into prison
[1:39:40] he served time in prison and just by the
[1:39:42] hand of Lord he's brought out of prison
[1:39:43] at a certain time he's raised to be the
[1:39:45] right hand to Pharaoh and he's placed
[1:39:48] there for what to go before the children
[1:39:50] of Israel to prepare the land of Egypt
[1:39:53] for their arrival
[1:39:55] so Joseph made preparation and what was
[1:39:58] Joseph doing in a time of Plenty he was
[1:40:01] making preparation for a lean time he
[1:40:04] was making preparation during a time of
[1:40:06] wonderful Plenty and things were gonna
[1:40:08] be very bountiful he was making
[1:40:10] preparation then so that when the
[1:40:11] children of Israel came and the sons of
[1:40:14] Jacob came to Egypt looking for grain
[1:40:16] there had already be provision to
[1:40:18] sustain the sons of Israel by what a
[1:40:21] beautiful promise to think that God
[1:40:23] placed one man in Egypt not necessary
[1:40:26] for all of Egypt though they benefited
[1:40:28] but for the survival and the strength of
[1:40:30] God's promised seed and the seed of
[1:40:32] Abraham so Joseph went before them he
[1:40:35] made preparation for their survival
[1:40:36] and if he looked at it and the time that
[1:40:38] we're living in now as he said he called
[1:40:40] for a famine upon the land in Amos
[1:40:42] chapter 8 verses 11 and 12 it says
[1:40:44] behold the days come saith the Lord
[1:40:47] that I'll send a famine in the land not
[1:40:49] a famine of bread nor thirst for water
[1:40:51] but of hearing the words of Lord so the
[1:40:54] famine is not food supply shortages the
[1:40:56] famine is not for Amazon Prime getting
[1:40:58] there next day delivery the famine isn't
[1:41:00] for natural things the famine is for the
[1:41:02] hearing of the word of the Lord and they
[1:41:05] shall wander from sea to sea and from
[1:41:06] north to the east even to east they
[1:41:09] shall be run to and fro to seek the word
[1:41:12] the Lord and shall not find it
[1:41:14] I would love to amplify this more with
[1:41:16] you this this morning but I've got to
[1:41:19] just press further in this there's a lot
[1:41:21] of different ways we can begin to line
[1:41:22] this up to the message of the hour but
[1:41:25] what does brother Branham point us to in
[1:41:26] spiritual food and due season he says
[1:41:28] now we're going to type that with the
[1:41:30] spiritual drought of today he says
[1:41:33] there's a great spiritual drought and
[1:41:35] the landed a spiritually speaking it was
[1:41:37] predicted by the prophets and he refers
[1:41:39] to Amos chapter 8 here and that day is
[1:41:42] now hearing the true Word of God there's
[1:41:45] a famine for hearing the true Word of
[1:41:47] God so we can say there is a spiritual
[1:41:49] plague upon all the world where they
[1:41:51] cannot hear
[1:41:52] here the true Word of God he says now
[1:41:54] this types the natural drought drought
[1:41:56] with the spiritual sin and unbelief by
[1:41:58] false teachers and modernists in the
[1:41:59] church has brought the place to this
[1:42:01] coming judgement on coming judgement
[1:42:04] then they turned from God's Word and his
[1:42:06] prophet to modern theological terms of
[1:42:09] the word you notice here it's just at
[1:42:11] that time that God always raises up
[1:42:14] something so in brother bruh I'm saying
[1:42:17] that there's a famine in the land for
[1:42:19] hearing the true Word of God he's saying
[1:42:21] that the famine will not always exist
[1:42:23] even though these modernists and these
[1:42:25] theologians and these churches and all
[1:42:27] these things they'll exist in a famine
[1:42:29] at a time of the famine at a time of a
[1:42:31] great curse upon the earth where you're
[1:42:33] not hearing the true Word of God God is
[1:42:36] always raising up something it's at that
[1:42:38] time that God raises up something and we
[1:42:42] could go back and even look at the
[1:42:44] spiritual climate of Laodicea back there
[1:42:46] in the early 1900's in the 20th century
[1:42:48] when many of these modern events are
[1:42:50] unfolding and God was up to something
[1:42:53] even while the Pentecost was going to
[1:42:54] the chaos and Laodicea is descending
[1:42:56] into organizations and and the real
[1:42:59] fruit of what God was during that age is
[1:43:00] beginning to dry them God was still up
[1:43:02] to something
[1:43:03] right under the nose of the Economist
[1:43:06] right under the nose of the scientists
[1:43:07] right under the nose of all the
[1:43:08] theologians God was up to something so
[1:43:11] let me take you back now to what we were
[1:43:13] referring to before about these two
[1:43:15] points of reference in a time of trouble
[1:43:18] in this great time that we're living in
[1:43:20] now if I could look at it from the
[1:43:22] economic standpoint referred to in the
[1:43:24] beginning it was during the worst
[1:43:27] economic disaster that America had ever
[1:43:29] seen that God was raising up something
[1:43:32] because brother Graham says God always
[1:43:33] raises up something great depression
[1:43:36] from 1929 to 1939 the worst years were
[1:43:39] 1931 1932 1933 there was the worst years
[1:43:43] of the economic situation in America and
[1:43:45] why all that's unfolding preparation was
[1:43:47] being made why as we took from Psalms
[1:43:50] 105 from a natural standpoint he sent
[1:43:53] Joseph before them to make preparation
[1:43:55] for the time that they were going to be
[1:43:56] living in and so while this great
[1:43:59] depressions unfolding in the land 1931
[1:44:02] begins one of the worst stretches ever
[1:44:04] in the history of the Great
[1:44:06] oppression one of the worst stretches
[1:44:07] ever of our economic history as
[1:44:09] Americans in 1931 that was the year that
[1:44:11] brother Branham was saved right in the
[1:44:14] midst of one of the worst years of the
[1:44:15] Great Depression salvation is coming to
[1:44:17] a young man
[1:44:18] God is birthing him into the body of
[1:44:20] Christ then in 1932 it's in that year
[1:44:22] one of the worst years of the Great
[1:44:23] Depression it's in that year that
[1:44:25] brother Branham was ordained to preach
[1:44:27] the gospel 31:32 then in 1933 during
[1:44:30] probably the worst year yet of the Great
[1:44:32] Depression right in the midst of the
[1:44:34] greatest economic crisis America has
[1:44:36] ever seen four thousand banks closing
[1:44:39] twenty five percent unemployment and
[1:44:41] droughts something ravaging all over all
[1:44:44] over the Midwest right there in the
[1:44:45] midst of that worst time on June 11th
[1:44:48] 1933 brother Graham's baptizing new
[1:44:51] converts in the Ohio River and is he's
[1:44:53] baptizing the 17th person to water a
[1:44:55] pillar of fire appears on the river and
[1:44:57] the voice of God bellows out from that
[1:44:59] pillar fire it says as John the Baptist
[1:45:01] for on the second first coming of the
[1:45:03] Lord Jesus Christ so shall your ministry
[1:45:06] for run the second coming to the Lord
[1:45:07] Jesus Christ right there in the worst
[1:45:10] year the Great Depression God was up to
[1:45:12] something right then when men were
[1:45:15] looking politically in control and
[1:45:16] economics and a new deal in all these
[1:45:19] different ways to avoid an economic
[1:45:20] disaster God was raising something up as
[1:45:23] John the Baptist for and the first
[1:45:25] coming of Jesus Christ so will your
[1:45:27] ministry for in his second coming it was
[1:45:29] during the worst hard time that the Lord
[1:45:31] Himself appeared to Commission a prophet
[1:45:35] the economic conditions were not the
[1:45:37] absolute God wasn't waiting till
[1:45:39] America's in a better place economically
[1:45:41] God wasn't waiting until the weather was
[1:45:43] better in the Midwest God wasn't waiting
[1:45:45] until there was no disease of these
[1:45:47] different things those things didn't
[1:45:48] hinder God's plans those things didn't
[1:45:50] shape God's plans and it could be
[1:45:54] pointed out that God can use whether he
[1:45:56] can use earthquakes he can use droughts
[1:45:58] he can use whirlwinds and hurricanes he
[1:46:01] can use all sorts of things and disease
[1:46:03] to move his people he can use those
[1:46:05] things to break our will to break our
[1:46:07] stubbornness but ultimately it's the
[1:46:09] Word of God
[1:46:09] listen it's ultimately the Word of God
[1:46:11] that moves it motivates and matures his
[1:46:15] bride if the Word of God that moves and
[1:46:18] motivates a mature
[1:46:19] his bride gods just not merely gonna use
[1:46:21] external forces and external factors to
[1:46:23] mature the word has got to be the Word
[1:46:26] of God has to be placing things into
[1:46:27] perspective the word gene has to be down
[1:46:29] on the inside of you if it was just
[1:46:31] calamity that perfected people then
[1:46:33] there'd be a lot of more perfect people
[1:46:34] than there was but there's got to be a
[1:46:36] word that's a part of that it's got to
[1:46:38] be a promise there's got to be an
[1:46:39] absolute that's connected to it and so
[1:46:41] God can use a lot of things in your life
[1:46:43] to get your attention the loss of a job
[1:46:44] the loss of the loved one a very
[1:46:45] difficult situation but at the end of
[1:46:47] day it's the word that you look to to
[1:46:49] move you to motivate you and to mature
[1:46:52] you so right there and the great
[1:46:54] depression when we look to the economic
[1:46:56] standpoint we're trying to look at
[1:46:57] factors what are we facing now what are
[1:46:59] we facing out there's something we as
[1:47:01] believers can look to to say hey right
[1:47:03] in the middle of that God was up to
[1:47:04] something and that should get us
[1:47:06] thinking about what we're looking at
[1:47:08] that should help us to answer the
[1:47:10] questions this is well what are you
[1:47:11] looking at it would help to say I know
[1:47:12] exactly what I'm looking at and so let
[1:47:16] me just look at it from the pandemic
[1:47:17] standpoint we mentioned the Spanish flu
[1:47:20] the worst years of the Spanish flu from
[1:47:22] 1918 to 1920 those are the worst years
[1:47:26] of the Spanish flu but they say that it
[1:47:28] may have begun and they're pretty
[1:47:29] certain some of them very certain about
[1:47:30] when it would have at least started was
[1:47:32] 1916 so we've already seen a type of
[1:47:36] during that from the economic standpoint
[1:47:37] now let me just mention something
[1:47:38] quickly to you from a pandemic
[1:47:40] standpoint 1916 Spanish flu begins to
[1:47:44] spread it finds it's infection into a
[1:47:46] human body it begins to spread maybe
[1:47:48] begins as an epidemic and then it begins
[1:47:50] to spread globally and now everyone's
[1:47:53] recognized in 1918 but right there 1916
[1:47:55] seven-year-old boy named William Branham
[1:47:59] is walking and a whirlwind catches in to
[1:48:02] a bush and from that Bush a voice speaks
[1:48:04] and says don't you drink or smoke chew
[1:48:07] drink or defile your body in any way
[1:48:09] there'll be a work for you to do when
[1:48:12] you get older right there in 1916 God
[1:48:15] meets a young boy and threw a pillar of
[1:48:17] fire through a whirlwind in a bush and
[1:48:19] speaks or says don't smoke don't drink
[1:48:20] don't chew don't defile your body anyway
[1:48:23] because I have a work for you to do what
[1:48:24] was happening God was calling his
[1:48:26] prophet there's very one that we
[1:48:27] mentioned in the beginning was telling
[1:48:29] us that their survival systems that
[1:48:30] don't won't work you've got to go with
[1:48:31] the word of the Lord
[1:48:32] the very one that tell us that God has
[1:48:33] an ark for us to look to the very one
[1:48:35] that says we've got to know what God's
[1:48:37] Word says about for this day so we can
[1:48:39] know how to progress in venture and step
[1:48:41] forward with official Authority it's a
[1:48:44] reminder that during these times of a
[1:48:46] pandemic then these kinds of an economic
[1:48:48] collapse we look at the word what are
[1:48:50] you looking at I'm looking at the Word
[1:48:51] of God
[1:48:52] we're not governed by natural forces
[1:48:54] we're not governed by the natural things
[1:48:56] around us I'm not dependent upon what my
[1:48:58] governor says about stay-at-home owners
[1:48:59] I have a different promise I'm not
[1:49:01] dependent on whether or not COBIT 19
[1:49:03] comes near my home I'm not worried about
[1:49:04] all those things those aren't the things
[1:49:06] that God is using to put me where I need
[1:49:08] to be God's not using those things alone
[1:49:10] to get my attention I've heard another
[1:49:12] voice it says in Psalm 105 verse 17 he
[1:49:16] sent a man before them even Joseph's so
[1:49:19] think about it now as we try to bring
[1:49:21] this I think I've maybe had maybe about
[1:49:23] a year here are a year sorry for some of
[1:49:25] you may have felt like a year already
[1:49:26] I've been preaching but I think I'm
[1:49:27] coming up maybe on an hour of ministry
[1:49:29] and in this in this service he sent a
[1:49:34] man before them so God deals with Israel
[1:49:37] after the flesh think about this now
[1:49:39] we're gonna read a quote from Feast of
[1:49:41] Trumpets very quickly just to put all
[1:49:43] this into perspective he deals with
[1:49:44] Israel after the flesh so Joseph was in
[1:49:48] the land of Egypt for a physical
[1:49:50] preparation for a famine that was coming
[1:49:52] so God used famine he actually used
[1:49:54] natural circumstance to put Joseph in
[1:49:56] Egypt he then uses natural famine to
[1:49:59] reunite the sons of Israel and Jacob
[1:50:01] with with Joseph he's using natural
[1:50:04] circumstances to unite them together to
[1:50:06] bring them in a natural union then he
[1:50:08] uses bondage and cruel taskmasters to
[1:50:10] cause look that people in this strange
[1:50:12] land to cry out for deliverance and even
[1:50:15] desire in Exodus then of the time of
[1:50:17] their exes he brought plagues to soften
[1:50:19] their hearts for that Exodus and he
[1:50:21] brought plagues and signs and wonders to
[1:50:23] get them to believe in their prophet all
[1:50:25] to bring them out of a natural land into
[1:50:28] a nother natural land those are all the
[1:50:30] ways that God dealt with Israel it was
[1:50:32] all after the flesh and that's how God
[1:50:35] used this man that went before him to
[1:50:37] make preparation for Israel but the
[1:50:42] bride is different
[1:50:43] God doesn't move us through the natural
[1:50:45] things but
[1:50:46] supernatural things yes there was
[1:50:48] supernatural what God was doing with
[1:50:50] Joseph it was supernatural God was doing
[1:50:52] with Israel but God deals with them
[1:50:54] uniquely differently than he does the
[1:50:56] Gentiles they have circumcision of the
[1:50:58] flesh
[1:50:58] we have circumcision of the heart a lot
[1:51:00] of different things we could expound
[1:51:02] upon in that life that type but brother
[1:51:04] Brennan and theses of trumpets is now
[1:51:05] watch the natural Israel in the
[1:51:07] spiritual church as we separated here
[1:51:10] he says turned loose on the Jews so
[1:51:12] there's these two hundred million demons
[1:51:15] were poured out naturally upon the Jews
[1:51:17] he says now in paragraph 182 now the
[1:51:19] ecclesiastical realm has been opened
[1:51:21] from the natural eye of the old pagan
[1:51:24] Rome which went forth to the Jews which
[1:51:26] has always been their enemy so these
[1:51:28] spiritual demons were once a the revival
[1:51:31] of old pagan Rome which physically
[1:51:33] persecuted the Jews but now he's saying
[1:51:35] it's loose and the ecclesiastical church
[1:51:37] spirit loosed upon what not upon the
[1:51:40] denominations but upon the bride so
[1:51:43] there's been a spiritual loosened upon
[1:51:45] the brain so she's not promised a
[1:51:47] physical tribulation physical
[1:51:49] persecution for her perfection and for
[1:51:52] her her salvation or to put her in her
[1:51:54] homeland she's not promised that to put
[1:51:56] her in the meeting in the air he says
[1:51:59] but here you'll get it the bride will
[1:52:00] not go through that time the Bible says
[1:52:04] the body the Bible says the Bible says
[1:52:08] not the church will but not the bride
[1:52:10] can't you see ministers can't you see
[1:52:12] that brethren you say the church has to
[1:52:14] go through the persecution for the
[1:52:15] perfection of it the blood of Jesus
[1:52:17] Christ perfects the bride it's the blood
[1:52:20] of Jesus Christ that perfects the bride
[1:52:22] it's not the economic difficulty it's
[1:52:24] not persecution here in persecution
[1:52:26] there we are looking to strengthen
[1:52:28] else's bleeding bloody word in this last
[1:52:30] days that's the perfection of the bride
[1:52:31] that's what he's dressing us and not
[1:52:33] calamities and afflictions and
[1:52:35] persecutions but his word builder
[1:52:38] branham's ask the questions in question
[1:52:39] and answers this is after he preaches
[1:52:41] peace of the trumpets will the bride go
[1:52:43] through persecution as the early
[1:52:44] apostles taluk church did now think
[1:52:47] about this will the bride go through
[1:52:49] persecution as the early apostolic
[1:52:51] church did now we're being restored back
[1:52:53] to the book of Acts we say and we're
[1:52:54] gonna repeat the book of Acts a lot of
[1:52:56] different languages we use he says no I
[1:52:58] just explained that a few minutes ago
[1:53:00] No the next thing is a rapture now we're
[1:53:03] at the border he's saying so the next
[1:53:05] thing for us is a rapture the next thing
[1:53:07] we're looking for isn't persecution the
[1:53:09] next thing we're looking for isn't
[1:53:10] physical situations and physical
[1:53:13] circumstances as a signifier of what's
[1:53:15] taking place he says that the next thing
[1:53:17] is the rapture
[1:53:18] so what are we preparing for I'm
[1:53:20] preparing for a change in my body we're
[1:53:22] preparing for a translation we're
[1:53:24] preparing for a meeting in the air we're
[1:53:26] preparing for a millennium we're not
[1:53:28] preparing for persecution we're not
[1:53:30] preparing for tribulation and if we're
[1:53:31] not preparing for tribulation when all
[1:53:33] these things happen out there we
[1:53:35] shouldn't be looking at that we should
[1:53:37] keep our eyes on the artwork what are we
[1:53:38] looking at if we're being prepared we've
[1:53:41] got to be looking at the thing that's
[1:53:42] preparing us brother Branham says I
[1:53:45] believe that through the seven thunders
[1:53:46] will we be revealed in the last days in
[1:53:48] order to get the bride together for
[1:53:50] rapturing faith so if he says in 64 the
[1:53:53] next thing is the rapture then we had to
[1:53:55] have those seven thunders be revealed
[1:53:56] for rapture in faith so what is getting
[1:53:58] us ready the revelation of those seven
[1:54:00] thunders and anointed ones again he says
[1:54:03] the third pulls the open e of the word
[1:54:05] the misters revealed the third pull was
[1:54:08] the older than seven seals to reveal the
[1:54:10] hidden truth that's been sealed in the
[1:54:12] word I'm just laying this in very
[1:54:14] quickly to ask you what are you looking
[1:54:16] at what's preparing you the economic
[1:54:20] situation is not going to prepare you
[1:54:21] that the physical situation is not going
[1:54:23] to be Prairie to prepare you it's the
[1:54:25] revelation of the Word of God that
[1:54:26] prepares you that's the opening of those
[1:54:29] seven seals that's going to give the
[1:54:30] bride rapturing faith it's the third
[1:54:33] pull the open of the word the open the
[1:54:34] seals the reading revealed hidden truth
[1:54:37] that's been revealed to us in this hour
[1:54:39] the unfailing body word of the son of
[1:54:40] man that's what's going to prepare us
[1:54:42] for that meeting in the air that's what
[1:54:44] is preparing us for the meeting there
[1:54:46] now you can say well brother Branham I
[1:54:48] when brother Branham talked about it
[1:54:50] look away to Jesus I believe what about
[1:54:52] what about the tightening what about the
[1:54:54] press the term that's often uses the
[1:54:57] squeeze what about the squeeze what
[1:54:59] about the press what about the
[1:55:00] tightening go back and read the quote he
[1:55:02] says watch the third pull then hey man
[1:55:05] praise the Lord our view doesn't change
[1:55:07] if there's gonna be a squeeze if there's
[1:55:09] going to be a tighten if there's going
[1:55:11] to be a press God when Turpin is one
[1:55:13] by bringing it to pass but our view is
[1:55:14] no different he says watch the third
[1:55:16] pole what are we looking at we're
[1:55:18] looking at the revealed word of the hour
[1:55:20] that's what's making clear the things
[1:55:22] that are happening around us and in
[1:55:23] Psalms 105 verse 19 until the time that
[1:55:26] his word came until the time that the
[1:55:28] promise was completely fulfilled to his
[1:55:30] word came that means finished the word
[1:55:32] of the Lord tried him the bride showdown
[1:55:35] is not an economic showdown the bride
[1:55:37] showdown is not a physical showdown the
[1:55:39] bride's chest is on a material one it's
[1:55:42] not about money it's not about
[1:55:43] possessions it's not about our health
[1:55:44] we're not tried the bride trial is not
[1:55:47] in those things Wow the natural world is
[1:55:50] tried by possessions the entire world is
[1:55:52] being tried right now by a health crisis
[1:55:55] the entire world's being tried by an
[1:55:57] economic crisis will God use it for us
[1:55:59] differently
[1:56:00] absolutely but where's our real test
[1:56:02] where's our real trial how's the bride
[1:56:04] tried and found to be different than the
[1:56:06] rest of the world it's the word that
[1:56:08] tries us Villeurbanne said in God of
[1:56:10] this evil age we find now this evil age
[1:56:12] is to prove to Satan she is not like Eve
[1:56:14] that she's not that type of the woman
[1:56:16] and she will be tried by his word the
[1:56:19] bride as Adams bride was tried by the
[1:56:22] word if there's any persecution if
[1:56:25] there's any pandemic if there's any kind
[1:56:27] of pressure that we experience it's a
[1:56:29] pressure to try to drive you away from
[1:56:32] the word so we've got to stay connected
[1:56:33] to the Word of God when the Titan comes
[1:56:35] watch the third pole when a health
[1:56:37] crisis comes watch the third pole when
[1:56:40] job difficulties come watch the third
[1:56:42] pole our view doesn't change in light of
[1:56:45] the things that's taking place around us
[1:56:46] watch the Word of God keep your eyes on
[1:56:48] the third pole while we're being tried
[1:56:50] by the Word of God until the time that
[1:56:54] his word was finished the word of the
[1:56:55] Lord tried to him until the time of the
[1:56:58] fulfillment of all the prophecies in
[1:57:00] this day the bride will be tried by the
[1:57:02] word until the time that we meet him in
[1:57:04] the air the bride will be tried by the
[1:57:06] word what happened to Eve he says tried
[1:57:08] as as Adams bride was tried by the word
[1:57:11] Eve took her eyes off the promise the
[1:57:13] bride proves she's not like Eve what she
[1:57:16] keeps her eyes steadfast on that promise
[1:57:18] what are you looking at
[1:57:20] I just have two quotes to end with you
[1:57:22] end with today one from recognizing your
[1:57:26] day in its message another one from what
[1:57:27] is the attraction on the Mount I'm just
[1:57:30] gonna I'm gonna be closing here we've
[1:57:32] been right at an hour to some of you
[1:57:34] maybe right at a year to others I could
[1:57:37] say brother man said the believer the
[1:57:38] bride could sit hour after hour drinking
[1:57:40] in these things so maybe we're getting
[1:57:42] close to that after hour but listen as I
[1:57:44] share these last two quotes with you
[1:57:46] so we're pondering what's taking place
[1:57:48] today what are you looking at and we've
[1:57:51] already seen in the Word of God that
[1:57:52] when the world was suffering America was
[1:57:55] suffering the world was suffering God
[1:57:56] always raises up something and there was
[1:57:59] God raising up a prophet what does that
[1:58:01] tell us at a time like this he's already
[1:58:03] gone before us prepared a message opened
[1:58:05] up a door into an arc that is our place
[1:58:08] of safety recognizing your day in its
[1:58:11] message remember how in feast of the
[1:58:12] trumpets these are priests very very
[1:58:14] close together recognizing your Danis
[1:58:15] message preached a week after Feast of
[1:58:17] the trumpets you have natural Israel
[1:58:19] spiritual bride natural things to Israel
[1:58:22] spiritual things to the bride he says
[1:58:24] look Israel back in a promised land she
[1:58:27] don't know how she got back there says
[1:58:29] she was just automatically putting back
[1:58:30] there why national force put her in her
[1:58:34] place what was it the tender hand of
[1:58:36] Jehovah actually murdered millions of
[1:58:40] Jews to get the people into the Promised
[1:58:43] Land so that that olive branch that
[1:58:45] olive tree could bring forth the bud
[1:58:47] that this is what God was doing in that
[1:58:49] time he says national forests put her in
[1:58:52] her place she says now I'm going to say
[1:58:53] something he wants us to catch this
[1:58:55] because he's preaching from Hosea
[1:58:57] recognizing your day in its message and
[1:58:58] he's dealing with Israel but what's the
[1:59:00] revelation we have a message in this
[1:59:02] recognizing I regret it's missus not
[1:59:03] Israel's Dana Israel's message but our
[1:59:05] Dana's message your program said that we
[1:59:07] look to Israel and it is like our it
[1:59:10] like a calendar and you don't stare at a
[1:59:12] calendar we're not always just looking
[1:59:14] at Israel what Israel doing what's
[1:59:15] Israel do what Israel we can look at it
[1:59:17] to get an orientation of an overall time
[1:59:19] we're living it but we look to the word
[1:59:21] to know the second the day the moment
[1:59:22] that we're living in he says national
[1:59:25] force put her in her place now I'm going
[1:59:28] to say something National Forest put
[1:59:29] Israel a homeland national force will
[1:59:31] put the church and the World Council of
[1:59:32] Churches so
[1:59:33] national forest national conditions
[1:59:35] national efforts national laws all sorts
[1:59:38] of nationalism will put the church in
[1:59:40] its the World Council of Churches will
[1:59:42] put Israel in their homeland but the
[1:59:44] power of God will put the people in the
[1:59:47] bride it's not the natural things that
[1:59:49] accomplish it but the power of God will
[1:59:51] put the people in the bride the world
[1:59:53] forces this way the world forces that
[1:59:55] way but God forces upward the Spirit of
[1:59:58] God which is the Word of God it is the
[2:00:00] word of God my word is feared in life
[2:00:02] we'll put the bride in her place it is
[2:00:05] the word that positionally places you
[2:00:07] think of this believers and this time
[2:00:09] right now uncertainty the stability of
[2:00:12] our times is the Word of God
[2:00:13] it is the word that will put us in our
[2:00:16] place because she'll recognize her
[2:00:18] position in the word heyyyyyy men shall
[2:00:22] recognize her position order then she's
[2:00:24] in Christ it will put her in her place
[2:00:25] no national force will do it if I'm
[2:00:31] looking for my preparation for a meeting
[2:00:32] in the air I'm not looking to the CDC
[2:00:35] I'm not looking to the w-h-o I'm not
[2:00:37] looking to presidents and governors and
[2:00:38] mayors and municipalities I'm looking to
[2:00:40] the Word of God to prepare me national
[2:00:44] force will not do it but national force
[2:00:46] did drive Israel to the homeland
[2:00:47] national forces of the Council of
[2:00:49] Churches will drive every organization
[2:00:50] into it but the power of God will raise
[2:00:53] the bride and the glory out of it what's
[2:00:55] raising us up you're feeding on the
[2:00:57] unfailing body Word of the son of man to
[2:00:59] give you strength to fly above
[2:01:01] denominations and the things of the
[2:01:02] world what a resurrection this is right
[2:01:04] now by the Word of God that's our way of
[2:01:07] escape that's our safety revelations
[2:01:10] chapter 19 there's a marriage that comes
[2:01:14] and this is blessed is he who is called
[2:01:16] to the marriage supper of the lamb why
[2:01:18] because she is the bride who escapes all
[2:01:21] the tribulation that begins to come upon
[2:01:23] the face of the earth because she was
[2:01:25] looking at something different she heard
[2:01:27] a voice of revelations 18 for she heard
[2:01:29] a knock of revelations 3:20 she was
[2:01:31] gathered as an eagle where the carcass
[2:01:33] is there will the eagle's be gathered
[2:01:36] maybe you could just bow your head as I
[2:01:38] read this last quote I want you
[2:01:41] to focus now very intently before we
[2:01:43] turn the service over to brother Peter
[2:01:45] we'll pray a word of prayer to you and
[2:01:48] then we'll turn it to brother Peter and
[2:01:51] maybe he's gonna lead you in worship
[2:01:52] whatever the custom is or whatever the
[2:01:54] order the services were completely
[2:01:56] yielded to it now we have our heads
[2:01:58] bowed there's a real reverence an
[2:01:59] anointing where I met I hope that it's
[2:02:01] the same I'm believing it's the same for
[2:02:03] some children of God now in what does
[2:02:05] the attraction on the Mount brother mem
[2:02:06] says the same thing is taking place he's
[2:02:09] talking about how they are the great
[2:02:11] commotion that was there when he came
[2:02:14] riding into Jerusalem then the commotion
[2:02:15] on the day of Pentecost it's the same
[2:02:17] thing as taking place the same questions
[2:02:19] being asked what's all the racket look
[2:02:21] up and down the street now this is
[2:02:22] what's happening brother branham's day
[2:02:23] right now July 25th 1965 look down the
[2:02:26] street cars from Michigan to Florida
[2:02:28] from Maine to California this morning
[2:02:31] when I was riding out right after noon
[2:02:32] was going down the street my wife and I
[2:02:34] was looking at the licenses on the cars
[2:02:35] that's where I thought of this text what
[2:02:38] meaneth this just as it said where the
[2:02:42] carcass is there the Eagles will gather
[2:02:45] what was drawn them all together 1965
[2:02:48] the word was being opened up the
[2:02:50] unfailing body word was being preached
[2:02:52] and he begins to read the lines of
[2:02:54] seeing the lines of the song they come
[2:02:56] from the east and west
[2:02:57] to feast with our king beholding his
[2:03:01] hallowed face and he says that's what
[2:03:06] the attraction is we're feasting right
[2:03:09] now with our King we're dining as his
[2:03:12] bride now we're beholding his face
[2:03:16] that's what the attraction is and I read
[2:03:22] from the world is falling apart he says
[2:03:26] remember it's our life
[2:03:27] he says here and what is the attraction
[2:03:29] he says the predestination seat of God
[2:03:31] who can't do nothing else but follow it
[2:03:34] follow this body word of the son of man
[2:03:37] follow where this feast is taking us
[2:03:41] following his face the predestinated
[2:03:44] seat of God who can't do nothing else
[2:03:45] but follow it it means more than life to
[2:03:49] us take our lives but you don't take
[2:03:53] that what is
[2:03:54] attraction God as usual fulfilling his
[2:03:58] word what are you looking at maybe some
[2:04:02] of you had your heads up and I looked
[2:04:03] into the cameras and what are you
[2:04:04] looking at
[2:04:05] now I got your attention what are you
[2:04:07] looking at are you looking at his word
[2:04:10] that's been fulfilled that's making
[2:04:11] preparation that's gone before us or you
[2:04:13] look into all the things around us and
[2:04:15] let me say it now from the depths of my
[2:04:17] heart that as the bride of Jesus Christ
[2:04:19] we must be hearing something different
[2:04:21] than what every pulpits preaching right
[2:04:23] now we must be hearing something
[2:04:25] different than what's being said through
[2:04:27] blogs and podcasting in dot-coms and dot
[2:04:30] orgs and all these things we must be
[2:04:31] here in a different voice how we must be
[2:04:34] seeing something different we must be
[2:04:36] hearing something different whatever was
[2:04:38] feeding you before this crisis took hold
[2:04:41] that's what we need to keep feeding on
[2:04:44] if the Word of God was being opened up
[2:04:47] to us if the Word of God was being
[2:04:48] revealed to us and it was feeding us to
[2:04:50] fly above the denomination's our focus
[2:04:51] doesn't change now it actually becomes
[2:04:53] clearer it actually becomes more dis
[2:04:55] more ardent and more disciplined I'm
[2:04:58] gonna look at this word because that's
[2:04:59] what's gonna change me as you continue
[2:05:01] to keep your heads bowed I want to pray
[2:05:03] with you he says it means more than life
[2:05:06] to us take her lies but don't you take
[2:05:10] that go God as we bow our heads if you
[2:05:13] have need of prayer maybe you just want
[2:05:14] to slip your hand up open up your heart
[2:05:17] to him now you could take my life Lord
[2:05:20] by way of a disease you could take it by
[2:05:23] sickness you could take it by a lot of
[2:05:25] different ways Lord whatever you do
[2:05:26] don't take this word from me don't take
[2:05:30] this promise from me Lord you can take
[2:05:33] my job you could take my comforts you
[2:05:35] could take away a lot of things in this
[2:05:37] world but don't take this message from
[2:05:39] me these more than life to me that's
[2:05:42] your hearts cry your hearts open before
[2:05:44] and we pray now our gracious Heavenly
[2:05:46] Father as we stand in your presence
[2:05:47] today as many are sitting maybe Lehane
[2:05:50] may be kneeling lord whatever it might
[2:05:52] be with hands raised but hearts open to
[2:05:54] you Lord we've been asked the question
[2:05:57] what are you looking at and our answer
[2:05:59] is now Lord we're beholding your face
[2:06:01] we're looking to you in this time of
[2:06:04] trouble you've hit us in the secret of
[2:06:07] your tabernacle
[2:06:08] Lord there we're dining with you were
[2:06:10] feasting at the Kings table in the
[2:06:13] presence of our enemies a full-course
[2:06:15] meal for all seven seals have been open
[2:06:18] to those that believe and to those who
[2:06:20] can receive it that's what we've been
[2:06:23] taught in this hour the Lord I I feel no
[2:06:27] unction at all in my heart as a man of
[2:06:30] God to rebuke the people to correct the
[2:06:32] people Lord it Wells up within me as a
[2:06:36] reminder that this message is precious
[2:06:38] to us it's what we must be feeding on
[2:06:41] and looking to during a time like this
[2:06:42] for all times Lord because Lord if I
[2:06:46] could just inject maybe my personal
[2:06:48] thought as I ponder Lord I think things
[2:06:52] will get back to our normal where we'll
[2:06:55] just get back into a routine and maybe
[2:06:57] some things will be different Lord we've
[2:06:58] been used to taking our shoes off to go
[2:07:00] on an airplane and having less than
[2:07:02] three ounces in bottles Lord as we board
[2:07:04] planes and we've gotten used to it Lord
[2:07:06] and yes there were some changes and
[2:07:08] inconveniences but for the most part
[2:07:10] things flourish there's a time of peace
[2:07:12] and a time of Plenty Lord I could see
[2:07:15] that the whole world would just get back
[2:07:16] to a new normal everything will be the
[2:07:20] same again but to the bride Lord will be
[2:07:25] focused more intently on you as our
[2:07:28] pastor here at Hickory Bible Tabernacle
[2:07:30] preached today in a time of desperation
[2:07:32] that's when people used me begin to call
[2:07:34] upon the Lord the Lord you've worked in
[2:07:37] our hearts to remind us at a time like
[2:07:39] this that the word were feeding on is
[2:07:41] what's producing and materializing a new
[2:07:44] body so Lord of things return back to
[2:07:46] normal soon to us we'll still remain in
[2:07:49] this mode watch the third pull feed on
[2:07:52] the unfailing body Word of the Son of
[2:07:54] Man we have eagles have been gathered to
[2:07:56] your carcass and I pray for Tucson
[2:07:58] Tabernacle what I thank you that you
[2:08:01] sent a man to him brother Matthew
[2:08:03] Watkins to be there with them during a
[2:08:04] time like this help guide them through
[2:08:07] uncertainty Lord I pondered it deeply as
[2:08:09] one who has a deep burden for the people
[2:08:12] there Tucson how just the right time you
[2:08:15] gave them a pastor to navigate a time
[2:08:17] like this because Lord who knows whether
[2:08:19] or not a body could survive complete
[2:08:21] being shut down Lord who knows what
[2:08:23] would have been and I know I may be
[2:08:25] speculating something but lord I see
[2:08:26] your hand of provision I see your love
[2:08:28] Lord I pray that now and your sovereign
[2:08:32] presence and the love that they feel in
[2:08:34] their hearts right now that you would
[2:08:35] just encourage them to keep looking at
[2:08:38] the right thing I commit them to you now
