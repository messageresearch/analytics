which i've committed [Music] brother branham says if you go to the doctor listen to what the doctor says you know and again when i go to the doctor i don't go with my confidence in the doctor i go with my confidence in god one of of brother branham's best friends was dr sam adair and he listened to the doctor quite often why because god uses people to help us out to do things you know and and so what why go to the doctor if you have no intention of doing it when you say you know lord you you've directed me you've led me you're going and and this is for my good now we have the doctor of doctors and one thing about this doctor he can go look right through you and say oh you're here for this and this not for what you told me you didn't you know sometimes we're just trying to cover it but god looks down you know they're coming through the line and and and the prophet would stand there and he says now you know who i'm waiting for you know what i'm waiting for i'm just talking then he would go he's here and at that point he knew the secrets of the heart would be unveiled the reasons why now you've come for this and this and oh and i see this and not just that but and he would begin to see not brother branham but that angel of the lord doing that and we come like that to church saying lord i've come these are my intentions this is my heart but you know what's best you've already purposed something and you've made preparation for it again and as i was looking at that you know we looking there with with brother tim emelon's daughter she's 21 years old and it just seemed like the other day she was just a little girl and here she's 21 and and planning to get married you know and i look back at now and we're going on 42 years and it just seemed like it was the other day for us you know but time goes on but you know god had a reason and a place and and when i was thinking this and i brother jordan just walked out and god had a purpose and a place and and when i was thinking that i said there was a jordan for sister martha and there was a sister martha for brother jordan now before they met each other they didn't know that and i don't know why god just gave me that name but that's what he did you know and and he there was that and and then they come to a time in life where they get to meet each other and something begins to to happen you know you you you could say a reaction or this and that the doctor tried but god had already ordained that so that time came and that's that's for each one of us you know and um we realize god has a purpose for your life and my life romans 8 28 all things are for our good all things he said even though some of the things don't look like they're very good it's not the way we we would plant them so just looking at that today god has a purpose and he made a preparation so when we go back to genesis and and we read that um first verse you know that we had here let's put that verse back up there brother jordan in the very first verse and the lord god took the man and put him in the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest deep freely there's pretty simple directions right there it's not very complicated you know but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shall not eat of it for in the day that thou eat is thereof thou shalt surely die and the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make and help meet for him. and now he tells them it's yours the garden is here take care of it you'll do this you know and it wasn't going to be hard labor for for adam that was to come later after the fall but here was he says but there's just one thing of the two trees you are not to partake of this one but of this one you may feast you may eat of all the time you know god had a reason and a purpose why because you know brother branham talks about he gets into it because in him was all these attributes was in him was a savior and him was a redeemer and him was a comforter and him was a healer every part of this was in him already it was part of his nature now in us in each human there's a lot of things that are already in there but it's not until you begin to grow and your life because you began to express some of it so god puts that tree in there for a reason and for a purpose knowing that man would partake of that tree even though he was told not to do it god allowed it to be because god wanted to express himself in healing in redemption in salvation now you and i would have probably never done it that way we would have said let's skip all of that let's just have adam and eve in the garden and never have an issue again but there would always be something missing something pulling something drawing so we know this and we know all the stories so i'm just going to skip some of the scriptures and not be too long here he says and then we go to the next the next scriptures here and out of the ground of the lord god formed every beast of the field in every file of the air and brought them unto adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever adam called every living creature that was the name thereof and adam gave names to all the cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for adam there was was not found and helped me for him i i don't know i would just kind of look at that scripture and say adam kind of got close to the horse and said man this is a nice horse but no um there was something in adam calling out for that other part there was something in adam that said you know as he's going through and he's naming them but the scripture tells him sal says adam did not find that other portion that part yet he's naming all the animals and and i don't know why he named him what they named him but it worked fine didn't it yeah an elephant's an elephant why he named it i don't know but he says and the lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man now brother tim on on wednesday on sunday he got into some of this also and i already knew what was in my notes as he's preaching this and i'm like wow you know just it goes right in there but to to think you know here adam has looked at all these animals the birds and all of this but there's something that still says no no that's not that that's not the one that's not that satisfying portion so god takes that portion out of adam that was eve and he and he and he forms her separately away from adam because as any and he brought her unto him so in my mind i could see the lord taking eve through the garden and she's looking at the same animals that adam named she sees the elephants she sees the birds she sees the lions and and she had to have the same reaction that is neat that is beautiful that's but that's not the one there's there's it's on both sides you understand what i'm saying god saw you but there was something in you to respond back and to respond back to him not just anything we try to respond to other ways we try to respond to at this church or this belief or whatever it was in your life but it wasn't satisfying but she sees adam and something says that's the one there's the one now it was it was a fairytale wedding and they lived happily ever after and that was the last of the bible right no the tree of knowledge of good and knowledge was there and god knew they would partake of it so he had a purpose and that purpose was to show himself as a redeemer a healer a keeper a savior he had to prepare something for it so amongst the animals that adam named and eve saw there was a lamb that god put in the garden also now the lamb didn't know why it was in the garden but god knew why the lamb was placed in the garden and there came a day when adam and eve fell that the lamb had to be slain to clothe them and cover them with the blood god prepared something to meet that action already because the scripture tells us that he was slain from before the foundation of the world he had already planned this had already seen it now he's bringing it to pass now you know jesus had a choice when he gets to gethsemane and he's up there and he's asked his disciples to pray with him to spend some time there with him because he's coming to that decision in his life and he says father he says that this cup would pass from me that this way that has been planned and prepared in all is there a way we can do this differently is there a way without the shedding of blood but he had already known that the lamb had lost its life and he was the perfect lamb of god so he humbled himself and said not my will be done but your will be done because he had a plan and he had a purpose and he was going to do that so so we know that here now we go to genesis 3. chapter 3 god also put a serpent in there in the garden because there had to come away for a fall there had to come away for this plan to continue on now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and i just chose that that scripture just to start this portion i don't want to spend the whole time reading through the first two or three chapters of genesis and and we know they began to converse they began to talk and again god wasn't surprised by that god wasn't like oh no adam what are you doing come on go you know there was a plan there had to be a fall in order for god to continue the plan and the purpose of his life what he's doing so we know that she partakes of that tree and we know the fall so now we go to verse 21 of chapter three and unto adam also to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothe them the first death the first sacrifice that was made right here in the very beginning god took and shed the life or the blood of an innocent animal for his children to meet god's purpose and his plan so i just wanted to lay that out god from the beginning had a plan and he purposed these situations these things happen so he could bring it to pass so let's look at some of the things that that god did and some in the old testament and some in the new testament let's go to first kings 17 and we'll read verses 8-15 there are so many things as i was thinking into the names when you look at noah and you look at moses and you look at the different ones and see and we have the the ability to read in the scriptures how it took place but they were actually living it they were going through it and they probably questioned why why did this go this way why is this but god had a reason and the word of the lord came unto him saying arise get thee to zeropath which belongs to zidane and dwell there behold i have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee the story of elijah going down now the wooden widow woman did not know that's what she was there for she was as you'll see as we read on a little bit what she was saying but god said go down there i've commanded a widow woman to sustain thee and so he arose and went to zero path you know when god says go get up and go that's the best way get up and go and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widowman widow woman was there gathering of sticks and he called to her and said fetch me i pray thee a little water in a vessel that i may drink now he knows what's going to happen but she doesn't he knows what's going to happen and sometimes we don't but we trust in him he's proven himself over and over and she said and she and as she was going to fetch it he called her and said bring me i pray thee a morsel of bread in thine hand. and she said as the lord thy god liveth i have not a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil and a cruce and behold i am gathering two sticks that i may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die so we know she had no idea what was coming going to take place she was making preparations for what she thought was going to take place i'm down to my last meal with my son we're going to eat and then we're going to prepare to die and watch what elijah says and elijah said unto her fear not god says the same thing fear not through this time that we're going through right and everything that's happening fear not god has got a purpose and he has us under control go and do as that then i get to eat it too she said this is her thoughts you know but let me just say this elijah knew what was going to take place god had told him already and i want to say to you you already know what god has purposed and promised god has already said i will deliver i will return and and take her up to me there'll be a heaven there'll be a place god has already said that so we have to have that same trust that same confidence for thus saith the lord god of israel the barrel of mill shall not waste neither shall the cruce of oil fall until the day that the lord sinneth reign upon the earth and i like this and she went and did according to the saint of elijah and she and her house did eat many days when we come to that place in our lives lord at thy word i will do what you said i will take you at your word and go there and trust in that and look at her blessing it says and did he many days again god knew that daniel would be found him in this group did daniel know no daniel went i'm captive i'm caught we've been taken captive. now a person in prayer a person that has a relationship with god a person that has has known god and met god you're still human you still have those thoughts you still have those fears but something down inside of you says god has is in control there's a reason for this and that's what brings the peace in someone's life not because you can see the end not because he's given you a vision god's word says in romans 2 8 28 all things happen for our good all things even the things we don't like sometimes it says let's go on and the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat and of the wine which he drank so nourishing them three years that at the end thereof they might stand before the king now among these were the children of judah daniel hananiah michelle and azariah unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names for he gave daniel the name of belches hazard and to hanonais of shadrach and to michelle meshach and azariah of abednego but daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with a portion of the king's meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself the last verse now god had brought daniel into favor and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs so who was in charge of this whole thing god was now we know because we have the scriptures everything what happened there's 15 chapters in the book of daniel but daniel didn't know but he purposed in his heart not to defile himself and when you you get into a situation in your life something comes up something's different you're going into something you purpose in your heart god i don't understand the reason why i don't know why i'm in this position i don't know how i got here or why i'm into this but i purpose in my heart not to defile not to put down not to cause anything that would speak against you lord i don't understand the reason why but i purpose in my heart to stay true to the lord that's what daniel did here and god allowed him to find favor amongst his teachers now we know the read the story we could read all 15 chapters of daniel but i just wanted to tell you god did this god prepared the place for him to be because there was going to be a dream that was going to come by the king there was going to be prophetic that was going to speak of the times to come and daniel had to be there in order to interpret the dream because god had purposed that already to say so we could look in the scriptures today and we would know just know what was going to be happening even in our time daniel didn't know that but god did we think about daniel and the lion's den we think about the three hebrew children there when they're the young men when they're in the coming into the furnace they didn't know it would come to that but look what they purposed in their heart we will not bow down to the king even if he does not deliver us sometimes if we're not careful lord if you'll do this then i'll do that but what if we just take not my will but thy will be done lord and let him have his way because who knows better than him but to see that god had purposed this god made preparation for his purpose daniel had to be taken captive and taken into here with it with the king and all to allow god's word to come to pass and when we say lord i surrender use me you're allowing god to do what he wants to do you can sit there in the book of daniel for a long time all the things that god showed and is unveiled to us today because one man purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself before after daniel we'd go into luke chapter 19 verse 1-5 and jesus entered in pastor jericho and behold there was a man named zacchaeus which was the chief among the publicans and he was rich and he sought to see jesus who he was and could not for the for the press because he was of little stature uh we would say he was short no but he wanted to see who jesus was he had heard of jesus he knew he was coming and maybe zacchaeus thought and this is just as me my supposings zacchaeus thought is there a profit to be made in this i've made some money on everything else i've ventured into could we make some money on this situation because the bible says why would it say i was rich he was chief of mob why he was rich he had taken advantage okay he says let's go on and he ran before and he climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him for he was to pass that way now the sycamore tree was already there god didn't say oh my goodness zacchaeus i've got to go meet zacchaeus down there but he's too short what do i do do i get no there was a tree there god says i got to go past that way because zacchaeus is going to need to see me he's going to climb up on the tree now when did that tree get planted there i don't know but it was ready for that day god has looked down in your life and where you've gone where you've been through it i'm not saying that at times we haven't caused god to have to delay sometimes to have to push it because we look at some of the things that happen and you say lord if i had accepted you then had i turned my heart to then maybe i'd have gone through this and even brother branham said sometimes sometimes god allowed those things because he knew which choice he would make we wish we would have made every choice perfect the first time i never had to but maybe we'd be a bunch of little spoiled brats tail getting everything we want the first time and when jesus came to that place he looked up and saw him i don't think jesus just decided to look up in the tree for well there's a tree let's see what it looks like i think he knew that kiss was in the tree already he had already known what was coming to place and he said unto zacchaeus make haste and come down for today i must abide at thy house so god was on his way to zacchaeus house already but zacchaeus was going to climb up a tree to look upon jesus because he'd heard about him and based on the scriptures again i'm just assuming this i'm just saying zacchaeus is looking to see how he could profit from this because everything else he had done he had already made a profit he had already put some money in his bag he had no idea what prophet he would be making out of this an eternal prophet for his soul god was making his way down to zacchaeus house there was a tree there zacchaeus climbs a tree but god had seen it already if you it as time goes on you can look back at your life and say that was god that was god that was god it made me think a little bit during this time when i was saying when we first heard the message back around late 74 early 75 brother daniel ramirez some of you remember brother daniel was good friends with brother isaac noriega and brother daniel had received the message and he took it to his friend brother isaac noriega whose father was the pastor of the pentecostal church that my mother attended a little later in life when we would go visit grandma in california and go to the apostolic church brother isaac's father was a pastor there so there was a relationship between the jacon family and the noriega family already by chance no god knew this because brother daniel ramirez takes the message to brother isaac noriega who then passes it to my mom's side of the family who then they bring it to my our family down in southern california now right about the time that that happened my father injured his back in construction we lived in southern california my dad came home one day from work he was he was a cement worked with cement and those of you that know me you'll see us some similarities between my dad we like to play around we like to do things like that the girls know it quite well you know sometimes they're looking at me are you serious are you not are you just pulling on a beer you know but dad came home parked the truck he got out and he was literally bent over walking like this and the three of us boys saw dad when he came home and but that was not surprising because dad would do things like that middle of the night we had a wood screen door and it would bang in the storm and dad would call out and say aaron go see who's knocking at the door and it's all dark and aaron would get scared because dad could do it every day and i'd still get scared because i was supposed to go look at the door but dad was just playing we were kind of used to that so dad's walking around like that and i still remember saying okay dad this joke has gone long enough straighten up because we thought dad was playing but dad had injured his back and it was three months three to six months the dad struggled with that now you would look and say well that couldn't be but because of that it set a place for this message to come and for us to leave california and come to tucson god knew that now you know dad could testify to it all the things he went through moving from california getting here the the he had a union pension and social security and all that which had not been established yet we got here paid everything off that we owed in california got here with enough money to to buy a home cash and that was about all but god then meets the need the doctor told my father that he was going to go the back injuries was a whole lot more different than today there's things that they could do today that they didn't even think of back then this was 1976 you know the stuff they do with lasers and all the things that they do now and they told my dad that you are going to go through the most serious or the most painful back uh test that we're gonna do so dad called the ministers they came over and prayed for him while he was there in the hospital bed and this is his testimony and he fell asleep as the test was starting and he woke up when it was done and didn't feel anything but the bed was wet with a sweat god touched him healed his back the evidence of the injury stayed there therefore he was able to connect uh can uh receive the pensions and all and for the next 30 years or so he did missionary work in mexico central and south america god knew that now ask lord injure my back so i could do that no i would never ask that but god did that some of the things in our life we would look back and see god had a reason and he made preparation to fulfill his problem his purpose now there's a song that says we'll understand it in the by-and-by and i don't know that if there's going to be a questions and answer series in heaven if there's going to be a room wrong but but you know what i don't think it'll really matter then i'm home we're safe praise god but he realize that god is still the same yesterday today and forever after zacchaeus we would look here at in john the book of john i've always liked this this story here he left judea the speaking of jesus and departed again in the galley and he must needs go through samaria he had to go there was something he had to go do now we know the story this is about this the samaritan woman we know that he tells his disciples to go over to the town that was close by and go get some food and things i always felt that the reason he told that is because the disciples might not understand what he was doing when he goes to the well because he's going to meet a woman that is of a bad reputation that the men especially christian men shouldn't be around you know but he says he left judea and departed into galilee and he must needs go through samaria then cometh he to a city of samaria which is called sikhar near the parcel of ground that jo jacob gave to his son joseph now i like that it describes where it came jacob gave this to his son joseph to put a well there because there was a woman of samaria that was going to need to be at a well so jesus could meet her there if water was then if water had been brought and delivered to her house she would not been at the well but he must need to go through samaria now jacob's well was there jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour and jesus says man i'm glad there's a well here i needed a place to sit down and some water to drink no it already said he knew he had to go that way and there was a reason why there cometh a woman with samara to draw water and jesus says unto her give me to drink and her what's her response wait a minute why are you doing it even she has a question why are you here because you know why i'm here at this time i'm not allowed to come with the virgins i'm not allowed to come with the good sisters my reputation is you know but go but jesus says there's a reason why today is a day of your salvation and all of this was prepared all of this was ready all of this was planned by god and those of you that have lived long enough and experienced enough you can look back now and say that was god that was god and that was god therefore if that was god then looking down the road this way that will be god that will be god and that will be god it hasn't changed we know the story of that he begins to speak to her and she tells them i said you know you shouldn't have anything to do with me and he tells her draw me some water and and began to lay and what is the day of the visit the visitation for her salvation she gets up and she runs into the city and says come says her husband some years ago and he was close to 70 years old when he gave his heart to the lord but it came that time yes she gave her heart his lord he was with her all this time but it was until he was close to 70 years old that we baptized him up here brother branham is on the other side remember beyond the curtain of time and a sister comes up to him and says my precious brother he says you don't know me she says no she goes i was 90 years old when i gave my heart to the lord god has a time god has a place god has a purpose and it will come to pass because he never fails so i want us to listen to this it's about between 13 and 15 minutes long from the message i know my redeemer liveth and a brother had had posted this a portion of this quote of this portion of the message and i read it and it fits so perfect so i opened it up to read it and you read one then you read two chapters then you go down i say well how do i eliminate i can't leave that out and i began to read and i said well we can just play it and we can hear it also if the brothers would would then it's i know my redeemer liveth and as it's finishing up sister martha it's about 13 minutes long just kind of right about there and then the musicians can come up so let's listen to that then there is nothing can destroy us until god's purpose is fulfilled nothing can harm us until that purpose that god has perished here far has been made manifest no matter how much trouble we have how much heartaches our sorrows that we go through all of these are reasons and there's a reason for it we will take for instance noah in the bible there was a flood that came on and all the earth was destroyed the vegetation and everything was destroyed but noah and the seed that he had taken into the earth god's purpose can never be defeated there is nothing can defeated so how happy are we to be today resting upon that beautiful revelation of the word of the living god that there is neither things present nor things that can come there's no sickness no sorrow no death no perils nor nothing can separate us from the purpose of the living god what god has imagined in his mind what god has purposed in his heart to bring to pass there is no demon there is no power there is nothing can ever separate god's great immortal inter-eternal plan it must be as god has said then we find that in the days that all of the world was going to be destroyed by a flood that god made a preparation a preparation for what caused to preserve his purpose he did it in the days of noah and he's doing it today he has made a preparation to conserve to his own purpose he will conserve a church he will conserve a people he will conserve subjects for his great domain that death cannot destroy and we realize that it is by faith that we believe in it but the resurrection produces a solid foundation on which our faith rests nothing can destroy the poet once wrote oh what a foretaste of glory divine aerosalvation purchase of god borned off his spirit washed in his blood what an assurance upon this solid rock the resurrection of our blessed lover the lord jesus nothing can destroy it it has been planted it is the seed of god it is a purpose of god to give us the blessed holy spirit it is the purpose of god to show us signs and wonders and miracles it's the purpose of god and nothing can destroy it all powers of hell might wager against it but it will prevail we have god's eternal promises there may be teachers there may be isms rise there may be great programs rise there may be things that look like that it would be destroyed but it can never be destroyed it is the purpose of god to see that it will prevail that is not up to me and it's not up to you whether it will be destroyed or not it's up to god and we can rest assured on it that god will never let our heritage be destroyed for it's his purpose to give it to us now we would think also today upon destructions trying to destroy we have christ on promise we think of the hebrew children when god had a purpose for them when they were down in babylon and the furnace was hit seven times hotter than it ever was heated to destroy the purpose of god and the whole fabulous honor rage they were determined satan was to destroy the purpose of god for he knew those children was going into the furnace so he made the furnace when they heated it seven times hotter to be sure that the program of god would be destroyed but god wanted to display his power and all babylon and all hell could not defeat that purpose no sir no matter if they could have heated furnace a million times hotter it would have never destroyed the purpose of god god wanted to show that he was a god of deliverance and he'd bring deliverance to whoever he desired to bring him and nothing would interfere with his program so when they heated the furnace little did shadrach meshach and abednego know that they were coming from that furnace for they said themselves our god is able to deliver us but nevertheless we will not bow to the image god had someone who would serve him and his purpose would not be defeated fire can not cannot defeat the purpose of god's plan i know how i'd love to say this this morning all the hydrogen bombs in the world can never defeat the resurrection of his church all explaining away and all of the mathematics and and so forth that this intelligent world has disguised to your purpose to do something about to destroy the faith of god's children it will never do it that faith will live on forever it was the purpose of god to show that he had power over the wild beasts of the fields and they put some lines in a cave one time and they had starved them until they were so hungry that they could
