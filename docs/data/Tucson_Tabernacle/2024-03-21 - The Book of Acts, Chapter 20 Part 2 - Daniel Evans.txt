another opportunity to come together in the name above all names the name of Jesus Christ and Lord as we open this Bible tonight in this Bible study we pray that that you'd be with us and father that we would leave here tonight better people than when we came Lord that the Holy Spirit would be here among this small group of people but Lord I know it's comforting to know that in this Bible in the book of Acts that the Ephesians there were just a handful of people there and father you bless them so richly may it be a blessing the same blessing for us tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you all you can take your seeds thank you sister hope it's good to have my boy back [Applause] it's nice to give you an Applause [Laughter] I friends going through this book of Acts has been just such such a blessing to me and learning about it and that's devoting these Wednesday nights to learning this how the holy spirit moves among his people and knowing that these are just normal people and that they are very similar to us and I got to tell you reading about the Apostle Paul has been such an encouragement to me he that man if I've ever read to these scriptures and if I've ever seen a Christian aside from the Lord Jesus himself this man Paul was a true Christian and I think in in tonight's lesson that we're gonna see that how dedicated this man was and um if I could be like anybody in the world I think it'd be like him he was just he was a great man sisters it's good to have you and church thank you for joining us on Wednesday our Bible study in the book of Acts um a found in uh I found in a description of the Apostle Paul I remembered I heard brother Branham do it say it one time and I couldn't find it and and there is an Apocrypha book that was written just after Paul's time it's called the acts of Paul and thecla what it is is it's a uh it's an old story it's probably a fictional story about Paul and this young lady who Paul had influenced to give her heart to the Lord and in this book and like I said it's it's an apocryphal book so it's not considered uh New Testament Canon it's not considered by the scholars as being inspired because there are some things that don't necessarily line up with the scriptures but it still is in fact that old and it was the way that it was written it was it's probably a good description of the apostle and it's pretty much all that we have as far as a description of how this how this man looked it's called as I said it's called the acts of Paul and thecla and it says this it says and it was originally written in Greek and like I said it's written about 2000 years ago it says this he was a man of middling size and depending on the translation that you get uh the other translations also call them short so he was a man not a tall stature but but short bald or shaved head that's my favorite part about his description his legs were a little crooked or bowed his knees were projecting and he had large eyes and his eyebrows met and his nose was somewhat long and listen to this he and he was full of grace and mercy at one time he seemed like a man and at another time he seemed like an angel yeah I believe it was probably an accurate rendition like I said it was probably written by at least Consulting P the people that probably actually actually knew Paul um and there are a little bit of hints in the scripture about the Apostle just the the manner of man that he was in second Corinthians Paul is addressing some things that people had said about him and he says this for some say Paul Paul is quoting others he said for some say quote his letters are weighty and forceful but in person now this is scripture but in person he is unimpressive and his speaking amounts to nothing that's what they said about Paul and Paul is addressing that and then Paul says this and you get a little hint of Paul's personality he said such people should realize that what we are in our letters when we are absent we will be in our actions when we are present he was a man and and Paul would address these things and Paul in Acts chapter 23 he uh he says this he says Paul well acts 23 what's happening is Paul's on trial here and he comes before the high priest and this high priest Paul probably knew who probably knew the man it was caiaphasis but he probably didn't know that he was high priest at the time and had that that rank and he says it says this Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin and said my brothers I have fulfilled my duty to God in all good conscience to this day and the high priest ananias I'm sorry it was ananias not cafes and the high priest ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth now watch The Temper raise up then Paul said to him God will strike you you whitewashed wall you sit there to judge me according to the law yet you yourself violate the wall the law by commanding that I'd be struck he got up now listen to this then those were standing near Paul remember Paul didn't know he was the high priest at the time then those standing near Paul said how dare you insult God's high priest Paul replied replied Brothers I didn't realize that he was the high priest for it is written do not speak evil about the ruler of your people show us Paul do you see he got smacked and he lashed out but then he knew the word and he backed off and he said no I know it's not right to say something against against our rulers so Paul had a personality it seems that he was quick to battle he was quick to draw those guns on some but then with others he just seemed to have endless patience he had humility when he said I'm the chiefest of sinners but then he also had Supreme confidence when he said this in second correct second Corinthians he said unless I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of Revelation there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure so Paul was he was actually very confident also in in his beliefs and and his uh his understanding of the word now in this Acts chapter 20 . Paul had been traveling all around and and he'd be he'd been visiting all of these churches do you remember what he was doing when he was visiting all these churches he was taking up an offering he was going from church to church and he was taking up this money so he could bring it back to the Believers in Jerusalem because there was a very hard time going there so Paul it blessed me so much when I read that and I really understood what was going on that these are the people that really gave him problems and yet he loved them and he did everything he could for him he went to all these new churches that he probably started took up these offerings and then it was in his mind to go back to Jerusalem so where we ended up in Acts chapter 20 Paul was with this doctor named Luke who actually also wrote the whole book of Acts so we know that Luke was an eyewitness here he was also a physician and we have this this boy named eudicus and he's up in the third story of the the building and he falls asleep in church and that's the reason don't do it so I'll be watching so I'm just kidding so he he fought he's watching you Daniel so he he falls asleep in church and he lands and he dies this young boy so Luke's Luke's here he's the doctor he's on the scene and then Paul comes out and he lays his body over this young man and the young man is revived and I played last on the last study that we had I played a video that I actually took of a resurrection that happened in church when a man that I'm very good friends with I've known him ever since I was born a man named James Jackson died in church while I was there in the Branham Tabernacle in Jeffersonville Indiana I saw him dead there was a doctor present there was my brother who was a paramedic was present this man was dead they couldn't get any type of vital signs on him and he was actually dead after we did the math he was dead between 30 minutes and an hour and um the Lord brought him back to life and that was I don't know five years ago five or six years ago Daniel was there five or six years ago and he's still alive and doing well in this very day James James Jackson as I said a good friend of my family so we see that that this happened and then we ended our study there in Acts chapter 20 verse 12. so let's start with Acts chapter 20 verse 13. so then it was so sweet so Paul just loves the people so much so he actually after this happened with uticus and he preached so long at night he just decides this is the last time he's going to see these people he just decides to stay up all night with him fellowshipping and talking about the Lord so they stayed up all night verse 13 and we went before to ship we it's very very important here because it says that the author of this book the book of Acts is a long for the ride now so Luke is writing he says I was there and Luke as I'll show in a little bit Luke gives these little hints in the book of Acts and and he's just he's a beautiful writer he gives doctrinal hints and then he's also giving a hint that's saying hey I wasn't doing the research like I was for my gospel of Luke he says I wasn't doing the research like that I was actually there when this happened and we went before the ship and sailed to Asos they're intending to take Paul for so he had appointed minding himself to go afoot so he walked these guys rode in the boat and they met and when we met and when he met with us at Asos we took him in and came to middling and we sailed thence and came the next day over to chios and the next day we arrived at Samos and tarried at trojulum and the next day we came to my lead us for Paul had determined to Sail by Ephesus because he would not spend the time in Asia for he had he hasted if it were possible for him to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost so this day of Pentecost as you as you probably already know what we've we've heard brother Lyle he's he's very learned in in these different feast days Pentecost was basically a holiday for the Jewish people and he wanted to be in Jerusalem for this holiday or this feast day and um his we see the remainder of the book of Acts is that Paul had it on his heart to go to Jerusalem and then from Jerusalem Paul wanted to go to Rome and that is basically the rest of the book of Acts is his desire to eventually get to Rome and from malidas he sent to Ephesus and called the Elders of the church now so they they came to my leadest which was on the coast and Ephesus was about 50 miles away so what is going on here is Paul sends to the brethren in Ephesus the Elders of the church and he says hey I'm not going to come to Ephesus but I want you to come to my lead us over here so we can have this meeting and this sermon is different than any other of the sermons given in the book of Acts it's addressed to Christian leadership so this one is an anomaly in pretty much in this whole Testament New Testament this is it's ministers meeting basically what it is it's Paul getting the elders together and he says Hey travel over here and I want to talk about some of these things and we're going to see why that he wants to talk about these things it's actually it's a very sad story and when they were come to him he said unto them ye know from the first day that I came into Asia after what Manner I have been with you at all seasons now he's talking about Asia he's talking about Asia Minor Ephesus was located in this Asian Minor it was the big city there now these people he says this he says after what Manner I have been with you at all seasons so these people knew Paul he was there for a long time he's there for over three years they knew Paul and they had seen the way that this man Paul lived they saw his personal life and he's saying he's saying hey look at me you've seen me in All Seasons you've seen the kind of person that I am and it made me think as I read that it's it's made me think that how important is the life that we live to other everyone else we hear so much that you it's not so important that you preach me a sermon but live me a sermon that life that we live is so much more powerful than the words that we say and that's what Paul is saying he's saying hey he's saying look at me I'm backing up what I preach I'm backing this up with my life verse 19 he says serving the Lord with all humility of mind and with many tears and temptations which befell me by the lying in weight of the Jews key word here is humility Paul says here he says serving the Lord with all humility of mind and remember he's speaking to ministers he's speaking to leaders in the times when someone gets a position of authority there you see their character come out a lot of times you see some people will sit back and want everyone else to do the work you'll see others that Jesus said he said that they want the high places in the synagogues and when people pass them on the street they want people to say hello Pastor they want they want that recognition they want to be recognized at weddings or at Social functions and then there's others that that we've seen that they want to paycheck you know they they like the word maybe and they've got a good Revelation but then they decide that that hey I want to just make a living off of the church and then there's others they have a spirit once they get in there they have a spirit of control and as time goes by they want to start to control your personal life not encourage you not say Daniel you shouldn't be doing this or doing that but they want control and we see that so often from the pulpit and and then when you don't do what they say many times they will attack you from the pulpit and I got to tell you as far as as a Minister doing that it's easier to do that than it is to go to that person one-on-one because they can't fight back and they're out there in the audience and you can preach this and they know that you're preaching against them but they can't respond they can't fight back and that's many of the ministers do that but Paul says this he says with all humility of mind with tears and temptations that came really from the traps of his own people of his own brethren from the people that he knew that stabbed him in the back these Jewish people that came against him and Peter says in in his epistle Peter says that these trials are like pure gold because they build these trials these suffering that we have they build our character Revelation Chapter 3 Verse 18 it says I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire and that's building that Christian character that thou mayest be rich in white Raymond and that thou mayest be clothed and the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isav that I may as see as many as I love Jesus speaking as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent so these trials that we have it's building our character and you're going to see that as as Paul goes on with this with this sermon Paul goes on he says how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you but I've showed you and have taught you publicly and from house to house testifying both to the Jews and also to the Greeks repentance towards God and Faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ remember again he's talking to Elders here he's talking to ministers and it makes me go back he says I haven't held anything back from you it makes me think about this book of of the of First Corinthians where he writes this letter to the Corinthians church and it was addressing problems it was telling it was the the women were causing problems in the church the men were divorcing their wives the young people were sleeping around and they had gifts operating in the church but the gifts were all out of order and it was it was like emotion was starting to replace the Holy Spirit and Paul says to the official Ephesians here he said I held nothing back from you so Paul many times most of the time it's hard to make a stand it's very very difficult especially maybe for a minister and these are ministers here it's hard to make a decision because you want to please everyone but if you if you go through and you try to please everyone you're going to end up pleasing no one and everyone is going to start fighting and and there's going to be all these problems and Paul here he's saying I didn't do that I didn't hold anything back I told you the truth and we're gaining knowledge here in this book of Acts and and remember we need to always Place ourselves in this book we need to always place in the scriptures they're just not for history they're to place ourselves there and to make us better better people Paul as I said in our last bible study on this Acts chapter 20 on part one I said that that there's different callings in the church and there's different types of worship sometimes that that worship is is very Lively and sometimes it's it's loud and it's and it's it's active and then other times it's quiet and it's it's peaceful and then other times it's like this where it's learning everyone it's it's all equal we have to have all of it we need that power we need that emotion in the church but we don't have to have it every single time we need that teaching and that deep understanding but we can also have worship at other times the even even to where God even separates the ministry and he said I gave some apostles and I gave some Prophets and I gave some evangelists and some pastors and some teachers all of these different gifts operating in the church and all very very different different ways so Paul and then Paul says here he says I taught both publicly like Sunday morning and then from house to house he's showing a variety in the ministry Ministry and then he talks about repentance and the ministry brings correction and that results in Repentance verse number 22. and now behold I go Bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there save that the Holy Ghost Witnesses in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me another translation says the Holy Ghost Witnesses in every city saying that bonds and tribulations await me so we think and we're going to get on as as we get to chapter 21 and Beyond we're gonna we're gonna see that people he said the Holy Spirit gave witness that I'm going to suffer not only did that Holy Spirit reveal it to Paul but it also spoke through a prophetic Ministry in other places where they said Paul if you leave here if you go to Jerusalem like you're planning on going you're going to suffer you're going to be bound you might be going to your death we see that the brothers that were gifted telling Paul that and then we see the Holy Spirit revealing and also to Paul saying saying you're going to suffer but just because you suffer doesn't mean you're out of God's will you know so often we think we think that well because I am I I'm suffering I may have lost my job or am I I might have had this bad thing happen or my children might be going astray or something like that like I did something wrong but it's not always the case suffering is part of being a Christian and Paul says that he says I'm going and I'm going Bound in the spirit so he knows that he's going over here to Jerusalem to suffer but then he says that I am bound I have to do what the Holy Spirit leads where you say well Paul he told you you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna get arrested and all these things you're gonna suffer over there but he didn't tell him not to go Paul through the Holy Spirit also knew that he was supposed to go to suffer these things in another place Paul calls himself a prisoner of Christ I I think about that and I think about how I would love Lord if you would Grant something to me let that be me whatever the Lord has whatever would please the Lord let me let me fall right into that Lord bind my hands and my feet Lord let me be bound by your Holy Spirit just guide me Lord I don't have to I don't have to win in this world I don't have to be successful I don't have to I don't even have to be happy Lord let me just be in your will and Paul he he had the goods and the old saying he put his money where his mouth is he really did so he knows he's going he knows he's going to Jerusalem he knows he's going to suffer and he says this but none of these things move me neither count I my my life dear unto myself so that I might finish my course with joy and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of God look at the dedication of the apostle why was this all so important to him because he loved the people he genuinely had a love for these people that he was preaching to in fact it was more important to Paul that these people came to the Lord than even for himself I'm going to say something that's not going to make sense but I'm going to read it right out of the Bible Paul in Romans chapter 9. verse 1. Paul says this I say the truth in Christ I lie not so Paul is laying a foundation here saying listen I'm not kidding around when I say this I really mean it I'm not just saying it because it sounds good he says I lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart for I could wish that myself were cursed from Christ for my brethren my Kinsmen according to the flesh who are Israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the and the glory and Covenants and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises let that sink in he said that I would rather me not not just suffer not not just go to the cross he says I would rather me be cursed from Christ than them I can almost it almost doesn't even I don't know how someone could be so sincere and Paul says I lie not and he says my my conscience also bearing Bears me witness he said I would rather me suffer I would rather be me condemned than these people my brethren in Jerusalem and do you remember what they did to him those brothers from Jerusalem they came down and all these all these churches that Paul had started in galatia and all these places they came down from Jerusalem and started preaching their legalistic Doctrine starting causing all these problems and yet Paul said I would rather me be cursed from Christ than these people these legalistic self-consumed Jews I would rather that have given him so much problem I would rather me be cursed than them almost talk about the spirit of Christ so Paul is he he says I would rather me be cursed and then I think about the Lord Jesus Not only was Jesus cursed for the sins of the people Jesus became the chiefest of sinners for all of us for those people that hated him for the people that spit in his face and look at that Spirit of Christ it comes right down here into this man Paul I think how tremendous how tremendous to have that spirit that is what can change the world that is what can start a Revival is that Spirit right there and now behold verse number 25 in in Acts 20. and now behold I know that ye all among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God shall see my face no more Paul doesn't know what's going to happen if he leaves and goes to Jerusalem but he knows it isn't going to be easy wherefore I take you to record this day that I am pure from the blood of all men for I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God what a scripture I want a scripture to say and look what happened to Paul when he did this his own people the Jews they hated him because he didn't preach the prophet Moses's Doctrine he didn't he didn't preach circumcision he didn't preach a certain way of dressing he didn't preach a certain way of eating he didn't preach certain days to worship how to wash your hands how to how to wash your dishes and everything else yet Paul said he didn't preach what Moses preached yet Paul said I have not shunned to declare unto you the whole counsel of God wow I think as a as a minister I I when I die I want to be able to say the same thing and I didn't I didn't hold anything back that whatever the Lord laid on my heart no matter if it gets you it gets me in trouble no matter if it sends me as Paul sends me to this place where I'm going to suffer Lord let me say it you know I you think about the country think about not standing up for what's right they got this whole thing with uh with Disney you seen this with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs have you seen what's going on they're not dwarfs anymore because they were afraid of offending little people so they make this new movie and they got no Dwarfs what kind of a snow white story is that but they were afraid of offending the the little people so they didn't make them dwarf so you know what they did they got all of the uh the little actors they got them all mad at them because they're saying like this is Snow White we should be given the job now you're giving the job to the normal size people they don't they they were trying not to offend everybody and they offended they end up offending everybody and if you don't make a decision if you're worried about what everybody thinks then you'll fail and you just cause a bunch of fighting and then you mess up the whole fairy tale of Snow White and you'll mess up the word too it's a type I'm trying to make a type of not standing up for what is right that you'll ruin everything look about the leadership in this this country and all you all know what I'm not even going to talk about the uh the Beer Company sin wrong wrong and they don't want to offend anybody so they get this weirdo and then most of the country is offended because they're afraid of offending someone and it just causes all kinds of trouble that was not the Apostle yet he did everything in love he loved these people he didn't want to see them lost he didn't want to see them suffer I'm sure he spent countless hours on his knees praying for him and he said yet they they come against me and they've done all these things against me yet I love them and I would rather me be cursed instead of them foreign you know it's not it's not what we don't do for God that matters you know you say you say I don't drink I don't smoke I don't look like the world I don't dress like the world I don't go to movies I don't watch TV I don't I don't I don't go outside my house I don't do this I don't do that that's great I don't witness to anyone I don't reach out to the lost I don't spend more than 20 minutes in prayer I don't give offerings to the Lord outside my ties I don't read my Bible I don't do I don't reach out to the Sinners I don't teach my children to reach out to Sinners I don't I don't stay I don't stay in my little church group I stay in my little church group and I do nothing for God how many of us fall into that same thing I don't do it I don't do this I don't do that I don't do that it's not what you don't do for God that matters it's what you do for him you don't sin because you love him but you also serve him serve him is not not doing something serving him is doing something take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers to feed the Church of God which hath which he hath purchased with his own blood now let me quickly go through each thing that he says here take heed therefore unto yourselves he said because I'm leaving therefore you pastors you leaders you elders you need to be right in the eyes of the Lord before you can lead the church and if if your air conditioner goes out in your car at this time of year you don't want to go to the mechanic and and a boy come out and say yeah you know my dad taught me how to change the oil one time I think I can fix your air conditioner you don't want somebody like that you want somebody that knows how to do it and it's and that's what Paul's trying to teach these these ministers here these Elders he's saying that take heed unto yourselves like I've told the story about flying you get the you get in the airplane and you sit there you know and you you're you're getting ready and you're squeezed in there and here comes here comes the flight attendant out and they give you this little play before you take off and they tell you about the oxygen mask and how you're supposed to put the oxygen mask on yourself before you put the oxygen mask on your kids it's because you need to have that oxygen flowing first because if you don't have that oxygen flowing you're going to pass out and you're not going to be able to save anyone and that's the same thing with the ministry we need to make sure that we have the Holy Spirit that we know this Bible that we can explain the Bible when someone has a problem when a couple is is thinking about divorce we need to be able to take it back to the word all from the gifts of the Spirit to Adam and Eve and The Serpent and the relationship there and and how they're there were all Jewish prophets and can you explain how God could send a gentile prophet and and all of these things we need to be able to explain these things we need to have that oxygen flowing or we're not doing good do a good job and that's what Paul is saying here all the way to the deepest of all the doctrines in the Bible the one that the apostles taught about the most every Apostolic sermon and that is salvation through the blood of Jesus Christ it's the most important part of the book is that everything else pales in comparison to it and he says there he says take heed to yourselves and to all the flock so make sure you've received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then you teach others to to receive that baptism also over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers who made you the overseer the holy the Holy Ghost did and he tells the elders to feed the Church of God Paul tells these Elders from Ephesus he said to feed the Church of God which God hath purchased with his own blood now remember I said Luke and how he slips in a little Doctrine here and there this is one of those times Luke puts in this Doctrine and he says which he has purchased with his own blood so why is that so important God purchased with his own blood so what does that tell you so Jesus and God are the same one because it was Jesus right that bled on the cross so if God purchased our salvation with his own blood it's doctrine of the godhead that Jesus is divine now let me read you something let me read you another translation of the Bible the new world translation of the Bible says this to the shepherd the congregate to to Shepherd the congregation of God which he purchased with the blood of his own son why would you change that why would you change it from God with his own blood to the blood of his own son it's because you don't believe that that Jesus is God that translation is a New World Translation it's Jehovah Witness so they're just changing they said no it's literally translated that that uh which he had purchased with his own blood but they didn't actually mean that you know you find a hireling translator translator and you can make it say anything that you want verse number 29 for I know this that after my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them so these wolves will come from outside and they will also come from inside they'll come from right inside the church and then they'll come from evangelists or whatever whatever it is coming in and causing problems but remember the wolf kills the Sheep it never builds Unity it never builds love it's these you have to look at these and you you judge as Jesus said you judge these wolves by the fruits uh what they produce Deuteronomy 18. verse 21 says this if thou say in thine heart how shall we know the word which the Lord hath not spoken when a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord if the thing follow not nor come nor come to pass that thing which the Lord hath not that is that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously Thou shalt not be afraid of him so many times you'll hear these prophecies and you hear oh the Lord's telling me this be careful of that I wish I had time I think maybe I'll I'll preach on this on another on another service but I will say this they use Christ as a reference these wolves that come in it's always Jesus Jesus Jesus but it's always something more than Jesus that they teach you need something more you need you need something other than Jesus in addition to Jesus and it ends up that it's always about them it's always about well I am special I have this gift I have that gift rather than pointing the people to Christ they begin to point the people to themselves and that's these wolves therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears so he's saying I warned you you know me I was with you for three years you know my Ministry you know that I'm sincere and I'm warning you and now Brethren I commend you to God and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are Sanctified I have coveted no man's silver or gold or apparel this doesn't need any commentary listen to him ye yay ye yourselves know that with thee that these hands have ministered under my necessities and to them that were with me I have showed you all things how that's so laboring ye ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive when I was driving up today I saw outside there was um this young lady and she was tripping on something bad and I saw brother Ben he opened the door and he had and I was driving by and he had two bottles of water and and he had compassion on the young lady and I watched me to know I was watching and I and I watched him go up and and he that he gave her this water and and she was all over the place and and I watched it for a little bit and then she went over on the on the side over here obviously strung out on drugs and I thought wow that uh very kind man laboring you ought to support the weak as what Paul said here so I walked up and she uh she walked by and she was she was going crazy and and I said I said sister I said you need to settle down took off running and then she comes back and she basically said I really like that man but not you so she liked brother Ben oh um God bless him you know he had compassion it says here how that's soul laboring you ought to support the weak and to remember the words of our Lord Jesus how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive you know it's one of the most famously quoted things brother Silas I'm going to tell you something you didn't know that's one of the most famously quoted scriptures that Jesus said it is more blessed to give than to receive did you know that there is no record of Jesus saying that anywhere in the Gospels we have all the record of what Jesus said it's not there this is the only place and it's in red right here this is the only place that it is in the whole Bible and Paul who never knew Jesus somehow got this quote from the Lord even though it's not written in the four Gospels Bible study and when he had thus spoken he kneeled down and prayed with them all and they all wept sore and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him souring most of all for The Words which he spake that they should see his face no more and they accompanied him under the ship sister hope you can come Daniel musicians brother Aaron if you can make ready the closing statements of the Apostle Paul to the Brethren at Ephesus and he says he says he says they kneel down the Apostle Luke the author he says they kneel down and they prayed with them all and I thought it was so sweet that they wept these dear friends these dear Elders these brothers got together all together and I could just see them all around each other and weeping because they knew what was going to happen to their dear friend Paul then they they knew that he was going to go to Jerusalem they knew that he was going to suffer they didn't know what was going to be the end but they one thing that they did know is they were never going to see this man again and how much they meant how much Paul meant to them and in his closing statements I really appreciate that in verse 26 Paul said wherefore I take you to record this day that I am pure from the blood of all men for I have not shunned to declare unto you all the Council of God I wish I could have been there I wish I could have been there I gave this description of Paul what he looked like I think of him saying he says I lie not and he says my conscience Bears me witness that I would rather me be cursed Christ than you even though you've done me all these problems even though that that you've come against me you have fought me you're still my people and I love you more than anything in the world we can't this this these it wasn't saying that to the Ephesians he was saying that back to those people in Jerusalem that that had done them so wrong I think Lord what kind of a Christian was this man Paul he to me [Music] aside from our Lord what an example what what a great great man he was wonderful and he was bold [Music] I'm just kidding God bless you all I pray that you've you got a little bit out of Acts chapter 20 brother lie I'm looking forward to let me give you a little taste of what's coming in in chapter 21. all of these people I said it earlier all of these people start prophesying and they start telling that Paul not to go but even with all of the prophecies even with all of the spirit moving even with everything that was happening Paul still followed the leading of the Lord for himself and went to Jerusalem and you know what brother Lyle they were both right the prophets that prophesied that tried to not tried to get him not to go they were right they were prophesying unto the Holy Spirit they were writing what they said and Paul was right in going he was writing and going to Jerusalem and bringing that money and trying to win these Souls and then we're gonna see now things get really tough our friend the Apostle Paul God bless you all over there [Music] have foreign [Music] [Music] oh Lord my heart is open won't you come inside [Music] above open all the window I've thrown wide every at home come inside dear Lord I need you more and more and more oh Lord my heart is open won't you come inside oh fill up all my being Ever [Music] After All every day [Music] Jeremy is
