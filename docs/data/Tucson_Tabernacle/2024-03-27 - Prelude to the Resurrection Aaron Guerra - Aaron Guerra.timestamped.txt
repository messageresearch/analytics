[30:23] older folks in church but when you see
[30:26] the youth participating and it's so
[30:28] encouraging yes amen let's just bow our
[30:33] heads Lord this this evening
[30:37] and what is called the Easter season the
[30:40] Easter
[30:42] week the passion week Lord
[30:48] It's you we think about it we look into
[30:51] it
[30:52] we we wonder what it was like we have
[30:54] the scriptures we but ought to have been
[30:57] the
[31:00] and see it Lord ourselves but through
[31:03] your word tonight
[31:06] Lord just see what it was and what you
[31:08] did and why
[31:11] Lord and we want to love you for it and
[31:14] appreciate it so much tonight Lord
[31:17] Jesus so as we speak your word Lord Just
[31:19] Have Your Way in Jesus Christ's name
[31:23] amen amen you may be seated God bless
[31:27] you
[31:32] brother Dan had asked me several weeks
[31:35] ago while taking that this first week or
[31:39] the week of
[31:40] Easter leading to Resurrection Sunday
[31:46] morning and I got nervous and I
[31:50] got it's such
[31:53] a it's it's what this book is written
[31:56] about right
[31:58] amen because without Easter without that
[32:01] Resurrection morning it's hopeless for
[32:03] us that's right
[32:05] amen
[32:07] but we know that Jesus even said father
[32:10] if if it's if it's your will could this
[32:13] cup pass from
[32:15] me but he said not my will but thy will
[32:18] be done
[32:20] show and this talking with brother
[32:22] Daniel and he and I said brother Daniel
[32:24] I can't teach like you and brother Lyall
[32:26] do and he said no just go ahead and
[32:28] preach it the way you
[32:29] do so we're able to say yes Lord
[32:34] and it's
[32:37] uh you have to go into
[32:40] eternity if I could say it that
[32:42] way to find where this was motivated
[32:46] from what God had
[32:48] started to be recorded in the
[32:53] scriptures but see in
[32:56] God
[32:59] uh brother Braham said he wasn't God
[33:01] because God is an object of
[33:04] worship anything that you worship that
[33:07] you spend your time you give your time
[33:09] for becomes a God in your
[33:12] life he said so and as there was nothing
[33:17] to worship
[33:20] him but there were attributes in him
[33:22] there was something that wanted to be
[33:24] expressed wanted to be displayed to be a
[33:27] avor to be a
[33:29] Healer to be all the things that he
[33:33] is and is and I can only think of it as
[33:36] I can think of
[33:37] it or as a song says if you could only
[33:42] imagine and and you begin to think what
[33:45] was it
[33:47] like let going ask brother Jordan to to
[33:51] play this
[33:53] quote as we get started from I am the
[33:57] resurrection and the
[33:59] life just a few
[34:03] minutes if he would do
[34:10] that the B if you just open up your mind
[34:13] that he was only a man I said do it by
[34:15] the Bible and I'll believe
[34:17] it she said when he went down to that
[34:20] resurrection of Lazarus said on his Ro
[34:22] down there he cried with the rest of the
[34:24] people the Bible said Jesus wept and
[34:26] that Pro that he was
[34:31] I said he might have cried that's true
[34:34] on his road down to need Lazarus he was
[34:36] human as far as human is concerned in
[34:38] his flesh he was human but in his Spirit
[34:41] he was God I said he cried that was a
[34:44] man crying he was a man when he was
[34:46] crying going down to Lazarus grave but
[34:49] when he stood there straighten that
[34:50] little frame up and said la come forth
[34:53] and a man had been dead 4 days come to
[34:56] life again that was more than a man that
[34:58] was B speaking to there
[35:02] hallah God was son that was God she can
[35:06] do Mar can do it Master believe Sal
[35:11] this he was a man when he got down that
[35:14] mountain that night come down and look
[35:16] all around that little fig tree there
[35:18] and he wasn't doesn't eat he was hungry
[35:20] he was a man when he was hungry but when
[35:22] he took five biscuits and two PES and
[35:24] fed 5,000 people that was more than a
[35:27] man that was God in the man
[35:31] Hallelujah he was the man when on back
[35:34] of that night when 10,000 devs of the
[35:37] sea SW they were drowning the little
[35:39] Storm come up the little B pitching like
[35:41] a father stoer out there on that Lake
[35:43] right that devil said we tonight he was
[35:46] so tired virt G out of him all day from
[35:48] preaching and healing he was so tired
[35:50] the stor didn't wak him up in the
[35:53] disciples bring he was a man laying
[35:55] there sleeping when he put his foot up
[35:57] on the Bri
[36:01] [Music]
[36:11] [Music]
[36:23] [Music]
[36:57] will provide himself a
[37:02] sacrifice and as I read that or as I was
[37:05] listening about the the message and I
[37:08] just saw that God will provide himself a
[37:10] sacrifice or God will provide himself a
[37:15] sacrifice amen he didn't say you're
[37:18] going to have to do it for
[37:19] yourself he said I will
[37:23] amen and then you have to see Christ in
[37:27] everyt
[37:28] scripture cuz this is about
[37:31] him from the front to the back and every
[37:35] page and it's it was God wanted to
[37:39] express
[37:41] himself brother Bram says he wasn't God
[37:44] he was God but there wasn't nothing else
[37:47] no worship so God is an object of
[37:51] worship and there was nothing to worship
[37:53] him so there was attributes in him to to
[37:56] be that to be a savior to be a Healer to
[38:00] be all the things that he
[38:02] is they were in
[38:05] him before time even began there was
[38:08] that but there was no way to express
[38:10] it and you know um I was thinking about
[38:13] that as as I was looking at that reading
[38:15] that and I began to think how as we grow
[38:19] up we begin to express we begin to a
[38:22] little child watching my grandchildren
[38:23] grow up as they they learn words and
[38:25] they begin and it's it's really neat now
[38:27] to as they're old enough to say Look
[38:29] Papa look how this is and they explain
[38:32] it to me how it is this does this and
[38:35] this does that you know and and as pape
[38:38] I look at him I'm go man you're so right
[38:40] you're so good at this you know and it
[38:43] it's it's just something it's
[38:45] pleasing and um you so here he is he was
[38:50] God but there was nobody to worship
[38:53] him so creation begins and in his mind
[38:58] he begins to see began to to
[39:01] express and we don't know how long it
[39:03] took but it began to
[39:06] work from the
[39:08] smallest whatever that is to the
[39:12] greatest to the
[39:13] biggest remember brother Mike yarboro uh
[39:17] doing a a lesson here from the smallest
[39:19] thing that man has found to the greatest
[39:22] things God from the beginning God to the
[39:24] end it's amazing he says
[39:28] and and you know as as he's creating as
[39:30] he's bringing forth and and and things
[39:32] are happening he's he is he is enjoying
[39:35] his creation it is good and he rested it
[39:37] is good and he
[39:39] rested you know it didn't mean he went
[39:41] to sleep he was at peace about what
[39:43] happen you can sleep and not
[39:46] rest but when there's peace there's
[39:49] rest and he says you know and and he
[39:52] says but but he's uh he he from the
[39:56] smallest to the biggest all the way to
[39:58] Adam and Eve if I could say the crowning
[40:00] of that creation somebody to talk with
[40:03] somebody to walk with somebody to come
[40:04] in the cool of the evening you
[40:08] know but in him was to be a savior wow
[40:11] in him was to be a Healer a
[40:14] comforter uh someone who could who could
[40:16] be touched by the feeling of your
[40:17] infirmities that was just he he wanted
[40:19] that to know that to feel that and and
[40:22] he
[40:23] says so so he had to create someone that
[40:26] could fall
[40:30] with a purpose they were going to fall
[40:32] he put the tree of of of life and good
[40:35] and evil and there he allows these
[40:37] things and I was thinking that even
[40:39] today about the animals there they were
[40:42] at peace they got
[40:44] along you know when the lion came by it
[40:47] wasn't run and hide you went over and
[40:50] sat you know they sat down if I in their
[40:51] language and talked to each other roamed
[40:53] around with each
[40:54] other it was amazing you know
[40:58] but all this time God knew there was
[41:00] going to be a
[41:02] fall everything was prepared for
[41:06] that he says someone to Fellowship
[41:09] knowing that they would fall and become
[41:14] mortal that would be an end to their
[41:19] life and and it is there had to be a
[41:23] sacrifice of
[41:26] life uh you know for the payment of sin
[41:30] is
[41:31] death Paul tells us
[41:34] that and and he tells them the day that
[41:37] you eat of this tree you shall surely
[41:40] die and not only did it change with Adam
[41:43] and evea changed the whole
[41:45] garden the animals didn't get along
[41:48] anymore everything began to go in a
[41:50] different direction when the lion used
[41:53] to lay down by the lamb the lamb became
[41:55] afraid of the Lion
[41:58] it all change it all
[41:59] turn he and you
[42:04] know as we see that and I'm just going
[42:06] over quickly because we could be here
[42:08] forever for
[42:09] this but the animal ha Behavior changes
[42:14] the the the seasons change everything
[42:16] begins to
[42:18] change you know and it's it's kind of
[42:21] like your
[42:23] life I'm looking back now and I remember
[42:25] those that would tell me
[42:28] just wait till you get my
[42:29] age he'll start changing things will
[42:32] change things happen this body is not
[42:36] Eternal but I have a
[42:38] promise of eternal
[42:41] life it says and we know that that there
[42:44] because he is a savior because he's a
[42:46] Healer because all of this um it Adam
[42:50] and Eve they they they they go out of
[42:52] the garden and and it shows they took
[42:55] leaves and covered themselves they they
[42:56] were embarrassed they were
[42:59] ashamed but botney
[43:02] life was not the accepted
[43:05] sacrifice Cain tried it he offered the
[43:09] best that he had all of his fruits and
[43:11] all but Abel offered the life of a lamb
[43:17] and the shed blood of a
[43:20] lamb speaking of something again you've
[43:22] got to find see Christ in every part of
[43:25] the book amen he was going to give
[43:30] himself you know
[43:34] lifespan goes from being an eternal
[43:37] creature to almost a thousand
[43:40] years all the way down to 70 to8
[43:46] years and it didn't take long for that
[43:49] to happen when they broke God's
[43:53] word but it was all in God's plan he
[43:56] didn't have to go scrambling around say
[43:58] what am I going to do now what am I he's
[44:00] watching the Fulfillment of what is in
[44:02] his heart and is Desiring to
[44:05] do Isaiah 52:7 we we have a quite a few
[44:10] scriptures listen to this how beautiful
[44:13] upon the mountains are the feet of him
[44:14] that bringeth good tidings that
[44:17] publishes peace that bringeth good
[44:20] tidings or Good Tidings of good that
[44:23] publishes salvation that saith unto say
[44:28] thy God
[44:30] reth can you imagine being there at a
[44:33] place with no
[44:35] hope and something calls out and says
[44:37] your God is alive he hasn't changed he's
[44:40] the same yesterday today and
[44:43] forever and something inside of you says
[44:46] amen I'm longing for
[44:48] that he
[44:50] says Isaiah that was Isaiah 52:7 Isaiah
[44:55] 17 7
[44:58] 14 these are all all
[45:02] um familiar script as many were
[45:07] astonished it's kind of hard to read it
[45:08] on as many were astonished at thee his
[45:11] Visage was so marred more than any man
[45:14] and his form more than the sons of
[45:17] men Isaiah now begins to say look look
[45:21] what's going to happen to this
[45:23] one now Isaiah was prophesying because
[45:26] he's a prophet
[45:28] but he probably couldn't explain that to
[45:29] you he probably couldn't tell you but it
[45:31] was that that that inspiration is
[45:35] coming and then you get Isaiah
[45:39] 9:6 For unto us a child is born unto us
[45:43] a son is given and the government shall
[45:46] be upon his shoulder and his name Shall
[45:48] be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty
[45:52] God the Everlasting father the Prince of
[45:56] Peace
[45:58] again Isaiah probably couldn't tell you
[46:00] what that was
[46:01] about that inspiration is coming
[46:04] out and this is all out of the book of
[46:07] Isaiah Isaiah
[46:09] 53 1 and2
[46:12] describes what we're going to see in the
[46:15] future who hath believed our report and
[46:18] to whom is the arm of the Lord
[46:20] revealed for he shall grow up before him
[46:22] as a tender plant and as a root out of
[46:25] the of dry ground he ha no form nor
[46:28] cless and when we shall see him there is
[46:31] no beauty that we should desire him he
[46:35] is despised and rejected of men a Man of
[46:37] Sorrows and acquainted with
[46:40] grief he can be touched by the filling
[46:43] of our
[46:44] infirmities acquainted with
[46:46] grief and we hid as it were our faces
[46:49] from him he was despised and we esteemed
[46:52] him
[46:55] not surely Heath born our griefs and
[46:57] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[46:59] him a stricken smint of God inflicted we
[47:03] looked at him and said well what did he
[47:04] do he must have deserved
[47:08] this God wouldn't do that to anybody
[47:10] unless unless they needed
[47:14] that that's what Isaiah is saying here
[47:17] but he was wounded for our
[47:20] transgressions he was bruised for our
[47:22] iniquities the chastisement for our
[47:25] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[47:28] we are
[47:30] healed that hasn't changed it's still in
[47:33] full effect all we like sheep have gone
[47:36] astray we have turned everyone to his
[47:38] own way and the Lord hath laid upon him
[47:42] the iniquity of us
[47:44] all looking to that day at
[47:49] Calvary he was oppressed he was
[47:51] afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he
[47:54] is brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[47:56] and as a sheep sheep before his Shear is
[47:58] dumb so he openeth not his mouth he was
[48:01] taken from prison and from judgment and
[48:04] who shall declare his generation for he
[48:07] was cut off out of the land of the
[48:08] living for the transgression of my
[48:11] people was he stricken and he made his
[48:14] grave with the
[48:15] Wicked the King of Kings and the Lord of
[48:18] Lord is buried in a common grave
[48:23] wow look look what's happening in in
[48:25] England right now in London and all
[48:27] that's going on right now how what's
[48:30] going through with with with all the the
[48:32] the cancer and all that how it's spread
[48:34] out all over the whole world and
[48:35] everybody's looking at this yet the king
[48:38] of King and Lord of lords nobody
[48:45] knew and he he made his grave with the
[48:48] Wicked with the rich in his death
[48:50] because he had done no violence neither
[48:53] was there any deceit in his mouth
[48:58] yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he
[49:01] hath put him to grief when thou shalt
[49:04] make his soul an offering for sin he
[49:06] shall see his seed he shall prolong his
[49:09] days and and the pleasure of the Lord
[49:11] shall prosper in his hand he shall see
[49:14] the travail of his soul and he shall be
[49:17] satisfied by his knowledge shall my
[49:19] righteous servants justify many for he
[49:22] shall bear their
[49:24] iniquities wow Mine
[49:27] yes Lord you bear you bore my iniquities
[49:31] and you know what iniquity
[49:33] is doing that which you know you
[49:35] shouldn't do and not doing that that you
[49:37] know you should do he bore it therefore
[49:41] will I divide him a portion with the
[49:43] great and he shall divide the spoil with
[49:45] the strong because he ha poured out his
[49:48] soul unto death he was numbered with the
[49:52] transgressors and he bear the sin of
[49:54] many and made intercession for the
[49:59] transgressors this was in Isaiah this
[50:02] was before this was happening and he had
[50:05] to say not my will but thy will be
[50:13] done so through
[50:16] all the Old Testament is speaking of a
[50:20] coming deliverer a coming
[50:23] savior every part of it all these
[50:26] sacrific IES we've been hearing about
[50:28] through through all the books that we've
[50:29] gone through all the the names and this
[50:32] it all talking about
[50:33] one aiming back towards one amen the
[50:37] king of king and the Lord of lords amen
[50:40] the Prince of Peace The Great I Am it's
[50:43] all speaking of
[50:45] that
[50:48] so as as we go there and and and we
[50:52] see it comes up and and we're going to
[50:55] skip all all the way from the Old
[50:59] Testament and go right into the New
[51:00] Testament now because a day came when
[51:04] God said it is time to get this going
[51:07] and John describes it this way in John
[51:09] 3:15 to1
[51:12] 17 that whosoever believeth in him
[51:15] should not perish but have eternal life
[51:18] for God so loved the world there was
[51:22] only one way God could express his love
[51:28] wow there had to be some way to express
[51:31] it to somehow but you know it's easy uh
[51:35] uh and this by experience it easy it's
[51:37] easy to express love back to somebody
[51:39] that's loving you it's easy to give
[51:42] something back to somebody's given you
[51:44] it's so much easier well they're my
[51:46] friends so but God is doing this because
[51:50] he is going to go and save and redeem
[51:53] and bring those who really shouldn't
[51:56] even have had a
[51:57] chance I sinned I came short of the
[52:00] glory of God I was a
[52:02] transgressor and he said I'll take your
[52:05] place he says for God so led the world
[52:09] that he gave his only begotten son that
[52:11] whosoever believeth in him should not
[52:14] perish but have everlasting life for God
[52:17] sent not his son into the world to
[52:19] condemn the world but that the world
[52:22] through him might be
[52:25] saved
[52:27] and if we're not
[52:28] careful Lord the only way I can please
[52:31] you is if I do this for you and if I do
[52:33] this for you and if I do this for God
[52:36] sent his son for you that's so good
[52:40] that's right but you know why you do
[52:41] that back for him because you love them
[52:43] yes amen because you want to please them
[52:46] but when you when you begin to offer
[52:48] that as the works like C did I'll offer
[52:51] my beautiful works and therefore you
[52:53] have to receive me no he's already
[52:56] receed received you he's already
[52:58] accepted the blood for you that's
[53:00] already
[53:01] done you know and and
[53:04] it's it's it's like and and it's okay
[53:07] because some of you may do this as a
[53:09] husband and wife do you still love me do
[53:12] you still love me do you still love me
[53:14] and we get reassurance that way you know
[53:17] and you know and and you know sometimes
[53:19] you you you kind of get feeling
[53:22] maybe it's been now with Mama came home
[53:25] today from we have she's home now and my
[53:28] wife is over there with her and you know
[53:30] and and we're missing one another we
[53:32] have but I know my dad was so happy
[53:35] today cuz Mom was
[53:37] home you know and and until you go
[53:40] through the some of those things do you
[53:41] realize how much you need that other one
[53:44] one another and you were part of him am
[53:49] and he's longing and desire to get you
[53:51] back oh wow that's what it is and he
[53:54] said what is it going to take to draw
[53:56] you back what is it going to take to get
[53:57] you
[53:59] back and he says there's not a righteous
[54:02] one there there's not one that can save
[54:04] themselves so I'll do it I'll step down
[54:07] and do
[54:09] it looking starting in Matthew and and
[54:13] Matthew Mark Luke and John is there's a
[54:15] lot of the the stories are just repeated
[54:18] at with a different view with a
[54:20] different you know but it they all saw
[54:23] that same thing they all heard the same
[54:25] thing they all witnessed
[54:27] they saw the fishes and the loaves they
[54:29] you know but each one had had a
[54:31] different view a different
[54:33] way so starting in
[54:37] Matthew chapter 1 looking at at some
[54:41] just kind of going through there we'll
[54:42] read some scriptures some of it we'll
[54:44] we'll just kind of God work now working
[54:47] to F fulfill the Old Testament
[54:50] Prophecies of the coming Redeemer the
[54:53] acceptable perfect Lamb of God
[54:57] the one that job cried out to I know my
[55:00] redeemer liveth and with these eyes I
[55:03] Shall Behold
[55:04] Him that one as you look through the Old
[55:07] Testament you start going down the line
[55:09] that cry that desire that that one
[55:12] brother brandham talking there and and
[55:14] you know with Adam with uh Abraham and
[55:16] Sarah and he's the knock at the door
[55:19] there and Jesus you know after his death
[55:21] and all and they're there and she said
[55:23] this is that one this is that one
[55:25] they've been looking for that and here
[55:28] he
[55:30] is 12 years old in the
[55:33] temple hearing because the Bible says he
[55:37] was
[55:38] listening hearing and asking
[55:42] questions you know and Mary tells them
[55:45] that they had been looking for him your
[55:47] father and
[55:48] I and he's anwers with I must be about
[55:51] my father's
[55:53] business I I I thought this interesting
[55:56] listen let's take that
[55:57] Matthew 1 19-23 the scripture
[56:05] there then Joseph her husband remember
[56:07] Mary had said be it unto me according to
[56:10] Thy word when the angel came and told
[56:14] her but Joseph her husband being a just
[56:17] man and not willing to make her a public
[56:19] example was minded to put her away
[56:21] privately he says but while he thought
[56:24] of these things behold the the angel of
[56:26] the Lord appeared unto him in a dream
[56:28] saying Joseph thou son of David fear not
[56:32] to take unto thee marry thy wife for
[56:35] that which is conceived in her is of the
[56:37] Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a
[56:40] son and thou shalt call his name Jesus
[56:43] for he shall save his people from their
[56:46] sins Mary says be it unto me according
[56:49] to Thy word and Joseph's
[56:53] going how am I going to work with this
[56:55] how am I going to deal with this
[56:56] nobody's going to believe
[56:57] it they're going to say something
[57:00] happened that shouldn't have happened
[57:02] but at God rich in
[57:04] Mercy reaches down to Joseph and says
[57:07] take her I'm doing this I'm working this
[57:11] that same God that is rich in Mercy
[57:13] today would speak to you and say go
[57:15] ahead it's all right I'm in
[57:17] this you might be looking at your own
[57:19] life you might be looking what you've
[57:21] done and saying I'm not worthy but he
[57:22] said it's okay I've taken care of it
[57:25] it's taken care of
[57:28] you know
[57:30] it's the next so many chapters is him
[57:33] growing up Jesus Jesus
[57:37] learning um learning to say yes sir yes
[57:42] ma'am learning to be friendly learning
[57:45] how to live as a human would live how we
[57:47] should be
[57:49] living he didn't walk around and tell
[57:51] Mary you know what what the angel told
[57:53] you so you can't talk to me like that
[57:56] he subjected
[57:58] himself he
[58:00] learned if he was helping uh you know
[58:03] Joseph in and he banged his finger as a
[58:07] carpenter and Joseph said my goodness it
[58:09] doesn't even hurt him no he went like
[58:12] this
[58:13] too that's the only way he could be
[58:15] touched by the feeling of our
[58:17] infirmities to know what you're going
[58:19] through to understand
[58:22] that so so we know he's he's he's
[58:25] growing up he's he's he's
[58:27] going but things are happening that Mary
[58:30] and Joseph and and those that around him
[58:32] are
[58:33] seeing he is
[58:36] different you know he comes up and he
[58:39] says yes sir yes
[58:41] ma'am he comes he gets up and makes well
[58:44] I think he did he makes his bed in the
[58:47] morning you know he he does his chores
[58:50] you
[58:52] know and probably maybe upset his
[58:54] brother sometimes I don't know I I it's
[58:57] hard to imagine him not being that
[58:59] way you know I I don't to me he didn't
[59:02] talk back but but he he lived through
[59:05] that life you understand what I'm saying
[59:09] um and he comes up and and you know they
[59:12] they come to the time where where
[59:13] they're at that wedding and then they
[59:15] run out of wine and obviously they'd
[59:18] seen enough things and they knew enough
[59:19] things that happened they they go and
[59:21] they said Mary can you talk to Jesus
[59:23] about this
[59:25] situation
[59:26] how would they know if something hadn't
[59:28] happened
[59:30] before he was God in
[59:33] flesh and and these things are happening
[59:35] you're learning and you
[59:37] know as a Christian let me just say
[59:40] Christ in you things should be happening
[59:43] in your life that others are seeing amen
[59:46] and they can draw and they can
[59:48] receive and they can come up to you and
[59:50] say can you help me can you pray for me
[59:54] amen because you're expressing the the
[59:56] same
[1:00:00] God so now as we get up we see his life
[1:00:05] and he goes through and he calls his
[1:00:06] disciples as he's walking and it's
[1:00:09] amazing how he calls his disciples
[1:00:11] because he had he made sure they had
[1:00:13] gone to college they were properly
[1:00:14] trained they knew the right
[1:00:17] language no no he didn't do it that way
[1:00:22] huh a little experience when we were in
[1:00:25] the Pentecostal Church church just young
[1:00:28] people and and where we had come through
[1:00:31] in the Spanish side there
[1:00:33] was got to know some of the old the old
[1:00:36] Old Faithful
[1:00:38] ministers they had uh testimonies about
[1:00:42] them praying and Angels coming around
[1:00:44] them and these things that that we heard
[1:00:47] about we knew about raised with
[1:00:49] listening God was he was still the same
[1:00:51] yesterday Miracles and lives and all but
[1:00:55] as we got a little older and they began
[1:00:58] to to to send the the the ministers to
[1:01:01] the uh to school to be taught how to
[1:01:05] speak right how to do this right and I'm
[1:01:07] not against that it's a lot easier to
[1:01:09] listen to somebody that knows how to
[1:01:10] speak than somebody that doesn't I
[1:01:13] understand that but you began to see
[1:01:15] that it was no longer following a
[1:01:18] leadership of God or calling your life
[1:01:20] but rather how you were taught and
[1:01:21] trained
[1:01:23] wow but somebody that has met God for
[1:01:27] themselves and know he's real wow and he
[1:01:31] comes and talks to you and and or her
[1:01:33] whoever it
[1:01:34] is it's it's it's a daughter a son and
[1:01:37] daughter of
[1:01:40] God so here he is he's calling his
[1:01:44] disciples they're they're they're
[1:01:46] following him H uh you can read this
[1:01:49] through all four gospels or he goes many
[1:01:52] places and he heals the sick and and
[1:01:54] know we we know he feeds them feeds the
[1:01:56] the the whole crowd and there just so
[1:01:58] many things that he does but there is
[1:02:00] one goal and one aim that he's going
[1:02:04] to and that is to give his
[1:02:07] life so that you and I could be brought
[1:02:14] back I I imagine that yourself you know
[1:02:18] you're here on
[1:02:20] Earth and I'll Daniel I'll use you
[1:02:23] because you're up
[1:02:24] front
[1:02:26] imagine if if if it was you and they
[1:02:29] said
[1:02:30] Daniel when you become 25 years old
[1:02:34] you're going to have to give your life
[1:02:35] for
[1:02:37] this you could go out and do a lot of
[1:02:39] things but you'll never get that out of
[1:02:42] your mind this
[1:02:44] is he was called for
[1:02:48] something he was brought on this Earth
[1:02:50] for a reason and in all time is looking
[1:02:53] towards
[1:02:54] that
[1:02:56] He Could Be Touched By The Filling of
[1:02:58] our
[1:02:59] infirmities he went through many of
[1:03:01] cities and he said and he healed all the
[1:03:05] sick he reached out and he touched them
[1:03:07] he because that was God in
[1:03:11] flesh but there was still something that
[1:03:13] had to
[1:03:14] come and that was Redemption to bring us
[1:03:19] back so we get to something that I
[1:03:22] noticed um in all Matthew Mark Luke and
[1:03:25] John and we'll read it out of Matthew 20
[1:03:28] 17 and
[1:03:31] 19 I think 17- 19 that
[1:03:34] is and Jesus going up to Jerusalem took
[1:03:37] the 12 disciples apart in the way and
[1:03:39] said unto them behold we go to Jerusalem
[1:03:43] and the son of man shall be betrayed
[1:03:45] unto the chief priest and unto the
[1:03:47] scribes and they shall condemn him to
[1:03:49] death and shall deliver him to the
[1:03:52] Gentiles to Mock and to Scourge and to
[1:03:55] crucify him
[1:03:56] and the third day he shall rise again
[1:04:01] wow if they hadn't put that part that
[1:04:04] last line in there and then what they're
[1:04:07] going to do all of this and then what
[1:04:09] but he shall rise again so he tells them
[1:04:13] and if you go through and you read
[1:04:14] through that oh don't let this happen to
[1:04:16] you Lord don't let this oh no no that
[1:04:19] can't go they couldn't imagine being
[1:04:21] without
[1:04:23] him he took care of everything
[1:04:27] we owe some taxes well go down to the
[1:04:30] river there catch that fish he'll have
[1:04:31] the coin in his mouth go give it to
[1:04:34] him could you imagine
[1:04:37] that Lord I'm I'm running out of gas
[1:04:39] okay just you know go over here you know
[1:04:41] here he still takes care but this is
[1:04:44] what they lived with they were on a
[1:04:47] storm they were out in the boat in the
[1:04:50] storm and and and it it it starts
[1:04:52] rocking and they think they're going to
[1:04:54] die save us master here and he stands up
[1:04:56] on the bow and he says peace be still
[1:04:59] and the winds and the Seas obey
[1:05:02] him you know it still he still does that
[1:05:06] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:05:09] forever it's just imagine them seeing
[1:05:12] all this for about three years three and
[1:05:14] a half years it was watching him go and
[1:05:18] everything he
[1:05:19] touches and always wondering why don't
[1:05:21] the people accept him why don't they
[1:05:23] believe him look what he's done for us
[1:05:26] but when God comes a little different
[1:05:28] than what you think he should or how you
[1:05:31] have it planned out or how you figured
[1:05:33] it then you stop and say that can't be
[1:05:37] God but Lord just allow me to be
[1:05:40] sensitive and a humble Spirit to know
[1:05:43] it's you and let you
[1:05:46] direct so he says they're going to and
[1:05:49] and then we know now let me just tell
[1:05:51] you something here there was a a a
[1:05:53] really nice brother who we got to
[1:05:56] talking and I told him I don't know if I
[1:05:58] can do this and explain and he says I've
[1:06:00] got this
[1:06:02] this uh that I did a study on this week
[1:06:05] of Easter and he says I I'll send it to
[1:06:07] you thanks brother
[1:06:09] Dan I was looking at it he goes let me
[1:06:12] show you and and he did it for me or he
[1:06:15] let me use
[1:06:16] it um and so it's it it so I'm using a
[1:06:21] lot of the work that he did just cuz it
[1:06:25] was a a whole lot easier than trying to
[1:06:26] do it
[1:06:28] myself I
[1:06:31] I I I I really appreciate brother L and
[1:06:35] brother Dan in this this uh time of of
[1:06:37] the studying of the the books because my
[1:06:41] studying goes from here to there to here
[1:06:42] to here and there and theirs can go down
[1:06:44] the line and and that's how when you're
[1:06:47] going to do that is it's so much easier
[1:06:50] um but here here it is there there he
[1:06:53] just told them what's going to happen
[1:06:55] but let's go to
[1:06:58] Jerusalem okay Sunday there there are
[1:07:02] some
[1:07:03] unknowns like when when was the trial
[1:07:06] when did the scourging was it Thursday
[1:07:08] night or Friday morning and and which
[1:07:11] day did Mary wash his feet and and
[1:07:13] that's not really the most important
[1:07:15] thing but that it
[1:07:17] happened you know and and I
[1:07:20] sometimes how if you'll hear us my mom
[1:07:24] and dad and now me and my wife
[1:07:26] it was this no it wasn't it was that no
[1:07:29] it was this and and we spend more time
[1:07:30] arguing about who was right about when
[1:07:32] and what it was and that's not really
[1:07:34] the point it did happen that's so
[1:07:38] sometimes we can get caught up in all
[1:07:39] was it this John said it this way
[1:07:41] Matthew said it this way mark it was
[1:07:43] their perspective it's how they saw it
[1:07:45] you know
[1:07:48] so Mark
[1:07:51] 11 verses
[1:07:54] 1-10 and
[1:07:58] and when they came n to Jerusalem unto
[1:08:00] the Beth Beth and Bethany at the Mount
[1:08:03] of Olives he sendeth forth two of his
[1:08:04] disciples and saith unto them go your
[1:08:07] way into the village over against you
[1:08:09] and as soon as you be entered into it
[1:08:12] you shall find a cult tide where never a
[1:08:14] man sat loose him and bring him and if
[1:08:17] any man say unto you why you why do you
[1:08:20] this say ye that the Lord hath need of
[1:08:23] him and straightway he will send them
[1:08:26] hither has anybody ever tried that I
[1:08:30] need to borrow your card the Lord has
[1:08:31] need of
[1:08:35] it yeah that's interesting read that and
[1:08:38] lot time don't worry about it he knows
[1:08:41] he's expecting it it's going to
[1:08:43] happen you know that was the mode of
[1:08:46] transportation then you know if it would
[1:08:48] have been today he says brother Daniel
[1:08:51] just got a new truck go ask him if the
[1:08:54] the Lord can use it
[1:09:00] it's a little bit different today but
[1:09:02] that was a mode of transportation but
[1:09:03] that was fulfilling scripture yeah wow
[1:09:06] and God is going to make sure that every
[1:09:08] point of it is fulfilled in your life
[1:09:12] too and they went their way and imagined
[1:09:15] this and found the cult by the door
[1:09:17] without a place without in a place where
[1:09:20] the two ways met and they loose him and
[1:09:23] a certain of them that stood there said
[1:09:25] unto them what what do you loosing the
[1:09:27] cult and they said unto them even as
[1:09:30] Jesus had recommended and they let them
[1:09:33] go he never fails he never misses it he
[1:09:37] doesn't guess at it it's perfect every
[1:09:40] time sometimes he lets you learn
[1:09:43] that and ex what is it by
[1:09:47] experience you know learning it now it's
[1:09:50] it's something you can hold on to it's
[1:09:52] something you can believe for yourself
[1:09:55] not because the minister not because the
[1:09:57] prophet not because Mom or Daddy but
[1:09:59] because you met God and he answered it
[1:10:01] for you then it's
[1:10:05] real and they brought the cold to Jesus
[1:10:07] and cast their garments on him and he
[1:10:09] sat upon him and many spread their
[1:10:12] garments in the way and others cut down
[1:10:14] branches of the off the trees and straw
[1:10:17] them on the
[1:10:19] way and they that went before and they
[1:10:22] that followed cried saying hosana bless
[1:10:25] blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[1:10:27] the Lord blessed be the kingdom of Our
[1:10:29] Father David that cometh in the name of
[1:10:31] the Lord hosana in the
[1:10:34] highest and on the tomorrow when they
[1:10:37] were come from Bethany he was
[1:10:41] hungry he just has this triumphal entry
[1:10:44] he just has this wonderful time and he's
[1:10:48] hungry see that's how he can be a God
[1:10:51] that understands you
[1:10:53] yes that's how he can be touching by the
[1:10:55] feeling of what you have need of he was
[1:10:59] hungry and seeing a fig tree a far off
[1:11:02] having leaves he came if happily he
[1:11:04] might find anything thereon and when he
[1:11:07] came to it he found nothing but leaves
[1:11:09] for the time of the figs was not
[1:11:11] yet I I I still stopped there and I go
[1:11:16] but but Lord it it wasn't the season for
[1:11:20] figs I play this in my mind why did you
[1:11:24] have to do that it wasn't the Fig tree's
[1:11:26] fault it wasn't that time
[1:11:29] yet and Jesus answered and said unto it
[1:11:32] no man eat fruit of thee Hereafter
[1:11:36] forever and the disciples heard
[1:11:40] it and and you're going
[1:11:45] okay and they came to Jerusalem and
[1:11:48] Jesus went into the temple and began to
[1:11:50] cast out them that sold and bought in
[1:11:52] the temple and overthrew the tables of
[1:11:54] the money chain ERS and the seats of
[1:11:57] them that sold doves and would not
[1:11:59] suffer that any man should carry any
[1:12:02] vessel through the temple and he taught
[1:12:04] saying unto him it is not is it not
[1:12:06] written that my house shall be called of
[1:12:09] all Nations the house of prayer and you
[1:12:12] have made it a den of
[1:12:15] Thieves and it hasn't changed and the
[1:12:18] scribes and the chief priests heard it
[1:12:20] and sought how they might destroy him
[1:12:23] for they feared him because all the
[1:12:25] people was astonished at his Doctrine
[1:12:28] and when even and when even was come he
[1:12:30] went out of this city it's
[1:12:33] amazing over the years as you you we've
[1:12:37] been you know I've been a Christian my
[1:12:39] whole life raised that way but when we
[1:12:41] heard this message it's been almost 50
[1:12:43] years ago
[1:12:44] now and the separation and the
[1:12:48] the how do I want to say it you don't
[1:12:51] see it my
[1:12:52] way I don't want nothing to you here
[1:12:55] wrong
[1:12:57] wow we were we were we were I was at the
[1:13:00] swap meet one day a long time ago done
[1:13:03] the swap meet in years but um it was a
[1:13:07] brother that had stopped going to church
[1:13:09] and and and he saw me come over and talk
[1:13:10] to me and we got to talk and he said you
[1:13:12] still going to church there the Spanish
[1:13:15] Church said yeah we still attend there
[1:13:16] and all I said haven't seen you he says
[1:13:18] oh yeah he said I you know the church is
[1:13:21] a lodge and that's what just people look
[1:13:22] like and start telling so telling me how
[1:13:24] they they a church I said so what do you
[1:13:27] do he said well I'm the pastor of the
[1:13:28] group that meets at my
[1:13:31] house I said what's the difference
[1:13:33] between that the church and your
[1:13:36] house he just wanted to be a pastor of a
[1:13:38] group of people and you
[1:13:40] just but look at these things they they
[1:13:43] they were astonished they they they they
[1:13:45] wanted to destroy him because he was
[1:13:46] coming and he broke up and said this is
[1:13:49] a House of Prayer wow not a place for a
[1:13:52] denes and and we think of denes we know
[1:13:55] were selling they were doing this but if
[1:13:57] I would get up here and preach to you a
[1:13:59] false Doctrine and give you a false hope
[1:14:01] I'm a thief I'm stealing the peace and
[1:14:04] the joy of God from
[1:14:06] you and this is what he was talking
[1:14:08] about he said where God is there is
[1:14:12] peace even though he might correct you
[1:14:15] even though he might tell you this is
[1:14:16] wrong he's doing it for your good with a
[1:14:18] good intention with the right
[1:14:20] ending and that's that's just looking at
[1:14:23] some of these things here
[1:14:28] trying not to get ahead of myself here
[1:14:30] too
[1:14:31] much
[1:14:37] so that was Palm
[1:14:40] Sunday Monday he cursed the the fig tree
[1:14:43] walked into the temple we were just
[1:14:45] reading all this that happened
[1:14:48] there now on Tuesday and this is based
[1:14:52] on approximate When when is we don't
[1:14:55] know the exact days and and and but it
[1:14:59] was around that in that week the
[1:15:00] disciples noticed at the fig tree that
[1:15:02] Jesus had just cursed was
[1:15:07] withered um I don't know why this is so
[1:15:11] astonishing to them I would think they
[1:15:13] had seen quite a bit
[1:15:16] already but God can visit you now and a
[1:15:19] little while later and it's still
[1:15:21] amazing it's still wonderful it's still
[1:15:24] good
[1:15:26] you know I I pray that I would never get
[1:15:28] to a place in my life that I said okay
[1:15:30] Lord that's good enough I've had
[1:15:32] enough but a fresh touch every
[1:15:37] day they uh they notice that that it was
[1:15:42] cursed and it had to stay with them
[1:15:45] these were lessons they were learning
[1:15:47] along the
[1:15:49] way you know it's it's it's it's those
[1:15:52] things that we learn along the way some
[1:15:54] of us learn Le quicker than others some
[1:15:57] of us have to go find out if it's
[1:16:01] true if you hit your finger with a
[1:16:03] hammer does it really hurt they have to
[1:16:05] go find out they can't take your word
[1:16:07] for
[1:16:08] it but but here he is he's showing them
[1:16:11] I'm I I'm a I can speak to the creation
[1:16:14] I can create I can also take its life I
[1:16:17] can tell you go down to the fish and
[1:16:19] take out the money I can say peace be
[1:16:21] still in the
[1:16:23] storm but I also Can Be Touched by the
[1:16:25] fing of your infirmities I can be tired
[1:16:28] I need to lay down and rest
[1:16:31] too all sides of
[1:16:37] it and and then of course you know it's
[1:16:40] it's it's as he goes into the temple
[1:16:43] often and and he's he's talking with
[1:16:45] them and he's he's he's he's he's
[1:16:48] discussing the scripture and what Isaiah
[1:16:50] said and what this is and you know and
[1:16:53] it
[1:16:53] is
[1:16:55] if we're not careful sometimes well I
[1:16:57] know that already I'm learned I mean
[1:16:58] what can you teach me always say Lord
[1:17:01] I'm willing to hear more I'm willing to
[1:17:03] receive more I uh run into different
[1:17:07] people over time and and some of them uh
[1:17:11] there just wonderful people around the
[1:17:12] other ones if they don't show any
[1:17:13] attention they don't want to be that
[1:17:15] that's okay that's all
[1:17:18] right you know when when he's when he's
[1:17:20] speaking here he's uh he's talking about
[1:17:24] faith and and forgiveness and he's he's
[1:17:27] he's going through things in
[1:17:29] life about forgiving one another about
[1:17:32] caring for one another about loving one
[1:17:35] another how to treat one another you
[1:17:37] know there all these questions that
[1:17:39] they're asking him and and and you know
[1:17:41] they going to the scriptures and say
[1:17:43] this and you know he's looking past all
[1:17:46] of that and he's getting down into the
[1:17:47] heart and he's talking about getting
[1:17:50] these things right first getting this
[1:17:52] things right first we know that that
[1:17:54] that Young Rich ruler that comes up to
[1:17:56] him and talks with him and and he tells
[1:17:58] them well he said what must I do to to
[1:18:00] inherit eternal life you know uh and
[1:18:04] it's kind of what we got Lord what do I
[1:18:06] still have to do to inherit eternal life
[1:18:09] eternal life is
[1:18:11] yours you don't earn it you don't work
[1:18:14] for it God gave it to
[1:18:17] you but what you do is you love him for
[1:18:20] what he's done for you and you want to
[1:18:22] share with others and and you know he
[1:18:24] talks about he shows all of this through
[1:18:26] the scriptures so that you and I could
[1:18:29] understand
[1:18:34] this Mark 11 let's look at it Mark
[1:18:38] 1112 to 33 I believe it is
[1:18:44] here and on the marrow when they were
[1:18:46] come to Bethany he was hungry and seen a
[1:18:48] fig tree a far
[1:18:50] off having leaves he came as happily he
[1:18:53] might find anything there on and when he
[1:18:55] came to it he found nothing but leaves
[1:18:57] for the time of the FI was not and Jesus
[1:19:00] answered and said no man sh shall eat
[1:19:02] fruit of thee Hereafter and Ever After
[1:19:05] and his disciples heard
[1:19:08] it and they came to Jerusalem and Jesus
[1:19:11] went into the temple and began to cast
[1:19:13] out them that bought that bought and
[1:19:16] sold sold and bought at the temple and
[1:19:18] overthrew the tables of the money
[1:19:20] changers and the seed of them that sold
[1:19:22] doves and would not suffer that any man
[1:19:25] should carry in a vessel through the
[1:19:26] temple and he taught say him is it not
[1:19:29] written my house shall be be called of
[1:19:32] All Nation a House of Prayer you have
[1:19:35] made it a den of
[1:19:37] Thieves you and the scribes and the
[1:19:39] chief priests heard it and they sought
[1:19:41] how they might destroy him for they
[1:19:43] feared him because of all the people
[1:19:45] astonished at his Doctrine and when the
[1:19:47] even was come he went out of the
[1:19:51] city okay so so this just the the
[1:19:54] scripture
[1:19:56] um and then we get
[1:20:00] into as he was going through there we
[1:20:03] that was through 33 or maybe I gave you
[1:20:05] the wrong the mark
[1:20:07] 11:12 to 33 right
[1:20:11] okay and the Scribe and the chief priest
[1:20:13] heard in they s okay we have that all
[1:20:16] the way through
[1:20:17] 33
[1:20:20] sorry that's what I wrote on my notes
[1:20:22] but maybe that's not what I uh
[1:20:25] and in the morning as they passed they
[1:20:26] saw the Fig Tree had dried up from the
[1:20:28] roots and Peter calling to remember and
[1:20:30] said unto him Master behold the Fig Tree
[1:20:32] which thou cursed is withered away and
[1:20:35] this is where I went and Jesus answered
[1:20:37] say unto him have faith in
[1:20:41] God for verily I say unto you that
[1:20:43] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[1:20:45] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[1:20:48] the sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[1:20:51] but shall believe that those things
[1:20:53] which he saith shall come to pass he
[1:20:56] shall have whatsoever he
[1:20:59] saith he's talking to me and
[1:21:02] you if you can
[1:21:04] believe you know and and sometimes where
[1:21:07] where it gets hard for us to believe is
[1:21:08] we begin to look at
[1:21:10] ourselves and we begin to say am I
[1:21:12] worthy I failed here I did this wrong
[1:21:15] today I I was doing a homeowner
[1:21:17] appointment it was going to be the last
[1:21:18] one of the day and I had talked to my
[1:21:20] boss and said I'd like to get done as
[1:21:21] soon as possible to prepare for tonight
[1:21:25] and I had driven off the job it was on
[1:21:28] lcho and Lambert I had got on Tangerine
[1:21:30] I was headed into that was almost down
[1:21:32] to where the trial plant is right there
[1:21:34] and I get a phone call from my boss and
[1:21:36] he says um what did you just do with
[1:21:39] this last job and I said fix it well
[1:21:41] they're com they're complaining they're
[1:21:43] they're upset because it's
[1:21:45] wrong I go it's funny when I left
[1:21:47] everything was right and they were happy
[1:21:49] so he said get back there right out
[1:21:51] they've already called the the office of
[1:21:53] that Builder and the they're upset so I
[1:21:57] drive back there and and you know I'm
[1:21:58] thinking thank you Lord no I
[1:22:02] wasn't I was saying now okay what did I
[1:22:05] do I'm you know I'm going through all
[1:22:06] this stuff through my head what could
[1:22:07] happen you know they were so nice to me
[1:22:10] now they're mad you know and I'm just
[1:22:11] going down this line so I pull up and I
[1:22:13] was replacing a couple doors that were
[1:22:15] defective on their cabinets and I done
[1:22:17] it everything was fine when I get out
[1:22:19] there the 42-in tall door is half open
[1:22:22] and won't close but when I left we
[1:22:25] clothes are fine and he said
[1:22:27] good and I'm looking at it I'm going how
[1:22:30] did this happen his kids are about this
[1:22:32] big and they Wen up on the ladder I had
[1:22:34] the ladder with me and all but somehow
[1:22:37] one of the hinge just decided to break
[1:22:39] right about that time when I
[1:22:42] left it was a lesson for
[1:22:45] me go back and take care of the work
[1:22:47] it's
[1:22:48] okay we got it fixed he came back the
[1:22:51] hard part was he had called the customer
[1:22:53] service girl and and she called my boss
[1:22:56] and by the time the story got back to me
[1:22:58] the house was falling
[1:23:00] down yeah but replace the hinges they
[1:23:03] were happy and everything was fine and
[1:23:06] and these are things I believe Jesus was
[1:23:08] just talking to his disciples
[1:23:11] about if you say to this mountain be
[1:23:14] thou removed whatever that mountain is
[1:23:18] some mountains are this
[1:23:19] big and some mountains are bigger than
[1:23:21] the ceiling but if you say to this
[1:23:24] mountain wow whatever that situation
[1:23:28] is therefore I say unto you whatsoever
[1:23:31] things you desire When you pray believe
[1:23:33] that you receive them and you shall have
[1:23:36] them and when you stand praying
[1:23:42] forgive why would he say that when you
[1:23:44] stand praying
[1:23:46] forgive he said if you have ought
[1:23:49] against any that your father also which
[1:23:52] is in heaven May forgive your
[1:23:55] trespasses the greatest evidence of you
[1:23:59] being and knowing you're forgiv by him
[1:24:01] is your attitude back to
[1:24:03] others can I forgive you know when I got
[1:24:06] back to the Mana yeah I was I wasn't all
[1:24:07] that happy about it I'm imagining all
[1:24:10] these things when I got there he's
[1:24:12] friendly and
[1:24:13] nice this like the third time I'd been
[1:24:15] in this house and we' had been fixing
[1:24:16] some odds and ends over the last few
[1:24:18] months and he was a really nice guy he's
[1:24:21] a fireman was off that day and and just
[1:24:23] really nice gentleman
[1:24:25] and and we fixed it and he was happy he
[1:24:28] was smiling you know he didn't throw me
[1:24:31] out of the
[1:24:32] house had that happen before but you
[1:24:35] know and and he says if you forgive you
[1:24:38] will be
[1:24:39] forgiven if my attitude going back to
[1:24:42] that house would have been a little less
[1:24:45] upset it wouldn't have been that long of
[1:24:47] a
[1:24:48] journey even though it was the same
[1:24:51] length whether my attitude was good or
[1:24:53] bad but how was my attitude and that
[1:24:56] sometimes affects that trip that time he
[1:24:59] says but if you do not forgive neither
[1:25:02] will your father which is in heaven
[1:25:03] forgive your
[1:25:05] trespasses and they come again to
[1:25:07] Jerusalem as he was walking in the
[1:25:08] temple and there come to in the chief
[1:25:11] priests and scribes and the
[1:25:13] elders and they say unto him by what
[1:25:15] Authority Dost thou these things and who
[1:25:17] gave thee this authority to do these
[1:25:21] things you know they still question you
[1:25:25] the same question by what Authority do
[1:25:27] you do this how can how can you stand
[1:25:30] and say he's Jesus Christ the same in
[1:25:32] yesterday and forever how can you stand
[1:25:35] up and say he's a Healer by what
[1:25:37] Authority by God's word and because he's
[1:25:40] been faithful to do
[1:25:42] it he says and Jesus answered and said
[1:25:45] unto them I will also ask you one
[1:25:48] question and answer me and I will tell
[1:25:49] you by what Authority I do these things
[1:25:52] the baptism of John was it from heaven
[1:25:54] or of men answer
[1:25:57] me and they looked at one another and
[1:26:00] said okay let's be careful how we answer
[1:26:03] this and they reason within themselves
[1:26:06] saying if we say from Heaven he will say
[1:26:09] why then did you not believe
[1:26:11] him but if we say of men they feared the
[1:26:15] people for all men connect
[1:26:19] um Can what's that word there because
[1:26:22] this is counted okay this is cut off
[1:26:25] there John that he was a prophet indeed
[1:26:29] and they answered and said unto Jesus we
[1:26:31] cannot tell and Jesus said unto him
[1:26:34] neither do I tell thee by what Authority
[1:26:35] I do these
[1:26:37] things in other words anyone embarrass
[1:26:40] themselves they didn't want to stand up
[1:26:43] and say you're right we're
[1:26:45] wrong and in my attitude I asked the
[1:26:48] Lord my attitude don't ever let me get
[1:26:49] that way I'm right and everybody else is
[1:26:53] wrong it's like the uh lady was driving
[1:26:56] down the road and her husband called her
[1:26:57] up and said honey be care okay I'm going
[1:27:00] to flip it around it's like the man some
[1:27:02] of the sisters are looking at me funny
[1:27:04] there's a man driving down the road and
[1:27:06] his wife calls him up and says honey be
[1:27:09] careful there's there's somebody driving
[1:27:11] down the road the wrong way and the man
[1:27:14] said ah honey there's a lot of people
[1:27:16] driving down the wrong
[1:27:19] way watch our attitude sometimes watch
[1:27:21] our attitude thank you okay I I'll be
[1:27:24] okay when I get
[1:27:26] home by neither do I tell you by what
[1:27:29] Authority do I do they shouldn't have
[1:27:31] even question here he is doing the works
[1:27:33] of God why are they questioning
[1:27:36] him
[1:27:39] now we look into here
[1:27:42] U on Wednesday Jesus was at the house of
[1:27:45] Simon a rich man Mary anoints him with
[1:27:51] oil you know that's one of the most to
[1:27:56] me it's it's one of the most amazing
[1:27:58] things here's God in
[1:28:02] flesh and a woman of ill
[1:28:07] Fame and it happens quite often with him
[1:28:11] because he's teaching us a lesson the
[1:28:14] scriptures are there for us to learn
[1:28:16] from to receive from it's not just a
[1:28:19] book to entertain us but for us
[1:28:21] to a a woman of ill Fame
[1:28:24] and and you know we know what what that
[1:28:27] was
[1:28:28] about and and and she comes and he she
[1:28:31] washes his feet with the tears of her
[1:28:37] eyes have you ever been so happy so
[1:28:40] grateful so or so broken in his presence
[1:28:43] that you just can't stop but
[1:28:47] cry I I was in praying here one day I
[1:28:50] was talking to brother Daniel about this
[1:28:51] one day praying here in one of the
[1:28:53] prayer meetings
[1:28:54] and and I asked the Lord I just asked
[1:28:56] him I saidd do you understand the
[1:28:58] feeling of being uh
[1:29:02] uh
[1:29:05] forsaken I just said you know and I I
[1:29:07] just cried out I said Lord and he just
[1:29:10] cried up back to did not I cry out my
[1:29:13] God my God why has Thou forsaken
[1:29:18] me he saw these people that felt that
[1:29:21] God had forsaken
[1:29:23] them and he knew what that feeling
[1:29:26] was and he could be touched by the
[1:29:28] feeling of that infirmity he let them
[1:29:31] come also to show here are these men who
[1:29:34] prided themselves in their religion and
[1:29:36] their dress and their acts and all and
[1:29:38] they couldn't humble themselves before
[1:29:43] God I I what would the people think of
[1:29:46] me wh what would they say wow you have
[1:29:51] to go and say I'm sorry
[1:29:53] yes you have to go before God and say I
[1:29:55] failed you
[1:29:57] yes but here he is showing even a person
[1:30:01] at that estate that would come and bow
[1:30:03] themselves before me can be
[1:30:05] forgiven can be cleansed whose names can
[1:30:08] be mentioned in the
[1:30:15] scriptures Mark chapter
[1:30:18] 14 1- 10 I don't want to be here too
[1:30:21] much
[1:30:23] longer
[1:30:27] so after two days was the Feast of the
[1:30:29] Passover and of unle bread and the chief
[1:30:32] priests and the scribes s how they might
[1:30:34] take him by Craft to put him to
[1:30:37] death but they said not on the feast day
[1:30:40] lest there be an uproar of the
[1:30:42] people and being in Bethany in the house
[1:30:44] of Simon the leper as he said to me
[1:30:46] there came a woman leaving an alaster
[1:30:48] box of ointment of Spike Narda very
[1:30:51] precious and she break the box and P
[1:30:54] reported on his
[1:30:56] head and there were some of them that
[1:30:58] had indignation with themselves and said
[1:31:01] why was this waste of the ointment
[1:31:06] made to to imagine that here the king of
[1:31:09] kings and Lord of Lord someone is coming
[1:31:12] and sharing their heart and somebody's
[1:31:14] looking at it like this going what a
[1:31:16] waste of
[1:31:19] money for it might have been sold for
[1:31:21] more than 300 p and been given to the
[1:31:25] poor and they murmured against her and
[1:31:29] and Jesus said let her alone why trouble
[1:31:32] ye her she has wrought a good work on
[1:31:36] me for ye have the poor with you always
[1:31:39] and whensoever you will uh may do them
[1:31:42] good but me you have not always she has
[1:31:44] done what she could she has come
[1:31:47] beforehand to anoint my body for the
[1:31:51] bearing he knew why he was there that
[1:31:53] week
[1:31:54] he knew what was coming he also knew he
[1:31:56] was going to have to make a
[1:31:59] decision he was going to have to say not
[1:32:02] my will but thy will be
[1:32:06] done now the priests are really wanting
[1:32:09] to to um I think there was two more
[1:32:13] scriptures with that there maybe verily
[1:32:15] I say unto you whosoever wheresoever the
[1:32:17] gospel shall be preached throughout the
[1:32:19] whole world this also that she has done
[1:32:21] shall be spoken of her a memoral
[1:32:23] Memorial of her and Judas scariot one of
[1:32:27] the 12 went unto the chief priests to
[1:32:29] betray him unto
[1:32:32] them when your motive is money when your
[1:32:35] motive is
[1:32:36] to watch out watch where you can end
[1:32:40] up but somebody was called to do
[1:32:45] that somebody has to play the part
[1:32:47] somebody has to fit in that
[1:32:49] part and it's God's
[1:32:52] chosing
[1:32:54] and and
[1:32:55] if I I I I hear Brother Bram
[1:32:59] saying if he told me depart from me I
[1:33:02] never knew you I would say I love him
[1:33:05] too much to argue with
[1:33:09] him that's that that's hard to do
[1:33:17] also
[1:33:18] so we know here Judas has got this
[1:33:23] somebody had to betray him somebody had
[1:33:25] to turn him in somebody had to fulfill
[1:33:29] scripture and I didn't do the choosing
[1:33:33] you don't do the choosing God
[1:33:36] chooses but I would love to have that
[1:33:38] same spirit that same attitude that
[1:33:41] brother brandom had and that would take
[1:33:42] the spirit of Christ in me because
[1:33:45] that's what it was not my will but thy
[1:33:49] will be done he says so we know that
[1:33:52] he's he he's he's
[1:33:54] Judas is is is making that plans he said
[1:33:58] and they're trying to figure out they're
[1:34:01] and then they come and they gather
[1:34:02] themselves together in honor of the
[1:34:06] Passover Jesus washed their feet broke
[1:34:08] the unleaving bread with them and and to
[1:34:12] be
[1:34:12] there we have some of it recorded some
[1:34:15] of but just to be there can you imagine
[1:34:17] just being with the guy with the video
[1:34:19] camera or the whatever they do it with
[1:34:21] now and videoing this and recording what
[1:34:23] was going on in seen it
[1:34:24] all it'd be amazing to see you would get
[1:34:28] to see men be men and
[1:34:31] human and you would see a God that still
[1:34:33] loved them and be willing to talk to
[1:34:36] them and share with them and wash their
[1:34:42] feet when you wash your brother and
[1:34:44] sister's
[1:34:45] feet a after communion remember that he
[1:34:48] did that for
[1:34:51] you and he would say I'm doing it for
[1:34:53] one of yours Lord this this daughter or
[1:34:56] this son is
[1:34:57] yours he
[1:34:59] says and at this time Judas makes that
[1:35:02] that final decision to betray the
[1:35:06] Lord and and again somebody had to do it
[1:35:10] somebody had to fulfill that part of the
[1:35:13] scripture and Jesus told him to go and
[1:35:16] do and he went to the priest we know the
[1:35:19] payment how they set up he how are we
[1:35:23] going to know which when it is well I'm
[1:35:24] going to kiss him on the side he
[1:35:28] says and Jesus and his remaining
[1:35:30] disciples then go let's go over
[1:35:34] to I've got to kneel before my father
[1:35:39] and talk to
[1:35:42] him just stop for a minute and think
[1:35:44] about
[1:35:46] it you
[1:35:48] know that this
[1:35:50] weekend coming Friday Saturday Sunday
[1:35:55] you're going to take be taken before
[1:35:58] court and and they're going to try
[1:36:01] you and they're going to they're going
[1:36:03] to treat you as a common Thief maybe
[1:36:07] even worse has a murderer they let a
[1:36:09] murderer go
[1:36:11] instead imagine
[1:36:14] yourself and you could say to them
[1:36:17] Father forgive them they don't know what
[1:36:19] they
[1:36:22] do and again some of these things are
[1:36:24] reading is what brother Dan had wrote
[1:36:26] down in his study so I may owe him after
[1:36:30] this we call it good Friday but it was
[1:36:33] probably the worst day in
[1:36:35] history yet it was the best in
[1:36:42] history they took Jesus by force in
[1:36:46] Gethsemane we know that he had prayed
[1:36:49] father if it be thy will let this cup
[1:36:52] pass for me
[1:36:54] asks his disciples to pray with him and
[1:36:56] he gets up and they're asleep and he he
[1:36:59] wakes him up and he goes and prays some
[1:37:01] more and he get up and they're asleep
[1:37:04] again uh they just didn't really
[1:37:07] understand what was about to
[1:37:10] happen and finally he just says okay
[1:37:12] sleep you're going to need it you're
[1:37:14] about to go through one of the toughest
[1:37:15] times in your life
[1:37:18] also so they come after him with swords
[1:37:22] we we know this story you've read it all
[1:37:23] just so just quickly go through
[1:37:26] this and and they take him to the priest
[1:37:29] and everything is a false testimony a
[1:37:31] false witness against them made up
[1:37:32] stories accusations and
[1:37:37] all but see the one that was actually
[1:37:41] accusing through them is the one that's
[1:37:43] always been a
[1:37:47] liar so he can't tell the
[1:37:50] truth false accusations it said
[1:37:54] so when he's talking to you and telling
[1:37:55] you it's a false
[1:37:57] accusation you take God in his word
[1:38:00] that's a
[1:38:01] TR there's nothing false in that but he
[1:38:04] tells you oh that's not for you that's
[1:38:06] not you that's his
[1:38:10] Spirit even though the the Witnesses
[1:38:13] were proven wrong they insisted on
[1:38:14] killing him why because he was going to
[1:38:17] give his life somebody was going to do
[1:38:21] it we know they sent him to pilate to be
[1:38:26] judged and
[1:38:27] crucified pilate didn't find fault in
[1:38:29] him so he used a Jewish tradition of
[1:38:32] pardoning a criminal during the
[1:38:35] Passover and offered up Jesus to be
[1:38:37] pardoned instead of choosing they chose
[1:38:40] a murderer named barabus to be
[1:38:44] released if you look at what's going on
[1:38:47] today in in in the world news and
[1:38:51] everything how it has G gone from
[1:38:54] Christianity to be immoral to some of
[1:38:56] the sickest things happening out there
[1:38:59] and they would choose a murderer to be
[1:39:03] released over a just righteous
[1:39:10] man but had they chose him to be
[1:39:13] released and murdered barabus you and I
[1:39:17] would still be in our sins today wow we
[1:39:20] would have no
[1:39:22] hope but they they had to do what the
[1:39:25] scripture
[1:39:27] said Mark
[1:39:30] 15
[1:39:34] 1239
[1:39:36] did I don't know if I gave you that he
[1:39:38] said and Jesus cried with a loud voice
[1:39:40] and gave up the ghost so now we
[1:39:44] know he's there he's going to be
[1:39:49] crucified all his disciples run
[1:39:54] uh Peter had just told him I'm not going
[1:39:57] to deny you it's not going to be I'm
[1:39:59] going to stand for you I'm going to be
[1:40:01] there and Jesus turned on say you're
[1:40:04] going to deny me three times and after
[1:40:07] the third time you're going to hear that
[1:40:08] rooster crow and you're going to know
[1:40:11] hey he looks like one of those that was
[1:40:13] with Jesus he dresses like them he looks
[1:40:16] like them he talks like them he quotes
[1:40:19] the scripture he quotes the message no I
[1:40:22] don't I you know and he began to began
[1:40:24] to began to began
[1:40:26] to he had to fulfill scripture
[1:40:30] too
[1:40:32] okay sometimes sometimes we find oursel
[1:40:36] in a situation just be honest with it
[1:40:40] and we don't exactly come out real real
[1:40:43] true real clean we we kind of hedge
[1:40:46] around a little bit make it you
[1:40:49] know you know sometimes it's just easy
[1:40:52] to say I was wrong
[1:40:54] sometimes it's
[1:40:57] hard so so all this is happening and now
[1:41:00] all his disciples disappear he's hanging
[1:41:03] on the
[1:41:05] cross this is what he had come for when
[1:41:08] he said not my will but thy will be done
[1:41:12] he said okay let's go do
[1:41:16] this and then he gave up he said he
[1:41:19] cried with a loud voice and gave up the
[1:41:21] ghost this was would be Mark
[1:41:26] 15: 37
[1:41:29] 3839 and Jesus cried with a loud voice
[1:41:32] and gave up The Ghost and the veil of
[1:41:33] the temple was rent in Twain From the
[1:41:36] top to the
[1:41:37] bottom there was now
[1:41:41] access to the Eternal one the one that
[1:41:44] only the high priest could go to once a
[1:41:47] year the one that you had to depend on
[1:41:50] him being accepted by God for you
[1:41:54] now you can go back right back into that
[1:41:57] holy of holies and talk to God yourself
[1:42:00] thank
[1:42:02] God Hey Brother Daniel can you go see
[1:42:05] the Lord today for me and brother Daniel
[1:42:08] says let me check my calendar I can't
[1:42:10] get in there till next sorry it'll be
[1:42:14] August before I can get in there for you
[1:42:17] you can go in yourself today
[1:42:22] amen
[1:42:24] he says and then the Centurion which
[1:42:27] stood over against him saw that he so he
[1:42:30] cried out and gave up the ghost He said
[1:42:32] truly this man was the son of
[1:42:37] God maybe it was a little too
[1:42:40] late I want to know him now not at the
[1:42:43] last
[1:42:44] moment we know that Joseph of Marthia
[1:42:47] asked pilate for the body which pilate
[1:42:49] gave him they laid Jesus in the Tomb and
[1:42:52] rolled a stole over over the
[1:42:55] opening if if these priests and all them
[1:42:58] had followed Jesus and watched Jesus and
[1:43:01] saw him turn the water into wine and saw
[1:43:04] him take the Loaves and and multiply
[1:43:07] them in the fish and why would they
[1:43:09] think a stone would keep him
[1:43:13] in I don't
[1:43:19] know so he was tried and crucified
[1:43:22] horrible day yet had a glorious day and
[1:43:25] today which is Saturday probably wasn't
[1:43:27] much
[1:43:28] better you know Friday Saturday things
[1:43:33] didn't look good the disciples had all
[1:43:35] run they had all spread they had all
[1:43:39] gone the very ones that were telling him
[1:43:41] we won't deny you I'll go with you and
[1:43:43] they're they're boasting of what they're
[1:43:44] going to do and he turns around he says
[1:43:45] you're going to deny
[1:43:47] me you're going to run you're going to
[1:43:52] hide
[1:43:54] Matthew
[1:43:57] 27 62 to 66 there now the next day that
[1:44:03] followed the day of preparation the
[1:44:06] chief priests and Pharisees came
[1:44:07] together and DEP pilot saying sir we
[1:44:09] remember that that deceiver said while
[1:44:11] he was yet
[1:44:13] alive after three days I will rise
[1:44:17] again can you imagine they're saying it
[1:44:20] could happen we better make sure it
[1:44:27] doesn't you know we're looking at it
[1:44:29] from a different perspective altoe
[1:44:32] looking at it back this way and we know
[1:44:34] he's living and he's alive but just
[1:44:37] thinking about that command therefore
[1:44:39] that the Seer be made sure until the
[1:44:41] third day lest his disciples come by
[1:44:43] night and steal him away and say unto
[1:44:46] the people he is risen from the dead so
[1:44:48] the last error shall be worse than the
[1:44:52] first
[1:44:54] pilate said unto him you have a watch go
[1:44:56] your way and make sure make it as sure
[1:44:58] as you can so they went and made the
[1:45:00] separer sure sealing the stone and
[1:45:03] setting a
[1:45:04] watch so I want you guys to stay here
[1:45:07] and I don't want anything to happen okay
[1:45:10] you got to stay here you got to watch
[1:45:11] this thing for three days because he
[1:45:13] said he was coming out in three days so
[1:45:15] make sure it doesn't
[1:45:21] happen and then
[1:45:23] Sunday morning
[1:45:25] came and brother Dan will take it from
[1:45:30] there he's alive today he's the same
[1:45:34] yesterday today in for musicians come
[1:45:37] up he's the same yesterday today and
[1:45:40] forever he changes
[1:45:46] not that he would be willingly to go and
[1:45:49] suffer and take this and hurt and the
[1:45:52] bruise the the chastisement the false
[1:45:55] accusations the lies said about him and
[1:45:58] all he was stripped naked
[1:46:02] publicly and hung on a cross for you and
[1:46:06] for
[1:46:08] me I've asked brother Josiah if he would
[1:46:10] take this song Oh What A
[1:46:14] Savior let's
[1:46:17] stand let's just pray for him over here
[1:46:21] Lord it would take many many services to

[1:46:32] days but Lord we

[1:50:59] brother Aaron
[1:51:03] amen I appreciated our brother and and
[1:51:05] all that he said but one thing he said
[1:51:08] that was it was a little bit
[1:51:10] subtle and it just it just gave me a
[1:51:13] blessing he said when he was fixed in
[1:51:15] that cabinet he said he got it all
[1:51:18] installed and he got it fixed and then
[1:51:21] he left and he got a call to go back to
[1:51:26] the
[1:51:28] job and he turned around and brother
[1:51:33] Aaron said this he said he said it's
[1:51:35] okay just go
[1:51:36] back let me tell you something Jesus
[1:51:40] left 2,000 years
[1:51:43] ago but he's coming
[1:51:46] back and when he comes back he'll finish
[1:51:48] the job these sinful bodies will be be
[1:51:53] changed all will be made new at the at
[1:51:57] that time we'll go to a wedding supper
[1:52:01] there won't be any
[1:52:02] more suffering there won't be any more
[1:52:05] death it's going to be a great day and I
[1:52:08] believe that that day is coming
[1:52:10] soon I appreciate it brother and go
[1:52:13] through going through each day on Palm
[1:52:15] Sunday and then on
[1:52:18] Monday Jesus was walking along and he
[1:52:22] saw the Fig Tree he cursed
[1:52:25] it thing died and he went straight over
[1:52:28] into the temple he turned over the money
[1:52:30] [Music]
[1:52:31] changers I think uh I think somewhere
[1:52:34] it's written in the Bible that there is
[1:52:35] a time to speak and there's a time to be
[1:52:38] quiet it would have been a very good
[1:52:40] time to be quiet at that time when Jesus
[1:52:43] was walking by he cursed that fig tree
[1:52:45] and he went into the money
[1:52:47] changers that man meant business on that
[1:52:50] day and I just would have loved would
[1:52:53] have loved to been there see see what
[1:52:56] happened like brother Aaron said if you
[1:52:57] could if you could take a video of all
[1:52:59] of
[1:52:59] [Music]
[1:53:01] it but would I rather had a video or
[1:53:04] would I'd rather have all of these
[1:53:06] brothers different testimonies and their
[1:53:08] different perspectives I think one day
[1:53:10] brother Aaron I'm going to just ask each
[1:53:14] one of them to give me their
[1:53:16] testimony get John's take of it
[1:53:18] Matthew's take of
[1:53:20] it and Mary Magdalene and all of them
[1:53:23] it's going to be that's going to be a
[1:53:24] great
[1:53:26] day we got we got plenty of time brother
[1:53:29] Aon said we might have to stand in line
[1:53:31] for a while but it won't be any time
[1:53:33] there brother ml I'm going to bring the
[1:53:35] I'm going to bring the microphone down
[1:53:37] to you to close in
[1:53:39] [Music]
[1:53:51] prayer

[1:53:59] evening for your loving kindness to
[1:54:04] us we just thank you Lord that we
[1:54:07] can know you amen and have fellowship
[1:54:12] with you
[1:54:15] amen we thank you for this uh service

[1:54:21] said pray that you'll go with each
[1:54:25] one take them home safely and may they
[1:54:29] have
[1:54:30] a remainder of their week be
[1:54:36] blessed I ask your mercies on us all now
[1:54:40] in Jesus Christ's name
[1:54:45] amen brothers and sisters as I said at
[1:54:48] the beginning of
[1:54:50] service it's a very very very important
[1:54:53] week and if we
[1:54:56] could spend time in
[1:54:59] prayer this
[1:55:01] week go before the
[1:55:04] Lord ask that he would pour out his
[1:55:08] blessings upon those that need it on
[1:55:10] Sunday as I said there'll be visitors
[1:55:12] there's always visitors on Easter and
[1:55:14] there's always people that haven't maybe
[1:55:16] come to church all year but may they
[1:55:19] find something real and may they find it
[1:55:23] in every person in this
[1:55:26] congregation may they see the Holy
[1:55:29] Spirit just shine forth in
[1:55:31] love when they come in I pray that they
[1:55:35] would leave different people but
[1:55:38] brothers and sisters it won't happen
[1:55:40] unless we are
[1:55:42] praying unless we're going to the Lord
[1:55:45] for each other and will you will you
[1:55:48] take this week think about what brother
[1:55:51] Aaron brought to tonight and how each
[1:55:54] day marked a different thing that
[1:55:58] happened and then on Good Friday the
[1:56:00] crucifixion of our
[1:56:02] Lord and on Saturday must have been a
[1:56:05] really hard day but then as brother
[1:56:06] Aaron said but then there was a
[1:56:08] Resurrection on Sunday morning and may
[1:56:10] this Sunday morning be a
[1:56:13] resurrection of many people that have
[1:56:15] died in sin but may they die to
[1:56:19] themselves and then they may they be
[1:56:21] resurrected new people
[1:56:24] I'm going to ask you to do
[1:56:26] something don't take it
[1:56:29] haphazardly but I'm going to ask you if
[1:56:32] you will pray this week will you raise
[1:56:34] your hand before this congregation and
