[31:51] [Music]
[32:07] to sing God's praise
[32:12] that when we first

[32:24] we've been there ten thousand s
[32:30] [Music]
[32:31] rise

[33:40] [Music]
[33:41] amen he's worthy of all praise
[33:45] appreciate that and you may be seated
[33:52] I'm I'm tempted to call them back up to
[33:55] sing that again
[33:56] sister Martha but
[33:59] and you'll understand why in a bit
[34:03] um
[34:04] I have three sermons and I'm not sure
[34:06] which one
[34:08] to start with
[34:10] to go in the middle and to finish with
[34:13] until that song was sung
[34:16] and and then now you understand and
[34:20] those of you who have had ministered and
[34:22] have prepared
[34:24] you've stood behind the door or wherever
[34:26] and you wondered is this what I should
[34:27] Minister on today
[34:30] sometimes you know it's exactly what you
[34:32] should Minister sometimes you've got
[34:33] questions
[34:35] and um
[34:37] but when they began to sing that I said
[34:39] okay Lord that's what you told me to do
[34:40] what you impressed in my heart I believe
[34:42] it was Friday
[34:44] and I put it first
[34:46] and I didn't ask him to sing that song I
[34:48] had no idea they were going to sing it
[34:51] but it matters to the master
[34:54] it
[34:56] and and it's not something that he gets
[34:58] taken by surprise
[35:00] where it's like oh my I gotta go deal
[35:02] with this now but he's already made
[35:04] preparation for it
[35:07] so you know
[35:08] you put insurance on your vehicle just
[35:11] in case
[35:13] and when you buy the vehicle and you owe
[35:17] the insurance really is for the people
[35:20] you owe it to so that they get their
[35:22] money
[35:23] but he put a Blessed Assurance in our
[35:26] hearts
[35:28] because he knew we would need it
[35:31] and I appreciate that today so
[35:35] would it be too much to ask you to come
[35:37] up and sing it one more time
[35:40] what's that
[35:43] what'd you do because I didn't hear it
[35:44] clearly I just heard enough words
[35:47] to know that it fits so well and while
[35:50] they're making some preparation to sing
[35:52] that one more time
[35:54] how many enjoyed that test
[35:57] Ed spoke to my heart
[35:59] we did hear with sister Bonnie
[36:02] concerning the hip surgery and the
[36:04] report we got was the break
[36:07] was not at the joint and the doctor told
[36:09] him
[36:10] that because it was not at the Joint it
[36:12] heals better and stronger
[36:15] but also with Brother Sam Marriott with

[36:30] things that we always
[36:33] want to do thank you appreciate that
[36:36] [Music]

[37:00] more broken than whole

[37:10] and you can't tell a soul
[37:16] I may not know what you're going through
[37:22] may not could make that high mountain
[37:25] move but one thing I found that I really
[37:30] want you to know
[37:36] if it matters to you
[37:41] it matters to the master
[37:46] he wants to share the burden to bear
[37:52] whisper please
[37:55] [Music]
[38:19] friend do you think the maker and Giver
[38:24] of Life
[38:28] is far too busy to care about your
[38:34] trouble and try try
[38:41] that falls to the ground
[38:44] he hears the tears that don't make a
[38:48] sound if only you knew how precious you
[38:53] are in his sight
[38:58] if it matters to you
[39:03] it matters to the master
[39:08] he wants to share the burden to bear
[39:13] Christmas
[39:17] [Music]
[39:23] pain or you're really needing an answer
[39:29] if it matters to you
[39:34] it matters to the master
[39:39] if it's your greatest joy or your
[39:44] deepest pain or you're really needing an
[39:49] answer
[39:50] if it matters to you
[39:54] it doesn't only matter to you

[40:39] care of
[40:41] and then you say how did that come
[40:42] through but

[41:35] not this yes this coming Sunday the
[41:37] fourth
[41:39] we're going to make some announcements
[41:41] concerning
[41:42] the meeting we've had as a pastorship
[41:45] and and all that to the congregation
[41:47] that uh brother Dan Evans brother Peter
[41:52] McFadden myself
[41:54] fill that in our hearts what what
[41:58] to present to you to the congregation
[42:00] and I know there's been a lot of
[42:02] questions and a lot of been a lot of
[42:03] wondering
[42:05] but um so you keep this week in prayer
[42:08] that the Lord would
[42:10] would lead us and guide us in the right
[42:12] direction he has he's never left us
[42:15] alone
[42:16] and I'm glad he doesn't do everything
[42:18] the way we want it but he does what's
[42:20] best and you'll understand that a little
[42:22] bit more this morning
[42:24] show
[42:28] I would I opened scripture of the day I
[42:31] guess it was Friday
[42:34] and I read it in you get it on your
[42:37] phone you get it on your computer maybe
[42:39] different things and and you you read
[42:41] scripture the day and
[42:43] and hopefully that's not the only
[42:44] scripture you read but there's it's a
[42:47] way to start the day it's it's maybe
[42:49] while I'm driving I'll do
[42:51] not read it I'll listen to it
[42:54] and and things like that and just just
[42:56] an encouraging way to start the day
[42:59] and I don't know how many times it's
[43:01] been many a times I've had a question of
[43:03] wondering and the scripture of the day
[43:05] answers it
[43:07] something or maybe something you hear
[43:09] brother banham say or maybe somebody
[43:11] shares something with you what means
[43:12] them and it's just an answer so
[43:16] the scripture was found in in Mark and
[43:18] you may you may stay seated
[43:20] chapter nine
[43:23] and we're going to read verses 17 to 26.
[43:28] but if you if you start and look in in
[43:30] chapter 9
[43:33] it's the mount Transfiguration
[43:35] experience
[43:39] when Jesus Takes you know the two
[43:41] disciples up with him and they watch
[43:43] what happens in Moses and Elijah come up
[43:46] and and Peter speaks out and says let's
[43:48] make three Tabernacles
[43:52] and and it does tell you in the
[43:54] scripture that Peter just didn't know
[43:55] what to say didn't know what to think
[43:57] and
[43:58] we've all been in a situation where
[44:00] where something happens and we're at
[44:02] loss of words and maybe sometimes it
[44:04] would just be best if we didn't say
[44:05] something but we feel we need to say
[44:07] something
[44:08] and we do and then you wonder why did I
[44:10] say that you know
[44:12] but the scripture says that the cloud
[44:15] covered
[44:16] Moses and Elijah and just Jesus was
[44:18] showing and says hear ye him
[44:22] and and so if you read that first part
[44:25] of it Jesus is talking with them and
[44:29] it makes you kind of wonder how the how
[44:31] they were feeling about that time you
[44:33] know Peter saying I did it again
[44:36] boy if I could just learn to hold my my
[44:39] and not speak out so quickly
[44:43] um you know it as hard as it is to
[44:45] believe sometimes they were just like us
[44:49] they needed a redeemer they needed a
[44:51] savior they needed salvation they needed
[44:54] help
[44:55] and I'm glad it was recorded in the
[44:57] scriptures
[44:59] and and so as if going further along and
[45:03] even at the end of Mark chapter 9 Jesus
[45:06] has to rebuke them because they're
[45:08] disgusting amongst themselves who's
[45:09] going to be the greatest of all
[45:13] we'd love it if if the Lord would come
[45:15] and he would meet with us and and he
[45:17] would share his glory with us and then
[45:19] after that one time we'd never had an
[45:21] issue or a problem again but no we
[45:24] continue being human
[45:26] we continue with our daily struggles and
[45:28] and and you know as many times as I've
[45:31] said Lord you know I love you and I love
[45:33] you with all my heart and then I began
[45:35] to question again
[45:37] I Love You Lord but why this and why
[45:39] that I know you have my best interest in
[45:42] mind
[45:43] it matters to the master but then I
[45:45] question why this Lord
[45:48] so
[45:49] the scripture of the day was here out of
[45:52] Mark nine but I want to go start from
[45:53] verse 17.
[45:55] and we'll go to verse 26 and
[45:58] I was reading the scripture and I turned
[46:00] to my wife in in the in the room and and
[46:02] I said
[46:03] it's a natural healing of a Young Man
[46:07] but I said couldn't we apply that
[46:10] scripture to every portion of our life
[46:15] and I was thinking this whole time is is
[46:17] that how you want me to go Lord because
[46:18] I've got something else and I've got
[46:20] something else too
[46:22] and then they sang that song
[46:25] it matters to the master
[46:28] and I said I was crying back there
[46:31] happy for them but they didn't know
[46:35] but thanking the Lord because I felt he
[46:37] put his heart but I still question him
[46:39] so
[46:41] so what
[46:43] and and as this the Jesus and disciple
[46:46] are coming through and and there's a
[46:47] multitude and and the Pharisees and them
[46:49] around there and
[46:51] and this is after this he sees this and
[46:54] then
[46:56] and Jesus asked a question and one of
[46:58] the multitude answers said master I have
[47:01] brought unto thee my son which has a
[47:04] dumb Spirit he says
[47:06] and and sometimes just was my thinking I
[47:10] said is there any Spirit that's smart
[47:12] outside of the spirit of God
[47:14] but I know that word doesn't mean that
[47:16] but Satan just likes to mix everything
[47:18] up and tear things apart
[47:21] and I you know we know it means not the
[47:24] ability to speak
[47:26] but I said if it's not the spirit of
[47:28] Christ it's a dumb spirit
[47:30] if it don't yield itself and and we
[47:32] won't and we're in the same condition if
[47:35] we won't yield ourselves to him and let
[47:37] him have his way
[47:39] and and sometimes how many times we have
[47:41] said why did I do that why did I go why
[47:43] didn't I listen
[47:45] you know and it's it's it's uh what is
[47:48] it um hindsight is 2020 I believe they
[47:50] say
[47:51] and wheresoever he take of him he
[47:53] teareth him and he's speaking to the
[47:55] spirit in it in this child and he fell
[47:57] with and he gnashes with his teeth and
[47:59] and pineth away
[48:01] and I spoke to thy disciples that they
[48:03] could cast him out and they could not
[48:08] so we could take this just as a a
[48:11] written story of what happened with the
[48:13] disciples or we could look at it closely
[48:15] in our own lives
[48:17] how many things have you struggled with
[48:19] you've prayed over and you just can't
[48:22] seem to get over it
[48:24] or is it just me sometimes no I think
[48:26] it's all of us we battle things we go
[48:28] things in life
[48:30] and this is I begin to share this with
[48:32] my wife I said could we turn and just
[48:34] look at ourselves
[48:36] and see a similarity here
[48:38] but it matters to the master
[48:43] and um
[48:45] so
[48:46] and he answered them and saith o
[48:48] faithless generation
[48:51] how long shall I be with you how long
[48:54] shall I suffer you bring him unto me and
[48:57] this is where it spoke to me why don't
[48:59] you give it to me
[49:02] rather than battling it yourself
[49:04] fighting through it yourself trying to
[49:07] figure it out trying to work it out why
[49:10] don't you give it to God
[49:13] that's for me too
[49:15] maybe before me more than anybody else
[49:19] he says
[49:21] and they brought him unto him and when
[49:24] he saw him straightway the spirit tear
[49:26] him
[49:27] and he fell on the ground and wallowed
[49:30] foaming watch what begins to happen when
[49:33] you begin to approach god with your
[49:35] problems
[49:37] Satan tries his best to Magnify Him make
[49:41] it harder you don't sleep that night you
[49:43] have more problems this begins to happen
[49:45] because he knows he's about to be
[49:47] challenged he knows he's about to be
[49:49] cast out
[49:52] how you understand and so he begins to
[49:55] battle
[49:58] and he asked the father how long and
[50:01] this is again in the word spoke how long
[50:03] is it ago that since this came unto him
[50:06] and he said of a child
[50:11] how long will you battle with us
[50:15] how long will you struggle with this
[50:19] how long will you be too embarrassed
[50:23] to say I have a problem
[50:27] I need some help
[50:31] how many times
[50:33] the symptoms of the sickness of a
[50:35] whatever it might be finally
[50:38] your wife your dad your husband somebody
[50:41] says let's go to the doctor
[50:43] let's go find out what's causing it
[50:46] and and sometimes if it's if you're
[50:49] lucky you get to see the doctor right
[50:50] away you may get a call we can't see you
[50:52] for two more months
[50:53] we got to schedule you for this or you
[50:56] can come in and we'll we'll just get a
[50:58] general overview and then we'll schedule
[51:00] you back in when there's time we've got
[51:02] to do some x-rays we got to do these
[51:04] tests
[51:05] and it might be three more months before
[51:07] you really know what's going on
[51:11] but when you take it to the Lord Jesus
[51:13] Christ
[51:14] and you give it to him
[51:16] could I say it this way it's already
[51:18] been resolved
[51:20] it's already been met the answer's
[51:23] already been taken everything you have
[51:24] native has already been supplied
[51:27] and there's not a busy line
[51:31] you know
[51:32] we were we were at the motor vehicle one
[51:35] time and
[51:37] I haven't been there in quite some time
[51:38] because you sit at your desk and take
[51:40] care of a lot of stuff online
[51:42] quickly now
[51:44] the one the first times we went to get
[51:46] uh my brother had had bought a new a car
[51:49] and and I went with him to go get the
[51:53] everything changed over and we were
[51:55] there about five hours
[51:58] because they have five windows and two
[52:00] people working on him
[52:02] you go to this window and you get this
[52:04] done how many remember it when it was
[52:06] that way you know
[52:08] and then they say now go to window
[52:10] number seven
[52:11] and you're number 25
[52:13] and you'll go next and they say now
[52:15] calling number three
[52:17] we sat there for five hours to get about
[52:20] 15 minutes worth of work done
[52:22] because that's how it was today you
[52:24] punch it in the computer you print it
[52:26] out and you got it in your hands
[52:28] but it it was so so here you you hold on
[52:33] to it for a long time
[52:35] and then you give it finally you get to
[52:37] the point where you say I'm going to
[52:38] give it to God
[52:41] and then God answers it and you say why
[52:43] did I take so long to give it to God
[52:47] he says uh and he said of a child since
[52:51] he was just a little one I don't know
[52:54] how old this this boy was but as just a
[52:56] little child he's had this problem
[52:59] and oftentimes it casts them into the
[53:01] fire and into the waters to destroy him
[53:03] but here is this is what he said but if
[53:06] Falcons do anything
[53:08] have compassion on us and help us
[53:14] you know
[53:16] and I'll just say it say it this way we
[53:19] do it is
[53:21] maybe between Mom and Dad when you're
[53:23] growing up and even if you've gotten
[53:25] older even after you're married you
[53:26] wanted you needed some help
[53:30] and you went and you you kind of talked
[53:32] to him real nice
[53:34] hey Dad
[53:36] the yard looks really good I like the
[53:37] way you cleaned it up you know
[53:39] and you wash the car and that's a nice
[53:42] tire wearing that and Dad just saying
[53:44] you're going to ask me or you're not
[53:45] going to ask me
[53:46] you know
[53:47] and we kind of butter him up and he
[53:49] knows what's coming
[53:52] and and you know
[53:54] why not just go talk to the master
[53:58] he said you're welcome to come in you
[54:00] can enter into his presence
[54:03] I I had an experience
[54:07] I was off Wednesday through tomorrow I
[54:10] got extended time off
[54:12] and I believe it was
[54:16] Thursday night maybe
[54:20] I I was just I woke well it was early in
[54:23] the morning woke up about three or four
[54:24] in the morning couldn't sleep
[54:27] and I just went to the living room and I
[54:29] my wife said you okay I said yeah I said
[54:31] I'm just I'm gonna go to the living room
[54:32] and just talk to the Lord
[54:35] and sometimes it takes a while to get
[54:38] yourself to where you feel like you can
[54:40] talk to the Lord
[54:42] I don't know if you've ever struggled
[54:43] through that because you begin to look
[54:45] at yourself
[54:46] you began to look at your thoughts you
[54:48] begin to look at what you get and you
[54:49] say oh I'm not worthy to approach him
[54:53] you would never will be worthy to
[54:55] approach him on your own
[54:57] but he made a way for you to come in
[55:00] that's through the shed blood
[55:03] there was a preparation for the high
[55:06] priest
[55:07] and it was a very very detailed
[55:10] preparation for the high priest to enter
[55:12] into the holy of holies
[55:15] you know how important it was for the
[55:18] high priest to be able to enter into the
[55:19] holy of holies
[55:21] if he was not able to enter in
[55:24] then the sins of the people were not
[55:26] forgiven for that year they were not
[55:28] rolled over
[55:29] that's how important it was
[55:32] it mattered to the whole congregation
[55:34] whether he got in or not suddenly
[55:38] so I nailed down to pray about four in
[55:40] the morning
[55:42] and I just said Lord I just need to talk
[55:44] with you this morning
[55:47] and and and he just took me right to
[55:50] that scene and he said
[55:51] you don't have to worry about it it's
[55:54] already been met come on in to the holy
[55:57] of holies
[56:02] and instead of having to be there for 15
[56:04] hours trying to make everything right
[56:06] trying to get ready trying to get and he
[56:08] just said come on in
[56:10] you're my son
[56:12] I'm willing to talk with you
[56:16] it didn't take an hour it took about
[56:18] five minutes
[56:19] for him to answer and resolve
[56:22] and he said you can go back to sleep now
[56:24] it'll be all right
[56:26] I laid down and I woke up about four
[56:28] hours later
[56:29] at rest
[56:32] God can answer quickly
[56:36] away has been made for you to get into
[56:38] his presence
[56:40] just come and say Lord I'm sorry
[56:43] put it under the blood
[56:45] and let me come into your presence
[56:48] and if you think you desire that
[56:50] Fellowship he desires it a whole lot
[56:53] more
[56:55] if he didn't desire that Fellowship he
[56:57] wouldn't say not my will but thy will be
[57:00] done father
[57:02] but he knew what that would bring in you
[57:06] so he says
[57:10] if Falcons do anything have compassion
[57:13] on us and help us
[57:15] Jesus said unto him if thou can't
[57:18] believe all things are possible to him
[57:22] that believeth
[57:25] all things are possible
[57:29] that you must believe
[57:33] sometimes in our in our belief
[57:36] in in getting to that point we began to
[57:38] look at ourselves
[57:41] Lord if I really believed you I would
[57:43] never do that
[57:46] Lord if I really and we begin to put
[57:48] reasons why we can't get into his
[57:51] presence
[57:53] it's not based on your ability to purify
[57:56] yourself make yourself holy make
[57:59] yourself presentable
[58:03] how could your righteousness ever
[58:04] compare to God's righteousness
[58:07] he made the way he paved the way he
[58:09] provided the way
[58:12] but this is what he answered if thou
[58:15] can'tst believe all things are possible
[58:19] Lord I accept what you've done and I
[58:21] believe I can come on in into your
[58:24] presence
[58:26] and I can receive of you what I have
[58:28] native
[58:31] and it's not just for somebody who has
[58:33] served the Lord their whole life
[58:34] or more it's for that sinner they'll say
[58:37] I'm sorry forgive me
[58:40] doesn't take much longer than that
[58:44] you know the the a lot of the churches
[58:46] in organizations and dominations now
[58:48] they give us a list of things that you
[58:50] must do to get to this point
[58:55] it's it's how they work but the grace of
[58:57] God is simply that the grace of God
[59:00] his Mercy that endureth forever
[59:06] and you know the the
[59:10] the thing is when we we cry out to him
[59:13] and we say how how am I unbelief
[59:17] and and how many times
[59:20] has God done something for you
[59:22] and you just know it was God
[59:25] there's no other explanation there's no
[59:28] there's no coincidence there's no by
[59:30] accident that was God
[59:33] I'll testify to that that I'll say amen
[59:36] that's nothing but the truth
[59:39] is if thou can't believe and sometimes
[59:42] we have to encourage ourselves
[59:45] brother random talks about that he's
[59:47] just
[59:47] Satan just talking to him he said what
[59:50] about that and what about that and
[59:52] accusations and then he would have to
[59:54] bring back to his memory then what about
[59:56] that healing and what about this miracle
[59:59] that took place and what about that part
[1:00:01] in my life and who and he said I'd
[1:00:03] re-encourage myself
[1:00:06] that's God and he hasn't left me
[1:00:09] he's still with me
[1:00:12] you know and and he says and straightway
[1:00:16] the father of child cried out and said
[1:00:18] with tears Lord I believe help thou mine
[1:00:22] unbelief
[1:00:26] the reason that's put in the scripture
[1:00:28] is so we can get something from it so we
[1:00:31] can encourage you so we can use it when
[1:00:33] we have need of it
[1:00:36] how thou my unbelief
[1:00:40] and God's got ways to do that
[1:00:43] from as simple as that song today
[1:00:46] when you're questioning is this right is
[1:00:49] this right
[1:00:51] and in as many times as God does that I
[1:00:55] still ask him again can you show me one
[1:00:57] more time
[1:01:00] and and I he's a patient loving father
[1:01:04] is a caring father
[1:01:06] he does and he says one more time
[1:01:09] one more time
[1:01:10] but he expects some growth out of us
[1:01:14] uh you know it's it's that
[1:01:17] I I remember this often
[1:01:20] and um I have an older brother
[1:01:24] and the uh the ice cream truck used to
[1:01:27] come down
[1:01:28] the street and you'd hear it and as a
[1:01:30] kid
[1:01:31] all right you know the ice cream trucks
[1:01:33] can we get can we get it get some money
[1:01:35] so
[1:01:37] I um
[1:01:39] I turned around and and we're all
[1:01:41] excited because Here Comes yeah I said
[1:01:42] so my older brother says
[1:01:44] go ask Dad for some money
[1:01:47] and that was a lot 25 cents got each one
[1:01:49] of us an ice cream all of us for 125
[1:01:52] cent piece so yeah that goes back a ways
[1:01:55] and I don't mean this to to to make my
[1:01:59] dad
[1:02:00] to embarrass something but
[1:02:02] I come running up to the door and then I
[1:02:05] go Daddy
[1:02:06] because I want my my older brother sends
[1:02:09] me to go ask Dad
[1:02:11] and my dad just said no from the door
[1:02:16] hey dads do that often
[1:02:20] so quickly I said um is my brother Fred
[1:02:23] inside the house
[1:02:26] the one that sent me to go get the ice
[1:02:28] cream you know the fear the the what do
[1:02:31] I do now
[1:02:32] we're human we react that way
[1:02:37] but he says if thou can't believe
[1:02:40] all things are possible
[1:02:45] he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:02:47] today and forever
[1:02:50] I change not he says
[1:02:54] in in he's made the way for us to be
[1:02:57] able to go
[1:02:59] it's one of those things that we look at
[1:03:01] ourselves too often
[1:03:03] we we we look and say well I'm not
[1:03:06] worthy Lord when will you be worthy
[1:03:09] what could you present to him to make
[1:03:11] yourself worthy
[1:03:13] nothing
[1:03:15] but what makes him proud or could I use
[1:03:18] that word what what pleases him is will
[1:03:20] you will take what he's done for you
[1:03:22] accept it and walk in it
[1:03:25] it's hard to receive a gift
[1:03:29] unless you're one of those that just
[1:03:31] likes to receive
[1:03:32] the honest truth that it's hard to
[1:03:34] receive a gift without thinking now I
[1:03:36] owe
[1:03:38] but a gift is a gift
[1:03:43] you know I if you give somebody
[1:03:44] something with the intention of just
[1:03:47] to please them and their thought is now
[1:03:50] I owe that back
[1:03:53] if you have to pay for the gift then
[1:03:55] it's no longer a gift
[1:03:57] you earned it
[1:03:59] you deserved it you paid for it you've
[1:04:01] met the price
[1:04:03] but if it's given freely with no strings
[1:04:06] attached like what he did for us
[1:04:10] it pleases the father it pleases God
[1:04:13] when you will by faith accept it and
[1:04:15] take it
[1:04:18] you know in in its to us then what what
[1:04:22] if we could understand that is just to
[1:04:24] be thankful
[1:04:26] and just to be grateful and say Lord I
[1:04:28] love you for that I thank you for that
[1:04:31] for what you've done for me and and then
[1:04:34] in in our place then we would say now I
[1:04:37] want to live a life worthy of the Gospel
[1:04:40] I want to share this gift with somebody
[1:04:42] else
[1:04:43] as I was freely received I'll freely
[1:04:46] give
[1:04:48] he says
[1:04:49] so so again he he says help thou mine
[1:04:53] unbelief
[1:04:55] over and over
[1:04:57] I've said that to him Lord help me to
[1:04:59] believe
[1:05:00] help me to take this help me to accept
[1:05:02] it
[1:05:05] you know and and so and then in verse 24
[1:05:08] and when Jesus saw the people came
[1:05:10] running together he rebuked the foul
[1:05:13] Spirit saying unto him thou dumb and
[1:05:15] deaf spirit I charged thee come out of
[1:05:18] him and enter no more into him
[1:05:21] I like that
[1:05:23] I like that he said not only come at him
[1:05:26] but you're not allowed back in either
[1:05:29] and that's how he watches over us and
[1:05:31] that's how he cares for us and the
[1:05:33] spirit cried and rent him sore and he
[1:05:36] came out of him
[1:05:37] and he was as one dead in so much that
[1:05:40] many said he is dead
[1:05:43] and and I'm maybe I'm taking a little
[1:05:46] liberty here to to take that in place to
[1:05:49] our spiritual life
[1:05:53] and I would say when all that is out
[1:05:55] when all that is gone and when I'm dead
[1:06:00] you know what a dead person you can kick
[1:06:01] him and they don't react
[1:06:05] and and when we're completely out got
[1:06:07] rid of ourselves well we've emptied and
[1:06:10] we've completely got rid of ourselves
[1:06:13] then somebody could speak about us
[1:06:15] somebody could say this if this could
[1:06:16] happen this could happen
[1:06:18] but it doesn't affect us that way
[1:06:19] anymore
[1:06:21] you know and it's hard to get to that
[1:06:23] point
[1:06:24] it's hard to get to that point
[1:06:27] but let's look at this and it just spoke
[1:06:29] to me this way
[1:06:31] and he says
[1:06:34] he says what is it that you want me to
[1:06:37] do for you
[1:06:41] and if we're not
[1:06:43] um too embarrassed if we're not too
[1:06:45] too proud of ourselves or whatever it is
[1:06:49] where would we be when he said Lord I
[1:06:51] have some problems
[1:06:53] Lord I have an issue Lord I have some
[1:06:55] things that I that I need dealt with me
[1:06:59] about
[1:07:01] you know I I if this causes me to be
[1:07:04] this way this causes me to act like this
[1:07:07] this causes a reaction this way
[1:07:11] and it's not always very nice
[1:07:14] you know and and Lord I need some help
[1:07:17] dealing with this
[1:07:19] I need some deliverance from this
[1:07:21] and so I
[1:07:23] if if I could just just apply this to
[1:07:26] our own lives
[1:07:28] this is how I felt the Lord spoke it to
[1:07:31] me
[1:07:31] just reading the scripture
[1:07:33] don't take it so much just as a miracle
[1:07:36] that happened in the scripture but what
[1:07:38] about applying this principle for your
[1:07:40] very own life
[1:07:43] saying Lord I need some help
[1:07:46] I've got an issue with something I've
[1:07:48] got a problem with something you know
[1:07:50] and if you if you ever get a chance
[1:07:53] and to speak to some of the brothers
[1:07:55] that that God has used in in in their
[1:07:58] gift and their calling
[1:08:01] hearing some of the testimonies
[1:08:03] of the things that they face with as
[1:08:05] ministers in dealing with people in in
[1:08:09] prayer lines and all the things that are
[1:08:11] exposing that come out
[1:08:13] we all have problems
[1:08:17] we all have things we deal with
[1:08:20] we are all human we still have Flesh on
[1:08:22] us
[1:08:24] but greater is he
[1:08:27] than any of those problems any of those
[1:08:30] things so
[1:08:32] I appreciate God just being
[1:08:35] so so willing to share these things with
[1:08:39] us
[1:08:40] in in reading of the scriptures and and
[1:08:43] putting your own name in there and
[1:08:45] putting yourself Lord I'm in a similar
[1:08:47] situation are you still God
[1:08:49] are you still the same yesterday today
[1:08:51] and forever and he says yes then help me
[1:08:55] help me with this
[1:08:57] we would we would think of some of these
[1:09:00] things you know
[1:09:01] um
[1:09:02] how
[1:09:06] could I say it this way the levels that
[1:09:08] we put things into
[1:09:11] this sin is worse than that sin
[1:09:14] I'm not as bad as that one
[1:09:19] remind yourself he had to go to the
[1:09:21] cross for every one of them
[1:09:27] there is not one sin greater than
[1:09:30] another sin everyone causes death in the
[1:09:32] shedding of his blood
[1:09:34] you know if if there was then then he
[1:09:37] would say okay my blood plus this amount
[1:09:40] of works for that one
[1:09:43] and my blood plus this amount of works
[1:09:46] for this one
[1:09:48] but Jesus Paid It All
[1:09:51] all to him I owe
[1:09:54] now his disciples we know his disciples
[1:09:57] had prayed and they asked Him Father
[1:09:58] they asked him Jesus how come we could
[1:10:02] not cast that one out
[1:10:04] and he did he did make a statement this
[1:10:06] was this comes out by prayer and fasting
[1:10:14] and the one thing that the brother Ram
[1:10:16] told us we could never pray enough
[1:10:21] and you know that it is a battle to pray
[1:10:24] because Satan knows that when you get to
[1:10:27] praying and you get to God
[1:10:29] he's in a real battle
[1:10:32] so he's going to he's going to interrupt
[1:10:34] it every way he can
[1:10:37] fasting
[1:10:38] and there's two things to fasting two
[1:10:40] sides there are those who fast will fast
[1:10:43] and Fast and fast because they believe
[1:10:45] when they're done fasting they have
[1:10:47] through their work of fasting
[1:10:49] drawing them closer to God
[1:10:53] fasting in that sense is not drawing you
[1:10:55] close to your God
[1:10:57] because then it's a work
[1:11:01] fasting in the sense Lord I'm humbling
[1:11:03] myself
[1:11:04] I'm setting myself away I'm taking and
[1:11:07] I'm not meeting my own needs at this
[1:11:09] time but rather making myself available
[1:11:12] to you
[1:11:13] it pleases the Lord
[1:11:16] and prayer prayer time
[1:11:19] and and for the longest time
[1:11:22] prayer to so many means nailing down
[1:11:24] somewhere and being in a specific place
[1:11:26] for prayer
[1:11:28] but you can pray all the time
[1:11:32] you can have an attitude of Prayer in
[1:11:34] your heart all the time you can speak to
[1:11:36] God all the time
[1:11:38] you know we have one of these now
[1:11:41] and we even carry it to the pulpit now
[1:11:45] because it's a whole lot easier to read
[1:11:47] this than that clock back there
[1:11:50] but it's it's constant
[1:11:53] I can call my wife I can hear this I can
[1:11:55] do this it's constant we have that
[1:11:57] ability
[1:11:59] when before you had to go well when we
[1:12:04] got married we didn't have a film
[1:12:06] didn't have a house phone there wasn't a
[1:12:07] cell phone
[1:12:08] there were phones we just didn't have
[1:12:10] one okay
[1:12:11] I'm not saying we were married that long
[1:12:13] ago there were no faults no
[1:12:15] don't take it that way
[1:12:17] but our neighbor had a phone
[1:12:20] and so we made we made an agreement that
[1:12:23] in an emergency we could use the phone
[1:12:26] and also in that agreement was that if
[1:12:30] she was an older lady lived by herself
[1:12:33] that if she needed any help I would go
[1:12:35] over and do so I'd go fix something for
[1:12:37] her whatever so we had the use of a an
[1:12:40] emergency phone
[1:12:42] and you know what we lived without a
[1:12:45] phone
[1:12:45] we survived
[1:12:47] but today
[1:12:50] and I know I'm not the only one we're
[1:12:52] all sitting at the dinner table and our
[1:12:54] phone is right next to the plate
[1:12:57] am I the only one that's probably a lot
[1:12:59] of us that way
[1:13:01] you know
[1:13:03] but even closer than that
[1:13:08] is one who said I'll never leave you
[1:13:11] I'll never forsake you
[1:13:13] you can call on my name and I will
[1:13:16] answer
[1:13:18] there's never a busy signal and at the
[1:13:21] end of the month there's not a bill due
[1:13:27] Jesus Paid It all all to him I owe
[1:13:31] but I would dare to say we talked
[1:13:33] through this one more
[1:13:35] than we talked to him
[1:13:42] you know
[1:13:43] but just a moment's prayer just
[1:13:46] breathing his name say Lord Jesus I need
[1:13:49] some help
[1:13:51] he's always there
[1:13:54] when he says this one comes with fasting
[1:13:56] in prayer
[1:13:59] setting aside of time
[1:14:03] for him instead of for yourself fasting
[1:14:06] that way
[1:14:08] first thing we think of fasting is no
[1:14:10] food what about fasting of things that
[1:14:13] occupy our time
[1:14:16] and I'm guilty
[1:14:18] I don't stand up here as one that
[1:14:19] doesn't have those problems I'm just
[1:14:21] telling you the things we go through in
[1:14:22] life
[1:14:24] and and some of it is necessary
[1:14:27] but not all of it
[1:14:30] it's okay to have a good time it's okay
[1:14:33] to have good Fellowship
[1:14:36] but dedicate some time I've thought of
[1:14:39] it this way he asked 10 percent
[1:14:43] 24-hour day that's two hours and 40
[1:14:46] minutes
[1:14:49] 365 days in the year that's 36.5 days
[1:14:53] just that's just 10 in a year that
[1:14:56] doesn't sound like a whole lot
[1:14:58] but neither is two hours and 40 minutes
[1:15:00] in a day because you can spend that time
[1:15:02] quickly
[1:15:04] giving it to you
[1:15:06] I I may be wrong in those comparisons
[1:15:09] but those are just comparisons that I've
[1:15:10] made
[1:15:11] giving him more time
[1:15:14] that way because he gave it all already
[1:15:16] and he has all the Time in the World to
[1:15:19] be with you
[1:15:21] there's not a busy signal
[1:15:23] there's not a okay now survey number
[1:15:26] three
[1:15:28] I'm sorry the Lord just sent me a text
[1:15:30] message saying I'm sorry we're there and
[1:15:31] he said but I can't get to you till next
[1:15:33] Thursday
[1:15:35] that's never happened
[1:15:39] God is present he's a very present help
[1:15:41] in the time of trouble
[1:15:45] if it matters to you it matters to the
[1:15:47] master
[1:15:50] he has his reasons for doing the things
[1:15:52] that he does in the time he does it
[1:15:56] I need patience Lord and he says okay
[1:15:58] we'll work on that
[1:16:01] I need to be a little bit more like you
[1:16:03] then we'll work on that too and he has
[1:16:06] ways to work on that
[1:16:08] he understands where your weaknesses
[1:16:10] where you're where the parts you
[1:16:12] struggle struggle through
[1:16:14] and he knows how to deal with that
[1:16:17] I worked in in my senior year in high
[1:16:20] school I did a
[1:16:22] uh one semester of working with some
[1:16:26] some some of the kids in the in the
[1:16:28] lower grades I think they were seventh
[1:16:30] eighth grade who had trouble reading
[1:16:32] and um
[1:16:34] they were reading second grade level
[1:16:36] third grade level so at that point it's
[1:16:39] pretty hard to comprehend and go forward
[1:16:40] with what's required in the eighth grade
[1:16:44] so there was four or five of us from the
[1:16:46] high school working with this class
[1:16:49] and there was five boys
[1:16:53] one of them was a migrant student so he
[1:16:55] was only in school a short time short
[1:16:57] time so he never got a good learning
[1:16:59] basis
[1:17:00] the other ones had had not learned to
[1:17:02] read and and for whatever reason
[1:17:06] and and rather the teachers not having
[1:17:08] not wanting to deal with it they would
[1:17:09] just pass them on to the next grade
[1:17:12] so now here they are in eighth grade and
[1:17:13] reading about second grade level math
[1:17:15] let's go uh reading ability which means
[1:17:18] you comprehend very little at dating
[1:17:22] but I still remember
[1:17:25] that I would get called sir
[1:17:29] and to me I wasn't sure yet that's
[1:17:31] that's for an older respected gentleman
[1:17:33] you know but I was older than them and I
[1:17:36] was Sir
[1:17:37] and it caught my attention
[1:17:39] and we work with them for one semester
[1:17:42] where those boys would open a book and
[1:17:44] if it had pictures they would go through
[1:17:46] the book
[1:17:47] if it was just words they'd close it
[1:17:51] because they couldn't read couldn't
[1:17:52] understand it
[1:17:54] but we worked with them for for a full
[1:17:57] semester
[1:17:58] and at the end most of those boys were
[1:18:00] around sixth grade getting into seventh
[1:18:02] grade reading levels
[1:18:05] and to watch the joy in them the smiles
[1:18:09] in their faces when they opened a book
[1:18:11] and begin to read and follow the story
[1:18:13] how happy it made them
[1:18:16] I still remember the joy it brought me
[1:18:20] that I was able to help some kids learn
[1:18:24] to read and not just look at the
[1:18:25] pictures
[1:18:29] that they called me sir
[1:18:31] which I thought oh that went to an older
[1:18:34] person
[1:18:35] maybe now I could get called sir
[1:18:37] but if the joy of watching them grow
[1:18:42] as they begin to be began to read and
[1:18:45] understand their whole world opened up
[1:18:48] because now they could read directions
[1:18:50] on how to do something get to somewhere
[1:18:53] now they could read the plot of the
[1:18:55] story not just by the picture
[1:18:58] and when you begin to grow in God
[1:19:02] and You Begin not only to just see the
[1:19:05] picture
[1:19:07] or the Simplicity but God himself in it
[1:19:11] what a change that makes in your life
[1:19:15] and to be able to help someone get to
[1:19:18] that point
[1:19:19] what a joy that brings to your life to
[1:19:21] watch someone give their heart to God
[1:19:23] and begin to learn of him themselves
[1:19:27] what a joy that brings into your heart
[1:19:30] this is what Jesus was teaching the
[1:19:33] disciples
[1:19:34] as you read through that Mark that
[1:19:37] chapter nine there's four or five
[1:19:39] different experiences he tells them this
[1:19:41] one comes by fasting in prayer
[1:19:46] over here he had just told them oh God
[1:19:49] tells them hear ye him take your eyes
[1:19:52] off everything else put your attention
[1:19:54] on
[1:19:55] what God is doing today
[1:19:57] and the very last part of Mark 9 they're
[1:20:00] arguing amongst themselves is who's
[1:20:02] going to be the greatest
[1:20:05] and Jesus says unless you become as a
[1:20:09] little child
[1:20:11] he said trusting Believing on your
[1:20:15] father
[1:20:18] you know there was a time when there was
[1:20:21] my dad could conquer and take care of
[1:20:24] everything
[1:20:26] just take him to that he could solve it
[1:20:27] he could fix it he could we were
[1:20:30] children
[1:20:31] dad was bigger he was tougher you know
[1:20:33] he could he could lift a lot of weight
[1:20:34] he could do no wrong
[1:20:39] and as time grew up we realized dad was
[1:20:41] human too
[1:20:44] he gave it his best he did all again now
[1:20:47] as my dad got to the age now
[1:20:49] we're realizing that we're there to help
[1:20:52] them
[1:20:53] we're aware that is important
[1:20:55] it was hard here when my dad was in the
[1:20:57] hospital just not too long ago with
[1:20:59] covid
[1:21:00] that he couldn't get out of bed by
[1:21:01] himself
[1:21:03] I had never seen that of my dad
[1:21:06] but I was there to help him hold bring
[1:21:08] him up
[1:21:09] get him up walk him over to the men's
[1:21:11] room whatever whatever we needed to do
[1:21:13] that's what we are for one another
[1:21:17] we've grown
[1:21:18] we've learned these things let us put
[1:21:21] our our shoulder to the wheel let us
[1:21:23] help one another Jesus I don't know but
[1:21:25] that's how I saw this whole chapter
[1:21:28] God sharing with us experiences in life
[1:21:34] and he said all things are possible
[1:21:38] you can believe
[1:21:40] and we we sing that song we cry out make
[1:21:42] me more like you
[1:21:44] Jesus make me more like you
[1:21:47] and he says go through the scriptures
[1:21:49] and read and see how the man grew their
[1:21:54] characters how the ladies grew their
[1:21:57] characters
[1:21:58] through the things they suffered through
[1:22:00] the trials they went through to the
[1:22:02] experiences that they learn
[1:22:04] Lord isn't can I just go down to the
[1:22:06] store and buy a box of experience
[1:22:09] no experience doesn't come that way
[1:22:11] experience comes with working sometimes
[1:22:15] I read
[1:22:16] uh articles or things where uh things
[1:22:19] that have happened with folks
[1:22:22] who are very knowledgeable in their in
[1:22:25] what they do
[1:22:26] you know
[1:22:28] um and I I I remember a lot brother Mike
[1:22:31] Yarbrough and brother Lyle Johnson just
[1:22:34] very experienced in what they do because
[1:22:36] it's it's what they're lifeless
[1:22:38] but two men that never stood up and say
[1:22:41] look at me you got to be like me you got
[1:22:45] they treated us they treated me like
[1:22:47] we're brother
[1:22:49] brother
[1:22:50] John um while Johnson still does
[1:22:54] and I tell you what I did that one time
[1:22:56] with them I walked up to them both of
[1:22:58] them
[1:22:59] it would probably be like going in with
[1:23:01] brother Dan in one ear when you're
[1:23:03] teaching or you're working with you and
[1:23:04] you guys would be talking another
[1:23:05] language I wouldn't understand half of
[1:23:07] what you're saying and what you do
[1:23:09] and I just looked at him and I said it
[1:23:12] this way and I said you know I could not
[1:23:14] recommend either one of your brains to
[1:23:16] anybody
[1:23:18] fine you talk about them stopping fast
[1:23:20] they just stopped and looked at me like
[1:23:22] what are you talking about
[1:23:24] I said but mine would get top dollar
[1:23:27] that really got their attention
[1:23:30] and I said look at you too
[1:23:32] brains that are so used millions and
[1:23:36] millions and millions of miles of usage
[1:23:38] on your brains and mine's still in the
[1:23:40] original package hasn't even been opened
[1:23:42] yet
[1:23:43] it's an original 59 model
[1:23:47] worth a lot of money
[1:23:49] and they both caught what I said I was
[1:23:51] jealous of them
[1:23:53] but you know that which you have put to
[1:23:56] use
[1:23:57] give it for others
[1:23:59] let others know of the love of God and
[1:24:01] what God has done in your life share it
[1:24:03] with others give it to others
[1:24:05] don't keep it in a box
[1:24:07] don't keep it for a rainy day give unto
[1:24:10] others
[1:24:12] this is what he says give do unto others
[1:24:15] as you would have them do unto yourself
[1:24:17] these are Lessons Learned in the
[1:24:20] scriptures
[1:24:21] these are why there was scriptures
[1:24:23] written
[1:24:25] so that we could learn through the
[1:24:27] things that God had done through others
[1:24:32] and sometimes we do have to crowd
[1:24:35] help thou
[1:24:36] May unbelief
[1:24:40] this other part I didn't give to the
[1:24:42] brothers
[1:24:43] it was just something that I I read here
[1:24:49] there was a man
[1:24:51] his name was job
[1:24:56] and and and you know he uh he goes he's
[1:24:59] before the Lord the Lord even boasts of
[1:25:02] job
[1:25:03] have thou have you considered my servant
[1:25:06] job and you know who he's talking to
[1:25:07] he's talking to Satan when he tells him
[1:25:09] this
[1:25:10] because Satan's up there and and he says
[1:25:12] Where Have You Been he says I've been
[1:25:13] wandering to and fro and he says well
[1:25:15] have you considered my servant job
[1:25:18] how many would would love to get to a
[1:25:21] point where God would say that about you
[1:25:25] I didn't see a single hand come up for
[1:25:28] that one
[1:25:30] but you know it takes a character
[1:25:33] a real character to get to that place
[1:25:35] where God would say that about you
[1:25:39] and so he asked him I think he goes well
[1:25:41] so here and job
[1:25:45] uh chapter 1 verse 10 and I I didn't
[1:25:47] give this but you could you could find
[1:25:49] that there brother Matt
[1:25:52] he says and just look at him but Satan
[1:25:56] answers it this way hast thou not made
[1:25:58] in hedge about him and about his house
[1:26:01] and about all that he hath on every side
[1:26:03] thou has blessed the work of his hands
[1:26:05] and his substance is increased in the
[1:26:07] land
[1:26:10] well that sounds like a child that God's
[1:26:11] taken care of doesn't it
[1:26:15] sometimes we get to complaining a little
[1:26:16] bit but God's been so good to us
[1:26:19] no question he says
[1:26:21] you know and and this is just something
[1:26:24] that I was reading this was a scripture
[1:26:26] based
[1:26:28] but that says in certain countries
[1:26:29] around the world people use a hedge to
[1:26:32] protect their homes from the wild
[1:26:33] animals or Intruders
[1:26:35] most people use a large fence nowadays
[1:26:38] and in ancient times it was the same
[1:26:41] concept a hedge repels what is outside
[1:26:43] and protects what is on inside
[1:26:46] and that's the truth
[1:26:48] we hedge ourselves by the word of God
[1:26:52] in the spiritual
[1:26:55] and and and but even more so than the
[1:26:58] word word of God is God's promise that
[1:27:00] he would abide in you
[1:27:03] he said I'll pour out my spirit upon him
[1:27:06] I'll live in them
[1:27:08] and he says
[1:27:10] and one day he says when the Lord asked
[1:27:12] Satan about his servant job Satan said
[1:27:13] of course he is perfect you have a hedge
[1:27:16] around him Satan was frustrated that God
[1:27:18] put such a strong hedge of protection
[1:27:19] around job's family wealth and personal
[1:27:22] being
[1:27:24] was it just for job
[1:27:27] no it's for every child of God
[1:27:30] as for part of the family of God God
[1:27:32] Hedges you he puts that around you
[1:27:36] but then you're a Target
[1:27:39] you know
[1:27:40] if you go and
[1:27:43] if if you go down the road intending to
[1:27:45] Rob someone
[1:27:47] because there are people that do that
[1:27:50] and you walk around and you look and you
[1:27:52] see this old beat up junky core
[1:27:56] that's barely running tires are bald
[1:27:58] half the one it's probably not the car
[1:28:01] you want to break into
[1:28:03] you probably don't have to break into
[1:28:04] somebody probably already done it a few
[1:28:05] times
[1:28:07] but the car that looks nice well kept
[1:28:09] and everything your first thought is oh
[1:28:11] there's got to be something good in
[1:28:12] there right
[1:28:13] same thing with the house
[1:28:16] so Satan is looking around he said this
[1:28:18] house is well taken care of
[1:28:20] it's hedged it's protected
[1:28:23] I want to get in there and see what it's
[1:28:25] got
[1:28:28] you wonder why sometimes you're attacked
[1:28:30] and you have the troubles you because
[1:28:32] you got something he wants
[1:28:35] greater than all the gold in the world
[1:28:38] greater than any wealth greater than any
[1:28:40] Prestige of the world you got Christ in
[1:28:43] you
[1:28:45] and he's always wanted to take him down
[1:28:50] he says of course yes perfect you have a
[1:28:52] hedge around him
[1:28:54] he says Satan was frustrated that God
[1:28:56] had put such a hedge of protection
[1:28:57] around job's family wealth and personal
[1:29:00] being God was so protecting job that
[1:29:03] Satan could not get to him God's
[1:29:04] blessings was upon job in all that his
[1:29:08] hands set to do no demon not even Satan
[1:29:11] himself could breach to protection God
[1:29:13] put around job
[1:29:17] so he went up and presented himself
[1:29:19] before God to say hey I'd like to get
[1:29:21] into him
[1:29:24] but God has confidence in his products
[1:29:29] a good salesman
[1:29:31] will let you use the product and learn a
[1:29:33] teacher learn of it yourself come to
[1:29:36] your own conclusion
[1:29:39] they won't just give you a picture and
[1:29:40] say give me the money and I'll send it
[1:29:42] to you they'll let you use it they'll
[1:29:43] let you try it they'll let you
[1:29:46] on the job site we always do that with
[1:29:48] you know you see one guy and he's using
[1:29:50] the tool and we'll ask hey how do you
[1:29:52] like that brand how do you like that
[1:29:53] I've got one I've got this brand how do
[1:29:55] you like it and we compare we've been
[1:29:57] some who have said Hey try it out for a
[1:29:59] bit
[1:30:00] brother random talks about that if he
[1:30:02] was a the salesman I believe it was that
[1:30:04] light or something like that he said I'd
[1:30:06] give it to you for a week and let you
[1:30:07] use it let you try it
[1:30:10] and then you make your decision on it
[1:30:13] you know and so so he does that with you
[1:30:16] job was a perfect and upright man
[1:30:21] but not even he had the power of the
[1:30:24] Holy the Holy Spirit like the believer
[1:30:26] today has
[1:30:29] yet he was able to stand
[1:30:33] he says if God put such a protection
[1:30:37] around job that Satan could not breach
[1:30:39] it then what will he do for you
[1:30:42] what would he do for your family
[1:30:49] if you'll give it to God
[1:30:52] and if you'll let God have preeminence
[1:30:55] and if you'll let God have first place
[1:30:58] he'll head you around
[1:31:03] and Satan has to get permission
[1:31:05] to touch you
[1:31:08] you don't put yourself outside of the
[1:31:11] Hedge and give them a free-for-all
[1:31:14] you stay behind what God has given you
[1:31:17] always
[1:31:21] ask the Lord and that I'm just reading
[1:31:24] what what this ask the Lord to lay a
[1:31:26] barrier of protection around you and
[1:31:28] your family make sure you are living the
[1:31:30] word from within just as job was doing
[1:31:33] make sure you're standing on the word
[1:31:36] when we say standing on the word not
[1:31:38] your idea but what God has said
[1:31:43] because God keeps his word
[1:31:45] it's never failing from a young man
[1:31:49] to one into his to his his dying breath
[1:31:51] God still keeps his word
[1:31:55] I I there's a testimony of a brother a
[1:31:57] fine brother I got to know and when I we
[1:32:00] met him he was a much older brother too
[1:32:02] and and and it was come to that time to
[1:32:06] get for he was at his last breath
[1:32:08] and his his wife and his daughter
[1:32:11] testified of this as he lay there in bed
[1:32:13] getting ready to cross over down to his
[1:32:16] last breath
[1:32:19] mama and and daughter were like you know
[1:32:21] talking to them said you know you
[1:32:24] haven't eaten you need to eat and and he
[1:32:26] answered this and he said I just got fed
[1:32:30] I'm not hungry
[1:32:32] and they had been watching him on the
[1:32:33] bed for three or four days and knowing
[1:32:35] he had not eaten
[1:32:36] and he said where did you get to eat and
[1:32:39] he began to call out names of those who
[1:32:41] had passed on already
[1:32:44] and he said so and so just gave me
[1:32:45] something to eat so and so just gave me
[1:32:48] some Dewey and then it dawned on Mama
[1:32:51] and daughter that Daddy was closer to
[1:32:53] that side than being on this side
[1:32:55] anymore
[1:32:58] and he and they said then they both
[1:33:02] realized this was brother Daniel
[1:33:04] Ramirez's father
[1:33:05] they said then Greek because brother
[1:33:07] Daniel had passed away already he said
[1:33:09] then greet brother Danny or my son and
[1:33:12] my brother on the other side for us
[1:33:16] and the brother crossed his legs put his
[1:33:18] arms like this breathe this last breath
[1:33:20] and crossed over
[1:33:22] oh the life of a Christian
[1:33:26] though all hella sail me I shall not be
[1:33:29] moved
[1:33:30] what a promise we have he says
[1:33:34] he will never forsake you or allow you
[1:33:36] to handle more than you can bear the
[1:33:39] Lord will place a hedge of protection
[1:33:41] around you that nothing in this world
[1:33:43] can breach
[1:33:45] Oh What A Savior oh what a God we serve
[1:33:51] Brethren I didn't brother Matt I didn't
[1:33:54] I didn't give this to you but it's
[1:33:56] from the message Hebrews chapter 4
[1:34:00] . now haven't you had a lot of
[1:34:01] Temptations don't complain about them
[1:34:04] Rejoice God is with you he is trying to
[1:34:07] prove your faith look at job in the Old
[1:34:10] Testament when he said have you
[1:34:12] considered my servant job just a man a
[1:34:16] perfect man there is none like him on
[1:34:18] the earth oh he said sure you got him
[1:34:20] hedged up doesn't have any troubles
[1:34:23] doesn't have any worries he doesn't have
[1:34:26] any Financial burdens everything is fine
[1:34:28] he don't have any sickness any pain let
[1:34:31] me have him I'll make him curse you to
[1:34:34] your face he said he's in your hands but
[1:34:37] don't you take his life
[1:34:41] he goes to the master seal and says what
[1:34:45] about this one what about this one
[1:34:47] you've got him so well protected but
[1:34:48] I'll show you that I can make them deny
[1:34:50] you
[1:34:51] and God says try it
[1:34:55] I'm I dare to say this
[1:34:57] God has more confidence in us and
[1:35:00] sometimes we have in him
[1:35:05] that's a that's a bold statement
[1:35:07] but sometimes we find ourselves in the
[1:35:09] Lord where are you where are you can you
[1:35:10] help me can you help me
[1:35:12] God says I've already met all your needs
[1:35:18] he says but don't take his life oh he
[1:35:21] done everything but take his life but he
[1:35:23] couldn't move job note he stood on the
[1:35:26] on the word that's right and all the
[1:35:28] Devils of Hell could not move him for he
[1:35:30] know that he had offered that sacrifice
[1:35:33] he was just
[1:35:38] job had met what God asked him to do lay
[1:35:41] a sacrifice
[1:35:43] every morning
[1:35:45] and I will honor it I will
[1:35:48] he says
[1:35:51] and they accused him and said you've
[1:35:52] sinned Joe and God is punishing you
[1:35:55] sometimes you're you're most worst owned
[1:35:57] accuser
[1:36:00] when you sit there and say oh Lord if if
[1:36:02] I really loved you I wouldn't act like
[1:36:03] this oh Lord if I you're your worst God
[1:36:07] said come up to me and just say I'm
[1:36:09] sorry
[1:36:10] I was wrong
[1:36:12] and he takes care of it
[1:36:14] it doesn't last for hours and hours of
[1:36:16] penance and do this and do this he does
[1:36:19] tell you to make things right and that
[1:36:20] should be part of our life
[1:36:22] being an honest and making things right
[1:36:23] but as quick as we confess he forgives
[1:36:26] he cleanses he washes
[1:36:29] he says and no matter what test or
[1:36:33] trials God brings you through he will
[1:36:35] never forsake you or allow you to handle
[1:36:37] more than you can bear
[1:36:39] the Lord will place a hedge of
[1:36:42] protection around you that nothing in
[1:36:44] this world can breach
[1:36:46] nothing in this world can breach
[1:36:52] he says and brother bam says we keep
[1:36:54] eating that oh he's done everything but
[1:36:56] take his life and he couldn't move job
[1:36:58] no he stood on the word that's right all
[1:37:00] the Devils Out of Hell could not move
[1:37:02] him for he know that he'd offered that
[1:37:04] sacrifice he was just and they accused
[1:37:07] him and said you
[1:37:08] you've sinned job and God is punishing
[1:37:10] he knew that God had that he hadn't
[1:37:13] sinned before God he knew that he was
[1:37:15] righteous based on what God Said not
[1:37:18] because he was a good man but because he
[1:37:20] was accepting the burnt offering in his
[1:37:24] dead
[1:37:27] when we begin to compare ourselves one
[1:37:30] to another
[1:37:32] and we become
[1:37:34] the measuring point
[1:37:36] we will have a lot of
[1:37:39] down times a lot of failures
[1:37:42] but it will take
[1:37:43] the perfect mark
[1:37:46] and compare ourselves to that and say
[1:37:48] Lord you said that I could be this
[1:37:52] and that you would make a way
[1:37:54] so make me more like you
[1:37:56] brother Jordan if you would come up

[1:38:47] life you will have to be that perfect
[1:38:49] sacrifice

[1:38:52] thought it over and he said not my will
[1:38:54] but thy will be done

[1:38:59] life that says not my will but thy will
