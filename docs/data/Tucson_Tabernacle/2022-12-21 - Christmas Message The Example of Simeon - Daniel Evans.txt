[29:17] and the same man was just in devout
[29:20] waiting for the consolation of Israel
[29:22] and the Holy Ghost was upon him
[29:26] and it was revealed unto him by the holy
[29:28] ghost that he should not see death
[29:30] before he had seen the Lord's Christ
[29:34] and he came by the spirit into the
[29:36] temple
[29:37] and when the parents brought in the
[29:38] Child Jesus to do for him after the
[29:41] custom of the law
[29:43] then he took then took he him up in his
[29:47] arms and blessed God and said Lord now

[29:53] according to Thy word for mine eyes have
[29:56] seen thy salvation
[29:58] which thou has prepared before the face

[31:39] tapes during all the sermons he traveled
[31:42] all over the country with him
[31:44] and um
[31:45] saw many great things I've had many many
[31:49] conversations with brother Jim
[31:51] one of the things he told me
[31:53] he told me about a testimony he was he
[31:56] was in service and back then in the 50s
[32:00] and 60s they used to have what's called
[32:02] a Waterhead baby and it's a baby that
[32:05] the Ted swells really big and and
[32:08] brother Jim told me that he was standing
[32:10] he was sitting there making the tapes
[32:11] and and there was a lady that brought
[32:13] her baby up and it had just a really big
[32:18] head it's unnaturally big
[32:21] and brother Branham said he had a
[32:25] somebody had a a cloth tape
[32:28] and they put the tape around the baby's
[32:31] head
[32:32] and it measured a certain size and he
[32:35] announced it to the crowd
[32:37] and then brother Jim said he prayed for
[32:40] the baby
[32:41] and he said now measure it
[32:44] and they put the tape around the baby's
[32:47] head
[32:47] and it was much smaller
[32:50] and then brother Bram didn't stop there
[32:53] he's he's dogged for a little bit he
[32:55] said now measure the baby again
[32:57] and they measured the baby the last time
[33:00] and his the baby's head was perfectly
[33:02] normal
[33:03] brother Jim said I was sitting right
[33:05] there I saw the baby's whole head shrink
[33:08] he was um
[33:09] bojem was is a special brother to me
[33:11] I've known him since I was born my
[33:14] family were friends with the McGuire
[33:16] family
[33:17] um brother Jim as I said he made the
[33:20] tapes and we listened to brother Branham
[33:23] in in the messages and how many times
[33:26] have you heard brother Branham listen
[33:28] and why are you listening say these
[33:29] tapes go around the world and they're
[33:31] translated how many people have heard
[33:33] them say that
[33:35] when brother Jim was making those tapes
[33:37] let me tell you how Prophet speaks
[33:40] that wasn't happening
[33:42] there were no tapes going around the
[33:44] world back then there were no tapes
[33:47] being translated back then brother
[33:50] Branham was speaking prophetically
[33:54] and that would happen much later decades
[33:57] later we'd see these messages be
[33:59] translated and sent around the world and
[34:04] brother Jim I asked him I said how many
[34:05] did he send he said he said well he said
[34:07] I remember sending a couple to Germany
[34:11] and maybe one time
[34:14] I sent a ship into South Africa
[34:17] and that was it now this message has
[34:20] circled the Earth
[34:22] of prophets speaking prophetically of
[34:24] what was going to happen like it was
[34:26] happening right then which is the way
[34:28] that most of these prophets spoke in
[34:29] this book
[34:31] so yeah brother Jim was uh he was he was
[34:34] close
[34:35] um
[34:36] man he worked to voice guide recordings
[34:38] and I sat at the break table many times
[34:41] talking with him and hearing these
[34:42] wonderful testimonies about brother
[34:44] Branham and the things that he did and
[34:47] traveling with him and the personality
[34:49] that he had
[34:51] he will be missed he was he was a good
[34:54] friend and a good man
[34:57] um
[34:57] this week in preparing for Christmas I
[35:01] thought it would be good
[35:03] to maybe talk about this Christmas Day
[35:06] this original Christmas day that
[35:07] happened and talk about this man's
[35:10] Simeon
[35:11] and you know we
[35:13] so many things there's so much conflict
[35:17] about Christmas
[35:19] especially in our ranks of people
[35:22] some people believe well it's okay to
[35:24] have a Christmas tree some people say no
[35:27] you shouldn't have a Christmas tree
[35:29] because it's idolatry some people say
[35:31] well it's okay to give gifts during
[35:35] Christmas other people say no you
[35:37] shouldn't give gifts because that's it's
[35:39] a pagan holiday and and we we go back
[35:42] and forth and and we
[35:44] we sometimes fight about these things
[35:47] and many times it just depends on where
[35:49] you go to church
[35:50] if if you're going to celebrate this
[35:53] Christmas holiday or if you're not
[35:56] and I think this man Simeon
[35:59] I think that he gave us a good example
[36:02] on how we should we should acknowledge
[36:05] the Lord's birth and how we should
[36:08] handle this Christmas Day
[36:11] this uh
[36:13] we all know that our Lord wasn't born on
[36:16] December the 25th everybody knows that
[36:18] not just us
[36:19] but pretty much everyone knows that it
[36:21] was it was sometime in the springtime
[36:24] and I see in Simeon
[36:27] simeon's greatest desire as I just read
[36:30] his greatest desire was see the Lord's
[36:33] Messiah
[36:35] he lived his life we don't know exactly
[36:37] the Bible doesn't say how old Simeon was
[36:40] it talks about how old Anna was and a
[36:43] couple verses later but it doesn't we
[36:45] don't know how old Simeon is but we know
[36:47] that he must have had a lot of age on
[36:49] him because he starts talking about his
[36:51] death and he he talked he starts talking
[36:54] about well now your servant can depart
[36:57] so it's pretty much understood that this
[36:59] man Simeon was an old man
[37:03] and uh
[37:04] we look at his example
[37:08] and the way that he celebrated didn't
[37:11] celebrate but the way that he treated
[37:13] this baby Jesus
[37:16] and that's the way that we should we
[37:19] should treat this Christmas coming up
[37:21] you know we look at
[37:24] and we're gonna you know we make
[37:25] decisions in the church we're about to
[37:27] continue on with some of the changes
[37:30] that we're making in the church and we
[37:32] could follow this man's simeon's example
[37:34] also
[37:36] I want to I want to show
[37:39] Simeon in uh
[37:43] in verse number 25.
[37:46] if you'll notice
[37:50] three times
[37:53] that the that the author Luke here says
[37:57] that Simeon was led by the holy spirit
[37:59] let me read it verse number 25 it says
[38:01] this and behold there was a man in
[38:03] Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the
[38:05] same man was Justin devout waiting for
[38:07] the consolation of Israel and the Holy
[38:09] Ghost was upon him there's one
[38:12] and it was revealed unto him by the Holy
[38:14] Ghost
[38:15] that he should not see death before he
[38:17] had seen the Lord's Christ there's two
[38:20] and he came by the spirit there's three
[38:23] into the temple and when the parents
[38:26] brought in the Child Jesus to do for him
[38:29] after the custom of the law
[38:31] so we see that this man Simeon
[38:34] he was led by the Holy Spirit
[38:37] to
[38:40] see this man Jesus
[38:43] and um
[38:47] Christmas is a awkward thing and I I
[38:49] feel it right now
[38:51] I feel even right now
[38:53] that there's strong
[38:55] feelings on Christmas
[38:59] um
[39:02] it should be about Christ
[39:04] it should be about the Lord Jesus Simeon
[39:07] was all about this this baby the Christ
[39:11] we see that
[39:13] you know we see that should we have a a
[39:16] tree should we give gifts is that about
[39:18] Jesus Christ giving the gifts is that is
[39:21] the tree about Christ is the manger
[39:23] scene about Christ when you see the star
[39:26] on top of the tree is is explained that
[39:29] this represents the Star of Bethlehem
[39:31] the the presents that are under the tree
[39:34] is that about the gifts that the wise
[39:36] men brought or is it about how much that
[39:39] we can give each other and if I got as
[39:41] much as the next guy
[39:43] that's you know so often we hear that
[39:45] well I bought this person a present it
[39:47] cost a hundred bucks and this person
[39:49] just gave me a present it was 20 bucks
[39:50] you know a cheapskate
[39:53] now welcome to the pagan holiday of
[39:56] Christmas if that's the way that we
[39:58] think about it
[40:00] Jesus said is more blessed to you are
[40:02] more blessed to give than to receive
[40:05] so you're more blessed given the hundred
[40:07] dollars than receiving the twenty
[40:09] dollars it becomes Pagan it becomes
[40:12] wrong it becomes a worldly thing this
[40:15] Christmas that's what we make it into
[40:19] but
[40:20] I'm not against Christmas but if we are
[40:23] giving gifts in the name of the Lord
[40:25] Jesus
[40:26] and we are talking about Jesus Christ
[40:29] then yes
[40:31] then move forward like this man Simeon
[40:34] did move forward in that it's all right
[40:37] but make it about Christ because if we
[40:40] don't
[40:41] then it is Pagan it is wrong
[40:45] I see you see so much fighting on
[40:47] Christmas
[40:48] you know arguing and bickering back and
[40:50] forth between families you see
[40:52] depression and people that
[40:55] that are prone to that you see often
[40:58] depression strikes the worst during the
[41:00] holidays
[41:02] because it doesn't become about Christ
[41:04] it needs to be about our lord Jesus you
[41:08] know Stephanie and I when the kids were
[41:09] growing up
[41:11] we're trying to always do our best
[41:14] did we
[41:17] is are the decorations are they right
[41:19] are they wrong sometimes a few times
[41:21] remember we put up the cross in our
[41:24] house you know we want to we want to you
[41:26] know have that we want to be like we're
[41:27] Christians we're different and
[41:31] it always we always wanted to be right
[41:33] and it's so confusing sometimes this
[41:35] Christmas way
[41:38] and then other times sometimes not
[41:40] having a tree and I keep talking about
[41:42] the tree because there's the manger
[41:44] scene and all the other things but but
[41:46] sometimes not having that makes us
[41:48] better than the people that have it
[41:50] and it's not about Christmas anymore
[41:51] either it's not about Christ anymore
[41:53] it's about exalting ourselves over
[41:56] someone else I've seen people that they
[41:58] say the the lie and they'll cheat and
[42:01] they'll they'll um
[42:03] gossip
[42:06] we don't give gifts on Christmas so
[42:08] we're better
[42:09] you know and it's not
[42:13] Christmas is about Christ
[42:17] brother Branham said this
[42:21] he said now
[42:24] my brother the only quote that I do you
[42:27] have the quote that I have there
[42:28] from presuming
[42:31] brother Bram said this he says now we
[42:33] have just passed two of the major
[42:35] holidays
[42:36] that we know here in America to be
[42:38] Christmas time in the new years it's
[42:40] actually not a Christmas it's a day that
[42:42] we set aside
[42:44] of course we realize it isn't the Lord's
[42:46] birthday he couldn't be born on December
[42:48] 25th because it's so cold up there the
[42:51] Shepherds could not have been on the
[42:53] hill and so forth and if you was ever in
[42:55] Judea along that time of year you know
[42:58] it wasn't it wasn't in the wintertime
[43:00] but it's thought that it was perhaps
[43:02] along in April or May when Lambs are
[43:05] born and like he come by all nature just
[43:08] like regular Lambs are born he was the
[43:10] Lamb of God and he was born along that
[43:13] time but I don't suppose that he cares
[43:15] what day we set aside because the day is
[43:18] actually lost but it's in commemoration
[43:20] of his birthday
[43:22] instead
[43:24] of we making it a commemoration a day of
[43:27] worship to God for his sending his son
[43:29] to us we have a celebration see we
[43:32] celebrate Christmas it's not a
[43:33] celebration you can celebrate
[43:35] Washington's birthday or Lincoln's
[43:36] birthday or some other great man's
[43:38] birthday you might celebrate it but
[43:40] Christmas should be a day of worship we
[43:43] have Twisted it around and have made it
[43:44] one of the greatest commercial days it's
[43:46] all fixed up on passing presence to one
[43:49] another and having feelings hurt if we
[43:51] don't do it and pay them back and it's
[43:53] just all twisted up
[43:55] because the world makes it about the
[43:58] commercial
[43:58] and not about Christ
[44:02] and we like I said as we as a church
[44:05] body are also making some decisions and
[44:08] we need to make those decisions not in
[44:10] what serves us the best or what we like
[44:14] the best but what does Jesus Christ
[44:17] want what serves him the best and what
[44:20] serves the body the best
[44:24] again I said three times
[44:27] Simeon
[44:30] Luke mentions the Holy Spirit when
[44:32] talking about Simeon
[44:34] now let's dig into the word Luke chapter
[44:36] 2 verse 1.
[44:40] and in preparation
[44:42] for as I said for the Christmas holidays
[44:45] as as we're thinking about
[44:48] this week and what it means
[44:51] Luke as you probably know the author of
[44:55] this never knew the Lord Jesus
[44:57] what he did is he talked with those that
[45:00] were with him it says that in Luke
[45:02] chapter 1. he talked to those that had
[45:05] an eyewitness account and he wrote these
[45:08] things down and that's where we get this
[45:11] Book of Luke
[45:14] first one and it came to pass in those
[45:18] days that there went out a decree from
[45:20] Caesar Augustus that all the world
[45:22] should be taxed and this taxing was
[45:25] first made when cyrenius was the
[45:27] governor governor of Syria
[45:29] and all went to be taxed everyone into
[45:31] his own City
[45:33] and Joseph also went up From Galilee out
[45:35] of the city of Nazareth into Judea under
[45:38] the city of David which is called
[45:40] Bethlehem because he was of the house
[45:42] and the lineage of David
[45:44] to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife
[45:46] being great with child
[45:48] and so it was that while they were there
[45:50] the days were accomplished that she
[45:53] should be delivered and she brought
[45:55] forth her firstborn son and wrapped him
[45:58] in swaddling clothes and laid him in a
[46:01] Manger because there was no room for
[46:03] them in the end
[46:05] and there were in the same country
[46:07] shepherds abiding in the fields keeping
[46:09] watch over the flock by night
[46:12] and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon
[46:14] them and the glory of the Lord Shone
[46:16] around them
[46:18] and they were so afraid and the angel
[46:20] said unto them fear not for behold I
[46:23] bring you good tidings of great joy
[46:25] which shall be to all people for under
[46:28] youth is Born This Day in the city of
[46:31] David a savior which is Christ the lord
[46:33] and this shall be a sign unto you ye
[46:36] shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling
[46:38] clothes laying in a manger and suddenly
[46:41] there was with the angel a multitude of
[46:43] heavenly hosts praising God and saying
[46:46] glory to God in the highest
[46:48] in
[46:49] in and on Earth peace good good will
[46:52] toward men
[46:53] and it came to pass as the Angels were
[46:56] gone away from them into heaven
[46:58] the Shepherds said one to another let us
[47:02] now go even unto Bethlehem and see this
[47:04] thing which has come to pass which the
[47:07] Lord hath made known unto us I would
[47:10] probably say the same thing if that
[47:12] happened to me
[47:14] and they came with haste and found Mary
[47:16] and Joseph and the Babe laying in a
[47:18] Manger
[47:19] and when they had seen it they made
[47:22] known abroad the saying which was told
[47:24] them concerning this child
[47:26] and all they that heard it wondered at
[47:29] those things which were told by them
[47:33] told them by the Shepherds
[47:35] friends right there
[47:38] is the First Time The Gospel was ever
[47:42] preached
[47:43] the Gospel of Jesus Christ was the first
[47:46] time was by these men called Shepherds
[47:51] and these Shepherds
[47:53] you notice they didn't bring gifts
[47:56] and
[47:58] I think I know probably the reason why
[48:01] is shepherds are not poor people
[48:07] shepherds are the poorest of the poor
[48:11] they don't this flock you know we talk
[48:13] about we talk about the pastor and we
[48:15] talk about how pastors their role in
[48:18] church
[48:20] that Shepherd as with the pastor he does
[48:24] not own those sheep
[48:27] that Shepherd is hired by the master
[48:32] to watch over these sheep to bring them
[48:36] into good pastures
[48:38] to to point them in the right direction
[48:42] and to have them ready for when the
[48:45] master returns
[48:47] I was I was in Malawi which is in a
[48:50] country in East Africa
[48:53] my brother Adam and I were doing a doing
[48:58] a project there and we were way back
[49:02] in the mountains of Malawi way back in
[49:06] there and it's it's a land kind of like
[49:07] the desert here
[49:09] um with some scrub trees a lot of
[49:12] stickers on everything and and real
[49:14] Rocky uh it's different than here
[49:16] because they over graze everything and
[49:19] the um the fires will come through and
[49:21] only the trees Will Survive
[49:24] so it's real it's really a rocky harsh
[49:27] area
[49:28] and we were as I said we were way back
[49:32] in there it was hot
[49:34] and
[49:36] we looked up and here comes this herd of
[49:38] goats
[49:40] coming through
[49:42] and hurting these goats
[49:46] was was this man obviously he was black
[49:49] he was African
[49:51] and he had just a pair of ragged like
[49:55] shorts I guess you could call them if if
[49:58] I don't I don't know if they were just
[49:59] pants that had fallen apart or or what
[50:02] they were but there's shorts and then
[50:04] this ragged old shirt and he had a staff
[50:07] in his hand
[50:09] and he had one rubber boot
[50:13] on his left foot you know those cheap
[50:15] rubber boots that you can find in
[50:17] Walmart the the waterproof ones just
[50:19] there's nothing to them he had one of
[50:22] those here and on the other foot is
[50:23] barefooted
[50:25] and he was walking
[50:27] with these sheep and he had the staff
[50:30] and he was he was kind of limping and he
[50:32] was looking at us he'd never seen a
[50:34] white man before
[50:36] and he was looking us at us like what is
[50:38] going on here with these people out here
[50:42] and my brother Adam he's a mountain of a
[50:46] man
[50:47] but he's got a heart even bigger than he
[50:50] is
[50:51] he couldn't handle it
[50:54] he uh
[50:55] he told Brother saeedi who was our he
[51:00] was our our guide there he he said he
[51:04] said I got to get him a pair of shoes
[51:07] he said um is there there somewhere and
[51:09] brother said he said yeah I think so he
[51:12] said
[51:13] my brother Adam said well can we can we
[51:15] go talk to him
[51:17] so said he says sure so they walk over
[51:20] there and I'm I'm not too far away
[51:23] um maybe here to you brother Kenny and
[51:26] um
[51:28] Adam walks up to him and and the man is
[51:31] looking and anxieties interpreting and
[51:34] Adam
[51:36] says it do you have a place that you can
[51:38] buy shoes
[51:41] and and he said
[51:44] he didn't really know what to say so
[51:46] well there's a there's a little village
[51:47] over there
[51:49] um that it was a couple miles away that
[51:52] I can probably get some shoes and and
[51:54] Adam asked said he said how much would
[51:56] these shoes cost
[51:58] inside you said probably 20 bucks you
[52:00] know we can we can get him a pair of
[52:02] shoes
[52:03] and I remember seeing these these
[52:05] Shepherds and seeing these people they
[52:07] don't even they're so poor they don't
[52:08] even have homes
[52:09] they will they will go into a tree and
[52:11] build a little shelter to keep
[52:13] themselves out of the Sun
[52:15] and and put some thatching over the top
[52:17] of it to to keep themselves out of the
[52:19] the rain
[52:20] at night but they are the poorest of the
[52:24] poor think about who came to Jesus here
[52:27] that I just read out of the Book of Luke
[52:29] these people are poor they have nothing
[52:33] So Adam is talking with this this man
[52:36] through the translator
[52:38] and
[52:40] he Adam talked about the the shoes
[52:44] and he started to shake
[52:48] and and Saidi
[52:50] pulled out the money
[52:52] to pay for the shoes
[52:55] and Adam told him he said he said I'll
[52:57] pay you you know you give him the Malawi
[52:59] currency and inside he pulled them
[53:01] pulled out the money to pay for the
[53:02] shoes it wasn't more it was maybe 20 or
[53:05] 30 dollars
[53:06] and and the shepherd he he started
[53:09] shaking
[53:10] and my brother got choked up he had
[53:13] never seen that much money in his life
[53:17] that Sadie pulled out this is a tiny
[53:20] amount of money
[53:22] and Adam looked at him and he saw his
[53:24] feet
[53:25] walking across these hot these hard
[53:28] rocks and and all of this and he just
[53:30] wanted to get him a pair of shoes
[53:32] and and the man he said he said why
[53:35] would you want to do this
[53:38] and Adam said you need you need this
[53:41] and he was he was shaking he didn't know
[53:44] how to do no one had ever given him
[53:46] anything I doubt anyone even knew he was
[53:48] alive
[53:50] hi Daddy had any family he was as poor
[53:53] as you can be
[53:54] out there in the middle of the desert
[53:56] hurting these sheep with nothing
[54:00] they give them they give him this money
[54:02] anxiety talks about the Lord Jesus to
[54:06] him and introduces them to it and I
[54:09] thinking about these Shepherds that were
[54:11] up on that mountain
[54:13] that that angel came down to and that's
[54:16] who God chose to go and Witness
[54:19] this new baby Jesus
[54:22] and I think how important are we I look
[54:25] at that Shepherd out there there's this
[54:28] man and I was thinking if he could just
[54:32] hear this gospel
[54:35] if he could just hear if he could just
[54:37] accept this gospel this 20 bucks to get
[54:40] him shoes
[54:41] how would he have felt if if he said you
[54:45] will inherit the earth
[54:48] nobody else may know you but God knows
[54:51] you
[54:52] these shoes they'll get you by they'll
[54:56] help you
[54:58] but this Jesus Christ will take your
[55:01] sins away
[55:03] that's Christmas
[55:05] this man this these this dudes two young
[55:09] people Joseph he was a little older and
[55:11] Mary she was young they have this baby
[55:13] and here comes these Shepherds like this
[55:16] man nothing
[55:18] they had nothing
[55:20] they were as poor as you can be
[55:23] and I I remember looking at that man and
[55:26] oh my brother just he came back and he
[55:29] couldn't hold it back
[55:31] how poor that man wasn't and when he he
[55:34] started shaking no one had ever given
[55:35] him anything
[55:37] and here comes the greatest gift that
[55:41] has ever come to the world
[55:46] God
[55:47] so loved the world
[55:49] that he gave his only begotten son
[55:53] the greatest gift this world has ever
[55:55] seen and it's it comes down here and God
[55:59] chooses the poorest of the poor the the
[56:01] we would call or the world would cause
[56:03] low lives nobody even knows them and
[56:06] they come in here and they come to that
[56:09] stable and there is the king of kings
[56:11] the Lord of lords the Everlasting father
[56:14] right there
[56:16] and I have seen with my own eyes
[56:20] a shepherd
[56:22] they are nothing
[56:24] but God chose them
[56:27] God chose the Shepherds to come
[56:30] to witness that birth that's Christmas
[56:33] and we think it's about swapping gifts
[56:36] we think it's about how much I can get
[56:39] from this or it's about some Christmas
[56:41] tree or some nativity scene or I do or I
[56:44] don't
[56:45] and it's about Jesus Christ the greatest
[56:48] gift and we lose the thought of it and
[56:53] you can see why the prophet said it's a
[56:55] pagan holiday because of what the world
[56:57] has done with it it is no longer about
[57:00] that Manger
[57:02] it is no longer about that baby that
[57:06] took away the sins of a world
[57:09] it's weak let's make it about him
[57:12] let's make it about our Lord and our
[57:15] savior
[57:16] Jesus Christ friends that Shepherd
[57:22] I I can't even explain it
[57:26] we took a picture of him I I had a lens
[57:29] on my camera and I I took it afar off
[57:32] the way he was limping
[57:35] he had nothing
[57:37] I know he didn't have a home
[57:40] I know he didn't have a family because
[57:42] they asked him he had nothing
[57:45] he followed these goats around
[57:48] for for just a meager something to eat
[57:51] and that those are the people
[57:55] that the Angels Came to
[57:58] and those are the people that preached
[58:00] the gospel for the first time
[58:03] out of the Lord is he
[58:07] does not do things like we think he
[58:10] should do things he doesn't do things
[58:12] like we expect he chooses people like
[58:15] that
[58:16] that's what Christmas is
[58:22] let's um continue on with the scriptures
[58:27] I think about that man
[58:29] it's only a few years ago I wonder if
[58:31] he's still alive
[58:34] he was so poor his hair was kind of
[58:37] bleached
[58:39] um
[58:43] I pray that something said he said
[58:47] struck him
[58:49] and he'll be a king in heaven
[58:51] he will be
[58:53] you don't have to worry he won't have to
[58:54] worry about hurting those goats anymore
[58:57] verse number 19.
[59:00] but Mary kept all these things and
[59:02] pondered them in her heart
[59:04] and the Shepherds returned glorifying
[59:06] and praising God for all the things that
[59:08] they had heard and seen
[59:10] as it was told unto them
[59:12] and when eight days were accomplished
[59:14] for the circumcising of the child his
[59:16] name was called Jesus
[59:18] which was so named of the Angel before
[59:20] he was conceived in the womb
[59:23] and when the days of her purification
[59:25] according to the law of Moses were
[59:27] accomplished
[59:28] they brought him to Jerusalem to present
[59:31] him to the Lord
[59:33] as it is written in the law of the Lord
[59:34] every male that openeth the womb Shall
[59:37] be Called holy unto the Lord
[59:39] and offer sacrifice according to that
[59:42] which was which is said in the law of
[59:44] the Lord a pair of turtle doves or two
[59:46] young pigeons
[59:48] as I read before and behold there was a
[59:51] man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon
[59:53] and the same man was just a devout
[59:56] waiting for the consolation of Israel
[59:57] and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it
[1:00:00] was revealed unto him by the holy ghost
[1:00:02] that he should not see death before he
[1:00:04] had seen the Lord's Christ and he came
[1:00:06] by the spirit into the temple when the
[1:00:08] parents brought in the Child Jesus to do
[1:00:12] for him according to the custom of the
[1:00:14] law then he took him up in his arms
[1:00:17] and bless God
[1:00:21] the most
[1:00:24] important thing
[1:00:26] that it ever struck this man's Simeon in
[1:00:30] his life
[1:00:31] and it's the same thing to you and me
[1:00:36] that is what this child Jesus means I
[1:00:39] remember Paul one time I believe it was
[1:00:41] Paul in the Bible he prayed
[1:00:44] to God and he said in the name of thy
[1:00:46] holy Child Jesus
[1:00:49] referencing our Lord
[1:00:51] and here this baby was Simeon we don't
[1:00:55] know where he came from we don't know
[1:00:58] where he went
[1:01:00] we don't know anything about him we
[1:01:02] don't know how old he was but we know
[1:01:04] that he came in there somehow
[1:01:07] the Lord had revealed to him that he was
[1:01:11] going to see this child
[1:01:13] can you imagine how he felt
[1:01:16] think about that Shepherd that I just
[1:01:19] talked about and how here's here's 20
[1:01:21] bucks
[1:01:23] shaking
[1:01:25] here's the salvation of the world
[1:01:28] imagine him holding
[1:01:31] that baby in his hand
[1:01:33] what he everything he lived his life for
[1:01:37] and here is this baby
[1:01:40] he says Lord
[1:01:42] I can depart now
[1:01:45] you told me how he knew
[1:01:47] that was
[1:01:49] the Christ have no idea
[1:01:51] but he knew it
[1:01:54] and we they brought the child to be
[1:01:57] circumcised who circumcised him
[1:02:00] I don't know neither is anybody else
[1:02:04] we know about Simeon but we don't know
[1:02:06] about the priest that dedicated it or
[1:02:08] circumcised him he didn't recognize this
[1:02:11] but this Simeon he must have remembered
[1:02:14] he must have been studying
[1:02:16] that Isaiah said that a virgin shall
[1:02:20] conceive and bear some
[1:02:22] he must have he must have known that
[1:02:24] this man was coming
[1:02:28] because there were some things happening
[1:02:31] in that day
[1:02:33] that were signs
[1:02:35] and I might get to those if
[1:02:38] if we keep going
[1:02:42] where was I verse number 28.
[1:02:45] and he took him up in his arms
[1:02:47] and he blessed God and said Lord now let
[1:02:50] us thy servant depart in peace according
[1:02:52] to Thy word for mine eyes have seen thy
[1:02:55] salvation
[1:02:58] I've searched my whole life for this
[1:03:03] I can put myself in simeon's place
[1:03:07] my whole life
[1:03:10] and still
[1:03:12] I want to see him face to face
[1:03:15] it is my life's desire if nothing else
[1:03:19] happens ever in my life if Lord if I can
[1:03:23] just see you
[1:03:26] if I could just see the Lord's Christ
[1:03:29] the one that takes away the sins of the
[1:03:31] world Lord if I can just see you
[1:03:34] fall down in a speech sister Shirley and
[1:03:37] praise him
[1:03:39] because God gave his son to us
[1:03:42] and that's what Christmas is about
[1:03:45] that's what this week is about
[1:03:51] my eyes have seen thy salvation
[1:03:55] which thou has prepared before the face
[1:03:57] of all the people
[1:03:59] a light to lighten the Gentiles and the
[1:04:03] glory of thy people is real
[1:04:05] other translations say a light for the
[1:04:08] Revelation to the Gentiles now
[1:04:12] don't just read over
[1:04:14] our scriptures
[1:04:16] when you read your Bible
[1:04:19] make sure that you're reading it all
[1:04:22] and there's some little nuggets in there
[1:04:26] that are absolutely just
[1:04:29] earth-shattering
[1:04:31] let me read that again
[1:04:33] it says here a light to lighten the
[1:04:37] Gentiles
[1:04:39] now in the Bible
[1:04:42] Gentiles were basically anything but
[1:04:44] Jews
[1:04:47] never in this book very seldom there's
[1:04:50] there's a couple
[1:04:52] um in judges but very seldom do you see
[1:04:55] a gentile mattering anyway anything in
[1:04:58] this Old Testament
[1:05:00] very very few times you don't see
[1:05:02] evangelism in the Old Testament you
[1:05:04] don't see people coming to the Lord and
[1:05:07] giving their hearts to God in the Old
[1:05:09] Testament you don't see that but look
[1:05:11] right when this Jesus is born
[1:05:15] all of a sudden the Gentiles are going
[1:05:19] to come to
[1:05:21] you can imagine why these
[1:05:23] how these priests are like what
[1:05:26] Gentiles they're filthy
[1:05:29] were God's chosen people
[1:05:33] Jesus by the grace of God was sent to
[1:05:36] you and me
[1:05:38] because brother Ed I think you you're a
[1:05:41] little bit of Jewish but but
[1:05:44] we're not
[1:05:46] but God was God sent this man to us also
[1:05:50] let me read John 3 16 one more time for
[1:05:53] God so loved the world that he gave his
[1:05:54] only begotten son
[1:05:56] that whosoever believeth in him should
[1:05:59] not perish but have everlasting life for
[1:06:03] God sent not his son into the world to
[1:06:06] condemn the world
[1:06:07] but that the world through him might be
[1:06:12] saved that's the gospel
[1:06:15] and then Jesus said go into all the
[1:06:17] world and preach the gospel tell
[1:06:19] everybody about it
[1:06:22] and Joseph verse number 33
[1:06:25] and Joseph and his mother marveled at
[1:06:27] those things which were spoken of him
[1:06:29] and Simeon blessed them and said unto
[1:06:32] Mary his mother behold this child is set
[1:06:35] for the fall and the rising again of
[1:06:37] many in Israel
[1:06:39] and for a sign which shall be spoken
[1:06:42] against
[1:06:45] this child will be the most hated man
[1:06:48] that has ever walked this Earth
[1:06:51] and he will also be the most loved man
[1:06:54] that has ever walked this Earth wherever
[1:06:56] he goes there's going to be hatred and
[1:07:00] there's going to be love even today
[1:07:03] Even in our lives today
[1:07:05] brother Jeremy at your work or wherever
[1:07:08] we are sometimes
[1:07:11] were mentioned
[1:07:12] the Lord Jesus in the right way not like
[1:07:16] the world does it's taking his name in
[1:07:18] vain
[1:07:19] but we mention the Lord Jesus and what
[1:07:22] he has done
[1:07:24] and you see hatred
[1:07:27] you see ridicule you see people making
[1:07:31] fun of it
[1:07:33] and then
[1:07:35] you see people say hey man I believe him
[1:07:37] with all my heart
[1:07:39] I'm a Christian I love the Lord Simeon
[1:07:42] said it in that day and it's carried all
[1:07:44] the way through and it'll carry all the
[1:07:45] way through to the end
[1:07:52] yay a sword shall pierce thine own soul
[1:07:56] also now Simeon remember
[1:08:01] is talking to Mary here
[1:08:04] yea a sword shall pierce through thine
[1:08:06] own soul that the thoughts of many
[1:08:08] hearts may be revealed
[1:08:10] I studied this and I I researched this
[1:08:14] this verse and I what is but then what
[1:08:18] does that mean
[1:08:19] you know as I was as I was studying it I
[1:08:21] searched for brother Branham said about
[1:08:23] it I couldn't find anything and I and I
[1:08:25] was studying through the internet and I
[1:08:28] and what I what I think in my
[1:08:32] thoughts on this this is me
[1:08:35] speaking
[1:08:37] is that this
[1:08:39] is the first prediction right where is
[1:08:42] this born this is the first prediction
[1:08:44] of Jesus's death and the pain
[1:08:48] that it's going to bring to his mother
[1:08:52] you know so often we think everything is
[1:08:54] the spiritual
[1:08:55] thing and it's it's this big prophecy
[1:08:58] but don't forget there was a little
[1:09:00] mother that was proud of her little baby
[1:09:02] there
[1:09:05] and then 33 years later
[1:09:08] Mary the one that Simeon was talking to
[1:09:11] would see her son spread out on the
[1:09:13] cross
[1:09:14] and imagine her sadness
[1:09:18] but maybe she thought way back to the
[1:09:21] prophecy that this man sent me had given
[1:09:24] a sword shall pierce your own soul also
[1:09:28] imagine if it was our child
[1:09:33] you know I I think about Simeon
[1:09:36] and I think about this baby that was
[1:09:39] born
[1:09:40] and these Shepherds that came and they
[1:09:44] they were they they had just talked
[1:09:46] these angels and they're there and
[1:09:49] they're looking at this baby
[1:09:52] Mary's proud of it Joseph they they know
[1:09:55] that this is something that has come
[1:09:58] that's very special it's the Messiah of
[1:10:00] God but I don't think they didn't see
[1:10:03] Jesus in his glory Simeon didn't
[1:10:07] and I these Shepherds probably didn't
[1:10:09] either
[1:10:10] but they didn't see this Jesus Healing
[1:10:13] The Sick
[1:10:14] they didn't see this Jesus standing
[1:10:16] against the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[1:10:18] of that day they didn't see Jesus
[1:10:21] preaching the gospel this very strange
[1:10:23] gospel saying prefer your brother over
[1:10:26] yourself
[1:10:28] saying I would rather give a hundred
[1:10:29] bucks for Christmas than receive a
[1:10:32] hundred and receive the 20.
[1:10:35] strange gospel that's Jesus's spirit and
[1:10:38] Jesus they didn't see him in his power
[1:10:41] yet Simeon knew who he was and Anna knew
[1:10:45] who he was
[1:10:46] they didn't see Revelation chapter 5.
[1:10:51] way at the end of the book in The Book
[1:10:53] of Revelation
[1:10:55] they didn't see the John the Apostle
[1:10:59] John the Revelator on the Isle of Patmos
[1:11:03] when these Seven Seals
[1:11:05] were locked up
[1:11:09] and there is right there is the book and
[1:11:13] the Book of redemption is standing right
[1:11:15] there no one no one could be saved
[1:11:18] without this opening
[1:11:20] and John is looking at it and the angel
[1:11:24] says who is worthy to open this book
[1:11:28] it was quiet
[1:11:30] no one was Worthy
[1:11:31] and it has the book there the scroll had
[1:11:34] seven seals on here inside of this
[1:11:37] everything was lost if it didn't open
[1:11:40] John looks and he must have thought it's
[1:11:43] all for naught brother Lyle it won't
[1:11:45] work
[1:11:46] I live my life I followed this man
[1:11:48] nothing it was all for naught
[1:11:52] you can see why he wept
[1:11:57] and then
[1:11:59] angel said John
[1:12:01] don't weep
[1:12:02] don't weep
[1:12:05] for the lion of the tribe of Judah has
[1:12:09] prevailed this baby that was in the
[1:12:11] manger
[1:12:12] that same one that Simeon held up
[1:12:16] this Lion of the tribe of Judah John was
[1:12:19] he must have been confused he he looked
[1:12:22] and he looked to see a lion
[1:12:24] oh
[1:12:26] it's him
[1:12:29] it's the lamb
[1:12:31] the one I knew
[1:12:33] and he was a bloody lamb sister Rachel
[1:12:36] it was Jesus Christ that same one that
[1:12:39] was in that manger and all of redemption
[1:12:42] that was just in John's mind was just
[1:12:45] lost no and here comes Jesus and he
[1:12:49] breaks the seals
[1:12:51] seven of them
[1:12:53] opens up the book brother Branham said
[1:12:56] John must have seen his name in there
[1:12:58] and he shouted and the whole Heavens
[1:13:01] hurt him
[1:13:02] that's how important this man this baby
[1:13:05] that Simeon held up
[1:13:11] by the grace of God
[1:13:13] where are we
[1:13:17] verse 36. we'll finish we'll finish the
[1:13:19] chapter and there was one Anna a
[1:13:21] prophetess a daughter of fanuel of the
[1:13:23] tribe of Asher she was of great age and
[1:13:26] had lived with a husband seven years
[1:13:28] from her virginity and she was a widow
[1:13:30] about four score and four years
[1:13:32] which departed not from the temple but
[1:13:35] served god with fastings and prayer
[1:13:37] night and day what an example to all of
[1:13:39] us
[1:13:42] and she coming in that instant gave
[1:13:45] thanks life likewise unto the Lord and
[1:13:47] spake of them to all them that looked
[1:13:49] for redemption in Jerusalem
[1:13:52] and when they had performed all things
[1:13:53] according to the law of the Lord they
[1:13:56] returned to Galilee to their own City
[1:13:58] Nazareth
[1:14:05] and here we have the story of the birth
[1:14:10] of the Lord Jesus
[1:14:13] that is the importance of this week
[1:14:17] that is the importance of this day
[1:14:20] that's coming up
[1:14:22] I know it's not his birthday
[1:14:24] I know he wasn't born on December 25th
[1:14:27] but as brother Branham said
[1:14:29] that's the day that we honor that it's
[1:14:32] in commemoration it's important it's
[1:14:36] important not to be thinking
[1:14:38] about shopping and Christmas and
[1:14:40] swapping gifts and all that those things
[1:14:42] are good
[1:14:43] I'm not against those I've always given
[1:14:45] my kids presents and and tried to do
[1:14:49] things right but if it's not about that
[1:14:52] child that Simeon dedicated that day
[1:14:56] then we're off and it becomes this pagan
[1:14:59] holiday that Rome tried to set up
[1:15:03] but I'm not going to take part in it I'm
[1:15:06] gonna make this about our lord Jesus
[1:15:09] and then gives gifts have a tree don't
[1:15:11] have a tree have a Manger don't have a
[1:15:13] Manger do you know
[1:15:14] put it and make it about Christ
[1:15:17] that's the important thing
[1:15:21] I have a I wasn't gonna go here but
[1:15:26] I like to
[1:15:28] brother Dan here's the little little
[1:15:30] extra thing
[1:15:32] I uh
[1:15:33] I like to put us
[1:15:36] in this word
[1:15:38] whenever I Minister many times I'll say
[1:15:41] this book is not a history book take
[1:15:44] yourself and place yourself in here and
[1:15:47] look around
[1:15:49] and look around and what was happening
[1:15:51] at Jesus's time
[1:15:55] God had promised to send a deliverer
[1:16:01] let's look Way Back Into the Book of
[1:16:04] Exodus
[1:16:06] and what was going on
[1:16:08] when we needed a deliverer way back then
[1:16:13] Exodus
[1:16:16] chapter 1 verse 15.
[1:16:22] and again we see right here we see God's
[1:16:25] people needed a deliverer
[1:16:27] they were in bondage things were really
[1:16:31] bad
[1:16:32] at this time I think they're worse now
[1:16:37] verse number 15 and the king of Egypt
[1:16:41] spake to the Hebrew midwives
[1:16:44] which the name of one of them was Shipra
[1:16:47] in the name of the other poor
[1:16:49] and he said when you do the office of a
[1:16:51] midwife to the Hebrew women and see them
[1:16:53] upon the stools if it be a son then ye
[1:16:56] shall kill him
[1:16:58] but if it'd be a daughter then she shall
[1:17:00] live
[1:17:01] but the midwives fear God and did not as
[1:17:03] the king of Egypt commanded them but
[1:17:05] saved the men children alive and the
[1:17:07] king of Egypt called for The Midwives
[1:17:09] and said unto them why have ye done this
[1:17:12] thing and have saved the men children
[1:17:13] alive and The Midwives said unto Pharaoh
[1:17:16] because the Hebrew women are not as the
[1:17:18] Egyptian women for they are Lively and
[1:17:21] are delivered and are delivered Heir The
[1:17:24] Midwives come in unto them
[1:17:27] they fought back
[1:17:29] basically they were Lively they were
[1:17:32] going to give up their kids
[1:17:34] therefore God dealt with the midwives
[1:17:37] and the people multiplied and waxed very
[1:17:39] mighty
[1:17:40] and it came to pass because the midwives
[1:17:42] feared God
[1:17:45] that he had made them houses
[1:17:47] and Pharaoh now listen to this and
[1:17:50] Pharaoh charged all his people saying
[1:17:52] every son that is born ye shall cast
[1:17:55] into the river and every daughter you
[1:17:57] shall save alive
[1:17:59] it probably killed thousands of children
[1:18:04] and pharaoh
[1:18:06] was afraid
[1:18:08] of losing his way of life
[1:18:12] Pharaoh was afraid of this prophecy of
[1:18:15] this deliverer Pharaoh liked having
[1:18:17] these slaves he liked having his easy
[1:18:19] life
[1:18:21] so he said just kill the babies
[1:18:24] because
[1:18:26] I don't want to change my life
[1:18:30] this goes on
[1:18:32] to Matthew chapter 2.
[1:18:37] again
[1:18:39] it was time for another deliver to
[1:18:41] deliver to come
[1:18:42] it was promised The Book of Malachi that
[1:18:46] this man would come
[1:18:48] Isaiah and other
[1:18:50] books
[1:18:53] they were in bondage again
[1:18:55] with Rome now
[1:18:58] watch the spirit of Satan in Jesus's day
[1:19:02] the spirit of Satan and Moses day now
[1:19:04] watch the spirit of Satan in Jesus's day
[1:19:09] speaking of Joseph
[1:19:11] when he arose he took the young child
[1:19:13] and his mother by night and departed
[1:19:15] into Egypt and there was until the death
[1:19:17] of Herod and and was there until the
[1:19:20] death of Herod that it might be
[1:19:22] fulfilled which was spoken of by the
[1:19:23] Lord by the prophet saying out of Egypt
[1:19:25] I've called my son
[1:19:28] then Herod when he saw that he was
[1:19:31] mocked of the wise men was exceeding
[1:19:33] Roth and sent forth and slew all the
[1:19:36] children
[1:19:37] that were in Bethlehem
[1:19:39] and in all the coasts thereof
[1:19:42] from two years old and under
[1:19:45] killing the babies
[1:19:47] so we see in Moses's time over here kill
[1:19:50] the babies
[1:19:52] kill them
[1:19:53] because it I don't want to lose my way
[1:19:55] of life
[1:19:57] and then we always see over here Herod
[1:20:00] and he's saying the same thing kill the
[1:20:01] babies
[1:20:03] because I
[1:20:04] want to have my way of life I don't want
[1:20:07] anybody to challenge the way that I do
[1:20:09] things
[1:20:12] probably killed who knows how many that
[1:20:14] killed hundreds of thousands
[1:20:16] of people of babies
[1:20:19] back then in herod's day
[1:20:24] and I look today
[1:20:28] and it is again time
[1:20:31] for a deliverer to come
[1:20:34] it's been 2 000 years since the Lord
[1:20:37] Jesus came he promised that he was
[1:20:38] coming back
[1:20:40] he promised that he would send his
[1:20:42] messenger before him like John the
[1:20:44] Baptist came before Jesus
[1:20:46] introduce Jesus
[1:20:49] he promised again according to the Book
[1:20:51] of Malachi and other
[1:20:54] prophecies that he would again send a
[1:20:57] messenger before which he did
[1:21:01] and look at the situation
[1:21:04] that was in Moses's day
[1:21:06] killing the children
[1:21:08] look at the situation
[1:21:11] that was in Jesus day
[1:21:13] killing the children
[1:21:16] and look at the situation today
[1:21:19] how many Martin Luther's how many John
[1:21:23] Wesley's how many William seymours how
[1:21:26] many oral Roberts's how many Billy
[1:21:27] Grahams have been killed
[1:21:31] in the womb before they've ever had a
[1:21:33] chance to be born
[1:21:34] in today's world
[1:21:37] Millions
[1:21:39] millions are being killed
[1:21:42] the same evil spirit
[1:21:46] here today
[1:21:49] and we expect
[1:21:52] this Messiah to come
[1:21:55] and he's coming
[1:21:57] it's that same evil satanic spirit that
[1:22:01] was back then it was there when Jesus
[1:22:03] was here and it's here now
[1:22:06] if uh brother Peter if you come and the
[1:22:09] musicians
[1:22:13] but
[1:22:16] as amram
[1:22:19] was praying to the Lord Lord we need a
[1:22:23] deliverer
[1:22:25] as
[1:22:26] Simeon was praying Lord let me see the
[1:22:32] salvation of Israel
[1:22:34] so
[1:22:36] the bride
[1:22:38] at the End of This Book
[1:22:41] and Revelation Amen brother while
[1:22:44] Revelation chapter 22. verse 17 watch
[1:22:49] the spirit of God's people
[1:22:52] he sent to deliver with Moses he sent to
[1:22:54] deliver with Simeon Here with Jesus
[1:23:00] verse
[1:23:02] 17.
[1:23:04] Revelation chapter 22 17 it says this
[1:23:06] and you all can probably quote it by
[1:23:08] heart
[1:23:09] and the spirit
[1:23:11] and the bride
[1:23:14] and the spirit and the bride say come
[1:23:19] amen
[1:23:20] crying out Lord we need you we need you
[1:23:25] in this day I think of Simeon
[1:23:29] and how he cried and he wanted to see
[1:23:32] the salvation of Israel so bad
[1:23:36] in the first Christmas was there
[1:23:39] I think about that Shepherd
[1:23:42] and it's so hard for me to even think
[1:23:44] about how how he just started shaking
[1:23:46] when he saw that money there
[1:23:49] and I think if we really knew the
[1:23:53] meaning of Christmas if we really knew
[1:23:56] how much this child Jesus meant
[1:24:01] how could we not be shaking
[1:24:04] how could we not
[1:24:07] Lord cry out Lord come
[1:24:10] Lord thank you
[1:24:12] thank you for all that you've done we've
[1:24:14] seen the signs
[1:24:17] we've seen your messenger
[1:24:20] now Lord
[1:24:22] come
[1:24:23] and on this Christmas friends as as
[1:24:26] we're going through the week
[1:24:28] now as we're preparing for things in
[1:24:30] church
[1:24:31] and we having our Christmas time with
[1:24:35] families don't forget
[1:24:39] about the Child Jesus
[1:24:41] don't forget what he meant put yourself
[1:24:45] in the shepherd's Place put yourself in
[1:24:48] simeon's place
[1:24:50] put yourself
[1:24:52] in John's Place when he looked
[1:24:55] to see a lion
[1:24:58] and it was that same one
[1:25:00] put yourself in that place and that's
[1:25:03] how important this Christmas is it's
[1:25:06] about Jesus
[1:25:08] and all the other things that separate
[1:25:11] us and divide us about the all these
[1:25:14] little doctrines and stuff they don't
[1:25:17] matter
[1:25:18] as long as we have Christ and then
[1:25:22] Christ loved us so much
[1:25:26] he wanted this fellowship with us so
[1:25:30] much
[1:25:31] that he said not only brother am I going
[1:25:35] to be with you
[1:25:36] I want to be so close to you that I am
[1:25:40] going to enter your very being
[1:25:43] and then all of these questions that we
[1:25:46] have on our hearts honey when we were
[1:25:47] putting up trying to put up a cross
[1:25:50] rather than a tree and and not giving
[1:25:53] gifts to the kids or giving gifts to the
[1:25:55] kids that Spirit that's within us it
[1:25:57] tells us
[1:25:58] it tells us what we need to do
[1:26:01] it's not it's not a book of rules it's
[1:26:04] the spirit working within us that same
[1:26:07] spirit that same spirit that Simeon came
[1:26:11] he must have just walked up and said
[1:26:15] can I hold him
[1:26:18] can can I just hold him
[1:26:20] and he gets a hold of that little baby
[1:26:26] and that's what Christmas is
[1:26:29] and he lifted him up and said Lord
[1:26:32] I can depart now
[1:26:34] my friends I want to find him
[1:26:37] one day he's blessed me so much one day
[1:26:42] I want to see him as job said in my
[1:26:44] flesh I'll see God
[1:26:47] and I want to see him so bad That's What
[1:26:50] Christmas Means to me it's such an
[1:26:52] important thing make it about Christ
[1:26:54] tell your children and I know you do I I
[1:26:59] know the Roberts is over there and I
[1:27:00] know all the all the families here if we
[1:27:02] do talk about Jesus and we should
[1:27:05] and it's about him
[1:27:08] and tell the world about him like the
[1:27:10] Shepherds did
[1:27:11] God bless you all brother Peter if you'd
[1:27:13] come and uh
[1:27:16] have a Merry Christmas and a good week
[1:27:21] we could not honor
[1:27:24] any day greater well maybe between
