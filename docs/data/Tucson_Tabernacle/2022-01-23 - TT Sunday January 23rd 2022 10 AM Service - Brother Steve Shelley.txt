and but god is still the healer he hasn't changed there neither is there a shadow of change in him so we do have some that asked us to remember them in prayer got a call that brother sam marriott is not not doing well so just remember brother sam and brother dan evans had informed me that they had not tested positive but they were not feeling well today brother lyle sister heather and um yesterday evening we went to the hospital and and brought sarah home she was in the hospital for about four days because she tested positive in the dialysis center then really could do nothing for her they would isolate her and it's much harder so took her to the hospital and she did test positive and they examined her closely the doctors still want to find something wrong with her and when it was all said and done the doctor said there's nothing wrong with your blood it's perfect and they said your your port is still working perfectly and she said i told you it was just results of the the positive test so she came home yesterday weak and tired but glad to be home so appreciate the grace of god and the good things that he done for us also the figaro family brother robert figueroa the samarano family brother jerry summer on on them uh david figaro passed away early uh yesterday morning had been quite sick in and out of the hospital and his son abraham called me yesterday just to let another day had gone on he said i got a chance to talk to him a little bit before he passed away while he was still able to speak and he said dad are you ready is everything okay and he said i'm ready and everything's okay so lord took him home and they're gonna let us know as they make a decision how they're going to do is their possibility of having a memorial service that affects again the samorano family brother robert figueroa and all them so a saint has gone home and the suffering's over but the family hurts so we'll remember them in prayer also lord willing nina and stephen will start on their way back to tucson thursday lord willing will be be home by the weekend so preach appreciate your prayers that they would be able to come say feel stand with me i know we say do you have a need and you raise your hand and we always have something that we are needful of and you say well i don't really know something i need but i know someone that has a need and i'll raise my hand in their place and then with my other hand i'll raise and say lord i believe helped out my unbelief so lord as we raise our hands and we take you at your word you said by your stripes we were healed and it's a finished work lord and i know somebody asked a question to me yesterday why does it seem like this all this stuff happens especially in our day and on all in people being sick and people falling away and lord but you're still the same yesterday today and forever and this is the greatest battle ever fought the thoughts and the questions and the wondering wise lord but we'll stand on your word we'll take you at your word and say lord i believe as noah when you told him go build an ark because it's going to rain and having never seen rain and the scientists around him had tried to disprove that they're even as evidence of rain he stood on your word and said god said so therefore i'll stand on that lord we do the same today for you're the same yesterday to ever today and forever and we thank you lord for all your goodness to us in jesus christ's name amen amen it's good to be a child of god and to know that he cares for us in the back there brother david manasi it's good to see you back home so amen it's been a while after he had gone back home for several months in there and then had to quarantine for some time but he's here with us this morning i appreciate that good to see all of you say amen so there is a river that flows from deep within in spite of all the situations something inside me says yes lord i still believe oh there is [Music] and there is a fountain that frees the soul [Music] for there is [Music] [Music] [Music] there was a thirsty woman who was drawing from [Music] her life was ruined and wasted [Music] she met the master have you met him you know him the same way today from this fountain [Music] there is a river that flows from deep weather [Music] [Applause] will come to this waters there is [Music] there came a sound [Music] it filled their hearts with singing and gave them such an anchor in the soul that all was well the prophet [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is a river that flows from deep where oh there is [Music] and come to this water there is [Music] [Music] you may be seated amen i don't know if the shelley family has a song no i just saw two heads saying no the other ones but bobby said yes do you do one of you [Applause] not that you weren't expecting that you know i remember when brother steve first came years ago a young man and i'll just share a couple of testimonies as they're getting ready i had in my heart a couple of things that i desired of the lord and as i came up to be prayed for while i was probably six seven feet away he looked at me and he said you have two things in your heart you're asking the lord for and it was two two individuals that it was in my heart that god would would reach to them and the lord called that out right then in the ear and then in the service where the shelley had walked down that center aisle praying over the folks and as he got towards the back maybe around where sister lydia is back there he began to speak in tongues looking over at a family to one side and he began to speak in tongues and all of us heard the tongues except for the husband and the wife the son-in-law and the daughter and and the sister had felt that the failure of the family was all her fault and she was just feeling really bad and as brother shelley spoke in tongues the son-in-law the daughter heard it all in english and he was telling her sister it's not been your fault it's not been and he told her without i don't think he knew either what had gone on in her life and they heard it all in english and i'll tell you this not brother shelley but jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever if you'll draw from that well he'll meet your knee today amen [Music] the blood that jesus shed for me [Music] way back on oh it's that blood that gives me strength from day to day it will never ever lose its power for it reaches to the highest [Music] [Laughter] the blood that gives me my strength from day to day it will never [Applause] lose [Music] all of my fears and it drives all my tears oh it's that blood that keeps me straight from day to day it will never lose [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Applause] that gives me my strength [Music] [Music] my tears oh it's that blood that keeps me straight from day to day it will never [Music] [Applause] to the highest mountain [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] amen how old were you when you first came through here just kind of around that age there so god can take a young man and do something in their life amen i appreciate that amen it's good to know the lord but it's better to be known of the lord because then he searches for his own he calls his own amen amen he touched me i was shackled by heavy burnt he saw the weight of sin he saw the things that would come passes about and us down he said i'll go i'll i'll go myself to set it free [Music] and is the hand of jesus touched me and now i am no longer he [Music] touched me and all the joy that fills my soul oh something [Music] [Music] me and since i met this blessed savior [Music] oh i will never cease to [Music] one more time oh he touched me [Music] [Music] and now i [Music] let's sing that last verse one more time if you can sing about it with a true revelation sing it with all your hearts [Music] i will never cease to praise him how [Music] he touched [Music] and all the joy that fills my soul something happened and now i know he touched me [Music] and that which he gives he never takes back he never said only as long as you're a good boy i'll let you have it no he's given it to you he freely gifts amen amen this morning brother steve whatever the lord puts on his heart you draw you pull you say lord you know my need you know my my desire and sometimes the ministry gets up here sets his notes down and the lord says no go this way now go that way because he'll meet your needs and he'll meet your desire so god still moves god still moves god [Music] in the hearts of this [Music] god still yes god i don't know that song very well so i want you to sing it again let me help you god still moves sing it out so that we can hear you today god do you really believe that today i believe it i believe it in the hearts of his children hallelujah hallelujah he does not sleep nor does [Music] i won't invite you to lift your hands to him and sing again your testimony god still moves sing it out to him god [Music] in the hearts of his children god still moves lord we're counting on that today he does not sleep never oh hallelujah [Music] how many of you really believe that this morning that he still moves in the hearts of his children he never slumbers he never sleeps he never goes on vacation he's always on duty all we have to do is call on him aren't you glad this morning would you reach over and get your bible i want us to go to isaiah chapter 54. we won't take a lot of time this morning for pleasantries but we will say that it is so good to be at the tucson tabernacle this morning for this moment there's no place i'd rather be on planet earth than gathered with you here and believing that god has something for us he knows we're here how many of you believe that i'm so thankful very thankful to be able to come with my entire family for harmony this year and for whatever my opinion is worth i think it was one of the greatest we've only attended five or six but the atmosphere this year was so so special i feel that lingering presence of the lord here this morning and looking at this platform it's all different the chairs are gone and the singers so many of them have gone back to their places but oh what a time we had together in the presence of the lord there's nothing like the beauty of brethren dwelling together in unity it's like that oil that ran all the way down the corners of aaron's beard and all the way down to the bottoms of his garment i'm so thankful that we can gather together in unity around the word amen so i'm glad to see all of you here i will not get the name just right i don't think is it is it mcgowan it is mcgowan for those of you that might not know maybe you know him better than i do but it's wonderful to look and see pastor mcgowan and his wife they were here for harmony and he pastors in anchorage alaska is that right no it is right anchorage alaska they're here for a few more warm days i'm assuming so nice to see them isaiah 54 17 no weapon none that is formed against thee shall prosper hallelujah and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the lord and their righteousness is what does it say of me saith the lord it's not my righteousness it's not your righteousness if we have any righteousness at all it's because we are clothed today in the righteousness of the lord jesus christ i know some of you cringe at the reading of another translation so i'm going to do it just for you this morning in the amplified version of that same verse it says but no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against you in judgment you shall show to be in the wrong but i want you to listen to this this peace righteousness security triumph over opposition is the heritage of the servants of the lord are there any servants of the lord here this morning and it says those in whom the ideal servant of the lord is reproduced i read this version because of that phrase it's those in whom the ideal servant of the lord is reproduced this is us these are his servants he is the ideal servant his character is reproduced in his little wife this is the righteousness or the vindication which they obtain from me this is that which i impart to them as their justification says the lord i like those words this morning let's bow our heads together lord we are gathered here today in your name we are just a bit slight in number many are fighting sickness and symptoms even as we struggle a little in our own throat this morning we are thinking about those who are far worse off than any of us here today they are sick some fighting for their life some with so many problems burdened so low under such heavy weight that they're not even able to be gathered with saints today and have some of that burden lifted so we lift them up to you o god we stand with them in their time of need and we ask that you will go to them even now hallelujah and touch them by the power of your might heal them deliver them break them out of oppression and depression in the name of the lord jesus christ we heard oh lord about loved ones who have just recently taken their journey from this life would you come today and comfort hearts around the world across this city who are missing their loved ones oh god we pray that the testimony that comes back to us is true and that as they're slipping out of here they settle all old accounts and they trust in your righteousness we're here today lord because we know this is a good place to be where your presence is where your word is magnified we are not so naive as to believe that our enemy has not come he has also gathered today to distract us to hinder us to afflict us but we will not look at him we will not focus on him we will look away to jesus today we will recognize that you have not changed that your power remains the same come today lord as your word goes forth and meet needs in this house in the precious name of the lord jesus christ we pray and the saints said you may be seated together this morning i once again struggled in the evening last night my heart going somewhere else in the word but the spirit of the lord pulling me back to these thoughts i've already delivered this message in this city already this time and some of you were there and so you will show me some mercy i hope because i feel like i have an assignment today to deliver this word now i don't have to worry about who it applies to because i know that god's word applies to all of us if you're not going through a battle right now you may be before you go to bed tonight and there's power enough in this word and in this message that god has given us to cause us to be able to overcome anything and everything that the enemy would throw against us in this hour i want you to know today that we are not a defeated people we are an overcoming people because greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world if we had to win this thing by ourselves we're all in trouble i don't have the strength to do it on my own but i'm so glad brother aaron we don't have to because he lives in my shoes he walks in me that's the promise when you receive the holy spirit you're receiving the very life of jesus christ doesn't matter how we feel today i want to remind you what brother adam said he said what does feelings have to do with it anyway not one little thing not an iota this morning it's not how we feel it's not what we see with our eyes it's not what things look like or sound like or smell like it's what god's word says and the god's word says no weapon none zilch that is formed against you will prosper because you are walking in the righteousness of the living god if you believe that same man so i want to ask you a question this morning how many of you have ever been told in your life that you are your greatest enemy has anybody ever looked at you and said hey you are your worst enemy let me see your hand again well that's almost all of us and i want you to know this morning i want to take this little thought don't be the weapon that is formed against your life you see sometimes the enemy doesn't have to go very far to find a weapon to form against us because we have fallen into a place of cooperation with him and we're helping him out giving him all the ammunition he needs to attack our life by the way we live by the way we think by the way we speak by the way we get caught in a rut and we get locked in a box and we don't expect very much and so we don't get very much but i want you to know we ought to be a people that constantly raise our expectation because jesus is still bigger than all of our situations there's no virus bigger than he is there's no problem no situation no heartache that's bigger than he is and i want to tell you something yes we we need to use wisdom we need to be careful we need to take care of ourselves absolutely but as that little rumble begins to go across the city i hear they're sick over there i hear that they were passing the virus along because they were all gathered together you just tell them that we came in faith believing that he's who he said he is and that's how we're able to be here today we're not cowering in fear but we're standing in faith knowing that he is able to perform what he has promised so yes use wisdom be careful if you don't feel well stay home but don't get in a place of fear so that the enemy is able to lock you in if you fear you open the door for every weapon the enemy has to throw against your life didn't brother branham come with a message that ended up in a little book about cancer don't fear it i'm telling you this dr google is making a lot of problems for the bride of jesus christ have you ever heard of dr google you're going to help me this morning oh yes we get a symptom we get a feeling we get a pain we don't know what it is so we run to dr google are we like this oh and you know what we do we come up with a list based on our symptoms of about 30 possibilities you know what they ought to put at the top of all of them old age good is wearing out that's part of what's wrong with us this old body here it was never meant to be here forever was it but there's a part of you hallelujah there's a part of you that'll never die we skip the top we skip the little things you know it could be it could be that you are sitting in a toxic environment it could be that you're putting chemicals all over your body destroying yourself it could be that we're eating hybrid food and changing the very physical form of our of our systems could be a lot of things but we skip all of that and we come down here to whoa oh i know honey i know what's wrong with me you're going to help me i'm going to keep pulling till you do i've got the big c why did you skip all the other possibilities because there's something in us that's attracted to the negative oh yes there's something in us we'd rather worry and stew and get all in a tither than to say i don't care what it is every bit of it is taken care of i'm standing on the promise of his word with his stripes i am healed i don't need a diagnosis to take god at his word whatever it is whatever it is he's the same yesterday today and forever so if dr google is producing fear in your life you need to let him go you need to trust the lord get you a physician if you want to that you can trust but don't try to self-diagnose fear is a hideous monster and it's something that should not be present in the life of a born-again believer we ought to be pulling fear down as fast as it exalts itself in our lives you don't even have to say amen because i know i'm telling you the truth this morning fear brings torment the bible said we just need a baptism in perfect love we just need to understand who it is that has loved us with such perfect love such perfection that we might begin to practice some of that with one another because in an atmosphere of perfect love oh my in an atmosphere of perfect love fear cannot exist neither can cancer neither can coronavirus neither can anything else that the enemy wants to throw against us hallelujah just a minute amen brother you know i would do that if i were sitting out there and you were up here and you said something true even if i didn't like you i'd say amen i can't help myself if i'm listening to the radio and i hear a preacher preach and i know his doctrine is so messed up i couldn't follow him but he says something that is true and there's something on the inside of me i can't help myself i just say hey man that's what brother branham said a thoroughbred will do when the word of god is spoken there's something in us that said hey that's who i am i'm not my symptoms this morning i'm not my mind battles this morning i'm a blood bought sanctified holy ghost-filled child of the living god being adopted as his son come on not walking in defeat but walking in victory you don't have to say anything but i can't help myself god has promised us victory over every one of our enemies every every one of the weapons that are formed against us including ourselves look folks it's not by chance that brother branham told us that the greatest battle ever fought would be a battle on the battlefield of the mind he wasn't talking to the church he was talking to the bride you and i are going to know if we haven't already we're going to know a mind battle a war in our mind the enemy is going to use emotions and he's going to use our will our reasonings and our affections our memories he's going to use our conscience he's going to use all of that to try to wage a war on our mind we're going to have to recognize who it is that's doing this we're going to have to make up our mind not to cooperate with him but to stand on the promise of god's word and we're going to have to consciously make the effort to pull down every thought and every imagination that exalts itself against the knowledge of jesus christ we have to diligently and consistently pull those lies down put them under our foot under the blood of jesus christ and tell the enemy you're not going to destroy me by destroying my mind hallelujah are you here the psalmist said excuse me in psalm 141 and verse 3 he said set a watch o lord before my mouth keep the door of my lips let me tell you something you're you have to watch your thoughts because your thoughts become words and your words become paradigms of words meaning that you you get in a habit of thinking a certain way and it's like a snowball it just gets bigger and bigger and bigger until fear begins to take a hold of our lives we have to recognize that it doesn't start by watching our words it starts by watching our thoughts if you want to change your life if you want to change your situation you don't just do it by changing the spoken words that come out of your mouth but you start at the origin of all spoken words and that is you go all the way back to the mind and you say let me let me just give you an example before we move on i i'm just going crazy people say i'm just losing my mind my back is killing me is it really you say we didn't come to the tabernacle this morning to hear the power of positive thinking well i tell you it could help us all a little bit and as believers it's our message and if you think brother adam didn't didn't speak about thinking and how we ought to think you better go back and do some searching because you'll find out that brother branham was at least 25 years maybe 35 years ahead of the science of epigenetics and he was preaching things about the brain and about the mind and about how the body obeys the thought process he was preaching things like that when science was still believing that you are forced to live with the brain that you're born with and brother branham was preaching under inspiration and he was telling people you can change your atmosphere by the words that come out of your mouth you're not just changing the atmosphere you're rewiring the synapses and circuits of your brain you change the very geography of your brain when you go back and begin to overwrite negative thoughts with the positive truth of god's word you're not only changing your spiritual environment and your emotional life but science says you're changing every cell in your body did you know every cell in your body listens to you it hears what you say and it perceives even what you think because you are you are joined together by a highway of nerves and of a blood system that carries even memory in your cells you are fearfully and wonderfully wondrously made we are living way below what we have been created to live in yes and one of the reasons why this word is so powerful this message is so powerful is because as things are getting darker out there and as things are eroding out there in here he's building a people with the power of his word that will not go the way of the world i want to see some of you praise the lord hallelujah we talk like we're on our last leg nobody no wonder nobody wants what we carry we're always dying come on now we don't have to be a people like that i'm not trying to make charismatics out of us i'm trying to make bible believers out of us just take god at his word somebody said but i don't feel better well i'll tell you what he said he said even if you don't feel healed just go forth i am healed i am healed i am healed i am healed i am healed he said it he said until you believe what you're saying did you know church you don't even have to believe it the first dozen times you say it you just say it because you know it's right because you know it's the word and you keep repeating that yes sir you keep repeating that and finally something in you begins to kick in there's a seed inside of you how many of you are carrying a royal seed whoa i might get excited by myself i am carrying a royal seed and when i begin to declare the truth of god's word that seed is awakened in me and it's that seed is there to join my body with my confession whoo sure we have a lot of problems but we've got a great big capable god and a lot of times we're the weapon that's been formed against our own life and if we resign if we make up our minds today i'm not going to be the weapon i'm going to refuse to put my hands to put my life in the hand of the very one who wants to destroy me can i tell you something the enemy wants to kill you and he not only wants to kill you he wants to destroy everything good about you and he wants you to live out the rest of your life on planet earth in insanity he's driving people crazy out there but the bible said great peace great peace have they which love the law of god come on now and and nothing shall offend them and he said he said i will keep those in perfect peace whose who's what whose mind is stayed on me it's not easy but it's worth it hallelujah so i want to i want to give you a few examples here because so far you're kind of looking like i'm preaching to another church but i'm preaching to us i preach to myself like this all the time and if i don't do it i have a wife and four children now i know they don't look like children but they'll always be our babies and if i if i don't practice what i preach sometimes they beat the holy ghost before he has a chance to correct me they will they'll say now dad that don't sound like what you're pre that sounds like negative thoughts to me you got to reign that in and you know i don't resent that for two reasons number one i'm like anybody else i need to be reminded and number two it lets me know they're listening faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god so i want to give you three examples this morning of how you can be the enemy you can be the weapon this is three ways that you can be the weapon formed against yourself so you want to understand this and then you want to do as brother branham said you want to move in another spirit that's a powerful teaching he gave us on moving in the opposite spirit when you sense that the enemy is trying to move in your life in a certain way you want to defeat that enemy then you just have to start moving in the opposite of what he's trying to accomplish in you anybody with me well let's give one example here being stingy the enemy would like to cause you to be selfish he'd like for all of us to be selfish and to be stingy and and protect ourselves and forget about everybody else but there's a way to overcome that devil you just make up your mind i'm going to be generous i'm going to give to the kingdom of god and i'm going to give to god's people and i'm not going to be overcome by a spirit of greed or a spirit of selfishness and you just watch what'll happen it'll be hard the first time you do it so let me encourage you always bless the household of faith those who are of the same faith as you you should certainly remember to help them in their struggles but you'll never completely break that spirit as long as you're doing for someone who can say thank you because they're still just a little bit of pride that gets in there sometime and you'd like to have someone to thank you for what you've done so you know what i have to do if i feel that thing getting on me i have to do something for a stranger i go through the drive-through sometime and i say i want to pay for the person behind me and secretly i'm kind of praying lord i hope they don't have 15 children in that van sometimes you just have to learn to do for people who can't ever pay you back who can ever even say thank you but you do it because you recognize how he has given how he has blessed how he has prospered your life now i gave that as an example because there's a way to get out from under any kind of spirit that the enemy is using against your life you discover what would be opposite of that and you start pushing back against the enemy i'll just show you come on now somebody said i don't want to be that involved with him well let me tell you something he's ever present in our life he's out for this bride and she's on to him hallelujah and we're going to quit cooperating with him as he tries to form a weapon against our lives number one here's one of the ways by holding on to stinking thinking i want you to say that stinking thinking stinking thinking if you are all the time thinking negative thoughts and engaging negative thought process and paradigms the enemy will use your own mind as a weapon to strike you down you've got to possess the reins of your mind you're the bride of jesus christ the prophet of god tells us by the scripture we're not going to get the mind of christ we have the mind of christ we have a choice to make will we continue to function out of our own mind or will we utilize the gift that has been given to the believer and that is the ability to function with the mind of christ if you're with me say amen proverbs 23 and 7 let's go there quickly for as he thinketh in his heart what's the rest so is he that's it that's it you are what you think i'm not trying to preach this like norman vincent peale i'm trying to bring this to the message of the hour i'm trying to remind you of what brother branham is i'll show you in just a moment what he has told us now that word thinketh that's a word in hebrew and it doesn't mean the kind of thought that just passes through your mind did you know your brain is so designed that you can think a new thought and if you don't ever go back and remind yourself of that thought that thought will disappear that synapsis is broken and it never moves further down into your brain to the hippocampus of the brain that thought never moves farther into the brain in fact it just leaves you like a poof now let me tell you something else that means you can hear a sermon if you don't ever go back and hear that again i don't know why you're making all those notes what are you doing that to stay awake why are you making all those notes we have people in our church i'll tell you i'm a nosy person don't leave your notebook laying around my church i'm there all week i'm there five six days a week if i see a notebook laying there i'm thinking i'm going to just see i'm just going to pick that oh brother i can't believe you do that i i know it's terrible but i've done it i've done it and some people have just about written my sermon verbatim i'm thinking oh my i could have printed my notes and give them to you and saved you the effort but here's the problem what'd they do they left it at church wasted their effort that's never going to do you any good if you don't go back and read it again when you're hearing brother branham and you're making notes there if you let some of that just pass through you and you don't ever go back and revisit a thought and dig a little bit did you know it's not just preachers that need to dig in the word hello we we've got to have that word in us to give us what we need to overcome so if you don't ever go back and revisit a new thought it's like a puff of energy it just leaves you this is not just make-believe this is scientifically but if you go back and revisit that thought and you mull over that thought and you meditate on that thought and you give that thought more than 60 seconds of attention that thought becomes a part of who you are that thought is driven farther into the deeper recesses of the brain and you can pull that thought back any time you want to now here's the problem your brain does not immediately discern whether you're having a positive thought or a negative thought how many times do we revisit negative thoughts i'm going to give you looking at you precious people you don't look like you've ever had a negative thought in your life except jordan because he's human let me give you some examples here let me find them i didn't know i'd have to prove myself give me just a moment i want to give you a few these are called ants ants automatic negative thoughts ants the reason why they become automatic is because you've revisited those thoughts so many times that they have floated down to the deeper recesses of the brain and they've become a part of the dendrites and this is so powerful because science has been able now to take pictures based on energy in your brain and they have been able to capture i don't have all that with me but they have been able to capture a negative thought in the brain it's amazing through resonance technology and it looks like brother aaron it looks like an old twisted up gnarled tree branches all entwined around one another and and very very spooky looking whereas when they're able to capture a positive thought process it looks like a healthy fruit producing tree in the brain i think that's outstanding so what we're doing is we're building a a gnarled up forest an old twisted up forest in our brain when we begin and listen you only have so much capacity you don't want to fill up your brain capacity with only things that are negative and no good this is why the bible tells us whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things of virtuous and of good report think think think on these things because if we fill up our brain with politics let me tell you something we're not of the elephant and we're not of the donkey we're of the lamb if you let that old donkey and that old elephant get in your head you won't have room to fill up your life with light and bright and holy and sacred and virtuous and valuable and precious and sacred oh my so we have to watch that now what happens is we think these negative thoughts so often that they become automatic and there are triggers you can see a person whoa we're about to get tight here you can see a person and the memory of that person it happens to me every time i come to tucson and i see old friends i can go down a journey of negative thoughts and think about things that they did to me through the years that were not so pretty and nice or i can make a choice and i can say neither of us are who we were then let me tell you something you're going to have to be like the prophet told us with your crayon and you're going to have to keep drawing people back in until finally they give up on trying to get rid of you just tell them i'm here to stay i found my tribe and i'm not going anywhere and you and i are going to have to forget what's in the past if we repent and we apologize and we go on then it's like sister minnie peterson wrote oh praise the lord it's jesus that i see the son of god revealed in you and me i thank god i'm part of the family where the people are what perfect you ever heard this song well i've heard it i'm so old that i can look over there and see them singing it i can see sister many standing there singing it with the girls don't speak evil of your brother here's the verse don't speak evil of your brother lest you speak evil of the law for we know the law is perfect without a single flaw as long as your brother's repented for the wrong that he has done then your brother is as perfect i wish you'd help me then your brother is as perfect as perfect can be oh praise the lord it's jesus that i see how many of you believe with a little bit of practice we could see jesus in one another instead of always remembering the negative of how someone mistreated you or did you wrong we must take possession of the real estate of our thoughts we must take possession of what we think i want to give you an example some examples here of automatic negative thoughts that you've never been guilty of i know i want to preface this by saying i am reading a list i refuse to let these be my thoughts these are not my thoughts i'm reading a list and i'm notifying my brain that these are not my thoughts somebody said what in the world are you doing here did you know that in your subconscious you your brain your body doesn't know whether you're joking or not so you might say something over your life that's a joke but your brain was not able to discern in the subconscious level whether you were joking or whether you meant it and so if you jokingly say i'm just stupid the cells of your body according to epigenetics and the study of the brain your your cells are not able to discern that you're just joking and you just pronounced something over every cell of your body i'm a loser i'm stupid i'm crazy i'm losing my mind i can't take anymore he or she is such an idiot i can't believe they're so stupid this is a list this is terrible this is horrible i can't stand this i should be able to handle this other people can he makes me so mad you know what the problem with that is that has a greater effect on your body than it does on the one you got angry with did you know when you speak words of anger your body goes into a hormonal storm it's true your body starts producing chemicals sometimes referred to as as fight or flight and there is a problem in today's society in today's health world there's a problem because so many people never completely reset and they live their life under the the hormonal and chemical wash of fight or flight and it's very very dangerous to every system of your body to live in that and you are signaling this kind of uh of situation in your body when you speak angry words and so we've got to watch our words and in order to do that we've got to watch our thoughts i got to read on because we're not moving fast enough i can't believe this is happening to me murphy's law does anybody know that whoo if anything can go wrong it will go wrong if anything bad is going to happen to anybody it's going to happen to me come on you ever said things like that you may have thought it was just a passing blurb or just a joke but the cells of your body didn't know that and you put your body in a hormonal storm when you spoke that over your life and i want you to know something this is part of the reason why there's such disease in the world today let me give you that statistic since you're quiet let me give you that statistic here there are three t's that are mostly responsible for disease the number one cause is thoughts scientists don't completely agree on the numbers so i'll give you the range they say from 75 to 98 of disease current mental physical emotion and behavioral illnesses today come from your thought life i tell you that's staggering the other is toxins number two and trauma number three meaning you've had some traumatic experience the death of a loved one a terrible accident these kinds of things produce disease or disease in the body and so from 2 to 25 of all disease is caused from toxins and trauma while 75 to 98 of all disease is caused from your thought life do you realize that if that's true if that's true you can change your health situation by changing your thoughts why don't we give it a try anybody willing to give it a try i'm willing to give it a try let me go back to my list just a moment i want to hurry i know my time is limited but i also know i'm we're not leaving before 12 o'clock either people can't change you ever speak something like that people can't change i'm useless i'm no good i'm bad i'm a failure i'll never get another job you will if you'll get off the couch you will if you'll do what brother sings to us every year pick up a shovel and dig another well you shouldn't speak that you should speak what god's word tells us god has a job for my life he has a job for me to be able to prepare and and provide for my family and i'm not going to let the enemy lock me in my bedroom at home lamenting because i don't have a job i'm going to ask the lord to lead me and guide me come on i'm not a good dad i'm not a good mom don't say that don't say it don't speak that your cells will follow your profession your body will obey your confession your life will follow what you think and say don't say that say by the grace of god i'm going to be a better mom i'm going to do better as a dad for my children i'm worthless let me tell you something you are not worthless you're the most valuable thing on planet earth today somebody said how could you say that because he shed his blood he shed the most precious thing that there ever has been his life's blood was shed to purchase you and if you would have been the only sinner he would have died and shed his blood for you he didn't do that to buy junk he did that to buy something of great value and now because his life is in you you're the most valuable uh walking talking living entity on planet earth don't speak that over your life i'm not a nice person the way folks are acting is as though you've never thought these things or said any of these things i'm glad i know better nobody likes me nobody will speak to me i'm not popular i'll never be good at any of any of that why does this always happen to me this is the worst thing that could have ever happened i'll never be able to learn this i'll never get better i'm not bright enough the worst always happens to me this won't work out i never get things right the problems i'm having now will go on forever and the list goes on because this is not a list that's compiled of only things sinners think and say but we are guilty sometimes of focusing on these things let me show you what brother branham said about it he gave us some powerful powerful things it's real simple just very simple in the message testimony raising the dead boy in 1953 west palm beach florida is everybody awake here's an old slogan paragraph eight here's an old slogan i want you to remember it this is brother branham do right that's your duty to god think right that's your duty to yourself and you're bound to be right he said see you'll come out right if you'll do right that's your duty to god think right that's your duty to yourself and you'll come out right so let's put that in the right order think right that's your duty to yourself do right that's your duty to god and then you'll be right because if your thoughts are right your behavior your actions will follow your thoughts and you will be pleasing god if you concentrate on god-pleasing thoughts you will focus on god-pleasing behavior come on now and then you can't lose you just simply can't lose well there's so many things here that he said there are certain people that have what we call a negativity bias and it's usually a product of their environment in their upbringing and they are those who will will say always that the cup is half empty because they just don't seem to see that water in there it's really sad they have thought that way so long they have programmed their brain and the truth is when they it's truth it's not it's not just some kind of hocus pocus the truth is they have programmed their brain so long that when they see that they see the empty first they really are not seeing this their mind focuses on the empty and they will they will call this a half empty glass you and i who practice and work hard to see things a little more positive we see the water before we see the empty we see the empty we know someone cheated us we know the waitress didn't pour a full glass but we see the the the volume that's there before we see the empty spot now you can retrain your brain thank god thank god we can retrain our brain so that we we lose our negativity bias let me give you let me give you this here just so you will will understand if someone has a negativity bias their mind is like velcro to a negative thought a negative thought comes passing through and and it's like their mind just catches that and pulls it in someone who doesn't have a negativity bias their mind is more like teflon and when that thought comes by it just slides right out they don't ever go back and revisit that again i want to tell you something that's the kind of brain i want that's the kind of mind the mind of christ is hello when when the enemy comes with all the gloom and all the glum and the doom and we don't know what we're going to do somebody said could it get any worse don't say something so so bad the possibility out there is endless but we are not focusing on out there we're keeping our hearts and minds in here your thoughts create your mood let me tell you something you know any moody people wait a minute i want to i want to slow down here does anybody know any moody people anybody sitting beside moody person we can have argument we can really i can get husbands and wives to fuss all the way to lunch you know negative people sometimes they call them negative nancy's i said oh no don't put somebody's name on there because then their nancies will hear that and they'll think that they have to be that way but it's absolutely uh the truth that you don't have to be that way at all so so negative but we are told in in brain science in epigenetics that if we purpose to think on things that are more uh virtuous and are more positive and more valuable that it makes such an important difference in our body now this is just one study men who believed their risk of suffering from cardiovascular disease was lower than average they believed it the doctor gave them statistic and they believed that they were in a subset group who were three times less likely to have cardiovascular disease those men were three times less likely to die from a heart attack or a stroke than men who believed otherwise it was a 15-year study out of the university of rochester medical center the researcher's name was robert gremling almost every cancer doctor that has been interviewed will answer this way when i have a patient that looks at a cancer diagnosis as the end it almost always is but when i have a patient who says that's tough news doc but i'm placing my my life in the hands of a greater power i trust a living god and i'm going to focus on his word come on now they don't all use spiritual language sometimes they'll say i'm a man of faith i'm a woman of faith i'm a spiritual person almost every cancer doctor that was interviewed says that person has 50 to 75 chance of defeating even stage 4 cancer one doctor said that he had had 300 patients come back from stage five half of them melanoma come on why because they chose to think about what they were thinking about you've got a greater weapon than positive thoughts what did he say it is written he used the word of god nothing is more contagious than negativity the enemy is constantly trying to disturb our peace with all of these negative thoughts but we have power we have power over that we take god at his word we pull those thoughts down and we meditate and focus on the on the truth of his word number two this is another way you can be the weapon formed against your life by carrying offense by holding on to a grudge it's absolutely time to let it go it's easy for you to say they say it's not easy for anyone to do that it takes an effort but if you could realize that you are affecting not only your spiritual life but you are affecting your mental life and your physical life by holding on to a grudge and seeking vengeance it's destroying your body from the inside out and this is not the heritage of the servants of the lord the heritage of the servants of the lord is to rise above every weapon that is formed against us and to constantly be dressed in the righteousness of jesus christ that root of bitterness will destroy you in a message the 10 virgins and the 144 thousand brother branham said in paragraph 71 he said oh not that constant burden for the lost that sweetness he said don't ever let anything rise up and put bitterness in your soul no matter how bad anyone ever treats you or anything don't never don't be guilty of letting that thing anchor in your soul listen it'll grieve the holy spirit away from you it certainly will how many of you believe it in christ is the mystery of god revealed paragraph 86 brother branham said if the brother you think he's a little wrong or is the sister say lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness spring up because it'll affect him and it'll take the christ right out of your life you see the root of bitterness that you you you show or treat someone else based on the root of bitterness it has an effect on their life but it will mess you up it'll grieve the holy spirit away help me help me it'll take christ out of your life brother branham said that poison acid of malice and jealousy and hatred that'll just take the holy spirit right away from you it will run him from the tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of god or drive it away from here it'll hurt your pastor it'll do everything see don't you do that and then he tells us how not to be that weapon he said you just wax that much closer together what an appropriate word with the storms that you have weathered these past years with all that you have been through as a body of believers the key to continuing to not only survive but thrive it's my it's my burden my desire my thoughts that god doesn't just want to keep the tucson tabernacle surviving but he wants it to thrive i know there are people who believe that we've seen our best days but they're looking at it as the world looks at things because if you're looking at the nature of god god is the very opposite of what's going on out there in the world in the world things will get bigger bigger bigger bigger bigger greater beauty wonderful and then they're gone they just start fizzling fizzling out but in god in god's kingdom in god's economy the latter it's just a moment i gotta wipe all this sweat out of my eyes the glory of the latter house was always greater than the glory of the former house it's not in the nature and character of god to let things rise and then fizzle at rapture time it would be more like god more in his divine character and and looking at where god has been helps us see where god is today and it seems to me like it would more be the mind of god and the will of god for this place to live and thrive to the glory of god silence the naysayers anybody with me silence the naysayers and shut down uh all the same ballads i might get real personal here i've been known to do that i'd like to see every sun ballad uh uh all those tobiases and all of those who who have so much to say i'd like to see their words fall to the ground i'd like to see jesus come and show himself powerfully strong in this place it's a lighthouse it's a beacon as brother branham would brother green would always say it's it's like he an icon it sits here as a testimony not of what jesus was but also what he is and there's a way to do that there's a biblical way to approach that and he gives it to us in paragraph 87 he said just wax that much closer together you've got to get closer together in spirit you've got to come closer together you can't let the enemy divide the ranks it doesn't matter if there's a hundred or three hundred or if there's fifty it doesn't matter how many what matters is if those who remain can pull together as a unified body to shut out the enemy to silence his accusation i'm preaching to you pulling us together so that we are not going to be satisfied until god performs his glorious work among us not just as survivors but as overcomers oh hallelujah you really believe it's possible yes because it says it is this word tells us but when we get in a place like we do some time we just get so negative and we even start thinking we don't need one another you need one another we need one another can i go on thank you it's not 12 o'clock you just wax that much closer together now this this paragraph means something to me he said take the buckle as the brother testified a minister here the other night about having a buckle about seeing it in a vision just that buckles on the whole armor of god let me tell you that's a reality the armor of god is a reality i want to say that again the armor of god is a reality it's a reality it's not just a figment of the imagination but we literally by spiritual obedience we can take on the armor of god brother branham said you've got to buckle that on tighten up move right up close to one another love one another anyhow aren't you glad he puts it anyhow i like that because that lets me know that he recognizes it's not always easy anyhow that means in spite of all the other everybody's not easy to love you're not easy to love whoa when you're looking in the mirror you're looking at someone who's not always easy to love we're at our best we're okay but at our worst we're not very lovable but somebody loves us anyway somebody loves us anyway so we pull up and we we look over and we love one another anyhow he said here's the key he said talk nice about one another there's some people you have to dig a little bit but you can always find something nice to say about a brother or a sister if you believe that say amen it reminds me of the of an old preacher i probably told this here before but sister west some of you know the west family they were in brother branham's meetings and brother west went home to be with the lord last year but sister west is still alive and her dad was a was an assembly of god pastor and he sponsored brother branham and macon and he was of the idea that all babies are not purdy and before you criticize him i'm in his camp because i've seen some pretty pretty ugly babies now the good thing is they usually grow out of it and i can't help it if all four of ours were amazingly beautiful i can't be responsible for that nor what happened after but when they were when they got here they were beautiful but i've seen some that weren't so pretty when they got here they've had a hard time getting here and their head looks a little crooked you know and they look like they've been beat up or something and you and and you and everybody wants the pastor to think their baby's beautiful and i really want to think that for everybody but oh my sometimes people will bring their little baby and say oh here brother shelly you want to hold the baby and i'm thinking oh my it's a good thing god can love everything i'm just kidding you can laugh it's okay this old brother stucky when someone would give him a baby so that he didn't show himself uh his real true feeling they would hand him a baby to look at he'd say oh my i've never seen another one like it you see that's not very committed is it that could mean i've never seen one so beautiful it could mean i've never seen one so ugly my point is you can always find something nice to say about one another if you dig a little deeper in the message the pergament church age this is the sermon not the book paragraph 17. brother random said try to do something good and just keep being good hold no malice no grudges don't let any bitterness no matter how bad the person is and how bad they talk about you don't never think evil in your heart against them because right there the devil will sit right in work up something right there just keep it all covered up with godly love confession making right do good to those who do evil to you does that sound like christ if you only do good to those who who do good to you why jesus said the publicans do that they do the same see the sinners anybody can be good to those that are good to them but be good to those who are not good to you do something for those that would do nothing for you speak a good word for the man that would speak evil against you and that way you keep all the bitterness out of your heart and you're always in love with everybody then as long as you stay in love number three the last these were three ways that you can be the weapon formed against your life number one stay in stink and thinking number two holding on to a grudge and allowing a root of bitterness to spring up in your life number three if you choose to walk in unforgiveness two and three they go pretty close together don't they because the only way to let go of a grudge is to forgive and we're pretty finicky about our forgiveness these days he never asked me she never asked me i want you to know nothing could be more unscriptural than that there's nowhere in the bible that it tells us to only forgive those who ask jesus is pretty straight here in mark chapter 11 and verse 25 and 26 if you've got your bible you might want to turn there and you might want to mark this highlight it or circle it or do something you might want to keep this in mind because forgiving one another is not an option verse 25 of mark 11 and when you stand pray and forgive every time you pray just make sure that you're forgiving if you have an ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses let me read it again and when you stand praying forgive if you have an ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses whether they ask you or not when you stand to pray forgive anyone that you have an ought against the next verse but if you do not forgive if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses who would have ever thought that our ability to be forgiven is directly connected to our ability to forgive this is what jesus said this is a new age doctrine this is red letter edition this is jesus speaking to us and how are we capable of doing that it's only through his grace it's only through his grace it's only by painting our mind with calvary's blood it's only by claiming the promise of god's word forgiving people in your life even those who are not sorry for their actions because if you hold on to anger it only hurts you now this is perfect faith message and i'm done so close to being finished paragraph 19 this settles it for me i could read you 100 quotes on forgiveness but this settles it for me he said now faith is based on forgiveness there it is and then as we said this morning trying to get the church into the place to where we could really see apostolic times moving among us now this was in 63 august seals have been preached and brother branham is still talking about the desire to see apostolic times moving among us wouldn't you like to have come on now don't don't don't say yes if you if you'd rather have an old dead dry religion you're entitled to that that opinion but if you're here and you'd really like to see apostolic times moving among us again now remember that doesn't just come with healing the sick and raising the dead it also comes with ananias and sapphira it's not just power we're looking for we're looking for the holy ghost to clean the church we need all of that if we're going to have apostolic times i almost felt you with me there for a moment and he says very clearly he said uh come if if we're trying to get the church into the place where we could really see apostolic times moving among us that's where we all hunger and it's just laying right at the door we see it but we want to see more of it this is august he's preached the seals in march it hasn't produced enough apostolic times that he's satisfied so he said we we have it but we'd like to have more whoa we want to see more of it we want it such a flow that it'll be a help to us and it will flow out of us to others isn't that a good word to all of us now in closing if you musicians would just cut back here for a moment when i was reading the quote there from concerning uh the the buckle christ is the mystery of god revealed paragraph 87 that's a very special paragraph to me i'll just give you this word a little background because i know the man who saw that vision of the belt buckle his name was brother gerald cleveland and he lived in anderson south carolina and i know him because he's the man who gave me the first tapes of brother branham spoken word is the original seed for those of you who remember the sister rebecca's magazine the only believe magazine you will probably remember the article about the studebaker does anybody remember reading there's one sister anybody else hold up your hand if you remember it reading the article sister yarber there the article about brother branham praying over the studebaker well you should go it you can get that online it's online the the uh magazines are there in pdf i guess you call it and you can see this experience that brother cleveland had with brother branham praying over the studebaker it was a miracle i i i know that that god can heal possums and i know that now that god can heal studebakers so he can surely take care of what's wrong with you and i and so brother brother cleveland was a dear man a dear godly man he died a few years back on our way to tucson we were we were coming out here for harmony a few years back and he slipped away we had just been with him a day or two before he was about 96 or 97. he was a survivor of pearl harbor and uh once this and and guadalcanal in the philippines he saw some real action and it changed his life forever he came back from the foreign field hungry for god he had promised god that he would serve him if he would bring him home and he got home and he got busy and he he didn't really give his heart to god like he promised and one night an old timey preacher was preaching a tent revival in anderson south carolina and brother cleveland was standing there with some army buddies along the fence outside the tent and that old church of god preacher pointed his finger and said some of you soldier boys standing there you promised god on the field whoo i can't help it i'm sorry i can't help that whoa he said you told god that if he let you come back and kiss your mama again you would serve him all the days of your life and he just came here and told me to tell you he's come here to take that promise he's come to claim what you promised him and brother cleveland was gloriously saved and baptized with the holy spirit the holy ghost and fire and not too much after that he began to hear about a prophet's ministry and he was a he was a spiritual man and he saw visions and dreams which is which is i don't know whether to say it or not i think i will it's just book of acts may there be more spiritual dreamers among us we know the word is the focus this is our preeminent here right here but we need confirmations and we need god some time to just come and help us in that way and and yes i believe in visions and i believe you can have visions and and it doesn't necessarily mean you're trying to take a prophet's place because you see visions and he saw a vision of a belt buckle and he didn't understand it and it was it was like brass but but something moved over the top of it it looked like one buckle laid on another and when that buckle was lifted that old plane brass belt buckle had been turned to gold he said i i wanted so bad to share that with brother branham he said i didn't even intend to tell him it was me that had but i wanted him to tell me something about it what it meant he got there for a wednesday night service at the tabernacle and meetings were going to begin on friday and they he asked if brother brandon would be in the service and they said they didn't think brother branham would be in the service at night but he got there brother cleveland and they asked for testimonies and he said i'm going to share this i i i'm going to tell my little experience and he stood up and told this little experience he said i had only been talking just a few minutes when the side door opened and brother branham walked in out of the study and pulled up a folding metal folding chair and put it down and sat on that metal folding chair and he said it was almost like brother branham just focused right on me he heard everything i had to say and when i got through telling that vision brother gerald cleveland said brother branham got up and walked over to the pulpit and said now i want to tell this brother something he said out there in the vestibule is a picture and it's the picture where we we describe it by saying the lilies grew how many of you know what i'm talking about we have more a sequence of pictures and in one of them it looks like the fire was on the altar on the on the flowers and what was in front and it looked like the lilies just grew in that picture well in that picture is a golden belt buckle and no one knew at that time it was there and brother branham said brother to to brother cleveland he said well when we leave here you go out there and look at that picture and you'll see that golden belt buckle there he said that is what buckles on the whole armor of god and he said we got to have that and i like to tell that story because it helps me to remember that i have a responsibility to make sure that i take on that whole armor of god and i equip myself with all that god has provided because we're too busy helping the enemy sometime form weapons against our own life we could almost put him out of business if we would start dealing with our grudges if we would start living in forgiveness instead of walking in unforgiveness and if we would take authority and control of our own thoughts we could almost shut the enemy down in our lives give him a whole lot less tools to use against us this is not going to happen to you automatically because you heard a sermon about it it's only going to happen when you take responsibility for what the enemy's trying to do in your own life if you'll do that brother sister god will give you victory over those thoughts and he'll give you the grace to replace every negative thought with a promise from god's word would you stand with me thank you for your attention this morning i'm so thankful for what god has given us the tools that he has given us to overcome in this hour and i know there are many other ways that you can become a tool that the enemy uses against you in your own life but i'm going to ask the lord to reveal that to you i'm going to ask him to make it clear to you because you've got enough to deal with without you being your own worst enemy can somebody say man greater is he greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world i will keep those in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on me great peace have they which love the law of god and nothing shall by any means offend them lord we want to forebear one another we want to forgive one another we want to buckle on that whole armor of god we want to draw closer and closer together in this wicked hour lord we want to see your glory we want to see apostolic days increase what we see you doing in a little scale we'd like to see it just sweep through this place and you just heal the sick somebody reach up and take you at your word and come in with a need and go home with it met not even a prayer line just faith reaching up to take you at your word i want you to just spend a moment with me your head bowed before the lord i want you to ask him right now and i'll agree with you that he would reveal to you any way that you're cooperating with the enemy to become a weapon formed against your own life and i want you to resign from that job today i want you to make up your mind that i'm going to help myself not hurt myself i'm going to encourage myself in the word and i'm going to pray in the spirit and be built up in the holy ghost and instead of fighting myself i'm going to let god come and have his way in my life lord i'm asking you right now across this room i feel your presence here and i know lord that this was the right word for this day and i'm asking you to quicken it to somebody's mind right now and to their heart i'm asking you to speak to them of what ways they might be cooperating with the enemy against their own life i'm asking you lord right now to give somebody a a nudge in their faith that they might be able to take you at your word and pull down those imaginations and those thoughts and those reasonings that become also negative and possess their mind in sanctification before you in the name of jesus we expose the enemy we expose him in this house today we say he's a liar and the father of all eyes you have a tormented minds long enough we take authority over that devil in the name of jesus christ we break the yokes of depression even suicidal thoughts that came to me about three times while i was speaking that someone under the sound of my voice had been dealing with that of late some of you bound by addiction and you want jesus to set you free you've got to throw wide open the door and let him come and take full possession of who you are you can't hold anything back nothing is off the table you lay it all open and bare before the one of whom we have to do and we just let him walk through every part of who we are with his healing with this deliverance with his gracious great grace and mercy i'm asking you right now lord to touch my precious brothers and sisters in this house loose them there is no reason for us to be bound you have come to make us free we surrender to the freedom of those who walk in faith lord help us to water the promise of your word with our praise hallelujah if god's been good to you would you thank him with me just a moment take him with me you've been so good jesus you've been so good lord you've provided for our needs and we want to thank you for it hallelujah now just now i feel the spirit of the lord moving so i want you just to praise him because it may be that he wants to just pass by you and touch your life let's see if that's the case we don't have to do anything spooky we can just believe that right now i felt when somebody's faith touched the lord i felt the atmosphere around me shift and that means that he's here and he might come right to your seat and touch you if you'll let him hallelujah here i am lord here i am lord [Music] hallelujah go ahead praise him go ahead and tell him you love him [Music] you tell him you tell him i can't tell him for you you tell him somebody needs to say i want that out of my life [Music] somebody needs to say today i want that out of my life and i'm coming right to the source i'm coming right to the one who can give me deliverance over that in the name of jesus you foul spirit of hell i take authority over you in the mighty name of jesus christ i command you to take your hands off of god's people this is the elect of god here we're the seed of abraham here royally by the blood of the lamb we don't have to be influenced or held in the grip of any demonic power we're free because the blood has set us free in the name of jesus lord i'm asking you right now before we leave i'm asking you to heal someone who's struggling in their nervous system there's someone here right now on on medication for anxiety and nerves i'm asking you without any fanfare without any big doe i'm just asking you to reach right down and touch them where they stand it's none of anybody's business we don't have to know it's just you're here and when you come you want to help somebody who needs help lord i'm asking you to mend a marriage that's represented in this room right now mend it as only you can put them back on the same page may they quit fighting against one another and start fighting with one another against the enemy in the name of jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah lord i thank you i thank you jesus god bless you folks we're there and thank you so much [Music] i bless your name i bless [Music] i give you pray [Music] you are the truth away [Music] i the second verse brother jordan [Music] with oh [Music] began to say [Music] and they were free [Music] i give you all is [Music] [Applause] [Music] i bless your names [Music] what about this moment right now if you should find [Music] that's where the battle is reach out and praise i dare you reach out and praise take that chance and see what god won't do for you will fall in jesus name [Music] [Applause] i bless your names [Music] i give you grace [Music] i bless your name i bless your name you made a comment there for steve that this is what the lord had for us today there was an assurance to you all of a sudden yesterday in the room we'd gotten some calls some more information these folks were sick this was happening and my wife just looked at me and she said why does it seem that we're not being healed [Music] and i had just gone through something that read where brother ram says the greatest battle ever fought and i said there was a time when the battle was a physical battle in the dark ages they gave their life they went through things that just destroyed them a literal giving of their life but he said in this day it's going to be a battle of the mind yes sir the greatest bad living he says satan chose the mind god chose the heart and we were talking about this and i said see what the battle is today having no idea what brother steve would be ministering today the battle belongs to the lord hallelujah let him have preeminence in you if there be any virtue if there's any praise think on these things [Music] you have two ways to sing the song i can i will i do believe or i can't i won't i don't believe yes which way do you want to sing it today [Music] choice is yours say lord help me today to begin to take and apply what the word of god says about me i am redeemed i am his purchased one he gave his all for me i don't have to live this way but there and i'm as guilty as anybody if not anymore it's hard to say i'm sorry it's hard to say i'm wrong oh but the peace and the deliverance that comes with it when something has been made right when it can no longer hold you its tentacles are destroyed its grip is destroyed and what used to be a struggle what used to be a pull what used to be suddenly is not there anymore because it's you've been delivered of it when you stand and pray forgive so your father will forgive you oh the blood the brother is saying about the blood the precious blood the shed blood it did everything it needed to accomplish nothing was missed you're the one that misses out when you want to accept what it'll do for you and you know what the greatest and i'm speaking to myself [Music] that i've been forgiven is when i forgive yes sir when i say lord take what i have and give it to my brother give it to my sister give it to my neighbor such as i have i give unto you in the name of the lord jesus christ something to share i'm going to say one more thing the lord reminded us when we first began to get back together after the passing away of brother green and we began to go through all these things we had heard the word schedule go around saying we had hope tucson tabernacle would fail and close got phone calls saying we told we were told you didn't exist anymore and there were people that wanted it that way not the brothers and sisters that was satan's work but he's been exposed because brother brian prayed over this place saying may this little place stay open until jesus comes and we're here today almost stand on the promise of god i'm going to stand on the promise of god where two or three are gathered in his name he'll be in our midst every promise of the god every promise in the word is mine every chapter every verse every line now i don't know how brother steve feels but it was in my heart just seeing how it would go this morning if you'll come back tonight and maybe the lord would use him in a way i know i know what he was doing there just fill that pull that pull and and you catch those things brother branham would be there ministering and he would say that spirit is calling out to that spirit for help this one is crying out for help they know they're about to be uh made open about to be destroyed and they're about they're crying out for help but the same time brother branham said one time he said the holy spirit just fell on that man right now and then he goes what if he couldn't show me the spirits are crying out for help you don't think he could show me that man just received the holy ghost he can do the same thing it hasn't changed he's the same yesterday today and forever he's a living god amen brother toby i didn't get that request for your your hand here mom all right gail your name will remember her in prayer i'm sorry i didn't see it on my phone it was forwarded to me for the toby's mom gail remember her in prayer also next saturday the memorial for sister lori tamblins and the family up in flagstaff if you're able to go the family would appreciate it i'm sure because we're all part of the family of god so let's just bow our hands for a moment lord you know yesterday [Music] as me and mom were talking and i had just read that portion about the greatest battle ever fought god chose the heart satan chose the mind and then she asked me that question why does it seem that way but you had already put something in my heart to be able to answer that question it's because we're in that age the greatest battle i ever thought is that thought process now brother steve was able to bring both sides what the scripture says and even what science has proven and as hard as science wants to disprove god all they do is show the infallibility of god that's it that's all they prove that's all they show because every knee and every tongue shall bow and confess that you are the lord jesus christ lord let us do it willingly and recognize christ in one another the very work of god and love one another lord jesus may we come with expectation when we come trusting and believing give our brother steve some rest in his body lord in his spirit in his mind lord as he would come tonight and we would draw and we would pull on you it's not brother steve it's a working of the holy spirit lord we have to believe that today lord we love you for our lord in jesus christ's name amen over and over he molds me and makes me [Music] overhand over he molds into his likeness a vessel of honor i am today all because aren't you grateful that he gives you that second chance that he works you over again that he molds you and doesn't throw the clay away [Music] a vessel of honor i am today paul [Music] brother austin are you going to be back tonight are you getting ready to leave [Music] okay well if i forget to tell greet the saints back brother ray erickson brother lawson brother nathan have come out this way before would you greet them for us tell them to keep us in prayer and we'll keep them in prayer god bless you it was good to have you with us today amen god bless you as you go he is my peace he has broken on everyone he is my peace he has broken down everyone is [Music] who has broken down everyone he is [Music] he cares for me he [Music] is my i'll cast all my cares on him for he cares for me [Music] god bless you who has broken down everyone is [Music] he has broken down everyone he is [Music] for he cares for me [Music] so [Music] so [Music] do [Music] so [Music] you
