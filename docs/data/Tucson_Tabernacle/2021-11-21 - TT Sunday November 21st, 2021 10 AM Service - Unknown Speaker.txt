everything was taken care of it's us that angel of the lord tell him if you can get the people to believe nothing will stand for and he hasn't changed that still stands so appreciate that this morning we do have some requests some needs to bring to your attention and we'll do that this this morning our sister joyce dougal called me yesterday and tuesday at 1 30 p.m she will be an outpatient at tmc and they're going to do a procedure on her back to to help maybe possibly give her some of the ability to move better around again and things so we said we would remember her in prayer and brother ed douglas sent me a text and he was out of town i was hoping to be back this weekend but maybe come back tomorrow with a job that they had and my sister kathy and we had requested prayer for her and first she wanted to say thank you for your prayers she was doing much much better but she's asking for her kidney function to to begin to work again as they were working so he's the same yesterday today and forever and then i had heard that brother roy jacoby had passed away and brother arne confirmed that brother roy and his family attended the tabernacle years ago and they've been up in the sholo area for some time now but he just recently passed away so we'll remember the jacoby family and all those effective amen if you'll stand with me you have a need a desire and he's the same yesterday today and forever nothing catches him by surprise nothing says well i've got to work on that for a bit he just says if you'll ask and you'll believe brother boeher whether craig we were with us if you would come and take these requests and then maybe take a moment to to greet the church would you thank you god bless you thank you one more request greetings this morning before we pray we just wanted to offer up one more prayer request my uh it would be my my wife's grandmother helen williams she we were coming in yesterday from connecticut and we were just minutes from her house and she had taken a fall so my mother-in-law's been with her most the night and she's at the hospital here they're checking her hip and so forth as you know she's turning 90 so she's she's very frail so i wanted to pray okay and so we're just maybe just bow our heads together as believers heavenly father we thank you from the bottom of our hearts that you are the same yesterday today and forever we thank you lord god we can't just find you in a history book but lord you you told us to prove you by your word that lord if we'd had any need and there's nothing too hard for you lord if we would look lord and believe that we shall receive what we ask for and so we gather together lord as believers lord believers in the gospel believers in the message of the hour believers lord that you are the same yesterday today and forever believers in your healing power believing in your saving power believing in your reality lord we take these requests before you as believers lord as the bible said when we believe we shall not be ashamed lord you would never fail us in those things and so lord these people i don't know them but you know them well i pray dear god for this man lord this this request that went forth with the back issue lord i pray god you restore it completely i pray lord god for those that lost their loved one lord that you'll bring comfort to the family and that you'll move upon this situation in your power in reality and god we pray lord for this kidney function that you'll restore it back to its ought to be conditioned lord i pray lord may the angel of the lord god just move upon these requests for sister helen lord you know she's aged dear god and the devil lord will just try to strike in every weakness he can find but lord you are greater and we ask god that you move upon her now and lord every unspoken request move in this congregation in your power lord touch our bodies touch our spirits lord lift up those that are weary dear god we pray that the joy of the lord will fill our hearts lord the spirit of the lord would move among us and god that you will just be made known in your power and your glory god forgive us all of our wrongs forgive us of our past and bless our future and lord may our future be bright as we walk in the light of the living father thank you for this word may it be a greater reality than it's ever been and father we just want to make you welcome we want to thank you for all that you have done for us our hearts are full and we're so grateful lord for your goodness we welcome you here be with us lord in this worship time in jesus christ mighty name amen amen all right god bless you well we're happy to be with you this morning we uh we come from connecticut where we're pastoring a small work there been there for about two years and the people love the lord they're they're pressing forward in the name of the lord and so what quite amazing god guides our footsteps and many times you don't know from one step to the next where you're going if we could have confidence in god that he is guiding our steps and renew that confidence every day and so we we realize we don't see the picture in the hole it's always looking back and i'm sure you can relate to that you can look back at your life and say he he didn't miss a beat he knew just what he was doing and you look back you say why would have i ever doubted him it's the same right now and so we experienced that uh just a few years ago god moving us into a foreign land uh their their pastor the past the church that i'm uh pastoring overcomers tabernacle lost their pastor they had turned away and went his way and the church decided to stand and and so long story short the lord had led us up that way a lot of fears and a lot of but you just trust the lord when you feel the nudge you begin to move that way and brother branham said if we pray like we should if you do get out of line you'll pull you right back in line and so we got in we got situated it took us six months to find a house and just as we got in the house coveted fell well there was no visiting preachers coming for about a year and a half and god knew all about it and so we labored away and and now it's beginning to open and clear up a little bit we're getting ministers in which is great and but this preacher was tired so we thought you know what we're going to go out to arizona and uh we're going to visit family this is where my mother-in-law is rachel shaw uh is and so we we thought we'd all come the adams family the boer family and sister rachel sister helen we come have thanksgiving and as i had told you we were just pulling in when we heard about sister helen fallen so we're waiting for the next step in the lord and we're happy to have believers to believe with and to worship with believers that are believing that it's our time to get out of here we have believed in the coming of the lord for a long time but but there's never been a day like this day and everything that we have believed has been such a time as this and now it's time to take the things that we have learned to move forward in faith and i believe that we have a body change just a route ready to break into that next dimension so it's not time to lose heart it's time to believe with everything in us hold our heads up and god will not fail us so we're just looking forward to the word of god this morning and we just i'm going to meet new friends i'm sure today but we all believe the same thing we're following the same message as the prophet of god taught us there's one church one lord one baptism one blood we're going to one kingdom and there is one faith so we are happy to be joined together with you this morning god bless you is my prayer amen amen so i've heard his name seen him in on videos but get to meet him so one of these days there'll be no more party time amen you'll have a thousand years to sit down with somebody and talk to them with no hurry you know because oh my none of this is it time to go somewhere else yet no amen we have another song special with the part of the adam's family i'm not too sure so if they'll make their way a couple announcements brother keith and sister joyce dougal 68 years married today well they're not here this morning god got a chance to talk with her for a little while shared some of her testimony and you look back and you see god in your life amen and be willing to testify of it so she was sharing some of how the lord brought them brought them out to this place in life so and on january 8th which is a saturday here at the tabernacle brother israel poe has requested to be able to use the tabernacle for youth service it's going to be singing and ministering in song and and it's he's going to give us more information but he wanted to let let you know everyone is welcome and that would be the the weekend before harmony starts which harmony will be this year from january 12th through 16th lord willing with the possibility that harmony in the desert be here right here at the tabernacle so that that's a policy we're still working on some of those things so if you'll keep that in mind in prayer and see what the lord would do with us thank you [Music] i was a rich i was lost i was blind i was running out of time [Music] left behind heaven's [Music] broke my chains freed my soul for the first time [Music] apply thank you jesus [Music] thank you jesus you have saved my life you brought me from the darkness into glorious [Music] you took my place laid inside my tomb of sin you were buried for three days but then you walked right out again now death has no sting and life has no end [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you jesus for the blood of life thank you jesus who has washed me why thank you jesus you have saved my life [Music] [Music] there is nothing stronger than the one working power of the blood [Music] through the [Music] power [Music] father through the blood [Music] thank you jesus you have saved my life [Music] you brought me from the darkness [Music] that blood that will never lose its power amen some people have wanted to do away with it let's take it out of the scriptures it's too controversial oh you take the blood away what hope do you have not at all amen i see sister roberta walking down and brother merrell good to have them back home with us i've been gone for some time here went back to to be with joe and purcell in the family and i think she had a little boy a little girl okay so amen i don't know what that's like but amen let's stand this

we'll have you administer both services he sounded like he was on vacation so brother ray erickson would come for harmony in several years did he preach for us and the last one he said brother aaron i'm on vacation so i asked him again he goes you just don't understand i'm on vacation and now i'm understanding a little more of that so so this this morning and as well we said god saw this day already and he's already known what he's going to do and how he's going to meet and who's going to be here so if you'll trust in him you say lord i surrender you know what i have need of and i'll just that way so amen self to be the glory to god be the glory to god [Music] be the glory for the things [Music] he has raised me to god [Music] for the things he one more time is brother joe comes the

lips of your servant lord i'll do my part to get out of the way and i just ask that you'll speak to the ears of the listener lord that we come lord not just because it's our religious duty but we come

glad to be in church this morning all right well i'm glad you're here because if you wasn't here i wouldn't be here if i wouldn't be here well you'd have somebody else here how about that but we greet you this morning this thanksgiving season and just found it an honor to be back with you it's been several months since we've been here and as always we appreciate the invitation and thankful that we can we know that you can have any any minister here anybody coming in and uh but we find it an honor to just be able to be able to come and speak to you this morning what god has laid upon our hearts speaking with brother andrew glover this morning he sends his greetings to you he says please greet the people so i'm doing that and also brother tim uh pruitt and the church back home brother aaron mcgear vogelsbee not in mcgary but brother aaron oglesby sends their greetings says please greet uh the church for us and i'm glad to have brother craig and his family with us sister anna and the kids and my mother-in-law who comes to hear our favorite son-in-law preach this morning you know she has a she has this tough battle you know two two son-in-laws who are preachers one who's right there in a neighborhood another one who's taken his wife and his kids far far far away yeah i'm the favorite y'all don't worry but we're glad to have all of our family here and we pray a special blessing upon sister helen i gotta touch her in a special way and i'm glad to have my wife and my kids here and wonderful job rebecca and jessica on your song enjoyed all the specials weren't they wonderful well this morning we're going to jump into the word this morning many of you you've well you know how i preach and i ask the lord just to help me slow down a little bit so it doesn't go over top of your head but not that it's going to be anything real depth but it's going to be that it's too fast or too emphatic or too emotional and to this and to that sometimes we get hung up on those things but we're just going to allow ourselves to be free this morning and i want to speak to you out of a common scripture that i believe we can see right on the back wall hebrews 13 and 8. this was the theme of brother branham's ministry and i believe if it's the theme of brother brandon's ministry then it also has to be the theme of the bride's ministry and we find here in hebrews 13 and verse 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and verse 9 and be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines i think if there's ever was a time to not be carried away with divers and strange doctrines that's today because there's so much that flows or follows this this message that we have and some of those doctrines that are going on are going around are not entwined with really what we believe and the scripture says for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace not with meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein so we just want to thank the lord this morning you can have your seats if i was to give this a a thought i want to speak to you on jesus christ the same but i want to emphasize today jesus christ the same but i want to put our focus on today and i give it a subtitle i want to say serves we are seeing jesus and brother branham was saying the message serves we would see jesus he said the bible said that he's the same yesterday today and forever he ever remains god and he is just now i want you to clue in on this he is just as great with his people when he finds believers today as he ever was so he's just as much god today as he finds those real true believers that he ever was now through any age he's as much god for you and for your need and for your situation as he ever was god and he says and i believe this word to be the bible or the bible to be the word of god just no more no less i know that god can do things that is not written in the bible because he is god but as long as i know that what i see him doing he has it written in here that he will do it then i know that i'm right and that way and he says it just keeps that much it'll be just enough for me because i see that it's in there he was wounded for my transgressions bruce for my iniquities the chastisement of my peace was upon him and with his stripes i was healed now he also says in blind baltimos and i'm just going to take my time this morning to build to build this because i don't want us to miss this because i believe so many times we as a message group or message people we're always looking back we're always looking the prophet god said you can't look back and go forward or you can't you can't drive looking back in the rearview mirror you're going to rack up so if you're going forward but yet you're looking in the rearview mirror you may hit something along the way and then you're just kind of like what happened what got in my way well you're looking the wrong direction he says he goes that's what's the trouble today we have so much of this thing that god was but he isn't now god was a healer in the 50s and the 60s but he's not so much that same god today god did this yesterday but he's not so much god today he says the bible said that he's the same yesterday today and forever just as much god today as he was then let me tell you church he's is just as much god today for your situation for your need that he ever was god he was as much god for you this morning as he was for blind bartimaeus when he come walking by and a blind man begin to scream out thou son of david have mercy on me he's as much god for you if you'll take that same approach thou son of god have mercy on me this morning have mercy on my need this morning because he's jesus christ the same today today for your need this moment this hour this minute this service today he says if he ever was god he will always be god how many of you ever hit a real low point in life some of y'all didn't show up for church didn't you we all have hit those moments where you're like man you feel like throwing in the towel let me start my clock so y'all got about 10 minutes free i'm not going to charge you for that 10. but there's times that we hit those low points sometimes we feel like giving up but he is as much god in your low points in your low moments as he is god when you're on your mountain top when you're rejoicing and everything's great and my life is wonderful and everything's just mind you it couldn't get any better but he's as much god on your mountain top as he is in your valleys and the problem of god will say if he ever was god he will always be god he cannot die he cannot get old he cannot change his mind he cannot make any new decisions on things that he's already made decisions on his first decision was right and it has to forever be right or he made the wrong decision when he made it the first time see he has to ever keep his first decision because he's perfect he's infinite and he cannot change let me ask you this morning how many you've been called by god then god can't change his mind about you this morning if god ever calls you god don't uncall you god's not like frickle man one minute you're on his his great list the next minute he's gonna check you off you know we used to have those little roses or flowers you'd say she loves me she loves me not how many have ever done that i'm reaching back right yeah some of y'all when y'all remember that oh she loves me she loves me not she loves me brother aaron she loves me i hope it finds that she loves me if that's the last pedal that's not god god doesn't operate that way god saw he was in the very thoughts of god before there ever was a star that was formed before there ever was a solar system you were in the mind of god and god saw you at your weakest and yet god saw yet your best and god called you when you didn't when you didn't have a desire to serve god god done this and god loves you this morning and he's here to tell you i'm the same today i'm the same god today as i was when you was on your mountaintop in your lowest moment i'm gonna be there for you notice the problem of god will say that's a consolation that we must have anybody seeking god must have that firm consolation that god cannot change so in the midst of your uncertainties when you're facing the most difficult trials of life when the sicknesses is threatening to take your life when you're at your lowest point and you don't see how you can keep going you've got to have that consolation that god doesn't change and not only that god doesn't change that god doesn't change his thoughts about me god called me and because you mess up or because you make a mistake god doesn't uncall you because of that god saw you making that mistake and yet god put a greater desire god's going to come by and give a conviction make that thing right and serve god keep pressing forward and that's the kind of life that we got to have we got to add that consolation that hero israel the lord thy god is one and the lord cannot change his mind his thoughts his intentions about you this morning has that bright body god has called you for a purpose so you got to have that consolation god doesn't ever change and let me just tell you god can't change god won't change and god doesn't change he called you for a purpose and nothing that you will do in this life is going to stop the purpose and plan of god do you hear me this morning nothing that you do nothing that you face no trial that you'll go through will stop the purpose and plan of god for your life let me just say it to some of you moms and dad who's got wayward children out there there's nothing can stop the purpose of god god gave you the offspring god's willing to go after the offspring because god stalls for you and for your offspring doesn't change he's still god he's god today we've got to open our eyes to see this same god we find in john 1 and verse 1 says in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god in verse 14 and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth brother brown says in the token message now satan has thrown all kind of counterfeits and shaking of hands and evidences and everything like that he says forget it the hour has arrived that the token itself not some counterfeit not some make belief not some substitutionary anything the hour is here when the token himself is identifying himself right among us notice the token the life is identifying himself right among us how does he do that how does it because we claim god sent a prophet is that god manifesting himself among us no he says and proving that he's the same yesterday today improv and he is right with the word it's got to be a plot a man that says he's got to toke him and deny this word then what about that see you can't do it the token has got to be there the blood shall be a token unto you now the holy spirit the life that was in the blood is a token unto you the holy ghost is the token the case is closed so we find the hour has arrived that the token the life of christ has got to be on display of every born again son and daughter of god not some intellectual understanding not some tattoo of what you think about it but the life of christ has got to be on display that's proven that he is the same today that's proven that he is the same today look we can't just talk about the message we just can't talk about what happened yesterday as if it's a history lesson well you know many times when i first came to the message 20 years ago or so i remember we'd have you know you have bible drills and then we have message drills and you know question and answers or bible trivia message trivia and we had all these trivias but what does that have to do with him being the same how many of those burke calls real name for some of us that's all we do we try to find every little thing in the message and try to figure out this this and this and this but yet it has no bearing on him being the same i could care less what bert calls name is but i know one thing he got changed he saw a life being displayed in front of him and that life and that little doe deer changed a man who was hard-hearted that's what i'm looking for not what his name was but what the change came because why because he's the same jesus today see we look back and we find oh we got great intellectual understandings of this message especially out here in arizona right we got sunset mountain and we got this and the prophet lived out his last years here and we got and i'm not taking anything back from that but guys church it's got to be more than what the prophet did hear me this morning it's got to be more than a prophet message it's got to be your message it's got to be your life he's got to be your god he's got to change your heart he's got to be the same for you today as it was with william branham in the 50s in the 60s he's got to be that kind of god for a people today because he is the same he didn't stop being god in a car wreck in the 1960s he's as much god today he's as a muslim today he's a healer today he's a deliverer today he's a satisfier today if you can see him in the form in which he's in notice the seals the seals have been open the word has been restored and it's high time that the people become the word of god how do we become the word the prophet of god will say you become the word as you receive the word so let us receive the word see i believe brother brown says now the perseverance he goes i believe that the virtue is in christ and christ is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us now the word itself comes back in the form notice the word itself comes back in the form of the holy spirit into us and its word in you it's word in you oh i love this see god in you oh my brother and you woke up this morning you looked in the mirror your hair was all disheveled you didn't feel like it you were aching your back's hurting this and that you didn't feel like there was anything laying inside of you we look at our frail humanity and some of us we're getting more wrinkled every day you got aches and pains you didn't know you had muscles and yet every day yeah in your frail humanity god is laying behind that and saying i'm as much god for this morning for you and for your situation but many times we're blinded or we're we're blinded by our humanity and our failures and our disappointments and our inconsistencies but yet the whole time god is laying there he's as much god and your weakness as he ever was in your strength he says now the word itself comes back in the form of the holy spirit into us it's worthy and you god and you so many wants to point back to god to some mystical something way away or some far away they overreach it god is in you god in you the hope of glory oh where should our hope be see he says now christ the mind that was in christ is in you and we look at first claw not first colossians but colossians 1 26 even the mystery or the secret which had been hid from ages and from generations but now that word now is at this very moment so don't think about this as yesterday think about this as this service this morning god preordained predetermined and and you're here for a purpose oh it's thanksgiving i just come to see the family oh no that's just the mechanism by which god used to get you here this is a preordained moment for some of you this morning see even the mystery the secret that's been hit from all the ages and from generations but this moment is being made manifest that word manifest is being made visible in his saints to whom god will make known what is the riches of his glory them of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory so we find god is going to make known or reveal the riches the wealth the fullness the abundance of his glory his magnificence his excellence his preeminence his reputation he's going to reveal he's going to reveal what the mystery the secret among who the gentiles the unworthy people otherwise an implication of pagans heathens a nation that was without god and yet god christ has anointed you to receive this mystery no longer is it god in the pages of the bible no longer is god predetermined for just a jewish nation but now it's god in you god in you god in you the hope of glory not god somewhere else not god in your neighbor not god in the preacher not god and the deacons not god in in these great men but god in you see we find many times we want to put it on brother brandon we want to put it on the prophets we want to put it on the ministries we want to put it on the deacons but the same anointing that was on jesus when he made the word manifest is the same anointing that's here this morning to make that word manifest in a bright body the same holy ghost the same anointing the same spirit it's christ among you christ in you is the hope of glory if we didn't have christ in it where would our hope be this morning and the prophet of god said i believe we can hang our soul on any word of the bible hang your soul on he's going to judge the world was he going to judge him by jesus christ this word but you know what this word is going to pass away one day this bible not the word because the bible says that his word heavens and earth will pass away but his word but the words on this bible is no more than any other book unless the words on this bible take flesh unless the words on this bible come off the pages of this bible and become a living manifested breathing article that's what he meant when he says heavens and earth are gonna pass away but my word will never pass away because my worth is eternal my people are eternal because my spirit that's upon this word which is believed in the heart and take it into the soul it becomes an eternal being it becomes a manifesting living breathing word and it can't pass away you've got zoe life eternal life you can no more die than god can die so we find that god is going to judge the world by the word otherwise he's going to judge the world by the life that you live as you manifest the word as you make this word produce what it says it'll produce he's going to judge this world by your testimony see the word may manifest is in you that's the standard and yet the enemy comes in and he assaults you but every time he comes in and assaults you god raises the standard he lifts you up to a higher realm he gives you a greater revelation of who he is so that you can have a greater dependence upon him that he'll never leave you nor will he forsake see satan wants you to point to your failures he wants you to see your faults he wants you to see your inconsistency he stands there at every turn accusing you of this and accusing you of that and pointing at your mistakes but god is there pointing you back to who you are you're not what the enemy declares you to be hear my word and as i'm as much god in you today as i ever have been god but many of us we find it hard to see that jesus would come and tabernacle my humanity well you know i got my failures that's my family they'll tell you ask any of our families they'll tell you and that's the problem sometimes we don't want to get close to the ministry because the closer you get to the ministry you realize the ministry is human and a ministry has failures too the ministers are no different than you just have a different office so we need god each and every day and we need this god coming and showing us that you're my children see god sent us a prophet for one purpose to turn your heart back to who your true identity is which is his word see turn your hearts away from your failures turn your eyes away from creeds and doctrines and dogmas and turn your heart back to jesus not jesus of 2000 years ago but jesus today because he's the same today and if he can get you to see who he is if he can get you to see where he is then you'll never have another disappointment because you realize he's not in the history book he's a living god he's as much god for me this moment as he ever was god as he walked the shores of galilee he's here walking the shores of the tabernacle john 12 and verse 20. this is where i got the thought of this message and there were certain greeks among them that came to worship at the feast and there are certain believers this morning that came to the tabernacle to worship at the feast and the same came therefore to philip which was a bethesda of galilee and they desired him saying sir we would see jesus notice there was something that was pulling these men they had heard about the miracles they had heard about the prayer lines they had heard about the supernatural they had heard about blind bartimaeus receiving a sight of mark 10. they heard about how he healed a nobleman's son in john 4. they had heard about evil spirits being cast out of a man in mark 1. they heard about the healing of the leper in matthew 8. the widow's son of name who was raised in matthew or in luke 7. they heard about jairus daughter in mark 5 and the woman who touched him of his garment they heard about the feeding of the 5000 and probably one of my most favorite scriptures in all the in all the scriptures is how he took something so little and did something so miraculous they heard about it they heard about how he walked on water in john 6 and yet they heard all these things but they wasn't satisfied with just hearing about it sirs we want to see that same god we want to see that same manifestation today oh church let that be our desire we heard about the supernatural my you can we got 1200 sermons and you can go back and if you if you're a student of this message and you listen to the end of the services and you can see i've just listened to one yesterday and how brother brandon began to pray and i think it was knocking on the door of jesus knocking on the door in 1958 at the end of the service there was a man there in the wheelchair and he says if you'll get up out of that wheelchair and push it away he says god will heal you right now and he get up out of that wheelchair and begin to push it we have heard about the supernatural but what about him today what about that same god manifesting himself the same today for your need for your situation i'm going to declare to you jesus christ is the same today he is the same today we heard about the miracles we heard about the healings we heard about the raising of the dead we heard about these things but we want to see them i thank god he sent us a prophet i thank god the supernatural was performed in our midst but i'm not looking back to a prophet i'm looking to jesus today i want to see the same signs i want to see the same wonders i want to see the same power i want to see the same manifestation and the word tells me that i can because he's the same we don't want to just hear about jesus of 2000 years ago and we don't want to just hear about jesus of 60 years ago sirs we want to see jesus today we want to meet this same jesus today we want to be changed by this same jesus today and when you meet jesus others will see him they will see that his love is the same they will see that his mercy is extended they'll see his grace being manifested they'll see the joy of the lord all over your face they'll see forgiveness whenever once we're bitterness they'll see redemption from once with shame they'll see a healer but once you laid in sickness they'll see jesus the same now notice he's the same in every detail except the corporal body he's the same now in every detail except his corporal body brother man will tell us in blind baltimos he says now and he's got to be the same in principle the same in power the same in every way only in the corporal body and he's using us oh my oh my you mean he's the same brother joe in every detail there's only one thing that's different he's using you oh well we just thought it was for the ministry we just thought it was for brother branham we just thought it was for wesley and we thought it was for martin we thought for all the churches no he said he's the same in every detail every minute detail in which he was when he walked the shores of galilee when he opened the blinded eyes when he healed the lepers when he raised the dead when he performed prayer line after prayer line after a prayer line i'm here to tell you church he's the same in every detail but now he's using your vessel now he's using us we're the only hands that jesus has we're the only think that jesus has you are the very manifestation of jesus christ today and he's saying he's not lost one ounce of power brother see jesus don't have any hands but yours and mine oh see what are we he said he is the vine we are the branches is that right the vine don't bear fruit or the branches bear fruit is that right you don't take the fruit off the vine you take it off the branch so but the energy is in the branch and it comes to the vine or through the vine it says and if it's in the tree it'll bear the same kind of fruit that the tree is so that makes jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and brother makes a statement here in god called man he says my contentions is this that jesus christ remains the same yesterday today and forever my contentions otherwise he's saying i'm laying this here this is my belief if it was the theme of his ministry then it's got to be the theme of our ministry now that jesus christ is the same he is the same not just yesterday get your eyes off of yesterday oh put your eyes on who he is today where he is today and oh let me tell you church if you could just catch that revelation man it'll make the hardest trial so much more bearable because now you realize it ain't me he's the same today he's with me today if he was with the the the disciples in their ship when they were being tossed about and they were afraid and yet they woke a master oh do you not care that we perish and he woke up and he says now thou foolish and slow a heart many times we let the winds and the waves distract us from who's in our ship you can't falter you can't fail you can't go down in defeat because jesus christ is living not just among us church he's living in you oh my what a revelation what a promise that we have as a believing group my contentions is that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and for now he says now if he is the same then he's got to be the same in every principle and power and same might and same everything that he was and i believe that this is the desire of every man and woman that ever heard of jesus they want to see him and if if he isn't the same then we cannot see him but if he is the same then we can't see him or he told something wrong he said a little while the world seeth me no more but yet you shall see me for i personal no pronoun will be with you even in you even to the end of the age and then jesus promised to be in his church notice how many is his church let me get a show of hands church i want full attendance this morning how many is his church this morning i'm the church here i am brother joe he says now notice what he says and jesus promised to be in his church doing the same things that he did then until the end of the age so he says a little while the world won't see me but you're going to see me you're going to see me because i'm going to manifest myself through your life through your ministry through your church through your family through your children i'm gonna manifest myself as the same oh hallelujah he goes oh we have to see his spirit if his spirit is in us then we will see he says if his spirit is in us and that spirit would have to do the same thing that he did then or it wouldn't be the same my brother joe we believe god but we don't believe that he still does the same things today the healing was the thing of the past miracles are past us now we're in a different age don't you know i mean come on brother joe you still holding on to those things yes i'm holding on to it because he's insane second corinthians 3 and verse 2 says you are an epistle or a letter written in the hearts known and read of all men for so much as you are manifestly declared you're manifestly it means you're making visible this word manifested declared to be an epistle or a letter of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god in the tables of not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart in verse 6 who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life now i'm going to start preaching for a minute if y'all don't mind because now we don't hit this chord about the spirit so oh my little banny rooster is going to go on loose now hey man well i got a few amens he says if he tonight if we would hunger and thirst to see the lord jesus christ we as christians believers should reflect his life so much to we would be his an entire representative what should be there we should be that every christian should be a representation and reflection of the life of jesus christ and i believe that every christian should be reflecting the life of christ he said in john 14 and verse 12 that somebody you some of us want to put this from somewhere else but he says he that believeth on me how many of you believe this morning he said he that believeth on me and the works that i do he's going to do also so take it off of the prophet take it off for the ministry take it off of the priest and put it where it belongs on the body he's the same yesterday and he's the same today church and if you believe who he is and the same things that he did you're going to do also a same word a same power a same healing a same delivery that he manifested he's being manifested in a bright body you say you got to give me proof i'm going to give you proof just stay to the end i'm going to show you who god is i'm going to show you that god is god of tucson tabernacle oh i got testimonies oh devil you've been well back up and leave because we come to have church because we're thankful this morning that he's the same today he didn't leave us in laodicea just to frolic around and a flip-flopping and topsy-turvy he came to establish some ministry and he said that the move is over for the pride i'll say let's get moving bride let's get moving brian let's get manifesting the word he says now he did everything that pleased god and he stayed with the word so if we believe who he is and we got to do the same things that he did then we got to stay with the word the word doesn't say push play though you need to be push and play the word didn't say all these other crazy doctrines that are going on around us the word declares who he is and how do you know who he is when the word is made manifest how do you know who you are when the word is made manifest notice he says that's what the world needs today is a manifestation of the holy ghost the resurrected jesus christ putting his being into power in the church oh hallelujah what a thanksgiving message that is oh we're not looking back church quinn looking back tucson tabernacle let's look to where he's at today let's look at where he's depositing himself today where is he putting that that resurrected jesus christ he's putting his being into power in the church that's where he's at today and he's the same in principle and detail and power in manifestation as he ever was god but yet he's using a frail little kid who's accepted the lord jesus as their savior and they're overcoming the laodicea he's walking through a mother who's been in home nursing a little breath fever brow baby and she laid her hands on him and said satan take your hands off of my child he's to say oh hallelujah he's a saint god today he's the same god today and you've got as much power and as much right to take god at his word and tell the devil to take his hands off of them oh yes he said that's what the world's wanting to see no matter how fundamental how your theology how you've been trained through the bible if god doesn't vindicate it it's wrong and you're wrong you got men preaching today that were no longer in the seventh age we didn't we then got into a whole another age i'm sorry brother craig but i hadn't found an eighth age brother in revelations i thought it says about seven candlesticks seven messengers seven stars where they get this number eight at see they move past the seventh age they move past the messenger and when you move past the seventh age and you get past the seventh eighth the seventh messenger where do you take the people you take the people to the mind of man his own intellect and then you're no more than a denomination but he says now if god doesn't vindicate it it's wrong and you're wrong so all these pet doctrines all these pet creeds all these oh they seem so intelligent we make this message so difficult sometimes man we want to cut and slice and dice and make it wow let me tell you what wow is i'll tell you what wow it's right here when i'm looking at jesus christ the same wow wow jesus christ right there the same jesus christ right there that's wild oh i don't care how you can slice this message and put this quote together put this scripture together you can you can blow somebody's mind look i'm not looking for a lecturer i'm not looking for a jokester behind the pulpit what i'm looking for brother is for somebody to manifest this word to make this work do what he says it'll do i don't need your intellect i don't need your theology all i need is the power of god to manifest himself the same today when my kids are sick i got a promise i can lay hands on them and they'll be made well i got a promise when i go into a church and if i can get the people to believe nothing will stand before their prayer not even cancer you say that was only for a prophet no sir the prophet was just showing it was for anybody that would believe he was the wave sheep waving over the people telling him there's more to come watch out devil i got more believers that are coming they're going to believe brother they're going to believe the same word they're going to read the same message oh hallelujah we got as much right to that promise but if god doesn't vindicate it then it's wrong and you're wrong can i keep going see many people just take the letter now this is not brother jose brother brandon just so you want it putting on the whole arm of god 1962. i know some of us you got to show me in the scriptures you got to show me show me the message that's fine i'm not preaching anything of my own but he says many people just taken the letter the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life they take these creeds and so forth still killeth and when you're taking the spirit notice what he says that's god himself when you take this but brother joe i don't want to act fanatical well i'm too late you didn't have to amend that some of us we we get so caught up in our human well if i if the spirit makes you do that i'm going to have nothing to do with it the letter killeth but the spirit notice he said the spirit is god himself how do you know it's god because he's taken the word and manifesting it see then it's god himself oh my spoken word he says notice i love what he says and the spirit gives the word life the letter killeth but the spirit gives life well brother joe you just grew up pentecostal no because i didn't grow up in church didn't get saved until i was 22. didn't have no preacher lead me to the lord but a voice came in my car about midnight said turn your car around let me tell you i can't go back to that same night as far as putting it on a date on a calendar but i never forget what god done for me that night that wasn't a letter that walked in and just flew down out of the sky i landed on my drive my steering wheel said turn your car around it was a voice it was a spirit because my time was coming from my opportunity to receive the word and paul would tell us for the gospel for our gospel came not into word only not in doctrine and teaching only but in power otherwise power to do mighty works see and in the holy ghost and much assurance as you know what man or men we are to be so we find the scripture no matter how well you know them if the spirit doesn't quicken them then the letter killeth the spirit gives life it must be quickened or made alive by the spirit if the spirit doesn't lie on the word and make it a reality to you then the letter is just intellectual oh my i like this kind of preaching and just intellectual faith won't work you're not in fellowship yet the prophet would say well i know he did this and i can quote you this you know we got these cherry pick quotes don't we jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever yeah yeah yeah but what does that really mean how many ever pondered on jesus christ being a saint it's not a cliche it's not a cherry-picked scripture it's not just the theme of brother brandon's ministry it was his life because it wasn't him it was christ manifesting through him and it's got to be the same for us church look i love this word but there's got to be something behind this word to make it live there's got to be a power there's got to be a spirit there's got to be an anointing to make this word live and i'm looking because god came in this generation he could have came in any generation but yet he came in your generation in this hour to do what to anoint this word to make this world live out in tucson in connecticut in louisiana all over the world he's making this word live see it's just a little intellectual faith he says and it won't work you're not in fellowship yet you have intellectual faith you'll argue every scripture you'll do everything you can backwards and everything else you'll say that there's no such thing as divine healing there's no such thing as heartfelt religion there's no such thing as a holy ghost you'll fuss and stew all the time and know not what you're talking about how can we believe when there's nothing in there to believe see the problem of the day and i'm just going to go ahead and say it there's too much intellectual preaching men feeling called heard what i said men feeling called but not truly being called and those that are feeling call oh yeah i mean we got great intellectual giants today we got men who are chemistry majors and accountants and i mean lawyers we got all kinds and yet we can simply i remember when i first before i started preaching you know i thought i was a theologian let me humble myself for a minute me and a friend of mine when i was in college this is when i first got saved we go to church baptist church because i didn't know anything about the message we'll go to the baptist church and we'll critique every detail like i went to bible school or something you know i thought i was somebody brother i wasn't nobody but i thought well you know here i am i'm an accounting major i'm pretty intelligent at least i thought i was and so i thought i knew how god wanted to display his word and i'm afraid sometimes that's what we think oh my first sermon was on love i remember writing man i just went through the it's easy you just pick the scripture on love go to the concordance it gives you every other scripture that ties to that one right man this preaching is easy anybody can do this right you don't need to sound so emphatic oh yes but we find that anybody they just think oh i'm intellectual i can sit down and brother ben said this i heard it on tape i put it here put it here but here the problem is we've had too much intellectual preaching the problem is we've had let me just i'm gonna go home preach for a minute we've had too much intellectual preaching i'm tired of intellectual preaching what we need what this bride needs what this body needs is a god-inspired anointed holy ghost preaching that'll make men and women fall to their needs and surrender their hearts to god it's a need so people can come up and realize when i walk through that prayer line i'm not just going to have brother joe lay hands on me but god is going to meet me because he's the same men who study the bible study the messages they can put it all together recite paragraphs and yet their congregations sit dead and yet there's no young people coming to the lord but they're streaming out on the streets going to the world there's nobody there's no freedom to worship they sing two or three songs and they shut the servants down there's no freedom in the church let me tell you your congregation is dead and what you need is a heartfelt god ordained inspired preaching where the holy ghost can come and inspire your life and inspire the word and inspire coming to church we're coming to church this ain't a religious duty it's not just a drudgery but you can't wait you can't wait we won't god inspire god anointed preaching we want a living god living himself out not only from behind the pulpit but in the congregation we want teaching but not bored monotone intellectual teaching we want holy ghost inspired anointed teaching that establishes you in the present truth so you know the fundamental foundations of what we believe and ain't no devil in hell can shake you off of it that's what we want we want a living god we want a living god manifesting himself through the preaching of the word notice it's all we got is intellectualism then our religion is dead our church is dead and i hate to say it some of us are dead because all we've taken is what god did 60 years ago oh great what he did here at sunset mountain well we're clinging on what he did then but where's god it today if anybody should know the power of god is tucson arizona some of you make trips pilgrimage up to the den to see the den and see all the wonderful things there i'm not pulling things away from that but let me tell you those things ain't gonna get you to heaven seeing the dnc in this relic it's gotta be more than a relic it's got to be more than packing an image you got to be the image of christ and that's what he's looking for i look i thank god that we can see those things and see the supernatural the miraculous and the 42 inches of the the caribou there and this and the brown tip grizzly and all these things the civil tip grizzly i'm glad we got all things what does that do that proves that the word is true but what i need is a real visitation a real manifestation ain't living god living through my life living in my church living in my family changing who i am i don't need a den room full of stuffed animals i need a living god stuffing himself in my life every day overcoming my frail humanity overcoming my disappointments overcoming my failures overcoming in my life that's what we want church quit looking back and look to where god's at today i'm not mad i'm just passionate i want to see jesus today i want to see him brother aaron let me just tell you sirs we are we are seeing jesus can i go a little bit longer we are john 14 12 says verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me and the works that i do shall he do also when i read that that empowers me brother craig that the same thing that jesus did joe adams is getting to do it too oh glory come on church the same things that he did we have the honor we had the we have been called to do the same thing we have been hand picked by of all the millions let's just think about have all the thousands hundreds of thousands that live in tucson god's hand picked you for this service this morning so that the revelation and the reality of who he is can strike your heart you'll walk out of here never defeated he'll walk out here knowing who you are and whose you are notice when he was here he did not claim to do miracles he said he was he said it was the father god that dwelleth in him he expressed god through himself god and otherwise built himself a body that he lived himself in god came down was manifested in the flesh of christ and it was not jesus the body the son of god it was the god of glory in the son of god showing the glory of god through himself the god of glory manifesting the glory of god and now god is in a multi-member body manifesting the glory of god because he's the same today he's the same now the bible tells us in first peter 2 and 9 but you're a chosen generation some of you fight with your choosing don't you how many has ever struggled with being called well i got one honest person in here that's right we'll open the altar up at the end of service many times you know one minute we feel called text minute man we weren't too sure about that call but here he says you are a chosen generation and i'm going to give you an out y'all know what that means today give you an out i'll give you a way out it's an older kind of congregation we gotta dumb down our new lingo today so we can all understand it but the bible says we are a chosen generation hand-picked hand-picked offspring elected of god a royal priesthood a holy nation this is my favorite word in the whole scripture peculiar odd strange i was preaching this back in arkansas first time i preached it i said yes some of you are strange and this one little girl went she's like i can't believe you said that but in reality we are strange and we are everyone odd one to another and definitely to the world they don't understand our dress they don't understand our actions they don't understand this message they don't understand the god that we serve but we're hand-picked elected chosen royal priest to it peculiar we're all different not all y'all can run around like me sweat and perspire and shout and scream and some of y'all i'm not going to sleep like y'all i'm just kidding that was a wake y'all up that was sleeping but see the bible would tell us which in time passed were not a people but now the people of god you are not a people but now you are the people of god you're a chosen generation chosen for this moment chosen for this hour chosen to manifest jesus christ the same isaiah 60 and verse 1 says arise arise shine brother joe i'm just not it's not my nature that word shine means to become illuminated you don't have to shout just illuminate yourself with this word alum let jesus christ manifest himself on the job let him manifest himself at walmart or publix or wherever you go to do your mind let jesus christ manifest yourself in church or on the highway when somebody cut you off yes yeah we got an honest soul this morning praise god lord bless her this morning she had been cut off she wasn't feeling it this morning but we want we want god to manifest himself we want to rise and shine and become illuminated because our light the bible says for thy light thy message has come we're not looking for another message church we got all that we have need of right here in this word we're not looking for another messenger we're not looking for another message we're not looking for another church we are comfortable we're happy right here in the promised land you know what boaz told ruth he said ruth don't go don't don't don't go in somebody else's field stay in this field oh let me tell you a tucson tabernacle stay in this field don't go church hopping here and church hopping there looking for this one looking for that one stay in this bill you got a promise he's gonna drop handfuls on purpose one ministry after another ministry it's coming by dropping a handful so that you can see who you are you may have walked into boaz's land a proper husband dead and your life seemed to be ruined but god almighty god has got a purpose for your life he's going to raise you from the ashes and let you become the wife of boaz and everything that beau has on she had rights too oh hallelujah every servant had to listen to her voice hold my back up devil because we're realizing who we are arise and shine become illuminated for the glory and the reputation of the lord has risen upon thee oh my let me find me a place to start slowing down notice and out of that pentecostal people let me go back he goes something says that if you pack an image of christ in your car or on your wall that's all that it is for be a sign of a christian he says but i don't think that packing an image makes you a christian i believe that being an image of christ makes you a christian it's not what we do outwardly it's what happened endlessly that makes us what we are then therefore if he is our image and we are in his likeness in the members of his body we should be images like him then our lives should reflect the image of christ not in our joining of church not in our packing of a crucifix or are our emotions but it should be in a living presence of the living god that's reflected through our life a living god being reflected brother aaron through our life he says then i see a spirit-filled church with its sign reflecting the coming of the sun the morning star putting off its rays oh happy am i i'm glad that god has a church that he can put off or that can put off the rays it's a reflection let christ reflect himself in you let christ reflect himself in you well then says and the message confirmations i'll start bringing this down to a close i'm not closing five times i got a habit of closing five times five is grace i get it we're to try to do it in three we're going to make it perfect right he says and jesus is so close to the coming of the earth now until his power has begun to catch the people his power has begun to catch the people oh my they begin to see the manifestation they begin to become the manifestation catch the people why did they come up getting them ready for the bride getting ready to be caught up in the rapture a church that'll just fit just exactly to be taken up through its power will draw all the rest of them that's been born again out of the earth he goes oh the church started in martin luther's time under justification under wesley through sanctification and now in the baptism of holy ghost with the pentecostals and the restoration of the gifts and out of the pentecostal people he's pulling out the remnant up here to show jesus christ reflect his life just the same yesterday today and forever exactly when the evening lights shine see the remnant is made up of the word and the spirit the two have to be married together because otherwise the word is just dead letter but when that is spirit anoints in marriage to that word it becomes a living reality of a living god not man-made creeds not dogmas not doctrines not man's idea not an intellectual idea not educated lectures but she's made up of the quickening power of god she is jesus christ today in the form of his earthly bride jesus christ today in the form of his earthly bride what is he doing declaring himself the same same word same principle same power same signs same wonders living the same life living the same life how many have ever heard about the welsh revival i'm going to end right here on the welsh revival about a century ago 1901 1902 somewhere around there actually 1903 and 1904 the welsh revival the the century or the nation of wales received probably 100 000 new converts during this time and this revival will spread to the four corners of the world and notice its beginnings didn't start with well-named preachers he didn't have donnie reagan ron spencer aaron guerra craig boeher tim pruitt expanding the globe 100 years ago it started with just men who had a desire to see god move there's a reverend by the name of joseph jenkins he's been so much concerned about the low state of spirituality in the churches in the area and he's set to organize and conventions to remedy the situation and on december 31st 1903 and january 1st 1904 he began having services with the youth and his challenging messages began to affect the youth young people don't despise your young your youth mama i hire y'all say it here grandmother grandfather we say mama and peppa back in the south don't despise their youth but he says there was one one young girl seeking a deep a deeper commitment to god miss flory evans she asked the reverend how could she have a deeper commitment and he asked her was jesus christ the lord of all her life on the second sunday of 1904 in a youth meeting following a sunday's morning service jenkins asked for personal testimonies there was a prolonged silence and then suddenly a young girl named flory evans rose to her feet and she began to speak softly and trembling and she says i love the lord jesus with all my heart so softly so reverently so honestly i love the lord there's not a moment that goes by that i don't wake up in the morning and i thank god for where he's brought me from and i say lord i thank you that i'm not where i used to be i'm no longer a sinner i'm no longer bar hopping i'm no longer in the party scene i'm no longer living that life god i thank you i love you lord with all my heart and there was a journalist there by the name of t.w.t.w stead and he would say it like this he says the pathos and the passion of the eval of that young girl acted like an electric shock upon the congregation one after another rose and made a full surrender the news spread like wildfire from place to place that the revival had broken out and that souls were being gathered to the lord those words i love the lord brother aaron with all my heart became the spark that ignited revival fires those words spoken on february the 14th 1904 were the first drops of an international downpour the first drops and i asked you what would happen in tucson tabernacle this morning it's just one of us will stand to our feet and say i love you lord i love you with all my heart god i thank you that you're more you're more than a god of history you're more than a god of 60 years ago but you're present today i wonder if those words spoken on the lips of a man and a woman this morning can start a revival in your life what could it do for your church what could it do for your family what could those words do you say brother joe what can i do to serve god you can love him more you can surrender more to him g campbell morgan put it like this he says if you and i could stand above wells looking at it you will see fire breaking out here and there in yonder and everywhere else without any collusion or pre-arrangement it is a divine visitation in which god let me say this reverently in which god is saying to us see what i can do without the things that you're depending on see what i can do and answer to praying people see what i can do through the simplest who are ready to fall in line and depend holy and absolutely upon me and we know that brother bannon will talk about the welsh revival he says there started a bunch of illiterate people preaching the gospel and the power and the glory of god began to fall until businessmen would go to work they'd push back their deaths and they'd weep like babies and close their business farmers in the field would be sitting on their plows they stopped their teams they got out in the field ranked centers raise their hands to god and cry out for mercy people walking the roads everywhere whistles started blowing and everything there was a revival that was on wt stayed the journalists would say there began to be less drinking less idleness less gambling men record that almost incredulous amazement how one football player after another forsaking their cars or drinking their gladiatorial games living a sober and godly life putting their energy into the revival so i ask you tucson tabernacle what about you what about you men will cross over culverts and come under such conviction because a preacher stopped and began to praise that god let every man and woman child boy that crosses over this culvert may they fall under conviction and they would fall under conviction get off their horses and wheat their way to calvary they go down to the dinner table and he asked and one preacher asked for desire to to pray and he began to pray and said god let every person that comes into this place this establishment when they sit down and grab their food may they fall under conviction and they begin to push their food away and weep their way to calvary he said that's the kind of revival that we need tonight and i'm going to say it like this that's the kind of arrival that we need this morning so brother joe but you're pointing us back no what was god doing in the welsh revival god was showing that he was the same was the same god in 1903 1904 as he was with martin as he was with columba as he was with irenaeus as he was with any other age he was displaying himself the same and where did it start with a young person he doesn't have to be some great intellectual preacher or some well-known preacher it started with a young flory evans said i love you lord with all my heart now dignitaries from the united states went over to wells because they wanted to see what this revival was all about you know that's kind of what we want to see you you heard about what's going on that evening like tabernacle have y'all heard about what's going on there nobody okay well some of y'all man secret being healed cancer's being defeated little boy getting up never walks he's walking running around we got little hair hair growing back on a little girl's head we see all the supernatural and if we're just carnal like these early early americans were going over the wells they wanted to know where this building was that this revival took place in otherwise they wanted to go and see what they could mimic maybe pre-plan their service copy this piece and that piece and to replicate it here and replicate it there they wanted the mechanics of the revive oh my but god was more than just mechanics he was showing that it didn't have anything to do with the mechanics brother aaron there it was they come off with their big top hats walking down the road trying to figure out where the revival started how it spread here to here and man what in the world took place to get all this together and it seems like everybody is all shouting and hollering hallelujah praise god there ain't no sick here and a little policeman out there on the street just swinging a baton just doing his job every day life with the joy of the lord all on his face oh yeah my good man can you tell me where the welch revival's at he just swinging his baton you know just kind of maybe maybe ignored him for a minute is this all right swinging his baton like some of you you know you just you're just casual you know just go to work doing your thing the joy of the lord on your face happiness in your heart knowing who god is knowing that you belong to god knowing that god is real to you just swinging his baton they come up to him my good man could you tell me well the welch revival is and i believe he kind of folded his arms about his here i don't know about this revival that's how some of us think sometimes don't no man man something just a spirit of god god alive in him he says yes i can tell you where the rest revival is you're looking at the revival i have the wealth revival why because it was not just a manifestation on the church building it wasn't just the words that were put on a page no but he had become the revival and the revival had become him and when somebody asked you where is the bride's revival you say you're looking at the bride's revival i am the prize revival i am the manifestation of the word i am jesus christ the same today he's the same today in my life in my family in my home in my church he is the same today they were looking for mechanics but god's showing he was in the dynamics of the word church don't be afraid of the dynamics don't be afraid of the shout don't be afraid of the emotion welcome it because it's that is what it takes to give life to the word so that he can be the same today so that he can be the same today now let me finish with this because i told you i told you i was going to show you he's the same in tucson tabernacle now we heard we've heard what he's done at evening light we had a brother in our church brother gary stanky he was at the brink of death god completely healed and delivered him our sister karen who's done going on with the lord but god delivered her from brain bleeds three separate times drew dexter not able to walk god raised this young boy up and let me tell you that kid hadn't stopped walking stop running little jessica conroy she was a sister in our church that had suffered from a spirit of epilepsy and suicidalness god delivered her of both of these spirits y'all have heard of sister atlanta busts and i think i showed y'all the images last time i was here how god delivered her from stage four non-hodgkin's cancer you heard the story of mariah pruitt how god put hair back on her head when she had alopecia and they said there was no known cure for alopecia told you the story about brother justin ware whose little sister came up in a prayer line she said i want to see my brother saved and within 15 to 20 minutes of that prayer he comes stumbling in the doors he been out in the world been doing drugs and drinking and carrying on in the college scene but he comes stumbling in gave his heart to the lord and he's never looked back i'm telling you about a living god and i'm declaring to you today he's the same he's alive today he's here with us now he's living through his bride he's operating through his body sister rachel guerra how many of y'all know sister rachel guerra two of y'all my come on does she go to church here or what last time i was here she had been suffering with stomach issues from gluten gluten intolerancy i finished preaching and i believe i can't remember exactly what i preached on at this very moment but i remember when i got done preaching i walked to the back i got my stuff and i walked around right back there where brother arnie's at i stood back there and i just patiently waited as i just watched the song leader finish and wrap up the service something drew me to go to the back she walked back in and stood next door or not right next to me back there and she said she was trouble she wanted to speak to me because i'd preached on the pool of bethesda how when the waters got troubled you got to step in and say she said that she had just been struggling because she wanted she want to speak to me but she was overcome because she thinks she could she would inconvenience me i said you know of course not so she finally spoke to me and told her what her problems was and i began to pray with her and we prayed and i told her i said this is not by happenstance or by a mistake that i walked back here but it was a predestinated moment and i prayed with her and she began if y'all remember she began to scream out in the crowd she said immediately the pain that she was dealing with left her she goes it's been close to two weeks at this point with me eating almost wheat almost daily i felt very sick following saturday but but rebuked and ate again and left me i'm completely healed and i'm daily thanking god from and praising the lord she goes and should i add this i've been eight it's been eight years that i struggle with it not counting childhood issues let me ask you church who did that he wasn't brother joe adams but it was jesus christ the same today jesus christ the same today i believe it was in that same service we had a prayer line and one of the sisters brother aaron's sister-in-law believed it may have been your sister gave testimony that if she stood in the prayer line she felt something just kept coming moving back and forth back and forth and it was the presence of the angel of the lord was moving up and down the prayer line he was at the end of one of the services some of y'all got up and walked out and you missed your opportunity but what was it jesus christ the same today brother ed douglas stood right back there in that same service he was being nudged go and get in the prayer line he says no i can i don't need the prayer line i can do this you know how we are sometimes you know you feel that nudge me like no i'm not going to do it but he said it kept nudging him kept nudging him and he came into the prayer line how many of y'all know brother ed okay just make sure he goes to church here too he said he suffered with back problems 40 years due to football injury he could hardly walk bend over to put his shoes on and his socks on but he said i felt the presence of the lord nudging me to go through the prayer line but i insisted because i felt that god could heal me where i was at yes all right he goes i resist him and sometimes that's our problem when you feel that slightest nudge that's the time to move he goes after several moments i felt the lord judge me again to go through the parallel i came up and i was in lots of pain and after prayer i walked back to my seat still in pain but i came back to the evening service and the pain has completely subsided sunday night i slept for the first time in a long time without any pain and got a good night's sleep i worked all day on monday without any pain at all he said god has completely healed me now i'm pain-free after 40 years you say brother joe that's not so much what about if you was the one in pain for 40 years how many of y'all know brother uh brother jill farney and we ended with this testimony musicians make your way back if you would please well the jewish phony was preaching at a church it was a paralyzed man he came to church that night or that morning and he was preaching this man they caught a disease in his spine they left him paralyzed for 14 years and he came up for prayer and he asked brother joel if he believed that the lord would heal him and if you know brother jewell he turned it right back on him he said do you believe it's not so much whether i believe or the ministry believes but it is do you believe he said do you believe that the lord would heal me and brother joel said do you believe that he will he said yes i believe amen he said yes i believe that the lord will heal me that was a saturday night sunday morning or sunday night he stood up out of his wheelchair for the first time in 14 years see our struggle is we want to look back we want to look back i want to look back to 63 when the seals become open want to look back to 65 and see the supernatural and we fail church we fail to see a living god in our midst this man because a prophet god said or the angel lord told the prophet if you can get the people to believe to believe you and i believe that holds true for every god anointed minister if you can get the people to believe you nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer this man had a disease in his body left him paralyzed for 14 years never walking never moving out of that wheelchair brother aaron but he came up in a service much like this morning do you believe brother joel that got to heal me i'm asking do you believe that he'll heal you this morning he came back to service on sunday night and for the first time in 14 years got up out of his wheelchair got up out of his wheelchair that same week he went to the doctor because you know what happens you got to testify he goes to the doctor says doctor i got to tell you what god has done for me god has healed me i don't need this wheelchair the doctor says come on man that's foolish your case is too far gone you're gonna be bound in that wheelchair for the rest of your life that man got up out of that wheelchair and he took 300 steps what was he doing he was proving that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and i'm here to tell you through son tabernacle he's the same today he's the same today if you can't believe all things are possible he left that doctor's office and went up and went to a to a dealership and bought a brand new truck and started driving and if god can do that for him what can the living god do for you this morning let you bow your heads for a minute if he can do that for a man 14 years bound in a wheelchair what could he do for you this morning i'm here to declare like brother mock intentions is this that jesus christ is the same he's the same today as he was yesterday he's the same in principle he's the same in power he's the same in every detail only now he's using your hands he's using your feet he's manifesting
