[16:15] we believe her dog got out and um
[16:19] just thankful that no one was killed in
[16:21] it and it wasn't
[16:22] a worse fire that took them about an
[16:24] hour and a half to get it under control
[16:26] they'd ran out of water and
[16:27] burned completely to the ground but just
[16:29] remember her in prayer and
[16:31] her name is gail and she's no family or
[16:34] next of kin really close and it's just a
[16:36] kind of a sad situation but the lord

[18:43] this morning lord we'd ask in the
[18:45] precious name of jesus christ
[18:47] amen you may be seated uh
[18:51] just want to go over take care of a
[18:53] little bit of church business
[18:56] before we really get going into the
[18:59] into the worship and in into the
[19:02] ministry
[19:04] um i'd like to talk
[19:07] i've talked to brother matt watkins and
[19:10] it's just something that we need to
[19:12] reiterate time to time
[19:15] since coronavirus
[19:19] started brother matt had asked that we
[19:21] would keep
[19:22] every other row empty
[19:25] and if you've noticed coming in the rows
[19:28] that are supposed to be
[19:29] left open are the rows that have the red
[19:32] tape
[19:33] on on each end so we're trying to keep
[19:36] that
[19:38] completely open and i know that there's
[19:41] some families that are
[19:42] pretty good-sized families that actually
[19:44] take the whole row and god bless each of
[19:45] you
[19:46] for it makes the church feel a little
[19:48] more
[19:49] a little fuller but what we'd like to
[19:53] also reiterate
[19:54] is the last two rows in the very back
[19:59] we want to keep that open for the
[20:01] families with small
[20:02] children six and below
[20:05] now obviously if you're a family and
[20:07] that have a couple teenagers but you
[20:09] have a six year old or below
[20:11] you know sit as a family uh we're not
[20:14] going to ask you to get up because you
[20:15] got some teenagers there
[20:17] but we really need your help on this
[20:22] it's hard to come up and ask someone to
[20:26] move
[20:26] you know especially when you're all
[20:28] settled in but
[20:29] it's something that we're trying to keep
[20:31] for the families with small children
[20:33] we don't want to be legalistic in any
[20:35] way shape or form about it
[20:37] but i really appreciate
[20:40] everyone's effort in this you guys have
[20:42] done a fantastic job
[20:44] up to now but we just want to remind you
[20:47] that
[20:48] every other row is supposed to be open
[20:52] and brother matt felt to do that out of
[20:54] respect for what was asked
[20:56] so we could open up again to meet
[21:01] for those that don't mind the young men
[21:03] uh
[21:04] are welcome to sit up on the front row
[21:06] uh that's the way
[21:08] i remember brother green doing it oh and
[21:11] it never hurt anybody so
[21:13] but we would like everyone to i i know
[21:16] i've
[21:17] don't want to separate families and if
[21:20] you could help us by just
[21:22] sitting in a row that's not not marked
[21:25] off or
[21:25] supposed to be left open we would really
[21:27] appreciate it so lord bless you you know
[21:30] let brother jordan come back up
[21:35] amen brother uh brother watkins had said
[21:39] a few
[21:39] comments as well on wednesday night
[21:41] right at the end of service if you
[21:42] didn't have a chance to
[21:45] hear that feel free to go get that on
[21:47] the archive if you don't know how to
[21:49] access the archive let us know and we'll
[21:52] try to assist in making that happen so
[21:56] just love the lord amen
[21:59] amen so back in
[22:03] august i want to say that august 14th
[22:05] where the matthew brother watkins came
[22:06] and
[22:07] shared with the congregation the
[22:08] fellowship hall just his thoughts about
[22:10] the last
[22:10] six months from february uh ninth
[22:14] to august ninth and how that had gone
[22:16] and how
[22:18] coronavirus has just kind of upset and
[22:20] put a pause on a lot of things from his
[22:22] perspective and how he felt like
[22:24] what his desire was to do in that six
[22:26] month trial
[22:28] so during that time we had some
[22:30] conversations and that's
[22:31] what transpired out of those
[22:33] conversations with him and family coming
[22:35] for
[22:36] several weeks and just to try to spend
[22:38] some time here and
[22:39] maybe get some clarity on things as well
[22:41] as uh you know the congregation
[22:44] just get to know them more and so forth
[22:46] and
[22:47] i trust that the trip out for them
[22:50] was a blessing for them and for you all
[22:54] and i think for the matthew's desire i
[22:57] don't
[22:57] want to say i think his desire is to
[23:00] extend that another six months because
[23:02] of the coronavirus just kind of
[23:04] shutting everything down and and not
[23:06] really allowing what he felt like was
[23:08] a trial in his a trial pastoral period
[23:12] for six months
[23:13] so us brothers had talked and our
[23:14] thoughts were you know if the
[23:16] congregation was
[23:17] was was minded to go that way we are
[23:21] we are 100 happy to go that direction
[23:24] um and maybe i wasn't very clear in my
[23:26] comments and maybe i wasn't talking very
[23:28] loud on
[23:29] sunday night in the in the fellowship
[23:31] hall
[23:33] but the real the thought was if you
[23:36] have a something that's different than
[23:38] that you feel strongly that we want to
[23:40] have a vote for the six months
[23:41] another six months or you just want to
[23:44] do something different
[23:45] let one of us brothers know or if you
[23:47] want to be anonymous put a note in the
[23:49] offering
[23:50] tithes box if you feel like something
[23:53] different
[23:53] honestly i think in the last six seven
[23:56] weeks we've only had maybe
[23:59] i only initially had one person approach
[24:01] me and
[24:02] um there was i think brother ed and i
[24:04] have both had an additional person
[24:06] approach us in the last couple of weeks
[24:08] um
[24:09] and i don't think brother arnie brother
[24:11] aaron maybe has had one or two comments
[24:13] questions
[24:13] but if there's if there's a strong you
[24:15] know i don't know what that number is i
[24:17] don't know if it's two or three
[24:19] or if it's 10 i don't know what that
[24:20] number is but if there's a if there's an
[24:22] interest in having a vote
[24:24] i think the vote would be this do we
[24:27] extend this another quote unquote six
[24:29] months
[24:30] to february 9th and i say six months
[24:32] because we've really already worked
[24:34] through the first six weeks of six
[24:35] months six or seven weeks of six months
[24:37] do we extend that another four and a
[24:40] half months to
[24:41] february 9th or do we stop
[24:44] pause and or you might say stop stop
[24:47] that and go on to something else
[24:49] so if our as brothers have felt like
[24:53] we've we're this far and brother matthew
[24:56] feels
[24:56] feels good about it we're just going to
[24:58] continue but if again if if the
[25:00] congregation wants to have a vote this
[25:01] isn't our decision
[25:02] this is the congregation as brother
[25:04] branham says every member of the
[25:05] congregation has a vote
[25:07] so if if you want to vote we don't want
[25:09] to necessarily have to have a vote if
[25:11] everyone's all in agreement and we're
[25:13] just going to move on but if anybody
[25:15] wants to have a vote we're not opposed
[25:16] to that either
[25:17] so you just let us know if you like i
[25:19] say don't want to do it
[25:21] you know make you make your thoughts
[25:22] known feel free to put it in the the
[25:24] offering ties box we've had a lot of
[25:25] support in the other way to let's
[25:27] let's keep going and trying this through
[25:29] february 9th
[25:31] so you just let us know and i hope that
[25:33] what i'm saying is clear if it isn't
[25:36] feel free to ask one of us brothers just
[25:37] for clarification
[25:39] um we don't we certainly don't have it
[25:42] all figured out and we don't know what
[25:43] the end holds
[25:45] but we knew who holds tomorrow we know
[25:47] where we want to go
[25:48] we know we we want to just go to heaven
[25:50] amen we want our lamps trimmed and clear
[25:52] we want them full of oil and
[25:56] so that's that's sort of what my things
[25:58] were any
[25:59] any questions is that clear enough
[26:02] hopefully
[26:03] and if if we if we want to have a vote
[26:05] as a congregation we'll do one here in
[26:07] the next
[26:07] probably middle of october we'll talk to
[26:10] brother matthew about
[26:12] brother watkins about the exact time
[26:14] frame on that but we would do one
[26:16] and we'd just be do we extend this
[26:19] another four and a half four months
[26:20] essentially would be at that point or do
[26:22] we move forward and do something else
[26:25] so lord bless you and don't hesitate to
[26:28] come and talk to us if you have a
[26:29] question so
[26:31] all right i think that's everything
[26:34] unless somebody else
[26:35] wants to say something just leave it at
[26:37] that
[26:38] the old rugged cross made a difference
[26:40] amen
[26:43] you can get caught up in all these
[26:44] little details
[26:46] but ultimately it's jesus it's our focus
[26:50] our desire he's our everything amen
[26:53] [Music]
[26:55] on a hill far
[26:59] away stood an
[27:02] old rugged cross
[27:07] the emblem of
[27:11] suffering and shame
[27:14] [Music]

[50:43] in jesus christ's name amen god bless
[50:46] you may be seated for a moment here
[50:50] this morning ministering for us brother
[50:53] isaiah
[50:55] from north carolina he attends brother
[50:58] joe fournier's church
[51:00] and i got a chance to meet with him a
[51:02] little bit and
[51:05] just trusting that the lord has
[51:06] something for us
[51:08] if you come with expectation god will
[51:10] meet it
[51:12] if you don't have any expectation right
[51:13] now get some and say lord you know what
[51:15] i have neither so
[51:17] i had a chance to just spend a few
[51:18] minutes with him and
[51:21] just the spirit and his attitude was
[51:23] just wonderful so
[51:25] god knows those things that he's doing
[51:27] now
[51:28] did brother jordan mention any prayer
[51:29] request i was
[51:32] because sister barbara mentioned to
[51:34] remind us that
[51:36] brother jeffrey they're still trying to
[51:37] find out where the internal bleeding
[51:39] is as he's in the hospital so it lets
[51:42] you remember that and
[51:45] for my family uh if you have the
[51:47] whatsapp or maybe saw on facebook
[51:50] nina and steven have been married for
[51:51] about three and a half years now and had
[51:53] been wanting
[51:54] a child and nina let us know
[51:58] about two or three weeks ago that she
[52:00] thought she might be pregnant
[52:02] but she wanted to confirm and she got it
[52:04] confirmed last week or the week before
[52:06] that she was
[52:08] they were quite excited but thursday she
[52:10] had a miscarriage
[52:12] and of course it's hard it's tough
[52:16] can't in any way say i understand
[52:18] because i don't
[52:20] but the heart hurts and and all but she
[52:23] put out a little testimony this morning
[52:26] on facebook and she talked to me about
[52:29] and she said
[52:30] dad you know we talk about a kind of
[52:32] comfort god is we talk about what he
[52:34] does for us
[52:35] but until you go through it and then you
[52:37] get to really know
[52:39] what god can do for you so she shared
[52:42] and
[52:42] she shared with me a little testimony
[52:44] her boss
[52:46] told her she said nina you of all
[52:49] know that these things don't happen
[52:52] without a reason
[52:54] and i said well there's the first
[52:55] confirmation right there that they've
[52:56] seen the god that you serve
[52:58] alive live india and so she put that up
[53:02] today she said i don't know how or how
[53:04] god does this
[53:05] but he has brought us comfort even
[53:07] though it's a difficult time
[53:08] and she asked that we would thank you
[53:11] because we did put it up on the whatsapp
[53:14] she wanted to say thank you for
[53:15] appreciating your prayers
[53:17] and your thoughts for her but god has a
[53:19] reason and he knows why
[53:22] can't pretend that to say i understand i
[53:24] know how you feel because i don't but he
[53:26] does
[53:27] he knows what it is so he's able to
[53:30] minister he's able to bring so
[53:32] if you have a need you believe god can
[53:35] meet it through the ministry and of the
[53:37] word of god
[53:38] i was speaking to brother isaiah and i
[53:40] said shall we pray together and
[53:42] he said let's do that and i prayed and
[53:43] he said thank you because you just
[53:45] confirmed to my heart in your prayer
[53:46] what god has put i don't know that but
[53:49] god does
[53:50] he's the same yesterday today and
[53:51] forever so
[53:53] brother matt and the family got home
[53:55] it's their home now they're safe he said
[53:56] he'd be
[53:57] streaming in so and i'm going to say
[54:00] this
[54:00] because we've heard it already the
[54:02] brother matt went home because he's not
[54:03] going to be our pastor
[54:05] okay and you know what we heard it from
[54:08] other parts of the country
[54:10] and that's amazing when they know things
[54:12] before we do
[54:14] speaking to brother matt he said don't
[54:15] worry about it i'll take care of that
[54:18] that if you hear that don't take any
[54:20] serious thought about it
[54:22] okay brother matt did not go home
[54:24] because he was not going to be our
[54:25] pastor it was just
[54:26] they had to go home okay it's that
[54:28] simple so he'll be back with us in two
[54:30] weeks or so in the meantime
[54:32] brother isaiah will be ministering this
[54:34] morning this evening
[54:36] and then lord william will minister on
[54:38] wednesday and then um
[54:41] we'll be having some visiting ministers
[54:42] like it was before one week
[54:45] visiting the next week brother matt but
[54:48] we have somebody here who will never
[54:50] leave us
[54:51] never leave us alone he said where two
[54:54] or three are gathered in his name
[54:56] he'll be there in the midst of them so

[55:00] stand

[1:09:09] the 12th chapter and we
[1:09:12] read from verse 20 down to
[1:09:16] 24 and we go to uh philippians
[1:09:21] the third chapter to scripture
[1:09:24] and we let you be seated amen are we
[1:09:28] there by saying amen
[1:09:30] the gospel of john the 12th chapter and
[1:09:33] the 21st
[1:09:35] it's talking about the son of man being
[1:09:38] glorified knowing jesus was
[1:09:40] the son of man he was god emmanuel in
[1:09:44] flesh
[1:09:44] that's right the bible said and there
[1:09:47] were
[1:09:48] certain greeks among them that came up
[1:09:51] to worship
[1:09:52] at the feasts the the same came
[1:09:55] therefore to philip
[1:09:57] uh which was of bethesda of galilee
[1:10:01] and desire him saying sirs we would
[1:10:04] see jesus philip cometh
[1:10:08] and telleth andrew and again andrew
[1:10:11] conjunction working together unity
[1:10:14] and philip telleth jesus
[1:10:18] and jesus answered them saying
[1:10:21] the hour is come that the son of man
[1:10:25] shall be glorified verily verily i
[1:10:28] say unto you a separate corner weak fall
[1:10:31] into the ground
[1:10:32] and die it abideth alone
[1:10:36] but if it die it'll bring it forth
[1:10:39] much fruit now let's turn with me
[1:10:42] to philippians the third chapter
[1:10:46] and verse 10. philippians
[1:10:50] 3 and verse 10.
[1:10:54] paul writes here he says that i
[1:10:58] personal that i might know him
[1:11:01] and the power of his resurrection and
[1:11:05] the fellowshipping of his suffering
[1:11:07] being made
[1:11:08] conformable unto his death let us just
[1:11:11] buy our heads again
[1:11:12] father we thank you lord jesus for the
[1:11:15] reading of your word
[1:11:16] now lord god sanctify it to our soul
[1:11:19] this reacts
[1:11:20] in jesus name amen and amen you may be
[1:11:23] seated and we just
[1:11:25] be all right we just take this jacket
[1:11:26] off praise the lord
[1:11:29] amen
[1:11:32] i laid my watch here and our time back
[1:11:35] home is
[1:11:36] it's three hours uh right now back home
[1:11:39] it's uh
[1:11:41] it's two o'clock so we're gonna try to
[1:11:44] watch our time amen we don't want to
[1:11:46] uh we just want the lord to have full
[1:11:49] preeminence
[1:11:50] amen so my thought this morning by the
[1:11:53] help of the lord
[1:11:54] is amen
[1:11:58] sirs we would
[1:12:02] see jesus amen and the prophet of god
[1:12:06] spoke this message amen uh many years
[1:12:10] ago
[1:12:11] and it was really inspired to my heart
[1:12:14] amen sirs we would see
[1:12:17] jesus amen so we we see that
[1:12:21] is our whole purpose of coming to church
[1:12:25] is to see the lord jesus christ that's
[1:12:27] our whole ambition
[1:12:29] and if we don't get to see him then we
[1:12:31] have come in vain so to speak
[1:12:34] that's why we're here we're here not so
[1:12:37] much to see one another or
[1:12:39] what you sister what dress you have on
[1:12:41] or how your necktie
[1:12:43] look or are you wearing the same suit
[1:12:45] that you woe last week
[1:12:47] it's not about that we're here to see
[1:12:49] christ
[1:12:50] amen we are here to to look into the
[1:12:53] mirror
[1:12:54] of the word and examine ourself by the
[1:12:57] word
[1:12:58] amen so we we have to examine ourselves
[1:13:01] by the word
[1:13:02] the apostle paul wrote one time he said
[1:13:05] he said
[1:13:05] examine yourself prove your own self and
[1:13:08] i tell a lot of folks
[1:13:10] you know when we come to church a lot of
[1:13:11] times folks they look at
[1:13:13] others and try to see what kind of
[1:13:15] lifestyle that they live in
[1:13:17] that's not what paul told us to do he
[1:13:19] told us to
[1:13:20] examine ourselves and to prove ourself
[1:13:23] and to see rather
[1:13:24] we are in the faith make sure we got the
[1:13:28] revelation
[1:13:28] to get a body change make sure we have
[1:13:31] what it takes
[1:13:32] to make the rapture amen i appreciate my
[1:13:35] brother
[1:13:35] i appreciate my sister i appreciate my
[1:13:38] leader amen
[1:13:39] but i need to know do i have what it
[1:13:41] takes
[1:13:42] to make this rapture amen and uh
[1:13:45] a few years ago when we came into this
[1:13:48] message in
[1:13:50] 1984 i was 24 years old
[1:13:53] amen a young man just started uh
[1:13:55] ministering
[1:13:56] the word of god and uh we we from
[1:14:00] we came from out of uh uh pentecost amen
[1:14:04] and we come to the message in 84 and
[1:14:07] you know we was ministering and god was
[1:14:09] doing some things but
[1:14:11] look good the lord kept me amen the lord
[1:14:13] always kept me for
[1:14:15] uh being high lifted up amen
[1:14:18] always god somehow jesus kept me to be
[1:14:21] humble
[1:14:21] because i know the great one is the lord
[1:14:23] jesus christ amen there's no great one
[1:14:26] among us but the lord jesus christ
[1:14:28] that's who we worship that's the one we
[1:14:30] look up to
[1:14:31] that's the one our heart desire to see
[1:14:33] amen the songs say oh i want to see him
[1:14:36] just to look upon his face amen so that
[1:14:39] is our whole heart desire but
[1:14:42] about uh from uh starting a ministry as
[1:14:45] a young man
[1:14:46] and many years passed by and about 20
[1:14:49] years later
[1:14:50] i remember the home church that i was
[1:14:53] attending
[1:14:54] amen back in 2013 the
[1:14:57] the reason why i feel impressed to
[1:14:59] preach this message sir
[1:15:01] we will see jesus 2013
[1:15:05] uh brother aaron i was uh i was at my
[1:15:08] home church and uh we was praying
[1:15:10] as we would normally do but that
[1:15:13] particular time when i was praying
[1:15:16] and we all should pray amen the bible
[1:15:18] said i would that man pray
[1:15:20] always amen so that is how heart desire
[1:15:23] lord keep me
[1:15:24] from the evil of this world lord keep me
[1:15:26] from the hour of temptation
[1:15:28] lord don't let me go into the snares of
[1:15:30] the enemy but lord let me keep my eyes
[1:15:33] on the cross
[1:15:34] but that particular day amen a night of
[1:15:37] that evening
[1:15:38] i was praying as i would normally do for
[1:15:40] for many many years but
[1:15:42] amen but there came a time of the season
[1:15:45] as solomon said there's a time and
[1:15:47] there's a season for all things
[1:15:49] so that particular day uh evening i was
[1:15:52] praying
[1:15:53] and the lord spoke to me amen and and
[1:15:56] i'm sure the lord speaks to you because
[1:15:58] it's a good thing when god could speak
[1:16:01] when our heavenly father could speak to
[1:16:03] his children
[1:16:04] it'll be a sad thing to know that you
[1:16:06] got a father that would never speak to
[1:16:08] you
[1:16:08] oh my it'll be a shameful thing amen but
[1:16:11] that particular day i was
[1:16:13] evening i was praying and the lord spoke
[1:16:16] to me brother aaron
[1:16:17] he says uh accept the corn a week
[1:16:20] fall into the ground and die
[1:16:23] and i kept praying but the lord kept
[1:16:25] saying accept the corner we
[1:16:28] fall into the ground and die but i kept
[1:16:31] praying
[1:16:32] and it was almost like the lord said do
[1:16:34] you hear me
[1:16:35] and the lord kept saying accept a corn
[1:16:38] or wheat fall into the ground and die
[1:16:42] but i kept praying and the lord said
[1:16:44] again accept the corner weak fall into
[1:16:47] the ground
[1:16:48] and die so in my spirit i was like lord
[1:16:52] you know i've heard so when prayer was
[1:16:54] over i got up and
[1:16:55] uh i sought and i turned in my bible to
[1:16:58] the gospel of john the 12th chapter
[1:17:00] and i found where the greeks wanted to
[1:17:03] see jesus
[1:17:04] and as i began to read read the word of
[1:17:08] god so
[1:17:08] always go back to see what the prophet
[1:17:11] of god
[1:17:12] says about it and the prophet of god
[1:17:14] says you know
[1:17:15] in so many words he said god will come
[1:17:17] to you and
[1:17:18] amen he wants you to die but if you
[1:17:21] don't die
[1:17:21] the way amen god desires for you to die
[1:17:25] then you become religious
[1:17:29] are you hearing me let me just read
[1:17:31] something to you
[1:17:32] uh uh praise the lord because i don't
[1:17:35] want to get ahead of myself i
[1:17:37] i want to just take my time but yet i
[1:17:39] want to hurry up
[1:17:41] amen would that be all right amen it's
[1:17:44] easily amen
[1:17:45] you you pull and i preach amen you amen
[1:17:48] and we'll be finishing uh
[1:17:50] amen and we just go uh to the next
[1:17:53] service but
[1:17:54] i it it's good to be here in the
[1:17:57] presence of the lord
[1:17:59] amen like i said uh praise the lord
[1:18:04] i i i put something here i just wanted
[1:18:07] to slow myself down
[1:18:09] it's so important amen so the lord kept
[1:18:12] saying accept the corner we
[1:18:14] fall into the ground and die it abideth
[1:18:16] the law
[1:18:17] and and i i went to hear what the
[1:18:20] prophet of god
[1:18:22] uh began to say and this is what he said
[1:18:24] in 1962
[1:18:26] why in the message why he said jesus
[1:18:29] said
[1:18:30] except a corn a week fall into the
[1:18:32] ground and die it abideth alone
[1:18:35] and the people don't want to die you
[1:18:37] want to be religious so you accept a
[1:18:40] intellectual conception of it and then
[1:18:43] when you do that
[1:18:44] you are still dead in sin and trespass
[1:18:48] and that's what makes people act and do
[1:18:50] the way they do because
[1:18:52] the spirit that's in them dominates
[1:18:55] their lives so i begin to
[1:18:58] lord begin to tell me it's time for you
[1:19:01] to die you say wait a minute brother
[1:19:03] you've been preaching for all those
[1:19:05] years now god telling you it's time for
[1:19:07] you to die yes
[1:19:09] you'll be amazed what people don't want
[1:19:12] to die of
[1:19:13] you know like i was telling my precious
[1:19:15] brother yesterday we all
[1:19:17] fighting something in this on in this
[1:19:19] earthly house amen
[1:19:21] i might be fighting this thing amen and
[1:19:23] you might be fighting that thing
[1:19:25] but we're gonna have to die amen in
[1:19:28] order to see christ
[1:19:30] accept the corner we fall into the
[1:19:33] ground
[1:19:33] and die it'll abide abides along so i'm
[1:19:37] thinking within myself
[1:19:39] lord what are you saying
[1:19:42] and after the lord begin to show me
[1:19:45] that you got to die you got to die first
[1:19:48] of all
[1:19:49] you got to die from your pentecostal
[1:19:52] ideas and you got to come into
[1:19:56] a new day a new message
[1:20:00] amen you see pentecost went as far as
[1:20:03] they can go
[1:20:04] and today uh if you don't mind me saying
[1:20:07] i
[1:20:07] i preach out the same uh bible that
[1:20:11] uh uh uh my pentecostal brothers
[1:20:14] preach out of but today they're reading
[1:20:17] out of a
[1:20:18] closed book but god has
[1:20:21] enlightened us amen to have a book amen
[1:20:24] it's an open book it's not a closed book
[1:20:27] but i thank god today god was telling me
[1:20:30] accept the corner we
[1:20:32] fall into the ground and die it'll abide
[1:20:35] the law
[1:20:38] i said lord what are you saying he said
[1:20:40] you you
[1:20:41] you won't be able to help nobody i said
[1:20:44] what do you mean he said first of all
[1:20:46] how you going to help somebody
[1:20:48] you can't even help yourself
[1:20:51] wow he said except you fall into the
[1:20:54] ground and die
[1:20:56] you got to die it's one thing falling in
[1:20:58] the ground
[1:20:59] but there's another thing when you die
[1:21:02] you got to completely die you got to
[1:21:04] complete
[1:21:05] you said well a brother told me one time
[1:21:07] he said brother
[1:21:08] uh uh pentecostal brother he come to the
[1:21:10] mets and he went back
[1:21:12] amen he said brother uh uh uh people
[1:21:15] don't
[1:21:15] they overlook me he said i've been in
[1:21:17] the way for 40 years
[1:21:18] i said brother elder do you mind me
[1:21:21] telling you one thing
[1:21:22] i said your problem is you've been in
[1:21:24] the way too long
[1:21:25] what you need to do is get out the way
[1:21:28] and let god have
[1:21:29] his way a lot of time we we don't leave
[1:21:32] enough room to let god speak to her
[1:21:34] and let god tell us what he want us to
[1:21:37] do
[1:21:38] and you said brother children how can
[1:21:39] you preach like that to a messy church
[1:21:42] well my brother and sister i feel
[1:21:44] impressed in my heart
[1:21:46] uh places i've been gone i've seen
[1:21:48] people
[1:21:49] jump and shout and run the aisle and
[1:21:51] long dress and long hair
[1:21:53] amen and when the pastor leave they go
[1:21:55] back into the world they cut their hair
[1:21:57] they go back to movies they go back to
[1:21:59] television they go back to shack and
[1:22:01] go mix marriage and all that stuff why
[1:22:05] because they never die they never die
[1:22:08] they have gone to church amen they have
[1:22:10] amen they have some song
[1:22:11] but they themselves need to die and i
[1:22:14] begin to talk to the lord
[1:22:16] lord say it's time for you to die it's
[1:22:19] time for you to die
[1:22:20] you can't go no further you've got to
[1:22:23] die to set the corner we
[1:22:25] fall into the ground and die
[1:22:28] if it don't it can't bring forth no
[1:22:30] fruit you can't help nobody
[1:22:32] so the lord began to talk with me then
[1:22:34] paul
[1:22:35] apostle paul picks it up in philippians
[1:22:39] 10 3 and 10 or 10 and 3.
[1:22:42] it says that i might know him how many
[1:22:46] you like to know him
[1:22:49] now that word no is to understand him
[1:22:53] you know it'll be a sad thing to to go
[1:22:56] to church and
[1:22:57] you really don't know him you're just
[1:23:00] going to church where
[1:23:01] where you go to church at oh i go to uh
[1:23:04] uh tucson
[1:23:05] tabernacle really yes oh we got
[1:23:09] uh brother so-and-so he's our pastor
[1:23:12] and we got this and that that is good
[1:23:15] but what is the purpose the thing is
[1:23:19] have you had a nature change are you
[1:23:21] born again
[1:23:23] are you born again of it's got to be a
[1:23:26] death
[1:23:26] barrier and resurrection so what the
[1:23:29] lord was saying
[1:23:30] you got to know me in the power
[1:23:34] of my resurrection in the fellowshipping
[1:23:37] of my suffering it's more than just
[1:23:39] going to church and just
[1:23:41] warming the pews you got to know me
[1:23:44] you got to know me by divine revelation
[1:23:48] that what apostle peter said amen that
[1:23:51] we may know the divine
[1:23:52] nature of god god is love
[1:23:56] god is peace god is hope lord i want to
[1:23:59] know you
[1:24:00] in your suffering i want to know you
[1:24:03] lord
[1:24:03] i want to know you with all of my heart
[1:24:05] i said lord begin to come into my heart
[1:24:08] and you said wait a minute brother you
[1:24:10] mean he said you've been preaching all
[1:24:11] that long
[1:24:12] and that let me tell you paul had a
[1:24:14] progressive ministry
[1:24:16] william branham had a progressive
[1:24:17] ministry you could come
[1:24:19] see i i tell the folks a lot of times
[1:24:22] there's a lot of people
[1:24:24] that some some come to church some uh
[1:24:27] uh some ascent someone went and some
[1:24:30] just got up and
[1:24:31] you know some sent some call and some
[1:24:33] just got up and went
[1:24:35] so my purpose is when we come to church
[1:24:38] what is the purpose i i asked myself
[1:24:42] i come to church i'm not here to see
[1:24:46] who's here
[1:24:47] lord i come here to see a change in my
[1:24:50] life
[1:24:51] i said lord there are some ways about me
[1:24:54] i just don't like there's some things
[1:24:56] about me
[1:24:57] i know i can't take those things with me
[1:25:00] lord there's
[1:25:01] there's ways about me perhaps the way i
[1:25:03] treat my wife
[1:25:04] that is not like your god i said lord
[1:25:07] god begin to help me
[1:25:09] why because god said you got to die
[1:25:11] accept the corner we
[1:25:12] fall into the ground and die it'll abide
[1:25:16] the law
[1:25:18] i thought of the question getting to
[1:25:21] know him
[1:25:22] going to church do you do you really
[1:25:24] know him
[1:25:26] have you ever had that relationship with
[1:25:28] him can you imagine
[1:25:30] uh uh i know a church i won't call name
[1:25:34] about 500 people but just recently the
[1:25:37] church split
[1:25:39] and the people some went back into the
[1:25:41] world and the same very one
[1:25:43] that came up and sung oh how i love
[1:25:46] jesus
[1:25:47] crying with tears and today where
[1:25:50] earrings and cut their hair
[1:25:52] and going back into the things of the
[1:25:54] world
[1:25:56] what was it she never got to meet him
[1:26:00] she never got to meet the person that's
[1:26:03] what we need to know
[1:26:04] the person of the holy ghost because
[1:26:08] the pressure that's coming on this age
[1:26:11] you got to know him by divine
[1:26:14] revelation if
[1:26:17] if i would ask you the question who is
[1:26:20] the president of the united states

[1:29:55] what about your typos
[1:29:59] i've seen churches where the pastor
[1:30:02] pass and go on i see the people go back
[1:30:05] into the world
[1:30:06] to go back into the things of the world
[1:30:09] i've seen them go back and
[1:30:10] get television get go to movie shows and
[1:30:14] and just do things of the world but all
[1:30:16] of us
[1:30:17] all along why the past was there and let
[1:30:20] me tell you
[1:30:21] if you come into church and look good
[1:30:22] for the past you coming for
[1:30:24] in vain we come to church because we
[1:30:27] love the lord god
[1:30:28] amen amen i don't look at the things of
[1:30:32] the world
[1:30:32] because i i'm afraid my pastor going to
[1:30:35] see me
[1:30:36] i do that because i love the lord jesus
[1:30:38] christ
[1:30:39] amen i flew all the way from north
[1:30:40] carolina amen
[1:30:42] i've come here to tell you amen that
[1:30:45] people better make sure
[1:30:47] that they know that they know that they
[1:30:49] know that they know that they
[1:30:50] know that they have something inside of
[1:30:53] them
[1:30:54] when this translation takes place we're
[1:30:57] going
[1:30:58] you said well brother children i've been
[1:30:59] good oh come on please
[1:31:01] do you know good old boys go to don't go
[1:31:03] to heaven
[1:31:04] good old boy just don't wear the crown
[1:31:06] you got to be born again
[1:31:08] jesus made the steak man amen you must
[1:31:11] be born again
[1:31:12] i know you know my brother a lot of
[1:31:14] folks they they laugh at nicodemus
[1:31:17] the reason they laugh at nicodemus
[1:31:19] nicodemus being a ruler of the jews
[1:31:22] the bible said that nicodemus what came
[1:31:24] to jesus in the daytime
[1:31:27] huh when did he came
[1:31:31] he came at night i wonder why he came at
[1:31:33] night
[1:31:34] you reckon he didn't want to be seen
[1:31:37] well you know folks
[1:31:38] they remember those things but at least
[1:31:40] he came
[1:31:41] some folks don't even come at night some
[1:31:44] people stay home because they're tired
[1:31:46] but
[1:31:46] at least nicodemus came to jesus by
[1:31:49] night
[1:31:50] now i'm sure nicodemus had prestige and
[1:31:53] he didn't want uh folks to see him
[1:31:56] coming at night because he had a high
[1:31:57] position
[1:31:58] but nicodemus came to jesus by night and
[1:32:01] he asked jesus
[1:32:02] i could imagine when he came in let's
[1:32:04] say he came in the room where jesus was
[1:32:06] at he asked him to say
[1:32:07] good master we know that you are a man
[1:32:10] that come from god
[1:32:12] now nicodemus that shows right there
[1:32:14] nicodemus didn't know the godhead
[1:32:17] jesus was god he was emmanuel
[1:32:20] but nicodemus asked the question now
[1:32:23] nicodemus was very
[1:32:25] serious and that's what we got to be
[1:32:27] serious about our salvation
[1:32:29] nicodemus asked the question he said
[1:32:32] master we know that our teacher that
[1:32:34] come from heaven
[1:32:36] for no man could do these miracles that
[1:32:38] thou doest
[1:32:39] or what accept what god be with him
[1:32:44] so nicodemus was curious he was very
[1:32:46] serious
[1:32:47] in his salvation or his walk with god he
[1:32:49] asked a question
[1:32:50] say how can how can a man
[1:32:54] be born when he is old
[1:32:59] hmm he said master can he enter the
[1:33:02] second time
[1:33:03] into his mother's womb now there is
[1:33:06] nicodemus having an intellectual
[1:33:07] conception huh he's trying to figure out
[1:33:12] i'm 200 pounds six foot three how i'm
[1:33:15] going to go back in my mama womb
[1:33:17] and be born again and that's the way a
[1:33:19] lot of us
[1:33:20] amen have an intellectual conception of
[1:33:22] christ
[1:33:23] you can't know him by intellect you got
[1:33:25] to know him by your heart
[1:33:28] the devil choose the head god chooses
[1:33:30] the heart
[1:33:31] i thank god i accept this message by
[1:33:34] with my heart
[1:33:35] with all my heart i believe this message

[1:34:44] we rub
[1:34:45] shoulders with the world the world has
[1:34:46] so much to offer
[1:34:48] but i need to know that he had the power
[1:34:51] that can keep me the power that can
[1:34:54] cause me to turn my head
[1:34:56] a power that can cause me when i hear
[1:34:58] things of the world that's something
[1:35:00] that can block it off amen
[1:35:02] we went in we went into some of the
[1:35:03] restaurant yesterday
[1:35:05] and they had music playing and and my
[1:35:07] brother said uh asked me about it i said
[1:35:09] well i heard it and i don't hear
[1:35:11] and it's called what rock and roll well
[1:35:13] i ain't never fought them devils and i
[1:35:15] was in the world because i
[1:35:16] i never went to the clubs but that don't
[1:35:18] make me no better but i don't have to
[1:35:20] fight
[1:35:21] alcohol i don't have to fight uh smoking
[1:35:23] cigarette those demons can't
[1:35:25] attack me because i've never done those
[1:35:27] things how you hear me
[1:35:28] but the devil knows the weakness and
[1:35:30] that's what he challenged me with
[1:35:32] so that's got to die
[1:35:36] that's that point got to die accept the
[1:35:38] coin you want to die
[1:35:39] you got to go down here you got to die i
[1:35:42] said but
[1:35:43] yeah you got to die you got to
[1:35:47] meet me at calvary but a lot of times
[1:35:50] you know
[1:35:50] we live in an age now amen uh since
[1:35:54] at the church some years ago she told
[1:35:56] the pastor
[1:35:57] uh she was one of the sisters in a high
[1:35:59] position she was a judge
[1:36:01] at that particular time she told the
[1:36:03] pastor said
[1:36:04] oh i she said you mean say you got to
[1:36:07] die
[1:36:08] he said yes you you got to die you and
[1:36:10] she always loved to keep keep her hair
[1:36:12] shaved up and he told her no you're
[1:36:14] supposed to have your hair long a woman
[1:36:16] not supposed to put scissors
[1:36:17] in her head hey man but she said you
[1:36:20] know what past
[1:36:21] she said i've tried and i tried and i
[1:36:23] tried he said what's what's wrong
[1:36:25] she said i try to die but it's hard to
[1:36:28] die when everybody else is living
[1:36:32] and you found out that's what folks does
[1:36:34] when god
[1:36:35] called you as an individual when god
[1:36:37] said you yeah you over here come here my
[1:36:39] sister
[1:36:40] you yell you with the glass song with
[1:36:42] the red come here i want to come
[1:36:44] i want to come into your flesh i want to
[1:36:46] wake up my
[1:36:47] seed and you who me yeah he called you
[1:36:51] he called you see we are not we're not
[1:36:53] jews he didn't call us as a whole he
[1:36:55] called
[1:36:55] us as an individual everybody don't get
[1:36:58] to hear this call
[1:37:00] but i thank god i heard him when he
[1:37:02] called my name
[1:37:03] amen i thank god i ain't just talking
[1:37:05] about the book of isaiah
[1:37:07] amen i heard that he called my name by
[1:37:09] revelation
[1:37:10] and i'm going to follow him all the way
[1:37:13] up set the corner we
[1:37:14] fall into the ground and die it'll abide
[1:37:18] the law
[1:37:20] so nicodemus asked the question how can
[1:37:23] a man be born
[1:37:24] when he's old and jesus said that's
[1:37:26] simple
[1:37:27] that's simple he said uh
[1:37:31] nicodemus he had to share with nicodema
[1:37:35] it's on a spiritual uh application of
[1:37:37] revelation amen
[1:37:39] amen so nicodemus didn't understood
[1:37:42] amen but in order to be born again it
[1:37:45] must be a death
[1:37:46] a burial and resurrection in other words
[1:37:50] amen when i come from out of the world
[1:37:53] do you realize
[1:37:54] amen people come from out of the world
[1:37:56] and i i hope this don't don't hurt
[1:37:59] and and i just wanted to be honest
[1:38:00] because it really hurts my heart
[1:38:03] when i feel like i should have spoke the
[1:38:06] truth
[1:38:06] because i've gone to a place where
[1:38:08] everybody just looked so
[1:38:09] so holy and and sometimes you'd be
[1:38:12] surprised
[1:38:13] what people would do
[1:38:17] i i remember my preacher out of church
[1:38:18] one time and they man
[1:38:20] every time i got close to that sister
[1:38:21] her eyes began to kind of
[1:38:23] look real funny i'm like what's going on
[1:38:25] couldn't find out
[1:38:26] her husband couldn't do nothing with her
[1:38:29] she looked real humbling in the church
[1:38:30] real night but boy when she got home
[1:38:32] she was just as mean as a buzzsaw
[1:38:36] but in church hallelujah praise god
[1:38:39] now jesus loved me it's got to go deeper
[1:38:42] than that
[1:38:43] this holy ghost got to go home the holy
[1:38:45] ghost got to be with me
[1:38:46] everywhere i go can the church say amen
[1:38:49] don't you love him this morning amen
[1:38:51] oh i want to see him just to look upon
[1:38:54] his face
[1:38:55] so nicodemus asked the question how can
[1:38:57] a man be born
[1:38:58] when he is all can he enter the second
[1:39:02] time
[1:39:03] into his mother's womb and be born again
[1:39:06] so jesus had to explain to nicodemus how
[1:39:09] did it have to be a death
[1:39:11] a burial and a resurrection
[1:39:15] and i found out following jesus
[1:39:19] little by little he takes the appetites
[1:39:23] of the world completely away from me
[1:39:29] nobody can do that but jesus
[1:39:34] nobody and the more i follow him
[1:39:37] the more the things start dropping away
[1:39:40] i used to wonder how can i get over this
[1:39:43] how can i get over there i don't want
[1:39:44] nobody to know
[1:39:46] you know i'm a minister i'm a christian
[1:39:48] i don't want nobody to know i got this
[1:39:50] weakness
[1:39:51] but you know what i did i learn to
[1:39:53] follow him
[1:39:54] and the more i follow him little by
[1:39:57] little things begin to drop off
[1:40:00] can somebody say hallelujah hallelujah i
[1:40:02] thank god for his grace
[1:40:04] i thank god for his race um you know i'm
[1:40:07] so happy mother
[1:40:08] i don't have to come to church and
[1:40:09] impersonate nothing
[1:40:11] i am what i am by the grace of god i
[1:40:14] don't buy god's grace i don't have no
[1:40:16] skeleton in closet
[1:40:18] i don't have no girlfriends on the side
[1:40:20] i i i
[1:40:22] got one wife and i got three sweet
[1:40:24] daughters and that's all i need and i
[1:40:26] got six grand
[1:40:27] so i'm not trying to come up here and
[1:40:29] preach you a good sermon
[1:40:30] because there's a god that can see all
[1:40:32] things amen i fear the lord
[1:40:35] the bible says to fear the lord it's the
[1:40:37] beginning of wisdom
[1:40:39] with wisdom entering to the heart the
[1:40:41] knowledge is pleasant to thy soul
[1:40:44] oh god i love you oh how i want to serve
[1:40:47] you
[1:40:47] i just want to please you that's my
[1:40:50] heart desire
[1:40:51] lord i just want to please you and i
[1:40:53] just want to tell the people
[1:40:55] make sure the prophet god preach a
[1:40:57] message
[1:40:58] be certain of god be certain of god
[1:41:02] brother i knew within myself i knew
[1:41:05] there was
[1:41:05] something that i need to get over how
[1:41:07] have you ever been there before
[1:41:09] this is something that's bothering me
[1:41:12] and i need to get over that weakness
[1:41:14] you say brother children is is is it
[1:41:17] somebody you uh got hatred again
[1:41:19] no i don't i don't wrestle that because
[1:41:22] i don't worry about my enemy my enemies
[1:41:24] can't harm me
[1:41:26] my enemy is this flash right here amen
[1:41:29] that's the one that tells me bad things
[1:41:31] amen
[1:41:32] but i said god i must die in order to
[1:41:36] walk this walk because
[1:41:37] you don't want to be half stepping you
[1:41:40] want to be a
[1:41:41] a true genuine christian in the church
[1:41:44] and out of the church you said brother
[1:41:45] children why are you talking like that
[1:41:47] i'm trying to tell folks today amen it's
[1:41:50] no time to impersonate
[1:41:51] because the pressure is coming on amen
[1:41:54] as time go on it's getting worse and
[1:41:56] worse
[1:41:56] we never thought we're living a time
[1:41:58] where we got the word masses
[1:42:02] did you ever thought that did you ever
[1:42:04] thought my brother
[1:42:05] you walk in the bank with a mask on your
[1:42:07] face and they'll tell you to come up
[1:42:13] we're living in that time prayerless
[1:42:16] time
[1:42:17] and the bible said paul said in in
[1:42:19] timothy 3
[1:42:20] that prayerless times should come and
[1:42:23] that's what he said
[1:42:25] the prophet of god said pearls
[1:42:27] pearlescence
[1:42:28] intellectual conception paul picks it up
[1:42:30] and said prayerless times second timothy
[1:42:32] 3.
[1:42:33] perilous mean dangerous
[1:42:37] in other words people
[1:42:40] instead of their accepting god
[1:42:44] and dying if they don't die then they'll
[1:42:48] go on
[1:42:49] and the prophet god said they become
[1:42:51] religious
[1:42:53] and when you become religious i i know
[1:42:55] this message may not
[1:42:56] it may be better tonight but look when
[1:42:58] you become religious then nobody can
[1:43:00] tell you nothing you feel fine
[1:43:02] just the way you are and do you know the
[1:43:04] prophet god said a religious spirit is
[1:43:06] five times worse than any spirit there
[1:43:08] is
[1:43:08] i said god don't let me be religious
[1:43:10] amen but let me be the genuine one
[1:43:13] holy ghost a man so i can look the devil
[1:43:16] right in the
[1:43:16] eye and say you get off of my ground you
[1:43:19] don't have a right
[1:43:20] to get on my sister why because it's a
[1:43:23] son of god
[1:43:24] a daughter of god that is speaking to
[1:43:25] you why because i've been born again
[1:43:29] the old man has died old man has died
[1:43:32] i used to tell folks hey man if you see
[1:43:35] me don't don't don't
[1:43:36] don't wonder so much if you if you see
[1:43:38] me every time i open my car trump
[1:43:41] trunk or you look in the back of my
[1:43:42] truck i got a shovel back there
[1:43:44] he said brother children what are you
[1:43:45] doing with a shovel i thought you come
[1:43:48] up here to preach
[1:43:48] what what are you digging i said well
[1:43:51] what i got a shovel for
[1:43:52] i'm burying me every day
[1:43:56] then paul said we got to die daily ain't
[1:43:59] nothing good an old wretched man of mine
[1:44:01] ain't nothing good about this flight i
[1:44:03] was just thinking the other day the lord
[1:44:04] was just speaking to me
[1:44:05] that all flesh is as grass
[1:44:09] your flesh is just like my flesh huh
[1:44:12] we all is dirt your dirt is light mind a
[1:44:15] little darker
[1:44:16] but we are there huh are you with me
[1:44:20] i'm just being real hey man you know
[1:44:22] sometimes folks come to church they feel
[1:44:24] like they look better
[1:44:25] you know because their hair more slicker
[1:44:27] and uh uh that don't mean nothing they
[1:44:29] man
[1:44:29] hey man you can have sleek hair you can
[1:44:32] have curly hair you can have nappy hair
[1:44:34] if your heart ain't right hey man you go
[1:44:37] you're gonna be left behind
[1:44:39] so look there ain't nothing good in this
[1:44:41] flash
[1:44:44] brother i uh pardon me i just i'll just
[1:44:46] be at home can i be at home that's the
[1:44:47] best way to be
[1:44:48] amen i'm not trying to be this brother
[1:44:50] or that brother i just being brother
[1:44:52] children
[1:44:52] i found out that this old stinking flesh
[1:44:54] and a bitter good
[1:44:57] i took a shower last night and got up
[1:44:59] this morning wiped with a rag it's still
[1:45:01] dirty
[1:45:04] nothing but dirt what is this
[1:45:08] but there's something in the inside with
[1:45:10] a control towel
[1:45:11] which is that so something in the inside
[1:45:14] is hungry and thirsty for god
[1:45:18] do you love the lord i don't want to
[1:45:20] hold you along
[1:45:21] but accept that corner we fall into the
[1:45:24] ground and die
[1:45:25] in 1961 brother brown will preach you
[1:45:28] must be born again
[1:45:29] now let me say this right here i
[1:45:32] remember back in 19
[1:45:34] or 2007 i was riding to work early one
[1:45:37] morning
[1:45:38] and i was listening at the message uh
[1:45:41] the prophet of god preached you must be
[1:45:42] born again
[1:45:44] now i'm going to say that to say what
[1:45:46] i'm getting into
[1:45:47] amen so the prophet god preached a
[1:45:49] message you must be born again
[1:45:52] wow that's that's good but then he read
[1:45:55] john 3
[1:45:56] but then he went to ephesians 4 and 11.
[1:45:59] and i'm trying to figure out
[1:46:01] what ephesians 4 and 11 got to do with
[1:46:03] you must be born again
[1:46:06] let that soak what does ephesians 4 in a
[1:46:10] level
[1:46:11] have to do with john 3 16.
[1:46:15] prophet why do you read john 3 ephesians
[1:46:18] 4 and 11
[1:46:20] and ties it with john 3 16.
[1:46:23] so after the lord gave me this thought
[1:46:26] you know how the bible said that how the
[1:46:29] greeks
[1:46:30] there was there was great ark athletes
[1:46:34] and uh there was well-known people
[1:46:39] but you know the greeks they they they
[1:46:42] wanted to see
[1:46:43] jesus and the prophet god said the
[1:46:46] reason they wanted to see jesus because
[1:46:48] they heard about lazarus
[1:46:53] they heard about a man that was dead for
[1:46:54] four days
[1:46:59] and he was alive we want to see him
[1:47:03] and the bible said in romans that faith
[1:47:06] coming by what hearing the word
[1:47:10] what word it's the word for your day
[1:47:13] that's what gives us rapture and faith
[1:47:16] if that's right
[1:47:17] are we right is the word right it's
[1:47:21] hearing the word
[1:47:22] for your day so i goes on
[1:47:26] hearing the word for your day well the
[1:47:29] prophet of god said many of them
[1:47:31] came to see jesus because they they came
[1:47:33] because of the miracles
[1:47:35] do you know a lot of people serve god
[1:47:37] because god is good to them gave them a
[1:47:39] new car and home and called
[1:47:41] i don't care if he don't give me nothing
[1:47:43] i'm still going to serve him with all of
[1:47:45] my heart
[1:47:46] i'm still going to love him amen with
[1:47:48] all of my heart
[1:47:50] but so the greeks they they they
[1:47:53] they wanted to see jesus my question is
[1:47:58] do you want to see him do you really
[1:47:59] know him you don't have to raise your
[1:48:02] hand
[1:48:03] but do you really know him did you
[1:48:06] really have a relationship with him
[1:48:08] since you've been coming all these years
[1:48:10] do you really know him
[1:48:12] oh brother children i know i know him
[1:48:14] sure you do
[1:48:19] do you know him in the power of his
[1:48:22] resurrection the fellowshipping of his
[1:48:24] suffering
[1:48:26] i want to demonstrate something here
[1:48:30] let me read this to you that be all
[1:48:32] right brother
[1:48:33] let me read this to you and this kind of
[1:48:37] kind of help us a little bit in 1954
[1:48:41] the assembly of god phoenix arizona
[1:48:44] my the prophet of god the prophet of god
[1:48:47] said no matter how much you've been
[1:48:48] going to church
[1:48:50] how well is your name is engraved on its
[1:48:52] stained windows
[1:48:53] or on his books it never means nothing
[1:48:55] to you
[1:48:56] until you are and witness of the
[1:48:58] resurrection
[1:48:59] of jesus christ and by the infilling of
[1:49:02] the power of the holy spirit
[1:49:04] you are taking somebody else's word well
[1:49:07] brother browner i know that jesus
[1:49:09] is christ because the bible says so the
[1:49:12] bible is right
[1:49:13] but what do you know about it see it's
[1:49:16] an
[1:49:16] individual affair with every individual
[1:49:19] then i say that with every individual a
[1:49:22] personal
[1:49:23] witness that every person must have
[1:49:26] in order to know that jesus christ is
[1:49:29] the son of god
[1:49:30] is when his spirit bear record with your
[1:49:33] spirit
[1:49:34] in the spirit of the new birth
[1:49:38] born again and you cry out of a father
[1:49:40] oh my if we had a world like that
[1:49:43] tonight
[1:49:45] the millennium would be on wouldn't it
[1:49:47] that's right when you
[1:49:48] the spirit buried record with his spirit
[1:49:51] that you
[1:49:52] the son and the daughter of god now the
[1:49:54] reason i
[1:49:55] read uh the prophet of god the lord was
[1:49:57] showing me
[1:49:58] ephesians 4 and 11. and brother branham
[1:50:01] as he go along
[1:50:03] he was saying that ephesians 4 11 we all
[1:50:06] familiar with that
[1:50:07] the bible talk about uh he sent uh
[1:50:10] someone asked a question
[1:50:12] in the uh one of the in the seal book
[1:50:14] page 494
[1:50:15] 495 they asked a question that was
[1:50:18] sincere
[1:50:19] let's say we're the bride of christ they
[1:50:21] asked brother brown
[1:50:22] will the bride of christ have a a a
[1:50:25] ministry
[1:50:26] what before the rapture
[1:50:30] he said yes it's consisted of and he
[1:50:32] goes on to say the pastor the teacher
[1:50:34] the evangelical song
[1:50:35] he said amen he said but it would be so
[1:50:38] humble
[1:50:39] catch that it'll be so humble we talked
[1:50:41] about that
[1:50:42] it'll be so humble so
[1:50:45] i'm saying that it'll be so humble
[1:50:49] so the prophet of god said we'll have
[1:50:53] he says now i say that to say this
[1:50:56] now when the greeks came to philip
[1:51:00] what was the purpose of they coming to
[1:51:02] philip
[1:51:04] because they knew that philip knew
[1:51:06] exactly
[1:51:07] how to get to jesus now what i'm trying
[1:51:11] to say
[1:51:12] you you need to know you need to have a
[1:51:15] man of god
[1:51:16] that knows or having a relationship with
[1:51:19] god
[1:51:20] not preaching on what somebody else said
[1:51:23] not because william brown was a prophet
[1:51:25] but he got to know that by divine
[1:51:28] revelation
[1:51:29] if he don't it's going to be a shipwreck
[1:51:31] down the road he's going to say he's
[1:51:33] gonna denounce this message
[1:51:34] i've seen it happen church i've seen 30
[1:51:37] years
[1:51:38] preaching this message and get to a day
[1:51:40] where they said his message is false
[1:51:42] i've seen the brother say take the half
[1:51:44] my head off of the wall
[1:51:46] take every everything out of the book
[1:51:48] that's talking about william branham
[1:51:49] he has caused us nothing but problems
[1:51:52] but years down the road
[1:51:53] he said william brandon was god's
[1:51:54] prophet see the devil knows that
[1:51:57] so you got to make sure i know him by
[1:51:59] revelation
[1:52:00] ain't nobody told me i know that
[1:52:05] so the prophet god said that some
[1:52:08] that that'll paint you a uh uh a painted
[1:52:11] fire
[1:52:13] they'll let you know my sister my sister
[1:52:15] you look real nice just got to be your
[1:52:17] husband
[1:52:18] you look real kind you you look so sweet
[1:52:21] i'll tell you
[1:52:22] and says you just be nice to your
[1:52:24] husband and now
[1:52:26] that's the holy ghost that is a false
[1:52:30] birth
[1:52:32] just being kind is not good enough if
[1:52:35] that soul didn't change
[1:52:37] amen you're not going can i just be
[1:52:39] plain like that
[1:52:40] so the prophet of god saying they'll
[1:52:43] give you a fourth birth
[1:52:44] i've known i know brother i've known
[1:52:48] i've seen brothers that amen they that
[1:52:50] you know
[1:52:51] they you should love your pastor i mean
[1:52:53] you should love him
[1:52:54] my mind did that day you know uh he they
[1:52:57] they they
[1:52:58] they they want to shoot his coat his hat
[1:53:00] and hey man they want to be like him
[1:53:02] i don't want to be like no man i want to
[1:53:04] be like a man i don't want to be like me
[1:53:06] i don't even like me but i don't like me
[1:53:11] you like you
[1:53:17] but i've seen i've seen brother be nice
[1:53:20] to the past and bring his coat give him
[1:53:21] water
[1:53:22] brother that's the holy ghost is it
[1:53:26] really
[1:53:26] that ain't what jesus said jesus said
[1:53:29] because you cared to pass a cup of water
[1:53:31] and give him a cake on his birthday
[1:53:33] jesus said what
[1:53:34] you got to be born again
[1:53:40] you got to be born again you got to have
[1:53:42] an experience
[1:53:43] let me let me maybe i'll do this right

[2:05:39] calvary
[2:05:41] do you think god you are identified with
[2:05:43] his death
[2:05:45] his barrier and his resurrection
[2:05:53] there was a man that went to this museum
[2:05:56] i maybe have the story a little wrong
[2:05:59] and we went to this museum museum there
[2:06:02] was different
[2:06:03] paintings of pictures different statues
[2:06:06] and
[2:06:06] things of that nature but he had this
[2:06:10] man
[2:06:10] that's called a guide and this gentleman
[2:06:13] would take him around and show him the
[2:06:14] different pictures
[2:06:16] the painting but it came to this one
[2:06:19] particular painting or statue
[2:06:23] and it was the statue of the painting of
[2:06:25] the lord jesus christ
[2:06:28] this man looked at it and he said within
[2:06:31] himself
[2:06:33] what an artist what is this
[2:06:37] he began to mock this picture or this
[2:06:40] painting
[2:06:41] he didn't seem much to him
[2:06:44] and the guy told him said sir
[2:06:47] there's a there's a sign right beneath
[2:06:49] that picture or that painting
[2:06:52] says it means and that on that on that
[2:06:55] little sign it says it's not made to
[2:06:57] stand off and stare
[2:07:00] it's made to kneel down and look up
[2:07:05] i might be in bits and pieces but you
[2:07:07] put it together
[2:07:09] my whole heart is for god's people
[2:07:14] we're in an hour where the greatest
[2:07:16] battle that was ever fought
[2:07:18] that was in the mind but i thank god for
[2:07:21] the holy ghost
[2:07:22] in this hour that can keep me from all
[2:07:26] temptation of the enemy but with that
[2:07:29] man he walked up and he
[2:07:31] said what's the use he he knelt down
[2:07:35] when he knelt down he looked up and the
[2:07:40] prophet god said when he looked up
[2:07:42] every bone in his body almost paralyzed
[2:07:45] him
[2:07:47] when he seen the pain and the suffering
[2:07:51] and the agony that jesus went through
[2:07:56] and today i could thank god for his
[2:07:58] grace
[2:08:00] today i could thank god i love him
[2:08:05] because he first loved me
[2:08:08] i love him because he chose me
[2:08:11] before the foundation of the world
[2:08:15] i love him because he put my name on the
[2:08:17] lamb book of light before there was a
[2:08:19] world
[2:08:20] i thank god i was a thought that was in
[2:08:22] his mind
[2:08:23] before there was a world i thank god the
[2:08:26] lamb was slain
[2:08:28] before i got here because god knew that
[2:08:31] we'll live here
[2:08:33] in this dark age of laodicea was people
[2:08:36] right
[2:08:37] when the pressure of this age the love
[2:08:39] of this world
[2:08:41] so man has fallen away the love of many
[2:08:43] are whites and cold

[2:13:40] his brother isaiah was finishing up
[2:13:42] there
[2:13:44] he said slain from before the foundation
[2:13:47] of the world
[2:13:49] he had already made provision for this
[2:13:53] and it just came to my mind
[2:13:57] way back in the creation in the garden
[2:14:00] of eden
[2:14:02] god had already had a lamb in the garden
[2:14:05] of eden
[2:14:08] he had already made provision for what
[2:14:10] was going to happen
[2:14:12] [Music]
[2:14:13] knowing that they were going to need a
[2:14:16] blood covering
[2:14:18] they were going to try to cover
[2:14:19] themselves with their own religion
[2:14:22] with fig leaves but there was a lamb
[2:14:26] in the garden who was going to take
[2:14:30] an innocent life was going to be shed
[2:14:34] and that's what he did on calvary for
[2:14:36] you and that's what he did on calvary
[2:14:39] for me he's already made provision
[2:14:43] you say it's so hard to die it is
[2:14:47] this flesh doesn't want to die
[2:14:50] but he's already had a life prepared
[2:14:53] that when
[2:14:54] this one dies that other life can come
[2:14:56] through
[2:14:57] we spoke of that on wednesday night
[2:14:59] standing in the in the courts of god

[2:15:08] cross
[2:15:10] what is being near the cross as a
[2:15:12] spectator
[2:15:13] no by giving your life there were those
[2:15:16] who watched
[2:15:18] the death of god but it didn't affect
[2:15:22] them
[2:15:23] it didn't mean anything well if you're
[2:15:25] if you're really the son of god then get
[2:15:27] off that crossing
[2:15:28] and save yourself but there were others
[2:15:30] who realize
[2:15:32] that this this one was going into the
[2:15:34] ground
[2:15:35] to give me life amen
[2:15:39] let's sing that chorus one more time

[2:16:44] willing to give it up
