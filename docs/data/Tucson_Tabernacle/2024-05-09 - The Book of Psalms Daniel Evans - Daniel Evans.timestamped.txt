[13:12] and I had mentioned it to my
[13:15] wife when the change
[13:18] came when Adam and Eve had done

[19:25] His Ho
[19:31] you may be seated sister Martha
[19:34] has something
[19:37] prepared all
[19:39] right there was a heart back there and I
[19:42] didn't just kind of wondering and and
[19:45] sister
[19:54] Martha so I'm not super proficient but I
[19:57] figured this is Psalms he played the
[19:59] harp so it kind of fit and also this is
[20:04] one of the Psalms that is probably one
[20:07] that we're fairly mostly familiar with
[20:10] because it's this Psalm 51 where he is
[20:13] after Nathan the prophet has dealt with
[20:16] him um with his out with his dealings
[20:20] with Bas Sheba and him falling on his
[20:23] face before the
[20:24] Lord and I love reading the Psalms when
[20:27] I'm especially just low because because
[20:29] sometimes or you know let's be honest
[20:31] sometimes when we're upset too because
[20:32] we're like yes David go get him avenge
[20:34] me of my enemies um but when we're
[20:37] feeling down and when we're feeling low
[20:39] um like reading the Psalms and reading
[20:42] David's cries and just there's no other
[20:45] way that it could have been worded where
[20:47] it was better and so um this was just a
[20:51] song that was simple enough for me to
[20:53] play but it still is a song that um
[20:57] means a lot in times where I just feel
[21:00] like I'm crying out to
[21:04] God pray for me
[21:18] [Music]
[21:32] create in me a clean
[21:37] heart oh
[21:42] God and renew a right Spirit within
[21:47] [Music]
[21:50] me create in me a clean
[21:57] heart oh oh

[22:34] me the joy of th
[22:37] [Music]

[36:04] you heavenly father if we could
[36:08] just be still and know that you are
[36:13] God lord as we open up this book of
[36:17] Psalms
[36:19] tonight know that it is written truly by
[36:23] people that that did know you
[36:28] Lord if we could have just a taste of
[36:31] what they
[36:32] had Grant it Lord and I pray that your
[36:35] anointing would be here
[36:38] tonight the wisdom
[36:40] would come forward an explanation and an
[36:46] understanding in Jesus name we pray amen
[36:50] amen you can be
[36:53] seated beautiful song sister Martha I
[36:58] felt really like I felt the presence of
[37:00] the Holy Spirit as you were singing that
[37:03] that song and playing on the harp that
[37:04] was so
[37:07] beautiful did remind me of
[37:10] David there and you can
[37:12] see how King Saul and all of his rage
[37:17] would be calmed at something like that
[37:20] just it's just beautiful and I did I
[37:23] felt like just felt the presence of the
[37:25] Lord as she was singing and it create in
[37:28] me a clean heart renew a right Spirit
[37:30] Within
[37:32] Me This Book of
[37:34] Psalms is
[37:38] uh it's a powerful and it's a it's a
[37:41] wonderful
[37:43] book it's a book of 150 different poems
[37:46] and songs and prayers that came from all
[37:50] different times in
[37:53] history it was put together after
[37:58] Israel after their exile to Babylon by
[38:01] who we don't know who put it
[38:04] together um but it's probably the most
[38:07] read
[38:08] book and most quoted book in all the
[38:11] Bible so the words that we are reading
[38:14] tonight have probably been read more
[38:16] than any other words in the history of
[38:20] of
[38:22] mankind sister Lily it's good to have
[38:25] you back God bless you welcome
[38:29] home
[38:31] um it's this book of Psalms it's it's
[38:34] the
[38:35] second in what is described as the
[38:39] poetical books we've gone through the
[38:42] first 17 books of the Bible we started
[38:45] in Genesis we got all the way through
[38:48] Nehemiah and Esther those are considered
[38:51] the historic books not that we think of
[38:54] them as just history of course we know
[38:57] that they're the word of God but they
[39:00] they tell a whole lot of history of the
[39:02] world from the very beginning all the
[39:05] way to after the
[39:07] Captivity then it moves then the Bible
[39:10] moves into this other set of books so
[39:13] those all go together and that's how you
[39:15] can have books that uh they don't seem
[39:18] like they're in
[39:19] order but the Bible is compiled in
[39:24] different sections as I said those first
[39:26] 17 are the historic books and now we are
[39:29] getting in to What's called the poetical
[39:32] books they start with the Book of
[39:36] Job then they go through psalms
[39:40] and um
[39:42] Proverbs all the way down to Song of
[39:44] Solomon and some so there's five books
[39:47] there and some also put in the
[39:49] Lamentations of Jeremiah into those
[39:52] books they um they're called
[39:57] the well these poetical books as I said
[40:00] they're not written like the historic
[40:02] books you can just open up the book of
[40:05] Psalms as sister Martha sang or or
[40:07] brother Josiah sang or brother Aaron
[40:09] sang you can open it up and you don't
[40:12] need a background you don't really need
[40:15] to know what's going on you can just
[40:17] open up that book and you can start
[40:19] reading and you can be right in there
[40:22] well that's hard to do with any other
[40:24] books in the Bible so these these
[40:26] poetical books they're they're meant to
[40:30] they're not meant to give us a history
[40:33] they're and they're not meant to place
[40:35] us in a period of time and neither and
[40:37] it doesn't really matter when they're
[40:39] written they teach us a Les lesson and a
[40:43] wisdom that is
[40:46] timeless they're considered poetry and
[40:49] songs because they're written in a
[40:52] certain form and they're written with a
[40:54] Hebrew Cadence in that form they might
[40:58] tell a certain thing that's happened but
[41:01] the main objective of the author is
[41:04] praise and worship and to teach a lesson
[41:09] and not to tell a story as I said it's
[41:12] written in what's called Hebrew po
[41:14] poetry and it's not poetry like like we
[41:17] would understand it's called it's
[41:18] written in Hebrew songs and they're not
[41:20] songs like we would think it's it's not
[41:24] it doesn't have a rhyme To The Rhythm
[41:27] like we're used to it's that's not the
[41:29] way they wrote their worship they they
[41:31] use thoughts and ideas like we use words
[41:35] that sound similar they use thoughts and
[41:38] ideas and those thoughts and ideas they
[41:41] would compare and contrast those in a
[41:44] certain statement and that produces the
[41:47] rhythm of the song or the rhythm of the
[41:51] poem one one thought will support
[41:55] another thought or it will contrast
[41:58] another thought and it'll be a little
[42:01] bit more this will be a little bit more
[42:03] evident when we get into Proverbs in
[42:04] fact let's let's read out of Proverbs
[42:07] quickly and I I'll show you how that
[42:09] goes let's go to Proverbs uh really it's
[42:12] it's you can do any of them how about
[42:15] proverbs
[42:17] 17
[42:21] um yeah Proverbs 1710 is a good one now
[42:25] watch watch the back and forth
[42:28] and I'll just read it off the screen
[42:29] here a reproof entereth more into a wise
[42:33] man than aund Stripes into a fool back
[42:37] and forth verse
[42:40] 11 an evil man seeketh only Rebellion
[42:45] therefore a cruel messenger shall be
[42:47] sent against
[42:48] him let a
[42:50] bear robbed of her welps meet a man
[42:54] rather than a fool in his folly who so
[42:57] WTH evil for good evil shall not depart
[43:00] from his house do you see the back and
[43:02] forth and the Cadence that that's in
[43:05] these poetical books the Western Way
[43:08] would be to for a song it would be like
[43:12] Jesus loves me this I know for the Bible
[43:16] tells me so little ones to him belong
[43:19] they are weak but he is strong that's
[43:23] that's the way we are used to singing
[43:25] and we are used to poetry but but
[43:27] instead of
[43:29] rhyming its thoughts comparing and
[43:33] contrasting different statements I'd
[43:36] like to show brother Jordan I gave you a
[43:38] two pictures of the English Standard
[43:40] Version and the King James version of a
[43:43] of a Psalm maybe go to the second one I
[43:47] gave you um and when you look at these
[43:51] Psalms when you're reading them this is
[43:53] a Bible this is our Bible Lesson so this
[43:56] is um
[43:58] I'm going to teach you a little bit more
[43:59] about the Bible here we have the King
[44:02] James version doesn't make an effort to
[44:07] preserve that back and forth Cadence of
[44:12] um the the Psalms and the Proverbs and
[44:14] the poetical books most other
[44:16] translations do and you can see here
[44:19] Psalm 24 if you look on the left
[44:22] side it says lift up your head heads oh
[44:24] Gates and and then there's a pause and
[44:27] be ye lifted up o ancient doors that the
[44:30] king of glory may come in who is the
[44:32] king of glory the lord strong and mighty
[44:36] the Lord Mighty in battle see that on
[44:39] the on the left side there it's broken
[44:42] up while the King James version will
[44:45] just take the um the number and it will
[44:49] just write it out with the punctuation
[44:52] most other translations will go to a
[44:54] next line and it's telling you that's
[44:56] where you pause
[44:57] and that's where the original um pause
[45:01] was in the poem
[45:04] um and then thank you brother Jordan I
[45:06] just wanted to show the difference so if
[45:08] you're reading another translation other
[45:10] than King James you might see some
[45:13] indentation in that type of thing and
[45:16] it's meant for the reader to repeat the
[45:20] psalm like that the um you'll come
[45:23] across words like ca in the Book of
[45:27] Psalms and that's like a hard stop it's
[45:30] getting you to stop for a minute I I'll
[45:32] cover that in a little while this book
[45:35] of Psalms it covers about a thousand
[45:39] years Jesus quoted the Psalms 11
[45:42] times and that's more than any other Old
[45:45] Testament book it's more than any other
[45:47] book that Jesus quoted there are at
[45:49] least 17 Messianic psalms about the
[45:52] future Messiah his birth his life his
[45:55] death and his resurrection
[45:59] and so what's neat is this means that
[46:01] Through the Ages the Jews were singing
[46:04] about Jesus even they didn't know it wow
[46:08] there um there are five books in the
[46:12] Psalms and this is one of those things
[46:14] that you probably didn't know if you
[46:15] turn I want everybody you're going to
[46:17] have to use your Bibles today because
[46:19] brother Jordan's not going to be able to
[46:20] show you this but if you go to the Book
[46:23] of Psalms and you go to the very
[46:25] first chapter
[46:27] chapter you'll
[46:31] see that it says book one
[46:36] yeah there's five books within the book
[46:39] of
[46:40] Psalms and each one of those is has
[46:44] certain
[46:46] characteristics book
[46:49] one Psalms 1-
[46:52] 41 there's songs about relationship
[46:57] and there songs about communion between
[47:00] God and man now it's a general theme of
[47:03] the first book of Psalms which is as I
[47:07] said Psalm
[47:09] 1-41 and most scholars believe that each
[47:13] of these five books each of these five
[47:16] books within Psalms they
[47:18] correspond to other books that are in
[47:21] the Bible so if you look at book one and
[47:24] it's about a relationship with with God
[47:27] and it's it's about communion between
[47:29] God and man can you think of the the
[47:33] book in the
[47:34] Bible before
[47:36] this that was just the best communion
[47:41] that we see in all of the Bible between
[47:43] God and man which one would you
[47:47] think how about in the Garden of Eden
[47:50] Genesis so we look at book
[47:52] one it corresponds and has the same
[47:56] feeling as Genesis then we go to book
[47:58] two over to um Psalm 42 starts book two
[48:03] and it speaks about Deliverance by God
[48:06] and about bringing people out of bondage
[48:09] what book of the Bible do you think that
[48:10] one would correlate to
[48:13] Exodus then in book
[48:16] three it talks about the sanctuary of
[48:19] God and and it talks about the the
[48:22] temple and and the worship so what do
[48:25] you think book three would be about
[48:29] Leviticus you're singing a a pattern
[48:32] here now book four talks about
[48:35] rebellion against God that's Psalm 90
[48:39] through
[48:40] 106 similar to The Book of
[48:42] Numbers and then book five renewal with
[48:47] God which closes out the Torah in
[48:51] Deuteronomy so the first five books of
[48:55] Psalms the only five book books of
[48:57] Psalms correlate very closely with
[49:00] Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers and
[49:04] Deuteronomy each
[49:06] book ends with a blessing or an
[49:11] amen so in book
[49:14] one Psalm one all the way through some
[49:17] people don't put Psalm 1 and two in uh
[49:21] into book one uh most people do some but
[49:25] uh book one ends in Psalm 41 and it ends
[49:29] in 13 and it says this Psalm 41:13
[49:33] blessed be the Lord God of Israel from
[49:35] Everlasting and to Everlasting amen and
[49:39] amen closed book one then we go to book
[49:44] two and it ends in Psalm
[49:46] 72 and it ends Psalm 72:19 says and
[49:50] blessed be his glorious name
[49:52] forever and let the whole earth be
[49:55] filled with his glory amen and
[49:57] amen the prayers of David the son of
[50:00] jessier
[50:01] ended then book three it ends Psalm
[50:06] 89 verse 52 blessed be the Lord forever
[50:10] more amen and amen some of these get two
[50:14] amens book four Psalm
[50:17] 106 verse 47 save us oh Lord Our God and
[50:20] gather us from among the Heathen to give
[50:23] thanks unto thy holy name and to Triumph
[50:25] in thy praise
[50:27] blessed be the Lord God of Israel from
[50:29] Everlasting to Everlasting and let all
[50:31] the people say amen praise ye the Lord
[50:35] so that one gets
[50:37] both then book five and I'll just read
[50:41] the entire last book last Psalm in the
[50:45] last book of Psalm Psalm 150 it says
[50:48] praise ye the Lord praise God in his
[50:50] Sanctuary Praise Him in the firmament of
[50:53] his power praise him for his mighty acts
[50:55] Praise Him according to his excellent
[50:57] greatness praise him with the sound of
[50:59] the trumpet praise him with the Sultry
[51:01] and
[51:02] harp praise him with the tempal and
[51:05] dance praise him with stringed
[51:07] instruments and organs Praise Him upon
[51:09] the loud symbols Praise Him upon the
[51:11] high sounding symbols let everything
[51:14] that hath breath praise the Lord praise
[51:17] the
[51:18] Lord that is the that is the spirit of
[51:23] the book of
[51:25] Psalms beautiful
[51:27] the
[51:28] Psalms were Prayed by people who
[51:33] understood that God was the
[51:35] center not their feelings not their
[51:38] situations not their
[51:40] frustrations but they
[51:42] knew God himself and they knew he was
[51:45] the deliverer they knew that he was
[51:47] worthy of Praise Jesus taught in the
[51:51] Lord's Prayer he taught us what to
[51:54] say and he taught us how to pray but the
[51:57] Psalms they teach us the spirit that we
[52:01] should pray in perfectly in order with
[52:05] the New Testament and these Psalms
[52:07] really get the
[52:10] people just down on their knees and
[52:12] praying just like that song that sister
[52:14] Martha sang was just was just so sweet
[52:18] and that's the presence of the Holy
[52:20] Spirit as you are praying in these
[52:22] Psalms just reading them really brings
[52:25] the spirit
[52:27] Psalm
[52:29] 30 says this I will extol thee Oh Lord
[52:32] for thou Hast Lifted Me Up and Hast not
[52:35] made my foes to Rejoice over me oh Lord
[52:38] my God I Cried unto thee and thou Hast
[52:41] healed me oh Lord thou Hast brought up
[52:44] my soul from the grave thou has kept me
[52:46] alive that I should not go down into the
[52:48] pit sing unto the Lord all ye Saints of
[52:51] his and give thanks at the remembrance
[52:53] of his Holiness for his anger and Earth
[52:56] for a moment but for a
[52:59] moment in his favor is life weeping may
[53:03] endure for a night but joy cometh in the
[53:08] morning and in my Prosperity I said I
[53:11] shall never be moved Lord by thy favor
[53:15] thou Hast made my Mountain to stand
[53:17] strong thou didst hide thy face and I
[53:20] was troubled I cried to thee Oh Lord and
[53:24] unto the Lord I made supplication
[53:27] what profit is there in my blood when I
[53:29] go down to the pit shall the dust praise
[53:33] thee shall it declare thy truth here oh
[53:36] Lord and have mercy upon me Lord be thou
[53:40] my helper thou Hast turned from me my
[53:44] mourning into dancing and thou has put
[53:46] off my sackcloth and girded me with GL
[53:49] with gladness to the end that my glory
[53:52] may sing praise to thee and not be
[53:55] silent oh Lord my my God I will give
[53:57] Thee I will give thanks unto thee
[54:01] forever that's
[54:03] worship
[54:05] beautiful the Psalms were composed as I
[54:09] said over a period of approximately a
[54:11] thousand
[54:13] years so it wasn't just one author that
[54:16] we have in the Psalms can
[54:19] anyone tell me who one of the authors in
[54:22] the Psalms
[54:23] were David very good
[54:27] David wrote 73
[54:31] Psalms give me another one ASAP Asaf do
[54:35] you know who Asaf was he was David's
[54:37] worship leader Asaf wrote 12 of the
[54:42] Psalms the sons of
[54:45] Kora Levites wrote
[54:47] 12 Solomon the son of David he wrote too
[54:52] he got in there too Psalm 72 and Psalm
[54:55] 12 27 let's see let's let's uh let's

[55:06] a house they labor in vain that build it
[55:09] except the Lord keep the city The
[55:12] Watchman waketh but in vain it is vain
[55:15] for you to rise up early to sit up late
[55:19] to eat the bread of Sorrows for so he
[55:22] giveth his beloved sleep
[55:26] so quit staying up late on your
[55:30] phones did I say that out
[55:34] loud quit staying up too
[55:38] late let me read that read that again so
[55:40] I can get my words out of there it is
[55:42] vain for you to rise up early and to sit
[55:44] up late to eat the bread of Sorrows for
[55:46] so he giveth his beloved
[55:49] sleep Lo children are a Heritage of the
[55:51] Lord and the fruit of the womb is his
[55:53] reward as arrows are in the hand and of
[55:56] a mighty man so are children of the
[56:00] youth happy is the man that hath his
[56:03] quiver full of them they shall not be
[56:06] ashamed but they shall speak with the
[56:08] enemies in the gate words from King
[56:15] Solomon another man named heon wrote one
[56:18] of the Psalms and another man named
[56:20] Ethan wrote one of the Psalms can
[56:23] somebody tell me another author
[56:27] of one
[56:30] Psalm
[56:32] Moses Moses wrote one of the
[56:37] Psalms that's right at the start of the
[56:39] beginning of book number four in the
[56:42] psalm so let's read it Psalm number
[56:45] 90 this is the prophet
[56:48] Moses speaking and writing his song Lord
[56:52] thou Hast been our Dwelling Place in all
[56:54] generations before the mountains were
[56:56] brought forth orever thou had formed the
[56:59] earth and the world even from
[57:01] Everlasting to Everlasting Thou Art God
[57:04] thou turnest man to destruction and
[57:06] saith return ye Children of Men for a
[57:09] thousand years in thy sight are but as
[57:11] yesterday when it is passed and as a
[57:15] watch in the night thou carest them away
[57:18] as with a flood they are as asleep in
[57:21] the morning they are like grass which
[57:24] which groweth up in the morning it
[57:26] flourisheth and groweth up in the
[57:28] evening it is cut down and withereth for
[57:31] we are consumed by thine anger and by
[57:34] thy wrath we are troubled for thou has
[57:37] set our iniquities before thee our
[57:38] secret sins in the light of thy
[57:41] countenance for all our days are passed
[57:44] away in thy wrath we spend our years as
[57:47] a tale that is told the days of our
[57:50] years are three score years and 10 and
[57:53] if by any reason of strength they be
[57:56] four score Years yet is their strength
[57:58] labor and sorrow for for it is soon cut
[58:02] off and we fly away who knoweth the
[58:05] power of thine anger even according to
[58:07] thy fear so is thy wrath so teach us to
[58:11] number our days that we may apply our
[58:13] hearts un
[58:15] wisdom return oh Lord how
[58:18] long and let it repent thee concerning
[58:21] thy servants oh satisfy us early with
[58:25] thy mercy that we may rejoice and be
[58:28] glad all our days make us glad according
[58:32] to the days wherein thou has Afflicted
[58:34] Us in the Years wherein we have seen
[58:38] evil let thy Work appear under thy
[58:40] servants and thy Glory unto their
[58:43] children and let the beauty of of the
[58:46] Lord of Lord Our God be upon us and
[58:49] establish thou the work of our hands
[58:51] upon us yay the work of our hands
[58:54] establish thou it written by the prophet
[58:59] Moses
[59:01] 48 the remaining 48 of the Psalms are
[59:06] Anonymous but two of those Anonymous
[59:08] Psalms were written by

[1:00:51] things so we can put David's name on
[1:00:54] that the um
[1:00:56] the book the book you'll see that at the
[1:01:02] top it will say a Psalm of Asaf or a
[1:01:06] Psalm of David that is considered
[1:01:09] inspired
[1:01:11] words that's considered part of the
[1:01:13] Bible the other the the scoffield notes
[1:01:16] or whatever notes that you have in your
[1:01:18] Bible is is of course that's someone's

[1:01:59] five four or five five I think genis
[1:02:06] Genesis Genesis second longest book in
[1:02:08] the Bible Psalms as far as word Psalms

[1:02:32] shortest chapter in all the Bible Psalm
[1:02:35] 117 two
[1:02:39] verses
[1:02:41] Jesus as I said used to quote from the
[1:02:43] book of Psalms often more than any other
[1:02:46] Old Testament book book nearly half of
[1:02:49] all the direct quotes taken from the Old
[1:02:51] Testament and quoted in the New
[1:02:53] Testament are from the Psalms
[1:02:57] The Book of Psalms is either quoted from
[1:03:00] or alluded to about a hundred times in
[1:03:02] the Book of
[1:03:04] Revelation and 149 times in the gospels
[1:03:08] about that
[1:03:10] many John Chapter 2 the Lord
[1:03:15] Jesus he fulfilled numerous Psalms but
[1:03:20] let's read this one brother Jordan if
[1:03:22] you would put on Psalm on the screen
[1:03:25] Psalm 6 699 and I'm going to read from
[1:03:29] John 2:1 15 but Jordan brother um 699
[1:03:34] there we go John 2:15 says this and when
[1:03:38] he had made a scourge of small cords
[1:03:41] this is when Jesus came into Jerusalem
[1:03:43] and he all of the money changers there
[1:03:45] and and he it upset him and he tied the
[1:03:48] cords together and when he had made a
[1:03:50] scourge of small cords he drove them out
[1:03:53] of the temple and the sheep and The Oxen
[1:03:55] and poured out the charges of money and
[1:03:57] overthrew the tables and said unto them
[1:03:59] that sold the doves take these things
[1:04:01] hence make not my father's house a house
[1:04:04] of merchandise and his disciples
[1:04:06] remembered that it was written the Zeal
[1:04:08] of thine house hath eaten me up that's
[1:04:12] amazing that they could put those two
[1:04:15] scriptures together Psalm 699 says this
[1:04:18] for the Zeal of thine house hath eaten
[1:04:21] me up and the reproaches of them that
[1:04:23] reproach thee are Fallen upon me
[1:04:27] brother Jordan if you could put up Psalm
[1:04:31] 315 Luke 40 chapter 23: 46 says this and
[1:04:37] when Jesus had cried with a loud voice
[1:04:40] he said father into thy hands I commend
[1:04:43] my spirit and having thus said he gave
[1:04:45] up the
[1:04:46] ghost
[1:04:48] crucifixion Psalm 315 into thine hand I
[1:04:52] commit my spirit thou Hast redeemed me
[1:04:55] oh Lord God of Truth
[1:04:59] wow the word
[1:05:01] CA appears 71 times in the Psalms
[1:05:06] throughout the Psalms and it's often
[1:05:09] interpreted as an instruction calling
[1:05:12] for a break in the singing or the the of
[1:05:16] the reciting of the psalm or to pause
[1:05:19] and to calmly think about what you have
[1:05:21] just read so when you read that word
[1:05:26] the author is
[1:05:28] saying
[1:05:29] stop digest what you just read let it
[1:05:33] sink in take a rest a minute meditate on
[1:05:36] this song that you just sang or this
[1:05:38] poem that you just read Psalm
[1:05:41] 24 verse 20 verse
[1:05:44] 7 says
[1:05:50] this I'm sorry brother Jordan let's go
[1:05:52] to Psalm
[1:05:54] 241 says this
[1:05:56] the Earth is the Lords and the fullness
[1:05:58] thereof the world and they that dwell
[1:06:01] therein for he hath founded it upon the
[1:06:03] Seas and established it upon the floods
[1:06:07] who shall Ascend into the hill of the
[1:06:09] Lord or who shall stand in his holy
[1:06:12] place he that hath Clean Hands and a
[1:06:14] pure heart who hath not lifted up his
[1:06:17] soul un vanity nor sworn
[1:06:21] deceitfully he shall receive the
[1:06:23] blessing from the Lord and righteousness
[1:06:25] from the Lord of his
[1:06:27] salvation this is the generation of them
[1:06:29] that seek him that seek thy face oh
[1:06:32] Jacob seea lift up your head heads oh ye
[1:06:36] gates and be ye lift up ye Everlasting
[1:06:40] doors and the king of glory shall come
[1:06:42] in who is this king of glory the lord
[1:06:46] strong and mighty the Lord Mighty in
[1:06:48] battle lift up your heads oh ye gates
[1:06:51] even lift them up ye Everlasting doors
[1:06:54] and the king of glory shall come in who
[1:06:56] is the king of glory the lord of hosts
[1:06:59] he is king of glory
[1:07:04] Sila that's something that we can pause
[1:07:07] and think about the Lord of glory the
[1:07:10] lord Jesus walking into the Heavenly
[1:07:14] City walking into the
[1:07:18] heavens and all the Praises coming
[1:07:21] coming forth he's saying pause think
[1:07:25] about that that
[1:07:28] amen Psalm
[1:07:30] Psalm
[1:07:33] 119
[1:07:35] is one
[1:07:37] of Psalm 119 is about the
[1:07:41] word and it constantly it's lifting up
[1:07:44] the word and it's
[1:07:46] it's presenting the word to the people I
[1:07:49] believe it says that Thy word is a lamp
[1:07:53] into my feet
[1:07:56] and it is the
[1:07:59] longest in the Bible and I believe it's
[1:08:02] the longest because it is all about the
[1:08:05] word of God and how fitting that that
[1:08:11] book
[1:08:12] takes precedence among all of the Bible
[1:08:15] as being the very longest chapter and
[1:08:18] and it's the chapters in The Bible most
[1:08:22] of you know that
[1:08:25] most of these books in this Bible were
[1:08:28] written just as one big long scroll and
[1:08:31] then later on numbers were put in there
[1:08:34] so we can look it up so there
[1:08:37] wasn't a St John 1 or St John
[1:08:42] 17 St John 14:12 when they wrote it it
[1:08:46] was all just the Gospel of John from
[1:08:49] beginning to end but it wasn't like this
[1:08:53] in the Book of Psalms there were
[1:08:55] actually separated books in
[1:08:59] there I want to
[1:09:03] read a little bit of out of Psalm
[1:09:07] [Music]
[1:09:08] 119 and
[1:09:11] then I would like Sister
[1:09:14] Sarah to come up and sing that song that
[1:09:18] you sang the other day it was just so
[1:09:20] beautiful on on the Psalms I believe it
[1:09:23] was like brother Josiah had saying it
[1:09:24] was It was a a couple different Psalms
[1:09:26] that you put
[1:09:28] together and uh then we will um we
[1:09:33] worship with another Psalm or two and
[1:09:37] singing Psalm
[1:09:40] 119 says
[1:09:43] this Thou Art um Psalm 119 verse 557
[1:09:47] brother Jordan I won't read the whole
[1:09:52] thing Thou Art my portion oh Lord
[1:09:56] I have said that I would keep thy
[1:09:59] words I was reading
[1:10:04] this the other day as I was starting to
[1:10:06] prepare for this
[1:10:10] lesson
[1:10:12] and I really felt the presence of the
[1:10:16] Lord and I really felt condemned as I
[1:10:19] was reading this
[1:10:21] Psalm saying of the lord lord I I am
[1:10:26] a lowly person and I fall so
[1:10:29] short as I was reading these words I I
[1:10:32] was thinking that Lord this is what I
[1:10:36] want to be this is what I want to live
[1:10:37] up
[1:10:39] to Thou Art my portion oh
[1:10:42] Lord I have said that I would keep thy
[1:10:47] words I entreated thy favor with my
[1:10:50] whole heart be merciful un unto me
[1:10:54] according to thy will
[1:10:55] word I thought on my ways and turned my
[1:10:58] feet unto thy testimonies I made haste
[1:11:03] and delayed not to keep thy
[1:11:07] Commandments the bands of the wicked
[1:11:10] have robbed me but I have not forgotten
[1:11:14] thy
[1:11:15] law at midnight I will rise to give
[1:11:19] thanks unto thee because of thy
[1:11:20] righteous
[1:11:22] judgments that's where I stopped
[1:11:25] as I was reading
[1:11:28] this and I said Lord I've done that
[1:11:33] before but how rare is it for me to wake
[1:11:37] up in the middle of the night just
[1:11:38] because just because there's there was a
[1:11:40] time from the time that I I prayed
[1:11:44] before I went to sleep and the time that
[1:11:46] I prayed when I woke up in the morning
[1:11:48] that was too long of a time for me to
[1:11:49] separate myself from you Lord
[1:11:55] at midnight I will rise to give thanks
[1:11:59] unto thee because of thy
[1:12:01] righteousness I am a companion of all
[1:12:03] them that fear thee and of them that
[1:12:06] keep thy
[1:12:07] precepts the earth oh Lord is full of
[1:12:10] thy mercy teach me thy
[1:12:13] statutes thou Hast dealt well with thy
[1:12:16] servant oh Lord according unto Thy word
[1:12:19] teach me good judgment and
[1:12:22] knowledge for I have believed thy
[1:12:26] Commandments before I was
[1:12:30] afflicted I want to stray but now I have
[1:12:33] kept Thy
[1:12:35] word thou art good and doest good to
[1:12:39] teach me thy statutes the proud have
[1:12:41] forged a lie against me but I will keep
[1:12:45] thy precepts with my whole heart their
[1:12:48] heart is as fat as grease but I Delight
[1:12:52] in thy
[1:12:53] law it is good for me that I have been
[1:12:57] Afflicted that I might learn thy
[1:13:00] statutes the law of thy mouth is better
[1:13:04] unto me than thousands of gold and
[1:13:09] silver what beautiful
