[30:43] come on
[30:45] [Music]
[31:13] foreign
[31:23] God bless you I wanted to share the
[31:25] quick background of the song that we're
[31:27] gonna sing tonight I was watching some
[31:29] video footage from the um Asbury Revival
[31:32] that just happened last month at
[31:34] Kentucky among the college students and
[31:36] it was really encouraged to see so many
[31:39] young people
[31:40] praising God looking for God
[31:44] loving on each other praying at the
[31:47] altar praying for each other and that's
[31:49] a generation younger than myself and I
[31:52] was so impressed by that and it just
[31:53] showed the need
[31:55] for people they want to know the Lord
[31:58] they see the chaos about them well they
[32:01] were singing I heard them sing the song
[32:04] and I knew it it's one we sing and it
[32:07] put me in mind of the Revival of the 70s
[32:11] known as the Jesus movement when a lot
[32:13] of the hippies were saved and out of
[32:15] that movement came a lot of worship
[32:17] songs a lot of uh people that got saved
[32:20] as young people and they began to write
[32:21] songs and music that we still sing today
[32:25] and I was hearing the man that wrote
[32:28] this song tell his testimony of how God
[32:31] had saved him as a young person during
[32:33] that 70s Revival and begin to work in
[32:36] his life delivered him from all kinds of
[32:38] things and he gave him this song and it
[32:41] was the song that the kids at the Asbury
[32:43] Revival were singing
[32:44] and to me I thought that was such a
[32:46] wonderful thing that this generational
[32:49] difference you had this young people in
[32:51] the 70s write the song
[32:53] worshiping God song about spreading the
[32:56] love of Jesus in song and praise and
[32:59] then here all these years later you have
[33:01] another generation worshiping to that
[33:03] same song so I'd like to sing it and of
[33:05] course you can sing it with us if you'd
[33:07] like
[33:11] sometimes
[33:15] [Music]
[33:25] sometimes
[33:26] gently singing

[33:41] [Music]
[33:45] sometimes praise the Lord
[33:51] sometimes
[33:53] gently singing
[33:55] [Music]
[34:04] oh let us live our voices
[34:12] [Music]
[34:17] oh let us now return his love
[34:23] and let our voices
[34:32] [Music]

[57:54] little part then it's all just one big
[57:56] family
[57:57] amen so let's take our Bibles tonight's
[58:00] turn to Psalms 32.

[58:07] this morning did you enjoy the message
[58:09] for your pastor this morning amen I I
[58:11] just I was just thanking God
[58:14] for conviction
[58:16] that God still convicts my heart when I
[58:21] hear the word not condemns me but
[58:23] convicts me
[58:25] amen so that that it it pushes me it it
[58:28] challenges me to strive to be more
[58:31] sincere
[58:32] with what we have amen so I want to
[58:35] thank brother Daniel for that this
[58:37] morning my heart was just stirred this

[58:41] great
[58:42] a great message a great
[58:44] you know a great conviction there a
[58:47] burden everything starts with a burden
[58:49] you got to have the burden
[58:51] or you go nowhere right you got to have
[58:54] a burden a passion
[58:55] amen a passion for God a passion for
[58:58] Souls a passion for the church a passion
[59:02] for your brother and sisters
[59:03] amen so that's where it starts and if
[59:07] that's there amen there's going to be
[59:08] progress
[59:09] there's going to be success amen let's
[59:12] read from Psalms 32 and just before we
[59:15] do I want to just ask the Lord to bless
[59:17] his word father as we stand here tonight
[59:19] father we're of course we're Lord humans
[59:23] Lord and as our brothers saying humans
[59:25] forget and we ask you forgive us of our
[59:28] forgetfulness Lord or when we forget you
[59:31] or when we leave you Lord just hanging
[59:34] in the shadows thinking that we have
[59:37] more important things to do father
[59:39] forgive us for our transgressions our
[59:41] iniquities and our failures Lord help us
[59:44] Lord to be Lord more in love with you
[59:47] father help us Lord Jesus to to just

[59:55] tonight take the word Lord anointed to
[59:58] our hearts and father may it not just be
[1:00:00] a a mission report but may it be
[1:00:03] something that stirs our hearts to serve
[1:00:06] you more and serve you better walk
[1:00:08] closer to you in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:00:10] ask it amen amen Psalms 32 and I want to
[1:00:15] read from the book of Acts also so
[1:00:17] Psalms 32 verse 5 I acknowledge my sin
[1:00:21] unto thee my iniquity have I not hid I
[1:00:24] said I will not I will confess my
[1:00:25] transgressions unto the Lord and thou
[1:00:28] forgivest the iniquity of my sin
[1:00:31] for this shall everyone that is Godly
[1:00:33] pray unto thee in a time when thou
[1:00:34] mayest be found surely in the floods of
[1:00:37] Great Waters they shall not come nigh
[1:00:39] unto him Thou Art my Hiding Place thou
[1:00:43] shall preserve me from trouble Thou
[1:00:45] shalt Compass me about with songs of
[1:00:48] Deliverance
[1:00:50] I will instruct Thee I will teach thee
[1:00:52] in the way which Thou shalt go I will
[1:00:56] guide thee with my eye and and the word
[1:00:59] guide thee means counsel
[1:01:02] I will counsel you I will guide you be
[1:01:06] not as the horse or the mule which have
[1:01:09] no understanding whose mouth must be
[1:01:10] held with a bit and Bridal lest they
[1:01:13] come near unto thee
[1:01:14] amen we'll just stop right there uh
[1:01:17] David's speaking there Acts chapter 15.
[1:01:21] and I just I'll tie these two scriptures
[1:01:24] together in the report
[1:01:25] but they just seem to
[1:01:28] have a connection with me
[1:01:30] Acts chapter chapter 16 or 15. we'll
[1:01:35] start 15 verse 36.
[1:01:40] Paul now an apostle
[1:01:43] speaking here
[1:01:46] we'll pick it up in verse 36 and some
[1:01:48] days after Paul said unto Barnabas let
[1:01:51] us go again and visit our brethren in
[1:01:52] every city where we have preached the
[1:01:54] word of the Lord and see how they do
[1:01:57] and Barnabas determined to take with
[1:01:59] them John whose surname was Mark but
[1:02:02] Paul thought it not good to take him
[1:02:04] with them who departed from them in
[1:02:07] famphilia and went not with them to the
[1:02:11] work
[1:02:11] and the contention was so sharp between
[1:02:14] them that they departed asunder and from
[1:02:17] one another and so Barnabas took Mark
[1:02:19] and sailed unto Cyprus
[1:02:22] amen so these missionary Journeys
[1:02:24] there was not always perfect agreement
[1:02:28] amen now this is after the day of
[1:02:30] Pentecost right this is after they had
[1:02:33] the Holy Ghost
[1:02:34] so we're going to have disagreements
[1:02:36] we're going to see things a little bit
[1:02:38] different amen but God works it all out
[1:02:42] and then God uses each one in their own
[1:02:45] way that he's determined to use them so
[1:02:47] I just wanted to bring that out and uh
[1:02:50] also verse on chapter 16
[1:02:55] we'll pick it up at verse 6.
[1:02:57] now when they had gone through that's a
[1:03:00] hard one that's a Greek word maybe our
[1:03:02] brother Lyle could pronounce that one I
[1:03:04] should add
[1:03:06] okay
[1:03:08] well that's easy for that's easy for you
[1:03:11] to say maybe I should get you off here
[1:03:14] forget okay you speak it loud Enrique
[1:03:17] and uh and the region of galatia
[1:03:20] and were forbidden by the Holy Ghost of
[1:03:23] the Holy Ghost to preach the word in
[1:03:24] Asia
[1:03:25] after they were come now I want to I
[1:03:28] want to emphasize that they were
[1:03:30] forbidden to preach the Holy Ghost
[1:03:33] of the Holy Ghost to preach the word I
[1:03:35] thought when you're doing Mission work
[1:03:36] with the word you're always in the will
[1:03:38] of God
[1:03:39] well you are but sometimes God wants you
[1:03:42] at a different place
[1:03:44] right and so now when they had gone
[1:03:46] through yes after they were come to
[1:03:48] Messiah
[1:03:51] good enough okay and see we spoke uh
[1:03:56] Hebrew this morning tonight we're
[1:03:58] speaking Greek
[1:03:59] and they assayed to go unto
[1:04:03] bethenia but the spirit suffered them
[1:04:06] not
[1:04:08] and they passing through this
[1:04:11] Messiah came down to troas and a vision
[1:04:14] appeared unto Paul in the night there
[1:04:16] stood a man from Macedonia and prayed
[1:04:18] unto him saying come over unto Macedonia
[1:04:21] and help us may the Lord bless his word
[1:04:24] that's that's uh you may be seated
[1:04:27] that's what I wanted to share as a
[1:04:29] basis for the report
[1:04:34] and uh
[1:04:36] so uh we took this last trip I think it
[1:04:41] was in uh
[1:04:43] January February
[1:04:46] boy I'm forgetting my dates now there's
[1:04:48] a way a month anyway
[1:04:50] so uh
[1:04:51] we got back in the late February the
[1:04:54] 24th about the 24th so
[1:04:56] you know we went uh we went in the in
[1:04:59] the uh
[1:05:01] in the hopes of visiting three to four
[1:05:03] countries
[1:05:04] wanted to wanted to go into Kenya to
[1:05:08] Uganda
[1:05:09] also uh into Sudan which is
[1:05:12] in in the southern Sudan is not as
[1:05:15] violent as Northern Sudan but there is
[1:05:18] still chances that you could get
[1:05:21] kidnapped or taken or ransomed or
[1:05:24] something but uh so we had these plans
[1:05:27] there was a brother in Ethiopia taking a
[1:05:30] minister from Ethiopia into Kenya to to
[1:05:33] expose them to some of the message
[1:05:35] churches
[1:05:36] and he was uh he was introducing him to
[1:05:38] the message so he had a large
[1:05:41] Pentecostal Ethiopian Church in Addis
[1:05:43] Ababa which is the capital of Ethiopia
[1:05:46] so they were they were coming so we were
[1:05:48] meeting in Kenya and so uh just prior to
[1:05:52] us meeting I went through Europe and uh
[1:05:55] my brother could next slide or
[1:05:58] next picture this is the continent of
[1:06:04] Africa
[1:06:06] can you see that yeah
[1:06:08] the USA is in there China's in there
[1:06:11] India's in there
[1:06:13] amen parts of Europe Germany France
[1:06:16] Italy
[1:06:17] um
[1:06:18] all these nations Great Britain Japan's
[1:06:22] a small country but all these nations
[1:06:25] now I can see it here I'm sorry
[1:06:27] so you know I don't know what the
[1:06:29] statistics are but I I believe brother
[1:06:31] Dan you mentioned it one time there's
[1:06:33] more Believers in the continent of
[1:06:35] Africa than all North America
[1:06:50] do you hear that one and a half million
[1:06:52] in the in the Congo
[1:06:57] amen so I've been in the Congo
[1:07:00] and uh yes big churches and uh and some
[1:07:04] you know some small churches some
[1:07:07] missionary works and Villages and things
[1:07:09] like that but
[1:07:10] you know that that that's you can get
[1:07:13] lost here
[1:07:15] for years you you could be in the these
[1:07:18] these countries for years and never
[1:07:21] touch it hardly touch it so you know we
[1:07:24] say you know we're at the end and we
[1:07:26] know we're close but you know there's
[1:07:28] there's still people coming in
[1:07:30] there's still Souls being saved you know
[1:07:33] if we had just given up years ago then
[1:07:36] they wouldn't be here now
[1:07:38] you know like the prophet said when he
[1:07:40] went past the curtain of time they said
[1:07:42] thank you for going if you hadn't went
[1:07:44] we wouldn't be here
[1:07:46] so they're still Souls being saved
[1:07:49] there's still work to do you know if if
[1:07:52] the Lord's coming tomorrow and you're
[1:07:53] Building a Church build a church
[1:07:56] you know plan like it's a hundred years
[1:07:58] live like it's tomorrow
[1:08:00] so that's why we're still doing Mission
[1:08:01] work and still still seeing the results
[1:08:04] still seeing people get saved
[1:08:07] still people seeing people get healed
[1:08:09] still seeing people get delivered amen
[1:08:13] still seeing God do the miraculous amen
[1:08:17] he's still God God is still God Amen and
[1:08:21] I just like that you know that gives me
[1:08:22] a passion for the mission field
[1:08:25] um
[1:08:26] uh maybe next next slide we went through
[1:08:29] Europe and and this is a pastor's two
[1:08:31] daughters that uh you know they they
[1:08:34] have a burden for Ethiopia too and are
[1:08:36] praying with us about that uh next slide
[1:08:39] brother Olaf rents his wife and two
[1:08:42] daughters this is a brother my Andreas
[1:08:45] Mai his wife and his son and and his
[1:08:48] wife uh also we visited their church and
[1:08:52] spoke for them
[1:08:54] um next slide
[1:08:56] we also spoke for Andreas moringen
[1:08:59] which uh which is from northern uh
[1:09:04] I shouldn't say Northern Germany oh it's
[1:09:05] West Germany instead of the other two
[1:09:07] brothers were East Germany he was from
[1:09:09] West Germany and we took the three
[1:09:13] services there so by the time I've got
[1:09:15] to Africa I'd already taken quite a few
[1:09:19] services so you know it just it's just
[1:09:22] kind of the a springboard for me
[1:09:25] to go to Africa and I know these
[1:09:28] churches for many years now over 10
[1:09:30] years and we've been speaking and going
[1:09:32] in to see them and seeing their little
[1:09:34] Works grow
[1:09:36] amen and uh we had some really uh
[1:09:40] move of God here in these in these
[1:09:42] services that we were with them in
[1:09:46] um next slide
[1:09:47] this brother here in one of the services
[1:09:49] I I really didn't expect the Lord to
[1:09:52] move the way he moved in those services
[1:09:55] and just the whole church
[1:09:58] responded and uh you know I I I wasn't
[1:10:02] making pulls for alter calls or or
[1:10:05] prayer or anything but just a whole
[1:10:07] church responded and everyone came for
[1:10:10] prayer for one thing or another this
[1:10:12] brother came up and I've known him for
[1:10:15] quite a few years I stayed in his home
[1:10:16] that's where I took the picture when I
[1:10:18] when I flew into Germany and uh he uh he
[1:10:22] has he has Parkinson's
[1:10:24] and when he went through the line uh I
[1:10:27] didn't know actually I didn't know he he
[1:10:30] didn't say what it was he just wanted
[1:10:32] prayer so we were sitting down
[1:10:34] afterwards having a bowl of soup at
[1:10:36] lunch and he says yeah he's talking to
[1:10:39] me and another brother martin Schindler
[1:10:41] which brotherly sister Shelly no we're
[1:10:44] sitting together having a bowl of soup
[1:10:45] and he says you know I just thank God he
[1:10:48] said you know he's very straight and as
[1:10:51] a matter of fact he said yeah I have I I
[1:10:53] don't have any pain now at all
[1:10:55] he said it's all gone
[1:10:58] amen so he's he's 70 70 plus years old
[1:11:02] and he's you know it so age doesn't
[1:11:04] matter
[1:11:06] age does not matter
[1:11:09] God changed Abraham's body
[1:11:11] when he was an old man amen so uh it's
[1:11:15] just nice to have his fellowship and
[1:11:17] some of the other ones that came were
[1:11:19] touched and next slide Maybe
[1:11:23] so we left uh
[1:11:24] we left uh Germany headed for Kenya and
[1:11:30] um
[1:11:30] we got there
[1:11:33] and begin to meet this brother now I
[1:11:37] don't have a pinpointer but the brother
[1:11:40] Leon your
[1:11:42] it would be on your left or no sorry
[1:11:45] you're right
[1:11:47] be on your right this one right on this
[1:11:50] end this is the Ethiopian Pastor that
[1:11:53] has a large Ethiopian Church in the
[1:11:55] disaba so he came with the brother on on
[1:11:59] my right there that's kefa and he's from
[1:12:03] Ethiopia he's originally from Kenya
[1:12:05] and uh do you have a marker brother
[1:12:08] I was looking at that I was wondering if
[1:12:10] that was
[1:12:12] right there okay
[1:12:16] oh okay
[1:12:18] wonderful so that's brother kefa there
[1:12:21] uh brother his name is uh it's hard to
[1:12:25] pronounce uh he calls him humble it's
[1:12:28] actually humble brother humble
[1:12:31] so uh so brother humble came to this
[1:12:35] brother uh Wycliffe and he's the pastor
[1:12:38] in Kenya one of the pastors there in
[1:12:40] Nairobi and has a has a large Church
[1:12:43] there about 700 to a thousand people in
[1:12:46] his church it works with brother Obadiah
[1:12:49] and so brother kefir brought him along
[1:12:53] and we had Fellowship together so a lot
[1:12:56] of sometimes a lot of the mission work
[1:12:58] is one on one
[1:13:00] it's it's sometimes it's just
[1:13:02] ministering and and and
[1:13:04] explaining or or you know uh telling
[1:13:07] them what the message is about
[1:13:09] so we had some time to sit down with
[1:13:12] this brother and uh and talk about the
[1:13:16] message
[1:13:17] and talk about things that he didn't he
[1:13:20] didn't really have time to before this
[1:13:22] meeting to really
[1:13:24] run him through but now he he has all
[1:13:27] the message
[1:13:28] and he's listening to it on the on the
[1:13:31] on his phone he has all the message so
[1:13:35] it's just like uh
[1:13:36] is this like a volcano to him like he's
[1:13:39] saying where did this come from how did
[1:13:41] how did this how did we ever miss this
[1:13:43] you know and he so we talked about his
[1:13:46] uh you know his ideas and we talked
[1:13:49] about uh his experience and we let him
[1:13:52] talk a little bit and
[1:13:54] no I asked him I said how how do you
[1:13:57] baptize in your church and he said well
[1:13:59] we baptized I said do you baptize in the
[1:14:02] name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said
[1:14:03] yes he said we baptize in the name of
[1:14:06] the father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:14:09] which is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:14:13] and I said yes okay that's that's
[1:14:14] interesting I said so you see the
[1:14:17] difference between baptism
[1:14:19] right and he said yes I see it so I I I
[1:14:22] thought about it and I thought you know
[1:14:25] he he's very getting very close
[1:14:28] because in that you know baptism you
[1:14:31] know it doesn't save you
[1:14:33] but it's also it's also important
[1:14:36] because Paul said how how since you
[1:14:40] believed how were you baptized
[1:14:42] that is important it is I explained to
[1:14:45] him I used to live in this in the Strait
[1:14:47] of cancer so the straight is is a narrow
[1:14:50] body of water connecting one part of the
[1:14:53] Atlantic Ocean to the another so I said
[1:14:55] that that's the gate I said and the
[1:14:57] revelation of the godhead is in that
[1:15:01] the name of the father Son and Holy
[1:15:03] Ghost uh brother Daniel and I were
[1:15:05] talking about it you know baptism is
[1:15:07] there's a name associated with it
[1:15:10] see it's not a title it's a name so I
[1:15:13] said why don't you just do it the way
[1:15:15] they did it in the scripture
[1:15:17] you'll get the same result
[1:15:19] they didn't add in the name of the
[1:15:21] father son Holy Ghost because they had
[1:15:23] the Revelation who the father son to go
[1:15:26] Holy Ghost was
[1:15:28] amen so we talked on that a little bit
[1:15:30] and uh he's studying the message and
[1:15:34] he's text me since I've been back and
[1:15:37] he's excited when are you coming back
[1:15:39] like I can just turn around and go back
[1:15:41] you know like uh money when we be here
[1:15:45] we want you to come to our church
[1:15:47] Ethiopians are very suspicious people
[1:15:51] have you ever been to Ethiopia brother
[1:15:54] no very suspicious people and to get
[1:15:58] into their churches is very hard
[1:16:00] especially the Pentecostal churches
[1:16:03] and uh so now there's an open door
[1:16:08] now there's an open door
[1:16:10] so once once they get the Revelation is
[1:16:13] and his brother kefa was preaching uh
[1:16:17] some of the Revelation to his church
[1:16:20] in his church and he was talking about
[1:16:23] uh just Holiness standards and things
[1:16:27] and you know uh the the sisters were all
[1:16:30] they had lipstick and makeup and they
[1:16:33] had I forget what else they had they had
[1:16:35] pants or whatever and he was he was just
[1:16:38] preaching you know about the Jezebel
[1:16:40] spirit of this age and you know his wife
[1:16:43] the pastor's wife she wipes off all her
[1:16:46] lipstick
[1:16:47] she wipes it all off she wears a dress
[1:16:51] like sir if that's what it is see that's
[1:16:53] that's that's not condemnation that's
[1:16:56] not legalism that's that's conviction
[1:17:00] if God said it then I want to do it amen
[1:17:03] when I when I came to the Lord my hair
[1:17:05] was down to here someone said you know
[1:17:07] about a man having long hair it's a
[1:17:10] shame unto him well when I heard that I
[1:17:12] said well if that's what the Lord wants
[1:17:15] you know if that's what the Lord wants
[1:17:16] not this preacher but if that's in the
[1:17:19] Bible
[1:17:20] if you can show it to me in the Bible
[1:17:23] then I want to do it I said I don't care
[1:17:25] if I look like a monkey
[1:17:26] because I thought anyone with short hair
[1:17:28] looked like monkey
[1:17:31] and I I didn't want to look I want to
[1:17:33] look cool
[1:17:34] you know like and so uh that was
[1:17:38] conviction they just started to line
[1:17:40] right up
[1:17:42] praise the Lord
[1:17:44] praise God for that that's a big move in
[1:17:48] Ethiopia that's something that happened
[1:17:51] there this time and it was just brother
[1:17:54] kefa had it on his heart to invite him
[1:17:56] so
[1:17:57] we went uh from there let's see I try to
[1:18:01] stay with my notes
[1:18:03] um
[1:18:04] we had good good fellowship with him and
[1:18:08] uh
[1:18:10] we got to
[1:18:12] um we got to share quite a bit with him
[1:18:14] we went to Brother wycliffe's church I
[1:18:17] spoke in the morning so he he was able
[1:18:18] to hear a message
[1:18:20] minister
[1:18:22] speak about the word so and how we
[1:18:26] handle the word how we teach the word
[1:18:28] how we place the word and so he he came
[1:18:32] to that service he he said he was really
[1:18:34] impressed with uh with the church and
[1:18:37] just with the the the the the spirit of
[1:18:40] Holiness in the church and the and the
[1:18:42] response from the church
[1:18:44] the night before the two nights before
[1:18:46] when I got to Kenya they put me in a
[1:18:48] room in a hotel downtown it was a really
[1:18:51] a shady place I'm always in the hood
[1:18:53] brother
[1:18:54] they almost put me
[1:18:56] and put me in every time you know I
[1:18:58] didn't even have a fan and all I want is
[1:19:01] a fan
[1:19:02] you know if I can have a fan I don't
[1:19:04] need the air conditioning if I can have
[1:19:06] a fan I'm happy so there was no fan and
[1:19:09] I had picked up something from Germany
[1:19:11] and it was uh maybe on the plane because
[1:19:13] a lot of people
[1:19:15] you know coughing and things and I I got
[1:19:17] a little chilled over there after the
[1:19:19] meetings and I picked something up I
[1:19:21] started to cough a little bit and when I
[1:19:24] got in that room I'll tell you it was
[1:19:25] just so hot and uh they had a sound
[1:19:30] system outside it was a weekend and they
[1:19:32] started to play their music and they
[1:19:36] like music they were like loud music so
[1:19:40] it was coming up through the cement
[1:19:42] walls and up into my room in the in the
[1:19:45] in the hotel or
[1:19:47] whatever you call it there so they uh I
[1:19:51] asked them you know can you move me can
[1:19:53] you do something it went through all the
[1:19:55] night like it was five in the morning
[1:19:56] when they stopped that was a Friday
[1:19:58] night
[1:19:59] so then they put me in another room
[1:20:01] Saturday I went went through the same
[1:20:03] thing
[1:20:04] you know and I was getting it was harder
[1:20:06] and harder no sleep I was getting run
[1:20:08] down and uh so it was just as it was
[1:20:12] just such a dumb demonic presence
[1:20:15] like like you you just all the old songs
[1:20:19] see one thing for me that I have trouble
[1:20:21] with is music
[1:20:24] because of my background the 60s and 70s
[1:20:27] those years of of the that rock and roll
[1:20:31] and things like that so I I knew all the
[1:20:34] songs
[1:20:35] like as they were going I was like oh no
[1:20:37] not that one you know like and I knew
[1:20:39] how it was going to go and all that
[1:20:40] stuff and I said oh I started to think
[1:20:42] about it you know I was thinking oh Lord
[1:20:44] deliver me why don't you why don't you
[1:20:46] just curse those speakers if you just
[1:20:48] blow them up Lord just or just send a
[1:20:52] win do something like I was really
[1:20:55] trying to pray that God you know just
[1:20:57] fighting that battle and finally I just
[1:20:59] thought well I'll just put on my phone
[1:21:02] I'll put on my phone I'll play my music
[1:21:04] that that dulling it a little bit but it
[1:21:07] was just tormenting
[1:21:10] and so I got to church on Sunday morning
[1:21:13] they stopped at probably five or six a.m
[1:21:17] Sunday morning
[1:21:19] and I and I'm awake through the night
[1:21:22] and you know what I preached on
[1:21:24] music
[1:21:27] I said I'm gonna give that devil a black
[1:21:30] eye so I I've preached on music I
[1:21:32] preached on technology
[1:21:35] I preached on that
[1:21:37] and you know I just I just and so you
[1:21:41] know they the the strange thing was
[1:21:43] because Satan knows you know how he
[1:21:46] knows how to torment you he knows your
[1:21:48] past he knows your weakness he he he's
[1:21:51] got a Punch Coming the prophet said
[1:21:53] right so he at the end of their evening
[1:21:57] they started to sing uh I wrote it down
[1:22:01] here they played all my life you have
[1:22:04] been faithful
[1:22:05] all my life you have been so so good
[1:22:10] you know in a in a fast rock and roll
[1:22:12] upbeat
[1:22:14] you know songs you hear in message
[1:22:17] churches
[1:22:18] demonic songs all night and then and
[1:22:21] then towards the end they're playing
[1:22:22] religious songs
[1:22:24] and I knew that's a devil that's just a
[1:22:27] devil and he's so religious
[1:22:29] they know all those Satan knows all the
[1:22:32] music
[1:22:33] you know so I I talked about music
[1:22:36] and uh you know and how how cunning he
[1:22:40] is and how he started in Ezekiel
[1:22:43] amen that the the you know the artificer
[1:22:47] or Genesis the artificer of brass and
[1:22:49] musical instruments and Ezekiel
[1:22:52] where he walked up and down in the fire
[1:22:55] and the stones
[1:22:56] he created this as his phone this is
[1:22:59] Satan's smartphone
[1:23:01] this is the knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:23:02] so I kind of really hit that and because
[1:23:05] I was just I was just ready for a fight
[1:23:09] you know I just wanted to you know if
[1:23:11] that was bothering anybody else I was
[1:23:13] gonna I was gonna preach deliverance and
[1:23:16] you know people got delivered
[1:23:18] people got delivered there was two souls
[1:23:20] two young people came forward give their
[1:23:23] hearts to Christ were baptized right
[1:23:26] there
[1:23:27] hey man maybe next slide I don't know if
[1:23:29] it's in that in that next slide that's
[1:23:31] his church
[1:23:33] and then uh it's a big church next slide
[1:23:36] that's our brother Wycliffe
[1:23:40] the musicians next slide
[1:23:42] there's one of the young people getting
[1:23:44] baptized amen so two Souls
[1:23:48] twenty thousand worlds
[1:23:51] amen twenty thousand morals and you're
[1:23:54] part of it
[1:23:56] amen when you send someone when you when
[1:23:59] you support Mission work it's important
[1:24:02] amen because we're not going anywhere
[1:24:04] without them
[1:24:06] and what if you were that last one
[1:24:08] wouldn't you like to hear
[1:24:11] amen and so praise God for that I just
[1:24:13] thank God for that we had a couple
[1:24:16] baptisms there a great move of God there
[1:24:18] too
[1:24:19] and we were able to share share the word
[1:24:22] with them there so
[1:24:24] after the service
[1:24:26] right after the service I lost my voice
[1:24:35] it's a funny thing
[1:24:36] when you lose your voice
[1:24:38] you know you're just Whispering like a
[1:24:40] baby
[1:24:41] and and you know you sound like a
[1:24:43] someone that's you know in between voice
[1:24:46] changes
[1:24:47] when you're becoming a man you think
[1:24:49] you're a man but you're not and you're
[1:24:50] like
[1:24:53] you know it was just really embarrassing
[1:24:55] I was trying to talk to the ministers
[1:24:56] and they were hardly understanding me
[1:24:58] but I said I you know I I don't think
[1:25:01] you know we were supposed to leave the
[1:25:03] next day uh by bus to
[1:25:07] Uganda
[1:25:08] and uh you know because you know you
[1:25:11] can't you can't always afford to fly
[1:25:13] around
[1:25:14] the continent you know you just those
[1:25:17] brothers are rugged Brothers they can
[1:25:19] take a lot of a lot of rough roads and
[1:25:22] uh but I'm getting older
[1:25:24] and I I kind of thought with my
[1:25:27] condition so I talked to brother uh
[1:25:29] Stephen and Bali in Uganda and Stephen
[1:25:32] was
[1:25:33] willing to accept me there he wanted me
[1:25:35] to come but he said I would not go with
[1:25:38] these brothers on a bus
[1:25:40] it was a four to five hour supposedly
[1:25:44] five-hour bus ride
[1:25:46] the two Kampala and uh it it turned out
[1:25:50] also brother Wycliffe he said don't no
[1:25:54] don't go on that bus not in your
[1:25:56] condition So I listened to the I
[1:25:58] listened to their counsel
[1:26:00] see I will guide Thee I will teach thee
[1:26:04] sometimes we need to listen to somebody
[1:26:05] else
[1:26:07] you know and I said you know what you
[1:26:09] Brothers know the country you know
[1:26:11] what's going on here it took them 16
[1:26:13] hours
[1:26:15] by bus
[1:26:17] with no air conditioning
[1:26:19] and it was hot
[1:26:21] Kenya was hot
[1:26:23] and you know it's it's like here in the
[1:26:25] summertime right
[1:26:27] so it's uh I just and they were and
[1:26:31] brother KF told me he said we were just
[1:26:33] wore out
[1:26:34] you imagine me
[1:26:36] coughing like I was coughing and no
[1:26:39] voice and and sit in that bus for 16
[1:26:42] hours
[1:26:43] it just it just wasn't happening you
[1:26:45] know so God forbid me
[1:26:49] God forbid me how do you forbid me he
[1:26:51] changed my circumstances
[1:26:54] and and I and I I got up the next
[1:26:56] morning there when I sent them off I
[1:26:59] said you Brothers go ahead I gave them
[1:27:00] an offering good offering to cover all
[1:27:02] their expenses and you know that that
[1:27:05] have something when they got home for
[1:27:06] their families and you know they were
[1:27:08] they were they were encouraged they were
[1:27:10] you know they were just let's go and
[1:27:13] they went and they did some ministering
[1:27:15] with uh brother humble's family over
[1:27:18] there in Ethiopia or in uh uh Uganda and
[1:27:23] some of the message churches in Kenya
[1:27:27] so they went ahead we went we separated
[1:27:30] we went different ways and I I didn't
[1:27:33] know what to do so I just I was praying
[1:27:35] about it I get up in the morning and I
[1:27:37] read that scripture in in Psalms 32 be
[1:27:40] not like the horse
[1:27:42] or the mule
[1:27:44] you know we we don't we don't want to be
[1:27:46] just work horses
[1:27:48] you know we want to be thoroughbreds
[1:27:51] thoroughbreds you know they're they're a
[1:27:53] different breed
[1:27:55] right they're a different breed of horse
[1:27:56] and I think I spoke to you about
[1:27:58] Secretariat here
[1:28:00] did I speak to you about Secretariat
[1:28:02] here
[1:28:02] how Secretariat won that triple crown
[1:28:05] you know I was I was sharing that with
[1:28:07] the Saints in Phoenix you know it just
[1:28:09] the horse knew how to run his own race
[1:28:12] the Holy Ghost knows how to run it but
[1:28:14] we're trying to force it and we're
[1:28:17] trying to steer the Holy Ghost
[1:28:20] the prophet said you don't use the Holy
[1:28:22] Ghost the Holy Ghost uses you
[1:28:25] if we can just get out of the way
[1:28:28] he knows how to run the race
[1:28:30] amen and so I just thought I'm just
[1:28:32] going to step back here maybe God is
[1:28:34] just wanting some fellowship
[1:28:37] this is not the way I thought it was
[1:28:40] going to go our thoughts are not his
[1:28:42] thoughts
[1:28:43] you know our ways are not his ways and
[1:28:47] we're writing Saints we're writing
[1:28:49] another book of Acts this is our book of
[1:28:52] Acts now
[1:28:53] we're writing a book of Acts we're
[1:28:55] hearing testimonies here
[1:28:57] amen you're hearing testimonies in your
[1:28:59] churches just just God is doing things
[1:29:02] and we just have to be aware and
[1:29:04] sensitive
[1:29:05] to turn to yield to step back
[1:29:09] amen and not not want our way
[1:29:12] you know the songwriter say I want your
[1:29:14] ways to be my ways
[1:29:16] along this road so I just stepped back
[1:29:19] and I didn't know what to do I text
[1:29:21] brother Daniel when I was there I was
[1:29:24] just I was just texting brother I was
[1:29:26] talking to brother Stephen and Bally I
[1:29:28] just needed some help I mean I was down
[1:29:30] you know Paul left
[1:29:32] one of the missionaries sick
[1:29:35] and he went on his missionary journey
[1:29:38] he said I left him sick
[1:29:41] and not that he not that he didn't pray
[1:29:43] for him but you know sickness sometimes
[1:29:47] there was a reason for that by the way
[1:29:48] too
[1:29:49] if you look up that that disciples name
[1:29:51] he was a Greek and and there was a lot
[1:29:55] of trouble because he was Greek and he
[1:29:57] was going into some of the synagogues
[1:29:59] with Paul
[1:30:01] and that starts a riot
[1:30:03] Paul had some trouble let's see God for
[1:30:06] some reason didn't want him to go
[1:30:09] so uh we're we find the same thing in
[1:30:13] the mission field today like it's it's
[1:30:15] fraught with uh disappointment and and
[1:30:18] and troubles and you know uh sorrows and
[1:30:21] you know sometimes sickness it's not
[1:30:24] it's not it's not Hollywood
[1:30:27] it's not Hollywood it's not it's not a
[1:30:30] vacation
[1:30:32] amen when you're sick in in Africa like
[1:30:36] I didn't want to go to a hospital
[1:30:38] I did not want to go to a hospital not
[1:30:41] there
[1:30:42] no I wasn't going there I just had
[1:30:44] Brothers pray with me and I was just
[1:30:46] going to tough it out and that was that
[1:30:48] was God too that was Supernatural the
[1:30:50] way that happened and how I recovered
[1:30:52] from that but you know um
[1:30:56] you know after we after I'd prayed and I
[1:30:58] just thought you know I just need some I
[1:31:00] just need some help
[1:31:02] I'm I'm down and out I'm here alone
[1:31:05] and on the brothers I've gone on so I
[1:31:08] thought you know I just came to me I'm
[1:31:10] gonna I'm gonna call my best friend
[1:31:14] so I call my best friend
[1:31:16] and I said you know this is my situation
[1:31:18] I could hardly talk which what what do
[1:31:21] you think I should do you think I should
[1:31:22] cut the trip short just come home
[1:31:24] and she said
[1:31:26] [Laughter]
[1:31:29] why don't you go to Malawi
[1:31:32] why don't you go to Malawi and why don't
[1:31:34] you call Brother Harrison up you're just
[1:31:37] two hours
[1:31:39] by playing call them up so I did
[1:31:42] and he was overjoyed
[1:31:45] he was just saying we were praying he
[1:31:48] told me before he left for Africa he
[1:31:49] said remember Brother Martin Malawi is
[1:31:52] your home
[1:31:54] he said don't forget us now you're going
[1:31:57] over to Kenya you're going over to these
[1:31:58] places you don't forget us it was like a
[1:32:01] warning you know and then I called them
[1:32:03] up he says Oh Brother Martin yeah you
[1:32:07] come over we're waiting for you and you
[1:32:10] know so I was able to go to see brother
[1:32:14] Harrison in in Malawi he met me at the
[1:32:17] Capitol
[1:32:18] um
[1:32:19] and uh you know he took care of me he
[1:32:23] you know he just nursed me nursed me
[1:32:26] back I mean I've been on the mission
[1:32:27] field with brothers that were so sick
[1:32:29] they should have been in the hospital
[1:32:31] and God miraculously
[1:32:33] with a little sugar and water
[1:32:36] just a little prayer and a little you
[1:32:38] know keep them out of the hospitals if
[1:32:41] you can and and don't leave their side
[1:32:44] if you can't if you can so we

[1:32:51] that with brother Daniel went to Monkey
[1:32:52] Bay monkey Bay is is on Lake Malawi and
[1:32:56] uh so he was gonna we're just gonna stay
[1:32:59] by the by the lake for a few days just
[1:33:01] to recover
[1:33:02] see you know um healing is not always
[1:33:05] miracles
[1:33:07] amen healing is a process
[1:33:09] it's little by little
[1:33:11] I I was the last time I was here I don't
[1:33:14] know if I was telling you about my arm I
[1:33:16] had an operation in July when I was here
[1:33:19] I had an operation when I went back I
[1:33:21] was going back for an operation I think
[1:33:23] I shared brother Aaron
[1:33:25] father and I shared with you on text and
[1:33:28] I I was scheduled for that operation so
[1:33:30] there was some waiting period so I
[1:33:33] thought well I'll just come down and we
[1:33:35] wanted to come down that time ourselves
[1:33:38] so we just came down and and we spoke
[1:33:40] here at that time I think did we speak
[1:33:42] in July
[1:33:43] anyway I went back ready for the
[1:33:45] operation and uh because you know I had
[1:33:48] separated the ligament from the from the
[1:33:51] the bicep onto the bone on the main bone
[1:33:54] and it had snapped it was very painful
[1:33:58] I picked up a load that was too heavy
[1:34:00] and it just snapped and I couldn't
[1:34:03] hardly use my arm so they said no you
[1:34:06] the surgeons the specialist said you
[1:34:08] need an operation and if you wait eight
[1:34:10] weeks we can't do it so I just thought
[1:34:13] well within the six weeks I'd still had
[1:34:16] that time I could come down here so I
[1:34:17] came down here and uh we went back and
[1:34:20] then they asked me the question for the
[1:34:22] operation D have you been out of the
[1:34:24] country
[1:34:27] what do you say
[1:34:28] yes
[1:34:30] yes I've been out of the country I've
[1:34:31] been in the U.S
[1:34:33] and they said well now you've got to
[1:34:35] wait another two weeks for a coved so
[1:34:37] that put me over the eight weeks and the
[1:34:40] surgeon said this is going to be tricky
[1:34:42] it's going to be deeper a deeper cut and
[1:34:46] and it's going to be tricky I got to
[1:34:47] take you got to take a ligament off your
[1:34:49] leg or or they Supply one and he said
[1:34:53] it's going to be a lot trickier a lot
[1:34:54] longer operation and so I got you know
[1:34:57] he said I'll do it and so I thought you
[1:35:01] know I wasn't afraid of it but uh I was
[1:35:06] I was just I didn't have any other
[1:35:08] direction you know and and sometimes we
[1:35:10] have to let the Lord work these things
[1:35:11] out
[1:35:12] anyway I'm giving you this testimony
[1:35:14] because you know God is the same
[1:35:16] yesterday today and forever if it's in
[1:35:18] Africa or if it's here
[1:35:19] amen and I I just said well you know I'm
[1:35:22] going to take it anyway and uh you know
[1:35:24] you got family and you got pressure they
[1:35:26] all you know want to want to kind of
[1:35:28] yeah you better do this and I wasn't
[1:35:30] afraid of it so I I just went in and uh
[1:35:33] they prepped me for the operation they
[1:35:36] painted your arm you know they know you
[1:35:37] know so they don't cut the right one
[1:35:39] right I'll cut off the right one so they
[1:35:42] paint you up and then they put the IV in
[1:35:44] you for the anesthetic and so I was
[1:35:46] laying there and I watched this other
[1:35:47] guy come out and he he had all his
[1:35:49] fingers cut off and and they had wrapped
[1:35:51] it but it was bleeding from the thing
[1:35:53] and I was just looking at that guy going
[1:35:55] but I was thinking I'm going in there
[1:35:57] and I'm thinking oh Lord deliver me so I
[1:36:01] thought you know this this this
[1:36:03] Believers from uh Grand Prairie had
[1:36:06] called me
[1:36:08] and it's one believer said uh you know
[1:36:11] brother martin we're praying for that
[1:36:13] operation and you know but God could
[1:36:15] touch you
[1:36:16] before the surgeon
[1:36:19] touches you
[1:36:20] and I said brother you know I said if
[1:36:23] you got that face I'm with you you know
[1:36:26] because I don't have it
[1:36:28] but I'm with you see you know brother
[1:36:31] Branham said you know you won't stop
[1:36:33] anyone from believing something that I
[1:36:35] can't believe
[1:36:36] see that's what we do we can't believe
[1:36:38] it then they can't believe it no they
[1:36:40] could believe it they could believe it
[1:36:42] for you
[1:36:43] and so I just said thank you you know I
[1:36:45] believe it too I said I believe he can
[1:36:47] do that I said but it's just the way it
[1:36:50] right now it's I'm going to take the
[1:36:52] operation so I got in there and a
[1:36:54] surgeon of an intern came out
[1:36:57] just as they're going to wheel me in and
[1:37:00] he said oh can I look at your arm again
[1:37:02] and he looked at the arm and he examined
[1:37:05] it he dug in there real good with his
[1:37:07] thumbs and he said do this do this do
[1:37:10] this do this he said you already got
[1:37:13] healing
[1:37:14] he said you don't need an operation
[1:37:16] Hallelujah
[1:37:19] you don't even need us
[1:37:21] he said I'll call the head surgeon and
[1:37:23] you want to talk to him I said sure and
[1:37:25] they agreed the two surgeons agreed so
[1:37:27] he said no there's a change
[1:37:29] Hallelujah healing is a process don't
[1:37:34] get discouraged and I mean it can feel
[1:37:36] worse
[1:37:37] but it's a process and if you can do
[1:37:40] that for my arm he can do it for my hip
[1:37:42] brother
[1:37:44] he's the same God
[1:37:46] amen and so I don't know how to get on
[1:37:49] that but it just you know I don't know
[1:37:51] how that happened but just uh healing
[1:37:54] Deliverance the same God is doing those
[1:37:58] things in Africa is doing them here
[1:38:00] and when we we serve the same God of the
[1:38:02] Prophet amen the same with the god of
[1:38:05] Elijah we serve
[1:38:07] amen and and we can believe for all
[1:38:09] things
[1:38:10] so um anyway we we got to Malawi maybe
[1:38:14] we'll go ahead on the uh oh I can do it
[1:38:16] right here right
[1:38:18] yes yeah this is Brother uh wycliffe's
[1:38:21] Church some of the Saints there
[1:38:24] and brother humble and brother kefa
[1:38:26] again that's the grace of God Hardware
[1:38:30] isn't that nice yeah
[1:38:32] yeah everything is grace of God or
[1:38:35] you know and uh
[1:38:37] that's now we got to we got to uh
[1:38:41] monkey Bay
[1:38:43] and we're down it's down time it's it's
[1:38:45] recover time
[1:38:47] as you can see I need it so uh
[1:38:51] this man this brother here this young
[1:38:53] man his name is lucky
[1:38:57] his name is lucky and he was the nicest
[1:39:01] young man he ran kind of a bar at the at
[1:39:03] the along the lake there where we were
[1:39:05] and we got talking to him and uh we're
[1:39:08] dealing with him and he gave me his he
[1:39:11] just started to open up and share things
[1:39:12] you know he's uh now I'm listening to
[1:39:14] him he knows the Bible like and he's a
[1:39:18] clean young man he didn't even drink but
[1:39:20] they just need work
[1:39:22] so um
[1:39:23] we got to share in the word with him a
[1:39:25] little bit and uh he wants to be
[1:39:28] baptized
[1:39:30] amen amen
[1:39:33] amen really nice young man his wife is a
[1:39:37] Christian probably denominational
[1:39:38] Christian but she you know she'll say he
[1:39:41] said she tells me when I go out and I
[1:39:43] spend some money with my friends and I
[1:39:44] go and have a drink or something and
[1:39:46] she'll tell me you know what can I pray
[1:39:49] for you today
[1:39:50] how can I pray for you and and and just
[1:39:53] convey he said just convict me convict
[1:39:55] me convict me amen thank God for that
[1:39:59] amen so when he ran into us and then we
[1:40:01] we give him the word
[1:40:03] amen he he just really responded so I
[1:40:06] think brother Harrison's going to be
[1:40:08] baptizing him
[1:40:10] so you know Paul went on a journey one
[1:40:12] time he went down by the river and he
[1:40:14] met one sister
[1:40:17] Lydia
[1:40:18] seller of purple
[1:40:20] and that one convert had house meanings
[1:40:23] that's where the church started
[1:40:25] so Mission work is sometimes one on one
[1:40:28] but I never would have been there
[1:40:31] if God hadn't turned me around
[1:40:34] and said no you're not going where you
[1:40:37] thought you were going
[1:40:39] and and you know who knows what we were
[1:40:42] saved from
[1:40:43] what what violence
[1:40:46] you know we we don't know we don't we
[1:40:49] don't anticipate that but there's always
[1:40:51] challenges
[1:40:52] so brother
[1:40:54] I call him brother lucky
[1:40:56] amen so we had a storm there on the lake
[1:40:59] and some trees came down by our huts
[1:41:01] and but we were spared and uh my Hut was
[1:41:05] spared anyway I had a I had a boat I get
[1:41:07] up in the morning it was about
[1:41:09] half an inch to an inch of water on the
[1:41:11] floor just where the wind and the rains
[1:41:14] come across the lake it's like an ocean
[1:41:16] and and it just those Huts are not
[1:41:18] waterproof the roofs are but the windows
[1:41:22] it just comes right in and the Thunder
[1:41:25] is sold those tropical storms it just
[1:41:28] shakes the Earth and uh so we get up
[1:41:30] that morning that that next morning well
[1:41:33] we're not going nowhere
[1:41:34] you know so we just we just had to stay
[1:41:36] there and witness to Lucky
[1:41:39] and eat good African food
[1:41:42] amen those are the huts
[1:41:45] that's what they look like and they're
[1:41:47] well constructed it's just it's just
[1:41:49] some of it's old
[1:41:51] so I just want to give you a kind of a
[1:41:52] flavor
[1:41:53] and that's what happened and we get up
[1:41:55] the next day going to drive and that was
[1:41:56] those are the roads those are the
[1:41:58] highways
[1:41:59] and these people are you know lost a lot
[1:42:01] of people lost their homes but by the
[1:42:03] way before I forget this was prior to
[1:42:06] the cyclone in in uh
[1:42:09] March 12th the Cyclones hit Malawi just
[1:42:12] after I left here
[1:42:14] and they had devastated it was horrific
[1:42:17] it was just they you know I think there
[1:42:20] was 11 brother Harrison said they were
[1:42:22] they counted 11 Believers that lost
[1:42:24] their lives
[1:42:26] and uh you know a lot of other people
[1:42:29] lost their children
[1:42:30] if you saw the the mudslides in in blend
[1:42:33] tire that the the whole
[1:42:36] side of the mountains come down and the
[1:42:38] houses are gone and and of course we did
[1:42:41] that we were in that in 2019 and we did
[1:42:44] some relief in that then so it's just a
[1:42:47] constant
[1:42:49] you know it's just a constant challenge
[1:42:50] for them and they've you know they've
[1:42:53] devalued their currency so they're just
[1:42:55] you know even the Believers they're just
[1:42:57] crying out
[1:42:58] you know come Lord Jesus
[1:43:02] come
[1:43:03] they're they're crying out
[1:43:05] you know Saints we got it too good
[1:43:07] sometimes what I wonder if we don't need
[1:43:09] a little more of a squeeze
[1:43:11] you know and and then when that starts
[1:43:13] to happen then they they're just they're
[1:43:15] just crying out it's just like it's too
[1:43:18] hard to to even imagine like I had the
[1:43:21] pictures and I think I sent some
[1:43:23] pictures
[1:43:24] to some friends and some ministers and
[1:43:27] things but it's I didn't bring them here
[1:43:29] it's just too hard to look at
[1:43:32] it just
[1:43:33] it's too hard and uh but you know
[1:43:37] they're Believers and you know we can
[1:43:39] help in word and deed we can do
[1:43:42] something you know anything we can do so
[1:43:45] um we're trying to do that
[1:43:48] some of the stores and places that were
[1:43:50] flooded then this is not the cyclone
[1:43:53] this is just a monsoon kind of heavy
[1:43:56] rain
[1:43:58] and that's what they that's what they
[1:44:00] deal with so we
[1:44:03] we went to uh while we're in Monkey Bay
[1:44:06] we went to this church and when we were
[1:44:09] young people in in Edmonton with brother
[1:44:12] hillebrandt as young people we packed
[1:44:14] books and we sent them off to far away
[1:44:17] countries and we didn't know who they
[1:44:19] were going to or any anywhere they were
[1:44:21] going to but some of them were going to
[1:44:23] Monkey Bay and when I got to Monkey Bay
[1:44:26] I said there's a church here I want to
[1:44:28] go there
[1:44:29] so we went to Monkey Bay and uh uh I had
[1:44:32] his name written down but I forgot its
[1:44:34] name now the pastor anyway we met the
[1:44:36] pastor his wife we came in I was still a
[1:44:38] little bit hoarse but they you know they
[1:44:40] they put pressure on you you want us we
[1:44:42] want you to say something we want you to
[1:44:44] speak so I you know God give me back my
[1:44:46] voice at that service
[1:44:49] give me back my voice
[1:44:51] so I was able to get going a little bit
[1:44:53] there and encourage them
[1:44:55] that's their little that's their little
[1:44:57] church in Monkey Bay
[1:44:59] that's the pastor in his wife
[1:45:01] and they greet you
[1:45:03] in the name of the Lord they greet you
[1:45:05] and then you have family over there I
[1:45:08] told them I said you didn't know you had
[1:45:10] a white brother
[1:45:12] in your family I said you didn't know
[1:45:14] that said that I we we as young people
[1:45:17] we we did something we we went over we
[1:45:19] we did something
[1:45:21] you can do something young people
[1:45:23] you do something for God not know what
[1:45:25] the church is going to do for you

[1:47:15] that brother Harrison was just just
[1:47:17] heartbroken when he heard you know he
[1:47:19] had gone but you know he just he just
[1:47:21] flew away he just beat us all there
[1:47:25] amen and he had a had a great testimony
[1:47:27] for the Gideon and uh I just loved his
[1:47:30] ministry
[1:47:32] so they they they received those I
[1:47:34] wanted to take a picture of those at
[1:47:36] brother Harrison's place
[1:47:38] this is another brother we he uh wanted
[1:47:41] me to see his name is Julius
[1:47:43] and he came out of the Pentecostal
[1:47:45] Church some maybe five years now and
[1:47:48] he's his church is growing
[1:47:50] this church was destroyed in 2019 and we
[1:47:55] had a meeting there the roof was caved
[1:47:57] in and we were kind of just with the
[1:47:59] walls and and so
[1:48:02] brother Jerry had sent some help
[1:48:04] the pastor in Spruce Grove by the Jerry
[1:48:06] Fury and uh we put a new roof on it
[1:48:10] amen so now they got a new roof he was
[1:48:12] so happy and you know he was just
[1:48:14] thanking us and he wanted us to see the
[1:48:16] church and so we did and
[1:48:19] and that's him there that's brother
[1:48:20] Julius
[1:48:22] and uh I call him Julius Caesar
[1:48:26] and I I always got a name for everybody
[1:48:28] you know like when I get there like John
[1:48:30] the Baptist or this is John the Baptist
[1:48:32] this is Julius Caesar and he's he's a
[1:48:34] he's a fireball and uh he he's he's
[1:48:38] really loves the word he loves the
[1:48:40] message and his church is growing so he
[1:48:42] said you know what I need he said you
[1:48:44] know I need a sound system because the
[1:48:46] Muslim down the street the Muslim Church
[1:48:47] they got these big speakers and then
[1:48:49] they you know yeah
[1:48:56] you know six o'clock in the morning
[1:48:59] is it is it six and five or something
[1:49:02] like every day like okay now I know what
[1:49:05] time it is you know he said they have
[1:49:07] theirs if I had a little sound system he
[1:49:10] said and a brother in brother Jerry's
[1:49:11] Church he's he's good with technology he
[1:49:14] said I can get that
[1:49:15] I know what to give
[1:49:17] so there you go you know he's going to
[1:49:19] have his sound system and he wants some
[1:49:21] cement on the walls so that water see
[1:49:23] the trouble is there with their
[1:49:24] buildings the water washes the mud away
[1:49:28] you know if it's bricks and mud it's
[1:49:30] going to wash away but if you've got
[1:49:31] some purging on it then that keeps keeps
[1:49:34] it from so he's kind of now he's
[1:49:37] proactive right and he's just putting
[1:49:40] those little things in you know but if
[1:49:43] we could just have this you know so we
[1:49:45] were trying to help him out in his
[1:49:47] church this is a brother Dixon's
[1:49:50] condojis original Church in blantire
[1:49:56] so we want to have some meetings there
[1:49:58] my voice came back and so
[1:50:00] we were taking meetings of brother
[1:50:03] brother
[1:50:05] Dixon's old church which is now owned by
[1:50:07] the Salvation Army
[1:50:10] um
[1:50:11] we had good meetings there and a lot of
[1:50:14] people responded now I I just thought
[1:50:17] this trip had turned out different so it
[1:50:19] turned out different than I thought I
[1:50:21] thought I was going to be in Kenya I was
[1:50:23] going to be in Uganda I was going to be
[1:50:24] in Ethiopian churches I was going to be
[1:50:26] and it turned out I was in local
[1:50:28] churches in Malawi just local meanings
[1:50:31] not a convention not but it was just a
[1:50:35] special special time and the church
[1:50:37] really responded there was many Souls
[1:50:39] gave their heart to God here
[1:50:41] and the rededications and people
[1:50:44] standing for their loved ones standing
[1:50:47] for backsliders
[1:50:49] you know coming in and I found that my
[1:50:52] whole trip there was people coming for
[1:50:54] prayer standing for someone else
[1:50:57] and I just said this is a this is like a
[1:50:59] theme you know this is like that you
[1:51:02] know we're getting close Saints it's
[1:51:04] time for them to come in it's time for
[1:51:06] the backsliders to come back
[1:51:08] amen and I just thought wow God is doing
[1:51:11] something and uh you know in Germany
[1:51:14] also see the same the same thing
[1:51:16] happening in Germany people standing for
[1:51:18] for brothers and people in prison
[1:51:21] and lost children
[1:51:23] and uh just
[1:51:25] it just was so good to see the response
[1:51:28] here we had a wonderful meetings here in
[1:51:30] in blanter and uh it just this is where
[1:51:34] the last time we were there and they had
[1:51:36] the tent meetings outside and then there
[1:51:39] was about 5 000 people and the tents
[1:51:41] blew away
[1:51:42] you know I shared that didn't I with you
[1:51:44] amen and God stopped that storm and it
[1:51:48] went right around blantar
[1:51:49] because we spoke it I said you know and
[1:51:52] and so you know the expectation
[1:51:55] just expectation Saints we need
[1:51:58] expectation
[1:51:59] it's not all for them
[1:52:02] it's for us we need expectation God you
[1:52:04] know when I come here Sunday morning
[1:52:06] listen to brother Daniel I want
[1:52:07] expectation
[1:52:09] you know I I just don't want to be you
[1:52:11] know well what's he going to say now
[1:52:14] you know or you know I want expectation
[1:52:16] God you're going to speak to me
[1:52:18] you're going to give me directions I
[1:52:20] will guide you with mine I ministering
[1:52:23] spirits
[1:52:24] to them that'll be heirs to eternal life
[1:52:28] and that's that's what we have so we had
[1:52:30] wonderful meetings there again in
[1:52:32] blantar
[1:52:34] uh
[1:52:36] you know I just I just kind of
[1:52:38] heard that voice
[1:52:40] you know the reason why this has
[1:52:42] happened he said God said I want
[1:52:44] fellowship with you
[1:52:46] I want I want to walk I want you to walk
[1:52:49] with me
[1:52:51] remember the prophet was up on the
[1:52:52] mountain and that voice spoke
[1:52:55] who who who who would not say that
[1:52:57] brother Brandon walked with God
[1:53:00] the the life he had the Supernatural and
[1:53:03] he saw all these things happen and
[1:53:05] visitation and angels and and yet God
[1:53:08] says now I want you to walk with me
[1:53:11] in in the power of the Resurrection in a
[1:53:14] body body change that's what happened to
[1:53:16] brother Branham on that mountain he had
[1:53:19] a body change
[1:53:20] amen he saw himself young again
[1:53:23] right so that's how God wants us to see
[1:53:26] you know he he looked at your perfect
[1:53:29] picture
[1:53:31] right he looked at it and he said he
[1:53:34] still it's still beholding the face of
[1:53:36] the father
[1:53:38] that's what I wanted to speak to you
[1:53:40] that really opened up to me in Africa
[1:53:42] and it's time for these things now
[1:53:44] it's time for it's time for a body
[1:53:46] change
[1:53:47] it's you know if you're satisfied with a
[1:53:49] good church then brother Rand just said
[1:53:50] stay there
[1:53:52] but if you believe there's more
[1:53:54] I'm not looking for just a good church
[1:53:56] I'm looking for a new body
[1:53:58] amen I am brother Daniel I'm I'm tired
[1:54:01] of this pest house amen I want to change
[1:54:06] and so we uh we left we left there we
[1:54:10] had meetings there
[1:54:12] and I emphasized God wants your
[1:54:16] fellowship
[1:54:18] amen God wants your fellowship
[1:54:22] every one of you he wants your
[1:54:25] fellowship
[1:54:26] you know not just the pastor's
[1:54:28] fellowship or you know some other other
[1:54:30] person's Fellowship he wants your
[1:54:32] fellowship and that really came real to
[1:54:35] me that God said no matter how I got to
[1:54:37] stop you how I got to slow you down I'm
[1:54:40] gonna get your ear
[1:54:42] I'm going to get you listening to me and
[1:54:44] I I heard things and things opened up to
[1:54:46] me that never opened up to me all my
[1:54:49] life and the message since I come in the
[1:54:51] message I had some questions that just
[1:54:53] one after the other
[1:54:55] just done done done oh that's how that
[1:54:58] fits that's how that fits I don't need
[1:55:01] to go around preaching it as Doctrine
[1:55:03] but I know myself there's you know we
[1:55:06] have the answer to the devil's questions
[1:55:09] this message it's laying in the message
[1:55:11] rapturing faith is there amen so uh you
[1:55:15] know we're getting so close to that now
[1:55:17] to that body changing
[1:55:19] you know so we had we went to melange
[1:55:21] and that was my heart's desire when I
[1:55:24] got there I thought it's just like my
[1:55:26] home Church there it's right below the
[1:55:28] mountain there and it's a small it's not
[1:55:31] a big church it's a smaller church but
[1:55:33] everyone comes from different places
[1:55:35] from it's close to Mozambique
[1:55:38] and so they all come in there and that's
[1:55:41] one of my favorite places to go
[1:55:43] and we had meetings there
[1:55:46] is that a is that a video brother
[1:55:49] is there a video on there
[1:55:51] I don't know if there's a video
[1:55:54] that might not be it but anyway we were
[1:55:56] in this little church and had meetings
[1:55:58] there
[1:55:59] it was hot
[1:56:02] I mean they are from there
[1:56:06] and it's like the oven you know I know
[1:56:09] I'm in for a bake a bake house like
[1:56:11] really this is going to be a hot one my
[1:56:14] tie brother Daniel I've never thought my
[1:56:17] tie was dripping water
[1:56:20] like it was and I was just a blotch you
[1:56:23] know but I thought you know after God
[1:56:25] had healed me I wanted to say Satan
[1:56:28] you're not stopping me amen nothing will
[1:56:31] stop me now and uh we we had a great
[1:56:34] service there in that in that little
[1:56:36] church and again we had maybe 12 15
[1:56:39] Souls
[1:56:41] amen praise God
[1:56:44] praise God
[1:56:47] amen and the deacons would baptize him
[1:56:50] later
[1:56:52] so you know it's rot sometimes with
[1:56:56] difficulty and obstacles but you know
[1:56:59] the last one is going to be an expensive
[1:57:01] one
[1:57:02] amen it's going to be a lot of effort
[1:57:04] and it might not be we're not looking
[1:57:07] for crowds we're looking for the last
[1:57:09] predestinated seed that's what we're
[1:57:12] looking for
[1:57:12] and we were able to share with that
[1:57:15] share the share the word here this is a
[1:57:19] little school this is an old school
[1:57:21] building two school buildings that
[1:57:23] brother Harrison just put a down payment
[1:57:25] on and he's going to connect those roofs
[1:57:27] and he's going to make a church for that
[1:57:29] area
[1:57:30] so he's a go-getter brother and he's
[1:57:33] like he's a contractor he's like he sees
[1:57:35] potential and you know and uh you know I
[1:57:39] was telling brother Dan a little bit bro
[1:57:40] brother Harrison he's you know he's been
[1:57:42] he's been robbed he's been cheated by
[1:57:46] even even believers
[1:57:49] Take the Money and Run and you know and
[1:57:52] put his own livelihood in there a place
[1:57:54] that he could have bought his own house
[1:57:55] he put it for a church to build a church
[1:57:59] and it was taken from him taken right
[1:58:01] out from under so you know this kind of
[1:58:03] guy he is and uh you know that's why
[1:58:06] it's good to be to be there they still
[1:58:08] need apostles
[1:58:10] you know a missionary the prophet said
[1:58:12] is an apostle
[1:58:14] and and the prophet said an apostle is a
[1:58:17] Setter in order
[1:58:19] so you need things sometimes set in
[1:58:21] order
[1:58:22] and uh in in blantire when I got there
[1:58:25] there was a Minister's meeting on
[1:58:28] printing books in lantire there was some
[1:58:31] confusion some issues on translation and
[1:58:34] books that were being already printed
[1:58:36] shipped in from other countries that
[1:58:38] were
[1:58:39] that were not saying what the prophet
[1:58:41] said or it was Lost in Translation we
[1:58:44] were speaking about that today how easy
[1:58:46] they told me the ministers told me one
[1:58:48] word Brother Martin and tachiwa can
[1:58:50] change the whole meaning of the context
[1:58:53] and he said that's what it's doing
[1:58:55] so we need to tell these brothers you
[1:58:58] know to to change that so they were
[1:59:01] trying to you know get some ideas and we
[1:59:03] worked together and we had some we had
[1:59:05] some constructive uh
[1:59:07] meetings there and some issues were
[1:59:09] settled and I just told them you know
[1:59:11] you know don't don't try to go and
[1:59:14] correct other people's mistakes and
[1:59:16] waste time and energy you do what God
[1:59:20] tells you to do you do what God puts on
[1:59:24] your heart to do and if God puts on your
[1:59:26] heart to print them here not in China
[1:59:29] don't freedom and shine friend I'm here
[1:59:33] put them right here in your own country
[1:59:34] and that's what they're doing
[1:59:37] amen they're gonna they're gonna do more
[1:59:39] I mean
[1:59:40] uh there's a lot of people getting
[1:59:42] behind it because it's then they have
[1:59:44] oversight
[1:59:46] all the elders they they know what the
[1:59:48] message says right they know English but
[1:59:51] you know 50 percent no chichiwa in
[1:59:54] Malawi so it's a 50 50. so they need
[1:59:58] they need the correct translation
[2:00:00] and so brother Harrison is working with
[2:00:03] the brother from voice of God Saeed he's
[2:00:05] working with Syed he's he's got all the
[2:00:08] templates and uh
[2:00:10] you know
[2:00:11] I said why not do it here
[2:00:13] just do it here so they've been doing it
[2:00:15] now the last year and a half two years
[2:00:17] so they got the church age if they got
[2:00:19] the seals printed there they've been
[2:00:21] interpreted already but they're redoing
[2:00:24] them because there's more and more
[2:00:25] people coming in there's more and more
[2:00:28] churches that when the last left the
[2:00:29] last time in 19 after I'd left there was
[2:00:33] 17 more churches started
[2:00:35] now try to Pastor them
[2:00:37] try to send pastors out try to try to
[2:00:40] support them try to help them with books
[2:00:42] try to it's just the beginning
[2:00:44] so you know there's there's so much to
[2:00:47] do
[2:00:48] amen and uh so brother Harrison's doing
[2:00:50] that we went to the long way on the way
[2:00:52] home just before I went home I was
[2:00:54] flying out of the Capitol spoke for
[2:00:56] brother uh Wilton mccandawar and he's
[2:00:59] been a he's been a stalwart and steady
[2:01:02] brother he's just a
[2:01:05] he's just a big teddy bear is what he is
[2:01:07] he's just he's got a real soft nature
[2:01:10] although he's intimidating too and uh he
[2:01:14] he was just so Overjoyed we spoke there
[2:01:17] on
[2:01:18] some things I'd like to share with you
[2:01:21] and I never seen him so excited so he's
[2:01:24] he's planning on some meetings in
[2:01:25] December
[2:01:26] some some bigger meetings in December so
[2:01:28] we want to pray about that and go back
[2:01:31] to his congregation there he took me to
[2:01:34] this place
[2:01:35] that's that's the monument they just put
[2:01:38] up in the last five years or so to uh
[2:01:41] Banda and I forget his first name now Dr
[2:01:44] Banda they call him he was their first
[2:01:46] president in Malawi And he as a young
[2:01:50] man he he left Malawi walking to South
[2:01:54] Africa he walked from Malawi you you
[2:01:57] drove it
[2:01:58] so you imagine walking
[2:02:01] he walked from Malawi to to South Africa
[2:02:05] as a young man he got on a boat I don't
[2:02:08] know how he got on that boat but he got
[2:02:10] on that boat and he sailed to America
[2:02:13] and he sailed to America he started
[2:02:14] working as a laborer in America and you
[2:02:17] know what he had a he had a vision that
[2:02:20] he could do something great
[2:02:23] you know Saints we need a vision without
[2:02:25] a vision the people perish we need a
[2:02:28] vision that God God wants to do
[2:02:30] something great
[2:02:32] God wants to do something great in my
[2:02:34] life
[2:02:34] he does he wants to do something great
[2:02:37] in your life
[2:02:39] and I was just telling that to a young
[2:02:40] man in Phoenix amen and you know it I
[2:02:44] think there's two people going to be
[2:02:45] baptized there
[2:02:47] in Phoenix so I mean you know I said God
[2:02:50] wants and and Satan's just trying to
[2:02:53] suppress you and press you down and give
[2:02:57] you complexes and I said you know you
[2:02:59] you have you ever been baptized in the
[2:03:01] name of no I haven't I heard it all my
[2:03:03] life my mother told me I said you need
[2:03:05] to get baptized
[2:03:08] that's it that's that was a key you
[2:03:11] don't you don't go any further until you
[2:03:14] take a step
[2:03:15] you got to take a step and and and that
[2:03:18] came up but uh he when he walked to
[2:03:21] South Africa he got on that boat he came
[2:03:23] to America he started working as a
[2:03:25] laborer shoveling labor work and his
[2:03:28] boss saw his work ethic remember the the
[2:03:31] the slave that was the King's son
[2:03:34] he saw his his work ethic and he said
[2:03:36] you know what he said you need to go to
[2:03:38] school
[2:03:40] so he he said I'm going to pay for you
[2:03:42] to go to school
[2:03:43] and he paid for him to go to school to
[2:03:46] become a doctor he got into medicine and
[2:03:49] he finished up in the UK he finished his
[2:03:51] studies in the UK came back to Malawi
[2:03:54] and ran against the the government that
[2:03:58] time was more a dictatorship but it was
[2:04:01] it was used to be Swaziland and anyway
[2:04:03] he ran to become president and he became
[2:04:06] president
[2:04:08] he was he was he was educated in Indiana
[2:04:11] Jeffersonville Indiana
[2:04:15] he was he was he went to University in
[2:04:17] Indiana so then he could becomes
[2:04:19] president and then uh all of a sudden
[2:04:22] needs these people in politics you know
[2:04:24] wherever the president goes they have
[2:04:26] like a celebration and they have the
[2:04:28] women dance for the president
[2:04:30] and the Believers wouldn't dance
[2:04:33] and they said you got to dance and so
[2:04:36] they were back and forth they hauled
[2:04:37] them into into into jail and intimidated
[2:04:40] them and then they start putting them in
[2:04:42] jail
[2:04:43] and separating the mothers and and the
[2:04:46] children and you know and these are
[2:04:48] believers they're all in jail they're
[2:04:50] going to jail and brother Dixon he was
[2:04:51] one of them he said well I'm going to
[2:04:53] jail too if you take my flock I'm going
[2:04:55] to go with with them so he was in jail
[2:04:57] and they were getting converted in jail
[2:05:01] even with the lice and all the rest of
[2:05:04] it
[2:05:05] you know and and so this president got
[2:05:09] wind
[2:05:10] of this these people that were believing
[2:05:13] uh the teachings of William Branham he
[2:05:16] got wind that they were in jail he said
[2:05:18] let those people go
[2:05:20] said don't bother those people those are
[2:05:22] real Christians
[2:05:24] because he knew brother Branham
[2:05:26] he knew about brother rand's message
[2:05:29] amen so you know as a young man God used
[2:05:32] him in the secular World in politics but
[2:05:36] he used him to deliver God's people
[2:05:38] Timothy said first of all there should
[2:05:41] be prayer supplication intercession for
[2:05:43] all men and those in authority
[2:05:47] that we might lead a Peaceable and Godly
[2:05:50] life
[2:05:51] amen so
[2:05:53] because God want that all men be saved
[2:05:56] so what he did there for the Believers
[2:05:58] and I just I knew that history and I
[2:06:01] said I want to see I want to see that
[2:06:03] and so he took me down there and we
[2:06:06] enjoyed that Fellowship
[2:06:07] so we emphasized uh
[2:06:10] like I said we emphasized God wants your
[2:06:13] fellowship that was kind of the theme
[2:06:15] during the during those meetings and he
[2:06:17] that is within you
[2:06:19] amen so other issues came up
[2:06:23] um you know like there's always issues
[2:06:25] and I was able to
[2:06:27] ordain certain elders
[2:06:30] and I think I ordained 12 Deacons
[2:06:32] and ministers and trustees and
[2:06:36] treasurers and you know they just all
[2:06:39] want to come and and get
[2:06:41] get ordained and so it just was
[2:06:44] everything just the just everything hit
[2:06:47] at the right time
[2:06:48] see and I didn't have any of that
[2:06:50] planned
[2:06:51] I like that when God leads then it's the
[2:06:55] right time
[2:06:56] dedicated a lot of babies and things
[2:06:58] like that at those meetings in in
[2:07:00] milanji so after this we traveled from
[2:07:04] the long way back to Kenya for our
[2:07:06] flight home and then there was Brothers
[2:07:08] realized I got my boys back so they
[2:07:10] wanted me to speak down there
[2:07:12] and I said no I don't I'm going home
[2:07:15] it's been a month now and I'm I'm going
[2:07:18] home and uh so I just I I saw the hand
[2:07:21] of the Lord all the way through but the
[2:07:23] brother Wonder Brothers that were in
[2:07:25] Kenya he got to uh he had a small uh
[2:07:28] Uber business and I wanted to support
[2:07:30] him so I hired him for a day and and we
[2:07:34] had breakfast and dinner and he drove
[2:07:36] this around uh kind of the
[2:07:39] it's not the Safari but it's just it
[2:07:41] opens up to to uh
[2:07:44] it opens up in uh
[2:07:47] Kenya in Nairobi the Safari opens up to
[2:07:50] the city actually the Lions can actually
[2:07:52] get in there and there's been a few get
[2:07:54] in there there's no fences right but
[2:07:56] they'll they'll stay keep their distance
[2:07:57] but we were just driving in his Uber
[2:08:00] thing or through the through that area
[2:08:02] and uh we saw these beautiful animals
[2:08:04] and I just thought I'd show that for the
[2:08:06] for the children if there's any here but
[2:08:10] uh you know we had a guy with us
[2:08:14] and and I read the scripture I will
[2:08:17] guide you
[2:08:18] Saints thank God for a guide
[2:08:21] you know how the prophet preached the
[2:08:23] guide
[2:08:24] when he touched that line
[2:08:26] oh I'm saved my wife is saved my
[2:08:29] family's saved amen because I got a hold
[2:08:31] of the line
[2:08:33] amen and this little guy he was oh Abu
[2:08:37] was his name
[2:08:38] and uh he was just terrific young guy
[2:08:41] exuberant and loved animals and he was
[2:08:46] telling me you know they they all the
[2:08:48] older stripes are all different you know
[2:08:49] that how many knew that a zebra stripes
[2:08:52] every one of them is like a fingerprint
[2:08:54] he said every one or different I said no
[2:08:56] he said well yeah you should know that
[2:08:58] he said
[2:08:59] I probably should but we don't see no
[2:09:01] too many zebras around
[2:09:04] around Northern Canada so uh anyway I
[2:09:08] just start looking at their stripes and
[2:09:09] I was thinking yeah yeah they all are
[2:09:12] different
[2:09:13] you know and we're all different
[2:09:15] we're all different striped
[2:09:17] we're all different Natures we have our
[2:09:19] quirks and our quarks and you know and
[2:09:22] this God loves us just the way we are
[2:09:25] and uh so I got to see some zebras just
[2:09:28] you know I was God was just giving me
[2:09:30] some down time
[2:09:32] after the meetings and I just I just so
[2:09:35] appreciate it see the prophet said in
[2:09:37] things that are to be God has everything
[2:09:39] prepared
[2:09:40] when you came to the Earth he had
[2:09:42] everything prepared
[2:09:44] now now it's the same in our lives he
[2:09:46] has everything prepared we just need to
[2:09:48] follow in the channel and prayer is the
[2:09:50] key to get into the program of God right
[2:09:53] so he we just need to wait on God wait
[2:09:55] on our ministry some beautiful animals
[2:09:57] there and uh we just saw them like right
[2:10:00] up close too this one here was killed
[2:10:03] right as we were there
[2:10:06] two lions and we we didn't see them then
[2:10:08] we looked in the ditch and we saw them
[2:10:10] hiding in the ditch they had just killed
[2:10:12] him see them hiding up there
[2:10:15] and they were just resting from the the
[2:10:17] guys that know they're resting now from
[2:10:18] the kill because they're young lions and
[2:10:21] they had to be when they're young Lions
[2:10:22] they're pushed out of the of the herd
[2:10:25] right there were two siblings a brother
[2:10:27] and a sister and they're pushed out so
[2:10:29] now you go hunt on your own
[2:10:31] so they they went out and they they got
[2:10:33] this uh
[2:10:34] this wildebeest I think it was and see
[2:10:37] they're hiding there and we're only like
[2:10:38] 50 feet
[2:10:40] and and the windows are down and I told
[2:10:42] her brother I said I'm not really that
[2:10:43] comfortable with the windows down like
[2:10:45] what if this thing fails right and and
[2:10:47] they're they're actually looking at some
[2:10:48] other animals on the other side of us
[2:10:51] something if they come charging and you
[2:10:53] know your imagination goes and they're
[2:10:55] going to be in the car with us you know
[2:10:57] it could get messy you know like I don't
[2:11:00] know if I have enough Faith sometimes I
[2:11:03] just said let's err on the side of
[2:11:05] caution and roll the windows up because
[2:11:07] there's no air conditioning right so
[2:11:09] anyway they're watching and see he just
[2:11:11] sees his mouth is all bloody and he's
[2:11:14] just he's just resting from that kill
[2:11:16] amen the Lord God has spoken amen the
[2:11:21] lion has roared
[2:11:23] amen surely the Lord will do nothing but
[2:11:26] he Reveals His secrets to the servants
[2:11:28] the prophets amen so I was just kind of
[2:11:32] we came up on that they were eating as
[2:11:34] they as we were there they were eating
[2:11:35] one of these they just caught one of
[2:11:37] these and they were flipping it over and
[2:11:38] eating it as we were watching so that
[2:11:41] was the that was just the appetizer and
[2:11:44] then he said no they wait till the
[2:11:46] evening then they get the wildebeest
[2:11:47] then they go to him
[2:11:49] but they're just just just kind of
[2:11:51] having an appetizer here so
[2:11:54] I thought and this one they try to pull
[2:11:56] down but he got away
[2:11:58] he was so strong see the other ones the
[2:12:01] ribs were showing so he was weak but
[2:12:03] this one this one they couldn't get him
[2:12:05] down see they were too young
[2:12:07] so this one was powerful
[2:12:09] and that just happened when we were
[2:12:11] there
[2:12:12] so then we were just driving by and all
[2:12:15] these animals you know like I never got
[2:12:17] to see this before and it was kind of
[2:12:19] nice like I don't go on the mission
[2:12:21] field for safaris but God gave me a
[2:12:24] little Safari and a in an old uh
[2:12:28] Toyota small little Toyota
[2:12:30] and I just thought thank you Lord you
[2:12:33] know you got to see this is the
[2:12:34] Undertaker
[2:12:36] and he's waiting for the kill and when
[2:12:38] they're done he just kind of just walks
[2:12:40] around you know
[2:12:42] looks around he's like and he said no
[2:12:44] he's the Undertaker
[2:12:46] so he cleans things up so and this guy
[2:12:49] the guy told us this uh this an ostrich
[2:12:52] for any of you that don't know little
[2:12:54] children at the back that's an ostrich
[2:12:56] and that's a that's a male ostrich and
[2:12:59] he's dancing for the female ostrich and
[2:13:03] the male that can dance the best he's
[2:13:05] the one that gets the female
[2:13:07] so they put on a real show man like you
[2:13:11] talk about dance
[2:13:12] wow they can dance I thought wow he said
[2:13:17] no that's what they're doing that's how
[2:13:18] they win you know no dance no wife
[2:13:22] so
[2:13:23] so he you know he told us things that we
[2:13:27] didn't know they would sit down in the
[2:13:28] bottom and then get their wings and then
[2:13:30] just put all dust over themselves it's
[2:13:32] so they're just waiting for the rain see
[2:13:34] how dry it is and when they do that he
[2:13:36] said they're cooling themselves off
[2:13:39] so I just started to appreciate this
[2:13:41] guide
[2:13:42] you know the things he was saying and he
[2:13:44] made us laugh and you know he just he
[2:13:46] just he just knew so much that
[2:13:49] I thought you know a guide is important
[2:13:52] you know you can you know and you pay
[2:13:54] him 20 bucks and he's so happy
[2:13:56] 20 bucks I said let's buy him lunch
[2:14:00] let's do this for him let's do that for
[2:14:01] him you know it it was just a blessing
[2:14:04] to have him in the car talking to us and
[2:14:07] you know we wouldn't have picked out
[2:14:09] some of these things I thought they were
[2:14:10] rocks he said no they're they're that's
[2:14:12] hippos there let's look a little closer
[2:14:15] so you zoomed in sure enough they're
[2:14:17] just and the alligators
[2:14:20] um alligators there the when I was in
[2:14:22] Monkey Bay I did get into Lake Malawi
[2:14:26] once just to cool off
[2:14:27] in my clothes and I almost drowned
[2:14:31] but when I saw the sign this time that
[2:14:33] said swim at your own risk and there's a
[2:14:36] big alligator there
[2:14:38] I thought no not this time
[2:14:41] no I'm not no matter how hot it is I'm
[2:14:43] not going in that water and uh so they
[2:14:46] know how to do it but
[2:14:48] that's that's Nairobi and and this and
[2:14:51] that's open to
[2:14:53] open to the animals
[2:14:55] also this one here I saw just before I
[2:14:58] left that is a mamba snake
[2:15:00] and he is you know I expected him to be
[2:15:04] an ugly really ugly he's a he's a he's a
[2:15:09] Slicker he he looks good like when he
[2:15:12] moves and stuff like he's so subtle and
[2:15:16] uh you know that the mama snake brother
[2:15:18] Brown talked about
[2:15:19] you know it was on that Highway
[2:15:22] and that's what I preached on
[2:15:24] I preached on in Kenya I said the
[2:15:26] information Highway
[2:15:28] that's what he was on that's what he's
[2:15:29] on today he's smart
[2:15:32] the children of this world are much
[2:15:34] wiser in their generation than the
[2:15:36] children of light
[2:15:38] amen so I thought I want to see one up
[2:15:41] close so they they they had these and
[2:15:44] then they had other snakes that you
[2:15:45] could put on you
[2:15:46] and and they wrap around you sort of
[2:15:49] thing and everybody was oh let's try it
[2:15:50] let's try it I said no thanks
[2:15:52] and they say oh you're scared and
[2:15:54] everything no I'm not scared I just
[2:15:56] don't like those guys
[2:15:58] you know I don't want to be associated
[2:15:59] with them so I didn't put on any snakes
[2:16:02] but he was
[2:16:04] he actually that was only a different
[2:16:06] angle but he's actually good looking
[2:16:10] sin is beautiful
[2:16:13] sin is beautiful
[2:16:14] and that's the deception
[2:16:17] it can be so beautiful you know the way
[2:16:19] of a snake on a rock right the way of a
[2:16:22] man with a maid
[2:16:23] you know so so many things are so
[2:16:25] wonderful for me and Satan is worshiped
[2:16:28] in Beauty and I just thought in the
[2:16:30] animal kingdom you know you can see all
[2:16:32] these things and being in Africa but
[2:16:34] I'll just end with that scripture Isaiah
[2:16:36] 6 and 8. you know
[2:16:38] who who will I send who will go for me
[2:16:42] my brothers mentioned this morning you
[2:16:44] don't need to go to Africa
[2:16:46] you can go downtown
[2:16:48] we can go downtown we can be like
[2:16:50] brother Marshall have have a day where
[2:16:53] you can feed some poor people
[2:16:54] right get together do something young
[2:16:57] people you can do something
[2:16:59] and it's right here you know America
[2:17:01] needs missionaries
[2:17:03] leaning missionaries here
[2:17:06] yeah we're so Heathen now we you know
[2:17:09] you talk about church people don't even
[2:17:11] go to church now
[2:17:13] you know so I just thought uh
[2:17:16] you know that's that's how it ended but
[2:17:18] I wanted to bring something on that uh I
[2:17:20] just had a little experience coming down
[2:17:21] and I know I've been long
[2:17:23] coming down we've passed through Montana
[2:17:27] and the Idaho border and we saw we saw
[2:17:31] the Seven Peaks that brother Branham
[2:17:33] talked about when he came from Canada
[2:17:36] hunting and and he he mentions it in
[2:17:39] standing in the gap
[2:17:40] you ever read that message
[2:17:42] standing in the Gap how many read that
[2:17:44] message
[2:17:45] amen and I just I never thought of that
[2:17:47] and I thought this somewhere along here
[2:17:49] honey I said this is where uh brother
[2:17:51] Branham saw those Peaks oh yeah so just
[2:17:54] the last Ridge before you come into
[2:17:55] Idaho last mountain range so sister
[2:17:58] Shelley she said they they look like
[2:18:00] ghost mountains and they were just
[2:18:02] pristine in the snow beautiful
[2:18:05] and sure enough my wife did I take the
[2:18:08] picture you I took the picture and I
[2:18:10] took the picture of that mountain range
[2:18:12] just in case we came down and we
[2:18:14] compared it it was exactly the same
[2:18:17] Mountain
[2:18:18] amen and you know you know what what God
[2:18:21] is speaking to me all the way down is
[2:18:24] you know you had a prophet we had a
[2:18:26] prophet that stood in the gap
[2:18:30] and he wanted to go do his own thing up
[2:18:32] in Canada and be a be a guide
[2:18:35] but you know he had to give that up
[2:18:38] he wanted to hunt president Daniel he
[2:18:39] loved hunting and he loved those things
[2:18:42] and he had to give that up that was his
[2:18:45] desire
[2:18:45] and he said you've got to let that go
[2:18:48] and uh so you know I was thinking I
[2:18:51] wasn't thinking about it really and then
[2:18:52] as I thought about it I said I'm going
[2:18:54] to listen to that message and and sure
[2:18:56] enough when we were driving then we were
[2:18:57] driving down the road after we saw that
[2:18:59] and I didn't tell my wife but my heart
[2:19:01] was jumping
[2:19:03] I I could scream I could shout I just
[2:19:07] felt the Holy Spirit like he said
[2:19:09] brother Daniel this morning when you
[2:19:10] came in here and you looked at the
[2:19:12] lights just that presence came and I
[2:19:15] couldn't tell her
[2:19:16] I couldn't tell her but I told her later
[2:19:18] something happened
[2:19:20] I said we you know we're on the right
[2:19:22] Road
[2:19:23] God said you're on the right road I
[2:19:26] don't have to push you now I don't have
[2:19:28] to push you through a pipe you'll just
[2:19:30] listen and you say go down here and
[2:19:32] speak these meetings and then go back
[2:19:34] then I can go and do that
[2:19:36] amen and I I didn't tell anyone else but
[2:19:39] I I just it was so strong it was just I
[2:19:43] I just hardly contain it just crying
[2:19:45] under my sunglasses and trying not to
[2:19:48] show anybody but you know that presence
[2:19:50] we had someone Saints in this generation
[2:19:53] that stood in the gap
[2:19:54] and that's what you know we all have
[2:19:57] complexes we all have our own desires
[2:19:59] our own plans but his our ways are not
[2:20:03] his ways our plans are not his plans
[2:20:06] sometimes amen so if we're just
[2:20:08] sensitive like that thorough bread amen
[2:20:11] then God can lead us
[2:20:13] and we'll let him lead us and and souls
[2:20:16] will come to the kingdom
[2:20:18] and when we let him do it
[2:20:21] amen I wouldn't have any success over
[2:20:23] there they wouldn't have even received
[2:20:24] my testimony those I wouldn't even got
[2:20:26] into those Ethiopian churches but in
[2:20:28] Malawi I did
[2:20:30] so you know God has a reason and I just
[2:20:33] want to thank my wife for coming with me
[2:20:35] this time
[2:20:37] amen without her there'd be no Ministry
[2:20:40] she is part of my Ministry and uh if it
[2:20:43] wasn't for her I wouldn't be here

[2:23:46] there was conviction here this morning
[2:23:48] and it's not shouting it's not a loud
[2:23:51] service but when it's quiet
[2:23:54] that's when God is dealing
[2:23:56] well you were dealing with us this
[2:23:57] morning you're dealing with me
[2:23:59] Lord I
[2:24:00] my big thing was I was selfish with my
[2:24:03] time
