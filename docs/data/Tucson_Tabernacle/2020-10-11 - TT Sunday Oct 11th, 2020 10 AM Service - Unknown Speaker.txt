amen aren't you glad that we serve a risen savior that we can call on in our time of need how many times he knows I'm thinking about the prayer requests being spoken each and every one of us can go back in in our minds and see how many times God's been called on the scene and the doctors might say it's over but it's not over until he says it's over so let's just lift our hands and our hearts up to the Lord and let's call on him let's ask him to come on the scene Heavenly Father what a privilege Lord that we can come before you not by anything that we can say or due but by that precious blood that makes us whiter than snow and you said that if we would ask anything in your name Lord you would do it father we lift up every single one of these needs our brother Jeffrey Lord God we're asking you to do something miraculous Lord this this is not over because the doctors say it's over it's over because you say it's over so we lift him up and we ask you to touch him father God we give you

completely whole in Jesus Christ's name Grant it Lord and father God you have heard all the you've heard all the requests that were made known and you you see each request beneath every heart father

other day Jonas was in his high chair at the in the kitchen and he's still less than a year old and usually have him buckled in but he somehow got out of the Buckle and he stood up in his high chair

and he and he said look mama look Jonas is standing up and he got her attention and she was able to quickly uh rescue him and I'm just thankful to the Lord that we forget those things so easily but

had passed away some number years ago and brother Harris and Smith and he went home to be with the Lord and has many grandchildren and children so if you'll remember him amen or remember his family this morning we know he's on to a better reward amen as Christians don't die amen his life is just really beginning um also brother Ron Spencer Pastor there uh in Virginia and and he's they've dealt

but also his church um is has a third funeral from uh a brother who passed away a deacon who passed away from Corona virus and so they're going to be having that funeral and so and also brother Ron is having a some Cancer Treatments coming this week so we want to remember uh brother Ronald Dean's family in the church there I believe that there's power in prayer and I believe that there's power when the family of God with love in their hearts join together and bind our faith together amen and stand against uh Satan amen and all of his attacks and all of his schemes uh also brother Donnie Reagan's daughter sister Erica uh who has been diagnosed with cancer is going in for Cancer Treatments this week that are scheduled and so he asked for special prayer uh also for her and so we just want to remember sister Erica maybe you have something upon your heart maybe a special need you just want to identify it by an uplifted hand amen and we'll just pray over that need amen let's read Isaiah chapter 4 and verse one I'd like to speak to you this morning and I've I've got quite quite a bit on my heart quite a bit that the Lord's just been dealing with me on and I know I won't get to this all um today so this morning so we'll get to what we don't get to today we'll try to pick up tonight and so I just trust that you came hungry amen and with an expectation for his word amen certainly appreciated brother Aaron Wednesday night and also brother Tim crw and we were able to stream uh some of those and sometimes catch the archive because it's the time shift is very different much later for us but you love the Lord Jesus amen and in that day I'd like to speak to you let me give you my title first and brothers I sent a PowerPoint I'd like to speak to you today on bride character bride character and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our approach I'd like you to turn also let me just find uh my scripture here I'd like you to turn also to Revelations chapter 21 and verse 9 we'll just read that and have you be seated Revelations chapter 21 just one real familiar scripture this morning Revelations 21 verse 9 and there came unto me one of the seven angels angs which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife Heavenly Father we're grateful to be called your children Lord to be elected in this late hour that we live in Lord we know that we see a world that's groping in darkness Lord for it's prophetic it's prophesied that that in this generation it would be an age of not just dark Darkness Lord but the Bible uses the word a gross darkness and we know that that gross Lord is a it's a way of measurement Lord It's like a pound or a weight and it would be it would be a gross which would be a thousand times darker than the darkest cave and Lord It's encroaching all around us it's pressing in father daily as we see the world going rapidly declining Lord but we're grateful today that we've received a light in the evening time for you said there shall be light in the darkest hour Lord and that light is causing us Lord to a life of Ascension not descending Lord with the world in chaos Lord but our message is Shalom and we're thankful for that this morning we speak it this morning we receive it Lord this morning I pray God that you would be in this service Lord for all that you've intended for it to be may we just pull on the word of God from our hungry Hearts we ask in Jesus Christ Christ's name and the church said amen you can be seated this morning Revelations 19:7 I'm going to read just a few scriptures here as we begin to go through this and like I said I've got a PowerPoint uh Brothers you can display whenever uh you'd like to we've got just so much here and and we may not get to it just for a moment Lord willing will get to it um before the before this service is over we know these scriptures very well and what we identify in the Bible is this Revelations 19:7 is identifying uh a a special group of people an elected group of people the Bible says in Revelations 19:7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready so what we find from the study of the word today is we could we could take many the Bible the uh speaks to many uh we we could say the Bible speaks specifically to many different subjects and a sermon could be upon any subject you could preach upon just uh uh it would you would you would never run out of subjects to minister on uh the Bible speaks of many different eras or ages or times uh the scripture uh speaks to certain groups of people very specific we know that the Bible speaks of Christ and we he also it also speaks of the Antichrist uh the Bible speaks of a True Vine and it also speaks of a false Vine uh it speaks of a beginning and it speaks of an end it speaks of an alpha and it speaks of an Omega uh and and we see the fruits of an evil uh a wicked one and the Bible also speaks of the fruit roots of the righteous one but ultimately out of all of the themes that you could find in the Bible you could preach on many different themes and the Bible has many themes that you can speak on and all of it is the truth and all of it has an application in fact there are certain things written in the word that doesn't apply at all to you or to me there are certain things that the Bible speaks of the tribulation uh that does doesn't apply to you thank thankful to God for that there are things that speaks about the vials and the plagues that doesn't apply to the Bride of Jesus Christ can you say Amen this morning stay right with me we're going to lay a foundation here so I just need you to stay focus because you I'll lose you uh in the middle if if I don't have you here at the beginning but it it it speaks specifically of certain times speaks of the Jews and Jacob's trouble and we know that would apply amen to a time when the bride is already gone but the bi the Bible has many things to say as the prophet of God in the church age book begins to speak about the two Vines and he says now the spirit speaks to both it speaks to the false Vine and it speaks to the True Vine we know brother brandom told us that the Bible has compound meanings it it speaks very literally of a Jonah who very literally went into the belly of a large fish and and and he and he was he was in the belly of that fish and and and we know the story of Jonah it was a literal man a real man a man who really lived very despite in spite of whatever modern science tells you that it's impossible for there to have been a well uh fish large enough to swallow a man and for the man to have uh gone through what he went through and they say it has to be allegory it has to be you know has to be a parable what brother bam said he was a very real man it was a very real fish who the Bible says God prepared for Jonah like brother Bram tells the little girl who says you know uh says you know I can't believe you believe in that story of Jonah little girl says well she he she says I do and he says what are you what are you going to do if you get to heaven and you and you find and you and he says uh and and you know and you you don't see Jonah she he says what are you g to ask him he says what if he's not there and she says well I guess you'll have to ask him for yourself then so he was a very real man it was a very real story but yet Jonah's life was actually greater a greater mystery of what happened to Jonah would be revealed in Christ for the Jesus quotes that and says there will be no sign given to you except that of Jonas who just as Jonah was in the belly of a well three days three nights so shall the son of man go into the heart of the earth and so we know just as a type that script had a compound meaning it had a compound uh it was it was brother brandom said it this way says that it's it's like a a Roman candle and he said it's like you know the firework of a Roman candle and he says each light that goes out gets brighter it's a different color but it all comes from the same source and he says just as a Roman Candle explodes in more Mysteries he said so this seven sealed book reveals and opens itself up and it and it just it it it it unveils it self before our eyes and brother brandham goes on further and and you see the Bible speaks of Christ and it says of his kingdom speaking of the kingdom of Christ there shall be no end and the scripture says in other words you know as humans we think of Heaven that well that's it that's the Finish Line no brother that's just the beginning we think of the finality of all of life will be consummated all and it'll be everything will be swallowed up and and and and everything will be finished but the Bible says his kingdom shall have no end and brother bham says he'll continue to reveal himself through the ceaseless ages to come now that blows the mind of theologians up but a seventh grade Kentucky hillbilly uh uh who had Revelation from God not theology from man said his kingdom shall never end so it's compound it's ever unfolding it's ever you're ever growing you're you're always expanding I love that and the Bible so we know that ultimately out of all the themes that the scripture speaks about there is one subject there there there is there is one subject that comes through very clear and that's marriage in fact the Bible starts with marriage starts as a book of marriage the Bible speaks of this first couple and I want you to keep that in your mind as we know as we uh spent just a minute to show you that all of these things are compound meaning they would all have a a fulfillment in in their in the in the literal sense but they would have a greater fulfillment in Pro prophetically so God's thoughts and his plans all of his plans and all of his thoughts are expressed throughout the Bible and we see here in the book of geneses it speaks of the position of man in the beginning and Adam un had a key it was a the the mystery of Adam uh within Adam within that first Son of God held the mystery to all sons of God that would ever be uh the original position the original uh Authority the original calling the original placing was Adam who was a God who was the god of heaven and brother random says but Adam was the god of the earth you you you believe that you know that here this morning and so the all of this the scripture speaks of this this book of Genesis we know it's it's a book of seeds brother bam called it that he said it's was a book of Beginnings in the beginning it starts but that would be a type that it was uh it was the beginning it was the alpha it was the original it was the book of Origins are you here and so what happened in the beginning what do you have you have Adam you have Eve you have an an Eden a presence an atmosphere a kingdom you have a husband you have a wife you have unity and and you have a you have an an atmosphere in Eden that's perfect and so what happens in the beginning of seeds the or the the book of Origins holds the answer to the mystery of the Bride of Jesus Christ because the Bible connects the first Adam to the second Adam and we know if there was a first and a second Adam who was Christ then there's got to be a first Eve and then a second Eve and the scripture identifies this bride throughout all of its stories and all of its themes and all of its Parables and all of the all of the major types you could find running in the Bible You'll Always Find this theme of God a husband and a bride a wife we're speaking on bride character this morning so the first one woman was made the Bible says uh the second Adam uh or the first woman was made for this first Adam now I want you to to to read this here in 1 Corinthians 11 don't try to turn because I'm going to go through these too quickly Brothers you're welcome to take it down and put it up 1 Corinthians chapter 11 uh verse 8 I'll try to not be such a machine gun this morning with these give you a minute to get them amen and so it says here in 1 Corinthians 11:8 notice for the man is not of the woman now I want you to you could think literally of a husband and wife you could think of a man and a woman but I want you to to think bigger than that here this morning for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man neither was the Man created for the woman but the woman for the man now she was brother bam says she wasn't made from outside material he says when he when he forms Adam he takes from the dust of the earth and he and he gets a lump of clay and he begins to to form the first man and the great Potter the great architect the great designer uh begins to create this man who the Bible says he created all the animals but none of the animals did he form in his own image but it was man who he created and formed in his own reflection his own image of of himself the Bible says that he begins to form this piece of clay and then he breathes into Adam the breath of life into his nostrils and then the scripture says it this way and Man became a living Soul now brother bham says now when he was going to take a he says when he made man he was showing him his position that he came from the Earth Earth was his mother you could say it that way you say how is that possible because don't think of Mother Nature that's not what we're speaking about this morning but but Earth brother bam says was part of the Eternal attribute of God and he even goes on to in the church age book say that in the that in the Book of Life and he says your name was there my name was there he says the Earth was there because it was part of the original creation do you follow me this morning so the Earth can no be more be lost than you can be lost the Earth can no more be annihilated and destroyed no more than you can be annihilated or destroyed you say how because I came from God I'll go back to God in my identity of my origin It reveals my destiny and brother bam says you you he says You Came From God you you he says you so so you go back to God and he says the Earth though it goes into a a fallen condition but brother bandam says what is that Eternal fire going to be uh when when when the Bible says that all the elements shall melt with fervent heat preach about global warming that's global warming right there the the element shall melt with fervent Heat and the scripture says that all Earth is groaning it's travailing within itself waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God even that groaning is the Greek word stenio which means it's like a mother giving birth a woman giving birth to a child and it says the Earth is groaning why is she groaning because of brother M says because of what man has done to her he's polluted her he's defiled her he's he's he's he's destroyed the Earth and man is destroying the Earth today man is continually sin is dominating this this culture sin is dominating the Earth and it's destroying the Earth the whole atmosphere becomes polluted God doesn't have to destroy man man will destroy himself are you here today and so the Earth is groaning the scripture says all creation granth and travaileth there's that word like a woman waiting to waiting in expectation to be delivered of brother ROM says of who of sinful Mankind and she's groaning for the manifestation of men like Adam the manifestation of the seeds of God the sons of God oh man I'm never going to get to my sermon brother Bon says you didn't become a son by the rebirth by by being born again he says you didn't become a son by being born again you were a son and so therefore you were born again hallelujah oh it goes so contrary to the way we think of it brother random says he says only he says that he says only the elected can be born again he says because in non-elect there's nothing that doesn't mean they can't be saved it doesn't mean that that that there's no salvation the Bible says in John 3:16 for God so loved the world the cosmos the whole earth that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever shall believeth in him but there's a difference between salvation that comes from the King to humanity and Redemption that comes only to his elected wife and let me just stop here and say this this is going to cut to the Chase brother brandham did not create that Doctrine it's right here the elected family of God was always in the mind of God can you say Amen this morning the elected family was always in the mind of God he says you didn't come he says he says you didn't you you he says only elected can reborn can be reborn and he says you weren't elected because you were born again you were born again because of your election and so the Earth was a part of God all creation granth and travelleth and and and Paul says and then he says and then we also within ourselves grown are you a Believer here this morning we groan within ourselves say brother Matt what are we groaning over sinful Mankind and we can't wait to be rid of this sinful mankind to express who we really are Hallelujah and so in the beginning God makes Adam and any forms of him from the dust of the earth shows him his position now he's going to take Eve and Eve's going to be as important as Adam is her position is going to be as essential for without an eve There's No Redemption for without an Eve there's no fall there's no way for Adam to have fallen for without Eve there's no mystery of creation or Redemption but through the manifestation through what had through so brother B says what does God do he says he didn't go over now listen to me close he says he didn't go over and pick up another piece of clay and make her from the dirt he said because she wasn't going to be the dirt he said if she was made from the dirt she'd be a doormat to be walked on and he says but she wasn't he says but God went over into the heart the rib and brother bam stops I love this and he says the rib right underneath the heart and you know why brother bam says that he says because that showed her position that she was right from under the heart of Adam Glory the Bible says that he takes from Adam and so God takes from man and the Bible says that that she's he says that now the the scripture says he takes from man let me just find my place here and so he doesn't take another piece of clay doesn't take another piece of dust but he takes from the existing material he takes from the existing creation oh my brother my sister you didn't come from some other part of the earth you came from the back part of God's mind it you're part of God from the beginning and so God takes for man to make the woman and then Adam her husband the groom the the king not the Queen the king here is going to identify who she is and he says you are now bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh therefore who where was the identity the identity for Eve was found in Adam you are now bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh and here comes the the woman now here's man and then God created as brother Donnie Reagan loves to say the wo man and he says and and then brother bam says that God as the marriage officer there was there here's here comes the separation God separates the bone separates the rib pulls out of Adam his feminist side now she was Adam in female form she's she's not called Eve remember this her name isn't Eve right here you say there's Eve no no no no no she was called Eve when she became the mother of all creation but here she's Adam in female or we could say bride form the same from the same material and her identity is in Adam but now she's Adam in Bride form and so there was this great as we said this great separation God separates Eve from Adam and then God brings them back together in holy matrimony in marriage the first family was in Eden the first marriage was in Eden and and and every family follows the pattern of Adam and Eve this brother Harold Becket loves to say it wasn't Adam and Steve I should get a hearty amen it wasn't Eve Evelyn it was Adam and Eve one man and one woman can you say Amen you're now bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh and so God removes a part of Adam and he forms a woman and then he brought Eve he brings that part of Adam back to himself and introduces her back to Adam for she was Adam in female form this is the book of the Generations this is Genesis 5 this is the book of the generations of Adam in the day that God created man in the likeness of God made he him male and female created he them blessed them and called their name Adam Genesis 5 he called their name Adam in the day they were created now the Bible know we know that Adam has dominion over all of of Eden he has Authority as on the earth as a Son of God he's positionally placed he knows who he is he has Authority and dominion and and but the scripture says but he's lonely and so you know what God's doing in Adam I hope you catch this it's just like Hosea what is brother bandom what what does the bible teach us about Hosea God takes a prophet named Hosea and he gives him a wife and that wife becomes Unfaithful now listen what is God doing God is putting his Prophet through what he himself is going through you as we said all they all have par parabolic lives they all have a compound meaning why does Jeremiah go for years as a single man God says because Jeremiah you're going to feel what I feel I feel like a single man where is my wife and and he begins to you go through all of the prophets of God the life that they live was typing so what is now the first couple going through EX exactly what God is trying to express Adam God was lonely so Adam was lonely God wanted a help meat so God created Adam Adam needed a help meat can you say Amen this morning and so God makes him male and female created them and the Bible says and the Lord God said Genesis 2:18 it is not good that the man should be alone notice he's talking about himself I will make him a help me for him the woman was not lonely hello loneliness was in the man the woman was not longing but the man was longing oh the song says I didn't I didn't I didn't I didn't look for him he looked for me I wasn't searching but he was searching and he found me when I was going the wrong way he was wooing to me he was calling to me he needed me glory and the Bible says the man was lonely he was alone so she she was made the Bible says she was man woman was made for the man so God doesn't take another piece of clay or dust to make his first Adam a bride he takes from Adam he puts him under anesthesia brother Brandon says the first surgeon the first surgery to take place here's great Papa God the great physician the great surgeon and he puts him in a deep sleep and he takes a part of Adam and he begins to form a bride everything that Eve had came from Adam everything Eve had came from Adam everything Eve had came from Adam this was her identity this was who she was this was how she was fulfilled and and the Bible says that that she was an extension of him her blood was from him her flesh was from him her spirit was from him God the first surgeon prod uh uh takes the first operation to provide for his son Adam a bride Lord God caused the Deep Sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof Genesis 2:21 and so this shows us that the bride was taken or the bride was part of the bridegroom her identification was in him and now that after he removes this part of Adam he closes up the flesh God then takes the role of the marriage officer and he introduces this woman his bride his wife to Adam and introducing Adam back to him in Bride form the form was different but it was still Adam we'll read it again and Adam said this is now bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh and she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man and so he gives the reason why he's calling her woman because she was taken out of the man and listen to me brother and sister the Bride of Jesus Christ will be of him she'll be called by his name she'll be part of him she'll keep his word because it's her word she wants his thoughts because it's her thoughts she wants his righteousness not her own she wants his life not her life and that's why there's a desire inside of you to say make me more like Jesus I want to be more like him because you came from him that's your identity as John 15 I think it's verse 16 says you Jesus says you have not chosen me but I chose you the woman didn't choose man but God brought her to Adam and so we we know even further than that and I'm going to I'm going to just burn all my time this morning laying a foundation we know further than that we could preach to you and maybe I'll skip it here this morning just to save time but we could take that first you saywell there it is in Genesis it goes beyond Genesis it goes away the the the bride the the the groom and the bride and the marriage goes away Beyond goes into eleazer who we know the Bible uh the patriarch here's Abraham and he gets a servant eleazer and he and he's going to go find a bride for Isaac what is it it's a real Isaac it's a real Rebecca it's a real elaser but it's speaking of a greater mystery it wasn't just to identify a woman named Rebecca but in 2020 it identify another woman named Rebecca and he would send another elaser and that elaser would be a prophet to this Gentile age and he would go to search for a bride for who Isaac Christ elizar makes this long journey oh I I wish wish we had time to preach on it there's so much so much good amen in that story and we know he waits at the well and and he's he's prayed for this certain young woman that he didn't know who it was but he know that she would respond he was looking for the response he was looking for how she responded what was it it was going to be character bride character Rebecca the way she responded to eler would identify who she was the way you responded to this word identifies to the devil to God and to you who you really are you say how do I respond I don't question it I don't have to understand it I simply believe it because I'm part of it I may not be able to put it on a chalkboard and write it all out and explain everything I believe but I know I believe it and I know it's me and I know it's my identity and no devil in hell can shake a revelation that God gives to a son or daughter of God it's who you are he was looking for a certain reaction and so elzar comes to that well it came notice here the Bible says that in in in Genesis it speaks of this and it says God uh the Lord Lord God of my master Abraham I pray thee send me good speed this day show kindness and my master behold I stand Here by The Well of water Daughters of men of the City come out to draw water and let it notice the daughters of men the daughters of men but but here's one in the midst of many daughters there was one many many many me to say this many draw from the water of this well but then there's one daughter who God has his eyes upon many draw from the City come out for the draw water let it come to pass that the dams to whom I shall say let down thy picture I pray the that I may drink and she shall say drink and I will give thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou has appointed for thy servant Isaac and thereby shall I know that thou has showed kindness unto my master notice not even elaser knows who she is here's the servant she doesn't he doesn't know he can't he doesn't have God doesn't give him the discernment to look in all the midst of many and says uh you but God says Lord let it be that she doesn't just want to give me water but she wants to water my camels also and he says let it be let me find it thereby therefore I shall know that thou will showed kindness unto my master and it came to pass before he had done speaking that Rebecca came out who was born of Bethel son of milka the wife of nahor Abraham's brother with her pitcher upon her shoulder and the damsel was very very to look upon a virgin no accident neither had any man known her no accident and she went down to the well and filled her picture and came up it was no accident she was a virgin it was no accident no man had been with her listen to me brother and sister your life was no accident the course that your life took was no accident you didn't just end up here believing what you believe but by predestination God's sovereignty he operated and manipulated your entire life to come to this truth he protected you and your mind oh can you say am man this morning he was protecting Rebecca when she didn't realize he was protecting her she had no idea her life was was for this moment and her entire life is a little girl the Holy Spirit watched over her brother random says this I love this let me I hope I can find this quickly amen here this morning I don't I I got these so backwards and so let me just find uh let me find my spot I'm G to I'm going to get these wrong so you just forgive me give me just one moment uh I think this is this is here here's where he's where he's at now notice her long hair Nazar to the word now notice what the prophet says don't read ahead of me please brother bham says he says I'm going to identify and if you listen to this message he identifies the false church he identifies the Antichrist spirit and that's important to do he identifies the spirit that would be in the false church but now brother vandom says he says now notice her long hair Nar right B of the word I'll picture the bride of Christ now so I'll picture her in other words I'll describe her in other words I'll show you the bride character I don't know who she is but I'll tell you what she's going to do elizar can say I don't know who she is but here's the character she's gonna have I don't know who she is but she's gonna here's the character Lord she's not just going to want to give me water she's going to water want to water the camels also so you got to have a certain character and God was looking for a certain character and brother Brandon says now let me picture the bride he says let me picture the bride of Christ now we picture the Antichrist where she is religious everything Science Now The Humble little bride of Christ just oh this is so profound just simply believes the word huh that could not be a more profound characteristic he doesn't make it complicated who is she brother brandham I don't know but here's what I know about her she just simply believes the word whoever she is she just believes this is what separates you from the rest of the world you can believe you believe she just simply can't explain it doesn't have to be complicated whoever she is she just simply believes the word elizar who is she I don't know not sure but here's a simple characteristic you can identify her by listen to brother ROM says it's individuals oh wait I thought it was a group in Jeffersonville I thought it was headquartered here I thought it started in 1947 no no no no no no bride of Christ didn't start in 1947 didn't end in 1965 bride of Christ is in all ages goes all the way back to the book of Acts when the church was born can you say Amen can I get a hearty wholesome amen when it was born on the day of Pentecost I know people don't like that and they want to make it all about Mysteries and all about doctrines but the message was not doctrines it was not Mysteries it was not it's all of that but that's not that's not what it was the message wasn't an understanding it wasn't intellect it wasn't theology it was a person it was the groom Jesus coming to the Jesus Jesus Christ in Bride form and whoever she who is it brother Matt it's individuals it's not any certain group it's not any certain denomination it's not any certain group I know we love to be groupies people love groupies they love clicks but God doesn't like clicks they love clubs God doesn't have any clubs they love books there's no book but the Bible they love Creeds there's no Creed but Christ Hallelujah can you say Amen this morning it's individuals and then listen now here's 1965 the God of this evil age now here he's preached the opening of The Seven Seals preach the seven trumpets Feast of the seven Trump Feast of trumpets and here's here's here's you want to see a bride character you want to see the character of the Bride let me show you the character of the Bride you find it in our elaser I hope and trust there's many sitting present many listening in and I hope that myself myself brother brother brandom you you hope that you're you're speaking of who who's going to identify the bride you've preached the opening of The Seven Seals you preach the Feast of the trumpet you're preaching the God of this evil age and here's broad character no arrogance hello somebody no arrogance there's nothing cocky there's there's there's no there's no elitism if there was none in our messenger how do we have it in our message amen I'll say amen for you I'll preach for you and say Amen if it wasn't if arrogance and Cockiness and attitudes and elitism and thinking your somebody wasn't in the messenger then how do we have it in the message preach it brother Matt I hope that myself and every one of you all are part of that bride I hope many and it will all that's been no notice here it is said brother Matt then who is it is it this group is it because I did this or because no brother BR makes it very simple he says I hope many and it will all that's been ordained to that will be that it cuz it's the their nature cuz it's their nature not because their nature they are that are you following me here this morning your conduct doesn't make you elected your seed does your conduct is a result of the seed that's inside of you an orange tree doesn't have to push think about it brother says it doesn't have to it's just an orange tree that's what it is it'll produce oranges he says an apple tree doesn't have to work it doesn't have to labor it'll produce apples and brother bam says no matter how much you tell me you're a Christian he says if I don't see the fruits of a Christian I I don't need to guess I don't need to wonder you produce what you are it's your nature you're you You're Not Elected by the You're Not Elected because of your dress code your dress code is a reason the way you dress is a result of who you are can you say Amen this morning morning you love him he says he says I hope that myself every one of you are part of that bride I hope many that'll be he says all that's been ordained to that will be that CUA it's their nature the word can only recognize the word it can't recognize nothing a wheat can't be nothing but a wheat it started a wheat it'll head up a wheat and a weed can never be a wheat yet it's watered by the same anointing cuz but it ain't a wheat I think sometimes we try so hard to convince someone to be a wheat we try so hard by legalism to force someone into a mold and if you could ever Force someone into a mold they can be forced out of that mold we try to force people into into into into to force people to adhere to certain things and live a certain way look a certain way but listen to me friends I'll make it real simple as the prophet did if they are a weed they can never be a wheat no matter how much we try to make them a wheat they'll always be a weed and on the contrary if you're a wheat no matter how much the devil tries to make you a weed no matter what he puts at you no matter what he throws at you you'll always be a wheat no matter how much the Devil Comes against me I'll always believe this word no matter how many lies he tries to sell me I'll always believe the word you say why brother Matt because of your intellect no because of your conduct Oh by no means no because I'm a Believer and it's by his grace I'm a Believer he says it's the same anointing but it ain't a weat her long hair Nazarite vow shows that she's vowed to God her beautiful gown of his promised word for the age that she's living and wrapped around her I love that vindicating her with himself of Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and she's a part of the word groom true to him I say Lord let me be let my life let my testimony be this I'm true to him in every Point elzar didn't know who she was but the Bible says that she got and she had done giving him a drink and she said I'll draw water from thy camels also until they were done drinking and so here's a bride Rebecca appointed to Isaac but she had to act she had to produce she had to identify herself in such a way that elzer would know that's her brother Bram says I don't know who it is but here's what I could tell you she'll believe the word she'll just simply believe it I'm not going to complicate it she'll just believe the word as eleazer spoke to her her the Bible says about Isaac he tells her about him she's never seen him she's never heard she's never seen this Isaac but she believed every word he spoke she was willing to leave mother to leave father to leave everything to go follow a man to a place she had never been to marry a man she had never seen Hallelujah and on the way elizar tells her about Isaac and she wanted to know more tell me more tell me more of what he's like and and then when she finally sees him the Bible says she covers herself with the veil showing she's in obedience now to the bridegroom what is it it's a story The Book of marriage the book of a bride a groom and a bride goes all the way beyond that and then the Apostle Paul begins to pick this up the Bride of Jesus Christ who's it going to be it's going to be individuals not a group it'll be one here one there one here believer here believer there and it will make up a many membered bride she's made up of of individuals from all you say what part of the world all parts of the world what language all languages what color of skin all colors of skin Oh what that what what background all background what what what what kind of what kind of prestige what kind of uh poverty will what should be rich what should be poor she'll be made up of a of a bride of every nation of every language of every color of every kind but she's made up from Saints from All Nation no organization but a people from all walks of life you say how how will how will God get every single one of them by one thing Jesus says my sheep hear my voice and he says and I know them and they follow me my sheep know my voice Paul says for I'm jealous this is 2 Corinthians 11 for I'm jealous over you with a Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ in Ephesians Paul picks it up and he says husbands Ephesians 5 husbands I think this is verse 25 love your wives and all the sisters said amen even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it what's he saying brother matter is Ephesians 5 about husbands and wives yes is it about how a husband should treat a wife yes but it's more than that notice that he might sanctify it and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he may present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so all men love to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hateth his own flesh but nourisheth it cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave him father and mother shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh now you got all that husband wife now Paul says but let me go a little bit deeper this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church what is it there's a bride that will marry that will be a many membered body of all people from all walks of life a glorious Church Without spot without wrinkle that would be holy and without blemish like he is what is it tell me there will be a bride who spotless chased virgin unto Christ there will be somebody in the last age who believes the word of God there will be some somebody I don't know I I say say who is it brother Matt I don't know who it'll be I hope it's me I say by your grace God let it be me Revelations 3:20 to him that overcometh what does it mean to him in other words there will be a person I say Lord let me be that person let me be that Overcomer that your word speaks of we're going to close here give me just a few minutes are you okay this morning I told you I had a lot my my Fork is full of hay but I'm just going to I'm going to not bury you this morning I'm going to stop so Isaiah begins with the scripture we read Isaiah 4:1 Brothers if you have that you can put it up and in that day seven women shall take a hold of one man saying now notice what they say seven women now we know this is not an accident that the numerology brother bam says God's all in mathematics he's all in numerology you can see it all the way throughout the Bible and speaks of seven seven Church ages speaks of seven Messengers speaks of seven eyes seven lamps seven vials seven trumpets Seven Seals Seven Ages but now we have this seven women a characteristic and there was seven false Brides of every age there was a false bride of Ephesus but there was a true bride there was a false bride of Samia there was a true bride brother vom says and that true bride believed the messenger for their day they didn't denominate around his teachings but they went on with Christ so he says there's seven women Seven Ages now we know that every age would have a spirit you say brother mat you you know sometimes when you read the church age when you read the book of Revelations you read the church age book we can we can if you're not careful you will you will cut and paste you will you will block out everything that's written about the Church of Ephesus that it was just for Ephesus and the warning was just for Ephesus and then you read Philadelphia and you say that was Philadelphia there was the warning for Philadelphia there was the church then you read lady AA you say here's the warning but brother vam says the spirit speaks in all ages in other words there would be a portion the white horse rider the black horse rider the red horse rider then you had a pale horse rider who's riding in this age and brother M says who was that pale horse rider why was he pale because he was a conglomerate of all of the horses so all of the spirits from every age would come up into a Unity to where in this age it would be Satan's Eden and he would be called by the Apostle Paul the God of this evil age can you say amen and so every Spirit there would be a portion a measure that would apply to every age and so he says there's seven women notice let's read it one more time shall take a hold of one man who's that one man Christ saying we will eat our own bread notice what they're saying we will wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name so they want the name but they don't want his word because his word is the bread and his word is further than bread it's also the apparel what is the bride clothed in the apparel of the word brother bam says that Vindicated word she wraps herself in that Garment of the Vindicated word what is that word Jesus Christ is the same yesterday he's the same today he's the same forever and so he says only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach and and so we know here that that the scripture knows we know what the Bible speaks about reproach it's sin sin is a reproach and so only take away our sin so this seven these seven women particularly it would be called that scripture makes it very clear this is what the Bible is very uh clear of that that this is Christ in all ages and that within all ages there would be Christ and with in all ages there would have to be an antichrist if there was a spirit of God a spirit of Christ there would be a spirit of the Antichrist right this is Elementary to a Believer and brother vam says that that that that Bride of the last day she'll be able to discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit he says she'll recognize the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and so we know here that the scripture says he says in verse one we will eat our own bread we will wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach so here's seven women approaching one man and here's their testimony you don't have to provide we don't need your provision we don't need you to provide for us we don't we don't we don't need food are you here we don't need food we'll take care of that part we got our own bread we don't need your bread don't need your food don't need your provision you don't have to bride in fact further than that we don't need no bread we don't need no clothes because we have our own clothes now isn't it amazing that the Church of the last day the lady aan Church age the Bible says they would say we're rich we're increased with Goods we have need of nothing and knowest thou not that thou are wretched miserable poor blind and naked we don't need your food we don't need your clothes we have our own robes you don't have to be notice you don't even have to be very spiritual to catch the significance of Isaiah 4:1 what is it take away our reproach take away our sin take away our our reproach Proverbs uh 14:34 it says a sin is a reproach to any people the reproach of what guilt take away our guilt take away our reproach take away our judgment take away the sentence we don't need your clothes we don't need your word we want to be the bride of Christ but we want our own way we want your name we want to be the bride of Christ but we want it on our terms are you here today we want it on our terms we don't we want we want it on our arrangement and so the number seven we know is significant it speaks of completion brother brandom said and it was all of this the Bible says it was a bride in every age seven women to take attempt to take a hold of one man Christ to get relief from what guilt condemnation destruction persecution plague there are certain people in the world today that want nothing more than to treat God like a vending machine just give me give me give me a little bit of Grace that's what I need today give me a little bit of Mercy that's what I need today give me a little Joy give me a little love they don't want Christ they want the benefits of being married but they don't want to be married they want the benefits of betro they want the benefits of what his name brings but they don't want him it's brother Bron said it that way says but he says he's got to be more than savior he's got to be Lord and savior people want savior because that's why Jesus is so popular I'm going to just stop here and preach for a moment that's why Jesus is so popular isn't it amazing I know I've said this here many many many times but I want to say it again it's amazing to me how popular Jesus is today yet how unpopular he was when he was preaching on the shores of Galilee how unpopular so unpopular that he got crucified so unpopular the Apostle Paul would have to say I'm not ashamed the rest of the world may be ashamed to to to of of Christ but Paul would say I'm not ashamed of the Gospel why would he say that unless it was a shame it's amazing to me how popular though now we live in 2020 and now Jesus is just accepted man I mean he's just worldwide famous famous churches fill up masses thousands parades part parties oh every politician oh I love I got I you know what do they love to say I'm a man of Faith what does that mean I'm a man of Faith because that that doesn't mean a person's a Christian he could be of any faith he's a woman of Faith she's a woman of Faith you know the man of Faith here it's became so generic I'm a Christian did you know that those that that that that the Believers of the first church didn't call themselves Christians hello somebody come on Bible students First Church didn't call themselves Christians didn't the Bible says it this way they were first called Christians at Antioch in other words they didn't call themselves Christians the world called them Christians you see the difference they were labeled Christians because they were Christlike and when you're Christlike you'll be called a Christian you don't have to tell anybody I'm a Christian they'll say he's a Christian but he's so popular today people want him by their masses but here's what it is they want their own food what is it it's bride characteristics a bride the character of the Bride is to say give me your Mana give me your clothes I don't have any of my own give me your bread I can't produce any on my own what is it his bride character notice uh Peter begins to speak of this it's a it's an attempt to take hold of one man to get relief from guilt condemnation but they don't want intimacy they don't want you know what they you know what the world wants today they want one really famous word forgiveness they want forgiveness I want forgiveness too but the world Majors on just forgive me just forgive me just give me forgiveness what is it it's the same as saying give us your name to take away our reproach it's the same we don't we we want we don't want the reproach we want our sin we don't want the consequence of sin you say brother mat you believe in justification absolutely by faith absolutely there is no faith there is no other way faith in Christ alone in him alone only are we saved we're justified by a finished work on Calvary that's that's why we can live without guilt and fear and condemnation that's the meaning of the Gospel that we believe but if that's all you ever know is justification you'll never live a life of sanctification and you'll never have the Holy Ghost it's by faith alone that we're saved but that Faith produces a life can you say Amen this morning that Faith produces a life and but what we have today is a is a is an entire world the Bible says they want to be called give us give us we don't need your bread we don't need your clothes just give us only thy name that we may take away our appro our our reproach and that's what you see produced today we've rep we've replaced convicting preaching preaching the word of God that that that that that brings conviction they' rep they've replaced that with with coffee houses in the church and 10-minute skits and funny sermons and politicians can you say Amen there's no conviction because there's no
