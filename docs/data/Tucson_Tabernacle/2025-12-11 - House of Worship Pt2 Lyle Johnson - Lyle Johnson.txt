Alas, and did [music] my Savior bleed and did my [singing] sovereign die? could [music and singing] heal that sacred head for such a worm as I at the cross. At the cross where [music] I first saw the light and the burden [singing] of [music] my heart rolled away. It [music and singing] was there by faith. I received my side. And while I [music] am happy all the day, was [singing] it for crimes that I have done? He groaned upon the tree. Amazing [singing] pity grace unknown at [music] the beyond grace. At the cross at [music] the cross where I first [singing] saw the light and the burden of my [music] heart was rolled away. It [music and singing] was there, but I receive my sight. [singing] And now I am wrapped all the way. Well, might the sun in darkness hide and shut his glory [music] sing. When Christ the mighty maker for man the preacher say at the cross at the cross where I first saw and the [music] burden of my heart was [singing] rolled away. It was there my faith.

You may be seated. So, Amen. That's good to know that he cares for us and that he loves us. I was talking with brother Lyle just a little bit before service here or just thinking about the goodness of God the questions that that Adam and Eve had to have after they were cast out and be into question and begin to wonder. But God had already made a way. God was already doing that to restore back the fellowship. And because of that, we love him. And the greatest expression of our love to him is how we treat one another and how we show our love for one another. I love Jesus, but I can't say I'm my neighbor. That's a contrary statement. You know, I love the Lord because he first loved me, and I can love you, too. Amen. So, I've anchored in Jesus the storms of life brave. Let's start with the first verse. Upon life's boundless [music] ocean where mighty billows roll, I fix my hope in Jesus. Blessed anchor of my soul. When trials fear assail me as storms are gathering on, I rest upon [music and singing] his mercy and trust him. I've anchored in Jesus. The storms of life I pray. [singing] I've anchored in Jesus. I fear no wind or wave. I've anchored in Jesus [music] for he had power to save. I've anchored in the rock of keeps my soul from evil and gives me blessing. His voice has stealed [music] the waters [singing] and bid their tum sea. my pilot [music] and deliverer to him. I hope all confine there always when [singing and music] I need him. He's at my side. Oh, I've anchored in Jesus. The storms of life fall. I've anchored [singing] in Jesus. I fear no wind or wave. I've anchored in Jesus. For he had [music] the power to say, I've anchored in the rock of aes. He is my friend [music] and savior. In him my [singing] anchor can. He drives [music] away my sorrows and shields me from the land. By faith [music] I'm looking upward [singing] beyond life's trouble seeing. There I [music] behold a haven prepared for me. I've anchored in Jesus. The storms of [music] life all brave. I've anchored in Jesus. I fear no wind or wave. [music] I've anchored in Jesus for he [music] had power to save. I've anchored in the [music and singing] rock of aes. I've anchored in Jesus. The storms of life are brave. I've hankered in Jesus. I'll fear no wind or wave. I've anchored in Jesus for he had power to say I've anchored in the rock of aes. That's the only anchor that holds. Amen. Amen. It's the only one that holds. I've anchored my soul in the haven of rest. those last words, the haven of rest where we can rest. I've anchored it there. I'm not afraid of it. And the waves come. Uh sometimes I'll I'll turn YouTube on and I'll watch um I guess cuz I'm a guy still uh boats being flipped in the water and and all those kind of neat things. But you know, I I also look at the other ones that make it through the storm. And you know, he said, "I'll be with you even and you'll never leave me." My soul in [singing] sad exile was out on sea. all burdened with sin [singing] and distress. [music] Till I [singing and music] heard a sweet voice say, make me your choice. And [music] I entered [singing] the haven of breath. I've anored my soul in the haven of the west. I'll sail the [singing] wide seas [music] no more. Oh, the [music and singing] tempest may see for the wild, but in Jesus I'm safe. Oh, I yielded [singing and music] myself to his tender embrace and faith [music] taking [singing] hold of the word. My feathers fell off and [music] I anchored my soul. Oh, [music] the haven of rest is [music] the Lord. I've anchored [music and singing] my soul in the haven. I'll s Oh, the tempers [music] may for the wild for me. Oh Jesus, I'm safe [music and singing] for ever home. Oh, [music and singing] the song of my soul since the Lord made me whole has been the [music] old story. [singing] So blessed of [singing and music] Jesus who save will have a [music] home in the haven of grave. I've anchored [music] my soul in the haven of grace. I'll sail [music] the white seas no more. Oh, the tempest [singing] may sweet or the wild. And Jesus, [music] I'm safe and we're one more time in the chorus. Sister anored [singing] my soul in the haven of west. I'll sail the wide seas. [music] The tempest may see all the wild [music] Jesus. Y'all can sing this with me. Dear Lord, I'll be a witness. I know that I'm not worthy of you. My eyes of faith I see thee upon the cross of dear Lord I cry let me thy serve Jesus [music] Surely there's a work that I can do and it's Lord help me to crumble. For the cost, I'll stand for you, [singing] dear Jesus. [music] I'll spread this [singing and music] to the world. But if it be threw into Jesus [music] Surely [music] there's a to come. Great. He's the family. He's the best of He's the sharing. He's all to me. But best of all, he is my Oh Lord, please don't Even though it's [music] help for thee. The last words to the chorus, though the cost be great, he paid the greatest cost for us to be able to to serve him to love him. If we'll stand as brother L makes ready to this evening and continue with the the the message there teaching of the temple and just got a chance. I know that those of you who have ministered the study processes, do I include this? Do I not include this? I should have added this. Maybe I shouldn't have put that in. It's a constant. Which one? If we'll pray and ask the Lord, minister to us, God will give us give it to us. That's really the key to that. I claim the blood Jesus shed. You know, the the reason for the temple was really so that they could come to a place where they could have fellowship with God again. And God had to make a way to the shed blood. Let's start with the first verse. I have a soul of strength when I have a source of strength [music and singing] when I am weak. [music] and chase me. When life is [music] pressing, I have the sun of [music] power from above. [music] I'm [singing] covered over by a [singing and music] shield of blood. I claim the blood [music] Jesus shed on Calary. Preious blood [singing] stain were made there just [singing] for [music] me. For [singing] all my sins, my sickness and my pain. When I need him, I [music] claim [singing] those preious blood. I love how others [singing] take [music] Caling to yourself with peace at home. [music] his redeemed [singing] candle. [music] I claim the blood Jesus shed. Those preious blood were made there just for me. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; my sickness and my pain. When I [music] need healing, [singing] I claim those [music] preious blood stains. I [music] claim the blood Jesus shed [singing] on [music] Calary. Those [music] preious blood stains were made [singing] there [music] just for me. for all my sins, my sickness, and my pain. When I need healing, I claim those preious blood stains. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you so much. Good evening. Tonight we'll continue exploring the tabernacle in the wilderness. Last time we observed the tabernacle and its courtyard from the perspective of a person approaching the tabernacle complex for the first time. What did he or she see? What questions formed in the mind of the observer? What answers might there be? What what was symbolic about those things observed? Let's continue in the same way for part two of our encounter with the tabernacle in the wilderness. Before we begin exploring this evening, let's join our hearts together one more time in prayer. Lord Jesus, it's such an honor to be gathered here with those that have claimed those precious blood stains. Lord, that you have taken away our sin. You've given us healing. You've given us strength. You've Lord given us a part of yourself, Lord, that we can unite with one another, Lord. We pray, I pray this evening, Lord, that you would grant forgiveness. And Lord, that you'd grant unity. And Lord, that you'd guard my lips. And if I misstate something, that you guard the ears of anyone that might hear this tonight or stream it at some other time. Because Lord, we do all of this to glorify you, to look into your word, to find you, to find those things that you've told us and showed us. We love you, Lord Jesus, and we thank you. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. We ended last time just inside the courtyard. We noted the main item in the courtyard, apart from the tabernacle itself, was the altar of sacrifice. It was centered on and located a reasonable distance back from the gate. It was where the worshipper would bring his or her sacrifice. The priest would then kill it in accordance with the rules for that particular class of sacrifice. The Lord gave Moses detailed instructions regarding the design and fabrication of this altar. Let's eavesdrop as God describes it to Moses in Exodus chapter 27. And thou shalt make an altar of shitwood. That's that's acacia. In case you don't remember from last time, this is acacia. Even if you do remember from last time, it's still acacia. It's five cubits long, five cubits broad. The altar shall be four square. That's not the name of a church. It's describing the shape. And the height thereof shall be three cubits. A cubit's about 18 inches or a foot and a half. So there's two cubits in a yard. So this that you think of as being a yard stick, it's a cubic cubit stick and it's two cubits. If I break it in half, it'll be one, but Heather might not be happy if I break it in half. So I I won't do that. Thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners thereof. His horns shall be the same, that is of acacia wood. And thou shalt overlay it, the the altar, including the horns, with brass. Actually, it it's copper. I'll explain this shortly. And thou shalt make his, that is the altars, pans, to receive his ashes, and his shovels and his basins, sprinkling bowls, and his flesh hooks, like meat forks, and his fire pans. What's a fire pan? They didn't have matches or lighters in those days. So, they'd have an implement that they could put a small amount of fire or coals on and take it someplace to light something else. All the vessels thereof, thou shalt make of brass. And thou shalt make for it a great of network of brass. And upon the net thou shalt make four brazen rings in the four corners thereof. And thou shalt put it under the the compass. That means under the border or or the rim beneath that the net may be even to the midst of reach halfway up into the altar. Thou shalt make staves carrying poles for the altar. staves of acacia wood and overlay them with brass. And the stave shall be put into the rings of the great, and the stave shall be upon two sides of the altar to bear it to enable carrying it. Hollow with boards shalt thou make it. As was showed thee in the mount, so shall they make it. In Exodus 38, there's the account of the construction of it, which is the same items and in the same order. Okay, you can be seated now. Thank you. If I were to hand you a pencil and a sheet of paper and asked you to make a crude sketch of the altar, what would it look like? How would you draw it? Make a top view and a and a side view and an end view. And be sure to include a drawing of this brass grate. Do you think the one that you draw will be a close match to the one drawn by somebody nearby? The altar is to be hollow. Does that mean it's like an empty box and fire will be on top of it or like an open top box with a sealed bottom or just four sides and no top or bottom or or something else entirely? If you Ponder for a moment. You realize you don't know if the altar sits flat on the ground and therefore needs some sort of a cutaway along the bottom edges for air to get to the fire, the altar to act as a chimney, a way to get the ashes out? If it does, does it need a gap on all four sides or just one side? How large should the gap be so that wood can be added and ashes removed? How is the the great of network of brass with four rings constructed? Is it suspended within the altar halfway up or formed to set on the ground and be shaped a bit like a a modern basket you'd use to deep fry foods but turned upside down? And if so, what are the rings for? [snorts] Or is it suspended from the top with the rings going over these mysterious horns of the altar? And what are these horns all about? Are they intended to suspend the brass crate? And in that case, how do you transport the altar since no other rings are mentioned? Are these details important? Or does the person making the altar have the the the freedom to interpret the words on a best effort basis? As I think you can see, while there's a lot of information given in the words of the text, there are many details that are lacking. Verse eight settles these issues. As it was shown thee in the mount, so shall they make it. In other words, Moses would be supervising, explaining, and generally ensuring that the design matched exactly what the Lord showed him. Unfortunately, no one made drawings that survived the millennia. So, we don't know any more about what it actually looked like than what the text says. That that drawing is not showing. Use your imagination. Here's one concept drawing. The ultra walls are one thickness of acacia wood boards covered on both sides with brass. The grate sits on the ground and is formed upward. Uh but it would need to sit on something to allow air to get in. Uh not too sure. Let's go to one we can see. [snorts] Here's another concept drawing here. The word hollow is taken to mean that the sides are hollow. So this sketch shows the altar has hollow walls several inches thick. Uh the grate sits on the ground and is formed upwards and loops around the base of the altar to then form the carrying rings for the poles. The brass network is shaped to allow air in for the fire, but would still be hard to load wood and remove ashes. Here's a concept drawing from Orthodox religious Jewish texts. The the altar includes a pedestal five cubits tall. The altar top surface is now nine cubits high with a one cubit high square horns that are also cubes. The hollow walls are one cubit thick. The wood pile for sacrifice is in a one cubit square space on top of the altar. The top surface forms a place for the priests to walk. And here's more of that one. Um, this shows the altar with its rings and rods and an illustrator fire burning on top. It's a pretty heavy structure. An earthn ramp some 30 cubits, 45 ft long, allows the priest to reach the top of the altar to sacrifice. I doubt any of your imagined drawings uh look like this concept. The convoluted reasoning behind these startling dimensions is interesting. We we won't go into it. This is a view of the model built at Timna. As mentioned last week, it's another concept with the altar sitting on four small rock piles. This allows making it level if the tabernacle is erected on ground that's not perfectly smooth. And it also in this case shows it's spaced high enough to add wood to and remove ashes from the fire. The sides almost look like bricks or blocks, but they're copper plates averaging about 8 in high and 12 in wide. You're probably thinking, "Wait a minute, Brother Lyle. The Bible clearly says brass or bronze and you're saying copper. Please explain. The tabernacle was fabricated at Mount Horeb by people who had lived in Egypt for many generations. The Egyptians made tools and weapons and so forth of copper which they could mine. Brass or bronze is an alloy of copper and zinc, which means you need a ready source of zinc. Egypt didn't have zinc. So, the people Moses was bringing from Egypt could not have been carrying brass or bronze. There wasn't any to bring, but they could be bringing copper. In fact, many of them had likely worked in the Egyptian copper mines located in the Sinai. The biblical Hebrew word used is variously translated copper, brass or bronze. The key here is translated. We're reading an English translation from some 400 years ago of this Hebrew word from some 3,400 years ago. Jewish sources say the metal used was copper and the altar you see here is therefore covered in copper rather than alloy to create brass or bronze. I may use the word brass or copper in this lesson, but the meaning in Moses time was copper, but if you're more comfortable with brass, when I say copper, think brass. Otherwise, when I say brass, think copper. Okay, let's see if we can go a little further. Uh, two of the tools mentioned for the altar are leaning against its side, a shovel and a meat fork. The staves go through rings, and if you look really closely, you'll see copper rods that form the rings to go to the bottom of the altar. They then wrap around the bottom edges near the corners and attach to the grate. Here's a view of that particular grate. There's a small amount of firewood centered beneath it. The walls of the altar are hollow with an internal spacing of maybe four inches. If you think about it, this is a copper clad, brassclad wooden structure. The fire has to be away from the edges or the wood will turn to charcoal inside the copper make meaning the altar would have to be continuously rebuilt if a large fire were regularly burning in it. Would a wooden core altar like this actually work? Would it survive for very long with a fire in the middle of it? How many of us here have a wooden barbecue grill? I didn't think so. It's not as crazy as you might first think or as I first thought. Think about a campfire. You have a place where you're burning wood, usually with some rocks around it, and you've got some additional wood to toss into the campfire. What is the safe distance for the wood pile from the fire? I mean, the safest near distance, ignoring sparks and so forth. The wood can be pretty warm without it being in danger of igniting. 3 feet or so is probably going to work. This is the edge of the fire. Your wood pipe, I've had campfires about that close and the forest didn't catch on fire. the wood can get pretty warm. So looking at it this way, a metalclad wooden chimney is practical. And in essence, that's what the altar is, a metalclad wooden chimney with a grate for holding the food being cooked, or in this case, the animal remains being burned. The nearest part of the altar would be about three feet from the edge of a reasonable fire in the center. The corners would be nearly five feet away with copper sheeting drawing the heat from the nearer harder areas towards the corners and acting as a chimney. Outside air would be drawn up inside the altar bringing oxygen for the fire and cooling air flowing up the sides reducing the temperature of the overall structure. Thus, the wooden core of the altar would survive the heat. And that's likely the reason it's so large. Large because it would burn if too close to the heat of the fire, yet small enough that its weight could be carried by four or maybe eight people. This view gives you an idea of how large this altar was. This is a group of tourists at the Timna Tabernacle site. The altar is pretty big. Um Ava, if I could uh have you come up here and help me with something. And I I'm going to need uh three more people to volunteer. Brother, Dan, and sister, I see that you've got some of your kids here. You think we could get three of them to come up and help me? I'm not going to embarrass you. The the requirements are simply that you're strong enough to hold a piece of this and that you can reach about this high. One, two, three. Okay, fourth one is coming. If I didn't get this tangled up too much, if you'd be so kind as just as to hold that, we'll consider that as a as as something for you to hold. Um, let's see if I can get this untangled. If you can take that one and and and you can take that one. Okay. In this case, I'm not the priest. on the clutch. If you take that one. Okay. Now, here's the trick. Need you to hold that. So, that's kind of straight. And if you could walk towards the edge, you don't go over the edge. Yeah. Okay. And if you hold it up just high enough that the bottom of that is just touching the carpet. Just just touching the carpet. Okay. So, this is five cubits by five cubits by three cubits. That's the size of the altar. And if I don't get burned, I'm about the size of the fire. I think that's far enough away. You wouldn't want it any smaller. It's going to turn to charcoal. You don't want any bigger. You can't pick it up to carry it. Thank you very much. You've been a very great help. [applause] Well, for our purposes, we'll go with this altar at Timna. This is a view a worshipper entering the courtyard might see as he brings his sacrifice. The altar, as we just saw, is five cubit square, about 7 and 1/2 ft. The columns for the horns add a bit, so call it eight feet on a side. It's 4 and 1/2 ft, three cubits high. It maybe sits a foot off the ground. So, you saw how high it was with our volunteers, and again, thank you. It would be maybe this much higher to allow room for the wood and the ashes and so forth. Now, people in ancient times weren't very tall. Goliath is an exception. If the average person was 5 to 5 and 1/2 ft tall, their eyes would not be able to see behind the altar, just like this view here. But the tabernacle was 15 feet high or so, so the worshipper could see it over the top. Again, very much like you see on the screen. But one other thing, notice the dimension of five cubits. The value five is associated with the concept of grace. Sometimes defined as unmmerited favor. You don't earn it. It was given to you or granted in spite of the fact that you didn't earn it. So here we see the grace of God in the dimensions allowing one's sins to be judged with the copper or brass speaks of and the punishment is passed to a surrogate to pay the penalty. Hence the sacrificial altar. The brass speaking of judgment, the dimensions speaking of grace. Now, inside the courtyard, look at the outer wall curtain. You see the right of the altar here. I'll help you a bit. Yeah, there we go. In this view, it's near the right edge of the image on the screen. What size are those panels, the individual hangings which form the wall of the courtyard? In Exodus 27 verse 11 we read likewise for the north side in length shall be hangings of 100 cubits long talking about the outer wall and it's 20 pillars. Ah do the math 100 divided by 20 equals five. So each panel or hanging is five cubits in length. And skipping to verse 18, the height five cubits of fine twined linen. Twin means the fibers make the cloth have been twisted or woven. So the linen panels that comprise the outer wall of the courtyard are also five cubits by five cubits. God's righteousness, the white linen says, "Keep out. If you come in, you'll die." However, God's grace and the dimension of each panel says, "Look, I've made a way for you to enter into my righteousness where we can meet." We see nothing but grace extended to us, even in the symbol of God's righteousness. One wall of separation, but composed of many panels of grace. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; And the brazen altar says, "See, it's by grace your sins can be judged and the consequences removed. Enter and let us commune." As the prophet wrote Isaiah 1 verse 18, "Come now, let us reason together, sayaeth the Lord. Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow. Though they be red like crimson, they shall be his wool. No wonder the psalmist could write in the hundth psalm, "Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, into his courts with praise. Be thankful unto him and bless his name." Among the various sacrifices and offerings, there was a continual daily sacrifice to the Lord. In Exodus 29, we read, "Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar, two lambs of the first year, day by day, continually. The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning. The other lamb thou shalt offer it even. And with the lambet one/tenth deal, about a gallon of flour mingled with a fourth part of an hen, which that fourth part's a bit over a quart of beaten oil. That would be olive oil. And the fourth part of an hint of wine, about a quart for a drink offering. And the other lamb shalt thou offer it even, and shalt do thereto according to the offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering. Why? For a sweet savor. This means a pleasant fragrance, a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire unto the Lord. This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord where I will meet you to speak there unto thee. A sweet savor. We may not think of it as pleasant, but we're told it pleased God. Why is that important? In the culture of the time, the nose was equated with anger. In fact, in biblical Hebrew, the same word off is used. From context, you know, whether it's nose, nostrils, or anger or wrath. It's the same word. Recall that when his sons butchered the men of Sheckchham, Jacob's comment was Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "Ye have troubled me to make me stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Parizzites. I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me and slay me. I shall be destroyed. I and my house. Anger and wrath are associated with a bad smell. In contrast, then peace and tranquility would be associated with a pleasant smell or odor. And the Lord wanted to associate a pleasant aroma with his people continually. Israel was commanded to always provide this pleasant odor, this sweet smelling savor day in day out, every day, including the Sabbath forever. What constituted morning and evening for these offerings? According to the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia, which was the latest version I found a complete one of online, it talks about these burnt offerings and it says the uh the standard offerings, occasional offerings, the stated offerings. Number one, the daily burnt offering presented at the time of the morning and evening prayer, the the third and ninth hours. The victim was a lamb or kid a year old and so forth. the the third and ninth hour of sacrifice roughly 9:00 am and 3 pm. So this altar also reminds us of that day that day of days that day on Calvary. We read in the gospel of Mark and they bring Jesus unto the place Goltha which is being interpreted the place of a skull and it was the third hour and they crucified him. At the very moment a lamb was being sacrificed nearby on the altar in the temple for a sweet smelling savor. A lamb that perhaps was born in the very manger where Jesus was born. One where sacrificial lambs were born and cared for. When the sixth hour was come, that would be noon, there was darkness over the whole land until the 9inth hour. And at the ninth hour, at the very moment, another lamb was being sacrificed on the altar in the temple, Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "Eloy, Aloy, Lama," which is being interpreted, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" Jesus cried with a loud voice and gave up the ghost. Lamb on the brazen altar, Jesus on the cross. We see that the altar though covered in copper was a wooden structure as was the cross. The four horns of the altar remind me of four nails on that cross. Three that secured Jesus to suffer and die. The fourth to bear testimony, holding up a sign that I combined from all four gospel accounts. The sign that said, "This is Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews." There's so much here. If we take time to stop and look, what else would we see here in this part of the courtyard? The priests. How would we recognize them? Oops. Excuse me. We have a technical difficulty. Almost there. I'm sure you've all read that, so you've refreshed yourselves. Here we go. The priests. How do we recognize them? By their uniforms. Same way we might recognize a police person or a captain or first officer of an airliner. The Lord gave Moses specifics for the priestly uniform. In fact, there were two uniforms. One designed for the regular priests and a special uniform for the high priest. In the courtyard by the altar, you probably would not see the high priest, but would see one or more of the regular priests. But let's take a look at these uniforms. Exodus 28. And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him from among the children of Israel, that he may minister unto who is a priest ministering unto the people. No. May minister unto me, the Lord in the priest's office. Even Aaron, Naab, and Abaiu, Elizar, and Itar, Aaron's sons. And like them, we serve our Lord by serving his people. Thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, for glory and for beauty. Aaron would be the first high priest. Thou shalt speak unto all that are wisehearted and and that means skilled with with good judgment whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom. God's already prepared them ahead of time for their work of service to him. I have filled with the spirit of wisdom that they may make Aaron's garments to consecrate him that he may minister unto me in the priest's office. The the uniform is important. And these are the garments which they who the wisehearted shall make. a breastplate and an ephod that's a a ritual vest and a robe and a embroidered coat. This doesn't mean embroidered with colorful thread as we think of embroidery today. It means the linen cloth was woven with a pattern texture. Many translations call it a checkered tunic suggesting the pattern not colors. a miter, often translated as a turban, and a girdle, a sash or belt. And they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office. And there follows a long description of high priest specific items. We're going to get to the regular priests. So, we skip down to verse 39. Thou shalt embroider the coat, weave the patterned tunic of fine linen, and thou shalt make the minor the turban of fine linen. Thou shalt make the girdle the sash or belt of needle work decorated. In this case, it's a work of a weaver. It it it has colors. And for Aaron's sons, thou shalt make coats, tunics shown here is woven checker work of fine linen, the same as for the high priest. And thou shalt make for them girdles, sashes, the same as for the high priest, and bonnetss, not not not a miter, but caps or hats. This is a simpler hat than the turban for the high priest. Thou shalt make for them for glory and beauty, dignity, splendor. And thou shalt put the the high priestly uniform upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons, which will wear the uniform of the regular priest with him. and shalt to anoint them and consecrate them and sanctify them that they may minister unto me in the priest's office. And thou shalt make them linen breaches to cover their nakedness. From the loins even to the thighs they shall reach. And the English Standard Version says, "You shall make for them linen undergarments to cover their naked flesh. They shall reach from the hips to the thighs, and they shall be upon Aaron and upon his sons, when they come in unto the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they come near unto the altar to minister in the holy place, that they bear not iniquity, and die. It shall be a statute forever unto him and his descendants after him. There's a serious penalty for not wearing the priestly garments whenever a priest is inside the tabernacle compound. This is a pretty comprehensive and detailed description of the uniform. Four items for the regular priest down to specifying even their undergarments. In this picture, we see a sketch of a regular priest and a mannequin dressed as a regular priest. Yeah, there's some things missing on that. Note the sash or girdle. Was it white for the regular priests or multicolored as shown here? In Exodus 39, when the garments and other items are being made, we read, "They made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron and for his sons, and a miter of fine linen, that that turban for the high priest, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, hats for the regular priests, and linen breaches of fine twined linen for both. and a girdle of fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet of needle work also for both priestly uniforms as the Lord commanded Moses. So, so they were colored. We see the sashes of linen woven with purple, blue, scarlet threads. Blue, as we mentioned last time, often signified the heavens and by extension the divine presence. Scarlet, a bright red, represented the blood of sacrifice, the penalty for sin. Purple dye was rare and expensive. It represented royalty and wealth. As we discussed last week, if you think about it, purple is a combination of red and blue. White, as we said, represents righteousness. So, back to the image of a regular priest. If I ask you what you don't see, you'd probably say, "Well, duh, Brother Ly, you don't see those undergarments." Yeah, that's true. But but what else don't you see? Shoes or sandals? The sketch and the mannequin are both barefoot. They have no shoes. Moses was not given direction to make shoes or sandals for the priest who would be spending a lot of time walking on the raw desert floor of the courtyard. This is intentional was not an oversight. The priests and the service at the tabernacle compound went barefoot performing sacrifices and other rituals. You may be thinking, why would God want the priests to be barefoot in the compound? Are you sure about this, Brother L? Maybe God didn't care what they wore on their feet, so he didn't bother to specify it. Are you sure? Well, I'm pretty sure 99.9999%. Why? Inside the compound is considered holy ground, a sanctified space. The outer wall signified righteousness and this is inside that wall. Consider this from earlier in Exodus chapter 3. Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian. And he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto Moses in a flame of fire out of the midst of the bush. And Moses looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire. And the bush was not consumed. And Moses said, "Huh, I will now turn aside, see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt." And when the Lord saw that Moses turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said, "Moses, Moses." And Moses said, "Here am I." And the Lord said, "Draw not nigh hither. Don't come any closer. Put off thy shoes from off thy feet. For the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. If Moses had to take his shoes off on what the Lord said was holy sanctified ground, it seems reasonable this would be the case wherever the Lord designated a space as holy. And Mount Orb, where Moses saw the bush, was the same place where the tabernacle compound would initially be erected. One thing we haven't talked about yet is the use of linen. Not its color, but the material itself. Why not cotton or material [snorts] from some other plant like agave? Well, let's take a look. Linen is made from the fibers of a flax plant. Flax yield seeds that are nutritious or can be crushed to extract linseed oil. But each stock contains many long, sturdy fibers that are ideal for weaving into cloth. As you see in the image, the fibers are light colored. They're also long, often three feet or more, and strong. The flax fibers are two to three times stronger than cotton fibers, for example. Linen made from flax was commonly used for priestly garments even in Samaran Egypt. But but there's more to it than that. According to the rabbis, quoting and paraphrasing a bit, the uh tabernacle outer court wall hangings were made of linen because flax from which linen is made differs from other plants in that only a single stock grows from each seed. Since the Jew is distinguished from other nations by virtue of his absolute monotheism, it's appropriate that the curtain separating the tabernacle from the surrounding world was made of this material. In addition, the flax plant alludes to our mission to spread knowledge of God's oneness to the world at large. Our sages tell us that flax depletes the land, the soil of its nutrients and land signifies the earthly materialistic consciousness that opposes the faith in one God. They go on to say, "We Jews are a people who bring awareness of God's oneness to the materialistic world." One stock proceeded, symbolizing the oneness of God. So, moving along, as we now walk around the north end of the altar, we get a better view of the east end of the tabernacle itself. There's something between the altar and the tabernacle. What is it? In this example, it looks a bit like a really large bird bath, but that's not what it is. So, what is it? Exodus 30 beginning at verse 17. The Lord spake unto Moses, saying, "Thou shalt also make a lav, a basin of brass, at his foot also of brass to wash with all, and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein. For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet there at when they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water that they die not. And when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the Lord, so shall they wash their hands and their feet, that they die not. and it should be a statute forever to them, even to him and his descendants throughout their generations. We don't know if this was the shape of it or not. This is we don't even know the size. This is the only major item inside the tabernacle compound for which no dimensions are given. All we know is that it was a copper or brass basin with a separate foot or or stand and that it is only to be used by the priests and that they must use it. Personal hygiene was something that God cared about. The Jewish nation was certainly far ahead of their time in this regard. The barefooted priests offering sacrifices were regularly exposed to blood as they killed the animals being offered. The dying creatures would expel various body wastes which ultimately had to be cleaned up. You can be sure the priests had dirty feet. Washing their hands and feet before every sacrifice helped to keep them safe in human terms, sanctified in spiritual terms. The lava was used over and over again every day by the priests as they offered sacrifices and as they had occasion to enter the tabernacle. It's likely they use some sort of cups or scoops to get the water from the lav and use the water taken with which to wash. It would be important to keep the water in the lav pure. The point isn't to get wet, but to get clean. How might this apply to us? We're We're not priests, are we? In First Peter 2, we read, "But you are a chosen generation, you, we, us, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people, that you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. Like the priests in the days of the tabernacle using the lather, we need to constantly cleanse our hearts, our minds of the impurities and dirt that we're exposed to and in which we walk and work every day. There's another unique thing about the lavver. Not only that we don't know its shape or size. It's the only object whose material source was specified. Not not just the material, brass or copper, but specifically who donated it. When the design was finished and the components of the tabernacle compound were being manufactured by the Israelites at Orb, we read in Exodus 38, "And Moses made the lavver of brass and the foot of it of brass of the looking glasses that is the hand mirrors of the women assembling which assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation." Egyptians used polished copper to create a mirror. These were used for, among other purposes, by the ladies to be sure they were looking their best. This is an ancient Egyptian mirror. It's between 800 and 100 BC. So, it doesn't quite date back to the time of the tabernacle, but I don't think the designs change significantly then. The exact age of this particular beer that's I believe in the Louvre is uncertain. The rabbitical commentary on this sourcing says that the women were assembled at the door of the entrance of the tabernacle of the congregation for the purpose of donating their mirrors. In other words, this gathering wasn't a common thing. They were there specifically to donate something that was important to them. How important? Why? Why do you say important, brother Low? Remember, they fled from Egypt. They didn't have time for the dough to rise on their bread. They had to go and go in a hurry. When they fled, they were only taking the necessities they could carry. They didn't have pickup trucks. They lived in mudbrick places in Gan. And most of them didn't have animals or carts. So, you've got to leave. You've got to leave in the morning. And you can only take your carry-on. You can't check a bag. It's only your carry-on. These mirrors made the cut. They must have been somewhere near the top of the list in importance. The rabbis say God instructed Moses to use this copper from the mirrors to melt down to cast the labor. This is the only time listing all the uses of brass or copper for the construction of the tabernacle compound that a specific source is given. We'll later see that many of the Israelite women also worked in making the tabernacle itself. I see such a parallel in the Gospels. In Luke 7, it ends, we're being told of a woman who washed Jesus' feet with her tears. We then read in Luke 8, it came to pass afterward that Jesus went throughout every city and village preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God. And the 12 were with him? The 12? Any other disciples? Who besides the 12? and certain women which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, including Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils, and Joanna, the wife of Kusa, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of of what? Their substance, their valuables. They supported him financially. In effect, they donated their mirrors. If the worship team would please return, notice just like the bronze lavver is uniquely identified as being sourced by many women of the congregation. Here we see that Jesus ministry was also supported by many women, more than 12, more than the 12 guys. And they were faithful followers to the end. Mary Magdalene, for example, was the first one to the tomb that Easter morning, the first to report his resurrection to the scoffing male disciples. Joanna was part of the next group that went and told of his resurrection. I'd like to encourage all of the sisters here know that what you do and who you are are vitally important. Nothing goes forward without you. No lyver so the priests can't minister. No witness of the resurrection and the time of Jesus. Back to the tabernacle compound. What else do we see? Oh, just beyond the lava of tabernacle itself. Oh, let's take a good look and go inside next time. As we close this portion of the service, let's stand, please, and and let's sing together a a song [music] based in part from Psalm 100, which we read earlier. I will enter his gates with thanksgiving. I will [singing] enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart. [music] I will enter his courts with praise. I will say this is the day that the Lord has made. I will [music] rejoice for he has made me glad. He [music and singing] has made me glad. He has made me glad. I will rejoice for he has made me glad. [singing] He has made me glad. He has made me glad. I will rejoice for he has made me glad. I [singing and music] will enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart. I will [singing and music] enter his courts with praise. I will [music] say this is the day that the Lord has made. I will rejoice for he has made me glad. He has made me glad. He has made me glad. I will rejoice for he has made [music] me glad. He has made me glad. He has made me glad. I will [music] rejoice for he hath made me glad. I will enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart. I [singing] will enter his courts with praise. I will say this is the day that the Lord hath made. I will rejoice for he hath made me glad. He hath made me glad. He hath made me glad. I will rejoice for he hath made me glad. He hath made me glad. He hath made [music and singing] me glad. I will rejoice for he hath made me glad. I will rejoice for he hath made me glad. &gt;&gt; He did it all. He took care of it all. He lays out a plan, a perfect plan, a drawing. And not only does it, but he gives them the inspiration, the desire to do what what he wanted done. There was not a Lord, I don't want to do it that way. God said so. And that's the same. Our hearts should be the same way. This is what the Lord has asked of us. Then that's what I want to do. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Oh, bless the Lord, [singing] oh my soul, and all [singing] that is within me. Bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, oh my [singing] soul, and all that is within me. Bless his [music] holy name. For he has done great things. He has done great things. He has done [singing] great things. Bless his holy name. He has done. Oh, he has done great things. Can you testify that? That he's done great things in your life for you. great [singing] things. He has done great things. Bless his holy. One more time. He has done great things. Oh, he has done great things. He has done great things. He has done great things. Bless his holy name. Just keep playing that. Could you imagine walking on your on your journey to do on your way to do your job? Moses was on his way taking care of the sheep and that burning bush of fire. Maybe at a glance he had seen a fire, a bush burning before, but something catches his attention because it's burning, but it's not being consumed. But you know, Moses could have said, "You know what? I've got sheep to attend to. I've got things I need to go do. So, we'll just go on and do our job." But something called him to that. He says, "I've got to go see what that is." and he met God in that place. Same with me and you. Sometimes God will get our attention, but Lord, I'm busy right now. I got things I got to do. Take a moment and see if he's not wanting to talk with you and just bless his holy name. Oh, bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all [singing] that is within me. Bless his holy name. For he has done great things. He has done great things. [singing] He has done great things. Bless his holy name. I will serve thee because I love thee. I will serve thee [singing] because I love thee. You have given life to [singing] me. And I was [singing] nothing before you found me. You have given life to me. There were heartaches, [singing] broken pieces. Ruined lies are why [singing] you die [music] on Calary. And your touch was what I long [singing] for. You have given life to. Now sing this song as a [music] pledge to him. Oh, I will serve thee because [singing] I love thee. You have given life to me. Oh, I was nothing before you found me. You have given life to me. were [singing] hardached and broken piecees. Ruined lives are [singing] why you died on Calary. And your [singing] touch was what I long [singing] for. You have given life to me. Brother Josiah, you have enough voice to come up and pray. Come on. I was glad to see him when he walked in because brother Dan had said he wasn't feeling well. Amen. Come on up. Thank you. Can we all say happy birthday to brother Aaron? [applause] I don't have much of a voice otherwise I'd sing it. But let's pray. Lord, you've been so good to us. Thank you that we have this tabernacle here today that we can gather together and worship you and read about how it was back in the day, Lord. We can only imagine what it'd be like to walk, walk into that place, Lord, and see the way you designed it. Thank you, Lord, for brother Lyall, for him sacrificing his time and his effort to present this to us tonight. I pray that you'd bless him, and I pray that you bless everyone here tonight, Lord Jesus. Pray tonight everyone would walk out those doors better Christians than when we came in. Thank you for this service, Lord. Give you our hearts tonight. Ask that you'd keep everyone safe on the drive home in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. It's He's so good to us. Sometimes we wonder why. We ask him why, Lord. And sometimes he doesn't say nothing. He just asks you to trust me. Keep walking. Keep going. There's a purpose in this. You know, uh if we got answers to everything, if we understood everything and knew everything, it it wouldn't be a walk by faith. It would just, well, I know, so I'm going to go. But you know, when I get up in the morning, I just want to say, Lord, thank you for life. guide me, direct me, and and when I make a mistake or take a wrong step, because I will, Lord, just help me to quickly get on the path and keep going the right way. Let my life be be something that someone could say, "Hey, what is it about you? What is it about you?" Just like Moses was drawn to that that pillar fire. Well, that's a pillar of fire living in you. The same one. And it draw should draw somebody say, "What is it about you? I need that. I want that. Amen. You ask me why I'm happy and I'll just tell you why as we go. My sins are gone. How many say amen to that? My sins are gone. Now I can go into and meet him. I don't have to send the high priest in there to go talk with him. He said you can come in now. You asked me [singing] why I'm happy. So I'll just tell you why. recall. My sins [music] are gone. And when I meet [singing] the [music] scoffer who asks me where they are, I say my sins are gone. There underneath the blood on the cross of Calvary. As far removed as [music] darkness is from dawn in the sea [music] of God's forgetfulness. That's good enough for me. Praise God. [singing and music] My sins are gone. was at the old time [singing] altar where God came in my heart and now my sins are gone. The Lord took full possession. [music and singing] The devil did depart. I'm glad my sins are gone. There underneath the [music] blood on the cross of Calvary as far removed as darkness is from dawn. In the sea of [music and singing] God's forgetfulness, that's good enough for me. Praise God, [singing] my sins are gone. was at the old time altar [singing] where God came in my heart and now my sins are gone. The Lord took full possession [singing] the devil did before. I'm glad my sins are gone. They're underneath [singing and music] the blood on the cross of Calvary. As far removed as darkness is from dawn [music and singing] in the sea of God's forgetfulness. That's good enough for me. Praise [music] God. [singing] My sins are gone. When Satan comes to tempt me and tries [music and singing] to make me, I say my sins are gone. You got me into trouble, but Jesus [music] got me out. I'm glad my [music] sins are gone. There underneath the blood [singing] on the cross of Calvary. As far [music] removed as darkness is from dawn [singing] in the sea of God's forgetfulness. [music and singing] That's good enough for me. Praise God. My sins are gone. I'm living [singing and music] now for Jesus. I'm happy night and day because [singing] my sins are gone. My soul is filled with music with all my heart. I say, I know my sins [music] are gone. There underneath the blood on the [music and singing] cross of Calvary. as far removed as darkness is from dawn. In the sea of God's forgetfulness, [music and singing] that's good enough for me. Praise God. My sins are gone. You can keep playing that, but God bless you. God with you. You know he will. You just make sure in the morning you talk with him. Make sure during the day you talk with him. Make sure in the evening you talk with him. He's not one of those, well, you know, I'll talk to him when I got time. There should always be time. He's willing to come. So, God bless you as you go there underneath your [music] blood on the cross of Calvary. As far [music and singing] removed as darkness is from dawn in the sea of God's [singing] forgetfulness. That's good enough [music] for me. Praise God. [singing] I'm living now for Jesus. I'm living now [singing and music] for Jesus. I'm happy night and day because my sins are gone. My soul is filled with music. With all my heart I say, I know my sins are gone. There are Heat. Heat.
