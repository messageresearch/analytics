[6:12] forgives us there's a lot of
[6:14] thankfulness and gratitude

[19:56] for brother um from brother Alex oberick
[20:00] he's asking prayer for Anita his wife
[20:03] and it's an unspoken request um so let's
[20:05] stand and take this need to the
[20:11] Lord if you have
[20:13] a prayer request lifted up to the Lord
[20:16] right
[20:17] now you sees those hands Lord

[20:59] um we're going to sing just as I am this
[21:01] song's been on my heart for quite some
[21:04] time and I thought maybe tonight would
[21:06] be a good night to sing it
[21:09] but this song was when the Lord started
[21:12] dealing with me I was 28 years
[21:15] old and
[21:19] uh this kind of became my prayer the
[21:23] whole song is uh the words to it are
[21:27] Like a Prayer or it is a prayer but um I
[21:30] looked up
[21:31] the history behind the song and um so I
[21:35] wanted to share that
[21:38] um not just read no other song written
[21:41] has had the impact of drawing Believers
[21:44] to Christ as just as I am its pleading
[21:46] Cry of surrending surrendering our all
[21:49] to the Savior and beckons us to a
[21:53] relationship with him has been sung
[21:56] across the world in churches for altar
[21:57] calls it was song it was a song used by
[22:00] Billy Graham
[22:01] Crusades at the close of
[22:04] services when attendees would come
[22:06] forward to accept the Lord
[22:08] Jesus it's written by charl Charlotte
[22:11] ell Elliott in 1834 and published in
[22:15] 1835 as a poem Charlotte Elliot was born
[22:20] in Brighton England on March 18th 1789
[22:23] her father was a silk Merchant her
[22:25] mother was daughter of a
[22:27] Preacher during her childhood she was
[22:30] afforded the better things in life and
[22:31] raised in a Christian home she had
[22:33] received the best education had a
[22:35] passion for music and art yet during her
[22:38] young
[22:39] years she could not accept the fact that
[22:41] she could come to know the father with
[22:44] all the
[22:46] sin she struggled with the fact of
[22:49] unworthiness and felt she could not come
[22:52] before a perfect and loving God with her
[22:54] imperfect life
[22:57] [Music]
[23:00] many years later after being part of a
[23:03] social scene where religion was not
[23:06] talked
[23:09] about she felt ill and found herself
[23:12] isolated and alone after suffering the
[23:14] terrible illness with bouts of
[23:16] depression and ill health she felt as if
[23:19] she had nothing to
[23:22] give an evangelist friend of her father
[23:25] Henry Caesar Milan came to visit the
[23:27] family and asked her if she knew
[23:30] Christ and offended by this question she
[23:32] replied she did not discuss the topic he
[23:36] apologized for offending her but
[23:38] explained to her that he always liked to
[23:40] speak of his master and only hoped that
[23:42] one day she would come to know him as
[23:45] her Savior and be a worker for
[23:47] Christ a few weeks after this encounter
[23:50] they met
[23:51] again and Charlotte explained that ever
[23:54] since he had posed the question she had
[23:57] not been able to get it off off of her
[23:59] mind she explained she did not know how
[24:02] to come to
[24:03] Christ and he explained Come Just As You
[24:06] Are Believing on Jesus as your personal
[24:08] savior it is said she went away
[24:11] rejoicing in the fact that she now
[24:12] understood what it was to be accepted
[24:16] and loved by the Lord Jesus
[24:19] Christ 12 years later she continued to
[24:22] suffer bouts of depression it was during
[24:24] this time that her
[24:27] brother was was working at a respectable
[24:30] School in England and was giving the
[24:32] daughters of a
[24:34] clergyman at a respectable School in
[24:37] England to give Daughters of clergymen a
[24:40] higher education it was decided a
[24:42] bizarre would be held to raise money for
[24:44] the school it seemed everyone was
[24:48] involved in planning and working the
[24:50] event except
[24:54] Mary who still at times battled with her
[24:56] salvation in her mind it was the night
[24:58] before the B bizarre Mary wrestled with
[25:02] these nagging thoughts the next morning
[25:05] the same thoughts
[25:07] returned with more intensity and it was
[25:09] then that Mary got out her pen and
[25:12] decided once and for all she would
[25:13] conquer those thoughts with the facts of
[25:15] her
[25:16] salvation not her emotions on it but the
[25:20] facts of the Lord's love his Mercy his
[25:25] power it was then and there not in the
[25:28] the past
[25:29] tense or in a one-time passing moment
[25:32] but in the even now moment that she was
[25:36] accepted in the Lord
[25:38] Jesus it was in this experience that she
[25:42] pinned the words just as I
[25:44] am and as I said this song was
[25:46] instrumental when the Lord started
[25:48] dealing with me and it was the first
[25:50] song I ever played on the
[25:54] guitar in my room alone
[25:59] [Music]
[26:01] and it was my prayer to him just as I
[26:05] am I don't have any other
[26:08] plea but that your blood was shed for
[26:12] me and that you've bid me come to thee
[26:15] so let's sing
[26:17] [Music]
[26:22] it just
[26:25] Dan I am
[26:30] without one
[26:32] thing but

[30:45] family helps fill in some of the
[30:49] gaps um it's good it's good to see
[30:53] everyone tonight and very important
[30:56] subject tonight in this subject on
[31:00] repentance it's actually I think it
[31:02] could be one of the most as far as we
[31:06] are concerned as Believers one of the
[31:09] most if not the most important thing
[31:11] that we understand what repentance
[31:14] is we um on Wednesday night we have our
[31:18] Bible
[31:20] study and uh we
[31:22] started with the book of Acts and we
[31:24] went through every chapter of the book
[31:25] of Acts and we went through the Bible we
[31:27] went through every book of the Old
[31:29] Testament and now we are um going into a
[31:33] different studies on different
[31:35] characters in The Bible brother Lyle has
[31:38] been expounding on the life of this
[31:40] great man Joseph and it was requested
[31:43] for me that I take a
[31:46] subject and expound upon a subject and
[31:50] brother Jordan
[31:52] suggested this um repentance this this
[31:57] study on repentance and he said he just
[32:00] told me earlier that he said someone
[32:02] came to
[32:03] him and said that the Bible says repent
[32:06] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[32:08] Christ what does that word repent mean
[32:12] it's a really good question I think that
[32:15] we uh we might
[32:18] know um but we might think we know what
[32:21] this word means but repentance is not
[32:25] regret it's not guilt
[32:29] repentance is is everyone really feels
[32:33] bad if they do something wrong if if
[32:35] they I know that there's personality dis
[32:38] disorders but anyone in their right mind
[32:40] really they feel bad if they do
[32:41] something wrong whether they're not a
[32:43] Christian or not that's not
[32:45] repentance the Bible says that even God
[32:51] repented very strange
[32:54] thing it's impossible for God to sin
[32:58] he's perfect so he's never made a
[33:01] mistake so why would the bible say that
[33:04] God repented in certain extent the the
[33:07] king in the King James the Old King
[33:09] James language it's it's a carryover of
[33:11] an old term but on the other hand it
[33:16] really does mean that actual word of
[33:19] repent when we read that in the Bible
[33:22] and that God did that so how can God
[33:27] repent
[33:29] Bible says he he
[33:31] does the
[33:33] definition of this word repent it's from
[33:35] a Greek word it
[33:37] comes I mean all the New Testament is
[33:40] from a Greek word but um it's from the
[33:42] Greek word
[33:44] metanoia and it means a change of mind
[33:47] or a change of
[33:49] heart and there's a difference as I said
[33:51] between a a a true repentance and mere
[33:56] mere regret are mere feeling guilty so
[34:00] how how could God repent God knows what
[34:03] he's
[34:04] doing God knows what he's going to do
[34:07] God knows what we are going to do and
[34:09] what decisions that we are going to make
[34:12] and God is never wrong so how can he
[34:14] ever change his mind about
[34:16] anything but listen to this so we know
[34:20] that the Bible says that that God
[34:22] repented but numbers
[34:25] 2319 says this
[34:28] God is not a
[34:29] man that he should lie neither the son
[34:33] of man that he should
[34:37] repent hath he
[34:39] said and shall not he do
[34:42] it or hath he spoken and shall he not
[34:46] make it
[34:47] good so I understand that there's a
[34:49] difference between God's perfect will
[34:51] and God's permissive will but there's
[34:52] also a predestination which means it's
[34:55] not Calvinism means that doesn't mean
[34:58] that you don't have a choice in the
[34:59] matter that you're just for ordained to
[35:00] do what you're going to do that's not
[35:02] what predestination means that that uh
[35:05] that you're going to make certain
[35:06] decisions because they're ordained for
[35:08] you to do that God what predestination
[35:10] means is God knows what decisions that
[35:12] you are going to make before you make
[35:15] them you're still a free moral agent you
[35:17] still decide your ultimate destination
[35:20] God knows the beginning from the end so
[35:23] he knows what decision that you're going
[35:25] to make so how can God repent
[35:28] and when the Bible said right there that
[35:31] he can't
[35:33] repent Moses I mean God one time it says
[35:37] there that he repented that he ever made
[35:39] man and then another time God the Moses
[35:43] came before the Lord and he said you
[35:45] should repent of the evil that you're
[35:47] going to do against these children of
[35:49] Israel that you brought them out with a
[35:51] mighty hand and they're going to be out
[35:53] here and die in the wilderness and then
[35:54] the Egyptians are going to make fun of
[35:56] them
[35:58] so how could Moses have a better idea
[36:02] than God had it does it doesn't make
[36:04] sense so let me put it into into terms
[36:08] that I believe that um are ex answer
[36:12] this
[36:13] question if you're headed down a road to
[36:18] destruction you're going down there
[36:20] God's word says that if you go down this
[36:22] road of Destruction you're going to go
[36:24] to hell you're going to die you're going
[36:26] to have a terrible life
[36:28] God's word says that so you're going
[36:31] down this bad Road and then the Lord
[36:34] gets a hold of you and you
[36:37] change and then you repent of of your
[36:41] evil doings you repent of of your bad
[36:43] ways and you change directions so then
[36:47] God who ordained you to to be to your
[36:51] ultimate destination would be death and
[36:52] hell then God you make this decision to
[36:55] change then God changes his Direction
[36:59] because now you are on a different path
[37:01] and you are the on the path to eternal
[37:02] life and you are on the on the path to
[37:05] Prosperity so you change you made the
[37:09] decision God didn't say oh I was wrong
[37:12] in this no he gave you the decision you
[37:15] were going down this path God's word
[37:17] said that you were going to die and then
[37:20] you changed and you went in the right
[37:22] direction and the same goes for if you
[37:26] are on on the right path like the
[37:29] children of Israel they came out of
[37:32] Egypt now they were on the right path
[37:35] they were going into canaan's land they
[37:37] were going into the promised land so now
[37:40] they are going and they switch and they
[37:44] go back into sin God's ordained path was
[37:48] for them to go into the promised land
[37:49] and to prosper now they change and they
[37:52] go into idolatry they go into
[37:53] complaining they go into all these
[37:55] things so now God
[37:58] repents he has a change because of your
[38:02] change because of their change God
[38:05] doesn't change but now you went on a
[38:08] different path they went on a different
[38:10] path and it went into destruction so
[38:13] God's conversation with Moses and when
[38:17] Moses said Lord you should
[38:21] change what happened was the children of
[38:25] Israel didn't change
[38:28] God says okay I'll change but they have
[38:32] to go in the right direction my way is
[38:34] perfect they didn't go in the right
[38:36] direction and they still thousands of
[38:38] them were killed right after that and
[38:41] none of them except for two actually
[38:44] received the promise that God gave them
[38:47] because they didn't they repented of
[38:50] going down the right way they changed
[38:52] had a change of mind and wanted to go
[38:54] into sin and they went into destruction
[38:57] so that is how repenting is just it's a
[39:01] change of mind it's a change of
[39:04] Direction so God gives us
[39:08] choices and we make the
[39:12] choice
[39:14] so when I think of
[39:16] repentance I always think of one man he
[39:19] is the first one that comes to my mind
[39:21] is John the
[39:23] Baptist John the
[39:25] Baptist his message was repent let's go
[39:29] to Matthew chapter
[39:31] 3 verse one listen to this in those days
[39:36] Came John the Baptist preaching in the
[39:38] wilderness of Judea and saying repent ye
[39:41] for the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[39:43] hand for this is he that was spoken of
[39:46] by the prophet isaas saying the voice of
[39:49] one crying in the wilderness prepare ye
[39:51] the way of the Lord maketh path his path
[39:54] straight and the same John had had his
[39:57] rment of camel's hair and his and a
[39:59] leather girdle about his loins and his
[40:02] meat was Locust and wild honey then went
[40:05] out to him then went out to him
[40:09] Jerusalem and all of Judea and all the
[40:11] region around Jordan and were baptized
[40:13] of him confessing their
[40:17] sins but when he saw many of the
[40:20] Pharisees and Sadducees C come to his
[40:22] baptism he said unto them oh you
[40:24] Generation of Vipers who hath warned you
[40:27] to flee from the Wrath to come bring
[40:30] forth therefore fruits meat for
[40:32] repentance the English Standard Version
[40:34] says bear fruit in keeping with
[40:38] repentance and think not to say within
[40:41] yourselves we have Abraham to Our Father
[40:43] for I say unto you that God is able of
[40:45] these stones to raise children raise up
[40:47] children of Abraham and now also the ax
[40:50] is laid to the root of the trees
[40:51] therefore every tree which bringeth
[40:53] forth good fruit is heun down and cast
[40:55] into the fire now listen to
[40:57] this listen to John the Baptist message
[41:01] it's beautiful because we can see it
[41:02] later on in the Bible I indeed baptize
[41:06] you with baptize you with water unto
[41:09] repentance but he that cometh after me
[41:11] is mightier than I whose shoes I am not
[41:15] worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with
[41:17] the Holy Ghost and with
[41:19] fire so we have a command from from John
[41:23] to repent and John was baptizing to
[41:26] repentance and we have a prophecy from
[41:29] John the
[41:31] Baptist a prophet of God that there is a
[41:34] promise associated with
[41:38] repentance I will baptize you with
[41:40] repentance and then he will baptize you
[41:42] with the Holy
[41:44] Ghost so John baptized according to
[41:48] repent rep to
[41:50] repentance and like I said before
[41:54] repentance is not just your conscience
[41:56] making you feel feel bad it's not regret
[41:59] it's not guilt that could be the start
[42:02] of repentance and unfortunately it
[42:04] almost always is with a human
[42:08] being like we talk with brother Arie
[42:11] always he's always witnessing to this
[42:12] homeless people around and it's always
[42:15] they regret so much the decisions that
[42:17] they've made they they have such guilt
[42:21] and they look back and they say well I
[42:22] wish I wouldn't have taken that first
[42:23] drug I wish I wouldn't have started
[42:25] smoking pot right there because that was
[42:26] my game way drug and now I'm on heroin
[42:28] or I'm on meth or or fentanyl or
[42:30] whatever it is and and now I can't get
[42:32] off of it and they have this great
[42:34] regret because it's ruined their lives
[42:36] and this guilt and they just feel so bad
[42:38] about themselves the way they look and
[42:40] everything it's so sad but there's no
[42:43] repentance
[42:45] there there there's no willingness to
[42:49] change because they love the
[42:51] drug they love the street life more than
[42:55] they want to change their lives
[42:58] there's no there's no repentance and
[43:00] it's a
[43:01] beautiful testimony of this John the
[43:03] Baptist he baptized according to
[43:05] repentance to A Change John
[43:10] um6 says this about John the Baptist
[43:13] there was a man sent from God whose name
[43:15] was John the same came for a witness to
[43:17] Bear witness of the light that all men
[43:20] through him might believe he was not
[43:22] that light but was sent to Bear witness
[43:26] of that light
[43:28] light that was the True Light which lith
[43:31] every man that cometh into the world so
[43:34] John has a two-fold ministry here he has
[43:36] a two-fold um he has a two-fold message
[43:39] of repentance John was sent to call the
[43:42] people to repent to Bear a witness to
[43:44] get them to make changes in their lives
[43:47] and then later Christ would come what a
[43:51] message of hope that John the Baptist
[43:54] had you know
[43:57] we we I just talked about people who
[44:00] they they regret things and they have
[44:02] guilt in their life but they won't
[44:04] repent they won't make changes but then
[44:07] there's also on the other side and I see
[44:09] it so many times people come up for
[44:12] prayer and they're just they
[44:14] struggle and they struggle because they
[44:17] have made such
[44:19] mistakes and they can't get past
[44:23] them and I always ask him well do you
[44:28] change your way of thinking well yeah I
[44:29] don't I don't think like that anymore
[44:32] did you make changes in your life where
[44:33] you're overcoming the old s well yeah I
[44:35] don't do that anymore but I still did
[44:38] it if it was stealing you feel the guilt
[44:41] of of of that sin you know do you did
[44:44] you do your best if you stole did you do
[44:46] your best to make it right and are you
[44:49] still SE are you still stealing stealing
[44:51] no you're not you've
[44:54] repented you have actually done what
[44:56] John the Baptist said you've actually
[44:58] done these things you have changed your
[45:00] life so don't keep dwelling on that sin
[45:03] don't keep dwelling on the mistake that
[45:05] you made that is in the past you did
[45:07] make a mistake but you changed you
[45:09] repented it's over it's
[45:12] gone if it was adultery you feel the
[45:15] guilt of that but are you still
[45:17] committing
[45:19] adultery no that song that brother
[45:22] Michael sang in in the story just as I
[45:25] am you
[45:27] don't battle with your salvation you've
[45:30] repented you've changed you've laid it
[45:33] in in the presence of of Jesus Christ
[45:36] the Savior leave it there let it go
[45:40] that's there's that's no longer can
[45:42] condemn you quit trying to pull it out
[45:43] from under the blood you can't get it
[45:45] out from under the blood it's gone but
[45:48] Satan is there to try to keep accusing
[45:50] you all the time and trying to put this
[45:52] in your mind so it takes away that Joy
[45:54] of your salvation
[45:57] there's a story about um I've told this
[46:01] story in service before but it's it's a
[46:04] perfect story of repentance and that's
[46:06] this man named Wilbur Shane he was my I
[46:09] believe he was my grandfather wheeler
[46:12] his
[46:13] cousin and if you're a tape listener you
[46:16] know the story he
[46:19] was his
[46:21] wife came to brother brandom and she was
[46:25] losing her mind
[46:27] she was she was she she was overcome
[46:30] with anxiety and she was overcome with
[46:32] with with this just this horrible
[46:34] feeling she thought that she was going
[46:36] crazy so she comes to the house brother
[46:38] brandom and sister brandom they talk
[46:40] with her
[46:42] and she's telling telling brother
[46:44] brandom she has all all these problems
[46:46] and and she's she's going crazy and
[46:48] brother brandom through the discernment
[46:50] that he has and the Holy Spirit that
[46:52] operated in that gift he said sister you
[46:56] had an affair on your
[46:59] husband and she said who told you
[47:03] that and he said it's the truth she said
[47:06] don't you say that to anyone I made that
[47:09] right with God so then brother Braham
[47:11] says you didn't sin against God you
[47:12] sinned against your
[47:14] husband and there was no repentance
[47:17] there there was con there was uh there
[47:19] was guilt and that guilt was causing her
[47:21] to lose her mind and causing her to have
[47:24] all this anxiety but she had not yet
[47:26] repented
[47:28] so then brother brandom tells her go get
[47:31] your husband because he's guilty of the
[47:33] same thing she says not my husband he
[47:35] says oh yeah your husband she goes and
[47:39] tells her husband her husband
[47:40] immediately
[47:42] confesses they came to brother Brandon
[47:45] that man was a deacon in the church and
[47:47] he had an affair on his wife I used to
[47:50] talk to him on the phone he lived to be
[47:54] 99 years and 364 four days and he missed
[47:59] 100 like a few hours but I used to I
[48:02] used to talk to him on the phone and he
[48:04] never wanted to talk about that that was
[48:05] something that was in his past he didn't
[48:08] deny it but he wanted to leave that back
[48:11] there so he was a deacon in that church
[48:13] he and his wife get together they
[48:17] repent they made it right with each
[48:20] other they lived out their Earthly lives
[48:24] together in happiness
[48:27] enjoy he was a he was the um a deacon in
[48:31] the church and he told me he became the
[48:34] pastor of the church later on and he
[48:37] pastored that church for
[48:38] decades good man but it shows there was
[48:43] regret and there was guilt that was
[48:45] driving the lady crazy but when she
[48:48] repented and he repented it wiped it all
[48:51] away what a beautiful story of John the
[48:54] Baptist ministry and and the holy
[48:57] Spirit repent so see how important
[49:00] John's um Ministry
[49:03] was people were coming to be baptized we
[49:06] don't understand we baptized to
[49:07] repentance you got to understand what
[49:08] baptizing to repentance means it means
[49:11] you did wrong you had sin in your life
[49:13] so you came to John and you confessed
[49:16] that sin and you said I'm going to
[49:18] change John and he says okay come here
[49:20] on the and be baptized and he would
[49:22] baptize them and say now don't do it
[49:25] again and they their lives would change
[49:27] that's how important this baptism of
[49:29] repentance was but it came with a
[49:32] promise that John said I will baptize
[49:35] you to this repentance so that you can
[49:36] get your life right but there is coming
[49:38] one that is going to baptize you with
[49:41] the Holy Ghost in
[49:45] fire Matthew chapter 3:1 let me read it
[49:48] again I indeed baptize you with water
[49:50] unto repentance but he that cometh after
[49:52] you is mightier than I whose shoes I am
[49:54] not worthy to Bear he shall B baptize
[49:57] you with the Holy Ghost and with
[49:59] fire now we see the second promise it
[50:02] should be ringing a bell as I'm as I'm
[50:05] talking about this baptized to
[50:08] repentance and then with the Holy Ghost
[50:11] what
[50:12] scripture does that the first time it
[50:15] was fulfilled where is this
[50:17] fulfilled say
[50:19] louder Acts chapter
[50:21] 2 Acts chapter
[50:25] 2:37 Peter just been had just finished
[50:28] preaching this beautiful sermon on Jesus
[50:30] Christ being the Lamb of
[50:31] God and he said and and it says now when
[50:34] they heard this they were pricked in
[50:37] their
[50:37] hearts there was the beginning of
[50:40] repentance right there they knew that
[50:41] they had sinned they knew that they had
[50:44] to they knew that they had to make
[50:45] changes they felt remorse or regret for
[50:49] their sins that's the first step but
[50:53] true repentance had not happened yet
[50:57] or the next statement would not not have
[50:59] been necessary they were pricked in
[51:01] their heart and they said unto the Peter
[51:04] and to the rest of the Apostles men and
[51:06] Brethren what shall we do they had the
[51:09] regret and now they wanted to repent
[51:13] they wanted to make it
[51:15] right but they just didn't know what to
[51:17] do acts
[51:19] 238 Peter said unto them
[51:22] repent so the desire to serve the Lord
[51:25] and the remorse for their their sins was
[51:27] not
[51:28] enough Peter's giving them a commandment
[51:30] to further to further the
[51:34] regret and have a change of heart go
[51:36] further than just regret go further than
[51:38] the guilt and have a total change of
[51:41] heart change a change of plans in your
[51:43] whole life a change of your
[51:47] desire and be baptized every one of you
[51:50] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[51:52] remission of
[51:54] sins so repentance and bapti and baptism
[51:57] are directly tied to the washing away of
[52:01] sins New International Version says
[52:03] repent and be baptized every one of you
[52:06] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[52:08] Forgiveness of your
[52:10] sins now watch this remember John
[52:14] said the one coming after me I baptized
[52:17] to repentance but the one coming after
[52:18] me is going to baptize you with the Holy
[52:20] Ghost in fire repent every one of you
[52:22] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[52:24] Christ for the for the Forgiveness of
[52:26] your sins and you shall receive the gift
[52:29] of the Holy
[52:31] Ghost for This Promise is unto you and
[52:33] your children and to all that are far
[52:35] off even as many as the Lord Our God
[52:37] shall call perfect type of John the
[52:40] Baptist ministry that Acts chapter two
[52:43] his prophecy indeed I baptize you with
[52:45] water unto repentance but he that comes
[52:48] after me is mightier than I who shoes I
[52:50] am not worthy to Bear he shall baptize
[52:52] you with the Holy Ghost and with fire
[52:55] John the Baptist was a
[52:57] prophet and I mean Jesus said he was the
[53:00] greatest of all the
[53:02] prophets and he
[53:04] exactly acts chap
[53:06] 2:38 through
[53:08] repentance perfectly fulfilled John's
[53:11] prophecy so repentance wasn't limited to
[53:14] John the Baptist ministry it was so
[53:17] important that the first thing that
[53:20] Jesus himself preached was
[53:24] repentance he comes out he's baptized by
[53:27] John it's just beautiful everything just
[53:30] lines up so perfectly he's baptized by
[53:33] John he gets out of the water he goes
[53:35] into the Wilderness and fasts for 40
[53:38] days and his his body really becomes
[53:41] weak of course if you fast that long but
[53:44] a fast you get weak in your body but you
[53:47] get strong in the spirit and that's how
[53:50] Jesus was out there he was he was at his
[53:52] weakest point maybe with his body with
[53:54] his flesh but he was at the strongest in
[53:57] his spirit because he was totally
[54:00] surrendered to God and totally not that
[54:02] I know he was God in flesh but he was in
[54:06] flesh and his Spirit was strong he says
[54:10] I mean right after he was baptized he
[54:12] grew stronger in
[54:17] spirit then verse number let's uh
[54:21] Matthew chapter
[54:23] 4 I'll start with verse 12 I think we
[54:26] have time to read it verse 12 Matthew
[54:28] 4:12 says this now when Jesus had heard
[54:30] that John was cast into prison he
[54:32] departed into Galilee and leaving
[54:34] Nazareth he came and dwelt in capernium
[54:37] which is upon the Sea Coast the borders
[54:39] of zebulun and
[54:41] neth that it might be fulfilled which
[54:44] was spoken by the Prophet isaas isaas
[54:47] The Prophet saying the land of zebulun
[54:49] and the land of netham by the way of the
[54:51] sea Beyond Jordan of Galilee of the
[54:53] Gentiles the people which sat in
[54:56] darkness saw great light and to them
[54:59] which sat in the region and in the
[55:01] shadow of death light has sprung up now
[55:03] listen to this and from that
[55:06] time Jesus began to preach and to say
[55:11] repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[55:13] hand so repentance was the doctrine of
[55:15] John the Baptist and now it is the very
[55:18] first doctrine of Jesus Christ This is
[55:22] the first subject that we have that he
[55:25] preached on came out of the Wilderness
[55:27] and now his ministry starts and it's
[55:32] repentance and then there's a as we get
[55:35] into David here there's a process of
[55:37] repentance you you're convicted of sin
[55:41] by the Holy Spirit that's where you feel
[55:42] that guilt you feel that regret you know
[55:47] I mean how many times have I felt it
[55:49] it's like Lord I'm messed up I said
[55:51] something wrong I did something wrong I
[55:53] feel so stupid I feel so bad
[55:58] and then don't stop there now change
[56:03] directions and say I'm not going to do
[56:05] that I'm going to learn from this and
[56:07] I'm going to change so we have that
[56:09] conviction then we have that confession
[56:11] that acknowledgement of sin Lord I
[56:14] sinned I did wrong and then we have that
[56:16] turning away from sin that goes towards
[56:20] God this listen to this a couple
[56:23] scriptures I'll read here 1 John 1:9
[56:25] says this we confess our sins he is
[56:29] faithful and just to forgive us of our
[56:31] sins and to cleanse us from all
[56:34] unrighteousness if we say that we have
[56:36] not sinned we make him a liar and his
[56:38] word is not in us so he is faithful to
[56:40] forgive our sins if we make that
[56:44] confession in Acts 3:19 repent ye
[56:48] therefore Peter speaking repent ye
[56:50] therefore and be converted that your
[56:53] sins may be blotted out
[56:56] when the times of refreshing shall come
[56:58] from the presence of the Lord repent and
[57:01] be baptized for the washing away of your
[57:04] sins for the Forgiveness of your
[57:07] sins and I want
[57:09] to close with um with the story on King
[57:15] David and this is always a story that
[57:17] really troubled
[57:18] me with David and Uriah and
[57:21] basba so
[57:23] David was the king
[57:27] Uriah was a great man I don't think we
[57:30] give Uriah enough credit he was one of
[57:33] David's I only had 35 37 mighty men that
[57:38] fought with David
[57:40] Uriah fought side by side with David in
[57:44] battles he was one of his greatest
[57:46] warriors he was one of his most trusted
[57:48] people he was he was so close to David
[57:53] that his house was close to David's
[57:57] house so David is here and and David
[58:01] Uriah is out to battle and and you know
[58:03] the story David goes out on his rooftop
[58:07] and he sees this
[58:09] woman and he tells his servant go who is
[58:13] this and go get her and and she comes
[58:16] and David is the king he's the greatest
[58:18] man in all the all the world and ba
[58:22] Sheba is her name baath Sheba Falls in
[58:25] sin
[58:26] David Falls in sin with this
[58:30] woman and then she conceives this baby
[58:34] so now
[58:36] David doesn't know what to do he wants
[58:38] to cover his tracks so he goes and
[58:41] brings Uriah back and he wants Uriah to
[58:44] sleep with his wife so then Uriah might
[58:46] think it's it's his his child so he
[58:49] brings Uriah back Uriah says no not when
[58:52] my men are out there fighting I can't do
[58:54] that I can't be with my wife I can't do
[58:57] this I'm just GNA sleep out here on the
[58:58] steps and then I'm gonna go back back to
[59:00] battle what a great man Uriah was I mean
[59:04] a tremendous character in that man so
[59:07] David sends him back he sends message to
[59:11] joab stick him out close to the close to
[59:14] the wall pull back let him let Uriah die
[59:18] in
[59:20] battle terrible horrible story David
[59:24] basically murders this man
[59:27] then
[59:28] David Goes to uh the prophet Nathan
[59:31] comes to David tells him the story about
[59:33] about the lamb about there's this man
[59:36] that that had this single lamb and loved
[59:38] this lamb and and there was this rich
[59:40] man that had all of these these sheeps
[59:42] and herds and and everything and and
[59:44] this rich man wanted this this poor
[59:46] man's lamb and he goes and takes it and
[59:49] leaves that man without a lamb and and
[59:52] David says I'll kill him he should he
[59:55] should never have done I'll teach that
[59:57] man a lesson then Nathan says David
[59:58] you're that man David IM
[1:00:02] immediately immediately felt guilt and
[1:00:05] remorse over what he
[1:00:07] did and then David wrote this Psalm
[1:00:11] about that
[1:00:12] story and this
[1:00:16] Psalm I
[1:00:18] uh I never
[1:00:21] understood and just in praying about
[1:00:23] this during this this week and and and
[1:00:26] not understanding how David could murder
[1:00:31] this this man and then still be a man
[1:00:34] after God's Own
[1:00:35] Heart it always troubled me and
[1:00:39] especially this PSAL he says something
[1:00:42] in this Psalm that has always I just
[1:00:45] never understood it and I'll read it to
[1:00:48] you Psalm
[1:00:50] 51 and we'll read most most of this
[1:00:54] Psalm David writing
[1:00:57] this because of the guilt and the
[1:01:00] repentance for doing what he did to
[1:01:04] Uriah have mercy upon me oh God
[1:01:08] according to thy loving kindness
[1:01:10] according unto the multitude of thy
[1:01:12] Tender Mercies blot out my
[1:01:15] transgressions Wash Me thoroughly from
[1:01:17] mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin
[1:01:20] for I acknowledge my transgression and
[1:01:22] my sin is ever before me look at the
[1:01:24] guilt that's on David I'm always
[1:01:27] thinking about this sin I I did this
[1:01:28] wrong and and I can't get over it and
[1:01:31] it's it's really bothering me I I
[1:01:32] murdered a man not just a man I murdered
[1:01:35] a
[1:01:36] friend I had I I I committed adultery
[1:01:39] with his wife and this guilt was just
[1:01:42] all over David my sin is ever before
[1:01:46] me against thee this is the one that I
[1:01:50] i' never
[1:01:51] understood against
[1:01:53] thee the only have I
[1:01:57] sinned and done this evil in thy sight
[1:02:00] he's praying to God he's writing this
[1:02:03] Psalm the song to God and he says God
[1:02:06] against you and only you I have sinned
[1:02:08] and done this evil in thy sight that
[1:02:11] thou mightest be justified when thou
[1:02:14] speakest and be clear when thou
[1:02:18] judgest it's a troubling scripture has
[1:02:20] always been troubling to me it looks
[1:02:22] like very much like David sinned against
[1:02:24] Uriah
[1:02:26] and not necessarily against the Lord
[1:02:28] remember the story about wil Shane and
[1:02:30] his
[1:02:31] wife you sinned against each
[1:02:34] other and here is David and he said Lord
[1:02:38] I sinned against you and you
[1:02:40] only it's
[1:02:42] like how could David David say that
[1:02:45] while being Anointed with the Holy
[1:02:48] Spirit singing this this is the word of
[1:02:51] God this isn't just a letter David wrote
[1:02:54] This is the infall ible word of God
[1:02:57] spoken by the Bible calls David a
[1:03:00] prophet spoken by him Anointed with the
[1:03:04] Holy Spirit and he says I've sinned
[1:03:06] against you God and only
[1:03:09] you I said David had 37 just Elite
[1:03:13] fighting men and amongst those he must
[1:03:16] have fought side by side with this man
[1:03:17] Uriah Uriah was a loal friend and a
[1:03:21] loyal Soldier to this this man David and
[1:03:25] I read that verse and I say what about
[1:03:27] Uriah what about this mighty man why
[1:03:30] wasn't David repenting from
[1:03:32] him I tell you
[1:03:35] what if I was in uriah's
[1:03:38] place and I David killed me and I'm up
[1:03:44] there I'm like you wait until you die
[1:03:49] and I'm going to be the first one that
[1:03:51] meets
[1:03:52] you and it's going to be you think your
[1:03:54] death is going to bead you wait till you
[1:03:56] get over on this other side cuz I'm
[1:03:57] going to take you
[1:03:59] out that's the
[1:04:04] flesh but
[1:04:06] David he says I sinned against
[1:04:10] God and
[1:04:13] he what could
[1:04:16] overcome that hatred of Uriah In the
[1:04:21] Flesh what would be
[1:04:23] greater than uriah's hat hatred for
[1:04:26] somebody that did such a bad thing to
[1:04:28] him what could overcome that it' be his
[1:04:32] love for his
[1:04:33] wife so look at David here and I'm not
[1:04:36] saying that this is the answer to the
[1:04:39] question this is me this is my
[1:04:44] opinion you
[1:04:46] put David there and David sees I have
[1:04:51] taken this man's
[1:04:53] lamb I have killed him
[1:04:57] I've done a horrible act I did a
[1:04:59] horrible act to this woman I caused her
[1:05:00] to commit
[1:05:02] adultery the baby that was conceived
[1:05:06] dies what can I
[1:05:09] do what could I if somebody did me
[1:05:12] wrong and they murdered me what would be
[1:05:16] the best thing that you could do to me
[1:05:18] take care of my
[1:05:19] family take care of bath
[1:05:22] Sheba so here's David and I know it it
[1:05:24] sounds it's sounds strange because she
[1:05:27] became his wife but she didn't just
[1:05:29] become his wife he promoted her all the
[1:05:30] way to the
[1:05:32] top they had Solomon was it really
[1:05:35] David's choice of
[1:05:37] Solomon read the story it was
[1:05:40] basheba and she says hey you're going to
[1:05:42] let the your older son you're going to
[1:05:44] let him have this are you going to let
[1:05:47] Solomon my
[1:05:50] son David says
[1:05:52] Solomon every single thing that that
[1:05:56] woman B Sheba did David promoted her
[1:06:01] loved her took care of her and it was a
[1:06:04] different
[1:06:05] time back then so they had different
[1:06:08] values that we might not think of right
[1:06:10] today but he took care of the
[1:06:13] woman could it have been that he took
[1:06:16] such good care of her because of his
[1:06:18] repentance and his love for
[1:06:22] Uriah I'm not saying that that's the
[1:06:24] answer
[1:06:26] just saying that as I've never been able
[1:06:30] to put two and two together on this and
[1:06:33] it really it shows that that David
[1:06:37] was I really believe that he he honored
[1:06:40] Uriah with taking care of this
[1:06:45] wife and even more than that David says
[1:06:48] this against thee and thee only have I
[1:06:52] sinned and done this evil in thy sight
[1:06:56] and it shows when you sin against one of
[1:06:58] God's
[1:06:59] children you are sinning against God am
[1:07:03] and it's much
[1:07:06] worse for you to sin against God than it
[1:07:10] is to sin against
[1:07:12] me we don't want to ever do that but
[1:07:14] when you sin against God's children you
[1:07:17] are in fact sinning against the almighty
[1:07:21] sinning against
[1:07:23] God and you think about the story of of
[1:07:28] Jesus he went to the
[1:07:31] Cross died from my sins died for my lies
[1:07:36] died for for the things that I I had
[1:07:39] done whatever what whatever is in our
[1:07:41] past Jesus Christ died for those things
[1:07:44] and
[1:07:45] now we go we die and who's the one that
[1:07:50] meets us it's
[1:07:51] not
[1:07:54] this it's
[1:07:56] welcome my
[1:07:58] bride very different than the way that
[1:08:02] we would normally
[1:08:03] act back to verse four against thee and
[1:08:07] thee only have I sinned and done this
[1:08:09] evil in thy sight that thou mightest be
[1:08:13] justified when thou speakest and be
[1:08:15] clear when thou
[1:08:17] judgest the NIV version says against you
[1:08:20] and only you have I sinned and done what
[1:08:22] is evil in your sight so you are right
[1:08:24] in your verdict and Justified when you
[1:08:28] judge Lord I deserve your judgment I
[1:08:30] deserve it I deserved it when the baby
[1:08:32] died I deserved it when my son Absalon
[1:08:35] took the king the kingdom David is
[1:08:37] crying out and said I'm a sinner and I
[1:08:39] deserve your
[1:08:41] judgment behold I was shapen in iniquity
[1:08:45] and in sin did my mother conceive me
[1:08:47] look at the look at the the regret and
[1:08:50] look at the David and the guilt that
[1:08:52] David is saying I am so bad we often say
[1:08:55] say I was born in sin and shaped in
[1:08:57] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[1:08:59] look at how evil I am but where is the
[1:09:02] repentance and all this I haven't seen
[1:09:04] it yet in David where is the change of
[1:09:08] heart where is the change of
[1:09:11] mind this is the beginning like I said
[1:09:15] repentance starts with
[1:09:19] guilt it starts with
[1:09:22] regret it starts with feeling bad
[1:09:26] let's skip to verse
[1:09:28] 10 he says
[1:09:32] this create in me a clean heart oh God
[1:09:37] and renew a right Spirit within me this
[1:09:39] is the key verse David is saying I
[1:09:41] sinned I want to change Lord change me
[1:09:44] create in me a a clean heart and review
[1:09:48] and and and take it and renew a right
[1:09:51] spirit in me change me so here's the
[1:09:54] repentance of David was all regret
[1:09:56] regret regret I did wrong and I I feel
[1:09:58] terrible and and I'm depressed and and
[1:10:00] Lord I just hate myself I did all of
[1:10:02] this and now Lord change
[1:10:05] me there's the
[1:10:07] repentance I want to
[1:10:11] change so many people as I said they
[1:10:13] can't get over the
[1:10:15] sin they'll come and get prayed for and
[1:10:17] they're they're embarrassed they did
[1:10:19] something that embarrassed them and and
[1:10:20] it stays in their mind all the time but
[1:10:23] they don't realize that they can move
[1:10:25] forward they don't they don't have to
[1:10:27] live in the
[1:10:29] past God can take the worst of sins and
[1:10:33] turn it around if you are willing to
[1:10:36] change your
[1:10:38] mind if you are willing to change your
[1:10:41] way of thinking if you are willing to
[1:10:44] change from serving yourself to serving
[1:10:49] God look at David changed everything and
[1:10:52] even David said he he said Lord put The
[1:10:55] Joy back in my restore the joy of my
[1:10:58] salvation he didn't say his salvation
[1:11:00] was lost he said restore
[1:11:03] that and never if you have repented if
[1:11:07] you have
[1:11:09] changed don't keep living in the past
[1:11:12] it's gone it is under the
[1:11:15] blood it goes on cast me not away from
[1:11:19] thy presence and take not thy Holy
[1:11:23] Spirit from me the musicians if if you
[1:11:26] would come on
[1:11:28] close restore unto me the joy of thy
[1:11:33] salvation and uphold me with thy free
[1:11:37] spirit then I will teach transgressors
[1:11:40] Thy Thy ways and sinners will be
[1:11:42] converted unto thee so you see the
[1:11:45] change you see the repentance another
[1:11:47] repen of statement Lord my ways are
[1:11:49] going to are going to change and I'm
[1:11:51] going to point people now to you my sins
[1:11:55] are
[1:11:56] forgiven Lord I'm going to change my way
[1:11:59] skip to 16 for thou desirest not
[1:12:04] sacrifice else I would give it Lord I'd
[1:12:07] give
[1:12:09] anything I would give
[1:12:11] anything to make these sins right but
[1:12:15] that's not what you
[1:12:17] desire thou Delight us not in burnt
[1:12:21] offering God didn't want something
[1:12:23] really didn't want something to die
[1:12:25] right he never did he wanted us to live
[1:12:28] he didn't want Adam Adam and Eve to die
[1:12:31] but they repented of that road that they
[1:12:33] were going on they were going on eternal
[1:12:36] life and they changed and they went to
[1:12:39] sin and God's word was if you go down
[1:12:42] here you will
[1:12:44] die if you go here you will live God's
[1:12:48] word God's God's desire was that they
[1:12:51] live and they were going that way they
[1:12:53] changed and God repented and moved this
[1:12:57] way and says no my word says you're
[1:12:59] going to
[1:13:00] die because you went that
[1:13:05] direction thank
[1:13:08] God that there is a Salvation that there
[1:13:11] is a savior for thou desirest not
[1:13:13] sacrifice else I would give it thou
[1:13:15] Delight us not in burnt
[1:13:18] offering here's the path of the sinner
[1:13:21] back to
[1:13:23] God the sacrifices of God are a broken
[1:13:28] Spirit a broken and contrite heart oh
[1:13:32] God thou will not
[1:13:35] despise a broken and contrite contrite
[1:13:39] heart God you will not hate that you
[1:13:42] will not reject that it's
[1:13:46] sincere do good in thy good pleasure un
[1:13:49] Zion build thou the walls of Jerusalem
[1:13:53] then shalt thou be pleased with the
[1:13:54] sacrifice es of right of
[1:13:56] righteousness with burnt offerings and
[1:13:58] whole burnt offerings then they shall
[1:14:01] offer bulock upon thine
[1:14:03] altar repent change your ways and
[1:14:09] then God will accept your life and he
[1:14:13] will make a way repentance is one of the
[1:14:17] most important subjects in the entire
[1:14:20] book we have to understand what it is it
[1:14:23] is not just guilt
[1:14:25] guilt leads should lead to repentance
[1:14:30] repentance is a change of mind it's a
[1:14:33] change of path it's a change of life and
[1:14:36] we have that
[1:14:38] else Peter wouldn't have said Repent
[1:14:41] Jesus wouldn't have said repent John
[1:14:42] wouldn't have said
[1:14:43] repent if we didn't have the option to
[1:14:46] [Music]
[1:14:48] repent and then we repent we
[1:14:50] change and then God makes a way repent
[1:14:53] every one of you I love this I got to
[1:14:55] say it repent every one of you Peter
[1:15:00] speaking and be
[1:15:01] baptized repent every one of you and be

[1:15:25] brothers and sisters it's Christianity

[1:15:30] foundations of Christianity the
