[2:41] &gt;&gt; For two days.
[2:49] &gt;&gt; Well, God bless you. It's an honor to
[2:51] have you with us tonight. Welcome.
[2:54] We're going to tonight
[2:56] we are going to listen to our original
[3:00] church dedication.
[3:02] And this happened 60 years ago almost to
[3:04] the day.
[3:06] Brother Brandham and brother Green
[3:09] dedicated this this church not in this
[3:12] building, another building, but we claim
[3:15] it. It's the same Tucson Tabernacle that
[3:18] was dedicated way back then.
[3:20] for um for some of the I don't see any
[3:24] new people James maybe uh maybe maybe
[3:27] you
[3:28] some of the history here is uh the
[3:31] founder of our church brother Perry
[3:34] Green
[3:35] uh he was very close with a wonderful
[3:39] man named William Brandham prophet of
[3:42] God and tremendous ministry way back in
[3:44] the 50s and 60s and
[3:48] this church was founded in a very very
[3:51] special way. Tonight we're going to hear
[3:56] the dedication of the church and then we
[3:59] are going to have our 60-y year
[4:02] anniversary and and rededication of the
[4:05] church Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
[4:07] We'll have those meetings looking really
[4:09] I'm really really looking forward to
[4:11] those. I want to give a little bit of a
[4:14] background to what's going on for this
[4:18] sermon that we're going to listen to
[4:19] tonight. Brother Brandham,
[4:22] uh, I'll start with my grandfather. I
[4:27] was very, very close to Brother Brandon,
[4:28] my dad and my family,
[4:32] and he lived down in Georgia. And he
[4:36] always wanted to move up to
[4:37] Jeffersonville. and he would ask,
[4:38] "Brother Brandham, I'd like to come up
[4:41] and and be there with you in
[4:43] Jeffersonville." And brother Brandham
[4:44] would always say, "No, Brother Evans, I
[4:46] want you to stay in Georgia right now. I
[4:48] feel that that's that's the best thing
[4:50] for you to do."
[4:52] And Brother Brandon would come down and
[4:53] stay with my family really since like
[4:57] around 1950 or early 50s. They're very,
[5:01] very close.
[5:04] And he would every once in a while he'd
[5:05] say, "Brother Brandham, you know, I'd
[5:07] like to be close to you. I'd like to
[5:09] drive all of this way every weekend from
[5:12] Georgia all the way to southern
[5:15] Indiana." And brother Brandham would
[5:17] just kind of say, "Well, you know, I do
[5:19] whatever you want, but I would wait."
[5:22] And then in 1962,
[5:26] Brother Brandham called up my grandpa
[5:28] and he said, "Brother Evans," he said,
[5:30] "you still want to move to
[5:31] Jeffersonville."
[5:33] and he says, "Yeah, I'd like to." And he
[5:35] says, "Well, if it was me," he said,
[5:37] "I'd move to Tucson." He said, "Because
[5:40] I'm moving to Tucson." So, my grandpa
[5:44] and the family, they uh sold the
[5:47] business in Georgia. And Brother
[5:50] Brandham found a station, a service
[5:53] station on Park Avenue, not too far from
[5:55] here. And he said, he told my grandpa,
[5:58] he said, "This would be a nice place for
[6:02] the brothers to come together and be
[6:04] able to fellowship with each other
[6:05] during the day and whatever time they
[6:07] want to come together." He said, "I wish
[6:08] I had a place that was just kind of a
[6:11] meeting place for all the brethren to
[6:14] come together and just enjoy
[6:16] themselves." And he found that station
[6:20] over on Park Avenue. And so my
[6:22] grandfather bought the station and he
[6:24] ran that station for a while. And you're
[6:29] going to hear brother Brandham in this
[6:30] sermon. I've listened to the sermon, I
[6:32] don't know, four or five times in the
[6:34] past few weeks. You're going to hear
[6:36] brother Brandham talk about this church
[6:39] giving the people a place to go to
[6:40] church, a place to fellowship. And it's
[6:44] people from really from all over the
[6:45] country. It's brother Green is from
[6:47] Bumont, Texas.
[6:49] Then um my uh my grandpa was from
[6:51] Georgia. My my mom's family did the same
[6:55] thing. They they moved out here. My my
[6:58] other grandfather was a deacon for
[7:00] brother Brandham.
[7:02] And uh they started uh grandpa told me
[7:04] that they started a lot of the leaders
[7:07] in the church started having dreams that
[7:09] they should also move to Tucson. So that
[7:13] there was many of them that made the
[7:16] decision also to move here.
[7:19] and uh
[7:21] this church
[7:23] provided them a place to go. And you'll
[7:26] hear at the end towards the end of the
[7:28] sermon, brother Brandham says that or um
[7:33] during the sermon a couple times he says
[7:35] that, you know, it gives the people a
[7:37] place to go so they're not the kids
[7:39] aren't out riding their bikes on Sunday
[7:41] and they they don't basically disrespect
[7:43] Sunday. He wanted them to be in church.
[7:47] And this place provided that provided
[7:50] that for my family, from my ancestors,
[7:53] and for many of yours. And and um maybe
[7:56] even
[7:58] I don't I doubt anyone was there when
[8:00] brother Random dedicated this church
[8:02] many years ago, but it provided a place
[8:07] for the people to go and fellowship just
[8:10] like my grandpa's station gave the
[8:13] brothers a chance. have have a nice
[8:17] place of fellowship. Friends,
[8:19] fellowship's important.
[8:21] It's important that that we are
[8:23] together. It's important that we come
[8:25] together as many times as we can to come
[8:27] to church. And it's important that we
[8:29] are also together when we're not in
[8:31] church. It's important to just see each
[8:35] other and encourage each other. Go to
[8:37] lunch with each other. Have have dinner.
[8:41] Do do the things. Go hiking. Enjoy
[8:44] Tucson. En enjoy each other's
[8:47] fellowship. It gives us strength. The
[8:50] Bible tells us, it says, don't neglect
[8:53] that the assembling together. Um
[8:56] especially as you see the day
[8:58] approaching. And that's not just going
[9:01] to church. Going to church is is the the
[9:03] the biggest part of it, but it's also
[9:06] being together.
[9:08] And how many times did the brethren get
[9:10] together at that service station and
[9:12] just laugh and talk about give each
[9:15] other's testimonies and how important
[9:18] that was. And then the most important
[9:21] place really was this place that brother
[9:24] Green had it on his heart to move here
[9:27] and to start this church. And it was
[9:32] tremendous. Really was. You're gonna
[9:35] hear Brother Brandham talk about a man
[9:36] named Jack Moore.
[9:38] Jack Moore was a pastor in Shreveport,
[9:41] Louisiana. He was a longtime friend of
[9:45] brother Brandon. Very long time. Do you
[9:48] remember the story in I believe it was
[9:51] around the mid40s, maybe around 1947
[9:55] around there where Brother Brandham was
[9:58] in Oregon and there was a man that came
[10:02] in that wanted to disrupt the service
[10:06] and was going to take a swing at Brother
[10:08] Brandham in the pull pit. And the man
[10:11] came running down the aisle
[10:15] to take him out and brother Brandham
[10:19] called upon the name of the Lord and the
[10:21] man fell down right at his feet. You
[10:23] remember that story? Jack Moore saw that
[10:27] he was there and another man that you
[10:29] might know his name TL Osborne. Both of
[10:32] them, these are James, these are great
[10:34] evangelists back in the 1950s. Both of
[10:37] them saw this happen. Jack Moore got on
[10:40] the phone to this other man that you
[10:44] might know his name named Gordon Lindsay
[10:47] and he said, "Hey, you gotta get up here
[10:50] because this is something special. This
[10:54] is a big deal. This man is praying for
[10:57] the sick and all these people are
[10:58] getting healed. This just happened." So
[11:00] Gordon Lindsay
[11:03] came into the picture and he eventually
[11:05] became Brother Bram's campaign manager
[11:07] and Jack Moore a close friend.
[11:10] And this was uh
[11:14] Brother Green knew all of those people.
[11:17] He was friends with them because of the
[11:18] Christian businessman. I wish I could
[11:21] have I wish I could have talked with
[11:23] brother Green about about these men and
[11:25] about all that he knew in dealing with
[11:28] these these brothers they um
[11:32] so after this sermon that we're going to
[11:35] hear tonight when brother Green brother
[11:38] Brandham dedicated this church then
[11:41] brother Brandham and I think he mentions
[11:42] it in the sermon he drives to
[11:45] Shrivefeport Louisiana
[11:48] to um have a series of meetings there
[11:51] and while he was there he pre I mean he
[11:54] preached some of the really that series
[11:56] in shreport is just wonderful
[12:00] one of the sermons that he preached I
[12:02] believe was preached by prophecy
[12:06] and uh sister hope that song in the
[12:08] wings of a snow white dove I've told
[12:10] this story before you all know it but
[12:12] I'm going to tell it again um because I
[12:15] like it
[12:17] brother Brandham and my dad and my
[12:21] grandfather
[12:23] were together in Georgia, I believe it
[12:26] was,
[12:27] and brother Brandham said, "Have you
[12:30] heard that new song on the radio by
[12:33] Ferland Husky called On the Wings of a
[12:36] Snow White Dove?" It was a popular um
[12:39] the country music uh radio radio would
[12:42] play it and uh it's just a well you
[12:44] heard the song that Sister Hope sang
[12:47] and my grandpa and my dad said yeah you
[12:49] know we've heard it and brother Brandham
[12:51] said I have a message I'm going to
[12:52] preach and he said I'm going to title it
[12:55] on the wings of a snow white dove
[12:58] and he says when you hear me preach that
[13:00] sermon he said you know it's my time to
[13:03] go
[13:05] and that was in I think it was in 1961
[13:07] one is when that song came out as a
[13:08] brand new song. Then fast forward to the
[13:11] dedication of our church in 1965.
[13:14] November 21st, 1965.
[13:18] Brother Brandham says that I'm about to
[13:20] go to Shreveport. And he goes to
[13:24] Shreveport
[13:25] and he preaches a sermon called On the
[13:28] Wings of a Snow White Dove. My dad was
[13:30] there. My grandpa was there.
[13:33] and they didn't remember
[13:36] when they were there that he had told
[13:38] them this years before that it was his
[13:42] time to to go when when the sermon was
[13:44] preached.
[13:46] Then brother Brandham preaches those
[13:49] sermons and he even says in that sermon
[13:51] he says this is a memorial service
[13:55] [snorts]
[13:55] and he had a prayer line and Jack Moore
[13:58] came up the one that he's going to
[13:59] mention all of his old many of brother
[14:01] Bram's old friends came up and they had
[14:03] a prayer line and they prayed for the
[14:05] people
[14:07] that was that was again that was just a
[14:10] few days after the sermon we're going to
[14:12] hear tonight
[14:14] brother Brandham came back to Tucson
[14:17] uh he went to uh he went to California
[14:19] and went to Yuma's always gone. Came
[14:22] back to Tucson and within
[14:26] a month of when he preached this sermon
[14:29] uh the on the wings of a snow white dove
[14:31] sermon and then within a month and a few
[14:33] days of this sermon he was in a tragic
[14:36] car wreck and died.
[14:40] And
[14:42] I believe this church
[14:46] was very very important to brother
[14:49] you're going to hear it tonight how
[14:50] important it was to brother Brad. He
[14:55] preached the series in Shreport
[14:58] preached a a sermon in um Yuma a
[15:02] wonderful sermon called the rapture.
[15:03] came back, preached um ministered with
[15:08] brother Green communion
[15:10] on December 12th, 1965
[15:14] and then was few days later was driving
[15:18] back home back to Jeffersonville and was
[15:21] in a car wreck and then died on
[15:23] Christmas Eve in 1965.
[15:28] sermon we're going to listen to tonight
[15:30] was leading up to to that
[15:34] um
[15:40] Jack Moore, Brother Brandham,
[15:43] he mentions this twice in this sermon
[15:46] about brother Green and
[15:50] it to me
[15:53] is just striking what brother Brandham
[15:57] says.
[15:58] He says this, I mean, right when he gets
[16:00] going, second the second paragraph, he
[16:03] says this. I don't want to take brother
[16:05] Green's time here because I heard
[16:07] brother Green several times speak and I
[16:10] will and I certainly was influenced
[16:13] and as he brought the word of the Lord
[16:15] to us and so humble about it. Listen to
[16:18] this. Yesterday, brother Brand speaking
[16:20] about brother Green yesterday.
[16:23] He said, "I don't get the word from the
[16:26] Lord as maybe it would come in
[16:28] Revelation as it's been sent, but said,
[16:32] I like to stress on what has been said."
[16:36] He said, "Like when Paul wrote something
[16:38] in the Bible, I come here to stress on
[16:41] what he said." Said, "I have no message
[16:43] only to stress on what's been what's
[16:46] already been said from the Lord."
[16:48] Brother Brandham says, "Now, that was
[16:50] really remarkable.
[16:52] a young fellow like that and say and
[16:56] make a remark like that.
[16:59] Then later on, brother Brandham comes
[17:01] back to it. It made such an impression
[17:03] on brother Random
[17:06] and as his word brother Randman later on
[17:08] he says this and as his word said the
[17:11] message doesn't come to me through the
[17:13] giving of of the inspiration as it does
[17:15] maybe to some of us but he said I am
[17:19] here to back up what God has given. What
[17:24] a statement, Brother Brandham said.
[17:28] And
[17:30] I was listening, I've been listening to
[17:31] this, like I said, over over and over
[17:34] for the past month. And I mentioned that
[17:38] I had that experience
[17:41] with it was almost like brother Green
[17:43] was in front of me and I knew that he
[17:46] was suffering. I knew that he was hurt
[17:49] because some of the things that he was
[17:51] saying and it was a time that of just
[17:54] horrible turmoil
[17:57] that there there was these fights with
[17:59] the copyright and and all of these
[18:02] problems and he was brother Green was
[18:04] just being hit. He was being attacked.
[18:08] And
[18:11] as I was I had that experience with
[18:13] brother Green and I just wanted to tell
[18:15] him that I really just appreciated it. I
[18:17] really appreciated what he was trying to
[18:18] do.
[18:20] And
[18:22] from what I've heard brother Green speak
[18:29] and it's something that really hits me
[18:33] um hard and and sometimes I I get I
[18:35] almost resent some people doing this and
[18:38] I've never heard brother Green do it in
[18:40] in the sermons that I've listened to.
[18:43] I don't feel like brother Green ever
[18:47] took,
[18:49] at least I've never heard him take what
[18:51] brother Brandham said and then tried to
[18:53] tell you what brother Brandham meant
[18:55] when he said it.
[18:57] I just feel like he had too much respect
[18:59] to do that. He always pointed to him. He
[19:02] always pointed to what he said and he
[19:04] used his own experiences
[19:07] to point people to the prophet. And I
[19:11] think that's a good legacy to have. And
[19:13] brother Brandham said it on this tape.
[19:17] He said that he he said that what
[19:20] brother Green was doing. And then for
[19:23] the next 50 years after that, Brother
[19:27] Green would go all over the world and
[19:30] point back to Brother Brown. And he did
[19:34] it better than anyone else did in my
[19:37] opinion. He lifted he lifted brother
[19:39] Bram's ministry up. He pointed back to
[19:42] him. He gave his the testimonies that he
[19:44] had. He used them to promote this man's
[19:48] ministry. And I think he did an
[19:51] absolutely outstanding job. And in fact,
[19:54] in fact, I think he did not just an
[19:57] outstanding job. I don't think anyone
[19:59] could compare to what he did. in and
[20:02] what brother Green again using what he
[20:05] had learned using his own experiences
[20:09] and doing exactly what brother Brandham
[20:12] said in the tape that we're going to
[20:13] hear tonight for 50 years he did it. man
[20:18] has my respect very much so
[20:23] and I will give I'll give
[20:27] as I was praying about this and as I was
[20:31] studying on these things really over the
[20:34] past month um
[20:37] one one experience that I have kept
[20:39] coming to mind and really it has to do
[20:42] with this church and I used to come to
[20:45] this church every once in a while when I
[20:47] dating Stephanie and um then of course
[20:51] we moved to Jeffersonville when we got
[20:53] married. But uh this one hits me and
[20:59] it's something that this church and
[21:01] especially Brother Green is responsible
[21:02] for. And that is in 2000 I believe it
[21:07] was 2012
[21:08] that
[21:11] a Jewish man I was working in the
[21:13] ministry in Jeffersonville and a Jewish
[21:15] man called
[21:17] And his conversation with me really
[21:21] shook me up
[21:23] because basically
[21:26] he was telling me that I was wrong in
[21:30] everything that I thought I was right
[21:34] in.
[21:35] But he was right. What happened was this
[21:39] man, he was introduced
[21:42] miraculously
[21:44] to the Lord Jesus. He was a practicing
[21:48] Jew and as a young man he was introduced
[21:51] to the Lord Jesus. Somebody came by and
[21:53] gave him a Gideon Bible. And he says, "I
[21:55] don't want it. I'm not uh I'm not
[21:57] Catholic. That's Catholic. It's about
[21:59] Mary and all that." And the man said,
[22:00] "No, just read it." And he they argued
[22:02] back and forth. Well, finally he he took
[22:04] the little New Testament Bible and he
[22:07] said, "I couldn't take it and not read
[22:08] it." So then he read it
[22:11] and he saw that this wasn't about Mary
[22:14] and the Pope and all of that. This New
[22:17] Testament was as Jewish as the Old
[22:19] Testament was. Everybody in the New
[22:22] Testament was Jewish. Peter and James
[22:25] and John and Paul and all of them, these
[22:28] were Jews.
[22:29] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[22:30] &gt;&gt; Jesus was within, of course, we know he
[22:33] was God's son, but the lineage is from
[22:36] the the the um lineage of David.
[22:40] And so he saw this and it just really
[22:44] struck him. And then he he was praying
[22:47] about it. He gave his heart to the Lord
[22:48] Jesus. And his family kind of disowned
[22:51] him for doing it. And he ended up um he
[22:55] ended up uh
[22:58] having a vision
[23:01] and in that vision the Lord came to him
[23:06] and among other things he said that
[23:08] someone within a week someone is going
[23:11] to bring you a further a um I forgot his
[23:16] exact words but someone's going to bring
[23:18] you something that's very important.
[23:22] So with about three or four days later,
[23:26] he gets a knock on his door and it's
[23:29] this man, a tall thin man, and he says,
[23:34] "Can I talk to you about the Lord?" And
[23:37] my this Jewish man, he says, he says,
[23:40] "Oh, I gave my heart to the Lord Jesus."
[23:41] He says, "I was Jew." He says, "Now now
[23:43] and now I know the Bible and and now I
[23:45] understand that they're all Jewish and
[23:47] this is a Jewish book and it's really
[23:48] not for the Gentiles. I mean, you guys
[23:50] get it, but but it's really for us, you
[23:52] know, and he starts telling about how
[23:54] the the New Testament is actually for
[23:56] the Jews and the Gentiles. It's like,
[23:58] yeah, yeah, yeah, you guys are good, but
[23:59] but kind of stay out of our way. So, he
[24:04] and then this man says, "I want to tell
[24:05] you that God sent a prophet."
[24:08] And he says, "Oh." He says, "I had a
[24:11] vision, you know, a few days ago."
[24:15] And uh this man introduces them to the
[24:18] same ministry that brother Green fell in
[24:20] love with many many years ago
[24:24] and he um
[24:27] gives him
[24:29] contact information for the Tucson
[24:31] Tabernacle.
[24:33] Now he's living in San Diego.
[24:36] He drives to Tucson, comes to this
[24:40] church,
[24:42] and he he he bought
[24:46] the full volume of those red books that
[24:49] Brother Green published. You know which
[24:51] ones I'm talking about. Those red books
[24:53] are just basically the transcribed
[24:55] sermons.
[24:57] And he
[25:00] because he bought those,
[25:02] he didn't have enough money to get back
[25:04] home to San Diego.
[25:06] So he gets to Yuma and he runs out of
[25:09] money and he goes and works in the
[25:13] fields picking onions to get enough gas
[25:16] to drive back all the way to San Diego.
[25:19] So when he gets back and he starts
[25:22] reading these books and starts studying
[25:24] this and his longtime girlfriend who he
[25:26] was engaged to marry
[25:29] his her parents said that he wasn't a
[25:33] high enough class Jew
[25:36] to marry their daughter. So they forced
[25:39] her to marry another Jewish boy. It
[25:43] broke Ram's heart.
[25:45] Ram left. He went back home back to
[25:48] Jerusalem where he lived for a long
[25:50] time.
[25:53] And for like 20 years,
[25:56] all that man knew of William Brandham
[25:59] was those volumes of books. He never
[26:02] heard another message preacher. He never
[26:04] heard anyone else give witness. He never
[26:07] heard anything. All that he ever knew
[26:10] was those volumes of books. He was at
[26:14] the I knew another man. remember um
[26:16] Frier Tuck [laughter]
[26:18] um
[26:20] what was his name? Steve Goldberg. Steve
[26:24] Goldberg was a Jew and he was uh he
[26:27] would fellowship with us. The tape's
[26:29] short, so
[26:32] [laughter]
[26:35] that's the highlight. I'm just trying to
[26:36] build up to it. So Steve Goldberg, who I
[26:40] knew in Jeffersonville at the Brandon
[26:43] Tabernacle, he would sit and the guy he
[26:45] would sit in the front and brother Joe,
[26:47] he was like twice your size, but built
[26:49] like you, but the guy was just a a fire
[26:52] plug, you know, and and he was he would
[26:56] sit in the front and he would fall
[26:58] asleep and snore every service and it's
[27:02] like, "Brother Steve, sit in the back."
[27:04] But anyways, he uh he he was he was just
[27:07] a really neat guy. And he told me, I
[27:09] knew he was Jewish. And I said, "Hey,
[27:10] give me your testimony." And Steve says,
[27:13] he says, "Well," he says, "It's it's an
[27:15] angel came to me." He says, "I was at
[27:18] the Whailing Wall in Jerusalem."
[27:20] And he said, "I was praying at the
[27:24] Wailing Wall." He says, "I was from the
[27:26] United States." And and but I was going
[27:28] there. It was kind of a pilgrimage. And
[27:30] I was praying at the Wailing Wall. And
[27:32] he said, "This little man came up to
[27:34] me." And he starts witnessing to me
[27:38] about the Lord Jesus.
[27:40] And he said, "He was so compelling in
[27:44] what he said that I gave my heart to the
[27:47] Lord Jesus right there at the wailing
[27:49] wall." And he said he was just one of
[27:51] the he said he said, "Brother, this man
[27:53] was an absolute angel." And he said he
[27:56] told me when I get back to go to
[27:59] Jeffersonville, Indiana, and there I
[28:01] would find more information. And he
[28:04] said, I went and he he said, I went back
[28:06] and I prayed and I looked back and he
[28:08] was gone. He said, "Brother, there was
[28:10] an angel."
[28:12] And
[28:14] I was like, "Wow." You know, that's that
[28:16] was one of the coolest testimonies I've
[28:18] ever heard in my life. Here's this Jew
[28:19] at the Wailing Wall and an angel comes
[28:21] down and introduced into the Lord Jesus
[28:23] and now he's in Jeffersonville and I
[28:24] know him and I'm friends with him and
[28:27] and after I met Ram, my friend from San
[28:31] Diego who had who had gone and and just
[28:34] been studying those books,
[28:37] he asked me,
[28:39] he said, "Oh, yeah." He goes, "Brother
[28:42] Daniel," he says, "I forgot to ask you."
[28:45] He says, "I met a man at the Whailing
[28:48] Wall one time named Steve Goldberg." He
[28:51] said, "Did you ever hear of him?" I was
[28:54] like,
[28:55] "You're
[28:57] the angel?" He goes, "What?"
[29:00] I said, "Brother Ram,
[29:04] he gave his heart to the Lord Jesus at
[29:07] that moment that you witnessed to him
[29:11] and he did exactly what you said." and
[29:14] he is still here this day.
[29:18] And he he was happy about that. It put
[29:20] him in a in touch with each other. And
[29:23] then
[29:25] the thing that meant the most to me
[29:26] about this man
[29:29] was he was a complete virgin to brother
[29:33] Brandham's message.
[29:35] He didn't have all of these different
[29:37] doctrines that we have today. And you
[29:39] can see maybe why I minister the way
[29:42] that I do.
[29:45] And he told me that his first words to
[29:48] me, one of his first words to to me that
[29:50] very first conver conversation, he said,
[29:53] "You ruined William Brandham's message."
[29:57] The Holy Spirit
[29:59] spoke to me and said, "Listen to him."
[30:02] And all of this was because Brother
[30:04] Green had it on his heart to publish
[30:08] these books and to get them into the
[30:10] hands of the people. got them into the
[30:13] hands of a Jewish man and ram rashover.
[30:17] That man brought these books
[30:21] all the way to Israel and studied them
[30:24] for 20 years before he got Crohn's
[30:26] disease and had to come back to Phoenix
[30:29] to have a a surgery done and then he
[30:32] lived out his days in Hawaii, no less.
[30:35] But I was friends with him for a year
[30:37] and he was a tremendous impact on me.
[30:43] really because it comes back to this
[30:45] place
[30:47] and the burden that Perry Green had on
[30:50] his heart to do exactly what brother
[30:54] Brandham said in this sermon, quoting
[30:59] Brother Green and and saying that
[31:01] Brother Green, he wanted to just build
[31:04] on on what other men had done, what
[31:07] their revelation, which he dedicated his
[31:10] life to doing that and I think many of
[31:12] us are here today because of that.
[31:15] So I was just
[31:19] blessed beyond measure to listen to this
[31:22] sermon
[31:24] because
[31:26] it comes right down to me. Not not just
[31:28] because my family on both sides was
[31:30] really close to William Brandon. Not
[31:32] because of that and not because of um
[31:36] that I'm now
[31:38] trying to fill very very big shoes. And
[31:42] brother Green, a great man of God and
[31:45] and and one of the
[31:48] um somebody everyone knows around the
[31:51] world. I could never fill those shoes.
[31:54] But because of those red books that he
[31:58] felt on his heart, they they have a huge
[32:01] impact on me and and my ministry and my
[32:06] direction that the Lord has placed me.
[32:09] So, we're going to hear some we'll hear
[32:12] that. We will um I said he talks about
[32:15] Jack Moore and explain I've been to Jack
[32:17] Moore's church. I I didn't go to a
[32:19] service, but it's still there in
[32:20] Shreveport. I don't know if it's the
[32:22] exact same place, but still they they
[32:24] followed his um his lead. And brother
[32:28] Brandham, you'll hear brother Brandham
[32:30] say, and as I said, brother Moore was a
[32:33] close friend of him.
[32:35] Brother Brandham was like, "Yeah, but he
[32:36] just never really believed me, you know,
[32:39] and and I think it was on a couple of
[32:42] the doctrines that Brother Brandham
[32:44] had."
[32:45] And you could see that
[32:48] he really appreciated brother Green
[32:50] because he stood right there and said,
[32:51] "I believe it." [laughter]
[32:53] So, let's um let's all stand
[32:57] and let's sing
[33:00] the battle hymn
[33:02] that Brother Brandham would always have
[33:05] sung when he would take the pulpit. This
[33:08] great old tune called Only Believe.
[33:14] Only
[33:16] believe.
[33:21] Only
[33:23] believe.
[33:27] All things are possible.
[33:33] Only
[33:36] believe.
[33:39] Only
[33:41] believe.
[33:45] Only
[33:47] believe.
[33:51] All things [singing]
[33:53] are possible.
[33:57] Only
[34:01] be seated.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; November the 21st. What house will you
[34:09] you build me?
[34:19] Really appreciate it. I appreciate the
[34:21] whole thing.
[34:24] Brother Brandon prayed
[34:27] that this place would be a place that we
[34:30] can invite people to
[34:33] place that
[34:35] we could invite our our neighbors and
[34:38] our friends
[34:40] and I hope that this place grows again.
[34:46] It was really big and then
[34:49] it didn't
[34:51] it's the the Tucson Tabernacle was
[34:53] really really big and then it got small.
[34:56] But you know what? It didn't get small.
[34:58] What happened was all these other
[35:00] churches around formed
[35:03] and they flourished.
[35:06] So it's been a blessing. I remember
[35:09] brother Brandham said when um
[35:12] when uh Junior Jackson and Don Ruddle
[35:17] when they left the Brandom Tabernacle
[35:21] and then Brother Bram said great. He
[35:23] says he says this is good. He says we'll
[35:26] just fill it back up again and then
[35:28] we'll just dump it out again. That's the
[35:30] attitude that we should have. So let's
[35:32] fill this place up. Let's let's make
[35:36] this place that same thing that brother
[35:38] Brandon prayed that it would be. Let
[35:41] this place be a strength and a
[35:43] lighthouse to this city called Tucson.
[35:46] We together. Let's all stand. Daniel,
[35:58] my boat alive
[36:01] sails on a troubled sea
[36:05] wherever there's a wind in my sail.
[36:14] that I have a friend
[36:17] who watches over me
[36:21] when the breeze turns into a girl.
[36:30] I know the master of the wind.
[36:37] I know the maker of the rain.
[36:44] And he can calm the storm,
[36:48] make the sun shine again.
[36:52] I know the master of the wind.
[37:00] Sometimes I soar like an eagle in the
[37:05] sky.
[37:07] Among the peaks my [music] soul can be
[37:11] found.
[37:14] An unexpected storm
[37:18] may [music] drive me from the heights,
[37:21] may bring me low, but can never bring me
[37:25] down.
[37:30] I know the master of the wind
[37:37] and I know the maker of the rain.
[37:43] And he can calm the storm. [music] Make
[37:47] the sun shine again.
[37:51] I know the master of the real.
[37:59] Sorry.
[38:02] I know the master of the wind.
[38:07] [music]
[38:09] I know [singing] the maker of the rain.
[38:16] And he can calm the storm, make the sun
[38:20] shine again.
[38:24] I know the master of the wind.
[38:32] Please this week
[38:35] pray. Pray for our church.
[38:39] We went through a at least I did went
[38:42] through a really hard time the past few
[38:44] weeks. And
[38:47] those hard times make us better. They
[38:50] make us stronger.
[38:53] They shake the foundations
[38:56] a little bit.
[38:58] that that old tree that's planted by the
[39:01] water, that wind comes and and that and
[39:04] it shakes that tree and it just loosens
[39:06] up those roots a little bit so they can
[39:08] grow.
[39:10] The the the the ground gets really hard
[39:13] and the roots have a tough time
[39:14] penetrating that ground, but when that
[39:16] tree is shaken, then that ground loosens
[39:20] up and and then out goes those new roots
[39:23] to allow that tree to continue to grow.
[39:25] Brother Aaron Garrett, would you come
[39:28] and close as brother Aaron's coming?
[39:32] I want to read this again.
[39:37] Says here,
[39:41] and I believe
[39:43] by that that almighty God will bless you
[39:45] if you will just stand by this church
[39:48] now, this group of people.
[39:52] Not only that, but let's go out and see
[39:54] if we can't get others to come in. See,
[39:57] let's speak to others everywhere. Speak
[40:00] to them about our church. What it means
[40:06] we're here. We want you to come bring
[40:09] strangers. And I'm sure it will be good
[40:12] for all of us.
[40:15] We have a building which we're thankful
[40:16] for. We're thankful for this place to
[40:20] gather together.
[40:23] I really believe that's the spirit
[40:25] that's in our church now. And there are
[40:27] many people, you see them on Sunday
[40:29] morning. There are many people that have
[40:31] found a place. They found a home. I know
[40:35] I'm looking at one of them right now.
[40:37] Raise your hand, James.
[40:39] Bless you, my friend. We're glad to have
[40:42] you.
[40:44] That's what we stand for. We love the
[40:47] Lord and we serve the Lord and the only
[40:50] way that we have to serve the Lord.
[40:53] He's God. We can't do anything for him.
[40:56] We can sure do things for his people.
[40:59] Amen.
[41:06] This December will be 50 years since we
[41:09] first came visited
[41:12] for the December meetings.
[41:15] 50 years have passed. A lot has
[41:17] happened, but he has never failed
[41:21] and he he will not fail. So, let's just
[41:24] just believe that. Lord, as
[41:27] we listen to your servant, Brother Brand
[41:30] speak and
[41:32] and pray over the brother Green that
[41:34] would be the pastor of this place for a
[41:36] long time.
[41:39] But greater than that is your promise to
[41:41] never leave us.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. to watch over us, Lord.
[41:46] And though we might fail, and though we
[41:48] might do something wrong, and you still
[41:51] love us, we're your children, Lord. So,
[41:53] we want to go forward
[41:57] first of all in you. Let Christ be made
[42:00] known through us to others.
[42:03] The scripture says that we are the light
[42:04] of the world, Lord, and that's Christ in
[42:06] us. May this church always be a place
[42:10] where we weary pilgrims can come and
[42:13] find rest.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; The rest is not necessarily so much
[42:18] physical but a resting of the heart and
[42:20] the spirit
[42:22] Lord. And then to continue on the
[42:25] journey Lord. May we pray for one
[42:27] another. May we support one another
[42:29] Lord. May we encourage one another
[42:31] always. Sometimes it seems like somebody
[42:34] has a greater part.
[42:37] But if you begin to take out the
[42:39] foundation, all of it will come down,
[42:41] Lord. Strengthen us more today. We pray,
[42:43] Lord, as we commit this weekend, Lord,
[42:46] to you.
[42:48] May we give our all for it, Lord, as you
[42:50] gave your all, Lord. Bless each one as
[42:53] they go home, Lord, and as the next few
[42:55] days that come forward. Lord, we just
[42:58] anticipating that you, Lord, would meet
[42:59] with us in Jesus Christ's name we ask.
[43:03] Amen.
[43:10] I know the master [singing]
[43:13] of the wind.
[43:18] I know the maker of the rain.
[43:26] And he can [music and singing] calm the
[43:28] storm and make the sun shine again.
[43:34] I know the master of the wind.
[43:47] I'm excited.
[43:49] I feel good. There's good spirit here
[43:52] tonight. We're not too many people,
[43:55] but it doesn't matter. God can he can
[44:00] take one man and he can part the Red
[44:02] Sea.
[44:04] And I know that he promised us that if
[44:06] we would be here, the same one that
[44:08] parted the Red Sea, the same one
[44:14] that um multiplied the fishes and the
[44:17] loaves is the same one maybe with us
[44:20] here tonight. I just I feel I feel that
[44:23] he's pleased. God bless you, friends.
[44:27] Remember
[44:29] These meetings this weekend are very
[44:31] very important. So please invite invite
[44:35] whoever you think would benefit from uh
[44:38] from these meetings. Friday night really
[44:40] looking forward. We're going to have um
[44:43] some testimonies from some of the maybe
[44:46] the newer people that came have come
[44:50] over the past couple years.
[44:52] And then if we have time, brother Steve
[44:55] Personne will say a few words. He's a
[44:57] wonderful ministry for families. And
[45:00] then on Saturday night, brother Steve uh
[45:02] will minister for us. And then on Sunday
[45:06] morning, we will talk about the
[45:08] direction of the church, the missionary
[45:10] program that I want to um talk with the
[45:13] church about. And uh just that we're
[45:17] going to continue on. We're going to
[45:19] continue on this journey. And I think
[45:21] that we got our commission tonight to
[45:25] bring them in. So let's continue to do
[45:27] that. God bless you, friends. You're
[45:29] dismissed. I pray the Lord will be with
[45:31] you. See you Friday night.
