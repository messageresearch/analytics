[21:03] Hebrews
[21:05] chapter 10 listening to a message called
[21:09] law
[21:10] and brother that was in a portion where
[21:13] brother Brandon was talking about the
[21:14] law and what it took
[21:17] and then brother Daniel asked us to read
[21:19] chapter 15.
[21:22] and right at the beginning those who
[21:23] still wanted the law were trying to
[21:25] force the law back on the Believers so
[21:28] we'll read those verses then said he lo
[21:31] I come to do thy will o God he taketh
[21:34] away the first that he may establish the
[21:37] second
[21:37] by the which we are all which we are
[21:41] Sanctified through the offering of the
[21:42] body of Jesus Christ once for all and
[21:46] every priest had this daily ministering
[21:47] often offering oftentimes the same
[21:50] sacrifice which can never take away the
[21:53] sins
[21:55] this man after he had offered one
[21:57] sacrifice for sins forever sat down on
[21:59] the right hand of God from henceforth
[22:02] expecting till his enemies be made his
[22:04] footstool for by one offering he has
[22:06] perfected forever them that are
[22:08] Sanctified where of the Holy Ghost is
[22:11] also is a witness to us for after that
[22:14] he had said before this is the Covenant
[22:16] that I will make with him after those
[22:19] days saith Lord I will put my laws into
[22:21] their hearts and in their minds will I
[22:24] write them
[22:25] and their sins and iniquity iniquities
[22:28] will I remember no more now where
[22:30] remission of these is there is no more
[22:32] offering for sin having therefore
[22:34] Brethren boldness to enter into the
[22:37] holiest by the blood of Jesus so what a
[22:40] promise and he kept keeps his word amen
[22:45] for it reaches to the highest mountain

[30:12] [Music]
[30:16] strong
[30:18] it shall forever
[30:33] foreign
[30:38] and then the words of that song
[30:41] As We Know
[30:43] there's the main verse of that it was
[30:45] found
[30:46] written on the walls of an insane
[30:48] Institution
[30:49] many years ago they don't know who the
[30:51] author is
[30:52] but they know that whoever that was was
[30:56] certainly inspired to write those words
[30:58] let's pray
[31:00] Lord God we thank you
[31:02] for another opportunity to come together
[31:04] to worship
[31:06] father to sing
[31:09] to to
[31:11] Father get into your word and understand
[31:14] it better
[31:16] I pray Lord that you'd be with us
[31:17] tonight
[31:19] father God my words is I read
[31:22] the words of this book of Acts I pray
[31:25] that The Same Spirit father same
[31:28] anointing
[31:29] that was on the author would be on

[31:36] anoint the ears of the year
[31:38] be with us Lord we pray we love you in
[31:41] Jesus name amen
[31:43] God bless you you can take your seats
[31:52] um
[31:54] again thanks to uh brother Aaron he
[31:57] mentioned that to thank you for the
[31:59] kindness from the Green family
[32:02] um what a nice it was a nice funeral it
[32:05] was uh
[32:06] I thought it was I thought it was
[32:08] interesting that uh sister green always
[32:11] said that she wanted to sing at her own
[32:13] funeral
[32:15] so
[32:16] as as it would have it they they played
[32:20] at the end of service they played a
[32:22] recording of Sister Green singing
[32:25] and I don't know if you noticed
[32:28] but there was a big picture window
[32:31] in the back of the funeral home where
[32:33] the service was
[32:35] and when sister green as soon as she
[32:39] finished singing
[32:41] this giant plane
[32:44] comes down over the Catalina mountains
[32:47] and and dumps this big red
[32:51] slurry fire up on top of the
[32:54] mountain and I thought what a perfect
[32:56] did anybody else see that wasn't that it
[32:59] wasn't that great it was it was and it
[33:01] was right at the end of her song and it
[33:03] came down and I just felt like the Lord
[33:06] turned the mountain red just
[33:09] representing the blood of Jesus Christ
[33:11] and how sister green me she may have
[33:13] gone and brother green may have gone and
[33:16] many of our loved ones may have gone but
[33:17] because of that red blood of Jesus
[33:20] Christ we have the opportunity to see
[33:23] them again one day that that just
[33:26] blessed me when I saw that come down
[33:29] I thought it was a fitting end
[33:32] um
[33:34] after the
[33:37] after the service
[33:39] we had a group pretty much the whole
[33:42] congregation I think that was there came
[33:45] over to the fellowship hall and we had a
[33:48] really nice time a fellowship
[33:51] and I am
[33:53] wild people were fellowshipping I am
[33:58] noticed some people coming in
[34:01] to the door here obviously everyone was
[34:03] out there in the fellowship hall and I
[34:05] noticed some people coming in to the
[34:07] door
[34:08] and I wondered okay what's going on in
[34:12] the sanctuary
[34:13] so I walked in
[34:16] and I saw some of the some of the kids
[34:19] and there was a lot of the family there
[34:21] and I think the the legalist part of me
[34:25] came out a little bit
[34:26] and and I told I told one of the the
[34:30] brothers that was there that was his
[34:31] kids I said I said hey I said I said
[34:35] don't let the kids
[34:37] um be running around the fellowship hall
[34:39] and I was I think I was a little bit I
[34:42] was a little bit too firm I was a little
[34:43] bit too sharp and if any of you know me
[34:47] I know some of the brothers know me that
[34:49] sometimes I can get that way a little
[34:52] bit where I'm just I'm too pointed
[34:55] and when when I did that I could feel
[34:59] that I offended the brother
[35:02] a little bit
[35:04] and uh he was very respectful and he he
[35:09] and his wife gathered up the kids
[35:11] and they they went out in the into the
[35:15] um
[35:15] Fellowship Hall and I wasn't kicking
[35:17] them out I just I wanted control in the
[35:21] sanctuary
[35:22] but like I said I think it came across
[35:24] too strongly
[35:26] and I could feel that I I grieved maybe
[35:29] grieved the spirit a little bit and I I
[35:32] may have offended the brother so
[35:35] and then if you know me you know that I
[35:37] can't think of anything when I've done
[35:39] that I can't think of anything until I
[35:40] want to make it right
[35:42] so
[35:44] finally I tracked him down I went
[35:46] looking for him actually I went outside
[35:48] I was trying to find him right after he
[35:49] left I walked out and I couldn't find
[35:51] him outside I couldn't find him inside I
[35:52] thought man I really messed this one out
[35:55] so but after 30 minutes or so I found it
[36:00] and I walked up to him and I said Hey
[36:02] brother I said I didn't mean to be so so
[36:05] sharp
[36:06] when I said that about the kids I said I
[36:10] just walked in and and um
[36:12] I saw the kids in the in the fellowship
[36:14] hall and I just wanted things to be
[36:16] I just want to keep this holy and quiet
[36:19] in here
[36:20] and he was he was visibly upset about it
[36:26] so we started talking and and I said
[36:29] brother just forgive me for the way that
[36:32] I came across
[36:33] so that's when I said hey why don't you
[36:37] gather up all of your kids all of these
[36:39] these young people and I said let's go
[36:42] upstairs and I'll show you our new room
[36:43] up there and let them play and enjoy
[36:45] themselves so I convinced him to come up
[36:49] and and we went up there and I tried to
[36:52] break the ice a little bit more
[36:54] and uh he said do you still have that
[36:56] Chapel up there Steve do you still do
[36:58] Sunday school up there I said yeah let's
[36:59] go let's go across the hallway so we
[37:02] left the family and the kids up in the
[37:04] upper room and then we walked across the
[37:06] hallway into the chapel
[37:09] and had a conversation with him
[37:13] and uh I said I said again brother I
[37:16] said I'm sorry about this I said I I
[37:20] sometimes I I get a little legalistic in
[37:23] in my life I said but I didn't mean it
[37:26] that way
[37:27] and he said he says you know
[37:30] he said it's okay and he was very very
[37:32] nice to me said it's okay he says he
[37:36] says you know he says
[37:38] I grew up my family grew up here my
[37:40] grandpa brother green was the pastor and
[37:43] and he said you know I just
[37:46] I just wanted the kids to see and I said
[37:48] brother I said I feel terrible and and
[37:51] we talked a little bit more and he said
[37:54] you know he said
[37:56] I have
[37:58] the table on my phone
[38:01] he said I listened to brother Branham a
[38:04] lot he said I love his message
[38:07] and he said
[38:08] but you know he says
[38:11] I think that sometimes what these these
[38:15] ministers teach what these pastors teach
[38:17] isn't what brother Branham taught
[38:20] and I said well brother I think now
[38:22] you're preaching my message
[38:24] and he says he says well he says he says
[38:27] it's true he says that they teach all of
[38:29] these different doctrines and he says I
[38:31] listen to these tapes and he says I
[38:32] don't see
[38:33] what they're teaching here
[38:37] and
[38:38] we had a really nice conversation so as
[38:43] always I think the Lord can take our
[38:45] failures and then he can turn them
[38:47] around and make it a blessing
[38:49] so it was really nice meeting him is
[38:52] very very nice brother it's Andrew is
[38:55] his name you probably all know him I
[38:57] didn't know him Andrew Green but a very
[39:00] very nice brother and just really
[39:02] impressed me impressed me in his
[39:04] knowledge of the word and of the
[39:05] scriptures he's very active in his
[39:08] church and if you were at the funeral
[39:10] wow can he sing
[39:12] amazing voice very very talented
[39:15] talented brother
[39:17] so we had this conversation and and as I
[39:21] was praying about it
[39:23] yesterday evening and this morning I got
[39:26] to thinking you know what this is
[39:27] exactly what I'm going to teach on on
[39:30] Wednesday night that's exactly what I'm
[39:32] going to teach on tonight is Acts
[39:34] chapter 15 and it's the same principles
[39:37] as what happened
[39:40] in the church yesterday with me and it's
[39:43] the same principles as what this brother
[39:46] was telling me that he was struggling
[39:49] with
[39:50] so let's turn
[39:52] to act let's start with Acts Chapter 14
[39:54] verse 26 so so we can get an idea of
[39:57] what's going on here
[40:01] so this is Paul
[40:03] for those of of uh of you that uh
[40:08] Cynthia God bless you it's it's good to
[40:11] see you see your brother Joe it's good
[40:13] to see you Cynthia thanks thanks for
[40:15] coming what we're doing is we're
[40:16] teaching on the book of Acts we started
[40:19] weeks and weeks ago and and uh we we've
[40:22] gone through how the day at Pentecost
[40:24] how they received the Holy Spirit all
[40:26] the way up until now this Acts chapter
[40:28] 15 and what's happened is we see that
[40:31] Jesus died he rose up from the dead he
[40:36] promised that he was going to send his
[40:38] Spirit upon his disciples and he leaves
[40:42] he ascends up into heaven and he sends
[40:45] his holy spirit down to the disciples in
[40:49] what was called the day of Pentecost
[40:52] then they started doing the exact same
[40:56] thing that Jesus did when he was here so
[40:58] you look at the gospels Matthew Mark
[41:00] Luke and John you see everything that
[41:02] Jesus did during that time now you see
[41:04] the book of Acts and the the disciples
[41:07] are now doing what Jesus did
[41:10] previously in the in the four gospels so
[41:12] that's what the book of Acts is it's
[41:14] basically Jesus A continuing
[41:17] continuation of Jesus's Ministry in now
[41:21] not in Jesus but in the disciples so the
[41:25] spirit of Jesus in the disciples there
[41:27] you have the book of Acts in short so
[41:29] now we're in chapter 15 where we're
[41:31] going to start in 14.
[41:33] So what had happened is they had just
[41:35] gone on their first missionary trip
[41:37] and they came back Paul and this man
[41:39] named Barnabas
[41:42] and then they sailed to Antioch from
[41:44] whence they had been recommended to the
[41:46] grace of God for the work which they
[41:48] fulfilled and when they were come they
[41:50] had gathered the church together they
[41:53] rehearsed all that God had done with
[41:55] them and how he had opened the door of
[41:57] Faith unto the Gentiles and there they
[42:01] Abode long time with the disciples now
[42:03] right here we have two different groups
[42:05] of people for those just getting started
[42:07] in the book of Acts we have the Hebrews
[42:09] who for thousands of years have been
[42:12] considered God's people and we have this
[42:15] other group these new Believers that the
[42:18] Hebrews kind of shunned for all these
[42:20] years but now things are changing and
[42:23] God wants these Jews to start accepting
[42:27] these new believers
[42:29] and that's when we see the message
[42:32] starting to go to the Gentiles
[42:36] chapter
[42:38] 15.
[42:39] verse 1.
[42:41] so they had come back to Antioch
[42:46] and certain men
[42:49] which came down from Judea
[42:52] taught the Brethren and said except ye
[42:54] be circumcised after the manner of Moses
[42:57] you cannot be saved
[43:00] so we have Paul and and Barnabas and the
[43:03] brothers they're going out and they're
[43:04] spreading the gospel they're doing
[43:05] Miracles they're doing doing all these
[43:07] things and they come back home come back
[43:10] to their home base in Antioch and then
[43:13] they see that while they were gone
[43:16] these people had come from Judea
[43:19] probably from Jerusalem they came and
[43:22] they started telling the people these
[43:25] new converts that unless you're
[43:28] circumcised which is from the law of
[43:30] Moses you can't be saved
[43:34] now
[43:37] you think well circumcision back then
[43:40] how important was that well let's turn
[43:44] to Genesis chapter 17 first circumcision
[43:48] was a covenant that God made between him
[43:52] and his prophet Abraham
[43:56] Genesis chapter 17 verse 10. now let me
[43:59] show you how important that this
[44:01] Covenant was
[44:02] this is my Covenant
[44:05] God speaking this is my Covenant which
[44:07] you shall keep between me and you and
[44:10] thy seed after thee every man child
[44:13] among you shall be circumcised
[44:16] and ye shall circumcise the Flesh of
[44:18] your foreskin and it shall be a token of
[44:21] the Covenant
[44:22] betwixt me and you
[44:25] and he that is eight days old shall be
[44:27] circumcised among you every man child in
[44:30] your Generations he that is born in the
[44:32] house or brought or bought with money of
[44:35] any stranger which is not of thy seed so
[44:38] anyone that you even a slave or anyone a
[44:41] prosely anyone that you bring into the
[44:43] fold also has to be circumcised not only
[44:45] your children
[44:49] and ye shall circumcise let's see which
[44:52] is not of thy seed he that is born in
[44:54] thy house and he that is bought with thy
[44:57] money must needs be circumcised and my
[45:00] Covenant shall be in your flesh for an
[45:02] Everlasting Covenant and the
[45:03] uncircumcised Man Child whose flesh of
[45:06] his foreskin is not circumcised that
[45:08] Soul shall be cut off from his people he
[45:12] has broken my Covenant
[45:14] powerful powerful statement that God
[45:18] gives to his prophet and this statement
[45:20] this Covenant between man and God went
[45:25] on for thousands of years
[45:29] so now these two brothers come down
[45:32] from Judea
[45:34] the church at Jerusalem probably
[45:37] they come down
[45:39] and they come down to this group of
[45:42] Greek speaking Jews and Gentiles all
[45:46] mixed together in Antioch and while Paul
[45:49] is gone
[45:51] they start preaching hey you're wrong
[45:56] here is what the prophet said you need
[46:01] to be circumcised according to this word
[46:05] now
[46:07] I want all of us to think
[46:09] where would you have been on the side of
[46:12] this argument
[46:13] before I read the next verse
[46:16] where would you have been where would I
[46:19] have been
[46:21] uh in this argument
[46:25] think about it
[46:26] would I stand with the prophet Abraham
[46:30] would I stand with the prophet Moses who
[46:34] brought these laws
[46:36] or
[46:38] this guy Paul
[46:41] where did he come from
[46:43] you know number one he was persecuting
[46:44] the Christians now all of a sudden he's
[46:47] he's this big guy and he's going out and
[46:50] he's preaching Jesus to all these people
[46:51] and and who is he
[46:55] to say that this isn't important
[46:59] very very
[47:00] put yourself in the spot where would you
[47:03] stand brother and where would I stand
[47:08] and this happens all the time
[47:10] this type of thing by the way before I
[47:12] get to the next verse
[47:14] how many times do you see someone come
[47:17] into a church
[47:20] there was a two brothers from Canada you
[47:22] probably know him
[47:24] um
[47:25] I know him fairly well
[47:27] they uh they came and they made their
[47:29] rounds
[47:30] in the United States
[47:32] did they come here
[47:34] they did okay their buddies of mine
[47:38] I know
[47:41] anyways for those of you you don't know
[47:43] what I'm talking about what they would
[47:45] do is they would come into a church and
[47:47] they would start heckling the women
[47:50] saying oh your your hair is your your
[47:52] skirts not long enough your heels are
[47:54] too high you're and they find everything
[47:56] that they could find wrong with the
[47:59] women and with the men
[48:01] and I sat across from these brothers
[48:04] discussing this and I was like brothers
[48:06] where are you getting all of this and
[48:08] they would go and they'd take one quote
[48:10] over here and one quote over here and
[48:11] they put it together and they'd make
[48:13] this Doctrine
[48:14] and then they would go from church to
[48:16] church heckling people and causing
[48:19] problems
[48:21] and just wanting basically to pull the
[48:23] people away from their Church
[48:26] many of us are familiar with these two
[48:28] brothers but there's also that Spirit
[48:30] isn't just in the extreme like those two
[48:32] brothers
[48:33] but that spirit is all over the place
[48:37] and we see that this is what happened in
[48:40] this church and these people these two
[48:42] brothers were probably very respected
[48:44] Brothers they obviously knew the word
[48:46] well and they came in and what they did
[48:49] is they caused trouble
[48:51] now remember
[48:53] Paul was going through do you remember
[48:56] the area he was going through from the
[48:58] previous
[48:59] galatia
[49:01] so if you look in the book of Galatians
[49:03] Paul addresses this I believe it's in
[49:06] Galatians chapter one and he calls them
[49:08] troublemakers
[49:10] referring to these brothers right here
[49:17] verse number two
[49:20] when therefore Paul and Barnabas
[49:22] had no small
[49:24] dissension and disputation with them
[49:29] they were preaching circumcision
[49:33] exactly what is in the Bible given to
[49:36] Abraham preached by Moses one of the
[49:39] laws
[49:40] preaching these things
[49:44] there's no small dissension and
[49:46] disputation with them they determined
[49:48] now this is the group at Antioch they
[49:51] determined this caused a problem it's
[49:53] like well we need some answers here that
[49:55] Paul and bartimus and certain other of
[49:58] them should go up to Jerusalem unto the
[50:00] apostles and Elders about this question
[50:04] so it's like
[50:06] Paul and Barnabas we love you
[50:09] but we need an answer maybe from the
[50:13] ones that were so respected like maybe
[50:17] Peter
[50:18] maybe John
[50:20] these ones maybe James these ones that
[50:22] walked with Jesus
[50:25] Paul
[50:26] all right
[50:28] we'll go
[50:32] so
[50:33] we have to realize
[50:36] that when Paul was was telling these
[50:39] Brethren like
[50:41] no you don't have to be circumcised you
[50:43] don't have to you don't have to go
[50:45] through all of these laws and all of
[50:46] this stuff Paul was not preaching
[50:47] against the law
[50:49] Paul was not saying that the law is
[50:52] wrong
[50:53] if you look Beyond this chapter you see
[50:56] that Paul very much his whole life
[50:59] honored the Jewish principles and the
[51:02] Jewish traditions and the Jewish law
[51:05] he never varied from it we see later on
[51:08] that brother Lyle or I one of us will
[51:10] get to that Paul wanted to get back to
[51:12] Jerusalem to honor the feast day
[51:15] to be there so he can observe this this
[51:19] Feast this Jewish tradition that I
[51:21] guarantee you Paul still believed that
[51:23] was right but with these new converts he
[51:25] says no
[51:27] he says you don't have to do this
[51:31] so whose side would I have been on
[51:34] at this at this moment
[51:37] I mentioned the legalism nature
[51:40] sometimes that I have
[51:42] I think Brother Andy I think I know
[51:44] where I would have been
[51:46] in this specific place
[51:49] I think I may have been on the wrong
[51:50] side
[51:52] but thank God we have this word recorded
[51:54] here
[51:57] and being brought on their way
[51:59] by the church they passed through
[52:01] phenicia and Samaria
[52:03] declaring the conversion of the Gentiles
[52:05] and they cause great joy unto all the
[52:08] Brethren so they stopped in these these
[52:11] different spots and everyone rejoiced
[52:13] that they had so many conversions and so
[52:15] many baptism and the Lord was was doing
[52:17] so much and the church was growing and
[52:20] everyone was just rejoicing and then
[52:22] they came to Jerusalem
[52:26] and when they were come to Jerusalem
[52:29] they were received of the church
[52:31] and of the Apostles and elders and they
[52:34] declared all things that God had done
[52:36] with them
[52:38] but there rose up certain of the sect of
[52:40] the Pharisees which believed very very
[52:44] important part of that scripture these
[52:47] are not the Pharisees like you think
[52:48] that crucified Jesus these are the
[52:51] Pharisees these are the ministers that
[52:54] had given their hearts to Jesus Christ
[52:57] these are the ones that have they were
[53:00] they were ministers before they saw that
[53:03] this man Christ this man Peter this man
[53:06] John this man James these brothers are
[53:09] right in their Doctrine this man Jesus
[53:12] fulfills the the Prophecies of this
[53:15] Messiah
[53:16] so these are real Believers Minister
[53:18] brethren
[53:21] and they said
[53:23] that it was needful to them
[53:26] it was needful to circumcise them these
[53:28] are the new believers
[53:30] and to command them to keep the law of
[53:32] Moses
[53:36] now
[53:37] of course these Pharisees believe in
[53:41] grace
[53:42] you can't believe in Jesus
[53:44] and not believe in grace you can't
[53:47] believe in Christ and not accept the
[53:50] sacrifice that Jesus made for us so
[53:53] these Pharisees knew but they were they
[53:56] were caught up
[53:58] in in their traditions and their way of
[54:00] thinking
[54:01] and the apostles and Elders came
[54:03] together
[54:04] for to consider of this matter
[54:07] and when there had been much disputing
[54:10] so they had all the brothers together
[54:12] maybe in the church
[54:13] now this is the church this is the First
[54:17] Christian Church in the whole world that
[54:20] they're at in Jerusalem
[54:22] thousands probably a people
[54:24] that were members of this church
[54:28] and when they had been much disputing
[54:30] Peter rose up and said unto them
[54:32] men and Brethren now remember Peter is a
[54:34] very respected man
[54:36] and brethren
[54:37] you know how that a good while ago God
[54:42] made a choice Among Us that the Gentiles
[54:45] by my mouth
[54:46] should hear the word of the gospel and
[54:49] believe now do you know what he was
[54:50] referring to
[54:52] you guys remember what was it what was
[54:54] the man's name
[54:55] Cornelius right so what happened in this
[54:58] he's referring to a couple chapters back
[55:00] I think it was Acts 10. he was
[55:03] referring to when this man Cornelius an
[55:06] angel comes and visits this this uh I
[55:09] believe he's a centurionist soldier
[55:11] Cornelius and tells him that this man
[55:14] Peter has the truth for him and to send
[55:17] people to go get Peter and to bring him
[55:19] back Peter was up on the housetop
[55:21] praying Peter sees a vision down comes
[55:25] all of these unclean animals
[55:28] that Peter would never eat as a Jew they
[55:31] were against the law
[55:32] to eat them
[55:34] you know what they are can anybody say I
[55:36] want any of them are
[55:38] what
[55:39] a pig a pig because it doesn't chew its
[55:42] cup it's cud but it has a cloven hoof
[55:44] you can eat it if it has a cloven hoof
[55:46] and choose its cut
[55:48] fish
[55:50] rabbits because it chews its cut and
[55:53] doesn't have a cloven hoof uh there's a
[55:55] bunch of them that you can't eat so all
[55:57] of these come down and Peter is hungry
[56:02] and
[56:03] the Lord tells him rise up Peter he says
[56:07] kill these animals and eat them and
[56:09] Peter's like not me
[56:13] because I'm a Jew
[56:14] I don't I don't need anything like that
[56:17] um I'm kosher
[56:20] and uh
[56:22] then the Lord tells him why have you
[56:24] made unclean
[56:25] what I have made clean
[56:28] so Peter
[56:30] it's like wow what
[56:33] then there's a knock at the door
[56:35] and there is this Gentile
[56:38] saying come
[56:40] to my Master's house
[56:43] and tell us about the Lord
[56:46] so Peter goes and he goes to the
[56:47] cornelius's house he preaches Jesus
[56:50] Christ they accept him and we see a
[56:53] conversion of a gentile right here so
[56:56] that's what he's referring to here when
[56:58] he says by my mouth
[57:00] the first one should hear the word of
[57:02] the gospel and believe
[57:05] and God which knoweth the hearts bear
[57:07] them witness giving them the Holy Ghost
[57:10] even as he did unto us and put no
[57:13] difference between us and Them purifying
[57:16] their hearts by faith
[57:19] amazing
[57:20] so he's saying that God filled
[57:23] these unclean they used to call them
[57:25] heathens these these people that didn't
[57:27] believe the message before they come in
[57:31] and those that have believed their whole
[57:33] lives and have lived the message and
[57:36] done their best and lived lived a life
[57:40] Worthy
[57:43] the Holy Spirit does the same thing to
[57:45] both of them
[57:46] you have somebody that knows nothing
[57:48] about the message then you have somebody
[57:50] that knows everything about the message
[57:52] and wow they received the same thing
[57:57] it's amazing he's saying that God is Not
[58:00] exclusive to any denomination or any
[58:02] group as long as there's Jesus Christ
[58:05] there
[58:07] now therefore why tempt ye God
[58:10] to put a yoke upon the neck of the
[58:12] disciples which neither our fathers nor
[58:15] we were able to bear
[58:19] now remember there's a difference as I
[58:21] said right when we started this series I
[58:24] said that there's a difference between a
[58:26] disciple and an apostle
[58:29] an apostle would be one that sent out to
[58:32] spread the gospel a disciple is one that
[58:35] has received the gospel and now believes
[58:38] Jesus Christ so we are all disciples I'm
[58:42] a disciple you're a disciple all of us
[58:44] are Disciples of Christ
[58:50] let me read that again now therefore why
[58:52] tempt you God to put a yoke upon the
[58:54] neck of the disciples which neither our
[58:57] fathers nor we were able to bear so he's
[58:59] saying that these people have have
[59:01] accepted Christ but now you're saying
[59:04] that they have to live up to all these
[59:06] Commandments I'm not talking about just
[59:08] the ten there's like 600 more
[59:11] in Leviticus and and and exodus and
[59:15] Deuteronomy there there's all of these
[59:17] Commandments literally it's over 600.
[59:20] and they take these and then they twist
[59:22] them and they they they they fight over
[59:25] how they're supposed to be implemented
[59:27] and all this and you get this big
[59:29] conglomeration this big mess of a
[59:32] religion and all it is is about legalism
[59:34] it's washing dishes a certain way
[59:36] special diet sacrificing in a certain
[59:39] way special clothing with tassels woven
[59:42] in a certain way not eating as as we
[59:44] said catfish and pork and rabbits and
[59:47] and
[59:48] I don't want to get too too far into it
[59:50] but not having a television not watching
[59:51] movies I hear a certain length choose a
[59:54] certain size skirts a certain League
[59:55] Church three times a week all of these
[59:58] different these different
[1:00:00] um
[1:00:01] ordinances
[1:00:04] and he's saying here Peter's saying but
[1:00:07] you still sinned
[1:00:09] but you still have failed he's not
[1:00:12] saying that any of those things are
[1:00:13] wrong
[1:00:15] he's not saying that that Holiness is
[1:00:18] wrong by any means he's not saying that
[1:00:20] but he's saying but it was incomplete
[1:00:23] without the blood of Christ
[1:00:29] I think it's in the I think it's in uh
[1:00:34] I forgot where it was in Romans I think
[1:00:36] it is he says
[1:00:37] he talks about
[1:00:39] the grace of God and he says but then do
[1:00:42] I sin that Grace May abound he says God
[1:00:45] forbid I won't do that
[1:00:48] yet because
[1:00:52] when we see that Peter is saying that
[1:00:53] this failed and he says you weren't even
[1:00:56] able to live up to this
[1:00:58] he says your ancestors were your parents
[1:01:00] weren't your grandparents were all the
[1:01:03] way back to Adam you weren't able to
[1:01:04] live up to these to these ordinances and
[1:01:07] now you want to place it place this on
[1:01:09] these people
[1:01:11] and you want to make them live up to
[1:01:13] this
[1:01:14] when you couldn't do it
[1:01:16] talking about these men that came in
[1:01:18] there to galatia to Antioch
[1:01:23] and what good did it do
[1:01:25] you know what good and I I look at look
[1:01:28] at my life and I I think about and I
[1:01:31] still I still do my best to live a very
[1:01:34] legalistic life
[1:01:35] I do my best to toe the line
[1:01:40] you know and I know sometimes I don't
[1:01:42] talk like it but I haven't had a TV in
[1:01:45] decades
[1:01:47] you know I don't go to see movies I
[1:01:49] don't do I don't do any of those things
[1:01:52] but what good that's just me doing my
[1:01:56] best to serve the Lord that's me doing
[1:01:59] my best to live a holy life before the
[1:02:03] Lord works
[1:02:05] Grace is what God did for me works are
[1:02:08] what I do for him
[1:02:10] but
[1:02:11] I look back even at my life
[1:02:15] and the way that I live just in Daniel's
[1:02:18] a witness how we lived as just as close
[1:02:21] as I could as perfect as I could to all
[1:02:25] of these different doctrines and I think
[1:02:27] what
[1:02:29] where did I ever
[1:02:31] through my doctrines
[1:02:34] through my legalism where did I ever
[1:02:35] lead someone to Christ
[1:02:38] never
[1:02:41] and very seldom
[1:02:44] has it happened
[1:02:47] and here we see that very question
[1:02:53] instead of all of these things
[1:02:56] Peter here saying salvation can't be
[1:02:58] found in anything except Christ
[1:03:03] but we believe
[1:03:05] that through the grace of the Lord Jesus
[1:03:07] Christ we shall be saved even as they
[1:03:14] and then all the multitude kept silent
[1:03:17] and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul
[1:03:21] declaring What miracles and wonders God
[1:03:24] had wrought among the Gentiles by them
[1:03:28] what if this had been an intellectual
[1:03:29] gospel
[1:03:31] what if this would have just been
[1:03:34] someone who goes and they can just open
[1:03:36] the scriptures and explain it
[1:03:39] but the supernatural followed this
[1:03:43] ministry that's why I believe that we
[1:03:45] must have that Supernatural following
[1:03:48] our Ministries
[1:03:50] it needs to be there it shows that God
[1:03:54] is with us
[1:03:58] because there were miracles
[1:04:00] and there were new conversions and there
[1:04:03] were baptisms and the body was growing
[1:04:05] they received Paul and Barnabas with
[1:04:08] respect
[1:04:11] and after they had held their peace
[1:04:13] James answering said men and Brethren
[1:04:16] hearken unto me
[1:04:18] do you know who this James guy is
[1:04:20] is very very important
[1:04:22] this isn't you know you read in the
[1:04:24] gospels Peter James and John
[1:04:27] this isn't John's brother James he was
[1:04:31] killed earlier in the book of Acts this
[1:04:35] is Jesus's brother his not his real
[1:04:38] brother but Jesus's brother James his
[1:04:42] foster brother I guess we could call him
[1:04:44] James was also the pastor
[1:04:48] of the church at Jerusalem
[1:04:51] very important man
[1:04:54] but Andy I had a question for you so if
[1:04:57] James was the pastor of this church in
[1:05:00] Jerusalem he was the first pastor
[1:05:04] how could Catholicism say that Peter was
[1:05:07] the first
[1:05:08] one
[1:05:10] doesn't make sense
[1:05:12] it's a it's a flaw it's a fatal flaw
[1:05:15] saying that that this Peter was the
[1:05:17] first leader he wasn't yes he had the
[1:05:19] Keys of the Kingdom but this man James
[1:05:22] was the pastor of the church
[1:05:27] so these brothers
[1:05:29] they they weighed in on on the
[1:05:33] circumcision and the other things Paul
[1:05:36] and Peter weighed in their side
[1:05:42] now we see James
[1:05:46] and he weighs in and he had a lot of
[1:05:49] authority
[1:05:52] James says this
[1:05:55] James answered and said men and brother
[1:05:57] and hearken unto me Simeon hath declared
[1:05:59] how God at the first did visit the
[1:06:01] Gentiles to take
[1:06:03] out of them a people for his name
[1:06:06] not for his name now Simeon
[1:06:08] in other words for Simeon is Simon
[1:06:11] Simon is actually Peter
[1:06:14] so he's quoting Peter but he's using
[1:06:17] Brother lilies Jewish name
[1:06:19] because it's directing it to a bunch of
[1:06:24] the the Jews the original Believers here
[1:06:31] and you know I just one thing it's one
[1:06:35] of the reasons I just
[1:06:36] I love
[1:06:38] I love this Bible so much I like to look
[1:06:41] at the past
[1:06:43] in the Bible the Bible it shows the
[1:06:47] purpose in a lot of these things even
[1:06:49] the language that was written in
[1:06:51] you see Matthew Mark and Luke and John
[1:06:54] and acts and Romans and first and second
[1:06:56] Corinthians all the way to Second
[1:06:58] Timothy it's written in the language of
[1:07:01] Greek
[1:07:02] not Hebrew
[1:07:04] if it was written to the Jews it would
[1:07:07] have been written in their language
[1:07:10] but it was written in a language and
[1:07:13] then the Romans and the Greeks they
[1:07:14] wouldn't have understood probably Hebrew
[1:07:16] but they spoke this language Greek so
[1:07:19] this Bible this new testament was mostly
[1:07:23] written in that language so that these
[1:07:25] new Believers would understand
[1:07:28] look at the focus look at look at the
[1:07:30] emphasis that's put on the new believers
[1:07:33] even in the very language that it was
[1:07:35] written in
[1:07:37] then if then we see the book of Hebrews
[1:07:39] and you can remember
[1:07:41] because it's named Hebrews
[1:07:44] that was written more to the Jewish
[1:07:47] people and that original language was
[1:07:50] Hebrew or Aramaic the that that language
[1:07:57] back to James back to James speaking
[1:08:00] and to disagree the words of the Prophet
[1:08:03] as it is written
[1:08:04] after this I will return and will build
[1:08:07] again the Tabernacle of David which has
[1:08:10] fallen down and I will build again the
[1:08:12] ruins thereof and I will set it up so
[1:08:15] he's referring back
[1:08:17] to the prophecy of a man named Amos
[1:08:20] a prophet
[1:08:22] that the residue of men might seek after
[1:08:25] the Lord and all the Gentiles upon whom
[1:08:28] my name is called saith the Lord who
[1:08:31] doeth all these things so he's quoting
[1:08:33] the prophets and he's saying that the
[1:08:35] prophets
[1:08:36] are not saying that they have to be
[1:08:38] converted to the Jewish message
[1:08:41] before they come to Christ
[1:08:44] he's saying that they have to be
[1:08:45] converted to Christ he's saying that
[1:08:47] there's not a step between between an a
[1:08:52] new a new person that may not know
[1:08:54] anything about Jesus
[1:08:55] and Jesus you don't have to go through
[1:08:58] Judaism brother Lyle you don't have to
[1:09:00] go through the Hebrew
[1:09:02] you don't have to go through all the
[1:09:04] laws you can just go straight to Christ
[1:09:06] there's a parable it just comes to mind
[1:09:09] there's a parable that these laborers
[1:09:11] are out in the field
[1:09:13] and they've been they've been working
[1:09:15] and they make a deal they one comes in
[1:09:17] the morning he makes a deal with with
[1:09:20] the owner of of the um the farm or
[1:09:22] whatever it was and it says I'll give
[1:09:24] you this much so they go out and work
[1:09:26] they work all day then he hires some
[1:09:28] right at noon time working half the day
[1:09:31] they come out they they go working and
[1:09:34] then right before quitting time
[1:09:36] he hires this other this other guy
[1:09:40] and then at the end he pays them all the
[1:09:43] same
[1:09:45] and he and they said well how come we
[1:09:47] worked all day and this guy gets the
[1:09:48] same pay as us and he says I gave you
[1:09:50] exactly what we agreed to
[1:09:53] and that's the same here is you don't
[1:09:55] have to go through all of these
[1:09:57] different
[1:09:59] roads to get to Christ
[1:10:02] like the Jews did you can just go
[1:10:04] straight to him
[1:10:05] so a new believer doesn't have to
[1:10:08] conform to all these things that comes
[1:10:10] later
[1:10:12] that new believer you can go straight to
[1:10:13] Christ and you're there
[1:10:15] you're already home run out of the park
[1:10:18] you made it
[1:10:20] now if you love God now you can start to
[1:10:24] implement these things in your life
[1:10:30] where am I at verse 17. I just read it
[1:10:33] I'll read it read it again that the
[1:10:34] residue of men might seek after the Lord
[1:10:36] and all the Gentiles upon whom my name
[1:10:38] is called saith the Lord who doeth all
[1:10:41] these things known unto God are all his
[1:10:44] works from the beginning of the world
[1:10:47] God knows it all
[1:10:49] he knows what's going on he knows where
[1:10:52] you were born he knows where you're
[1:10:54] going to die he knows Genesis to
[1:10:57] Revelation he knows the beginning to the
[1:11:00] end
[1:11:02] now James says here now we see the
[1:11:05] authority that's in this man James
[1:11:08] were for my sentences my decision is
[1:11:12] this
[1:11:13] that we trouble not them which from
[1:11:16] among the Gentiles are turned to God
[1:11:22] he says
[1:11:23] James is saying don't trouble them
[1:11:27] don't don't trouble these new Believers
[1:11:29] with all all of these rules and and all
[1:11:31] these regulations and and all the way
[1:11:33] you eat and circumcision all that he
[1:11:36] says don't trouble them but he doesn't
[1:11:39] doesn't say us brother Paul
[1:11:42] he doesn't say that we
[1:11:45] have that that we the Jews
[1:11:51] and I'm not saying that we are but
[1:11:52] speaking back in the book of Acts he
[1:11:55] doesn't say
[1:11:57] that
[1:11:58] Paul should change
[1:12:00] he doesn't say that Peter should change
[1:12:02] he doesn't say that they should start
[1:12:04] living like the Gentiles do
[1:12:07] he says he's talking to them he's
[1:12:09] talking to the Gentiles
[1:12:12] now this is really neat
[1:12:16] but that we write unto them
[1:12:19] so he's going to write a letter and it's
[1:12:22] it's really this is really amazing
[1:12:24] because you get a letter inside
[1:12:28] of This Book of Acts so you know the
[1:12:31] Epistles that we have first and second
[1:12:33] Timothy and Titus and and uh first and
[1:12:36] second Corinthians all those we have an
[1:12:38] epistle inside the book of Acts
[1:12:41] and it says this
[1:12:43] but we write unto them that they abstain
[1:12:45] from pollutions of idols
[1:12:48] and from fornication and from things
[1:12:51] strangled and from blood
[1:12:53] so he's telling the new converts to stay
[1:12:56] away from eating things that were
[1:12:58] sacrificed to Idols in other places Paul
[1:13:02] Paul says hey don't worry about it but
[1:13:05] don't offend anyone
[1:13:07] but here James is saying that this is a
[1:13:10] really big deal
[1:13:12] to the Jewish Believers so do your best
[1:13:14] to stay away from those things
[1:13:18] and these new converts they may have
[1:13:21] been brought up by their families and
[1:13:24] with certain values that that may not
[1:13:27] have lined up now he's he's talking
[1:13:30] about things strangled and from the
[1:13:32] blood and and from
[1:13:34] um things sacrificed to Idols but then
[1:13:36] he says and stay away from fornication
[1:13:39] and some of these Greeks and these
[1:13:42] Gentiles may have been brought up that
[1:13:44] that oh it's okay to go out and run
[1:13:47] around before you're married but this
[1:13:49] was a very very important thing to tell
[1:13:52] all of the children not just the Jewish
[1:13:56] ones but all of them hey
[1:13:58] don't do this before you're married
[1:14:00] it'll cause all kinds of problems
[1:14:06] he says from things strangled again this
[1:14:09] was a pagan ritual these animals were
[1:14:12] sacrificed on Pagan altars and then they
[1:14:14] were sold for food
[1:14:16] and the same thing with the blood some
[1:14:18] of the cultures would eat blood or add
[1:14:20] blood to certain dishes and this was an
[1:14:23] offense to Jewish people
[1:14:25] so basically with the Jews everything
[1:14:27] had to be bled out
[1:14:30] before it was kosher before you could
[1:14:32] eat it
[1:14:33] so he's saying here that these things
[1:14:36] are especially offensive
[1:14:38] so don't do these things even though you
[1:14:42] might feel you might not feel condemned
[1:14:44] by it but those long time Believers that
[1:14:49] will offend them
[1:14:51] so now we have two ways going back here
[1:14:53] back and forth we see that that Paul is
[1:14:57] saying to those longtime Believers he
[1:15:00] said he's saying hey have some Grace
[1:15:01] have some patience with these people
[1:15:03] don't worry about it if they're not
[1:15:06] living up to all of these these things
[1:15:08] that that you set forth now don't you
[1:15:10] backslide
[1:15:12] he says but but respect them in the way
[1:15:15] they were raised and just don't do these
[1:15:20] certain things and then on the other
[1:15:21] side for the new Believers he's saying
[1:15:24] hey and you respect
[1:15:28] these long time Believers respect their
[1:15:31] thoughts respect how they act two
[1:15:34] there's a mutual respect in this letter
[1:15:37] written by James
[1:15:38] both sides I love that that's a
[1:15:42] Christian way you know we see
[1:15:45] so often
[1:15:46] we see the more rebellious say you can't
[1:15:50] tell me what to do we know
[1:15:52] I know
[1:15:53] that's that's not the point
[1:15:57] you know so so there's that sometimes
[1:15:58] that disrespect but then there's the
[1:16:01] disrespect of of the like our friends
[1:16:05] from Canada oh you're looking like this
[1:16:07] you see all this girl's dressed and you
[1:16:09] know all of that oh did you see this guy
[1:16:11] you know he's out there swimming in a
[1:16:13] pair of shorts you know you know and
[1:16:15] then going on that
[1:16:18] and Paul or James here is saying respect
[1:16:22] each other
[1:16:25] James continues on and he says for Moses
[1:16:28] of old time hath in every city them that
[1:16:30] preach him being read in the synagogues
[1:16:33] every Sabbath day so so he's saying hey
[1:16:36] Moses is still a prophet he's still
[1:16:38] being preached in the churches that
[1:16:41] shouldn't be forgotten he has a prophet
[1:16:44] after all don't forget what he said
[1:16:47] but then we've taken that and made as I
[1:16:51] said like 600 of all of these rituals
[1:16:55] and stuff that
[1:16:57] they didn't do anything
[1:16:59] they really didn't accomplish anything
[1:17:03] so they write this letter then it
[1:17:05] pleased then well that's what James said
[1:17:08] we should write a letter that says this
[1:17:10] then it pleased then pleased at the
[1:17:12] apostles and the elders with the whole
[1:17:14] church to send chosen men of their own
[1:17:17] company to Antioch with Paul and
[1:17:20] Barnabas namely Judas surname barsabis
[1:17:24] and Silas Chief men among the brethren
[1:17:30] another masterful decision by James
[1:17:34] so maybe they wouldn't
[1:17:37] let's say by the end of you and me are
[1:17:39] Barnabas or Silas and or were Barnabas
[1:17:43] and Paul and we come back to the church
[1:17:45] and we're preaching the same thing that
[1:17:48] we were before they might not believe us
[1:17:50] but instead they sent two
[1:17:52] representatives from the church that
[1:17:54] people knew
[1:17:56] to go with them this man Judas of course
[1:17:58] not is cared as another man named Judas
[1:18:01] and Silas Chief men among the brethren
[1:18:06] and they wrote Letters by them after
[1:18:09] this manner the apostles and the elders
[1:18:12] and the Brethren sin greetings so here's
[1:18:13] the letter
[1:18:15] the apostles and the elders and the
[1:18:17] brother and sin greeting unto the
[1:18:19] Brethren which are of the Gentiles in
[1:18:22] Antioch and Syria and Celestia
[1:18:26] for as much as we have heard that
[1:18:29] certain which went out from us have
[1:18:31] troubled you with words
[1:18:33] so these Brethren came from this church
[1:18:37] and they said we're from the Tucson
[1:18:40] Tabernacle
[1:18:42] and
[1:18:43] our pastor says this and this and this
[1:18:47] or we come from the thing that would bug
[1:18:52] me so much is when the Brethren would
[1:18:55] come from Jeffersonville
[1:18:57] when I was back there they'd go all over
[1:18:59] the world
[1:19:00] and they say we're from Jeffersonville
[1:19:02] and here's how you should do things and
[1:19:04] and here's what brother Branham said and
[1:19:07] here's here's uh here's what brother
[1:19:09] Joseph's teaching and and all this let
[1:19:12] me tell you we can all speak for
[1:19:14] ourselves
[1:19:16] brother Branham there's 1200 tapes
[1:19:19] and they're really good
[1:19:22] if you want to know what brother Branham
[1:19:25] said listen to him
[1:19:28] you don't need me to interpret it to you
[1:19:32] it's he spoke good English
[1:19:36] spoke very understandable English
[1:19:38] if you want to hear what he said listen
[1:19:41] to him and the same goes from rep
[1:19:44] representing Brother Joseph or
[1:19:46] representing brother Biscoe or any of
[1:19:48] these other men of God let them speak
[1:19:50] for themselves they don't need us
[1:19:52] talking for them it causes problems and
[1:19:56] I've seen it so often these problems
[1:19:58] people come in they stir up the people
[1:20:01] and they'll come into a church
[1:20:03] cause all these problems the churches
[1:20:06] will split and I have all these problems
[1:20:07] because they're representing somebody
[1:20:09] else
[1:20:11] if you want to know what I'm saying
[1:20:14] listen to me
[1:20:15] go on tucsontabernacle.com I'm I'm there
[1:20:19] a couple times a week
[1:20:21] if you want to hear what brother Branham
[1:20:23] says listen to him
[1:20:25] don't take someone else's word for it
[1:20:28] because there's always an agenda there
[1:20:32] and that's why we see all of these
[1:20:34] problems that's why brother Brandon when
[1:20:37] he was preaching
[1:20:38] he said refer back to these tapes and if
[1:20:42] you'll listen to that quote he was
[1:20:44] talking about the Seven Seals if I
[1:20:46] remember right and these people are
[1:20:48] getting it mixed up and they're quoting
[1:20:49] me wrong and all just listen listen to
[1:20:51] what I say
[1:20:53] and that's why we see all these problems
[1:20:56] that's why it is so important if you
[1:20:58] want to believe William Branham
[1:21:02] listen to him
[1:21:05] as I said he spoke very clearly and
[1:21:09] that's what that brother said up
[1:21:10] upstairs
[1:21:11] he said I love listening to brother
[1:21:14] Branham
[1:21:15] it's because everybody changes it to
[1:21:18] match their own agenda
[1:21:22] I could talk about that brother Jordan
[1:21:24] all night long
[1:21:25] you know I just because I've seen so
[1:21:27] many problems the exact same thing that
[1:21:30] was happening here in the book of Acts
[1:21:32] they go and they represent someone and
[1:21:34] here
[1:21:36] is the letter that comes out and it says
[1:21:39] for as much as we have heard that
[1:21:42] certain which went out from us have
[1:21:45] troubled you with words subverting your
[1:21:48] souls saying You must be circumcised and
[1:21:51] keep the law to whom we gave no such
[1:21:53] Commandments
[1:21:55] we did not send these guys out
[1:22:06] as I said
[1:22:08] let the prophet speak for himself
[1:22:11] it's we have here in the Bible
[1:22:15] we have small
[1:22:19] small
[1:22:21] precious writings from the prophet
[1:22:24] and they're just they are golden
[1:22:28] to us we just cherish them so much
[1:22:32] and we read them and we study them and
[1:22:35] we come to church to learn more about
[1:22:37] them and the ministers they they study
[1:22:40] these things and they they they try to
[1:22:42] apply we try to apply them to our own
[1:22:45] lives
[1:22:46] but then we hear Brother Branham and we
[1:22:49] can hear him
[1:22:50] we can listen to a whole tape
[1:22:53] and and really understand
[1:22:55] what he is saying and if you want to
[1:22:58] believe him believe him
[1:23:00] you don't have to have me explain to you
[1:23:04] what he was meaning
[1:23:06] he did a very good job of it
[1:23:12] and as
[1:23:14] as brother said and I've said before I
[1:23:17] really don't believe brother Branham
[1:23:18] intended
[1:23:19] for us to have all of these different
[1:23:22] doctrines that go around the church and
[1:23:23] divide people
[1:23:25] I just I don't believe that he intended
[1:23:27] that I've listened to him since I was
[1:23:29] born and
[1:23:31] he's uh
[1:23:34] it's just a blessing every time it
[1:23:37] really it really is Sister Cynthia when
[1:23:40] I talk about brother Branham
[1:23:43] he was a man that that was here in the
[1:23:45] 40s and 50s and 60s he started a
[1:23:49] Ministry that really changed the world
[1:23:52] it was he started what's called
[1:23:56] charismatic Revival
[1:23:59] he uh
[1:24:01] he did absolutely incredible things one
[1:24:04] of the most the most gifted person that
[1:24:08] you could ever imagine he preached right
[1:24:09] here in this church he preached from
[1:24:12] this pulpit
[1:24:13] and what would happen is people would
[1:24:16] come in the prayer lines
[1:24:18] he would tell them exactly what was
[1:24:21] wrong with them if they were sick in
[1:24:24] fact many times he would say here's your
[1:24:27] address
[1:24:29] and tell tell the person their address
[1:24:31] he would say things that no one knew he
[1:24:35] was he would say this morning you went
[1:24:36] to the doctor's office and the doctor
[1:24:38] looked at you and he was wearing a blue
[1:24:40] vest and and something on his head and
[1:24:42] he's told you these things
[1:24:44] things that he absolutely could not know
[1:24:46] but the Holy Spirit was working through
[1:24:48] this man
[1:24:50] to increase the people's Faith so they
[1:24:52] could be healed and when I mentioned
[1:24:54] William Branham he he was he was very
[1:24:58] special he's the reason I'm converted
[1:25:00] he's the reason I'm a Christian today so
[1:25:02] he holds a big place in my heart
[1:25:07] verse number 25.
[1:25:14] it seemed good unto us
[1:25:16] being assembled with one Accord to send
[1:25:18] chosen men unto you this is our letter
[1:25:20] part this is the continuation of the
[1:25:22] letter
[1:25:23] chosen men unto you with our beloved
[1:25:25] Barnabas and Paul men that hazarded
[1:25:28] their lives for the name of our Lord
[1:25:31] Jesus Christ
[1:25:32] we have sent therefore Judas and Silas
[1:25:34] who shall also tell you the same thing
[1:25:37] by mouth
[1:25:39] for it seems seemed good to the Holy
[1:25:42] Ghost and to us to lay upon you no
[1:25:45] greater burden than these Necessary
[1:25:48] Things
[1:25:51] that you abstain from Meats offered to
[1:25:53] idols
[1:25:55] and from blood
[1:25:57] and from things strangled and from
[1:25:59] fornication
[1:26:00] from which if you keep yourselves you
[1:26:03] shall do well
[1:26:04] fairly well
[1:26:07] wow
[1:26:08] very simple
[1:26:10] very very simple
[1:26:12] he's saying stay away from idols and
[1:26:15] live clean
[1:26:16] not all of these rules and all these
[1:26:18] regulations and all of that he's saying
[1:26:20] just be a Christian
[1:26:26] so when they were dismissed they came to
[1:26:28] Antioch and when they had gathered the
[1:26:30] multitude together they delivered the
[1:26:31] epistle which when they had read they
[1:26:34] rejoiced for the consolation I'll bet
[1:26:36] they did
[1:26:38] and Judas and Silas being prophets also
[1:26:40] themselves exhorted the Brethren with
[1:26:42] many words and confirmed them
[1:26:45] and after they had carried their space
[1:26:47] they were let go in peace from the
[1:26:49] Brethren unto the apostles
[1:26:56] I can finish notwithstanding
[1:26:59] it pleased Silas
[1:27:02] to abide there still no no let me go
[1:27:04] back to that previous verse
[1:27:07] it says verse 32
[1:27:15] verse 31 I'm sorry which when they had
[1:27:17] heard when they read this letter
[1:27:20] they rejoiced
[1:27:22] for the for the consolation
[1:27:24] so so they were happy about all this
[1:27:27] that that they didn't feel led to be
[1:27:30] circumcised even though there was a very
[1:27:32] strict rule
[1:27:34] yet
[1:27:36] the the letter came back no you don't
[1:27:38] have to do that
[1:27:39] no you don't have to do all of these all
[1:27:42] of these rules basically stay away from
[1:27:44] idols and live clean
[1:27:48] and then Silas decided to stay and the
[1:27:51] other brother went back
[1:27:52] Paul also in Barnabas continued in
[1:27:55] Antioch teaching and preaching the word
[1:27:56] of the Lord with many others also and
[1:27:59] some days after Paul said unto Barnabas
[1:28:01] let us go again and visit our brethren
[1:28:03] in every city where we have preached the
[1:28:05] word of the Lord and see how they do now
[1:28:08] they had left Antioch for a little while
[1:28:10] and all kinds of problems came in
[1:28:13] with this these legalist Brothers came
[1:28:15] in and stirred everything up and caused
[1:28:16] all these problems so Paul's like hey we
[1:28:18] need to go back to all these churches
[1:28:20] that we visited and make sure they're
[1:28:22] doing okay make sure troublemakers
[1:28:24] hadn't gotten the middle of them too
[1:28:29] and Barnabas determined to take with
[1:28:31] them John whose surname was marked
[1:28:33] remember this guy
[1:28:35] he was the one that left in the middle
[1:28:36] of a missionary trip before upset Paul
[1:28:42] but Paul thought not good to take him
[1:28:45] with them who departed from them to
[1:28:47] pamphilia and went not with them to the
[1:28:49] work
[1:28:50] and the contention was so sharp between
[1:28:52] them that they departed asunder one from
[1:28:54] the other and so Barnabas took Mark and
[1:28:57] sailed unto Cyprus Paul chose Silas and
[1:29:00] departed being recommended by the
[1:29:02] Brethren unto the grace of God
[1:29:04] and he went through Syria
[1:29:07] and cilicia confirming the churches
[1:29:11] so we see that there was a contention
[1:29:14] the minute the um musicians can come
[1:29:17] make ready we see there was a contention
[1:29:20] between these two brethren
[1:29:22] and and they couldn't get it reconciled
[1:29:26] so they parted ways and I don't think we
[1:29:29] hear from Barnabas again the rest of the
[1:29:33] book of Acts is mainly about Paul
[1:29:36] but I want to I think the first part of
[1:29:38] Acts 16 also goes very well with 15. let
[1:29:41] me read the first three verses
[1:29:46] speaking of Paul then came he to Derby
[1:29:48] and to lystra and behold a certain
[1:29:51] disciple was there named timotheus the
[1:29:53] son of a certain woman which was a
[1:29:55] Jewish a Jewish and believed but his
[1:29:59] father was a Greek
[1:30:01] which was well speaking of Timothy which
[1:30:03] was well reported of by the Brethren
[1:30:05] that were at lystra and Iconium him
[1:30:07] would Paul have to go forth with him and
[1:30:10] took and circumcised him
[1:30:12] because of the Jews which were in those
[1:30:15] quarters for they knew all that his
[1:30:18] father was a Greek
[1:30:22] so
[1:30:23] Timothy
[1:30:25] didn't think it was necessary to be
[1:30:28] circumcised or he would have already
[1:30:30] been circumcised but now he gets on the
[1:30:32] field and he's going to be witnessing
[1:30:34] and preaching to Jewish believers
[1:30:39] so
[1:30:40] he had to be circumcised because they
[1:30:43] wouldn't have accepted him
[1:30:46] so we see that's why Timothy Timothy now
[1:30:49] is on the scene and we see that he took
[1:30:52] on this circumcision
[1:30:55] for the ministry
[1:30:58] not necessarily because he felt a
[1:31:01] conviction
[1:31:02] but for the people that he was preaching
[1:31:05] to
[1:31:07] we together
[1:31:09] do you understand
[1:31:10] do you understand
[1:31:13] that there was a this letter was a
[1:31:17] mutual respect
[1:31:19] this letter was written to these new
[1:31:22] converts and it was like no you don't
[1:31:24] have to conform to all of these rules
[1:31:28] just
[1:31:30] don't live immorally and don't get
[1:31:33] caught up in these idols and don't drink
[1:31:35] the blood because it's going to offend
[1:31:37] really bad that's really bad
[1:31:39] don't do those things
[1:31:41] and then he speaks to the new converts
[1:31:43] and he says Hey respect these longtime
[1:31:46] believers
[1:31:48] respect what they do and respect the way
[1:31:50] that they live because
[1:31:52] Moses taught all of this stuff
[1:31:56] so we see a beautiful
[1:31:58] mutual respect in the book of Acts
[1:32:01] brother and if you want to come
[1:32:03] you understand
[1:32:04] do you love the book of Acts I love it I
[1:32:08] love it because I see especially in this
[1:32:11] book
[1:32:12] I see that this is what we struggle with
[1:32:16] so often in our churches
[1:32:19] well someone will come in or someone
[1:32:21] within the church and start pointing
[1:32:23] fingers
[1:32:24] both sides
[1:32:26] both sides will
[1:32:28] the liberal ones and the legalistic ones
[1:32:30] start pointing fingers at each other
[1:32:33] and it does nothing but cause problems
[1:32:35] what he's saying here is respect each
[1:32:37] other
[1:32:38] don't try to impose things
[1:32:42] that never worked in the first place
[1:32:45] because it it it doesn't work it wasn't
[1:32:48] written for that it was just written as
[1:32:50] a guiding principle to keep us on the
[1:32:52] path till we get to Christ
[1:32:54] amen let's all stand
[1:33:09] through the blood
[1:33:13] through
[1:33:14] the blood
[1:33:18] through the blood
[1:33:22] we can come
[1:33:24] to his presence
[1:33:27] through
[1:33:33] Jesus Christ
[1:33:36] [Music]
