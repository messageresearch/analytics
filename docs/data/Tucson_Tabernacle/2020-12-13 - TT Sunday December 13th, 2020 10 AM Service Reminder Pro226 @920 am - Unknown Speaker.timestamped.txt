[50:37] want to reup that make sure that you're
[50:39] aware of that just to remind you um that
[50:42] when you're in the fellowship poll
[50:44] please use it for passing through if you
[50:47] want to greet somebody briefly now I
[50:49] don't want to say you know have a deacon
[50:51] on a timer and say you got five seconds
[50:53] and then we're out of the term brief but
[50:55] I'll leave that descrip freshing up do
[50:57] you please don't congregate uh in there
[51:00] I'll just say I've seen that a couple
[51:01] the last couple weekends and we just we
[51:04] don't want to have to have deacons come
[51:06] and get you and and remove you uh if you
[51:09] need to be in there and it's essential
[51:10] we understand that but if you don't have
[51:12] a need to be in there just please go to
[51:14] the outside use that just for we almost
[51:17] thought about closing it off but a lot
[51:19] of people access it from the parking lot
[51:21] um and so I know that you're more aware
[51:23] I'm sure that I am that uh the the co 19
[51:27] is spreading uh really On The Rise here
[51:30] Arizona is leading uh Tucson in fact
[51:32] leading uh many parts of the country in
[51:35] cases and my brother-in-law who's a
[51:37] nurse uh here in Tucson was just
[51:39] reporting last night that the hospital
[51:41] beds ICU beds are filling up and uh
[51:44] there's been a lot of cases around with
[51:46] Believers even here in Tucson some who
[51:48] have uh went on to be with the Lord some
[51:50] back home uh who we we had funeral a
[51:53] funeral here recently for a sister in
[51:55] our church who passed from it so we we
[51:57] don't say that to put fear upon anybody
[52:01] but this is the end times this is the
[52:02] end of the world so what do you expect
[52:05] uh it's going to get worse before it
[52:06] gets better but we just want to say that
[52:09] uh we we're good with what we're doing
[52:11] here uh there's been other churches even
[52:13] here in town who've had to completely
[52:15] shut down and close uh church because of
[52:19] uh cases that have risen and and just
[52:21] got out of control I don't want to see
[52:24] that happen here do you no we don't want
[52:26] to see that happen so we should do all
[52:29] we can all we could possibly do uh if
[52:31] you feel to wear a mask I'd encourage
[52:33] that do it um have I have no issue with
[52:36] that someone asked me is be okay if I
[52:38] wear a mask absolutely if you feel to
[52:40] wear a mask wear one uh and if and and
[52:43] so whatever you you do it do it Paul The
[52:46] Book of Romans says that whatever we do
[52:48] we do it by faith and if it's not Faith
[52:50] it's sin to us and so we want to uh do
[52:53] things that are pleasing to the Lord so
[52:55] I just wanted to as a a way of reminder
[52:58] to remind you uh take all Fellowship
[53:00] outdoors in an outdoor area uh and not
[53:03] in the fellowship poll so if it's a
[53:05] brief greeting something just quick you
[53:07] just saying hello that's fine just don't
[53:09] congregate again there are people who
[53:11] need to be in there as essential things
[53:13] that they're doing those are just fine
[53:16] amen you love the
[53:19] Lord amen praise God Amos chapter
[53:23] 1 Brothers if you have the PowerPoint
[53:25] I'll have you to speak L it I'd like to
[53:27] minister to you today and it's going to
[53:29] be um just how the Lord laid it upon my
[53:32] heart very uh very uh just a we would
[53:36] almost call it a study amen a Bible
[53:38] study here this morning just but just
[53:41] some a word that the Lord put upon my
[53:43] heart and started dealing with me uh
[53:45] yesterday and so I just like to speak to
[53:47] you on return to me return to me Amos
[53:51] chapter
[53:54] 1 the words of Amos
[53:57] who was among the Herdman of tooa which
[53:59] he saw concerning Israel in the days of
[54:02] Uzziah king of Judah and in the days of
[54:05] jeroboam the son of joash king of Israel
[54:08] two years before the
[54:10] earthquake I almost titled the message
[54:13] today two years before the earthquake uh
[54:15] but the Lord just changed me here but I
[54:17] want you to notice the emphasis here
[54:19] that this is written in retrospect so
[54:22] when you read The Book of Amos this is
[54:24] after the fact this isn't during
[54:26] uh this isn't the unfolding this is
[54:28] writing after the fact the words uh the
[54:32] Bible read it again here in verse one
[54:33] the Bible says the words of Amos who was
[54:35] among the Herdman tocoa which he saw
[54:38] concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah
[54:40] king of Judah and in the days of
[54:42] jeroboam the son of joash king of Israel
[54:45] two years before the earthquake and he
[54:47] said the Lord will Roar from Zan and
[54:51] utter his voice from Jerusalem and the
[54:54] habitations of the Shepherds shall mourn
[54:57] and the top of caramel shall wither thus
[55:01] sayith the Lord for three transgressions
[55:04] of Damascus and for four I will not turn
[55:07] away the punishment thereof because they
[55:10] have threshed Gilead with threshing
[55:11] instruments of iron but I will send a
[55:14] fire into the house of haziel which
[55:16] shall Devour the Palaces of benh Hadad I
[55:19] will break also the bar of Damascus and
[55:22] cut off the inhabitant of the plain of
[55:24] aan and him that holdeth the scepter
[55:26] from the House of Eden and the people of
[55:29] Syria shall go into captivity unto cerr
[55:32] saith the Lord uh Amos chapter 4 turn
[55:36] over and we'll read one more scripture
[55:38] and then I have you be be
[55:43] seated verse N9 Amos 4 verse N I have
[55:48] smitten you with blasting and mildew
[55:50] when your Gardens and your Vineyards and
[55:52] your fig trees and your olive trees
[55:54] increased the p worm devoured them yet
[55:59] you have not returned unto me sayeth the
[56:03] Lord let's bow our heads here amen
[56:06] together Lord Jesus we just Trust You
[56:09] Lord fully leaning Upon Your Grace this
[56:12] morning asking God that you would come
[56:15] Lord as we we've we've worshiped Lord
[56:18] the musicians the song leader we've sang
[56:20] the songs of Zion there's been praise
[56:23] sing Lord we've raised our hands now God
[56:26] we come to this most important part of
[56:28] the service and we bow our heads to you
[56:30] Lord as your creation and ask Lord for
[56:33] you to take preeminence Lord may you
[56:36] speak to each and every single life each
[56:38] and every single heart here today God as
[56:40] you've moved heavy upon my own heart I
[56:42] pray God that you would just use me Lord
[56:44] as a vessel Lord of mercy and of Honor
[56:47] Lord to these people I pray God that you
[56:49] would use the words that I speak may
[56:51] they be your thoughts Lord we ask Grant
[56:54] it Lord Jesus we pray in your name we we
[56:56] ask amen you can be seated this
[57:04] morning I'm going to go through a lot
[57:07] of of what we would know is history and
[57:11] you could read from Biblical historians
[57:14] and I just bring a thought out of it I
[57:16] believe it's it's a a well-known book in
[57:19] many ways and then not so well known in
[57:21] others this man Amos uh the prophet of
[57:24] God In Our Generation spoke a lot about
[57:27] this little sycamore tree farmer named
[57:30] Amos and this is a a man who uh is from
[57:34] the kingdom of Judah and so if this gets
[57:38] just a little bit teachy I don't have a
[57:39] whiteboard here a chalkboard to draw it
[57:41] on so just uh listen as close as you can
[57:44] and I'll give you some of these because
[57:46] I believe it's important to know the
[57:48] context uh when you're reading the Bible
[57:50] it's important to know who was the
[57:52] writer who was the prophet what was the
[57:54] message what was happening in the in the
[57:57] generation uh in the time frame where
[57:59] are we uh when we read these words and I
[58:02] believe it has such a an amazing
[58:04] parallel to the generation that we see
[58:07] here today Amos is a man from the
[58:11] southern Kingdom of Judah and he's he's
[58:15] preaching his message to the northern uh
[58:18] tribes of Judah this is in the 8th
[58:21] Century year is about
[58:24] 760 and Amos is going to be one of the
[58:27] last two prophets that God sends to
[58:30] Israel and so you read throughout your
[58:33] Bible and you read Israel in many
[58:34] different conditions and and this was a
[58:38] this was a time when there was uh just
[58:41] sin rampant amongst the churches both in
[58:44] the Southern and the northern tribes and
[58:47] so it's an it's it's during the time
[58:49] Amos writes this it's a during a time of
[58:52] of of relative what you would call Peace
[58:56] there's no war there's no battles the
[58:58] Assyrians have repented under Jonah
[59:00] there's no pressure coming from anybody
[59:03] whether from the northern Kings or the
[59:05] southern Kings there's no there's no
[59:08] there's there's no famine this is a time
[59:10] of Peace it's a time and this is the the
[59:12] setting for when Amos begins to write
[59:15] what we just read in Amos chapter 1 it's
[59:18] a time of prosperity uh but it's also at
[59:21] the same time a time of great neglect of
[59:26] God's word you always find hand in hand
[59:29] most of the time brother brandham says
[59:31] it this way he says sometimes Prosperity
[59:34] is one of the greatest curses that can
[59:36] come upon you we we know we've preached
[59:39] that here many times the the most
[59:41] spiritual David was the David uh in the
[59:44] desert running for his life and the most
[59:47] carnal backslid in David was the castle
[59:49] version of David when he had everything
[59:52] and so Israel is in great Pro great
[59:55] prosperity yet they're at the same time
[59:58] neglecting God and they've turned away
[1:00:00] from the god of their fathers and so you
[1:00:03] find this refrain you'll find this
[1:00:05] message throughout all of amos's words
[1:00:09] return to me sayeth the Lord return back
[1:00:12] to me and and he comes through Amos and
[1:00:14] he's going to be uh as we said he's one
[1:00:17] of the last two he's the last second to
[1:00:19] last prophet that is sent after Amos
[1:00:21] comes a man named Hosea and Hosea is the
[1:00:25] last warning that God sends to Israel
[1:00:30] with the same message returned to
[1:00:33] me now if you study a little bit of just
[1:00:36] uh uh history you'll find that the 8th
[1:00:38] Century you'll find all of these
[1:00:40] prophets are considered 8th Century
[1:00:43] Prophets The Year 760 and so the
[1:00:46] centuries are named prior and so we know
[1:00:49] that so this is the eth and eth Century
[1:00:51] prophet and and he's a sycamore farmer
[1:00:54] means that he's he's a no body he
[1:00:56] doesn't he comes from just out of
[1:00:58] nowhere suddenly comes upon the scene
[1:01:01] and this is the way God always uses his
[1:01:03] prophets he always takes a nobody
[1:01:06] someone with no history someone with no
[1:01:11] prominence someone who really doesn't
[1:01:13] maybe have a great
[1:01:16] education and he comes here and he and
[1:01:19] and right in the in the middle of this
[1:01:21] uh right right in the middle of this he
[1:01:23] comes with this message to the northern
[1:01:26] tribes of Israel and so he he he he he's
[1:01:30] a he's a nobody as we said he's a
[1:01:31] sycamore farmer that just simply means
[1:01:34] in the Bible times that uh he didn't
[1:01:36] have much he was very poor Sycamore
[1:01:39] farmer didn't make a a great living they
[1:01:41] were very meager uh income and so but
[1:01:45] but here's a principle that you'll find
[1:01:47] throughout the entire Bible God loves to
[1:01:51] confound the somebodies with the nobody
[1:01:56] he loves to take a nobody and and and
[1:01:58] and and he loves to confound them by
[1:02:01] choosing uh a nobody and this is what it
[1:02:04] spoke of when it said that Amos was a
[1:02:06] sycamore farmer it spoke to this man
[1:02:08] under the sycamore tree as you read his
[1:02:10] story and God let me Cho let me tell you
[1:02:13] this God did not choose Amos because of
[1:02:17] who he was but God chose Amos because of
[1:02:21] who he was
[1:02:24] not and God chooses us not because of
[1:02:28] what we are but what we're not God
[1:02:31] chooses us not because of who we are but
[1:02:34] who we not and the reason for God's
[1:02:37] choice when God chooses a vessel the
[1:02:40] choice lies and is revealed with him not
[1:02:44] the person in other words if you want to
[1:02:46] try to find why did God choose me you
[1:02:49] will never find it when you search
[1:02:51] yourself because the choice that God
[1:02:53] Made For You in election had nothing to
[1:02:56] do with you or how good you are or how
[1:02:59] bad you are or how great your conduct is
[1:03:02] or how bad your conduct is or or how
[1:03:04] good you look or how bad you look his
[1:03:06] choice in election is not revealed in
[1:03:10] the creation but the
[1:03:13] Creator because his reason lies in him
[1:03:18] not
[1:03:19] you and that's why you can never
[1:03:21] question why did God choose me
[1:03:26] because God didn't choose you for you he
[1:03:27] choose he chose you for him the Bible is
[1:03:31] not the the the people we have this
[1:03:33] modern day thinking that the Bible is is
[1:03:36] God's answer to us you know it's it's
[1:03:38] the answer that we needed and so it's
[1:03:41] it's all it's it's preached you know uh
[1:03:43] you need God well God's here for you you
[1:03:44] need you need Prosperity well God's here
[1:03:46] for you and God needs you listen friend
[1:03:49] the the Bible is God's answer to his
[1:03:51] problem not our
[1:03:53] problem he the Bible doesn't come the
[1:03:55] word of God doesn't come to fix our
[1:03:57] problems they come because he had a
[1:03:59] purpose before
[1:04:00] eternity brother manam says this and I
[1:04:03] want you just to read here he says this
[1:04:04] little unknown fellow was Amos he's a
[1:04:08] little unknown fellow was Amos the
[1:04:09] prophet now we don't know very much
[1:04:11] about
[1:04:12] him he says we don't know very much
[1:04:14] about him we don't know where he come
[1:04:16] from prophets usually he says prophets
[1:04:20] usually come on the scene unknown and
[1:04:23] leave the same way we don't know where
[1:04:26] they come from where they go don't know
[1:04:28] about their backgrounds God just raises
[1:04:31] them up he wasn't much to look at but he
[1:04:35] had thus saith the Lord that's the main
[1:04:38] thing I see of course he come to Samaria
[1:04:42] to begin his campaign I'm sure he had no
[1:04:45] cooperation from nobody he had no
[1:04:47] Fellowship card from any denomination he
[1:04:49] had no credentials to show what group he
[1:04:51] come from but he had one thing he had
[1:04:55] the word of the Lord for that
[1:04:58] City look what the prophet said Amos
[1:05:01] when he come into Samaria his little
[1:05:03] eyes narrowed as he come up over that
[1:05:06] and seen that sinful City now that
[1:05:08] sinful City that brother Bram is
[1:05:09] referring to is not the cosmos it's not
[1:05:12] the whole rest of the Heathen world that
[1:05:14] sinful city is Judah that sinful city is
[1:05:19] Israel and brother Bram says he comes
[1:05:21] over his eyes narrowed and he says he's
[1:05:23] seen that little sinful City women
[1:05:25] laying in the street with man a modern
[1:05:27] America when he looked up over his eyes
[1:05:30] narrowed and he had nobody to sponsor
[1:05:32] him he had no Fellowship card God had
[1:05:36] sent him would the people hear his
[1:05:38] message no they wouldn't hear him but he
[1:05:42] prophesied and he said the very God that
[1:05:45] you claim to
[1:05:47] serve will destroy you this is a modern
[1:05:51] picture of what you would maybe call the
[1:05:53] kingdom of of of that time it's accuracy
[1:05:56] could be questioned but I just thought
[1:05:58] it was uh just just so to give you some
[1:06:00] background here of the time frame and
[1:06:03] and so this is a time when Amos comes
[1:06:06] along when you ask the question he's
[1:06:09] he's coming in what you would know in
[1:06:10] history is the 8th Century so what was
[1:06:13] taking place in the 8th Century what was
[1:06:16] happening where was the world picture
[1:06:19] what was the era that he comes upon what
[1:06:21] did the world look like very much like
[1:06:23] it does today what what was the what was
[1:06:26] the the the the worldly as we would call
[1:06:28] it scene what's the backdrop well you'll
[1:06:31] find there were there were two major
[1:06:34] world powers in dominance in the 8th
[1:06:38] Century just two two major Powers you
[1:06:41] had Rome and you had Greece and we know
[1:06:45] that there was a great rivalry a great
[1:06:47] uh H H war between these two Nations
[1:06:50] these two great names Rome and Greece
[1:06:53] and we know that Rome was uh building
[1:06:56] infrastructure they were building roads
[1:06:58] and you see some of those roads we had a
[1:07:00] map that we'll display not sure how good
[1:07:02] you can see that but Rome is busy
[1:07:04] building roads and streets and highways
[1:07:07] and and they're they're building
[1:07:08] infrastructure and some of those roads
[1:07:10] that lead to to through Athens and you
[1:07:12] can go and travel some of those same
[1:07:14] roads today and they would be the very
[1:07:16] same roads that the gospel is is carried
[1:07:19] through in the New
[1:07:21] Testament and so Rome is busy building
[1:07:24] uh infrastructure and military strength
[1:07:26] and and and and and and but what Greece
[1:07:29] was uh uh establishing what we have
[1:07:32] today as the as the modern world what we
[1:07:35] call the the the the the World of Sports
[1:07:38] it's where you'll find their Origins
[1:07:40] everything you see here in the world
[1:07:42] today had a beginning it had an
[1:07:43] origination it started
[1:07:46] somewhere right even some of the same
[1:07:49] spirits that you see today and you think
[1:07:51] well it's it's Unique to our age it's
[1:07:54] not unique at all because everything
[1:07:56] started in a seed form where the only
[1:07:58] uniqueness is the m maturity of those
[1:08:02] Spirits are you here
[1:08:04] today what you're what what we face
[1:08:06] today is no different than what they
[1:08:08] faced back then the only difference is
[1:08:10] is that this is the Harvest Time and so
[1:08:14] at the Harvest Time all seeds come to
[1:08:17] maturity Satan's Eden comes to
[1:08:21] maturity that's why entertainment is at
[1:08:23] its Zenith it's at its maturity it's at
[1:08:26] its climax this is Brother Ram called he
[1:08:29] said he's the God of this evil age this
[1:08:31] where we're living today is not in God's
[1:08:33] Eden this isn't God's Planet this isn't
[1:08:36] God's world uh utopian uh the people who
[1:08:39] have the utopian view that this is the
[1:08:40] best life and this is we just want to
[1:08:42] make it as great as we can listen
[1:08:44] friends this is the worst life
[1:08:49] now popular Pastor in in Dallas Church
[1:08:52] of the largest church in America wrote a
[1:08:54] book that your best life now now you
[1:08:56] know just the title is not biblical this
[1:08:58] isn't your best life now your best life
[1:09:01] is the next life that's why I'm laying
[1:09:04] Treasures up in this life for the next
[1:09:06] life can you say amen and so Greece is
[1:09:10] established in the word of sports this
[1:09:12] is where the 8th Century where the
[1:09:14] Olympic games begin the Olympic Games we
[1:09:17] have today Trace them all the way back
[1:09:18] to this era and so it's it's it was
[1:09:22] laying uh Greece was uh busy the world
[1:09:24] was busy it was it was flourishing and
[1:09:27] prosperity and and and it was just an
[1:09:30] age of development and arts and
[1:09:32] literature and uh were were under Greece
[1:09:34] were being uh uh just the very
[1:09:36] foundations and the Very roots of it
[1:09:38] even even this is the age when the uh
[1:09:41] the civilization of the Chinese and the
[1:09:44] the Indian culture uh is is is
[1:09:47] established here in this age in this 8th
[1:09:49] Century you say well that was what the
[1:09:51] world was doing the world was
[1:09:52] flourishing the world was beginning the
[1:09:54] world was growing but my question is
[1:09:56] what was God
[1:09:58] doing where was God at this time what
[1:10:01] was God thinking what was God's people
[1:10:03] doing and the the answer to that
[1:10:06] question is that God was very very
[1:10:10] busy with his
[1:10:13] people God was having
[1:10:17] trouble great trouble he was having
[1:10:20] great problems from his
[1:10:24] children great great issues great
[1:10:27] problems and and it's amazing because
[1:10:29] Israel had a very simple Covenant to
[1:10:32] live by it's the same very much the same
[1:10:36] that you live by today and we can
[1:10:38] complicate things but let me give you
[1:10:40] the very simple Covenant that Israel had
[1:10:42] to live by blessing or
[1:10:47] cursing obedience brings blessing
[1:10:50] Disobedience brings
[1:10:53] cursing and God doesn't break covenants
[1:10:56] God keeps his
[1:10:58] covenants God doesn't break marriage God
[1:11:00] loves marriage he hates divorce God
[1:11:03] doesn't like separation so God says
[1:11:05] here's here's the law I'm going to
[1:11:07] you're going to live by blessing or
[1:11:08] cursing obedience or
[1:11:11] Disobedience and what we find very sadly
[1:11:13] is that they were living in a
[1:11:18] time where there's much
[1:11:22] Disobedience you'll find there in in
[1:11:24] your in your uh in the map there that we
[1:11:26] have before you the purple would be the
[1:11:29] southern Kingdom and the green would be
[1:11:32] the Northern Kingdom Israel and Judah
[1:11:35] and you'll find that in both places uh
[1:11:38] during this time God sends prophets two
[1:11:41] last prophets a man named Amos and a man
[1:11:45] named
[1:11:46] Hosea and they there that God had a
[1:11:49] special purpose and a special role and a
[1:11:52] special message now remember it wasn't
[1:11:56] amos's
[1:11:59] message it wasn't hosea's message oh
[1:12:03] this is so important for you to catch
[1:12:06] the message was not William bram's
[1:12:10] message I if you get offended I'll pull
[1:12:12] you up the quote and show you where he
[1:12:13] says that it's not my
[1:12:15] message this wasn't amos's message this
[1:12:18] was God's message this was God's heart
[1:12:22] and so God took a chosen vessel one who
[1:12:25] could be wholly separated unto himself
[1:12:29] and he said I'm going to fill you and
[1:12:31] baptize you with my spirit I'm going to
[1:12:34] take my burden that I have upon my heart
[1:12:36] and my message of what I want to say to
[1:12:38] my people and I'm going to so saturate
[1:12:41] you with that message Amos that you and
[1:12:43] the message will become
[1:12:46] one and amos's very heart was the heart
[1:12:49] of God he was expressing the very Mind
[1:12:52] Of God he was expressing the thoughts of
[1:12:54] God when he spoke he was not expressing
[1:12:57] his own thoughts he was a
[1:13:00] unic spiritually he didn't have any seed
[1:13:02] of his own he didn't have any mind of
[1:13:04] his own he didn't have any thought of
[1:13:06] his own it was the thought of God so
[1:13:08] when you rejected
[1:13:11] Amos who were you
[1:13:14] rejecting
[1:13:16] hello when you reject Amos you're not
[1:13:19] rejecting Amos you're rejecting God when
[1:13:23] you rejected Hosea you're not rejecting
[1:13:25] Hosea you're rejecting
[1:13:27] God that because it wasn't their message
[1:13:30] they were simply the
[1:13:32] mailman and don't get mad at the mailman
[1:13:35] he's just delivering the
[1:13:38] male and so when you get upset at the
[1:13:40] sermon when you get upset at what God's
[1:13:42] telling you don't get upset at the
[1:13:45] mailman he's just delivering the
[1:13:48] male
[1:13:52] amen and so God comes through the min
[1:13:55] histories of Amos and Hosea and he has a
[1:13:57] specific purpose he has a specific need
[1:14:00] and a specific message and he says I'm
[1:14:02] going to have you speak it now this is
[1:14:04] this is sad because when you look also
[1:14:06] in the 8th Century where was Israel we
[1:14:08] asked that question well unfortunately
[1:14:10] as you can see by our map they're
[1:14:13] divided they're not one at all uh
[1:14:16] they're they're they're they're
[1:14:17] separated now I know
[1:14:19] that all of us some of us here would
[1:14:22] would know some of this so let me just
[1:14:23] go over a brief uh cuz when you hear
[1:14:26] that maybe some would get confused on
[1:14:28] what do you mean the northern and the
[1:14:29] kingdom you you know we know the the the
[1:14:32] Civil War right there was the North and
[1:14:33] there was the South well let me talk
[1:14:36] about a different Civil War one that
[1:14:38] happened before that Civil War because
[1:14:41] that's what it was really it was a civil
[1:14:43] war that broke out between the North and
[1:14:45] the
[1:14:46] South
[1:14:48] amen and I'll just say Amos was a
[1:14:51] southerner so
[1:14:56] he comes from the south and his message
[1:14:59] is to the north now notice why are they
[1:15:02] divided they
[1:15:04] become where do we get a kingdom we have
[1:15:06] a northern kingdom and Southern Kingdom
[1:15:08] well then we have to ask well why a
[1:15:10] kingdom well because there's Kings well
[1:15:12] why Kings because they demanded a king
[1:15:15] to be like other nations originally in
[1:15:17] God's mind he was the great uh uh
[1:15:21] potentate he was the great Monastery he
[1:15:23] was the great he was the great uh King
[1:15:25] for Israel but they wanted a king they
[1:15:27] wanted to be like other nations so even
[1:15:30] though God warned them even though God
[1:15:32] tell told them Kings will fail you men
[1:15:34] will fail
[1:15:36] you yeah they wanted the king to be like
[1:15:38] despite all Samuel's warnings they
[1:15:41] wanted to become a kingdom and so then
[1:15:44] when they become a kingdom they chose a
[1:15:46] leader they chose a king and that man
[1:15:49] was Saul and he the son of Kish you know
[1:15:53] he has the image he has the stat sture
[1:15:55] he has the looks he has the gift he has
[1:15:57] the ability he's very eloquent he's very
[1:16:00] articulate he looks like the king he
[1:16:02] dresses like the king he's got a strong
[1:16:04] stature strong and build and so this is
[1:16:07] who they choose that's who man always
[1:16:10] chooses because God says man looks after
[1:16:12] the outward of is not like you I look
[1:16:15] upon the heart and so God's man was a
[1:16:18] little man named David not a big man
[1:16:20] named
[1:16:21] Saul but they chose Saul and we know the
[1:16:24] story of Saul and he has his own uh
[1:16:27] moral failure and issues and and he and
[1:16:31] and his own issues and problems and he
[1:16:33] falls apart as he's a popular choice but
[1:16:36] major character issues inside of this
[1:16:39] man that would only come out later and
[1:16:42] so God God gave them a man after his own
[1:16:44] heart a man named David and we know the
[1:16:46] story of that but you say well that's
[1:16:48] great well well God chose a man not but
[1:16:51] look friends even David had his mistakes
[1:16:55] even David backsliding murder and
[1:16:57] adultery in David's
[1:16:59] life you see God was trying to tell them
[1:17:02] that he he spoke to them when you go
[1:17:04] read the Bible you'll find that there
[1:17:06] was a there was a dispensation where God
[1:17:09] chose prophets there was a dispensation
[1:17:11] when God chose priests there was a
[1:17:13] dispensation when God chose Kings but at
[1:17:16] the end of all of man's dispensation
[1:17:19] then comes one man and King Jesus and
[1:17:22] he's Prophet he's priest and he's
[1:17:25] King and is the only unfailing high
[1:17:29] priest and so God God God sends them
[1:17:33] through this we know that they become a
[1:17:34] kingdom then after David comes Solomon
[1:17:38] who builds this great glorious Temple
[1:17:41] and it's a it's just a in magnificent
[1:17:44] Kingdom our temple in glory and and and
[1:17:47] and he did his his his his uh economy is
[1:17:50] flourishing and under Solomon its
[1:17:52] Prosperity but even if you go look up uh
[1:17:56] the the the details you miss the details
[1:17:58] sometimes you don't read the fine print
[1:18:00] you just read all the major highlights
[1:18:02] you'll find that Solomon built that
[1:18:05] Kingdom off of heavy Taxation and forced
[1:18:12] labor
[1:18:14] Solomon heavy
[1:18:16] Taxation and forced
[1:18:19] labor and so what did that lead to well
[1:18:21] a Revolt no one wanted to work for free
[1:18:25] he goes and taxes everybody heavy
[1:18:27] Taxation and so there leads this great
[1:18:29] Revolt after he dies his son after him
[1:18:33] we know we know the the story I'm just
[1:18:35] giving you just a brief uh history here
[1:18:37] because all of the wealth all of the
[1:18:39] money is going to be concentrated in the
[1:18:41] south in Judah that's where all the
[1:18:43] money's going to come from so before
[1:18:45] this map they were all one Kingdom but
[1:18:47] because of that taxation because of the
[1:18:49] forc labor because of because of man's
[1:18:52] schemes and man's ways Civil War breaks
[1:18:55] out a Revolt breaks out under rabo and
[1:18:59] and and we know that we know that the
[1:19:02] kingdom then uh splits and so 10 tribes
[1:19:05] of Israel
[1:19:07] revolt and they separate and there's the
[1:19:10] there's the
[1:19:13] separation and they they create their
[1:19:15] own kingdom and then there's two
[1:19:18] tribes that stay faithful in Jerusalem
[1:19:21] because now you have you have a you have
[1:19:24] a a a a a split and now you have the
[1:19:27] northern kingdom which is Israel and you
[1:19:30] have the southern Kingdom which is Judah
[1:19:33] and you have the Tribe of Benjamin and
[1:19:35] Judah the ones that stay
[1:19:38] true to the line of David because you
[1:19:41] see God this wasn't this wasn't about
[1:19:43] Kings and kingdoms and and buildings and
[1:19:45] Ministries and popularity and
[1:19:48] reputations this was about a seed
[1:19:50] line God's mind was about a seed that
[1:19:53] would come through David
[1:19:55] that out of the root of David out of the
[1:19:57] root of Jesse would come a
[1:20:00] deliverer but you see how man gets right
[1:20:02] in the way of God's
[1:20:04] plan and it becomes personal and then
[1:20:06] their feelings get involved then there's
[1:20:08] a Revolt then there's a split they
[1:20:10] forgot the purpose they forgot the
[1:20:13] meaning it wasn't about you it was never
[1:20:14] about your kingdom it was never about
[1:20:16] your way or what you wanted it was about
[1:20:18] fulfilling the purpose of God it was
[1:20:21] about bringing forth the plan of God it
[1:20:23] was about a royal seed
[1:20:26] so they they they stay true this these
[1:20:29] Southern
[1:20:30] kingdoms stay true and faithful to
[1:20:33] Jerusalem and the Royal line that God
[1:20:35] was going to bring through David but you
[1:20:37] know what that meant when the northern
[1:20:38] kingdom split it meant now they don't
[1:20:42] have a
[1:20:44] temple because the Temple's in the
[1:20:46] southern Kingdom so you know what they
[1:20:48] did they created their own temple in
[1:20:50] fact they created two of
[1:20:53] them they don't have a Temple they don't
[1:20:56] have a king so what do they do they got
[1:20:59] another king when you read the book of
[1:21:01] Kings this is what you're
[1:21:04] reading that's why you read about the
[1:21:06] king that has the same name but it's a
[1:21:09] different King one's Northern one
[1:21:12] Southern and they buildt a temple they
[1:21:14] built a king and then you read in the
[1:21:15] book of Kings such and such was the son
[1:21:17] of tcoa the mother was name was was this
[1:21:20] name and he lived this many years and he
[1:21:23] did that with that which was right you
[1:21:25] remember that and he did that which was
[1:21:27] evil in the sight of the Lord and this
[1:21:29] is what you're reading in the book of
[1:21:30] Kings as these two northern and southern
[1:21:32] kingdoms that had split because now that
[1:21:35] the northern kingdom pulls off you say
[1:21:37] brother Matt who are we talking about
[1:21:38] this is God's chosen
[1:21:43] family I want that to sink in this isn't
[1:21:47] heathens this is God's
[1:21:50] people that became so inundated with
[1:21:54] their
[1:21:55] life became so inundated with their
[1:21:59] purpose they forgot the main
[1:22:03] thing so they
[1:22:05] establish they create their own Royal
[1:22:10] Line they create their own religion
[1:22:13] their own culture it's very much like
[1:22:15] the southern Kingdom it's very much like
[1:22:17] the way of David but not exactly sort of
[1:22:20] mixed in little mixed religion
[1:22:25] and they create two shrines two holy
[1:22:28] temples one's going to be you can't see
[1:22:31] it there but there's a little town that
[1:22:32] we know very well named
[1:22:34] bethl and they create one temple in
[1:22:37] bethl they create one in Samaria and the
[1:22:41] both temples are going to be just
[1:22:42] infested with sin and adultery and
[1:22:45] debauchery some of the most horrible
[1:22:47] things but they have two they have two
[1:22:50] uh one one at bethl which bethl means
[1:22:52] what it means the house of God and then
[1:22:55] one further north in Samaria you
[1:22:57] remember the Samaritan woman when she
[1:22:59] comes to Jesus and she's asking the
[1:23:01] question should we worship in Samaria
[1:23:03] should we worship here or in Jerusalem
[1:23:06] she's referring all the way back to
[1:23:10] this and and and they they established
[1:23:13] their own King their own kingdom their
[1:23:15] own Temple their own way of
[1:23:19] worship their own way of worship starts
[1:23:22] right here makes their own
[1:23:25] Royal Line you could go read about it in
[1:23:27] the book of Kings as we said first and
[1:23:29] second
[1:23:30] Kings it's it's an amazing thing because
[1:23:34] there there's a mixture now remember the
[1:23:36] message is returned to me sayeth the
[1:23:39] Lord there's this mixing this mixture
[1:23:41] this mixture within right within the
[1:23:43] family of God right within the people of
[1:23:45] God and they start bringing in other
[1:23:48] gods the gods of Bell and the gods of
[1:23:50] asteroth and it's mixed in it sort of it
[1:23:53] sort of looks like a message church I
[1:23:57] mean a David
[1:23:59] church but not exactly something just
[1:24:03] not exactly there's hints of it there's
[1:24:05] there's ways you could trace it oh
[1:24:07] that's that's right but there's so many
[1:24:08] things that don't reflect the god of
[1:24:11] their
[1:24:13] fathers remember he was the one who
[1:24:15] called himself the god of Abraham Isaac
[1:24:18] and Jacob it was God who chose to
[1:24:20] identify himself with these men with
[1:24:24] God's family and God said I'll put where
[1:24:26] I put my name not where you put my name
[1:24:30] where I put my name and I'll put my name
[1:24:33] in
[1:24:34] them the god of their fathers the god of
[1:24:37] the of of how they were raised the god
[1:24:39] of their past it there was traces that
[1:24:42] you could label but then there was so
[1:24:44] much mixture that was so different so
[1:24:47] new so
[1:24:49] Heathen even their culture even the
[1:24:52] Bible says that they eventually you come
[1:24:54] to Hagi and they had completely
[1:24:56] forgotten the children had completely
[1:24:59] forgotten the ancient
[1:25:02] language didn't know how to speak it
[1:25:05] didn't know how to talk they they they
[1:25:07] knew there was a language but they
[1:25:08] didn't know it and God through ha
[1:25:11] condemns them for this what was it it
[1:25:14] was a
[1:25:15] mixture and so it's amazing because
[1:25:18] anytime there's wickedness anytime that
[1:25:20] you f that you backslide away from God
[1:25:24] many many times that backsliding now
[1:25:26] remember there's a difference there's
[1:25:29] such a difference between falling
[1:25:32] away and
[1:25:35] backsliding say brother Matt how's there
[1:25:37] a difference because the prophet of God
[1:25:38] said we backslide every
[1:25:41] day now that's his words the Apostle
[1:25:44] Paul said I Die
[1:25:46] daily because backsliding all
[1:25:49] backsliding is is just going
[1:25:51] backwards it's not necessarily I know we
[1:25:54] used the term to say oh they've backslid
[1:25:55] and they're in the world but backsliding
[1:25:57] sometimes you have a person who falls
[1:25:59] away falls into sin and they're out of
[1:26:00] church and they're in the world they're
[1:26:03] captive and a prisoner but but then you
[1:26:06] have backsliding which is much more
[1:26:09] gradual because with backsliding there's
[1:26:11] still the outward image most of the time
[1:26:15] you can still talk and say the same
[1:26:17] things you can still look sort of the
[1:26:19] same
[1:26:21] part but something's taking place in the
[1:26:23] heart
[1:26:25] and it always starts in the
[1:26:28] heart backsliding always starts in the
[1:26:30] heart are you here today Church
[1:26:33] backsliding always starts in the heart
[1:26:35] it always starts it never starts with an
[1:26:37] outward act the Bible says when lust
[1:26:41] hath conceived When sin hath conceived
[1:26:43] when lust has con conceived it brings
[1:26:45] forth sin and When sin has ran its work
[1:26:47] it brings forth death but when lust is
[1:26:50] conceived that conception happens in the
[1:26:52] mind in the heart and the spirit yes and
[1:26:55] many people backslide in their heart
[1:26:58] long before they fall away in their
[1:27:02] flesh and that's why in churches church
[1:27:05] that's why we're preaching here today
[1:27:06] that's why we're saying the things that
[1:27:07] we're saying because the word of God
[1:27:10] meets both the the believer the
[1:27:12] unbeliever and the make believer the
[1:27:15] word of God speaks to all of
[1:27:17] us and the backsliding always takes
[1:27:20] place as Israel that was always gradual
[1:27:22] it always slowly started as turning away
[1:27:24] from God and the heart always turns
[1:27:26] before the feet we've preached on that
[1:27:28] hair before look at lot and
[1:27:32] Abraham Abraham the Bible says lot
[1:27:35] pitched his tent towards
[1:27:38] Sodom with Abraham right but he wasn't
[1:27:42] in Sodom yet but he had pitched his tent
[1:27:45] in other words his heart is affection
[1:27:47] and what happens it's only a matter of
[1:27:50] time and lot leaves and dwells inside
[1:27:54] long before the feet leave the heart
[1:27:56] leave
[1:27:58] first and so there's a gradual
[1:28:01] backsliding it's it's a turning
[1:28:04] away what's amazing the as a bi as an
[1:28:08] average it's just incredible to me that
[1:28:11] if you go and you read the book of kings
[1:28:13] and you average out the
[1:28:15] lifespan of a wicked
[1:28:17] King The King that says and he did that
[1:28:20] which was evil in in in Kings you'll
[1:28:23] read that and it says he did that which
[1:28:25] was evil in the sight of the Lord and
[1:28:28] then it then it begins to talk about it
[1:28:30] it says and he did that which was right
[1:28:34] in the sight of the Lord and it's
[1:28:36] amazing because when you look at the
[1:28:38] history of all of the northern Kings
[1:28:41] they had very very short
[1:28:45] Reigns very short every single one of
[1:28:47] you find very short Reigns a wicked King
[1:28:51] only Reigns for a very short period of
[1:28:53] time they always uh they always either
[1:28:56] were assassinated there was a takeover
[1:29:00] there was a coup it was always an
[1:29:02] unstable government and in fact the
[1:29:04] average was three
[1:29:07] years they would only Reign for three
[1:29:11] years on
[1:29:12] average before they would be
[1:29:14] assassinated or a
[1:29:16] coup their government was always
[1:29:18] unstable because why because anything
[1:29:21] I'm reminded of the words of brother
[1:29:22] Brandon anything outside of the line and
[1:29:26] Order of God's word will
[1:29:29] fail amen that doesn't mean it doesn't
[1:29:32] work for a period of time and it looks
[1:29:34] like everything's
[1:29:37] fine because sometimes the decisions
[1:29:40] that we make we don't we're not affected
[1:29:42] by
[1:29:43] immediately and so we think hey it must
[1:29:45] be fine but the the Bible says because
[1:29:48] sentence because the sentence against an
[1:29:51] evil work is not executed speedily
[1:29:54] therefore the hearts of the sons of men
[1:29:56] fully set in them to do evil what is
[1:29:59] that is Ecclesiastes what is it saying
[1:30:01] it says just because you don't reap what
[1:30:03] you sow the next day after you seow it
[1:30:06] doesn't mean you're not going to reap
[1:30:08] what you
[1:30:09] sow that's why choices are important
[1:30:12] decisions are important what we the
[1:30:14] choices we make can have a consequence
[1:30:17] that affects not just us but our
[1:30:18] children and our children's
[1:30:21] children Generations
[1:30:27] and so they they they they they last
[1:30:30] three years on average
[1:30:32] unstable but you know what's
[1:30:35] amazing the southern Kings if you go and
[1:30:38] look at the southern Kings it was always
[1:30:40] a stable government because why it was
[1:30:43] based upon God's word it was based upon
[1:30:46] the Royal Line Of God through David and
[1:30:49] if you average out the reign of a king
[1:30:51] from the southern tribe it was 33
[1:30:57] years imagine Jesus at 33 you think God
[1:31:01] did that by accident no the average
[1:31:04] reign of a Godly
[1:31:06] King imagine that because there was one
[1:31:09] righteous King and his name was
[1:31:13] Jesus the average reign of a southern of
[1:31:16] of a king from the southern tribe who
[1:31:18] was followed after the precepts of David
[1:31:20] they weren't perfect was 33 years
[1:31:24] so the northern
[1:31:26] kingdom becomes the focus of these two
[1:31:29] men Amos and Hosea the Bible says here
[1:31:33] the words of Amos this is Amos 111 who
[1:31:36] was among the herdmen of
[1:31:39] tcoa which he saw concerning Israel in
[1:31:42] the days of Uzziah king of Judah and in
[1:31:43] the days of jeroboam the son of joash
[1:31:45] king of Israel two years before the
[1:31:48] earthquake now remember that this is the
[1:31:50] words of God before as we said this was
[1:31:53] a time of peace and prosperity uh Jonah
[1:31:56] goes to Assyria who was one of their
[1:31:58] number one adversaries and Assyria
[1:32:01] unlike what Jonah wanted
[1:32:03] repent so it eases off the pressure
[1:32:05] Israel is not under any kind of pressure
[1:32:08] there was no kind of threat immediately
[1:32:10] no trouble no stress no war in fact
[1:32:14] there was an entire generation of young
[1:32:17] people who never experienced
[1:32:21] War they never experienced
[1:32:24] War they never experienced trouble if
[1:32:27] you read about that era and you you go
[1:32:30] and look at that uh um uh uh uh era of
[1:32:34] of of what we're speaking of here with
[1:32:36] Amos children who were born who never
[1:32:38] knew War you know that has an
[1:32:42] effect that has a
[1:32:44] consequence whether good or bad it has a
[1:32:46] consequence you know I I've known war
[1:32:49] you've known My Generation has known war
[1:32:51] our nation has been to war multiple
[1:32:53] times
[1:32:54] but this was a generation who never knew
[1:32:56] War now I didn't experience by no means
[1:32:59] have any way to to I can only imagine
[1:33:02] when I hear the stories of my
[1:33:03] grandfather about real
[1:33:05] war and I hear about World War II about
[1:33:09] Vietnam and you hear what the nation was
[1:33:11] like under real War I never experienced
[1:33:14] a draft I never watched my father uh get
[1:33:18] drafted but some of us have some of us
[1:33:20] here have have fought in
[1:33:22] war it's a amazing thing because when
[1:33:25] you don't when when you when you don't
[1:33:27] experience it
[1:33:29] sometimes God has to bring a person
[1:33:31] through something sometimes you just got
[1:33:34] to live it before you can you got to
[1:33:36] experience it before you can really know
[1:33:39] what you're talking
[1:33:40] about and they had no war that means
[1:33:43] there would they never experienced
[1:33:45] stress they never experienced real
[1:33:47] anxiety they never experience real
[1:33:49] pressure no trouble and an entire
[1:33:51] generation grows up
[1:33:55] soft
[1:33:57] soft soft they're soft people they don't
[1:34:01] really know how to appreciate normal
[1:34:04] things don't know how to appreciate hard
[1:34:07] time good times because they've never
[1:34:09] really had hard times you know sometimes
[1:34:12] God's got to bring you through hard
[1:34:14] times just so you can appreciate good
[1:34:19] times sometimes God has to break your
[1:34:22] health so that you'll appreciate good
[1:34:27] health
[1:34:31] yeah so I don't know why I'm stopping
[1:34:33] here but I'm just going to
[1:34:35] stop sometimes God has to bring people
[1:34:38] through things and you have no you have
[1:34:41] you have you have you have no you don't
[1:34:43] you don't know how to appreciate things
[1:34:45] that just
[1:34:48] work things that just work things that
[1:34:51] you take for granted every single day
[1:34:53] I'm just talking about very physical
[1:34:55] things very natural things you know I'll
[1:34:57] never I I'll never I remember thinking
[1:34:59] that when I had lost my hearing and and
[1:35:01] I had intense uh vertigo and couldn't
[1:35:05] walk couldn't hardly get without help
[1:35:07] from my house to my vehicle had to be
[1:35:09] helped because everywhere the world I
[1:35:12] looked was spinning and shaking and I
[1:35:13] would fall and you know I thought I
[1:35:16] never knew how to appreciate
[1:35:19] balance until I didn't have it
[1:35:24] and you ought to look at the things God
[1:35:26] has given you in your life and you ought
[1:35:27] to say thank you thank you Lord for the
[1:35:31] things I'm unthankful for thank you for
[1:35:34] the things I don't think about thank you
[1:35:36] for the things I take for
[1:35:42] granted 11:22 boy we have not even
[1:35:45] scratched the
[1:35:47] surface are you all
[1:35:50] right so it's a time of great Prosperity
[1:35:53] under under King jeroboam II and if you
[1:35:56] read about that era in the north and we
[1:35:59] don't have it here I think you're not
[1:36:01] going to be able to see there on the map
[1:36:03] but there's in the north you'll find
[1:36:05] there was right up uh oh right up on the
[1:36:08] very top there was a a trade route a
[1:36:10] road that goes all the way from Europe
[1:36:12] to Arabia and it and it what it meant
[1:36:15] was that they were the pass through
[1:36:16] cities so they could trade they they
[1:36:18] became prosperous because of this they
[1:36:21] became Rich they became soft they were
[1:36:24] very
[1:36:26] religious very
[1:36:27] religious yet very backsliding very soft
[1:36:33] very religious but not the religion of
[1:36:36] their
[1:36:37] fathers it was mixed with Pagan
[1:36:41] practices cultures the god of bell and
[1:36:44] asteroth were mixed into their worship
[1:36:47] now Bell and asaroth are both gods of
[1:36:49] fertility both of them gods of fertility
[1:36:52] and it's amazing because if you go look
[1:36:53] and I'm not in a mixed audience going to
[1:36:55] say too much here today but if you look
[1:36:57] at the temple at bethl and the one at
[1:36:59] Samaria uh there were there was there
[1:37:01] was actually prostitutes at the
[1:37:05] church on the at the front
[1:37:08] door not there for the right
[1:37:11] reasons you go read some of your Bibles
[1:37:13] some of the most horrible things you
[1:37:15] could ever imagine took place right in
[1:37:18] the house of
[1:37:19] God this is this is people always look
[1:37:22] and you know you have a secular world
[1:37:24] who looks at the Judgment of God and
[1:37:25] says oh my such a horrible God and so
[1:37:28] mean and so angry well you don't the the
[1:37:31] punishment fit the
[1:37:33] crime you never understand why did God
[1:37:35] react this way till you go back and
[1:37:36] realize how how really awful it was what
[1:37:39] they were doing to Children what they
[1:37:41] were doing to to to to people it was
[1:37:43] horrible right in the
[1:37:47] church God of bell and astrath both gods
[1:37:50] of
[1:37:51] fertility and people were turning up in
[1:37:54] droves to the temples to worship because
[1:37:57] when worship when worship I'm going to
[1:37:59] make this point when worship becomes
[1:38:03] sensual it always attracts
[1:38:09] crowds when worship becomes sensual it
[1:38:11] becomes
[1:38:13] popular it's amazing because
[1:38:15] fertility sexuality those kind of things
[1:38:18] that you find even here that we read
[1:38:19] about mixes with religion
[1:38:24] and Jesus speaks about or Jude speaks
[1:38:26] about this you'll read it in the book of
[1:38:28] of Jude and and he go go on I forget
[1:38:30] it's the 20th verse or somewhere around
[1:38:32] there he says these be they who separate
[1:38:35] themselves sensual not having the spirit
[1:38:38] sensual it's amazing because today's
[1:38:41] modern churches are full of it full of
[1:38:44] it modern churches sensual worship you
[1:38:48] said brother Matt why do you preach on
[1:38:49] that because we always have to be
[1:38:50] careful that we don't bring some of
[1:38:51] those things right into the way of
[1:38:53] worship that we
[1:38:56] have the inspiration is from God and
[1:38:58] it's good to have inspiration I'm not
[1:39:00] against any of that but sometimes the
[1:39:02] vessels are dishonorable vessels and
[1:39:04] dishonorable
[1:39:05] people well that was that was really for
[1:39:10] free Israel was backsliding in the you
[1:39:13] know there there they were completely
[1:39:15] backsliding on God but let me just let
[1:39:17] me just uh come to a close here today
[1:39:20] you say brother mat those are awful
[1:39:22] things we read about some of the most
[1:39:23] terrible things we can read about there
[1:39:26] they were backslid and but you know what
[1:39:28] that wasn't the worst
[1:39:31] part the sins that you read about were
[1:39:33] not the worst part some of the most
[1:39:36] horrible things you can hear that wasn't
[1:39:38] the worst part the worst part is that
[1:39:42] nobody
[1:39:45] cared nobody
[1:39:47] cared this is why God sent Amos and
[1:39:50] Hosea no one
[1:39:52] cared you ever heard of apathy when
[1:39:55] you're apathetic towards something you
[1:39:58] know it's sort it's it's one it's that
[1:40:01] apathetic attitude you know sort of
[1:40:05] uh you know so you know that's one of
[1:40:09] the worst attitudes that you could have
[1:40:13] towards
[1:40:16] this and people can become good
[1:40:19] Believers can become if we're not
[1:40:22] careful
[1:40:24] pathetic just yeah no you you wouldn't
[1:40:27] say that we wouldn't say that but in our
[1:40:30] attitude it just becomes sort of I don't
[1:40:32] know you know it's
[1:40:34] there yeah I know that's what the word
[1:40:36] of God says
[1:40:39] but Israel was had this apathy just so
[1:40:45] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we know it's
[1:40:46] true we know what you're saying is true
[1:40:48] we get it you've preached it every
[1:40:51] Sunday but
[1:40:56] you would you would be better off to
[1:40:59] come in here completely
[1:41:02] blitzed drunk out of your
[1:41:06] mind You' be better to come here like
[1:41:09] that completely high as a kite you'd be
[1:41:13] better off in that condition than to
[1:41:15] come here in your sane mind and hear the
[1:41:18] word of God and your attitude be
[1:41:26] because God can deal with a
[1:41:27] drunk God can deal with a drug
[1:41:30] addict but God has such a hard time
[1:41:33] breaking through
[1:41:35] religiosity
[1:41:39] of now this is what the Lord told me to
[1:41:41] preach so don't get mad at the
[1:41:45] mailman no one
[1:41:48] cared because why you say brother Matt
[1:41:50] how did that happen how do you get to
[1:41:51] such a place you don't get there
[1:41:54] overnight you don't happen it doesn't
[1:41:57] happen where you're on fire one day and
[1:41:58] you're worshiping the Lord and you come
[1:42:00] to church next Sunday and you're just no
[1:42:03] it happens very gradual Israel was very
[1:42:06] gradual slow you know if it would have
[1:42:08] happened suddenly there would been an
[1:42:10] outcry for it but it came in so slowly
[1:42:14] that people eventually accepts and just
[1:42:17] you just eventually accept it and and
[1:42:20] you know it it it just
[1:42:22] slowly Creeps in as I've as I've I've
[1:42:26] said this here before little little uh
[1:42:28] picture that I one of my I think it was
[1:42:30] my wife who sent it to me or and it was
[1:42:32] so powerful just in a little word it
[1:42:35] said spiritual death begins one
[1:42:38] compromise at a
[1:42:41] time spiritual death doesn't happen
[1:42:44] overnight it's one compromise at a
[1:42:48] time it slowly Creeps in slowly it
[1:42:52] creeps in slowly it it washes over like
[1:42:56] water and God's response to all of this
[1:42:59] after all of their backsliding that
[1:43:01] backsliding after all of their sin God
[1:43:03] could have chose just to disown them he
[1:43:05] could have said you know what okay
[1:43:07] that's it we're done you I'm just going
[1:43:09] to wipe my hands of it you obviously
[1:43:11] don't want me you obviously have no
[1:43:13] interest in it I'm just going to toss
[1:43:14] you out we're going to start over again
[1:43:16] God could have had that and just
[1:43:18] destroyed them and looked at another
[1:43:20] people and and and and just said I'm
[1:43:22] just going to start over but here's
[1:43:23] something you'll learn about God your
[1:43:25] heavenly father no matter how low no
[1:43:28] matter how far you go no matter how how
[1:43:30] deep you go in sin God never gives up on
[1:43:36] youen God never stops coming after you
[1:43:40] God never stops pursuing you no matter
[1:43:43] how distant no matter how cold no matter
[1:43:45] how much in sin the heart of God is
[1:43:47] always God hates divorce God hates
[1:43:51] divorce he loves union he loves
[1:43:54] relationship and no matter how
[1:43:56] Unfaithful you and I ever become to
[1:43:59] him he remains faithful to you and
[1:44:03] me and chapter one and chapter two
[1:44:06] you'll read this H we read it in chapter
[1:44:08] one this is all God coming to them and
[1:44:12] he's and and you'll notice Amos is
[1:44:14] prophesying against all of these
[1:44:16] neighboring cities he's prophesying
[1:44:18] against all of the other uh kingdoms
[1:44:20] that uh that had came against uh uh uh
[1:44:23] God's people and he condemns six
[1:44:26] different you'll read this in Amos one
[1:44:28] he goes to condemn six different nations
[1:44:31] and he brings great condemnation and
[1:44:33] great judgment and he's and he's and
[1:44:36] he's and he's he's condemning them for
[1:44:38] pursuing uh uh wealth and and land and
[1:44:41] power with no regard for human life with
[1:44:44] no regard for people just conquering to
[1:44:47] conquer gaining to gain and these
[1:44:49] nations are now coming under the wrath
[1:44:51] of God because of their hatred because
[1:44:55] of how they treated God's people this is
[1:44:57] what Amos 1:2 is
[1:44:59] about and you read Amos 1 and two and
[1:45:01] you think oh God is Amos is just coming
[1:45:04] after all of the world and all of the
[1:45:06] nations against him you know be like me
[1:45:08] up here preaching against uh you know uh
[1:45:10] different movements that are against
[1:45:11] God's
[1:45:13] program and we preach against the
[1:45:15] culture and everyone oh cheering and all
[1:45:18] of Israel's amen and oh go you know go
[1:45:20] after them Amos and you know preach it
[1:45:22] hard to him Amos and you know go after
[1:45:24] him that's what that's what it sounds
[1:45:25] like because you can hear the Roar from
[1:45:27] the
[1:45:28] people as Amos is just declaring and
[1:45:31] crying out and crying out against the
[1:45:33] the Nations and then you come to chapter
[1:45:36] three and then Amos
[1:45:39] turns and now those same people who are
[1:45:41] cheering he points his finger and he
[1:45:43] says hold on a minute I'm done with
[1:45:46] them now I'm going to talk to
[1:45:49] you and Amos 3 God turns
[1:45:53] and he starts to speak to
[1:45:55] Israel and he starts to deal with their
[1:45:58] condition and he he condemns Judah and
[1:46:01] Israel and says you've done the same
[1:46:02] thing you're here you are busy cheering
[1:46:05] uh you know at the condemnation coming
[1:46:07] to the Nations but you're doing the very
[1:46:09] same thing you're just like
[1:46:12] them your life is no different how do
[1:46:14] you think you're any different than them
[1:46:15] your life is no different Judah you've
[1:46:18] spurned God the ways of David you've SP
[1:46:21] you followed your diluted ideas of
[1:46:24] religion you followed your own ways of
[1:46:27] worship and because of that jerus
[1:46:29] Jerusalem's going to burn to the ground
[1:46:31] that's that's amos's message God's going
[1:46:33] to burn it all he's going to set it on
[1:46:35] fire as a punishment and and and Israel
[1:46:38] is it going to be is it going to be off
[1:46:40] the hook either but but they're they
[1:46:42] they their their sins of oppressing the
[1:46:44] people and worshiping uh any God that
[1:46:47] they come across getting drunk in the
[1:46:48] temple this is all what you find in in
[1:46:50] chapter three and so
[1:46:53] comes to all of these things and he
[1:46:55] begins to tell them I want you to turn
[1:46:57] to chapter 4 uh there in your Bible and
[1:46:59] you could put it on the screen I don't
[1:47:01] think I have it uh there I don't yet but
[1:47:05] Amos chapter
[1:47:13] 4 God comes to Ramos and he gives him a
[1:47:18] message this is a message of judgment

[1:49:30] he didn't say now the devil has attacked
[1:49:31] you and brought famine in your life no
[1:49:35] he says I have given you cleanness of
[1:49:38] your teeth in all your cities and want
[1:49:41] of bread in all your places yet here's
[1:49:44] the war here's here's the words here's
[1:49:45] the heart of God yet you have not
[1:49:49] returned unto me sayeth the Lord
[1:49:54] I have also withholden the rain from you
[1:49:59] did you know God can withhold the rain
[1:50:02] from your
[1:50:04] life he can take blessing that God's
[1:50:07] given you for this many years and then
[1:50:09] suddenly pull it off of your
[1:50:11] life and it's not the devil who does
[1:50:13] that it's
[1:50:15] God
[1:50:17] hello I've taken the clean I've given
[1:50:20] you cleanness of teeth one of bread I've
[1:50:21] also withholden the rain when there were
[1:50:24] yet three months to the Harvest and I
[1:50:25] caused it to rain upon one city and
[1:50:28] caused it not to rain upon another city
[1:50:31] one piece was rained upon and the the
[1:50:34] peace whereupon it rained not withered
[1:50:37] in other words God said blessing fell
[1:50:39] here but it didn't fall to
[1:50:41] you rain fell here but I withheld it
[1:50:44] from
[1:50:45] you follow this he says and I've
[1:50:47] withholden the rain verse seven and he
[1:50:50] says verse eight so two or three cities
[1:50:52] one wed into one city to drink water but
[1:50:54] they were not satisfied yet you have not
[1:50:56] returned unto me saith the Lord I have
[1:51:00] smitten you with blasting and mildew
[1:51:02] when your Gardens and your Vineyards and
[1:51:04] your fig trees and your olive trees
[1:51:05] increased the pmer worm devoured them
[1:51:07] yet you have not returned unto me saeth
[1:51:12] the Lord I have sent among you the
[1:51:15] pestilence after the manner of Egypt
[1:51:17] you're young the same thing that God
[1:51:19] does to
[1:51:21] Egypt now God says I did that to you and
[1:51:25] you ask this question you say brother
[1:51:27] Matt why God sends food shortage crops
[1:51:32] failed then he holds the rain a water
[1:51:34] shortage there's no fresh water anywhere
[1:51:36] to drink who's doing this God now all of
[1:51:40] the people are coming under the effect
[1:51:41] of this and they might be asking the
[1:51:42] question why did this happen to me why
[1:51:44] is this happening why is this taking
[1:51:45] place over here and God says it was me
[1:51:49] the whole time why so that you would
[1:51:52] return return unto
[1:51:54] me why does God bring judgment so that
[1:51:57] you would return unto
[1:51:58] me and he says I I brought I I I I I
[1:52:02] then after then after that he sends
[1:52:04] plagues he sends plagues through
[1:52:06] diseases first the crops
[1:52:09] locusts and the crop
[1:52:12] fails imagine this if you were the
[1:52:14] people of God your your your crop three
[1:52:16] months before Harvest suddenly no rain
[1:52:18] the the crop fails you have no food now
[1:52:21] now you're hungry
[1:52:23] and and and and then disease then if you
[1:52:25] go read further God says then I sent
[1:52:28] disease he says I sent you at verse 10
[1:52:31] among the pestilence after the man of re
[1:52:32] your young men have I slain with the
[1:52:33] sword have taken away your horses have

[1:52:40] do he sends plagues to the
[1:52:43] people God's
[1:52:45] family this is God's
[1:52:48] people raids from other
[1:52:51] nations other Nations come suddenly
[1:52:53] Raiders from other nations come and
[1:52:55] plunder
[1:52:56] them and then God sends lightning you go
[1:52:59] and and read that is some other some uh
[1:53:01] I have overthrown some of you go to the
[1:53:04] next verse you can uh I have overthrown
[1:53:06] some of you as God overthrew Sodom and
[1:53:08] gomor and you were as fire bur and
[1:53:09] plucked out of the burning yet you have
[1:53:10] not returned unto me sayith the
[1:53:12] Lord verse 12 he says therefore thus
[1:53:16] while I do to the old Israel because I
[1:53:17] will do this unto thee prepare to meet
[1:53:18] thy
[1:53:20] God God sins pestilence God sends crop
[1:53:23] failure God SS you said brother the mat
[1:53:25] why is he doing this at any time they
[1:53:27] could have heard the voice of God
[1:53:30] through the pestilence through the crop
[1:53:31] failure through the disease through the
[1:53:33] through through God removing the
[1:53:34] blessing and it was all for the purpose
[1:53:37] of them returning unto him so he sent
[1:53:41] more and he sent more and he sent more
[1:53:44] all the while trying to get their
[1:53:45] attention trying to get their attention
[1:53:47] trying to wake them up trying to make
[1:53:49] make them realize what was happening to
[1:53:51] them was the hand of God God wasn't the
[1:53:53] hand of man this was the hand of God it
[1:53:56] was a hand of
[1:53:57] Mercy because God will keep coming God
[1:54:00] will keep pursuing God will keep pushing
[1:54:02] God will keep God you you you get so
[1:54:05] concerned oh look what God's doing to
[1:54:06] the world and the you know look what
[1:54:08] God's going to bring what is this Corona
[1:54:10] virus it's just it's it's it's judgment
[1:54:13] and and and it's it's come upon the
[1:54:14] Earth because uh the world because the
[1:54:16] nation has turned their back on God I
[1:54:18] I've heard that you know from a from a
[1:54:20] little boy you know that the the America
[1:54:22] was a Christian Nation we know that
[1:54:24] founded upon good Christian things but
[1:54:26] they're nowhere nowhere near a Christian
[1:54:29] Nation now nowhere not not even a not
[1:54:32] even a small amount of a Christian
[1:54:35] Nation Are We Now none not none
[1:54:38] whatsoever they've completely turned
[1:54:41] their back on God they've completely
[1:54:43] turned to the ways of the world and so
[1:54:45] what is God doing God is sending
[1:54:47] judgment God is s pestilence God sends
[1:54:50] earth earthquakes and hurricanes and the
[1:54:52] of God says why does he do that as a
[1:54:54] judgment to the nation but let me just
[1:54:57] stop here just for a moment my brother
[1:54:59] my sister lest we get so mesmerized by
[1:55:02] what God is doing to them that we forget
[1:55:05] God's attention is still on you it's
[1:55:07] still on me and God says don't get go so
[1:55:10] concerned with how much the world has
[1:55:12] turned their back on me what about you
[1:55:15] where is your life where is your
[1:55:16] dedication where is your worship where
[1:55:18] is your
[1:55:20] life because if you thank God has
[1:55:22] attention and has has his attention on
[1:55:25] the world how much more does he have it
[1:55:27] upon his
[1:55:30] family and God says make sure that lest
[1:55:33] while you so are so quick to judge your
[1:55:36] neighbor why you're so quick to judge
[1:55:38] the world why you're so quick to judge
[1:55:40] the the the sin in the world which is
[1:55:42] good we recognize the sin but what about
[1:55:45] the liven in our own
[1:55:48] lives we can become so obsessed with how
[1:55:51] evil the world is that we completely
[1:55:53] miss the
[1:55:54] evil that is in
[1:55:57] us and this is what happened to Israel
[1:56:00] and God was saying I sent you this you
[1:56:02] were so busy looking at the rest of the
[1:56:04] Nations and so busy about the judgments
[1:56:06] coming upon the Nations you completely
[1:56:08] forgot I'm still dealing with you I'm
[1:56:10] still dealing with the Gentiles I'm
[1:56:12] still dealing with your
[1:56:14] heart I still
[1:56:16] care so he sends all of these yet
[1:56:19] there's two more disasters as we close
[1:56:22] there's two more judgments coming upon
[1:56:26] them notice this here if you have the
[1:56:28] PowerPoint you can put it
[1:56:32] back the words of Amos who were among
[1:56:34] the Turman now the Herdman of takot now
[1:56:37] notice this is verse one of chapter one
[1:56:39] I want you to follow this closely
[1:56:41] because notice what aamos says here he
[1:56:44] says the Bible records this in
[1:56:45] retrospect which he concern Israel in
[1:56:47] the days of Uzziah king of Judah and the
[1:56:48] days of jerbo and the so jash king of
[1:56:50] Israel notice two years two
[1:56:55] years before the
[1:56:59] earthquake now this is written after the
[1:57:03] fact no one knew that amos's warning was
[1:57:07] two years 24 months and
[1:57:11] Counting before an earthquake a massive
[1:57:14] earthquake
[1:57:16] massive an earthquake so powerful that
[1:57:19] hits the two Northern tribes it was so
[1:57:22] big that even the prophet Zachariah 250
[1:57:26] years later mentions this
[1:57:30] earthquake an earthquake that destroys
[1:57:33] and Sever and destroys people and
[1:57:35] families and homes yet they don't know
[1:57:37] that's God's final warning final
[1:57:39] judgment before he final warning before
[1:57:42] he sends judgment and they go into
[1:57:43] captivity after this they go into
[1:57:45] Babylonian
[1:57:47] captivity they don't know it two years
[1:57:49] before my brother my sister just pinch
[1:57:51] your conscience this morning they had no
[1:57:54] idea when they came to church and they
[1:57:56] heard that sermon on return to me saith
[1:57:59] the Lord that that sermon would start a
[1:58:01] timer and that but from that message two
[1:58:04] years 24 months and Counting before the
[1:58:09] earthquake you imagine this it was after
[1:58:11] the fact no one knew that this was two
[1:58:13] years before the sermons they were
[1:58:15] hearing turn back to God get rid of your
[1:58:18] Idols return to me sayeth the Lord was
[1:58:21] too years before the earthquake yet no
[1:58:24] one heeded the warning no one heeded the
[1:58:28] warning no one
[1:58:31] listened I thought about this as I read
[1:58:34] these words this morning and I said Lord
[1:58:36] little do we know that this sermon here
[1:58:38] today will be two years before
[1:58:40] California goes underneath the ocean
[1:58:43] little do you know that this is the last
[1:58:45] few sermons you'll hear and the last
[1:58:47] message is you say brother Matt why
[1:58:48] would you preach on this the world is so
[1:58:50] uh covered in fear and there's so much
[1:58:52] already bad news and this seems so
[1:58:55] negative my brother the message of God
[1:58:57] is a is a message of love it's a warning
[1:59:00] return to me oh sayith the
[1:59:03] Lord because little do you know it's
[1:59:06] just two years 24 months before
[1:59:08] destruction
[1:59:11] Falls and God comes to get a people
[1:59:13] little do we know that maybe we'll look
[1:59:15] back brother Aaron maybe we'll look back
[1:59:17] and say that message you preached here
[1:59:19] that message uh uh brother Peter spoke
[1:59:21] that message brother L spoke that
[1:59:23] message brother Aaron spoke or the the
[1:59:25] minister that came little did we know as
[1:59:27] we're looking in retrospect little did
[1:59:29] we know that was just 24
[1:59:32] months before we all went
[1:59:37] home God was making one more final call
[1:59:39] one more final push one more final
[1:59:42] wooing one more final
[1:59:45] message one more he says surely the Lord
[1:59:50] God will do nothing but he revealeth it
[1:59:53] revealeth his secret unto his servants
[1:59:55] the prophet God never sends judgment
[1:59:58] until he sends a prophet and gives a
[2:00:02] warning and you have received that
[2:00:05] warning he was going to send two last to
[2:00:08] this Northern tribe Amos and Hosea these
[2:00:11] were two
[2:00:15] opposites two completely opposite men
[2:00:19] Amos was very hardened was very very
[2:00:22] tough it was very very bare
[2:00:26] Knuckles no kid
[2:00:28] gloves this came with the message of God
[2:00:31] and
[2:00:31] spoke but God's going to send one more
[2:00:36] Prophet one more man little man named
[2:00:41] Hosea and Hosea is going to be so
[2:00:44] opposite of Amos but yet their message
[2:00:46] is going to be the same
[2:00:50] thing Amos comes with a strong
[2:00:52] accusation of God's
[2:00:55] justice spoke of what God's going to do
[2:00:57] and and how what what God's about to do
[2:01:00] but now Hosea as the last warning as the
[2:01:04] last message as the last plea Hosea
[2:01:07] comes with the message of he's it's an
[2:01:10] appeal it's an
[2:01:13] appeal and he comes return to me Amos
[2:01:17] deals with their outward sins but Hosea
[2:01:19] deals with their backslid and
[2:01:23] heart Hosea is so
[2:01:26] different the contrast between Hosea and
[2:01:30] Amos is so clear there's an affection
[2:01:33] you notice you read the words of Hosea
[2:01:35] we don't have time to turn here but
[2:01:38] there's an affection rather than an
[2:01:41] accusation there's a
[2:01:43] wooing there's a
[2:01:45] wooing where rather than a
[2:01:48] warning like Amos
[2:01:52] Hosea comes with a tender hand a soft
[2:01:56] hand a tender hand rather than a tough
[2:01:59] hand what is it it's
[2:02:02] Mercy rather than
[2:02:06] Justice because the Bible says this it
[2:02:09] says it says here for the word of God
[2:02:12] Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is
[2:02:14] quick that doesn't mean fast it's like
[2:02:17] you've been quickened under life it
[2:02:18] means
[2:02:19] alive the word of God the word of God is
[2:02:23] quick it's
[2:02:25] alive and
[2:02:27] powerful and sharper notice than any
[2:02:30] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[2:02:34] dividing the sun of the Soul and Spirit
[2:02:35] and the joints and the marrow and it is
[2:02:36] a discerner of the thoughts and intents
[2:02:39] of the heart I want you to notice this
[2:02:40] this double-edged sword he comes from
[2:02:43] Amos and he's tough he's accusing he
[2:02:46] speaks to the mind he Majors on Justice
[2:02:49] he gives them the Divine thoughts of
[2:02:52] what God thinks but then God sends the
[2:02:54] other side of the
[2:02:56] sword named
[2:02:58] Hosea and Hosea comes tender with an
[2:03:02] appeal he speaks to the
[2:03:04] heart and he Majors on mercy and he
[2:03:08] gives to them not the Divine thoughts of
[2:03:10] God but the
[2:03:14] feeling because God says just as Hosea
[2:03:17] Gomer is going to be unfaithful to you
[2:03:19] Hosea this is and that what that does to
[2:03:22] crush your heart this is what Israel's
[2:03:25] done to
[2:03:26] me so return as one final appeal before
[2:03:32] after this you go read after this 10
[2:03:35] tribes
[2:03:36] poof they're
[2:03:38] gone it's only later that they come and
[2:03:42] Deport the rest of them what is it it's
[2:03:46] a message of mercy God always sends
[2:03:50] mercy and judgment
[2:03:52] together yeah God always sends it as a
[2:03:55] two-edged sword the Bible says it this
[2:03:57] way mercy and judgment have kissed
[2:04:01] they've joined together they they
[2:04:03] they've actually are adjoined one to the
[2:04:04] other you can't have mercy without
[2:04:06] judgment just as much as God sends
[2:04:08] judgment he sends mercy and sometimes
[2:04:12] that love is correct of love but it's
[2:04:14] always God's
[2:04:17] love bow your heads here with me we're
[2:04:19] out of time we're going to close
[2:04:22] musicians if you could make your
[2:04:30] way he sends a
[2:04:32] man named
[2:04:34] Hosea the burden of
[2:04:43] Hosea what is it it's
[2:04:45] God's
[2:04:47] warning but it's God's mercy
[2:04:52] it's
[2:04:54] God's dealing with with a with a sharp
[2:05:00] sword dealing with the sins in your life
[2:05:04] confronting those ways that you know are
[2:05:07] not like him those ways that are not the
[2:05:09] ways of your
[2:05:12] fathers God confronts it head on
[2:05:16] sometimes that's exactly what we need we
[2:05:18] need someone to be honest with us we
[2:05:20] need the Holy Spirit to to say like
[2:05:22] David say search me oh God see if there
[2:05:25] be any wickedness in me as brother
[2:05:28] Brandon would come to the end of a
[2:05:29] message a cutting message and he he'd
[2:05:33] say oh don't you feel just so scoured
[2:05:37] out sometimes we need that we need to
[2:05:39] raise a hand and say Lord scour me out
[2:05:43] that's what I need carve it out Lord
[2:05:45] root it out come to every area and every
[2:05:47] aspect of my
[2:05:49] life have I not seen your your hand in
[2:05:52] the way
[2:05:54] that that you came to Israel you failed
[2:05:57] crops you brought disease you brought
[2:05:59] pestilence but maybe it wasn't the devil
[2:06:01] maybe it was you trying to get my
[2:06:03] attention to say return to
[2:06:06] me but then Lord that same hand that can
[2:06:08] be so
[2:06:09] firm that same hand of judgment comes
[2:06:13] with a hand of Mercy
[2:06:14] outstretched and says I'm not I'm not
[2:06:17] here to judge you I'm not here to
