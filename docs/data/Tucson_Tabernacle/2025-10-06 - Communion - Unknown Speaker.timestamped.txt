[16:55] Greater Than All My Sin as she comes.
[16:58] Greater than all

[17:35] of life.
[17:37] I cannot fall for it's greater than all.
[17:43] The blood of the lamb.
[17:47] [Music]
[17:53] I'm scared.
[17:56] Pray for me. I don't do this. Um, I
[18:00] talk, but I don't usually talk about all
[18:02] these people.
[18:04] Um, okay. This is how it all starts.
[18:08] When I was 16,
[18:11] I was
[18:13] junior high. I I guess you would say I
[18:16] might have been sort of
[18:19] uh popular with the friends that I was
[18:21] with. And you know, you thought you're
[18:24] kind of cool, you know. And so I was a
[18:26] cheerleader. I did it for two years. And
[18:29] so I was going into high school and I
[18:33] told my dad, I said, "Daddy, I want to I
[18:35] want to try out for high school uh
[18:37] cheerleading." And he says, "No, you're
[18:40] not going to." And I said,
[18:42] Oh, I want to, Daddy. And he goes, "No,
[18:46] you're getting too big now." And so, um,
[18:50] you just aren't going to do that. And I
[18:52] said, "Daddy, I really, really, really
[18:54] want to." And he said, "I don't care.
[18:58] You're not going to do it." And, um,
[19:02] well, 16, you think you know it all. And
[19:05] I said, "Daddy,
[19:07] I'm going to do it anyway."
[19:09] And he looked at me. I love my dad.
[19:14] He said, "There's some things you can do
[19:19] and it's going to be hard and there's
[19:21] other things you can do that will be
[19:23] real easy and you'll just it just go
[19:26] by." And then he turned and walked away.
[19:29] And I said, "I'm still going to try out
[19:31] for cheerleading." And so that evening,
[19:34] we have horses. And and I never was very
[19:37] good at horses anyway, but I decided to
[19:39] ride. I'm just shaking. I'm sorry. But
[19:42] um um
[19:48] um anyway
[19:50] um
[19:54] anyway, I uh lost my place now, but um
[19:59] where was I?
[20:02] Okay, I'm at the Yes, we're out at the
[20:04] farm and um we have horses and I wasn't
[20:07] a very good question and my sisters
[20:10] were, but I wasn't. But I decided I was
[20:12] going to ride bearback and I don't know
[20:15] why I chose that. I'm not that good. But
[20:18] I got an old buck. I thought, well,
[20:20] he'll be okay. And you know, there was
[20:22] this little rabbit that come right in
[20:24] front of a buck and he just shed. And I
[20:26] thought, okay, I'm going to fall. And I
[20:29] braced myself for the fall. And when I
[20:32] did, I broke both bones. And I got up
[20:37] and I said, "Daddy, I think I broke my
[20:39] arm." And just the skin was holding on
[20:42] to Daddy goes, "You don't have to think
[20:44] you did." And uh um and then he goes,
[20:48] "Mother, go get a splint." Now, this is
[20:50] kind of comical. She went over and
[20:52] picked up a 2x4 and she was trying to
[20:54] break it over her knee.
[20:57] And if it if I wasn't hurting so bad, I
[20:59] I would have laughed. But um daddy goes,
[21:03] "Oh, Charlotte, just get a little
[21:04] stick." And this was the first break in
[21:07] the whole family. I have four sisters.
[21:09] Ah, it would be me. I always was. Well,
[21:12] never mind. But anyway, this happened.
[21:15] And so, forget the cheerleading. Now,
[21:19] I've got this to deal with. And
[21:23] talk about dealing with it. Um the
[21:26] doctor was drunk when he performed the
[21:28] surgery. Um I was in a cast for a year.
[21:33] He took it off and it was crooked and
[21:37] and then he wanted to break it over
[21:40] again. And um daddy says, "No." After he
[21:44] put a big scar on both sides, he goes,
[21:47] "No, you're not going to do that. I'm
[21:49] going to uh design a cast and we're
[21:52] going to put pressure on that top uh
[21:54] bone so it'll go down and you're going
[21:57] to design you're going to make it and
[21:58] I'm going to watch you make it. Now, my
[22:01] dad was a plant manager of a tankart
[22:02] company as well as a as a minister, but
[22:05] he knew how to make people jump when
[22:08] they, you know, and so the doctor he was
[22:11] going to do it.
[22:13] why he I don't know why he even kept
[22:15] him, you know, after he was drunk. But
[22:17] anyway, he did. And um so I had a cast
[22:21] for a half a year. Now I went from being
[22:24] popular to being well, I was just with
[22:27] the nerds, that's all. But it was okay.
[22:30] You know what? I found out that there's
[22:31] people that are really sweet and they
[22:34] don't have to be so popular. They can be
[22:37] ever so kind. And they were really kind
[22:39] to me. Of course, I was in a cast for so
[22:42] long, they thought I was a little messed
[22:44] up, you know. So, so anyway, um but the
[22:48] Lord um the Lord was good. And when they
[22:53] took the cast off
[22:55] this time, the bone was straight. And
[22:59] you can look at my arm. I don't have a
[23:02] bump. I have a bad scar. But I'll tell
[23:05] you a little bit about that, too. But I
[23:08] was so grateful I can move it and
[23:09] everything's great, you know. So that
[23:12] was good. And but I was 16, you know. I
[23:15] didn't want a big old scar on my hand.
[23:16] So I was kind of feeling bad, you know.
[23:18] I thought, well, I'm marred for life.
[23:21] And um I saw this man and he was on a
[23:28] platform and he had he couldn't he
[23:30] didn't have any legs and he just he had
[23:33] two little things to scoot him along
[23:36] with. you know that was in his hands. He
[23:38] would scoot along and that person in
[23:41] there said that could be you.
[23:44] You don't have that.
[23:47] And I thought I'm ashamed.
[23:51] And so I the Lord gave me this song and
[23:54] I'd like to sing it to you. I'm not a
[23:56] singer, but I'd like to just listen. You
[24:00] might get a blessing out of it.
[24:08] For once I saw a man all torn and
[24:11] ragged.
[24:13] His eyes were dim, his legs were
[24:16] paralyzed.
[24:19] He thought that no one knew the tr he
[24:22] carried.
[24:24] But there was one who cared. He knew not
[24:27] of.
[24:29] Shed forth thy tattered garments, for I
[24:32] have made thee clean. Take from the side
[24:35] the crutches, for now I can walk free.
[24:39] Open mine eyes from darkness, for now I
[24:44] can see.
[24:46] Oh hallelujah,
[24:48] Jesus my king.
[24:51] And then our Lord came to this weary
[24:54] pilgrim
[24:56] and told him to believe and he'd
[24:59] receive.
[25:01] Then Jesus came and bowed his name
[25:05] before him and he was whole. Oh, blessed
[25:10] be his name.
[25:14] Shed forth thy tattered garments for now
[25:18] I can walk free. Open mine eyes from
[25:21] darkness for now I can walk free. Open
[25:26] mine eyes from darkness for now I can
[25:30] see.
[25:31] Oh hallelujah
[25:34] Jesus
[25:35] my king.
[25:37] Oh hallelujah
[25:40] Jesus my king.
[25:44] Thank you
[25:45] [Applause]
[25:55] We're going to get those lyrics and
[25:57] we're going to sing that with the
[25:58] congregation sometime. I'm serious.
[26:01] We're going to do it.
[26:04] Thank you very much for that. Let's sing
[26:06] the love of God is greater far as
[26:08] brother Daniel comes.
[26:10] [Music]
[26:12] The love of God
[26:17] is greater far
[26:21] [Music]
[26:22] than tongue or pen
[26:28] can ever tell.
[26:33] It goes beyond
[26:37] [Music]
[26:39] the highest star
[26:44] and reaches to
[26:49] the lowest hand.
[26:55] The guilty pair
[27:00] bowed down with care.
[27:06] God gave his son.
[27:10] [Music]
[27:12] to him.
[27:15] [Music]
[27:16] His airing child
[27:22] he reconciled
[27:27] and pardoned from
[27:33] is sin. Verse two,
[27:38] when years of time
[27:43] shall pass away.
[27:49] And earthly thrones
[27:54] and kingoms fall.
[27:59] When men who hear
[28:03] [Music]
[28:05] refuse to pray.
[28:08] [Music]
[28:10] And on rocks and hills
[28:15] and mountains call,
[28:20] God's love so sure
[28:26] shall still endure.
[28:30] [Music]
[28:31] All measureless
[28:35] [Music]
[28:37] and strong
[28:40] [Music]
[28:42] redeeming
[28:44] grace
[28:47] to Adam's race.
[28:53] The saints send a
[28:56] [Music]
[28:58] gel song. Let's sing. Could we with
[29:03] Could we with
[29:08] the ocean filled?
[29:14] And were the skies
[29:19] of parchment made?
[29:22] [Music]
[29:24] For every star
[29:30] on earth, a quill,
[29:34] [Music]
[29:35] and every man,
[29:40] a scribe by train
[29:45] to write the love
[29:48] [Music]
[29:51] of God above. Love
[29:56] would drain the ocean
[30:03] dry.
[30:06] Or could the scroll
[30:11] contain the whole
[30:17] though stretch from sky
[30:22] to would you stand and sing the chorus
[30:24] with me?
[30:27] Oh love of God,
[30:31] [Music]
[30:32] how rich and pure,
[30:38] how measureless
[30:41] [Music]
[30:44] and strong
[30:48] it shall forever
[30:54] more endure.
[30:55] [Music]
[30:58] The saint sent
[31:03] [Music]
[31:09] a good song
[31:12] for communion and the love of God. Could
[31:15] you put that that last verse up there?
[31:21] Could we with ink the ocean filled and
[31:24] were the skies a parchment made? Where
[31:26] every stalk on earth a quill and every
[31:30] man ascribed by trade to write the love
[31:33] of God above would drain the ocean dry.
[31:36] Nor could the scroll contain the whole
[31:39] well stretched from sky to sky.
[31:43] the author's unknown
[31:46] of that verse
[31:49] and it said that it was written scribed
[31:53] on the wall of an insane institution
[31:56] many many years and years ago
[31:59] and you think that even the love of God
[32:02] could go down into a cell room nobody
[32:06] probably knew who that person was that
[32:09] wrote it and nobody probably cared but
[32:12] God cared.
[32:13] and he cares for all of us. Let's bow
[32:16] our heads.
[32:19] Almighty God, we thank you for
[32:22] Lord. The love of God that is rich and
[32:25] pure.
[32:28] Lord, we
[32:31] if we could humbly give you back a
[32:33] little bit of that love from us. Say
[32:36] thank you for your kindness to us, your
[32:39] goodness.
[32:40] Lord, humbly ask that maybe that you
[32:43] would come down and join us in this
[32:45] communion service tonight.
[32:48] Lord, we're doing it in remembrance of
[32:50] you.
[32:52] So Lord, would you come and be with us?
[32:56] Join us as we do this,
[32:59] Lord, this great thing in honor of our
[33:02] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
[33:06] Amen. Thank you. You can be seated.
[33:12] That was my mother-in-law.
[33:17] [Applause]
[33:20] Merily, you wrote that song. Wow.
[33:25] Beautiful, wonderful story.
[33:28] And uh I I appreciated one of the things
[33:31] that I really appreciated in the story.
[33:33] appreciated the whole thing, but you
[33:35] said that there were some kind people,
[33:38] and kind people
[33:40] are they're a godsend. And I know that
[33:43] the Lord places them in our path. It
[33:45] seems like when we need them the most is
[33:48] kindness from someone that we may not
[33:51] ever have known that it would come from
[33:52] or we may have never known before, never
[33:55] known again. But God sends these angels
[33:58] into our lives. these angels can be most
[34:02] certainly can be in the form of a human
[34:03] being to take care of us.
[34:07] Uh for tonight's service, I um Justin
[34:11] sent me a text and said, "Uh, hey, are
[34:13] you going to have another testimony
[34:14] service tonight?" And I said, "No, it's
[34:17] a communion service." I said, "Why?" And
[34:20] he said, "Well, I have a testimony that
[34:22] I'd like to give." I said, "You know
[34:23] what? Why don't you give it tonight?" I
[34:25] said, "I think it'd be a blessing. I
[34:27] think uh we've met Justin um once or
[34:31] twice he's started coming here and I
[34:33] think we all appreciate him being here
[34:36] but we I'd especially like to hear what
[34:39] maybe the Lord has placed on his heart.
[34:42] So, uh, Justin, if you come come up and
[34:44] and take your time and I'll fill I'll
[34:46] fill the rest of the time with my
[34:49] scriptures. And, uh, would be better
[34:52] probably to use one of these microphones
[34:54] here.
[35:11] Hey. Um, you wanted me to
[35:14] So, uh, the pastor told me he wanted me
[35:17] to give an account for when we first
[35:18] met. And, um, I think I'm going to go a
[35:21] little further and talk about the night
[35:22] before, uh, we met. Um, the night before
[35:27] we met, I'm not sure, but I was probably
[35:29] drinking, as was often in my life, uh,
[35:32] what I was doing at that time. And, um,
[35:35] it was hot. I lived close by, and I just
[35:37] had a swamp cooler, right? So it was um
[35:40] was you know spring or summer here. So
[35:42] 100 swamp cooler probably 120 in my uh
[35:45] apartment and I was dying in there and
[35:48] um you know me and me and a friend I was
[35:50] sleeping with um at the time casually uh
[35:54] we were just dying together. Neither of
[35:56] us could get any sleep. We were both um
[35:58] tormented and they were having anxiety
[36:00] attack after anxiety attack. And um you
[36:03] know I'd wake up and I'd see these
[36:05] shadows moving and um I I thought they
[36:08] were ghosts. I thought they were ghosts
[36:10] and I thought it was mental illness. And
[36:11] I know now those were the demons just
[36:13] dancing around us. Um, so you know, we
[36:17] don't get any sleep and uh we come out
[36:19] just drenched in sweat, you know,
[36:21] walking around Tucson trying to get out
[36:23] of that apartment and uh eventually we
[36:25] find our way here in front of the church
[36:27] uh loitering about and I was probably on
[36:29] my fifth cigarette dressed in leather
[36:31] and drenched in sweat talking to them.
[36:33] And the pastor, you know, pulls right up
[36:35] in the truck and he gets out, he says,
[36:37] "Hey, what are you doing here?" And I
[36:38] I'm immediately confrontational, right?
[36:40] I'm like, "Who is this guy? I don't even
[36:42] realize it's a church." And he's like,
[36:43] "Well, this is a church." I was like,
[36:44] "Oh, what am I doing? I'm I'm loitering
[36:47] in front of a church." And uh yeah, he
[36:49] says, I forget what he says, but he he
[36:52] approached me very um humbly, very
[36:55] generously, he asked, you know, are you
[36:56] religious? And I said, I believe there's
[36:58] something out there. And you know, we
[37:01] just started talking and um it's a
[37:03] beautiful thing. We started talking
[37:04] about believe I brought up Buddhism and
[37:06] all these religions I had been studying.
[37:08] And he said, "Hey, Jesus loves you." And
[37:10] um you know I didn't believe it at the
[37:12] time but thank God for the pastor that
[37:15] he told me the truth then
[37:22] um here's the testimony.
[37:32] Two nights ago I found myself unable to
[37:34] sleep. I was stirred by an intense
[37:36] discussion I had with my housemate and
[37:37] friend about the Quran and Telmood the
[37:40] differences in our teachings of and the
[37:42] differences in teachings of our faith
[37:44] and theirs and I worry deeply about our
[37:47] father's plans for me. It is said
[37:49] everyone to whom much was given of him
[37:51] much will be required. So, in the pride
[37:54] of my faith, I wondered about the
[37:55] rapture that can be upon us at any
[37:57] moment. And of the two witnesses that
[37:59] God will appoint, and I wondered, will
[38:01] those be prophets of the old generation,
[38:03] Elijah and Moses, or would it be men of
[38:06] this current age?
[38:08] The thought that God may call upon me to
[38:10] test to testify against the beast
[38:12] himself shook me, but not my faith. And
[38:15] in my bed, I told him, "Take it.
[38:18] Whatever you need, Lord, bind me in the
[38:20] chains. bind me in chains to this bed
[38:22] and burn the sin off my flesh. And I
[38:25] felt a great presence and a true ecstasy
[38:28] that brought me to tears.
[38:31] And I was so moved. I went outside
[38:33] unsure if I would see men floating in
[38:35] the air or not. And when I did not, I
[38:37] noticed I no longer hated anyone.
[38:41] Not the people I had been struggling to
[38:42] forgive in my imperfection. I no longer
[38:45] struggled with the burning lust and
[38:46] wrath I had burn I had before. And since
[38:50] that night, I won't say temptation
[38:51] hadn't hasn't returned. But even still,
[38:54] never without the answer of the Lord.
[38:56] The voice of Satan that crawls in my
[38:58] throat and burrows in my heart is
[38:59] immediately stolen away like the very
[39:01] breath of sin is being choked out. Here,
[39:04] while I'm writing this, I wonder if my
[39:06] account is too miraculous that you may
[39:08] all that you all may think me, a new
[39:10] believer, is engaging in religious
[39:12] fanaticism.
[39:14] But I say with everything I am, this
[39:16] account is true. I thank the Lord our
[39:18] God, our father, and I love you all.
[39:22] [Applause]
[39:34] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[39:36] Wow.
[39:37] He said a mouthful in just a few words.
[39:41] Talking about Revelation chapter 11.
[39:44] And I think that's an age old question.
[39:46] He's going to be
[39:48] a Elijah and Moses of the old or is this
[39:53] going to be men anointed with that
[39:56] spirit?
[39:57] And uh it's amazing that you saw that
[40:01] these two men because of the miracles
[40:03] that they did in shutting up the heavens
[40:05] and and um the uh the the same and the
[40:11] same miracles that Moses did and Elijah
[40:13] did that you identified them with these
[40:16] two these two men of Revelation 11.
[40:18] Doesn't say in the Bible that those are
[40:19] those two men. Amazing. see young man in
[40:24] Justin and how he loves the word. One of
[40:28] the things that when I first met him in
[40:30] front of a church here,
[40:33] I said, "Let me tell you a story."
[40:36] And I told him a Bible story and that
[40:38] kid locked on and he was listening to
[40:42] every word that I said. I can't remember
[40:45] which story it was, but I remember your
[40:47] reaction and how you loved the word. He
[40:52] just loved it. And it was in you. It's a
[40:55] gift in you that you have that you love
[40:57] that word. I have the same gift. I may
[41:00] not with me. I may not be a good
[41:02] speaker. I may not be anything else, but
[41:04] the gifts that I have is I love the word
[41:06] and I love God's people.
[41:09] And it's it's uh it's something that is
[41:13] rare and you should thank the Lord that
[41:14] you have it. Brought Mitchell with you.
[41:16] Welcome, brother. God bless you. It's
[41:18] good to have you. I was just asking the
[41:20] two there. I I was telling them about
[41:23] communion and and here's how we do
[41:25] communion. And um and I asked him, I
[41:30] said, "Are you Christians?"
[41:33] And uh I think Mitchell was was as
[41:35] concerned as like, "Well, I've never
[41:36] been to church here. Am I okay to take
[41:38] communion? And my answer is you are okay
[41:41] to take communion if you are a
[41:43] Christian.
[41:44] If you love the Lord Jesus. There was
[41:47] people the wonderful thing about the
[41:50] book of Acts and about the about the
[41:53] Bible is people came from all different
[41:57] walks of life and they came together.
[42:00] They looked different. They acted
[42:02] different. They dressed different. They
[42:03] were different colors. They were
[42:05] different races. But yet they could come
[42:08] together on this,
[42:11] the body and the blood of Jesus Christ.
[42:15] And it was through the ages that we have
[42:17] this in common. This is our foundation.
[42:20] And we can come and have visitors. And I
[42:23] can I can go across the world to another
[42:26] place in the world and I can go into a
[42:27] church, whatever church it is, as long
[42:30] as that church believes on the Lord
[42:32] Jesus Christ and I can take communion.
[42:36] with that church. It's beautiful. It's a
[42:39] wonderful thing that brings us together.
[42:43] I jotted down a few notes. I was
[42:48] just
[42:50] thanking the Lord for everybody,
[42:54] for our community. My son and I have
[42:56] been talking about how important a
[42:59] community is. How important we are to
[43:02] each other. How important it is when
[43:04] somebody just reaches out a hand of
[43:05] fellowship. No matter what you look
[43:07] like, no matter no matter what walk of
[43:09] life you are, when someone just reaches
[43:11] out that hand of fellowship and shows
[43:13] you some love, Justin, it means a lot,
[43:16] doesn't it? It's so important. And we
[43:19] should not friends take for granted what
[43:23] we have and that we have each other and
[43:27] the love that we have with each other
[43:30] from each other and for each other.
[43:34] I was as I was thinking that in the back
[43:36] and I was Josiah was in my office and
[43:39] and
[43:41] it just kind of came to me like this is
[43:45] what Jesus wanted. Jesus was a man. He
[43:48] was God made flesh.
[43:53] He wanted community. He wanted
[43:56] fellowship. He wanted communion.
[44:00] Towards the end of his life,
[44:03] Jesus
[44:05] got his disciples together.
[44:08] And the really the last prayer we we
[44:12] have, Jesus prayed on the cross that God
[44:14] would forgive the people that were
[44:16] murdering him.
[44:18] But we have this prayer that Jesus
[44:21] prayed
[44:23] for his disciples. I've read it before,
[44:26] but I think it's good to read again.
[44:30] Let's John chapter 17
[44:33] and let's start with
[44:38] let's start with verse seven because
[44:40] that's looks like that's when he um
[44:43] starts praying for his disciples. Now
[44:47] watch the love that Jesus has for his
[44:49] friends. Don't forget Jesus is a man.
[44:53] He's God made flesh. So he had feelings
[44:57] and he had friends and he had these
[44:59] friends that just meant so much to him.
[45:03] He says this,
[45:05] "Now they have known and and Jesus is
[45:08] praying." Now they have known that all
[45:12] things whatsoever thou hast given me are
[45:15] of thee. For I have given unto them the
[45:18] words which thou gavest me, and they
[45:20] have received them, and have known
[45:22] surely that I came out from thee,
[45:25] speaking to God, that I came out from
[45:28] thee, and they have believed that thou
[45:30] did send me, send me.
[45:33] I pray for them. Wow, look at this. He
[45:37] loves his friends.
[45:39] I pray for them. I pray not for the
[45:42] world but for them which thou hast given
[45:46] me for they are thine.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; After service when you got baptized
[45:51] Justin
[45:53] after service young Lydia
[45:55] came came to me. I had you I had you say
[45:58] it in church and she says you know I've
[46:00] been praying for Justin. We haven't seen
[46:02] him in a long time. She says, "I I I
[46:04] prayed for him and I pray that I prayed
[46:06] that he would be baptized
[46:08] just in the short time that you were
[46:10] here." Look at that spirit of Christ.
[46:12] And here's Jesus and he's he's saying,
[46:14] "I pray for them. I pray not for the
[46:18] world, but for them which thou has given
[46:20] me, for they are thine, and all are all
[46:24] mine are thine, and thine are mine, and
[46:29] I am glorified in them." And right there
[46:32] we see that Jesus Christ is none other
[46:34] than God. He is God in flesh. All mine
[46:38] are thine and thine are mine. Who could
[46:40] say that? And now I am no more in the
[46:44] world, but these are in the world. And I
[46:47] come to thee, holy father, keep through
[46:50] thine own name those whom thou hast
[46:53] given me that they may be one as we are.
[46:58] He's praying for his friends and he
[47:00] knows he's about to go and he's he says,
[47:02] "Lord, may they be one like you and I
[47:05] are one, Father. How much how much love
[47:08] we have for each other. May they have
[47:10] that same love.
[47:14] While I was with them in the world, I
[47:18] kept them in thy name. Those that thou
[47:21] gavest me, I have kept, and none of them
[47:24] is lost, but the son of predition, that
[47:27] the scripture might be fulfilled.
[47:29] And now come I to thee, and these things
[47:32] I speak in the world, that they might
[47:37] have my joy fulfilled in themselves.
[47:43] He wants his people to have this joy.
[47:46] And friends, if we truly understand
[47:51] what Christ is, if we truly understand
[47:54] who we are in believers of Jesus, then
[47:57] we should be filled with joy. And Jesus
[48:00] is saying if they would just have that
[48:02] same joy that I have.
[48:07] I have given them thy word and the world
[48:10] hath hated them because they are not of
[48:14] the world even as I am not of the world.
[48:17] I pray not that thou shouldest take them
[48:20] out of the world but thou but that thou
[48:22] shouldest keep them from evil.
[48:26] They are not of the world, even as I am
[48:28] not of the world. I like that.
[48:33] Sanctify them through thy truth. Thy
[48:37] word is truth.
[48:41] Remember this morning I talked about
[48:44] this sermon on the mount and he said,
[48:45] "Not one jot, not one tit will fail."
[48:49] And he's saying here that your word,
[48:51] Lord, is the truth. As thou hast sent me
[48:54] into the world, even so have I also sent
[48:58] them into the world. And for their sakes
[49:01] I sanctify myself that they also might
[49:04] be sanctified through the tr through the
[49:06] truth. Can you imagine
[49:10] Jesus said I purify myself not for me
[49:16] but for them.
[49:18] And friends, when we are praying,
[49:21] when we are living our lives outside of
[49:23] a outside of church and we see the
[49:25] mistakes that we make and we see the
[49:27] sins that we commit and and we say,
[49:29] "Lord, forgive me." But what we forget
[49:31] is, "Lord, I want to sanctify myself not
[49:35] for me. I want to sanctify myself for my
[49:39] friends that you might hear my prayer
[49:42] for the one that needs my prayer. That I
[49:44] might be able to witness. I might be in
[49:46] my right frame of mind. I might not be
[49:48] sinning but I might have given my heart
[49:50] to the Lord and I might be serving you
[49:52] not for myself but for someone else.
[49:56] And Jesus
[49:58] is saying here he says I sanctify myself
[50:02] that they also might be sanctified.
[50:06] Neither pray I for these alone but for
[50:09] them also which shall believe on me
[50:11] through their word.
[50:15] I take that as me too. Not just that I
[50:17] believe on the disciples word, but that
[50:20] others might also believe by my word,
[50:24] that I can witness to someone, that I
[50:26] can teach, that I could lead someone to
[50:28] Christ,
[50:33] that they may be one,
[50:36] as thou, Father, art in me, and I in
[50:38] thee, that they also may be one in us,
[50:41] that the world may believe that thou
[50:43] hast sent me.
[50:46] Their love for one another, their unity
[50:48] will show that I am Jesus Christ. I am
[50:51] the Christ.
[50:53] And the glory which thou gavest me, I
[50:56] have given them that they may be one
[50:59] even as we are one. I in them and thou
[51:02] in me, that they may be made perfect
[51:06] in one, that the world may know that
[51:09] thou hast sent me and hast loved them as
[51:11] thou hast loved me. Father, I will that
[51:14] they also whom thou hast given me be
[51:18] with me where I am
[51:21] that they may behold my glory which thou
[51:25] hast given me for thou lovest me before
[51:28] the foundation of the world. Lord, I
[51:31] want them with me. Lord, there's there's
[51:33] coming such a great time, a a a great
[51:36] wedding supper. There's going to be a
[51:38] heaven. And there's going to be there's
[51:40] going to be great things that I has not
[51:43] seen and ear has not heard. Lord, these
[51:45] things are going to be great. And I want
[51:47] my friends with me.
[51:50] Imagine Jesus. How much better it make
[51:54] makes things when we celebrate with
[51:56] someone else. Something good can happen
[51:59] to us. Rh. Yay. But something good
[52:04] happens to us and we can celebrate with
[52:06] each other. Oh, it makes it so much
[52:09] better.
[52:12] Where was I?
[52:16] Oh, righteous father. No, let's go back
[52:19] to 24. Father, let's read that one
[52:21] again. Father, I will also whom thou
[52:23] hast given me will be with me where I am
[52:26] that they
[52:28] may be behold my glory which thou hast
[52:30] given me. For thou lovest me before the
[52:32] foundation of the world. Oh righteous
[52:34] father,
[52:36] the world hath not known thee, but I
[52:39] have known thee, and these have known
[52:41] that thou hast sent me, and I have
[52:44] declared unto them thy name, and will
[52:47] declare it, that the love wherewith thou
[52:50] hast loved me may be in them, and I in
[52:55] them."
[52:57] How beautiful are the words, the last
[52:58] prayer of our Lord Jesus.
[53:02] I speak about that prayer a lot because
[53:03] it means so much to me. It's such an
[53:06] example. It's such an example to me as a
[53:08] pastor and loving this church. I want to
[53:11] see everyone saved. I want to see
[53:14] everyone prospering. As different as we
[53:17] all are, I want to see all of us there.
[53:21] And I believe you want to see all of us
[53:25] there. That's the spirit of Christ. We
[53:28] want to be together. We want that
[53:30] community. We want that community here
[53:32] on earth.
[53:34] And we also want there's something that
[53:36] desires that community because it's just
[53:39] a taste of what's going to be over on
[53:42] the other side here. What's going on now
[53:47] really is just a reflection of what's
[53:51] going on somewhere else.
[53:53] We believe that we are now somehow
[53:58] someway with the father
[54:02] because the Bible says Jesus talks about
[54:04] the children and he says right now they
[54:07] are with the father and there they are.
[54:10] And we believe that there is something
[54:12] we might we not understand it, but there
[54:14] is something that is leading us and
[54:17] influencing us to love one another and
[54:19] to want to get more and more in and
[54:23] bring people together. Like I quoted
[54:25] Charlie Kirk, let's make heaven crowded.
[54:28] And that's what a real Christian wants.
[54:31] We love that fellowship. We love that
[54:33] community. Listen
[54:36] to the Lord and how much it meant to
[54:38] him. Luke chapter 22.
[54:41] Now Jesus prays that prayer
[54:45] and then Jesus goes off to a place by
[54:48] himself in the garden of Gethsemane, not
[54:50] very far, just a stones throw away. And
[54:54] he goes off to pray.
[54:58] And he wants his friends to stay close.
[55:03] He doesn't want to go off totally off by
[55:05] himself. He wants his friends there.
[55:08] I'm sure it was a comfort to him. Luke
[55:11] chapter 22:4.
[55:15] And when he was at that at the place, he
[55:18] said unto them, "Pray that you enter not
[55:22] into temptation.
[55:24] And when he was withdrawn from them
[55:27] about a stones cast, and he kneel down
[55:31] and prayed, saying, "Father, he's in
[55:35] torment. He's in anguish right now. He
[55:37] knows that he is about to go to the
[55:39] cross. He knows that he is about to be
[55:41] betrayed. He knows that he's about to be
[55:43] embarrassed. He knows that he is about
[55:45] to be forsaken by everyone.
[55:50] It's not just dying.
[55:52] It's dying a horrible death. Not just
[55:56] the pain, but being forsaken by your
[55:59] friends. He knows they're all going to
[56:01] run away. Jesus knew the scriptures. He
[56:03] knew that they he would have he was
[56:05] going to have to be left alone.
[56:09] And here he is and he's down and he's on
[56:12] his knees and he's praying and he says,
[56:14] "Father, if thou be willing, remove this
[56:16] cup from me. I don't want to do this.
[56:21] This is going to be hard and I'm
[56:22] scared." Remember, he's only 33 years
[56:24] old.
[56:27] He's a He's
[56:29] He doesn't want it. The flesh in him
[56:32] doesn't want it to happen.
[56:35] But he says these wonderful words.
[56:39] He set himself aside and he says,
[56:40] "Nevertheless, not my will, but thy will
[56:44] be done."
[56:46] And then there appeared an angel unto
[56:48] him from heaven strengthening him. God
[56:52] sent a messenger to help him. But watch
[56:56] what Jesus wants even more than the
[56:58] angel.
[57:01] And being in agony,
[57:03] he prayed more earnestly. And his sweat
[57:06] was as it were great drops of blood
[57:09] falling down to the ground. And when he
[57:12] arose up from prayer, where did he go?
[57:15] He went to his disciples.
[57:18] You think maybe he wanted to see his
[57:20] loved ones?
[57:22] He wanted to maybe give them a hug.
[57:25] He wanted to maybe talk with them a
[57:27] little bit. Think about how much that
[57:29] community means to us when we're going
[57:32] through a hard time. How much does it
[57:33] help when somebody is there for me?
[57:37] When he rose up from prayer, he was come
[57:39] to his disciples and he found them
[57:41] sleeping for sorrow.
[57:44] And he said unto them, why sleep ye?
[57:46] Rise up and pray lest you enter into
[57:49] temptation.
[57:51] So he's saying, won't you pray? You're
[57:54] gonna you're going to fall into
[57:55] temptation, too. I need your help here.
[58:00] And while he yet spake,
[58:02] behold, a multitude.
[58:06] And he that was called Judas, one of the
[58:09] 12, went before them, and drew near unto
[58:13] Jesus, and kissed him.
[58:17] We see three different accounts in
[58:18] Matthew, Mark, and Luke. They each tell
[58:21] it a little bit different. I believe
[58:23] it's Luke is the only one that has the
[58:24] angel that comes to comfort them. But
[58:27] all of the other gospels say that he
[58:30] went back and he was he was disappointed
[58:34] that his disciples were sleeping. Why?
[58:37] He needed somebody to pray with him. He
[58:40] needed somebody to be there for him.
[58:41] This is the son of God. This is God in
[58:43] flesh. And still he wanted it. He wanted
[58:47] friends. He wanted community. He wanted
[58:51] someone there. And there is Peter and
[58:52] he's sleeping like I need some help. I
[58:56] need some love. I need some
[58:58] encouragement.
[59:01] And then he went back and he says,
[59:04] "Okay,
[59:06] sleep on." And times come anyways and
[59:10] here comes the torches.
[59:14] And they come and Judas identifies him
[59:18] to the soldiers.
[59:21] I believe it's the servants of the high
[59:22] priest. Jesus says, "The one I kiss is
[59:25] the one that you'll take." He gives goes
[59:29] up to Jesus and kisses him.
[59:32] And Jesus says,
[59:35] "Friend, you betray me with a kiss."
[59:38] Can you imagine your friend, someone you
[59:41] love, someone that you have spent your
[59:44] life training? Jesus knew who he was. He
[59:47] said that one of you is a devil. He knew
[59:49] who he was. But you don't think that he
[59:51] cared?
[59:52] Jesus cared for everyone.
[59:56] Jesus gave his life for the ones that
[59:59] killed him. If you don't believe me,
[1:00:01] read the gospels. When he's on the
[1:00:04] cross, father, forgive them for they
[1:00:07] don't know what they are doing.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; He went to the very cross to die for
[1:00:13] others.
[1:00:15] He loved. He loved like no one has ever
[1:00:21] loved in the history of the world did he
[1:00:24] love.
[1:00:27] And he prayed, "Lord, let them be where
[1:00:30] I am.
[1:00:32] Let them be with me, Father.
[1:00:36] When we go to this kingdom, Lord, I want
[1:00:38] them to be there.
[1:00:40] It's important enough to me that they
[1:00:44] go, that I will go to the cross of my
[1:00:47] own accord.
[1:00:50] I will let them spit in my face. I will
[1:00:54] let them forsake me. All the disciples
[1:00:56] took off running,
[1:00:58] scared. And there's Jesus left alone.
[1:01:02] And he goes to the cross
[1:01:04] for the very people that forsook him,
[1:01:07] for the very people that crucified him
[1:01:10] and the people really, there were some
[1:01:12] that really did love him and they just
[1:01:14] made a mistake
[1:01:17] when they took off running. That's what
[1:01:19] happened. And Jesus said before the
[1:01:22] night before or the same night that he
[1:01:26] was betrayed the same night he goes to
[1:01:30] the the bread
[1:01:34] and he says take this. He said do it in
[1:01:36] remembrance of me. I love you. Remember
[1:01:40] me. Don't forget me. And he says with
[1:01:43] the wine.
[1:01:45] He says drink this. This is my blood. He
[1:01:48] said do it in remembrance of me. So when
[1:01:51] we are doing this friends, we are doing
[1:01:54] the communion. We are we are doing this
[1:01:57] symbolism in remembrance of him and it
[1:02:00] brings our thoughts to him.
[1:02:03] I know it says let a man examine
[1:02:04] himself. We want to take this worthy. We
[1:02:07] want to do it right. But it's not about
[1:02:09] us.
[1:02:11] It is about remembering the one that
[1:02:13] died for us. Amen.
[1:02:17] It's beautiful.
[1:02:19] There has never been someone that loved
[1:02:22] like Jesus loved.
[1:02:25] He was the love of God manifested on
[1:02:30] earth. He was that very essence of God.
[1:02:35] He was He was
[1:02:39] When you read the Old Testament,
[1:02:41] you see this this God that is fearful
[1:02:46] and this God that that would just
[1:02:48] destroy
[1:02:50] for things, friends, that you and I both
[1:02:53] have done. And he just wipes it clean.
[1:02:57] But then we get to this man, Jesus
[1:02:59] Christ. And as God goes to wipe it
[1:03:01] clean, uh,
[1:03:04] he can't touch that perfect sacrifice.
[1:03:09] And here's Jesus saying, "Lord, they're
[1:03:12] mine.
[1:03:14] They're mine. I am that perfect
[1:03:16] sacrifice and I claim them." Just like
[1:03:19] he prayed. How beautiful. How beautiful
[1:03:22] are the words of Jesus. How beautiful is
[1:03:25] the love of Jesus. He was love. The
[1:03:29] Apostle John, he knew Jesus better than
[1:03:32] anyone. He was that beloved disciple
[1:03:35] that, you know, he wouldn't say his
[1:03:36] name, but he's like, you know, the one
[1:03:37] Jesus loved. It's like they all loved
[1:03:40] the disciples would be like, "Hey, they
[1:03:42] loved us, too." Well, you know, the one
[1:03:44] Jesus loved. I'm right. I'm the author.
[1:03:46] The one Jesus loved. And he said, he
[1:03:49] made this great statement. I love to
[1:03:52] quote it. Three words. God is love.
[1:03:57] And you know what? Jesus Christ
[1:04:00] is that embodiment of love. And what
[1:04:04] we're doing tonight is honoring him,
[1:04:07] remembering him through these
[1:04:09] ordinances. The brothers would come and
[1:04:12] we'll take the communion.
[1:04:14] As I said,
[1:04:17] the qualification
[1:04:20] for taking communion
[1:04:23] is that you have given your life to
[1:04:26] Jesus Christ, that you are a Christian.
[1:04:30] That's the same qualification that was
[1:04:33] here in the book of Acts. They brought
[1:04:37] Romans in as I talked about this morning
[1:04:39] with shaving the the sides of their head
[1:04:42] or or or dressing different or what it
[1:04:44] is whatever it was. They were different
[1:04:46] people came from different societies yet
[1:04:49] they came together
[1:04:51] in Jesus Christ.
[1:04:54] How beautiful how beautiful is this man
[1:04:58] Christ?
[1:05:00] 1 Corinthians
[1:05:03] chapter 11, the Apostle Paul speaking of
[1:05:06] the communion service.
[1:05:08] 1 Corinthians 11 verse number 23.
[1:05:13] For I have received of the Lord that
[1:05:16] which also I delivered unto you, that
[1:05:18] the Lord Jesus the same night in which
[1:05:21] he was betrayed took bread.
[1:05:24] And when he had given thanks, this is
[1:05:27] the last supper he's talking about. And
[1:05:29] when he had given thanks, he broke it
[1:05:31] and said, "Take, eat. This is my body
[1:05:34] which is broken for you. This do in
[1:05:37] remembrance of me." After the same
[1:05:39] manner also, he took the cup. And when
[1:05:43] he had sucked, saying, "This cup is the
[1:05:46] New Testament
[1:05:48] in my blood." I talked about the Old
[1:05:50] Testament this morning and how it
[1:05:52] changed when Jesus came. This is the new
[1:05:56] testament
[1:05:57] in my blood.
[1:05:59] This do ye as often as ye drink it in
[1:06:03] remembrance of me.
[1:06:06] For as often as you eat this bread and
[1:06:08] drink this cup, you do show the Lord's
[1:06:11] death till he come. Wow.
[1:06:16] As often as we are eating this bread and
[1:06:19] drinking this wine, as often as we are
[1:06:22] taking communion, we are honoring
[1:06:25] the crucifixion,
[1:06:27] death, sacrifice of the Lord Jesus until
[1:06:32] he comes.
[1:06:34] Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this
[1:06:37] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:06:39] unworthily
[1:06:41] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:06:44] and blood of the Lord.
[1:06:46] But let a man examine himself
[1:06:49] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:06:52] drink of that cup.
[1:06:56] You notice it says there I just in
[1:07:00] reading this right now. But let a man
[1:07:03] examine himself and so let him eat.
[1:07:08] He doesn't say
[1:07:11] examine yourself. Are you worthy or not?
[1:07:13] He says, "Examine yourself and eat.
[1:07:17] Get right and take this communion. But
[1:07:20] let a man examine himself and so let him
[1:07:23] eat of that bread and drink of that cup.
[1:07:26] For he that eateth and drinkkeeth
[1:07:28] unworthily eateth and drinkkeeth
[1:07:30] damnation to himself, not discerning the
[1:07:33] Lord's body." So he's saying, "Do this,
[1:07:37] but make sure you are making things
[1:07:40] right.
[1:07:42] For this cause, many are weak and sickly
[1:07:45] among you, and many sleep."
[1:07:48] Remember when Jesus said, "Father, I
[1:07:50] sanctify myself for their sake."
[1:07:54] When we are coming to church, when we
[1:07:56] are taking this communion, when we have
[1:07:59] sin in our lives, we are hurting others
[1:08:04] along with ourselves.
[1:08:06] For this cause, many are weak and sickly
[1:08:08] among you, and many sleep. For if we
[1:08:11] would judge ourselves, we should not be
[1:08:14] judged. But when we are judged, we are
[1:08:17] chasened of the Lord, that we should not
[1:08:20] be condemned with the world.
[1:08:24] Amen. We judge ourselves
[1:08:27] and when we are judged,
[1:08:30] we are chasened of the Lord. We see our
[1:08:32] faults.
[1:08:33] We make these things right
[1:08:36] so that we would not be condemned with
[1:08:39] the world.
[1:08:41] So, I go here
[1:08:46] and I look at this bread and I think
[1:08:50] 2,000 years ago they started doing this.
[1:08:53] And here we are,
[1:08:55] Tucson, Arizona, Sunday evening, and
[1:08:59] we're doing the same thing that they did
[1:09:01] when Jesus broke this bread and he said,
[1:09:03] "Now do this in remembrance of me."
[1:09:06] Don't forget me, friends. Don't forget
[1:09:08] me. don't forget what I did for you.
[1:09:13] He wanted us to be with him and he's
[1:09:15] saying don't forget me.
[1:09:20] His bread's broken
[1:09:23] as was the body of Jesus Christ.
[1:09:28] No piece is the same just as
[1:09:31] all of us are different. They're all
[1:09:34] when you take your piece, every one of
[1:09:36] them is different. Every piece is is
[1:09:37] different. Every piece has a different
[1:09:39] shape, a different size, slightly
[1:09:41] different color. Everyone is different.
[1:09:44] That's why we don't take wafers.
[1:09:46] We don't take these cookie cutter pieces
[1:09:49] of of uh leavenless bread
[1:09:54] because it's the body is different and
[1:09:57] it's all broken.
[1:09:59] And as you take this and you get your
[1:10:02] piece, you notice that you have got an
[1:10:05] individual piece. And this is your
[1:10:08] individual walk with the Lord. And you
[1:10:09] are doing this as an individual to come
[1:10:12] in communion with all of these believers
[1:10:14] in honor of the Lord. Let's bow our
[1:10:16] heads.
[1:10:18] Father, I hold this bread.
[1:10:22] It represents you, Lord. It represents
[1:10:25] your broken body.
[1:10:28] And Lord, we are honored that we can
[1:10:30] come together as Christians and we can
[1:10:32] take of this bread as you commanded us.
[1:10:38] And Lord, we humbly do it. We thank you
[1:10:41] for the opportunity. And Father, we ask
[1:10:43] that your blessings would be upon this
[1:10:46] bread as we take it to our lips and we
[1:10:50] chew it and we take it into our body.
[1:10:53] Father, may there be healing also in
[1:10:55] this bread. And And as I pray over the
[1:10:58] wine, may they also be there in Jesus
[1:11:01] name. Amen.
[1:11:05] The wine
[1:11:08] represents the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:11:10] It's red.
[1:11:12] It's
[1:11:14] alive.
[1:11:16] It has alcohol in it. It has what we It
[1:11:21] has a a living
[1:11:23] life that's there. Has the yeast in it.
[1:11:27] And it has it is it is it's alive and
[1:11:29] and it represents a living word. It
[1:11:32] represents a living sacrifice. Not
[1:11:35] something that is dead. It represents
[1:11:38] something that's alive.
[1:11:41] Jesus Christ is alive today. He spilled
[1:11:44] this blood out on the ground for me. And
[1:11:49] if it have only been for me, he would
[1:11:51] have done it. If it had only been for
[1:11:53] you, he would have done it.
[1:11:57] I take this personally.
[1:11:59] Lord, you did it for me.
[1:12:03] Lord God, I hold this wine in my hands
[1:12:07] representing your blood.
[1:12:10] I pray, Father, that your blessings
[1:12:12] would rest upon it.
[1:12:14] Lord,
[1:12:16] as with the bread also, may there be
[1:12:18] healing in this cup of communion. Lord,
[1:12:22] if there'd be somebody here
[1:12:25] that needs healing in their body,
[1:12:28] Father, I pray that as they drink this
[1:12:30] wine that that healing would be
[1:12:32] manifested.
[1:12:34] We thank you, Father, for this
[1:12:35] opportunity.
[1:12:37] Jesus name. May your blessings be upon
[1:12:40] it. Amen.
[1:13:01] [Music]
[1:13:05] The remainder of this bread as is
[1:13:07] tradition
[1:13:10] believe goes back all the way to the
[1:13:12] mana
[1:13:14] that was in the wilderness as the
[1:13:16] children of Israel wandered and God
[1:13:18] provided for them. The remainder of this
[1:13:21] bread, so it doesn't spoil,
[1:13:24] will be burned or consumed for the dawn
[1:13:27] of another day.
[1:13:30] Thank you. Thank you, brothers.
[1:13:41] Can you imagine
[1:13:45] the weary traveler
[1:13:47] way back in the book of Acts?
[1:13:50] Can you imagine coming from a long way
[1:13:53] away,
[1:13:56] walking in to a church
[1:14:00] and them saying, "Come in, pilgrim. Come
[1:14:03] in. break the bread with us, have the
[1:14:07] wine with us in honor of our Lord and
[1:14:09] this being done all over the world and
[1:14:12] just spreading. I was I was I knew a I
[1:14:15] met a person down in the south of
[1:14:17] Mexico.
[1:14:19] He was dying of cancer
[1:14:23] and it was cancer in his nose and it had
[1:14:26] gone up and they couldn't operate on it.
[1:14:29] They couldn't do anything about it. And
[1:14:31] and he worked for a Ford Motor Company.
[1:14:36] He wasn't a Christian. He didn't know
[1:14:38] anything about the Lord. And every day
[1:14:40] when he was walking home, he was walking
[1:14:43] by this building. He would walk by this
[1:14:45] building. And inside that building,
[1:14:49] he would hear music coming. He would
[1:14:51] hear singing,
[1:14:53] singing about the Lord Jesus.
[1:14:57] and he had gotten fired from his job
[1:14:59] because he could no longer perform his
[1:15:02] work because of his cancer.
[1:15:06] And he was sad and and walking home and
[1:15:10] and he come he came to that door and it
[1:15:13] must have been a Wednesday night and he
[1:15:15] heard that music coming from inside the
[1:15:18] building inside on the other side of the
[1:15:20] door and he stopped
[1:15:24] and maybe it was that song. song. I
[1:15:26] don't know what song it was, but Josiah,
[1:15:27] maybe it was that song that you were
[1:15:28] just singing. There is a fountain filled
[1:15:30] with blood. Let's say it was
[1:15:33] hearing that song. There is a fountain
[1:15:35] filled with blood flowing from Emanuel's
[1:15:38] veins.
[1:15:40] And he stopped. All was lost in his
[1:15:46] life.
[1:15:48] All hope was gone. He had a family to
[1:15:51] support. He was suffering with the
[1:15:54] cancer.
[1:15:57] And with Jesus, friends,
[1:16:00] he brings hope. No matter how bad things
[1:16:04] are, no matter how destitute, no matter
[1:16:07] what it looks like that nothing can
[1:16:09] happen, when you accept Jesus Christ and
[1:16:13] when you truly see him for what he is,
[1:16:17] there is always hope.
[1:16:21] and he heard that music and knocked on
[1:16:24] the door.
[1:16:26] Remember I said the weary traveler
[1:16:28] coming through and them serving him.
[1:16:32] He came, he walked in, he was weeping
[1:16:35] and he said, "I don't know what to do."
[1:16:38] And they said, "Come in. Come in."
[1:16:41] And he said, "I'm dying of cancer. I
[1:16:44] just lost my job. I can't perform my
[1:16:46] duties anymore." He says, he says, "I
[1:16:48] don't know what to do." And these people
[1:16:51] inside said, "Did you know God heals the
[1:16:54] sick?"
[1:16:57] And there was hope started to come in.
[1:17:01] There was maybe not for me, but there
[1:17:05] was a little hope that came in. They
[1:17:08] said, "Come in. Come in and worship with
[1:17:10] us." And he walked in there and they
[1:17:12] sang songs and they worshiped the Lord
[1:17:14] and they read the word. And then he was
[1:17:17] so uplifted and he went home and he was
[1:17:21] he was praying. He said, 'Lord, what can
[1:17:23] I do? Lord, this is this is just so
[1:17:26] wonderful.
[1:17:28] And he went into the bathroom
[1:17:31] and he went to his sink and he blew his
[1:17:34] nose and out came the cancer
[1:17:38] and he Yeah.
[1:17:45] And he told me, I believe he said, and I
[1:17:47] I was probably there in 2012, 2013. I
[1:17:51] believe he told me, "Brother, that was
[1:17:52] 10 years ago. I've never had a treatment
[1:17:54] before. I got my job back at the Ford
[1:17:56] plant." And now that man is a pastor,
[1:17:59] and he is praying for other people with
[1:18:02] this, presenting the same God that
[1:18:05] healed him.
[1:18:08] After supper being ended,
[1:18:12] John chapter 13 verse two and supper
[1:18:15] being ended,
[1:18:17] devil having now put into the heart of
[1:18:19] Judas's carrot, Simon's son, to betray
[1:18:21] him. Jesus knowing that the Father had
[1:18:24] given all things into his hands and that
[1:18:27] he was come from God and went to God,
[1:18:32] he riseth up from supper
[1:18:35] and laid aside his garments and took a
[1:18:37] towel and girded himself. And after that
[1:18:41] he poured water into a basin and began
[1:18:43] to wash the disciples feet and to wipe
[1:18:46] them with the towel wherewith he was
[1:18:48] gerted. Wipe them with the towel
[1:18:50] wherewith he was gerted. Then cometh ye
[1:18:52] to Simon Peter. And Peter saith unto
[1:18:55] him, Lord, dust thou wash my feet? And
[1:18:58] Jesus answered and said unto him, What I
[1:19:01] do, thou knowest not now, but thou shalt
[1:19:04] know hereafter? And Peter saith under
[1:19:06] him unto him, Thou shalt never wash my
[1:19:08] feet.
[1:19:10] Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not,
[1:19:14] thou has no part with me.
[1:19:18] And then Simon saith unto him, I think
[1:19:21] all of us would say the same thing. Then
[1:19:24] Simon,
[1:19:26] Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet
[1:19:29] only, but also my hands and my head. And
[1:19:32] Jesus saith unto him, he that wash he
[1:19:35] that is washed needeth not saved to wash
[1:19:38] his feet, but is clean every went, and
[1:19:41] you are clean,
[1:19:43] not all.
[1:19:45] For he knew that who should betray him?
[1:19:48] Therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.
[1:19:52] I appreciate brother John answering that
[1:19:55] question for us. He's talking about
[1:19:57] Judas's care. But Peter was clean. Peter
[1:20:01] was clean because of Jesus Christ.
[1:20:07] So after he had washed their feet and he
[1:20:11] had taken his garments and was set down
[1:20:13] again, he said unto them, "Know ye what
[1:20:16] I have done to you.
[1:20:18] Ye call me master and lord."
[1:20:21] And ye say well, for so I am.
[1:20:26] If then your Lord and Master have washed
[1:20:29] your feet, you also ought to wash one
[1:20:32] another's feet. For I have given you an
[1:20:34] example that you should do as I have
[1:20:36] done to you. Verily, verily, I say unto
[1:20:39] you, the servant is not greater than his
[1:20:41] Lord, neither is he that is sent greater
[1:20:44] than he that sent him. So, he's saying,
[1:20:47] listen, you're not greater than me, and
[1:20:50] I'm doing this to you.
[1:20:53] If you know these things,
[1:20:56] happy are you if you do them. And that's
[1:21:00] why we continue on with this tradition
[1:21:02] of washing feet.
[1:21:05] It's another thing that we do in
[1:21:07] remembrance of what Jesus said. And he
[1:21:10] said, "I did this to you. Now you do
[1:21:12] this to one another." So we wash each
[1:21:15] other's feet as we would wash Jesus's
[1:21:18] feet and as he would wash our feet.
[1:21:20] Amen.
[1:21:23] So, the men will go up to the upstairs
[1:21:26] chapel and uh brother Arie, which way
[1:21:29] are we going to go? Are we going to go?
[1:21:32] We'll follow the brothers will follow
[1:21:34] the other brothers and the sisters will
[1:21:37] go into the fellowship hall and let's
[1:21:40] all stand. Tony, would you come and
[1:21:42] close in prayer, my friend?
[1:21:56] [Music]
[1:22:04] Let's bow our heads.
[1:22:09] Dear heavenly father, thank you for
[1:22:11] allowing us to be here, Lord, and you
[1:22:14] being in our presence tonight.
[1:22:18] Thank you for your sacrifice and that
[1:22:20] cross, Lord. And thank you
[1:22:23] as we as we eat and drink in remembrance
[1:22:26] of you tonight, Lord. And as we go forth
[1:22:29] and we wash each other's feet in
[1:22:31] remembrance of what you did to the
[1:22:33] disciples, Lord, we we give you thanks,
[1:22:38] Lord. May you be with us tonight and
[1:22:40] through the rest of this week, Lord, to
[1:22:42] guide us
[1:22:44] and be with us, Father.
[1:22:46] In your name we pray. Amen.
[1:22:52] [Music]
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise be to God. Amen.
[1:23:01] He is good, friends. He loves us and we
[1:23:04] love him. And now we get to do just this
[1:23:07] little act of serving one another and
[1:23:10] washing each other's feet that
[1:23:12] represents something great that Jesus
[1:23:14] did. thousand years ago. You're
[1:23:17] dismissed. The sisters into the
[1:23:19] fellowship hall, the brothers upstairs.
[1:23:21] God bless you.
