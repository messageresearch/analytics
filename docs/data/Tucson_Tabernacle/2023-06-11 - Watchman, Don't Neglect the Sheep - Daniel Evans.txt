your seats thank you I am had a good day yesterday we brother brother Lyle and brother Arnie and I went to a Minister's meeting up in Phoenix and it was uh to me it was the best one that I've been to it was uh see the numbers have dwindled a little bit but we still had probably 20 or 30 maybe more of the pastors and ministers from around the state but felt a real Unity among the brethren and and I felt something that I felt like it's it's been just building over the past couple years and that that's getting away from these doctrines and these these things that separate us and and coming together in the love of Jesus Christ and it just yesterday it struck me that that uh it didn't strike I had the feeling that this is the direction that we're going and I I really believe that it pleases the Lord and moving towards one common goal and that common goal is getting the people ready for the coming of our Lord Jesus that's what brother Branham came here to do it's what every true Minister comes to do every servant of the Lord every Prophet that's come from from Adam all the way to now has been to prepare the people for the coming judgment and I just felt good yesterday I felt like like there was a Unity among the brethren Hey Brother Wilson good to see you next time I want you to go it'd be good to have you to go um I uh I see some walls just coming down bless me brother Caleb Duran reached out to me this morning I really just appreciate him and what what he's what he and brother Steve Robson have done in organizing this having the vision for it and it's been just a real success and I've been to many of them around the world this has been a very successful appreciate brother McGarry opening up his church yesterday and and just as I said I come home with just a good feeling brother Lyle mentioned to me yesterday that today we don't know the exact date it's it's either June June 11th or June 18th that brother Branham was baptizing on the Ohio River and there's a series of events that led up to this that you might not know about brother Branham was helping a a man a Baptist Minister named Roy E Davis Dr Davis well-educated man uh very popular among the Baptist circles way back then brother Branham as a very very young Minister was helping him and the church burned down and brother Branham in his gracious and sweet way he never mentioned really this he hadn't mentioned through just in passing that that the church had burned down but but what happened was when this church burned down this pastor just up and left and he moved to Texas and left the congregation there so brother Branham this young man with very very little experience and and pastoring a church he sets up a tent on Spring Street in Jeffersonville I think it was on Spring Street I could be wrong but I think it was starts having Church starts having a Revival and for two weeks this revival goes on and there there there's new converts coming there's people coming so on this day that this this Sunday 90 years ago as I said it's either June 11th or June 18th 90 years ago this day marks he was there baptizing on the Ohio River a man name I believe his name was Calvin brother Branham a young man brother Branham was baptizing him the 17th person that he was baptizing and we know the story that a supernatural like came down in a voice spoke whether the people heard it we don't know but brother Branham heard it and it said this as John the Baptist was sent the forerun the first coming of the Lord your message will forerun the second it always struck me that that The Voice didn't say you it said your message we know that God has taken that that messenger home but we see in brother Branham this message that he brought this message of reconciliation he said one time this message of love this message of introducing Jesus Christ to the world the same message that John the Baptist preached that he introduced Jesus Christ to the world and we need to get back to that message of introducing Christ and we see what happened what followed brother branham's Ministry and the Miracles and all the great things that happened all too introduce Christ to a Dying World as I was thinking about that brother Lyle after you told me that I was thinking about that last night I was thinking what if he wouldn't have what if he wouldn't have set up that tent what if he would have just threw his hands up in the air and said the church building's gone I'm just going to go to work and I'm going to make a living what if he wouldn't have done it what would have happened to those people that were there at that time they didn't have a place to congregate it didn't have a pastor that didn't have a group that we we have today and that group that he had was much smaller than this so they a little while later a few months later maybe a couple months later they laid the Cornerstone on the Branham Tabernacle at 8th and Penn Street and I think wow that was it's a great thing that happened but what if he wouldn't have done it I am Daniel and I we had as I've mentioned it a few times we we started a Ministry in Jeffersonville this ministry was was to um some of the more downtrodden folks downtown and around the Louisville area and in Jeffersonville and and um what happened was my brother Adam and I we had we had our kids and and uh we saw that I felt like they weren't they weren't there was they were missing something in their life we kept them at home and and we did our best to to shelter them from the world we Stephanie she did a wonderful job in homeschooling our children and and we tried to just keep them around the best of kids and and just did our best but there was something missing in our kids lives and my brothers was was talking to his his son was just playing video games all day and and didn't have much to do and he he told me he said then I got I got to do something so we he brought his his kids to this boxing gym and I said well I'd like Daniel too Daniel needs it I saw the kid out there riding his bike every day and and jumping on the trampoline and and trying and he just he was a gifted athlete and trying to get that out of him and and I just felt like it would be good for him to to get out and to do some more so we we signed him up for this boxing gym and and downtown New Albany and and of course being the athletes that they are they just shot to the top and quickly outgrew that that Jim so then we brought him to a real boxing gym these were these had professional fighters in it and it was just it was a terrible atmosphere just cussing and and the the way the women looked that were always in there it was just and and the drugs and everything about it was just like Lord we're putting our our kids in this Lord help us out so one day the coach he comes to my brother and his name's Jeremy and he said he says you know he says your kids Daniel and Benjamin and Joel are two are his two my brother's two kids he says they're really gifted they're really good he said I want to break off from this gym and he said I want to form a a gym with with just this other this other young man named Deshawn who is a professional heavyweight boxer and tremendously gifted young man he says I want to take DeSean and I want to take your three kids and I want to form a boxing gym with them being the foundation and he said I want to make it a Ministry he says I want to get these kids closer to the Lord it was an answer to our prayer we were doing our best we were trying to be the best parents that we could trying to protect our kids but we saw that that we were going too far on this side they needed they needed that interaction they had to have that so so then the Lord knew our hearts and he placed this in front of us and we started this gym in downtown Jeffersonville started to grow and then it kept growing then um this this Jeremy he he asked me or Adam my brother said well talk to Dan about the ministry thing so so we started I said well let's have a Bible study so we started out with just a handful of kids not they're not kids I mean DeSean was 30 years old or so and uh we started doing this Bible study and it started to grow and it kept growing more people started hearing about it and it kept it kept growing and we saw parents start to come and and pretty soon we see one of the mega churches around they said we believe in what you're doing we want to support it they donated an 800 000 building and two hundred thousand dollars to renovate it hundreds over a hundred boxers best record in the tri-states too not I'm not talking about the worldly things but we were the best we had the best record of any gym in in Southern Indiana and Northern Kentucky we were the best because we put the Lord first and we kept on with this Bible study and even after I moved to Tucson I hired a um a young lady she was a she was in the army and she wanted to move from Indianapolis to Tucson so she contacted me saying within the USGS contacted me and said hey my husband's moving I would like to I would like to go there we so I interviewed her and I and she says I said well what do you like to do on your on your spare time she says I'm a boxer I was like oh okay well she's an army person and a boxer um feel bad for a husband so they don't want to get I'm going to get in the middle there if they ever get crossed but but I said oh yeah I said we started a gym in Southern Southern Indiana and she said what's his name I said JC boxing Jesus Christ boxing JC boxing it's all it's uh what is it really Jeff Jeff city boxing but we always called it Jesus Christ boxing so so she said oh she said you guys are the best she said my she said everybody knows about your gym and how good you all are so we kept getting better and better and and and this gym just kept kept expanding based with the foundation of this Bible study and many not only the kids not and there were no kids like I said they were these were professional boxers many of them but their parents their moms gave their hearts to the Lord their dads and it's still happening now my brother told me he did bible study on Wednesday night he said Dan we had 70 people in our in our Bible study teaching these kids well this past week that heavyweight I was talking about tremendous boxer died in his sleep his name's DeShawn and I don't know if it's a braid brain bleed from the boxing or whatever it was died his son he left two children two boys behind two young boys he died and Adam told me about it and he said on this this past Wednesday he said he was he was torn up about it as everybody as everybody was and he said he says I'm gonna I'm gonna tell him tell the boxers the fighters about this and they already knew but he says I'm gonna he said Dan I'm gonna tell him you gotta get right so my brother he uh he talks about about the Lord Jesus and he says why do you think we're even here and and I thought the same thing and Adam Adam asked me he says he says did I say enough to him and I thought to myself did I say enough to DeSean where is that young man today I don't know I don't I hope you're right but when we when we present this did we do enough did in in presenting the gospel to these kids was I firm enough in my sermons that I preached to them was Adam was he firm enough was he reaching out enough that young man there's no more repentance in his life his time is over he met the judge when he died or whether he will meet the judge in the future he will meet that judge and where does he stand and I think the same as me standing in this pulpit here it's hard for me I I I don't know why I do that but what's coming forth am I giving enough am I being am I being good enough in saying what this word means or is this is just a watered-down religion in a place you go to church on Sunday is it making any difference in your life did it make any difference in that young man's life he was a Christian he confessed it and he spoke many times he was the most respected guy in the gym and I think did did it make didn't make enough of a difference and I stand here this morning and and I'm going to read a scripture if I can get enough nerve to read it I'll read it towards the end of the of the service that's very sobering I was talking with a brother as a friend the other with a friend about when he was young just a kid in junior high and he said there's these two kids that that got new dirt bikes and they were they got on the dirt bikes and they were riding and and he knew that that down down the road there there was a wire that went across a cable that went across it was dangerous the young man he's just a little boy and maybe didn't think to say anything and he was in his house and he looked out the window just in time to see the boy in the dirt bike going down and hit the cable kill them instantly saw it as a brother was telling just tears in his eyes and said what couldn't I have just done more soon I'm just say I wish I would have just said something and this is a regret that he's had his whole life there's nothing he could have done of course not he was a kid but that regret is still there even today I look at I look at my own life and I see how many times I've regretted not doing something how many times have I regretted reaching out it's very rare but I've regretted many times not I was walking I was traveling for work like 20 years ago and I was in the city of Portland I was by myself I was in meetings there and I and I would get out of the meetings and go back to the hotel and and I got I went back to hotel and I and I walked out and I was going into the Rose Garden in Portland and there was a there was a mall there and I was walking towards the mall to get something to eat and this obviously sick Young I'd say 25 Maybe your old man long hair thin was walking like this obviously in a lot of pain back then 20 years ago I knew exactly what it was I was walking this way he was walking this way I took a breath and I held my breath and I walked by him he says can you help me I said I said no and I kept walking and he said I'm dying of AIDS he says there's anything you could do I just kept walking deep regret why did I not turn around and pray for that man why didn't I turn around and say brother the Lord Jesus this life is fleeting this life just lasts for a little bit of time but if you know the Lord Jesus you'll have eternity in in a wonderful place I has not seen the joy that you will have I look back at that time 20 years ago why didn't I say something I regret it to this day I got back I got back to my hotel and I remember I I repented and I went out and I tried to find the man I couldn't find him failed I never I never want to fail I never want to be in that that position again not for my own good what about DeSean The Boxer where is he where is that man that I walked by both of them I prayed for but where are they today I don't know but it wasn't because that I didn't do enough Maybe there's a story in your Bible you all know it in Luke chapter 10 there was a a lawyer an expert in the law and he asked Jesus he says what do I need to do to inherit eternal life Jesus said responds he said love the Lord God with all of your heart and he says love your neighbor as yourself and this man probably didn't he probably didn't appreciate what Jesus said he probably wanted to maybe trap him or try to bait him into making a mistake and he says what is loving your brother or loving your neighbor he says what does that even mean and this man was an expert in the law Jesus as was his way and his I love let me tell you Jesus Christ is everything if you take this whole world it's a song but give me Jesus he is just if we can just get to him Jesus tells the story he says sorry he says there was a man that was beaten and robbed they stole everything from them they even stole his clothes beat him to the point of his death and there's the man laying on the ground and here comes a priest walking by sees the man goes to the other side of the road walks by doesn't even want to be around him what did I do priest goes by a priest should know better then here comes a temple worker a levite he sees the man laying there he looks on him walks over the other side of the road walks on leaves him there to die doesn't care then here comes a man not even from that town a man from Samaria this Samaritan he comes in and he takes the man picks him up he goes to the end he gets a room he takes wine to to to um for antiseptic for his wounds washes him up cleans his wounds takes oil rubs it on his wounds so that he might not be in as much pain there's not even a dialogue between the Samaritan and the man we don't even know what they said we don't even know if the man was conscious takes him in tells The Innkeeper he says listen the next morning he spends the night with the man taking care of him the next morning he says he goes to the Innkeeper and he says he says listen he says whatever he needs he says here's two days wages if you make fifty thousand dollars a year it's like 400 bucks he says here's two days wages he says give him whatever he needs he says then if he needs more give it to him and the next time I come I'll pay you for it didn't even know the man who was more of a servant of God was it the priest was it the pastor that walked by that said I don't want anything to do with him was it the temple worker today be a trustee or a deacon or whatever it is was it one of those or was it this man that we don't even know where he's from not even from the Jewish religion a Samaritan coming and helping this man and who was right Jesus asked him the the lawyer the expert in the law he said who was the neighbor to answer your question the lawyer says well it was the Samaritan he says right and he says you do the same we heard that story but put yourself in there I think about all that we're doing and I think about this this young man DeSean that that died Daniel used to box with him Daniel was a sparring partner and uh lighten it up a little bit he didn't want a box Daniel very much anymore because Daniel was tearing him up Daniel got good and uh he um I think about think about him this kid I loved him how many how many conversations have I had with him talking about the Lord his kids coming in and and and talking with us and he had this little Bulldog that was the cutest dog I've ever seen those slobbery little dog and it was just it was so cute and and we just we just loved him but I think where is he what have I done did we plant enough of a seed in his life what did he know Jesus that's everything did he have that relationship with Christ you can come to church you can you can be part of a group but do you know Christ it doesn't do any good the priest that walked by the the man on the street who was more right did he know did he know God himself are we introducing people to the Lord Jesus he is everything let's turn to John chapter 4 I'll read a scripture just just once one scripture and I'll have a few more John 14 6 Jesus says this he says I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me I am the way the truth and the life no man comes to the father except by me I hear I hear so much in today's religious societies I hear so much oh it's it's just between you and the Lord you have your own way you have your own religion you have your own way of contacting God that's a lie that is false there is only one way to come to the father that scripture I just read is it only through Jesus Christ it wasn't through Moses it wasn't through the law it wasn't through Elijah it wasn't through John the Baptist it wasn't through brother Branham it wasn't through it wasn't through any of that it was through Christ and him alone and all of that was to point us to Christ he is the only way and if you're Mormon or Jehovah Witness or Muslim or Hindu or whatever it is you have to come to the same Christ that we have to come to and if you're going trying to go some other way you're not going to get there only through Christ there is one mediator let's let's Farm to turn to First Timothy chapter two I exhort therefore let's we'll start with verse 5. for there is one God and one mediator between God and Men the man Christ Jesus not Abraham as I said not Moses not Elijah not anyone else Jesus Christ and him alone who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time none of those men that I said could give their life none of those men was Worthy to be that sacrificial lamb Christ gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time to be testified at the proper time and that time is now it's now for all of us wherein to I am ordained a preacher the Apostle Paul's speaking where unto I am ordained a preacher and an apostle I speak the truth in Christ and I lie not a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and Verity and faith and Truth he is as I said he is everything every sermon I said it on Wednesday night every sermon in every epistle from Acts all the way through revelation every sermon is about one man and all the prophets pointed to that one man and that man is Christ and we have to know him personally everyone in this room we have to know him a friend of mine a dear friend someone who I I rely on a lot his name is Caleb Caleb Perez from he's a pastor in Las Cruces dear brother his brother preached will will Perez the other day here and he's just been he's been a just a good friend to me he's been a pastor for a long time and in talking with him he and and just fellowshipping as Brethren and and there's certain things that we don't want to do I didn't want to in Portland I didn't want to talk to that man walking by me there are certain things that we don't want to do in life and brother Caleb answered this he says if not you then who if not you then who and then you think well I will sometime and he says if not now then when those words ring in my mind all the time I think about them it is our job to cast this net as in the Bible the parable he said You cast the net and it goes out and it goes down and it it lays down upon the floor of the the creek or the the Pond or whatever it is my cousin used to do it on the Ohio River he had this big cast net and he'd throw it out and it would go down and he'd pull that thing in and you never knew what was going to come in there were snakes there was these eels these nasty looking slimy little eels that would come up there was Turtles snapping turtles come up and sticks rocks it just things would come in but there was some fish and that's what Jesus said he says when you cast The Net you you pull in Turtles and these different things but there are some fish in there and those fish Jesus said to Peter I will make you a fisher of men and I I think that there's there's also the parable of of the sowing the planting the seed I believe it's in Matthew 13 where where this man was was seeding his field and he has all these seeds and and he's going out and he's he's sowing these seeds and some of those seeds they fall on the trail on the road and the birds come and the birds eat them and then other seeds he throws them out and they fall in the in the bushes and the thorns and and those those Thorns they just they they cover them up when the seed sprouts and don't let it grow and then there's other places if he throws it on the side that it lands in the rocks and the rain comes and some of these seeds and the thorns and these seeds and the Rocks they'll pop up but then when it dries out a little bit they wither and they die and they just blow away but then there are other seeds that fall out on this fertile ground and when the rain comes they sprout up and they grow and those seeds that that are in that are come in in the thorns and the bushes many times that's that's our environment that we're in and we're just like when I was trying to put Daniel in these this boxing gym it was just a bad environment how can you grow in a bad environment how can how can that that sunlight hit you when you're covered with thorns and thistles you can't and it just it just dies or just it never grows but then there is a crop in that sun light comes down and it it grows and then Jesus said and it multiplies a hundred fold so you have one grain of corn you put it in there and all of a sudden when the Harvest is you have 100 grain you have a hundred of these grains or more and it multiplies but it has to we have to be as as we as Believers we have to be sowing these seeds and throwing these out and we don't know sometimes it'll fall on the road it's okay sometimes it'll fall out in the bushes it's okay but if we keep doing it it's going to grow it's going to take root the same thing throw the net just keep doing it you'll get fish think about and planting these seeds let's let's read some of the word Romans chapter 10. verse 12. for there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek for the same Lord over all is Rich unto all that call upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved what is the name of the Lord uh what is the name of the Lord Jesus for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved how then shall they call on him who they have not believed and how shall they believe in him who they have not heard how many people have not heard about a Christian Life how many people have not heard that Jesus Christ died for their sins and how shall they hear without a preacher I'm not talking about the guy in this Pulpit all the time I'm talking about all of us we are ministers to this world in whatever capacity the lord has laid out and how shall they preach except they be sent that is as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things it's all with our lord Jesus it is all positive but they have not obeyed the gospel for Isaiah said Lord who hath believed our report and he's talking about he says they have not all believed to have heard and he's quoting back to Isaiah chapter 53. the Apostle hears is quoting Isaiah 53 Isaiah 53 is a prophecy of Jesus Christ coming so then faith so we know that this is about the Lord Jesus so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God that's that's old English the the Amplified Bible says this so faith comes from hearing what is told and what is heard comes by the preaching of the message concerning Christ so Faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of God you know what how important as I said that this isn't how shall they hear without a preacher I'm not just talking about me standing in this pulpit all of us we go out into this world there should be an atmosphere around us all the time Jesus had an atmosphere such a strong atmosphere that if someone would just touch His Garment they would be healed they said no one of them said no you don't have to come into my house you just say the word my servant will be healed that's such an atmosphere around him Peter when he received that Spirit of Christ he had that same atmosphere to where he would walk by and just his shadow if the people could just get in his shadow they would be healed such an atmosphere and that's how we should be brother Branham said this think about as I read this quote think about yourself brother Brown says this and did you know you are a little Creator yourself did you know that certainly you've seen people that you just love to be around you don't know why just that loving type of person have you seen that just as kind there you like being around him they created that Atmosphere by the life they live the way they talk their conversation how many want to be like that then you've seen those every time you shun them all time they want to talk about something evil and talk about somebody say oh my there they come they're going to criticize somebody there he's in here now he's going to talk about this man all they're going to do is tell dirty jokes or something about women or or say something like that you just hate to get around them see they create seemingly pretty nice people but they create that atmosphere and the things that you think on the things that you do the actions the things you talk about creates an atmosphere so what atmosphere do you create in your life when you walk into a room when you talk to somebody What atmosphere are you creating What Spirit are you bringing into that room What Spirit are you bringing into that conversation friends I when I say this I'm thinking about what's on the other side what's on the other side for each person in this room what's on the other side of the river for DeSean what's on the other side of that River for that man in Portland that I talked to what's on the other side of the river for our children for husbands for wives what's on the other side it's important that we we talk about these things oh Ezekiel chapter 33 Lord give me strength to read this when I when I look at this word I think this is judgment here for communion it says let a man examine himself so let us judge ourselves concerning this again the word of the Lord Ezekiel speaking again the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man speak to the children of thy people and say unto them when I bring the sword upon the land if the people of the land take a man of their coasts and set him for their Watchmen if when he seeth the sword come upon the land he blow a trumpet and warn the people then whosoever Hearth the sound of the trumpet and taketh not warning if the sword come and take him away his blood shall be upon his own head he heard the sound of the trumpet and took not warning his blood shall be upon him that he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul so you hear Brethren be careful watch yourself watch your life examine yourself because the enemy is coming but if the Watchman see the sword come and blow not the trumpet and the people be not warned if the sword come and take any person from among them he is taken away in his iniquity but his blood will I require at the watchman's hands so thou no son of man I have set thee and Watchmen under the house of Israel therefore Thou shalt hear the word of my mouth and warn them from me when I say unto the wicked old Wicked Man Thou shalt surely die if thou Dost not speak to warn the Wicked Man from his way that Wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will I require at thy hand so who dies the man the sinner dies and this one the one that doesn't warn nevertheless if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it if he do not turn from his way he shall die in his iniquity but thou has delivered thy soul therefore o son of man speak unto the house of Israel thus ye speaks saying if our transgressions and our sins be upon us and we Pine away in them how shall we then live say unto them as I live saith the Lord God I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked God doesn't want anyone to die God wants everyone to come to the Lord but that the wicked man turned from his way and live turn ye turn ye from your evil ways for why will you die O ye House of Israel you know we move there's a move in the in in message ranks just stay home just separate yourselves just stay in your home don't go outside stay away from this wicked world just protect yourself don't worry about anybody that that's in the grocery store or Walmart they're heathens anyways they're just Sinners just protect yourself and and and don't mix with them how does that line up with this scripture what about that soul of that person that you come into contact with what about that person you will be guilty of not saying not telling them about the Lord Jesus skip to verse 30. also thou son of man the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses and speak one to another everyone to his brother saying come I pray you and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the from the Lord and they come unto thee as the people cometh and they sit before thee as my people they're sitting there they're listening and they hear thy words but they will not do them for with their mouth they show much love but their heart goeth after their covetousness and lo Thou Art unto them as a very long very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice and can play well in an instrument for they hear thy words but they do not they do them not and when this cometh to pass Lo it will come then shall they know that a prophet has become been among them let's go to chapter 34. verse 1. and the word of the Lord came unto me saying Ezekiel again speaking son of man prophesy against the Shepherds of Israel prophesy and say unto them thus saith the Lord God unto the Shepherds woe be to the Shepherds of the flock to the Shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves should not the Shepherds feed the flock you eat the fat and you clothe you with wool you kill them that are fed but you feed not the flock the diseased have you not strengthened neither have you healed that which was sick look at the Samaritan look at what he did he he cared for the wounds neither have you bound up that which was broken he set the the injuries on the man neither have ye brought again that's which was driven away neither have you sought that which was lost but with force and with cruelty you have ruled them and they were scattered because there was no Shepherd and they became meat pray to all the beasts of the field when they were scattered my sheep wandered through all the mountains and upon every high heel yea my flock was scattered upon all the face of the Earth and none did search after them none did search or seek after them where are we are we searching out for that lost soul that lost sheep therefore ye Shepherds hear the word of the Lord and I know he's hitting the pastors as I live saith the Lord God surely because my flock became prey and my flock became meat to every beast of the field because there was no Shepherd neither did my shepherd search for my flock but the Shepherds fed themselves and fed not my flock therefore all you Shepherds hear the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord God behold I am against the Shepherds and I will require my flock at their hand and cause them to cease from feeding the flock neither shall the Shepherds feed themselves anymore if I will deliver my flock from their mouth and they shall not be meat for them then the Lord goes on in Ezekiel and he as always the Lord is so encouraging breaks us down but then he says I'm going to be their Shepherd I'm still they're mine they are God's predestinated before the foundation of the world I'm gonna take care of them but for you who didn't do it you're going to answer brother Ernie that's why one of the phone number for the brother I want to do my part if we if there's anything that we can do I wanna I Wanna Be There I want to reach out if someone needs something Lord as Isaiah said he said Lord send me I'm not worthy but send me think about again in closing back to DeShawn and obviously it's been heavy on my heart did I do everything that I I could have done no I could have done more and we will always say that I understand but in our lives those start with those that are around us what more can I do for the mothers and the dads for the children raise them so that they know this word admonish them be careful son be careful daughter because if you get too far into this you're gonna you might not make it all the way out think about think about that person the musicians can come and I think about Jesus came he died on the cross he was there he was spread out nail nails hammered in his hands Nails in his feet the son of God there and here he is up on the cross died for people that don't really care us how much do we really care how much do we really think about that man that was raised up that died for us do we really care about what he did there's a story that I tell about a judge about how a sinner person that that committed a crime committed a sin let's say that this person [Music] did something dirty filthy got arrested for it maybe on a computer or something like that got arrested for it and that person goes before the judge [Music] say in the arraignment goes before the judge and the judge reads the judge reads the the charges he says you did this and you did this and you did this and you did this and it was on your computer maybe you stole a bunch of money embezzled money or did something worse or whatever it is you did this here it was it was on your computer and you're and you're standing there and then someone else comes and says walks into the courtroom says no judge actually I gone to his computer computer and I did that I'm the one that's guilty and you look and you know what you did you know you committed the crime and you look and here is someone that that has never committed a crime in their life that's never done anything wrong and this man is saying no I'm the one that committed this crime and you say but you didn't I did and he stands before the judge and he says no judge I did it I'm the one that's guilty of this filthy crime I will suffer I will stand before the world and I will will be ridiculed made fun of I will do it because judge I committed that crime you look at him judge looks at you and he looks at this other person here that's taken your place you know what the judge said [Music] the judge said okay he said Joe you're not guilty killed him this one that took your place this one that took my place kill him the Father the judge said that you can see why why Jesus then they put him up on the cross and nailed him up there's blood spilling out on the ground because of me because of my sins there it is piled up on the ground the sacrificial lamb that never did anything wrong up there for me Daniel Evans if it's not for any of you is for me that he was there how many things have I done wrong and here he is hung out on the cross and he says this he said you can see why he said his father why have you forsaken me the father's there you did it you will answer for every sin and here the guilty one me I just get to walk free it happened that's what it crosses for it happened for me every sin that you've created that you've done it lays on him if you will just accept him and I think about these people that have gone Lord did they really accept him [Music] did they accept that sacrifice do you understand what it means and he's up there on the cross and even to this day do people really care [Music] do we really know what he did for the individual not for someone else but for me do I understand what the Lord did for me to understand what Christ did for me and yet maybe I'll go to church today you know maybe I'll make a big effort get out of bed this morning and go to church maybe I'll witness to someone you know tell them tell them about Jesus oh yeah I'm a Christian but do you have that atmosphere do you have that Holy Spirit that same Spirit of Christ do you friends I would be not doing my job think about it what separates us What Separates Me from the world when I go somewhere do I look like the world do I act like the world so there's no difference in me than than this world do I take on the the look and the actions and the talk do I look like this world that's around or is there something special about me that people want to come to look at my little sweetheart there she she goes and she's a nurse and people they don't know her but why would they ask her to pray for them fault because she doesn't she looks like a Christian she looks different but Andy when you and I when we go to work there should be something about different about us [Music] that atmosphere that we create it should be representing Christ does it does it in your life the stakes as I read in Ezekiel the stakes are very high they're high for all of us these are perilous times this is the end I told the story beginning about fore running the second coming of Christ and look at all the signs that we see all the filth in the world it's never been this film [Music] look at I mean the obvious things you know we see that we try to we might talk about the I mean filth but are we reaching out to people brother Arnie was we were talking yesterday and there was a there was a young man that came in his name's Alex and he came in he sat in the back brother Arnie had witnessed to him [Music] he listened to the sermon I walked back there he says brother I need to talk to you he says what you said in your sermon is exactly what I've gone through he said he said already over there he said he witnessed to me he says I was just walking by and he invited me in and he said here I am everybody left the the congregation but Arnie and I came up here we knelt down right here on this platform we prayed for the young man when it was a couple months ago brother Hardy was in the back seat we were driving yesterday and brother Arnie's weeping and he says well where did he go he's not he hasn't come back since we prayed for him see the burden of the holy spirit in brother Arnie calling out to that to that other person that just needed it he wanted so bad that burning desire brother Arnie we placed it in the hands of the almighty God these hands will fail just because he hasn't shown up it doesn't mean that we didn't go before the father and bring this young man to the Lord God heard those prayers God's watching that man wherever he is whatever he's doing he came through the Teen Challenge then he slipped back somehow he's walking by the church and he met a man of God came in here not done with this altar prayed for him praise God that we have that opportunity [Music] this is the end time [Music] who knows how long we'll be here we have to friends we if we look like the world if we act like the world if the world is our desire let me tell you as a minister of the Gospel there is something wrong in your life but then there is that tender heart says Lord what that man said I need the Lord I'd rather have that tender heart than I would to be that Pharisee or that that priest that walked by that man laying on the on the side of the road and I look and I'm guilty I've done the same thing [Music] but that cold Stony heart I would rather be brother Arnie I would rather be that street walker drug addict whatever it is and have a desire to serve God than I would to be that priest that didn't care and when I say when I'm talking about this I I hear that well it would be nice if you preach more about this or more about that I'm preaching I'm doing my best for this congregation what this congregation needs [Music] we need more of a desire to serve God we need to talk to him all these other things these rules and regulations are good that's fine but we need Christ let me tell you if there's a desire in your heart to serve him and you act on that desire he will answer I promise you amen is there a desire friends is there a desire in anyone here let me tell you there's a desire in my heart I think about how I short I come think about one of us what a sinner I am and all the things that I do wrong and I think about that man on the cross I think about what he did for me think about that judge that judge that looked down looking down at me all of these sins every single one of them will send me to hell eternal separation from God torment demons awful there he is man on this cross and he said I did it he said Daniel Evans isn't guilty he says in fact he never sinned he said this guy right here has never done anything wrong he said I'm the filthy one Jesus Christ the Lamb of God said I'm the filthy one taken taking my nails taking my torment going before the father going up on the cross saying I did it but thank God he did I'm not worthy but I'm thankful Lord I lay my sins freely upon the Lamb of God thank you all I can say is thank you Lord I can't I can't do anything to deserve it the only thing I can do is I can say Lord I'll serve you the rest of my life thing that I can I ask you insincerity if you are not where you should be with the Lord then you need to make a move DeSean was a young man the Lord took him like that who knows how many of us are going to be here tomorrow and then that time is up that time of repentance you'll never get it again you think where will I go when I come before that judge and I don't have the blood his blood on me the only time I have to do it is now if I don't have his blood on me if he didn't stand for me because I didn't just make this simple the simple move of saying Lord I'll serve you I'm going to do my best from here on out the time is coming I pray that every one of us here knows and you're welcome to come to the altar you're welcome to pray in your seats I'm just telling you [Music] as a warning the Lord laid it on my heart we need to be careful because it's time the Lord may come for me today tomorrow it may come for you today may come for you tomorrow and then the time of repentance is over when I come before the judge the man on the cross stood for me and I thank God for him he took the filth that is Daniel Evans Amazing Grace says he's saved a Wretch like Me [Music] their heads bowed praying [Music] sinner I prayed you come to Christ and every one of us we dedicate Our Lives to the Lord today open up our hearts to his gospel don't be like the world separate yourself from the world don't look like the world don't act like the world it's not worth it come to Christ [Music] Lord Jesus Lord I even have trouble saying your name how good you are Lord not worthy I'm not worthy to say it no dear Lord I love you so much you give my heart to you Lord I pray that each person in this audience if there would be something [Music] that Satan is trying to keep them from you Lord I pray that you would tear
