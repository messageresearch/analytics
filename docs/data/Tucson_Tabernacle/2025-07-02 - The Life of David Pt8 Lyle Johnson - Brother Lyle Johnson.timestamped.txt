[12:12] Amen. That great one
[12:14] came down on a cross.
[12:17] Amen. Glory to his name.
[12:20] Down at the cross where my savior died,
[12:23] I believe is a son. Get the words up to
[12:26] them.
[12:28] Down at the cross. Glory to his name.
[12:38] Oh, down at the cross where my Savior
[12:43] died.
[12:45] Down where for cleansing from sin I
[12:49] cried.
[12:51] There to my heart was the blood of
[12:58] glory
[12:59] to his name.
[13:04] Glory
[13:06] to his name.
[13:11] Gloryy
[13:13] to his name.
[13:18] There to my heart was the blood applied.
[13:24] Glory
[13:26] to his name.
[13:31] And I am so wondrously
[13:34] safe from sin.
[13:38] Jesus so sweetly abides with him.
[13:44] There at the cross where he took me in.
[13:51] Gloryy
[13:52] to his name.
[13:56] singing gloryy
[13:59] to his name.
[14:04] Gloryy
[14:05] to his preious
[14:09] name.
[14:10] There to my heart was a blood applied.
[14:17] Glory
[14:19] to his name.
[14:24] Oh precious fountain that saves from
[14:28] sin.
[14:30] I am so glad I have entered in
[14:37] there. Jesus saves me. He keeps me
[14:42] clean.
[14:43] Gloryy
[14:45] to his name.
[14:50] Glory
[14:52] to his name.
[14:57] Gloryy
[14:58] to his name.

[15:10] Gloryy

[15:17] Oh precious pound
[15:20] saves from sin.
[15:23] I am so glad I have entered in
[15:30] there. Jesus saves me. He keeps me
[15:34] clean.
[15:36] Gloryy
[15:38] to his name.
[15:42] I'm singing gloryy
[15:44] to his name.
[15:49] Gloryy
[15:51] to his name.
[15:56] There to my heart was a blood.
[16:02] Glory
[16:04] to his name.
[16:09] there to my heart, was the blood
[16:12] applied. He didn't say, "Well, not until
[16:15] you're this good can I apply the blood."
[16:18] He said, "I'm going to apply the blood
[16:20] because you can't be that good, but I
[16:22] can wash you and clean you." What What a
[16:25] wonderful savior, isn't he? And you
[16:27] know, it makes me want to see him. Oh, I
[16:30] want to see him. I want to see his face.
[16:33] The one who died for me. Amen.
[16:40] As I journey through the land, singing
[16:44] as I go,
[16:47] pointing souls to Calvary
[16:50] to the crimson flow.
[16:53] Many arrows pierce my soul from
[16:57] withoutin.
[17:00] But my Lord leads me on. Through him I
[17:04] must win.
[17:06] Oh, I want to see him. Look upon his
[17:11] face
[17:13] there to sing forever
[17:16] of his saving grace.
[17:20] And on the streets of glory,
[17:23] let me lift my Lord.
[17:26] cares I'll pass home at last ever to
[17:31] rejoice
[17:33] when in service for my lord dark may be
[17:38] the night
[17:40] but I'll cling more close to him he will
[17:44] give me light
[17:45] [Music]
[17:47] snares may vex my soul turn my thoughts
[17:51] aside
[17:53] but my lord goes ahead
[17:56] ends well every time.
[18:00] Oh, I want to see him look upon his face
[18:06] there to sing forever
[18:10] of his saving grace and on the streets
[18:14] of glory.
[18:16] Let me lift my bones.
[18:20] Cares all pass. Oh, my last ever to
[18:24] rejoice.
[18:26] When in valleys glow, I look towards a
[18:31] mountain high.
[18:33] And behold my savior there. He's leading
[18:37] in the fire.
[18:40] With a tender hand outstretched with a
[18:44] valley,
[18:46] he's guiding me. I can see as I onward
[18:51] go and oh I want to see him look upon
[18:58] his face
[19:03] of his saving grace and on the streets
[19:08] of glory
[19:10] let me lift my voice
[19:13] cares all pass home at last ever to
[19:18] rejoice
[19:20] when before he bellows rain from the
[19:24] mighty day.
[19:27] Then my Lord direct my bark. He does
[19:31] safely king
[19:33] and he leads me gently on through this
[19:38] world below.
[19:40] He's a real friend to me and oh I love
[19:45] him so.
[19:47] Oh, I want to see him. Look upon his
[19:52] face.
[19:54] There to sing forever
[19:57] of his saving grace.
[20:00] On the streets of glory.
[20:04] Let me lift my voice.
[20:07] Cares all past home at last ever to
[20:12] rejoice.
[20:14] And oh, I want to see him look upon his
[20:19] face
[20:21] there to sing forever
[20:24] of his saving grace.
[20:27] On the streets of glory,
[20:31] let me lift my voice.
[20:34] Cares all pass home at last ever to
[20:39] rejoice.
[20:42] Let's give him praise for that. What a
[20:44] wonderful thing.
[20:46] I appreciate that. And you think you
[20:50] want to see him, he's longing for you
[20:52] more than you could ever imagine. He
[20:55] says, "Come unto me and I will give you
[20:58] rest. He'll be your peace." Amen.
[21:02] Lord, I lift your name.
[21:05] Start with the chorus.
[21:08] Lord, I lift
[21:11] your
[21:12] name.
[21:15] your holy
[21:18] name.
[21:22] [Music]
[21:33] You're the great high,
[21:40] the risome,
[21:46] my comfort
[21:51] and king. Verse one.
[21:58] And Lord, my heart can go
[22:04] so far away and cold.
[22:10] And yet your love for him is still the
[22:16] same.
[22:22] Lord, I bend my knee
[22:27] in awe and fear of thee.
[22:33] My head bowed down
[22:36] in reence to your name.
[22:44] Lord, I lift
[22:47] your name.
[22:50] You're holy,
[22:56] Jehovah
[23:00] God.
[23:02] Hall him.
[23:07] You're the great
[23:10] I
[23:12] am
[23:14] the risen
[23:18] lamb.
[23:20] I comfort
[23:23] your
[23:25] and king.
[23:31] And Lord, my heart's divine
[23:37] is to be filled with the spirit's fire.
[23:43] My purpose is
[23:46] to worship you
[23:49] alone.
[23:54] Yes. Open up my soul
[24:00] to worship and
[24:03] adore.
[24:06] to be a fragrance
[24:09] offered to your throne.
[24:16] Lord, I lift your
[24:20] name,
[24:22] your holy

[24:29] Jehovah

[24:39] You're the great high
[24:44] amfort.
[24:48] [Music]
[24:56] One more time. The chorus. Lord,
[25:02] Lord, I lift your
[25:07] name,
[25:09] your holy
[25:12] name.
[25:15] Jehovah
[25:18] God.
[25:20] Hall him.
[25:26] You're the great higher
[25:30] am.
[25:48] Amen.
[25:50] Sister hope. Good to have you on the
[25:52] organ. God bless you, Josiah and Katie.
[25:55] I think they make good music together.
[25:57] What do you think?
[25:59] I was
[26:02] uh today, usually on Wednesdays, I talk
[26:04] to my brother Adam and it's between he
[26:09] just finishes his Bible study that he
[26:13] teaches and then I'm about to go to
[26:15] service. So, we usually have about a 30
[26:17] minute or so conversation.
[26:21] And I was telling him some of the things
[26:22] that had happened to me today and um
[26:26] just dealing with some different people.
[26:29] And I told him, I said, you know, we
[26:31] have to be careful,
[26:34] but we ask for
[26:36] because we want to see things happen.
[26:39] We want to see prophecy come to pass. We
[26:44] want to see
[26:46] we want to see the Lord move.
[26:49] But many times when we ask for something
[26:55] and we get what we ask for, it's really
[26:58] not what we wanted.
[27:01] And as I was telling Adam these stories
[27:03] today that that had happened to me with
[27:06] some of the the brethren not from this
[27:08] church.
[27:10] Um Adam told me he said he says you know
[27:14] he said Dan I I'm really careful
[27:18] about what I pray for. He said for the
[27:21] very reason that you just said. He says
[27:23] I don't want to just ask the Lord for
[27:26] certain things. He said, "Because he
[27:30] might give me what I ask for
[27:32] and it might not be his will and it
[27:35] might not be good."
[27:38] And I want to encourage the church for
[27:40] all those that are here present tonight
[27:43] and those that are streaming in, always
[27:46] be careful what you pray for.
[27:50] You we are approaching God.
[27:55] When we say we pray in the name of
[27:57] Jesus,
[28:00] we are praying on his behalf.
[28:04] If we pray on in if we do something in
[28:06] someone else's name, we are doing it on
[28:08] their behalf.
[28:11] So when we go to prayer, we are going
[28:13] before the father in the name of the son
[28:16] and we bring these petitions before the
[28:19] lord. I talked last
[28:23] Sunday night about
[28:27] don't just
[28:29] when you're praying, don't just waste
[28:31] time. Have a purposeful prayer when you
[28:35] pray. When you get down,
[28:39] have in your mind, Lord, this is my
[28:43] need. This is this is what I want to do.
[28:46] Lord, I or or sometimes he, as I said,
[28:48] sometimes he just calls you and you just
[28:50] want to worship him and pray.
[28:53] But there must be a purpose there when
[28:55] you pray.
[28:57] And be careful, friends, of what that
[29:01] purpose is.
[29:04] Because God many times will give us what
[29:08] we want even though it's not what he
[29:10] wants, even though it's not his will,
[29:14] but he will allow things to happen
[29:17] because it is our desire. And many times
[29:20] we make it happen
[29:22] over his wishes, over his desires. we
[29:25] will make something come to pass. And
[29:29] when we get outside of God's will,
[29:31] everyone suffers.
[29:34] So, always use caution. Remember,
[29:39] you're going to the Lord in the name of
[29:42] Jesus Christ.
[29:44] Not in on not on behalf of Jonathan
[29:46] Gonzalez
[29:48] or Kle Salazar. You are going on behalf
[29:52] of Christ.
[29:55] and you bring your petitions to the Lord
[29:57] in that way. Always pray, friends.
[30:00] Always pray that God's will be done.
[30:04] Lord, here's what I feel. Here's what I
[30:08] desire, but Lord, most of all, I want
[30:11] your will. When Jesus himself at the
[30:15] garden of Gethsemane,
[30:17] he prayed,
[30:19] "Lord, let this cup pass from me.
[30:24] I don't want to die. I don't want to do
[30:27] these things. Lord, let this cup pass
[30:30] from me. But nevertheless,
[30:34] thy will be done." And that's how we
[30:38] should pray, friends, that not my will,
[30:41] Lord. Here's what I think to the best of
[30:44] my earthly understanding. Here's what I
[30:46] think, but Lord, I place it into your
[30:48] hands in the name of Jesus Christ that
[30:50] your will would be done. And I believe
[30:53] that way if we could do that, we'll see
[30:55] a lot more prayers answered. Let's all
[30:58] stand and I'll read the prayer requests.
[31:01] [Music]
[31:05] Sister Denise and family, it's good to
[31:06] see you back there. God bless you.
[31:11] Sister Amelia writes this.
[31:14] She says, "My new coworker is asking
[31:18] prayers for his 14-year-old daughter,
[31:21] Emma.
[31:24] She took a lot of pills and tried to
[31:26] kill herself,
[31:29] but she lives.
[31:34] Sister Millia. Where's Sister Ameilia?
[31:37] But she lives. She took a lot of pills
[31:40] and tried to kill herself.
[31:44] Oh, and she lives in uh in this place.
[31:47] So, please please pray for that that uh
[31:51] woman. Emma is her name.
[31:55] Now, it's a tough place
[31:58] when you don't see any hope and you want
[32:01] to take your life.
[32:03] I pray that the Lord will show this lady
[32:06] hope and give her give her the
[32:08] understanding that there is a God in
[32:09] heaven that loves her and that can
[32:11] answer prayers. And brother Ly
[32:15] writes, "Plea, please pray for our son
[32:17] James.
[32:19] He had an accident resulting in a deep
[32:21] cut in his left hand. He had surgery
[32:24] today and the doctors said the nerve
[32:27] damage is worse than they thought. He is
[32:31] in significant pain. So please pray for
[32:34] both James
[32:36] and sister Ununice Deeds writes this.
[32:38] She says, "Pray for my my new friend
[32:41] Anna. Her husband has a terminal illness
[32:45] and is not doing well. Also, she desires
[32:49] a home church."
[32:51] Sister Unice, I can imagine
[32:54] terminal illness and how much a church
[32:56] would mean and really how much your
[32:58] friendship, I'm sure, means to her
[33:00] because you give her hope because you're
[33:01] pointing to a living God. Amen.
[33:06] And uh also
[33:08] I'd like to ask the church
[33:12] to remember Sister Mercy Zamarano.
[33:16] Tomorrow she will be 97 years old.
[33:20] Give him sister mercy cla.
[33:22] [Applause]
[33:27] She's been in the tabernacle since the
[33:28] 1960s.
[33:31] She testifies that she was the first
[33:33] person baptized in Tucson by brother
[33:35] Green. God bless you, Sister Mercy. We
[33:38] love you. Appreciate your testimony and
[33:42] your standing with the faith all these
[33:44] years. Brothers and sisters, remember
[33:50] if you raise your hand and you know I'm
[33:52] going to ask you to raise your hand if
[33:54] you have a if you have a request on your
[33:55] heart if you raise your hand raise your
[33:59] hand in the name of Jesus Christ and and
[34:03] say Lord here is my request I give it to
[34:07] you in the name of the son of God. So if
[34:09] you have a request upon your heart make
[34:11] it known before the Lord with an
[34:13] uplifted hand. Our
[34:16] father,
[34:19] Lord, you are great and you are
[34:21] wonderful.
[34:24] And Lord, we sing songs of praise to
[34:26] you. Just just knowing that you are the
[34:30] creator. And Lord, not only are you the
[34:32] creator, but you are also our savior.
[34:36] You came down
[34:38] and a man gave your life for our sins.
[34:42] Lord, we are grateful.
[34:45] Father, these prayer requests,
[34:48] we bring them before you in this name of
[34:50] Jesus Christ
[34:52] and ask that you would provide healing
[34:56] of the soul through the for the one who
[34:59] is has wayward thoughts, Lord, and and
[35:02] would want to take her own life.
[35:05] And Lord, for the the sister
[35:09] that her husband's in a dire condition
[35:13] and Lord, she's looking for a place to
[35:15] fellowship.
[35:17] Father, we ask for mercy on her husband.
[35:20] If it be in your will, Lord, terminal
[35:23] illness is nothing for you. That that
[35:25] you would heal him. And Father, that you
[35:28] would give her a place of fellowship,
[35:30] whether it be here or somewhere else, a
[35:32] place where she would be happy, Father,
[35:34] and a place where she could draw closer
[35:36] to you,
[35:38] Brother Lyle.
[35:41] Father, we we pray for his son that puts
[35:43] in their prayer requests and
[35:46] ask that you would heal his hand,
[35:48] Father. May it may it heal quickly.
[35:51] And Lord, we pray for Sister Mercy,
[35:56] 97 years old. Father, I got a grandma
[35:58] that's about that age and it's it's it's
[36:01] a hard time because the body,
[36:04] Lord, there's pain and there's difficult
[36:06] times, but pray for her on her birthday,
[36:10] Lord, that you would encourage your
[36:11] heart. And every hand that was raised,
[36:15] Lord, we raised our hands in the name of
[36:17] Jesus Christ. Now Lord, we place it into
[36:19] your hands and we ask these things again
[36:23] in the name of our savior, name above
[36:26] every name, name of our lord and savior
[36:29] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[36:31] [Music]
[36:40] as brother Dan was talking about our
[36:43] prayer request and just brought me to
[36:45] mind of the the young man that told his
[36:48] dad, he says, "I I think if you'll give
[36:50] me my my portion, I'd like to go out and
[36:54] and live my life." And dad said, "Here,
[36:57] take your portions." And it wasn't too
[37:00] long after that that he was found
[37:02] himself in a place he never thought he
[37:03] would be. Amen.
[37:05] But this was also as I was thinking of
[37:07] that but his father was looking down the
[37:10] road waiting for his return
[37:13] because when he started returning it
[37:16] says his father was looking at him
[37:18] coming. So he was expecting him to come
[37:21] back. When the son come back he came
[37:24] back in a whole different attitude. Lord
[37:26] I've I've made a mess in my life. I'm
[37:29] not even worthy to be called your son
[37:30] again. And he said no you're still my
[37:32] son. We may may make us make a mistake
[37:35] and we make a mess in our lives, but he
[37:38] won't turn you down. Amen. I appreciate
[37:40] that. Amen. Reach out and touch the Lord
[37:44] while he's passing by. Sometimes we put
[37:47] them too far away, but he's willing to
[37:50] draw close.
[37:52] Oh, reach out and touch the Lord
[37:58] as he passes
[38:01] by.
[38:03] You'll find he's not too busy
[38:09] to hear your heart's cry.
[38:14] He's passing
[38:16] by this moment.
[38:18] Your needs to supply.
[38:24] Reach out and touch the Lord
[38:29] as he
[38:31] go. Maybe reach out this way right now.
[38:35] Reach out and touch the Lord
[38:40] as he passes
[38:43] by.
[38:45] You'll find he's not too busy
[38:51] to hear your heart cry.
[38:55] He's passing
[38:58] by this moment.
[39:00] your needs to supply.
[39:06] Reach out
[39:08] the Lord
[39:11] as he
[39:13] goes by
[39:16] because touching Jesus is all that
[39:19] really matters before our brother Lyall
[39:22] comes up.
[39:24] Oh, touching Jesus
[39:28] is all that really matterers.
[39:36] Then your life will never be
[39:41] the same.
[39:46] There is only
[39:50] one way to touch it.
[39:57] Just believe
[39:59] when you call on
[40:02] his name. One more time.
[40:06] Oh, touching Jesus
[40:10] is all that really matter.
[40:17] Then your life will never be
[40:22] the same.
[40:28] There is only
[40:31] one way to touch him.
[40:38] up
[40:41] when you call on his name.
[40:48] Touching Jesus
[40:51] is all that really matters.
[40:59] Then your life will never
[41:03] be the same.
[41:09] There's only
[41:12] one way
[41:14] to touch him.
[41:19] Just believe
[41:21] when you call on his name.
[41:26] [Music]
[41:29] Thank you so much.
[41:31] Is that where we are tonight? believing
[41:34] when we call on his name.
[41:40] Tonight,
[41:42] with the Lord's help, we'll continue our
[41:44] study of David as king. The story
[41:47] segment tonight centers on Abselum's
[41:50] rebellion. It's a tragic story. It's
[41:53] familiar to most of us, but within it, I
[41:57] find a tremendous message of
[41:58] encouragement.
[42:00] We'll be focusing again on the story as
[42:02] related in the book of 2 Samuel,
[42:04] summarizing as well as a fair amount of
[42:07] reading and looking at a psalm
[42:09] specifically associated with this event.
[42:12] Tonight's psalm, though it's one of the
[42:15] shortest, it reflects some amazing
[42:18] qualities of David's character, what's
[42:21] in his heart.
[42:23] As we begin tonight, let's just join one
[42:25] more time in prayer, believing when we
[42:28] call on his name.
[42:30] Lord Jesus, we believe tonight. Help our
[42:33] unbelief, Lord, as we call on your name.
[42:36] Lord, that you'd be present at the
[42:38] reading of your word, Lord. That you'd
[42:39] speak to hearts, that you'd answer
[42:41] questions, that you'd meet needs. Lord,
[42:44] forgive us, Lord, in every place that we
[42:46] have fallen short today, Lord. Keep our
[42:49] thoughts harnessed and focused on you.
[42:52] Thank you for this opportunity we have
[42:54] to gather together, not being forced
[42:56] together, but gathering of free will,
[42:58] Lord, the free will. agents that you've
[43:00] made us that we can be together with our
[43:02] brothers and sisters. How our hearts
[43:04] long for these times, Lord, when we can
[43:06] be together to worship you, to hear from
[43:10] you, to read your word, to sing, to tell
[43:13] you how much we love you, Lord Jesus. We
[43:16] commit the remainder of this service
[43:17] into your hands. Have your will. Speak
[43:20] to our hearts. Draw us close. We ask in
[43:23] Jesus name. Amen.
[43:28] For our opening scriptures on this
[43:29] portion of David's life, let's read from
[43:32] two places in the New Testament.
[43:36] The first is about a similar event or
[43:39] action. The second is about a a state or
[43:43] a condition of relationship with the
[43:45] Lord. First in Luke 19
[43:49] starting at verse 37, Jesus is traveling
[43:55] from Bethany to Jerusalem.
[43:58] The day is what we call Palm Sunday.
[44:00] He's reached the crest of the Mount of
[44:02] Olives to the east of Jerusalem. And now
[44:04] he sees the city, the temple, the
[44:07] eastern gate. He's among a crowd of
[44:10] people that are cheering him on. And
[44:13] when Jesus was come nigh to Jerusalem,
[44:16] even now at the descent of the Mount of
[44:19] Olives, the whole multitude, a large
[44:21] crowd of the disciples, his followers,
[44:24] began to rejoice and praise God with a
[44:27] loud voice for all the mighty works that
[44:30] they'd seen, saying, "Blessed be the
[44:33] King that cometh in the name of the
[44:35] Lord. Peace in heaven, glory in the
[44:38] highest.
[44:42] This picture is of modern Jerusalem. We
[44:46] don't have Google Earth that goes back
[44:48] 2,000 years. So, we have to settle for a
[44:50] modern picture. Here's the Mount of
[44:52] Olives. And and this is from a
[44:54] perspective a couple of thousand feet
[44:55] above that. So, you can look down. You
[44:57] can see the Kiddran Valley down here.
[45:00] What will be the Temple Mount is now uh
[45:03] set aside for something else. The wall
[45:05] of the present old city in this area
[45:08] here was the Jerusalem of David. But
[45:10] this whole area of the old city is
[45:13] pretty close to what the area of the old
[45:15] city or the present city was of
[45:17] Jerusalem in Jesus' day.
[45:22] And some of the Pharisees from among the
[45:24] multitude
[45:26] said unto him, "Master,
[45:29] rebuke thy disciples, teacher, scold
[45:32] your students. They shouldn't be calling
[45:33] you a king."
[45:35] He answered Jesus and said unto them, I
[45:39] tell you that if these should hold their
[45:42] peace, the stones would immediately cry
[45:45] out.
[45:47] And when Jesus was come near, he beheld
[45:51] the city of Jerusalem
[45:54] and wept over it.
[45:59] The tie-in to David will be clear as
[46:01] tonight's story unfolds. The second
[46:03] portion before we're seated are three
[46:06] verses from Paul's letter to the Hebrews
[46:09] chapter 12.
[46:12] Paul wrote,
[46:14] "And you have forgotten the exhortation
[46:16] which speak to you as unto children, my
[46:19] son. Despise not thou the chastening of
[46:22] the Lord, nor faint when thou art
[46:25] rebuked of him. For whom the Lord
[46:28] loveth, he chastneth, and scourgeth
[46:32] every son whom he receiveth.
[46:34] If he endure chastening, God deals with
[46:38] you with sons.
[46:40] What son is he whom the father doesn't
[46:43] chasen?
[46:45] Please be seated.
[46:50] Last time I mentioned David had been
[46:53] very active in fighting the enemies of
[46:55] Israel after his conquest of Jerusalem
[46:58] and before his sin against Ba Sheeba and
[47:01] against Uriah
[47:04] to help lay a foundation for tonight. I
[47:06] need to go back a little bit before that
[47:08] time a conversation that David had with
[47:10] the prophet Nathan shortly after David
[47:13] had finished his cedar palace in
[47:15] Jerusalem. He's celebrating and he's
[47:18] he's looking at things and he's sitting
[47:20] with Nathan, a prophet and a friend.
[47:23] And 2 Samuel 7 verse one, it came to
[47:27] pass when the king David sat in his
[47:30] house, and the Lord had given him rest
[47:32] about from all his enemies, that king
[47:34] said unto Nathan the prophet, "See now,
[47:38] I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark
[47:40] of God dwelleth within curtains."
[47:44] David wants to do something for the
[47:46] Lord. not just obey a commandment, but
[47:49] from his heart to do something for the
[47:52] Lord.
[47:54] And Nathan said to the king, "Go do all
[47:58] that's in your heart. The Lord's with
[47:59] you." Just like our lesson on Sunday,
[48:02] take a step, David. Do it. The Lord will
[48:05] guide you.
[48:07] It came to pass that night that the word
[48:10] of the Lord came unto Nathan, saying,"Go
[48:13] tell my servant David, thus sayeth the
[48:15] Lord, shalt thou build me an house for
[48:18] me to dwell in?"
[48:21] The Lord goes on to say that he's been
[48:22] in tents and tabernacles. He's never
[48:24] asked for anything more. But then he
[48:27] responds to David in verse 8. Now
[48:31] therefore,
[48:32] so shalt thou say unto my servant David,
[48:34] thus sayeth the Lord of hosts, I took
[48:37] thee from the sheepcoat, from following
[48:39] the sheep, to be ruler over my people,
[48:42] over Israel,
[48:44] and I was with thee wherever you went.
[48:47] I've cut off all your enemies out of thy
[48:49] sight. I've made thee a great name, like
[48:51] under the name of the great men that are
[48:53] in the earth.
[48:55] Moreover, I will appoint a place for my
[48:58] people Israel. I will plant them that
[49:01] they may dwell in a place of their own
[49:03] and move no more. Neither shall the
[49:05] children of wickedness afflict them
[49:06] anymore as before time and as since the
[49:09] time that I commanded judges to be over
[49:11] my people. I have and have caused thee
[49:14] to rest from all thine enemies.
[49:17] And now the Lord responds to David's
[49:19] heart. Also the Lord tellth thee that he
[49:23] will make thee an house, not of cedar,
[49:27] dynasty.
[49:29] And when thy days be fulfilled, thou
[49:32] shalt sleep with thy fathers. I will set
[49:34] up thy seed after thee, which shall
[49:37] proceed out of thy bowels, and I will
[49:39] establish his kingdom. Speaking in part
[49:42] of Solomon, but also speaking of Christ.
[49:46] Part of what he says pertains to both.
[49:48] Part pertains to Solomon, part pertains
[49:51] to Jesus. He shall build an house in my
[49:54] name, for my name. I will establish the
[49:57] throne of his kingdom forever. I will be
[49:59] his father. He shall be my son. If he
[50:03] commit iniquity, I'll chasten him with
[50:05] the rod of iron, the stripes of the
[50:08] children of men. My mercy shall not
[50:10] depart away from him as I took it from
[50:13] Saul whom I put away before thee.
[50:18] This mention of chastening coupled with
[50:20] mercy applies to David as we'll see this
[50:23] evening. And thine house and thy kingdom
[50:26] shall be established forever before
[50:28] thee. Thy throne shall be established
[50:31] forever.
[50:33] according to all these words and
[50:35] according to all this vision. So did
[50:37] Nathan speak unto David.
[50:40] David then worships the Lord. He's he's
[50:44] overwhelmed by these promises to him and
[50:46] his descendants. He wasn't seeking that.
[50:49] This prophecy covered with David's life
[50:52] experiences will help sustain David.
[50:56] Last time we read 2 Samuel chapters 11
[51:00] and 12 describing David's adultery with
[51:03] Ba Sheeba, followed by his murder of her
[51:06] husband Jeriah, one of his most loyal
[51:09] friends in an attempt to hide his crime.
[51:13] The prophet Nathan revealed God's
[51:15] awareness and disapproval of David's
[51:16] actions.
[51:18] David repented. God forgave him. But the
[51:22] consequences of his actions were still
[51:25] his to bear. Nathan again prophesying
[51:29] now with a message from the same God,
[51:32] the same prophet.
[51:34] And this time showing God's anger,
[51:36] perhaps even God's frustration with
[51:39] David after those promises.
[51:43] 2 Samuel 12 verse 9. Why hast thou
[51:47] despised the commandment of the Lord to
[51:49] do evil in his sight? Thou hast killed
[51:52] Uriah the Hitittite with the sword, hast
[51:55] taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast
[51:59] slain Uriah with the sword of the
[52:01] children of Ammon.
[52:04] Now therefore, the sword shall never
[52:06] depart from thine house, you David, and
[52:10] your descendants, because thou, not
[52:13] they, but you have despised me, and has
[52:17] taken the wife of Uriah the Hitittite to
[52:20] be thy wife. Thus saith the Lord,
[52:23] behold, I who not the devil did it, but
[52:28] I will raise up evil against who? Thee.
[52:34] David, my anointed and chosen king over
[52:37] my people, evil out of thine own house
[52:41] from your own children. And I will take
[52:44] thy wives before thine eyes. You will
[52:47] see this happen. You, David, will be a
[52:50] witness of this horror, and give them
[52:52] unto thy neighbor, and he shall lie with
[52:55] thy wives in the sight of the son.
[52:59] Thou did it secretly, but I will do this
[53:02] thing before all Israel and before the
[53:06] son.
[53:09] The next eight chapters of 2 Samuel,
[53:13] fully onethird of the entire book is
[53:16] devoted to showing the fulfillment of
[53:18] this prophecy.
[53:21] Remember at age 30, David moved to
[53:24] Hebron from Ziglag and Hebron he was
[53:26] crowned king of Judah. Two years later
[53:30] he was crowned king of Israel and the
[53:32] kingdom was again united. And we read in
[53:35] 2 Samuel 3:2 unto David were sons born
[53:38] in Hebron. His firstborn was Amnen of
[53:41] Ahenowan the Jezraelitis. So this would
[53:44] make him as a firstborn son the crown
[53:47] prince first in line to succeed his
[53:49] father David as king. His second of
[53:53] Abigail formerly the wife of Nabal the
[53:55] Carmelite. And the third, Abselum, the
[53:59] son of Maka, the daughter of Talmi, king
[54:02] of Geisher. Abselum is thus the son of a
[54:05] king and the grandson of another king.
[54:10] As we pointed out last time, Geisher is
[54:12] up here in what is known nowadays as the
[54:14] Golan Heights. It's in yellow there. So,
[54:16] at the time that David took over the
[54:18] throne, it wasn't yet part of his
[54:20] kingdom territory.
[54:23] So it's probably a political marriage in
[54:26] part to secure a peaceful border with
[54:28] this part of his kingdom. Well, after
[54:31] seven and a half years in Hebbran, David
[54:33] conquers Jerusalem and moves there.
[54:36] Several years pass. His oldest children
[54:38] were probably about 18 to 20 years old,
[54:40] making David about 50.
[54:45] 2 Samuel 13. It came to pass after this
[54:48] this prophecy of Nathan about David
[54:51] regarding this sin that Abselum the son
[54:55] of David had a fair sister a full sister
[54:59] whose name was Tamar and Amnen the
[55:02] firstborn son of David loved her.
[55:06] Jonadab Amnen's cousin a son of one of
[55:09] David's brothers suggest to Amnen a way
[55:13] to get alone with Tamar.
[55:16] Verse six. So Amnen lay down and made
[55:19] himself sick. And when the king David
[55:22] was come to see him, Amnen said unto the
[55:24] king, "Oh dad, I I pray thee, let let
[55:27] tomorrow my sister come and make me a
[55:30] couple of cakes in my sight that I may
[55:32] eat at her hand."
[55:34] David sent home to tomorrow, saying, "Go
[55:36] now to thy brother Amnen's house, and
[55:38] dress himat, make him a meal, a grain
[55:40] meal, maybe some nice pastries."
[55:44] She goes, she prepares a meal for him.
[55:48] Amnen sends everyone else away and
[55:51] forces himself on her.
[55:54] Then Amnen hated her exceedingly, so
[55:57] that the hatred wherewith he hated her
[55:58] was greater than the love wherewith he
[56:00] had loved her. And Amnen said unto her,
[56:02] "Arise, be gone."
[56:06] She goes in complete disgrace to the
[56:08] house of her brother Abselum. Stays in
[56:11] his house.
[56:12] David finds out about this. We're told
[56:15] he's very angry,
[56:17] but he takes no action against Amnen.
[56:21] He's the king. He's supposed to enforce
[56:23] the law. There's rules about this sort
[56:24] of thing.
[56:27] David does nothing. Let's compare these
[56:30] two crown princes for a moment. Amnen,
[56:32] David's son, and Jonathan, Saul's son.
[56:36] Jonathan was at his father's side. He
[56:39] fought for the nation. He was a brave,
[56:42] valiant, and faithful man. When Saul was
[56:45] killed in battle, three of his four sons
[56:47] were with him, fighting by his side for
[56:49] the nation.
[56:51] David's sons, on the other hand, seemed
[56:54] to relish the position of being a king's
[56:56] son. We're told in 1st Chronicles 18:17,
[57:00] "David gave them high office in his
[57:01] administration."
[57:03] I didn't find any reference to any of
[57:05] them ever fighting by David's side and
[57:08] the many battles David fought for the
[57:10] nation. That doesn't necessarily mean
[57:13] that they weren't there, but they are
[57:15] not mentioned.
[57:18] Abselum spake unto his brother Amnan,
[57:21] neither good nor bad. For Abselum hated
[57:24] Amnen because he had forced Abselum's
[57:28] sister Tamar.
[57:30] And it came to pass after two full
[57:34] years, two years after this event that
[57:37] Abselum had sheep shears in Ba Alhazour,
[57:40] which is beside Ephim. And Abselum
[57:42] invited all the king's sons. There you
[57:45] can see Baal Alhazor north of Jerusalem.
[57:47] There's about 15 miles from Balhazor to
[57:51] Jerusalem.
[57:53] Just a nice little town in the Judean
[57:56] hills.
[57:57] Abselum came to the king and said,
[57:59] "Behold now, thy servant hath
[58:02] sheepshers. Let the king, I beseech
[58:05] thee, and his servants go with thy
[58:07] servant." Dad, I want you at my party.
[58:11] The king said to Abselum, "Nay, my son,
[58:14] let us not all now go, lest we be
[58:16] chargeable, lest we become a burden to
[58:18] you." Abselum pressed him. How be it,
[58:22] David would not go, but blessed Abselum.
[58:27] Then Abselum said, "Well, if not, if you
[58:30] won't come, Dad, I I pray thee, let my
[58:32] brother Amnen go with us." And the king,
[58:36] knowing Abselum hates Amnen, said unto
[58:39] him, "Why should he go with thee?" But
[58:43] Abselum pressed him that David let Amnen
[58:47] and all the king's sons go with him. Now
[58:51] Abselum had commanded his servants,
[58:53] saying, "Mark ye now when Amnen's heart
[58:56] is merry with wine. And when I say unto
[58:59] you, smite Amnen, then kill him. Fear
[59:03] not. Have not I commanded you? Be
[59:06] courageous. Be valiant."
[59:10] And the servants of Abselon did unto
[59:12] Amnan as Abselum had commanded.
[59:17] Then all the king's son arose, and every
[59:19] man gat him up upon his mule and fled.
[59:23] Well, David soon hears that all of his
[59:25] sons have been killed. Tears his
[59:27] clothes. He falls to the ground. A
[59:30] watchman
[59:31] sees the brothers coming.
[59:34] David realizes Abselum has killed only
[59:38] Amnen.
[59:40] The sons join David in mourning the
[59:42] death of Ammon, David's firstborn, the
[59:43] crown prince, their oldest brother.
[59:47] Nathan's prophecy about the sword not
[59:49] leaving the house of David is already
[59:52] coming to pass.
[59:54] But Abselum fled, went to Talmi, the son
[59:58] of Amahud, king of Geisher, his maternal
[1:00:01] grandfather,
[1:00:02] and David mourned for his son every day.
[1:00:06] So Abselum fled, went to Geisher and was
[1:00:09] there three years.
[1:00:12] again goes from Bahazor up there to
[1:00:16] Gisher. So now it's been about five
[1:00:18] years since the violation of Tamar,
[1:00:21] probably six or so years after Nathan's
[1:00:24] prophecy. David's been king for 20ome
[1:00:26] years. He's in his early to mid-50s at
[1:00:29] this point.
[1:00:31] And the soul of King David longed to go
[1:00:34] forth unto Abselum, for he was comforted
[1:00:37] concerning Amnan, seeing he was dead.
[1:00:39] He's got past his mourning. He's got
[1:00:42] past his grief.
[1:00:44] Joab
[1:00:46] sees David's desire for Abselum,
[1:00:50] arranges for an old woman to come and
[1:00:52] speak with David, telling him a tale of
[1:00:54] personal tragedy about two sons and her
[1:00:56] family. David sees through the story as
[1:00:59] a woman presses her case and he says,
[1:01:01] "Did Joab put you up to this?" And she
[1:01:04] says, "Oh, I can't hide anything from
[1:01:06] you, king." Yes.
[1:01:10] The king said unto Joab, "Behold now, I
[1:01:14] have done this thing. Go, therefore,
[1:01:16] bring the young man Abselum again." So
[1:01:19] Joab arose, went to Geisher, brought
[1:01:22] Abselum to Jerusalem. The king said,
[1:01:24] "Let him not, let him turn to his own
[1:01:27] house. Let him not see my face." He's
[1:01:30] still an outcast. He's still a murderer.
[1:01:33] So Abselum returned to his own house and
[1:01:35] saw not the king's face.
[1:01:38] And there's a few verses here that tell
[1:01:40] us that, oh, by the way, Abselum was a
[1:01:42] really good-looking guy. His hair just
[1:01:45] knew no bounds. It grew. He cut it every
[1:01:48] year and got about three pounds of hair.
[1:01:51] I don't think I can compete.
[1:01:53] And we're told also during this time
[1:01:55] that Abselum had three sons and a
[1:01:58] daughter that he named after his sister
[1:02:01] Tamar. So Abselum, who walked two full
[1:02:04] years in Jerusalem, saw not the king's
[1:02:07] face.
[1:02:10] Well, Abselum's not too happy about
[1:02:12] this. He sends twice for Joab to come to
[1:02:15] him. Joab doesn't come. So he tells his
[1:02:19] servants, "Johab's barley field is next
[1:02:21] door to ours. Burn his barley."
[1:02:26] Joab comes.
[1:02:28] Why did you burn my fields? Abselum
[1:02:31] answered Joab, "Behold, I sent unto
[1:02:34] thee, saying, Come hither, that I may
[1:02:37] send thee to the king, to say, Why am I
[1:02:39] come from Gasher? It have been good for
[1:02:41] me to have been there still. I've been
[1:02:44] back two years, still I haven't seen my
[1:02:46] dad. Now, therefore, let me see the
[1:02:48] king's face. If there be any iniquity in
[1:02:51] me, let him kill me."
[1:02:54] So Joab came to the king and told him.
[1:02:57] And when David had called for Abselum,
[1:03:00] he came to the king. And Abselum bowed
[1:03:02] himself on his face to the ground before
[1:03:04] the king before David. And the king
[1:03:08] kissed Abselum.
[1:03:10] David thus forgives and restores
[1:03:14] Abselum.
[1:03:17] And the next verse, it came to pass
[1:03:19] after this, I suspect it wasn't long
[1:03:21] after this, that Abselum prepared him
[1:03:24] chariots and horses and 50 men to run
[1:03:27] before him.
[1:03:29] What's up with this?
[1:03:31] Wouldn't David have questioned or
[1:03:33] challenged him about this? No. It was
[1:03:37] consistent behavior for David's sons,
[1:03:39] though Abselum probably took it to a
[1:03:42] whole another level. 1st Chronicles 18
[1:03:44] we read so David reigned over all Israel
[1:03:47] executed judgment and justice among all
[1:03:49] the people and gives a list of all the
[1:03:51] officials starting with Joab the son of
[1:03:54] Zariah was over the host lists a few
[1:03:56] other officials and the list ends with
[1:03:58] and the sons of David were chief about
[1:04:01] the king
[1:04:03] so they're kind of used to a lot of
[1:04:06] privilege
[1:04:08] back to our story Abselum rose up early
[1:04:11] stood beside the way of the gate. And it
[1:04:14] was so that when any man had a
[1:04:16] controversy, came to the king for
[1:04:18] judgment that Aram called unto him and
[1:04:21] said, "Hey there, where are you from?
[1:04:24] What city art thou?" And he said, "Oh,
[1:04:27] oh, thy servant is from here or there,
[1:04:29] naming of one of the cities of the
[1:04:30] tribes of Israel." And then Abselum
[1:04:33] would say to him, I see thy thy matters
[1:04:36] are good and right, but there's no man
[1:04:39] deputed of the king to hear thee. He
[1:04:43] David hasn't assigned anybody else to
[1:04:45] hear these cases.
[1:04:47] Oh, that I were made judge in the land,
[1:04:50] that every man which hath any suit or
[1:04:52] cause might come to me, I would do him
[1:04:55] justice.
[1:04:57] And it was so that when any man came
[1:05:00] nigh to him to do obesence and bow down,
[1:05:03] that Abselum put forth his hand and took
[1:05:05] him and kissed him.
[1:05:08] And in this manner did Abselum to all
[1:05:10] Israel that came to the king for
[1:05:12] judgment. And so Abselum stole the
[1:05:16] hearts of the men of Israel.
[1:05:23] It came to pass after 40 years that
[1:05:26] Abselum said unto the king, I pray thee,
[1:05:29] let me go and pay my vow which I have
[1:05:31] vowed unto the Lord in he.
[1:05:37] This is an obscure reference.
[1:05:40] If that number 40 is accurate and
[1:05:43] literal, it refers to something much
[1:05:45] earlier. Perhaps when Samuel anointed
[1:05:48] David to become king after Saul or when
[1:05:51] David killed Goliath. It can't mean
[1:05:53] Abselum was in the gate for 40 years
[1:05:56] because by that time David would have
[1:05:57] been dead for 25 years
[1:06:00] and be in the middle of Solomon's reign.
[1:06:03] So it's not he's in the gate for 40
[1:06:05] years. 40 may be a symbolic number
[1:06:08] suggesting testing or trials. Some hold
[1:06:12] the view that it's an error of copying
[1:06:13] is meant to be four years. And in fact,
[1:06:16] a few early manuscripts say four rather
[1:06:19] than 40. Four is a reasonable number of
[1:06:21] years for this to have occurred.
[1:06:23] Stealing the hearts.
[1:06:25] I went and checked the Dead Sea Scrolls,
[1:06:28] the oldest known Hebrew manuscripts in
[1:06:30] existence. This verse is found in one of
[1:06:32] those scrolls. It says 40.
[1:06:37] The oldest copies of the Septuagant, the
[1:06:39] translation of the Hebrew Bible into
[1:06:40] Greek done in Alexandria around the 3rd
[1:06:42] century BC, the oldest copies are from
[1:06:46] the 4th century AD. They also say 40. Is
[1:06:50] there something we can conclude? I think
[1:06:53] in terms of elapsed time since Abselum
[1:06:56] started to sit in the gate, it's likely
[1:06:57] two to five years. Maybe four is
[1:06:59] correct. Abselum was born in Hebron.
[1:07:03] David was 30 when he moved there. He
[1:07:05] wouldn't have made a political wedding
[1:07:06] with the king of Geisher's daughter till
[1:07:08] he was king of all Israel. So he was 32
[1:07:10] or 33 when he married Abselum's mom and
[1:07:13] 33 or four when Abselum was born. So
[1:07:16] David is now most likely in his early
[1:07:18] 60s. Abselum in his late 20s.
[1:07:23] It came to pass after 40 years, whatever
[1:07:25] that means, that Abselum said unto his
[1:07:27] father David the king, I pray thee, let
[1:07:30] me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed
[1:07:32] unto the Lord in Hebron. For thy servant
[1:07:35] vowed a vow while I abote at Geisher in
[1:07:38] Syria, saying, If the Lord shall bring
[1:07:40] me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I
[1:07:44] will serve the Lord.
[1:07:47] And the king said unto him, "Go in
[1:07:50] peace." So Absom arose and went to
[1:07:54] Hebrron. He
[1:07:57] is in the territory of Judah. It's about
[1:07:59] 20 miles southwest of Jerusalem in the
[1:08:02] Judean hills.
[1:08:04] Notice David is involved in every step
[1:08:09] of these ongoing tragedies. Sending
[1:08:11] Tamar to Amnum. Sending Amnen to
[1:08:14] Abselum's sheep shearing party.
[1:08:17] sending for Abselon to return from exile
[1:08:19] in Gisher. Giving Abselum freedom by
[1:08:23] kissing him. Sending Abselon to Hebrron,
[1:08:26] Abselon's birthplace for this sacrifice.
[1:08:32] But Abselum sent spies throughout all
[1:08:34] the tribes of Israel, saying, "As soon
[1:08:37] as you hear the sound of the trumpet,
[1:08:39] then ye shall say, Abselum reignth in
[1:08:42] Heban."
[1:08:44] With Abselum went 200 men out of
[1:08:46] Jerusalem that were called to
[1:08:48] participate in this sacrifice. And they
[1:08:50] went in their simplicity, their
[1:08:52] innocence. They knew not anything of
[1:08:55] Abselum's plan to overthrow David.
[1:08:59] And Abselum sent for a Hyhel, the
[1:09:03] Gilonite, David's counselor, from his
[1:09:06] city, even from Gilo. While Abselum
[1:09:09] offered sacrifices,
[1:09:11] the conspiracy was strong. The people
[1:09:14] increased continually with Abselon. It
[1:09:16] grew and it grew.
[1:09:19] There came a messenger to David, saying,
[1:09:22] "The hearts of the men of Israel are
[1:09:25] after Abselum."
[1:09:28] David said unto all his servants that
[1:09:30] were with him at Jerusalem, "Arise, let
[1:09:34] us flee. We shall not else escape from
[1:09:37] Abselum. Make speed to depart, lest he
[1:09:39] overtake us suddenly and bring evil upon
[1:09:42] us and smite the city with the edge of
[1:09:44] the sword.
[1:09:46] Why run? Why not fight?
[1:09:50] Abselum has a large following. David
[1:09:53] knows the cruelty of his son. David has
[1:09:56] a shepherd's heart. He doesn't want to
[1:09:59] see innocent people in the city get
[1:10:00] caught up in what would likely turn into
[1:10:02] a slaughter. If there's to be a fight,
[1:10:05] let it be outside the city.
[1:10:09] The king's servants said unto the king,
[1:10:11] "Behold, thy servants are ready to do
[1:10:13] whatsoever my lord the king shall
[1:10:16] appoint." And the king went forth, and
[1:10:18] all his household after him. The king
[1:10:21] left 10 women, which were concubines.
[1:10:23] Concubines are wives. They're some kind
[1:10:26] of a ranking system here. Not voting for
[1:10:29] New York City mayor, but a ranking
[1:10:31] system nonetheless.
[1:10:33] So there's a lesser wife in these
[1:10:34] polygamous societies. So he left them
[1:10:37] there to keep the house, the cedar
[1:10:38] palace that Hyram had built for him
[1:10:41] several years earlier.
[1:10:43] The king went forth all the people after
[1:10:46] him and carried in a place that was far
[1:10:49] off. It says far off, but it's still
[1:10:51] very near Jerusalem. He hasn't crossed
[1:10:53] the Kidrron Valley yet to the Mount of
[1:10:54] Olives. So maybe he's a half a mile out
[1:10:57] of the city, maybe a mile. It's it's not
[1:11:01] so very far.
[1:11:02] And all his servants passed on beside
[1:11:04] him. All the Kathites and all the
[1:11:06] Pelites and all the Guites. 600 men
[1:11:09] which came after him from Gath. 600
[1:11:11] remember that were with him in Gath and
[1:11:12] Ziklag and so forth. They've been with
[1:11:14] David for a long, long time. And they
[1:11:16] passed on before the king. In other
[1:11:18] words, it's a kind of a review, a kind
[1:11:20] of an inspection. David's assessing
[1:11:23] those who are coming with him out of
[1:11:24] this city to be certain that none of
[1:11:26] Abselum's loyalists are among them.
[1:11:31] and all the country wept with a loud
[1:11:33] voice. And all the people passed over.
[1:11:35] The king also passed over the brook
[1:11:37] Kiddran. And all the people passed over
[1:11:40] toward the way of the wilderness.
[1:11:44] And lo, Zadok, a priest also, and all
[1:11:47] the Levites were with him, bearing the
[1:11:50] ark of the covenant of God. And they set
[1:11:52] down the ark of God. And Abathar,
[1:11:55] another priest, went up until all the
[1:11:57] people were done passing out of the
[1:11:59] city.
[1:12:01] The king said unto Zadok,
[1:12:04] "Carry back the ark of God into the
[1:12:06] city. If I shall find favor in the eyes
[1:12:09] of the Lord, he'll bring me again and
[1:12:12] show me both it and his habitation.
[1:12:16] But if the Lord thus say, I have no
[1:12:18] delight in David. Behold, here am I. Let
[1:12:22] the Lord do to me as seemth good to
[1:12:24] him."
[1:12:26] David then arranges for the priests to
[1:12:29] be his spies to keep him informed of
[1:12:31] Abselon's doings.
[1:12:34] And David went up by the ascent of Mount
[1:12:36] Olivet. That's the Mount of Olives. And
[1:12:39] wept as he went up and had his head
[1:12:41] covered and he went barefoot. And all
[1:12:44] the people that was with him covered
[1:12:46] every man his head and they went up
[1:12:49] weeping as they went up.
[1:12:52] This this is a view of
[1:12:55] what the location of where David's
[1:12:58] Jerusalem was at that time. A view from
[1:13:00] the Mount of Olives looking over a
[1:13:02] Jewish cemetery that's that's now there.
[1:13:06] Recall from our opening verses in Luke
[1:13:08] that Jesus was on the road between
[1:13:10] Jerusalem, the crest of the Mount of
[1:13:12] Olives when he wept over that same city.
[1:13:17] And one told David, saying, Ahyhel is
[1:13:21] among the conspirators with Abselum.
[1:13:24] And David said, "Oh Lord, I pray thee,
[1:13:27] turn the council of Ahyhel into
[1:13:30] foolishness."
[1:13:31] Ahyhel
[1:13:33] was one of David's most trusted
[1:13:35] counselors whom he often consulted when
[1:13:38] making important decisions.
[1:13:41] And it came to pass that when David was
[1:13:43] come to the top of the mount where he
[1:13:45] worshiped God,
[1:13:47] behold, Hushi the Arite came to meet him
[1:13:51] with his coat, rent an earth upon his
[1:13:53] head. Hushi is another of David's most
[1:13:57] favored counselors. He wants to go with
[1:13:59] David. He is not part of the conspiracy.
[1:14:02] David tells Hushi, "Look, I need you to
[1:14:05] go into Jerusalem. I need you to
[1:14:08] convince Abselum that you're on his side
[1:14:11] and I need you to defeat the council of
[1:14:13] Ahyhel
[1:14:15] and then said word back to me through
[1:14:17] the priests of what's going on.
[1:14:22] So Hushi David's friend came into the
[1:14:25] city and Abselum came into Jerusalem.
[1:14:32] David continues on from the crest of
[1:14:33] Mount of Olives another mile and a half
[1:14:35] or so. When David came to Baharim, the
[1:14:38] same is also called Knob or Noob. You
[1:14:41] might remember earlier when David got
[1:14:43] Goliath's sword and went away, he went
[1:14:45] to the priest of Knob. That's Baharim.
[1:14:47] This is the same place.
[1:14:50] It's the road towards Jericho, the
[1:14:52] wilderness. It's towards Rabba and
[1:14:54] Ammon, which you might remember was the
[1:14:57] city where his troops were fighting when
[1:14:59] he had his affair with Basheba. Perhaps
[1:15:04] this is also a reminder to him of why
[1:15:07] all this is happening. Behold, thence
[1:15:10] came out a man of the family of the
[1:15:12] house of Saul, whose name was Shami,
[1:15:16] the son of Gera. He came forth and
[1:15:19] cursed still as he came, not Gera, but
[1:15:22] Gera, sorry.
[1:15:25] And he cast stones at David. and at all
[1:15:28] the servants of King David and all the
[1:15:30] people and all the mighty men were on
[1:15:31] his right hand and on his left. And thus
[1:15:33] said Shimmy when he cursed, "Come out,
[1:15:37] come out, thou bloody man, thou men of
[1:15:39] Balile. The Lord hath returned upon thee
[1:15:42] all the all the blood of the house of
[1:15:46] Saul, in whosestead thou hast reigned,
[1:15:48] and the Lord hath delivered the kingdom
[1:15:50] into the hand of Abselum thy son. and
[1:15:53] behold, thou art taken in thy mischief,
[1:15:56] because thou art a bloody man."
[1:16:00] Then said Abashi, the son of Zariah,
[1:16:02] unto the king, Joab's brother,
[1:16:06] "Why should this dead dog curse my lord
[1:16:09] the king? Let me go over, I pray thee,
[1:16:12] and take off his head."
[1:16:15] And the king said, "What have I to do
[1:16:17] with you, you sons of Zariah? Let him
[1:16:20] curse because the Lord hath said unto
[1:16:23] him, Curse David. Who shall then say,
[1:16:27] Why hast thou done so? David said to
[1:16:30] Abishai, and to all his servants,
[1:16:33] Behold, my son, which came forth out of
[1:16:36] my bowels, seeketh my life. How much
[1:16:39] more now may this Benjamite do it. Let
[1:16:41] him alone. Let him curse. The Lord hath
[1:16:44] bidden him. It may be the Lord will look
[1:16:48] upon mine affliction and that the Lord
[1:16:50] will requite me good for his cursing
[1:16:52] this day. Perhaps the Lord will see how
[1:16:55] I'm treating him and will reward me with
[1:16:58] good. I can use some good about now.
[1:17:02] And as David and his men went by the
[1:17:04] way, Shme went along on the hillside
[1:17:07] over against him and cursed as he went
[1:17:09] and threw stones at him and cast dust.
[1:17:13] And the king and all the people that
[1:17:15] were with him came weary and refreshed
[1:17:18] themselves there in Baharim just two
[1:17:21] miles outside Jerusalem. Brother
[1:17:24] Brandham talks about this event. Want to
[1:17:26] read you a little thing that he said
[1:17:28] from the identified Christ of all ages
[1:17:30] in 1964.
[1:17:33] But yet look at David when he was going
[1:17:35] out exiled from his own people a
[1:17:37] rejected king. His own daughter had been
[1:17:40] ravished by her brother and the other
[1:17:42] brothers had killed him. And here he
[1:17:43] was. Abselum had raised up, separated
[1:17:46] the army, causing revolution. David, his
[1:17:50] own father, was excommunicated, taken
[1:17:52] away, rejected by his people, going out
[1:17:55] of the city. A little crippled-like
[1:17:58] fellow dragon along there making fun of
[1:17:59] him, spitting on him. That guard pulled
[1:18:02] his sword, said, "I'll let that dog's
[1:18:04] head stay on him, spitting on my king."
[1:18:07] David said, "Let him alone. God told him
[1:18:10] to do that." No doubt David didn't know
[1:18:13] what he was doing. Walked up the same
[1:18:15] Mount of Olives there and looked down
[1:18:17] weeping, a rejected king where a few
[1:18:20] hundred years after that Jesus Christ
[1:18:23] sat on the same mountain, the son of
[1:18:26] David, weeping as a rejected king, they
[1:18:30] spit on him also.
[1:18:33] Back to 2 Samuel. Abselum and all the
[1:18:37] people, the men of Israel came to
[1:18:40] Jerusalem and Ahel, the counselor that
[1:18:43] supported the rebellion, came with him.
[1:18:47] Abselum enters the city and sees Hushi,
[1:18:50] the counselor that David sent and
[1:18:52] challenges him, "How come you're not
[1:18:54] with your friend? How come you're not
[1:18:55] with David? What are you doing here?"
[1:18:56] Hishi says, "Abselum, God has made you
[1:18:59] king. The people have selected you as
[1:19:01] king. My role is to serve the king. I'm
[1:19:04] on your side.
[1:19:07] So he convinces Abselum that he's on his
[1:19:11] side. Then Abselum said to Hyhel, "I
[1:19:15] give counsel among you what we shall
[1:19:18] do." And Ahyhel
[1:19:21] said to Abselum,
[1:19:23] "Go in unto thy father's concubines, the
[1:19:26] 10 wives which he hath left to keep the
[1:19:28] house, and all Israel shall hear that
[1:19:30] thou art aboard of thy father. And then
[1:19:34] shall the hands of all that are with
[1:19:35] thee be strong, and anyone who remains
[1:19:37] with you after this is fully committed
[1:19:39] to the rebellion."
[1:19:43] So they spread Abselum a tent
[1:19:46] upon the top of the house which Hyram
[1:19:50] had built for David, his cedar palace.
[1:19:53] And Abselum went in unto his father's
[1:19:56] concubines in the sight of all Israel.
[1:20:01] Recall Nathan's prophecy.
[1:20:04] Thus saith the Lord, behold, I will
[1:20:06] raise up evil against thee out of thine
[1:20:08] own house. I will take thy wives before
[1:20:12] thine eyes, and give them unto thy
[1:20:13] neighbor, and he shall lie with thy
[1:20:16] wives in the sight of this son. Thou did
[1:20:19] it secretly, but I will do this thing
[1:20:22] before all Israel and before the son.
[1:20:29] The council of a hyhel, which he
[1:20:31] counseledled in those days, was as if a
[1:20:33] man had inquired at the oracle of God.
[1:20:36] So was all the council of Ahyhel, both
[1:20:38] with David and with Abselum.
[1:20:44] Moreover, Ahyhel said to Abselum,
[1:20:47] "Let me now choose out 12,000 men. I
[1:20:51] will arise and pursue after David this
[1:20:53] night, tonight, right now. I will come
[1:20:56] upon him while he is weary and weak.
[1:21:00] No time to organize resistance. I will
[1:21:02] make him afraid, and all the people that
[1:21:04] are with him shall flee, and I will
[1:21:06] smite the king only. Me and my 12,000
[1:21:09] guys will just separate and kill David.
[1:21:12] I will bring back all the people unto
[1:21:14] thee. The man whom thou seekest is if
[1:21:17] all return, so all the people shall be
[1:21:19] in peace. Without David, everyone's
[1:21:22] going to follow you, Abselum. Your
[1:21:24] kingship established and assured.
[1:21:28] The saying pleased Abselum well and all
[1:21:31] the elders of Israel. Then said Abselum,
[1:21:34] "Call now Hishi the Arite also, and let
[1:21:37] us hear likewise what he says."
[1:21:39] Remember, Hishi is David's secret
[1:21:42] weapon.
[1:21:44] And when Hishi was come to Abselum,
[1:21:47] Abselum spake unto him, saying, "A Hyhel
[1:21:49] hath spoken after this manner. Shall we
[1:21:52] do after his saying? If not, what do you
[1:21:54] say?" Hushai said to Abselum, "The
[1:21:58] council that uh Fifthal hath given is
[1:22:01] not good at this time." Hishai reminds
[1:22:04] Abselum what fierce warriors David and
[1:22:06] his army are. And now they're cornered
[1:22:08] and trapped. They're going to fight so
[1:22:10] hard. So he counsels delay.
[1:22:14] Therefore, I counsel that all Israel be
[1:22:17] generally gathered unto thee, from Dan
[1:22:20] even unto Beeva, as the sand that is by
[1:22:23] the sea for multitude, and that thou go
[1:22:26] to battle in thine own person. So shall
[1:22:30] we come upon him in some place where he
[1:22:32] shall be found. We will light upon him
[1:22:34] as the duke fallth upon the ground, and
[1:22:36] of him and all the men that are with
[1:22:38] him, there shall not be left so much as
[1:22:39] one. will kill David and all his
[1:22:42] loyalists will smash the resistance.
[1:22:46] Moreover, if he be gotten into a city,
[1:22:48] then shall all Israel bring ropes to
[1:22:50] that city will draw it into the river
[1:22:52] until there be not one small stone found
[1:22:54] there. No city's going to harbor him
[1:22:57] against this mighty army.
[1:23:01] Abselum and all the men of Israel said,
[1:23:03] "The council of Hishi the Arite is
[1:23:06] better than the council of Ahyhel.
[1:23:09] For the Lord had appointed to defeat the
[1:23:11] good council of Ahyel to the intent that
[1:23:14] the Lord might bring evil upon Absel.
[1:23:20] Hushi then gets word to David and
[1:23:21] Baharim through the priest's sons to
[1:23:24] leave immediately. Get away from
[1:23:26] Jerusalem. They lay out Abselum's plans.
[1:23:30] David and those with him flee, crossing
[1:23:33] the Jordan that very night. Ahyhel,
[1:23:37] seeing his advice is rejected, sets his
[1:23:40] house in order and commits suicide.
[1:23:45] David arrives in Mahanim. I'm showing it
[1:23:49] on the map there.
[1:23:51] The very city where Ishbos, Saul's
[1:23:54] youngest son, had set up his kingdom at
[1:23:55] the behest of Abnner almost 30 years
[1:23:57] earlier. David is welcomed there,
[1:24:00] including by some of his former enemies.
[1:24:02] They bring him food, refreshment. These
[1:24:04] people are weary. They've traveled under
[1:24:06] pressure a great distance. Abselum by
[1:24:09] this time has gathered his army and
[1:24:11] crossed Jordan.
[1:24:13] David numbered the people that were with
[1:24:15] him and set captains of thousands and
[1:24:17] captains of hundreds over them. David
[1:24:20] sent forth a third part of the people
[1:24:22] under the hand of Joab, a third part
[1:24:24] under the hand of Bishi, the son of
[1:24:26] Zariah, Joab's brother, and a third part
[1:24:28] under the hand of Iti the Gitite. The
[1:24:32] king said unto the people, "I will
[1:24:34] surely go forth with you myself also."
[1:24:37] But the people answered, "Thou shall not
[1:24:40] go forth. If we flee away, they don't
[1:24:42] care about us. Neither if half of us die
[1:24:44] will they care about us. But now you're
[1:24:47] worth 10,000 of us. Therefore, now it is
[1:24:49] better that thou sucker us out of this,
[1:24:51] and you support us from here. Send help
[1:24:53] if we need it."
[1:24:56] And the king, David, said unto them,
[1:24:58] "What seemth you best, I will do." The
[1:25:01] king stood by the side of the gate. The
[1:25:03] people came out by their hundreds and
[1:25:04] the thousands. And the king commanded
[1:25:06] Joab and Abishai and Iti, saying, "Deal
[1:25:10] gently for my sake with the young man,
[1:25:13] even with Abselum."
[1:25:15] And all the people heard when the king
[1:25:17] gave all the captain's charge concerning
[1:25:20] Abselum.
[1:25:22] And there follows a great battle in the
[1:25:25] forests of Gilead on the east side of
[1:25:27] the Jordan River.
[1:25:29] Abselum
[1:25:32] comes across some of David's army.
[1:25:35] He flees on his mule. Remember David's
[1:25:39] sons never seem to fight. Absom's not a
[1:25:41] warrior. He has his servants kill
[1:25:43] everybody. His hair
[1:25:47] barber appointment was probably the next
[1:25:49] day. He must have had that three pounds
[1:25:50] of hair up there. His hair gets caught
[1:25:52] in an oak tree. The mule runs off on
[1:25:55] these absom dangling from a tree branch.
[1:25:58] One comes and tells Joab and Joab
[1:26:01] says,"Well, did you kill him?" And he
[1:26:03] says, "No, David said to spare him."
[1:26:07] Joab goes to Abselum and he and his
[1:26:09] armor bearers kill Abselum.
[1:26:13] Keep in mind, brother Daniel's lesson on
[1:26:15] Saul last week about obeying the king,
[1:26:17] even if he makes a bad decision. What's
[1:26:19] the right thing to do here?
[1:26:23] Joab blew the trumpet. The people
[1:26:25] returned for pursuing after Israel, for
[1:26:28] Joab held back the people. They took
[1:26:30] Abselum, cast him into a great pit in
[1:26:33] the wood, laid a very great heap of
[1:26:35] stones upon him, and all Israel fled
[1:26:37] everyone to his tent. Israel in this
[1:26:39] case is Abselum's army, not David's
[1:26:42] army.
[1:26:44] And we're told, now Abselum in his
[1:26:46] lifetime had taken and reared up for
[1:26:48] himself a pillar, which is in the king's
[1:26:49] dale. For he said, "I have no son to
[1:26:52] keep my name in remembrance." And he
[1:26:55] called the pillar after his own name,
[1:26:57] and is called unto this day Abselum's
[1:27:00] place.
[1:27:01] They think where that original pillar
[1:27:04] was that later there was a a thing
[1:27:06] carved out of part of the hillside of
[1:27:09] Mount of Olives that they believe is at
[1:27:11] that same location. And it's called
[1:27:12] Abselum's pillar. The one that's there
[1:27:15] now is from very late second temple
[1:27:17] period. But he must have done this
[1:27:20] earlier in his life because
[1:27:23] we know from earlier that unto Abselum
[1:27:26] there were born three sons and one
[1:27:28] daughter whose name was Tamar. She was a
[1:27:30] woman of fair countenance.
[1:27:35] David sat between the two gates in
[1:27:36] Mahanayim.
[1:27:38] The watchman went up to the roof over
[1:27:40] the gate of the wall looking what's
[1:27:42] going on? How is the battle proceeding?
[1:27:44] He lifted up his eyes and looked, and
[1:27:46] behold, a man running alone. And the
[1:27:51] watchman cried and told the king.
[1:27:56] And behold, Kushi, a messenger sent from
[1:27:58] Joab, came. And Kushi said,
[1:28:06] "Tiding, tidings, my lord, the king. The
[1:28:09] Lord hath avenged thee this day of all
[1:28:12] them that rose up against thee. That was
[1:28:15] a long run. And the king said unto
[1:28:17] Kushi, "Is a young man Abselum safe?"
[1:28:22] And Kushi answered,
[1:28:25] "The the enemies of of my lord the king
[1:28:28] and all that rise against thee to do
[1:28:30] thee hurt be as that young man is."
[1:28:37] And the king was much moved and went up
[1:28:39] to the chamber over the gate and wept.
[1:28:42] And as he went, thus he said, "Oh my
[1:28:47] son, Abselum, my son, Abselum, what God,
[1:28:51] I had died for thee, Abselum. My son, my
[1:28:55] son."
[1:28:58] It was told Joab, "Behold, the king
[1:29:01] weeps and mourns for Abselum."
[1:29:05] And the victory that day was turned into
[1:29:07] mourning unto all the people. For the
[1:29:09] people heard say that day how the king
[1:29:11] was grieved for his son,
[1:29:14] and the people got them by stealth that
[1:29:16] day into the city. They snuck in, as
[1:29:19] people being ashamed steal away when
[1:29:22] they flee in battle.
[1:29:24] But the king covered his face and cried
[1:29:27] with a loud voice, "Oh my son, Abselum,
[1:29:31] Abselum, my son, my son."
[1:29:37] Joab came into the house of the king and
[1:29:40] said,
[1:29:42] "Thou hast shamed this day the faces of
[1:29:45] all thy servants, which this day have
[1:29:48] saved thy life, and the lives of thy
[1:29:51] sons, and of thy daughters, and the
[1:29:53] lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy
[1:29:56] concubines, in that thou lovest thine
[1:29:59] enemies, and hatest thy friends.
[1:30:02] Thou hast declared this day, that thou
[1:30:05] regardest neither princes nor servants.
[1:30:08] For this day I perceive, if Abselum had
[1:30:11] lived, and all we had died this day,
[1:30:14] then it had pleased thee well.
[1:30:17] Now therefore, get up, go forth, speak
[1:30:22] comfort to the people. I swear by the
[1:30:25] Lord, if thou go not forth, there will
[1:30:27] not one with thee this night. and that
[1:30:30] will be worse unto thee than all the
[1:30:33] evil that befell thee from thy youth
[1:30:35] until now.
[1:30:38] Pretty straight talk from Joab to the
[1:30:40] king.
[1:30:41] Well, David then goes about getting
[1:30:43] support for his return to Jerusalem,
[1:30:46] winning over the army and supporters of
[1:30:48] Abselum to prevent further bloodshed.
[1:30:51] She the one who cursed as David fled
[1:30:54] Jerusalem, meets him as he crosses the
[1:30:56] Jordan and begs forgiveness.
[1:31:00] For thy servant doth know that I have
[1:31:02] sinned. Therefore, behold, I am come the
[1:31:06] first this day of all the house of
[1:31:08] Joseph to go down to meet my lord the
[1:31:11] king.
[1:31:13] But Abashi the son of Zariah answered
[1:31:15] and said, "Shall not Shimmy be put to
[1:31:19] death for this because he cursed the
[1:31:21] Lord's anointed?"
[1:31:24] And David said, "What have I to do with
[1:31:26] you, you sons of Zachariah, that you
[1:31:29] should this day be adversaries unto me?
[1:31:31] Shall there any man be put to death this
[1:31:34] day in Israel? For do I not know that I
[1:31:37] am this day king over Israel?"
[1:31:41] Therefore, the king said unto Shemi,
[1:31:45] "Thou shalt not die."
[1:31:47] and the king swear unto him.
[1:31:55] Something happens a number of years
[1:31:57] later, but that's not about this
[1:31:59] tonight.
[1:32:01] 2 Samuel 19 concludes with David
[1:32:03] arriving in Jerusalem.
[1:32:06] Now, remember, we're trying to look into
[1:32:08] David's heart,
[1:32:13] find psalms that are tied to events.
[1:32:16] Let's go to where he heard that Abselam
[1:32:18] had been declared king.
[1:32:21] David then fled the city. He could have
[1:32:24] stayed and fought, but that would have
[1:32:25] endangered everyone. And David, always
[1:32:27] the shepherd at heart, isn't about to do
[1:32:29] that. He flees the city, but he's
[1:32:32] getting old. He's tired. He only makes
[1:32:35] it about two miles to Baharim and has to
[1:32:37] stop and rest.
[1:32:40] With fresh intelligence from Hooi, he
[1:32:42] presses on through the night, eventually
[1:32:43] makes his way to Mahanim, some 40 miles
[1:32:46] to the north on the other side of the
[1:32:48] Jordan River.
[1:32:50] Meanwhile, Abselam has amassed a huge
[1:32:52] army from all Israel
[1:32:55] whose sole purpose is to pursue and kill
[1:32:58] David.
[1:33:02] Can you imagine the grief,
[1:33:06] the pressure,
[1:33:08] the stress,
[1:33:10] your own son?
[1:33:12] And in the back of your mind, or maybe
[1:33:15] at the front, is the realization that
[1:33:18] this horror is upon you and those you
[1:33:20] love because of your betrayal of one of
[1:33:23] your close associates taking his wife
[1:33:26] and then intentionally having him killed
[1:33:28] at the hand of the enemies that you set
[1:33:30] him to fight.
[1:33:33] Can you imagine?
[1:33:36] Tonight's psalm seems to have been
[1:33:38] written at or reflecting on that
[1:33:41] specific time.
[1:33:44] Psalm three,
[1:33:47] a psalm of David when he fled from
[1:33:51] Abselum his son.
[1:33:54] Lord, how are they increased that
[1:33:57] trouble me? Many are they that rise up
[1:33:59] against me. Asam's raised a huge army
[1:34:03] from all over the kingdom to find and
[1:34:05] kill David. He's fled from Jerusalem.
[1:34:08] Many there be which say of my soul,
[1:34:11] there's no help for him in God. Say
[1:34:16] David's situation,
[1:34:18] looks hopeless.
[1:34:21] But thou, oh Lord, art shield for me, my
[1:34:25] glory, the lifter up of my head.
[1:34:29] In the midst of my troubles, I will
[1:34:31] continue to thank and praise you. I will
[1:34:34] hold to the promises you've given me.
[1:34:36] Even as I swoon under your chastisement,
[1:34:40] I cried unto the Lord with my voice. He
[1:34:43] heard me out of his holy hill.
[1:34:46] Say
[1:34:48] James tells us the effectual fervent
[1:34:51] prayer of a righteous man avaleth much.
[1:34:54] Another translation says the prayer of a
[1:34:56] righteous person is powerful and
[1:34:58] effective.
[1:35:00] And now a verse that really gives me
[1:35:03] pause. Perhaps it gives you pause as
[1:35:05] well. David says, "I laid me down and
[1:35:09] slept. I await for the Lord sustained
[1:35:12] me.
[1:35:14] In the midst of all this turmoil,
[1:35:17] violence,
[1:35:19] passion,
[1:35:21] angst,
[1:35:22] David isn't tossing and turning.
[1:35:25] Worrying isn't keeping him awake. He's
[1:35:28] not having nightmares. His confidence in
[1:35:32] the Lord is such that he's able to get a
[1:35:34] full night's sleep.
[1:35:36] That speaks to me at any rate.
[1:35:40] I laid down and slept. I awake for the
[1:35:43] Lord sustained me. I will not be afraid
[1:35:46] of 10 thousands, literally of multitudes
[1:35:49] of people that has set themselves
[1:35:51] against me round about. This is literal
[1:35:54] in David's case. He's describing what's
[1:35:57] going on.
[1:35:59] Arise, O Lord, save me, oh my God.
[1:36:02] He's fully aware of the mortal danger
[1:36:05] he's facing. Thou hast smitten all mine
[1:36:08] enemies upon the cheekbone. Thou has
[1:36:09] broken the teeth of the ungodly.
[1:36:12] Deprive them of their weapons, their
[1:36:14] strength, their stamina. Lord, you've
[1:36:17] done it before and you've promised.
[1:36:19] Please do it again.
[1:36:22] And verse eight, salvation belongth unto
[1:36:26] the Lord. Thy blessing is upon thy
[1:36:28] people. Say love.
[1:36:31] Other translations maybe make that a
[1:36:34] little clearer. Salvation, victory,
[1:36:35] deliverance comes from the Lord. And
[1:36:39] then David says, "Your blessing be on
[1:36:41] your people, Lord. May you bless your
[1:36:44] people."
[1:36:46] In other words, in verse eight, David is
[1:36:50] invoking the Lord to bless the very
[1:36:52] people who were chasing him. Why?
[1:36:55] Because really, they're his people.
[1:36:59] the heart of a shepherd, a shadow of
[1:37:03] what's to come, displaying what Jesus
[1:37:05] will say in uh in Matthew 5:44.
[1:37:08] But I say unto you, love your enemies,
[1:37:11] bless them that curse you, shami, do
[1:37:16] good to them that hate you, pray for
[1:37:18] them which despitefully use you, and
[1:37:21] persecute you.
[1:37:26] There are many takeaways from this
[1:37:28] story. the obvious ones regarding
[1:37:30] adultery and murder probably not a good
[1:37:32] idea. One that jumped out at me as I was
[1:37:36] preparing for this evening. David had a
[1:37:39] promise from God.
[1:37:41] And he could rest in complete assurance
[1:37:43] that God would keep his word. He didn't
[1:37:46] attempt to extract a promise or say,
[1:37:48] "Well, Lord, if you'll do this, then
[1:37:50] I'll do that." Remember
[1:37:53] another part of brother Ryan's message
[1:37:54] on Sunday about covenants between God
[1:37:57] and man.
[1:37:59] God told David, "I'll do this for you."
[1:38:01] David wasn't asking God to do that. He
[1:38:04] just wanted to build him a house. Right?
[1:38:06] If the musicians could please return at
[1:38:08] this time. In spite of David's sin, his
[1:38:12] fall from grace, we might say, he still
[1:38:15] knew he possessed that promise even
[1:38:18] while being chastised. publicly
[1:38:21] humiliated,
[1:38:22] dethroned, running for his life.
[1:38:26] He knew he was being punished. But he
[1:38:29] also clung to the promise that the Lord
[1:38:31] would never leave him, even while he was
[1:38:34] enduring the disintegration of his
[1:38:36] household and all that went with it.
[1:38:40] Chastisement is not rejection. It's a
[1:38:43] form of teaching. It reminds us there
[1:38:46] are consequences to our actions and the
[1:38:48] choices we make. It shows and
[1:38:51] demonstrates God's love, not his hate.
[1:38:55] As we read in our opening verses where
[1:38:57] Paul wrote in Hebrews 12, "And ye have
[1:39:00] forgotten the exhortation which speakest
[1:39:02] unto you is unto children." My son,
[1:39:05] despise not thou the chastening of the
[1:39:07] Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of
[1:39:09] him. For whom the Lord loveth, he
[1:39:12] chastineth, scourgeth every son whom he
[1:39:15] receiveth, if he endure chastening. God
[1:39:18] dealeth with you as with sons. For what
[1:39:20] son is he whom the father chastineth
[1:39:23] not?
[1:39:28] We make mistakes.
[1:39:30] There are consequences associated with
[1:39:33] our actions, our decisions. God will
[1:39:36] guide us if we let him. Will correct us
[1:39:39] when we stray.
[1:39:41] If we could close this portion of
[1:39:42] tonight's service with a song that it
[1:39:45] seems to summarize David's and our
[1:39:47] situation. Please stand with me as we
[1:39:51] sing on Christ the solid rock I stand.
[1:39:54] Starting with the first verse.
[1:39:59] My hope is built on nothing less than
[1:40:04] Jesus blood and righteousness.
[1:40:08] I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but
[1:40:13] holy lean on Jesus name.
[1:40:18] On Christ the solid rock I stand. All
[1:40:23] other ground is sinking sand.
[1:40:28] All other ground is sinking sand.
[1:40:33] When darkness fails his lovely face I
[1:40:38] rest in his unchanging grace. In every
[1:40:43] high and stormy gale my anchor holds
[1:40:49] within the veil.
[1:40:52] On Christ the solid rock I stand. All
[1:40:57] other ground is sinking sand.
[1:41:02] All other ground is sinking sand.
[1:41:07] His oath is covenant and his blood
[1:41:11] support me in the whelming flood. When
[1:41:16] all around my soul gives way, he then is
[1:41:21] all my hope and stay. Psalm three. On
[1:41:26] Christ the solid rock I stand. All other
[1:41:31] ground is sinking sand.
[1:41:34] All other ground is sinking sand.
[1:41:39] When he shall come with trumpet sound,
[1:41:44] oh may I then in him be found dressed in
[1:41:49] his righteousness
[1:41:51] alone, faultless to stand before the
[1:41:56] throne.
[1:41:57] On Christ the solid rock I stand. All
[1:42:02] other ground it's sinking sand.
[1:42:08] The ground is sinking sand.
[1:42:12] Amen.
[1:42:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:42:16] I uh you know those two guys,
[1:42:19] Hooi and Ahel,
[1:42:23] they were super smart people. They were
[1:42:28] the adviserss to the king. And I know
[1:42:32] that even David, I believe, was a bit
[1:42:34] intimidated when he heard that Hyhel was
[1:42:37] advising Abselum.
[1:42:41] And they both had a choice.
[1:42:44] They had a choice. Who are they going to
[1:42:47] be loyal to?
[1:42:49] Hushi chose David.
[1:42:52] Hyhel chose Abselum.
[1:42:56] And even though they made the even
[1:42:59] though made the wrong choice, God didn't
[1:43:03] take that gift away from him of wisdom.
[1:43:07] And he gave the right advice to Abselum.
[1:43:12] And if Abselum would have followed his
[1:43:14] his advice, maybe the story would be
[1:43:16] different. But he followed Hooi
[1:43:21] who was being deceptive and loyal to
[1:43:23] David. And Hooi played on his pride
[1:43:25] there saying rah rah. And when a hyhel
[1:43:30] heard that um
[1:43:34] he had taken Abselum had taken Hooi's
[1:43:37] advice
[1:43:39] he knew there's no way out of this
[1:43:42] he killed himself. But wow, um such such
[1:43:46] wisdom there and these lessons that
[1:43:50] brother Lyall is teaching us and
[1:43:52] bringing us through these psalms and
[1:43:57] tying them to David and his life are
[1:44:00] just just incredible.
[1:44:03] Um you know, David,
[1:44:07] as brother Loy said, he rested in the
[1:44:09] promises. He he had a he had a promise
[1:44:12] from God and he stood strong with that
[1:44:15] promise.
[1:44:17] I I do appreciate appreciate brother L.
[1:44:19] I appreciate his his ministry
[1:44:24] and you know he uh he said he said you
[1:44:27] know I went to the Septuagent and and
[1:44:31] brother Lionel he said you're a Bible
[1:44:32] reader too. He said he went to the Dead
[1:44:34] Sea Scrolls and he read them directly.
[1:44:37] How much would you like to be able to
[1:44:39] read the original Hebrew like brother
[1:44:41] Lyall? You know, Hebrew, if I if I had
[1:44:43] this right, and I think I do, Hebrew is
[1:44:46] the only language
[1:44:49] that we have record of that went extinct
[1:44:52] and was resurrected. And now there's a
[1:44:55] whole country speaking that language,
[1:44:58] that same language that David spoke in
[1:45:02] the book of Hebrews. So, yeah, what a
[1:45:04] what a great lesson. And and what a
[1:45:06] great friends. Let's not take our
[1:45:07] brother for granted. We all have
[1:45:09] different gifts. I have a different gift
[1:45:12] than brother Aaron. Brother Aaron has a
[1:45:13] different gift. Brother Lyle brings a a
[1:45:16] whole lot of knowledge and wisdom to our
[1:45:20] church. So I do appreciate him. Don't
[1:45:23] ever don't ever forget that we are
[1:45:25] blessed to have what we have. Amen.
[1:45:30] [Music]
[1:45:30] [Applause]
[1:45:34] Did you find the words to that?
[1:45:37] He paid a debt he did not owe.
[1:45:41] He paid a debt. He did not owe. I owed a
[1:45:47] debt I could not pay. I needed someone
[1:45:54] to wash my sins away.
[1:46:00] And now I sing a brand new song. Amazing
[1:46:06] grace all
[1:46:09] Christ Jesus paid a debt that I could
[1:46:14] never pay. One more time.
[1:46:18] He paid a debt he did not owe. I owed a
[1:46:25] debt I could not pay. I needed someone
[1:46:31] to wash my sins away.
[1:46:37] And now I sing a brand new song. Amazing
[1:46:44] grace all day long. Christ Jesus paid a
[1:46:50] debt that I could never pay.

[1:47:03] making the effort to come tonight. God
[1:47:04] bless you, brother. Would you close in
[1:47:06] prayer?

[1:52:16] on Saturday night. Is that our Bible
[1:52:18] study?
[1:52:21] We canceled it.
[1:52:23] Okay. No Bible study. I'll send it I'll
[1:52:27] send it out. No Bible study for the
[1:52:30] youth this weekend. And uh we'll re
[1:52:34] we'll reschedu it. So friends, God bless
[1:52:37] you. And uh don't forget communion.
[1:52:41] We're not canceling that
[1:52:43] communion service this Sunday evening,
[1:52:47] the Lord's supper. A very, very um
[1:52:52] wonderful time that we get to observe.
[1:52:55] And if the Lord's willing, pray with me
[1:52:58] um this week. If the Lord's willing,
[1:53:01] finish my series on Colossians.
[1:53:04] And um I have something on my heart to
[1:53:06] preach to start on later, but maybe not
[1:53:10] this weekend. But for this Sunday,
[1:53:14] I um working on maybe to to minister on
[1:53:19] forgiveness
[1:53:20] and not holding uh any
[1:53:24] animosity in your heart for anybody, no
[1:53:27] matter what they've done. So pray with
[1:53:30] me about that. I think it would be a
[1:53:31] good subject for communion. I'll I'll
[1:53:34] continue praying about it and if the
[1:53:36] Lord changes my mind, I am perfectly
[1:53:38] happy. I just I just want to follow his
[1:53:41] leading. I don't want to follow my own
[1:53:42] leading. I want to follow his leading
[1:53:44] and not just because it sounds good. I
[1:53:46] want to do it because it's him.
[1:53:49] So, let's let's pray in preparation for
[1:53:52] our communion service this Sunday. pray

[1:59:06] because he is friends. He can change a
[1:59:09] life.
[1:59:12] He can change a job.
[1:59:15] He can change a whole spirit in a
[1:59:18] family. Maybe he can change the whole
[1:59:19] spirit in a church.
[1:59:21] And I would invite whoever
[1:59:26] to just open this Bible
[1:59:29] or get down on your knees and taste and
[1:59:32] see.
[1:59:33] For the Lord is good. And once you taste
[1:59:35] it, you're going to want more because
[1:59:38] it's good. God bless you, friends.
