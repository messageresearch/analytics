just sing when he reached down his hand for me just maybe a verse through the course when he reached [Music] reach down his head for me I was lost and undone without God or his son when he reached down his head for me once my soul once my soul was a strand from the heaven and was wretched as could be but my save your peace [Music] [Applause] [Music] when he reached down his head for me I was lost without God or his when he reached down his hand for me I was nearing despair oh I was nearing despair when he came to be there and he showed me that I could be free [Applause] then he left in my

when he reached down his hand for me I was lost without God or his son when he reached down his head forward amen it's hard for me sometimes to stop singing I often think you might say dream or maybe it's more imagination what it will be like in heaven where we'll have just I think of it maybe like a stadium maybe this just goes back to when I was in Africa and all those Believers were just there singing tens of thousands of them just singing to the Lord and the first service we were there was eight hours long and just such a Zeal and a joy for the Lord and sometimes I think that's it's like how Heaven's going to be and this is just a little glimpse of what heaven's going to be and then I don't know if I've I don't know if I've said this here I know I've been told different people this but then several couple years later after that trip to Africa I was at a football game college football game and it was the number one team in the nation at the time and I said to somebody I said to several I said if I am ever in a stadium of 92 000 bail worshipers I'll know what the spirit is like even though there were maybe good players and with good intentions on the team there was a there was a worship there that was and it was such a parallel what God what God does in the spiritual and what Satan was doing in the earth and the natural and sometimes we can just kind of go through life and not realize where brother Branham says we have a moment where right now miss what God's doing right now and we have this is just a glimpse of what we're going to have over there amen sorry sister hope I'll let you say [Music] Jesus is his name [Music] and Jesus is his name he's gone when the lightning flashes he's gone when The Thunder Rolls he's gone way up in heaven he's got way down in my suit and I know God is gone and God don't ever change I know God is good and Jesus is his name he's good if you love him he's going if you do God when you serve him he's gone still when you want and I know God is good and God don't ever change I know God is fine and Jesus is dead you can stand upon his promises he'll do just what he said and I know God is gone and God don't ever change I know God is fine and Jesus is his name he's God in the father he's God in the Sin he's God in the Holy Ghost and I know these three are one yes I know God is God and God don't ever change I know God is gone and Jesus is his name sing it with me I know God is gone [Music] when Jesus is his name [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you God doesn't ever change amen he's good all the time stand and sing a couple more songs before we turn the service over to brother Matthew this evening I have an anchor in my life holding two Solid Rock Amen strong assurance that he gave me that I cannot be lost amen [Music] a strong assurance that he gave me and I cannot be lost let the storms on the water of this life Dash about I've anchored oh I have an anger in my life the strong assurance that he gave me and I cannot be lost the storms [Music] God oh I have an anger in my life a strong assurance that he gave me and I cannot be loved he lost [Music] God will make a way where there seems to be no way God will make a way where there seems to be no way it works in ways we can we cannot see he will make a way for me he will be my hold me closely to his side with love and strength for each new day he will make a way he will make a way oh God where there seems to be no way he works in ways we cannot sing he will make a way for me it will be my God with love and strength for each new day [Applause] go away where

Seated on your throne of grace it's only by your mercy be our sins Lord you have said if we call upon your name we and our families shall be saved your name how should I Got a Friend [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] thank you Jesus Christ father of Love Never failing to forgive each moment is a gift from you today we're only here to tell the world about the Lord commits until

give him a hand clap of praise and all free if you love him Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah yes Lord we rely upon it tonight how true Lord the words to that song are we lord as Believers are relying upon it here tonight so we cry out your name out of Supplication Lord we cry out out of desperation Lord for any situation any problem any issue that we Face here tonight Lord nothing's bigger than our God nothing's too great as Lord you said is anything too hard for the Lord nothing is Lord no matter what we could bring here tonight so we bring our needs now before you we cast them as you said you told us to do to cast your cares upon me for I care for you my burden is light my yoke is easy Lord I pray that you would come now father once again as you came this morning Lord in such a special way we believe Lord that same Spirit Lord that same atmosphere that same anointing Lord that was here this morning morning before we left is still here in this building Lord and you're here to accomplish something you've set out with the purpose and a goal Lord and I just want to yield myself I raise my hands with every individual here saying Lord we just yield our vessels just now to you move us out of the way Lord so that you can come and say what you would like to say speak whatever you would like to speak Lord I am so amazed as I Lord so many times have watched you take just words even in my own life Lord and what would maybe one person would receive I'd get something totally different Lord but in every case you never fail to meet the need Lord so no matter what someone needs here tonight we just raise our hands and say God your word meets the challenge of the hour it meets our problems it meets our difficulties no matter how various and different they are one from another Lord may your word come and meet every situation we ask you Lord Jesus Christ's name amen you love him tonight amen God bless you Zechariah Chapter 12 will turn there again amen thank you for all the music amen Zechariah Chapter 12 we'll just begin reading just pick up right where we were this morning and if the brothers could just have that ready uh and the countdown would just pick up from where we were here in just a moment I think we're at paragraph 79 amen do you love Jesus amen I love him because he first loved me and I'm nothing without him amen and I believe that he's here to meet our expectation I was so blessed just by his presence I trust that you were amen this morning that the Lord was able to move upon your heart and say something to you maybe that it maybe never maybe you know what I love about the word is it's just bottomless it's endless it's like a well that doesn't have an end amen God bless you brother Dan good to see you amen it's a well that doesn't have a bottom it's like just a unending resource amen that we can draw from so whatever you need as the song says put in your order call him up tell him what you want amen you believe that whatever I have need of I can just ask the Lord I believe that he can meet amen my expectation amen we want you to turn to Zachariah chapter 12 we'll just begin reading I wonder if before we do maybe we just pray just bow our heads here and if you haven't need something upon your heart you just want to Bow your head and raise your hand to the Lord and represent it say Lord here's my need something upon my heart that I have Lord you see all these hands that are up now God I just felt led by your spirit just to stop for a moment even before we read Lord and recognize your presence Lord your Prophet taught us the reason churches don't reverence your presence is because they don't recognize it Lord and so tonight we just want to recognize you father that you're here that your holy spirit is in Supreme control not men Lord not an organization Lord not a personality Lord but we just become subservient to you right now holy spirit we just step aside and submit ourselves and surrender ourselves Lord each one of us God I'm just clay Lord imperfect like every person I'm speaking to here to night Lord you called this the foolishness of preaching how that you would take an imperfect man and speak to imperfect people and preach and Perfection would come out of that Lord only you could do that that's Supernatural Lord for We Believe Lord that we're not feeding upon an intellectual word we're not feeding and just thrown in the emotion Lord but this is this is real Zoe life that we have and so God that's what our hearts are hungry for May you meet every need Lord every hand that's been raised whether it was sickness Lord or whatever it would be God I pray that you would come and be Jehovah to all of your children we ask we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church said amen Zechariah Chapter 12 we'll just begin reading and just recap or not recap but read what we uh read this morning verse 2 of Zechariah 12 behold I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about when they shall be in The Siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem now remember what we pointed out to you this morning this is something the Lord says he's going to do and he says here and in that Day verse 3 will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people and all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it let's begin reading here at verse 8 and that day shall the Lord now this is God he didn't send a general he didn't send a nuclear bomb he didn't send a tank but he said I'm going to come down myself this is who's going to defend Israel ultimately is the Lord himself couldn't imagine a greater General than him and he says here in verse 8 and that day shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem now notice how he specifies this and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David he that is feeble shall be is David and the House of David shall be as God as the angel of the Lord before them now remember what we pointed out I won't have you I won't preach to you while you're standing I'll let you sit here and sit here in a minute but remember what we pointed out that the prophet said everything what happens with natural Zion happens to spiritual Zion so natural is natural Israel and spiritual Israel the church doesn't replace Israel we don't believe in replacement uh theology but there's a part that Israel plays in the natural that the church the elected mystical body plays in the spiritual and so notice what he begins saying here when he says the Lord shall defend Israel now notice he says here and let's read it in verse 8 again and then as in that day shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem now not all Israel it doesn't say I'm going to defend the entire nation but he says all those in Jerusalem and then he specifies and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David let's begin reading here at verse 9 and it shall come to pass in that day that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem and I will pour upon the house of all of Israel no I will pour upon the House of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem So within all of Israel there's a special elected set-aside group that God said I'm going to pour my spirit upon this house he says I'll pour upon the house and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and of supplications and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as when morneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn let's just read one verse from chapter 14 two chapters over verse 2 for I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle and the city shall be taken and the house is rifled and the women ravished and half of the city shall go forth into captivity and the residue of the people shall not he says in the residents of the people shall not be cut off from the city then shall the Lord go forth and fight against those Nations as when he fought in the day of battle when the day of the Lord comes you better be on the Lord's Side let's just pray if you just want to just pray over the blessing for the reading of the word God we give you thanks here tonight once again Lord knowing that we've already received a blessing just by reading your word now God I pray that you would come and take your word Lord and break it to your people we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated we're just going to pick up right from where we were where we left off this morning it's amazing when you think of the spirit of Grace that he pours out and he says I'll pour out the spirit of Grace and of Supplication so what is that Spirit of Grace Grace means unmerited favor in other words I didn't do anything to deserve this but somehow I received it I didn't do anything I'm Unworthy of it but the Lord's given it to me so he says I'll pour out I'm going to give them what they would need more than anything at this moment they need Grace more than anything that the Jewish Nation needs today is Grace more than anything that the bride of Christ needs more than anything today is Grace when you look at the things that the prophet of God begin to speak about we're just going to read a few of them here in the countdown if you would put that up brother Peter that would be wonderful I'm just going to begin reading here at paragraph 79 not 77 79 the prophet says what does it represent a spiritual age a spiritual time to where God's going to have a spiritual astronaut amen they're here right now Hallelujah the Eagles of the air that can go beyond the other bird and sell above everything spiritual astronauts that can take the word of God and prove that he's the same yesterday today and forever our spiritual astronaut oh my that makes me feel good glory living in this age now what a wonderful thing for Spiritual astronauts so you notice in this message countdown brother Brandon's trying to bring something across that you'll see also in the following messages after this to say that it was a wonderful thing when God poured out his Spirit upon Luther and and an entire age of people was justified under his message and those that believed his message it was a it was the age of the horse and buggy it was a wonderful uh achievement and he says in everything that the man that man has been allowed to achieve in the natural God was proven in the natural that something was taking place in the Supernatural it uses man's achievements and he begins to talk about the automobile and and he would type that automobile with Wesley in his message of sanctification and how that those who were Sanctified under Wesley that in the group of all of those people who just were took a profession and then lived any old way yet that within that group there was people who were really Sanctified and then he talks about Azusa and Pentecost in the 1906 Azusa Street Revival that that was a moment a momentous moment in history it was a marker it was a junction it was an important moment that God had placed in his drama Before Time began that there would be this moment and this marker and this group long before God had established and determined where it would take place what would happen when it took place the fruits of what would happen The Men Who were involved daddy Seymour and Welch and you go study some of the Seymour and Welch Revival and read the original Revival that poured out when the gifts of the Spirit will return to the church let me tell you something friends it wasn't the work of man it was the work of Jehovah because he made a promise in the Book of Joel I'll restore all the Palmer worm and all that the caterpillar and all that the canker worm has taken out of my church so what was one of the things that he removed the gifts of the Spirit the gifts of speaking in tongues the gift of faith the gift of wisdom the gift of healing the gift of Miracles those are all Miracle or gifts that are mentioned in the book of Corinthians that were to the inheritance of the church that had been lost but now God was going to begin to restore them but notice it was a power that was greater than the horse and buggy the horse and buggy was powerful at that day you would think man this is really cutting edge technology a horse and a buggy but to them it was the best way to get from one side of the town to the next side of the town but that's all they had but it's how God restored and brother Branham says notice that achievement something as small as that it was representative that God had moved up he had moved further he had restored more then he goes from there and he begins to talk about the air the automobile and how that when they Henry Ford built that model T in that first Ford combustion engine that God had put it onto the heart of Henry Ford and the heart of man to accomplish something in the natural that would only be a representation of something significant in the Supernatural and he says notice what did it the notch what did the natural scientists do uh let me turn this on so it'll work here he says what did the natural scientists do has been able to achieve that and God through man notice with God through man would stay with the Bible and say that he's the same yesterday today and forever and not afraid of the promise regardless of what anybody said stay with it what is it you become an astronaut that can go so far it's beyond notice keyword it's beyond any he says it's beyond denominational thinking it wasn't to do away with what the denominational thinking was it wasn't to do away with anything God had given but he says it's beyond anything else it's beyond the things of the church out yonder with God and him alone you stay astronauts in order notice he says and remember in order to get to be an astronaut they had to get in a tank and they can't control themselves it takes radar power anatomic power to lift him out beyond space and then he's controlled by a tower listen how brother random starts to type this Glory God's spiritual astronaut is the same they come into a tank and into a place to a body and that body is the body of Christ then it's not them it wasn't John Glenn it was the tank that he was in it was the machine he just sat there he didn't do any nothing he just had the real pure courage to get up there and say it's right because science had proved it God wants man who can come into Christ and believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever remember what brother random says about his own message he said it wasn't me who appeared on the river it wasn't me who appeared there I was only standing there when he appeared the prophet would later after the seal say I don't declare to you I'm not here to declare to you to say that the Lord the Lord is coming I'm here to declare he's here his presence he's here by the person of his word he's the angel of the Covenant he's backing up these things that you see Vindicated are to lift up Christ they're to raise your faith and put your faith and anchor it in something listen and he says notice here he says God wants man who can come into Christ and believe he's the same yesterday today and forever and don't take their own thinking move out into space controlled by the Holy Ghost that's my prayer Lord he says how far it is back from the old horse and buggy how far it is even from the airplane how far it is from justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost they're coming to Eagles the first they were lizards then they become chickens then they become crows but now they're Eagles I love that first a lizard and the horse and buggy right only the prophet could say it that way then they become chickens in the cars then they become crows in the sky but now we're astronauts and he says no one can follow them and he goes a special bird it can go higher than any other bird he's prepared to see keep his head level when he gets up there there's some people can jump way up don't know where they're at after they get there because he can't see no further than what he's jumped but there's some that can look back and see what's going on that's the eagle he can stand there till he looks it over and waits till he hears a message that tells him what to say that's the astronaut of God see it's followed all the other achievements so no notice what he says in the next paragraph astronauts for Jesus how many astronauts we got here tonight don't even leave by his own power he's fired out one thing he does is get into it do you realize what the prophet is teaching us here you don't have to manufacture the power of the Holy Ghost that brings about the body change you just have to get into the word and the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost will do the rest you don't have to manufacture a move of God you don't have to manufacture Revival there's a lot of a lot of churches Pentecostal churches whoop it up Whip It Up holler it up but you know a real move of God is Not based upon what you what you emotionally feel based upon some whoop up or pep rally but it's when you see the word of God as John seen the word of God and John said all that was in heaven all that was in the earth heard I John say worthy Worthy is the Lamb what was it he's seen himself in the book and he says here he says notice you just have to get in it that's all you have to do is get into God God he says get into it God will do the shooting and the placing it ain't gasoline power no more neither some church Creed it's God's Adam power that push it pushes you Plum out of space out yonder amen why what is it these astronauts they've got they they just took the word justification just the word sanctification he's got into the whole Bible amen he's got into all of it because that he knows that God is able to perform every promise he ever made he just sits there and waits he doesn't have to do nothing as we said their vision is turned when they sit in that ass in that spaceship before they take off their entire vision changes from the Earthly and they're looking at the heavenly their eyes are focused on one thing they're not trying to manufacture no you don't see no astronaut getting out of there pouring the jet the rocket fuel in there hoping the Rocket's going to take off what is it he's already put his confidence in the thing but that's why brother Branham says all it takes is for a man to have enough confidence to get in it and he says they've got he says he just sits there and wait oh my the word is bound to manifest itself if you're sick and an astronaut just remember get in Christ wait the countdown that's all he'll fire the bullet don't worry he's been able to achieve it because God's promised it I'd encourage you to go read that message the countdown it's just wonderful notice here so he says what's he going to pour out this is the spirit of Grace and supplication so it's a it's a it's a spirit of Grace which means unmerited favor something God is going to pour out I looked at this word supplication it was incredible to me because when you when you when you look at this word simply at a Justice at a very basic level it just means the word prayer so he says I'm going to pour upon Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and prayer but look a little deeper into that word prayer and do you know what the the exact word that the Lexicon gave me desperation desperation now if you're spiritual if you're if you're a Believer here tonight you'll know that brother Brandon preaches the message the token which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then comes to the evening Med comes to the message desperation it says something God gave me that was even more momentous than that message on the token it was a Capstone to the Token was the message desperations Lord Make Me desperate so what is this prayer that the Jew is praying God says I'll pour upon before he ever steps foot on the Mount of Olives before he ever comes down and fights for Israel for Jerusalem he first pours upon the House of David the spirit of Grace why Grace because they're going to need Grace why it's death so what does he bring desperations what is that prayer of desperations that prayer of desperation is the same thing that you've got to come brother random says until the church gets into desperations until she gets to a place to where she's so desperate that she wants the word lived in her life more than her daily bread and so what is he saying at the moment at the climax this is the crescendo this is the Day of Reckoning this is Armageddon this is when all nations have surrounded Israel a United Nations Army surrounds Israel this surrounds Jerusalem destroys its City plunders rifles the houses and at the moment of total despair Holocaust Holocaust part two is what it would probably feel like what it's going to probably feel like to the Jew but at the moment of total despair God says now I'm going to pour out my spirit of Grace because you're undeserving of this you're undeserving of it but they're his children and he says I'll pour out the spirit of Grace and supplication God has a way of reorchester of orchestrating your life and reorganizing things that bring tension and bring pressure and bring Calamity and you say why is this happening in my life right now because God's trying to pour out a spirit of Supplication of desperation when that Jew can say Lord I don't deserve it I don't know why you'd ever choose me but somehow you chose me I don't know why you would ever do it Lord I'm not worth it Lord I've been so hard-hearted and stiff-necked but you've poured on the spirit of Grace and supplication and the Bible says that when he pours that Spirit upon them all of Israel will become like David Like a Warrior all of Israel will suddenly their their hearts will be encouraged and God says then I'll step in the battlefield and I'll judge all the nations who've came to destroy it to to destroy Israel oh what a wonderful type so notice here he says it's the spirit of Grace unmerited favor and supplication it's a direct correlation to you and me look at our history notice this this is what God says brother Adam says what will be poured out upon the church and he says I believe there's coming I didn't have time to put it here on the on the slide but even in the message countdown brother Brandon begins to talk about the former and the latter rain will be poured out upon that group of people what is it going to be it's going to be rapturing grace brother random says here in the message to trial and you got this on the PowerPoint brother Peter if you could just play that display that second slide he says now still they won't believe it I'm just going to take a little turn and I'm going to try to do better tonight about my time uh I went in double overtime this morning so we're going to try to stay in single over time no I'm just kidding foreign notice what he says here now now still they won't believe it Jesus promised us it was in the days of Noah and as it was in the days of lot it would be in the last day we've got it it's here so remember what we talked about there's a special marker this was a moment this wasn't just a man speaking this wasn't just the voice of a Kentucky hillbilly this wasn't just another another moment in time he says we've got it this is the trial 1964. we've got it it's here it's already Vindicated just how many scriptures in the Sodom age what happened to Abraham when we turn back again to Abraham's Royal seed which is in Christ Christ returning in the form of the word working in human beings and showing the signs that he promised it would sign it would do he promised that he would do it God promised it and God will keep his promise so what is he trying to get them to understand in this message is the trial is Something's Happened it's not it's not not sure not it wasn't what you had yesterday it wasn't what Luther had it was greater it wasn't what Wesley had it was greater it wasn't what Pentecost said it was greater it wasn't the gift now it's The Giver it wasn't just his gift now it's his person why would brother Branham stand and turn his back to the audience and begin to discern the hearts of people with his back turn it was a sign of Melchizedek who had his back to the tent and discerned the heart of Sarah you say that was an accident brother Matt that was a momentous moment and it was trying to get you to understand something has happened something's taken place it was the Fulfillment of Luke 17 30. that as it was in the days of lots so shall it be in the days of the coming of the son of man so he says some things happen something's different it's greater than the greater than the automobile it's greater than the jet aircraft it's an astronaut age and there's nothing Beyond it there's nothing Beyond it so what was it we we use this term and I'm just going to go through some of this and I just the Lord is so impressed us upon my heart we use this term that the word was opened that they are the opening of the word so you say brother Matt what that sounds so clicheish what does it mean when you preachers say the the do you do you believe in the opening of the word let me just simplify it and this is an oversimplification I understand but let me just simplify it what is the opening of the word it's the opening of this Bible in its most simplistic way to say this brother Branham said it this way the Bible has became a whole new book so he said I looked at everything differently it's it's it's different than what the reformer thought it's not that God didn't use the reform remember one remember what we read this morning the one compliments the other you don't do away with Delta Airlines just because we got astronauts I still need a Delta to get here to Tucson but that doesn't mean there's not an astronaut we don't do away with one just because there's a greater it doesn't mean we do away with the framework right and so he says what was it it was the opening of the Bible that had been probed at for hundreds of years and brother random says it this way but with he says with a blindfold with a blindfold they would look at the word and they could feel the word and oh I think it's this no I think he's this no it was a an apple it was it was an allegory in the beginning it was just spoke of Adam's Disobedience they probed at it and brother Madam says when they probed at it they got some right some wrong some a little off some a little twisted they came up with three gods so what did God have to do he removed the blindfold by the Mighty God unveiling himself and that so what was it it was the opening it was what men had probed that theologians had probed that see you say brother Matt then what is the message of the hour it's the son of man revealing himself or unveiling himself that's the prophet's words and he's identifying himself by his word through a Melchizedek sign through a prophet so the word was made flesh working what did we just read here he's working in human beings the word was made flesh through a badger skin of a man you know I said I realized something the other day and I thought it was incredible it is so amazing to me how the religion and tradition is always just one step behind God always you notice in the days of Jehovah it was only a small select group of people who believed in the god of Jehovah but by the time Jesus comes on the scene and he's the Fulfillment of all of the Old Testament prophets now you have masses accepting Jehovah and you have a mo a small multitude accepting Jesus and so they accept Jehovah now that the anointed word is no longer under the law of Moses now the anointed word is became flesh and they crucified Jesus and then Jesus leaves the scene and now what do we have we have the administration of the spirit and now masses accept Jesus man I don't know if you realize that everybody's a Christian I don't know if y'all have that way in here but let me just speak for South Carolina everybody's a Christian I mean you ask someone are you a Christian and they'll say I'm a republican ain't I I voted for Trump right and so they they almost become synonymous one with the other everybody's a Christian so it religion is always one step behind the anointed word but now that the anointing word moves through a prophet they reject God's prophet and accept Jesus and now you have people who can why did Brother Branham say he said man never has trouble seeing God yesterday or God tomorrow but they have trouble seeing God today and so they accept that they they accept the prophet the word of God becoming flesh behind the seventh messenger but they reject that the word comes flesh in the body and so we're let me just say this I'm going to give some principles here and we don't have time to break them down really but I'm just going to say a few things here that will we can just say as principles so let me say it this way you're not living in the horse and buggy age you're not living in the in the automobile age you're not living in the jet aircraft age you're living in the astronaut age they're living in the age where brother Brandon would preach the seed is not Heir shall not be air with the shuck so he said what what happened through Panic through through Luther through Wesley all the way up to the restoration of the gifts the shuck pulls away when the grain manifests itself now do we do away with the chuck with the tassel no with the stalk no but we've moved Beyond this is what the prophet is trying to get them to see you've moved Beyond something you're not living in the age of partial truth anymore you're living not with a partial understanding but with the fullness of all that God wanted to give his church of all that God wanted to express of all God wanted to reveal you know what the you know what you restored back to everything the first church had oh I should get a loud hearty amen if this is a message church you've been restored back to everything the first church had and when I say that I mean all of it you know what that you know what the first church had the first church had all the gifts of the Spirit they had all the fruits of the spirit they had all the workings of the Holy Spirit they didn't leave off anything they didn't cut out anything so it wasn't a partial it was a fullness and so what is God doing so so what happens is that the brother random tells us and the seed shall not be aired with the Sheck and I think I may have it I don't let's just read this first Thessalonians 4 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with a voice and the arcade of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up that word is harpazzo you know what that word literally means to be snatched out oh boy that sounds good to me brother Aaron snatch me out Lord this is what it means it says then we shall enlife that are alive and remain shall be snatched out we shall be pulled out of it and in the midst of when it gets so bad and and then it's dark as dark can get she gets pulled out of it all and so he says this is this is how this is this is what's to the believer he says the Lord himself shall be uh the Lord himself shout a sin from heaven with the shout notice in Revelations 10 and I saw another Mighty Angel crowned with a loud voice as when a lion roared and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets let me just be careful so I don't move too fast through this so he says the shock pulls away and this happens at the opening of The Seven Seals so Revelations 10 which is what we just read from Revelations 10 so that it shows us that the that Christ would unveil himself in all of his fullness not a partial not a misunderstanding but a loud voice as when a lion roarth what was that loud voice it was to silence all other voices it would be a clear distinct as when a lion roarth it's the answer it's the indole it removes all doubt can you say Amen notice he says here now notice the very day when this messenger not when he starts out but when he begins to declare his message see the first bull healing second Bull prophesied third pull the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed no more there is no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word and remember the third pool was the opening of film Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word do you see it yes brother Branham I see it thank the Lord and so he says here he says still they won't believe it this is the message the trial that we read from and he's showing that he's gone as Christ is returning in the form of the word so as we said here the last time we were here so his his returning would be different then everything that was previous ly thought it was different than everything previously looked at it was more as brother random says over and over and that message the countdown this is something greater it's something further it's something not to do away with the previous but it complements the next it's greater power with less work the buggy the automobile was more power more horses less work the jet aircraft more power less work the astronaut more power less work and so brother Madam says what is this now brother Peter if you have that PowerPoint that I sent you the God of all time we're just going to turn a corner here and then find a stopping point notice notice this here we spent a lot of time to talk about this this morning because when you look at everything that we spoke about that it's a good that it's a great drama that everything that has happened God has already charted he's already planned it he's already charted it he's already scripted it and so to God it's like a rerun it's already happened now he says here and notice this notice this here brother random says he fills all time and then they have time to put this quote up here in all space and all eternity he's the God of all time David said it this way my time is in your hands Lord all my goings all my Cummings my raising my let my laying down all of it's in your hands Nebuchadnezzar had to realize this and confess it after God put him and made him made him like an animal that it wasn't a man who would be the great ruler of all kingdoms of the Earth but it would be Jehovah who was the king of all nations of the Earth we said it this morning that he was like the great Potter that molds The Vessel it molds the clay so all events that are happening are being controlled not by the Democrat might not by the as my dad says the demon Kratz are the Republicans none of it's being controlled by them they may think it is But ultimately it's been controlled by prophecy because that controls everything you have this word and and and it's and it's almost how you view time they call it the philosophy of History how you view this linear line that we call time and we make sense of that by yesterday or the past in the present and the future and it really just means how do you view or how do you think of that line called history which we referred to it today it's not history it's his story so there are five different types of this philosophy of history when you look at any person any philosopher any person writing a book they're going to have their own philosophy of how they view time and so so they they would they would notice a certain pattern or they'd try to find a certain pattern with history and to make sense of of of of the present you have to look and find a pattern from history so when you when you read a newspaper let me just say it this way when you read a newspaper uh or you read the news online most people don't read newspapers but you read the news or you you you look at something you could say do you see a pattern do you see something emerging that that something's taken place do you see a pattern of what's almost like a timeline almost like events that are leading up to something do you see any purpose or is it just repeated you know yesterday what was yesterday will be today and then what's tomorrow will be yesterday and today is just the same as it will be tomorrow and it's just the same as it was yesterday and there's really nothing new it just all just sort of randomly goes so it's just it's just like a it's it's it's it's the word let me just say this to you this morning that this evening there are people who view time as that wave and it's just happening I'll live here today I'll I'll I'll die one day and then my children or my grandchildren and and and time will go on and whatever Legacy I've left I'll just go out of his existence and time just keeps going on and going on and going on until finally all the polar caps melt and and then finally somewhere there's an apocalypse in the end of the world and then Humanity goes out of existence there's people who literally live every single day with that philosophy of their life that's why the Apostle Paul would say if in this life only I had hope I would be he says if this life was the only life I had I would be of all men most miserable it's like we preached on it before it's like a roundabout you ever get on a roundabout you know we have those back home just a traffic circle and you know the the point of that roundabout is to get off that roundabout it's not to go around and around and around and around and around and if you ever do that your people think you're a tourist and you're not from there you just go around and around and around and around but some people's lives are like this they just go around about the roundabout round about the roundabout no Direction no purpose not really coming where are they coming from I'd rather random called it like the man he talked it was a Drifter where'd you come from oh you know here and there where are you going oh I don't really know just here and there just sort of drifting and so they they come on this roundabout of life that I'm just you know I was just born and so so I just go through this cycle this great cycle of life I I wake up every day I've got a career I wake up I I say goodbye to my family I go to work I work a job whatever that is with my hands or whatever it is I get done with work put in my eight hours go home say hello to my family veg on entertainment take a shower brush my teeth go to bed I wake up the next day and I go back to work I say goodbye to my family I work all day I come home I greet my family I veg on entertainment I go to bed and then I wake up and then I go back to work and I work eight hours a day and then I come home and I Vigilant entertainment then I wake up the next day and I work eight hours the next day then I come home you want me to keep going and people just go around and around and around and around and around and around and then they go for 50 60 years and then they retire and they step off the roundabout about about the point where they stepped off and that's how they live their life but let me tell you that's not how God's called ordained your life you've got a purpose you've got a plan you're headed somewhere you're not part of a circle you're part of a linear line that leads from this Dimension to another dimension and so my life is a purpose when I read the word of God let me just stop here and say for a minute you can read the word of God like a newspaper like a story and that's good sometimes I mean it's not not a bad thing you know it's not a bad thing to read the Bible like a story there are great stories out of it I mean you know you should get a children's Bible one time it's wonderful children's Bible you read through I remember reading through a children's Bible and I'm literally looking at things going wait a minute is that in the Bible and then open my bible and go oh yeah actually it is in the Bible what was it it was it was a way that I had never heard it before or said it and then it opens my mind that there's a way we need teaching we need good Sunday school we need to we need to learn about these things but let me just say this I'm not reading the word just like a newspaper or an edge of academic knowledge that I can again in my head I'm not reading that I'm not reading the word like a horoscope to see what kind of day or what kind of life and how God can better my life but when I read the word I I got a desire to know where do I fit in where's my purpose in the midst of all of this plan where's my spot what's my day in its message what has God ordained for me specifically I want to find the purpose not just for the whole universe but I want to know where do I fit in and all of that great universe so notice here there's there's different five different patterns that people in our world see world events four of these five are being thrown at us in the world today if we're not careful you say to the mat why are you saying that because it's so important the lens the lens that you have when you look at time it's so important how you frame what's happening in your mind and when you have a perspective of a horse and buggy it will be totally different than the perspective of the automobile and the automobile will have a totally different perspective than the jet aircraft but guess what the astronaut has a whole different View and brother Brandon said this morning you're a spiritual astronaut you look at things differently you're an oddball and that's good you're not normal to the rest of the world you're not I don't fit in you're not supposed to fit it I mean if you believe the words of Jesus he's the one who said they hated me they'll hate you so notice here it's the philosophy of History sorry these are too small for you to read just I'm just going to go through some of them here you have this first cyclic View in the cyclic view it just means history is going nowhere it's just no pattern there's no purpose just history just keeps repeating and repeating and there's good times and then there's bad times and then there's Christmas and then there's birthdays and then there's funerals and it's just part of like there's really no pattern and no purpose and it's just a great big cycle going round and around and around and around and around history just keeps repeating itself we have some good men raise up good leaders then we have bad leaders then it's just a big old you know big old roundabout you know as we said you just get on the roundabout then you get off somewhere and retire in life and that's really it and then you have the Epic view of history epic view of History it goes forward it's a it's a forward we're going forward but it goes forwards and ups and then downs and you sort of hope your life ends on an up and not a Down and it's just this you know good times rich people then there's poor people there's inflation and deflation and then you have the optimistic view of History that history is getting better it's the optimistic view brother Aaron we're we're increasing in technology and education and Science and you know the new scientific discoveries and it's just getting better and and I agree there's been some great advancements out of modern medicine but this idea that that all of our hope is in our scientists and discovering education and they spend billions on NASA and trying to find alien life and and and what is it it's all an optimistic view we're trying to it's a hope and God put that hope in man but he's channeling it through the wrong thing he'll never find his hope in education or science there's only hope in one thing and that's the word there will be no peace until Jesus comes and so there's this optimistic view life's getting better all the time in the 1900s this is what everybody thought oh it's just getting better and better and but better you know you could sum up this entire view with this word progress progressives we're just progressing we're moving forward and and and and and and everything's just going to get better it's just to get better it's going to get better it's going to get better you know a British it's incredible the British prime minister won an election on this slogan up and up and up and on and on and on a powerful slogan up and up and up and on and on and on it'll just get better you know they thought at the turn of the 20th century Humanity thought this was going to be the greatest era of human history it was optimistic it's going to be the greatest in Discovery with all the modern inventions and all the modern discoveries it's going to help us overcome all of our problems and all life is going to be good life is going to be better and better and better this was Charles Darwin's View in the view of evolution that will evolve and get better and we'll get better and we'll get better and just keep going up and up and up how opposite is that from the Bible view of since the fall man has been going down and down and down it'll just get better and better and man's evolving and Technologies involving we're increasing everything will just get better and Mankind entered the 20th century with that High Hope of of of of of of of optimism then you know what happened the Titanic the boat they said God can't even sink went to the bottom of the ocean and with it sunk all man's hopes for the greatest Century of modern invention it was the first you could say it this way the largest man-made object ever built filled in its vessel it was representative of man's greatest achievements oh this is incredible you think about this for a moment the Titanic was representative of man's best efforts of his best scientist of his best Engineers of his best it was all represented in the Titanic with his greatest Technologies in so much that man was so arrogant they would say God himself couldn't sink it so you know what God did please don't get what he did he sunk it and still let me say this still the Titanic is the most popular shipwreck in history you know why it pricked the bubble of great optimism it was the first bubble in progress it was the first major disaster of the 20th century and it challenged man's ability it challenged science it challenged education and so you say brother Matt did what follows that what follows the Titanic is the first woe of World War One or if you study World War One you want to talk about an overwhelming number it's unfathomable the amount of death that world war one brings I believe it's a third of all Europeans uh uh I I don't want to quote the number here just read it just the other day but the amount of death that World War One brought it was one of the greatest terrors it was one of the greatest Horrors of mankind this after all of our effort and all of our progress now World War one where the entire world is at War and you know what Humanity scene just an unfortunate event just a uh you know a a man who was out of his mind just a a a narcissistic uh you know Adolf Hitler but you know what God had already seen it in Prophecy and God had already prophesied and used used a vision through it through the through through a prophet to to prophesy about the rise of Adolf Hitler and the rise of fascism Nazism and communism and so man looked at us just another event but it you know what it was it was an important marker it was a momentous moment that would change everything and no one would ever be the same from World War one then what did you have that followed World War Two it was the optimistic view of history that had been at that point completely destroyed in fact the 20th century was could be labeled the worst of all centuries so you have the pessimistic view I think I have it on the next slide the pessimistic View was that things are not getting better they're getting worse they're getting worse and worse and worse and worse destruction is unavoidable there's global warming the melting of the polar caps we're all going towards doomsday and we're all gonna everything's gonna everything's gonna end now there's a lot of Truth to both of these views you see what they're mixing and the optimistic and the pessimistic View the pessimistic view says things are getting worse history is going downhill not uphill we're doomed to destruction the economy is going to crash we're all going to die in a nuclear bomb the cyclic View the Epic View you have the optimistic View you have the pessimistic View sorry for my simple labels here the up and then the down and worse and worse and worse say brother Matt then what view do we have we have the God view you see brother Matt what is the God view the God view says that yes things will steadily get worse and worse and worse and worse and go down all the way to where it looks completely hopeless and then suddenly out of nowhere with no build up to the rest of the world no one notices anything suddenly the God view says history is going to get worse and worse and worse but then out of nowhere it's going to get better who's going up on that Arrow to say Lord I'm not going down with the rest of the world there's going to be a harpazzo where I'm snatched out of all of it oh it may look like for Israel that all hope is lost but at the moment when all hope is lost God steps in and it may look like your life is all lost but just wait God's at the darkest moment God at The Darkest Hour just just before the dawn and God steps in and changes everything and we don't just go on a sudden incline we go straight up notice this here and I'm just going to skip some of these slides brother Peter sorry to have you go back and forth go to my previous one I'm going to skip some of these here that I have notice what he speaks about the Jews brother Adam says in the Revelation slide 10 of the first one I sent you brother Peter the the hour of Grace and supplication I'm going to close you all right and he says in the revelation of Jesus Christ yes thank you the Gen this Gentile message as the Jews brought it to the Gentiles the Gentiles would take it right back to the Jews again and the Rapture will come I'm looking forward to that day now he will pour out upon the house of Israel what the same Holy Spirit see they don't receive anything different than what you receive why does God send them Moses and Elijah Purdue prophets to give them the same thing a jubilees coming to Israel for the second time Pentecostal fall for the second time in Jerusalem and now speak with other tongues and great Miracles we don't know what we don't know what's going to happen because it's not I won't be here that Joseph dismissed his uh the queen to the palace and then revealed himself to Benjamin so where will you be I'll be at the waiting for the wedding supper I'm already married right here and I'm going to a supper one day oh but notice brother Adam says what happens he reveal he says God will pour out a spirit the same Holy Spirit after the Gentile church is gone not only will it be a mournful time for the Jews who rejected him as Messiah but it'll be a mournful time for them left Gentiles back here who has accepted notice this it'll be a mournful time for those Jews as we just read and I can't imagine I was reading this in Zechariah the early morning hours and I just stopped for a minute and thought I can't imagine you you imagine the the the the the the embarrassment or shame as the Bible says them they'll be bitter like in bitterness of them on themselves that they realize this is this is this is this is who you've pierced this is who you've crucified I was so wrong I was so wrong all those years I was so wrong you know what God will say what did Joseph say don't worry what the enemy intended for evil God has made for good and brother random says he'll reveal himself to them notice it won't be just a mournful time for them Jews but also them gentiles who has rejected him as their Messiah of this day they'll be welling and weeping the sleeping virgin will be willing that's the church that refused to get oil in its light do not think of a church you passed on the way to this church tonight don't think of the denominational system where the foolish virgin will be listen friends it's not a group it's individual basis it will be all individuals who refused to get the light into their vessel you say what is that light it's the light of the Holy Ghost it won't be those who just accept mentally the message of the hour that God sent in Prophet won't be those who just pay the biggest tithes or go on the most mission trips it's not going to be that friends it's going to be those that that wise virgin has trimmed their lamps and they're ready they're waiting they're watching they're an expectation for the coming of the Lord their entire life their perspective is different he says that's the church that refused to get oil oh I wonder if you could just raise a hand and say Lord let me get make sure I have oil let me get oil in my vessel and he says so I pray tonight I love this faith of Abraham so I prayed tonight father that you'll wake up somebody to the knowledge to know that unless they're born again of the spirit of God has received and then become Abraham's seed that they'll never be able to make the rapture how desperate brother Brandon says it takes true desperation that God literally can reprogram your if you're a seed of God and a child of God God will break your wallet he will break your health he'll break your home he'll do whatever he has to do to genuine to generate desperation out of a seed of God because he said I'll not lose any of them brother Brandon says let may you wake somebody up tonight to realize they'll never go in that Rapture without the baptism of the Holy Ghost so I pray father that you'll give rapturing Grace what is Rapture in Grace oh it's just some oh I don't really know what it is brother Matt is just some kind of Hocus Pocus you know at that moment I'll just live any old life I want to and just keep living a carnal life and then bam boom just Rapture and Grace no that's that's that's that's a deception on the LIE of the devil you want to know what your rapture in Grace is it's right here be born of the spirit of God this is your rapture in Grace this is what gives you rapturing Grace the Holy Ghost enables you and a a free it it avails you of all the promises of God and he says so I pray you give them Rapture and Grace tonight oh Jehovah Jireh now we've seen all kinds of great moves and shouting and praising God oh fine we're not doing away with any of that we want that we need that I experience that I want to experience more of that and he says we've spoken tongues and prophesied no one's doing away with that we've spoken tongues and prophesied at all we've seen all of that that's fine listen what he says that comes right along with it but remember the last thing is his divine presence the word itself he is the word the head why would brother Brandon have to say this over and over and over to the Pentecostal Church they wanted the signs they wanted the Wonders they wanted the Miracles they wanted the tongues but they didn't want the word because the word brought correction he says what comes last is the word he's the word that had the word it's coming to the body it's coming to the body now it's not some man here is the messiah it's the holy spirit is the messiah Christ and the Holy Spirit is the same thing so here it is now just working in the flesh getting the body ready for rapturing Grace believe it friends but I pray this is countdown we read from this message just one of the last ones I'm going to read here he says but I pray that you'll give them such a crave I love the way brother Brandon prays this in his prayer because some people say I'm not where I want to be I'm not where I'm not I know that in my life it looks like a mess brother Matt I'm not where I want to be then you say what do I do I pray that God gives you a crave pray that God gives you a desire if you don't have it you can at least pray for that brother Brandon says I pray that you give them such a crave for it Lord that they'll come and see where at the end time the astronaut age I pray father they'll realize it isn't trying to condemn what they had it isn't trying to condemn what they had it's only trying to give them more it isn't trying to condemn them for what they have trying to give them more if you want more there's more if you've got a craving for something more there's more and he says it isn't trying to condemn them for what they had he said it's only trying to give them more rapturing grace for the hour will come and we'll have to have Rapture power not only to heal the body but to change it in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and he says Christ you say how brother Matt how is that going to happen listen to what he says Christ will be so real into their bodies till he can change it I don't know about you but when I read this quote in my home I just raised up my hand and say then let Christ be more real than he's ever been in my whole life that's my prayer is that your prayer tonight let Christ become so real in my body till he can change it brother random says let him become so real by his great death and what he's purchased may they take this today that token that I spoke of last night hold it before them and walk into this astronaut Granite father where Visions powers and worlds be unknown oh God where all the great mysteries of God is unfolded in those Seven Seals and made known to man granted father is that your prayer here tonight I wonder if you could stand to your feet with me and just bow your heads to the Lord just for a moment every head bowed every I closed just reverent now to the Lord something's happening let me just say it that way something's taken place I said it over and over and over again this morning whether you or I are on the sideline and not part of it some things happen happens we read it here tonight God's doing something all the time he's not static he's not stagnant he's Dynamic he's moving [Music] and how to say Lord let me be a part of it I wonder how many would just raise a hand not to me I'm not even looking and just say to the Lord Lord let me miss it don't let me be so caught up and distracted by what's happening around me that I miss what you're doing right now one of these days that message will go to Israel God will send unto them Moses and Elijah and Revelations 11 and they'll do signs and wonders in Jehovah's sign while the Gentile is finished the grace the day of Grace will leave the Gentile Church the denominations will continue on because they come up here with a sleeping virgin but when they do when they do that the Jews will receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that'll be their day but let me say this to you young person let me say this to you old young person let me say this to you elderly foreign right now is your day of Grace and supplication today is the day of salvation not tomorrow don't be like Felix of Paul who said leave me Paul for at a more convenient time out the Bible says it Paul's word so convicted Felix that he he came under conviction but then he said just leave me I don't want to hear this right now my life's too busy can't contemplate that we don't ever know what happened to it oh don't be guilty of that just open up your heart right now while he's knocking If any man will hear my voice and open up

this alone amen and I appreciate that as brother Matt was speaking it brought it brought something to my memory we had just moved here in 1976 this message had come and and you know 46 years ago 47 years ago it was just all new to us things we hadn't hadn't even heard didn't realize it was in the Scriptures it just hadn't been some family of ours came over to see us about a year later and he had been our pastor in the Pentecostal Church and he loves the Lord my uncle still loves the Lord with all his heart but he made some comments and out of my my voice came this I said but Uncle we are seeing things today in this scripture that you have never seen before in your life I don't even know why he said it but now I know why because God was unveiling himself unveiling and if we're not careful we say okay that's enough of the book we gotta say Lord be it unto me according to Thy Word every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line oh every promise in the book is my marriage after every verse every night I am trusting in his love divine every promise in the book is mine every promise in the book is mine sign your name to it every chapter every verse every time trusting in his love divine every promise in the business filling the amount he's already signed a check and said it's yours fill in that which you have made us Lord we thank you for your word today it's not a new mystery it's not something we've never heard but Lord sometimes it'll just click it'll just suddenly come together Lord it is something that has been in the scripture it's not a new book that had never been written down lord but it's just something that suddenly becomes real to us Lord in its time and in its place Lord each one being a child of God maybe maybe as a little child as a baby they're born into a royal family but they don't know that yet their children they cry like children they act like children lord they're just but as they begin to grow and as they begin to to to get some knowledge of what is happening and begin to see they realize that they were born into a royal family father not of their own doing Lord but it's of your doing father we are part of this royal family because you chose us Lord and we recognize it today that you're our father we are your children we're Heirs of this great Promises of God and every promise in the book is our sword and we have a right to it it pleases the father when he sees his sons his daughters come and saying that's mine I can have it I can partake of it it pleases the father Lord Lord let us be pleasing to you Lord let us take it by faith and live it by Faith Lord because every promise is included Lord for all that was in Christ God God he poured into Christ and all that was crying Christ he poured into
