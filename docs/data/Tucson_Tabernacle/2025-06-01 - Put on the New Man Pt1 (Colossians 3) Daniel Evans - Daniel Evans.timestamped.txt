[6:37] wonderful. You may be
[6:40] [Music]
[6:46] seated. In Christ
[6:50] alone my hope is found.
[6:55] He is my light, my
[6:57] strength, my
[7:00] song. This corner
[7:04] stone and this solid
[7:09] ground firm through the fiercest
[7:13] droughting storm.
[7:16] What heights of
[7:19] love, what depths of
[7:23] peace. When fears are
[7:27] still, when striving
[7:31] cease, my
[7:34] comforter, my all in
[7:38] all. Here in the love of
[7:42] Christ I
[7:45] stand in Christ
[7:49] alone. Who to talk on
[7:53] flesh fullness of God in
[7:56] helpless pain.
[8:00] this gift of
[8:03] love and
[8:07] righteousness, scorned by the ones he
[8:10] came to save.
[8:14] Till on that
[8:17] cross as Jesus
[8:20] died, the wrath of
[8:24] God was
[8:28] satisfied for every
[8:31] sin. On him was
[8:35] laid. Here in the death of Christ I
[8:41] live. And there in the
[8:45] ground his body
[8:48] lay in light of the world by darkness
[8:54] lay. And then bursting
[8:58] forth a glorious
[9:02] day. And up from the grave he
[9:05] rose again.
[9:09] And as he
[9:11] stands in
[9:14] victory. And since curse has
[9:18] lost its grip on
[9:22] me, for I am
[9:25] his and he is
[9:28] [Applause]
[9:29] mine. Bow with the precious blood of
[9:34] Christ.
[9:36] No guilt in
[9:39] life, no fear in
[9:42] death. And this is the power of Christ
[9:47] in
[9:49] me. From life's first
[9:52] Christ to final
[9:56] breath. Jesus commands my destiny.
[10:03] No power of
[10:06] hell, no scheme of
[10:09] man can ever
[10:13] pluck me from his
[10:16] hand till he
[10:20] returns and calls me
[10:24] home. Here in the power of Christ I'll
[10:29] stand.
[10:31] [Music]
[10:36] As brothers make way for the offering,
[10:37] we're going to sing through it
[10:39] [Music]
[10:43] all. I've had many tears and sorrows.
[10:48] I've had questions for
[10:51] tomorrow. There's been times I didn't
[10:54] know right from wrong.
[10:57] [Music]
[10:59] But in every
[11:02] situation, oh God gave me blessed
[11:06] consolation. He only gave me trials to
[11:10] make me strong. It's why we
[11:14] sing and through it
[11:17] all and through it
[11:21] all I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[11:26] I've learned to trust in
[11:29] God. Well, through it
[11:32] all and through it
[11:36] all, I've learned to depend upon his
[11:44] word. And I've been to a lot of places
[11:49] and I've seen a lot of faces.
[11:52] There's been times I felt so all
[11:56] [Music]
[11:58] alone. But in my lonely hour, yes, those
[12:04] precious lonely hours, yes, Jesus let me
[12:08] know I was his own.
[12:13] Oh, and through it
[12:16] all. And through it
[12:20] all, I've learned to trust in
[12:24] Jesus. I've learned to trust in
[12:27] God. And through it
[12:31] all, and through it
[12:34] all, I've learned to depend upon his
[12:39] word.
[12:42] So I thank him for the mountains and I
[12:47] thank him for the valleys and I thank
[12:51] him for the storms he's brought me
[12:56] through. For I've never had a problem I
[13:01] wouldn't know he could solve them. And I
[13:04] knew to know what my faith in God can do
[13:08] is why we sing.
[13:10] understand. And through it
[13:14] all, oh through it
[13:17] all, I've learned to trust in
[13:21] Jesus. I've learned to trust in
[13:24] God. Oh, through it
[13:28] all. And through it
[13:31] all, I've learned to depend upon his
[13:37] word. Amen. He's wonderful. I just can't
[13:40] stop saying
[13:42] [Music]
[13:47] it. So, I have a little housekeeping for
[13:50] the kids and the parents. So, we've been
[13:53] getting um some complaints about um the
[13:55] kids and the parents in the lower room
[13:58] not picking up after themselves. There
[14:00] was like some ice cream left and it was
[14:01] melted all over the table and we just
[14:03] want to be a little bit more
[14:04] conscientious about that. There's a
[14:06] couple sisters that work really hard to
[14:08] keep those rooms clean and we just want
[14:10] to make their lives a little bit easier.
[14:18] [Music]
[14:21] Amen. It's really good to trust in the
[14:26] Lord. It's good to be here this
[14:29] morning. It's good to be here to to
[14:32] worship and adore our Lord Jesus.
[14:37] So, we have a couple prayer requests
[14:39] like to read, but I'm like to read the
[14:41] the praise
[14:44] first. Brother Tim
[14:47] Cruz, he put a praise in. I want to
[14:49] thank the Lord for healing my
[14:52] stomach. I got really bad last week and
[14:54] it hadn't been that painful in a long
[14:58] time.
[14:59] [Music]
[15:02] Last time it got bad, that bad, it took
[15:05] several weeks to heal. This time I'm
[15:07] already back to normal. And I want to
[15:10] thank the Lord for healing mom a few
[15:13] weeks ago. She had double pneumonia and
[15:15] had gotten pretty bad. But thank the
[15:18] Lord, she's better
[15:20] [Music]
[15:21] now. Yes.
[15:25] [Applause]
[15:29] Amen. Brother Ronnie Glidewell uh put a
[15:32] request in. Remember all of our family
[15:35] today. My cousin Owen Horton passed away
[15:39] today at 1:45 a.m. I believe he was 67
[15:42] years old. He had been here in Tucson at
[15:46] a nursing home. Thank you. So let's
[15:48] let's remember the Gladwell family.
[15:52] Pray the Lord will come and comfort
[15:54] their hearts in their
[15:56] [Music]
[15:58] loss. Sister Shirley Moore, I ask please
[16:02] pray for Sister Mercy Srano. Her knee
[16:04] has really been hurting. God bless you.
[16:06] Thank
[16:08] you. And then my brother Chris is asking
[16:11] for prayer concerning health issues.
[16:13] He's trusting God will move on the
[16:15] scene. He doesn't come to the church,
[16:17] but he grew up in the message. uh grew
[16:20] up believing in God and um still trust
[16:23] the Lord for answered prayer. So let's
[16:27] remember that. Let's go before the Lord
[16:29] this
[16:30] morning. Our gracious heavenly father,
[16:32] Lord, it's a privilege to be here this
[16:34] morning to call upon your name. Lord,
[16:37] we've sang songs of your goodness, our
[16:41] faith in you, Lord. And Lord, we may not
[16:44] show it exactly, but Lord, there's
[16:47] something deep inside calling
[16:50] upon that deep call into the deep. Lord,
[16:54] these needs that have
[16:56] been written out. And I know, Lord,
[16:59] there's probably some
[17:01] that are in the hearts of your children.
[17:05] Would you look upon each
[17:07] need? Would you move on the scene, Lord,
[17:10] and just undertake for each request,
[17:14] Lord? And Father, as we would continue
[17:17] this service, we'd ask that you continue
[17:19] to be in the songs and and in the
[17:23] worship. And Lord, would you prepare our
[17:26] hearts and our minds to hear and to
[17:28] receive that which you'd have for us?
[17:30] Bless our pastor, Lord. Move him out of
[17:33] the way. Anoint his lips to bring forth
[17:36] that which you have. And father, as we
[17:39] would take the offering this morning,
[17:41] bless the giver. Would you use the
[17:44] offering for your glory in the
[17:46] furtherance of your work in the precious
[17:48] name of Jesus Christ.
[17:54] [Music]
[18:04] Amen. Take my hand.
[18:09] and lift them
[18:13] up. For I have not the strength to
[18:17] praise you near
[18:21] enough. For I have
[18:25] nothing. Oh, I have
[18:30] nothing without you.
[18:34] [Music]
[18:37] and
[18:38] take my
[18:41] voice and pour it
[18:45] out. Let it sing the songs of mercy I
[18:51] have
[18:52] [Music]
[18:53] found. Oh, I have nothing.
[18:58] Oh, I have
[19:01] nothing without
[19:08] you. And all my
[19:14] soul
[19:16] needs is all your
[19:21] love to cover me.
[19:25] So all the
[19:29] world will
[19:31] see that I have
[19:37] nothing without
[19:43] you.
[19:45] Take my
[19:47] [Music]
[19:48] body and build it up.
[19:53] May it be broken as an offering of
[19:59] love. For I have
[20:03] nothing. Oh, I have

[21:01] me. So all the

[34:21] here with us this
[34:24] morning. Let's get started. Um let's
[34:27] read his word.
[34:29] Colossians chapter
[34:31] 3 verse one. We'll read the first four
[34:34] four
[34:36] [Music]
[34:46] verses. It reads like this.
[34:50] If you if you then be risen with
[34:53] Christ, seek those things which are
[34:56] above, where Christ siteth on the right
[34:59] hand of God, and set your affections on
[35:02] things above, and not on things of the
[35:05] earth. For you are dead, and your life
[35:09] is hid with Christ in God.
[35:13] When Christ who is our life shall
[35:16] appear, then shall you also appear with
[35:19] him in glory. What a promise. What a
[35:23] promise from the Apostle Paul. Let's bow
[35:26] our
[35:26] heads. My
[35:29] father, we thank you for those
[35:31] words. We thank you for worship that we
[35:35] had earlier. Father, how it just we
[35:38] could feel your presence and it feels so
[35:40] good.
[35:42] We ask that you be with us now this
[35:44] morning and guide father my words and
[35:47] may you be glorified in everything that
[35:50] I say and father may you be glorified in
[35:52] the hearts of the
[35:54] audience as
[35:56] they hear as I read the scriptures and
[36:00] and father may it just be beneficial
[36:03] today and our praise may it come up
[36:06] before you as a sweet smiling savior in
[36:09] Jesus Christ's name amen. Amen. Amen.
[36:12] You can be seated. God bless you
[36:22] all. Greetings to our visitors. God
[36:24] bless you all. I
[36:28] um once again, you know, the enemy, he
[36:32] uh he's good at what he does.
[36:35] And this is two times in a row my
[36:38] computer just crashed right when I came
[36:40] to the pulpit and it doesn't it doesn't
[36:42] do
[36:43] this on its own. So I might just have to
[36:47] throw out the technology and just do it
[36:49] the oldfashioned
[36:52] way. There's nothing wrong with that. I
[36:55] I do appreciate technology. I appreciate
[36:57] the um the gifts that God's given us.
[37:00] And I don't want to just put my hand in
[37:02] God's face and say I don't want any of
[37:04] your gifts because many of his gifts are
[37:07] a blessing and I I do appreciate them.
[37:10] First of all, welcome to our visitors.
[37:13] Jonathan and Maddie with Sister Yarro,
[37:15] welcome. God bless you. It's good it's
[37:16] good to see you both. And uh brother
[37:19] from Ohio, right? And your grandson
[37:22] here. God bless you. It's it's good to
[37:24] have you all in service again. Brother
[37:26] Johnny, give us a testimony the other
[37:29] night. Welcome my friend. You uh your
[37:32] testimony was just absolutely precious
[37:33] of how the brother died seven times on
[37:37] on um in the hospital and God had mercy
[37:41] on him and he was given
[37:47] um he wasn't on the wasn't on the list
[37:49] as far as a organ donor. He had liver
[37:52] failure, had kidney failure, and the
[37:54] Lord stepped on the scene in a mighty
[37:56] way
[37:58] and gave him a new kidney, new liver,
[38:03] and now he's with us. He gave us that
[38:05] testimony the other night and and praise
[38:07] praise God for
[38:09] that. Daniel kept saying that. He says,
[38:12] "I'm just happy to be here. I am too. I
[38:16] feel good. I I just I'm so happy
[38:19] whenever I read God's word and
[38:21] especially a scripture like I just read
[38:23] in Colossians chapter 3. What a promise
[38:26] and how how wonderful is God's word.
[38:28] It's just it's tremendous. When brother
[38:31] Tim he wrote the uh brother Tim Cruz
[38:33] wrote the testimony about being the Lord
[38:36] healing his stomach. I had stomach
[38:39] problems my whole life. And it was a
[38:42] service, I don't know, maybe uh 15 15
[38:46] years ago or so. Just a normal Wednesday
[38:49] night service. There was hardly anybody
[38:51] there. And we prayed at the end of
[38:55] service. And uh I had just had really
[38:58] bad stomach problems. I took tomms with
[39:02] me everywhere I went. I would eat them
[39:03] all day. And I I just had really bad um
[39:08] acid reflux to where I felt like I was
[39:10] having a heart attack. It hurt so bad.
[39:13] And a friend of mine, we were sitting in
[39:16] church. He was sitting behind me. A
[39:17] friend of mine laid his hand on me when
[39:19] we
[39:20] prayed and uh afterwards we walked out
[39:23] of service and his name's Steve Klopp is
[39:27] the brother. He said he said, "Brother
[39:29] Dan," he says, "Um," he says, "When I
[39:31] prayed for you, I prayed for your
[39:32] stomach." He said, 'I believe God's
[39:34] going to heal your stomach.
[39:36] And he did that day.
[39:40] And I've never had bad stomach problems
[39:43] since that time. And it was my whole
[39:45] life. And then then that was more than
[39:47] 15 years ago. And to this day, I am
[39:49] completely healed in Jesus name. So,
[39:52] Brother Tim, praise
[39:55] God. He does. He heals. He's a healing
[39:59] God. He's not a God of the past. He is
[40:00] the God of the present. We're going to
[40:03] hear about that in this book of
[40:06] Colossians. It's u I'll give a little
[40:09] review. We went through Colossians 1 and
[40:12] 2. Colossians is a letter written from
[40:14] the Apostle Paul. Our New Testament is
[40:17] organized. We have the first four books
[40:19] in the New Testament are the gospels.
[40:21] Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Those are
[40:25] uh stories of the life of Jesus. And
[40:28] then we have the epistles from Paul.
[40:31] They start with Romans and they go
[40:32] through second Timothy and those are
[40:36] writings from the Apostle Paul and they
[40:38] make up the biggest part of the New
[40:41] Testament. After that we have the Hebrew
[40:44] epistles starts with Hebrews. So you can
[40:47] remember that starts with Hebrews and
[40:49] then that goes through I believe Jude
[40:52] and those were written to a little
[40:54] different audience. They were written
[40:55] more to the Hebrews. Paul's audience was
[40:58] more to the Gentiles. And then the Bible
[41:01] closes with the book of Revelation,
[41:03] which is very similar to maybe an Old
[41:06] Testament book, very prophetic and and
[41:10] powerful. This book of Colossians
[41:13] written by the Apostle Paul, he was in
[41:15] prison when he wrote the letter and he
[41:18] had not never met many of the people
[41:21] that he was writing to. And he was
[41:24] writing them to them to number one
[41:26] encourage them. But he was also writing
[41:29] to warn them about people coming in now
[41:33] that they have become Christians. People
[41:36] coming in and bringing doctrines mainly
[41:40] of legalism and how those doctrines they
[41:44] don't do any good. They they basically
[41:47] begin a worksbased salvation.
[41:51] That was chapters 1 and two. And to
[41:54] really, I believe, get an understanding
[41:57] of this Colossians 3, I think that we
[42:00] need to go back to chapter 2 to lay a
[42:04] foundation of what Paul was writing.
[42:06] This chapter 3 is a very, very powerful
[42:08] chapter and a very corrective chapter to
[42:11] all of us. Chapter 2 was a warning. Be
[42:15] careful of legalism. And then chapter
[42:18] three, he comes in with some correction.
[42:20] So let's go back to chapter 2 and let's
[42:23] start with verse 18.
[42:32] Chapter 2:1 18 says this, "Let no man
[42:34] beguile you of your reward in a
[42:37] voluntary humility and worshiping of
[42:40] angels, intruding into those things
[42:42] which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up
[42:46] by his fleshly mind."
[42:50] So he's he's warning again against
[42:53] legalism. He's telling them to beware
[42:55] when a minister or or a friend or even a
[42:58] pastor comes to you to impose rules.
[43:01] Honoring certain days like maybe the
[43:04] Seventh Day Adventist saying that you're
[43:06] really not a Christian unless you
[43:07] worship unless you meet on Saturday.
[43:11] Kosher eating the different foods that
[43:13] the Jewish um faith has or it could be
[43:18] anything. You fill in the blank in your
[43:20] life. you fill in what someone might
[43:24] present to you as you come to church
[43:27] that is maybe outside of
[43:29] Jesus. You have to follow this rule,
[43:32] that rule, you have to uh adhere to this
[43:35] type of thing. So, he's warning us about
[43:38] that. And what these doctrines do is
[43:40] they really just they create an elitist
[43:42] they create a worksbased salvation.
[43:46] And yeah, this it legalism really puffs
[43:50] up and people have pride in their way of
[43:53] life. They have pride in their way of
[43:55] worship because it makes them better
[43:57] than someone else. And but legalism
[44:01] really it leaves out the most important
[44:06] thing. Verse number 19. And not holding
[44:10] the
[44:11] head from which all the body by joints
[44:16] and bands having nourishment ministered
[44:19] and knit together increasing with the
[44:23] increase of God. The English Standard
[44:26] Version says, "And not holding fast to
[44:28] the head, from which the whole body
[44:31] nourished and knit together through its
[44:34] joints and ligamentous ligaments grows
[44:37] with a growth that is from God." So he's
[44:40] saying, and you bring in these
[44:41] doctrines, you bring in these rules to
[44:43] the in the church, they they stop the
[44:46] growth,
[44:48] and they stop, and you'll watch, they
[44:49] stop the baptisms, they stop the
[44:51] healings, they stop the miracles, things
[44:54] stop when you bring those things, when
[44:56] you introduce those things into a church
[44:58] or a denomination or a movement.
[45:03] Wherefore if you be dead with Christ
[45:07] from the rudiments of the world, why as
[45:11] though living in the world are you
[45:14] subject to
[45:16] ordinances? New Living Translation says,
[45:18] "You have died with Christ and he set
[45:20] you free from the spiritual powers of
[45:22] this world. So why do you keep on
[45:24] following the rules of the world?"
[45:26] And it's amazing to me when I read that
[45:30] that Paul is taking religious
[45:32] rules that were that he was warning or
[45:36] they were already there of of people
[45:38] trying to implement those things and he
[45:41] is saying that they are of the world.
[45:46] So he's saying that hey these are these
[45:48] things that people are trying to tell
[45:49] you to do follow this rule and that rule
[45:51] they're
[45:53] worldly. And then he gives an example.
[45:56] He's saying they say touch not, taste
[45:57] not, handle not, which all are to perish
[46:01] with the using after the commandments
[46:04] and doctrines of
[46:07] men. Which things have indeed a show of
[46:11] wisdom in will worship and humility and
[46:14] neglecting of the body, not in any honor
[46:18] to the satisfying of the flesh. New
[46:21] living translation is says this
[46:23] beautifully. These rules may seem wise
[46:26] because they require strong devotion,
[46:29] pious
[46:31] self-denial, and severe bodily
[46:33] discipline, but they provide no help in
[46:37] conquering a person's evil
[46:40] desires. So, you may adhere to the
[46:42] rules, you may walk the walk, you may
[46:44] talk the talk, but it doesn't do any
[46:46] good in taking that desire, that
[46:48] fleshly, sinful desire that's inside of
[46:50] you, doesn't do any good in taking that
[46:51] away. it just pretty much just covers
[46:54] it. There's certain faiths require
[46:58] certain things that that many times are
[47:00] are very difficult to do. I was in I had
[47:04] a um meeting in
[47:06] Toronto a number of years ago and I went
[47:10] one afternoon I went down to I wanted to
[47:12] see Niagara Falls. So I I drove down
[47:16] there with a colleague and there was I
[47:21] bet you 50 or more hidic Jews. You know
[47:26] the ones that they wear the black
[47:27] clothes and they have the hat and they
[47:29] have the curls that the men have the
[47:30] curls that come down and the women uh
[47:33] have have a certain dress. And I I saw
[47:36] these men and I even told Stephanie when
[47:38] I got home, I greatly admired these
[47:42] Jewish men. I liked their discipline. I
[47:47] thought it was it was it was the coolest
[47:49] thing. I liked the way that they had
[47:51] they had their hair. You know, you can
[47:53] go back to the Bible and and the locks
[47:55] and you you see Samson and his Nazerite
[47:57] vow. I I just I liked their their
[48:02] dedication and their difference from the
[48:05] norm. It impressed
[48:07] me. But that walk that they had and that
[48:12] difference that they they were from the
[48:14] world that was their by their own
[48:17] choosing and according to this scripture
[48:20] from Paul, it really didn't doesn't
[48:22] please God. That's your choice. the uh
[48:26] the
[48:27] Amish they started the faith started
[48:30] around
[48:32] 1700 so so hundreds of years ago and
[48:35] they tried to continue with the same way
[48:38] of life that they did 300 years ago they
[48:41] tried to continue with the same clothing
[48:43] the same haircuts the same horsedrawn
[48:46] carriages and they they were trying to
[48:49] live they are today trying to live in a
[48:51] day that's gone
[48:53] by And I I had a friend that was the
[48:58] pastor of a Amish community. And he used
[49:01] to tell me that Amish is not a religion.
[49:04] It's a
[49:05] lifestyle. And it is a more disciplined
[49:09] lifestyle say than we live. But I don't
[49:12] believe it's more holy. I know the Amish
[49:15] people. I knew this man and he would he
[49:17] was a pastor. He would tell me all the
[49:19] problems. It really isn't more holy to
[49:21] try to live 300 years ago than it is to
[49:25] try to live in
[49:27] 2025. It it's that's that is these Amish
[49:31] people and they are doing that by their
[49:34] own choice and they are really not doing
[49:37] it for God. They're doing it to keep
[49:38] their traditions.
[49:41] There's a a practice in some uh sects of
[49:46] Catholic Catholicism and others that is
[49:50] called self flagagillation.
[49:53] And what it is is, and I'm sure you've
[49:56] seen it maybe on videos, but they'll
[50:00] walk down a street and they'll either be
[50:03] carrying a cross or um just maybe just
[50:07] walking and they'll take whips and
[50:09] they'll beat themselves bloody and
[50:12] they'll be walking down the street and
[50:14] they'll be beating themselves with
[50:16] chains or whips and they'll be bleeding.
[50:19] And they're doing this to try to
[50:23] represent the suffering of Jesus Christ.
[50:26] They and they take that as God's
[50:28] suffering as Jesus's suffering. But that
[50:31] is not what God requires to us to do
[50:33] that. They even go to a verse in the
[50:36] Bible that says that that uh that that
[50:41] that we will take on the suffering of
[50:43] Christ and they interpret that as
[50:46] beating themselves up. Back to that New
[50:49] Living Translation verse, he says, "You
[50:50] have died with Christ and he has set you
[50:52] free from the spiritual powers of this
[50:54] world. So why do you keep on following
[50:56] the rules of the
[50:58] world?" He says, "These these things are
[51:02] worldly. The rules in verse 23, the
[51:05] rules may seem wise because they're
[51:07] requiring a strong devotion, pious
[51:09] self-denial, and severe bodily discip
[51:11] discipline, but they provide no help in
[51:14] conquering a person's desires. Do you
[51:16] think walking down the road and beating
[51:19] yourself bloody that that may be an
[51:21] outward expression, but does that take
[51:23] away that desire for you to to sin? No,
[51:27] it doesn't. That's what you are doing
[51:30] for yourself, what these people are
[51:31] doing. They make that choice. And maybe
[51:33] when they go before God one day, they
[51:36] might say, "I beat myself. I cut myself.
[51:39] I I did all of these things." And the
[51:42] Lord may say that, "No, you did that for
[51:45] you.
[51:47] You did that for your own
[51:49] gratification. You I did not require
[51:51] that. That was what you did. And whether
[51:55] it be following certain rules,
[51:58] abstaining from meats or or a certain
[52:01] dress or whatever it might be, those
[52:04] rules are are devised. As Paul said,
[52:07] they are man's rules
[52:10] and therefore they are worldly.
[52:14] Now we get to chapter three. Paul lays
[52:18] that
[52:19] foundation. But as I said before last
[52:22] week, I said Paul was a
[52:26] legalist until he met the Lord Jesus.
[52:30] And then that became real to him. Did he
[52:36] start living more sinful? Oh no. He
[52:38] started living more holy.
[52:42] Chapter three.
[52:44] in Colossians. If you then be risen with
[52:48] Christ, seek those things which are
[52:53] above, where Christ siteth on the right
[52:57] hand of God. Seek that and set your
[53:00] affection on things above and not things
[53:04] on the earth. Brother Brandham gave a
[53:06] beautiful uh illustration of this. He
[53:09] talked about a pig and he says, "You can
[53:12] take this pig and I I've been We've all
[53:15] seen pigs and they're the nastiest
[53:17] things. I don't know what they taste
[53:19] really
[53:20] good. Bacon. I love bacon." And if
[53:23] there's any Jewish people here, I just
[53:26] read it's okay to eat bacon. Paul said
[53:28] so. The apostle said pork chops are
[53:31] fine, but they're a dirty animal.
[53:36] And you he said that you can take a pig
[53:40] and you can scrub it down and put some
[53:42] soap on it and clean it and spray it
[53:44] off. And he says and then dry it off and
[53:46] and put some perfume on it. Smells
[53:47] really good. And take his little his
[53:49] little nails and and you know give him a
[53:52] a a pedicure and paint the little nails
[53:55] and make him look like just just this
[53:57] beautiful pig. And the first thing he's
[54:00] going to do when you let him go is jump
[54:02] right back into the stinky mud and roll
[54:05] around. And what you do on the outside
[54:09] does not
[54:11] necessarily reflect what is on the
[54:13] inside of that pig. You got it all
[54:15] cleaned up, but it's still a pig. And
[54:19] Paul is saying here, you got to change
[54:21] the whole nature. You got to go to the
[54:23] root of these things.
[54:26] Set your affections on things above and
[54:28] not on things on the earth. For you are
[54:32] dead and your life is hid with Christ in
[54:36] God. Verse number three, you have to die
[54:40] to yourself. That that pig nature
[54:44] dies and there's no more running back to
[54:48] that slop and it's replaced with the
[54:51] spirit and the life of Christ.
[54:57] For you are
[54:58] dead and your life is hid with Christ in
[55:04] God. When when Christ who is our
[55:09] life, I love that part. Just let that
[55:12] just sink
[55:14] in. When Christ who is our life shall
[55:18] appear, then shall you also appear with
[55:22] him in glory. He's making a promise
[55:24] here.
[55:25] When our lives when our lives die and
[55:28] they were replaced with with Christ's
[55:31] life, with Christ's spirit, then that
[55:33] promise of eternal life and the
[55:35] resurrection and the wedding supper when
[55:38] we are around the table with the saints
[55:40] and eating and and and Jesus will come
[55:43] and he'll wipe those tears away. That
[55:45] becomes that becomes manifest. That
[55:48] becomes real. Now we have a promise when
[55:50] we die. When I die to Daniel Evans and
[55:53] this sinful man is gone and
[55:56] dead and I replace that with this spirit
[55:59] of Jesus Christ, then we have that
[56:02] promise that we will also appear with
[56:05] him in glory. Mortify your members which
[56:10] are upon the earth. Now remember I said
[56:14] he's not a legalist. He's not. But he
[56:17] believes in living a holy life.
[56:21] Legalism and living a good life have
[56:23] nothing to do with each other.
[56:26] Mortify therefore your members which are
[56:29] upon the earth
[56:32] fornication,
[56:34] uncleanness, inordinate effect
[56:37] affection, evil
[56:39] concupisence and covetous which is
[56:45] idolatry. NIV of that same verse, that
[56:49] same
[56:51] um verse says this, "Put to death
[56:54] therefore whatever belongs to your
[56:56] earthly nature, sexual immorality,
[56:59] impurity, lust, evil desires, and greed,
[57:03] which is
[57:04] idolatry. So getting rid of sin isn't
[57:08] legalism. Living a holy life isn't
[57:10] legalism. Keeping yourself pure sexually
[57:13] is not legalism. Dressing like a
[57:15] Christian and not presenting yourself to
[57:17] someone who is maybe desiring sexual
[57:21] immorality is not legalism. It's
[57:24] Christian living.
[57:26] What reason is Paul saying these things?
[57:29] Because he changed. He himself changed
[57:31] from his legal ways. And we get caught
[57:34] up. We get caught up with it's what kind
[57:37] of garment you wear or you can't wear
[57:39] these kind of shoes or you have to wear
[57:41] th this certain long pants or short or
[57:44] or you have to wear a dress or whatever.
[57:46] The spirit of the New Testament is to
[57:48] get rid of those rules.
[57:51] But replace the rules with the spirit of
[57:54] Christ. That is what it is. And the
[57:57] spirit of Christ will show you that sin
[58:00] causes damage in your life. If you
[58:03] present yourself in a way that invites
[58:06] immorality, then you'll end up being
[58:09] immoral. And that's the kind of mate. If
[58:12] you're presenting yourself as an immoral
[58:15] person, then that's the kind of mate
[58:16] that you're going to attract. Whether
[58:19] you're a boy or a girl and a man man if
[58:22] you present yourself in an immoral way
[58:25] that's the kind of girl that you're
[58:27] going to attract. Same thing with the
[58:29] girls. If you present yourself in an
[58:31] immoral way that's the kind of boy that
[58:34] you're going to attract. With the boys
[58:37] with the with the men it's dirty dirty
[58:39] language. It could be your haircut. It
[58:41] could be your appearance. If it looks
[58:42] like the world then you are inviting
[58:45] immorality.
[58:48] The first one he says, I want to go
[58:49] through some of these these things that
[58:51] he
[58:52] says. He says
[58:55] uncleanness. The NIV, ESV, and NLT all
[58:58] say impurity. If you could just Yeah,
[59:01] just leave those scriptures up right
[59:04] there.
[59:06] Impurity. And it's like a
[59:10] contaminant in our water. If I want to
[59:14] if I want to
[59:15] drink and this water has a bacteria
[59:19] called jardia in it and I drink it, it's
[59:22] going to make me sick. If it has too
[59:24] much of a heavy heavy metal like maybe
[59:26] mercury or selenium or something like
[59:28] that and I drink I drink it, it could
[59:31] cause cancer in me. That is an impurity
[59:34] that's in the in the water. And Paul is
[59:37] saying here that this impurity that
[59:40] comes in you, it'll cause problems in
[59:42] your life.
[59:46] Inordinate affection. The New King James
[59:49] and the ESV say
[59:52] passion. NIV and the NLT say
[59:55] lust. This isn't the act itself.
[1:00:00] The
[1:00:01] definition of lust is the intense desire
[1:00:05] for something. It's not necessarily
[1:00:07] sexual. It could be the love of money.
[1:00:09] It could be the lust of
[1:00:11] attention. And these things once we Paul
[1:00:14] says you got to get rid of that. It'll
[1:00:17] cause it'll cause immorality. It'll
[1:00:19] cause you problems. The next one he says
[1:00:22] evil concupisence. I know you know what
[1:00:24] that means.
[1:00:30] is the King
[1:00:31] James. It means the NIV, the ESV, NLT,
[1:00:35] and New King James. All of the the um
[1:00:38] other translations I could find say one
[1:00:40] thing. It's evil
[1:00:43] desires. Similar to lust, you have to
[1:00:46] have something that's immoral. So even
[1:00:49] though you may not be actually
[1:00:51] committing that sin again, you are still
[1:00:55] sinning inwardly because you still have
[1:00:58] those desires. As I said, those people
[1:01:00] that beat themselves, the people that
[1:01:02] make such great sacrifices, those those
[1:01:04] Jewish men with their with their locks
[1:01:06] hanging down and their hats and the way
[1:01:08] that they looked, that did that was the
[1:01:10] outside. That didn't change the inside.
[1:01:12] That did nothing for the inside.
[1:01:15] Paul is saying here the inside needs to
[1:01:18] change
[1:01:19] and covetous which is
[1:01:23] idolatry. Another translation said
[1:01:26] greed which is
[1:01:28] idolatry. He says get rid of these
[1:01:31] things. David and Basheba he's a good
[1:01:34] example.
[1:01:36] David sees this woman on the
[1:01:41] housetop and the desire came. He wanted
[1:01:45] something someone else
[1:01:48] possessed. He
[1:01:50] coveted that woman. Then he desired it.
[1:01:53] He began to entertain the evil desire of
[1:01:56] adultery and it became lust. And then
[1:01:59] lust manifested itself into an impure
[1:02:02] act. Exactly. Right through the line of
[1:02:04] what Paul's saying here. And then then
[1:02:06] that impure act was sexual
[1:02:10] immorality. And it began really with
[1:02:13] greed that he wanted something someone
[1:02:16] else had. Listen to
[1:02:18] this. 2 Samuel 12 verse one. I'll read
[1:02:23] the New King James Version and we can
[1:02:25] put the um the King James up there. Then
[1:02:28] the Lord sent Nathan to David. This is
[1:02:32] after that he had had that affair.
[1:02:36] King David with Basheba. And he came to
[1:02:39] him, the prophet came to him and said to
[1:02:41] him, "There were two men in one city,
[1:02:43] one rich and the other poor. The rich
[1:02:46] man had exceeding many flocks and herd
[1:02:49] herds, but the poor man had nothing
[1:02:51] except one little u lamb which he had
[1:02:53] bought and nourished, and it grew up
[1:02:55] with them and with his children. It ate
[1:02:58] of his own food and drank of from his
[1:03:00] own cup and laid in his bosom." This
[1:03:03] poor man loved this little lamb and laid
[1:03:06] it in his own bosom and it was like a
[1:03:09] daughter to him. And a traveler came in
[1:03:13] and a traveler came to the rich man who
[1:03:16] refused to take from his own flock and
[1:03:19] to give from his own herd to prepare one
[1:03:22] one for the wayfairing man. So this
[1:03:23] guest came in and this rich man has all
[1:03:26] of these sheep and all all of these
[1:03:28] lambs and everything and he doesn't want
[1:03:31] to give up one of
[1:03:34] his. So he took the poor man's
[1:03:37] lamb and prepared it for the man who had
[1:03:40] come to him. Prophet tells David
[1:03:43] this.
[1:03:45] David, he is
[1:03:47] upset. So David's anger was greatly
[1:03:49] aroused against the man and he said to
[1:03:52] Nathan, "As the Lord lives, the man who
[1:03:54] has done this shall surely die." The
[1:03:58] righteous indign indignation in David
[1:04:00] rose up. I'm going to get that guy for
[1:04:03] stealing that poor man's
[1:04:07] lamb, and he shall restore fourfold the
[1:04:11] lamb because he did this thing and
[1:04:13] because he had no pity. Nathan said to
[1:04:16] David, "You are the
[1:04:19] man. Thus says the Lord God of Israel, I
[1:04:22] anointed you king over Israel, and I
[1:04:24] delivered you from the hand of Saul."
[1:04:27] And then you went and did
[1:04:30] this. Then David was put in that spot,
[1:04:34] but David
[1:04:35] repented. Back to Colossians 3 verse 5.
[1:04:40] Mortify therefore your
[1:04:42] members which are upon the earth
[1:04:45] fornication, uncleanness, inordinate
[1:04:48] affection, evil concupisence, evil
[1:04:51] desires and covetousness which is
[1:04:54] idolatry for which things say sake the
[1:04:58] wrath of God comes on the children of
[1:05:01] disobedience. So the wrath of God comes
[1:05:03] upon those who are disobedient to his
[1:05:06] word and commit these sins. You say,
[1:05:09] "But pastor, you're saying that David
[1:05:12] has to suffer that because his life
[1:05:14] lined up perfectly with what Paul said,
[1:05:17] that this is coming down, that this
[1:05:18] wrath of God is coming down on that
[1:05:22] disobedience." And he says
[1:05:25] this, "In the you walk, you also walked
[1:05:31] sometime when you lived in them." So
[1:05:34] he's saying, "Yeah, all of you
[1:05:38] You've also sinned like this. And I am
[1:05:41] saying just like David sinned. There was
[1:05:44] forgiveness for
[1:05:46] David. But
[1:05:48] now ye also put off these all of
[1:05:53] these anger now and wrath. So he's
[1:05:57] saying that you lived in those now
[1:05:58] you've repented. Now he said now put off
[1:06:00] all this also. Put off anger and wrath
[1:06:03] and malice and blasphemy, filthy
[1:06:05] communication out of your mouth. So
[1:06:07] before before Paul mentions immoral
[1:06:09] living and now he adds these things
[1:06:11] anger watch your
[1:06:15] temper really how can someone any of us
[1:06:19] lose our temper and really be Christians
[1:06:23] and I know we're many of us have a
[1:06:26] spouse and we love each other but that
[1:06:30] counts for our wives and our husbands
[1:06:32] too. How can we lose our temper on each
[1:06:35] others or our brothers and
[1:06:37] sisters and still be a
[1:06:42] Christian,
[1:06:45] anger, wrath,
[1:06:49] rage, malice. What is malice? It's the
[1:06:52] desire to cause pain, injury, or
[1:06:56] distress. Malice, it's the
[1:06:58] desire. You want something bad to happen
[1:07:01] to
[1:07:03] someone. How many of us don't raise your
[1:07:05] hands? How many of us are guil How many
[1:07:07] of us are guilty of
[1:07:08] that? I talked to a guy
[1:07:13] yesterday who is a very
[1:07:16] hated
[1:07:18] person, very hated man because he has
[1:07:21] done he has done things that we would
[1:07:23] consider very very wrong. And I remember
[1:07:26] talking to people and people saying,
[1:07:28] "Well, you watch what happens to him.
[1:07:31] He'll probably commit suicide or his his
[1:07:34] wife will probably leave him or he'll
[1:07:36] probably fall into sin into into
[1:07:39] homosexuality or or something like
[1:07:40] that." I remember because of this man
[1:07:44] what he had done those sins. I remember
[1:07:47] Christian people telling me those
[1:07:50] things. That is malice. I don't care how
[1:07:55] bad that person is. I mean, even Michael
[1:08:00] the Archangel was there with Satan
[1:08:02] himself and he didn't bring a railing
[1:08:04] accusation against him. That is malice.
[1:08:08] And even if it's the president of the
[1:08:12] United States or the former president,
[1:08:15] whatever it might be, we need to always
[1:08:18] watch our tongue.
[1:08:20] Be careful with that malice.
[1:08:23] Blasphemy. Blasphemy is
[1:08:25] slander. It's making a false state
[1:08:28] statement that damage damages someone
[1:08:30] reputation is what the dictionary says.
[1:08:33] If you pass on a lie, you're guilty of
[1:08:36] that lie. This goes for each other all
[1:08:41] the way down to talking about the
[1:08:44] president. You see a video on YouTube.
[1:08:47] Oh, did you see this video?
[1:08:50] the president's an alien. Whatever it
[1:08:53] is, did you see
[1:08:55] this? Passing those things on,
[1:08:59] blasphemy,
[1:09:02] filthy
[1:09:04] communication. To me, this is really
[1:09:08] what separates a Christian from a
[1:09:09] non-Christian more than anything else
[1:09:11] that I know of.
[1:09:13] To me, when I talk to
[1:09:16] someone, their language is what gives
[1:09:19] them
[1:09:21] away more than anything else. Is this
[1:09:24] person cussing? Is this person talking
[1:09:25] about immoral things, dirty things, or
[1:09:27] is this person talking about the Lord
[1:09:29] and glorifying the
[1:09:30] Lord? Filthy communication, dirty
[1:09:35] language. King James says, "Put off
[1:09:38] these things." NIV says, "Get he
[1:09:42] says,"Rid yourself of these
[1:09:45] things. Get rid of these things that are
[1:09:48] in your
[1:09:49] life." Jesus tells a
[1:09:52] parable. Matthew 12 verse 43 of getting
[1:09:57] your life cleaned up says this, "When an
[1:10:01] unclean spirit Matthew 12:43, thank you.
[1:10:04] When an unclean I'm going to read the
[1:10:05] New King James uh version. When an
[1:10:09] unclean spirit goes out of a man, he
[1:10:11] goes through dry places seeking rest and
[1:10:14] finding none. Then he says, "I will
[1:10:17] return to my house from which I came.
[1:10:20] And when he comes, he finds it empty and
[1:10:23] swept and put in order." Then he goes
[1:10:27] and takes with him seven other spirits
[1:10:30] more wicked than himself, and they enter
[1:10:32] and dwell there. And the last state of
[1:10:35] that man is worse than the
[1:10:38] first. So shall it also be with this
[1:10:43] wicked generation. What does that what
[1:10:45] does that mean? What is that
[1:10:48] parable? What does it what does it
[1:10:50] represent?
[1:10:52] I um I put
[1:10:54] together some uh a prop here. Daniel,
[1:10:57] could you um move that thing? You know
[1:10:59] what? Let's uh I I want I really like
[1:11:01] the young people to see this. Can Can we
[1:11:04] get the youth Can uh can the kids come
[1:11:06] up here and let's sit in these first
[1:11:08] these first two rows? Abby, you start.
[1:11:11] Come on. Then everybody else follow you.
[1:11:14] And all the newer kids and and uh Ki
[1:11:17] Fuji, come up here and and sit up here.
[1:11:21] Nah. Back there. Yeah. Come on. Come on
[1:11:24] up. I want I want you all to see this
[1:11:26] and I want everybody to see it because I
[1:11:27] think it's a good lesson.
[1:11:32] Um I
[1:11:35] was
[1:11:37] meditating
[1:11:39] on that.
[1:11:42] Yeah, there's there's plenty of room
[1:11:43] here, too. I was meditating on that
[1:11:45] scripture
[1:11:49] and I was
[1:11:51] thinking these sins they come into our
[1:11:54] lives and and let's say this cup
[1:11:57] here let's say this is us this is our
[1:12:01] life and the sins they enter
[1:12:05] in to our life like this and I'll take
[1:12:09] these marshmallows and and represent
[1:12:11] it it's a good representative of
[1:12:15] gluttony. So we we take this in and he
[1:12:18] says get rid of malice and rage. Put
[1:12:22] some rage in there. And then get rid of
[1:12:27] gossip right here. And you know what?
[1:12:31] Cussing. Watch that one. Put put that
[1:12:33] one in there. And okay, I got it there.
[1:12:37] And I got all this stuff and I want to
[1:12:40] clean myself up. All right. And I'm I'm
[1:12:44] struggling with these with these things
[1:12:45] right here. So I look at it and I say, I
[1:12:48] got all this sin in my life. I I gotta I
[1:12:50] gotta change. So I take it and it's
[1:12:52] like, you know what? I'm going to get
[1:12:53] rid of this and I'm going to get rid of
[1:12:54] this and and I got I'm I'm clean now.
[1:12:58] I'm not doing those things anymore. And
[1:12:59] you know what? I'm going to wipe it down
[1:13:01] right here. And here is
[1:13:04] me. I am clean. And you put it
[1:13:09] back and you sit there for a while.
[1:13:12] And the problem is that when you remove
[1:13:16] something, it creates a
[1:13:19] void. There's space in there. And that
[1:13:23] space needs to be filled up. So now it's
[1:13:26] like, okay, well, you know, I've been
[1:13:28] living good. And and you know, the anger
[1:13:31] came back a little bit. And then I
[1:13:34] cussed the other day and um and yeah, I
[1:13:38] gossiped about about uh about my friend
[1:13:41] at work or at school. And then and then
[1:13:45] uh man, I got really mad. Got mad at my
[1:13:48] spouse. I got mad at my husband right
[1:13:50] there. And and all of a
[1:13:52] sudden, it's all
[1:13:54] back. You have given your heart to the
[1:13:56] Lord. You have changed. But now, you
[1:13:59] know what? Now that I'm I'm I'm sinning,
[1:14:02] you know, I got some more lies and I got
[1:14:05] greed now. And let me pick up that
[1:14:08] greed. Put it back in the in there. And
[1:14:12] and now you know what? Now, now it's
[1:14:14] lust. Put some lust in
[1:14:17] there. Sexual immorality, maybe. And
[1:14:20] here it is.
[1:14:23] Now the state of that
[1:14:25] man is much worse than the original
[1:14:30] state. Before it was just to hear, but I
[1:14:33] changed. I went to the altar. I got
[1:14:34] baptized. I got it all cleaned out and
[1:14:37] washed out. But now it's filled up with
[1:14:40] more stuff than it was before. How many
[1:14:43] have been in that position where I
[1:14:47] changed my life and I was doing really
[1:14:49] good and then I just started to
[1:14:51] backslide. started to slip a little bit
[1:14:53] and all of a sudden, wow, I am worse
[1:14:55] than I was before I got baptized. I'm
[1:14:57] worse before I made this this change in
[1:14:59] my
[1:14:59] life. The best way to get rid of these
[1:15:05] things is you take the Holy Spirit and
[1:15:08] let's represent this water. This water
[1:15:10] is the Holy Spirit. And you know what?
[1:15:12] It's got to fill that
[1:15:15] void. And you dump it in there. Uhoh.
[1:15:21] Look at this. I don't even have to do
[1:15:24] anything. I'm pouring up, pouring my
[1:15:26] life out right there. And everything
[1:15:29] just kind of goes
[1:15:32] away more,
[1:15:36] more and it takes up that void and
[1:15:40] pretty soon all of those things. It's
[1:15:43] not from beating myself. It's not from
[1:15:46] following rules. It's taking the Holy
[1:15:51] Spirit and filling that cup up.
[1:15:56] And
[1:15:57] before the man got himself cleaned out,
[1:16:01] but there was nothing in the cup.
[1:16:04] Quit looking at the sin. Quit focusing
[1:16:07] at what you do wrong. Quit focusing on,
[1:16:10] man, I I lost my temper on my wife. I I
[1:16:12] lied over here. I cheated on my test. I
[1:16:14] I did I did this over over here. quit
[1:16:17] focusing on your sin and focus on the
[1:16:20] Holy Spirit and focus on seeking that.
[1:16:24] And then look at all the sin. It just
[1:16:26] kind of goes out. It just kind of
[1:16:27] bubbles out and you don't even have to
[1:16:28] focus on that anymore. And now you can't
[1:16:32] get anything back in there because it's
[1:16:35] full and it's filled with the spirit of
[1:16:39] God. You know, you you put some stuff
[1:16:42] back in there. You know what? It's
[1:16:43] really easy to get rid of it.
[1:16:46] But then it's like, well, you know, it's
[1:16:48] starting to get down. Put some more in
[1:16:50] there. Keep that cup full.
[1:16:55] Understood, Daniel. I'm going to leave
[1:16:56] this to you,
[1:16:58] bub. It's great to have a
[1:17:04] son. And more you go to church, the more
[1:17:07] water bottles you get. No, I'm just
[1:17:10] kidding. That's a legalist aside. Um but
[1:17:14] but do you see the glass is full now and
[1:17:19] before it was
[1:17:21] empty and he says this he says lie
[1:17:25] not one to another. Verse number nine
[1:17:29] seeing that you have put off the old man
[1:17:32] with his deeds. So you've gotten rid of
[1:17:35] all the marshmallows out of the cup.
[1:17:36] They're all gone. And he said now now
[1:17:38] let's let's keep living right. Let's
[1:17:40] keep um serving God and let's not lie.
[1:17:43] Let's not let let's let's just continue
[1:17:46] to fill that cup up. Go to church, read
[1:17:49] your Bible, listen to sermons, keep that
[1:17:53] cup full. When there's a void there,
[1:17:55] when you get rid of the sin, make
[1:17:57] productive changes in your life. It
[1:18:00] might not just be reading your Bible. It
[1:18:03] not might not be going to church. It
[1:18:05] might be
[1:18:06] exercising. It might be helping someone
[1:18:08] else.
[1:18:10] It might be calling up a friend and
[1:18:11] going for a hike or meeting somebody
[1:18:13] that that just could use a touch. Meet
[1:18:15] meet for coffee. The men's the men's
[1:18:17] group met for coffee the other day. It
[1:18:20] might be working an extra shift. It
[1:18:22] might be spending more time studying for
[1:18:23] school. It might be moving forward with
[1:18:25] a career. But fill that void that was
[1:18:28] once full of sin that was maybe
[1:18:32] swiping, wasting your time. And fill it
[1:18:35] with something productive.
[1:18:38] Fill that cup with God's work and not
[1:18:44] with the work of man.
[1:18:46] And have put on the new
[1:18:50] man which is renewed in knowledge after
[1:18:53] the image of him that created him. What
[1:18:56] is that new man? It's a it's a changed
[1:18:59] man from the old sinful person to a new
[1:19:02] creation in God that acts like Jesus
[1:19:04] that represents himself like Jesus.
[1:19:07] Brother Bram tells a story about the
[1:19:09] slave that uh the the the visitor came
[1:19:12] and he saw that there was
[1:19:14] this one slave that was different than
[1:19:17] all the other
[1:19:18] slaves. This slave he he conducted
[1:19:23] himself in a different way. So this man
[1:19:26] asks, he says, "Why is this slave any
[1:19:30] different? Is he the boss?" And he's
[1:19:31] like, "No." He says, "Does he does he um
[1:19:35] do is does he eat different or does does
[1:19:38] he have something different about him?"
[1:19:39] The man says, "No." Brother Bram tells
[1:19:41] the story that says that no,
[1:19:44] back in Africa before he was stolen and
[1:19:47] put into slavery, his father was a king
[1:19:51] and he conducts himself as the son of a
[1:19:54] king. And that's how a Christian we
[1:19:58] conduct
[1:19:59] ourselves as the son a son of God
[1:20:05] representing Jesus Christ.
[1:20:11] I'll uh musicians can come can come. I
[1:20:14] don't I don't want to uh get into the
[1:20:16] other um the rest of the chapter. But in
[1:20:20] verse number
[1:20:21] 17 it says this. And whatsoever you do
[1:20:26] in word or deed, do all in the name of
[1:20:30] the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and
[1:20:33] the Father by him. So instead of rules
[1:20:37] about clothing or about food or about
[1:20:39] drink or about sports or about school,
[1:20:42] whatever you do inside or
[1:20:45] outside, you do in the name of Jesus
[1:20:47] Christ. Amen. So you ask yourself,
[1:20:50] there's a very very easy way to make a
[1:20:52] decision. You ask yourself, can I go to
[1:20:55] that party in the name of Jesus
[1:20:57] Christ? Can I speak about that man at
[1:21:00] work in the name of Jesus Christ? Can I
[1:21:02] complain about the guy in traffic in the
[1:21:05] name of Jesus Christ? Can you hate
[1:21:07] someone in the name of Jesus Christ?
[1:21:11] Can you pass on information about
[1:21:13] someone in the name of Jesus
[1:21:16] Christ? Can you look at a woman in the
[1:21:19] name of Jesus Christ?
[1:21:22] Can you write a Facebook post in the
[1:21:24] name of Jesus
[1:21:25] Christ? Can you post an in Instagram
[1:21:28] picture in the name of Jesus
[1:21:30] Christ? Can you do can you make
[1:21:33] decisions when you do something? Are you
[1:21:36] doing this in the name of Jesus Christ?
[1:21:38] What does that mean? That means that you
[1:21:42] are representing Jesus Christ. If I send
[1:21:45] brother Aaron to go to Phoenix on behalf
[1:21:49] of the Tucson
[1:21:51] Tabernacle, Brother Aaron is not going
[1:21:53] in his own
[1:21:54] name. Brother Aaron is representing
[1:21:57] me as the authority in this church. And
[1:22:01] whatever brother Aaron says goes because
[1:22:04] he is
[1:22:05] representing a
[1:22:07] church. He is the official
[1:22:09] representative. And when we pray in the
[1:22:11] name of Jesus Christ or whatever we do,
[1:22:14] that's why Paul is saying whatever you
[1:22:15] do, do all in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:22:19] because you are representing him. Can
[1:22:22] you sin in the name of Jesus Christ? Can
[1:22:24] you help someone in the name of Jesus
[1:22:25] Christ? Can you go to school in the name
[1:22:26] of Jesus Christ? Always make these
[1:22:29] decisions through the name of Jesus. Can
[1:22:32] I do this Lord in the name of Jesus
[1:22:35] Christ?
[1:22:38] If you truly pray in Jesus' name, then
[1:22:41] the Bible says demons will be subject to
[1:22:44] you. Sickness will be subject to you.
[1:22:48] Thank you, Lord. If you pray in the name
[1:22:50] of Jesus Christ, then ask what you will
[1:22:53] and it will be given to you according to
[1:22:55] the words of Jesus in the Gospel of
[1:22:58] John.
[1:22:59] He says, "Ask anything in my name and I
[1:23:02] will do it." That's how important that
[1:23:05] name is. So when you truly
[1:23:09] pray, whatever you do, whatever you do
[1:23:12] in word or deed, whatever you say and
[1:23:15] whatever you do, do it in the name of
[1:23:18] Jesus Christ because you are
[1:23:20] representing him. And Paul here is
[1:23:22] saying
[1:23:23] everything when you're
[1:23:26] alone in your private
[1:23:30] time, are you representing Jesus Christ?
[1:23:34] When you're at
[1:23:35] church, are you here in the name of
[1:23:37] Jesus
[1:23:38] Christ? When you're talking to each
[1:23:42] other, are you talking in the name of
[1:23:44] Jesus
[1:23:45] Christ? Paul says,
[1:23:48] "Everything you do, do it in that
[1:23:52] name." And then you lay hands on the
[1:23:56] sick and they shall recover.
[1:23:58] And then you bring your loved one before
[1:24:01] the Lord and they will be delivered
[1:24:04] because you are coming in the almighty
[1:24:06] name of Jesus
[1:24:09] Christ. Paul gives us Jesus gave it to
[1:24:13] us first and now Paul is reiterating it.
[1:24:18] He's
[1:24:20] saying that whatever you do in word or
[1:24:23] [Music]
[1:24:24] deed, can you imagine if we really live
[1:24:27] that way? I want to live that way. Can
[1:24:30] you
[1:24:31] imagine, whatever you
[1:24:33] do, whatever you say that you do all in
[1:24:38] the name of the Lord
[1:24:40] Jesus, giving thanks to God and the
[1:24:43] Father by him.
[1:24:46] That's my
[1:24:48] heart. When I talk to my
[1:24:51] wife, sweetheart, I approach you in the
[1:24:54] name of Jesus
[1:24:54] [Music]
[1:24:57] Christ. Might be just sitting around the
[1:24:59] table and
[1:25:01] talking. It might be driving to to go to
[1:25:04] go to the
[1:25:05] grocery. It might be standing here in
[1:25:08] front of 150 people preaching about
[1:25:11] Jesus Christ. Whatever I do in word or
[1:25:15] deed, do it in that
[1:25:19] name. That's why we baptize in that
[1:25:21] name. That's why we pray in that name.
[1:25:24] And that's why when we pray, we expect
[1:25:27] to get what we pray for because Lord, I
[1:25:30] have approached you in the name of your
[1:25:33] son. Brother Aaron going and
[1:25:35] representing the the Tucson
[1:25:38] tabernacle. He's saying, I represent
[1:25:40] this church. Amen. If I go and I
[1:25:43] represent you on the field, I go and I
[1:25:46] am representing this
[1:25:49] church. But can you
[1:25:52] imagine really representing a living
[1:25:55] Jesus Christ in everything that you do?
[1:25:59] Oh, whatsoever you do in word or deed,
[1:26:03] do all in the name of the Lord Jesus,
[1:26:05] giving thanks to God and the Father by
[1:26:09] him. Amen.
[1:26:13] And I just want to speak the name of
[1:26:20] Jesus and over every heart and every
[1:26:27] night. Cuz I know there is peace within
[1:26:32] your
[1:26:34] presence. I speak Jesus.
[1:26:38] [Music]
[1:26:44] I just want to speak the name of
[1:26:51] Jesus till every dark addiction starts
[1:26:55] to
[1:26:58] break. Declaring there is hope and there
[1:27:03] is freedom.
[1:27:06] I speak Jesus.
[1:27:14] Your name is power. Think about it. Your
[1:27:18] name is
[1:27:20] healing. Your name is
[1:27:25] [Music]
[1:27:28] life. Break every stronghold.
[1:27:32] Shine through the
[1:27:36] sh like
[1:27:44] before. And I just want to speak the
[1:27:48] name of
[1:27:51] Jesus over fear and all anxiety.
[1:28:00] To every soul held captive by
[1:28:04] oppression. Oh, I speak
[1:28:09] [Applause]
[1:28:12] Jesus. Your name is
[1:28:15] power. Your name is
[1:28:19] he. Your name is life.
[1:28:25] [Music]
[1:28:27] Break every
[1:28:30] stronghold. Shine through the
[1:28:33] shadows. Burn like a
[1:28:41] fire. And shout Jesus from the
[1:28:45] mountain. And Jesus in the
[1:28:49] streets and Jesus in the darkness over
[1:28:54] every enmy.
[1:28:57] Jesus for my family. I speak the holy
[1:29:03] name.
[1:29:05] Jesus. Do you believe it? Do you believe
[1:29:08] in that name?
[1:29:11] Shout Jesus from the
[1:29:13] mountains and Jesus in the
[1:29:17] streets and Jesus in the darkness over
[1:29:22] every enemy.
[1:29:25] And Jesus for my family I speak the holy
[1:29:31] name.
[1:29:34] Jesus shout
[1:29:37] Jesus shout Jesus from the mountains and
[1:29:42] Jesus in the
[1:29:44] streets and Jesus in the darkness over
[1:29:48] every enmy.
[1:29:52] Jesus for my family. I speak the holy
[1:29:57] name
[1:29:59] Jesus. Let's all stand in the name of
[1:30:02] Jesus. Stand up. And your name is
[1:30:06] power. Your name is
[1:30:10] healing. Your name is
[1:30:15] [Music]
[1:30:16] life. Break every stronghold.
[1:30:21] Shine through the
[1:30:23] shadows, burn like a fire. Do you
[1:30:27] believe? Do you believe in that name of
[1:30:31] Jesus Christ? Let me quote him. St. John
[1:30:36] 14 verse 14. Ask anything in my name and
[1:30:41] I will do
[1:30:42] it. I don't really need to read from
[1:30:44] other translations on that one. It's
[1:30:47] pretty simple.
[1:30:49] Ask anything in my name and I will do
[1:30:53] it. And whatever you do in word or deed,
[1:30:57] do all in the name of the Lord
[1:31:00] Jesus. That name is power. Friends, do
[1:31:04] you believe if you have a need this
[1:31:07] morning? Do you believe if we speak that
[1:31:10] holy name of Jesus that he will deliver,
[1:31:14] that he will give you the desire of your
[1:31:16] heart? Do you believe it?
[1:31:18] It's in the Bible. It's not me saying
[1:31:22] it. It's in the eternal word of God. In
[1:31:25] the beginning was the word and the word
[1:31:27] was with God and the word was God. And
[1:31:30] then that word was made flesh
[1:31:34] in this man Jesus Christ. And he said,
[1:31:37] "Ask in my
[1:31:39] name." Do you have a
[1:31:42] need? Then lay your hands on each other.
[1:31:46] The book of Mark says, "Lay hands on one
[1:31:49] another." If you believe in that name,
[1:31:53] lay your hands on each other and believe
[1:31:57] that you will receive what you have need
[1:32:01] of. Pray for that person that you have
[1:32:04] your hand on. Daniel, one more time in
[1:32:06] that in that chorus.
[1:32:08] Your name is
[1:32:11] power. Your name is healing.
[1:32:16] Your name is life.
[1:32:20] [Music]
[1:32:23] Break every
[1:32:26] stronghold. Shine through the
[1:32:30] shadows. Burn like a fire.
[1:32:38] Father, oh dear
[1:32:41] God, you commanded us to lay hands on
[1:32:45] one
[1:32:46] another. And
[1:32:47] Lord, we do this commandment in the name
[1:32:51] of Jesus
[1:32:53] Christ. And we claim, Father, we
[1:32:57] claim those
[1:32:59] promises for Lord, we are a needy
[1:33:03] people. And whether it be a sickness,
[1:33:05] Lord, whether it be a loved one, a
[1:33:07] family member, a job, Lord, whatever a
[1:33:11] spiritual problem, whatever it might
[1:33:15] be, we pray to you in the name of Jesus
[1:33:18] Christ and humbly ask Lord that you
[1:33:21] would
[1:33:23] deliver these
[1:33:25] promises. And then,
[1:33:27] Lord, help us.
[1:33:31] Lord, as I took that bottle of water and
[1:33:33] I poured it in that cup and the
[1:33:36] impurities came
[1:33:38] out, dear
[1:33:40] God, give us
[1:33:43] water. Give us the water of your word,
[1:33:46] Father, that our sins may be washed
[1:33:48] away. And Lord, let it just be an
[1:33:51] abundant source, an artisian spring that
[1:33:54] comes out and it fills up that cup and
[1:33:57] just overflows. and let there not be any
[1:33:59] room for Satan. Father, we
[1:34:02] pray. Father, we love
[1:34:06] you. And once again, we lift up that
[1:34:09] name of Jesus Christ and we claim that
[1:34:14] name. And Satan, you have no part in
[1:34:17] that name. You've tried to destroy that
[1:34:20] name for thousands of years, but Satan,
[1:34:23] you have no part.
[1:34:25] We are complete in
[1:34:28] [Music]
[1:34:29] him. Dear God, we thank you. We thank
[1:34:33] you for your love. Thank you for your
[1:34:35] promises. We thank you for your
[1:34:37] word. Now Lord, I pray for your
[1:34:40] blessings upon every person that's here
[1:34:43] today.
[1:34:45] Lord, none of us are where we should
[1:34:49] be, but help us on that
[1:34:52] path. As we are seeking that place, we
[1:34:55] are seeking that
[1:34:57] city. Lord, guide us. Our guide our
[1:35:00] path, I
[1:35:02] pray. And as we leave,
[1:35:06] Father, may the spirit go with us, guide
[1:35:10] us, and protect
[1:35:12] us. In Jesus Christ's name we
[1:35:16] pray. Amen.
[1:35:21] And I just want to speak the name of
[1:35:25] Jesus
[1:35:29] and over every heart and every mind.
[1:35:34] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Cuz I know
[1:35:37] that there is. Oh Lord, we thank you.
[1:35:42] Oh Lord, we thank you. Lord, you're
[1:35:46] wonderful. Praise God.
[1:35:49] Oh dear God, thank you. And I just want
[1:35:54] to speak the name of Jesus.
[1:35:59] Till every dark addiction starts to
[1:36:03] [Music]
[1:36:06] break. Declaring there is hope and there
[1:36:10] is
[1:36:12] freedom. Oh, I speak
[1:36:17] Jesus.
[1:36:19] Cuz your name is
[1:36:23] power. Your name is
[1:36:27] healing. Your name is
[1:36:32] [Music]
[1:36:34] life. Break every
[1:36:38] stronghold. Shine through the
[1:36:41] shadows. Burn like a fire.
[1:36:48] Fill it
[1:36:49] up. What's that song? Fill my cup, Lord.
[1:36:52] Fill it up.
[1:36:55] Lord, we give you all the
[1:36:58] praise. Keep filling it up, friends.
[1:37:01] Because we're leaky vessels and it just,
[1:37:05] if you're like me, it just pours out.
[1:37:07] It's like I got a hole in my throat and
[1:37:10] it just it just comes out. But I'm going
[1:37:12] to keep filling it up. I'm going to keep
[1:37:14] praying. I'm going to keep reading my
[1:37:16] Bible. I'm going to I'm going to keep
[1:37:18] witnessing to others. I'm going to keep
[1:37:19] helping people. I'm going to keep doing
[1:37:21] everything that I know how to keep that
[1:37:24] cup
[1:37:26] full. And then don't look at the sin.
[1:37:30] Just let it fall out and wash
[1:37:34] away. When Satan tries to point that sin
[1:37:36] to you, say, "Oh, that marshmallow
[1:37:38] floated away, Satan. Yeah, it was there,
[1:37:41] but it's gone. It just it just floated
[1:37:44] off when I filled that cup full of
[1:37:47] water. God bless you, brothers and
[1:37:49] sisters. You're welcome to stay and
[1:37:51] pray. And
[1:37:53] you're
[1:37:55] Tonight, we're going to talk
[1:37:59] about what happens when you do cry call
[1:38:02] upon that name of Jesus. We're going to
[1:38:04] have testimonies tonight. We're going to
[1:38:06] we're going to pass the microphone
[1:38:08] around if the Lord's willing and come
[1:38:10] ready to give your praise, to give your
[1:38:13] testimony. This is what happened to me
[1:38:15] when I called upon that name of Jesus.
[1:38:19] Amen. God bless you, brothers and
[1:38:21] sisters. You're dismissed.
[1:38:24] I see the evidence of your
[1:38:29] goodness all over my
[1:38:33] life. All over my
[1:38:39] life. And I see your promises in
[1:38:45] fulfillment all over my life.
