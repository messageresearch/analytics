[21:15] talking about cancer and what a what an
[21:19] evil demon that cancer is one
[21:24] day the bride of Christ will sit at
[21:27] judgment and judge that demon and cast
[21:31] that demon to the place that it deserves
[21:33] to go how many people has that demon
[21:36] tormented over the
[21:38] years that is the one sickness when
[21:41] brother brandom received his commission
[21:44] there at Greens Mill that angel came to
[21:46] him and he said if you can get the
[21:50] people to believe
[21:52] you and be sincere when you pray then
[21:56] nothing will stand before your prayer
[21:59] not even
[22:01] cancer and he singled that he singled
[22:04] that one disease out because it is a
[22:07] horrible disease and I'll tell you what
[22:10] there was many times that that disease
[22:11] got cast out and brother bram's and
[22:15] during his ministry and during his

[22:37] earlier and we trust that all will be
[22:41] well in according to his his
[22:43] word we um appreciate I watched brother
[22:47] Ryan's sermon last night I think he did

[22:51] job I I really appreciate all that he
[22:55] said I really I really love that that
[22:57] young man he's he's got a calling in his
[23:00] life and and I often kid his Pastor um
[23:05] brother Steve Robson that uh I'm
[23:07] recruiting and um we uh we're going to
[23:11] make a deal to get him to come down here
[23:14] permanently and brother Steve fights me
[23:17] on that I don't know why um we we had a
[23:20] nice time when we went to Los
[23:22] Cruses um it was uh they're really sweet
[23:27] people there and uh brother Caleb has
[23:30] been a good close friend to me for a
[23:32] while now um they've really supported us
[23:35] here at the Tucson Tabernacle and I
[23:38] always want to do the same to them and
[23:41] uh going there it's nice but I'll tell
[23:45] you in ministering to the Believers
[23:49] there I it's not the
[23:52] same I just I love them and they they
[23:56] really love me especially to the youth
[23:58] and they're just they're just a a
[24:00] wonderful group of people but whenever
[24:03] I'm gone I just long to come back home
[24:06] and see these precious people in this
[24:10] audience and just see what the Lord's
[24:12] doing here and my place is here this is
[24:16] where I need to be Brother Martin your
[24:19] place is around all over the place all
[24:21] over the world but my spot is right here
[24:25] in in serving you people
[24:31] I think probably the highlight of my
[24:33] trip was the time I got to spend with
[24:37] brother Josiah and sister Katie on the
[24:39] drive and the numer family the Taylor
[24:41] stit family fryo uh kids it was just and
[24:46] uh sister Gracie your your son Eric what
[24:50] a what a good boy it is just really um
[24:54] really nice being with him and I tell
[24:56] you what they they play basketball when
[24:58] we got there and you know the kids
[25:02] walked out and there was this hush and
[25:06] all
[25:07] this sister Grace's son brother Eric
[25:10] he's like 6'5 and and I mean there's a
[25:13] great basketball player and they're like
[25:15] whoa Tucson Tabernacle has this
[25:17] professional basketball
[25:20] player so so I think he had a really
[25:22] good time since gra we we all had a good
[25:25] time but um brother Josiah and were
[25:28] talking on the way there and I was
[25:31] telling brother Josiah really about the
[25:34] vision that I have for this church and
[25:37] really what I think is the most
[25:38] important there's many churches around
[25:41] the world there's and and every church
[25:45] has a different Spirit not one really
[25:48] any better than the other I never want
[25:50] to compare them but with the Tucson
[25:55] Tabernacle is not a place
[25:58] that I think that especially here
[26:01] tonight brother Joel the pillars in the
[26:04] church seem to be more visible on
[26:07] Wednesday night it's really the a lot of
[26:10] the people that really put their
[26:12] shoulders to the wheel and really work
[26:15] hard and the Tucson Tabernacle I was
[26:18] telling brother
[26:20] Josiah it's not a place that you just
[26:23] come and sit back and hear how great you
[26:26] are and hear how much better you than
[26:29] you are than the denominations or or how
[26:32] you are the elect and you're you're
[26:34] God's chosen people and all that we hear
[26:37] that but you come here to the Tucson
[26:40] Tabernacle to have a Ministry yeah you
[26:44] are here to serve and to work and to go
[26:48] out and bring people to Jesus Christ and
[26:52] to make a difference in the
[26:55] world this is not the place to come and
[26:59] sit back and hear how great you are you
[27:02] are great I believe you're the greatest
[27:04] in the
[27:05] world okay I said it I'm not gonna say
[27:07] it anymore I'm just kidding you are a
[27:11] great people but there is so much work
[27:14] to be done brother Josiah gave me a
[27:17] scripture out of 1 Samuel before we get
[27:20] started I want to read it brother Jordan
[27:23] it's 1st Samuel chapter 22 verse
[27:26] 1 and I thought and I know brother
[27:29] Josiah was thinking the same thing when
[27:30] he gave it to me just now back there I
[27:33] believe
[27:34] this is part of the ministry that we
[27:39] have here at the Tabernacle it says this
[27:41] David therefore departed then and
[27:43] escaped to the cave agela and when his
[27:48] Brethren and his father and all his
[27:51] father's house heard it they went down
[27:53] tither to him and everyone that was into
[27:57] distress and everyone that was in debt
[28:01] and everyone that was discontented
[28:04] gathered themselves unto him and he
[28:06] became a captain over them and there
[28:10] were with him about 400 men and let me
[28:14] tell you those
[28:16] 400 did things that they went through
[28:20] the fire with David they did great
[28:23] things and they didn't lose a battle
[28:26] they they overcame great odds and that's
[28:29] what we should be here at the Tabernacle
[28:32] there are many people to serve there is
[28:35] a lot to do and never be afraid make a
[28:38] step brother Joel make a step go and if
[28:43] you fail you fail it's
[28:46] okay but try do everything that you can
[28:51] so this book this is our Wednesday night
[28:54] bible study it's not a normal service
[28:57] this is where we're going to go through
[28:59] every book of the Bible from Genesis and
[29:02] we'll go through at least the Old
[29:03] Testament all the way to Malachi we're
[29:06] in 1 Samuel now we just got through with
[29:09] the Book of Judges and Ruth now this
[29:13] book of Samuel is right after the Book
[29:18] of Judges some even say that Samuel was
[29:20] the last
[29:22] judge so after Israel was re rescued
[29:26] from Egypt by God
[29:28] they were brought into the promised land
[29:29] with Moses brought up to the Jordan
[29:32] River and then over with Joshua Israel
[29:36] was supposed to be obedient to God and
[29:38] follow his
[29:40] Commandments but Moses had died before
[29:43] they went into the promised land they
[29:45] went over then Joshua LED them he later
[29:47] dies and all that knew Joshua had died
[29:52] the Book of Judges can be summed up in
[29:53] this statement every man did that which
[29:56] was right in his own eyes basically
[29:59] there was very very poor leadership in
[30:02] the land of Israel at that time and it
[30:03] showed the importance of wise and godly
[30:07] leadership
[30:08] everywhere the books of first and first
[30:11] and 2 Samuel show what can happen with
[30:15] good leadership the book is a transition
[30:19] basically from the very lowest time in
[30:23] Israel's history to the very best time
[30:28] in the reign of King David and King
[30:30] Solomon and it's it's a history that
[30:34] goes through this transitional time and
[30:37] this man Samuel
[30:40] plays the pivotal part in taking them
[30:45] from the depths of sin into fellowship
[30:49] with God now there are four main
[30:51] characters in the book in this book of 1
[30:53] Samuel there's Eli the priest there's
[30:55] Samuel the prophet
[30:57] there's Saul the king and then towards
[31:01] the end there's David and David is the
[31:04] answer to the question about good strong
[31:08] Godly
[31:10] leadership so it
[31:12] starts
[31:14] with a
[31:16] couple
[31:18] Hannah and her husband
[31:20] Elena Hannah was a tremendous sister she
[31:26] was a very f faithful lady a prayerful
[31:29] lady eleno was a good husband always
[31:32] encouraging his wife the problem is El
[31:35] that Hannah couldn't have children so
[31:38] Hannah was made fun of by by the elen's
[31:42] other wife and and she was just she
[31:44] wasn't treated right Elena loved her he
[31:47] even told her one time he said he said
[31:49] he said honey he says am I not better
[31:52] than 10 Sons just trying to make his
[31:55] wife know that that he loved her even
[31:58] though she couldn't give him
[32:00] children verse number 11 chapter
[32:06] 1 and Hannah vow a
[32:08] vow and said oh lord of hosts if thou
[32:13] will indeed look on the Affliction of
[32:15] thine handmade and remember me and not
[32:18] forget thine handmade but will give unto
[32:21] thine handm made a Manchild then I will
[32:24] give him unto the Lord all the days of
[32:26] his life and there shall no razor come
[32:28] upon his head so Samuel like
[32:31] Samson had a Nazarite vow from his
[32:35] birth and it came to pass as she
[32:38] continued praying before the Lord that
[32:40] Eli marked her mouth so Eli noticed her
[32:44] mouth
[32:45] moving now Hannah she spake in her heart
[32:50] only her lips moved but her voice was
[32:52] not heard therefore Eli thought she had
[32:56] been drunken so she's praying and she's
[32:59] just mouthing the
[33:01] words and the priest seesar and he says
[33:05] this isn't normal that she must she must
[33:08] be drinking but really what was
[33:11] happening is she was in prayer and and
[33:15] praying to the Lord my friends sister
[33:19] Patricia God bless you it's good it's
[33:21] good to see you welcome my
[33:23] friends um we had a uh sister Patricia
[33:26] and the the fros and I had a little
[33:28] bible study the other day and it's good
[33:31] to have you sis in the family I'm
[33:33] looking forward to meeting your husband
[33:35] back there God bless you we're talking
[33:37] about this book of 1 Samuel and we're
[33:40] talking about we we just started and
[33:43] this sister this lady named Hannah
[33:46] couldn't have
[33:47] children and she's praying at the altar
[33:50] and it came to pass as she continued
[33:53] praying before the Lord that Eli marked
[33:55] her mouth now Hannah she spake in her
[33:58] heart only her lips moved but her voice
[33:59] was not heard therefore Eli thought she
[34:02] had been drunken and Eli said unto her
[34:05] how long will thou be drunken put away
[34:08] thy wine from thee and Hannah answered
[34:11] and said no my Lord I am a woman of
[34:14] sorrowful spirit I have drunk neither
[34:16] wine nor strong drink but have poured
[34:18] out my soul before the Lord she's just
[34:22] crying out Lord give me a
[34:25] baby I I just every everything that I
[34:27] have Lord It's just poured out before
[34:29] you count not thine handmade for a
[34:31] daughter of bile for out of the
[34:34] abundance of my complaint and grief have
[34:36] I spoken hither to that word bile it
[34:40] basically means
[34:41] worthless so she saying here don't
[34:43] regard your servant as a worthless
[34:47] woman then Eli and Eli is the priest Eli
[34:50] answered and said go in peace and the
[34:53] god of Israel Grant thee thy petition
[34:55] that thou Hast asked of him and she said
[34:57] let thine hand made find Grace in thy
[34:59] sight so the woman went her way and did
[35:02] eat and her countenance was no more sad
[35:06] look at the faith of Hannah so she was
[35:11] praying there and just the words of the
[35:14] priest when he said sister receive what
[35:19] you're asking for so she gets up and she
[35:22] remembers what the priest said and she
[35:25] has faith in her prayer so she gets up
[35:29] and she's feeling good and not sad
[35:31] anymore and her faith was raised up and
[35:35] now she is going to
[35:36] receive her
[35:39] prayer so who is this
[35:42] priest that said those words to Hannah
[35:45] this man Eli now remember as I said
[35:47] we're freshly out of the Book of Judges
[35:49] where every man did what was right in
[35:52] his own eyes and there was no strong
[35:54] leadership in Israel which allowed sin
[35:56] to just freely spread not only through
[35:59] the country but right here in the Pulpit
[36:03] through Eli's
[36:06] Sons so Hannah has her child she names
[36:11] him
[36:12] Samuel thus we have the book the name of
[36:14] the book 1 Samuel now first 1 and 2
[36:18] Samuel let me stop right there first and
[36:20] 2 Samuel they're actually one book they
[36:23] were all written in one big long scroll
[36:27] and the reason that they're split into
[36:29] two is simply because they were too
[36:31] long so they were split into two
[36:34] separate books in 1 and 2 Samuel but
[36:37] they were actually originally written as
[36:40] one
[36:41] so remember there was no strong
[36:44] leadership in Israel and this resulted
[36:47] in sin so whatever you wanted to do you
[36:50] did it without receiving any correction
[36:52] from the church any any correction from
[36:54] the government or anyone else it was
[36:56] just a really bad time in Israel and at
[36:58] this time God is angry with the sons of
[37:01] Eli he's angry with the sons of this
[37:03] priest and his sons are also priests and
[37:08] God calls these men the sons of
[37:12] bile worthless Sons so God is
[37:15] calling the the young men the priests
[37:18] worthless and Hannah saying Lord Eli
[37:22] don't don't call me
[37:24] worthless so
[37:28] why were they
[37:30] worthless these priests these young men
[37:33] they would take the choice cuts of meat
[37:35] so they would bring in the offering the
[37:37] burnt offering to the priests and they
[37:39] would give this this meat for a burnt
[37:42] offering on the altar as we've learned
[37:45] from previous Bible studies what these
[37:47] burnt offerings were about so they would
[37:49] bring these offerings in and these
[37:51] priests they take the prime rib and the
[37:55] T-Bones and whatever the good cuts of
[37:58] meat were and they would bring them home
[38:01] with them not only that but they would
[38:04] take the money from the
[38:07] church and use it for their own personal
[38:10] gain and further they use their
[38:12] positions as
[38:14] priests to sleep with the young women
[38:17] that would come in to the
[38:19] sanctuary sinful but it's a carryover
[38:22] remember from This Book of Judges and
[38:24] things are about to change do this baby
[38:27] that's going to be
[38:29] born so a man of God comes to Eli
[38:33] remember Eli's kids Eli's Sons were
[38:36] these priests so a man of God comes to
[38:40] Eli and he prophesies this in in um 1st
[38:44] Samuel chapter
[38:46] 2:35 so this man comes to
[38:49] Eli speaking on behalf of the Lord and
[38:52] he says and I will raise me up a
[38:54] faithful priest that shall do according
[38:57] to that which is in thine heart in mine
[38:59] heart and in my mind and I will build
[39:02] him a sure house and he shall walk
[39:04] before my anointed
[39:07] forever that faithful priest was a young
[39:10] boy at the time and his name was Samuel
[39:13] and he would be one of the greatest
[39:16] prophets that has ever lived one of the
[39:20] greatest prophets in this
[39:23] Bible so after Hannah had given her son
[39:26] to the work of the Lord remember she
[39:28] promised that I give my son
[39:32] to to the the priest I I'll give him to
[39:35] the work of the Lord so he was trained
[39:39] under this man
[39:40] Eli and one night the young boy was
[39:44] laying down in the temple of the Lord
[39:46] where the ark was now the ark this is
[39:50] the same Ark that Moses built is just
[39:53] this wooden box is about 45 in Long long
[39:56] 25 in high 25 in wide there was Mana
[40:00] that had fallen from Heaven remember
[40:02] when they were wandering in the
[40:03] wilderness there was Mana that had
[40:05] fallen from Heaven inside of this Ark
[40:07] The Ten Commandments were in there and
[40:10] Aaron's Rod that had budded and bore
[40:13] almonds was also in there this is the
[40:15] ark that went before the Israelites and
[40:18] caused them to win the battles in the
[40:21] Book of Joshua this is the ark that went
[40:25] before the priests when they came up to
[40:27] the Jordan River and they were going to
[40:29] go across when the water dried up this
[40:32] is the ark that went before them and the
[40:34] priests walked into the river and they
[40:37] walked across on dry land while carrying
[40:39] this Ark this Ark was a big deal this is
[40:43] the ark Where They Carried around the
[40:46] walls of Jericho and these of this great
[40:49] walled City and the walls fell down when
[40:52] they blew the trumpets this is the ark
[40:55] and here is this young boy Samuel and he
[40:58] is sleeping near this
[41:01] Ark young Samuel was in the room and a
[41:04] voice called him said
[41:07] Samuel the boy got up and he went to Eli
[41:10] the priest and he says here I am he said
[41:12] you call
[41:13] me Eli said go back to bed I didn't call
[41:18] you then again a voice calls him Eli it
[41:23] says Samuel he goes back and he says
[41:26] here I am Eli he said you call me and he
[41:28] said go back to bed I didn't call you
[41:32] then it happens again a third time Eli
[41:36] was a man of God he understood these
[41:39] things and he understood that God was
[41:40] calling the young man so he
[41:43] says if this says if this calls you
[41:47] again then say Speak Lord for your
[41:51] servant heares now remember this is a
[41:52] little boy this man s this young man
[41:55] Samuel so God spoke to Samuel again and
[41:58] this started a relationship this is the
[42:00] first time that God had spoken to Samuel
[42:03] this started a relationship between God
[42:05] and His Prophet that really that the
[42:07] world had not seen since
[42:09] Moses from then on Samuel the the young
[42:14] boy would hear this voice of God and
[42:17] move forward and as Samuel grew he rose
[42:21] to the most prominent leader in all of
[42:23] Israel he provided strong leadership
[42:26] remember the leadership that was missing
[42:27] when everybody did which was right in
[42:29] their own eyes in J in judges well this
[42:32] man Samuel Rose and he provided good
[42:36] moral leadership for the
[42:40] Israelites
[42:42] then so the Israelites went to battle
[42:45] against the Philistines the Philistines
[42:47] are mentioned in the Book of Judges and
[42:49] they seem to be the most powerful force
[42:51] in the area at this time and right now
[42:54] they can be considered at this time they
[42:57] could be considered Israel's biggest
[42:58] enemy so they lose the
[43:01] battle and without praying or
[43:03] considering what they were doing they go
[43:06] to Shiloh where Eli was and they take
[43:09] the ark because they knew what had
[43:11] happened when this Ark goes before you
[43:13] they the Israelites take the ark and now
[43:15] they're going to go back to
[43:18] battle so remember the sons of Eli these
[43:22] worthless Sons they're still priests and
[43:26] they go with the
[43:28] ark so they go into the B they go into
[43:31] battle and the F Philistines end up
[43:34] capturing the ark bad bad deal that was
[43:40] that was that was not a good time this
[43:44] is the Arc of the Covenant I described
[43:46] what it was before so Eli who is now 98
[43:51] years old and when when this this battle
[43:55] and when when these Philistines had
[43:57] captured the ark they also killed Eli's
[44:01] Sons so Eli who is now 98 years old and
[44:07] blind and fat the Bible says he's
[44:11] sitting in his chair and he's worried
[44:14] about this Ark and he's worried about
[44:16] the Battle and a messenger comes to Eli
[44:19] and tells him that Israel has lost the
[44:22] battle tens of thousands are dead and
[44:24] his two sons were killed buil but it was
[44:27] the last news that made the difference
[44:30] that the Ark of God had been captured by
[44:32] the Philistines when Eli heard this the
[44:37] 98-year old man fell backwards in his
[44:39] chair he hit the floor broke his neck
[44:43] and was
[44:44] dead and that's the closing of the
[44:46] chapter of this for this priest Eli so
[44:49] God ends up bringing curses so they take
[44:52] these Philistines they take this Ark and
[44:55] they put it next to to their God dagging
[44:57] in the same
[44:59] room
[45:01] so the next day they put it in there the
[45:04] next day this God dagin had fell
[45:09] down so they they set him back
[45:12] up and then they come back in the next
[45:15] day and he had fallen down again but
[45:17] this time his head was broken off and
[45:19] his head his hands were broken off so it
[45:22] scared it scared the Philistines to
[45:24] death because it's like okay well this
[45:26] is beating Our God so then they started
[45:29] to get
[45:30] sick many died tumors came on the people
[45:35] so they ended up bringing the ark back
[45:37] to Israel they got to get rid of this
[45:39] thing and they brought gifts with the
[45:43] ark you know what they brought you know
[45:46] what happened to them they got tumors
[45:47] and stuff they brought back five golden
[45:50] tors and then five golden
[45:54] mice so Samuel grows and Samuel leads
[45:58] Israel decades
[46:00] pass Samuel as I said before he provides
[46:04] strong leadership he provide he brings
[46:06] morality and repentance to Israel and he
[46:09] wins the confidence of the country
[46:12] through both his integrity and his
[46:14] relationship with the Lord this power
[46:17] and Leadership produced peace in Israel
[46:21] and the country was strong in military
[46:24] might and strong in in the spirit of the
[46:26] Lord so as Samuel Grew Older he started
[46:29] placing his sons in prominent
[46:33] positions now remember
[46:35] Eli Samuel's Sons were also not moral
[46:40] men and the people saw this and they saw
[46:44] how Samuel started to get
[46:46] older and it worried them that they were
[46:49] going that Samuel was going to pass away
[46:51] and they were going to be ruled by his
[46:54] sons
[46:56] so the people see the other countries
[47:00] around them how they have Kings and they
[47:02] go to Samuel and they asked him to find
[47:06] them a king to rule over them like the
[47:09] other countries had now remember there
[47:12] had never been a legitimate king in
[47:16] Israel so
[47:19] Israel they had never had a king and
[47:21] they always had a man of God who would
[47:23] speak on behalf of God and Lead but
[47:26] rejected that system now and they wanted
[47:29] to be like the other countries and this
[47:31] really grieved Samuel so Samuel he
[47:34] thought that they were rejecting him and
[47:36] they thought he thought that they were
[47:38] rejecting his leadership so you can see
[47:40] both sides right here put yourself in
[47:43] Samuel's position he's like hey he says
[47:45] have not I led you right and have not I
[47:47] been moral and did I ever take any your
[47:50] any of your money or anything like that
[47:52] and they're like no Samuel we love you
[47:54] but you're old man
[47:56] man you're getting old and your kids
[48:00] they're not you they don't have the
[48:02] character that you have so put your your
[48:06] um self in the people's shoes they're
[48:09] like what are we going to do when Samuel
[48:12] passes away the people were wrong in
[48:15] this but I can understand why that they
[48:18] said
[48:19] that so God tells Samuel to warn the
[48:23] people that they are going to regret
[48:26] this choice and they are going to get
[48:29] their King but this king is going to be
[48:31] about
[48:33] himself and he's not going to be
[48:35] concerned with your
[48:37] well-being and you're going to suffer
[48:39] and believe me they did regret this
[48:43] decision 1st Samuel chapter 8: 19 it
[48:46] says
[48:47] this nevertheless the people refused to
[48:51] refused to obey the voice of Samuel and
[48:54] they said nay but we will have a king
[48:58] over
[48:58] us that we also may be like all the
[49:02] other nations all the nations and that
[49:04] our King May judge us and go out before
[49:07] us and fight our battles and Samuel
[49:09] heard all the words of the people and he
[49:11] rehearsed them in the ears of the Lord
[49:13] so he heard what the people were saying
[49:15] then he goes before the
[49:17] Lord and he says Lord here's what the
[49:20] people are
[49:21] saying and the Lord said unto Sam said
[49:24] to Samuel into their voice listen to
[49:27] them and make them a king and Samuel
[49:31] said unto the men of Israel go ye every
[49:34] man unto his
[49:36] City so then God tells Samuel he says go
[49:40] and he says choose this rich man from
[49:45] The Tribe of Benjamin the best looking
[49:48] man in all of
[49:50] Israel Head and Shoulders taller than
[49:53] the other men the people had the wrong
[49:58] idea of what a leader should be they
[50:02] wanted a tall goodlooking strong Warrior
[50:06] to rep represent them to other
[50:09] countries and that was the desire of
[50:11] their heart to have a man that the world
[50:14] would respect rather than a man that God
[50:17] would
[50:18] respect Samuel brings all the people
[50:21] together to Crown Saul King and he tells
[50:24] them that this is your
[50:28] choice and you have disobeyed God 1st
[50:32] Samuel chapter 10 verse 24 says
[50:36] this and Samuel said to all the people
[50:39] see ye whom the Lord hath chosen that
[50:43] there is none like him among all the
[50:45] people so he's he's got Saul here and
[50:48] he's like look at what a great
[50:50] good-looking guy you have to lead you
[50:52] and all the people shouted and said God
[50:54] Save the King King then Samuel told the
[50:57] people the manner of kingdom and wrote
[50:59] it in a book and laid it up before the
[51:02] Lord and Samuel sent the people away
[51:05] every man to his house so Samuel wrote
[51:08] some church bylaws
[51:11] here he
[51:13] wrote maybe what we would call a
[51:16] constitution he said you've made your
[51:18] choice but here are thing how are things
[51:20] going to run so he put this in writing
[51:23] and and then Saul also went home to
[51:27] gibba and there went with him a band of
[51:30] men whose Hearts God had touched it
[51:33] shows that Saul's Reign started off
[51:35] right really as far as him as far as
[51:38] Saul personally and God gave him every
[51:40] resource that he needed but the children
[51:43] of bile said how shall this man save us
[51:48] and they despised him and brought no
[51:50] presence but he held his
[51:52] peace again worthless people and people
[51:58] complain you know they really do they're
[52:01] going to complain no matter what and
[52:04] here they are they got exactly what they
[52:07] wanted and they complained about it and
[52:11] right here maybe they were right brother
[52:14] martin but right here he says no these
[52:16] are worthless people the Bible says it
[52:18] these are worthless people that
[52:20] complained about
[52:24] that now when when I describe
[52:26] David I want you to notice the
[52:29] difference between what man would choose
[52:32] and what God chooses so Samuel is still
[52:37] upset he's
[52:38] hurt about the People's Choice for a
[52:42] king rather than God and he wants to
[52:45] make his point strongly so he does a
[52:49] miracle in front of the
[52:51] people so that it's a time of harvest so
[52:55] he he looks out and he brings down
[52:57] thunder and lightning and
[52:59] rain so the people notice that this man
[53:03] Samuel is bringing a miracle before us
[53:07] God is is with him and in 1st Samuel
[53:11] 12:19 all the and all the people said
[53:14] unto Samuel pray for thy servants unto
[53:16] the Lord thy God that we die not for we
[53:19] have added unto all our sins this evil
[53:23] to ask us a king
[53:25] 1219 is the is the scripture so do you
[53:29] see the repentance of the people and
[53:32] even though they made the wrong decision
[53:35] watch this God honors their humility and
[53:38] Samuel said unto the people fear not ye
[53:40] have done all this wickedness yet turn
[53:43] not aside from following the Lord but
[53:45] serve the Lord with all your heart and
[53:49] turn not aside for then should ye go
[53:52] after vain things which cannot profit
[53:54] nor deliver for they are vain for the
[53:57] Lord will not forsake his people what a
[54:01] statement for the Lord will not forsake
[54:03] his
[54:08] people for his great name's
[54:11] sake because it hath pleased the Lord to
[54:14] make you his people I'll stop right
[54:17] there for moment and
[54:20] say we sin we make mistakes but it
[54:25] doesn't change the fact that we are
[54:27] God's people God's people are made up of
[54:30] individuals it's not like it's a it's
[54:34] the Tucson Tabernacle it's not like it's
[54:37] this group of people or that group of
[54:39] people it's
[54:41] individuals and it pleased God to make
[54:43] us his
[54:44] people and we always don't forget that
[54:48] no matter how many mistakes that we make
[54:50] never never forget
[54:53] that moreover
[54:58] Samuel speaking here he says moreover as
[55:01] for me now this is the man that was
[55:04] offended as for me God forbid that I
[55:07] should sin against the Lord in ceasing
[55:09] to pray for you but I will teach you the
[55:13] good and the right
[55:15] way what a sweet thing to say what a
[55:20] nice what a what a leader right there he
[55:23] says he says you done all
[55:26] this you're not going to you're not
[55:28] believing me you you've sinned in the
[55:30] sight of the
[55:31] Lord but I won't cease praying for
[55:36] you I will continue and I will continue
[55:40] to teach you the good and the right way
[55:43] no matter how much you stray I'm still
[55:46] going to do my job as the priest as the
[55:51] prophet of God only fear the lord and
[55:55] serve him in truth with all your heart
[55:57] for consider how great things he's done
[55:59] for you but if you shall do wickedly you
[56:03] shall be consumed both you and your
[56:07] king so it deeply really deeply touched
[56:10] me I've read that a few times over the
[56:12] past week but this
[56:15] morning I almost brother Jeremy almost
[56:18] cried thinking of Samuel and the
[56:20] kindness that he showed right there and
[56:24] loving the people so no matter how
[56:26] offended he was that they didn't trust
[56:29] him or trust the Lord for all that he
[56:31] had provided for them he still loved the
[56:34] people and he still prayed for them so
[56:36] star so
[56:38] Saul the king over here he started
[56:40] humble and he started little in his own
[56:41] eyes he won some battles and he made
[56:43] some good decisions he did a good job at
[56:45] the beginning but things started to
[56:47] change it started to be more about Saul
[56:52] in his ministry in his kingdom rather
[56:55] than serving the people and although a
[56:57] king he was a king and a spiritually
[57:00] Gifted Man he thought he could take the
[57:03] place of the
[57:05] Prophet So within a couple years of
[57:07] being King Saul makes his first big
[57:10] mistake and he performs a burnt offering
[57:12] that the priest Samuel should have
[57:15] performed he just got impatient first
[57:18] Samuel 13:13 says this and Samuel said
[57:22] to Saul thou Hast done foolishly thou
[57:25] Hast not kept the Commandment of the
[57:26] Lord thy God which he commanded thee for
[57:28] now would the Lord have established thy
[57:31] kingdom upon Israel
[57:33] forever but now thy kingdom shall not
[57:37] continue sa you made a big mistake here
[57:41] the Lord hath sought him a man after his
[57:44] own heart and the Lord hath commanded
[57:47] him him to be Captain over his people
[57:51] because thou Hast not kept that which
[57:53] the Lord commanded thee thee that man
[57:56] after his own heart was this boy named
[58:02] David I was talking to my wife
[58:06] earlier and reading these and I said
[58:09] honey I said that mistake would have
[58:13] been very easy to
[58:15] make he was Samuel was running late and
[58:19] he's like we got to get the battle we
[58:21] got to get this we got to get this
[58:22] church done we got to get this an
[58:25] offering done so I'll just do
[58:27] it God took the
[58:29] Kingdom from him because of that what I
[58:34] would think is a little mistake but it
[58:36] was important to God so Saul continues
[58:39] in his mistakes and the last straw
[58:42] really for Samuel is when the Lord
[58:44] instructs Saul to go fight this group of
[58:47] people called the amalekites and here's
[58:49] what Samuel
[58:52] says but be first but first let me let
[58:55] me tell a story that's that's sandwiched
[58:57] right in there so Saul has a son this
[59:01] son's name is
[59:02] Jonathan so Jonathan turns out to be
[59:05] this great
[59:07] warrior in the Army so Jonathan and his
[59:10] armor they're going to battle against
[59:12] these Philistines so Jonathan and his
[59:15] armor Bearer armor Bearer is the guy
[59:17] Jonathan was important so he had a guy
[59:20] to carry his armor and his sword
[59:22] whatever he didn't he didn't want to
[59:23] carry this guy would carry it so he
[59:26] tells his armor Bearer he says they they
[59:30] come they come down this this Valley and
[59:32] there's these two big boulders on each
[59:36] side and Jonathan knows that there is a
[59:40] group of 20 Philistines up on the hill
[59:43] now remember these Philistines are big
[59:44] dudes they're not like little little
[59:48] guys like little Israelites they're big
[59:51] strong
[59:52] Warriors so Jonathan goes to his armor
[59:56] Bearer and he's
[59:58] like hey um let's you and me let's go up
[1:00:02] and fight these Philistines like just
[1:00:05] you and me so armor bear is
[1:00:08] like uh
[1:00:11] okay whatever you want to do Jonathan
[1:00:14] I'm with you so he says okay here's what
[1:00:16] we're gonna do we're we're gonna we're
[1:00:18] gonna sneak up there we're going to
[1:00:19] climb up the cliff so they the the
[1:00:21] Philistines had The High Ground so they
[1:00:23] were already at an advantage AG so he
[1:00:25] says here's what we're going to do we're
[1:00:26] going to climb up here and we're going
[1:00:28] to get up close to them and we're going
[1:00:31] to show ourselves it's like here we are
[1:00:34] two
[1:00:35] guys
[1:00:37] and if they say why don't you just stay
[1:00:41] down there and we'll come down there and
[1:00:44] fight you that means we'll go
[1:00:47] back
[1:00:49] but if they say hey why don't you come
[1:00:52] up here and fight us then we'll go up
[1:00:54] and and fight
[1:00:55] him so they're like armor bear is
[1:00:59] like okay I'm with you Jonathan imagine
[1:01:03] what this guy thought this armor bear
[1:01:05] Jonathan had Faith but this armor bear
[1:01:08] he's going
[1:01:09] up so Jonathan and the armor Bearer they
[1:01:12] come out from behind The Rock Says here
[1:01:15] we are the Philistines look
[1:01:17] down and they
[1:01:20] say ah the rats come out of their holes
[1:01:24] he said come up here and fight us you
[1:01:27] know that armor bear was like oh
[1:01:33] great they climb up to the top there was
[1:01:36] an acre of
[1:01:38] land Jonathan and his armor Bearer laid
[1:01:42] waste to these 20 seasoned Warriors and
[1:01:46] it caused such a stir among the
[1:01:48] Philistine Army that was about to fight
[1:01:51] the Israelites that they they got so
[1:01:53] afraid and they got so discombobulated
[1:01:55] that they started fighting each other so
[1:01:58] then Saul sees all this stuff going on
[1:02:01] and he's like let's go to battle so so
[1:02:03] the Israelites go to battle and these
[1:02:05] Philistines are fighting each other so
[1:02:07] the Israelites come in and they just
[1:02:09] destroy the whole
[1:02:11] Army so they they put him on the run so
[1:02:14] here comes Saul and Saul makes a great
[1:02:19] decision for a
[1:02:22] general he's got his Soldier they've
[1:02:24] been beaten and fighting and he makes he
[1:02:27] does something really smart and he says
[1:02:30] let's
[1:02:34] fast your guys are going they're
[1:02:37] fighting they're winning they're tired
[1:02:40] they're thirsty they're hungry and
[1:02:42] you're going to tell them they can't
[1:02:45] eat sometimes it may sound good to us
[1:02:49] but all sometimes it sounds that's a
[1:02:52] good idea let's do that as as a church I
[1:02:55] that that that'll really please the Lord
[1:02:58] but while it may be right over here it
[1:03:01] may not be right in this
[1:03:05] instance so he he says he said we're
[1:03:08] going to have a fast and anyone that
[1:03:12] breaks this fast is gonna die so
[1:03:15] Jonathan was doing his thing he's up
[1:03:17] there
[1:03:18] fighting and he comes
[1:03:21] down and there's a bunch of honey in
[1:03:24] this honeycomb he takes the tip of his
[1:03:28] Rod dips it in the honey and eats it
[1:03:33] witnessed by many people so what
[1:03:36] happened
[1:03:37] was it gets back to Saul that that
[1:03:41] someone had broken his commandment one
[1:03:44] thing leads to the next which leads to
[1:03:45] the next which leads to the next and
[1:03:48] then
[1:03:49] Jonathan comes before Saul and says I'm
[1:03:53] the one that at when you said not to so
[1:03:58] Saul said my
[1:04:01] commandment and you see the
[1:04:03] narcissist personality come out in Saul
[1:04:07] right here he said my commandment was
[1:04:10] that everyone fast and whoever breaks
[1:04:13] this fast you will be put to death so
[1:04:17] put Jonathan to
[1:04:20] death so the people said we not going to
[1:04:24] do
[1:04:25] it did you see what he did to those
[1:04:29] Philistines and you want to kill
[1:04:32] him they disobeyed the king and you know
[1:04:37] what it did it produced fear in
[1:04:42] Saul so
[1:04:44] Saul continues his
[1:04:48] mistakes and then the last straw was
[1:04:50] when
[1:04:52] Samuel gives instruction for Saul to go
[1:04:55] fight these amalekites and here's what
[1:04:58] Samuel says in chapter 15:3 he says go
[1:05:01] and smite amalec and destroy all that
[1:05:05] have have all that they have and spare
[1:05:08] them not very important here but slay
[1:05:11] both man and woman infant and suckling
[1:05:15] infant and little baby ox and sheep and
[1:05:19] camel and ass Saul goes to battle and
[1:05:23] defeats the amalekites but he doesn't
[1:05:25] kill the livestock the people wanted to
[1:05:28] keep the sheep and the goats and the
[1:05:30] cows so he lets them do what they wanted
[1:05:33] to do rather than what God had
[1:05:36] instructed and you can see the fear in
[1:05:39] Saul right here he fears the people
[1:05:41] again remember they had just told them
[1:05:43] we're not going to do what you
[1:05:45] say so the old
[1:05:47] Prophet shows up not only that but Saul
[1:05:51] had not killed the king of the am
[1:05:53] malachit this guy named name
[1:05:55] AAG so the old Prophet shows up and he's
[1:05:58] talking with Saul and he he hears the
[1:06:00] bleeding of the sheep Samuel does and he
[1:06:04] hears the sound of the livestock and
[1:06:06] he's like hey Saul what's that that I
[1:06:09] hear am I hearing
[1:06:12] sheep am I hearing cows Saul says yeah
[1:06:16] the people wanted them and and really I
[1:06:18] was afraid to tell him
[1:06:20] no so Samuel says bring me the king AAG
[1:06:26] told you to kill him too so the king
[1:06:29] walks up to Samuel very
[1:06:32] carefully
[1:06:34] he's in prison he walks up to
[1:06:38] Samuel and he's like
[1:06:41] um the killing's over
[1:06:45] right well killing was not
[1:06:50] over 1 Samuel 15:33 and Samuel
[1:06:55] said as thy sword speaking to this King
[1:06:58] AAG as thy sword has made women
[1:07:00] childless so shall thy mother be
[1:07:03] childless among women and Samuel hewed
[1:07:06] AAG into pieces before the Lord in in in
[1:07:09] gilgal then Samuel went to Rama and Saul
[1:07:12] went up to his house in giba of Saul and
[1:07:15] Samuel came no more to see Saul until
[1:07:18] the day of his death nevertheless Samuel
[1:07:21] mourned for Saul and the Lord repented
[1:07:23] Ed that he had made Saul King over
[1:07:28] Israel
[1:07:30] wow while the king of Israel Saul is
[1:07:33] showing all the wrong character traits
[1:07:35] of a king there's a young man from the
[1:07:38] tribe of Judah the youngest son to a man
[1:07:41] named Jesse who God was working on
[1:07:44] behind the scenes building his character
[1:07:48] this young boy was named
[1:07:51] David Samuel anoints David King when
[1:07:56] he's between 10 and 15 years
[1:07:58] old
[1:08:00] God what brings that what brings that to
[1:08:03] be is God sends Samuel to this man named
[1:08:08] Jesse with the instructions to anoint
[1:08:11] one of his sons King over Israel when
[1:08:13] the oldest son came before
[1:08:16] Samuel the first
[1:08:19] one the best looking one the oldest
[1:08:21] child's always the best looking one
[1:08:26] he had all the gifts that Saul
[1:08:29] had he was the perfect choice 1st Samuel
[1:08:32] 16 Verse 6 and it came to pass when they
[1:08:36] were come that he looked on elab and
[1:08:39] said surely the Lord's Anointed The
[1:08:42] Lord's anointed is before him but the
[1:08:46] Lord said to Samuel look notd on his
[1:08:49] countenance or on the height of his
[1:08:51] stature because I have refused used him
[1:08:54] for the Lord Lord seeth not as a man
[1:08:57] seeth for a man lookth on the outward
[1:09:00] appearance but the Lord lookth on the
[1:09:03] heart then Jesse called abinadab and
[1:09:07] made him pass before Samuel and he said
[1:09:09] neither hath the Lord chosen this then
[1:09:11] Jesse made shimada pass by and said
[1:09:15] neither hath the Lord chosen this again
[1:09:18] Jesse made Seven of his sons to pass
[1:09:21] before Samuel and Samuel said unto Jesse
[1:09:24] the Lord hath not chosen
[1:09:26] these he had eight Sons seven of them
[1:09:30] came before
[1:09:31] Samuel and Samuel said unto
[1:09:34] Jesse
[1:09:35] here are are here all thy children and
[1:09:39] he said There remaineth Yet the youngest
[1:09:41] and behold he keepeth the sheep and
[1:09:43] Samuel said unto Jesse send and fetch
[1:09:45] him for we will not sit down until he
[1:09:48] comes hither and he sent and brought him
[1:09:51] in now he was r
[1:09:55] and with all of a beautiful countenance
[1:09:57] and goodly to look at and the Lord said
[1:09:59] arise and anoint him for this is
[1:10:04] he so Saul continues on the throne so he
[1:10:07] anoints this young man David a very
[1:10:10] strange thing King but yet Saul stays on
[1:10:14] the throne for decades after that goes
[1:10:18] to show that God may have chosen any of
[1:10:21] us to do a great work for for him but he
[1:10:25] has a perfect time for that work to come
[1:10:28] to
[1:10:29] pass David although he was the rightful
[1:10:32] king of Israel from that moment he
[1:10:35] always had the utmost respect for King
[1:10:38] Saul and the position that the king held
[1:10:40] in Israel you never talked bad about him
[1:10:43] and as you'll see here in a few minutes
[1:10:45] he protected the
[1:10:47] king so
[1:10:50] David is a man full of gifts he becomes
[1:10:53] a great leader a great warrior and he's
[1:10:56] also a gifted
[1:10:57] musician and eventually he finds himself
[1:11:00] playing music in Saul's home Saul
[1:11:03] loved King Saul loved David and he loved
[1:11:06] the music so much that David became
[1:11:09] Saul's personal armor
[1:11:13] bear D this man Saul he struggled and he
[1:11:17] would get
[1:11:19] really
[1:11:20] down and and you see this this person
[1:11:23] personality of kind of a narcissist in
[1:11:25] Saul that he was always thinking about
[1:11:28] himself he was always worried that
[1:11:30] somebody was going to take his kingdom
[1:11:32] or take something that's his and it
[1:11:34] really started to ruin his
[1:11:36] life so Goliath so
[1:11:40] David becomes in Saul's court and he
[1:11:43] starts playing for Saul and Saul really
[1:11:46] enjoyed David's playing David's musician
[1:11:50] U musical Talent so Here Comes This
[1:11:53] Philistines this Army of Philistines and
[1:11:56] here we got another War Brewing so we
[1:11:58] have the Philistines they come and then
[1:12:00] and then we have the is is the um Jews
[1:12:03] they come this way and they meet in this
[1:12:05] Valley and they are going to go to
[1:12:08] battle and the the Jews are hooting and
[1:12:10] hollering and they're saying we're going
[1:12:11] to do it we you know we're going to kill
[1:12:13] them and we've got the upper hand and
[1:12:16] then as they are cheering Here Comes
[1:12:18] This
[1:12:19] giant almost 10 feet tall they went
[1:12:26] whoa and they ran
[1:12:28] away this man comes
[1:12:31] out with this
[1:12:33] Shield this sword and this
[1:12:37] Spear and he comes down and he says Hey
[1:12:41] Saul why don't you come down and fight
[1:12:43] me he says why don't you just send one
[1:12:46] person to come out and fight me why do
[1:12:48] we all have to die why is there going to
[1:12:49] be so much Bloodshed just have one come
[1:12:52] against me me and if I win you serve us
[1:12:56] and if you kill me then we'll serve you
[1:12:58] and the Jews were scared to
[1:13:01] death and he keeps taunting them this
[1:13:06] giant very intimidating man so David
[1:13:11] he's out with his sheep his dad's sheep
[1:13:12] and he's cruising along and his dad says
[1:13:15] hey son he says hey bring your brother
[1:13:16] some bread and bring uh this Captain
[1:13:19] bring him some cheese and David says
[1:13:20] okay so he takes it and and he's
[1:13:22] cruising along
[1:13:24] and he comes down and he's like hey guys
[1:13:26] what's going
[1:13:28] on and he sees this giant out there and
[1:13:33] everybody's afraid of him so
[1:13:37] David looks and it disgusts him David is
[1:13:42] a man of great faith and he says listen
[1:13:46] this this uncircumcised Philistine this
[1:13:49] uncivilized man is taunting all of us
[1:13:54] and you're all afraid of him so he
[1:13:57] starts talking and Saul starts hearing
[1:13:59] who is this guy what's this this little
[1:14:02] guy so this little guy comes up David's
[1:14:04] like I'll fight him I'll fight that guy
[1:14:06] God's with us why are you so
[1:14:09] afraid so Saul's like I like his Spirit
[1:14:11] you know I like I like this kid so he
[1:14:14] says okay um and then you know had to be
[1:14:18] thinking well he's going to get killed
[1:14:20] so then David says listen Saul
[1:14:24] he says one time I was keeping my
[1:14:26] father's sheep and he says a lion came
[1:14:30] to get my father's sheep now who would
[1:14:32] you bet on would you bet on one of those
[1:14:35] big African lions or would you bet on
[1:14:38] Goliath I don't know it would be a good
[1:14:40] fight but David said this lion came in
[1:14:44] and he says I took my sling and I killed
[1:14:47] him and he rose up to get me and I
[1:14:51] kill killed him with a knife
[1:14:54] and he says and another time a bear did
[1:14:55] the same
[1:14:57] thing he says I can do it he says I've
[1:15:00] done it before I'll go kill that guy
[1:15:05] so Saul looks down and he says well let
[1:15:07] me put on won you put on my armor Saul's
[1:15:10] like seven feet tall and David's like
[1:15:11] five feet tall so he puts on an armor
[1:15:13] he's like man this is way too big I
[1:15:15] can't even walk in this stuff David says
[1:15:17] just let me do it let me do it my way so
[1:15:20] he takes off the
[1:15:21] armor and he goes down there with his
[1:15:23] little
[1:15:24] sling and he walks down to the
[1:15:27] creek picks up five
[1:15:30] Stones puts him in his script
[1:15:34] bag he looks out across and he sees this
[1:15:38] giant there this giant says
[1:15:42] oh he's like come on you're sending that
[1:15:44] guy to fight me this little squirt he
[1:15:48] doesn't even have armor on you're
[1:15:49] sending him to fight me so all the
[1:15:51] Philistines are watching this too too so
[1:15:55] David listen to the watch the faith of
[1:15:58] David David doesn't just like walk up
[1:16:01] and David takes off
[1:16:05] running at the Philistine look at the
[1:16:08] faith that is in this man David this
[1:16:10] little this young man David and he's
[1:16:13] he's running at the Philistine he takes
[1:16:15] his sling he takes one of those smooth
[1:16:18] stones that he got out of the creek puts
[1:16:20] it in his sling throws it and this rock
[1:16:22] goes right and hits this Philistine
[1:16:25] right in the head the Bible says that it
[1:16:28] sunk into his
[1:16:30] head the giant goes
[1:16:33] down it also
[1:16:37] says this is the literal version the AL
[1:16:41] It also says that David didn't have a
[1:16:43] sword with
[1:16:44] him here's this here's this giant he's
[1:16:47] laying there David
[1:16:49] Goes takes Goliath's sword and chops off
[1:16:55] the Giant's
[1:16:57] head the Philistines were like whoa
[1:17:01] that's like the smallest guy in their
[1:17:02] army I'm out of here they take off
[1:17:05] running the the Israelites go after them
[1:17:09] and the Israelites just lay waste to
[1:17:11] these Philistines so that's
[1:17:15] David just
[1:17:17] shows David's faith in God so Saul sees
[1:17:23] this young man and he starts promoting
[1:17:24] David and David makes friends with
[1:17:27] Jonathan remember the warrior remember
[1:17:30] Saul's son David makes friends with this
[1:17:33] Jonathan and they become really they
[1:17:35] become best friends like really close
[1:17:38] and everywhere David went he was
[1:17:41] successful he won battle after battle
[1:17:44] after battle for Saul and one day when
[1:17:47] David was returning from
[1:17:49] Battle the women were
[1:17:52] singing this is a bad deal for
[1:17:55] David the women were singing Saul's sin
[1:17:59] this guy come in he's like oh you want
[1:18:03] again here he comes and the women sing
[1:18:06] this song they say Saul has struck down
[1:18:10] his
[1:18:10] thousands and David his 10
[1:18:15] thousands Saul took
[1:18:17] notice and a spirit of jealousy began to
[1:18:21] form inside the king
[1:18:23] and from that day on Saul hated began
[1:18:27] hating David and trying to kill him the
[1:18:30] first time the anger came up in Saul he
[1:18:32] picked up a javelin and he said I'll pin
[1:18:35] him to the wall and he Chucks this
[1:18:37] Javelin David Dodges it sticks to the
[1:18:41] wall and David gets out twice Saul did
[1:18:45] that Saul was afraid of David because
[1:18:48] the Bible says he knew that the Lord was
[1:18:50] with him so Saul gave David a thousand
[1:18:53] men and send him to battle with the
[1:18:56] enemies thinking that David he's going
[1:18:58] to go out and he's going to come back
[1:19:01] dead so he sends David out and he over
[1:19:04] and over David fights battles and it was
[1:19:07] insurmountable odds yet David would come
[1:19:10] back
[1:19:11] Victorious so D Saul I forgot to mention
[1:19:16] had made a promise that whoever kills
[1:19:18] this giant would get to marry his
[1:19:20] daughter so David
[1:19:25] this humbleness of David he said he says
[1:19:30] I'm not worthy to be the king's
[1:19:33] son-in-law this is the same man that was
[1:19:36] anointed
[1:19:37] king I'm not even worthy to be his
[1:19:39] son-in-law he ends up going to the ends
[1:19:41] of the Earth for Saul and winning the
[1:19:44] impossible battles so that Saul hoped
[1:19:47] David would die in these
[1:19:50] battles every time he'd send him on
[1:19:53] suicide missions David would come back
[1:19:56] Victorious Saul even plotted to murder
[1:19:59] David when he returned home from the
[1:20:01] battle and Jonathan Saul's son warned
[1:20:04] him and that Spirit would come and go
[1:20:07] from Saul that hatred of him so cha Saul
[1:20:11] chases him so it's D D um Jonathan ends
[1:20:15] up warning David that's hey Saul's
[1:20:17] coming at you this time so David takes
[1:20:20] off Saul goes out after David to kill
[1:20:26] him he brings his army to chase down
[1:20:28] David and David this man's done nothing
[1:20:31] except support Saul
[1:20:35] twice David has the opportunity to kill
[1:20:38] Saul once Saul was in the
[1:20:43] cave David and his men were hiding in
[1:20:46] the cave Saul didn't know they were
[1:20:47] there Saul comes in to use the restroom
[1:20:51] David's hiding
[1:20:53] he comes up to Saul cuts off the bottom
[1:20:56] of his
[1:20:57] skirt Saul
[1:20:59] leaves and another time Saul and his
[1:21:02] army were asleep and David slips in and
[1:21:07] steals Saul's Spear and his water bottle
[1:21:11] while they're
[1:21:12] asleep both
[1:21:15] times David
[1:21:18] repented felt bad for dishonoring Saul
[1:21:22] what a man this man David was I was
[1:21:26] reading about him the past few days and
[1:21:29] thinking Lord how could how could so
[1:21:31] much character be in one
[1:21:34] man how much he respected this man was
[1:21:37] trying to kill
[1:21:38] him and yet David would never raise his
[1:21:43] hand against him he even felt bad for
[1:21:46] stealing a spear sneaking
[1:21:50] in chapter 25
[1:21:54] David meets what would one day David's
[1:21:57] on the run which is most now the second
[1:22:00] half of the book of Samuel 1 Samuel
[1:22:03] David's on on the run and he meets what
[1:22:06] would become his his second wife he
[1:22:08] married Saul's daughter this lady named
[1:22:10] Abigail who at the time was married to
[1:22:12] an evil drunk guy named
[1:22:15] nabal David asked for food from
[1:22:18] nabal and he insults David and his
[1:22:20] soldiers and this angers the whole
[1:22:23] Army to where they're like hey we're
[1:22:26] going to go kill this
[1:22:28] dude and Abigail his wife comes to her
[1:22:31] husband's Rescue by sending out food and
[1:22:34] begging for mercy for her
[1:22:37] husband nael ends up getting drunk and
[1:22:40] when he sobers up his wife tells him
[1:22:42] that she sent help to David and his
[1:22:44] soldiers and the man ends up having a
[1:22:47] heart attack and dies 10 days
[1:22:51] later so so Saul is keeps trying to kill
[1:22:54] David and David's always a step ahead of
[1:22:56] him David goes through horrible times
[1:22:58] hiding in caves and seeing his friends
[1:23:00] killed just for helping him and yet
[1:23:02] through all the evil that Saul did David
[1:23:04] David never turns on Saul he finds a
[1:23:07] little bit of Peace when he lives with
[1:23:10] with the Philistines for a year and four
[1:23:12] months but all the while David was
[1:23:16] helping Israel
[1:23:18] secretly killing Israel's enemies right
[1:23:22] under the nose of the Philistines what a
[1:23:26] man still helping his people right under
[1:23:30] the nose of the of where he found
[1:23:33] peace yet still fighting for the king
[1:23:37] and for his
[1:23:38] people Samuel dies in chapter 28 just
[1:23:42] before a big war between Israel and the
[1:23:45] Philistines Saul wasn't serving the lord
[1:23:48] so when he tried to pray God wouldn't
[1:23:51] hear God wouldn't answer answer him so
[1:23:53] he ends up going to a witch who he
[1:23:55] thinks will let him talk to the dead man
[1:23:58] Samuel remember Samuel just died so he
[1:24:01] goes to this witch and he's like hey I I
[1:24:02] need to talk to Samuel and somehow it
[1:24:05] works the witch tells Saul what Samuel
[1:24:09] says and basically it's that Saul would
[1:24:11] die in battle and that God would give
[1:24:14] the kingdom to David and that Israel
[1:24:16] would lose this battle against the
[1:24:18] Philistines and that tomorrow both Saul
[1:24:21] and his sons would be with Samuel on the
[1:24:23] other side very strange story I really
[1:24:26] don't understand it at all but the thing
[1:24:30] that I take from this story is that God
[1:24:33] had mercy on this King
[1:24:35] Saul even at his death because he
[1:24:39] says that Saul after his death would be
[1:24:43] with one of the greatest prophets in
[1:24:45] history the prophet
[1:24:47] Samuel so Saul loses the
[1:24:51] battle as Samuel said and he along with
[1:24:54] most of his sons
[1:24:56] die and it's
[1:24:58] sad what they do to Saul's body if uh
[1:25:02] the musicians would come and we'll close
[1:25:03] with this 1st Samuel chapter 31 verse 8
[1:25:08] says this and it came to pass on the
[1:25:11] marrow when the Philistines came to
[1:25:14] strip the slain that they found Saul and
[1:25:16] his three sons fallen in Mount gaboa and
[1:25:20] they cut off his head and they stripped
[1:25:23] off his armor and sent it into the land
[1:25:25] of the Philistines round about to
[1:25:28] publish it in the house of their idols
[1:25:30] and among the
[1:25:32] people just desecrating Saul's body and
[1:25:36] putting it on
[1:25:38] display and they put his armor in the
[1:25:40] house of ashteroth their God and they
[1:25:44] fastened his body to the wall of Beth
[1:25:48] sham and when the inhabitants of jabis
[1:25:52] Gil Gilead heard of that which the
[1:25:54] Philistines had done to Saul all the
[1:25:57] Valiant
[1:25:59] men arose and went all night and took
[1:26:04] the body of Saul and the bodies of his
[1:26:07] sons from the wall at ban and came to
[1:26:12] jabish and burnt them there and they
[1:26:16] took their bones and buried them under a
[1:26:18] tree at jabus jabish and fasted
[1:26:22] seven days let's all stand we'll close
[1:26:27] that is the
[1:26:29] end of the first book of
[1:26:33] Samuel this is a great time in history
[1:26:38] Samuel as I
[1:26:41] showed was one of the greatest men
[1:26:44] that's written in this whole
[1:26:46] book and I've
[1:26:49] never have read with the exception
[1:26:53] of the Lord
[1:26:54] Jesus I've never read about a man that
[1:26:58] had such character and that had such
[1:27:02] patience and really that had such
[1:27:05] love as David this young man you can see
[1:27:09] why that it says that he was a man after
[1:27:13] God's Own Heart so that's the book of 1
[1:27:16] Samuel brothers and sisters let's
[1:27:18] continue on with our Bible study I was
[1:27:21] telling Stephan on the way here that I
[1:27:23] wish more people would have would have
[1:27:25] come and enjoyed the book of Acts
[1:27:29] because it it really was it was a
[1:27:30] blessing in all that we learned about
[1:27:33] that now we are going through this Bible
[1:27:37] and it's building this knowledge in us
[1:27:40] and we have to have
[1:27:43] knowledge whenever we talk to
[1:27:47] someone and we don't speak like we un
[1:27:51] understand or know this Bible it hurts
[1:27:54] our
[1:27:55] testimony the more we know about this
[1:27:57] word the more that we are able to use
[1:28:00] this word and to witness now now it
[1:28:03] doesn't understand or knowledge doesn't
[1:28:06] take the place of
[1:28:08] worship but then worship doesn't take
[1:28:10] the place of knowledge either we need
[1:28:13] both of them so let's continue on
[1:28:15] continue on studying if we get through
[1:28:17] this we're gonna have read our whole
[1:28:20] Bible so let's continue on brother
