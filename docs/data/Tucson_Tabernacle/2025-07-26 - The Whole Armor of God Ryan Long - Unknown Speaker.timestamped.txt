[1:21] the song of your redeeming as the saints
[1:24] of every nation
[1:27] are awakening to sing from our heart
[1:31] that comes to an end.

[2:28] Amen. Are you going to surrender to the
[2:29] king this morning?
[2:32] God bless you. Uh it's Sunday school.
[2:33] You can go ahead and be dismissed. But
[2:35] the older kids, we do not have a Sunday
[2:37] school this morning. So, just the
[2:39] younger kids. Awesome. Let's stand up
[2:41] this morning.
[2:47] [Music]
[2:50] I've had many tears and sorrows. I've
[2:55] had questions for tomorrow.
[2:58] There's been times I didn't know right
[3:01] from wrong.
[3:03] [Music]
[3:06] But in every situation
[3:10] and God gave me blessed consolation
[3:14] that my trials will only make me strong.
[3:21] And through it all
[3:25] and through it all
[3:28] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[3:32] I've learned to trust in God.
[3:36] And through it all,
[3:40] And through it all,
[3:43] I've learned to depend upon his word.
[3:51] And I've been to a lot of places and
[3:55] I've seen a lot of faces.
[3:59] There's been times I felt so all alone.
[4:04] [Music]
[4:05] But in those lonely hours, yes, those
[4:10] precious lonely hours.
[4:13] And Jesus let me know I was his own.
[4:17] That's why we sing.
[4:20] And through it all,
[4:24] and through it all,
[4:27] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[4:31] I've learned to trust in God.
[4:34] And through it all,
[4:38] through it all,
[4:41] I've learned to depend upon his word.
[4:48] So I thank him for the mountains and I
[4:52] thank him for the valleys and I thank
[4:56] him for the storms he's brought me
[4:59] through.
[5:01] [Music]
[5:02] For if I never had a problem, I wouldn't
[5:07] know that he could solve it. And I never
[5:10] know what faith God can do.
[5:16] And through it all.
[5:20] Through it all,
[5:23] I learn to trust in Jesus.
[5:27] I've learned to trust in God.
[5:30] Through it all.
[5:34] Through it all.
[5:37] I've learned to depend upon this word.
[5:43] Amen. Isn't it so amazing that we can
[5:45] depend on God's word this morning?
[5:50] You may be seated.
[6:02] Take my hand.
[6:07] and lift them up.
[6:11] For I have not the strength to praise
[6:15] you near enough.
[6:19] For I am nothing.
[6:23] Oh, I am nothing
[6:27] without you. Let's sing that one more
[6:29] time.
[6:34] Take these hands
[6:38] and lift them up.

[6:45] you near. Oh,

[7:16] found
[7:19] for I have nothing.
[7:22] Oh, I am nothing
[7:26] without you.
[7:33] And all my soul
[7:38] needs
[7:40] is all your love
[7:44] to cover me.
[7:47] So all the world
[7:51] will see
[7:54] that I am
[7:58] without you.
[8:04] Take my body,
[8:09] build it up.
[8:13] May it be broken as an offering alone.
[8:19] For I have nothing.
[8:23] Oh, I am nothing
[8:27] without you.
[8:33] All my soul
[8:38] needs
[8:40] is all your love
[8:44] to cover me.
[8:47] So all the world
[8:51] will see
[8:53] that I have nothing
[8:58] without you.
[9:04] and take my time
[9:09] on this earth.

[9:15] all that you are worthy
[9:19] for. I am nothing.
[9:22] Oh, I am nothing
[9:26] without you.
[9:32] And all my soul
[9:37] needs
[9:39] is all your love
[9:43] to cover me.
[9:45] So all the world
[9:50] will see
[9:53] I love me
[9:57] without you.
[10:08] I love you, Lord,
[10:12] for your mercy never fails me.
[10:18] And all my days,
[10:21] they've been held in your hands.

[16:11] It's such a privilege to be gathered
[16:14] together in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[16:17] We had the verse up there earlier. If
[16:18] two or three are gathered in my name,
[16:20] I'm in the midst. He's in our midst. And
[16:23] it's such a privilege that we can be
[16:25] gathered together with one another and
[16:28] gathered together for the purpose of
[16:30] worship in this song that we've just
[16:32] been singing about. All my life he has
[16:35] been faithful. All my life he has been
[16:38] so so good. I I'm still a young guy. I'm
[16:41] only 75, but I can testify to that to be
[16:44] true. I want to read you a little
[16:46] testimony or a portion of a testimony
[16:49] from a from a sister in Israel. Um, last
[16:53] September, we put in a a a prayer
[16:55] request for for prayer for our sister.
[16:57] Um, she uh she had just severe pain. She
[17:01] was brought to the hospital by some of
[17:04] her adult children and uh they uh she
[17:08] woke up two days later with metal rods
[17:11] in her back. She was at stage four
[17:12] breast cancer. Had metastasized. It was
[17:15] everywhere. Her ribs were greatly
[17:17] weakened. And as I say, her back was
[17:19] broken. They had to put metal rods in
[17:21] her back and and the situation looked
[17:26] grim. And that's putting a positive spin
[17:29] on it. Well, I just want to read a
[17:32] little a little portion of a testimony
[17:34] from my heart, mind, and soul are truly
[17:36] running over with blessings. So, hang on
[17:39] while I share with you. last September
[17:40] without warning. Uh my children hauled
[17:44] me to the ER for a CT scan on my back.
[17:46] The pain was awful and the reason was
[17:49] stage four breast cancer had eaten away
[17:51] a few chest bones. My back was broken.
[17:55] Okay. So she goes on talks about some of
[17:58] the places that she went the days and
[18:00] months passed away. She was reminded
[18:01] daily how blessed I am. And now the big
[18:04] news. She says, "In all this time, I
[18:06] have at no time asked for healing,
[18:08] believing his ways are always perfect
[18:10] and his plans are without a doubt
[18:12] perfect, too." Well, this last week, for
[18:14] my 84th birthday, all my life, he has
[18:18] been faithful. For my 84th birthday, I
[18:19] had another PET scan to see what's going
[18:21] on inside. Healed is what happened.
[18:25] Cancer's gone.
[18:30] [Music]
[18:32] That's that's from our sister Patty
[18:34] Ericson. Some of you may know her. Um I
[18:38] have a couple of requests here and some
[18:39] more praises. And let's just put the
[18:41] request in amongst all the praises we
[18:43] have this morning. Uh Sister Holly says,
[18:46] "I have an unspoken prayer request. May
[18:48] God's will be done. God bless you." I've
[18:51] also been told that our brother Alex is
[18:54] is home sick.
[18:59] [Music]
[19:00] Brother Daniel asks prayer for his
[19:03] greatg grandmother. She's been feeling
[19:05] very weak this morning.
[19:07] A very faithful sister in the Lord over
[19:10] so many decades.
[19:13] Oh, and here's another praise from
[19:16] brother Tony Ibara. I would like to
[19:18] praise the Lord because the hospital ran
[19:20] several tests and MRI on my daughter
[19:23] Tony Lisa and they couldn't find
[19:24] anything new. Thank you for your
[19:26] prayers. God bless you.
[19:33] We We serve a God who's alive.
[19:37] When when he was when Jesus was
[19:39] challenged about things, he says, "You
[19:41] Sadducees, you got this wrong. God
[19:43] identifies himself as a God of Abraham,
[19:45] Isaac, and Jacob. And he's a God of the
[19:47] living, not the God of the dead."
[19:49] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had had been
[19:51] around a couple thousand years before
[19:52] that. So, so we have great hope, we have
[19:57] great promise, and we have one another.
[19:59] We need to draw strength from each
[20:01] other. We need to draw strength from
[20:02] him. We need to bring these requests to
[20:04] the Lord. Whatever you may have on your
[20:05] heart that you would like the Lord to
[20:07] do, not so much for yourself, but for
[20:10] someone else who's on your heart.
[20:12] Because if we reach out to others,
[20:15] others will be reaching out to us. And
[20:17] the circle comes together. Jesus said
[20:19] the great sin of those was not Lord I've
[20:22] done all these wonderful works in your
[20:23] name. It's I never knew you. I never
[20:27] knew you. You have to have that
[20:29] relationship with Jesus Christ in your
[20:32] heart. Each of us individually. We can't
[20:34] make it on our great grandma. We can't
[20:36] make it on our parents. We can't make it
[20:37] on our children. We have to make it each
[20:39] one with that relationship with Jesus
[20:42] Christ. Let's go to prayer this morning
[20:44] together. Lord Jesus, we are just in awe
[20:47] of you. We are so grateful for your
[20:50] miraculous touches in so many lives,
[20:53] Lord, and the miracle that you've
[20:55] brought us out of darkness into your
[20:56] marvelous light. Lord, we just pray this
[20:59] morning, Lord, for the needs that are on
[21:01] each heart, Lord. The desires wanting to
[21:04] see others come in, Lord, that you just
[21:06] help us, Lord, to be those lights in the
[21:08] dark places, to be those witnesses for
[21:10] you, Lord.
[21:12] Lord Jesus, I I pray for the offering
[21:14] this morning, Lord, that it'd be used in
[21:16] a way that's pleasing and to you. Be
[21:17] with our pastor, brother Daniel, as he's
[21:20] in Canada ministering to others. And
[21:22] Lord, this morning as our brother Ryan
[21:25] has come down from Flagstaff to minister
[21:28] to us, Lord, our pastor felt led to call
[21:30] him and he felt led to respond. And
[21:31] Lord, we're looking forward to hear the
[21:33] words that you've placed in our heart,
[21:34] Lord, to encourage us and strengthen us,
[21:37] admonish us, help us, Lord, along the
[21:39] way. We thank you, Lord. We're so
[21:41] grateful, Lord. We just want to say that
[21:44] we love you. And again, we want to say,
[21:46] Lord, we love you. And we want to say
[21:48] thank you, Lord Jesus. Amen.

[30:34] and Jesus in the darkness over every
[30:39] enmy.
[30:42] And Jesus for my family. I speak the
[30:46] holy name
[30:48] Jesus.
[30:55] Shout Jesus from the mountains
[30:59] and Jesus in the streets
[31:02] and Jesus in the darkness over every
[31:06] enemy.
[31:09] Jesus for my family. I speak the holy
[31:14] name.
[31:15] Jesus.
[31:18] Shout Jesus.
[31:22] Shout Jesus from the mountains.
[31:26] And Jesus in the streets.
[31:29] Jesus in the darkness over every enemy.
[31:36] And Jesus for my family. I speak the
[31:40] holy name
[31:42] Jesus.
[31:45] Cuz your name is power. Cuz your name is
[31:49] power.
[31:51] Your name is.
[31:55] Your name is loud.
[32:04] [Music]
[32:15] Cuz your name is power.
[32:19] Your name is.
[32:22] Your name is life.
[32:29] Break every struggle.
[32:33] Shine through.
[32:37] Burn like fire. One more time. Your name
[32:41] is power.
[32:44] Your name is healing.
[32:48] Your name is life.
[32:55] Break every stronghold.
[32:59] Shine through the shadows.
[33:03] Burn like a fire.
[33:06] Let's just bow our heads as they play
[33:08] that softly.
[33:11] Lord Jesus, we just want to approach you
[33:13] this morning, Lord. And we know this is
[33:15] what you are, Lord. We know that your
[33:17] your name is the most mighty thing Lord
[33:20] that was ever spoken on this earth.
[33:22] Father that just the mention of your
[33:23] name brought life to a baby in a womb
[33:26] that was dead. Lord just the name of
[33:29] Jesus is enough with when spoken Lord
[33:31] with conviction and faith is enough to
[33:33] send any devil running from our presence
[33:35] this morning from our lives from
[33:37] anything that we have going on. Lord
[33:39] your name is so mighty father because of
[33:42] what it represents. It represents a
[33:45] crucifixion, but it represents a
[33:47] resurrection in power, Lord. And there's
[33:49] something that, Lord, that just no
[33:51] spirit can stand in the presence of that
[33:52] name, Lord. When we cry out your name,
[33:55] Lord, it sends the devils running. They
[33:57] know what's coming, Lord. Lord, I pray
[33:59] you just give us that faith, Lord, and
[34:01] give us that conviction, Lord, to just
[34:03] call out to you, Lord. Not just when
[34:05] things are bad, but when they're going
[34:06] well, Lord. When we when we don't know
[34:08] what to do, we call out to you. When see
[34:10] things seem so sure, we call out to you.
[34:12] when we when we seem to understand, we
[34:15] still call out to you, Lord. And when we
[34:16] feel lost, when we feel hopeless, Lord,
[34:18] we call out to you. May you just, Lord,
[34:21] make it a revelation to us this morning,
[34:24] Lord, of what your name really is, Lord,
[34:25] or what your name really means and what
[34:27] your name has power to do, Father. It's
[34:30] not just words, Lord. It represents the
[34:33] most powerful and high thing ever to
[34:36] live.
[34:38] But you made yourself humble, Lord. And
[34:40] you came and you made yourself one of
[34:42] us, Lord, and died for us, Father. And
[34:45] we could just spend, Lord, all eternity
[34:47] just telling you thank you, Lord.
[34:49] We just want to approach you now, Lord,
[34:51] and just set aside a time, Lord, to hear
[34:53] from you this morning, Lord. May every
[34:55] heart, Lord, mind just be steilled for a
[34:58] few moments, Lord. If we could just hear
[35:00] of your word, Lord. I believe we've
[35:02] worshiped you, Lord. I believe we've
[35:03] made you welcome, Lord. But we also
[35:05] want, Lord, to hear from you this
[35:07] morning, Lord. It would just mean
[35:09] everything to us if you could just take
[35:10] words, Lord, from your Bible, Lord, and
[35:13] just break bread, Lord, with us this
[35:15] morning, Lord, and give us something
[35:16] that we could go out tomorrow, Lord, and
[35:19] fight a battle, Lord, for your for your
[35:21] kingdom, Father, and just strengthen us
[35:23] this morning and speak to us. Honor the
[35:26] faith of those that have come this
[35:27] morning to hear from you, Lord. In Jesus
[35:29] name we pray. Amen.
[35:32] Amen. Appreciated that song service,
[35:34] brother Daniel, and the musicians and
[35:35] the special. It's real good to be with
[35:38] you this morning. And um Brother Dan
[35:41] asked me to just greet you this morning
[35:43] and and um
[35:45] tell you that things were going well
[35:47] where he was at. Um he I think he's
[35:49] preaching four or five services over
[35:51] these last few days. So, I know he's
[35:52] going to be tired. I know he's going to
[35:53] need our prayer for this coming week
[35:56] just for recovery, for strength, for for
[35:59] a little bit of energy. Amen. It's hard
[36:01] enough for one service. I can't imagine
[36:02] five in a row and just and just going
[36:04] through a teaching of the people. But he
[36:05] said, uh, greet the congregation.
[36:07] They're going better than expected, the
[36:09] meetings. And I pray that just many
[36:11] souls will give their lives to Jesus.
[36:13] Amen. They have a service going on today
[36:14] and tonight. And just remember the
[36:16] pastor in prayer if you would. I I know
[36:18] that you do, but it's good to good to
[36:20] get a report of how the battle's going.
[36:22] Amen.
[36:24] And I just want to always thank uh
[36:26] brother Dan for the invitation and thank
[36:28] you for your for your welcoming um
[36:32] spirit. It's always comforting when
[36:36] people are expecting to hear from the
[36:38] Lord because then it just makes makes
[36:40] the job as the preacher pretty easy.
[36:41] Brother Aaron, you just kind of get out
[36:43] of the way and the Lord is going to
[36:45] speak directly to those who expect him
[36:47] to speak to them. Amen. Let's just take
[36:49] a scripture while you're standing and um
[36:52] Ephesians chapter 6.
[37:01] Had a few things on my heart this week
[37:03] and wasn't real sure which direction to
[37:04] go and then just started um listening to
[37:07] a few messages this week and just really
[37:09] started studying the last two nights and
[37:11] and uh last night just really I think
[37:14] the Lord put something on my heart. I
[37:15] just want to talk about a subject. I
[37:17] think most of us are familiar with this
[37:19] scripture. Maybe have heard it many
[37:21] times even in Sunday school. And I um
[37:24] just want to approach this uh you know
[37:27] uh not to tell you anything new but to
[37:29] tell you what's already in the word and
[37:30] just bring a reminder to us of what the
[37:32] Lord has for us. Amen. And what he's
[37:34] done for you. I mean in Ephesians 6 um
[37:37] and let's just read verse
[37:40] uh 10. Start with verse 10. It says,
[37:41] "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the
[37:44] Lord." and then the power of his might.
[37:47] Amen. I'm glad it's not my might that
[37:49] I'm going to be fine strengthened. It
[37:51] would fail pretty quickly. Verse 11, put
[37:53] on the whole armor of God, that you may
[37:56] able to stand against the ws of the
[37:58] devil.
[38:00] For we wrestle not against flesh and
[38:02] blood, but against principalities,
[38:04] against powers, against the rulers of
[38:06] the darkness of this world, against
[38:08] spiritual wickedness in high places.
[38:11] Wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[38:13] of God, that you may a may be able to
[38:15] withstand in the evil day, and having
[38:18] done all to stand, stand therefore,
[38:22] having your loins gird about with truth,
[38:24] and having on the breastplate of
[38:25] righteousness, and your feet shaw with
[38:27] the preparation of the gospel of peace,
[38:30] above all, taking the shield of faith,
[38:32] wherewith you should be able to quench
[38:35] all of the fiery darts of the wicked,
[38:37] and take the helmet of salvation, and
[38:39] the sword of the spirit, which is the
[38:42] word of God.
[38:44] And 18 is the last verse. Praying always
[38:47] with all prayer and supplication to the
[38:49] spirit and watching there unto with all
[38:51] perseverance and supplication for all
[38:54] saints. You may be seated. And I want to
[38:57] make sure I get a
[38:59] timer this morning.
[39:02] Even if I ignore it, I could just still
[39:04] have it here to say that I put one on.
[39:07] No, we do want to be respectful of the
[39:09] time. I I want to just apologize in
[39:11] advance if you would uh let me when I
[39:13] started to look into these subjects like
[39:16] all subjects in the Bible. I realize
[39:19] that you could spend probably a month on
[39:20] each one of these items and here I am uh
[39:24] an insufficient speaker going to try to
[39:26] cover them all in 45 minutes to an hour.
[39:29] And we know that's just not possible.
[39:31] But the word of God is eternal. So what
[39:32] I really just pray for is uh your
[39:34] patience. And I pray for that the Lord
[39:36] would take exactly what is needed to be
[39:38] heard. Extract out even if it's one
[39:40] sentence and it may be just what you
[39:42] need for today and for tomorrow that he
[39:44] would just extract that out and give it
[39:45] to you even though there's hours and
[39:47] hours of of things that could be spoken
[39:49] on. Um I I just want to make way for the
[39:52] Lord to just give us what he wants in
[39:53] just a few minutes. Amen. I believe that
[39:54] he'll just give you exactly what you
[39:56] have need for.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Um it doesn't matter how long or how
[39:59] short we give them. You know, one word
[40:01] from him is enough to go and defeat the
[40:03] devil with. So even if we get five or
[40:05] six or 10 words out. Amen. So I just
[40:07] want to say sorry uh it's not sufficient
[40:09] to cover these things in 45 minutes to
[40:11] an hour. Uh but we know we're limited on
[40:13] time. We know we're limited as human
[40:15] beings how much we can take in and how
[40:16] much our our minds can handle. Um and so
[40:19] I just want to say that in advance. Uh I
[40:21] I would I would encourage you to go and
[40:23] study these things for ourselves. You
[40:25] know, I don't believe that it's up to
[40:27] just brother Dan and the minister on
[40:28] Sunday and Wednesday to give us all of
[40:30] our food. I don't know about you, but I
[40:32] don't eat once a week.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Anybody eat one time a week?
[40:38] &gt;&gt; All right, good. There was no hands on
[40:39] that. Nobody eats once a week. Nobody
[40:41] even eats twice a week. If we're just
[40:43] coming and getting our spiritual food
[40:44] from church,
[40:46] &gt;&gt; uh you're not going to last very long.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Just like in the natural, you're not
[40:49] going to last very long if this is the
[40:51] only place that you're getting food
[40:52] from. We ought to be going home. We
[40:53] ought to be digging into our word. I'm
[40:55] sure that you are doing that. If you're
[40:57] not, it's time to start getting a little
[40:58] bit of nourishment and food when we get
[41:00] home. And then when we come to church,
[41:01] when they start serving up food here,
[41:03] oh, it makes sense exactly what it is.
[41:05] Oh, I know what he's talking about. I
[41:06] read that this week. I heard that a week
[41:08] ago. Amen. So, I just want to give you
[41:10] just a little appetizer this morning.
[41:11] And I just want to go over these the
[41:13] whole armor of God. If I could just uh
[41:15] tell you about what I want to talk to
[41:16] you about is dressed for battle.
[41:19] I want us to be dressed for battle. You
[41:21] know, the Lord wants you to be dressed
[41:23] for battle this morning.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; And just in this scripture, it says, you
[41:26] know, first thing you want to notice is
[41:28] that we're fighting a battle. And I
[41:30] think I might have told you maybe a
[41:31] couple weeks ago when I was here and I I
[41:33] just said, "Look, if you're if you're
[41:34] you're fighting you're fighting some
[41:36] kind of battle, if you're not fighting a
[41:38] battle, there's something wrong."
[41:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; And so if you have decided to follow
[41:44] Jesus,
[41:45] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[41:45] &gt;&gt; you are in a battle.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; You don't have to go searching for a
[41:49] battle. You don't have to go looking for
[41:51] it. You don't have to go looking for a
[41:52] fight. The moment that you say, "Lord, I
[41:54] give my heart to you. I want to be one
[41:56] of your children." And the battle has
[41:58] now started.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; And if you're in a battle, I I love
[42:01] this. If you're in a battle, the Lord
[42:04] says, "Now, I'm going to equip you for
[42:06] that battle. I'm going to give you
[42:07] exactly what it takes to fight the
[42:09] battle that I know is coming." And you
[42:11] know, he has a secret. And and we'll
[42:13] just say the secret right up front. It's
[42:14] not really a secret. He'll tell you, you
[42:16] know, I've already already conquered
[42:18] this enemy.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; I've already beat this enemy for you.
[42:21] But what I'm going to give you is a
[42:22] equipment and an armor so that you can
[42:25] withstand until you get a revelation
[42:27] that I've already defeated this enemy.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; And that when you go into battle, you
[42:31] know, battle usually, you know,
[42:33] sometimes we have a battle Sunday
[42:34] mornings, right? Sometimes we have a
[42:37] little bit of battle Sunday morning,
[42:38] maybe getting up and coming to church or
[42:40] having the right mindset. Sometimes we
[42:41] get in a little bit of argument in the
[42:42] car. Nobody has to say amen about that
[42:45] one. a little bit of argument in the car
[42:46] on the way to church, you know, and we
[42:48] have little battles here and there, but
[42:49] the real battle begins tomorrow morning.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; You know, when you have to go outside of
[42:54] the church and you have to go back to
[42:55] work and you have to go back and be with
[42:57] people who don't believe like you
[42:58] believe, maybe you have to rub elbows
[43:00] with with somebody in the world. Nothing
[43:02] against the person. It's just we have
[43:03] jobs. We have things that we have to do.
[43:05] We have to go to the grocery store. We
[43:07] have to do all these things. So, you're
[43:08] going to you're going to come in contact
[43:09] with uh not the enemy as the people, but
[43:12] you're going to come in contact with
[43:13] enemy as in spirits.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; And that's when the battle begins. And
[43:17] that's what you are uh Lord willing
[43:20] through the word, that's what you're
[43:21] being equipped to deal with.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; And we're fighting a spiritual battle.
[43:26] If we're fighting, he says right here,
[43:27] we're not fighting a battle against
[43:28] flesh and blood. You know, maybe that
[43:30] person who comes up to you and just uh
[43:32] says something bad about you, some
[43:34] something bad about your family or about
[43:36] your church, about the thing that you
[43:37] believe in or that that's nonsense.
[43:39] There's nothing to a Christian life.
[43:40] Well, I'll just live any way I want. You
[43:42] can just love whoever you want. You know
[43:43] what? That flesh and blood person is not
[43:45] your enemy.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; And a lot of times it's easy to
[43:48] associate them as an enemy and say,
[43:49] "Well, I just don't like that person and
[43:51] they're evil." No, it's a spirit that we
[43:53] battle against. And unfortunately, maybe
[43:55] that that person has lost that battle
[43:58] against the spirit.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; But if you see it and you recognize that
[44:01] you haven't lost the battle against the
[44:03] spirit and that's who we fight against.
[44:05] And if we're fighting a spiritual
[44:07] battle, then we need spiritual equipment
[44:09] to fight that battle. Amen.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; When we talk about the armor of God, I
[44:12] don't think anybody except maybe the
[44:14] real real little kids, you know, I
[44:15] remember being in Sunday school and I
[44:16] heard about the armor of God. I thought
[44:18] we were going to get actual armor. I was
[44:20] a bit disappointed when I didn't get my
[44:22] actual sword. When I became an adult and
[44:24] became in church, I thought I'd be
[44:26] getting some a shield. It just didn't
[44:28] happen that way. It's spiritual
[44:30] equipment that he gives us. Amen. And
[44:32] and make no mistake, when you accept the
[44:34] Christian life, you're in a battle.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; How many feel like they're in a battle?
[44:40] &gt;&gt; It's a good thing to feel like you're in
[44:41] a battle.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you don't feel like you're in a
[44:43] battle, it's it's uh we might want to go
[44:46] back and check if we really have made
[44:47] that commitment to walk this Christian
[44:49] way. It's a war. It's a fight. It's a
[44:52] battle. But at the same time, it's a
[44:55] victory.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; You know that.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; I know sometimes you're in the middle of
[45:00] the battle, it doesn't feel like that
[45:01] cuz sometimes you hear that, you're
[45:02] like, "Brother, I'd really like that
[45:04] victory right now
[45:05] &gt;&gt; cuz I am going through it." But every
[45:07] battle that you fight with the Lord has
[45:10] already been won. So really what you're
[45:12] fighting is you're just fighting into
[45:14] the process of a victory.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; I know that's hard to grasp sometimes
[45:19] because it doesn't feel like a victory,
[45:21] but you are fighting something that's
[45:23] already been won.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; It's a victory. It's already been
[45:29] overcome. We just need to accept it.
[45:31] It's already the enemy has already been
[45:33] conquered. We just need to and in a way
[45:35] this is a paradox but in a way fighting
[45:38] will bring you fighting in a battle will
[45:40] bring you the thing that no other thing
[45:43] can bring you and that's peace.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; You think I don't want to fight any
[45:47] battles. I want peace. That's you won't
[45:49] ever have peace unless you prepare for a
[45:52] battle.
[45:55] It seems like a paradox. What do you
[45:56] mean? You I'm going to go fight a
[45:57] battle. I'm going to find peace in that.
[45:58] No, it's it's it's Listen now. Peace is
[46:01] not absent conflict.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Peace is confidence in the Lord while
[46:08] you're in the middle of a battle.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Knowing that I do not care. You know, we
[46:12] need to get to the point that we do not
[46:14] care the outcome of the battle. The Lord
[46:17] has it and he directs it and the outcome
[46:19] is what he wants. Even if that cost me
[46:21] my life,
[46:23] even if it cost me my family, it cost me
[46:25] my job, it cost me my loved ones, it
[46:27] cost me my friends, no matter what the
[46:29] outcome is, the Lord has control over
[46:32] it. Or I have control over it. And I
[46:34] don't want control over it.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; I don't need to. If you if you lose your
[46:39] life, you'll find it.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; But if you try to save your life, you'll
[46:43] lose it.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Exactly. And really that I think
[46:45] sometimes we get we get worried and we
[46:48] get anxious and we get anxiety because
[46:51] we are having control of the battle
[46:53] &gt;&gt; because the outcome matters too much to
[46:56] us. You know what? I really want to go
[46:57] through this but what if it cost me my
[46:59] life? Oh, I don't know about that one.
[47:03] But if you your life if your actual life
[47:07] is lost in the service of the king, you
[47:10] have not lost a thing. Amen.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; You have gained eternal life.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; And I know that's easier said than done
[47:18] none, right? When you have a loved one
[47:19] in the hospital, when you're in the
[47:21] hospital, but the battle is the Lord's.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; The battle is not mine. I just want to
[47:26] submit myself to his way. And the
[47:29] outcome I can live with or I can die
[47:32] with. I can do whatever he wants because
[47:34] he's in control. And I really feel like
[47:36] when that when we get now, that's words
[47:38] that sounds good, right? But that has to
[47:40] drop down from here down into here with
[47:43] revelation
[47:45] &gt;&gt; because we can say that, right? We could
[47:47] say that and then the battle gets real
[47:48] hard.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; But when it drops down and you realize,
[47:51] oh, even if I lose my life, I win.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, the battle just gets easy. What do
[47:58] you mean? Even if I lose the life of my
[48:00] children, I win.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; What worry do you have? What struggle do
[48:06] you have if no matter what you do, you
[48:09] win?
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; If no matter what happens to you at the
[48:13] end, you win.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; It should take the worry and the fear
[48:17] right away from it.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; And I just want to uh just just to just
[48:22] to cover one thing real quick. You just
[48:25] so you know, this covers all ages.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; It covers all ages. You know, uh, God
[48:31] was just, he was not against using what
[48:33] we believe to be maybe 16, 17 year old
[48:35] boy to go to go slay a giant.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm too young. No, you're not too
[48:40] young.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; I've seen the world take I've seen the
[48:43] world take eight year olds and
[48:45] nineyear-olds and 10 year olds and six
[48:46] years olds. You're not too young to put
[48:49] on the armor and fight for God
[48:51] &gt;&gt; because God's doing the fighting.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; And guess what? You're not too old.
[48:56] Hear me now. you're not too old to put
[48:59] on the armor and and and renew it a
[49:01] little bit and get in the fight. There's
[49:03] a scripture I I just wrote it down real
[49:04] quick. It reminded me in Joshua 14, he
[49:07] approaches Caleb. And Caleb has been
[49:10] retired retired from fighting for quite
[49:13] a while, living in his home. He's
[49:14] comfortable. And and Joshua approaches
[49:16] said, "Hey, we have more enemies to
[49:18] face." And Josh and Caleb says, "I'm 85
[49:21] years old." And he gets up from his
[49:23] where he's sitting. And he goes, "I'm
[49:25] ready to go take that mountain at 85
[49:27] years old." In fact, he says this. He
[49:29] says, "I'm 85 years old." He goes, "I
[49:31] was 40 when Moses called me, and I've
[49:33] lived 45 years fighting for the Lord."
[49:36] And he goes, "And I am as strong this
[49:39] day as I was in the day that Moses sent
[49:42] me
[49:43] &gt;&gt; at 85 years old.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; My strength, as my strength was then,
[49:49] even so is my strength now. for war
[49:53] both. Now listen, watch the revelation
[49:54] that Caleb has. He says for war, both to
[49:58] go out and to come in. So his his
[50:02] strength was not just to go, brother
[50:03] Aaron, to go and fight a war. He knew
[50:06] that there was a coming back in which
[50:08] means he knew there was a victory
[50:10] already for him.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; It's not just a a faith to go out, well,
[50:14] I'll just go needlessly and fight this
[50:15] war. That no, no, no, no, no. When a
[50:17] revelation has dropped down like it has
[50:19] with Caleb, he says, "I have strength
[50:21] both to go out and fight and guess what?
[50:22] I'm coming back.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; I win. I win."
[50:27] &gt;&gt; That's the attitude that we have to have
[50:30] in this day. As the scripture said, in
[50:32] the evil day, we have to stand
[50:36] &gt;&gt; not just to go and needlessly fight and
[50:37] throw your life against the world like
[50:39] like like just draws against the wind.
[50:42] No, no. You have to have a revelation
[50:44] that listen, I have strength to go out
[50:46] because he's my strength and I'm coming
[50:49] back in.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Watch Caleb at 85 years old says, "I'm
[50:52] going to go fight this battle and guess
[50:53] what? I'm coming back home."
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; At 85 years old,
[50:58] &gt;&gt; glory to God.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; And he was facing He was facing real
[51:01] swords and real shields and real spears.
[51:04] But we face that enemy today. It's not
[51:06] flesh and blood, but it's spirits. Amen.
[51:09] And it says, "Having done all to stand."
[51:11] I always just love this part of the
[51:12] scripture how it puts a it puts a space
[51:14] between these verses. It says, "Having
[51:17] done all to stand."
[51:20] Stand. And I think sometimes many times
[51:23] I have I don't know about you. I can't
[51:25] speak for you, but I I see it. I just
[51:27] think it's a common thing. I think many
[51:28] times I've I've I've stood without doing
[51:31] everything that I can to stand.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Correct? And then when I fail and when I
[51:36] stumble and when I fall down, I think,
[51:38] well, Lord, I I I did what you said. I
[51:40] stood and here I did. I I took a blow. I
[51:43] I I I I went and messed up. I did
[51:45] something that I didn't want to do. I
[51:46] thought I was supposed to be standing.
[51:47] And I wonder if I I didn't do all that I
[51:50] See, he gives you a recipe. He gives you
[51:52] a path. He gives you an exact
[51:54] instructions to follow. He says, "Now,
[51:57] you're going to do all you can do to
[51:59] stand before you stand. And all that you
[52:02] can do before you stand is to put on the
[52:03] armor of God so that when you stand up,
[52:05] you can withstand the enemy.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; I think a lot of times I get on one or
[52:09] two pieces of the armor that I'm real
[52:11] comfortable with, right? The ones that I
[52:13] do real good with, maybe not on the
[52:15] faith side, but maybe on this other side
[52:16] I don't do so well. And I'm like, well,
[52:18] I got I got one piece of armor. I'm
[52:20] going to go stand. And then I fall.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Maybe I'm just speaking to me this
[52:25] morning, but that's just that there
[52:26] there there's in specific instructions.
[52:28] Let's just look at these pieces of
[52:30] armor. This is so basic in beginning. So
[52:32] you just excuse me. This is a little
[52:33] Sunday school lesson. I remember
[52:35] learning this as a kid, but I I just
[52:37] like to learn it again if you don't
[52:38] mind. The belt of truth. You know,
[52:40] there's an order even to how the armor
[52:42] is put on in the Bible.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; You think, oh, it's just random. He just
[52:45] listed all the armor pieces because you
[52:47] know, as a you know, as an enthusiastic
[52:50] little kid and maybe sometimes as
[52:51] enthusiastic Christians, Brother Daniel,
[52:53] you know what we want to run to if a set
[52:56] of armor Oh, he said it. He said it. You
[52:59] see a set of armor over there and the
[53:00] Lord says, "Go put it on." What are you
[53:01] going to run to? Oh, the sword. Man, I
[53:04] like that sword, right? And then we take
[53:07] the sword and what do we do? If we
[53:08] didn't have the rest of the armor, this
[53:10] is the sword, by the way. We take the
[53:12] the sword and we start cutting into
[53:14] things we don't even know what we're
[53:15] doing.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; We start cut. Oh, I'm just going to be
[53:18] cutting the devil and then I hit Daniel,
[53:20] brother Daniel, over here accidentally
[53:21] with the sword, right? Because I don't
[53:23] know how to yield it. The sword is the
[53:25] last thing that you pick up in this
[53:27] scripture.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing?
[53:31] &gt;&gt; It's the very last thing that you pick
[53:33] up.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; The rest of the stuff he gives you is
[53:35] for defense.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful that the Lord
[53:39] doesn't give you an offensive weapon at
[53:42] the beginning? He gives you defense.
[53:44] Here's how you protect yourself because
[53:46] you're about to get attacked.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; You are about to get attacked if you're
[53:51] not been attacked already. the belt. It
[53:53] It seems like such a well, it's a belt.
[53:55] I I started to read to the belt and I
[53:57] was like, I don't even know if I would
[53:58] make it past the belt.
[54:00] It It was so much in just the belt of
[54:02] truth because I It's not It's Yes, it's
[54:06] talking about spiritual equipment, but
[54:08] we He's using words and he's using items
[54:10] that we recognize so we would know what
[54:12] they do. It's a belt. It holds
[54:14] everything together.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; It holds everything together. You could
[54:17] put on a set of clothes and and if you
[54:19] don't have a belt, you might lose your
[54:21] pants. Your shirt might come untucked.
[54:22] You're going to be in trouble.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; And I know maybe sometimes that's funny,
[54:26] but in battle, when you're in battle,
[54:29] you need something
[54:32] that just holds so close to you.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; That it becomes really becomes part of
[54:37] you. And there's a funny thing about the
[54:39] truth. You know, the truth is um it's a
[54:42] little bit of a funny thing.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; You excuse me. I'm I'm trying to go as
[54:46] fast as I can. I got I already used
[54:49] quite a few minutes here.
[54:51] The truth is what it is regardless of
[54:54] you agree with it and you believe it and
[54:56] you understand it and you acknowledge it
[54:59] ra the world may not acknowledge what
[55:01] the truth is. It's just the truth. It is
[55:03] what it is. It can't change. It is the
[55:06] truth. Okay. So it is what it is whether
[55:09] I understand it or not.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Well, once I understand it, I'll know
[55:12] why it's No, it just is the truth. It
[55:14] just is what it is. It's very hard for
[55:16] our words to describe it, especially my
[55:18] words, but it just is what it is. It's
[55:21] it's the foundation and it holds
[55:23] everything together. In John 17, he
[55:25] says, I love this. You want to be
[55:27] encouraged? Do you want to be
[55:28] encouraged?
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Go home and read John 17, the chapter.
[55:32] You know what that is? That is Jesus,
[55:35] the son of God, praying for you.
[55:38] Wouldn't
[55:41] you love him to stand right up here or
[55:43] maybe come down in a in a prayer line
[55:45] and lay his hands on you and pray for
[55:46] you? If you go read John 17, it's Jesus
[55:49] Christ himself praying for you.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Here's what he says in part of the
[55:53] prayer. He says, uh, sanctify them
[55:56] through thy truth. Thy word is thy
[55:59] truth. Thy word is thy truth. You'll
[56:01] find all the stuff starts to connect
[56:02] together. But there's a scripture right
[56:04] before then that I just kind of I just
[56:06] accidentally read and I just loved it.
[56:07] He says, "I pray." He's praying to the
[56:09] Lord about you.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; He says, "I pray, Lord, that you should
[56:14] not take them out of the world."
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; What a prayer. Wait a minute. I thought
[56:19] that he would pray, Lord, save them from
[56:22] the world. Lord, deliver them from the
[56:24] world. That's not what he prays for. He
[56:25] says, "I pray that thou shouldest that
[56:28] that not I pray not that thou shouldest
[56:31] take them out of the world, but that
[56:32] thou should keep them from evil."
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God's prayer is not to take you
[56:38] out of a battle and set you over here on
[56:40] the side. You just stay over here. No,
[56:42] no, no. Lord, leave them in the battle,
[56:45] &gt;&gt; but protect them from evil in that
[56:47] battle. How is he going to protect you?
[56:49] He's going to give you armor to protect
[56:50] you.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; They are not of this world even as I am
[56:54] not of the world. And then he says,
[56:55] sanctify them through thy truth. The
[56:57] word is the truth. Jesus said, Sunday
[57:00] school scriptures now, I am the way, the
[57:04] &gt;&gt; truth,
[57:05] &gt;&gt; and the life. He didn't say, "I speak
[57:06] the truth." He didn't say, "I talk the
[57:09] truth." He didn't say, "I know the
[57:10] truth. Let me give you some truth." He
[57:12] says, "I am the truth." Which means
[57:14] whether I understand him or not, whether
[57:16] I know everything about him or not, he
[57:18] is the truth. He is what it is. Amen.
[57:21] And you know, and that same thing, what
[57:23] is Satan?
[57:24] Jesus says this in John 8, speaking to
[57:27] the Pharisees, he says, "You Pharisees,
[57:29] you are of your father, the devil, and
[57:32] the lust of your father you will do." He
[57:34] was a murderer from the beginning and
[57:37] abode not in the truth because there is
[57:40] no truth in him.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; He doesn't have the belt.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Why is that important?
[57:51] We'll see. When he speaketh a lie, he
[57:54] speaketh of his own. For he is a liar
[57:57] and the father of it. He's the father of
[57:59] lies. Every time Satan tells you
[58:01] something, and I know he tells you
[58:03] something.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz you're in a battle.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; I You're in a battle. And part of the
[58:10] battle is that he gets to talk to you.
[58:12] He gets to speak to you. You know, he's
[58:14] looking. We don't have time to go into
[58:16] this, but he's actually hunting and
[58:18] searching for the bride of Christ.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Which one are you? Are you one? Are you
[58:23] one? So, what does he do? He starts
[58:24] talking to you, seeing how you'll react.
[58:26] If you going to react in a way that's uh
[58:29] that's ungodly, he'll go, "Okay, maybe
[58:30] it's not that one. Let me go over here.
[58:32] I'm going to talk to this one." But if
[58:34] you react with the truth,
[58:37] he goes, "Oh, wait a minute.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; There's something about this one." And
[58:40] then you're targeted.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Then all the guns start getting trained
[58:45] on you.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:48] No matter how it sounds, you know, he's
[58:50] going to come to you and he's going to,
[58:51] you know, a lot of times, uh, a lot of
[58:53] times the devil, this is just basic
[58:54] preaching, so it should be real easy to
[58:56] hear. Sometimes the devil disguises his
[58:58] voice as the Lord's voice,
[59:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:02] &gt;&gt; You ever experienced that? You think
[59:04] it's maybe the Lord telling you, um, I
[59:06] feel I feel bad, Brother Danny. I always
[59:08] pick on you, but you're right there in
[59:09] that front row. you know, he'll come and
[59:11] say, "Um,
[59:14] Daniel,
[59:15] you know what you did yesterday?
[59:19] You know that thing that you did?" And
[59:21] you might be laying in bed. You might be
[59:23] trying to get peace. You might trying to
[59:24] be getting sleep. And he'll say, "You
[59:26] know,
[59:27] you know, you shouldn't have done that."
[59:30] And you think, "Lord, is that you? Lord,
[59:32] are you bringing conviction to my
[59:33] heart?" Sometimes it is the Lord.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Right.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Listen to it a little bit longer.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because see, there's no truth in
[59:40] him.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; So, he can't tell you the truth. If you
[59:44] let him talk long enough, he'll expose
[59:46] himself.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; You call yourself a Christian and then
[59:51] you did that thing.
[59:54] There's you're not a Christian. And you
[59:56] might, Daniel, you might say that's
[59:59] true. I don't feel like a Christian.
[1:00:02] You're not worthy.
[1:00:06] You're right.
[1:00:08] The Lord don't love you. Oh, wait a
[1:00:10] minute.
[1:00:12] Wait a minute. It's a lie.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; It's a lie.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; See, right there, there's no truth in
[1:00:18] him. He cannot tell you the truth.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; So, if you let him No, I'm not
[1:00:24] encouraging you to listen to the devil,
[1:00:26] but start asking him questions. So, wait
[1:00:27] a minute. Am I a son of God? No, you're
[1:00:29] not a son of God. Oh, I got you. That's
[1:00:32] not you, Lord. That's you, Satan.
[1:00:34] Because there's no truth in you. You
[1:00:36] only have lies. I may fail him every
[1:00:39] day.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; I certainly probably fail him every
[1:00:44] single day. I probably fail him. But if
[1:00:46] you tell me that he doesn't love me, I
[1:00:48] know that you're a liar, Satan. I know
[1:00:50] that you're a liar because he What kind
[1:00:54] of love? What do you describe it then
[1:00:55] when he sends his own son to die for me?
[1:00:57] What do you call that? I call that love.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; And so when he comes and he talks to
[1:01:02] you, he exposes himself. Just give him a
[1:01:05] little bit of the word. Just give him a
[1:01:08] little bit of the truth
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; and he can't stand up to this.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; You say, "I don't really know that
[1:01:13] much." You don't need to know anything.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; You just take him back to this Bible.
[1:01:18] You want me to give you? Let me just
[1:01:19] give you a few little truths you can put
[1:01:20] inside your satchel. Right?
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; These are little Sunday school
[1:01:23] scriptures. John 6:37, if you're writing
[1:01:26] it down, all that the Father has given
[1:01:29] me shall come, and he that cometh to me,
[1:01:32] I will in no wise cast out.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; He didn't talk about the condition that
[1:01:38] person was in. He didn't talk about any
[1:01:39] of those things. He said, "If they come
[1:01:41] to me, if they approach me, if they want
[1:01:44] me, I will not turn them away."
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Give that truth to the devil. See what
[1:01:48] he tells you.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:52] Verily, verily, John 6:47, verily,
[1:01:54] verily, I say unto you, he that
[1:01:56] believeth on me has everlasting life.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; If you got nothing to fall back on, you
[1:02:03] have a belt of truth to fall back on. It
[1:02:05] says, you know what? I may not be good.
[1:02:07] I may not be mistake free. I may not be
[1:02:09] where I want to be, but God, he he paid
[1:02:12] the price for me. I believe on him, and
[1:02:14] I have everlasting life.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Boo devil, you have no power here.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And this isn't just to build
[1:02:21] you up. Oh yeah, I'm going to go out and
[1:02:23] do this. This works because it's in the
[1:02:25] word.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; It's in the scriptures. It's not because
[1:02:27] some preacher told you or somebody told
[1:02:29] you. It's in the Bible.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; James 5:15. And the prayer of the faith
[1:02:37] shall save the sick, and the Lord shall
[1:02:39] raise them up. And if he had committed
[1:02:41] sins,
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; I'll raise my hand. And if he has
[1:02:46] committed sins, here's the devil. Oh,
[1:02:48] you committed a sin. No, you must not
[1:02:49] be. Oh, you must not be this. You must
[1:02:51] not be that. You must be this. If he has
[1:02:52] committed sins, they shall be forgiven
[1:02:55] him.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; He can't handle that. He's not going to
[1:02:58] tell you that.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; He's not going to come and tell you, oh,
[1:03:00] you know, if you just go make that thing
[1:03:01] right.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; He won't tell you that because there's
[1:03:04] no truth in him.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Confess your faults one to another and
[1:03:08] pray for one another that you may be
[1:03:10] healed. The effectual fervent prayer of
[1:03:12] a righteous man avaleth much. He can
[1:03:15] tell you about all the things that
[1:03:16] you've done wrong, but if you take them
[1:03:18] back to the truth,
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; he can't take that.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; You want another promise? Peter said
[1:03:24] unto them,
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; "Repent and be baptized every one of you
[1:03:30] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:03:31] remission of sins, and you shall receive
[1:03:34] the gift of the Holy Ghost."
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; I think sometimes we hear that and go,
[1:03:39] "Oh man, that sounds so good." Listen
[1:03:41] who Peter is saying that to. He's not
[1:03:43] saying that to the saints.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; He's not saying that to the perfect.
[1:03:48] He's telling the sinner, repent.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Look at the audience that Peter is
[1:03:54] preaching to. You say, "Oh, man. That's
[1:03:56] a good promise. Maybe I'll get to that
[1:03:57] place one day where that promise is for
[1:03:59] me." It's for you right now.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; I don't care if you sinned this morning,
[1:04:04] if you sinned last night, if in your
[1:04:06] mind you're sinning right now. He says,
[1:04:07] "Repent
[1:04:09] and be baptized." He's preaching to the
[1:04:12] hopeless. He's preaching to the lost.
[1:04:15] He's preaching to the weak. He's
[1:04:17] preaching to the downtrodden. And he's
[1:04:18] saying, "This is a promise. This is a
[1:04:21] truth for you."
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; And listen, if you have the Holy Ghost,
[1:04:27] this truth don't stumble you. You take
[1:04:28] it. Every time it comes, you go, "Amen.
[1:04:30] I got that. I got that.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; I got that. Thank you, Lord. I got that.
[1:04:35] This is where I was at." See, that's the
[1:04:36] thing is people that don't have the Holy
[1:04:38] Ghost, sometimes they get a little bit
[1:04:39] offended when you talk about the Holy
[1:04:41] Ghost.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; I don't know if that sounds
[1:04:44] controversial, but that's the truth.
[1:04:45] Sometimes somebody who doesn't have the
[1:04:46] Holy Ghost but thinks they do gets
[1:04:48] offended when you read about how you
[1:04:50] receive the Holy Ghost. But somebody
[1:04:51] that has it is never offended by how
[1:04:54] reading about how you get the Holy Ghost
[1:04:56] because they go, "Praise the Lord.
[1:04:58] Praise the Lord. That's what you did for
[1:04:59] me. I got to check my spirit. If what
[1:05:02] the minister is saying offends me, why
[1:05:04] am I offended by it?
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Maybe there's something inside that
[1:05:07] needs to be cut out. Maybe there's
[1:05:08] something that's offended by the word of
[1:05:10] God that just needs to get cut down a
[1:05:11] little bit.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; He wants you to be transformed. He
[1:05:15] doesn't want you to stay a sinner. He
[1:05:16] doesn't want you to stay lost. He just
[1:05:18] wants you to stay hopeless. He gives you
[1:05:20] a promise when you are those things. And
[1:05:22] it's a belt.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; He can cinch it down real tight. How
[1:05:25] what do you got to do? You got to put it
[1:05:26] on.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; It's one thing to read these scriptures
[1:05:29] and go, "Oh, that was real good." No,
[1:05:30] no. You got to put it on.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Put it on. I mean, I it Listen, it's the
[1:05:35] truth. Even if you don't understand it,
[1:05:37] I don't understand why he would save me.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; I don't even understand how he could
[1:05:42] save me. It don't matter. I'm going to
[1:05:44] put the belt on and I'm going to cinch
[1:05:46] it down as tight as I can until it
[1:05:49] becomes one with me.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; That's what you do with the belt of
[1:05:52] truth. It holds everything else
[1:05:54] together. I I've spent I'm sorry. I've
[1:05:56] spent uh 20 minutes on the belt. 25
[1:05:59] minutes. Uh we're just going to get
[1:06:02] through these. Amen. The breastplate of
[1:06:03] righteousness, what does it do? Goes
[1:06:05] right here. Guard your heart.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; It guards your heart.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Let's read. Uh if you want to note it
[1:06:12] down, Proverbs 4:23. It says, "Keep thy
[1:06:15] heart with all diligence, for out of it
[1:06:17] are the issues of life."
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Now, now, now, do you want to protect
[1:06:21] your heart? Do you want your heart
[1:06:22] protected?
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; A good good portion of people, they want
[1:06:26] their heart protected.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's going to tell you exactly how
[1:06:29] you do it. There's one thing to talk
[1:06:31] about the armor. I want to know how I
[1:06:32] put it on.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; I want to know how I I just want to know
[1:06:36] how what it is. How do I put it on?
[1:06:38] Well, you know what I'm going to do is
[1:06:39] I'm going to speak the truth even if I
[1:06:40] don't even understand it.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; And the devil might come to you and say,
[1:06:44] "What are you even talking about? It's
[1:06:46] in the word." And then watch him give
[1:06:48] you a revelation of what that truth
[1:06:50] means. But I'm going to speak it whether
[1:06:51] I realize it or not, whether I even
[1:06:53] understand it or not. I'm going to say
[1:06:54] the truth. The same thing here. This is
[1:06:56] how you'd guard your heart. There's two
[1:06:59] things. The next two verses says, "Put
[1:07:02] away from thee a forward mouth and
[1:07:04] perverse lips put far from thee." And
[1:07:06] then the second thing, "Let thine eyes
[1:07:09] look right,
[1:07:11] and let thine eyelids look straight
[1:07:13] before thee." The two ways your heart
[1:07:15] gets corrupted is what you look at.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; And what you say.
[1:07:22] Doesn't the Bible say out of the
[1:07:23] abundance of the heart the mouth
[1:07:26] speaketh.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; See, once you know who you are, if you
[1:07:33] put the belt on, you know who you are.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Even if you don't even understand how he
[1:07:38] got you there,
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; you know who you are. Lord, I'm a child
[1:07:41] of God. I I don't know how you did it,
[1:07:43] but you did it.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So once you know who you are,
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; you realize that it's not your
[1:07:50] righteousness that's protecting you.
[1:07:51] It's his righteousness.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; And if your heart is corrupted, it's
[1:07:54] because maybe maybe you put on that belt
[1:07:57] of truth, but then maybe you put on your
[1:07:58] righteousness as a heart covering, it
[1:08:00] won't work.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; And you'll you know how you know this?
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Listen to what comes out of your mouth.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; You want to know if your heart has been
[1:08:08] corrupted? If your heart has been hurt,
[1:08:10] if your heart has not been guarded,
[1:08:12] listen to what comes out of your mouth.
[1:08:13] Oh, that brother did this to me. Oh,
[1:08:16] that sister this. Oh, that person,
[1:08:17] they're no good this. Oh, you know what?
[1:08:19] And you might even use a scripture to
[1:08:20] back up what you're saying. But if what
[1:08:22] comes out of your mouth is not of God,
[1:08:25] then you can, you know, that something's
[1:08:26] been hurt inside the heart. And I think
[1:08:28] there needs to be I know, brother Dan, I
[1:08:29] think I don't know if he ended up
[1:08:31] speaking on it, but he started talking
[1:08:32] about forgiveness.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; He told me that's what he was going to
[1:08:35] speak on. You know, a lot of times our
[1:08:36] heart has been hurt, maybe even
[1:08:38] legitimately, and because we haven't
[1:08:40] forgiven, our heart's still hurt. And
[1:08:42] then from out of our mouth comes the
[1:08:43] hurt.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; And then we put on a breastplate of
[1:08:46] righteousness over the top of it. And
[1:08:47] guess what? We keep all that hurt right
[1:08:49] inside. And for years and years, we sit
[1:08:51] in a church service with the armor of
[1:08:53] God on. And out of our mouth comes hurt.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; That church did this to me. That brother
[1:08:58] did this to me. That religion did this
[1:08:59] to me. That sister did this to me. My
[1:09:01] family did this to me.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Hurt just comes out.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; There's got to be a healing in that
[1:09:06] heart. Take place.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Exactly. And and you know sometimes it's
[1:09:10] the heart is hurt by what you watch.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; So you got to watch. Listen now. The
[1:09:16] eyes are the input and the mouth is the
[1:09:18] output.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; So if you're not careful what's going
[1:09:21] into the eyes, do you want me to go into
[1:09:22] detail or you know what I'm talking
[1:09:24] about.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Be careful what you're spending time
[1:09:30] watching.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:09:32] because it corrupts this and pretty soon
[1:09:35] you'll start speaking out of this
[1:09:36] exactly what you were taking in.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; I got to say it to me, too.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; It's it's not a it's not a it's not a
[1:09:44] it's not a beating. It's it's the way
[1:09:46] that the armor of God works. And if we
[1:09:48] don't if we don't wear it like he says
[1:09:49] to wear it, it's not going to do any
[1:09:51] good.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; We're just wait. We're just, you know,
[1:09:54] at that point, we're just we're just
[1:09:56] playing dress up,
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; right? which is what's going on in a lot
[1:10:00] of churches is just playing dress up.
[1:10:03] Oh, I'm here. I'm putting on the armor
[1:10:04] of the Lord. And then you watch, now
[1:10:05] listen now. I've watched it happen. I've
[1:10:07] watched people come in and put on the
[1:10:09] armor of the Lord. And then when they go
[1:10:11] walk out the doors, they set it and they
[1:10:12] put on the side
[1:10:15] by the door. I'll get it when I come
[1:10:16] back Wednesday.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; I'll get it when I come back uh two
[1:10:21] Sundays from now. I'll get it when I
[1:10:22] come back next Easter.
[1:10:25] No, you need it
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; for when you walk out the door. I know
[1:10:28] this is so obvious, but I've seen so
[1:10:30] many people get a victory and then set
[1:10:32] the victory aside and go out the door
[1:10:34] and think they're going to be okay.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; The victory should not just be in these
[1:10:38] four walls.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; The victory needs to be out there where
[1:10:43] the battle is going on tomorrow morning,
[1:10:45] Tuesday morning, Thursday night, Friday
[1:10:48] night. That's where a victory should be
[1:10:50] happening. Amen.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; It's so obvious, but yes, so many times
[1:10:53] I've I've Daniel, I've I've been so
[1:10:55] happy to have the sword and then I just
[1:10:56] lay it down and the next time I read my
[1:10:58] Bible is when I come to church the next
[1:11:00] Wednesday
[1:11:03] and and I'll just say, "Ouch."
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; If somebody was preaching that to me, I
[1:11:07] would say, "Ouch. All right, Lord,
[1:11:09] that's me." And I go out and I expect to
[1:11:12] win a battle.
[1:11:14] How can I win it? I left my equipment at
[1:11:16] church.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; I handed my equipment to Brother Dan.
[1:11:19] Thanks for that equipment. I'll come
[1:11:20] back and pick it up next service. No,
[1:11:23] he's trying to equip you to go fight the
[1:11:25] battle.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Let's just move on. Shoes. The
[1:11:32] preparation of the gospel of peace. I
[1:11:34] told you before, peace does not mean an
[1:11:36] absent of conflict. It's confidence in
[1:11:39] God during the middle of a battle.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; And I I we could just spend a month on
[1:11:43] shoes and a month on on the breastplate
[1:11:45] of righteousness. I just got to I got to
[1:11:46] hurry. I don't want to keep you. I know
[1:11:48] where time is short. peace. U the gospel
[1:11:50] we believe in does. It allows you to
[1:11:53] have a firm a firm ground to stand on.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; It allows you to have a place, a sure
[1:12:00] hold. One of the best things you can
[1:12:01] have in a battle is a sure foothold.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Something you can just set your foot
[1:12:07] back like this, lock in, and you're
[1:12:09] ready to fight. It's it's in it's in
[1:12:12] it's in competitive sports and
[1:12:14] competitive fighting. It's in
[1:12:16] everything. You know, I wonder why they
[1:12:17] run around in bare feet when they're
[1:12:18] fighting, but it's so they can get a a a
[1:12:20] sure foothold. But we're not bare feet
[1:12:22] this morning. We have shoes of the
[1:12:24] gospel. Amen. And you're not barefoot.
[1:12:26] You're shaw with the gospel. You can
[1:12:28] move forward into the battle knowing
[1:12:30] that you have a perfect word.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; You know that you got a perfect word.
[1:12:36] And guess what? A perfect one goes
[1:12:38] before you into the battle. You want to
[1:12:41] talk about a sure foothold? I can't move
[1:12:43] forward if I'm confident in myself.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Exactly. I can I can I could talk about
[1:12:47] it and it sounds good and I could say
[1:12:49] amen, but then Monday morning am I going
[1:12:50] to walk forward? But if I come to a
[1:12:52] realization that a perfect one goes
[1:12:55] before me, well, I'm just going to
[1:12:57] follow in his footsteps
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; because I was given the shoes of the
[1:13:01] gospel of what? Peace.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Right? Amen.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Isn't it amazing? He gives you armor and
[1:13:08] the armor is called peace.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; And you know, I noticed something about
[1:13:13] the armor. is so obvious, but let's just
[1:13:15] point it out because it's so obvious.
[1:13:17] There's nothing that goes on the legs
[1:13:19] and so you can wear the armor of God and
[1:13:21] still kneel down.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Nothing keeps you from kneeling down in
[1:13:28] the armor of God. It frees up your
[1:13:30] knees. It frees up your legs. So no
[1:13:31] matter how bad it gets, that armor works
[1:13:35] right in sync with prayer.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; That's just a little side note, as as
[1:13:39] some would say that was for free. Romans
[1:13:42] 5:1, "Therefore, being justified by
[1:13:44] faith," how do you know you're
[1:13:45] justified?
[1:13:49] Belt, we covered that. If you don't know
[1:13:52] you're justified, go back to the truth.
[1:13:54] Search out the truth. Find out, "Oh, I
[1:13:56] was justified." Cinch that belt down a
[1:13:58] little bit tighter. It got a little bit
[1:14:00] loose. Cinch it down a little bit
[1:14:01] tighter. Therefore, being justified by
[1:14:04] faith. I'll just say it like this.
[1:14:05] Therefore, having the belt on, we have
[1:14:08] peace with God through our Lord Jesus
[1:14:10] Christ, by whom also we have access by
[1:14:12] faith into this grace wherein we stand
[1:14:15] and rejoice in hope. I love this
[1:14:18] scripture. Romans 5:3, it says, "And not
[1:14:20] only so, but we glory in tribulations."
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; As a child of God,
[1:14:28] do you want to glory in rest and
[1:14:30] relaxation, or do you want to glory in
[1:14:32] battle? And it's such the opposite
[1:14:34] mentality sometimes that is talked about
[1:14:36] that that I certainly sometimes want for
[1:14:38] myself. I just want a little bit of
[1:14:40] peace. I think there's a saying I I
[1:14:42] think even brother Brandham referenced
[1:14:43] this. There's a saying uh I don't
[1:14:45] remember who said it, the general, but
[1:14:46] he says if you want if you want peace,
[1:14:48] prepare for war.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; It's powerful.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; We glory in tribulations knowing that
[1:14:58] tribulations workketh patience. A son
[1:15:00] and daughter of God, when they're fully
[1:15:03] equipped with the with the armor of God,
[1:15:06] look for the battle,
[1:15:09] not run from the battle.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; If you're running from the battle, check
[1:15:13] the shoes.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Maybe they're not the gospel of peace.
[1:15:16] Maybe you put on your own shoes.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Those shoes run away from the battle.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Am I saying to go out and get in a fight
[1:15:22] with every single person that that
[1:15:24] disagrees with you? That's not what I'm
[1:15:25] saying.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; But there's a spirit that you battle the
[1:15:29] moment you step out. I mean, we might be
[1:15:30] battling it right now.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Right now. I don't know about what he's
[1:15:34] saying. Oh, I don't know about that. Oh,
[1:15:35] you know, that guy just did that thing
[1:15:37] to me, though. He doesn't understand
[1:15:38] what that person did to me.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; But, but the Lord does understand.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, he does.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; And let me Can I tell you something that
[1:15:45] should just be so humbling and sobering?
[1:15:47] The Lord understands because you did it
[1:15:49] to him.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; I did it to him.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; That wrong that was you were wronged
[1:15:55] with, you wronged the Lord with that
[1:15:57] wrong at some point. And you know what
[1:15:59] he did?
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; I don't even see it.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; I don't even see it. You know, if when
[1:16:06] you make something right that repent and
[1:16:08] be baptized, the Lord doesn't have to
[1:16:10] step over that every time you you walk
[1:16:12] in. You know, Brother Aaron, if I offend
[1:16:14] you and you and I say I'm sorry and you
[1:16:16] forgive me, you know, Brother Aaron
[1:16:18] might have to he might have to step over
[1:16:20] that thing a little bit every time he
[1:16:21] sees me,
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; right? Because we're human beings. The
[1:16:24] Lord doesn't have to do that.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; It's gone. He has that ability. I just
[1:16:28] need to keep moving. You forgive me. I
[1:16:29] got a few minutes here.
[1:16:33] Man, I would want to spend so much time
[1:16:34] in these. I just can't. Shield of faith.
[1:16:38] Uh
[1:16:40] just that those shoes though, you know,
[1:16:43] even David at 16, 17 years old did not
[1:16:47] stand there when he was fighting
[1:16:49] Goliath. Little kids in Sunday school
[1:16:50] know this one. They could probably teach
[1:16:51] you a thing or two, teach me a thing or
[1:16:53] two. He ran
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; towards Goliath.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; He ran towards him.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; And he didn't have the physical armor of
[1:17:00] Saul. He had the Lord's armor with him.
[1:17:02] Amen.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; But if you're relying on yourself,
[1:17:06] I know what direction you'll run.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; I know what direction I run when I'm
[1:17:10] relying on myself. Shield of faith.
[1:17:12] Faith uh is not just a weapon.
[1:17:18] It's a defense.
[1:17:23] It's a defense.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; And when you join the ranks of God's
[1:17:30] army, you better have a good defense.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; In fact, the Bible says in this
[1:17:34] scripture,
[1:17:36] um I don't know exactly how it it said
[1:17:38] it in Eph.
[1:17:40] It says um
[1:17:44] above all,
[1:17:47] when the Bible says above all, the
[1:17:49] antenna should go up.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Okay. What is it about to tell me? Above
[1:17:52] all, get that shield of faith.
[1:17:57] Every every single when you declare,
[1:18:01] "Lord, I'm going to live for you.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Lord, I accept what you did for me."
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Every single gun is now trained upon
[1:18:09] you.
[1:18:10] Amen.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Every single one. You think that you're
[1:18:12] not going to take shots, you're going to
[1:18:14] take shots.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; And you need a shield. And the shield is
[1:18:18] the shield is able to deflect every
[1:18:22] single shot that the enemy But but you
[1:18:25] know what? You have to learn how to
[1:18:26] wield it.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; You have to learn how to wield it. There
[1:18:29] might be some times where you're going
[1:18:30] to take some blows because you just
[1:18:31] don't know how to wield the shield yet.
[1:18:33] But keep doing it. Keep doing it.
[1:18:37] Uh there's something that's just so
[1:18:40] striking that even though you're in a
[1:18:41] battle and you're in the greatest battle
[1:18:43] you'll ever be in, greater is he that is
[1:18:46] in you than he that is in the world. So
[1:18:49] if I start to get confidence in my
[1:18:51] ability to wield this, I am I'm lost.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; To learn how to use a shield is to learn
[1:18:57] how to surrender your your shield arm
[1:18:59] over to the Lord and watch him deflect
[1:19:02] things you didn't even know were coming.
[1:19:04] And and you know the devil again, he'll
[1:19:06] come to you. Oh, you you can't have
[1:19:08] that. You're too weak. Raise that shield
[1:19:10] up.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, you can't have that Holy Ghost that
[1:19:13] that minister was talking about. You
[1:19:14] know what you've done in your life?
[1:19:15] Raise that shield up. You know what that
[1:19:16] is? That's a fiery dart.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; And he's got a lot of fiery darts. And
[1:19:20] and and I love that the Bible says this,
[1:19:22] you quench the fiery darts of the devil.
[1:19:26] Just just follow me on this one. This
[1:19:27] might be a stretch, but I just like
[1:19:29] this. Okay. You know that on this side
[1:19:30] over here when you do something and the
[1:19:33] Holy Spirit is not pleased, you know, it
[1:19:35] calls it you can quench the spirit.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; When you do something that doesn't
[1:19:39] please the Lord, doesn't please the
[1:19:40] spirit. I think maybe we've all been
[1:19:42] guilty of it. You quench the spirit
[1:19:44] maybe of a service or maybe some
[1:19:46] person's testimony, you quench it. But I
[1:19:48] love that over here on this side, when
[1:19:50] you do something against the devil, you
[1:19:52] actually quench him.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; You can actually quench the devil. You
[1:19:57] can quench the fiery darts of the devil.
[1:19:58] You know what that means? Every time
[1:20:01] that shield of faith deflects one of his
[1:20:04] attacks on you, he gets a little bit
[1:20:06] more discouraged to attack you again
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; because his spirit gets quenched. I know
[1:20:12] we never think of the devil that way. We
[1:20:14] always think he's just like this mighty,
[1:20:16] strong, relentless attacker. You know,
[1:20:18] he gets depressed because depression
[1:20:21] comes from him. You know, he gets
[1:20:23] anxiety because anxiety comes from him.
[1:20:26] He gets down in the dumps. He gets in
[1:20:29] despair because those things come from
[1:20:31] him. And he even gets discouraged.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; When he sees somebody who has no
[1:20:37] business being able to withstand his
[1:20:39] attacks, all of a sudden withstanding
[1:20:41] his attacks, not because they're good
[1:20:43] with the shield, because they started to
[1:20:45] surrender that shield arm to the Lord.
[1:20:47] Don't even know what they're doing
[1:20:49] sometimes. And he attacks them. I'm
[1:20:50] going to get them with this one. I This
[1:20:52] one has worked their whole life. Every
[1:20:55] time I bring up this little thing that
[1:20:57] they've done or this problem that they
[1:20:58] have or this little addiction they have,
[1:21:00] every time I bring it up, I get a
[1:21:01] victory over them. And then he brings it
[1:21:03] up one day and it bounces back and it's
[1:21:06] quenched.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, wait a minute. Okay. I must I must
[1:21:09] have thrown that attack a little bit
[1:21:10] wrong. Let me throw that attack again
[1:21:12] one more time. You're no good because
[1:21:14] this boom. And it's quenched again. What
[1:21:16] is he going to do? He realizes that
[1:21:18] where he had a foothold in your life,
[1:21:21] where he had a he had an anchor in your
[1:21:24] life. Listen to me now. Where he had an
[1:21:26] anchor in your life, whenever it might
[1:21:28] be, he doesn't have that anchor anymore.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; And he gets discouraged.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; When he doesn't have an anchor in your
[1:21:36] life anymore.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; His spirit gets quenched
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; by the shield of faith.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; You ever think about that? That you're
[1:21:45] not just facing this relentless foe.
[1:21:47] You're facing somebody that when you get
[1:21:49] a little victory, he walks back home
[1:21:52] like this.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. and has to go prepare a
[1:21:55] new attack on you. I'm going to try
[1:21:56] something else that's going to work
[1:21:58] because that sure don't work anymore.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; I tried bringing up the alcohol. It just
[1:22:02] doesn't work anymore.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; I tried bringing up the cigarettes. Oh,
[1:22:06] it doesn't work. It worked for 40 years.
[1:22:08] It worked, but it doesn't work anymore.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; I better try a new plan of attack.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; You think, oh, it's just a little
[1:22:14] scripture. There's so much in one
[1:22:16] scripture that says the shield quenches
[1:22:19] the fiery darts of the devil.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:22] You see a brother in church. How about
[1:22:24] this? A brother, a sister. This is
[1:22:26] what's beautiful about the shield. It's
[1:22:27] not attached to you. So, I see a brother
[1:22:30] or sister in the church that is fighting
[1:22:32] a battle and they're getting beat.
[1:22:35] I see him down on one knee. I see him
[1:22:37] getting beat by the devil. You know, you
[1:22:38] can go over with that shield and you can
[1:22:40] protect somebody else with it, too.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; But, you know what the devil would love
[1:22:44] to have you do is to point out their
[1:22:47] faults.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Exactly. He would love to have you go,
[1:22:50] "Oh, you see so and so again, they just
[1:22:52] can't keep away from that thing." Out of
[1:22:54] the mouth comes what's in the heart.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; If I see somebody down, if I see
[1:23:00] somebody struggling and I start talking
[1:23:03] about them, I can tell you this. I don't
[1:23:05] have the breastplate of righteousness
[1:23:06] on.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, I've been going to church for I
[1:23:08] don't know how many years. I tell you
[1:23:09] what, you don't have the breastplate of
[1:23:10] righteousness on because out of your
[1:23:11] mouth is coming what's in your heart
[1:23:13] after you see somebody who's struggling.
[1:23:16] But instead, what we should be doing,
[1:23:18] it's so basic. It's so basic. This
[1:23:19] isn't, this isn't complicated, but do we
[1:23:22] do it? Do I go over and put my shield
[1:23:24] down in front of him and say, "Look, I'm
[1:23:25] going to pick you up. Let's pray
[1:23:26] together. You're on a knee. I'm on a
[1:23:27] knee. I got you. I got you right now
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; because I I rest assured,
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; you're going to need somebody to cover
[1:23:33] you at some point."
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Rest assured, you're going to take a
[1:23:36] blow that might almost kill you.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; It might almost kill you and you're not
[1:23:41] going to be able to hold that shield up
[1:23:43] and someone else is going to come over
[1:23:44] and say, "I got you. I got you.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; I got you. We're in the same army
[1:23:48] together. I got you. And that's another
[1:23:51] thing is that we're not in an army by
[1:23:53] oursel. That's a depressing thought.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; One person out on the field. Although I
[1:23:58] know the Lord could give him a battle,
[1:23:59] but he always had even just a few.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Somebody to watch your back. Somebody
[1:24:05] that whose back you could watch their
[1:24:07] side you could protect. He always has a
[1:24:09] few that he has. Amen.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; You forgive me. I'm I'm I'm I'm I've
[1:24:15] been 45 minutes. I'm trying to hurry.
[1:24:19] Raise that shield up.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Cover him in prayer. See, the armor
[1:24:25] doesn't prevent you from going to
[1:24:27] prayer.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's your spouse. Maybe it's your
[1:24:31] child. Maybe it's your parents. I don't
[1:24:33] care who it is. Cover them in prayer.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Helmet of salvation. Oh, I just we're
[1:24:38] just I wish we could take so much time
[1:24:39] with these. Helmet of salvation. you
[1:24:41] know who you are and what God has done
[1:24:44] for you.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; It's called the helmet of salvation.
[1:24:46] There's even a place in the Bible.
[1:24:50] I I I'll find the scripture. There's a
[1:24:51] place in the Bible where Jesus himself
[1:24:53] says he put on the helmet of salvation.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Why would Jesus need it? Because he
[1:24:57] knows who he is.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; See, it's a helmet of salvation. Uh
[1:25:02] Philippians 2:12 says, "Work out your
[1:25:05] own salvation with fear and trembling."
[1:25:07] Be very sure. I think I was even talking
[1:25:09] about this last time. Be very sure that
[1:25:11] your own you have your own experience
[1:25:13] with the Lord.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; You can't put that helmet on if you're
[1:25:17] unsure of your experience of the Lord.
[1:25:19] If you're unsure, go back to him and
[1:25:20] said, "Lord, I need to be sure."
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; I need to be sure that it wasn't just an
[1:25:26] emotion. It wasn't just a sensation. It
[1:25:28] wasn't just a great service. It wasn't
[1:25:30] just a prayer line. I need to be sure.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; That I died and that you came to live
[1:25:36] inside of me. I need to be sure cuz when
[1:25:38] you're sure that helmet goes on and then
[1:25:41] it guards your thoughts against fear,
[1:25:43] against worry, against anxiety. And I
[1:25:45] told you most people have these things
[1:25:47] because they don't know who they are.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; That's just the truth. Most people have
[1:25:52] an anxiety problem or a fear problem
[1:25:54] because they're not sure of their
[1:25:56] salvation.
[1:26:00] And so there's a worry there, even if
[1:26:01] they don't know what it is. And it leads
[1:26:03] to
[1:26:05] worry about all these other things. But
[1:26:07] if you trace it back,
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; if you trace well, you know, I I and and
[1:26:11] it's hey, don't anxiety is a real thing.
[1:26:14] It's not imagined.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; But sometimes my wife would give a
[1:26:18] testimony this sometimes it's it's an
[1:26:20] anxiety over getting on a plane.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; You think I I'm afraid to travel on a
[1:26:25] plane. Okay. But trace back, trace the
[1:26:28] anxiety back and find out if there's not
[1:26:31] a root problem that needs to be taken
[1:26:33] care of.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; There's a thought that gets in and all
[1:26:36] of a sudden because the mind's not
[1:26:38] guarded, a thought gets in and all of a
[1:26:40] sudden it leads to fear. It leads to
[1:26:42] worry. And sometimes you're afraid. Have
[1:26:44] you ever had this happen? You're afraid
[1:26:45] and you don't even know what it is
[1:26:46] you're afraid of,
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; but you just feel fear.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; I don't know, might only be a couple of
[1:26:54] us that have that. I just sometimes
[1:26:56] you're just afraid. You don't even know
[1:26:57] what you're afraid about.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Trace it back and see if there's not a
[1:27:00] thought there.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; They're not sure of their salvation. If
[1:27:04] you're sure of who you are and you're
[1:27:06] sure that your old self was crucified
[1:27:09] with Christ, then you're sure that you
[1:27:11] no longer live, but he lives in you.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; I I'm trying to close. Why I just I I
[1:27:19] just want to keep going, but like why
[1:27:20] are we why are we even in church? Why do
[1:27:22] we come to church? It's a question many
[1:27:24] people ask. Why do we come? This is the
[1:27:27] headquarters.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Everybody get that? This is the
[1:27:31] headquarters of the army of the Lord.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; This is the camp. This is where you come
[1:27:36] and you replenish the ammunition. This
[1:27:38] is where you come and you and you know
[1:27:40] what? Sometimes sometimes it's happened
[1:27:42] many times to me. Sometimes you got that
[1:27:44] shield, one of those darts makes it over
[1:27:46] the top of the shield. It's even it's
[1:27:47] even in the word. I I read it. Sometimes
[1:27:49] one of those darts make it over the top
[1:27:50] of the shield and you get hit and you
[1:27:52] get wounded.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Guess what? You come back to the camp.
[1:27:55] You know what the devil would love? You
[1:27:57] know what he loves? When you go do
[1:27:59] something wrong and because you do
[1:28:01] something wrong, you stay away from
[1:28:02] church.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; I I I don't even know you. I know that's
[1:28:06] the truth.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; I know that's the truth. If if there not
[1:28:09] one person said amen, I know that's the
[1:28:10] truth. When you do something wrong, he
[1:28:12] tells you, well, you can't go back there
[1:28:14] because you did something wrong. What
[1:28:15] are people going to think about you?
[1:28:17] What the Lord's going to think about
[1:28:18] you? What are you going to do this?
[1:28:19] You're going to walk in. You have all
[1:28:20] these thoughts. Why? That's fear. That's
[1:28:22] the devil wanted to keep you away from
[1:28:24] the camp where the medicine is at, where
[1:28:26] the doctor is at, where the healing is
[1:28:28] at,
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; where somebody else might be able to
[1:28:31] come up and put a shield over you, lay
[1:28:33] their hands on you, and you will
[1:28:34] recover. He wants to keep you away from
[1:28:36] that. He'd love for you to stay out in
[1:28:39] battle and not have a headquarters to
[1:28:41] come back to.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Now, do I believe that we should all
[1:28:43] just stay in the headquarters all the
[1:28:45] time? No. We come to church. We rally
[1:28:48] together. We come to have a worship. We
[1:28:50] come to to to give praise to the Lord
[1:28:52] and prepare to go back out into battle.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I come here and and and I'm
[1:29:01] sure you get this from Brother Dan and
[1:29:02] you learn some new tactics on how to
[1:29:04] fight the devil, some new strategy,
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; some teaching of the word of God. You
[1:29:09] know, here's another way you can defeat
[1:29:11] Oh, really? I didn't That's my timer
[1:29:13] going off. All right.
[1:29:15] I said it 10 minutes early. I have been
[1:29:17] 50 minutes. Can you give me five
[1:29:18] minutes?
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; It may be a little bit of grace on that
[1:29:22] five minutes. Like brother like brother
[1:29:24] Gerald Hughes used to say, who will give
[1:29:25] me five minutes?
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; 5 10 15 20 25. All right. I don't I'm
[1:29:31] just I'm just joking. I don't need that
[1:29:33] much time. But there there's a doctor in
[1:29:36] the camp.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; There's a doctor in the camp.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; G to God.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; There's a healer in the camp.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; We come together and we rally together.
[1:29:45] Sometimes you're out in a battle. Think
[1:29:47] about this. I just picture I picture
[1:29:49] soldiers out in the battle and they're
[1:29:52] fighting and maybe somebody falls off
[1:29:53] and they and they drop and they're like,
[1:29:55] who else died?
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Who else got who else was injured? And
[1:30:00] then you come back to the camp. Oh,
[1:30:02] Daniel's still here. Praise the Lord.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother so and so. Oh, they're still
[1:30:07] alive. Praise the Lord. You know what it
[1:30:09] does? It starts to encourage you.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, they're still surviving. Oh, after
[1:30:14] after the battle they went through.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; After all they went through, they're
[1:30:17] still here. Oh, praise the Lord. Oh, I
[1:30:19] can go back out and fight again. I can
[1:30:21] go if they can fight. If Caleb at 85
[1:30:24] years old can fight, oh man, what can he
[1:30:26] do with me?
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; What could he do with me? And it
[1:30:28] encourages you to see somebody else, you
[1:30:30] know, there's nothing worse. There is
[1:30:32] nothing worse than bright, polished,
[1:30:35] shiny armor.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; I don't want to see I don't want to see
[1:30:39] anybody with shiny armor unless you're a
[1:30:41] new recruit. When you first come to the
[1:30:44] Lord, your armor is going to be
[1:30:45] polished. It's going to be new. It's
[1:30:46] going to be shiny. But when I watch
[1:30:48] somebody come into the church who's got
[1:30:50] some scars on the breastplate,
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; he's got some scars on the sword.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; I want you to be able, listen, I want
[1:30:58] you to be able to pull out your own
[1:30:59] sword, Daniel, and go, see this little
[1:31:01] See this chip in my sword right here?
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; That's where I slew this one devil.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Who's got a sword like that? You see
[1:31:09] this chip in my sword? That's where I
[1:31:11] took over that old alcohol devil that
[1:31:13] was after me. That right there. Oh, I
[1:31:14] took him down. See this other chip? This
[1:31:16] little slice out of my sword? That's
[1:31:18] that pornography devil that I took I
[1:31:20] took him down with the sword. See this
[1:31:22] other chip over here? That's that that's
[1:31:24] that nicotine devil that I took down
[1:31:26] right there.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; How about this other little chip? Oh,
[1:31:29] the backside. Oh, when was that? Oh,
[1:31:31] that was maybe that was a long time ago.
[1:31:33] Oh, that I remember that devil. He was a
[1:31:35] devil of gossip.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; All devils. And that sword needs to be
[1:31:41] taken to them. I want listen. I want to
[1:31:44] follow
[1:31:45] I want to follow a general who's got
[1:31:48] scarred armor on.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Some general walks out and says, "Uh,
[1:31:54] everybody follow me." And they got
[1:31:55] polished shiny armor on thinking, "Where
[1:31:57] are you going? Where you been?
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; I think you've been in the camp.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; I think you've been staying in the tent.
[1:32:03] You haven't been where I've been. That
[1:32:05] armor better have mud on it. It better
[1:32:06] have some dirt on it. It better have
[1:32:08] some blood on it. Amen.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, what are we doing? Are just
[1:32:12] dressing in armor to be seen? To parade
[1:32:14] around? There's so many churches just
[1:32:16] parade around. Look at what we believe.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, look at what we believe.
[1:32:21] Shiny armor on. You ain't been in a
[1:32:23] battle yet.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; You ain't been in a battle. You ain't
[1:32:26] been in the battle. I've been. I feel
[1:32:28] like I'm missing an arm sometimes when
[1:32:30] I'm coming to church,
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; honestly.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you what my general wears.
[1:32:36] My general wears armor that's got scars
[1:32:39] in the hands.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; That's who That's who my general That's
[1:32:43] who my general is. If I look at the back
[1:32:46] of his armor, it's got stripes
[1:32:49] on the back of the armor.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; You think Jesus is walking around just
[1:32:56] You think he just went to the cross and
[1:32:57] was bean for no reason and he says, "No,
[1:32:59] I've been in battles. Look at these
[1:33:01] stripes.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; They were for you. Look at these nails.
[1:33:05] They were for you. Look at these beat
[1:33:07] marks. They were for you. Look at these
[1:33:08] scars around my forehead from thorns.
[1:33:10] Those are for you.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; That's a general I want to get behind.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; That's a general that leads you into
[1:33:19] battle. And you know, I'm telling you,
[1:33:21] think about it. In the natural, if you
[1:33:23] were to have to join the army and you
[1:33:25] got one of those generals in front of
[1:33:27] you, you're like, "Oh, we're going to
[1:33:28] win.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; We're going to win. Look at this guy."
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Exactly.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Look at this guy. Look at the faith
[1:33:36] muscles on this general.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; And he's not some new recruit. Look at
[1:33:40] the battles. He I'm getting behind that
[1:33:42] guy right there.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; And that's Jesus Christ going before us.
[1:33:46] Then why do I have fear? Why do I have
[1:33:48] worry when that general goes before me
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; and has already surveyed the field,
[1:33:55] actually already marched out there
[1:33:57] before the foundation of the world and
[1:33:58] defeated the enemy.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; He just came back to get you.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. He just came back to get you to
[1:34:04] take him take you with him. Why put on
[1:34:07] the armor if we're not going to fight?
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; If if so, all this preaching, all this
[1:34:12] talking, all the church going is just a
[1:34:14] waste of time. Why put on the armor if
[1:34:16] we're not going to go fight?
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; And why go fight if I haven't put the
[1:34:20] armor on?
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Why stand when I haven't done all there
[1:34:27] is to stand?
[1:34:32] O, I got a whole another page. Nope. I
[1:34:34] better stay away from that.
[1:34:37] Is your armor a little bit loose?
[1:34:40] You find sometimes you're a little bit
[1:34:41] loose, a little bit lacking. Sometimes
[1:34:44] slacking in your prayer life, slacking
[1:34:45] in your
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I found myself slacking in my
[1:34:49] prayer life, slacking in my Bible time.
[1:34:51] You know what you need to do? Grab that
[1:34:53] belt.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Cinch it down. Because sometimes in
[1:34:57] battle, I'm talking to I'm talking to
[1:34:59] veterans now.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Sometimes in battle, the belt gets a
[1:35:02] little bit loose.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; It gets a little bit loose. It's nothing
[1:35:05] to be ashamed about. It means you were
[1:35:06] out battling.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Grab that belt. Cinch it down. Oh Lord,
[1:35:11] you know what? You're right. Lord, I
[1:35:12] haven't made time. But in your promise
[1:35:13] says if I repent, this is what I'm going
[1:35:15] to get. So Lord, you won't you won't
[1:35:17] turn me away. I'm just going to cinch
[1:35:18] that down a little bit. Maybe maybe the
[1:35:20] maybe the uniform's getting a little bit
[1:35:22] loose. Maybe the faith muscles haven't
[1:35:23] worked out. Can I tell you something
[1:35:24] that you probably already know? faith.
[1:35:26] Do not store up faith for a big battle.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm telling you?
[1:35:33] Don't store up faith for this big
[1:35:35] battle. Use faith every single day for
[1:35:39] every single thing because faith is a
[1:35:40] muscle.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; You think about how crazy I know I've
[1:35:45] gone over my time. Will you forgive me?
[1:35:47] I'm not doing this because brother Dan's
[1:35:49] not here. I think he would give me an
[1:35:50] extra five minutes.
[1:35:52] Maybe not. But if this is the last time
[1:35:55] I talked to you, give me an extra 5
[1:35:56] minutes. All right? And then you won't
[1:35:57] have to hear another 50. But sometimes
[1:36:01] we're think about how silly it would be
[1:36:03] for some bodybuilding competition or
[1:36:04] weightlifting competition and the
[1:36:06] weightlifter says, "I'm not going to
[1:36:07] lift any weights for a couple months.
[1:36:08] I'm going to save it all up for the
[1:36:09] competition.
[1:36:11] He's going to go out to the thing and
[1:36:12] not be able to lift any weights." You
[1:36:14] need to exercise your faith. And I'll
[1:36:17] tell you, if you want to know if you
[1:36:18] have the armor of God, start having
[1:36:19] faith for every single little thing that
[1:36:21] happens in your life. every day. Not
[1:36:23] just the big battles. No, no, no, no.
[1:36:25] The small battles, too. Oh, well, you
[1:36:27] know, uh my my son son came to me and
[1:36:30] says, "Oh, they're giving him a
[1:36:31] difficult time at work." Praise the
[1:36:32] Lord, son. Let's just sit down and have
[1:36:33] a prayer about that.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Well, it's just a little job. I mean,
[1:36:37] it's not that big a deal. No, no, no.
[1:36:38] Let's start working out the faith muscle
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; because then when the big challenge
[1:36:42] comes around, you'll swing that sword
[1:36:45] and you're like, I didn't even know I
[1:36:46] was that powerful.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; I didn't even know that I could I could
[1:36:49] cleave off the head of a devil like
[1:36:51] that. Amen.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; But it's that little daily exercise of
[1:36:54] the faith, that little oh that little
[1:36:57] five minutes in your scripture that 5
[1:36:59] minutes becomes 10 minutes. That 10
[1:37:01] minutes becomes 20 minutes. That 20
[1:37:03] minutes becomes an hour and then an hour
[1:37:04] is not even enough.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Start exercising. Oh, you know what I'm
[1:37:08] going to start with? Here's what we do.
[1:37:10] Here's what we do. I'm going to start
[1:37:11] I've got I've done no praying for a
[1:37:14] year. I'm going to start off with an
[1:37:15] hour a day.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Anybody?
[1:37:20] And how many days did it last?
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Uh, one, two. Right. The second day it
[1:37:26] was like, I'm running running late for
[1:37:27] work. I 45 minutes is still pretty good.
[1:37:29] Start with five minutes.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; And watch five minutes not be enough.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; A little workout. Don't go and pick up
[1:37:38] 500 lb if you haven't lifted weights,
[1:37:41] but go pick up a weight.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Watch that uniform.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Watch the armor of the Lord start to
[1:37:47] fill out. I I You know what? I I just
[1:37:49] got to stop. I've said it.
[1:37:54] I just want to know what does your armor
[1:37:55] look like? Have you got it on?
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't doubt whether you have it
[1:38:01] on or not. If you don't, it's right
[1:38:04] here.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Everything you need for that armor is
[1:38:07] right here. Go study it. What? Lord,
[1:38:09] what is it? What is it to tell the
[1:38:10] truth?
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Lord, what is it to guard my heart?
[1:38:13] Lord, what is it to guard my mind? Lord,
[1:38:16] what is it to stand
[1:38:19] when everything else says to run?
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Go read in this Bible. This will give
[1:38:24] you the answer. Put on that armor. And
[1:38:26] then what does your armor look like? Is
[1:38:28] it shiny?
[1:38:31] Is it clean?
[1:38:33] Or is it scarred?
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; But every scar is a victory.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Every scar is a testimony. You can come
[1:38:42] and go, "Oh, right here. say, "See this
[1:38:44] big chunk out of my armor? That's when
[1:38:47] you tried to kill me and you couldn't do
[1:38:49] it.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; You couldn't take my life." And right
[1:38:53] here is a testimony of how the Lord
[1:38:54] defeated you right here on my armor. I
[1:38:56] wear it. I wear my testimony.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; And if you come at me, I got the sword.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; How many wants to be that kind of
[1:39:06] soldier?
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; I want to be that kind of s I just don't
[1:39:09] want to say it. I'm so tired of just me
[1:39:12] just saying I want to do something. I
[1:39:14] want to be that soldier. And you know
[1:39:16] what? How many in here truly from your
[1:39:19] heart? How many in here want to serve
[1:39:22] the Lord?
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; I love it. Then guess what? You got a
[1:39:27] battle coming.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; You do not have to go looking for it.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; You do not have to search it out.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; It's coming.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; It will come this afternoon at
[1:39:37] lunchtime, maybe.
[1:39:40] You know the devil don't even wait for
[1:39:41] Monday morning. Sometimes this afternoon
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; use the sword.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Even if you use it poorly,
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; the faith of the weakest Christian.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Sends the devil running.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Because he has no defense against it.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Let's let's just uh stand to our feet,
[1:40:03] bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord,
[1:40:05] you just you forgive me, Lord, for the
[1:40:07] time taken, Lord. And for if I've just
[1:40:10] extended this out, Lord, too long. You,
[1:40:12] Lord, you just find some grace in your
[1:40:14] sight, Lord. I It's just a Lord, a
[1:40:17] message that we It just doesn't do it
[1:40:19] justice, Lord, to talk about your word
[1:40:22] in such a short time, Lord. But if it
[1:40:24] just sparks, Lord, if it just sparks a
[1:40:27] little thing in someone's life and they
[1:40:29] go, I'm going to go find out more about
[1:40:30] that armor for myself, Lord. Then Lord,
[1:40:33] may a mission be accomplished today,
[1:40:35] Lord. And Lord, may we not be afraid,
[1:40:37] Lord, to go out in battle. And Lord,
[1:40:39] know that there is a camp. There is a
[1:40:42] headquarters where there's food, there's
[1:40:44] supply, there's medicine, Lord, there's
[1:40:46] training so that we can not, Lord, stay
[1:40:49] in the camp so we can go back out and
[1:40:51] fight for you, Lord. And Lord, all this
[1:40:54] isn't a battle, Lord, that you've
[1:40:55] already won. But it's an exercise, Lord,
[1:40:58] of our faith. It's an exercise of our
[1:41:00] patience, Lord. That tribulation, Lord,
[1:41:02] that we glory in works patience, Father.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; And you know what we need. You know, a
[1:41:08] character change that we have to have,
[1:41:10] Lord. That only a conflict will bring
[1:41:12] on, Lord. And I pray that you would just
[1:41:15] grow everyone here into, Lord, that
[1:41:18] armor that you have for them, Lord. Just
[1:41:20] take this broken up, just rushed
[1:41:23] message, Lord. But, Lord, there's some
[1:41:25] there's some truth. There's truth in
[1:41:27] there, Lord. That Lord, that we cannot
[1:41:30] we cannot lose
[1:41:32] because you've gone before us, Lord. You
[1:41:34] are that great general, Lord.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Lord, and I believe the word says, Lord,
[1:41:40] that when we put on that armor
[1:41:43] that's inside, then it's actually you
[1:41:46] inside of us, Lord.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; And if you're inside us, Lord, then you,
[1:41:50] Lord, are fighting the battle through
[1:41:52] us, Father. That Lord, you wear us into
[1:41:54] battle, Father. that you, Lord, walk
[1:41:57] forward with our feet and our hands,
[1:41:59] Lord, and our eyes and our heart, Lord,
[1:42:01] into battle, but you're the source of
[1:42:02] strength behind it, Lord. And I pray
[1:42:05] that we would just recognize that, Lord,
[1:42:07] that that it's not that that battles are
[1:42:10] not a bad sign, that they are necessary,
[1:42:12] Lord, and that you, Lord, have equipped
[1:42:14] us to handle them. Father,
[1:42:17] if we failed you, Lord, bring us to that
[1:42:19] place of repentance, Lord. We don't we
[1:42:21] don't want to be, Lord, deficient in
[1:42:24] your sight, Lord. We don't want to be
[1:42:25] holding back, Father. I know I don't. I
[1:42:27] believe there's every hand in here that
[1:42:29] would raise right now, Lord, with eyes
[1:42:31] closed. I believe there's a heart at the
[1:42:32] end of every hand, Lord, that says,
[1:42:34] "Lord, I've failed you. I've messed up.
[1:42:37] Maybe even today, Lord. Maybe even
[1:42:38] yesterday. I've I've just gone so wrong,
[1:42:40] but Lord, would you forgive me? Don't
[1:42:43] cast me out, Lord. I want you. I want
[1:42:45] your armor. I want your word. I want
[1:42:47] victory in my life. I want overcoming
[1:42:49] for me, for my family,
[1:42:52] Lord, for my church, for my community,
[1:42:54] for my own soul. Lord, I want you more.
[1:42:56] I believe that you see every hand
[1:42:58] raised, Lord. I see I know that you do,
[1:43:00] Father. You compel us, Lord, to defy the
[1:43:02] laws of gravity, Lord, and raise our
[1:43:04] hand up. It's not just, Lord, a a
[1:43:07] physical motion, Lord. It's a
[1:43:08] surrendering. And I pray to you, Lord,
[1:43:10] that behind the heart of every hand,
[1:43:12] Father, you would come in right now. And
[1:43:14] that you would strengthen that life,
[1:43:15] Lord, with the armor of God. That Lord,
[1:43:18] you would just have a breakthrough in
[1:43:19] that life at this moment, Father, that
[1:43:21] they would recognize who they are, Lord.
[1:43:24] That there's a truth that no matter what
[1:43:26] the devil says, he has no truth in his
[1:43:28] lie. That he can't touch this word of
[1:43:31] God. And this word of God declares who I
[1:43:33] am. I am a child of God. I am a child of
[1:43:36] thee, King. And there's no devil that
[1:43:39] can stand before me.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Though I fall many times, Lord, I'll get
[1:43:45] back up.
[1:43:50] Take a word, Lord, and just
[1:43:53] plant it deep down in the heart. Now,
[1:43:57] may everyone here, Lord, be so hungry to
[1:43:59] know what that armor is that they go and
[1:44:02] seek it out, Lord. if they have it,
[1:44:04] Lord, that maybe they have that armor
[1:44:05] that they Lord, seek out a way to just
[1:44:08] tighten it up, Lord, just to just cinch
[1:44:10] it a little bit stronger. Make sure it's
[1:44:12] in place. Make sure that that shield
[1:44:14] hand is strong. Make sure that sword is
[1:44:16] wielded.
[1:44:19] Lord, you have it in your word for a
[1:44:20] reason, Lord. It's not just a good
[1:44:22] story. It's not just a good book. Lord,
[1:44:24] this is life.
[1:44:27] It's the only way to life. Father,
[1:44:31] we love and thank you for the word and
[1:44:33] just enjoy your presence, Lord, in Jesus
[1:44:36] name.
[1:44:38] Amen.
[1:44:42] All my words fall short.
[1:44:47] I've got nothing new.
[1:44:53] How could I express
[1:44:58] all my gratitude?
[1:45:04] I could sing these songs
[1:45:09] as I often do.
[1:45:14] Every song must end
[1:45:20] and you never do.
[1:45:25] So I throw up my hands and praise you
[1:45:29] again and again.
[1:45:33] Cuz all that I have is a hallelu.
[1:45:39] [Music]
[1:45:42] Hallelu.
[1:45:44] [Music]
[1:45:46] And I know it's not much. I've nothing
[1:45:50] else fit for a king
[1:45:55] except for a heart singing hallelu.
[1:46:03] Hallelujah.
[1:46:05] [Music]
[1:46:12] I've got one response.
[1:46:17] I've got just one move
[1:46:22] with my arms stretch wide.
[1:46:27] I will worship you.
[1:46:32] So I throw up my hands and praise you
[1:46:36] again and again.
[1:46:40] Cuz all that I have is a hallelujah.
[1:46:48] Hallelu.
[1:46:52] And I know it's not much, but I've
[1:46:55] nothing else fit for a king
[1:46:59] except for a heart singing hallelujah.
[1:47:07] Hallelujah.
[1:47:13] Come on my soul.
[1:47:16] Oh, come on my soul. Oh, don't you get
[1:47:20] shy on me. Lift up your soul cuz you got
[1:47:24] a lion inside of those lungs. Get up
[1:47:29] there and praise the Lord.
[1:47:35] Oh, come on, my soul. Oh, don't you get
[1:47:39] shy on me. Lift up your soul. Cuz you
[1:47:43] got a lion inside those lungs. get up
[1:47:48] there and praise the Lord.
[1:47:52] [Music]
[1:47:56] So I throw up my hands and praise you
[1:48:01] again and again.
[1:48:05] Cuz all that I have is a highle
[1:48:13] hallelu.
[1:48:17] I know it's not much. I've nothing else
[1:48:22] fit for a king
[1:48:25] except for a heart singing hallelu
[1:48:33] hallelujah.
[1:48:42] You are my refuge.
[1:48:47] You are my sanctuary.
[1:48:52] When I feel afraid,
[1:48:57] you're my hiding place. You are my
[1:49:02] refuge.
[1:49:05] And when the storm is raing
[1:49:10] underneath your wings,
[1:49:14] I rejoice and sing. You are my refuge.
[1:49:21] And you are my refuge.
[1:49:26] You are my sanuary.
[1:49:29] [Music]
[1:49:31] When I feel afraid,
[1:49:35] you're my hiding place. You are my
[1:49:39] refuge.
[1:49:42] And when the storm is raing
[1:49:48] underneath your wings,
[1:49:52] I rejoice and sing. You are my refuge.
[1:49:57] [Music]
[1:50:07] You know,
[1:50:10] he's a God who can make himself this
[1:50:13] little and he can expand over the whole
[1:50:16] universe.
[1:50:18] Sometimes we imagine him so great and so
[1:50:20] big, why would he care for me?
[1:50:24] But he knows you are.
[1:50:26] And as he hung there on a cross and when
[1:50:28] he said it is finished, it's because
[1:50:31] everyone, every name, every person,
[1:50:34] every part of him was included.
[1:50:38] Are you a part of him? Is he a part of
[1:50:40] you?
[1:50:41] Amen. You still have to have a battle,
[1:50:44] but you know he's a battle scarred
[1:50:46] veteran. Where did you get those wounds?
[1:50:49] When they asked him in the house of my
[1:50:52] friends. He's a battle scard veteran. He
[1:50:56] understands.
[1:50:58] Amen. I
[1:51:00] Tonight I'm supposed to speak and
[1:51:04] I gave him 15 minutes of my time. So
[1:51:07] that's okay. Don't hold it against him.
[1:51:10] But you know what? Every every word that
[1:51:11] was said was needed today. So Amen.
[1:51:15] [Applause]
[1:51:15] [Music]
[1:51:17] [Applause]
[1:51:20] Amen.
[1:51:22] Sometimes you go to the doctor and the
[1:51:24] doctor just says, "Oh, you just need
[1:51:25] this." And sometimes you go to the
[1:51:28] doctor and the doctor says, "We need to
[1:51:29] do some some investigating to see what
[1:51:32] causes." And God works that same way.
[1:51:34] Amen. Let's just bow our heads.
[1:51:39] The scripture says, "Lord, there you
[1:51:41] were wounded for our transgressions.
[1:51:45] You were bruised for our iniquities.
[1:51:49] and the chastisement for our peace was
[1:51:51] laid upon you and by your stripes
[1:51:56] we are healed.
[1:51:59] Lord, you felt the filling of our
[1:52:01] infirmities. You you were tempted and
[1:52:04] tried in every manner.
[1:52:08] You you went out on by yourself out
[1:52:10] there and up on the mountain for 40 days
[1:52:14] and Satan knew you were there.
[1:52:17] And he said, "After 40 days, he has to
[1:52:19] be weak. I'll take him down now."
[1:52:23] But you stood on your own word, the word
[1:52:26] of God, and you defeated him, and you
[1:52:28] defeated him, and you defeated him.
[1:52:30] Lord, if we'll take what you've given us
[1:52:33] today, then we are more than able. Lord,
[1:52:37] thank you for your word today. May each
[1:52:39] one of us take it and apply it.
[1:52:42] As we as we leave, as we go out, let us
[1:52:45] not leave our armor here.
[1:52:49] Let us take it with us. Let us get up in
[1:52:52] the morning, Lord. We put that armor
[1:52:54] before we go out.
[1:52:56] Let somebody question it. Why are you
[1:52:58] wearing that? Why are you dressed that
[1:53:00] way?
[1:53:02] Because I represent a kingdom.
[1:53:05] I represent this army force. This is my
[1:53:09] uniform.
[1:53:10] But it's not just a uniform. is my
[1:53:12] protection. It's what keeps me. It's
[1:53:14] what helps me. Lord, let us not be
[1:53:16] ashamed. Father, thank you for your
[1:53:19] word, Lord. Will you as we go, Lord?
[1:53:21] Would you go with us? You will go with
[1:53:24] us if we'll take you, Lord. Let us
[1:53:26] always am rooting for you, Lord.
[1:53:29] Lord, and if anyone has a need this
[1:53:32] morning and would like to be prayed
[1:53:34] with, Brother Ryan would would do that.
[1:53:36] He said he would, Lord.
[1:53:38] It's not brother Ryan that's going to
[1:53:40] cause
[1:53:41] Lord. It's going to be you answering the
[1:53:43] meeting. Lord, we just we ask that so
[1:53:46] commit the rest of this day to you in
[1:53:49] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:53:52] God bless you as you go. If you'd like
[1:53:55] to stay, if you would like to be prayed
[1:53:57] over, that's fine. If you're going to
[1:53:59] leave, just go ahead and go out quietly.
[1:54:02] And those that would like prayer. Amen.
[1:54:11] When I think about the Lord,
[1:54:15] how he saved me, how he raised me, how
[1:54:20] he filled me with the Holy Ghost, how he
[1:54:25] healed me to the uttermost. And I think
[1:54:29] about the Lord.
[1:54:32] How he picked me up and turned me
[1:54:36] around. How he placed my feet
[1:54:40] on solid ground.
[1:54:43] And it makes me want to shout,
[1:54:46] "Hallelujah.
[1:54:48] Thank you, Jesus. Lord, you're worthy of
[1:54:52] all of the glory and all of the honor
[1:54:56] and all of the praise.
[1:54:59] And it makes me want to shout,
[1:55:02] "Hallelujah.
[1:55:04] Thank you, Jesus. Lord, you're worthy of
[1:55:09] all of the glory and all of the honor
[1:55:12] and all of the praise.
[1:55:17] When I think about the Lord,
[1:55:21] how he saved me, how he raised me, how
[1:55:26] he filled me with the Holy Ghost, how he
[1:55:30] healed me to the uttermost. When I think
[1:55:35] about the Lord,
[1:55:38] how he picked me up and turned me
[1:55:41] around. How he place my feet
[1:55:45] on solid ground
[1:55:48] and makes me want to shout halleluah.
[1:55:54] Thank you, Jesus. Lord, you're worthy of
[1:55:58] all of the glory and all of the honor
[1:56:01] and all of the praise.
[1:56:05] Makes me want to shout, "Hallelujah.
[1:56:10] Thank you, Jesus. Lord, you're worthy of
[1:56:14] all of the glory, all of the honor, and
[1:56:18] all of the praise.
[1:56:28] [Music]
[1:56:43] Faithfulness
[1:56:45] has walked beside me.
[1:56:51] The winter storms make way for spring.
[1:56:59] And every season
[1:57:02] from where I'm standing,
[1:57:07] I see the evidence of your goodness.
[1:57:13] All over my life.
[1:57:18] All over my life.
[1:57:23] I see your promises in fulfillments
[1:57:30] all over my life.
[1:57:34] All over my life.
[1:57:37] [Music]
[1:57:40] I'll remember when I'm weak.
[1:57:48] The fear may come. The feeling
[1:57:56] lead my heart to victory.
[1:58:03] You are my strength
[1:58:06] and you always
[1:58:09] will.
[1:58:11] I see the evidence of your goodness
[1:58:17] all over my life.
[1:58:21] All over my life.
[1:58:27] And I see your promises in fulfillment
[1:58:33] all over my life.
[1:58:37] Follow my life.

[1:58:52] All over my life.

[1:59:04] all over my life.
[1:59:08] all over my body.

[1:59:43] Oh spirit, come make us all good.
[1:59:51] We turn our eyes

[2:00:04] So give us clean hands
[2:00:08] and give us your hearts.
[2:00:12] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[2:00:19] Oh, give us clean hands
[2:00:23] and give us pure hearts.
[2:00:27] Let us now lift our souls to another.
[2:00:34] Oh God, let this be the generation
[2:00:39] that seeks,
[2:00:41] who seeks your face.
[2:00:44] Oh God of Jacob.
[2:00:49] Oh God, let this be a generation
[2:00:53] that seeks,

[2:02:34] [Music]
[2:03:06] I give myself away.
[2:03:13] I give myself away
[2:03:17] so you can use me. I give myself away.
[2:03:28] I give myself away
[2:03:32] so you
[2:03:34] can use me.
[2:03:37] And here I am.
[2:03:41] And here I stand.
