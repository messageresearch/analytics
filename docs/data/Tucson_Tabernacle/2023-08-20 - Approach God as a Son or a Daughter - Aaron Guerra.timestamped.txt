[20:17] foreign
[20:20] [Music]
[20:28] Lord we
[20:30] praise you
[20:34] we certainly have plenty to praise the
[20:38] Lord for
[20:39] eign
[20:41] we have a couple of
[20:43] requests that were written out so we
[20:45] thought we'd handle those at the
[20:47] beginning as well as we join our hearts
[20:50] together you know if one can chase the
[20:51] tiles and two can chase ten thousand
[20:53] those exponents of ten there's about 50
[20:56] or more of us here there's not enough
[20:58] demons in hell that can withstand the
[21:00] prayers that this group much less the
[21:03] body of Christ around the world can't
[21:06] defeat if we join our hearts if we join
[21:09] our faith if we bring together those
[21:11] Elixir fire Those portions of the Holy
[21:14] Spirit through the proportion to each
[21:15] one of us and just pull together in
[21:18] unity there is nothing that can stand
[21:22] before that
[21:24] pray for my family
[21:26] and my finances Sister Margaret
[21:30] Stevenson and family
[21:33] one from Sister Amelia it's been about a
[21:36] year since I went to see my daughter
[21:38] Lisa and we all prayed for her she was
[21:41] in her last stages of cirrhosis of the
[21:43] liver
[21:44] the Lord had healed her and she was
[21:46] doing well but shortly after she started
[21:49] drinking again and got real sick and
[21:52] lost her liver I'm planning on going to
[21:54] see her soon
[21:56] prayers
[21:59] very serious these are life
[22:02] and death but nothing nothing as though
[22:07] as the brother I shared with that this
[22:09] morning from Romans 8 37-39 there's
[22:12] there's nothing that can separate us
[22:15] from the love of God nothing absolutely
[22:17] nothing so let's join our hearts
[22:19] together as we take these requests and
[22:22] whatever's on your heart as we lay aside
[22:24] the burdens of this life the burdens of
[22:27] the world to focus on the Lord Jesus
[22:30] Lord we are so grateful that we can have
[22:33] this opportunity this night in August of

[22:41] our hearts before you Lord that you've
[22:44] heard our songs of praise Lord and it's
[22:47] true the worship that's coming from our
[22:49] hearts towards you Lord because you are
[22:51] the source you are everything to us Lord

[31:00] just an instance I there was something
[31:03] that the Lord was dealing with me about
[31:05] and it was something I was up against
[31:06] and I chose bitterness over love
[31:15] as far away as you go from the Lord you
[31:17] have to come all the way back
[31:19] and it's a long hard Road as far as you

[44:14] seated
[44:16] amen
[44:18] so
[44:21] brother John Hall sent brother Daniel a
[44:23] text
[44:25] and and to let him know that today
[44:30] August 20th
[44:33] eight years ago brother green passed
[44:34] away
[44:36] I believe it was early in the morning
[44:39] and there was a part of us that said no
[44:43] no we wanted brother green back
[44:46] but there was a part of us that said yes
[44:49] he suffered long enough he's done his
[44:51] job so
[44:53] ask brother Jeremy to put a picture up
[44:55] there and I just said choose one of
[44:57] those there
[44:59] brother green the founder of this church
[45:03] God called him and left and God had a
[45:06] reason as to why and all and and today
[45:10] we're here
[45:11] because if somebody obeyed the call of
[45:13] the Lord
[45:15] and I don't know here
[45:17] who here today was way back there when
[45:20] it started but
[45:22] I know that there was some sister Mercy
[45:25] samurano probably listening she was the
[45:27] first one brother green baptized when he
[45:29] came
[45:30] my wife was was a a young girl a very
[45:34] young young girl when they attended the
[45:36] Tabernacle down there
[45:39] but I think we in 1975 came to the
[45:42] December meetings and the first time got
[45:43] to meet brother Greene
[45:45] and it wasn't so much brother green even
[45:48] though yes it was brother green in a
[45:50] sense
[45:51] but it was the god
[45:54] that brother green served
[45:56] and preached and talked about that's
[45:58] made the difference in our lives
[46:00] yeah that's where it is so
[46:03] and as I thought about it I said sister
[46:05] Green's with him now
[46:08] and it's probably changed a little bit
[46:10] for him
[46:12] because she's probably town now Perry
[46:14] you can't do that
[46:16] no you can't be like that
[46:19] she used to sit right there about where
[46:20] maybe sister hope and such a lily or
[46:23] they were sitting there
[46:24] and she'd be going like this to him
[46:27] like nope don't say that
[46:30] but it doesn't help does it
[46:33] my wife's going no it doesn't
[46:36] but appreciate the grace of God and the
[46:38] mercy of the Lord and the goodness
[46:40] that we can still be here serving the
[46:43] same Living God
[46:45] because you trust in the Lord forever
[46:49] for in the Lord Jehovah is Everlasting
[46:53] strength so
[46:55] appreciate that so much so tonight just
[46:58] just like to
[47:00] bring a few things to your to your
[47:02] memory and just some things that brother
[47:04] green said and I had mentioned it
[47:07] thought to myself I'm going to say
[47:10] I listened to his the testimony that he
[47:13] gave his testimony at brother biscal's
[47:16] he had done about 20 years ago or so
[47:18] maybe a little longer
[47:19] two services and really laid a lot of it
[47:23] out but a couple things that just stick
[47:24] with me and I I don't ever forget them
[47:28] he says what can you do to make God love
[47:32] you more
[47:35] and you say well I could be a better
[47:37] Christian I could do this no God loved
[47:40] you with perfect love
[47:43] while you are yet a sinner God loved you
[47:47] and cared for you he was already making
[47:49] a way for you
[47:52] so if you can't make him love you more
[47:54] what can you do
[47:56] you can love him more
[47:59] and as something that brother green
[48:01] always told us
[48:03] and this is the one that I I remembered
[48:05] and it kind of fits with today as
[48:09] he said Jesus was a crooked lawyer
[48:14] or a an attorney
[48:18] because he would take and get rid of the
[48:21] evidence
[48:23] when Satan would come and accuse and say
[48:25] but he did this and this and God would
[48:27] say
[48:28] where is it the Slate is clean
[48:31] there was nothing he could point out I
[48:34] just remember brother green saying that
[48:36] he was a crooked lawyer
[48:39] because today if you found a lawyer was
[48:41] hiding evidence he'd get in a lot of
[48:42] trouble
[48:44] but this one washed it through his blood
[48:47] and perfect so I just I and it when I
[48:50] wrote this down this was yesterday
[48:53] in my mind I had the days mixed I was
[48:56] thinking August 15th he passed away but
[48:58] it was August 20th 2015.
[49:02] but Jesus Christ is still here the same
[49:04] yesterday today and forever
[49:07] so again here's our strength Everlasting
[49:10] strength
[49:15] brother Branham says in a quote here
[49:19] in uh in 55
[49:22] in the calling of Abraham
[49:25] he says now here's what God did for us
[49:27] in Christ
[49:29] God manifested in flesh
[49:32] took his own son up to Calvary
[49:34] and there he killed his own son on
[49:37] calvary's Cross to make a covenant with
[49:40] a human race
[49:41] and when he did he nailed him to the
[49:44] cross the dead sacrifice it was and
[49:48] pulled out of him the Holy Spirit into
[49:50] thy hands I commend my spirit
[49:52] blood running from his side and hands
[49:56] and feet
[49:57] and God pulled out the spirit from him
[50:00] and shoved the body down in the grave
[50:03] raised it up on the third day and set it
[50:07] on his right hand and sent the rest of
[50:10] the agreement back to the church which
[50:13] was the same holy ghost that was upon
[50:16] Christ come upon the church
[50:19] and the only way in the world will ever
[50:21] be able to make it at the day of the
[50:24] judgment is for that same holy spirit
[50:26] that was Upon Jesus Christ we'll have to
[50:29] dovetail as his wife through the body
[50:32] amen
[50:34] and he kept his word
[50:38] how many know because he lives in you
[50:40] today he dwells in you amen
[50:43] so looking at that
[50:45] I'm going to go to some scriptures here
[50:49] in Isaiah and a very familiar scriptures
[50:53] Isaiah 53.
[50:56] verses 3 to 7.
[51:00] I'll read the scriptures and then and
[51:01] then we'll just look at some notes Here
[51:05] he was despised and rejected of men a
[51:08] Man of Sorrows
[51:10] and acquainted with grief and we hid as
[51:13] it were our faces from him he was
[51:16] despised and we esteemed him not
[51:20] now here's a translation man-made
[51:24] sport of him
[51:26] they were entertained by his death
[51:29] turning away from him he was a Man of
[51:32] Sorrows marked by disease and like one
[51:36] of whom men's faces are turned away he
[51:39] was looked down on and we put no value
[51:42] on him
[51:45] it was just another death
[51:48] to so many people
[51:50] but to me it was life-saving it was
[51:52] life-changing
[51:55] and it says surely he has borne our
[51:57] griefs and carried our sorrows yet we
[52:01] did esteem him stricken smitten of God
[52:04] and afflicted
[52:06] but it was our pain he took and our
[52:09] diseases were put upon him
[52:11] while to us he seemed as one diseased on
[52:15] whom God's punishment had come
[52:21] how could this be the Son of God hanging
[52:24] on the cross being treated that way no
[52:26] he deserved what he got is what people
[52:28] were thinking
[52:30] but he was wounded for our
[52:32] transgressions he was bruised for our
[52:34] iniquities
[52:36] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[52:38] him and with his stripes we are healed
[52:44] but it was for our sins he was wounded
[52:46] and for our evil doings he was crushed
[52:49] he took the punishment by which we have
[52:52] peace and by his wounds we are made well
[52:58] what could you do to earn
[53:01] this salvation what could you give for
[53:04] it
[53:05] to what extent could you go to say Okay
[53:07] God would say okay that's enough
[53:09] no it took a perfect sacrifice
[53:12] says all we like sheep have gone astray
[53:15] and have turned everyone to his own way
[53:17] and the Lord hath laid on him the
[53:21] iniquity of us all
[53:24] we all went wandering like sheep going
[53:27] every one of us after his desire
[53:30] and the Lord put on him the punishment
[53:33] of us all
[53:35] what I deserved he took
[53:38] every stripe every lashing every
[53:40] smacking every everything they did
[53:43] you were on his mind
[53:45] while he was going through that
[53:48] he was oppressed and he was afflicted
[53:50] yet he opened not his mouth
[53:53] he be he is brought as a lamb to the
[53:56] slaughter and as a sheep before his
[53:59] shears is done so he opened not his
[54:02] mouth
[54:03] men were cruel to him
[54:05] but he was gentle and quiet as a lamb
[54:08] taken to its death and as a sheep before
[54:11] those who take her wool make no sound
[54:14] so he said not a word
[54:17] until he said it is finished
[54:21] when he knew everything had been covered
[54:24] and taken care
[54:27] the thought I had was
[54:31] works are based on love
[54:36] you do works because you love him
[54:40] and he did all the work that he did
[54:43] because he loves you
[54:46] he knows you by name
[54:48] he knows everything about you
[54:51] both what we would call good and bad
[54:55] but he still loved you
[54:56] he still cared he still took care of it
[54:59] and just a little description of him
[55:02] the Lord Jesus Christ
[55:05] the greatest
[55:06] the highest
[55:08] the most powerful of whom there is no
[55:11] equal
[55:12] worthy of all adoration honor and praise
[55:15] worship to be exalted and I just put an
[55:18] on and on and on where do you stop
[55:22] he says
[55:23] yet the most humble
[55:25] the most forgiving loving caring
[55:28] he could hide himself with the common
[55:31] people and disappear in a crowd
[55:34] walk with the lowly and unworthy ones
[55:38] hang on a cross with thieves
[55:41] the only one who keeps all his word
[55:46] and he knows every name of every one of
[55:49] his own
[55:52] not one shall be lost and God it is all
[55:57] yea and amen
[56:00] that's a description of the one that
[56:02] loves you the one that cares for you the
[56:05] one who had you and his heart and his
[56:07] mind when he hung on the cross
[56:10] amen
[56:13] now just I'm going to do this a little
[56:15] bit different
[56:17] show this to brother Daniel before we
[56:19] were talking and just kind of looking at
[56:20] some things
[56:22] and just some thoughts just some some
[56:25] things that
[56:26] sometimes you hear another Minister
[56:28] speak sometimes you read sometimes you
[56:30] hear something and it catches your heart
[56:32] and you you write a note and so I just
[56:35] kind of put some of these things
[56:36] together
[56:38] and and and I would just say approach
[56:42] God as a son or a daughter
[56:48] you know
[56:50] when I go to my dad
[56:52] I I uh to the to their house Mom dad's
[56:55] house we knock on the door
[56:58] just it's more to let them know we're
[57:00] there
[57:01] not to ask permission to come in because
[57:03] the house is open to us
[57:06] now we're respectful about it
[57:08] but it's my father my mother
[57:10] and they say come on in
[57:13] and God is the same way you come seeking
[57:16] knocking asking he's waiting for that
[57:20] he wants that from you he wants you to
[57:23] come and says father my son my daughter
[57:26] come on in let's have Fellowship what
[57:28] can I do for you
[57:31] you know and when you think about this
[57:33] approach God as a son and daughter and
[57:36] the thought the prodigal son was always
[57:39] a son
[57:43] he was always a son when the father was
[57:46] looking back down the way he was said my
[57:49] son
[57:50] he never said it any different
[57:52] now the son came back thinking about
[57:54] himself I'm not worthy to be your son
[57:58] I've made a mess in my life I've ruined
[58:00] my inheritance I've done this that and
[58:01] the other
[58:02] I'll just be a servant
[58:05] and and his father said no you are my
[58:08] son
[58:11] always
[58:13] a son or a daughter
[58:18] in in
[58:19] this is the one that brother Dan he was
[58:21] just reading through this and he says I
[58:22] like that
[58:24] having the right spirit
[58:26] and the wrong Doctrine
[58:29] and not the other way around
[58:32] then God can work with you
[58:35] how many times we work hard to make sure
[58:38] we got every word in the right place
[58:40] every period everything but with the
[58:42] contrary spirit
[58:44] if I say Lord fix this heart first
[58:48] make it right before you
[58:50] and then it can say Amen to your word
[58:57] look into Grace
[59:00] and not our mistakes
[59:03] confession of mistakes
[59:06] not excuses to clean them
[59:10] you don't go before God and say
[59:12] it's because of this I did that
[59:16] there is no forgiveness in that but when
[59:18] you go Lord I failed you I did wrong
[59:20] would you forgive me he says yes
[59:24] and and sometimes we want to make them
[59:27] look better we want to clean them up
[59:30] but just go to God and say it's what it
[59:33] is Lord help me
[59:38] take note of what's in your heart
[59:41] and not what's in your head
[59:45] because this is where you have all the
[59:47] problems
[59:48] this is where Satan likes to get in and
[59:50] just twist things around
[59:53] oh you know like he went to Eve
[59:57] I know he said but I think he really
[59:59] meant this
[1:00:03] but look in your heart something in your
[1:00:04] heart says no I'm going to stay true to
[1:00:06] God
[1:00:07] I know that if I'll go back to him he'll
[1:00:10] receive me
[1:00:11] I know that if I say sorry he'll accept
[1:00:14] me
[1:00:16] because that's who he is
[1:00:21] and I was thinking of David with this
[1:00:23] thought
[1:00:24] when Satan what Satan fears the most
[1:00:27] is when what you know becomes a
[1:00:30] revelation in your heart from God
[1:00:34] and then you can put a stone in the
[1:00:36] sling and go after a giant
[1:00:40] and we have a lot of giants in our lives
[1:00:42] at times
[1:00:44] a lot of the Giants they live right here
[1:00:47] it's amazing you get such a big giant
[1:00:49] such a small place at times it wraps up
[1:00:53] your life it takes so much of your time
[1:00:56] sometimes you can't sleep sometimes you
[1:00:58] can't rest
[1:01:00] sometimes you want to pray and you say
[1:01:01] Lord I don't even know how you're going
[1:01:03] to hear me with all this going on
[1:01:07] but if you'll say father I am your son I
[1:01:09] am your daughter
[1:01:11] I'm coming through the shed blood of
[1:01:14] your only son Jesus
[1:01:16] the accepted one
[1:01:18] the rest of it gets pushed away it gets
[1:01:20] pushed aside there is no sin too great
[1:01:23] too big too many too many mistakes that
[1:01:27] you could do that he would say you're
[1:01:28] not mine anymore
[1:01:30] you're one of his
[1:01:35] and then this is I would hit me
[1:01:37] sometimes you just have to give it up
[1:01:41] and let God see that you mean it
[1:01:45] Lord I'm going through a hard time right
[1:01:47] now and I'm hurting so I'm going to give
[1:01:50] it up but when I'm feeling better I'm
[1:01:51] going to get it back
[1:01:54] now when you God says you're willing to
[1:01:55] say whatever it takes
[1:01:58] I want to let it go
[1:02:00] I'm going to commit it to you Lord
[1:02:03] I said then he will go to work on it
[1:02:06] because the Battle Belongs to the Lord
[1:02:11] when David he stood there on God's word
[1:02:13] looking at Goliath
[1:02:15] he didn't compare himself to the Giant
[1:02:19] he said this is God's Children Here we
[1:02:24] are his heirs and how could that
[1:02:26] Philistine be saying things like that no
[1:02:29] our God is greater
[1:02:31] our sister and brother Daniel singing
[1:02:33] that song He's greater than any
[1:02:35] situation
[1:02:38] even when the situation looks that
[1:02:40] little
[1:02:41] to when it looks that big
[1:02:44] you know
[1:02:45] you look at the heavens
[1:02:49] and and you'll see all those stars and
[1:02:52] sometimes I'll get on on a site and just
[1:02:54] look at the pictures taken by the Hubble
[1:02:56] and the different uh
[1:02:58] things they sent up to take pictures and
[1:03:00] been traveling out there for years and
[1:03:02] it's absolutely amazing what's out there
[1:03:05] sometimes you wonder could it really be
[1:03:07] real
[1:03:08] well we see such a small port
[1:03:11] but it's his
[1:03:13] it's all his
[1:03:15] so what is I don't mean this wrong but
[1:03:18] what is your little speck compared to
[1:03:19] that
[1:03:22] we're the ones that sometimes make it
[1:03:23] this big
[1:03:25] we look at Goliath and he just keeps
[1:03:27] getting bigger and bigger and bigger and
[1:03:29] bigger and I keep getting smaller and
[1:03:31] smaller no
[1:03:33] take God at his word and go take it down
[1:03:41] you're human
[1:03:43] I think all of us could raise our hands
[1:03:46] oh yeah so I have to raise both because
[1:03:49] sometimes it's even worse than that
[1:03:52] you know
[1:03:54] but he's God
[1:03:56] so therefore I can go to him with
[1:03:58] whatever the situation says here it is
[1:04:01] Lord
[1:04:02] I've tried to put it together and it's
[1:04:04] not working out
[1:04:05] so I'm committing it to you
[1:04:10] as we were talking the other night I was
[1:04:12] I believe myself and and brother Lyle
[1:04:15] last Wednesday
[1:04:18] talking about some experiences and
[1:04:19] brother Daniel back here
[1:04:22] and I said you know who the greatest
[1:04:24] boss is the best boss you could have
[1:04:28] is the one who's been through where
[1:04:30] where you're at right now
[1:04:32] one who went through all the training
[1:04:35] and the experiences
[1:04:38] a couple of the best the best guys that
[1:04:40] I worked under
[1:04:41] had already done what I was going
[1:04:43] through and if you needed help they
[1:04:44] could walk out out and show you how to
[1:04:46] do it
[1:04:48] and how many times they did when we were
[1:04:50] in a hurry they would come out of the
[1:04:51] offense to come outside let us get it
[1:04:53] done let's work on this together
[1:04:57] and that's my God
[1:04:59] he wrapped himself in flesh
[1:05:02] and he walked on this Earth
[1:05:05] as a human
[1:05:07] so when I say I need some help he says
[1:05:10] I've been there
[1:05:11] I know that feeling I know that
[1:05:13] Temptation I know what happens when
[1:05:15] those thoughts come that way
[1:05:17] and he can help
[1:05:20] the ones that are hard to deal with the
[1:05:23] ones that sit in the office and on the
[1:05:25] phone tell you what to do
[1:05:27] I don't know but directions on the phone
[1:05:29] can be really hard sometimes
[1:05:32] but when somebody is there showing you
[1:05:34] and working with you
[1:05:37] something else we heard brother green
[1:05:39] often say look we're living for others
[1:05:42] is looking heaven in the face
[1:05:47] because there was one that that's all
[1:05:49] he'd lived for was for others
[1:05:53] his whole life was about me and you
[1:05:57] that's why he came
[1:06:03] in in just just the way they came to me
[1:06:06] I wrote them down
[1:06:07] well she typed him out for me let's just
[1:06:10] be honest
[1:06:11] because usually by now I wouldn't be
[1:06:13] able to read my own writing
[1:06:16] so when God is testing you
[1:06:19] and he does
[1:06:21] and the only way you know is when you go
[1:06:23] through the test
[1:06:25] to pass the test you have to take the
[1:06:27] test
[1:06:29] there was a teacher in in high school
[1:06:33] and he gave the test and he said the
[1:06:35] test is the first three pages of this
[1:06:37] book and if you memorize the first three
[1:06:39] pages
[1:06:41] and just basically write it all back
[1:06:42] down you'll Ace the test
[1:06:45] so I did I think I got two words wrong I
[1:06:48] crossed them
[1:06:49] and one other girl did and we're the
[1:06:51] only two that passed the test
[1:06:55] she took the time that's what that's
[1:06:56] what the teacher said to do
[1:06:59] so I did it and he goes up two of you
[1:07:02] did what I said both of you passed
[1:07:03] nobody else did
[1:07:06] God said
[1:07:08] take him at his word
[1:07:11] and how do you know his word when you
[1:07:13] begin to study it when you began to read
[1:07:15] it when you began to experience it
[1:07:17] when you began to fellowship with him in
[1:07:20] his word
[1:07:21] yeah
[1:07:23] God testing you to see your action how
[1:07:26] you act that's the only way you know if
[1:07:29] you know the product how good the
[1:07:31] product is by testing it by trying it by
[1:07:33] using it
[1:07:35] have a brother-in-law who used to sell I
[1:07:38] think it was Kirby vacuum cleaners they
[1:07:41] would go out to the houses
[1:07:43] and they knock on your door and they
[1:07:44] would say I'd like to test mine against
[1:07:46] yours
[1:07:48] and they would tell you and this is what
[1:07:49] he shared with me he said you wore
[1:07:51] cuffed pants
[1:07:53] and you would tell them go bring your
[1:07:55] vacuum and when or or you would have
[1:07:57] them vacuum up a space and then tell
[1:08:00] them to put their vacuum away and then
[1:08:02] he said when they put their vacuum away
[1:08:04] you took the dust out of your cuffs and
[1:08:06] you sprinkled that ground again
[1:08:09] and then you took the Kirby back I
[1:08:12] believe it was Kirby maybe it was
[1:08:13] another one and then he said then you
[1:08:15] would vacuum
[1:08:17] and then you would show them all the
[1:08:19] dust there vacuum mist
[1:08:22] he said that's how you tried to get a
[1:08:24] sale
[1:08:26] but the one that said try me
[1:08:29] test me see if I can perform went
[1:08:32] through everything that you've gone
[1:08:34] through
[1:08:37] it's hard to imagine that he could have
[1:08:39] thoughts go through his head that way
[1:08:41] but he could not be tested and attempted
[1:08:43] and tried to understand us if it didn't
[1:08:45] happen
[1:08:47] that's why you don't go worship a rock a
[1:08:49] stone you're worshiping a living God one
[1:08:53] who's been there has done it
[1:08:59] he said I Was Born This Way
[1:09:02] you must be born again
[1:09:05] you must be born again
[1:09:12] and when you get knocked down and when
[1:09:14] you fall down
[1:09:16] get right backed up
[1:09:19] get back up stand up again saying Lord I
[1:09:22] failed
[1:09:23] you're not saved by your Works you're
[1:09:25] saved by grace
[1:09:28] it's not how many times I get it right
[1:09:31] it's when I come completely give it over
[1:09:33] to him because he got it right the first
[1:09:36] time
[1:09:38] that's what he's looking at
[1:09:43] and I'm going to ask a question it's not
[1:09:45] a trick question
[1:09:47] how many are righteous in here
[1:09:51] how many are righteous because the
[1:09:52] righteous one stands in your place
[1:09:57] you have to accept that you're not
[1:09:58] righteous of your own but the righteous
[1:10:00] one stands in your place
[1:10:03] a righteous man is not a sinless man
[1:10:09] you have the righteousness of God in you
[1:10:13] Jesus Christ is the perfect sacrifice
[1:10:17] accepted in your place
[1:10:21] God looks at what his son did
[1:10:24] his righteousness for you
[1:10:31] how do I stay clean how do I keep clean
[1:10:33] what do I do
[1:10:36] you keep clean by confession
[1:10:39] and repentance
[1:10:41] I'm sorry
[1:10:43] I didn't mean that Lord help me
[1:10:46] as many times as it happens you make it
[1:10:49] right
[1:10:51] you know after what is it 44 years now
[1:10:55] we never hurt each other we never we're
[1:10:58] way past
[1:11:00] not quite
[1:11:02] no no there are still times I'll have to
[1:11:03] say I'm sorry
[1:11:06] I didn't mean it that way and if I did
[1:11:08] I'm sorry anyways
[1:11:10] it's the same way with the Lord remember
[1:11:12] when you go back to him
[1:11:15] and he's cleaned it out already and you
[1:11:17] tell him I did it again and he says what
[1:11:19] did you do and he looks at no the it's
[1:11:21] clean
[1:11:23] it's clean there's no evidence of it
[1:11:25] there it's washed away
[1:11:27] it's the first time you've done it
[1:11:30] yeah brother green called him the
[1:11:32] Crooked lawyer remember
[1:11:34] he takes the evidence he gets rid of it
[1:11:42] keep clean by confession and repentance
[1:11:46] now here here's this and this just kind
[1:11:48] of
[1:11:49] maybe put in a little bit of Works to it
[1:11:54] we can't wash our own laundry
[1:11:57] by our own works
[1:12:03] you think of a a washer
[1:12:07] and you know and I mean the electric
[1:12:10] kind not the one you're married to
[1:12:11] Brothers but the electric kind that you
[1:12:14] plug in and turn on
[1:12:17] what do you do you turn the machine on
[1:12:20] you put the water in you put the soap in
[1:12:21] and that machine begins to work
[1:12:25] yeah
[1:12:27] unless some of you are still jiggling
[1:12:31] the machine and moving it back and forth
[1:12:33] and trying to figure out how it works no
[1:12:34] the simple ways plug it in and turn it
[1:12:36] on
[1:12:40] so you cannot clean yourself by your own
[1:12:43] works
[1:12:46] then who justifies or who says how much
[1:12:49] is good enough
[1:12:52] only one
[1:12:53] heard it was enough
[1:12:55] and that was my Jesus when the father
[1:12:58] said it is finished
[1:13:03] ah
[1:13:05] we must let the blood wash us clean
[1:13:10] the work that was already done
[1:13:13] remember the natural Lamb's blood just
[1:13:16] covered sin for a year
[1:13:19] but it didn't take the desire away
[1:13:24] you know you can you can read hear from
[1:13:27] ministers brother Branham different
[1:13:29] ministers have touched on this and they
[1:13:31] say
[1:13:33] they would go away with a relief the
[1:13:35] lamb had been slain
[1:13:38] they had brought their lamb the high
[1:13:40] priest Lane the lamb the sacrifice had
[1:13:42] been accepted they went with that relief
[1:13:44] of it's covered again
[1:13:46] but the desire hadn't changed
[1:13:50] and when you still have that desire what
[1:13:52] happens you go back to
[1:13:55] what caused problems in the first place
[1:14:00] so it only covered that for a year
[1:14:04] and that was God's mercy
[1:14:06] that was being being merciful to them
[1:14:08] because he looked at a sacrifice that
[1:14:10] was accepted
[1:14:14] and then you know Abel and Cain way back
[1:14:17] in the very beginning
[1:14:19] after sin had happened in the garden
[1:14:22] and God had taken in slain lamb
[1:14:25] to cover for Adam and Eve
[1:14:29] and Adam and Eve I'm sure had had shown
[1:14:32] the uh Abel and Cain what had happened
[1:14:37] how an innocent lamb had to die how its
[1:14:39] blood had to be shed
[1:14:41] and and it came time to offer sacrifice
[1:14:46] and we know Cain offered his works that
[1:14:49] which he did which he grew what he's
[1:14:50] what he planted it was beautiful
[1:14:54] and and but but Adam had caught I mean
[1:14:57] um Abel had caught Revelation said
[1:14:59] something has to die in my place
[1:15:03] because that's what happened in the
[1:15:04] first first time
[1:15:07] and and
[1:15:09] the thought of this is if if Abel's
[1:15:11] sacrifice is being accepted When the
[1:15:14] Smoke Rose and is being accepted uh he
[1:15:18] would would think he would stop well if
[1:15:19] that's what it takes then that's what
[1:15:21] I'll do
[1:15:24] but he didn't do that
[1:15:26] he kept offering what he thought was
[1:15:28] good
[1:15:30] there is only one acceptable sacrifice
[1:15:35] and that was the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:36] offering himself
[1:15:41] you have to accept what he has done for
[1:15:44] you
[1:15:47] and when I say acceptance not just
[1:15:48] raising your hand and saying yes
[1:15:51] I accept it how many came that way and
[1:15:54] say I accept the Lord Jesus Billy Graham
[1:15:56] says I come and I hold this convention
[1:15:59] and 30 000 raise their hands and say yes
[1:16:03] I accept the Lord Jesus Christ as my
[1:16:05] savior but when he came back he said
[1:16:06] there might be 10 20 of them left
[1:16:10] but when you accept the sacrifice in
[1:16:12] your place then he comes in
[1:16:16] and begins to live in you
[1:16:19] and then it's there with you always
[1:16:23] you still make mistakes
[1:16:26] you still fail
[1:16:28] why you still have this human body you
[1:16:29] will make mistakes you still will fail
[1:16:31] but there is a sacrifice a perfect
[1:16:34] sacrifice there for you
[1:16:38] you know before service
[1:16:42] I uh
[1:16:44] I was thinking who do I ask this
[1:16:46] question to and I didn't see brother Dan
[1:16:49] so he didn't have to try to answer it
[1:16:51] but brother Lyle came walking by in
[1:16:54] about that
[1:16:56] and um
[1:17:00] you know you know brother Lyle the
[1:17:02] things that he's done and
[1:17:04] and been involved with and everything
[1:17:06] and
[1:17:09] I asked him one day and I'm not saying
[1:17:11] this to embarrass him
[1:17:12] I said where did you go to college for
[1:17:14] all this he said I didn't
[1:17:18] in fact he said the fur he was working
[1:17:20] for a Hamilton Airline or one of the
[1:17:22] airline companies here
[1:17:24] in Tucson and and somebody came in
[1:17:27] looking for something to do may be made
[1:17:29] and his boss said I know just the man
[1:17:31] that can do it and he took them over
[1:17:32] there to brother Lyle and brother Lyle
[1:17:34] said I didn't even know what they were
[1:17:36] talking about but I said yes
[1:17:39] and then he studied and now
[1:17:42] things that brother Lyle has done is
[1:17:44] amazing
[1:17:47] but I asked him I said what is gravity
[1:17:52] and he began to explain how gravity
[1:17:54] works
[1:17:57] what it does and we all know gravity is
[1:18:00] you drop something at false
[1:18:03] and if your foot in the way it hurts
[1:18:06] and everything
[1:18:07] but what is gravity I asked him he said
[1:18:10] nobody can really tell you what gravity
[1:18:12] is just how it works
[1:18:16] you see it manifested
[1:18:20] faith is a little bit like gravity
[1:18:23] you can talk about it
[1:18:26] you can experience it you can believe it
[1:18:29] but you can't really explain it
[1:18:32] give me a bag full of faith
[1:18:37] sell me some faith
[1:18:39] no it's an experience
[1:18:43] you know
[1:18:47] so this man that I heard speaking this
[1:18:50] or talking about this he was in
[1:18:53] Australia and he was at a well-known
[1:18:56] scientist he'd gone to see it and the
[1:18:59] man he said had a big black book and it
[1:19:01] said gravity
[1:19:02] so he asked him he said is that the book
[1:19:05] that tells you what gravity is
[1:19:09] and he said no all it tells you is how
[1:19:11] it works
[1:19:14] so that's what brought this thought he
[1:19:16] says
[1:19:19] gravity
[1:19:21] I trust it
[1:19:24] if I throw something up and it's coming
[1:19:26] down I get out of the way
[1:19:28] if I'm not trying to catch it I don't
[1:19:30] told him to say well gravity doesn't
[1:19:32] work today it's going to take off no
[1:19:34] you get out of the way if it's falling
[1:19:36] you get out of the way why because
[1:19:37] you've experienced gravity
[1:19:40] do you drop something down to the ground
[1:19:42] he goes and if you fall I haven't seen
[1:19:44] anybody float away
[1:19:46] they fall down to the ground
[1:19:48] gravity works that way
[1:19:51] I trust it I step on it every day walk
[1:19:55] in the path of gravity every day
[1:19:57] and I don't even make excuses for
[1:19:59] Gravity it is what it is
[1:20:04] I've I know of of two I don't know them
[1:20:07] personally
[1:20:09] but I read it in this book right here
[1:20:12] and I know this book is nothing but the
[1:20:14] truth
[1:20:16] there was one named Enoch
[1:20:18] who walked off
[1:20:21] I can't explain it how it happened but
[1:20:23] the Bible says he walked and was seen
[1:20:25] not
[1:20:27] and there was another one who ascended
[1:20:29] my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[1:20:32] but everybody else went to the Grave
[1:20:42] I don't understand gravity therefore I
[1:20:45] don't believe it
[1:20:48] I don't know anybody that has ever said
[1:20:49] that
[1:20:51] because I don't understand it I can't
[1:20:54] believe it
[1:20:55] no I see it it takes place
[1:21:00] in fact every time I've fallen down the
[1:21:02] same reaction I've fallen down
[1:21:04] it hasn't changed
[1:21:10] you take Faith the same way
[1:21:15] you trust it you walk in it you believe
[1:21:18] it even if you can't explain it
[1:21:24] explain to me Faith we could describe it
[1:21:27] up and down back and forth
[1:21:30] sister Connie explained Faith to me
[1:21:32] today
[1:21:33] but it works doesn't it
[1:21:37] it's the truth
[1:21:39] you take God at his word he keeps his
[1:21:41] word
[1:21:45] sometimes we say Lord where are you
[1:21:47] because we want it done then but God has
[1:21:49] perfect timing
[1:21:51] God knows how to do those things
[1:21:56] I
[1:21:58] as I was just kind of reading some of
[1:22:00] these things and some of these were just
[1:22:02] taken from something I heard somebody
[1:22:04] say something I read
[1:22:05] through the scriptures whatever and just
[1:22:08] just made a list of
[1:22:11] um notes points however you want to say
[1:22:13] just things that sometimes we take for
[1:22:16] granted yet it is simple
[1:22:24] if I throw it up it's coming back down
[1:22:28] even if it's a helium balloon eventually
[1:22:31] it's coming back down
[1:22:36] if I Take God at his word it will come
[1:22:39] to pass
[1:22:41] it has never failed
[1:22:43] God said it and it happened
[1:22:48] I've heard enough testimonies from
[1:22:51] enough folks to show
[1:22:53] we have one sitting right here that
[1:22:55] knows
[1:22:56] that he's Jesus Christ the same
[1:22:58] yesterday today and forever
[1:23:01] how many could how many knows that
[1:23:02] personally in your life what he's done
[1:23:04] for you
[1:23:06] brother Lyle back there that had that
[1:23:08] heart attack
[1:23:10] and look where he is today because God's
[1:23:11] A Healer
[1:23:13] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:23:15] forever
[1:23:19] and sometimes we do get frustrated
[1:23:20] sometimes we do get anxious sometimes we
[1:23:22] say when Lord when Lord
[1:23:25] but he has perfect timing
[1:23:27] he knows how to do it
[1:23:31] you know I'm going to say this because
[1:23:35] I've told this to brother Daniel
[1:23:38] I get to see it a little bit different
[1:23:40] brother Daniel back there
[1:23:42] after before and after Ministry
[1:23:47] and um
[1:23:50] brother Daniel comes across very
[1:23:52] confident
[1:23:54] have watched him how he works and how he
[1:23:56] does it it's who he is
[1:23:58] but I've seen brother Daniel back there
[1:23:59] shaken also
[1:24:01] why because
[1:24:03] because you've got something in your
[1:24:05] heart to deliver
[1:24:07] but you're just a man
[1:24:10] if you could have been around brother
[1:24:12] Branham you listen to brother Green's
[1:24:15] testimony brother Bissell some of those
[1:24:16] have spent time with them
[1:24:19] found out he was just a man
[1:24:22] but he knew a living God
[1:24:24] who was the same yesterday today and
[1:24:26] forever
[1:24:28] and you know what you can know that same
[1:24:30] God the same way
[1:24:34] last Sunday and he said he wasn't going
[1:24:37] to hear this live but he'd hear it a
[1:24:40] little bit after because he'd be
[1:24:41] traveling
[1:24:42] last Sunday
[1:24:44] as service was starting and I was
[1:24:46] walking back this way and something said
[1:24:49] go pray for brother Daniel
[1:24:52] not an audible voice just something in
[1:24:54] my heart said go
[1:24:57] so I knocked on the door
[1:25:00] brother Daniel said come in I stepped in
[1:25:02] I said can I pray for you and he said
[1:25:05] please
[1:25:06] he's just sitting there kind of holding
[1:25:08] his head
[1:25:11] don't go back there and you don't go
[1:25:13] back there to sleep you don't go back
[1:25:14] there to kick your you're asking God to
[1:25:17] help you when you come out
[1:25:20] because you're his
[1:25:23] you're his purchased possession
[1:25:26] we're here to help you
[1:25:28] that's what we're here for
[1:25:30] so I just put my arms around him I said
[1:25:31] Lord you know his burden you know what
[1:25:33] it is you just asked me to come pray for
[1:25:34] him so I'm asking you go with him help
[1:25:36] him
[1:25:38] and he ministered last Sunday
[1:25:41] then later he said had you not come to
[1:25:43] pray for me I didn't know if I could
[1:25:44] have come out I said but he did
[1:25:48] and if you'll do what God tells you to
[1:25:51] do watch him work
[1:25:54] you say well I'm insufficient
[1:25:56] but he's all sufficient
[1:25:58] he doesn't look and say well that one's
[1:26:00] good so I can use him no he goes after
[1:26:03] Peter's
[1:26:04] he goes after different people like that
[1:26:06] and says I'll show you that this is me
[1:26:08] and not them
[1:26:12] and I appreciate that his goodness and
[1:26:14] his grace
[1:26:16] remember you take Faith the same way
[1:26:21] you walk in the door
[1:26:23] you flip the light switch
[1:26:26] expecting the light to turn on
[1:26:29] in fact you generally don't even stop
[1:26:31] you just hit the light switch and keep
[1:26:33] going
[1:26:36] now if the bill hasn't been paid
[1:26:39] the electric bill
[1:26:41] except I'll tell you the bill has
[1:26:43] already been paid
[1:26:45] he's taking care of it all
[1:26:48] you can take him at his word
[1:26:51] for anything and everything you have
[1:26:54] made of
[1:26:57] but but brother Aaron I've made a mess
[1:26:59] of my life
[1:27:00] there isn't one of us that hasn't made a
[1:27:02] mess in our life
[1:27:04] and even if you don't think you haven't
[1:27:06] made a message of your life yes you have
[1:27:09] you are born and shaped born in sin and
[1:27:12] shaped in iniquity that's what the
[1:27:13] scripture says about you
[1:27:17] but God so loved the world
[1:27:20] that he who gave His only begotten son
[1:27:24] for me and for you
[1:27:28] one more thing before we close and the
[1:27:30] musicians can come up
[1:27:33] I'm sorry today I just got a 25 salary
[1:27:36] so I've used it no
[1:27:38] I told Brother Dan it'll be short just
[1:27:41] want to share this
[1:27:45] you know it's it's it's
[1:27:48] one of those things where you you you
[1:27:49] you compare yourself you look and you
[1:27:52] say am I worthy of it
[1:27:56] the worthy one already paid for it
[1:28:00] the worthy one already took care of it
[1:28:03] and what makes him happy is when you
[1:28:05] will take him at his word and go accept
[1:28:09] I remember brother green standing over
[1:28:11] this pulpit and
[1:28:12] I believe it was a twenty dollar bill
[1:28:15] and he said whoever wants this come and
[1:28:17] get it
[1:28:19] and nobody got up
[1:28:22] except one person and they got the 20
[1:28:24] bill
[1:28:27] brother green gave it to him
[1:28:29] God is offering
[1:28:31] his Mercy his grace his forgiveness his
[1:28:36] love his life
[1:28:38] it's for you to take it
[1:28:40] whatever you have need of
[1:28:43] God offers him
[1:28:44] [Music]
[1:28:47] is that true or not amen how many would
[1:28:49] testify with an upright's hand I know
[1:28:51] that God is more than able he's done it
[1:28:54] for me
[1:28:56] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:28:59] forever
[1:29:01] now we have a special need
[1:29:05] for tonight
[1:29:10] my sister
[1:29:12] spoke to her this afternoon
[1:29:15] you know she's been coming back and
[1:29:17] forth
[1:29:18] from Sierra Vista here because of
[1:29:20] dialysis and
[1:29:22] they did the surgery
[1:29:25] for the graph and then they put another
[1:29:27] one and it's just turned into a series
[1:29:29] of complications
[1:29:32] and I'll say this is told her I was
[1:29:35] going to say as best I could without
[1:29:38] too much detail about what you're going
[1:29:40] to understand
[1:29:42] when she had her second daughter my
[1:29:44] niece Eileen
[1:29:46] she slipped and she fell my sister did
[1:29:49] and she injured herself
[1:29:52] and they had to remove some of the
[1:29:54] muscles in there that helps you go to
[1:29:56] the bathroom
[1:29:58] so since then she's always had to have
[1:30:00] medication
[1:30:02] to go to the bathroom
[1:30:05] but for the two weeks she spent up here
[1:30:07] they did not give her any medication the
[1:30:10] doctors would not give her any
[1:30:13] so for the last week and a half
[1:30:17] she's been quite sick and in a lot of
[1:30:19] pain she cannot go to the bathroom
[1:30:23] she said I I am spasming constantly just
[1:30:29] so I said he's Jesus Christ he says I
[1:30:33] know he is
[1:30:34] we were raised this way we knew but it
[1:30:37] hurts I'm uncomfortable I have to it's
[1:30:40] just constant pain
[1:30:43] and I said Lord what do we do tonight
[1:30:47] and the Lord brought to back to him in
[1:30:50] my memory how they would some that would
[1:30:51] come and brother Branham in the prayer
[1:30:54] line would say oh you're not here for
[1:30:56] yourself
[1:30:58] you're here for somebody else
[1:31:01] and he would tell him who they were for
[1:31:03] and what now go tell them
[1:31:05] [Music]
[1:31:08] I still I believe he's still the same
[1:31:10] yesterday today and forever
[1:31:14] now
[1:31:16] I've been with my wife while she's
[1:31:18] bearing children but I didn't go through
[1:31:20] what she went through
[1:31:22] and some of you have
[1:31:24] if you've had children
[1:31:26] she's going through a hard time
[1:31:27] [Music]
[1:31:30] so if you all stand with me
[1:31:36] you sisters that know
[1:31:40] I was going to ask my wife to come up
[1:31:42] and stand here but let's not do it this
[1:31:43] way just where you're at
[1:31:46] you could be touched by the feeling of
[1:31:48] her infirmity
[1:31:50] while we pray
[1:31:51] her name is Kathy
[1:31:53] we know what God
[1:31:56] it's a miracle working God
[1:32:00] chicani is
[1:32:09] just by our hands
[1:32:14] Lord you you know every situation
[1:32:19] my sisters it's a little more personal
[1:32:21] because it's my sister today but she's
[1:32:24] one of yours
[1:32:27] she's in much pain right now much
[1:32:29] discomfort
[1:32:31] the doctors have done three surgeries
[1:32:33] now on her
[1:32:35] there's been complications with them
[1:32:40] I told her we would pray and she said
[1:32:42] please
[1:32:43] she knows you to be a Healer
[1:32:47] she was at the point of death not too
[1:32:49] long ago
[1:32:52] they brought her to the hospital they
[1:32:53] didn't give her much hope
[1:32:57] dad was there
[1:33:00] he was holding her hand praying she had
[1:33:02] had no response at all
[1:33:06] and suddenly she squeezed his hand
[1:33:11] we were out of town and dad called he
[1:33:13] said she just squeezed my hand God has
[1:33:16] heard
[1:33:17] we know you're a living God
[1:33:20] [Music]
[1:33:21] there's some Lord sisters here that are
[1:33:25] are standing in her place today
[1:33:27] and believing Lord so we just ask
[1:33:30] even now Lord
[1:33:32] that that healing virtue would float
[1:33:34] through her body
[1:33:36] and make her well
[1:33:38] and not only to her but anything is
[1:33:40] under the sound of my voice today who
[1:33:43] have a need
[1:33:45] a medical need right now Lord they could
[1:33:47] receive their healing
[1:33:48] [Music]
[1:33:49] that's because you are Jesus Christ the
[1:33:51] same yesterday today and forever
[1:33:55] so Lord we thank you for that
