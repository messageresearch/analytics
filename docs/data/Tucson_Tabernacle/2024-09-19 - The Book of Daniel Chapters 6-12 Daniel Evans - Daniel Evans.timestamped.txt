[32:31] Daniel The Book of Daniel has been just
[32:36] it's tremendous people have dedicated
[32:39] their lives theologians have dedicated
[32:41] their lives to studying this book and um
[32:44] it is it's just it's one of the most
[32:48] tremendous Pro books of Prophecy and
[32:51] interesting books that you will ever
[32:53] read in your whole life um so tonight
[32:57] tonight what we will do is if the Lord's
[33:00] willing we will finish up uh The Book of
[33:04] Daniel we'll start in Daniel chapter 6
[33:08] and then from chapter 6 to chapter 7
[33:12] it's uh the book changes the first half
[33:15] of the book is prophecy and dreams but
[33:18] it's mainly stories about Daniel and
[33:20] about Babylon and and about the
[33:22] different
[33:23] Kings and then in chapters 7 through 12
[33:27] it Chang changes to more along the
[33:29] feeling of Jeremiah or Ezekiel or Isaiah
[33:34] where it just becomes a book that's just
[33:36] full of Prophecy one of the things about
[33:39] Daniel that is really amazing more than
[33:42] any other book of Prophecy in the Bible
[33:45] is that a lot of Daniel you can really
[33:47] nail down to this was the Fulfillment of
[33:52] that prophecy and in fact here's the
[33:54] person that fulfilled it like we talked
[33:57] about a believers in Daniel chapter 2
[33:59] when Nebuchadnezzar had his dream and
[34:01] and he had the head of gold and then the
[34:03] silver and then bronze and all the way
[34:05] down to iron we see that was first it
[34:09] was fulfilled with the head of gold with
[34:12] Nebuchadnezzar and then the next was a
[34:16] less valuable smaller was uh silver was
[34:20] the mes and Persians it even says that
[34:24] that happens that that way and then we
[34:26] see the Greeks come in which which
[34:27] hasn't happened yet in this book with
[34:31] Alexander the Great and and how he
[34:34] conquers the world and then finally
[34:36] these legs of iron
[34:40] hard metal and that was the Roman
[34:44] Empire very very plain and much of
[34:47] Daniel and uh and just deep but I I do
[34:52] have to always throw out a warning there
[34:55] is the Book of Daniel has produced
[34:58] some uh
[35:00] really um overly religious spirits and
[35:05] trying to understand this book trying to
[35:08] pin it down to the exact year the exact
[35:12] time and really if you add up all of the
[35:16] years it's easy to try to do that so
[35:20] just in a warning with Daniel it's it's
[35:23] a wonderfully prophetic book it's a
[35:25] beautiful book but just be careful about
[35:28] going too far with this book and with
[35:31] the prophecies remember just keep your
[35:33] balance in the scriptures follow follow
[35:37] the the the teachings but as I said we
[35:42] have seen some real fanaticisms and I'm
[35:44] sure all of us have in trying to take
[35:46] this Book of Daniel and interpret it and
[35:49] say this is how many years and here's
[35:52] the year that it's going to happen
[35:54] people have done that um for a long time
[35:58] so let's go let's let's turn um to
[36:01] Daniel let's start with the very end of
[36:03] chapter five Daniel chapter 5 verse 30
[36:08] and it'll give us a little foundation so
[36:10] we know that uh the the Hebrews have
[36:13] already been they've been thrown in the
[36:14] fiery furnace we know that that
[36:16] Nebuchadnezzar was a man a high-tempered
[36:18] king and a very very powerful King very
[36:22] um and his his Reign just just went
[36:25] through the whole world and we know that
[36:29] he uh let the kingdom then went to his
[36:32] son
[36:34] Bazar and they were drinking and
[36:37] partying one night and they disrespected
[36:41] the vessels and disrespected God's
[36:44] ordinances from the temple and that's
[36:47] when the handwriting on the wall came up
[36:50] and uh Bazar his KN his knees knocked
[36:55] together and it was that very night as
[36:59] that handwriting was on the wall that an
[37:02] alliance between the mes and the
[37:06] Persians there was an invading Army that
[37:09] came from them and uh they probably
[37:12] history would say that that they waited
[37:15] through the river and underneath the
[37:18] walls where the water came underneath
[37:20] the walls of Babylon and the Army snuck
[37:22] in under the cover of Darkness
[37:24] underneath the walls through the river
[37:27] and then they they came up and then they
[37:28] conquered this really unconquerable city
[37:32] called Babylon and uh that was the night
[37:36] that Bazar was killed Daniel
[37:41] stayed and uh this man dasas the me took
[37:45] over Daniel chapter
[37:47] 5 verse
[37:51] 30 says
[37:56] this says
[37:58] and in that night Bazar the king of the
[38:02] caldan was
[38:04] slain the king of the caldan slain and
[38:08] daras the median took the kingdom being
[38:11] about three score and two years old so
[38:14] he's 62 years old when this man
[38:17] dasas took over Babylon became the ruler
[38:20] now he was a joint ruler with with
[38:22] Persia and we're going to hear the
[38:25] mention of this man Cyrus later on who
[38:27] was who was the King of Persia at the
[38:30] time um so times passed passes between
[38:35] this Invasion and when they take over
[38:38] and Daniel is he's a great man and
[38:42] wherever he was and whatever he did he
[38:43] succeeded he was he must have been a
[38:46] very honest man a very capable leader
[38:49] and uh he he was just he just did well
[38:52] in everything that he set his heart to
[38:54] do and one thing that we see with Daniel
[38:57] and you see in the in the previous
[38:58] chapters that Daniel even though he
[39:01] lived in Babylon and even though he was
[39:04] successful in Babylon he still didn't
[39:08] partake in the sins of Babylon he didn't
[39:11] eat the King's food he didn't partake in
[39:14] the idolatry we see that in his
[39:16] influence on Shadrach mhach and abedo
[39:19] and we see that Daniel he stood up for
[39:22] what's right but he was still very
[39:25] successful in the world that he lived in
[39:28] and it goes to show you that Daniel
[39:30] actually was elevated and we'll read
[39:32] here shortly he was elevated to a very
[39:34] powerful political de um position and
[39:39] I've heard sometimes that
[39:42] Christians that they should stay out of
[39:46] politics and I think well that sounds
[39:49] good but like Daniel lived in
[39:53] Babylon we live in this world
[39:58] and we need to make a difference in this
[40:00] world as Daniel made a difference in
[40:03] Babylon Babylon
[40:05] prospered the mes and the Persians
[40:07] prospered because of Daniel's strong
[40:10] leadership and his Godly way even though
[40:14] he wasn't he didn't partake in their
[40:16] sins he still lived under their laws and
[40:19] still did a good job and and he still
[40:22] helped the country so with Christians
[40:25] we're part of this country
[40:28] so we should also influence as much as
[40:31] we can this country as Daniel did
[40:35] whether it be with our voting whether it
[40:37] be with our communities or whatever it
[40:39] is we have a role to play in this world
[40:43] it's not in the Bible but we've heard it
[40:46] said that we
[40:49] are in this world but not of this world
[40:54] and it's the same here with Daniel
[40:56] Daniel lived in Babylon he was a
[40:59] Babylonian he was like an American
[41:01] citizen and he helped the country but he
[41:05] amazingly he kept his
[41:07] testimony Daniel chapter 6 verse
[41:13] one remember dasas was the one who
[41:17] invaded took over the country it pleased
[41:20] dasas to set Darius daras however you
[41:24] want to pronounce it it pleased daras to
[41:26] set over the kingdom
[41:28] 120 princes which should be over the
[41:31] whole Kingdom again these are political
[41:33] appointees by the king and over these
[41:36] three presidents of whom Daniel was
[41:41] first that the princes might give
[41:43] account unto them and the King should
[41:46] have no
[41:48] damage then this Daniel was preferred
[41:51] above the presidents and the princes
[41:53] because he because an excellent spirit
[41:57] Spirit was in him and the King thought
[42:00] to set him over the whole realm So
[42:03] Daniel is a top ruler now in this
[42:07] Kingdom of Babylon what's replaced
[42:09] Babylon and he is as he as I said he's
[42:13] doing he's living outside of his
[42:15] homeland he was a very young man when he
[42:18] was taken out of of Jerusalem out of
[42:20] Judea and brought there but he's still
[42:23] living a good life he's still prospering
[42:26] he's still honest and and the rulers of
[42:28] the country and this King saw how great
[42:31] of a man this Daniel was so he promoted
[42:34] him to a very very important position
[42:37] one of the very very top
[42:39] positions then the presidents and the
[42:41] princes sought to find occasion against
[42:44] Daniel concerning the kingdom but they
[42:47] could find none occasion nor fault for
[42:50] as much as he was faithful neither was
[42:53] there any error found in him people
[42:58] people we
[43:00] see that people wanted to bring Daniel
[43:06] down because he set such a good example
[43:10] because he overcame The Temptations of
[43:12] Babylon did you ever see when you want
[43:14] to start living right and maybe the
[43:17] people that you're around you make
[43:19] changes in your life you get rid of
[43:21] something that you used to do you're
[43:23] trying to come to church more often
[43:24] you're trying you're trying to live
[43:27] better and do you see how sometimes
[43:29] people first thing they say is who do
[43:31] you think you are
[43:35] self-righteous you think you're better
[43:37] than me and you never said you're better
[43:39] than anybody you're just trying to serve
[43:41] the Lord but do you see how people will
[43:43] come against you because you are trying
[43:46] to serve God I'm sure all of us have
[43:48] been
[43:49] there and they say you know who do you
[43:51] think you are and what they do what they
[43:53] want to do is now you're doing better
[43:55] and I can't think of any other reason
[43:59] that they put you down other than pure
[44:02] jealousy because you're doing better and
[44:05] they don't want to do what you're doing
[44:08] they want
[44:10] Babylon they want the world so they will
[44:14] put you down for it and the green
[44:18] monster Wells up within them as happened
[44:22] right
[44:24] here I'll say it again verse number and
[44:27] the presidents and the princes sought to
[44:29] find occasion against Daniel concerning
[44:31] the kingdom but they could find none
[44:33] occasion nor fault for as much as he was
[44:36] faithful neither was there any error or
[44:39] fault found in
[44:41] him then said these
[44:44] men we shall not find any occasion
[44:47] against against this Daniel except we
[44:50] find it against him concerning the law
[44:54] of his God
[44:57] so maybe if you're living a good life
[45:00] you're living a life above reproach
[45:03] maybe they might see something in you
[45:05] it's okay I can't attack brother Jeremy
[45:09] maybe I will attack his religion or his
[45:12] church or what he believes and then that
[45:16] way I can bring him down to my
[45:22] level then these presidents and princes
[45:24] assembled together to the king and said
[45:27] thus unto him King
[45:29] dasas live
[45:31] forever all the presidents of the
[45:33] kingdom and the governors and the
[45:35] princes and the counselors and the
[45:36] captains have consulted together to
[45:38] establish a royal statute and to make a
[45:41] firm decree that whosoever shall ask a
[45:44] petition of any God or man for 30 days
[45:48] save of thee O King he shall be cast
[45:51] into the Den of Lions so right now
[45:55] they're playing on the king's V
[45:58] ity and possibly playing on his
[46:03] insecurities so the King was basically a
[46:07] God and when you were a totalitarian
[46:12] dictator like that like um like we see
[46:15] we've seen in Stalin and in Hitler and
[46:18] and even in like North Korea the the guy
[46:21] there they hate religion because they
[46:26] can't control
[46:28] it and the the main thing with them is
[46:31] they are quick to condemn anything that
[46:35] is outside their sphere of
[46:38] influence so if they're if if they're
[46:41] not in control they're fine with
[46:42] religion as long as they can control the
[46:44] religion but if you get outside of that
[46:47] sphere of influence that is when this
[46:51] dictator or this narcissist or whatever
[46:54] it is it will lash out
[46:57] because you're outside of his
[47:00] control and here there and it's because
[47:03] it's an
[47:04] insecurity and some of these these
[47:07] dictators the the most powerful
[47:08] dictators are some of the most insecure
[47:10] people that you ever that you oversee
[47:13] they're so afraid they're dominated by
[47:15] fear they're dominated that their this
[47:18] fear they're always thinking that
[47:20] someone's gonna come and take their
[47:22] Kingdom
[47:23] away so these people are smart when they
[47:26] come to dasas and they're saying hey
[47:30] King they're worshiping other people
[47:32] maybe they're worshiping other gods
[47:35] you're the God dasas why don't you make
[47:38] a
[47:39] decree so that no one for this 30 days
[47:42] that they're not allowed to look to
[47:44] anyone else except you King you're the
[47:46] great one you're the smart one and they
[47:49] had ulterior
[47:53] motives now now oh King establish the
[47:56] decree and sign the writing that it be
[47:59] not changed according to the law of the
[48:02] mes and the Persians which alter it not
[48:05] so the key here is when the king signed
[48:07] a decree even he
[48:10] himself according to the law of the mes
[48:12] and Persians could not change it it was
[48:16] a law and even the king himself was
[48:20] subject to that
[48:25] law wherefore King dasas signed the
[48:29] writing and the
[48:30] decree now when Daniel knew that the
[48:33] writing was signed he went into his
[48:35] house so Daniel who's a who's a ruler
[48:39] here he's he's watching all this and he
[48:42] knows the decree he knows what's going
[48:44] to happen and then the King goes and
[48:48] these guys trick him into signing
[48:52] it so Daniel watches and it says right
[48:55] here when he knew that the writing was
[49:00] signed he went into his
[49:03] house and his windows being open in his
[49:07] chamber toward Jerusalem he kneeled down
[49:11] upon his knees three times a day and
[49:15] prayed and gave thanks before his God as
[49:19] he did
[49:21] before there's a time to follow the law
[49:23] of the
[49:25] land as Jesus said said when they asked
[49:28] him if they should pay taxes Jesus said
[49:30] give to Caesar what Caesars follow the
[49:34] law and Daniel he had followed the law
[49:36] he had enforced the law of the land but
[49:39] here is something this raised above the
[49:43] law of the land and this was preventing
[49:46] Daniel from worshiping in the way that
[49:49] pleased God and Daniel said no and
[49:52] Daniel broke the law not only did he
[49:55] break the law
[49:57] he opened up his windows so everyone
[50:00] could see and prayed out there so
[50:03] everyone knew
[50:04] it he wasn't going to be he wasn't going
[50:07] to go into his closet on this one and
[50:09] pray in secret he was going to say
[50:11] listen I don't believe in this this is
[50:14] wrong I am protesting that this decree
[50:18] has gone forth no way I stand for my God
[50:23] so he gets out there in front of
[50:25] everyone and he prays after he knew that
[50:29] the writing was signed and you notice
[50:32] they knew where he was going to be in
[50:34] the
[50:35] building because do you remember when
[50:37] Solomon dedicated the temple way back in
[50:41] our Bible study and you remember what he
[50:43] prayed he said Lord no matter where they
[50:46] are in the world if they will just look
[50:49] towards this Temple which is in
[50:51] Jerusalem and they will pray then you
[50:54] will answer th their prayers and here is
[50:57] Daniel he remembered even though the
[50:59] temple was torn down Daniel still
[51:01] pointed himself towards that Temple
[51:06] according to the word of God and
[51:09] prayed
[51:11] beautiful then these men assembled and
[51:14] found Daniel praying and making
[51:16] supplications before his God it's a bit
[51:19] of an understatement they knew where he
[51:21] was going to be they knew which
[51:23] direction he was going to be pointing
[51:25] they knew what was going to happen
[51:26] because they tricked the king into
[51:28] making this decree just to get Daniel
[51:31] because Daniel was such a good man was
[51:33] so successful they had to bring him down
[51:36] so they knew they were
[51:41] watching I'll read it again then these
[51:43] men assembled and found Daniel praying
[51:45] and making supplication before his God
[51:47] then they came near and spake before the
[51:49] king concerning the king's decree hast
[51:51] thou signed a decree
[51:54] King that every man that hath a that
[51:58] shall ask a petition of any God or man
[52:01] within 30 days except for you of course
[52:03] O King shall be cast into the Den of
[52:06] Lions the king answered and said this
[52:09] thing is true according to the law of
[52:11] the mes and Persians which alth not
[52:13] which can't change I signed it I made
[52:17] this
[52:18] decree so these guys set him
[52:23] up and he's about to find out about
[52:26] their
[52:28] deception and I'm sure all of us have
[52:32] been deceived or been set up by someone
[52:36] the old saying is fool me once shame on
[52:39] you fool me twice shame on
[52:42] me and here is the king and he realizes
[52:47] he's been
[52:48] duped I'm trying to trick
[52:51] someone into getting your way is a
[52:54] losing proposition
[52:57] going about something dishonestly like
[52:59] these men did it's the case with Daniel
[53:03] and it's the case today never try to get
[53:06] your way through deception you'll
[53:09] lose then answered then answered they
[53:13] and said before the king that Daniel
[53:16] which is of the children of the
[53:17] Captivity of Judah regardeth not thee O
[53:20] King nor the decree that thou has signed
[53:23] but maketh his position three times a
[53:25] day this guy not only is he
[53:28] disrespecting your law but he's doing it
[53:30] three times a day like he always
[53:37] has now
[53:39] Daniel right here as I said he is
[53:42] breaking the
[53:45] law but he's doing it because that law
[53:50] is preventing him from
[53:52] worshiping and there's a time when we
[53:54] break the law
[53:57] and it's not for our own good it's not
[53:59] for our own benefit it's not to get
[54:02] ahead of someone that time to break the
[54:05] law is when that law comes against
[54:08] God then the
[54:10] King when he heard these words was sore
[54:14] displeased with
[54:16] himself and set his heart on Daniel to
[54:19] deliver him and he labored to the going
[54:21] down of the sun to deliver him so he was
[54:23] probably going to all the judges and all
[54:25] the lawyers and ask of them listen I
[54:28] made this decree look at here it is I
[54:30] signed this but can we get out of this
[54:33] because this Daniel these guys tricked
[54:35] me I didn't know and the judges was like
[54:36] nah King you really you signed
[54:38] it it's it's law you you have to abide
[54:42] by it so all day long this king is going
[54:45] and he's trying to get out of this
[54:47] decree that he made and he
[54:51] can't so he did everything that he could
[54:58] and
[55:03] then these men assembled under the
[55:07] king and said unto the king know oh King
[55:11] that the law of the mes and Persians is
[55:14] that no decree nor stat nor statute
[55:16] which the king established may be
[55:19] changed then the king
[55:21] commanded he felt awful right now and
[55:24] you're going to see this this was
[55:27] probably the worst day of his
[55:29] life and he's thinking about Daniel he's
[55:32] like man oh
[55:35] man then King commanded and they brought
[55:39] Daniel and they cast him into the Den of
[55:41] Lions now the king spake and said unto
[55:44] Daniel thy God whom thou servest
[55:48] continually he will deliver thee so the
[55:51] king had done everything that he could
[55:53] Daniel had stood for the Lord and the
[55:55] King he raised it up he's like I can't
[55:58] do anything and when we can't do
[55:59] anything brothers and sisters when we do
[56:01] everything we can like this King did he
[56:04] exhausted to all possibilities and
[56:06] that's like a lot of times I see people
[56:08] and they just sit back and they say oh
[56:10] well I'm just waiting for God to do
[56:11] something in my life that is not
[56:13] scriptural even right here in this King
[56:15] he did everything that he could all the
[56:18] way to the going down of the sun he
[56:20] tried everything that he could do but
[56:22] there was a time when he says I can't do
[56:24] anything more Lord here it is but he
[56:29] tried we are required to do our best to
[56:33] try to get everything in in order and
[56:37] then when we can't do it anymore Lord
[56:39] here it
[56:42] is where we at verse
[56:45] number 16 and he casts them into the den
[56:49] of lions and he says that your God will
[56:52] deliver you and a stone was brought and
[56:55] laid upon the mouth of the den and the
[56:57] King sealed it with his own signant and
[56:59] with the signant of his Lords that
[57:01] purpose might not be changed concerning
[57:03] Daniel then the king went to his Palace
[57:06] and passed the night fasting neither
[57:08] were instruments of Music brought before
[57:10] him and his sleep went from him he was
[57:12] awake all night worrying about Daniel
[57:15] but let me tell you something else he
[57:17] was still a king and I'll
[57:20] bet doesn't say it here but I'll bet
[57:24] there were some thoughts about what I am
[57:26] going to do to those guys that tricked
[57:28] me when all of this is
[57:32] over then the king arose very early in
[57:35] the morning and went in haste into the
[57:38] den of lions and when he came to the den
[57:40] he cried with a lamentable voice unto
[57:43] Daniel and the King spake and said to
[57:46] Daniel oh Daniel servant of the Living
[57:49] God is thy God whom thou servest
[57:51] continually able to deliver thee from
[57:53] the Lions Imagine The Hope that he had
[57:56] in his heart this is going to be a
[57:58] miracle comes up to the stone says
[58:01] Daniel did God deliver
[58:04] you can you imagine how he felt when he
[58:07] when he heard oh King live forever and
[58:12] ever my God has sent his Angel and hath
[58:16] shut the lion's mouth that they have not
[58:19] hurt me for as much as before him innoc
[58:23] innocency was found in me and also
[58:25] before thee oh King have I done no hurt
[58:29] so he says King I'm
[58:31] innocent I didn't do anything wrong I
[58:34] didn't do anything against you
[58:36] King even though he broke the
[58:39] law Daniel stood with a clean heart and
[58:43] he was able to say and brothers and
[58:45] sisters this is so beautiful he was able
[58:47] to say I am innocent in this
[58:50] matter stand before those Lions walk in
[58:54] those Lions Den and see those hungry
[58:57] ravenous lions and him say I'm
[59:00] innocent I didn't do anything
[59:05] wrong then God sent an angel and
[59:08] protected him then the King was
[59:10] exceedingly glad for him and commanded
[59:13] that they should take Daniel up out of
[59:16] the den So Daniel was taken up out of
[59:18] the den and no matter of hurt was found
[59:21] upon him because he believed in his God
[59:26] you can underline that one in your
[59:28] Bible because Daniel believed in
[59:32] Jehovah and the King commanded and they
[59:35] brought those men which had accused
[59:37] Daniel listen let me stop right here so
[59:40] I have a friend he's a he was a colonel
[59:43] before he retired he was in Iraq and um
[59:47] so he would he would talk to some of the
[59:49] um some of the the Muslims while he was
[59:52] there and he would tell them stories and
[59:54] they knew the Bible very well but they
[59:56] didn't know the Book of Daniel for some
[59:58] reason they they didn't study that that
[1:00:01] book and he told them all the stories in
[1:00:04] the Bible and their favorite story that
[1:00:07] they that they had heard out that of
[1:00:10] anything that this brother told them was
[1:00:13] not that Daniel was saved from the
[1:00:16] Lions but that they fed his accusers to
[1:00:21] the
[1:00:23] Lions then was the king exceedingly glad
[1:00:26] for him and commanded that they should
[1:00:27] take
[1:00:28] Daniel up out of the den So Daniel was
[1:00:31] taken up out of the den and no manner of
[1:00:33] hurt was found was upon him because he
[1:00:36] believed in his God and the King
[1:00:37] commanded that they brought those men
[1:00:39] which had accused Daniel and they cast
[1:00:42] them into the Den of Lions them their
[1:00:44] children and their
[1:00:46] wives can you imagine what you would say
[1:00:48] to your
[1:00:50] husband you did
[1:00:52] what and their wives and the Li ions had
[1:00:56] the Mastery of them and break all of
[1:00:59] their bones in pieces orever they came
[1:01:03] out they came at the bottom of the
[1:01:06] den then King
[1:01:08] dasas wrote unto all the people Nations
[1:01:11] and languages that dwell in all the
[1:01:13] Earth peace be multiplied unto you
[1:01:15] here's another decree these kings are
[1:01:17] constantly making decrees they
[1:01:18] constantly make mistakes Daniel proves
[1:01:20] them wrong and then they say worship the
[1:01:22] god of Daniel over and over more and
[1:01:24] more decrees I make a decree that every
[1:01:27] Dominion of my kingdom men tremble and
[1:01:30] fear before the god of Daniel for he is
[1:01:32] the Living God and steadfast forever and
[1:01:36] his kingdom that which shall not be
[1:01:38] destroyed and his Dominion shall be even
[1:01:41] unto the end he delivereth and rescue
[1:01:44] with and he worketh signs and wonders in
[1:01:47] heaven and in Earth who hath delivered
[1:01:50] Daniel from the power of the Lions so
[1:01:52] this Daniel prospered in the reign of d
[1:01:56] and in the reign of Cyrus Cyrus the
[1:02:00] Persian now if we remember from our
[1:02:02] Bible
[1:02:03] study before that Cyrus is the one that
[1:02:07] released the Jews with zerubabel and
[1:02:11] then with uh Nehemiah and with with uh
[1:02:14] Ezra he's the one that that eventually
[1:02:17] released them to go and we're going to
[1:02:19] get to that here uh actually let's get
[1:02:21] to that right now um so we Chang now now
[1:02:26] the The Book of Daniel is split
[1:02:28] basically into two pieces the first six
[1:02:30] chapters first half of the book are
[1:02:32] these stories that we've gone through
[1:02:34] now and then the next six chapters are
[1:02:37] heavy
[1:02:38] prophecy and like I said Daniel really
[1:02:43] above all of them you can really dig
[1:02:46] into these because it's pretty easy to
[1:02:48] read and it's fairly easy to understand
[1:02:51] and it's just amazing so now
[1:02:54] Daniel we're going to going to go back
[1:02:56] and Daniel's an old man probably 85 90
[1:03:00] years
[1:03:02] old and he's been in
[1:03:06] Babylon
[1:03:08] since I don't know since he was probably
[1:03:11] 15 years old or so seven years old I
[1:03:13] forgot how how old he was when he came
[1:03:14] out but he's been in Babylon like about
[1:03:18] 68
[1:03:20] years and uh Daniel chapter 7 and 8 are
[1:03:25] prophecy es that I encourage you to read
[1:03:27] we don't have time to go through them
[1:03:28] we're just doing an overview here and
[1:03:31] let's go to chapter n chapter
[1:03:33] n is like in all the Bible it's huge as
[1:03:39] far as prophecy I mean it is as deep as
[1:03:43] they get so let's let's read it remember
[1:03:46] Daniel's an old
[1:03:48] man in the first year of
[1:03:51] dasas the son of hashiras the seed of
[1:03:55] the mes
[1:03:56] which was made King over the realm of
[1:03:58] the calans now remember this is the
[1:04:00] second Kingdom remember NE
[1:04:01] Nebuchadnezzar's dream as I said the
[1:04:03] head of gold was Nebuchadnezzar now
[1:04:05] we're in the second Kingdom the chest
[1:04:07] and the arms of silver in the first year
[1:04:10] of the reign of his Reign I
[1:04:13] Daniel understood by the books the
[1:04:16] number of years understood by books the
[1:04:20] number of years whereof the word of the
[1:04:22] Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that
[1:04:26] he would accomplish 70 years in
[1:04:28] desolations in
[1:04:31] Jerusalem so this is important so here's
[1:04:33] Daniel and he's reading his Bible he
[1:04:36] knows that Jeremiah as a prophet reading
[1:04:39] his Bible he's reading the
[1:04:41] Scrolls and he's reading these
[1:04:44] Prophecies of Jeremiah and like all of
[1:04:46] us it's like I don't understand maybe
[1:04:48] what's going on when I read many of
[1:04:50] these these books like Jeremiah and
[1:04:53] Ezekiel and and Isaiah and here Daniel
[1:04:56] is and he's got this great understanding
[1:04:58] and he
[1:04:59] looks and he
[1:05:01] sees 70
[1:05:03] years A Prophecy from Jeremiah saying
[1:05:07] this king is coming and we are then and
[1:05:10] our people are going to be in
[1:05:12] bondage for 70
[1:05:15] years Daniel's like I'm an old man now
[1:05:19] and it's been about 68 years since I was
[1:05:24] taken out he grew up he lived most of
[1:05:26] his life almost all of his life there in
[1:05:28] Babylon and now he sees whoa we are
[1:05:33] right
[1:05:34] there so what did he
[1:05:39] do and I set my face Daniel
[1:05:43] Prayed and I set my face unto the Lord
[1:05:46] God to seek by prayer and supplication
[1:05:49] with fasting and sackcloth and Ashes and
[1:05:52] I prayed unto the Lord my God and made
[1:05:55] my confession confession and said oh
[1:05:56] Lord the great and Dreadful God keeping
[1:05:59] the Covenant and mercy to them that love
[1:06:01] him and to them that keep his
[1:06:03] commandments so Daniel knows he sees
[1:06:05] that hey we're this is this is about to
[1:06:07] be fulfilled and what does he do he
[1:06:09] doesn't start jumping up and down saying
[1:06:10] Yahoo we're about to go home he gets on
[1:06:13] his
[1:06:14] knees and he starts
[1:06:17] praying and he starts confessing his
[1:06:20] sins and the sins of his
[1:06:24] people and I pray prayed unto the Lord
[1:06:26] my God and I made my confession and said
[1:06:28] Lord Oh Lord the great and Dreadful God
[1:06:31] keeping the Covenant and mercy to them
[1:06:33] that love him and to them that keep his
[1:06:35] Commandments we have
[1:06:38] sinned and have committed iniquity and
[1:06:40] have done wickedly and have rebelled
[1:06:42] even by departing from thy precepts and
[1:06:45] from thy judgments Daniel hadn't done
[1:06:47] that but he's confessing that his that
[1:06:50] his people had done
[1:06:53] that neither have we hearkened unto thy
[1:06:56] servants the
[1:06:58] prophets which spake in thy name to our
[1:07:02] Kings our princes and our fathers and to
[1:07:05] all the people of the land so here's
[1:07:08] Daniel and he's confessing all these
[1:07:10] things he's he he he's he's crying out
[1:07:13] to God for
[1:07:15] Mercy because he knows something big is
[1:07:18] about to happen and let's skip down to
[1:07:20] verse number 19 for time
[1:07:22] sake Daniel continues his prayer and he
[1:07:24] says oh Lord hear oh Lord
[1:07:29] forgive oh Lord hearken and do not defer
[1:07:32] and defer not for thy own sake oh my God
[1:07:35] for the city for thy City and thy people
[1:07:38] are called by thy name and while I was
[1:07:42] speaking and praying and confessing my
[1:07:45] sin and the sin of my people is the
[1:07:48] people the sin of My People Israel and
[1:07:50] presenting my supplication before the
[1:07:52] Lord my God for the Holy Mountain of my
[1:07:55] God
[1:07:56] yay whilst I was speaking in prayer even
[1:07:59] the man
[1:08:02] Gabriel whom I had seen in a vision at
[1:08:04] the beginning we have gone through that
[1:08:06] when he when he sees when he seen
[1:08:09] Gabriel earlier being caused to fly
[1:08:12] swiftly that was a couple chapters
[1:08:14] earlier I actually skipped over it being
[1:08:16] caused to fly swiftly touched me about
[1:08:20] the time of the evening
[1:08:24] oblation so he sees this Angel the
[1:08:27] evening
[1:08:29] oblation is the evening
[1:08:32] sacrifice the temple was shut down there
[1:08:35] was no
[1:08:36] more sacrifices going on in the temple
[1:08:39] there was there was no more of all this
[1:08:41] but still Daniel had remembered and was
[1:08:45] still honoring that and he says it's
[1:08:48] about the time of this evening
[1:08:53] oblation that he informed me and and
[1:08:55] talked with me and said oh Daniel I have
[1:08:58] now come forth to give thee skill and
[1:09:02] understanding at the beginning of thy
[1:09:04] supplications the Commandment came forth
[1:09:07] and I am come to show thee for thou art
[1:09:09] greatly beloved therefore understand the
[1:09:12] matter and consider the
[1:09:15] vision listen to
[1:09:17] this 70 weeks are determined upon thy
[1:09:22] people and upon thy Holy City
[1:09:26] to finish the
[1:09:27] transgression to make an end of sins and
[1:09:31] to make reconciliation for iniquity and
[1:09:33] to bring in Everlasting righteous
[1:09:35] righteousness and to seal up the vision
[1:09:38] and prophecy and to anoint the most holy
[1:09:42] I ask the church to listen to these
[1:09:44] sermons The Daniel Series this is the
[1:09:48] very Foundation of Gabriel's
[1:09:50] instructions to Daniel the first in the
[1:09:53] series right here sixfold purpose of
[1:09:58] Gabriel's instructions to
[1:10:00] Daniel and this is a timetable for these
[1:10:04] six things to be accomplished now if you
[1:10:06] listen to that sermon that I I
[1:10:09] recommended you will
[1:10:12] see
[1:10:14] that Hebrew is
[1:10:17] written and one week can me mean seven
[1:10:21] days or one week
[1:10:25] can
[1:10:25] [Music]
[1:10:27] mean seven
[1:10:30] years so
[1:10:32] here this prophecy very plainly one week
[1:10:38] equals seven years and if you listen to
[1:10:41] the sermon you know that even as the
[1:10:45] congregation repeat one week equals
[1:10:47] seven
[1:10:49] years
[1:10:51] so
[1:10:53] 7times 7
[1:10:57] one week equals 7 years equals
[1:11:01] 490 years I'm not going to even attempt
[1:11:05] to break it down but it's it's pretty
[1:11:08] simple this has nothing to do with the
[1:11:11] 70 years of
[1:11:13] Jeremiah this is a different prophecy
[1:11:17] this has not occurred yet as when Daniel
[1:11:21] is speaking so we have this
[1:11:25] 490
[1:11:27] years that are going to happen and if
[1:11:30] you
[1:11:33] look
[1:11:34] most
[1:11:36] believe that 40 that um 69 of those
[1:11:41] weeks were accomplished and if again if
[1:11:44] you listen to the sermons 69 of those
[1:11:46] weeks were accomplished until the coming
[1:11:50] of Christ and it's very specific almost
[1:11:53] to the day
[1:11:55] when Jesus most most Scholars most
[1:11:58] theologians think when Jesus wrote in to
[1:12:00] Jerusalem as a triumphant King that
[1:12:04] completed the 49 weeks or the um I'm
[1:12:08] sorry the uh 69
[1:12:12] weeks but then there were and I'm gonna
[1:12:17] okay I'm going to give you some message
[1:12:19] Doctrine here this is going to be messes
[1:12:21] brother brandom said in in the 70 weeks
[1:12:23] of Daniel if you've listened if you
[1:12:24] listen to him he said that there were
[1:12:27] seven years left to be
[1:12:30] accomplished and those seven years would
[1:12:34] happen after so what happened was this
[1:12:37] this 69 weeks had been accomplished to
[1:12:40] Jesus it left a portion of time there
[1:12:43] was is What's called the Gentile
[1:12:45] dispensation you've heard that before
[1:12:47] God is
[1:12:49] dispensing the message of Jesus Christ
[1:12:52] to these gentile people who have never
[1:12:55] been part of anything before and now
[1:12:58] it's their turn so he blinds the
[1:13:01] eyes of his children his the Jews and
[1:13:05] then he gives the gospel to the Gentiles
[1:13:10] and that's not numbered but we have
[1:13:12] about 2,000 years since that has
[1:13:14] happened and then we have still we have
[1:13:17] a time period left brother brandom said
[1:13:20] in um in one of these one of these three
[1:13:23] sermons he said that there are seven
[1:13:25] years left but then he came back in
[1:13:28] questions and answers later on and he
[1:13:30] said no three and a half years there's
[1:13:32] only a half a week left three and a half
[1:13:34] years were fulfilled in Jesus's Ministry
[1:13:36] and there's three and a half years
[1:13:38] left okay I don't
[1:13:41] care one way or the other you know why I
[1:13:43] don't care because when that that time
[1:13:46] starts ticking the Gentile bride is gone
[1:13:49] the tribulation start I'm not going to
[1:13:51] be here I don't care if it's seven years
[1:13:53] or three and a half years doesn't matter
[1:13:54] one bit to me
[1:13:56] so some one of those ridiculous
[1:13:59] arguments
[1:14:00] that message theologians have got in
[1:14:03] over the years that mean absolutely zero
[1:14:06] mean
[1:14:07] nothing where where are we verse number
[1:14:11] 25 know therefore and understand that
[1:14:14] from the going forth of the Commandment
[1:14:16] to restore and to build Jerusalem unto
[1:14:18] the Messiah the prince shall be seven
[1:14:20] weeks and three score and two weeks the
[1:14:24] street shall be built again and the wall
[1:14:26] even in Troublesome times and after
[1:14:29] three score and two weeks shall the
[1:14:30] Messiah be cut off but not for himself
[1:14:33] that word cut off the Messiah shall be
[1:14:36] killed but look how
[1:14:39] beautiful but not for
[1:14:44] himself how awesome is Jesus
[1:14:48] Christ he'll be cut
[1:14:51] off but has no self-serving motive of at
[1:14:55] all it was for someone else it was for
[1:14:58] the guy standing in the Pulpit right
[1:15:00] now and all of you all
[1:15:03] too and the
[1:15:05] people of the prince shall come that
[1:15:09] shall come shall destroy the city and
[1:15:10] the sanctuary and the end thereof shall
[1:15:13] shall be with a flood and unto the end
[1:15:16] of the war desolations are
[1:15:18] determined so the Messiah shall be cut
[1:15:21] off he was crucified he was killed but
[1:15:23] not for himself and he shall confirm the
[1:15:25] Covenant with many for one week and in
[1:15:28] the midst of the
[1:15:29] week he shall cause the sacrifice and
[1:15:32] the oblation to cease and for the
[1:15:34] overspreading of Abominations he shall
[1:15:36] make desolate even until the
[1:15:39] consummation and that determined shall
[1:15:42] be poured upon the
[1:15:45] desolate so thus we have the close of
[1:15:47] Daniel 9 as I said one of really the
[1:15:50] most
[1:15:51] incredible chapters of Prophecy in the
[1:15:54] entire Bible you can read it over and
[1:15:56] over and over as I said you can get out
[1:15:57] your calculator and you can you can add
[1:16:00] everything up and and really I I will
[1:16:02] say this there there is a time of this
[1:16:04] Gentile dispensation but I think
[1:16:07] whatever you come up
[1:16:09] with that we can see that the time we
[1:16:11] are living in is close to the end we
[1:16:15] really are and if you look at this Book
[1:16:17] of Daniel I don't believe I really don't
[1:16:21] believe that God would have put it in
[1:16:23] here if he didn't want us to understand
[1:16:26] it I don't think he wants to confuse us
[1:16:30] he put it in here so we can study it so
[1:16:32] we can work these things out and like I
[1:16:34] said whatever you come up with you'll
[1:16:36] never know the day you'll never know the
[1:16:40] you'll never know when he's coming in
[1:16:43] fact when somebody says lo here is the
[1:16:44] Christ then you say h no Jesus warned us
[1:16:48] not to listen to you but you can look
[1:16:52] and you can see that this time is late
[1:16:57] and let's go to
[1:16:58] Daniel let's skip on down to Daniel
[1:17:02] chapter
[1:17:09] 12 for time
[1:17:12] sake and
[1:17:16] before we read Daniel 12 Let's uh let's
[1:17:20] turn to Revelation chapter 6
[1:17:33] you guys know what Revelation 6
[1:17:36] is the seven the six
[1:17:39] seals seven seven seal is Revelation
[1:17:42] chapter 8 Revelation chapter 6 is these
[1:17:45] famous and controversial Seven Seals
[1:17:49] Revelation 6 verse1 just kind of load
[1:17:53] this in the data banks
[1:17:56] and I saw when the lamb had opened one
[1:17:58] of the seals and I heard as it were the
[1:18:01] noise of thunder and one of the four
[1:18:03] beasts saying come and see and I saw and
[1:18:06] behold a white horse and he that sat on
[1:18:08] him had a bow and a crown was given unto
[1:18:10] him and when he when and he went forth
[1:18:13] conquering and to conquer and when he
[1:18:15] had heard when he had opened the second
[1:18:17] seal I heard the second beast say come
[1:18:19] and see and there went out another horse
[1:18:23] that was red and power was given unto
[1:18:26] him that sat there on to take peace from
[1:18:29] the earth that they should kill one
[1:18:31] another and there was given unto him a
[1:18:34] great
[1:18:35] sword and when he had opened the third
[1:18:37] seal I heard the third Beast say come
[1:18:39] and
[1:18:40] see and behold and lo a black horse and
[1:18:43] he that sat on him had a pair of
[1:18:44] balances in his hand and he and I Heard
[1:18:47] a Voice in the midst of the four beasts
[1:18:51] say a measure of wheat for a penny and
[1:18:52] three measures of barley for a penny and
[1:18:55] see thou hurt not the oil and the wine
[1:18:59] and when he had opened the fourth seal I
[1:19:01] heard and the voice of the forth Beast
[1:19:03] say come and see and I looked and behold
[1:19:06] a Pale Horse and his name that sat on
[1:19:09] him was death and Hell Followed With Him
[1:19:12] and power was given unto him over the
[1:19:14] fourth part of the earth to kill with a
[1:19:16] sword and with hunger and with death and
[1:19:19] with the Beast of the
[1:19:20] earth and when he had opened the fifth
[1:19:23] seal I saw under the altar alter The
[1:19:25] Souls of them that were slain for the
[1:19:28] word of God and for the testimony which
[1:19:30] they held and they cried with the loud
[1:19:33] voice saying how long oh Lord holy and
[1:19:35] true do thou not judge and avenge our
[1:19:38] blood on them that dwell on the earth
[1:19:40] and the white robes were given un unto
[1:19:42] every one of them and it was said unto
[1:19:44] them that they should rest yet for a
[1:19:46] little season until their fellow
[1:19:48] servants also and their Brethren as
[1:19:51] should be killed that as they were
[1:19:53] should be fulfilled
[1:19:55] and I beheld and when he had opened the
[1:19:57] stick seal and lo there was a great
[1:19:59] earthquake and the sun became black as
[1:20:01] sackcloth and the moon became as blood
[1:20:04] and the stars of the heaven fell under
[1:20:05] the Earth even as a fig tree cast her
[1:20:08] untimely figs and when she when she is
[1:20:11] shaken of A Mighty Wind and the heaven
[1:20:13] departed as a scroll when it is rolled
[1:20:16] together and every mountain and Island
[1:20:19] were moved out of their places and the
[1:20:21] kings of the earth and great men and
[1:20:23] rich men and cheap captains and mighty
[1:20:25] men and every Bond Man and every free
[1:20:27] man hid themselves in the in the dens
[1:20:29] and in the rocks of the mountains and
[1:20:31] said un the mountains and the Rocks fall
[1:20:33] on us and hide us from the face of him
[1:20:36] that sth on the throne and from the
[1:20:38] Wrath of the lamb for the day for the
[1:20:42] great day of his wrath is come who shall
[1:20:45] be able to
[1:20:49] stand Daniel chapter 12 says this
[1:20:54] and at that time shall Michael stand up
[1:20:59] the great Prince which standeth for the
[1:21:00] children of thy people and there shall
[1:21:03] be a time of trouble such as never was
[1:21:06] since there was a nation even to that
[1:21:08] same time and at that time thy people
[1:21:11] shall be delivered everyone that shall
[1:21:13] be found written in the
[1:21:15] book this is just before the
[1:21:19] end and many of them that sleep in the
[1:21:22] dust of the Earth shall awake some
[1:21:24] everlasting life and some to shame and
[1:21:27] everlasting
[1:21:30] contempt this I believe is the first
[1:21:32] mention of everlasting life in the
[1:21:36] Bible and they that be wise shall shine
[1:21:40] as the brightness of the fent and they
[1:21:42] that turn many to righteousness as the
[1:21:45] Stars forever and
[1:21:47] ever look at that for a
[1:21:49] minute and they that be wise shall sign
[1:21:53] as the bright ESS of the Firmin and they
[1:21:56] that turn many to
[1:21:59] righteousness as the
[1:22:01] Stars forever and ever so he's he's
[1:22:06] saying here that those that really shine
[1:22:09] are those that are
[1:22:11] introducing others to the light of the
[1:22:15] Gospel really they're the ones that are
[1:22:17] leading other souls to the Lord says
[1:22:21] right here in the Book of
[1:22:23] Daniel that that they are the ones that
[1:22:26] turn many to
[1:22:28] righteousness as the Stars forever and
[1:22:33] ever but thou oh Daniel shut up the
[1:22:37] words and seal up the
[1:22:38] book even to the time of the
[1:22:41] end many shall run to and fro and
[1:22:44] knowledge shall be increased think about
[1:22:48] that prophecy for a minute many shall
[1:22:50] run to and
[1:22:51] fro and knowledge shall be
[1:22:55] increased this
[1:22:59] month let me
[1:23:02] uh this
[1:23:04] month I have gone to Hawaii Oakland Los
[1:23:08] Angeles Las Vegas Phoenix
[1:23:11] Flagstaff and
[1:23:16] Ikea that's like a
[1:23:18] city just me just in the past
[1:23:22] month that's where I've gone
[1:23:24] how was that
[1:23:26] possible before how has that been
[1:23:29] possible in all of history until this
[1:23:33] modern
[1:23:34] day that I can fly from
[1:23:37] Tucson to Oakland to Hawaii back to
[1:23:42] Oakland to Las Vegas to Tucson and then
[1:23:45] next
[1:23:46] week I'm I'm flying to um Atlanta and
[1:23:52] then I'm going to Nashville and then I'm
[1:23:54] I'm flying Atlanta again back to Tucson
[1:23:57] and then I'm driving up to
[1:23:59] Pinetop and then back
[1:24:01] down all over the place and literally
[1:24:04] this is in two months time a month and a
[1:24:06] half of time going to and fro all over
[1:24:09] the place that was never possible in the
[1:24:12] history of the
[1:24:13] world I mean how long did it take from
[1:24:16] Paul or for Paul to get to I don't know
[1:24:20] from Antioch to uh to um
[1:24:25] Tarsus you know or or to
[1:24:28] Jerusalem long time it took him to to to
[1:24:32] cross the Mediterranean and and and all
[1:24:35] of that but here I did all
[1:24:38] that I don't know what is it 5,000 miles
[1:24:41] away 4,000 miles away to uh maybe 4,000
[1:24:45] 3,000 miles away to Hawaii I did it in
[1:24:47] like a few hours six hours to and fro
[1:24:52] everywhere and not knowledge shall
[1:24:57] increase I look this up
[1:25:00] today and the copper age so so working
[1:25:06] of metal the copper age
[1:25:09] started about
[1:25:13] um 5,000 years ago so they started being
[1:25:16] able to make metal about 5,000 years ago
[1:25:20] then another Thousand Years passed pass
[1:25:25] before they were able to make another
[1:25:26] metal that was just a little bit harder
[1:25:28] called
[1:25:29] bronze another thousand years it took
[1:25:32] him to get that and then wait another
[1:25:34] 1,500
[1:25:36] years for
[1:25:38] iron this hard metal to
[1:25:42] use so we're looking
[1:25:45] for 2500 years to go from shaping copper
[1:25:50] to shaping iron that's 500 years longer
[1:25:54] than it is from here to Jesus
[1:25:57] back that's a long time really long
[1:26:03] time but listen to
[1:26:06] this the first telephone was installed
[1:26:09] in a house in 1879 you remember it was
[1:26:13] installed the White House the first
[1:26:16] telephone installed
[1:26:18] 1879 it wasn't until more than a hundred
[1:26:21] years later in the 1990s that became
[1:26:23] Main stream and everybody had a phone in
[1:26:26] their
[1:26:27] house for like over a hundred years and
[1:26:31] then in the
[1:26:32] 1990s that cell phones became
[1:26:36] mainstream about 20 years
[1:26:41] later
[1:26:43] 2007 the iPhone came along
[1:26:48] 2007 most people here were well into
[1:26:51] their life in 2007
[1:26:54] that wasn't that long ago that the
[1:26:56] iPhone came along then the next year
[1:26:59] about a year and a half later the iPhone
[1:27:01] 2 came out and that made it to where you
[1:27:04] can
[1:27:05] start surfing the internet and and and
[1:27:08] going all over
[1:27:10] efficiently like the iPhone 3G you
[1:27:13] remember that was that was the thing man
[1:27:15] even my son remembers that you know you
[1:27:19] were
[1:27:19] like you were an old kid when when the
[1:27:22] iPhones were there you're 5 years old
[1:27:25] when uh when the iPhone came out so my
[1:27:29] son Zeke you kids are are
[1:27:34] older than the smartphones and it seems
[1:27:37] like we've had them
[1:27:39] forever so it took 2500 years to go from
[1:27:42] copper to iron it took a hundred years
[1:27:45] to go from a house phone to a cell phone
[1:27:48] took 20 years to go from a cell phone to
[1:27:51] a smartphone and it took 15 years for
[1:27:54] this Smartphone to get to the point
[1:27:56] where it is now where it is part of our
[1:27:58] everyday life and we almost can't get by
[1:28:02] without this phone all of this
[1:28:06] happened in this short amount of time
[1:28:09] and I can ask brother Lyle I asked Siri
[1:28:14] today where you live and she told
[1:28:17] me yeah gave me your
[1:28:21] address knowledge shall increase
[1:28:25] whatever you want to know is right here
[1:28:28] and look at how fast it's happening it
[1:28:32] was thousands of
[1:28:34] years just to get a little bit better
[1:28:36] technology to make a just a little bit
[1:28:37] harder
[1:28:39] medal and now look at how fast things
[1:28:42] are going knowledge shall increased in
[1:28:43] the last days it's here there's there's
[1:28:47] no doubt we are
[1:28:50] there Den I Daniel looked and and behold
[1:28:54] there stood other two the one on this
[1:28:57] side of the bank of the river and the
[1:28:58] one on that side of the bank of the
[1:29:00] river he's in a vision and one said to
[1:29:02] the man clothed in linen which was upon
[1:29:05] the ri the Waters of the river how long
[1:29:07] shall it be to the end of these wonders
[1:29:10] and I heard a man clothed in linen which
[1:29:12] was upon the waters of the river and he
[1:29:14] held up his right hand and his left hand
[1:29:17] to heaven and swear by him that liveth
[1:29:19] forever and ever it shall be for a for a
[1:29:22] time times and a half time and when he
[1:29:26] shall and when he shall have
[1:29:27] accomplished to scatter the power of the
[1:29:30] holy of the Holy people all these things
[1:29:34] shall be finished very similar to
[1:29:36] Revelation chap 10 believe it's verse
[1:29:40] 6 you know what let's read it got it
[1:29:44] right here in my Bible I think it's
[1:29:45] Revelation
[1:29:46] 106 yeah right here Revelation 105 says
[1:29:50] this and the angel which I saw stand
[1:29:53] upon the sea and upon upon the Earth
[1:29:54] lifted up his hand to Heaven does it
[1:29:57] sound familiar to what I just read and
[1:29:59] swear by him that liveth forever and
[1:30:01] ever who created a heaven and the things
[1:30:03] that are therein there are and and the
[1:30:06] earth and the things that therein are
[1:30:08] and the Sea and and the things which are
[1:30:12] therein that there should be time no
[1:30:16] longer
[1:30:18] exactly right here almost verbatim from
[1:30:20] The Book of
[1:30:21] Daniel and I heard but I understood not
[1:30:26] then said I oh my Lord what shall be the
[1:30:30] end of these things and he said go thy
[1:30:32] Way Daniel for the words are closed up
[1:30:35] and sealed till the time of the end many
[1:30:38] shall be purified and made white and
[1:30:40] tried but the wicked shall do wickedly
[1:30:42] and none of the wicked shall understand
[1:30:44] it but the wise shall
[1:30:49] understand that's why we can pray like
[1:30:52] Daniel did Lord give me understanding of
[1:30:55] this book Lord give me understanding of
[1:30:58] these
[1:30:59] prophecies they were important to Daniel
[1:31:02] and they're important to us because now
[1:31:04] we're there we' have arrived as I said
[1:31:07] to and fro seems very plain that that's
[1:31:12] today no pun intended when I said plain
[1:31:16] but it's very clear that that that is
[1:31:19] today knowledge shall increase how can
[1:31:22] it get more
[1:31:24] than the little rectangular Idol that I
[1:31:27] keep in my pocket tells me everything I
[1:31:29] need to know and a lot
[1:31:35] more verse number
[1:31:37] 11 and from the time that the daily
[1:31:39] sacrifice shall be taken away and the
[1:31:42] Abomination that maketh desolate set up
[1:31:45] there shall be
[1:31:46] 1,290 days blessed is he that waiteth
[1:31:49] and cometh to the,
[1:31:52] 3530 days
[1:31:54] but go thou thy way till the end for
[1:31:57] Thou shalt rest and stand in thy lot at
[1:32:01] the end of the
[1:32:03] days thus we
[1:32:05] have the end I believe of the Book of
[1:32:09] Daniel
[1:32:11] and the musicians can come it's
[1:32:16] uh we don't have time to really dig in
[1:32:21] verse by verse and brothers and sisters
[1:32:23] nor do I really want to I um as I said
[1:32:27] many people have have D dug into it and
[1:32:30] then set a date or set a time or set a
[1:32:33] Doctrine I really I want the church to
[1:32:38] understand that if you add up all of
[1:32:40] these
[1:32:41] numbers it's
[1:32:43] late and it comes out to be around our
[1:32:48] time the time of the Gentile
[1:32:50] dispensation is
[1:32:52] closing Israel
[1:32:54] as
[1:32:55] prophesied it was 2,000
[1:32:59] years from the time that they were in
[1:33:01] Jerusalem and we had Herod there and and
[1:33:05] they were dispersed they they went out
[1:33:08] 2,000 years that that God has taken this
[1:33:11] gospel this Bible of Jesus Christ and
[1:33:14] given it to these heathens called
[1:33:18] Gentiles for 2,000 years we go through
[1:33:22] the ages in Revelation chap 2 and
[1:33:24] chapter 3 and then that time is
[1:33:27] scheduled to come to a close and when it
[1:33:31] closes the Jews as prophesied and
[1:33:35] brother Lyall and I have gone over it
[1:33:37] over and over again they're prophesy to
[1:33:40] come back to their Homeland to have
[1:33:44] their own country to have their own
[1:33:46] people to have their own Army to have
[1:33:50] God with them that has happened
[1:33:54] they're
[1:33:57] there these prophecies are coming to
[1:34:01] pass
[1:34:03] now if they haven't
[1:34:05] already many of
[1:34:08] them and we are right
[1:34:11] there you wonder why
[1:34:15] it's it is so
[1:34:17] important I go back to that that
[1:34:20] beautiful
[1:34:21] scripture let me see if I can find it
[1:34:27] it verse number
[1:34:30] three and they that be wise shall shine
[1:34:34] as the brightness of the firmament and
[1:34:37] they that turn many to righteousness as
[1:34:39] the Stars forever and
[1:34:42] ever they that turn many to
[1:34:46] righteousness Jesus Christ is that
[1:34:50] righteousness that's our job turn people
[1:34:53] the
[1:34:55] him and they'll they'll shine
[1:34:59] forever
