[30:48] to
[30:50] [Music]
[31:08] [Applause]
[31:12] [Music]
[31:16] such as i now wonder if paul
[31:31] he is me not to
[31:34] fill a servant's place
[31:46] of grace
[32:08] [Music]
[32:20] such love such wondrous
[32:31] [Music]
[32:39] no greater love that a man has that he
[32:42] would lay down his life for his friends
[32:45] and that he would call us his friends
[32:47] appreciate that
[32:50] it was a scripture in my heart and i
[32:53] didn't know
[32:55] to read it tonight but after that song i
[32:57] think we should malachi
[32:59] chapter 3 verse 16.
[33:02] and i was going through that whole
[33:04] chapter
[33:06] but it started with malachi 3 16 so
[33:10] let's just look at that for a moment
[33:12] then they that feared the lord spaked
[33:15] often one to another
[33:17] and the lord hearkened and heard it and
[33:20] a book of remembrance was written before
[33:22] him
[33:22] for them that feared the lord and that
[33:24] thought upon his name
[33:27] i just i just kept reading it over and
[33:29] over and i said what is our conversation
[33:32] what are our thoughts what are we
[33:33] thinking about
[33:35] and to think that that such love that
[33:37] god would love
[33:39] a sinner such as i how i ought to think
[33:42] about him how i ought to think about
[33:44] those he has redeemed
[33:45] those that he shed his blood for and
[33:48] then he says in a book of remembrance
[33:51] you know what did he say have you
[33:53] considered my servant job
[33:55] you know and he looks upon his children
[33:57] and he says the same thing have you
[33:59] considered my children
[34:01] i love them so i appreciate his grace
[34:03] and mercy
[34:05] good to know the lord these days when
[34:07] all that is happening
[34:09] and even better is to be known of god
[34:12] and he knows your name just a couple of
[34:16] things to bring to your attention
[34:17] [Music]
[34:19] i know it's a three-day weekend coming
[34:21] up and some folks are going to be out of
[34:22] town so if
[34:24] those that are traveling and i'll be out
[34:25] of town lord be with you
[34:27] keep you safe safe trip and time and
[34:29] enjoy your time off
[34:31] we'll meet here sunday and see what god
[34:33] has for us
[34:34] just um tonight we're going to listen to
[34:37] the message who is this
[34:40] preaching 59 brother branham back in
[34:43] jeffersonville and
[34:45] it's just a reminder as go as brother
[34:47] i'm a part of that
[34:48] that tape talks about things that god
[34:50] has done and made me think of
[34:52] of this god who's still alive never
[34:55] changes
[34:56] he's the same yesterday today and
[34:58] forever and he still does and act the
[35:00] same way if you if you could take him at
[35:02] his word
[35:04] brother brahm says that's how you know
[35:05] it's god because he keeps his word
[35:08] you know so my daughter rachel was
[35:12] getting over a cold so she wasn't here
[35:14] tonight she was feeling better and then
[35:18] my daughter abby said that asher and
[35:19] chloe had kind of been going through a
[35:21] little bit of cold and they were a
[35:22] little congested so remember them and
[35:24] then
[35:25] my father because of the covet vaccines
[35:28] they took
[35:29] he was not allowed to take the shot for
[35:31] the pain in his leg for
[35:32] well over a month so it was really
[35:34] bothering him and today they were
[35:36] they were able to to do that but the
[35:39] doctor said for him to rest a day or two
[35:40] on that
[35:42] so he was feeling much better so but a
[35:45] testimony with that
[35:46] um as you know sarah my daughter she
[35:49] goes
[35:49] to dialysis three times a week and
[35:54] recently they had not been able to go
[35:57] and do a full dialysis run so the fluid
[35:59] begins to build up over time and
[36:02] she was beginning to carry a lot of
[36:03] fluid and
[36:05] she said it begins to press up on her
[36:07] lungs makes it hard to breathe
[36:09] you lay down and the water fills all the
[36:11] vacant cavities and their lungs don't
[36:13] want to work and
[36:15] so she asked us this would have been um
[36:18] monday night
[36:20] she came into the room with me and mom
[36:21] said would you have prayed for me i have
[36:23] not been able to have a full run and
[36:26] so we just prayed a simple prayer lord
[36:28] you know this
[36:29] just for a few moments and you know of
[36:31] course dad and mom are
[36:33] touched by the feeling of the
[36:34] infirmities and we know god is the same
[36:36] way
[36:37] so yesterday she came over for dinner
[36:39] and
[36:40] she was quite happy she said i had a
[36:43] full run
[36:44] they were able to take off all the
[36:46] liquid and for those of us who don't
[36:48] have the problem we might not understand
[36:50] that
[36:51] but when someone is going through a hard
[36:53] time suffering
[36:56] let us let us love one another let us
[36:58] pray for one another let us feel for one
[36:59] another so just appreciate that god is
[37:02] mindful of us
[37:02] so how many knows he's mindful of you
[37:06] he's proved himself over and over and
[37:08] over so
[37:10] i feel stan
[37:13] as we get ready to hear this since about
[37:15] 65 minutes long
[37:18] but brother brown really speaking of who
[37:20] is this
[37:21] that we're talking about it's the lord
[37:22] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[37:24] and forever
[37:26] but he talks about some things there
[37:27] that just just encouraged my heart
[37:30] and so we'll hear that but
[37:33] i was going to sing this song god still
[37:35] moves but we'll maybe we'll send that to
[37:37] him
[37:37] let's just at the end of the service and
[37:39] we'll sing only believe
[37:41] all things are possible he's still the
[37:43] same yesterday today and forever
[37:46] he meets the needs he does things you
[37:48] know he does not sleep
[37:50] he does not slumber he's not on a
[37:53] eight to four you know today i
[37:57] i was i they send me up to casa grande
[38:00] and sometimes phoenix on
[38:01] tuesdays and thursdays to help out and
[38:04] this afternoon they still hadn't sent me
[38:06] my schedule
[38:07] and i called the office and the girl
[38:09] that does that was
[38:10] off today the other girl had gone home
[38:13] so they passed me on to somebody else
[38:15] who
[38:16] wasn't answering their phone they
[38:19] finally
[38:19] gave me to the head of the department
[38:22] and she's just recently moved to arizona
[38:24] she doesn't
[38:25] she said is casagrand the name of a job
[38:28] she had no idea it was a city between
[38:29] tucson and phoenix and
[38:32] so she apologized to me that nobody had
[38:34] taken care of that
[38:35] and she said no there's no work up here
[38:37] tomorrow you just stay home
[38:39] but it's already four o'clock in the
[38:40] afternoon and i'm trying to prepare for
[38:42] tomorrow i'm glad
[38:43] god does not work that way but he's
[38:46] already
[38:47] seen he's already taken a care he's
[38:49] already provided how many knows that in
[38:51] your life
[38:53] so only believe all things are possible
[39:02] [Music]
[39:09] all things are possible
[39:13] [Music]
[39:26] oh
[39:31] [Music]
[39:37] i confess lord i believe lord i
[39:42] believe lord i
[39:47] believe
[39:50] all things
[40:06] lord i believe
[40:13] [Music]
[40:21] god bless you as you're seated as we
[40:23] listen to this
[40:57] thank you
[41:06] it's so nice to get to come to the house
[41:08] of the lord
[41:11] i think that i was studying some
[41:14] scripture
[41:15] some time ago and it said that when
[41:19] jesus drew near unto jerusalem
[41:24] that the disciples lifted up their eyes
[41:27] and they
[41:28] saw the holy city in a distance
[41:34] and they begin to rejoice and to say
[41:37] that
[41:39] now will the kingdom be restored
[41:43] and this certain man that was telling or
[41:46] talking about a recent visit
[41:50] to palestine and he said that
[41:54] people now in the last year has been
[41:57] coming to a place that
[41:59] when they come up from the valley and
[42:01] look around the vin
[42:03] the same road that jesus and the
[42:06] disciples were on at that time
[42:09] that when they see the city they start
[42:13] to weep you know i believe there was
[42:17] something those disciples
[42:20] in those days felt that
[42:24] that the kingdom would be restored again
[42:27] and
[42:28] now it's almost time
[42:32] i believe that's the feeling it's on the
[42:34] people that the kingdom
[42:36] is almost ready to be
[42:40] restored again
[42:44] brother neville our gracious and blessed
[42:48] pastor just spoke to me about
[42:52] an oncoming uh revival
[42:55] effort here at the tabernacle in a few
[42:58] nights to be praying about it
[43:03] and i told him i thought it would be a
[43:05] blessed thing
[43:08] you just can't have too many revivals
[43:13] and many times we get the wrong opinion
[43:16] of a revival
[43:18] a revival isn't so much as to bring in
[43:21] new members
[43:24] but it's to revive that which we already
[43:26] have
[43:27] amen
[43:30] and i'm i like to say this
[43:34] because i say it from the depths of my
[43:37] heart
[43:39] i begin to find a different feeling
[43:42] around the tabernacle and
[43:44] what has been for a long time
[43:48] a feeling of of
[43:51] a deep spiritual sense
[43:56] like that it used to be long time ago
[44:02] that something that settles and
[44:06] it's got a real foundation and i
[44:10] trust that god will bless this little
[44:13] church
[44:13] amen again
[44:16] in its power and i see the building
[44:20] program
[44:21] going on and i think that's a great
[44:24] thing
[44:25] for sooner or later we older people are
[44:29] going to
[44:31] take off the armor and hand it back into
[44:34] the
[44:34] hands of our children and walk up
[44:38] that golden stairway
[44:41] the other day i passed that halfway mark
[44:44] now of 50 years old
[44:47] i just can't realize that
[44:52] don't seem like it's hauling groceries
[44:54] for chris meisner
[44:55] about 18 16 18 years old
[44:59] but just went somewhere it just goes to
[45:02] show that
[45:03] here we have no continuing city
[45:07] but we're seeking one to come
[45:10] and that's the city where god is builder
[45:14] and there will never be no end there
[45:19] this morning as i was speaking on the
[45:22] subject of
[45:23] mother's day and trying to place mother
[45:27] not as she really is in
[45:30] the old age with the wrinkles
[45:33] and all this her crutches are
[45:37] an old wheelchair arm chair a little pot
[45:41] of flowers setting by her but
[45:42] mother in the resurrection restored
[45:46] back to her youth and
[45:49] standing shining as a queen
[45:54] that's the way i like to think of my
[45:55] mother
[45:57] i don't like to think of her as she is
[46:00] today
[46:02] old i like to think of what's coming
[46:06] i know you feel that way about your
[46:08] mothers
[46:09] think of her as she really

[49:46] lesson
[49:46] out of matthew the 21st chapter
[49:50] beginning at the first verse in reading
[49:52] down
[49:54] in 11th inclusive
[49:58] and when they drew now unto jerusalem
[50:03] there came and came to bed
[50:06] unto the mount of olive
[50:10] then sent jesus to disciples saying unto
[50:13] them
[50:15] go into the village over against you
[50:19] straightway you shall find an ass tied
[50:22] in a
[50:22] cult with her loose them and bring them
[50:26] to me
[50:29] and if any man say ought unto you
[50:33] ye shall say the lord has need of them
[50:38] and straightway he will send them
[50:43] all this was done that it might be
[50:45] fulfilled
[50:46] which is spoken by the prophets saying
[50:51] tell the daughters of sign behold
[50:55] thy king cometh in meekness
[51:00] setting upon the ass and a colt
[51:04] the full of an ass and the disciples
[51:08] went and did as jesus commanded them
[51:12] and brought the ass and the coat and
[51:15] put on them their clothes and
[51:19] they set him there on
[51:23] and a very great multitude spread their
[51:26] garments
[51:27] in the way and cut down
[51:30] branches from the trees and strolled
[51:33] them
[51:34] in the way and the multitude that went
[51:38] before
[51:40] and that followed cried saying
[51:44] hosanna to the son of david
[51:49] blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[51:53] the lord hosanna
[51:56] in the highs
[51:59] and when he was come into jerusalem
[52:03] all the city was moved saying
[52:07] who is this
[52:10] and the multitude said this is
[52:13] jesus the prophet of
[52:17] nazareth
[52:20] let us bow our heads for prayer
[52:26] oh lord we wondered just
[52:30] what we would have said if we lived in
[52:32] those days
[52:37] but we are living in a greater day
[52:41] when we are looking for him to come
[52:45] and as we are making preparation lord
[52:49] getting our hearts prepared and bringing
[52:52] in all the sheaves that
[52:54] we can gather from the harvest fields
[52:57] both at home and abroad
[53:01] we are thinking and and anticipating
[53:06] on the time that we shall see him coming
[53:10] riding on a white horse coming
[53:14] down from the portals of glory
[53:18] to change and fashion this old corrupted
[53:21] bodies of ours into a glorious
[53:24] body like unto his own
[53:28] where there can be no sin or no
[53:32] sign of death ever entered
[53:36] and we shall see him as he is and live
[53:39] and
[53:39] love him throughout all ages that is to
[53:43] come
[53:46] we thank thee farthest church
[53:50] and for its pastor and for the trustees
[53:54] and the deacons and
[53:56] for every person that comes here and for
[53:59] the visitors that's in our gates
[54:02] that sheep are the same foe
[54:05] but from another crowd
[54:10] we would ask that you would bless them
[54:12] tonight with your presence
[54:16] and feed us on thy word
[54:19] amen that we might go from here tonight
[54:23] with the determination to be
[54:25] better christians than we have ever been
[54:30] may we go with the new hope in our heart
[54:33] and with joy waiting
[54:37] for his coming
[54:40] if by chance there would be some among
[54:42] us who are sick and afflicted
[54:45] we will not forget to pray for them
[54:49] that they coming into the building
[54:51] tonight where we have
[54:53] gathered for the worship
[54:57] coming in sick may they go out well
[55:02] and we would ask for those that are
[55:04] convalescents
[55:06] in the homes and the hospitals
[55:10] and are on the beds of affliction we
[55:13] pray o
[55:14] god that your mercy will reach down to
[55:18] them we would pray for
[55:21] those that are indifferent tonight amen
[55:26] that has not yet tasted and seen the
[55:29] lord is good
[55:31] that doesn't know what it means to be
[55:34] loved by god
[55:38] they just don't understand what they are
[55:40] missing
[55:42] oh god made some radio broadcaster
[55:47] some way touch their hearts
[55:52] and their emotions may be
[55:56] turned to thee
[55:59] before the door of mercy be
[56:02] closed and they be shut out
[56:05] to stand the judgments without mercy
[56:10] help us lord these things we pray
[56:14] in the name of the lord jesus and for
[56:16] his glory
[56:18] we asked it amen
[56:30] the people were so crowded around the
[56:34] gates and the streets were
[56:36] jammed and there was not even
[56:40] room for people to sleep
[56:44] they were laying outside the wall
[56:48] all over the grounds
[56:52] because this was the passover
[56:56] and people come from all over the known
[57:00] world to worship at this
[57:02] time it was a time when the
[57:06] paschal lamb was slain
[57:09] and the uh it represented their
[57:13] deliverance
[57:13] out of egypt the bondage
[57:18] and they kept this annually every year
[57:21] this great passover took place
[57:25] it was one of the most outstanding
[57:29] times of the are
[57:32] events of the jewish religion because
[57:35] it meant the time they were delivered
[57:40] all people love to think of that the
[57:43] time
[57:44] they were delivered
[57:48] how that each of us tonight
[57:52] can go back to the time when we were
[57:55] delivered what it
[57:58] meant to us
[58:01] i can remember in my own experience
[58:05] how my poor boy's heart
[58:09] craved to touch god
[58:13] i thought oh if i could only go up and
[58:17] knock on his door and talk to him a
[58:20] little while
[58:22] and of course you know my story i got me
[58:25] a paper in pencil and was gonna
[58:27] write him a letter cause i couldn't talk
[58:30] to him and
[58:31] i know that he lived in the woods
[58:33] because i had heard him
[58:36] not seen his moving
[58:39] in the woods and i a certain old
[58:41] familiar path that i used to go down
[58:43] when it would be
[58:44] hunting or going fishing i thought i'll
[58:46] just tack it on the tree and
[58:49] address it to mr jesus
[58:53] just some way so that that burden could
[58:57] be from my
[58:58] heart amen oh
[59:01] that night down yondu
[59:05] i might forget my age
[59:09] i might even forget my name sometime
[59:13] but i could never forget that hour
[59:16] when he delivered me from sin
[59:20] something took place down inside me
[59:25] that it's helped me through the great
[59:28] hours of
[59:28] darkness the hour of my
[59:33] deliverance the weights of
[59:36] sin left me and i was a new person
[59:40] i'd been the new creature in christ
[59:43] jesus
[59:44] ever since
[59:47] and these jews they come up each year
[59:51] and
[59:52] there was a fountain inside the church
[59:57] and they've taken the the bread
[1:00:00] and the bitter herbs and the lamb
[1:00:04] and they drink from this fountain
[1:00:08] in the church and they rejoice together
[1:00:11] because that god had showed them
[1:00:15] favor
[1:00:18] so this being the passover time and not
[1:00:21] only was it the passover
[1:00:24] but it was a special passover
[1:00:28] you know there's sometimes that we go to
[1:00:30] church
[1:00:32] and we always love to go but
[1:00:35] there's sometimes that something special
[1:00:40] happens
[1:00:43] and this was one of those times
[1:00:46] the air was charged with expectancy
[1:00:52] just as it is today
[1:00:55] all the eyes of those who loved him was
[1:00:59] watching for him to come into the gate
[1:01:04] and i believe it's a great deal that way
[1:01:06] today
[1:01:08] for those who love him are looking for
[1:01:12] him
[1:01:15] the air is charged
[1:01:18] with expectancy
[1:01:22] when we are living in this day when the
[1:01:25] earth is
[1:01:26] actually has become one great
[1:01:29] powder keg and
[1:01:33] science is telling us it's just three
[1:01:36] minutes
[1:01:37] until midnight
[1:01:40] and i'm sure you was reading as i the
[1:01:42] other day that story of this
[1:01:44] general and the army said that
[1:01:48] if there was another war it would only
[1:01:50] last
[1:01:51] just two or three minutes
[1:01:55] the old days of battling and shooting
[1:01:57] rifles and
[1:01:58] digging foxholes that's all over
[1:02:03] they claim the next war will be just two
[1:02:06] or three minutes
[1:02:09] someday some topsy-turvy person's gonna
[1:02:14] blow his lid off and fire one of those
[1:02:17] bombs
[1:02:19] and when they do we've got listening
[1:02:21] posts everywhere to fart right back
[1:02:24] again
[1:02:25] the world just can't survive that
[1:02:32] everyone at the passover knew something
[1:02:34] was going to happen
[1:02:36] but they didn't know just what it was
[1:02:41] and that's the way it is today
[1:02:45] most everyone knows that something's
[1:02:48] fixing to happen
[1:02:52] everyone knows that
[1:02:55] you can talk to the center you can talk
[1:02:59] to the merchant
[1:03:00] you can talk to anyone and oh it's
[1:03:04] such an unresting time for the world
[1:03:09] but you can talk to a man or a woman
[1:03:12] that's looking for him coming and the
[1:03:15] glory
[1:03:16] is on their face shining out
[1:03:20] they're watching for that great event
[1:03:25] so the whole air is charged again
[1:03:30] expecting something to happen
[1:03:34] the world doesn't know what's fixed to
[1:03:36] happen
[1:03:38] but the church of the living god knows
[1:03:40] what's going to happen
[1:03:42] they know that soon the trumpet will
[1:03:45] sound
[1:03:47] and we'll see him come riding out of
[1:03:50] glory on a white horse now
[1:03:53] armies of heaven following him and those
[1:03:55] that are
[1:03:56] dead in christ will be raptured and
[1:03:58] tucked up to medium in the air
[1:04:02] that's what we are looking for we're
[1:04:05] longing for it and we're told that the
[1:04:10] souls of those mothers and so forth we
[1:04:13] spoke of this morning
[1:04:14] just under the altar of god are
[1:04:17] screaming
[1:04:18] how long lord how long
[1:04:23] mother wants to see you as much as you
[1:04:25] want to see her
[1:04:28] and our loved ones wants to meet us as
[1:04:30] well as we want to meet
[1:04:32] them what a reunion that'll be
[1:04:36] when he comes to meet our loved ones and
[1:04:40] see them in their resurrection body
[1:04:44] and glorified and walking around with
[1:04:47] the
[1:04:48] air of the resurrection amen amen
[1:04:52] watching their character how it's
[1:04:55] changed
[1:04:56] the meekness and quietness and it won't
[1:05:00] be a
[1:05:00] hustling bustle and jumping jerk
[1:05:05] but we'll have all eternity to live
[1:05:07] together
[1:05:11] all this great neurotic age that we're
[1:05:14] living
[1:05:16] just not no time for nothing just
[1:05:19] climbing and jerking and grabbing
[1:05:22] why it's a terrible day damn
[1:05:27] as they waited for something to happen
[1:05:32] it was too bad those at the passover
[1:05:35] never got to see him
[1:05:38] yet they know something was going to
[1:05:40] happen but yet they didn't get to see
[1:05:42] him
[1:05:44] so would be at the coming of the lord
[1:05:49] there's many restless people today
[1:05:53] that knows that something's fixing to
[1:05:56] happen
[1:05:57] but they they'll never see him
[1:06:01] for he will come in the stillness of the
[1:06:05] midnight to catch away
[1:06:07] that little church amen
[1:06:10] that's longing waiting
[1:06:14] and expecting to see him
[1:06:17] that's the ones he'll come and catch
[1:06:18] away
[1:06:21] many of the world who is living on the
[1:06:25] glamors and the
[1:06:26] feasting their souls upon the things of
[1:06:28] the world will
[1:06:29] never know what happened until the
[1:06:33] church has gone into glory
[1:06:36] for he will come as a thief in the night
[1:06:41] and catch them away
[1:06:44] so we can see we're back again to the
[1:06:47] same place
[1:06:49] now we find out that
[1:06:53] this expectations that god comes to
[1:06:56] those who
[1:06:57] all through the scriptures it's been the
[1:06:59] same thing
[1:07:01] that they are he always appears to those
[1:07:04] who are
[1:07:05] expecting him
[1:07:08] always to those who are wanting to see
[1:07:11] him
[1:07:13] and i'm sure that that's the hope that's
[1:07:15] on our hearts tonight
[1:07:19] it's been about six months ago i suppose
[1:07:22] i was
[1:07:23] testifying to some people and i said
[1:07:27] oh to think of it but
[1:07:30] just most any time he'll come
[1:07:35] what caused me to say that i was
[1:07:37] speaking of brother bosworth
[1:07:41] when i went to see that old saint
[1:07:44] when we heard he was dying 80 something
[1:07:46] years old
[1:07:48] the wife and i are going down to there
[1:07:51] to see him before he died i just
[1:07:53] had to say something to him
[1:07:56] i like to watch saints when they're
[1:07:58] entering glory
[1:08:02] and i had to see him and we burnt the
[1:08:04] tires off of the car
[1:08:06] but when i got there and rushed into the
[1:08:09] door in a little
[1:08:10] corner laid that old patriarch
[1:08:14] he raised his head up when he see me
[1:08:17] coming his old feeble arms
[1:08:19] hung out with the flesh hanging down and
[1:08:22] he
[1:08:22] reached his arms for me and i
[1:08:26] grabbed him around the neck and screamed
[1:08:29] my father my father the
[1:08:32] chariots of israel and the horsemen
[1:08:34] thereof
[1:08:36] for he was a sainted godly man
[1:08:41] and i said brother bynesworth i want to
[1:08:43] ask you something
[1:08:46] do you believe that you'll get well he
[1:08:48] said oh i'm not even
[1:08:50] sick i said well what's the matter he
[1:08:54] said i'm going home
[1:08:57] amen he said i'm tired and i'm
[1:09:01] wore out and i just
[1:09:04] want to go home
[1:09:07] i said then you realize you're dying
[1:09:10] i said i want to ask you something
[1:09:15] back down through the 70 some odd years
[1:09:18] of ministry
[1:09:21] what has been your most glorious myth
[1:09:25] could you speak to me sir
[1:09:29] and tell me what experience do you had
[1:09:33] down along the line that you could count
[1:09:37] your
[1:09:37] greatest hour
[1:09:41] i shall live to see his age i'll never
[1:09:44] forget
[1:09:45] as those dark eyes caught me over the
[1:09:48] top of those glasses
[1:09:51] he said my dear brother
[1:09:55] this is the greatest moment of my life
[1:09:59] i can't think of any time there was any
[1:10:03] more glorious than right now
[1:10:06] i looked him in the face and i said sir
[1:10:09] do you still know that you're dying he
[1:10:11] said brother branham
[1:10:13] i'm laying here waiting every minute for
[1:10:16] him to open that door and come take me
[1:10:18] home with him
[1:10:19] amen that's the way to die
[1:10:24] that's the way to go and as you know
[1:10:28] that about two hours before he died he
[1:10:31] was
[1:10:31] been laying in a coma for over two days
[1:10:35] and when he come to himself he raised up
[1:10:39] in the room and began to speak to his
[1:10:40] wife
[1:10:42] then all of a sudden he seemed to be
[1:10:45] transparent
[1:10:48] and he was shook hands for a solid hour
[1:10:51] or more
[1:10:52] with friends who's been dead for 40 or
[1:10:55] 50 years who was his converts in his
[1:10:57] church
[1:10:58] chuck camp with his mother with his
[1:11:01] daddy
[1:11:02] until he was life was left his body
[1:11:05] laid down on the pillow and went to
[1:11:08] sleep in the arms of the lord
[1:11:10] jesus amen
[1:11:13] there is nothing like serving him
[1:11:17] expecting him and as i talked to this
[1:11:20] man
[1:11:22] about this and told that experience
[1:11:26] i said this i said sir
[1:11:29] oh won't it be glorious when we see him
[1:11:33] or if he would come today
[1:11:36] he said brother branham don't scare the
[1:11:38] people like that
[1:11:41] i said what do you mean he said oh
[1:11:45] don't try to tell people that the
[1:11:46] world's coming or christ is coming
[1:11:48] it worries them oh
[1:11:51] i said no i beg your pardon
[1:11:56] to those who aren't looking for him it's
[1:11:58] the most
[1:11:59] glorious news that they can hear that
[1:12:02] jesus
[1:12:02] is just about to break to
[1:12:06] and to take his church hallelujah
[1:12:09] old age will be changed for youth
[1:12:13] joy will be given instead of gloom
[1:12:18] life will be given instead of death
[1:12:21] immortality for morality be exchanged
[1:12:25] oh what a moment to know that he shall
[1:12:28] come
[1:12:29] amen they were looking for him
[1:12:33] they were expecting him and when he come
[1:12:37] we
[1:12:38] found that there was two factions
[1:12:42] one group was far in and one was against
[1:12:45] him
[1:12:47] and that's the way we find it today
[1:12:51] that's what his coming always has
[1:12:54] divided the peoples
[1:12:57] every time when you find jesus you find
[1:13:00] those
[1:13:00] around who would be contrary with it
[1:13:04] that's satan and today when
[1:13:08] we think of it we don't see much change
[1:13:12] just the same the people's has changed
[1:13:17] but the spirit of people hasn't changed
[1:13:21] so when they finally looked out the
[1:13:24] gate and saw him come riding on that
[1:13:27] little white
[1:13:27] donkey no one of the
[1:13:31] disciples begin to scream
[1:13:34] the kingdom of heaven has come
[1:13:37] the people run to meet him and all
[1:13:40] jerusalem
[1:13:41] stared
[1:13:44] there's something about it when jesus
[1:13:47] comes
[1:13:47] it's always a stirring
[1:13:51] and the whole city was stirred
[1:13:54] and they they can't hide it
[1:13:58] and the preachers of that day
[1:14:02] had to give an account for this stir
[1:14:04] because it was at the
[1:14:06] feast of the passover and they screamed
[1:14:10] up
[1:14:11] who is this
[1:14:15] when the air charged and the
[1:14:18] coming of the lord jesus to jerusalem
[1:14:22] had charged the air with expectations
[1:14:26] it looks like that the teachers ought to
[1:14:29] know
[1:14:29] what was going to take place it looked
[1:14:32] like that the high priest would have
[1:14:34] noted
[1:14:36] it looked like that all the other
[1:14:38] priests would have known
[1:14:40] and it isn't changed any today because
[1:14:43] the
[1:14:44] holy spirit is forerunning the coming of
[1:14:47] the lord jesus
[1:14:50] and as the holy spirit begins to stretch
[1:14:53] out across the earth revival
[1:14:56] fires are broken out everywhere great
[1:15:00] signs and wonders has been done
[1:15:03] healings has taken place prophecies has
[1:15:06] went forth
[1:15:07] all the gathering of the apostolic
[1:15:10] blessings has come back to the church
[1:15:12] again
[1:15:16] so as it was then so is that now
[1:15:19] the spirit of the unbeliever still cries
[1:15:22] out
[1:15:23] who is this
[1:15:27] some of them believed on the lord jesus
[1:15:30] to say he was a good man
[1:15:33] some of them said he's a good man that's
[1:15:36] what they say today they
[1:15:37] try to place him as a napoleon
[1:15:41] a warrior they try to place him as a
[1:15:46] george washington a truthful man
[1:15:50] but he was more than that
[1:15:54] did you notice the reading of the
[1:15:56] scripture they said
[1:15:57] this is a prophet that comes from
[1:16:00] galilee
[1:16:02] and they tried to say the same thing
[1:16:04] today
[1:16:05] when they see this great move of the
[1:16:08] lord
[1:16:09] to restore back to hell
[1:16:12] the sick and the afflicted to see him
[1:16:16] use his spirit in his church to discern
[1:16:19] the thoughts of the people
[1:16:22] to see him do just as he did when he was
[1:16:25] here on earth
[1:16:26] to fulfill what he said would take place
[1:16:30] certainly the churches and the people as
[1:16:34] asking this who is this
[1:16:37] they didn't understand who jesus was
[1:16:39] because none of them could recognize him
[1:16:41] by their schools
[1:16:43] what seminary did he come out of
[1:16:47] what school of theology did he come from
[1:16:51] and so is it today most of the people
[1:16:55] who are
[1:16:56] anointed with the holy ghost didn't come
[1:16:59] from any seminary
[1:17:02] they are products of god's own choosing
[1:17:09] but the signs
[1:17:12] and the miracles and the wonders that
[1:17:16] was
[1:17:16] promised of the bible accompany this
[1:17:19] great holy spirit
[1:17:21] as it moves among the people and they
[1:17:24] say today
[1:17:25] what school are they from just
[1:17:28] as soon as you enter a city to hold a
[1:17:30] revival
[1:17:31] what denomination do you belong to
[1:17:36] i had an interview friday afternoon
[1:17:40] with the the roman catholic priest
[1:17:43] from the irish church in louisville
[1:17:47] i know more than i had been introduced
[1:17:49] to him a fine
[1:17:51] scholarly man he said mr branham
[1:17:55] what denomination are you with
[1:18:00] i said i'm not with annie
[1:18:04] and he said then where you ordained i
[1:18:06] said yes sir
[1:18:09] he said who ordained you
[1:18:13] i said the lord jesus gave me the holy
[1:18:16] spirit to preach the gospel
[1:18:18] and gave me a commission amen
[1:18:22] well that's the ordination that we need
[1:18:26] jesus never said to his disciples go out
[1:18:29] to the
[1:18:30] i'm not criticizing those things but
[1:18:32] they've lived their day
[1:18:35] he didn't say go study to be a minister
[1:18:37] for so many years
[1:18:39] he said tarry he in the city of
[1:18:42] jerusalem
[1:18:43] until you be endued with power from on
[1:18:46] high
[1:18:47] he said that to man who couldn't sign
[1:18:49] their own name
[1:18:52] and after this the holy ghost has come
[1:18:55] upon you
[1:18:55] then you shall be my witnesses
[1:19:00] both in jerusalem judea samira and
[1:19:03] to the utmost parts of the earth
[1:19:08] that's the ordination
[1:19:11] we have no record of jesus ever going to
[1:19:13] any school or graduating from any
[1:19:15] seminaries
[1:19:18] yet there's been more seminaries erected
[1:19:20] in his name for
[1:19:22] religious causes and then for any other
[1:19:24] any other thing that's ever been in the
[1:19:26] world
[1:19:29] we never had each any record of him ever
[1:19:31] going to school
[1:19:32] but yet there's been more schools
[1:19:34] erected in his name
[1:19:38] than there is of any other kind of a
[1:19:39] name there is under the heavens
[1:19:42] the schools we never have noticed him
[1:19:45] right in the book yet there's been more
[1:19:47] books wrote about him in
[1:19:48] all the rest of the literature's been
[1:19:50] written
[1:19:51] today his bible is the most popular book
[1:19:55] that there is in
[1:19:55] all the world amongst all the literature
[1:20:00] but you see in the day of the visitation
[1:20:03] they cried
[1:20:04] who is he see god takes something it
[1:20:07] seems like it's nothing to make
[1:20:08] something out of it
[1:20:10] that's what makes him god and when they
[1:20:13] seen him come
[1:20:14] riding into that gate some of them
[1:20:18] said he's a great man they say that
[1:20:21] today
[1:20:22] there are schools of theology that
[1:20:24] teaches today
[1:20:25] that jesus was a great man that he was a
[1:20:28] good man
[1:20:30] some of them even say that he was a
[1:20:32] prophet
[1:20:33] now if he was only a prophet or a good
[1:20:35] man we're in our sins
[1:20:39] he was more than a prophet he was more
[1:20:42] than a good man yet he was a good man
[1:20:45] yet he was a god prophet but he was more
[1:20:49] than that
[1:20:51] he was god manifested in the flesh
[1:20:55] to take away sin
[1:20:59] and as he come riding in lots of the
[1:21:02] people said
[1:21:02] he's a healer always seen him
[1:21:06] open the eyes of the blind
[1:21:09] we seen him make the crippled man to
[1:21:12] walk
[1:21:14] we seen him all for prayer and a fever
[1:21:16] left a child
[1:21:18] but then those type were only following
[1:21:21] him for the
[1:21:23] loaves and the fishes and that's the way
[1:21:26] the crowds are today many
[1:21:29] if there's a healer while they they
[1:21:31] follow him and it's just
[1:21:32] it's just an always if they get sick
[1:21:35] they run say
[1:21:36] oh will you please pray for me that the
[1:21:38] lord jesus will make me well
[1:21:40] and as soon as they come out of the
[1:21:43] hospital or the sick bed
[1:21:44] right back out into the world they go
[1:21:48] like a dog to its vomit aura hog
[1:21:51] to its water as the scripture says
[1:21:55] just follow him for what good they can
[1:21:57] get out of him
[1:21:58] they use him just for a a totem pole
[1:22:02] or or something that that they can get
[1:22:05] from him and
[1:22:06] don't expect to serve him
[1:22:09] that crowd still goes on today
[1:22:12] there were nine lepers healed and one
[1:22:14] returned to give him
[1:22:16] praise or was it 10.
[1:22:19] they one of them returned to give him
[1:22:21] praise
[1:22:23] and the rest of them went ahead
[1:22:25] ungrateful
[1:22:27] and if the people in america has been
[1:22:30] healed by the
[1:22:32] power of god turn their hearts to god
[1:22:34] there'd be a revival strike this nation
[1:22:36] that would close every bootleg joint
[1:22:39] that would
[1:22:40] package stores and whiskey stores to be
[1:22:43] put out of the picture
[1:22:47] the churches would be full of theaters
[1:22:50] to be empty on sunday night and there'd
[1:22:52] be a revival
[1:22:53] break out to this nation
[1:22:57] but when they see it happen the things
[1:22:59] that god does
[1:23:01] they still scream who is he who is this
[1:23:04] that comes
[1:23:06] where do they come from who is this but
[1:23:09] what authority
[1:23:10] is this done never forget
[1:23:14] at johannesburg south africa
[1:23:18] i just arrived about 30 minutes before
[1:23:21] on a plane i've been
[1:23:23] three days and nights in the air so
[1:23:26] tired i could hardly stand it
[1:23:28] they take me out to the fairgrounds
[1:23:30] where some
[1:23:31] 50 or 60 000 people were gathered
[1:23:34] no sooner than god on the platform to
[1:23:37] the holy spirit
[1:23:39] i seen coming across the place a
[1:23:42] a bus and it was had a sign on it durbin
[1:23:46] i saw a young man had to fuss and slip
[1:23:49] away from his father and mother
[1:23:50] with one leg six or eight inches shorter
[1:23:53] than the other
[1:23:54] he was wearing a white shirt with
[1:23:56] suppenders
[1:23:57] holding up his trousers
[1:24:00] and i noticed a young man i look back
[1:24:04] again
[1:24:04] the vision was gone and then just in a
[1:24:08] moment i saw that light
[1:24:09] hanging over a young man way back in the
[1:24:13] audience
[1:24:15] and i looked i thought i was seeing him
[1:24:16] somewhere
[1:24:19] and i watched him in that light kept
[1:24:20] holding over him for a few minutes and
[1:24:22] i was waiting for the interpreter to
[1:24:24] catch the next words
[1:24:26] then i seen that same young man stand up
[1:24:30] throw down his crutches on his six
[1:24:33] inches
[1:24:34] short leg came down normal with the rest
[1:24:39] and i said to mr aj skooman who is in
[1:24:42] glory tonight
[1:24:44] i said mr schumann just quote my words
[1:24:48] it's a vision he said very well
[1:24:51] and i said the young man setting back
[1:24:54] there
[1:24:55] with the white shirt on his suppenders
[1:24:57] he
[1:24:58] came from a city called durbin some 1500
[1:25:02] miles
[1:25:03] across the country in a bus
[1:25:06] and he had to slip away from his father
[1:25:09] and mother to come
[1:25:12] but he's believed on the lord jesus and
[1:25:15] he's got one leg
[1:25:16] six inches shorter than the other
[1:25:19] and the young man jumped up there he's
[1:25:22] standing
[1:25:23] trying to feel for his crutches and i
[1:25:26] said
[1:25:27] young man the lord jesus has healed you
[1:25:31] and immediately his leg come out six
[1:25:34] inches to the normal with the rest of
[1:25:36] them
[1:25:37] and they brought the young man to the
[1:25:39] platform and
[1:25:40] doctors examined him there you see his
[1:25:43] picture in my book
[1:25:46] i'd been standing there just a few
[1:25:47] moments i seen a little green car
[1:25:50] running down the road in the sip it
[1:25:52] turned around backward and struck
[1:25:54] a tree a young blond-headed girl
[1:25:57] was had a broken back
[1:26:02] and i said i see a little green car
[1:26:05] that slid into a tree and a young blonde
[1:26:08] headed girl of about
[1:26:09] 18 years old has a broken back she's in
[1:26:12] a serious condition
[1:26:14] no one responded i couldn't see her
[1:26:16] anywhere in that
[1:26:17] vast big audience of people and i stood
[1:26:20] there just for a few minutes i said
[1:26:22] understand it's don't be suspicious
[1:26:26] it's the lord jesus in the power of the
[1:26:29] resurrection
[1:26:30] he sent the holy ghost to continue his
[1:26:33] work amen
[1:26:34] and there i seen the vision happen over
[1:26:37] again
[1:26:38] and i couldn't see the young woman just
[1:26:41] then standing right in front of me here
[1:26:42] stood that light as you see on the
[1:26:45] picture
[1:26:46] and the studio and i walked up there and
[1:26:47] there she laid down below the platform
[1:26:51] i said young lady the lord jesus has
[1:26:54] made you well and she started to cry her
[1:26:58] mother said oh no
[1:26:59] don't tell her to get up says if she
[1:27:02] moves she'll die
[1:27:04] and the young lady jumped to her feet
[1:27:06] screaming
[1:27:07] and praising god and the mother faded
[1:27:10] and fell in the cup that the girl was
[1:27:11] laying in
[1:27:13] amen what is it just about that time
[1:27:17] some
[1:27:18] critical man raised up back there and
[1:27:20] stood with one foot on one seat and one
[1:27:23] on the other
[1:27:24] and said you american
[1:27:27] i challenge you to tell me what name
[1:27:30] you do this in and what denomination
[1:27:33] church do you belong to
[1:27:36] see it's just the same
[1:27:41] they don't understand they're not
[1:27:44] looking for these things the churches
[1:27:47] are not looking
[1:27:48] for the coming of the lord and the holy
[1:27:51] spirit is sure to confirm his coming
[1:27:54] to bring it to pass so much
[1:27:57] each one wants to take his own way
[1:28:00] that's the way it was there each group
[1:28:02] had their own idea
[1:28:04] but that's not the question tonight
[1:28:07] that's not what i'm talking about amen
[1:28:11] but the question i'm asking you
[1:28:15] is what do you think it is it concerns
[1:28:19] you
[1:28:20] who is this that's going up and down the
[1:28:23] nations
[1:28:25] not man man cannot do those things
[1:28:30] who is it that's speaking and saying to
[1:28:34] the people in the audience
[1:28:36] uh sitting right here over here in
[1:28:38] different places in the meeting
[1:28:40] when women and man are brought in here
[1:28:44] dying who is it
[1:28:47] that young woman that walked into the
[1:28:49] baptist this morning
[1:28:50] that three weeks ago dying with sarcomas
[1:28:54] cancer
[1:28:56] lives right here on maple street mrs
[1:28:58] beatty
[1:29:00] and i asked three doctors that was with
[1:29:03] her
[1:29:05] she didn't have one chance to live
[1:29:10] with four or five little children in my
[1:29:13] mother trying to take care of them
[1:29:16] mama said bill she'll never come home
[1:29:19] again
[1:29:21] and i went out to where she was and the
[1:29:24] lord jesus spoke
[1:29:26] thus saith the lord
[1:29:29] if she will go to the church and
[1:29:32] promise to be baptized into the name of
[1:29:36] the lord
[1:29:36] jesus and will serve god she'll go home
[1:29:40] amen well and i asked her will you do
[1:29:44] this
[1:29:44] lady and she said all that you
[1:29:47] say i'll do it
[1:29:51] how immediate are the pains left three
[1:29:53] days later she was home and the doctors
[1:29:55] can't find one
[1:29:57] trace of that cancer who
[1:30:00] is this
[1:30:04] that cometh in the name of the lord
[1:30:08] who is it it's the holy spirit of god

[1:30:36] and all of a sudden
[1:30:38] about two years ago i guess or something
[1:30:40] in two years
[1:30:42] the holy spirit called it and said dust
[1:30:45] saith the lord amen he's never had a
[1:30:48] spell since
[1:30:50] who is it who is that this woman was
[1:30:54] sitting here
[1:30:54] last sunday the last time i was here had
[1:30:57] come down from somewhere illinois
[1:30:59] the next day with a great tumor in her
[1:31:01] body that was malignant
[1:31:04] and some of the best medical science of
[1:31:06] illinois
[1:31:07] was taken her to a great clinic to be
[1:31:09] operated on monday and she
[1:31:11] squeezed her way in
[1:31:15] never seen or heard of her in all my
[1:31:17] life and all of a sudden the holy spirit
[1:31:20] shattered her and it told her who she
[1:31:23] was where she
[1:31:24] come from and she was going to be
[1:31:26] operated the next day
[1:31:27] how many were sure then to see that see
[1:31:30] the news flow back
[1:31:31] the next day when she went to the doctor
[1:31:33] they'd taken her from
[1:31:34] clinic to clinic and can't find the
[1:31:37] trace of it
[1:31:41] who is this oh

[1:31:49] who is this that's doing this could you
[1:31:52] dare to say it was your pastor never
[1:31:56] could you dare to say man had anything
[1:31:58] to do into it
[1:31:59] never it's the holy spirit
[1:32:04] the spirit that was on our lord jesus
[1:32:08] and he's coming to unite himself with
[1:32:11] his church
[1:32:12] is so close that he's spreading forth
[1:32:16] his great
[1:32:16] holy light to redeem and to bring into
[1:32:20] fellowship a church of the living god
[1:32:24] for the rapture that's near at hand
[1:32:27] amen who is it
[1:32:31] i can't answer your question i can't
[1:32:34] answer for you but i can answer for
[1:32:37] myself
[1:32:39] and over this sacred destiny in the ears
[1:32:42] of this the company
[1:32:43] and the the purchase of the blood of our
[1:32:46] lord jesus
[1:32:47] i say this from the bottom of my heart
[1:32:52] not because i'm one of you not because
[1:32:54] i'm just
[1:32:55] somebody different but one of the
[1:32:58] redeemed that's washed by the blood
[1:33:01] i believe that that same light that
[1:33:04] hangs in this church
[1:33:05] tonight that same one shows by its
[1:33:09] nature
[1:33:10] that it's jesus christ in the form of
[1:33:13] the holy ghost
[1:33:15] amen anyone who knows the scripture
[1:33:18] knows that jesus said i come from god
[1:33:21] and i go to
[1:33:22] god amen before he was made flesh
[1:33:26] with moses in the wilderness he was a
[1:33:29] pillar of fire
[1:33:30] and when moses desired to see me pass
[1:33:33] his back parts to him
[1:33:34] and moses said it looks like a man
[1:33:39] when he was shared on earth he was a man
[1:33:41] he'd done the very same things that he's
[1:33:43] doing today
[1:33:44] through man that he has redeemed
[1:33:47] that he comes and have his picture taken
[1:33:49] what is it
[1:33:50] after his death burial and resurrection
[1:33:54] paul was on his road to damascus one day
[1:33:57] and a great light struck him down
[1:34:01] those men around him didn't see the
[1:34:02] light
[1:34:04] but it struck paul down to made him
[1:34:07] blind he had trouble with his eyes
[1:34:11] the rest of his life
[1:34:14] and he said one time except i should be
[1:34:18] exalted above the abundance of the
[1:34:20] revelation
[1:34:21] there was given to me a thorn in his
[1:34:24] flesh
[1:34:25] a messenger of satan to benefit him
[1:34:29] because it was the abundance of the
[1:34:31] revelation
[1:34:32] and when paul was stricken down on his
[1:34:34] road to persecute the people
[1:34:36] that were making too much noise the
[1:34:38] born-again group
[1:34:40] the people that were called heretics
[1:34:44] paul was on his road to persecute those
[1:34:46] with
[1:34:47] papers in his pocket to arrest them and
[1:34:49] bring him to jerusalem
[1:34:51] and about middle of the day there come a
[1:34:53] light down that struck him off
[1:34:57] of his feet to the ground and he fell
[1:35:00] into the dust of the earth
[1:35:03] there come a voice in that light saying
[1:35:06] saul
[1:35:06] saul why persecutest thou
[1:35:10] me and saul
[1:35:13] turned over the blinding condition
[1:35:17] looked up and they could see that great
[1:35:20] glorious light
[1:35:21] and he said lord who are you he said i'm
[1:35:24] jesus i came from god i
[1:35:29] went to god i come from god i returned
[1:35:33] to god
[1:35:35] and he said it's hard for you to kick
[1:35:37] against the prince
[1:35:38] one revelation on that sacred sand
[1:35:42] one time upon that place man
[1:35:46] can never be the same amen
[1:35:49] a man before he should call himself a
[1:35:51] christian
[1:35:52] before he can identify himself
[1:35:56] he should first have that back side of
[1:35:59] the desert experience
[1:36:01] where he met god face to face for
[1:36:04] today you can have any kind of an answer
[1:36:08] you can see the lord perform just
[1:36:10] exactly what he said do
[1:36:11] and smart theologians will explain it
[1:36:14] away
[1:36:15] they'll say that was for another day it
[1:36:16] was for this or it's for another age
[1:36:19] it's wrong like they said of jesus he's
[1:36:21] beelzebub the devil he's a fortune
[1:36:23] teller
[1:36:24] and all those things they haven't
[1:36:26] answered
[1:36:27] but when a man has ever come in contact
[1:36:30] with christ
[1:36:32] and seen him as paul did or experienced
[1:36:36] him
[1:36:37] there's not enough theologians in the
[1:36:39] world to ever be able to explain that
[1:36:41] experience away from a man
[1:36:43] that's the reason today they don't have
[1:36:45] the experience that's the reason they
[1:36:47] can't say
[1:36:48] they're all saying who is this what is
[1:36:50] this where does it come from
[1:36:52] they don't have the answer why
[1:36:56] because all they know is a theology that
[1:36:58] some church is made
[1:37:00] not to know theology is life not to know
[1:37:03] the bible is life but to know
[1:37:06] him is life to know him
[1:37:10] as your personal savior as the one who
[1:37:13] has
[1:37:13] filled you with his presence you were
[1:37:16] there when it happened
[1:37:17] there's nobody can take it away from you
[1:37:20] there's no one can explain it away from
[1:37:22] you
[1:37:23] when that experience happens to you you
[1:37:27] know who he is to me he's jesus christ
[1:37:31] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:37:36] who is this is performing these miracles
[1:37:38] who is it that's doing these great works
[1:37:41] this is the preacher is it oral roberts
[1:37:44] is it billy graham is it jack schuler
[1:37:48] william branham whoever it may be they
[1:37:50] have nothing to do into
[1:37:52] their instruments it's the holy spirit
[1:37:56] coming forth with the gospel and signs
[1:37:59] and wonders and miracles
[1:38:02] to make ready a people that heirs
[1:38:05] charged with expectations with believers
[1:38:08] expecting him to come and others are
[1:38:10] saying why are these revivals
[1:38:13] why do we have it let's settle down to a
[1:38:15] church
[1:38:18] what's been said in the church
[1:38:21] right here that when we start to build a
[1:38:23] new church say we don't need miracles
[1:38:28] we don't need these things anymore you
[1:38:31] want them going out on field where
[1:38:32] they're having
[1:38:33] we don't need them here when the branham
[1:38:35] tabernacle
[1:38:36] stoops to that low place it's sunk
[1:38:40] this church is founded upon the
[1:38:42] principles and the power
[1:38:44] and the gospel of jesus christ as long
[1:38:48] as this tabernacle stands
[1:38:49] may the glorious holy spirit find access
[1:38:52] to souls to save and fill with the holy
[1:38:55] ghost
[1:38:55] and heal the sick amen to me
[1:38:58] it's jesus christ the same
[1:39:02] yesterday today and forever let us pray
[1:39:09] if you do not know who he is you do not
[1:39:12] know what all this is about
[1:39:14] and you would like to know would you
[1:39:17] just do so much as raise your hand
[1:39:19] and say by raising your hand pray for me
[1:39:22] brother branham
[1:39:23] that i'll know him and the lord bless
[1:39:26] you
[1:39:27] all around and i see your hands not
[1:39:30] heavenly father
[1:39:32] we bring this message
[1:39:36] and the fruits of the people raising
[1:39:38] their hands that they would like to know
[1:39:40] who this is
[1:39:42] they would like to be acquainted with
[1:39:44] this great
[1:39:45] jesus that is coming of the resurrection
[1:39:49] is so close to the sixth beginning to be
[1:39:52] healed
[1:39:54] and after that taken place then prophecy
[1:39:57] came into the church
[1:39:59] then gifts and miracles now down to that
[1:40:03] last sign
[1:40:06] the next will come the rapture
[1:40:10] the church will be taken away and we
[1:40:13] lord who have
[1:40:15] claimed to know you in the power of your
[1:40:18] resurrection
[1:40:19] we are waiting and longing and crying
[1:40:23] and
[1:40:23] begging come lord jesus
[1:40:29] rapture your church and get it away
[1:40:31] quickly lord
[1:40:32] for soon men are going to blow up the
[1:40:35] earth that you created for them
[1:40:37] to live on because they have
[1:40:40] disobeyed you they have not studied
[1:40:43] peace but
[1:40:44] war they have not studied righteousness
[1:40:48] but they
[1:40:48] studied mischief how that they would not
[1:40:52] all be power hungry
[1:40:55] lord that little spot in their heart
[1:40:58] that makes them hunger for
[1:40:59] power they're trying to satisfy
[1:41:03] a laboratory somewhere to blow up their
[1:41:05] fellow man
[1:41:07] god if they could only realize that that
[1:41:10] power that they long for
[1:41:12] is the power of the resurrection of the
[1:41:15] son of god
[1:41:17] the power of the holy ghost to change
[1:41:19] their lives
[1:41:21] not grow up nations but change their
[1:41:23] lives
[1:41:25] and make them your servants
[1:41:29] many people stricken with wild
[1:41:32] crazed they identifies as a bunch of
[1:41:37] not knowing nothing and and as herod
[1:41:39] kicks as they did in the early days
[1:41:41] but as they returned rejoicing thanking
[1:41:44] you that they could bear the reproach of
[1:41:46] your name
[1:41:47] that's the feeling of your children
[1:41:49] tonight lord
[1:41:50] everywhere we're only happy
[1:41:54] some in your day tried to identify you
[1:41:57] they said he is a friend of that wild
[1:42:00] man
[1:42:01] john who came out of the wilderness with
[1:42:04] harley clothes on it's an old sheepskin
[1:42:07] wrapped around him
[1:42:09] a wild man that filmed the words east
[1:42:13] and weston said the axes laid to the
[1:42:17] root of the tree he said he is a
[1:42:21] a follower of him he's a wild man he's
[1:42:25] mad
[1:42:26] he's out of his mind the supernatural
[1:42:29] ministry that was with you oh lord
[1:42:33] blinded the eyes of those and so has it
[1:42:36] again today
[1:42:37] this great holy spirit forerunning the
[1:42:40] coming of the lord as john did in his
[1:42:42] day
[1:42:44] blinding the people to those who do not
[1:42:47] want to see
[1:42:48] but to those who are willing to see thou
[1:42:51] has chosen them
[1:42:53] and all that the father has given me
[1:42:55] will come to me you said
[1:42:57] and none of them will be lost and i'll
[1:42:59] raise him up at the last day
[1:43:01] we thank thee for this and those who
[1:43:03] have raised their hands tonight
[1:43:05] we pray o lord god that you'll make
[1:43:07] yourself known to them
[1:43:08] in an experience in the power of the
[1:43:11] resurrection
[1:43:13] granted lord and others may be here who
[1:43:15] did not raise their hand but yet in
[1:43:17] their heart they
[1:43:18] knew that they needed it i pray that you
[1:43:21] will bless them
[1:43:22] and give to them the desire of their
[1:43:24] heart we leave the building tonight
[1:43:26] may we go as different people may we go
[1:43:29] with a different
[1:43:30] purpose than we had coming in if it was
[1:43:32] contrary
[1:43:33] to your divine will may we go out with a
[1:43:36] determination to hold to the harms of
[1:43:38] the altar
[1:43:39] until our soul is satisfied that we have
[1:43:42] had an experience with you
[1:43:44] and we know of whom we speak because we

[1:53:57] [Music]
[1:53:59] if they haven't had that back side of
[1:54:01] the desert experience that the prophet
