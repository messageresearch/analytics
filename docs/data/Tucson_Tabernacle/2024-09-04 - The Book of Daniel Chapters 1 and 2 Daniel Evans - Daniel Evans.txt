[29:40] night amen looking forward to this it's
[29:44] uh not just because I'm named after him
[29:47] but I am very very I love the Book of
[29:50] Daniel of two people that I relate I
[29:53] believe the most that I admire probably
[29:55] the most in the whole B Bible besides
[29:59] our lord Jesus is this Prophet Daniel
[30:02] and then the Apostle Paul two people
[30:05] that I just I love their stand so much
[30:08] and that's um and then we get to dig
[30:11] into this book tonight um we've been
[30:16] through have to refresh your memory a
[30:18] little bit we've been through the book
[30:20] of Isaiah the book of Jeremiah and the
[30:24] Book of
[30:25] Ezekiel this uh this book of Jeremiah in
[30:29] the Book of Ezekiel are prophesying
[30:31] about the same time that this book
[30:34] Daniel that the Prophet Daniel is
[30:37] prophesying now I mentioned some dates
[30:39] before you don't have to remember so
[30:41] much the dates but but just this time
[30:44] period in in 605
[30:47] BC we have the first Invasion from
[30:52] Babylon invad invading Judah and that's
[30:56] when Daniel was taking
[30:58] captive in in 605 BC and uh Daniel had
[31:03] made a name for himself already starting
[31:05] in the ministry and it seems obvious
[31:07] because Daniel is mentioned in the same
[31:10] context as Noah and uh job from The Book
[31:15] of Ezekiel and I I'll read that here in
[31:17] a minute and then about eight years
[31:20] after that first Invasion nebuchad
[31:23] Nebuchadnezzar comes in remember
[31:25] Jeremiah Was prophesying was warning War
[31:28] ing Judah saying that this King of the
[31:30] North is coming that we're going to get
[31:32] invaded and then they then the King of
[31:35] the North comes from Babylon invades and
[31:38] then about eight years later Ezekiel
[31:41] there was another Invasion that the
[31:43] first Invasion takes Daniel
[31:46] captive then the next invasion in
[31:50] 597 we see Ezekiel taken captive which
[31:54] is what we talked about last week and
[31:57] then about um 11 years later 10 years
[32:02] later 589 to 587 there was a a Siege on
[32:09] Jerusalem and it was a very it was a
[32:11] horrible horrible time that was the
[32:14] third Invasion from Nebuchadnezzar and
[32:17] then
[32:18] 586 Jerusalem the temple are destroyed
[32:23] and then we have the third wave of
[32:25] deportation from Judah so the first wave
[32:29] the first Invasion Jeremiah's
[32:31] prophesying he's he's saying that this
[32:33] is coming they invade take Daniel and
[32:38] many of many of his people captive and
[32:41] then they take another Invasion
[32:44] comes about eight years later they take
[32:47] Ezekiel captive and then there's a a
[32:51] Siege and things get really really rough
[32:54] and Ezekiel is prophesying that this is
[32:57] going to come when he was in Babylon it
[33:00] comes and um then in
[33:04] 586 the whole city is destroyed and
[33:07] burned so to lay the foundation there
[33:10] and then there's different Kings at this
[33:12] time remember the first king was Josiah
[33:16] he's pretty much the last good King in
[33:18] all of Israel and all of Judah we see
[33:20] Josiah there and uh he was a good King
[33:23] he was there for about 31 years then
[33:26] after him jehoahaz comes he like three
[33:29] months and then the two that we're going
[33:31] to have to remember one one of those is
[33:34] jeim
[33:36] jeim he was there for about 11 years as
[33:40] king and he was the king when
[33:42] Nebuchadnezzar first invades Judah then
[33:46] after him after jeho Kim then there is
[33:50] jeho Chen and he was there for just
[33:53] about three months and then after him is
[33:56] the very last last king of of Judah the
[34:00] last king of all of Israel and that's
[34:03] this King named
[34:05] zedekiah and he was uh the one that
[34:10] against the advice of the Prophet
[34:13] Jeremiah Jeremiah told him hey when this
[34:16] Invasion comes just go along with it
[34:20] don't fight it well zedekiah listened to
[34:26] His prophets rather than than the
[34:28] Prophet Jeremiah he Rebels against this
[34:32] King that was invading this this
[34:34] Nebuchadnezzar then Babylon lays Siege
[34:37] during his time and as I said the city
[34:41] is completely destroyed we get that from
[34:45] the books of Jeremiah the books of
[34:47] Ezekiel the books of second 2
[34:49] Chronicles so this
[34:51] man that this king of this country that
[34:55] just seems to come out of nowhere this
[34:59] Nebuchadnezzar he's uh his dad was
[35:03] probably the founding father of Babylon
[35:07] so Nebuchadnezzar was raised probably a
[35:10] ve a very privileged life and you know
[35:15] when you raise a
[35:16] kid and you raise him and you tell him
[35:21] that you're
[35:23] special he's like and and his mom
[35:27] probably told told him little nebie
[35:30] you're going to be a great king someday
[35:33] and and and you're special and little
[35:36] nebby you're gonna be like a
[35:39] God and telling this kid as he's being
[35:43] raised for his whole life how great he's
[35:46] going to be and and not giving him any
[35:49] hardships in life and not allowing him
[35:51] to suffer anything you can see how a lot
[35:53] of times children are raised and they
[35:56] turn out to be just just
[35:58] tyrants and people that don't care about
[36:00] someone else that only cares about
[36:03] themselves and these are the type of
[36:04] people that turned into to be
[36:05] narcissists they turned into to be a
[36:07] very controlling people and that's what
[36:10] happened to this little
[36:13] nebbi as he grew
[36:15] up he turned out to be this Tyrant of a
[36:19] king but but what kind of breaks my
[36:22] heart about this whole story of Daniel
[36:23] is I see some character in nebuch Nezar
[36:28] it comes out every once in a while which
[36:30] we'll get through as we get through the
[36:32] the book you see some repentance in
[36:36] Nebuchadnezzar you you see some some
[36:38] character come out but right
[36:42] now this man Nebuchadnezzar he had a
[36:47] terrible
[36:48] temper and and was just a very strong
[36:52] dictator and we see that as this last
[36:56] king
[36:58] that was in um Judah this zedekiah do
[37:02] you remember what happened from the book
[37:03] of
[37:04] Jeremiah Nebuchadnezzar invades and he
[37:07] sees oh you going to fight me you going
[37:10] to take me
[37:12] on remember and and
[37:16] I'm I'm adding a lot here but it you
[37:20] just see the character of this man
[37:23] Nebuchadnezzar and he says you're going
[37:24] to fight me you're going to take me on
[37:27] as zedekiah so Nebuchadnezzar comes in
[37:31] and he's absolutely furious at this King
[37:34] for fighting against him he goes He
[37:36] destroys the city he sets up zedekiah
[37:41] the king and here's all of his
[37:44] sons he sets zedekiah there lines his
[37:48] sons up against up in front of him and
[37:50] he kills each one of his sons and here's
[37:55] how cruel this man uh Nebuchadnezzar is
[37:58] is he kills them and then he gouges out
[38:02] the
[38:03] eyes of zedekiah so that's the last
[38:06] thing that he
[38:08] sees rage coming up in this man
[38:13] Nebuchadnezzar and that is who is king
[38:16] during this Book of Daniel during the
[38:19] beginning of it and that's who Daniel
[38:21] has to deal with and they know all these
[38:23] stories so when Daniel raises up and and
[38:26] and is is shows this great character
[38:30] he's running the risk of this temper
[38:32] coming out of this man and you'll see it
[38:34] coming up remember the uh the Hebrew
[38:36] children and the fiery furnace and all
[38:38] that you see this man Nebuchadnezzar you
[38:40] see his temper raise up many times
[38:43] during this
[38:44] book but these Hebrews are examples and
[38:49] they stand up against this
[38:51] man this man Daniel on the other hand
[38:55] was a young man of great Great Character
[38:59] just like these these kids were singing
[39:02] up there just dare to be a Daniel dare
[39:06] to stand alone and this man Daniel he
[39:09] was of all the prophets he was among the
[39:12] greatest you could even call him a minor
[39:14] Prophet because his book is fairly short
[39:17] but it is action-packed
[39:20] it's got wonderful things in This Book
[39:23] of Daniel so here's Daniel he's he is
[39:26] taken out as a young man again in that
[39:29] original invasion of Judah he's brought
[39:32] out and then remember
[39:35] Ezekiel Ezekiel is talking to the Lord
[39:39] and let's turn to I believe it's Ezekiel
[39:41] chapter 14 yes Ezekiel uh chapter
[39:45] 14 and verse
[39:48] 13 so here's God and he's talking to his
[39:51] Prophet Ezekiel and he says this son of
[39:54] man do you remember what son of man is
[39:58] remember it's just the son of a human
[40:00] being but we're going to get to we won't
[40:02] get there tonight but we're going to get
[40:04] to Daniel where that son of man will
[40:07] that statement is going to be used a
[40:09] little little differently a lot
[40:11] differently Ezekiel chapter 14:3 says
[40:14] this son of man when the land sinth
[40:17] Against Me by trespassing grievously
[40:19] then will I stretch out mine hand upon
[40:22] it there we just summed up the whole Old
[40:24] Testament over and over and over this
[40:27] this
[40:28] happens and will break the staff of
[40:31] bread thereof and will send famine upon
[40:33] it and will cut off man and Beast from
[40:36] it now listen to this this is how great
[40:40] this young man Daniel is and he's he's
[40:43] probably very young when Ezekiel is
[40:45] prophesying this though these three men
[40:50] Noah Noah basically was the one that God
[40:54] sent to save the human
[40:58] race
[41:01] Noah
[41:03] Daniel and
[41:05] job and he puts Daniel in the middle of
[41:09] these great Servants of God though these
[41:12] three men Noah Daniel and job were in it
[41:16] they should deliver but their own Souls
[41:19] by their righteousness sayeth the Lord
[41:22] God so God's putting Daniel in the same
[41:24] class as these and and you know he
[41:26] seldom compares one Prophet to another
[41:29] but he's doing this here and he says if
[41:30] I cause a noisome if I cause noisome
[41:33] beasts to pass through the land and they
[41:35] spoil it so that it be desolate and that
[41:37] no man pass through it because of the
[41:39] Beast though these three men were in it
[41:42] as I live sayeth the Lord God they shall
[41:45] deliver neither Sons nor daughters they
[41:47] shall o they only shall be delivered but
[41:49] the land shall be desolate so even
[41:51] though these great men were in the in
[41:53] the land Noah and job were long since D
[41:57] dead but Daniel is right here alive when
[42:01] Ezekiel is saying
[42:02] this or if I bring a sword upon the land
[42:05] and say sword go through the land so
[42:08] that I cut off a man and and Beast from
[42:11] it though these three men were in it as
[42:14] I live sayeth the Lord God they shall
[42:16] deliver neither Sons nor daughters but
[42:18] they only shall be delivered so the
[42:20] Lord's
[42:21] saying he's using Daniel as an example
[42:24] of
[42:25] righteousness to to Ezekiel or if I send
[42:29] pestilence into the land and pour out my
[42:31] Fury upon it in blood to cut it off from
[42:34] it man and Beast though Noah Daniel and
[42:37] job were in it as I live sayeth the Lord
[42:40] God they shall deliver neither son nor
[42:43] daughter they shall but deliver their
[42:45] own Souls by their
[42:47] righteousness So Daniel even while he
[42:50] was alive fairly young was singled out
[42:53] by God as a great and righteous man and
[42:56] he's saying that these men are so great
[42:59] but this place is so wicked that even if
[43:03] these three men were here I'll still
[43:05] destroy it all except for these guys
[43:08] because they are so great and here is
[43:10] Daniel among two of the greatest in the
[43:13] whole
[43:14] Bible and then even in Daniel's
[43:18] prophecies go on even the Lord Jesus
[43:20] quotes Daniel Matthew chapter
[43:23] 24 he says Jesus referred to Daniel
[43:27] Daniel as a prophet and he said when you
[43:29] therefore shall see the abomination of
[43:31] desolation spoken by Daniel the Prophet
[43:35] stand in the Holy place and then he says
[43:36] who so readeth let him understand so if
[43:40] you're reading Daniel's
[43:42] book understand what you're reading
[43:44] that's what we're here for tonight is to
[43:47] try to understand what we're reading now
[43:49] I'm not going to dig into the depths of
[43:51] these prophecies but hopefully by the
[43:55] end that we'll understand understand
[43:57] more about this Book of Daniel he was
[44:00] educated in science of the Babylonians
[44:03] and he was a Bible
[44:06] reader we know this later on because
[44:10] Daniel was reading the Prophecies of
[44:14] Jeremiah and and and then he saw he had
[44:17] enough Revelation to read the Bible and
[44:19] he believed he's like who wait a minute
[44:22] we supposed to be here 70 years like you
[44:24] were saying before brother Aaron back
[44:26] there there's only a couple years left
[44:30] until Jeremy's Jeremiah's prophecy is
[44:33] fulfilled so he knew Daniel was somebody
[44:36] that studied and and he did
[44:39] well and there's a lot of
[44:43] people brothers and sisters that take
[44:45] Daniel's prophecies even
[44:48] today and they will set a time and it's
[44:53] pretty easy to do because Daniel's very
[44:55] very specific and they'll take a time
[44:57] and they'll start adding up the years
[45:00] and applying some correction for 360
[45:02] days versus 365 and and you get it all
[45:05] worked out and then you come up with a
[45:10] date Jesus said don't do that in fact he
[45:13] said the one that does that don't
[45:14] believe him but I'll tell you what you
[45:18] can get
[45:19] close and that time is right around now
[45:24] I did it a few years ago you know put it
[45:27] together and I'm smart and uh I'm GNA
[45:30] figure this out and I think I came up
[45:32] with
[45:33] 2019 um this is before
[45:36] 2019 that I came up with that date and I
[45:39] kept him myself of of course I knew that
[45:41] Jesus said hey don't listen to somebody
[45:43] that does that and I knew that we're not
[45:44] supposed to do that but I think pretty
[45:48] much everyone that looks into these
[45:50] prophecies and looks into Daniel's
[45:52] prophecies they come up with this time
[45:55] right around now
[45:58] that the Lord Jesus is scheduled to
[46:00] return and it's and the Jews he's
[46:03] scheduled to return the messiah's
[46:06] supposed to come to the Jews after this
[46:09] what we call the Gentile dispensation
[46:12] and we'll get to that in a little
[46:14] while um and this Daniel he was such a
[46:19] great man that this King Nebuchadnezzar
[46:21] Daniel really won his
[46:23] affection and Nebuchadnezzar as as
[46:27] narcissistic as he was and as bad of a
[46:30] temper as he had and gouging out the
[46:32] eyes and killing all these people and
[46:34] invading he respected Daniel and we're
[46:37] going to see why here when we get into
[46:41] the
[46:42] book Let's
[46:44] Start let's go to the Book of
[46:46] Daniel now the Book of Daniel is really
[46:49] basically in two parts the first part is
[46:52] basically the first half of Daniel and
[46:54] we learn about Daniel we learn about
[46:57] this man what he was what kind of a
[46:59] person he was we learn the stories of uh
[47:03] that that are just famous that we all
[47:04] know and then in the second half of the
[47:08] book we go back to the same kind of
[47:11] spirit that's in Isaiah and Jeremiah and
[47:14] Ezekiel where it's prophecies and dreams
[47:18] and Visions so it's really split into
[47:21] two parts the first part we get to know
[47:24] Daniel we get to know the situation and
[47:27] then the second part we see the
[47:30] prophecies that Daniel makes and they
[47:33] are tremendous one thing that's really
[47:36] neat about Daniel is some of the dreams
[47:41] that we see and we're gonna we're going
[47:42] to read one tonight Daniel actually
[47:45] gives an interpretation of it and it
[47:47] actually comes to pass part of it when
[47:50] he's here and then another part of it
[47:54] comes to pass right after a little while
[47:56] after Daniel passes away and then the
[48:00] third part of it comes to pass right
[48:02] when Jesus was here and we'll get into
[48:05] that so some of these prophecies in
[48:06] Daniel are very very easy to interpret
[48:09] and very easy to understand Daniel
[48:12] chapter one in the third year of the
[48:15] reign of jeho Kim remember I said we're
[48:17] going to learn we need to remember two
[48:20] kings this jeak Kim was there when they
[48:23] had the first invasion of Babylon in the
[48:25] third year of the reign of jeim of Judah
[48:28] came Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon into
[48:30] Jerusalem and besieged it and the lord
[48:33] gave jeim king of Judah into his
[48:37] hand
[48:38] notice who
[48:40] gave Judah
[48:43] Israel
[48:44] into Nebuchadnezzar's hand yeah it
[48:48] wasn't all
[48:49] Nebuchadnezzar God had given them up
[48:53] because of their sins and because of
[48:56] their Idol remember God's in charge no
[48:58] matter what no matter how bad things
[49:00] seem to be God is on the throne and he's
[49:03] watching this and whatever happens has
[49:06] to happen either at his direction or he
[49:11] lets it
[49:12] happen and here it was at his Direction
[49:16] yeah the lord gave
[49:18] jeim king of Judah into his hand with
[49:21] part of the vessels of the house of God
[49:23] which he carried into the land of Shar
[49:25] to the the house of his God and he
[49:28] brought the vessels into the Treasure
[49:30] House of
[49:32] God and the King
[49:34] spake unto as panaz the master of his
[49:38] unic that he should bring certain of the
[49:41] children of Israel and the King's seed
[49:44] and and the princes so he invades and he
[49:46] says now bring a certain of the king's
[49:49] seed what's the king's
[49:51] seed Judah the tribe of Judah so which
[49:57] tribe did Daniel come from
[50:02] Judah the children in whom was no
[50:05] blemish but was well favored and
[50:08] skillful in all wisdom and cunning and
[50:10] knowledge and understanding science and
[50:13] such as had ability in them to stand in
[50:16] the king's Palace and whom they might
[50:19] teach the learning and the tongue of the
[50:22] calans and the King appointed them daily
[50:25] provisions of the king's meat
[50:27] and of the wine which he drank so
[50:30] nourishing them three
[50:32] years that at the end thereof they might
[50:34] stand before the king so these captives
[50:38] they were taken out of their home and
[50:41] they were to under undergo a three-year
[50:44] assimilation into the Babylonian Society
[50:48] they would learn their lifestyle they
[50:50] would learn their food they would even
[50:53] I'll read it in a
[50:55] minute have to to let go of their old
[50:58] Hebrew names and be given a new
[51:02] Babylonian name so basically this
[51:06] King in his ways he says you're coming
[51:10] out of there and you are going to be
[51:14] like a
[51:16] Babylonian you're going to follow our
[51:18] rules you're going to eat our food
[51:20] you're going to like what we like you're
[51:22] going to do like we
[51:25] do it's like going to the University of
[51:29] Arizona you go there and they
[51:33] indoctrinate
[51:35] you you're going to be
[51:38] tolerant on of
[51:40] everybody tolerant it's like I hate that
[51:43] word tolerant of
[51:45] what oh you're going to be tolerant of
[51:47] all this sin you're going to be tolerant
[51:48] of all of of everything that's going on
[51:50] in the world but if you're a Christian
[51:54] no there's no we're not going to be
[51:55] Toler of you right you see the hatred
[51:58] come out when someone stands up for the
[52:01] Lord Jesus you see the hatred come out
[52:03] when somebody says no this is wrong this
[52:06] is
[52:07] sin you see the hatred come out they're
[52:09] not tolerant of you but you have to be
[52:12] tolerant of them and here is this
[52:15] assimilation into society that's going
[52:17] on right now with this Prophet Daniel
[52:20] and his
[52:23] friends as I said and the King appointed
[52:26] them daily provisions of the king's meat
[52:28] and wine which he drank so nourishing
[52:30] them three years and at the end thereof
[52:33] that they might stand before the king
[52:35] now among these were the children of
[52:37] Judah
[52:39] Daniel
[52:41] hananiah
[52:42] mishel and
[52:44] Azariah these are the three friends of
[52:46] Daniel looks like these are his closest
[52:49] friends I don't know that for sure but
[52:51] they're together a
[52:53] lot unto whom the prince of the Unix
[52:56] gave names for he gave unto Daniel the
[52:59] name
[53:02] belshazzar and to
[53:04] hananiah and Sh and and of
[53:07] Shadrach and to mishel of me I'm sorry
[53:11] the name belto Shazer for Daniel and to
[53:15] hananiah of
[53:17] Shadrach and to mishel of meach and to
[53:20] Azariah of
[53:22] Abednego so he's like you're going to
[53:24] come
[53:24] here and you're not even going to keep
[53:26] your Hebrew
[53:28] name you're not going to look like a
[53:30] Hebrew you're not going to act like a
[53:31] Hebrew you are going to be a caldan you
[53:33] are going to be a Babylonian unto whom
[53:35] the um but Daniel proposed in his heart
[53:40] that he would not defile himself with
[53:42] the portion of the king's meat nor with
[53:44] the wine which he drank therefore he
[53:47] requested of the prince of the Unix that
[53:50] he might not defile himself the the um
[53:54] brother Jordan and sister Martha your
[53:56] family me the the song that you just
[53:58] sang this is what it's about it's like
[54:01] dare to be a Daniel it's like no I'm
[54:04] going to stand for what I believe I'm
[54:06] not going to assimilate I'm not going to
[54:08] say something is right or something
[54:10] that's okay when it's
[54:12] not and here's Daniel he's saying wait a
[54:14] minute I don't want to eat this food
[54:17] right I don't want to drink this
[54:22] wine now God had brought Daniel into the
[54:24] favor and tender love with the Prince of
[54:26] the Unix and the prince of the Unix said
[54:28] unto Daniel I fear my Lord the king who
[54:30] hath appointed appointed your meat and
[54:32] your drink for why should he see your
[54:34] faces worse like than the children which
[54:37] are of your sord then shall you make me
[54:41] in danger to my head my head to the king
[54:44] so he's like listen if you don't eat our
[54:46] food that the king told me to feed you
[54:48] you're going to get all skinny and
[54:49] scrawny and you're going to look bad and
[54:51] then we're going to come before the king
[54:52] in 3 years and he's going to say these
[54:55] guys don't look good
[54:57] and I'm done Remember The Temper of the
[55:01] king and the fear that they had for him
[55:03] let's skip down to to verse
[55:06] 17 and of these four children God gave
[55:09] them knowledge Shadrach mhach and
[55:12] abendigo and belto
[55:15] shazzar you know what I don't understand
[55:17] I mean just how come Daniel we call
[55:20] Daniel Daniel right his Hebrew name but
[55:23] we
[55:24] call Shadrach mesach and their
[55:27] Babylonian name I don't understand
[55:30] that maybe because they're fun to say um
[55:33] but I don't know as for these four
[55:35] children God gave them knowledge and
[55:37] skill and all learning and wisdom and
[55:39] Daniel had understanding and all visions
[55:41] and dreams so we see this man's gifted
[55:43] now at the end of the days that the king
[55:45] had said that should bring them in then
[55:47] the prince of the Unix brought them
[55:48] before
[55:50] Nebuchadnezzar and he had communed with
[55:52] them and among them was found none like
[55:55] Daniel haniah Melle and Azariah
[55:57] therefore stood they before the king now
[56:01] what they what Daniel had said is he
[56:03] says okay you this this food that you're
[56:07] bringing I don't want to eat what I want
[56:09] to eat is pulse you know what pulse
[56:13] is it's
[56:15] vegetables and and and beans and and
[56:18] stuff like that and drink
[56:20] water so the king is like here's a
[56:24] longhorn T-Bone
[56:27] and a Dr
[56:30] Pepper and here is Daniel saying no no
[56:35] no
[56:36] no we want to eat what's right we want
[56:41] to eat
[56:42] well and even all the way down to his
[56:45] diet this man stayed with the word of
[56:48] God and they fed vegetables and fed them
[56:51] uh uh water to drink and they turned out
[56:54] they didn't really lose weight they
[56:55] looked better at the end than even all
[56:58] these other
[57:00] ones and the king communed with them and
[57:03] among them was found none like Daniel
[57:06] haniah mishael and Azariah therefore
[57:09] they stood before the king and in all
[57:11] matters in wisdom and understanding the
[57:14] king inquired of them and he found them
[57:17] 10 times better than all the musici
[57:20] magicians and astrologers and all that
[57:23] were in that his realm and Daniel
[57:27] continued even until the first
[57:29] year of King
[57:32] Cyrus one thing
[57:35] that is is really amazing one of the
[57:38] things that I see because I I've I've
[57:41] done a lot of writing and and you can
[57:44] see a writing style in different people
[57:48] and here the author of Daniel which I
[57:52] assume is
[57:53] Daniel he says and in all matters of
[57:56] wisdom and understanding that the king
[57:58] inquired of him he found them 10 times
[58:01] better than all the magicians and
[58:03] astrologers and all that were in his
[58:06] realm how do you measure 10 times
[58:10] better he's it's a figure of
[58:13] speech and that's you'll see in this
[58:16] Book of Daniel you'll see there's a few
[58:17] of those in there and Daniel's like he's
[58:21] writing he's like we're way better we're
[58:23] 10 times better than all of those other
[58:26] other ones and it's still the word of
[58:29] God then Daniel
[58:33] 2 and in the second year of the reign of
[58:36] Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed
[58:38] dreams wherewith his Spirit was troubled
[58:40] and his sleep break from him so the king
[58:43] couldn't sleep he had insomnia he dreams
[58:46] this dream he was so worried and upset
[58:49] about this about this dream and what
[58:53] does a king probably think the most most
[58:56] of is his
[58:58] kingdom and you see
[59:02] these men as I was saying earlier that
[59:05] are raised to think that they are a God
[59:08] and then the thing that they fear the
[59:11] most is somebody taking what they own
[59:13] somebody taking what they have somebody
[59:15] taking their Kingdom so the King was
[59:18] he's really
[59:19] upset here did you see in the
[59:23] news that another person like this this
[59:26] this ruler of North
[59:29] Korea killed like 30 of his cabinet
[59:33] members recently did you read
[59:36] that you know why he killed
[59:40] him because there was a
[59:42] flood in his country and a bunch of
[59:45] people died and a bunch of land was
[59:48] lost so he gets upset it can't be his
[59:51] fault it's got to be somebody's fault so
[59:54] he goes and he kills s executes a bunch
[59:57] of his cabinet members a bunch of his
[59:59] loyal people now think on that line he's
[1:00:02] raised to be this man as as set up as a
[1:00:06] god before the North Korean people and
[1:00:08] here is this Nebuchadnezzar he's raised
[1:00:10] to be a a god before his
[1:00:14] people and the King said unto them I
[1:00:16] have dreamed a dream and my spirit is
[1:00:18] troubled to know the dream then spake
[1:00:22] the calans to the to the king andak oh
[1:00:25] King live live live
[1:00:27] forever tell thy servants servants the
[1:00:30] dream and we will show you the
[1:00:32] interpretation yeah I'm sure they
[1:00:35] could anybody can do that you know you
[1:00:39] can make it up if you're a wise person
[1:00:41] you could say oh well you dream this and
[1:00:42] this means this and this means this and
[1:00:43] everybody goes along like nothing
[1:00:45] happened but not in this
[1:00:48] case and the King answered said unto the
[1:00:51] Cal calans the thing is gone from me I
[1:00:53] forgot it
[1:00:56] but if you will not make known unto me
[1:00:58] the dream with the interpretation
[1:01:00] thereof you shall be cut into
[1:01:03] pieces and your houses shall be made a
[1:01:06] dungill but if you show me the dream and
[1:01:09] the interpretation thereof you shall
[1:01:11] receive of me gifts and rewards and
[1:01:13] great honor therefore show me the dream
[1:01:16] and the interpretation thereof and they
[1:01:18] answered again and said let the king
[1:01:20] tell his servants the dream and we will
[1:01:21] show you the
[1:01:24] interpretation like uh just tell us the
[1:01:27] dream and we'll tell you we we promise
[1:01:30] we'll tell you what it means and the
[1:01:32] King answered and said I know of a s of
[1:01:35] a certainty that you would gain time
[1:01:37] you're just
[1:01:39] stalling because you know what's going
[1:01:41] to happen to you here comes the temper
[1:01:44] raising up in the
[1:01:46] king because you see that I've forgotten
[1:01:49] this thing the thing has gone from me
[1:01:51] but you will not make known unto me the
[1:01:54] dream but there is but one decree for
[1:01:56] you for you have prepared lying and
[1:02:00] corrupt words to speak before
[1:02:03] me till the time be changed therefore
[1:02:07] tell me the dream and I shall know that
[1:02:10] you can show me the interpretation of
[1:02:13] it tell me the dream tell me what I
[1:02:16] dreamed and then I'll Trust
[1:02:18] You the calans answered before the king
[1:02:21] and said there is not a man upon the
[1:02:22] Earth that can show the king's matter
[1:02:25] therefore there there is no King Lord
[1:02:27] nor ruler that asks such things at any M
[1:02:30] magician or astrologer or caldan and it
[1:02:32] is a rare thing that the king
[1:02:35] requires and there is none other that
[1:02:38] can show it before the king except the
[1:02:41] gods whose dwelling is not with flesh
[1:02:45] that they're on the right
[1:02:47] track for this cause the King was angry
[1:02:50] and very
[1:02:52] Furious angry and very Furious
[1:02:56] so again there's the style of our writer
[1:02:59] here he said 10 times better and he says
[1:03:02] now you're he was angry and very
[1:03:04] Furious and commanded to destroy all of
[1:03:08] the wise men of Babylon and the decree
[1:03:10] went forth that the WIS men should be
[1:03:12] slain and they sought Daniel and his
[1:03:15] fellows to be slain because Daniel was
[1:03:18] part of these wise men do you know who
[1:03:20] these calans are these wise men
[1:03:22] are Daniel was the became the leader of
[1:03:25] these these are the ones that came to
[1:03:29] Jesus and Saul they were studying the
[1:03:32] the stars and they saw the star over
[1:03:35] Bethlehem these are their ancestors so
[1:03:39] their ancestors were this close to being
[1:03:42] wiped out right
[1:03:46] here and Daniel answered with counsel
[1:03:48] and wisdom to aroch the captain of the
[1:03:51] King's Guard which was gone forth to
[1:03:53] slay the wise men of Babylon and he
[1:03:55] answered and said arok the king's
[1:03:56] Captain why is the decree so Hasty from
[1:03:59] the King then arok made the thing known
[1:04:01] to Daniel then Daniel went in and
[1:04:05] desired of the king that he would give
[1:04:07] him time and that he would show the king
[1:04:10] the
[1:04:11] interpretation that scripture right
[1:04:13] there I think is is a bit under quoted
[1:04:17] Daniel had no idea what was going on he
[1:04:19] had no idea what what this dream was but
[1:04:22] look at the trust that Daniel had in the
[1:04:26] gift that's in his life Daniel knew that
[1:04:29] he was a prophet he knew he had this
[1:04:31] gift and he said listen he said go tell
[1:04:34] the king that I'd like to talk with him
[1:04:36] and I will give him the interpretation
[1:04:38] but he had no idea what it was look at
[1:04:41] the faith that's in this young man
[1:04:46] Daniel then
[1:04:49] arok made the thing known to Daniel
[1:04:51] Daniel went in and desired of the king
[1:04:53] that he would give him time and that he
[1:04:54] would show him the interpretation then
[1:04:56] Daniel went to his house and made the
[1:04:59] thing known to haniah mishel and Azariah
[1:05:02] his companions that they would desire
[1:05:05] the mercies of God of Heaven concerning
[1:05:07] this secret that Daniel and his fellows
[1:05:09] should not perish with the rest of the
[1:05:13] wise men of Babylon so what did he do
[1:05:15] here this young man he goes to his
[1:05:19] friends and he says Hey listen this is
[1:05:22] serious and he says I need your prayers
[1:05:28] he said friends he
[1:05:30] said we're all every there's a lot at
[1:05:33] stake here so please pray that the Lord
[1:05:37] will give us the interpretation so when
[1:05:40] we send out the WhatsApp please pray for
[1:05:44] Sister Anne loer please pray for this
[1:05:47] person or when we gather together as a
[1:05:51] church take it seriously amen these
[1:05:54] young men took it seriously and Daniel
[1:05:57] even though the prophet and the gifted
[1:05:59] person that he was he counted on the
[1:06:02] prayers of his
[1:06:03] friends and how much should we count on
[1:06:05] the prayers for each other from each
[1:06:12] other then was the secret re revealed
[1:06:15] unto Daniel in a night vision then
[1:06:18] Daniel blessed the god of H of
[1:06:21] Heaven Daniel answered and said blessed
[1:06:23] be the name of God forever and ever for
[1:06:25] wisdom and might are his and he changes
[1:06:28] the times and the seasons he removes
[1:06:30] Kings and he sets up Kings he giveth
[1:06:32] wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to
[1:06:35] them that that know understanding he
[1:06:37] revealeth the Deep Secrets he knoweth
[1:06:40] what is in the darkness and the light
[1:06:42] dwelleth with him he's giving praise to
[1:06:46] God I thank thee and praise thee Oh thou
[1:06:51] God of my fathers who has given me
[1:06:53] wisdom and might and has made known unto
[1:06:55] me now that we that we desired of thee
[1:06:59] for thou Hast now made known unto us the
[1:07:02] king's
[1:07:03] matter so the Lord comes to Daniel in
[1:07:07] the middle of the night and he gives him
[1:07:09] a vision and he lets him see what was
[1:07:13] happening with Nebuchadnezzar and see
[1:07:15] Nebuchadnezzar's
[1:07:17] dream therefore Daniel went into in unto
[1:07:21] arok whom the king had ordained to
[1:07:23] destroy the wise men of Babylon and he
[1:07:25] went went and said thus unto him destroy
[1:07:28] not the wise man of
[1:07:30] Babylon bring me in therefore bring me
[1:07:34] in before the King and I will show unto
[1:07:37] the king the
[1:07:41] interpretation and the King answered and
[1:07:45] said to Daniel whose name was belshazzar
[1:07:49] Art Thou able to make known unto me the
[1:07:52] dream which I have seen in the
[1:07:54] interpretation thereof
[1:07:56] imagine going before this king who is
[1:07:59] not happy who has a bad temper can't
[1:08:03] control it and he's about to kill
[1:08:07] everybody that advises
[1:08:10] him Daniel answered in the presence of
[1:08:14] the king and said the secret which the
[1:08:17] king hath demanded cannot the wise men
[1:08:20] the astrologers the mag M magicians the
[1:08:23] sers show unto the king he's not asking
[1:08:25] a question he's making a
[1:08:28] statement but there is a God in heaven
[1:08:31] that reveals Secrets notice he even he
[1:08:33] didn't say brother Jeremiah he didn't
[1:08:36] say I can do it he said nobody can do
[1:08:39] this but there is a God in heaven that
[1:08:42] revealeth the secrets and maketh known
[1:08:45] the King Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in
[1:08:46] the latter days thy dream and the
[1:08:48] Visions upon thy
[1:08:51] head visions of thy Head Upon thy bed
[1:08:53] are these
[1:08:56] as for thee Oh King thy thoughts came
[1:08:59] into thy mind upon thy bed what should
[1:09:03] come to pass Hereafter and he that
[1:09:05] reveal Secrets make known to thee what
[1:09:08] shall come to pass so he's saying that
[1:09:10] you dream
[1:09:13] this and it's for a
[1:09:16] purpose God gave you
[1:09:18] this now he is going to show you what
[1:09:22] this
[1:09:24] means notice that God gave this
[1:09:27] dream to the most influential person
[1:09:30] really in the
[1:09:32] world and
[1:09:33] God remember
[1:09:36] when I believe it was
[1:09:38] kesis
[1:09:40] prophesied about Jesus that one man
[1:09:43] would die for
[1:09:45] many and the Bible says that he
[1:09:48] prophesied because it was his office to
[1:09:52] prophesy it wasn't because he was a
[1:09:53] great man but he held an
[1:09:56] office and here this king holds an
[1:10:01] office so God is giving him him this
[1:10:05] dream for a purpose and then he sends a
[1:10:08] prophet to interpret this dream don't
[1:10:11] you wish that our
[1:10:15] leaders United States and everywhere in
[1:10:17] the world don't you wish that they
[1:10:18] feared God don't you wish that they
[1:10:21] would put this Bible above everything
[1:10:24] else
[1:10:25] don't you wish that that if they were
[1:10:27] troubled or or they saw these things
[1:10:29] that they would seek out
[1:10:31] God and here's Daniel coming to the to
[1:10:34] the greatest leader in all the world and
[1:10:36] he has this interpretation for this
[1:10:39] dream God recognizes leadership he still
[1:10:44] does and he recognized Nebuchadnezzar as
[1:10:47] this leader I believe it was in Jeremiah
[1:10:49] even said my servant
[1:10:52] Nebuchadnezzar yeah so God can you use
[1:10:55] these
[1:10:58] men but as for
[1:11:01] me the Seeker do not revealed to me for
[1:11:04] any wisdom that I have more than any
[1:11:08] living I'm not any better look at the
[1:11:10] humility of Daniel no wonder he so
[1:11:12] beloved of the Lord later on when an
[1:11:14] angel is going to come to him it's he's
[1:11:16] going to say Daniel highly
[1:11:20] beloved and you can see why this man
[1:11:23] Daniel is so special he says he is not
[1:11:25] revealed to me for any wisdom that I
[1:11:28] have more than anybody else but for
[1:11:30] their
[1:11:32] sakes that shall make known the
[1:11:34] interpretation to the king and that thou
[1:11:36] mightest know the thoughts of thy heart
[1:11:39] so the prophet saying I'm not important
[1:11:41] here in the dream that came to you I'm
[1:11:43] simply conveying God's interpretation to
[1:11:46] you a love a true prophet of God how
[1:11:50] they are able to Humble
[1:11:53] themselves and put God first first and
[1:11:55] they can say listen I'm just being used
[1:11:57] at all
[1:11:59] this and you can be used of
[1:12:04] God and if you want to be used of God
[1:12:07] get yourself out of the way use every
[1:12:10] one of these prophets as an example
[1:12:12] Ezekiel I'll tell you what that guy had
[1:12:13] it rough nobody liked him nobody
[1:12:16] listened to him but he became one of the
[1:12:17] greatest prophets in the bible after he
[1:12:20] died and his his book is preserved for
[1:12:23] us today and here is this prophet Daniel
[1:12:25] and he's saying listen I'm nothing I'm
[1:12:27] not doing this for me but that that it
[1:12:30] should be known to you this this
[1:12:32] interpretation Thou King thou oh King
[1:12:35] sawest and behold a great image now L
[1:12:37] listen to watch the king he's probably
[1:12:40] like
[1:12:42] wow as Daniel talks think about what
[1:12:45] this king is thinking oh King saw us and
[1:12:48] behold a great image this great image
[1:12:50] whose brightness was excellent stood
[1:12:52] before thee and the form thereof was
[1:12:55] terrible terrible means frightening or
[1:12:58] powerful this image's head was a fine
[1:13:01] gold and his breast and his arms of
[1:13:05] silver and his belly and his thighs of
[1:13:08] brass not only is Daniel telling him his
[1:13:11] dream but he's going to give him the
[1:13:12] interpretation also his legs of iron his
[1:13:16] feet part of iron and part of
[1:13:20] clay the fine
[1:13:24] gold Daniel's going to go on and he's
[1:13:26] going to say this fine gold of the head
[1:13:30] of this image it's the most powerful of
[1:13:33] them all and the greatest of them all
[1:13:37] and this represents the kingdom of
[1:13:39] Nebuchadnezzar and
[1:13:41] him and then less value and inferior to
[1:13:44] Gold his chest and his arms were made
[1:13:47] from Silver and that is prophesying of
[1:13:51] some another kingdom that's going to
[1:13:53] come in of two you have two
[1:13:58] arms the mes and the
[1:14:02] Persians Daniel or
[1:14:05] Nebuchadnezzar had already happened and
[1:14:07] they were in the middle of the the the
[1:14:09] head of gold then in the near future the
[1:14:13] mes and the Persians are soon going to
[1:14:15] come up they're going to rise up and
[1:14:16] they're going to conquer Babylon so the
[1:14:18] dream is prophetic even though it came
[1:14:20] through this seemingly evil man
[1:14:25] and he keep he continues on with the
[1:14:27] with the meaning of the dream this mes
[1:14:30] and Persians this is Cyrus and those
[1:14:32] that that come in later on in the
[1:14:36] midsection the thighs of
[1:14:39] brass this will happen decades down the
[1:14:42] road this is the Greek Empire that's
[1:14:44] going to come in you know who a great
[1:14:46] Greek that we all
[1:14:48] know part of this
[1:14:50] Kingdom Alexander the
[1:14:53] Great and then
[1:14:55] the hardest and the longest lasting of
[1:14:58] all of this is the
[1:15:00] iron his legs were of iron and this is
[1:15:04] the Roman
[1:15:06] Empire with the Caesars and all that we
[1:15:09] go down the head it becomes less Val
[1:15:11] valuable and less malleable less able to
[1:15:14] bend let's skip to verse
[1:15:17] 45 for time
[1:15:21] sake actually let's just read it I I uh
[1:15:24] he he goes through and he tells it thou
[1:15:27] sawest till that a stone was cut out
[1:15:29] without hands which smokee the image
[1:15:31] upon his feet that were of iron and clay
[1:15:34] and break them into pieces then was the
[1:15:36] iron and the clay and the brass and
[1:15:38] silver and the gold broken in pieces
[1:15:40] together and became like the chaff of
[1:15:42] the summer threshing for and the wind
[1:15:44] carried them away and that no place was
[1:15:47] found in them and that the stone that
[1:15:49] smot the image became a great mountain
[1:15:51] and filled the whole earth this is the
[1:15:53] dream and we will tell the
[1:15:55] interpretation thereof before the king
[1:15:58] now what I just said listen to Daniel
[1:15:59] say it thou oh king art king of kings or
[1:16:03] a king of kings for the god of Heaven
[1:16:06] hath delivered thee a kingdom power and
[1:16:09] strength and Glory So Daniel he's saying
[1:16:13] King God God gave you the kingdom and
[1:16:17] God gave you the power and the
[1:16:20] strength and wheresoever the children of
[1:16:22] men dwell the beasts of the field and of
[1:16:24] the the fowls in the heaven that hath he
[1:16:27] given into the hand hath made thee a
[1:16:30] ruler over them
[1:16:31] all thou art this head of
[1:16:35] gold God made you this Nebuchadnezzar
[1:16:37] you're the
[1:16:39] ruler you're the head of gold and after
[1:16:43] thee shall arise another kingdom
[1:16:45] inferior to thee and a third Kingdom of
[1:16:47] brass which shall bear rule over the
[1:16:50] earth and the fourth Kingdom shall be
[1:16:52] strong as iron for as much as iron
[1:16:54] breaks into pieces and and subdueth all
[1:16:57] things and as iron that breakthe things
[1:16:59] shall it break in pieces and Bruise
[1:17:02] whereas thou saw us the feet and the
[1:17:04] toes part of The Potter's clay and part
[1:17:06] of the iron and the kingdom shall be
[1:17:08] divided but there shall be in the
[1:17:10] strength of the iron for as much as thou
[1:17:12] sawest the iron mixed with myy
[1:17:16] clay and as the toes of the feet were
[1:17:18] part iron and part clay so the kingdom
[1:17:21] shall be partly strong and partly broken
[1:17:24] whereas th th sawest iron mixed with
[1:17:26] Clay they shall mingle themselves with
[1:17:27] the seed of men and they shall not
[1:17:29] cleave one to another even as iron is
[1:17:32] not mixed with clay and in the days of
[1:17:35] these Kings shall the god of heaven so
[1:17:37] he's saying that these this iron and
[1:17:39] clay and the
[1:17:41] feet that this represents different
[1:17:43] Kings we're going to hear about this in
[1:17:46] the Book of Revelation in fact we're
[1:17:47] going to hear about later on in Daniel
[1:17:50] and then we'll hear about it again in
[1:17:51] the Book of
[1:17:52] Revelation um I'll I'll pause right
[1:17:55] there the 70 weeks of Daniel the Daniel
[1:17:58] series it's a great one to listen to as
[1:18:01] we are going through this Daniel and
[1:18:03] you'll see the things that I'm saying
[1:18:06] you'll see where I get
[1:18:08] them and in the days of these Kings
[1:18:11] shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom
[1:18:13] which shall never be destroyed and the
[1:18:15] kingdom shall not be left to other
[1:18:18] people but it shall break into pieces
[1:18:19] and consume all these kingdoms and it
[1:18:21] shall stand forever for as much as thou
[1:18:24] sawest that the stone was cut out of the
[1:18:26] mountain without hands that it break in
[1:18:28] the pieces of iron the brass the clay
[1:18:30] the silver the gold the great God ha
[1:18:32] made known to the king what shall come
[1:18:34] to pass Hereafter and the dream is
[1:18:37] certain and the interpretation thereof
[1:18:42] sure then King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon
[1:18:44] his face and worshiped Daniel and
[1:18:47] commanded that they should offer an
[1:18:48] oblation and sweet odors into him and
[1:18:51] the King answered Daniel and said of a
[1:18:53] truth it is that your God is a god of
[1:18:55] gods and a lord of kings and a revealer
[1:18:59] of Secrets seeing that thou couldest
[1:19:01] reveal this secret then the king made
[1:19:03] Daniel a great
[1:19:04] man and gave him many great gifts and
[1:19:07] made him a ruler over the province of
[1:19:09] Babylon and the chief of the governors
[1:19:11] over the wise men of Babylon then Daniel
[1:19:15] requested of the
[1:19:17] king remember he remembered his
[1:19:20] friends and he said Shadrach and meach
[1:19:23] and abedo over the Affairs of the
[1:19:26] province of Babylon but Daniel sat in
[1:19:28] the gate of the
[1:19:30] king and we will stop with Daniel 2 the
[1:19:35] musicians can come and I want to lay a
[1:19:37] foundation for Daniel 3 so put
[1:19:43] yourself in this king's
[1:19:48] place so you're an idolator and and and
[1:19:53] you you've been raised a certain way
[1:19:55] and then Here Comes This Man and you
[1:19:57] have this bad dream and it's tearing you
[1:20:00] up and you can't sleep and there's all
[1:20:01] these different problems and here comes
[1:20:03] this man and he tells you what's wrong
[1:20:07] with
[1:20:08] you he tells you your
[1:20:11] dream he tells you personal
[1:20:15] things he looks right into your heart
[1:20:19] and your mind and he explains what's
[1:20:22] going on and he then not only does he do
[1:20:25] that but he gives the
[1:20:28] interpretation of what's going to
[1:20:32] happen what would you
[1:20:34] do as an
[1:20:36] idolator what would you do as someone
[1:20:39] that doesn't know if this man comes and
[1:20:41] the greatness of this man something that
[1:20:44] you've never seen before in your life
[1:20:46] that the world seems like it's never
[1:20:47] seen and here it comes before you and
[1:20:50] you see this what would you do
[1:20:56] you give him gifts and stuff but there's
[1:20:59] more that happens after this and we'll
[1:21:02] get to that in chapter
[1:21:06] three
[1:21:13] there you deserve the
[1:21:19] glory and the are
[1:21:26] Lord we lift our hands in
[1:21:31] worship as we lift your Holy
[1:21:35] Name you deserve the
[1:21:41] glory and
[1:21:46] beond Lord we lift our hands and
[1:21:52] worship as we live
[1:21:55] your holy name for you are
[1:22:00] great you do me
[1:22:03] Mires so
[1:22:05] great there is no one else like
[1:22:13] you there is no one
[1:22:17] else for you are
[1:22:21] great you do mirales oh so
[1:22:26] great there is no one else like
[1:22:34] you there is no one else
[1:22:41] like brothers and sisters The Book of
[1:22:44] Daniel is really
[1:22:46] great it's it's got
[1:22:49] great it's got just incredible stories
[1:22:52] in it and it's got
[1:22:55] prophecies that we are seeing fulfilled
[1:22:59] today thousands of years
[1:23:01] later Adam did I get all the
[1:23:04] questions did you get the
[1:23:06] quiz did I did I cover all the questions
[1:23:10] I give the kids
[1:23:12] kids quiz so so they can they can read
[1:23:16] through and as I'm going that uh they
[1:23:19] can uh answer questions in there and the
[1:23:22] things that I put on the quiz are the
[1:23:24] things that are very very plainly
[1:23:26] explained in the Bible so we have a good
[1:23:30] foundation for the Book of Daniel so
[1:23:32] what I want to
[1:23:33] do is I I said it on my WhatsApp
[1:23:37] broadcast this morning what I would like
[1:23:39] to do is follow This Book of Daniel and
[1:23:43] I'll try to get done by the end of the
[1:23:45] month when we go to camp and then the
[1:23:48] theme of our camp will be standing like
[1:23:50] Daniel stood where Daniel stood up
[1:23:53] against all all the influences of the
[1:23:55] world Babylon was around
[1:23:58] him and why so many people they want to
[1:24:03] be like the world it's just natural for
[1:24:07] us we want to be like the world we don't
[1:24:10] want to be different we don't want to be
[1:24:13] weird we want to be just like everybody
[1:24:16] else but God requires a
[1:24:19] Daniel God requires us not to con form
[1:24:25] to the things of the world or the things
[1:24:27] the the um whatever it is and it might
[1:24:31] be something in church
[1:24:33] even stand your ground always no matter
[1:24:38] what it is it may be pressure from
[1:24:41] school it may be pressure from work it
[1:24:44] may be pressure even from he from
[1:24:48] Friends stand your ground be a Daniel be
[1:24:52] like this man
[1:24:54] he did not conform to the Babylonian
[1:24:58] ways he didn't conform to their idolatry
[1:25:01] he stood up against them and then God
[1:25:05] stood for him I want to be like this man
[1:25:10] Daniel wait till we get
[1:25:15] to the uh Lion's Den I'll give you a
[1:25:20] little a
[1:25:22] little foreshadowing
[1:25:27] Daniel was
[1:25:29] condemned well Daniel wasn't condemned
[1:25:32] there was a law that was passed that you
[1:25:33] shouldn't pray in uh in a in a certain
[1:25:36] way and that you had to pray to this to
[1:25:39] this
[1:25:40] [Music]
[1:25:42] statue well
[1:25:44] Daniel he um or pray to the king well
[1:25:49] Daniel he came home and he opened the
[1:25:53] windows in his
[1:25:55] house and it was right after the decree
[1:25:58] went out Daniel goes home and he opens
[1:26:01] the window so everybody can see and he
[1:26:03] gets down and he prayed to Jehovah God
[1:26:06] something that was against the law but
[1:26:09] he made a stand and his life was on the
[1:26:13] line in fact he was condemned to
[1:26:15] death great man and his friends did the
[1:26:19] same
[1:26:20] thing the king told them to bow down to
[1:26:23] the statue they said no
[1:26:27] King we ain't going to do
[1:26:29] it and then they were condemned to death
[1:26:32] and then we see Nebuchadnezzar's temper
[1:26:34] rise up in him again but then he he he
[1:26:37] comes back a little bit like like he did
[1:26:39] right here that's all
[1:26:43] stand one
[1:26:45] more you deserve the
[1:26:50] gold and the all
[1:26:56] Lord we lift our hands and
[1:27:00] worship as we lift your Holy Name you
[1:27:06] deserve the
[1:27:10] glory and the
[1:27:15] H Lord we lift our hands to
[1:27:20] worship as we LIF your holy
[1:27:25] for you are great yes you are Lord you
[1:27:29] do
[1:27:30] mirales so
[1:27:32] great there is no one else I
[1:27:39] you there is no one else like you for
[1:27:45] you are
[1:27:46] great you do mirales so
[1:27:51] great there is no
[1:27:54] else

[1:28:08] my brother would you
[1:28:12] come he does Miracles so great and
[1:28:15] there's no one else like you I I love
[1:28:17] thinking this thought the same God that
[1:28:21] Daniel Prayed
[1:28:23] to is the same God that we pray to and
[1:28:27] he hasn't changed and he still does
[1:28:30] Miracles so great and he still does the
[1:28:32] same things if we would just let him be
[1:28:36] first in our
[1:28:37] [Music]

[1:33:29] turn you
[1:33:34] love
[1:33:36] sweet the
[1:33:39] land I
[1:33:40] was on my way well when when I was
[1:33:44] thinking about meditating
[1:33:46] on what to do yesterday on um if we
[1:33:51] should spread the Book of Daniel out
[1:33:54] or if uh we should I should just
[1:33:57] dedicate one service like we've been
[1:33:58] doing to
[1:33:59] it the thought came to my
[1:34:02] mind that well we need we need to move
[1:34:06] forward we can't we can't just
[1:34:09] stop and then I thought well
[1:34:13] why what else are we going to do we just
[1:34:16] move to another book but then I thought
[1:34:21] well if we don't get to his josea if we
[1:34:24] don't get to these these other ones and
[1:34:26] the Lord comes then you can just have
[1:34:30] them explain their book to you
[1:34:33] directly rather than me trying to get
[1:34:36] through it so brothers and sisters if if
[1:34:39] the Lord
[1:34:41] comes I look forward to sitting at
[1:34:44] Daniel's feet and listen to him give us
[1:34:47] testimonies of of Nebuchadnezzar and and
[1:34:50] of his friends and and his prophecy
[1:34:57] because he'll
[1:34:59] know
[1:35:01] and I look forward to the book The
[1:35:05] Prophecies of Daniel being
[1:35:07] fulfilled I think it's pretty obvious
[1:35:10] and that U many of them have been
[1:35:12] fulfilled Daniel even says that they
[1:35:14] have been and and the Lord says that
[1:35:17] they had been when when Jesus was
[1:35:18] talking about about him
[1:35:21] but I look forward to all of these
[1:35:23] prophecies being being finished and then
[1:35:27] our time being here on on Earth being
[1:35:30] over and then we can just rest in the
[1:35:33] presence of our Lord Jesus from now into
[1:35:35] eternity until that time stand like
[1:35:39] Daniel be
[1:35:41] strong don't conform to the things of
[1:35:44] the world stand up against it because
[1:35:48] God will honor that you can be like
[1:35:50] everybody else in the world you can just
[1:35:52] be a clone or you can be a Daniel you
[1:35:55] can be somebody that's
[1:35:57] different God bless you brothers and
[1:35:58] sisters I think what I'll do is I'll
