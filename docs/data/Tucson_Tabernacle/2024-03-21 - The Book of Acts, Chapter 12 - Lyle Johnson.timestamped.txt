[31:28] please pray for my dad he's moving into
[31:31] assisted living soon that the Lord will
[31:34] smooth the transition
[31:36] apply all his need then
[31:40] I got uh
[31:42] brother Glenn
[31:44] just sent me a text
[31:47] a little while ago
[31:49] I asked for prayer this morning for our
[31:51] brother
[31:52] this is Sister Martha's dad
[31:55] he was in his he was in the hospital
[31:58] went to the hospital last night
[32:01] and it looks like he's still there in
[32:03] intensive care he said I'm doing
[32:04] somewhat better
[32:05] the blood sodium has come up about nine
[32:08] points and it needs to Hold Steady
[32:12] then they will try to continue to bring
[32:16] it up more tomorrow otherwise I'm tired
[32:18] because of being in the hospital last
[32:20] night was about five hours of sleep just
[32:23] pray for the Lord to give us Revelation
[32:25] what needs to be going what needs to be
[32:27] going on
[32:28] and then that the staff will determine
[32:31] God's will in it
[32:34] you know friends there's no reason our
[32:37] brother Lyle tonight
[32:39] is going to preach on the book of Acts
[32:41] there is no reason that these promises
[32:45] that are in this book cannot manifest
[32:48] themselves today in our lives I was
[32:52] listening to a tape this morning
[32:57] and I got through almost the whole thing
[32:59] it was just tremendous
[33:02] brother Branham it was in 1951. brother
[33:06] Branham was teaching on principles of
[33:08] Divine Healing
[33:10] and
[33:11] he was he was giving testimonies and he
[33:16] said he said and here's Georgia Carter
[33:18] over here
[33:19] and he starts talking about the
[33:20] testimony of Georgia Carter how she was
[33:22] crippled for so many years she had I
[33:25] believe it was tuberculosis and she was
[33:27] bedrid written she couldn't do anything
[33:29] he said the he said the bed frame where
[33:33] her leg was where she was just agonizing
[33:35] pain and rub it she said it was he said
[33:38] it was rubbed smooth I've seen that very
[33:40] bed
[33:41] I've put my hand on that very bed that
[33:45] was rubbed smooth where Georgia Carter
[33:48] laid all of those years
[33:50] in pain then brother Branham he was
[33:53] talking about
[33:54] a couple other testimonies and the
[33:57] people in the audience he said here's my
[33:58] mom over here he said she was there when
[34:01] that light came into the room when I was
[34:04] born up in the hills of Kentucky
[34:07] and he said oh and here's the doctor
[34:09] that that I believe was a doctor I think
[34:12] he got it right was the doctor with
[34:13] Georgia Carter and gave witness and then
[34:16] he says oh and here's brother Upshaw
[34:19] Congressman Upshaw and he gives the
[34:21] testimony of Congressman Upshaw he was
[34:23] in the congregation there and he said
[34:26] Brother come on up and give a testimony
[34:28] and Congressman Upshaw was in the
[34:30] Tabernacle and came up and gave the
[34:32] testimony of his healing being crippled
[34:35] for I believe
[34:37] 66 years
[34:39] I could be wrong about that but it was a
[34:42] bunch
[34:42] they're the what man was right there
[34:45] came up and gave the testimony and
[34:47] brother Upshaw was was just rejoicing
[34:50] about how much he loved the Lord Jesus
[34:53] and all that had been done for him I'll
[34:56] tell you what I was just listening I
[34:58] love brother branham's message you know
[35:02] it's he didn't just talk about this book
[35:05] he put it into action and he showed that
[35:08] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[35:11] and forever and he can still do Miracles
[35:14] he was talking about on that same
[35:16] message he was talking about a uh a
[35:19] young lady called her the nail girl
[35:23] n-a-i-l
[35:25] she was um
[35:27] crippled leaving her legging in her hand
[35:29] from some sort of arthritis brother
[35:32] Branham and she may have even been there
[35:34] brother Brandon said when he prayed for
[35:38] us he was immediately immediately healed
[35:41] of of what was going wrong with her I
[35:45] talked to a friend of mine and she was
[35:47] from a place called Salem Indiana it's
[35:49] about I don't know about an hour away
[35:50] from Jeffersonville
[35:52] a friend of mine
[35:54] was uh he was up there and he was just
[35:58] talking to people and he said have you
[35:59] ever heard of this nail girl
[36:04] I think she said yeah I know the family
[36:07] and my friend said
[36:10] have you ever heard of William Brannon
[36:13] and she said well yeah
[36:16] she said I have and it was either her
[36:19] grandmother or her mother I think her
[36:22] mother
[36:23] was in the hospital
[36:26] dying of cancer
[36:27] told this testimony before but I'm going
[36:30] to tell it again it's great but the
[36:31] silence you hadn't heard it yet
[36:33] so
[36:34] her her mother
[36:37] was in the hospital dying of cancer in
[36:42] the hospital room
[36:43] and there was a lady next to her on the
[36:46] other side of the curtain
[36:48] and she was she was in in bed she had
[36:53] two friends
[36:54] her two friends and this lady was dying
[36:57] too her two friends heard about brother
[36:59] branham's Ministry
[37:01] so they made the trip to Jeffersonville
[37:04] as I said about an hour they went to
[37:06] Jeffersonville and they were in the
[37:08] audience
[37:09] brother Branham was going through the
[37:12] audience and he says you you two sisters
[37:15] he said there is a you are praying for
[37:20] your friend who's in the hospital who's
[37:22] dying of cancer
[37:24] and she they both Rejoice this they said
[37:28] that's that's what we're praying for he
[37:31] said take that handkerchief I don't have
[37:33] one he said take that handkerchief
[37:35] that's that's in your purse or whoever
[37:38] was pull it out take that handkerchief
[37:40] and go and tell tell her to lay it on in
[37:44] her undergarment
[37:46] according to the book of Acts chapter 19
[37:50] according that they took garments from
[37:53] the Apostle Paul and laid them on the
[37:55] sick and they received their healing
[37:57] so they took they took the handkerchief
[38:00] brother Jeremy they took it back to the
[38:02] hospital
[38:03] and they brought it to the lady
[38:06] and the lady their friend
[38:09] was embarrassed
[38:12] brother Cedric she wasn't she didn't
[38:13] believe in it it's written here in this
[38:16] book she didn't believe in it
[38:20] he said well yeah I don't I don't really
[38:22] want to do that
[38:24] and
[38:26] they uh they tried to convince their
[38:28] friend she wouldn't do it so this other
[38:30] lady that was on the other side of the
[38:32] curtain she pulls back the curtain she
[38:33] says I'll take it
[38:35] and that lady was healed in the name of
[38:39] the Lord Jesus and the other one died
[38:43] and she gave birth to this lady and gave
[38:47] that testimony to my friend

[41:17] good evening
[41:25] praise the Lord
[41:27] tonight we'll continue our exploration
[41:30] of the book of Acts
[41:32] this time
[41:33] our study is Acts 12. it's a short
[41:37] chapter only about 25 verses and but it
[41:40] divides into four parts
[41:42] it starts with a persecution of the
[41:46] church in Jerusalem This Time by Herod
[41:50] second
[41:51] is Peter's deliverance from prison
[41:54] next
[41:56] we see judgment fall on Herod
[41:58] and lastly to focus shifts from
[42:01] Jerusalem and Peter back to Antioch with
[42:05] Saul and his companions
[42:07] to set the stage
[42:09] for brother Daniel in Acts 13.
[42:12] but before we open our Bibles
[42:14] let's pray together one more time
[42:19] Lord Jesus it is such a
[42:22] humbling thing
[42:24] to stand here
[42:26] before
[42:28] saints of God purchased by your blood
[42:30] that terrible price that you paid on
[42:33] Calvary Lord that you willingly paid not
[42:37] my will but fine be done
[42:39] Lord I pray this evening Lord that you
[42:41] would be present in our midst that you'd
[42:44] continue to be present in our midst that
[42:47] you'd anoint the words that are spoken
[42:49] your words from your book lord anoint
[42:52] our ears to hear to receive Lord help me
[42:56] to not be here but that you would be
[42:59] here
[43:01] and Lord help me to be yielded to you
[43:04] help us each one to be yielded to you
[43:06] forgive us where we fall short we're so
[43:09] looking forward to this evening in Jesus
[43:12] name amen
[43:15] while we're standing please turn in your
[43:18] Bibles to our introductory verses found
[43:21] in Acts 11.
[43:23] recall that a group of Believers from
[43:26] Jerusalem had come to Antioch in Syria
[43:29] including some who were Prophets
[43:32] one of them
[43:34] a brother named agabus foretold of a
[43:36] famine a great dearth throughout all the
[43:39] world is how the King James Bible puts
[43:42] it we learned that the word translated
[43:45] as World means land and to a Jewish
[43:48] person all the land meant it would
[43:50] strike the region of Judea Samaria and
[43:53] Galilee
[43:54] the land acts 11 29 then the disciples
[43:59] that is the Christians in Antioch every
[44:02] man according to his ability
[44:05] believed the prophecy and determined to
[44:08] send relief
[44:09] Aid money a collection under the
[44:13] Brethren which dwelt in Judea which also
[44:16] they did
[44:17] they didn't just talk about it they put
[44:19] action to it and they sent it to the
[44:22] Elders of the church in Jerusalem by the
[44:24] hands of Barnabas and Saul and we recall
[44:27] that Barnabas if anyone could be trusted
[44:29] with money Barnabas could be trusted
[44:32] with money
[44:33] please be seated
[44:35] we see the geographic focus of Luke's
[44:39] narrative is Shifting now at the
[44:41] conclusion of Acts 11 from Antioch
[44:45] back to Jerusalem
[44:47] well let's continue then with acts 12
[44:50] verse 1 we read now about that time
[44:53] Herod the king stretched forth his hands
[44:57] to Vex certain of the church
[45:03] does that confuse you at all
[45:07] apart from a reference to Herod
[45:10] condemning Jesus in Acts 4 during prayer
[45:12] seeking boldness to proclaim the gospel
[45:15] acts 12 is the first mention of Herod in
[45:18] the book of Acts
[45:19] now Luke 1 mentions Herod the king but
[45:23] Luke 3 mentions Herod the tetrarch
[45:28] do you find this confusing
[45:30] did Herod die after Mary and Joseph fled
[45:33] to Egypt with the Infant Jesus
[45:36] Matthew's gospel tells us
[45:38] Matthew 2 13 and when they it's the ones
[45:41] that we call the three wise men were
[45:44] departed were departed from Joseph and
[45:46] Mary and Jesus and from herod's
[45:49] Jerusalem behold the angel of the Lord
[45:52] the angel of the Lord appears many times
[45:55] in our uh in chapter 12 tonight even
[45:58] appeared to Joseph in a dream saying
[46:01] arise take the young child and his
[46:04] mother and flee into Egypt
[46:06] flee run for your very lives
[46:09] be thou there stay there don't even
[46:12] think about coming back until I bring
[46:15] the word
[46:16] for Herod will search for the young
[46:18] child to murder him
[46:23] when Joseph arose this was a dream he
[46:26] was sleeping he was commanded to arise
[46:28] and that's exactly what he did
[46:30] he didn't go back to sleep
[46:32] he didn't dilly dally
[46:34] he took the young child Jesus and his
[46:37] mother Mary by night that same night
[46:40] and they departed into Egypt
[46:42] and was there they remained there until
[46:45] the death of Herod
[46:46] that it might be fulfilled which was
[46:48] spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying
[46:51] out of Egypt have I called my son
[46:55] skipping to verse 19 but when Herod was
[46:58] dead
[46:59] behold an angel of the Lord appeareth in
[47:02] a dream to Joseph
[47:03] who was still living with the family in
[47:05] Egypt saying arise take the young child
[47:08] and his mother and go don't flee you're
[47:11] not running for your life
[47:14] just go into the land of Israel for
[47:17] they're dead including Herod the King
[47:19] which sought the young child's life
[47:24] so is Herod dead or a city
[47:27] if so how is he alive in Acts 12 some 40
[47:30] years after he died in Matthew 2.
[47:33] what about John the Baptist confronting
[47:35] Herod over his wife which eventually
[47:37] cost John his life
[47:39] what about when pilate sent Jesus to
[47:41] Herod before condemning him to death
[47:43] some 30 plus years after Herod had died
[47:47] Luke
[47:48] the same Felder who wrote The Acts tells
[47:50] us in Luke 23
[47:53] and they
[47:54] Jesus accusers
[47:56] were the more fierce saying to Pilate
[48:01] he Jesus stirs up the people playing on
[48:04] Rome's fear of the Mob We recall
[48:06] throughout the New Testament narratives
[48:09] that that the Romans really wanted peace
[48:13] pox Romana they didn't want the crowd
[48:15] stirred up in Rome City of a million
[48:19] people
[48:20] first time that had ever happened it
[48:22] didn't happen again for almost two
[48:23] thousand years certainly more than 1900.
[48:26] that they were afraid of the mob so they
[48:29] tried to appease the mob
[48:32] Okay so switching throughout all jewry
[48:35] beginning From Galilee to this place
[48:36] Jerusalem when pilate heard mention of
[48:39] Galilee he asked whether Jesus were a
[48:42] Galilean
[48:45] and as soon as pilate knew that Jesus
[48:47] belonged unto herod's jurisdiction He
[48:50] sent Jesus to Herod who himself also is
[48:53] a Jerusalem at that time of the Passover
[48:56] skipping down to verse 11 Herod with his
[48:58] Men of War set Jesus at naught mocked
[49:01] him arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and
[49:04] sent him again
[49:05] the pilot
[49:07] now the Contemporary audience for whom
[49:09] Luke's text was written would probably
[49:11] have understood all these references to
[49:13] various men all of which are called
[49:15] Herod
[49:17] but it's at least mildly confusing for
[49:19] some of us today we find in the Bible
[49:22] that a king of Egypt is rarely named
[49:24] he's just generally called Pharaoh which
[49:26] is a title it's his office it means he's
[49:28] the king similar to the Emperors of
[49:30] Romer rarely named it's usually just
[49:32] Caesar this or Caesar that
[49:35] well what about Herod is this a title
[49:38] is it a name
[49:41] it's a name
[49:42] what's the name of a person the first
[49:44] Herod founded a dynasty a succession
[49:48] sometimes the rest of the name is given
[49:51] often not it's like me being brother
[49:53] Johnson
[49:54] of which there are many instead of
[49:57] brother Lyle Johnson which limits the
[50:00] number dramatically
[50:03] let's try and unravel this a bit get a
[50:06] little context here so when you're
[50:08] reading from the gospels or acts during
[50:10] your devotions at home you'll have a
[50:12] better idea of who's being referred to
[50:14] what what's going on here
[50:16] when we studied acts 11 we recall that
[50:20] Antiochus for a profanus had a pig
[50:23] sacrifice on the altar Jerusalem
[50:25] the result of this was the maccabean
[50:27] uprising
[50:29] this led to the establishment of a
[50:31] period of Independence in Israel under
[50:33] what became known as the hasmanian
[50:35] dynasty
[50:37] Jewish descendants of The Maccabees from
[50:40] about 140 BC until about 63 BC when
[50:43] Israel became a client state of Rome
[50:46] the housmanians conquered the areas
[50:48] around them and among those areas in the
[50:50] south
[50:51] near Beersheba is a region then known as
[50:54] urumiya the people there were converted
[50:56] to Judaism but usually considered by
[50:58] Outsiders
[51:00] considered to be Outsiders by ethnic
[51:03] Jews well there was a man from irumaya
[51:05] named Herod
[51:07] he married into the hasmonean family
[51:10] and in 47 BC he was made governor of the
[51:14] region of Galilee by Rome
[51:18] around 40 BC the Roman senate greatly
[51:21] expanded his territory and declared him
[51:24] King of Judea now a semi-autonomous
[51:28] state
[51:31] I've put up here a map
[51:33] of the kingdom of Herod the Great I've
[51:36] marked irumia and the South there with
[51:37] an arrow and I've circled Jerusalem to
[51:39] give you a little bit of an idea to
[51:41] geography here
[51:44] so this first Herod this fellow 40 BC is
[51:49] generally known as Herod the Great
[51:52] he's known for many massive Public Works
[51:55] projects enlarging the temple in
[51:57] Jerusalem he's also known for being
[52:00] cruel
[52:01] brutal
[52:02] paranoid
[52:04] he's the Herod of Matthew too that
[52:06] killed the infant boys in Bethlehem and
[52:08] a failed attempt to kill Jesus and from
[52:10] whom Joseph and his family
[52:12] fled to Egypt
[52:14] now this fellow Herod the Great had at
[52:17] least eight wives that we know of some
[52:20] of whom he later had killed some of his
[52:22] children not all but some of his
[52:24] children were killed on his orders too
[52:26] this guy was utterly paranoid and just
[52:29] even weeks before he died he had some of
[52:31] his sons killed
[52:33] he was a ruthless tyrant
[52:36] in fact when he knew he was dying he
[52:38] gave orders that a large number of
[52:39] people would be rounded up and when he
[52:42] died they'd be killed
[52:43] that would result and everybody crying
[52:46] and weeping him because he knew that
[52:47] nobody would care if he died otherwise
[52:48] that's the only way that he'd have
[52:50] sympathy at his funeral this is uh this
[52:55] is a very uh ruthless fellow Caesar
[52:58] Augustus left him in power because Herod
[53:02] the Great was very effective keeping the
[53:04] population under control it's always top
[53:06] priority this allowed Rome to focus its
[53:09] military efforts elsewhere
[53:11] Augustus is said to have remarked it's
[53:15] better to be herod's Pig than herod's
[53:17] son
[53:19] by this he meant that under Jewish
[53:21] dietary law herod's Pig would be safe
[53:23] from Slaughter whereas his son's lives
[53:26] were at risk from their own father
[53:29] the Great rule from about 40 BC until
[53:32] his death believed to be in four BC some
[53:35] say it was 2 BC
[53:37] well after he died his kingdom was split
[53:40] it was split into four pieces
[53:43] his sons became three rulers of three of
[53:46] the pieces and his sister the fourth so
[53:48] they were called tetrarchs where you see
[53:50] in the Bible so and so tetrarch it means
[53:52] that they're a rule of the fourth part
[53:55] so
[53:56] if we take a look at this we see to the
[53:58] north and in light blue here
[54:00] is a territory ruled by Philip one of
[54:03] his sons he's mentioned in the gospels
[54:06] bethsaida on the North Shore of the Sea
[54:08] of Galilee is part of Philip's territory
[54:10] you'll notice in the gospel sometimes
[54:12] the disciples go between
[54:17] they go to bethsaida rather than staying
[54:20] in Capernaum for example because it's
[54:22] under a different jurisdiction if things
[54:23] get a little hot in Capernaum go to
[54:25] peseta things that a lot him to say to
[54:26] go to Capernaum it's different it's like
[54:28] switching counties or something if
[54:30] you've broken a county law you can we're
[54:32] not going to go there
[54:34] okay uh so Philip ruled until about 34
[54:37] A.D Capernaum and Nazareth are part of
[54:40] the territory of Galilee ruled by
[54:42] another son Herod Antipas
[54:44] that's shown there in pale green the
[54:47] Galilee he also ruled this territory
[54:50] down here
[54:52] which is called perea and modern Jordan
[54:56] Antipas is called Herod in the Gospels
[55:00] he's one of the guys that leads to some
[55:02] confusion he's the Herod that married
[55:04] his brother Philip's wife
[55:06] herodias
[55:07] and who eventually ordered the execution
[55:09] of John the Baptist Antipas was also the
[55:12] Herod we just read about at the time of
[55:14] Jesus crucifixion
[55:17] Antipas ruled until 39 A.D when he was
[55:20] deposed and exiled by the Roman Emperor
[55:24] Caligula
[55:26] the large region shown in Salmon or pink
[55:31] was briefly ruled by Herod the Great's
[55:33] son arkalaus
[55:36] he's the one Joseph avoided when
[55:38] returning from Egypt he's very unpopular
[55:41] extremely cruel in fact he was so bad he
[55:44] was so mean that Rome removed him from
[55:46] power in 680.
[55:48] made Judea a province and appointed a
[55:50] succession of Governors over it one of
[55:53] whom was Pontius Pilate
[55:54] Herod the Great sister Salome ruled some
[55:57] small areas that I marked here circled
[56:00] in red
[56:02] and until she died at about 10 A.D
[56:07] let's get up to Herod Agrippa
[56:09] this is the territory of a fellow known
[56:11] as King Herod Agrippa Herod the Great
[56:14] had another surviving son
[56:16] but he didn't rule as a tetrock he was a
[56:19] fellow named aristobulus IV there won't
[56:21] be an exam it's okay
[56:22] but
[56:24] aristobula's son Herod the Great's
[56:26] grandson came to be a king not just a
[56:31] ruler not just a tetrarch and this is
[56:33] Herod Agrippa he's the fellow that we
[56:36] just met
[56:38] in Acts chapter 12. his territory
[56:41] started very small
[56:43] this little piece up here and 37 he got
[56:46] the green stuff which was a territory
[56:49] that his uncle Philip used to rule
[56:51] in 39 A.D
[56:53] Herod Antipas was exiled in his
[56:55] territory was added to agrippa's that's
[56:58] the purple stuff
[57:01] finally in 41 A.D
[57:04] with the accession of Claudius in Rome
[57:06] Herod Agrippa added the territory of the
[57:09] province of Judea
[57:11] this whole thing
[57:12] this combined territory was no longer
[57:15] considered a province but a nation-state
[57:17] obligated to Rome and until his death in
[57:19] 44 Herod Agrippa was King
[57:22] Judea
[57:24] I've circled the cities of Jerusalem
[57:27] caesarea tire and sidon because they all
[57:31] play a part in what we're going to read
[57:33] in Acts 12.
[57:36] no geography quiz either it's okay
[57:40] when Herod Agrippa died the status of
[57:42] much of the territory was returned to
[57:44] provinces ruled Again by Governors and
[57:46] so forth
[57:48] now there's one other guy that comes in
[57:50] here that adds to the confusion a little
[57:52] bit
[57:57] and this is when Paul appears before a
[58:00] man named Agrippa in Acts 25 and 26 well
[58:04] this is not Herod Agrippa of Acts 12.
[58:07] it's his son a group of Junior a grip of
[58:11] the second but in the book of Acts he's
[58:13] just called Agrippa so when act says
[58:15] Agrippa it doesn't mean Herod Agrippa it
[58:17] says Herod when it means Herod Agrippa
[58:20] but it says Agrippa what it means Herod
[58:22] Agrippa too everybody got that okay
[58:25] so Herod produce territory did not
[58:28] include the province soon in Darker
[58:30] green on the map so I outlined in
[58:32] Redwood his territory was a group of two
[58:35] ruled from about 4880 till he fled as
[58:37] the Jewish Revolt unfolded in 66 A.D
[58:40] after his unsuccessful attempts to calm
[58:43] things down
[58:44] this is the Revolt that led to the
[58:46] destruction of the Temple
[58:48] he fled to Rome
[58:51] he lived until 90 or 100 A.D and he
[58:54] became a source for Josephus they
[58:56] corresponded some of his letters are in
[58:58] some of Josephus books and was a source
[59:00] for Josephus of now did this really
[59:02] happen this way
[59:03] okay let's get past the geography before
[59:07] your eyes glaze over
[59:09] and the snoring gets too loud
[59:11] I made this little diagram give you a
[59:13] little bit of a family tree
[59:16] to show the portions of the rhodian
[59:18] dynasty that we discussed with their
[59:19] relationships and and yellow
[59:23] are the names that are used in the Bible
[59:26] referring to those people so you can see
[59:29] there's three different herods
[59:31] there's arkalaus there's Philip there's
[59:34] Herod Agrippa who's a grandson in
[59:37] parenthesis if it says sister son
[59:38] grandson or great-grandson that's the
[59:40] relationship to Herod the Great
[59:44] so
[59:45] now that you've had all of that
[59:47] we'll condense it back down the only guy
[59:50] we're concerned about in Acts 12 is
[59:53] this guy Herod Agrippa grandson of Herod
[59:56] the Great
[59:57] he's the Herod of Acts 12.
[1:00:02] Antipas is exiled and so forth okay
[1:00:06] so I've managed to use how many minutes
[1:00:09] and we're still on verse one we'll be
[1:00:11] out before midnight trust me okay let's
[1:00:14] get back to acts acts 12. let's let's go
[1:00:16] now we've got some context here now
[1:00:18] about that time now what is that time
[1:00:22] after agabus came to Antioch and
[1:00:24] prophesied Paul and Barnabas were sent
[1:00:27] to Jerusalem to deliver the aid
[1:00:28] collected for the church as a result of
[1:00:30] that prophecy about that time Herod
[1:00:33] Agrippa the king stretched forth his
[1:00:35] hands to Vex certain of the church to to
[1:00:38] persecute to oppress to torment
[1:00:42] and he Herod Agrippa through his
[1:00:45] soldiers
[1:00:46] killed James the brother of John now
[1:00:49] this is not James
[1:00:51] who's the leader of the church in
[1:00:52] Jerusalem this is the James that was on
[1:00:55] the Mount of transfiguration this is the
[1:00:58] James who along with John and his and
[1:01:00] their mother tried to get Jesus to
[1:01:02] commit to them sitting on either side of
[1:01:03] him when he came to power in his kingdom
[1:01:06] and Jesus said can you drink the cup
[1:01:08] that I'm going to drink and they said we
[1:01:10] can and he said you will but I still
[1:01:13] can't tell you who's going to sit next
[1:01:14] to me
[1:01:16] okay
[1:01:19] and it seems to me that we're so close
[1:01:21] to Memorial Day that this helps remind
[1:01:24] us in the even in the context of our
[1:01:26] time this week of the great price that
[1:01:29] has been paid
[1:01:30] to bring us the gospel to bring us this
[1:01:33] this Faith this life this word of Truth
[1:01:36] so Herod Agrippa because he saw that
[1:01:39] killing James please the Jews that's the
[1:01:43] Jewish people the judeans we're not told
[1:01:46] why they were happy Herod Agrippa
[1:01:49] proceeded further to take Peter to seize
[1:01:52] him to arrest him
[1:01:54] and we're told then were the days of
[1:01:57] unleavened bread so this was Passover
[1:02:05] how many years do you think of elapsed
[1:02:08] from acts 1 1
[1:02:10] to acts 12 1.
[1:02:14] three years maybe
[1:02:17] five years maybe
[1:02:21] a little more context a little more
[1:02:23] history according to Josephus
[1:02:25] Herod Agrippa was in Rome at the time of
[1:02:29] the emperor Caligula's assassination
[1:02:31] which was January 24th of the year 41.
[1:02:36] Josephus tells us that Herod Agrippa was
[1:02:39] instrumental in securing Claudius
[1:02:42] accession to the throne of the empire
[1:02:45] Caligula is killed Claudius becomes the
[1:02:48] emperor Herod Agrippa is one of the guys
[1:02:51] that facilitates his rise to power
[1:02:55] now whether he had time from January
[1:02:58] 24th to do all the political stuff that
[1:03:01] he did to get authority over these
[1:03:03] additional territories to be declared
[1:03:06] King by the Senate to address the Senate
[1:03:10] to take a ship in the winter I don't
[1:03:12] know what the meds like in the winter
[1:03:14] come to Judea secure his enlarged domain
[1:03:17] get to Jerusalem and have James killed
[1:03:20] by March 22nd that's when Passover was
[1:03:24] in the year 41. it's unlikely maybe
[1:03:28] possible
[1:03:29] Church Traditions claim that Herod
[1:03:32] Agrippa came to Jerusalem in 4380 to
[1:03:34] observe Passover and it was during that
[1:03:37] visit that he killed James and
[1:03:40] imprisoned Peter so whether it was
[1:03:42] almost immediately after his obsession
[1:03:45] to this power in 41 or whether it was a
[1:03:48] couple of years later we don't really
[1:03:49] know but but from this we can say that
[1:03:52] that this period of Acts that we've
[1:03:54] already covered is at least eight and
[1:03:58] probably more than 10 years
[1:04:00] of church history of elapsed and the
[1:04:03] amount of Acts that we have read so far
[1:04:06] it also helps us identify a boundary for
[1:04:08] the prophecy of agabus that we read
[1:04:10] about in Acts 11 about that time and
[1:04:13] verse 1 again is when Barnabas and Saul
[1:04:15] are transferring the collection from
[1:04:17] Antioch to Jerusalem
[1:04:18] might have been as late as 43 A.D the
[1:04:21] famine occurred in 44 or 45 A.D
[1:04:26] okay let's see if we can get
[1:04:28] to verse 4.
[1:04:31] and when Herod Agrippa had apprehended
[1:04:33] Peter
[1:04:34] he put him in prison
[1:04:36] and delivered into four quaternions of
[1:04:39] soldiers to keep him that's four squads
[1:04:42] of Four soldiers each so he's got 16
[1:04:46] soldiers Garden
[1:04:49] Peter
[1:04:51] Herod Agrippa we're told is intending
[1:04:53] after Easter to bring Peter forth to the
[1:04:55] people another kangaroo trial and other
[1:04:58] execution makes the people happy right
[1:05:00] 16 soldiers
[1:05:02] tasked to keep watch over one person
[1:05:06] chained in a dungeon
[1:05:09] Peter therefore was kept under heavy
[1:05:12] guard in prison
[1:05:14] however
[1:05:16] little did Herod Agrippa know not that
[1:05:19] he would have cared at the time that
[1:05:21] prayer was made without ceasing of the
[1:05:24] church unto God
[1:05:27] for Peter
[1:05:28] it wasn't one and done
[1:05:31] they didn't say oh yeah Lord help Peter
[1:05:35] I've got to go out and
[1:05:37] attend my garden
[1:05:39] no these people were sincere
[1:05:42] now we shift our Focus
[1:05:45] from Herod Agrippa to his prisoner this
[1:05:48] this former fisherman From Galilee a guy
[1:05:51] named Simon that everybody calls Peter
[1:05:56] verse six and when Herod Agrippa would
[1:05:59] have brought Peter forth the same night
[1:06:02] that may be a little confusing too he's
[1:06:04] going to bring him forth have it five
[1:06:06] it's going to be in the daytime it's a
[1:06:07] big public spectacle it says that same
[1:06:10] night
[1:06:11] well understand the Jewish day is from
[1:06:14] Sunset to Sunset so what we think of
[1:06:17] right now is Wednesday evening is really
[1:06:20] this is Thursday as far as Jewish people
[1:06:23] are concerned until sunset tomorrow when
[1:06:25] Friday begins so what we think of as the
[1:06:29] night before the Bible was telling us is
[1:06:31] the same night
[1:06:33] so from our perspective it's the night
[1:06:36] before
[1:06:39] so Peter is sleeping Between Two
[1:06:42] Soldiers
[1:06:44] and he's bound with two chains now these
[1:06:48] chains are either the iron Rings
[1:06:50] fastened in the wall or the dungeon
[1:06:51] floor
[1:06:52] or he might be chained to the two guards
[1:06:55] both methods were used in these days
[1:06:58] and they and besides that there were
[1:07:00] Keepers there were centuries before the
[1:07:02] door
[1:07:03] in front of the door that that guarded
[1:07:05] the prison itself
[1:07:07] so we've got 16 guys assigned to this
[1:07:10] guy he's chained with two chains he's
[1:07:13] got two guys in the same dungeon cell
[1:07:15] with them this place is heavily guarded
[1:07:18] 16 soldiers
[1:07:21] so it doesn't seem like Extreme Measures
[1:07:24] for a simple fisherman to keep them in
[1:07:27] jail for a couple of days
[1:07:30] but maybe
[1:07:32] just maybe Heritage grip is a pretty
[1:07:34] sharp guy you have to be able to
[1:07:36] maneuver through all the stuff in Rome
[1:07:38] and all those politics and whatever the
[1:07:40] guys he may be evil but he's no dummy
[1:07:44] maybe he knew that Peter had
[1:07:46] mysteriously escaped from a prison
[1:07:48] several years earlier
[1:07:50] and acts 5 we read
[1:07:52] verse 17 then the high priest rose up
[1:07:55] and all they that were with him which is
[1:07:57] of the sect of the Sadducees we recall
[1:08:00] the Sadducees and we're filled with
[1:08:02] indignation why
[1:08:05] these guys were claiming that Jesus had
[1:08:07] risen from death
[1:08:08] well that's contrary to their Doctrine
[1:08:10] therefore it can't be true therefore
[1:08:12] it's got to be a lie
[1:08:14] they laid their hands on the apostles
[1:08:16] which included Peter and put them in the
[1:08:19] common prison
[1:08:20] but the end
[1:08:24] the ain't opened the prison doors
[1:08:26] and brought them for us
[1:08:28] and sure enough we get back to Acts 12.
[1:08:32] it's the night and behold the angel of
[1:08:35] the Lord
[1:08:36] sounds familiar Came Upon him
[1:08:39] stood by appeared Before Peter a light
[1:08:42] shined in the prison and turned the fire
[1:08:44] brother Brandon says it's the pillar of
[1:08:45] fire that came in
[1:08:47] and the angel smote Peter
[1:08:50] smacked him with a little bit of force
[1:08:52] on the side not the side of the head
[1:08:55] to wake him up because he was sleeping
[1:08:57] right
[1:08:58] and he raised him he lifted him up and
[1:09:00] he said to him arise get up quickly
[1:09:04] and Peter's chains fell off from his
[1:09:07] hands so he was chained by the wrists
[1:09:10] with a chain and a chain
[1:09:14] and he goes on he says gird thyself bind
[1:09:18] on my sandals get dressed put on your
[1:09:22] belt put on your shoes we're going for a
[1:09:25] walk
[1:09:26] and so he did
[1:09:28] Peter was saying he was probably naked
[1:09:32] it's another form of humiliation
[1:09:34] degradation a way to further Inspire
[1:09:36] fear take away hope
[1:09:39] and the angel said unto him cast thy
[1:09:42] garment about thee and follow me
[1:09:44] get your outer garment Peter
[1:09:47] wrap yourself in it leave no trace of
[1:09:49] yourself no trace of your clothing
[1:09:54] and he Peter now fully dressed went out
[1:09:58] at the silver he'd been chained
[1:10:01] and followed the angel
[1:10:03] and and and Peter
[1:10:06] whist not is it he didn't know he didn't
[1:10:08] understand
[1:10:09] that it was physically true that was
[1:10:11] going on he thought he was still
[1:10:12] dreaming that it was a vision
[1:10:15] but
[1:10:17] when they were past the first and second
[1:10:19] ward the sets of guards
[1:10:23] so if there were layers upon layers of
[1:10:25] security to keep Peter in prison
[1:10:27] it's not working
[1:10:29] they came to the Iron Gate that leads
[1:10:32] under the city which opened to them of
[1:10:33] his own accord there was no visible
[1:10:35] being that opened it
[1:10:37] and they went out
[1:10:39] and they passed on
[1:10:41] through one street we might say they
[1:10:43] they walked a block
[1:10:46] and forthwith
[1:10:48] immediately
[1:10:50] at that moment the angel departed from
[1:10:52] him
[1:10:53] disappeared
[1:10:55] was gone
[1:10:59] and and when Peter came to himself
[1:11:03] came to his senses he said to himself
[1:11:06] I'm sure he wasn't shouting out loud to
[1:11:08] everybody now I know of a surety that
[1:11:12] the Lord hath sent his Angel and hath
[1:11:14] delivered me out of the hand of Herod
[1:11:16] Agrippa and from all the expectation of
[1:11:19] the people of the Jews
[1:11:21] in this case is talking about the people
[1:11:24] of Judea when when the Bible says Jews
[1:11:26] sometimes it means practitioners of
[1:11:28] Judaism sometimes it means descendants
[1:11:30] of Israel sometimes it means they're
[1:11:32] rulers and sometimes it means people
[1:11:34] that lived in the land of Judea
[1:11:39] and when Peter had considered the thing
[1:11:43] when he realized what had happened
[1:11:46] he made a decision now it's just after
[1:11:49] Passover we know that Passover is
[1:11:52] the 14th of the month right full moon
[1:11:54] okay so this is just after a full moon
[1:11:57] so there's plenty of moonlight for him
[1:11:59] to move around at night to see where
[1:12:00] he's going
[1:12:01] so he navigates the streets and he came
[1:12:05] to the house of Mary
[1:12:07] the mother of John whose surname was
[1:12:10] Mark
[1:12:11] must have been a lot of folks named John
[1:12:14] for them to have nicknames like this
[1:12:16] where many were gathered together and
[1:12:19] what were they doing
[1:12:21] they weren't partying they were praying
[1:12:24] remember verse 5 prayer was made
[1:12:26] continually on Peter's behalf
[1:12:29] now another little footnote a little
[1:12:32] sidebar have you ever noticed how many
[1:12:35] of the women in the New Testament are
[1:12:37] named Mary
[1:12:40] there's at least six of them that's
[1:12:42] often more confusing than trying to
[1:12:44] figure out who's Herod
[1:12:46] Moses sister was named Miriam a former
[1:12:49] the same name as Mary or Maria means
[1:12:52] rebellious
[1:12:54] Mary is generally taken to mean bitter
[1:12:58] or rebellious we read for example in in
[1:13:00] the Book of Ruth
[1:13:02] 1 19. so they too Naomi and her
[1:13:06] daughter-in-law Ruth once until they
[1:13:08] came to Bethlehem and it came to pass
[1:13:10] when they were Come to Bethlehem that
[1:13:12] all the city was moved about them and
[1:13:14] they said is this Naomi you've come back
[1:13:17] she said unto them
[1:13:20] call me not Naomi
[1:13:22] meaning Pleasant call me Mara
[1:13:25] Mary
[1:13:27] bitter for the almighty hath dealt very
[1:13:29] bitterly with me
[1:13:32] back to acts why would people be naming
[1:13:35] their daughters rebellious or bitter
[1:13:39] it's the context of the time Israel was
[1:13:42] occupied by your cruel Master
[1:13:44] Independence had recently been tasted
[1:13:46] and removed an outbreak of rebellion to
[1:13:49] try and throw off the Roman yoke was
[1:13:51] festering and in only 20 or 25 years
[1:13:53] from acts 12 that Revolt will happen and
[1:13:56] those things don't happen overnight it
[1:13:58] takes time it builds up and builds up
[1:14:00] remember one of Jesus disciples was
[1:14:03] Simon the zealot
[1:14:04] guy that was wanting to overthrow Rome
[1:14:07] by force
[1:14:08] and 60 years after the failure of the
[1:14:10] first Rebellion there was another one
[1:14:12] there was an expectation of a Messianic
[1:14:15] deliverer to the Jews the second coming
[1:14:18] to the Christians it was on the
[1:14:20] disciples Minds in Acts 1 when they
[1:14:22] asked Jesus before the Ascension if he
[1:14:24] was at that time going to restore the
[1:14:26] kingdom to Israel
[1:14:28] in this context it's easy to see why
[1:14:32] there are so many named Mary
[1:14:34] bitter repression Rebellion is what's on
[1:14:37] people's minds
[1:14:39] well back to Peter
[1:14:42] verse 13 as Peter knocked at the door of
[1:14:46] the outside gate a damsel a young woman
[1:14:49] came to Harkin to answer the knocker her
[1:14:53] name was Rhoda
[1:14:56] and when she when wrote a new Peter's
[1:14:59] voice when she heard and recognized his
[1:15:01] voice she was so excited she forgot to
[1:15:03] open the gate
[1:15:05] she ran inside for gladness ran in the
[1:15:09] house and told everyone there who are
[1:15:11] praying
[1:15:12] how God's answered your prayers Peter's
[1:15:15] outside of the gate
[1:15:18] and they the assembled Christians who
[1:15:20] had been praying until that moment said
[1:15:22] to her
[1:15:23] you crazy girl
[1:15:25] Thou Art mad
[1:15:28] you must be out of your mind
[1:15:30] Peter's in prison under heavy guard
[1:15:32] what's gotten into you have a cup of tea
[1:15:35] dear it'll help calm you
[1:15:37] but she constantly affirms she kept
[1:15:39] insisting they argued with her more than
[1:15:41] once it was even so no I tell you it's
[1:15:43] true Peter's at the outside gate
[1:15:46] then said they it's his angel
[1:15:50] now this word specifically means
[1:15:52] messenger it's not spirit it's not
[1:15:55] theophany it's not Divine being it means
[1:15:58] messenger
[1:15:59] so it's kind of a peculiar thing to say
[1:16:02] maybe they thought Peter had sent some
[1:16:04] third party with a message to them about
[1:16:06] something
[1:16:08] it's his angel
[1:16:10] but Peter
[1:16:12] continued knocking hello
[1:16:15] I know you're there
[1:16:17] come to the door open the gate hello
[1:16:22] and when they at long last when they
[1:16:25] finally opened the door and saw him
[1:16:28] they were so glad the Lord's answered
[1:16:31] our prayers
[1:16:32] they were astonished
[1:16:34] they were amazed
[1:16:36] they were surprised
[1:16:39] what they saw
[1:16:41] did not match
[1:16:44] their expectation
[1:16:46] but unlike Rhoda they had the
[1:16:49] president's mind to open the door let
[1:16:50] them in
[1:16:52] Peter beckoning into them with a hand to
[1:16:55] hold their peace
[1:16:57] quiet you'll attract unwanted attention
[1:17:00] with all this carrying on
[1:17:02] he declared unto them how the Lord had
[1:17:04] brought him out of the prison
[1:17:08] and after sharing the miraculous escape
[1:17:11] with him he said go show these things
[1:17:13] tell share these things tell James the
[1:17:16] leader of the Jerusalem Church clearly
[1:17:18] not the one that had just been killed
[1:17:19] Peter knew that
[1:17:22] and to the brethren
[1:17:24] so Peter's not going to go there he
[1:17:27] wants them to go and spread that word
[1:17:28] one suspects that Peter was probably
[1:17:31] concerned that the soldiers might
[1:17:32] already be searching for him he doesn't
[1:17:34] want to draw them to this house he
[1:17:36] doesn't want to draw them to the leaders
[1:17:38] of the church but he wants the
[1:17:40] information
[1:17:41] to spread
[1:17:43] get on your Facebook page
[1:17:48] so
[1:17:49] the place that he stopped at was
[1:17:51] probably known to the soldier to be one
[1:17:53] of the first places they go is Peter
[1:17:54] here we don't believe you tear the place
[1:17:56] apart see if he's there and we read that
[1:17:58] and Peter departed and went into another
[1:18:01] place
[1:18:04] I don't know where that was
[1:18:07] verse 18. now as soon as it was Day
[1:18:10] meaning daylight
[1:18:12] there was no small stir among the
[1:18:14] soldiers
[1:18:15] plenty of commotion plenty of
[1:18:17] disturbance regarding what was become of
[1:18:20] Peter
[1:18:21] these guys are terrified
[1:18:24] because they know
[1:18:25] the type of tyrant that Herod agriba is
[1:18:29] and when Herod Agrippa had sought for
[1:18:31] Peter when he'd summoned him and and the
[1:18:33] messenger he sent didn't find him
[1:18:36] couldn't find Peter after a you can be
[1:18:38] sure a very thorough search
[1:18:41] he Herod Agrippa examined the keepers
[1:18:45] examined interrogated
[1:18:47] when it when you run across that they
[1:18:49] examined him
[1:18:51] it means physical torture
[1:18:54] they physically tortured the 16 soldiers
[1:18:56] assigned to guard Peter and dissatisfied
[1:18:59] with their explanation or lack of the
[1:19:01] same he commanded that they the guards
[1:19:04] these 16 soldiers should be put to death
[1:19:06] hope you let them go you guys
[1:19:10] that's the kind of guy he was
[1:19:13] and he Herod Agrippa went down from
[1:19:16] Judea from Jerusalem and we talked about
[1:19:19] that before Jerusalem you always go down
[1:19:21] from Jerusalem you always go up to
[1:19:24] Jerusalem it's just part of the part of
[1:19:27] the language and and part of part of
[1:19:29] being there
[1:19:30] he went to caesarea
[1:19:32] and they're abode
[1:19:34] stayed there lived his Palace
[1:19:38] the story of Herod Agrippa will now Jump
[1:19:41] Ahead in time
[1:19:42] the 44 A.D this is the third part
[1:19:46] Luke 12. but Luke because Luke wants to
[1:19:49] finish telling us about him before
[1:19:51] returning to the events just after
[1:19:53] Peter's Escape so it's a Flash Forward
[1:19:56] it's a sidebar but what could we learn
[1:19:58] from Peter's story so far from Peter
[1:20:01] he's in prison
[1:20:03] he's chained he's depending on the Lord
[1:20:05] but it's beyond his power to do anything
[1:20:09] about his circumstances
[1:20:12] he's exhausted I'm sure he's not been
[1:20:15] treated very pleasantly in there he's
[1:20:17] sleeping he doesn't know what lays in
[1:20:19] store for him
[1:20:20] but he's not expecting it to be anything
[1:20:22] good
[1:20:24] there were those praying for him
[1:20:26] they were faithful to pray to remember
[1:20:29] Peter's situation they prayed earnestly
[1:20:32] not one and done but holding him
[1:20:34] constantly before the Lord
[1:20:37] but they were caught by surprise when
[1:20:39] their prayers were answered and a
[1:20:41] spectacular miraculous way
[1:20:44] they weren't prepared to believe that it
[1:20:46] had happened their faith was high enough
[1:20:49] that they were praying but their
[1:20:51] expectations
[1:20:53] were low
[1:20:55] then there's Rhoda a young person
[1:20:57] answered Peter's knock she's so happy
[1:21:00] she forgot to unlock or open the gate
[1:21:02] she went back to the adults and
[1:21:03] testified your prayers have been
[1:21:05] answered
[1:21:06] and what did she get for this good news
[1:21:09] reminds you a little bit about Easter
[1:21:11] morning when the ladies came and told
[1:21:13] the disciples that Peter that Jesus was
[1:21:15] risen they didn't get a very good
[1:21:17] reception neither did Rhoda she was
[1:21:19] scorned she was belittled
[1:21:22] why because their expectations
[1:21:25] did not match their faith
[1:21:28] it's how sad
[1:21:30] what are our expectations this evening
[1:21:33] what is brother Lyle's expectation
[1:21:36] with that let's go back to Luke's
[1:21:38] account of Herod Agrippa he's now living
[1:21:40] he made his Abode in caesarea and were
[1:21:43] jumping up in time now to the year 44
[1:21:46] A.D
[1:21:47] verse 20. and Herod Agrippa was highly
[1:21:51] displeased with them of tire and sidon
[1:21:53] we don't know why but we know that he's
[1:21:56] not the kind of guy that you want to
[1:21:57] have highly displeased with you
[1:22:00] so they send a delegation
[1:22:03] and they came this delegation from Tire
[1:22:05] inside they came with one Accord they
[1:22:07] came in unity
[1:22:08] to Herod Agrippa in caesarea
[1:22:11] and first
[1:22:13] they understood politics they made blast
[1:22:16] us the king's Chamberlain their friend
[1:22:19] they secured his cooperation and
[1:22:21] probably today we think of him as being
[1:22:23] Chief of Staff sort of the gatekeeper
[1:22:25] you want to see her at a grip you go
[1:22:26] through blasters
[1:22:28] and they desire peace because their
[1:22:33] country their cities their area was
[1:22:35] nourished by the king's country in other
[1:22:36] words the agriculture of the Galilee and
[1:22:38] the territories that are controlled by
[1:22:41] uh King Herod Agrippa
[1:22:43] or what these people depend on for food
[1:22:49] so again we see we've got these guys
[1:22:51] coming from the north coming maybe 60 or
[1:22:53] 70 miles down here to caesarea
[1:22:57] Agrippa Herod Agrippa has come from
[1:23:00] Jerusalem and this is where his Palace
[1:23:01] and stuff is is in caesarea
[1:23:07] keep in mind that he's the most powerful
[1:23:10] person to rule Judea since his
[1:23:11] grandfather Herod the Great
[1:23:14] he had the support of the Roman senate
[1:23:17] he ruled with an iron fist
[1:23:19] if he were highly displeased with you
[1:23:23] he better grovel at his feet
[1:23:25] he's ruthless
[1:23:27] this is not a nice guy
[1:23:30] verse 21.
[1:23:31] upon a set day Josephus tells us that it
[1:23:35] was during what he called the games of
[1:23:37] caesarea in honor of the emperor Herod
[1:23:40] Agrippa
[1:23:42] arrayed in Royal apparel Josephus says
[1:23:45] that it was a shining silver garment
[1:23:48] sat upon his throne and made an oration
[1:23:52] probably a long speech unto them
[1:23:55] unto them the people the word them
[1:23:58] suggests that the delegation from tire
[1:24:00] and sidon may have been part of the
[1:24:02] crowd
[1:24:04] and the people gave a shout saying it's
[1:24:07] the voice of the God and not of a man
[1:24:10] well you'd expect them to say something
[1:24:13] like that Caesar is worshiped as a god
[1:24:16] it's very common in the empire for this
[1:24:18] sort of thing to go on
[1:24:21] it's a pagan world
[1:24:24] then we read immediately the angel of
[1:24:28] the Lord smote Herod Agrippa not like
[1:24:31] Peter to wake him up
[1:24:34] because he gave not God the glory is the
[1:24:37] reason given it seems a little strange
[1:24:39] but we take it for what it says Herod
[1:24:41] Agrippa was trying to make an example of
[1:24:43] the church when favored through
[1:24:45] persecution reminding everyone how
[1:24:47] powerful he was here God turns it around
[1:24:50] shows everyone that no one is beyond his
[1:24:53] reach his judgment it's a warning
[1:24:57] and he Herod Agrippa was eaten of worms
[1:25:00] now Josephus tells us two days after the
[1:25:04] speech he took ill
[1:25:06] and five days after that in great Agony
[1:25:09] Herod Agrippa gave up the ghost
[1:25:11] the year was 44 A.D
[1:25:15] but in contrast in spite of the efforts
[1:25:18] of Herod Agrippa and his ilk the word of
[1:25:22] God the gospel message grew and the
[1:25:25] number of Believers multiplied the
[1:25:27] church flourished
[1:25:30] a lesson we can draw from this
[1:25:32] experience is that of humility
[1:25:35] to be careful always to acknowledge the
[1:25:38] hand of the Lord in our lives
[1:25:40] not out of fear of death by worms but
[1:25:44] out of respect for love
[1:25:47] for the Lord he is the source of
[1:25:51] everything
[1:25:52] it's by his grace and that alone that we
[1:25:55] exist and have our being he's the
[1:25:57] Fountain of Living Waters
[1:25:59] he's the bread of life
[1:26:01] our faith in whatever measure we may
[1:26:03] possess is a gift from him
[1:26:06] we need to exercise it we need to
[1:26:08] nourish it we need to help it grow
[1:26:11] but it starts as a seed gift
[1:26:13] from the Almighty
[1:26:15] well there's one more verse in Acts 12.
[1:26:19] here Luke returns Us in time to just
[1:26:23] after Peter's escape from prison
[1:26:29] Paul and Barnabas had arrived in
[1:26:31] Jerusalem
[1:26:32] they delivered to the elders and
[1:26:34] Jerusalem The Collection taken by the
[1:26:36] church at Antioch for the aid of the
[1:26:38] Believers in Judea
[1:26:40] we don't know how long they stayed it's
[1:26:41] likely they were there for just a few
[1:26:43] weeks or maybe a couple of months it was
[1:26:45] Passover season
[1:26:47] so this is stepping back in time
[1:26:49] from the death of Herod Agrippa
[1:26:52] verse 25 and Barnabas and Saul returned
[1:26:56] to Antioch from Jerusalem when they had
[1:26:59] fulfilled their Ministry of delivering
[1:27:02] the collection made for Judea by the
[1:27:04] Christians and Antioch
[1:27:06] and took with them from Jerusalem to
[1:27:09] Antioch John
[1:27:11] whose surname was Mark
[1:27:13] that's the son of the woman to whose
[1:27:16] house Peter went after his Escape that
[1:27:18] we read about in verse 12.
[1:27:20] Colossians 4 10 is often interpreted as
[1:27:23] indicating that this John Mark was a
[1:27:26] nephew or a cousin of Barnabas
[1:27:28] he was related
[1:27:31] once again the transitions us
[1:27:33] geographically then from Jerusalem to
[1:27:35] Antioch and Syria
[1:27:38] now you've probably noticed in these
[1:27:40] last couple of chapters that we've
[1:27:42] looked at that Barnabas is pretty tight
[1:27:43] with Saul
[1:27:45] he defended into the church in Jerusalem
[1:27:47] after Saul's conversion
[1:27:49] they're sent out together
[1:27:52] they're both Jews born in the diaspora
[1:27:55] outside the land
[1:27:56] of Israel Saul was born in Tarsus
[1:27:59] we're told he was educated in Jerusalem
[1:28:02] under gamalia
[1:28:04] Christian tradition from ancient times
[1:28:06] indicates that Barnabas who was born in
[1:28:09] Cyprus was also a student of gamalia
[1:28:13] if that's true then they likely met and
[1:28:16] knew each other during their years of
[1:28:18] training
[1:28:19] that may have known each other before
[1:28:21] they became Christians
[1:28:23] now in the next chapter of Acts 13 tells
[1:28:27] of Paul and Barnabas and Mark how they
[1:28:29] were sent from Antioch oh I don't want
[1:28:32] to spoil it brother
[1:28:34] well that brother Daniel tell you next
[1:28:35] time that we get together about acts but
[1:28:37] before we close tonight
[1:28:42] I want to go back and revisit that group
[1:28:44] that was praying for Peter
[1:28:47] I think there's an important takeaway
[1:28:50] that we can learn from them
[1:28:53] I mentioned their faith was high
[1:28:56] their expectations didn't quite match
[1:28:58] their faith
[1:29:00] I know we've been told many times about
[1:29:02] getting what we expect or what we invest
[1:29:06] in a church service
[1:29:09] I want to read to you a story that most
[1:29:12] if not all of you are familiar with
[1:29:14] it's an event in the life of brother
[1:29:16] Branham
[1:29:17] but it's much more than that
[1:29:20] it's about expectations
[1:29:22] and priorities
[1:29:24] faith
[1:29:25] and love
[1:29:27] it takes place
[1:29:29] in the late 1940s it's from a sermon
[1:29:32] titled expectation
[1:29:34] from July 14 1951. it's a little lengthy
[1:29:38] but please bear with me while I read it
[1:29:40] to you
[1:29:42] brother Brandon says here not long ago I
[1:29:45] was coming from Dallas Texas in Spring
[1:29:47] and I thought I was flying back I was
[1:29:50] grounded in Memphis right where my had
[1:29:54] to be one night on the fifth at Memphis
[1:29:56] Tennessee I was grounded there
[1:29:58] they put me up there in that I believe
[1:30:00] the Peabody Hotel it's called it's a
[1:30:03] very nice place myself I couldn't afford
[1:30:05] to go in it but the airline sent me up
[1:30:07] there
[1:30:08] and I remember that morning they called
[1:30:10] me said now the plane will leave at 8
[1:30:12] o'clock Reverend Branham said they'll be
[1:30:15] by to pick you up
[1:30:17] I said yes sir
[1:30:20] I got my letters ready was going to go
[1:30:22] down to mail the letters now listen
[1:30:24] closely I'm going to close in a minute
[1:30:26] and I thought oh my I'll go down and
[1:30:30] mail these letters
[1:30:31] I got out
[1:30:33] started down the street
[1:30:35] trying to find the post office and I was
[1:30:37] walking down the street singing that
[1:30:39] little Pentecostal song Let's see
[1:30:41] telling now both far and wide his power
[1:30:44] is yet the same I'm so glad that I can
[1:30:48] say I'm one of them brother Ryan you
[1:30:51] remember when you used to sing it
[1:30:53] and going singing that little song and
[1:30:55] after a while I felt something going
[1:30:59] got close
[1:31:01] I stepped back up behind a great big
[1:31:04] column there and I said Heavenly Father
[1:31:08] what would you have your servant do
[1:31:11] it kept going
[1:31:15] I was real still a minute
[1:31:17] I heard a deep voice say turn
[1:31:20] go back
[1:31:23] well I turned and went walking back down
[1:31:25] the street I walked and I walked on past
[1:31:29] the hotel on down to South Memphis just
[1:31:32] walking on and on
[1:31:35] the sun was way high then the sun was up
[1:31:37] it was a beautiful spring morning the
[1:31:39] fragrance of the flowers in the air had
[1:31:42] perfumed the air I thought how beautiful
[1:31:46] was going walking along there I thought
[1:31:49] Lord I don't know you said walk here I
[1:31:53] am I'm walking
[1:31:55] I just kept on walking
[1:31:58] walking
[1:32:00] walked out dirt near the other side of
[1:32:02] Memphis
[1:32:03] I remember going down a little Hill
[1:32:04] towards our little creek of thing ran
[1:32:08] down through this way a little tributary
[1:32:09] there at the river of some kind I just
[1:32:12] went walking down through there
[1:32:15] there was a little whitewashed Hut down
[1:32:18] there a lot of colored people lived down
[1:32:20] in that way I was walking down through
[1:32:22] their singing or humming to myself only
[1:32:25] believe
[1:32:26] only Billy Satan said you're gonna miss
[1:32:32] I said I'll walk
[1:32:34] all things are possible don't let them
[1:32:38] tell you a lie
[1:32:39] he's a liar when God's a leading you do
[1:32:42] what God Said do
[1:32:43] yes sir
[1:32:45] he tells you you've healed believe it
[1:32:47] just start walking on and I just kept on
[1:32:51] like that singing only believe
[1:32:55] I was noticing
[1:32:57] leaning across a gate like this
[1:33:00] there was a typical Jemima great big
[1:33:02] heavy set colored woman with a man's
[1:33:05] shirt tied around her head
[1:33:06] she was leaning out across there
[1:33:09] I kind of quit singing humming
[1:33:12] when I was about as far as that wall
[1:33:14] from her I just went walking on by
[1:33:19] and when I got there she kind of looked
[1:33:22] at me and laughed
[1:33:24] those big white teeth showed
[1:33:27] her tear streaked face like that she
[1:33:29] said good moan and possum
[1:33:32] I turned now Parson means minister
[1:33:35] Reverend down in the South said
[1:33:38] good moan and possum
[1:33:40] I looked around
[1:33:42] said good morning Auntie
[1:33:45] I said say how did you know I was a
[1:33:47] person
[1:33:49] she smiled
[1:33:51] wiped her eyes I thought
[1:33:53] here it is something's going on
[1:33:57] I could feel the spirit
[1:33:58] I'd walked far enough then
[1:34:01] my when I think about it
[1:34:03] my heart leaps I turned around I said
[1:34:06] how would you know I was a person
[1:34:09] she said possum
[1:34:11] did you ever read in the Bible about
[1:34:13] that woman that had that baby by promise
[1:34:17] I said yes Auntie I've read that many a
[1:34:20] time I preached on it not long ago
[1:34:23] she said as that kind of woman too
[1:34:26] I told the Lord if he'd give me a child
[1:34:28] I'd raise it for him he said possum the
[1:34:32] Lord give me a boy and I raised him that
[1:34:35] he was in his teens said
[1:34:37] he took a road that's wrong
[1:34:39] got out with some bad company
[1:34:42] said he's laying here dying now
[1:34:46] he caught a bad disease the doctors
[1:34:48] can't do nothing for him
[1:34:50] said they give them all kind of shots
[1:34:53] said
[1:34:55] slider said he laid in here dying
[1:34:59] said he'd been unconscious since the day
[1:35:02] before yesterday
[1:35:03] said he don't know nothing he thinks
[1:35:06] he's out in a big deep sea somewhere
[1:35:08] cold said possum it just breaks my heart
[1:35:12] to see if my boy die like that said I I
[1:35:15] want him saved he said I prayed all
[1:35:18] night
[1:35:19] I said Lord you give me that baby but
[1:35:22] where's the Elijah
[1:35:24] she said now Lord will you help me don't
[1:35:28] let my baby die like this
[1:35:30] and said and the Lord told me this
[1:35:33] morning
[1:35:34] and said I kind of fell asleep there in
[1:35:37] my chair I dreamed that I was to come
[1:35:40] out here and stand in this gate and I'd
[1:35:44] see a man coming
[1:35:45] dressed like you is
[1:35:48] who am I
[1:35:50] you know that makes you feel I don't
[1:35:52] know if you've ever had an experience
[1:35:54] like that
[1:35:56] I said Auntie mark my name is Branham
[1:35:59] did you ever hear me before she said no
[1:36:03] so I never heard of you
[1:36:05] oh my I said auntie I pray for the sick
[1:36:08] she said do you
[1:36:11] I said
[1:36:13] can I come in to see your boy
[1:36:15] she said show Possum
[1:36:18] she raised that little gate back with
[1:36:20] the chain on it and a plow point for a
[1:36:22] weight weight behind it I I've went into
[1:36:24] King's palaces I went into big fine
[1:36:27] homes
[1:36:28] but it never was more welcome than I was
[1:36:30] when I walked in that little gate that
[1:36:32] morning under that trestle
[1:36:35] she walked just as happy she knew
[1:36:37] something had to happen
[1:36:39] God was on both ends of the line
[1:36:43] I need to comment here
[1:36:46] we hold the early Believers in high
[1:36:49] esteem as we should
[1:36:51] often
[1:36:53] we put them on a pedestal
[1:36:55] wondering if we could ever be like them
[1:36:57] have that kind of Faith Church of the
[1:37:01] book of Acts when Peter came from prison
[1:37:03] to the gate at John Mark's mother's
[1:37:04] house where they had been praying and
[1:37:06] praying on his behalf they sent a young
[1:37:08] girl to answer the door
[1:37:10] see he would be there this time of the
[1:37:11] night didn't want to interrupt the
[1:37:13] prayer meeting
[1:37:14] but when Rhoda reported it was Peter
[1:37:16] they didn't believe God had answered
[1:37:19] their prayers they weren't expecting
[1:37:21] Peter
[1:37:23] in Memphis Tennessee more than 70 years
[1:37:26] ago someone else is praying for her son
[1:37:29] to get out of a different kind of prison
[1:37:32] and she was waiting
[1:37:34] by the gate to open it because she had
[1:37:36] faith and was willing to step out into a
[1:37:39] Cold Spring morning to wait in another
[1:37:41] place brother Branham says her back was
[1:37:43] wet with Dew from standing out there she
[1:37:47] didn't just step out the door and here
[1:37:48] comes brother Branham but she expected
[1:37:51] him and she waited until her expectation
[1:37:54] was met
[1:37:56] where's our faith
[1:37:57] where are our actions to back that Faith
[1:38:00] where are my actions
[1:38:03] back to brother branham's sermon
[1:38:09] I said can I come in to see you
[1:38:13] you said she was had to happen God was
[1:38:16] on both ends of the line so I walked
[1:38:18] into the room
[1:38:19] first thing up on there was a little old
[1:38:21] sign God bless our home little old chunk
[1:38:24] stove that we call it in the South
[1:38:25] setting there a little poster bed
[1:38:28] it was a great big Stout looking boy
[1:38:31] about 180 pounds 17 18 years old
[1:38:35] laying there with a blanket in his hand
[1:38:38] going
[1:38:39] um
[1:38:40] like that he said this is so cool mama
[1:38:46] um
[1:38:47] she patted them she said Madness baby
[1:38:51] I thought right then of motherly love no
[1:38:54] matter what he'd done how much disgrace
[1:38:56] it was still mother's baby
[1:39:00] she kissed her on his forehead
[1:39:02] and I thought if
[1:39:04] love of a mother can go like that what
[1:39:07] will the love of God do
[1:39:09] when he said a mother may forget her
[1:39:12] suckling babe but I'll never forget you
[1:39:15] I think Amazing Grace
[1:39:18] How Sweet the Sound that saved a Wretch
[1:39:21] like Me
[1:39:23] then while she was over her boy there I
[1:39:25] said auntie
[1:39:27] let's pray
[1:39:29] she never said nothing about his healing
[1:39:33] she wanted him to be saved
[1:39:35] and so before he went she wanted to have
[1:39:38] a witness that he was saved
[1:39:41] and that Old Saint got down on the floor
[1:39:44] I couldn't pray
[1:39:45] or her prey oh my she opened up that
[1:39:48] heart and the tears rolling down her
[1:39:50] cheeks she said Lo if you just let him
[1:39:54] tell me that I'm going to be with with
[1:39:57] Jesus said I'll be happy
[1:40:00] and like that
[1:40:01] I just note there
[1:40:03] held my head down
[1:40:05] cried like a baby
[1:40:07] in a few moments she raised up she said
[1:40:10] Thank You Lord
[1:40:12] she went over she said mama's baby
[1:40:15] patted it like that
[1:40:17] I felt his feet
[1:40:19] just as cold as they could be death was
[1:40:21] on that boy
[1:40:23] and he said I said does he she said he
[1:40:27] don't know
[1:40:29] I said
[1:40:31] I spoke to the boys said how are you
[1:40:33] feeling now young man he just kept going
[1:40:35] hmm
[1:40:37] she said
[1:40:38] he don't know what he's at possum
[1:40:41] he ain't been conscious for two days now
[1:40:45] I said
[1:40:46] let's pray again sister
[1:40:49] did you notice that
[1:40:51] no longer anti a polite but impersonal
[1:40:55] he'd heard her pray
[1:40:57] now it's sister
[1:40:59] family
[1:41:01] we knelt on the floor I said Heavenly
[1:41:04] Father somehow or another last night a
[1:41:08] storm came up and you grounded the plane
[1:41:12] don't you believe all things were
[1:41:13] together for good
[1:41:15] I said
[1:41:17] on my road home to the meeting I said
[1:41:19] you grounded the plane and this morning
[1:41:21] when the Sun was shining I know the
[1:41:23] hours has passed time for it to leave
[1:41:26] but somehow you led me down this way I
[1:41:30] don't understand but I'm putting my
[1:41:32] hands on this boy in the name of Jesus
[1:41:34] Christ your son and asking for his life
[1:41:37] to be spared
[1:41:40] and then no more the prayer had been
[1:41:43] made I heard him go oh I said oh mama
[1:41:48] she raised up said what do mama's baby
[1:41:51] want
[1:41:52] said Mama it's getting light in the room
[1:41:56] let's get in light in the room
[1:41:59] she began crying I raised up my hands
[1:42:02] began to offer praise up off that bed
[1:42:05] come that big healthy boy restored to
[1:42:08] his normal condition
[1:42:12] a few months after that
[1:42:14] I was passing through on a train I
[1:42:16] stopped in to get something to eat I
[1:42:18] heard somebody holler Paulson Branham
[1:42:21] he was pulling one of these little old
[1:42:23] carts around like that there down there
[1:42:25] at the station working
[1:42:27] he run grabbed a hold of my hand said
[1:42:30] you remember me
[1:42:33] I think musicians would please come
[1:42:35] I said
[1:42:36] no I don't he said I was the boy you
[1:42:40] come to that moaning that the Lord LED
[1:42:42] you down there when Mammy was praying
[1:42:45] says possum Branham I was perfectly
[1:42:48] whole now I was a Christian now
[1:42:51] Christian
[1:42:52] oh brother and you know what that plane
[1:42:55] never left
[1:42:56] something happened to it it was about an
[1:42:58] hour late
[1:42:59] I got on the plane and got home in time
[1:43:02] anyhow
[1:43:05] let me tell you something
[1:43:07] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:43:10] and forever
[1:43:11] his power is omnipotent he can't fail
[1:43:15] he's the same God that was in Memphis
[1:43:17] Tennessee that night
[1:43:19] Fort Wayne Indiana is here tonight do
[1:43:22] you believe that he's the same he can't
[1:43:25] fail
[1:43:27] and he's the same here in Tucson Arizona
[1:43:31] tonight in 2023
[1:43:34] let's not be like those that were
[1:43:36] praying for Peter and were astonished
[1:43:39] when the Lord answered their prayers
[1:43:42] let's be like that sister in South
[1:43:44] Memphis
[1:43:45] motivated by undying love and concern
[1:43:49] stepping out in faith
[1:43:51] not astonished
[1:43:53] grateful
[1:43:55] Acts 12. expectation
[1:43:59] what do we expect
[1:44:03] there's another song
[1:44:05] the brother John Simon shared with me
[1:44:07] back in the summer in 1970.
[1:44:10] it reminds me of Peter in Acts 12. it
[1:44:14] reminds me of brother Branham
[1:44:16] in Memphis
[1:44:18] it makes me think about where we should
[1:44:20] be tonight in Tucson
[1:44:23] it's called keep walking
[1:44:25] I don't know if you know it or not if
[1:44:26] you don't you can fake it but sing along
[1:44:28] with me they're tuned simple
[1:44:31] I searched and I searched for the road
[1:44:35] that leads to Glory I wondered if I'd
[1:44:39] ever find a way
[1:44:43] I sat down to rest for my feet had grown
[1:44:48] so weary but then I Heard a Voice Within
[1:44:52] Me say
[1:44:55] it's got to keep on walking just keep
[1:44:59] right on walk
[1:45:01] Walking in the light of the Lord you'll
[1:45:07] get to Heaven someday if you walk the
[1:45:12] right way walking in the light of the
[1:45:17] Lord
[1:45:19] I prayed and I prayed for the Lord to
[1:45:24] give me mercy I prayed for him to
[1:45:28] brighten up my way
[1:45:33] so afraid for the road became so lonely
[1:45:38] and then I Heard a Voice Within Me said
[1:45:42] you you've got to keep on walking just
[1:45:48] keep right on water
[1:45:51] walking in the light of the Lord
[1:45:59] [Music]
[1:46:03] walking in the light of the Lord
[1:46:09] after a while
[1:46:11] I felt something going
[1:46:14] got close
[1:46:16] I stepped back up behind a great big
[1:46:18] column there and said Heavenly Father
[1:46:21] what would you have your servant do it
[1:46:25] kept going
[1:46:27] Israel still a minute
[1:46:30] voice say turn go back
[1:46:34] well I turned it went walking back down
[1:46:36] the street I walked and I walked on past
[1:46:40] the hotel and down to South Memphis just
[1:46:43] walking on and on
[1:46:45] was going walking along there I thought
[1:46:48] Lord I don't know you said walk
[1:46:52] here I am I'm walking
[1:46:54] I just kept on walking
[1:46:57] walking
[1:46:58] walking
[1:47:00] walked out pretty near the other side of
[1:47:02] Memphis
[1:47:04] you've got to keep on walking just keep
[1:47:09] right on walking
[1:47:11] walking in the line of the Lord
[1:47:17] you'll get to Heaven someday if you walk
[1:47:22] the right way
[1:47:31] and
[1:47:32] do you appreciate that
[1:47:34] [Music]
[1:47:38] I'll tell you something
[1:47:41] foreign
[1:47:44] like that
[1:47:47] it takes
[1:47:50] a lot of preparation
[1:47:53] I talked with blue Lyle on Sunday and I
[1:47:55] talked with him before service tonight
[1:47:57] how much of a study that it went in to
[1:48:03] being able to lay these things out like
[1:48:05] that
[1:48:06] and also
[1:48:09] when I would talk to him he'd say he'd
[1:48:11] say I just want to present what the Lord
[1:48:13] wants me to present I just want to be a
[1:48:16] blessing to the people I want I want
[1:48:18] them to understand I was so hoping that
[1:48:21] brother Lyle would talk about these
[1:48:23] different people Herod
[1:48:25] and I think there's five of them
[1:48:27] [Music]
[1:48:30] there's five of them one of them's kind
[1:48:33] of I heard but it's important to know
[1:48:36] these things
[1:48:37] important to know who who is speaking
[1:48:40] here and when he talked about James it's
[1:48:44] important to know which James that that
[1:48:47] it's talking about this was James this
[1:48:51] this was
[1:48:52] the brother of John that had been with
[1:48:55] Jesus and that had gone with him and and
[1:48:58] had seen all these great things as what
[1:49:00] Lyle said was was there I believe it was
[1:49:02] on non-transfiguration he was also there
[1:49:04] and
[1:49:06] Aaron wanted to destroy this man he
[1:49:09] wasn't the pastor in the Church of
[1:49:10] Jerusalem that was another James
[1:49:13] and and as as he's going through these
[1:49:16] scriptures I just thank God that we can
[1:49:19] we can understand these things even and
[1:49:22] he goes even talking about these
[1:49:24] different Mary's
[1:49:25] [Music]
[1:49:27] remember the last said there was at
[1:49:29] least six of them
[1:49:31] sweetheart I'm sorry I gotta embarrass
[1:49:34] you
[1:49:35] my wife is I don't know if there was
[1:49:38] ever a better wife to anybody in the
[1:49:40] world than my sweetheart back there
[1:49:43] raising the kids and
[1:49:46] homeschooling them we're doing
[1:49:48] everything that we knew how to
[1:49:50] to do
[1:49:51] and just
[1:49:53] trying to keep the world out and and
[1:49:56] it's it's so hard for a parent
[1:49:59] not knowing the best way to raise the
[1:50:02] kids and just doing the best that you
[1:50:04] know know how and Stephanie was
[1:50:07] praying one time and she
[1:50:10] she was thinking about it was Mary the
[1:50:12] mother of Jesus right sweetheart
[1:50:15] you're gonna have to nod I might mess
[1:50:17] this up yeah
[1:50:20] and she was thanking the Lord for this
[1:50:23] married the mother of Jesus and what a
[1:50:25] great example that she could be and and
[1:50:28] and Stephanie was saying Lord
[1:50:33] but how could I be like somebody that
[1:50:36] great
[1:50:39] and the Lord responded to her
[1:50:41] and he said I have many Mary's
[1:50:45] and I thank God that that
[1:50:49] I got a great one I got a good one in
[1:50:53] and to think that for the Lyle he
[1:50:55] brought that out that there's at least
[1:50:57] six of these sisters with that with that
[1:51:00] sweet name
[1:51:01] of Mary
[1:51:03] I uh
[1:51:06] I appreciate him so much brother I
[1:51:08] appreciate what you what you brought
[1:51:10] tonight it was it was well thought out
[1:51:13] it was well studied and and what a what
[1:51:17] a blessing what a blessing to know these
[1:51:19] things and to be able to to dig in this
[1:51:21] book
[1:51:22] and and to see that these things
[1:51:25] happened
[1:51:26] and then brother Lyle brings out this
[1:51:28] story that was within a couple months of
[1:51:31] the tape that I listened to this morning
[1:51:34] brother Lyle brings out this story again
[1:51:37] the book of Acts being alive in this man
[1:51:41] named William Marion Branagh
[1:51:44] and reading and and how he was so LED of
[1:51:47] the spirit I believed he preached a
[1:51:49] message called letter of the spirit and
[1:51:50] he told that story that brother Lyle was
[1:51:53] telling
[1:51:55] and
[1:51:56] to think that a man could be so LED and
[1:51:59] a woman could so LED and God just is
[1:52:03] like him he doesn't just send an angel
[1:52:05] to speak to us but he sends a brother or
[1:52:09] a sister to speak to us he loves his
[1:52:13] children working together amen let's
[1:52:15] stand
[1:52:15] [Music]
[1:52:17] but Aaron if you could come
[1:52:22] I'm uh I was just blessed that blessed
[1:52:27] by tonight I always appreciate
[1:52:29] appreciate learning something it helps
[1:52:31] me to to open up this Bible and I want
[1:52:33] to just jump right in and I think if I
[1:52:36] could jump in anywhere brother Joe I
[1:52:37] think it'd be in the book of Acts that's
[1:52:40] where I'd want to jump in and make my
