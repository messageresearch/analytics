[35:13] I've enjoyed it I say this every time
[35:15] that I open the book every time that I
[35:17] come up here to minister I have
[35:18] thoroughly enjoyed the book of Acts
[35:21] learning about
[35:22] it and it blessed me so much last
[35:26] service is brother Lyall was preaching
[35:28] and he was talking about when he closed
[35:30] he was talking about this man
[35:33] Luke and how
[35:37] Luke as I said never knew Jesus that we
[35:41] know of Luke did research and he
[35:45] interviewed people like we would do what
[35:47] was he like tell me about what he said
[35:50] and and all of this this letter that
[35:54] this Apostle Luke put
[35:57] together all the research that he did
[36:01] and he he wrote it for this man
[36:04] theopolis and he sends him this letter
[36:06] he gives him this book that he wrote the
[36:08] Book of Luke about
[36:10] Jesus and then he writes another
[36:15] letter and he says
[36:19] theopolis he says remember all that I
[36:22] wrote the first letter the first part
[36:25] that I wrote about this man
[36:28] Jesus he says there's a part two to all
[36:33] this and and Luke puts together this
[36:36] book of Acts the first part of it he
[36:39] probably wasn't present but then he
[36:41] slips pronouns in there saying that I
[36:43] was there and I was Along on this on
[36:47] this ship and I was with Paul and I was
[36:50] there when when this boy fell out of the
[36:53] Loft and landed on the street and died I
[36:56] was
[36:58] there and he writes to this theopolis
[37:01] and
[37:01] says this is what Jesus continued to do
[37:07] if you look in your Bible it probably
[37:09] says the Acts of the
[37:12] Apostles the proper word of the proper
[37:15] title of course is the acts of the holy
[37:18] spirit in the apostles and think about
[37:22] Luke and and how he must have
[37:25] felt
[37:27] when he finally met this man the Apostle
[37:31] Paul and he looked and he says all of
[37:34] that I've learned about Jesus all of
[37:36] these years that I put together this
[37:38] book and all this work that I've done I
[37:40] can see this Same Spirit of this man
[37:43] Jesus that I learned about in this man
[37:47] the Apostle Paul I think about as I said
[37:51] last time how my
[37:55] grandfather he he was they were
[37:57] listening to the radio one I believe it
[38:00] was a Saturday they were listening to
[38:02] the radio and this man was preaching way
[38:05] up it was first of all it was a miracle
[38:07] that they even heard the
[38:08] broadcast and they were listening to
[38:10] this man my grandpa he was he was
[38:14] thinking wow this is something that I've
[38:16] never heard
[38:19] before just like Luke he says this is
[38:24] exactly what I read about in the Bible
[38:27] so he went up and he heard this man
[38:31] named William
[38:33] brandom and he said here it
[38:36] is this is that same Spirit as Luke said
[38:42] this is the same that happened theopolis
[38:45] this is the second part of this so my
[38:49] grandpa he starts
[38:51] following this man around the country
[38:54] just as Luke followed the Apostle Paul
[38:58] going around as I said before before I
[39:01] was in a ship this time I was in a
[39:02] station
[39:04] wagon it was in Canada and it was in
[39:08] California and it was in Missouri and it
[39:10] was in Indiana and down to Georgia in
[39:12] his own
[39:13] house and then down into Florida and all
[39:17] over followed this man go up to a place
[39:22] called
[39:23] Philadelphia they're up there
[39:27] and
[39:29] the one that organized all the meetings
[39:32] he said
[39:35] hey I've seen you all all over the place
[39:39] everywhere we go you and your family in
[39:41] this car every everywhere everywhere we
[39:43] go you're you're there he said would you
[39:47] like to
[39:49] meet brother
[39:51] branam my grandpa said
[39:54] yeah so he said said I think I can set
[39:57] up a breakfast for you so brother
[40:01] brandom my
[40:03] grandpa sister brandham my
[40:06] grandma and Brother Joseph brandham was
[40:09] was a young
[40:10] boy
[40:12] and what had happened the week
[40:16] before was my grandfather and my uncle
[40:20] Ronnie were out
[40:21] fishing and if you know brother bram's
[40:23] message you've probably heard the story
[40:26] they were out fishing and my grandfather
[40:29] I think the lemon on bass was probably
[40:31] eight or 10 and my grandfather and my
[40:34] uncle had caught three potato sacks full
[40:40] of
[40:41] bass far more than the limit obviously
[40:45] so they took these big these big sacks
[40:47] of fish after they were finished and
[40:49] they put them in the in the back of the
[40:51] car and they're driving and the and it's
[40:54] dark and they're driving down the road
[40:56] and my grandpa sees headlights out in
[41:00] front of him and he says that's only one
[41:02] thing I can think that would be out here

[41:07] let's hide these
[41:09] fish so they stop they take the fish out
[41:11] of the car they put them in the bushes
[41:14] just in time that the headlights come up
[41:16] to them and it's what he thought it was
[41:18] the game
[41:19] W and he looked at him and he says how
[41:22] many fish do you have my grandpa and my
[41:25] uncle smelling like fish scales fish
[41:28] scales on them fishing poles oh we don't

[41:45] fish so he drives off they go back
[41:49] out pick up the sacks put them back in
[41:52] the car they go driving and they're
[41:54] driving along and they see lights over

[42:00] hide the sacks in the in the in the
[42:02] bushes they jump out right in time the

[42:25] again
[42:26] once again it happens my grandpa was a
[42:29] step ahead of the
[42:32] law he hid the fish again in the bushes
[42:37] gay Mor comes searches the car again he
[42:39] gives up they go on home the next
[42:42] weekend they're up in Philadelphia they
[42:45] get to have breakfast with this man of
[42:48] God they're sitting
[42:52] there and they're sitting across from
[42:55] each other and there on the
[42:58] wall is a painting and that painting is
[43:01] of a
[43:03] lake brother brandom looks at my
[43:06] [Music]
[43:07] grandfather and he says brother Evans he
[43:09] says uh that looks like a good place to
[43:11] fish doesn't
[43:13] it and grandpa said yes
[43:16] sir it does and he said he said brother
[43:20] Evans he said I saw a
[43:23] man he said he said do you like the fish
[43:26] my grandpa saides sir I do he said 'I
[43:29] saw a
[43:30] man and he said this man broke the
[43:35] law my grandpa said yes
[43:40] sir he said he caught far too many fish
[43:45] and he had these three sacks of fish and
[43:48] he said he had them in his
[43:50] car yes
[43:54] sir and
[43:56] he saw the game warden coming and he
[43:59] took those sacks of fish and he hit them
[44:01] in the bushes just before the game
[44:02] warden
[44:04] came yes
[44:06] sir and he said he did that three
[44:12] times he said he was breaking the law my
[44:16] grandpa
[44:17] said brother brand I'm guilty I did it
[44:21] I'm I'm guilty he said will you forgive
[44:23] me brother Bram said I'll forgive you if
[44:27] you take me down to that place
[44:30] fishing so then they became very close
[44:33] friends so they went down to this place
[44:37] in
[44:39] Florida and they went fishing and they
[44:42] were catching these these big beautiful
[44:46] bass
[44:48] and my grandfather they were fishing
[44:51] with these long poles these long cane
[44:53] poles and they have a popper on the end
[44:55] and they throw it out doesn't even have
[44:57] a reel on it they throw it out a and
[45:00] then they they pop it like this and then
[45:02] the bass comes and grabs it and then
[45:04] they pull them in but there's no real
[45:06] they just pull the line in and the and
[45:08] the rod is so long that they can get the
[45:11] fish so he's brother brandom's
[45:15] fishing and he gets this big bass
[45:19] on
[45:22] and it's it gets hung up in the weeds
[45:25] and it's a it's it was a fish that he
[45:27] had been trying to there was a big one
[45:28] in this little area it a swampy area
[45:31] there was this big fish in there brother
[45:32] Brandon would get him on and he'd get
[45:33] off so he he gets this fish on and it's
[45:36] a big one but it's not that same fish
[45:38] and he gets hung up in the weeds and my
[45:40] grandfather says brother brandom I'll
[45:41] come down to help you and he goes going
[45:45] down to the water and he steps and just
[45:47] before he gets to the water he steps in
[45:49] a rattlesnake bites him on the top of
[45:52] the foot didn't see it right on the edge
[45:55] of the water my grandfather jumps
[45:58] back and he's barefooted which I think
[46:01] my grandfather lived 90% of his life
[46:03] barefooted and he he looks down it
[46:06] starts to
[46:07] swell this would be important later on
[46:10] it starts to swell and it starts to hurt
[46:13] my grandpa sits down on the
[46:17] bank and his foot he said and I remember
[46:21] him saying this he said it was throbbing
[46:24] and swelling
[46:26] and he said it hurt so bad that the
[46:28] tears were coming from his
[46:31] eyes and the the man that was with
[46:35] them he goes over to brother brandom and
[46:38] my grandfather's watching
[46:40] him he goes over to brother Branham and
[46:43] he says brother brandham brother Evans
[46:45] was bitten by a
[46:48] snake and brother brandham just keeps
[46:50] fishing does even acknowledge that he
[46:52] said it he just keeps fishing and
[46:56] after a while my grandfather's looking
[46:58] at
[46:59] him
[47:00] and brother brandom takes his fishing
[47:04] pole and he sets it down and he walks
[47:08] over to my grandfather who's sitting on
[47:10] the bank and he says these words he says
[47:13] where did he get you brother Evans my
[47:15] grandfather shows him the two bite marks
[47:19] on the top of his foot and the swelling
[47:21] the swelling
[47:22] leg they're way back in there it was
[47:25] this was a pretty dangerous
[47:29] situation because they're so far and if
[47:32] if you know about snake bites when you
[47:34] start to exercise to get back it starts
[47:37] to spread the venom through the body and
[47:40] can cause more and more damage so
[47:43] brother brandom walks up to him and he
[47:46] he says where did he get you brother
[47:47] Evans and my grandfather shows
[47:49] him and he lays his hand on my
[47:53] grandpa and he said Lord Lord it is
[47:56] written in your word listen to my words
[48:00] Lord it is written in your word that
[48:02] they shall tread on serpents and
[48:06] scorpions and nothing by any means will
[48:08] harm them my grandpa as he's he he's
[48:13] sitting there and brother Brandon's
[48:15] praying for him the pain completely left
[48:19] at the moment that the prophet started
[48:24] praying he gets
[48:26] up he
[48:29] goes he says no pain at all brother
[48:31] brandom brother Bram says well do you
[48:34] want to go back you want to go back home
[48:35] or do you want to stay fishing he said
[48:37] brother B we came here to fish I'm
[48:40] fine
[48:42] so they continued to fish all day they
[48:46] came my grandfather owned a gas
[48:48] station they went to the gas station my
[48:51] dad was there they get back and of
[48:54] course everybody's greeting brother
[48:55] brother bandam and everything and and my
[48:57] my grandpa tells my dad he says listen
[48:59] to this he says I was bitten by a snake
[49:02] and he still didn't have a shoes on
[49:03] sister Shirley so he's he's he says look
[49:06] at this and there were two holes in the
[49:07] top of his foot and my Grandpa took took
[49:10] his two fingers his two thumbs together
[49:12] and pressed the two holes together and
[49:14] dad said a little bit of blood popped
[49:16] out he says oh bitten by a rattlesnake
[49:18] right there it swelling everything
[49:20] brother Brandon laid his hands on me
[49:21] said they shall tread on serpents and
[49:22] scorpion and it just all went away and
[49:24] he says I'm fine in my my dad's uncle
[49:26] was standing right there he says Welch
[49:29] and he was still crippled from a snake
[49:32] bite that he had had months
[49:35] earlier and he said wel he said it's
[49:39] okay to be religious but it's not okay
[49:40] to be stupid you need to go to the
[49:43] hospital my grandpa said if God can take
[49:45] me if he could heal me then he can take
[49:48] me all the way
[49:50] through it
[49:54] happened a chapter
[49:59] 28
[50:01] Paul and the crew of the doomed ship are
[50:05] now ship dreck as brother Lyall told us
[50:10] before made their way to
[50:15] land and when we are escaped when we
[50:18] who's talking here Luke I was there I
[50:24] saw it
[50:27] and when they were escaped they knew
[50:30] that the island was called Malta and the
[50:34] barbar's PE people showed us no little
[50:37] kindness for they kindled a fire and
[50:40] received every one of us because of the
[50:42] present rain and because of the cold and
[50:44] when Paul had gathered a bundle of
[50:46] sticks and laid them on the fire there
[50:49] came a viper out of the Heat and
[50:51] fastened on his
[50:54] hand and when The Barbarians saw the
[50:56] venomous Beast hang on his hand they
[50:59] said among themselves no doubt this man
[51:01] is a murderer whom though he hath
[51:04] escaped the sea yet Vengeance suffereth
[51:08] not to
[51:09] live and he shook off the Beast Into the
[51:12] Fire and felt no
[51:15] harm how be it they looked when he
[51:19] should have
[51:22] swollen or fallen down dead suddenly
[51:27] but after they had looked a great while
[51:31] and saw no harm come to him they changed
[51:34] their minds and said that he was a
[51:39] God so these people saw the power of God
[51:44] in this
[51:45] man maybe they didn't know better they
[51:48] hadn't they hadn't been taught
[51:49] differently there wasn't a Christian
[51:51] Pastor there maybe to tell them that
[51:53] it's not right to worship this man
[51:57] so
[51:58] friends sometimes if people see the
[52:01] power of God or they have seen the power
[52:04] of God and they make a
[52:06] mistake and put this man in a place that
[52:09] maybe God didn't Place him we should
[52:12] have patience on those people
[52:17] too so we see that
[52:21] this Paul was bitten by this
[52:26] snake and he shakes it off into the fire
[52:31] and let me read to you another
[52:34] account from I've given you a testimony
[52:36] and now I've I've read a testimony I
[52:39] want to read to you now the words of our
[52:42] Lord Jesus let's turn to Luke chapter 10
[52:46] brother I'm sorry I didn't give you
[52:48] these
[52:54] scriptures
[52:58] Luke chapter
[53:05] 10 verse
[53:13] 17 and the 70 returned again with Joy
[53:17] saying Lord even the devils are subject
[53:19] unto us through thy
[53:21] name and he said unto them I beheld
[53:24] Satan is lightning falling from Heaven
[53:27] fall from Heaven behold I give unto you
[53:30] power to tread on serpents and scorpions
[53:35] and over all the power of the enemy and
[53:37] nothing shall by any means hurt you let
[53:41] me tell you this book of Acts has not
[53:44] ended as we can as we can see from from
[53:47] these testimonies let's also turn to
[53:49] Mark chap 16 very famous and familiar
[53:52] verse to all of us I can quote it by
[53:55] heart but I I'd better read it Mark
[53:57] chapter
[54:02] 16 verse
[54:05] 15 Jesus says go ye into all the
[54:09] world and preach the gospel to Every
[54:13] Creature he that believeth and is
[54:15] baptized shall be saved but he that
[54:17] believeth not shall be damned and these
[54:19] signs shall follow them that
[54:22] believe in my name they shall cast out
[54:25] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[54:28] they shall take up
[54:31] serpents and if they drink any deadly
[54:33] thing it shall not hurt them they shall
[54:35] lay hands on the
[54:36] sick and they shall
[54:39] recover what an
[54:42] amazing what an
[54:44] amazing thing that the the Lord Jesus
[54:47] prophesied right there and we see it
[54:50] right here and Paul picking up these
[54:53] sticks there was a snake in in the stick
[54:55] and bit
[54:56] him I wonder if Paul maybe knew what the
[55:00] Lord Jesus had said he shakes it off
[55:02] into the fire he says I am about my
[55:04] father's business I am preaching the
[55:06] gospel I am in the perfect will of God
[55:09] Satan you have no part with me you can't
[55:12] harm me you can't do anything I am
[55:14] commissioned by God to preach this
[55:17] gospel and he throws a snake in the
[55:24] fire
[55:26] verse number seven the book of Acts
[55:28] chapter
[55:32] 28 in the same quarters were possessions
[55:34] of the chief men Chief man on the island
[55:37] whose name was pus who received us and
[55:41] lodged us three days courteously now
[55:45] remember the Roman Empire was ruling the
[55:47] world at that time including this island
[55:51] where they were stranded on pus was most
[55:55] likely the Roman governor of this area
[55:58] or of this
[56:00] island and it came to
[56:02] pass that the father of pu of pus lay
[56:06] sick of a fever and of a bloody flux to
[56:10] whom Paul entered in and prayed and laid
[56:13] his hands on him Mark
[56:16] 16 and laid his hands on him and healed
[56:21] him so when this was done others also
[56:24] would which had diseases in the island
[56:26] came and were
[56:28] healed friends this is another
[56:32] example and they're all over this is
[56:34] another example of how important Divine
[56:38] Healing is to the gospel how important
[56:42] Miracles are to the gospel we should
[56:45] have faith not only for our own healing
[56:49] but that also these people who aren't
[56:52] Believers like these these people on
[56:53] Malta were obviously not
[56:56] Believers but so they also can be healed
[57:00] and that they can receive the Gospel a
[57:03] gospel that's not dead but a gospel that
[57:06] is
[57:07] alive and here Paul is constantly
[57:10] showing that Jesus Christ is alive in me
[57:15] and I am carrying
[57:22] on I'll read verse n again so when this
[57:25] was done others also which had disease
[57:28] in the island diseases in the island
[57:30] came and were healed who also honored us
[57:34] with many honors and when we departed
[57:37] they lated us with such things as were
[57:40] necessary so these people thought the
[57:43] world of Paul gave him great honors and
[57:45] even even so that all of these I I
[57:48] remember how many it was a couple
[57:50] hundred
[57:51] people that they even gave them all
[57:54] supplies for their Journey kind people
[57:57] on this
[57:58] island and they certainly benefited from
[58:01] the Apostle and his team being
[58:05] there and after three months we departed
[58:09] in a ship of
[58:10] Alexandria which had wintered in the
[58:12] aisle whose sign was casor and Pollock
[58:15] that that word sign I love the detail of
[58:18] Luke it's it's really neat to me because
[58:22] if you're reading this book of Acts
[58:25] when Paul is speaking in first person he
[58:27] says us you'll notice the details get
[58:30] really tight even so much as he said
[58:33] that the sign basically these are
[58:36] probably
[58:37] Gods because these are Romans or these
[58:39] are these are in the Roman Empire these
[58:43] are probably gods that they thought
[58:45] would protect the ship and they're the
[58:47] sign that's in the front of the ship
[58:49] this caster and
[58:51] Pollock and landing at Syracuse we t
[58:54] there 3 days and from then we fetched a
[58:58] compass and came to regim and after one
[59:01] day the south wind blew and we came the
[59:04] next day to
[59:07] tioli where we found Brethren and were
[59:10] desired to T with them seven days and so
[59:13] we went toward
[59:15] Rome and from then that's a big stop
[59:19] right there and we went to
[59:22] Rome Paul knew that his destination was
[59:25] going to be Rome I don't know if he knew
[59:26] what was going to happen in Rome but he
[59:29] knew that the Lord had told him to go
[59:31] and that he would be witness in
[59:35] Rome and from then when the Brethren
[59:38] heard of us they came to meus as far as
[59:42] ai ai Forum the three taverns whom when
[59:46] Paul saw he thanked God and took courage
[59:49] most translations say the three
[59:52] ends and when we came came to Rome the
[59:56] Centurion delivered the prisoners to the
[59:59] captain of the Guard but Paul was
[1:00:01] suffered to dwell by himself with a
[1:00:03] soldier that kept
[1:00:05] him now this is this is a very
[1:00:08] interesting thing that happens right
[1:00:10] here that
[1:00:11] Paul was to dwell with a soldier and
[1:00:15] this Soldier basically was in charge of
[1:00:17] Paul now probably wasn't just one
[1:00:19] soldier it was probably soldiers that
[1:00:21] were working a shift and they worked
[1:00:24] some so many hours and then they went to
[1:00:26] the next Soldier and they stayed with
[1:00:28] Paul 24 hours a day most likely because
[1:00:32] Paul was this prisoner this pretty
[1:00:36] high-profile prisoner they were most
[1:00:38] likely whoever it was was most likely
[1:00:40] chained to
[1:00:42] Paul so they were locked together
[1:00:45] whoever this guard was and
[1:00:48] Paul and it came to pass that after
[1:00:51] three days Paul called the chief of the
[1:00:54] Jews to together and when they were come
[1:00:56] together he said unto them men and
[1:00:59] Brethren though I have committed nothing
[1:01:02] against the people or customs of your of
[1:01:04] our
[1:01:05] fathers yet I was delivered prisoner
[1:01:09] from Jerusalem into the hands of the
[1:01:11] Romans now remember he's speaking to the
[1:01:14] Jews
[1:01:16] here who when they had examined me would
[1:01:19] have let me go because there was no
[1:01:21] cause of death in me but when the Jews
[1:01:25] spake against it I was constrained to
[1:01:28] appeal unto Caesar not that I had ought
[1:01:32] to accuse my nation of this are very
[1:01:36] interesting I talked with brother Lyle
[1:01:38] about this before and as I've read the
[1:01:42] commentaries on the book of Acts no one
[1:01:45] that I have
[1:01:46] found has
[1:01:48] said what I
[1:01:50] think really happened
[1:01:53] here and if you you look at Paul he had
[1:01:55] the spirit of Christ which was to give
[1:01:58] his life for his Brethren as I said this
[1:02:00] morning Jesus and the
[1:02:03] Jews is considered his Brethren his
[1:02:09] house now the Jews if you remember with
[1:02:12] Felix and fesus and agria a couple
[1:02:16] couple um chapters
[1:02:19] ago that
[1:02:21] Paul
[1:02:23] was Paul had something that none of the
[1:02:26] others most of the others Jews didn't
[1:02:28] have and maybe those that were on trial
[1:02:30] didn't have he had as uh as it could be
[1:02:35] said well I won't I'll say it sometimes
[1:02:39] Paul had an
[1:02:41] ace that no one really knew about do you
[1:02:45] remember what it
[1:02:46] was he was a Roman
[1:02:49] citizen Paul's dad had paid to become a
[1:02:53] Roman Paul was born after his dad had
[1:02:57] paid that great price so now Paul was
[1:03:00] entitled to every right that a Roman
[1:03:03] citizen had it would be like an
[1:03:05] immigrant coming to the United
[1:03:09] States and going through the immigration
[1:03:11] process and having a child that child is
[1:03:15] a born United States
[1:03:17] citizen and that's what Paul was so when
[1:03:20] Paul came before this trial Paul had had
[1:03:24] certain rights that the Jews didn't have
[1:03:26] and one of those rights was to face his
[1:03:30] accusers and if those accusers would
[1:03:33] accuse
[1:03:34] Paul and they couldn't back up their
[1:03:36] story or they didn't show up then Paul
[1:03:39] was set free but the law went after his
[1:03:45] accusers so here's
[1:03:47] Paul and he makes the
[1:03:51] statement and I say could it be
[1:03:55] he saysi was constrained to appeal to
[1:03:57] Caesar which was his right to go to the
[1:04:00] courts in Rome the Roman courts I was
[1:04:04] constrained to appeal to Caesar not that
[1:04:07] I had ought to accuse my nation of so if
[1:04:12] Paul if he would have not appealed to
[1:04:16] Caesar then
[1:04:18] fesus or Felix whichever one the ruler
[1:04:22] was at that time would have said okay by
[1:04:26] Roman law he's a Roman now we need to go
[1:04:28] after the accusers I wonder if Paul was
[1:04:31] a protecting those that accused him and
[1:04:36] lied about
[1:04:43] him so he says
[1:04:46] this so he appeals to Caesar at that
[1:04:52] time and when you appeal to
[1:04:57] Caesar
[1:04:59] fesus it's like well now it's out of my
[1:05:02] hands which was probably a big burden
[1:05:03] off of Festus
[1:05:05] Agrippa the king of the Jews he's like
[1:05:08] well I'm I'm pretty much done too so now
[1:05:11] it's like all right we don't have to
[1:05:12] worry about Paul anymore now Paul's not
[1:05:14] a problem in Jerusalem
[1:05:16] either remember all the Uproar that was
[1:05:18] going
[1:05:19] on they wanted to kill Paul and they
[1:05:22] hated him and they they they said all
[1:05:24] these wrong things like he brought a
[1:05:25] gentile into the temple and defamed or
[1:05:29] defiled the temple which he didn't
[1:05:31] do but they accused him of it and it
[1:05:34] caused this big uproar and all the
[1:05:36] gossip went around you know how how was
[1:05:38] what if you've been on if you've been
[1:05:40] following the book of Acts how all of
[1:05:42] this happened and all of a sudden here
[1:05:43] come the Roman Centurion and and the
[1:05:46] Roman guard and they grab Paul and they
[1:05:47] protect him and they bring him before
[1:05:49] the law the Roman
[1:05:51] law and Paul divulges I'm a Roman
[1:05:57] citizen then he appeals to Caesar being
[1:06:00] as innocent as he
[1:06:02] was verse number
[1:06:05] 20 for this cause therefore I have
[1:06:08] called for you to see you and to speak
[1:06:12] with you because that for the hope of
[1:06:14] Israel I am bound with this chain he's
[1:06:16] talking to the Jews he's witnessing to
[1:06:19] the Jews for the hope of Israel what is
[1:06:21] he talking about for the hope of Israel
[1:06:24] what did I say this
[1:06:25] morning that all
[1:06:27] through the Old Testament they were
[1:06:30] speaking of this man the
[1:06:33] Messiah prophecy after prophecy after
[1:06:36] prophecy I Isaiah said that this man
[1:06:38] would be born of a virgin Micah said
[1:06:41] that he would be born in Bethlehem David
[1:06:43] said in the Psalms that he would be a
[1:06:45] high priest after the order of
[1:06:47] melkisedek Zechariah said he would be
[1:06:49] called
[1:06:51] King David said in the Psalms that
[1:06:53] Messiah would be betrayed David also
[1:06:56] said in the Psalms that he would be
[1:06:57] falsely accused Isaiah said he would be
[1:07:00] spit on and
[1:07:02] beaten David in the psalm said he would
[1:07:04] be hated Without a
[1:07:06] Cause Isaiah said that he would be
[1:07:08] crucified with criminals David said in
[1:07:11] the Psalms that his hands and his feet
[1:07:12] would be pierced David said he would be
[1:07:14] forsaken by
[1:07:16] God David said in the Psalms that he
[1:07:19] would be buried with the rich and that
[1:07:21] he would raised from the
[1:07:22] dead David said in the Psalms that the
[1:07:25] Messiah would Ascend up to heaven and
[1:07:27] that he would be seated on the right
[1:07:29] hand of
[1:07:30] God that was the hope of Israel that
[1:07:35] Paul is talking about this man that had
[1:07:39] been prophesied so much had come and you
[1:07:41] missed
[1:07:42] him you missed the Hope
[1:07:47] Israel and they said unto
[1:07:50] him we neither received Letters Out of
[1:07:52] Judea concerning thee neither any of the
[1:07:54] Brethren that came showed or spake any
[1:07:57] harm of thee basically we don't know we
[1:07:59] don't think any evil of you we don't
[1:08:00] really really know anything about you
[1:08:04] but we desire to hear of thee what thou
[1:08:07] thinkest for as concerning this
[1:08:11] sect we know that everywhere it is
[1:08:14] spoken
[1:08:18] against
[1:08:20] so they know they they've heard that
[1:08:24] this group of the
[1:08:28] nazarenes all evil is spoken of it all
[1:08:32] that we've heard about this group has
[1:08:35] been that they're false he's a false
[1:08:38] prophet comparing him to the to the one
[1:08:41] that brought all of these people out
[1:08:42] into the desert and they all got killed
[1:08:45] out there they all died out there
[1:08:46] comparing him his mother had an affair
[1:08:50] with with a Roman soldier and he's an
[1:08:52] illegitimate child and all of these bad
[1:08:56] things we've heard all of these bad
[1:08:59] things about this
[1:09:02] sect of Judaism that you're
[1:09:05] from I
[1:09:07] was one time when I was in the ministry
[1:09:11] in Jeffersonville I got a phone call and
[1:09:14] he was this man he was an Anglican
[1:09:17] priest a congregation and and he he
[1:09:21] tells me he
[1:09:22] says
[1:09:24] um he was obviously a scholar and he
[1:09:28] said I found this man named William
[1:09:32] brandom on this website called believe
[1:09:34] the
[1:09:36] sign and he said I found it on this
[1:09:38] other
[1:09:39] website and he says as I was reading he
[1:09:43] says I didn't know how anyone could be
[1:09:46] as evil as they are portraying this man
[1:09:48] William brandham to
[1:09:51] be he said he said I I I I don't
[1:09:55] understand how anyone could have been
[1:09:56] that
[1:09:56] bad and he said so in reading all of
[1:10:00] this stuff that I found on the internet
[1:10:02] I knew that this man there must be
[1:10:05] something right about this man or why
[1:10:08] would so many people speak so evil about
[1:10:13] him and this man's name is
[1:10:15] David we had some great
[1:10:19] conversations um obviously I lost touch
[1:10:22] with them but uh he really
[1:10:25] believed started listening to brother
[1:10:27] brandom he he um would call me and say
[1:10:31] oh I heard him say this and this was
[1:10:33] this was just wonderful and this is and
[1:10:35] he had all had his Bibles all out and
[1:10:37] everything and he said now this is this
[1:10:39] place in the Bible and the the um the
[1:10:42] intellectual um angle that he always
[1:10:45] had was uh was just was just tremendous
[1:10:48] but the same thing is happening here in
[1:10:50] these Jews he's like they're like hey
[1:10:51] we've heard really really bad things
[1:10:53] about this so what's the
[1:10:57] deal and when they appointed him when
[1:10:59] they had appointed him a
[1:11:01] day there came many to him into his
[1:11:04] lodging this is where Paul was in prison
[1:11:06] but he was imprisoned in a house with
[1:11:08] this Roman soldier chained to him to
[1:11:12] whom he expounded and testified the
[1:11:14] kingdom of God persuading them
[1:11:16] concerning Jesus both out of the law of
[1:11:18] Moses and out of the prophets from
[1:11:21] morning till evening notice what Paul
[1:11:24] was preaching very plainly says right
[1:11:26] here what Paul was
[1:11:29] preaching he wasn't preaching
[1:11:33] himself he wasn't preaching Moses he
[1:11:36] wasn't
[1:11:38] preaching any of the prophets he was
[1:11:41] taking the prophet's
[1:11:44] messages and introducing Christ through
[1:11:48] the prophet's
[1:11:52] messages we should should be doing the
[1:11:54] same
[1:11:57] thing and some believed the things which
[1:12:01] were
[1:12:03] spoken and some believe
[1:12:07] not
[1:12:09] and I I I think about remember verse
[1:12:13] 16 when he had that wrong that
[1:12:16] soldier that was with him that was
[1:12:18] chained to
[1:12:19] him you think that that Paul has has
[1:12:22] these people coming and and some of them
[1:12:25] will believe what he said that that he
[1:12:27] introduces the Messiah to them and he he
[1:12:30] tells them he says here it is in Moses
[1:12:33] here it is in all of the prophets have
[1:12:35] spoken this from Micah to Isaiah to
[1:12:38] Moses all the way from Genesis all the
[1:12:41] way to the current time and he's showing
[1:12:44] them these things and some were like wow
[1:12:48] this is incredible this is the truly the
[1:12:52] Messiah and others were like I don't
[1:12:53] believe
[1:12:55] it Paul was the master
[1:12:59] teacher so when we witness to people and
[1:13:03] we should be all the time remember I
[1:13:06] said this morning the alarm went
[1:13:08] off so get them in get these people in
[1:13:13] do anything that you can to get them to
[1:13:16] Christ and here was Paul with the same
[1:13:18] urgency he knew that his end was coming
[1:13:21] introducing people to the Lord Jesus
[1:13:23] doing Miracles and and preaching to them
[1:13:25] all day every day
[1:13:29] amazing some
[1:13:31] believed and some didn't and it is so
[1:13:37] frustrating
[1:13:39] Paul it it obviously upsets him as what
[1:13:42] you're going to
[1:13:45] hear and it it was amazing to me as I
[1:13:48] was reading this that even the greatest
[1:13:50] teacher maybe ever that has ever walked
[1:13:53] the Earth this man
[1:13:55] Paul there were still so many who didn't
[1:13:59] believe
[1:14:02] it and when they agreed not among
[1:14:05] themselves they
[1:14:07] departed and after that Paul had spoken
[1:14:10] one
[1:14:11] word well spake the Holy Ghost by isaas
[1:14:16] the prophet the word asaas is Isaiah the
[1:14:18] prophet unto our fathers and he's going
[1:14:19] to quote some scripture here he was
[1:14:24] frustrated he was upset how can you not
[1:14:29] believe
[1:14:31] this have I not showed you in all the
[1:14:35] scriptures with your
[1:14:37] intellectual pompous attitude to your
[1:14:39] Pharisee way you want me to show you in
[1:14:42] the scriptures I'll show you in the
[1:14:43] scriptures you won't believe it you want
[1:14:45] me to show you in real life you want me
[1:14:47] to show you the Miracles you want me to
[1:14:48] do these things I do it and you still
[1:14:50] don't
[1:14:52] believe here's the Apostle Paul and I
[1:14:54] think of this
[1:14:57] Roman looking at him like
[1:15:02] wow I wonder how many Romans well we
[1:15:05] know many of them came to the Lord you
[1:15:08] know what we do know there's a
[1:15:12] uh there's a scripture that I want to
[1:15:15] read but let's keep
[1:15:17] going Paul is
[1:15:19] upset these these Jews are like well you
[1:15:22] know well some of us will agree with you
[1:15:26] some of them say well I'll hear more
[1:15:28] about this did they really were they
[1:15:30] really sincere did they really want to
[1:15:32] know the truth well spake the Holy Ghost
[1:15:35] by Isaiah the prophet unto our fathers
[1:15:38] saying go unto this people and saying
[1:15:40] hearing you shall hear and shall not
[1:15:44] understand and seeing you shall see and
[1:15:48] not
[1:15:49] perceive for the heart of this people is
[1:15:52] waxed gross and their ears are dull of
[1:15:54] hearing and their eyes have have they
[1:15:57] closed lest they should see with their
[1:15:59] eyes I'm not going to look at it I'm not
[1:16:03] going to listen to it I just want my
[1:16:07] religion don't don't say anything to me
[1:16:10] I don't want to hear anything I I could
[1:16:11] be led
[1:16:16] astray they Clos their ears they Clos
[1:16:18] Their
[1:16:21] Eyes For The Heart of the people has
[1:16:23] waxed gross and their ears are dull of
[1:16:25] hearing and their eyes have they closed
[1:16:27] they closed them themselves lest they
[1:16:30] should see with their eyes and hear with
[1:16:31] their ears and understand with their
[1:16:33] heart and should be converted and I
[1:16:35] should heal them quoting Isaiah the
[1:16:39] prophet be it known therefore unto
[1:16:43] you that salvation of God is sent unto
[1:16:48] the Gentiles and that they will hear it
[1:16:53] these were Paul's
[1:16:55] people these were the ones that that he
[1:16:58] loved one more chance it was always one
[1:17:01] more chance and he kept preaching to
[1:17:03] them he kept going into their synagogues
[1:17:05] just listen just believe me and they
[1:17:07] kept hating him and hating him and
[1:17:09] finally he said you know what be it
[1:17:12] known unto you that the salvation of God
[1:17:15] is sent unto the
[1:17:17] Gentiles these people that you think are
[1:17:19] less than
[1:17:20] you these people that you say are
[1:17:23] heathens and not even worthy to take a
[1:17:28] breath remember when Paul let's see who
[1:17:32] was it when
[1:17:33] they they would uh oh yeah it was Paul
[1:17:36] when when Paul said he was talking he he
[1:17:39] shook His
[1:17:42] Garment and he said let let I forgot
[1:17:45] what it was but when the Jews would
[1:17:47] leave a gentile country or Gentile area
[1:17:52] they would stop once they got across the
[1:17:54] line and they would dust everything off
[1:17:57] because of the stinking rotten low down
[1:18:00] Gentile
[1:18:02] dust and that was their attitude towards
[1:18:05] the Gentiles and here is Paul
[1:18:08] saying you know what it's going to the
[1:18:11] Gentiles because they'll they'll receive
[1:18:16] it sometimes I feel the same way I feel
[1:18:20] like come on
[1:18:25] Believe get off of
[1:18:28] yourself listen to this
[1:18:32] gospel give your heart to the Lord
[1:18:35] Jesus and quit with your doctrines and
[1:18:38] everything else that separates people
[1:18:40] stop it and just come to
[1:18:47] Christ be it known therefore unto you
[1:18:50] that salvation of God is sent unto the
[1:18:52] gentille
[1:18:53] and they will hear it and when he had
[1:18:55] said these words the Jews departed and
[1:18:58] had great reasoning among themselves I
[1:19:00] bet they
[1:19:03] did but they still wouldn't give up
[1:19:05] their own doctrines and traditions and
[1:19:07] Paul dwelt two whole years in his own
[1:19:09] hired house and received all that came
[1:19:12] unto him remember Paul was guarded
[1:19:18] 247 and as Paul was in this house as he
[1:19:23] was in basically house
[1:19:25] arrest
[1:19:27] Paul had the
[1:19:28] opportunity to do something that we
[1:19:32] might not think would be a big deal
[1:19:34] today but it is Paul was able to write
[1:19:40] letters while he was there in
[1:19:43] prison now we think everybody wants to
[1:19:46] get in the not everybody but some people
[1:19:48] want to get into the pull pit and they
[1:19:51] want to preach and you reach I don't
[1:19:54] know what we have 50 people here tonight
[1:19:56] you reach 50
[1:19:57] people and that's what happened was Paul
[1:19:59] Paul people were coming in and and Paul
[1:20:02] was reaching them but his ministry was
[1:20:06] so much greater with these letters that
[1:20:09] he wrote so much so that we can read
[1:20:12] them today the same
[1:20:15] letters
[1:20:19] Philippians Paul says in Philippians 1
[1:20:21] Paul says that he's writing from Rome
[1:20:24] and he says these things that have
[1:20:25] happened to me have actually happened
[1:20:26] for the furtherance of the
[1:20:28] Gospel so it's become evident to the
[1:20:31] whole Palace guard it's become evident
[1:20:34] to all of these Romans The Men Who were
[1:20:37] guarding him every day that even they
[1:20:40] were hearing the gospel of Paul the
[1:20:43] Roman guard there
[1:20:45] chained to
[1:20:48] Paul listening to this man I would have
[1:20:52] loved
[1:20:54] would you not have loved to hear
[1:20:57] him chain to him I wonder how many of
[1:21:00] these guards that Paul led to the Lord
[1:21:04] I'll tell you I know for sure there were
[1:21:07] some because of this scripture I'm going
[1:21:09] to read Philippians chapter
[1:21:16] 4 yeah right here so Philippians is is a
[1:21:20] letter that Paul wrote from this house
[1:21:22] arrest from Rome verse
[1:21:26] 21 he says this brother I'm sorry I
[1:21:29] didn't give you any of these scriptures
[1:21:31] I just they're they're uh oh they're in
[1:21:35] the Bible here we go
[1:21:37] so Paul in closing his letter to the
[1:21:39] Philippians he says this salute every
[1:21:43] saint in Christ Jesus the Brethren which
[1:21:45] are with me greet you all the saints
[1:21:48] Salute You chiefly they that that are of
[1:21:53] Caesar's
[1:21:55] household brother Lyall that's those
[1:21:57] Roman
[1:21:59] guards and it says the
[1:22:02] Saints Salute You chiefly these Roman
[1:22:07] guards that have been with me this whole
[1:22:08] time they've given their heart to the
[1:22:10] Lord Jesus
[1:22:13] also for two years Paul preached from
[1:22:16] this
[1:22:18] house and he showed that we don't have
[1:22:21] to have a Pulpit to preach
[1:22:24] we don't have to have a church to preach
[1:22:26] at we can preach to each other we can
[1:22:29] preach to the Lost we can preach to the
[1:22:31] Sinners whoever comes by you can we can
[1:22:33] be like Paul when he didn't have a
[1:22:35] church he wasn't preaching in a
[1:22:37] synagogue here yet this is the most
[1:22:38] successful time of his whole Ministry in
[1:22:42] Rome and Paul is preaching to one by one
[1:22:46] they come in his little house maybe two
[1:22:48] by two three or four they come into his
[1:22:51] little house and and he preaches the
[1:22:54] Lord Jesus through all of the
[1:22:59] prophets back to Acts chapter
[1:23:04] 28 I'll read 30 again and Paul dwelt two
[1:23:08] old years in his own hired house and
[1:23:11] received all that came unto him
[1:23:13] preaching the kingdom of God and
[1:23:15] teaching those things which concern the
[1:23:17] Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence no
[1:23:21] man forbidding him
[1:23:24] and that's the last
[1:23:28] verse Paul I mean we have Luke here the
[1:23:31] author highly Highly
[1:23:34] Educated very very very good
[1:23:39] writer and that's
[1:23:44] it every try to find a book in the in
[1:23:48] the in the New Testament try to find one
[1:23:50] that doesn't end with amen he doesn't
[1:23:53] even put
[1:23:54] amen here he says preaching the kingdom
[1:23:57] of God and teaching those things which
[1:23:59] concern the Lord Jesus Christ with all
[1:24:01] confidence no man forbidding
[1:24:03] him where's the next
[1:24:09] verse it's because the book of Acts
[1:24:11] never
[1:24:13] ended it's going on
[1:24:16] today 2,000
[1:24:19] [Applause]
[1:24:20] years I'm going to clap
[1:24:27] it didn't
[1:24:28] end as I said this Apostle Luke this man
[1:24:32] this great man that followed Paul around
[1:24:35] how wonderful he was and and you just
[1:24:38] read both his first letter and his
[1:24:41] second and how inspiring and how
[1:24:43] beautiful they are and
[1:24:45] he on purpose doesn't even say Amen
[1:24:50] again tonight when you get home go
[1:24:53] through the New Testament find a book
[1:24:54] that doesn't end in amen I think there's
[1:24:57] one other one maybe
[1:24:58] two but he doesn't he doesn't say amen
[1:25:02] he just says and he continued teaching
[1:25:05] so what happened
[1:25:07] was Paul taught for a couple years in
[1:25:11] this house and and there's different
[1:25:13] accounts we don't know for sure what
[1:25:16] happened
[1:25:18] but he may have been let go and brought
[1:25:22] back to prison we don't know we don't
[1:25:24] know exactly what was going on in these
[1:25:27] in these couple years but we do
[1:25:32] know that Paul's life did come to an
[1:25:36] end and his ministry well his ministry
[1:25:39] never came to an end because of these
[1:25:42] Epistles that we have the last thing
[1:25:46] that Paul wrote let's turn to the end
[1:25:50] the last chapter of second Timothy
[1:25:52] second Timothy
[1:25:54] 4 here we have a while
[1:25:58] later Paul back in
[1:26:02] Rome probably never
[1:26:04] left maybe left we don't know but he is
[1:26:08] definitely in Rome
[1:26:12] here and he's
[1:26:14] writing his closing
[1:26:17] statements his last
[1:26:19] words to me the greatest of them all of
[1:26:23] all the Apostles of all the prophets of
[1:26:26] all of them besides our lord Jesus was
[1:26:29] this man Paul and here he
[1:26:32] is in his last
[1:26:35] words to this man Timothy who he was
[1:26:39] trying to
[1:26:43] encourage and these words to the Gentile
[1:26:46] church this second
[1:26:48] Timothy was written in Greek it was
[1:26:51] written written so the Gentiles could
[1:26:54] read
[1:26:55] it chapter 4 I'll read the whole
[1:27:00] chapter Paul says this speaking to
[1:27:06] Timothy he says I charge thee before God
[1:27:11] and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall
[1:27:13] judge the quick and the dead at his
[1:27:16] appearing in his
[1:27:18] kingdom preach the

[1:27:50] they Heap to themselves teachers having
[1:27:52] itching
[1:27:53] ears and they shall turn away their ears
