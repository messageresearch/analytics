the right person to marry you God bless you it's 25 years ago that um my uh I was able to to marry the love of my life and I was thinking about that yesterday morning we we have a 25 year anniversary coming up and uh I got up early in the morning and I checked the news and and I had a we have a trip plann to Israel and and uh we were uh we've been excited about it got the the places rented got the hotels rented or the condos rented and got the tickets and all this and I and I opened up the U my iPad yesterday and I looked at the news and I saw that there was this great war that had started and every there was hundred hundreds of people killed already there were hostages taking and all of this and I must admit and I hate to say it but I must admit my my first thought was oh great what about my anniversary and and I thought we have this big highrise rented um in Jerusalem and it's overlooking the old city of Jerusalem and I just couldn't wait to get up there and show Stephanie this and there's a b big window there and my first thought was I guarantee you there's this Palestinian with a rocket launcher looking at that big building saying I think I can hit that and and then after a while I thought Lord this is a serious thing and like like most people in the world today first thing I thought of was I thought of myself greetings God God bless you welcome coming with the with the Salazar family it's good to see you um I was first thinking of myself and and all of this and how often especially we Americans how often we think of ourselves before anything else in the world and I was as I was looking at this in this big war it's the first time in 50 years that Israel has declared war and we look at what's going on there and we know we've been told that Israel is God's time so thinking of of the The Killing and the death and all that's going going on there I know I think what is wrong with these people why do they have this Lust For Blood and this hatred for these Jewish people and I know that there's two sides to every story but there is an unnatural hatred for the Jewish people it happened we saw it with Hitler when he and Stalin when they killed millions of them and I thought what is this that's going on and my mind went back to Jesus and Jesus was prophesying before his second coming he says as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the man son of man so shall it be when we see the second coming of Christ so you look at what was going on in Noah's time and there there was violence the Bible says violence had spread the Earth killing and so much so that that God looked down and and he said that that he grieved him that he had ever even made men to see what was going on now look at what's going on over there in Israel and then just this lust for killing as as many as we can kill as fast as we can kill kill them kill them kill them and you think wow this is exactly what Jesus prophesied was going to come to pass and then he said also in those days of Noah that they were eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage they were going along just the way that that they had always gone not have a care in the world not living for the Lord just just living their lives and and God flooded the Earth and destroyed all the people except eight people that came into the ark seeing that these times are supposed to repeat themselves and then Jesus goes on in Matthew or in Luke 17 and he says and as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man we look what happened with lot God rained down fire from heaven and destroyed these sinful cities because of their sexual immorality and and the way that they live their lives and the disgusting nature that they had and we look at the the time of lot which was the time of Abraham and we see that these immoral people they ruled lot was afraid of them if you didn't know if if you read the story lot was intimidated by this mob that came to his house and he was the governor of the city and Jesus said that these times would repeat again in the last day looking at what's around us and and looking at the violence that's going on in Israel I thought it'd be good before I really get into my sermon it'd be good to maybe give a history on these Jewish people and where they came from and I think that you'll see that the handwriting is on the wall of what's about to happen it was 6,000 years ago right at the dawn of mankind that God had created man and created him a wife and there they are in the Garden of Eden and they fell into sin God tells Adam and Eve he says that I've created all of this for you and enjoy everything that's here but just don't eat of the fruit of this one tree just don't do this one thing because if you do that then you will die so goes on as human nature is maybe the Curiosity of what he was talking about happened we know that Eve fell and then she caused Adam to fall and then God was looking at them looking for them in the Garden of Eden and he saw that they were hiding in the in the bushes there and that they were embarrassed and God saw that they had sinned so God goes and to atone for that sin to cover their nakedness to cover their sin God goes and he kills an animal probably I would think that it was a lamb he kills this animal to cover their sin to stay to put off the wrath of God because remember he said you will die so so he takes this and he he he makes he he he kills this animal and he makes the very first sacrifice we've heard of sacrifice the Jewish sacrifices that is the very first sacrifice that was ever made and it was God that made it himself then time goes on and I want you to remember the numbers as I speak time goes on and I just talked about Noah and how God had destroyed the the Earth and then then they they after no they multiply again and then they build this Tower of Babel and it's just sin is covering the Earth and it there was violence and there was sin and immorality and there was idolatry idol worship and then 2,000 years after that original sin there came a man that stood against idolatry there came a man that God God spoke to he saw this great character in The in this man named Abraham God speaks to this man and he makes a covenant with his Abraham Abraham and his wife as you know they couldn't have children God makes this Covenant with Abraham he says Abraham I will create in you Nations and if you look up at the stars your deed will be more than the stars of the sky and here's a man that had never even had children and he says from you will come this line and this nation that any this nation will not only be the greatest nation ever but it will bless all the other nations a promise to this man Abraham so Abraham he had met this man that had told them these things was God King and talked with Abraham himself in this mysterious man called mzc and how mzc had come and talk to Abraham under this oak tree and Abraham knew that this was God God had appeared once again to a man 2,000 years after the original Abraham has a son named Isaac then he has another son or then Isaac has a son named Jacob and in this man Jacob God gives him 12 sons and these Sons create from these Sons God makes this greatest nation ever he changes this man's Jacob's name to to Israel and through the children of Israel God creates this great nation that is blessed beyond measure and as time goes on this man Jacob named Israel he says that through you Israel that through your lineage will come the Redeemer of mankind will come the sacrifice that will atone for the sins like was set forth in the Garden of Eden but this one won't be something to just stay the wrath of God this will be the Redeemer that will take all the sins of mankind upon himself called the Messiah as time goes on from that 2,000 years then the time starts ticking and it goes goes on to this man David who becomes this great king of this newly formed nation of Israel and then God says that that this man David was a man after his own heart and through this man's lineage this man David's lineage that he will bring another king of Israel that King is that same one that was spoken of earlier was the very Messiah and then as time goes on the prophets begin to prophesy they prophesy about this coming Messiah how this Redeemer this kinsman redeemer is going to come year after year decade after decade hundreds of years pass and then what we call the Old Testament closes with a prophet the very last words in the Old Testament Malachi chapter 4 it says this for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yay and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayeth the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and you shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this sayeth the Lord of hosts remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel with the statutes and judgments behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with the curse almost 2,000 years had passed since this man Abraham this man Malachi prophesies this then 2,000 years after Abraham comes the Fulfillment of all of the prophecies about this Lamb of God one of the prophecies was a virgin shall conceive by the prophet Isaiah and then this virgin named Mary has a child his name is Jesus and he redeems all of Israel of their sins yet he came to his own own people but his own people this country that we're seeing out there didn't receive him it was a very strange thing the one that they had been praying for the one that' be looking for the one that they had prophesied would come he comes and the ones his own people didn't even receive him they said he was false and it because of their way of thinking it was because that they had gotten ingrained sin so much had covered the Earth this time before it was idolatry and it was it was immorality this time sin had covered the Earth so much and now it was a self-righteous Holiness stubborn spirit that was there and that was the spirit that said we won't receive him so then these this man his disciples and those that believed him began to preach his message around Jerusalem around Israel the places that we're looking at now and God caused what's called a slumber he call caused a sleep to come upon the Jewish people and upon the Jewish Nation it's written here in Romans 11 verse 7 one of these Apostles is speaking one of these Apostles that was that really got the message out of Jesus Christ This Man Paul who was the one who spearheaded the message going out across the world he says this he says what then Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded according as it is written God hath given them the Spirit of Slumber eyes that they should not not see and ears that they should not hear unto this day and David saith let their table be made a snare and a trap and a stumbling block and and a recompense unto them and let their eyes be darkened that they may not see and their bow and bow down their back all way I say then have they stumbled that they should fall God forbid but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy now if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the diminishing of the riches of the Gentiles how much more the fullness and as I stated 2,000 years had passed so there was 2,000 years from Adam to God visiting Abraham and starting this great nation of Israel and then from from Abraham to Jesus was 2,000 years and then we see God move away from this nation Israel blinded them as the Bible says caused them to fall asleep and he goes to this group of people that were never considered one of God's God's people they're always considered heathens in the Old Testament so God goes to those people and then the message starts spreading around the world this message of Jesus Christ a redeemer and he wasn't just to the Jewish people he was to us too and we can have our sins forgiven it was CA called the Gentile dispensation many of you have heard that word but that's a dispensing or a giv out giving out of the Gospel to the Gentile group with the Jews over here blinded sleeping not seeing all of this we go we go through and there's throughout history we see people like irenius and Martin and and and these Great Men of God St Patrick and these men and John Wesley and Martin Luther these men that continued spreading this Gospel of Jesus Christ and it just went around the world expanded and expanded and expanded until now when it's stopped for the first time in 2,000 years the Christian church was once this great it started to shrink less people coming to church less people wanting salvation less of a desire for to to have their sins forgiven and that's where we stand today Christianity is shrinking God is beginning to turn his eyes from them from us back to his promised people which are the Jews there was a man one of the greatest Jewish rabbis in modern history lived in Jerusalem he was born in around 1900 back then you don't know exactly when you're born brother brandham said even brother brandham even said he didn't know exactly when he was born he said it's marked by something like that's when the big oak tree fell is is the year that that uh he was born this man named Rabbi Yak kaduri he's considered a prophet in Israel he's born around 1900 he died in January of 2006 2 100,000 people lined the streets of Jerusalem at his funeral that's how much he was respected and regarded as a man of God before he died he took a piece of paper and he wrote on it that God has told me who the Messiah is he sealed it and he said don't open it until one year after I die that was in 2006 2007 they take this man of God they take this note that he wrote they open it up Yeshua Jesus is the Christ and he is returning again we see this is a respected Rabbi no they didn't all they didn't all believe it we see that the focus is beginning to change to these people this Jewish nation and we look at us and we get so many people they get caught up in the Jews the Jews are an alarm clock they're a Time piece and when your alarm clock goes off in the morning don't just sit there and stare at it that's not going to do you any good get up get up and get to work you got to go am the alarm is telling you don't you're not to we're not to just stare at the alarm clock and say say oh well oh praise the Lord I made another day and look at this it's 5:30 wow it's time to get up Timothy Paul's last letter Paul the last thing the Apostle Paul wrote he was just about to go to his execution and Paul writes this to Timothy for the Gentile Church 2 Timothy 3:1 he says this this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves it seems so normal to us for men should be lovers of their own selves men this word men means people they shall be lovers of Their Own own selves Instagram Snapchat Facebook putting a shrine up of themselves so everyone could see can see it loving myself covetor and boaster pl proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers think about what just happened in Our House of Representatives what an odd thing never happened before in the history of the United States they kick out a speaker for the vote of a few people in his party and you have another party that is so divisive they will not budge neither of them neither side will budge so this group of of Representatives decides that they are going to kick out this speaker and what had happened the speaker and the former speaker had made an agreement and she made him a promise she said if there's any problems she said we will stand with you being the Democrat side so when the vote comes up before the house what does she do and what do they all do they break their Covenant nope we're going to kick you out we're going to stand with the other ones truce Breakers false accusers incontinent losing their temper at every little thing you can't tell me what to do fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God let me just ask you don't have to raise your hand I don't think yeah no probably not how many people spend more time looking at things on YouTube that are not of God than you do looking at things that are of God how many people here ask yourself how much time do I spend time that I have I can do whatever I want how much time do I spend looking at something that is not of God versus looking at the things that are of God judge yourself having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away for of this sort are they which creep into houses and Le lead captives silly women Laden with sins and led away with divers lust ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth and there has never been a generation until now that had so much access to the knowledge as we do anything I want to know I ask Google and that guy wow he tells me everything that I want to know ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth that's what Paul is writing to Timothy saying hey these times are coming it's so common us it looks so normal to us because we grew up in it or it's just it's just slid right in but it should be the alarm clock going off something's happening this thing over in Israel this may not be it but you see the spirit as it was in the days of Noah the violence was everywhere and the hatred for these people they won't stop until those Jews are dead why it's a warning sign it's a sign that God is on the way that this second coming of Christ is right at hand and as I said before it's easy to get distracted with Israel I went over there and and I was just looking around I was like man it looks feels like the sun's brighter it feels like the food tastes better it feels like just everything it just feels better here and I can see that someone could get caught up with that and they start looking at Israel and then they that becomes their focus and then they want to try to be that we are not most of us Jewish we're Gentiles that isn't for us it's different and we are different people but what it is is it's an alarm saying get ready but as I said don't just stare at the alarm clock get up and do something get up and get to work I had a friend Jewish old Jewish man that had given his heart to the Lord and and one of the most influential people on me that in my whole life and he was from Jerusalem he lived there for a long time he gave his heart to the Lord he he heard about brother brandom's message and he started believing that and he had just this message just became his life and he and I were talk Talking we talked very often and he'd tell me he'd say why do you want to be bride he said the Jews are Jesus's Brethren and and I was like you know I never thought about that but I want to be bride and he's said oh you're you know you're you're you're just the Gentiles you're descendants of ham I was like ham he say ham and he you get upset at the Gentiles he said this book he said this new testament he said it's a Jewish book he said they're all Jews Matthew Mark Luke J John maybe not Luke but at least partially John Peter Paul they're Jews and he says why did he go to the Gentiles he said and he quote Romans he said they were blinded he said but it's coming back to the Jews and we would he and I would we had spirited conversations and and he' he'd say why do you want to be bride and I was like well you get to live in the palace with the bridegroom no no he says no you be his Brethren why would you want to be so it was it was a different way of thinking and the Jewish people have a different way of looking at things look at Abraham God says I'm gonna destroy it could you Siri said I heard me talk about Abraham sorry she there everywhere if it's not Google it's Siri maybe they'll get married but we we look at these things and and we are different people look at Abraham look at the way that Abraham was God says I'm going to destroy Sodom and he's like what about if you found 50 what about if you found 40 30 20 10 you and me we're not going to talk to God that way Lord yes what can I do to get my family out of there that's our attitude but the Jewish people and the gentile people they look at things differently and we shouldn't try to be them but now this time is changing from the Gentile dispensation and it's moving it's going to move back to the Jews and the alarm clock is going off and as I said don't just stare at the alarm clock it's not going to do any good to just stare at it turn it off and get up the alarm clock's telling you every morning Monday through Friday or whatever it is you got to get up and go to work and that's the same with us we see what I just read in second Timothy it's a sign of what's Happening happening in the world today another sign I read Malachi 4 there is Jesus and Jesus himself says this John the Baptist that was sent they come to Jesus and they said they said hey we read Malachi and we thought that uh Elijah was supposed to come first you know what Jesus says he says he did come and you missed him to turn the heart of the father fathers to the children and he left out the other part of Malachi 4 the part about about the walking out on the ashes of the wicked and burning as as an oven and all that hasn't happened yet Jesus left part of that to go to today to turn the heart of the children back to that of Peter and James and John back to receiving that Holy Spirit and we see wow this is happening has happened in our time it's another alarm clock that's going off but don't stop and just stare at the alarm clock it's telling us something get up and get to work be up and doing I I look at the there's so much there's so much to do there's so many people that need they need us I was the other day I was talking with I think I was talking with um maybe Stephanie forgot who it was but we're talking about this time and getting to the finish line and I was I said it's like all of us let's say all of this in in this church or let's say just this row here and me we're all chained together and we've got to get across the finish line down there I can only go as fast as the slowest person that's chained to me and the F the fastest person can only go as fast as the slowest person we have to get all together and get across this Finish Line the Bible says that those of us that are strong should bear the infirmities of those that are weak so if we're all coming to an end that we're coming to the end of this Gentile dispensation when God's going to turn his his eyes from us if you knew that it's going to happen I suggest that you start getting people picking them up and carry I'm going across the Finish Line because if you don't whether we're chained or not there's going to be a lot of people that don't make it if we see this alarm we see God's alarm going off let's get it moving there this church there are many people that should be here that need to be here that you all know that would benefit from knowing the Lord that would benefit from fellowship that would benefit from each other there's many people that you know that need to be here what if his eyes turn and time's over you've lost them you've lost them because you didn't pick them up and carry them across the finish line I'm not saying they have to come to this church this is just our church but they have to get to Christ but before you can get them to Christ before that you can pick pick this person up and carry them you have to be right first I have to be right first it's like if you see somebody out there in the in the ocean that's drowning and you swim out there to save this person you're out there the water's deep what's the when you grab a hold of them what's the first thing they're going to do they're going to push you down and if you're not ready you're going to drown you have have to be trained you have to be right you have to have swam you have to know how to swim you know have to know how to take care of someone that's out in the ocean and then you can help them you can talk calm down I'm gonna help you just roll over on your back and I'll swim you back to shore but if you don't know what you're doing first thing that they're going to do is they're going to push you down you're both going to drown so we have to know before we get out there in that deep water we have got to be in the place that we should be we have to have What's called the new birth we have to have What's called the holy spirit that Spirit of Christ that was in the earth back in the in the disciples that this man Elijah his Spirit was going to return us back to that that same Spirit has to be in US so that we are able to do something because the time's getting short the alarm went off we don't have enough time I feel so bad for um sometimes brother Arie and sister Rachel because I'm always like hey we we need to we need to do this um and I want I want to have this and there's sister Rachel back there and and and and I think I wonder what what she's thinking it's always one thing after the next after the next and I could just see I could just hear the thoughts and I wish he would chill out it's stressing me out or maybe not in those words but I feel like we don't have enough time I feel like we got to get it done I feel like the time is ticking the alarm clock went off and we got to get these souls in in any way we can we got to teach them about Jesus Christ if it's going to get you across the Finish Line we'll carry you if we have to then once we get right once we've learned how to swim then God will place gifts into the church I don't have time to read it 1 Corinthians chapter 12 it shows us that there are different gifts that are placed into the church and each person has his or her special gift that God brings into the body to make it whole Paul likened it to the body he said you you have toes and you have a nose you have ears he might not have created you to be this but the body is not complete with all of these people in there all of the gifts operating in in unity you might say well what's my my gift you got to get with Christ first and learn to swim then give your heart to him and then you won't Elevate yourself you won't be trying to draw attention to yourself as the world teaches us to do but you'll follow the Master's orders I had a friend I remember when I was in junior high this um there's this guy named Wyatt goodier and uh Wyatt um is an odd Odd Fellow um but uh I think we're in seventh grade Mr claude's class in seventh grade was science class so Mr Claude tells us he said and we're talking about the anatomy and we're talking about physiology and how your body works and and involuntary responses versus voluntary responses and breathing and heartbeats and all that and he saysi want everybody to do this he said I want everybody to hold their breath as long as they can so we're like okay great and he says I want to show you what it does so there I don't know there's 20 or third 30 of us in the class so we all take a big breath and we start holding our breath and you we we start pounding on the desk and and most of us cheated I took a couple breaths and and then I drew some attention to myself like you know and then and and everybody else was doing it and then finally everyone had given up but the instructor the professor he looked out across the audience and he said there is one person in this class that's doing it right and we all looked around and everybody was just sitting there and he pointed to Wyatt Goodyear and Wyatt was sitting at his desk like just normal his chest was moving up and down like he was breathing his nostrils were flaring like he was breathing and Mr Claude said look at him we all look over at him and he says he looks like he's breathing doesn't he look yeah he say he's not he says that's the that's the response of his body to having a lack of oxygen it's trying to get oxygen into the body so we're like whoa and here's poor Wyatt and he's still not breathing so then finally Mr Claud says okay Wyatt you can breathe so I was looking at that and something inside of me said remember that that it's the ones like me and and like all the other kids in the room we were drawing attention to ourselves but there was one that took it seriously and you may not have seen him doing it but he was living that life he was doing exactly what the professor said what the master said and sometimes you may not think and anybody's watching you may not think that that you're important but in all of that class the professor singled him out as the one that was doing it I asked him later I said hey Wyatt I said uh how'd you do that and he's like oh yeah he says my brothers and I used to have a con contest on who could hold their their breath the longest and and the first one to pass out lost I like definitely a marketable skill um good luck with that in the future but it made a it made an impression on me I think that we when we find our gift when we we start operating in the Lord's perfect plan then we will see our Ministries each of us and let me tell you everyone in the building has a Ministry don't think you don't but you do and your ministry if you would dedicate your life to him if you would put him first then God would operate in that Ministry Satan will try to hinder hinder you and he'll try to he'll try to shut you down he'll try to everything else in the world he'll come against you but if you will dedicate your life to him if I will dedicate my life to him then he will use us and my point in saying all of this is we're seeing the alarm clock going off and this Spirit of Slumber that's upon all of us it's all good everything's going to be okay I'm a Christian exactly what was happening in Noah's time change put God first in your life look at that alarm clock don't jump up and down and rejoice because it's 5:30 in the morning it's time to get up and go to work get up and go to work see that and operate in the calling that he is given each of you that he has given me or let me tell you there will be people that don't come to the Lord because of our laziness I believe God has a plan in all of it but I don't want to be guilty of that I don't want you to be guilty of that and I certainly don't want the people who would be understanding the Lord that would have a relationship with the Lord I certainly don't want those people to be left behind because of my own laziness this Gentile dispensation is closing how many years was it from Abraham from from Adam and Eve to Abraham 2000 how many years from Abraham to Jesus 2,000 how many years from Jesus to here 2,000 it's time the alarms are going off whether you believe what I say or not these things line up and the time is late the alarm clock is going off so now what do we do there's a prayer that the Apostle Paul who started really this Gentile dispensation that he prayed in Ephesians chapter 3 and it's one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen and I see the heart of Christ in this man Paul is seeing all of these people maybe that he's led to the Lord and he's he's writing to this group in Ephesus loving these people now watch what the man of God says Ephesians chapter 3:14 is praying for this cause I bow my knees under the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with the might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love let me tell you something I'll stop right there the musicians can prepare I'll stop right there for a moment rooted that you being he's praying that you would be rooted and grounded in love all the sermons I could preach all of the testimonies I could give all of the doctrine I could tell you it would come to not if it wasn't for love remember in in uh a few weeks ago we were at our camp and there was there was these boys that were there that were just causing a ruckus and just just being a pain in the neck they weren't part of our group and I got ticked off atam and my first thought was to get these kids out of here they're causing a problem I want these boys out and some of you were there and witnessed this brother Paul you were right there and I was fired up man and I I said I want you three boys over here right now and they're like the dad was over there and I set them three down and I said I'm sick and tired of this that was Dan but then brother Daniel started to come out a little bit and I said do you boys understand why we're here and I started talking to them started telling them testimonies about the Lord and how good he is and what I've seen in my life and what my family has seen and telling them listen you boys this is really this is the most important thing that can do in your life is give your heart to the Lord and as and as it went on I made a decree I said you boys are part of our camp now and I said I want you to respect all these other kids and I want all these other kids to respect you and when we have a when we have an event I want you boys there you boys are now part of us many of you kids remember the kids they participated in our events they were very respectful after that they even came to the service on Sunday morning and the one boy as hard as you can be two boys that as hard as you can be I look out and I see the one with his head bowed and the tears coming down and I look at the other one and he walks up to Daniel my son and he just gives him a big hug love conquers all I could have kicked them out but what good would that have done what good would that have done those Souls that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and the length and the depth and the height and to know the love of Christ which passes which passes knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness fullness of God now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in US unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages this one too Without End you know I wish it's all was reading that yesterday and preparing I was sitting in my chair and I was reading that and I said Lord I wish a man or a woman who really knows you who really loves you who really knows how to pray I wish that person would pray that prayer over me that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and the length and the depth and the height and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that ye might be filled with all of the fullness of God what what a prayer that the Apostle prayed before the father Lord that they would know you that they would know how big you are that they would know everything about you and that you that they might be fulfilled with all the fullness of God what a statement how many of us in this room how many of us pray like that how many of us pray for each other like that it's a lesson to me I pray that many of you pray the same for me and I'll pray the same for you let's bow our heads the first step would be baptism as the Apostle Peter laid forth the first step would be the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins for the taking away of sins heard that there's a baptism today if you would go and make your way to the back sister G sister gar if you would if you would meet in the back if there's a brother also meet brother Ed or brother Arie in

blessing upon all that are in this building today that each one would know the love of God which passes Lord all of our understanding and all that the world has to offer Lord may we know beyond any doubt the love of Christ father May each one here today Lord may they know may they have that revelation of God and if they don't know you father if they don't know you in the way that you want them

and the length and the depth and the height and to know the love of Christ with pass which passes knowledge that you might be filled with the fullness of god father those words that I just read may they be the case with all the people here at the Tucson Tabernacle may your will be done father in Jesus name amen friends God will soon by this word he will soon turn his eyes from the Gentiles he
