the lord a praise offering with your hands this morning hallelujah hallelujah amen believe that praise god appreciate that worship god bless you amen i greet you this morning hebrews chapter 12. you just want to keep playing that just for a moment as they find their place just play that softly hebrews chapter 12 while you're finding your place i'd like to say that just one announcement that we have concerning sunday school it's been upon our heart to uh to implement a sunday school for the children and uh we haven't figured it all out yet i just wanted to put that forward to you that we are working on that and trying to structure it amen in a way that would be that would fit and would work not sure really yet of the ages um and where the classes how many classes we'll have but i just want to say that uh you know the bible says that you should train up a child in the way that he should go and that when he's old he won't depart from it and so we can see that pattern throughout the whole bible that david would repeat it jeremiah would repeat it i'll cause you to hear my words and then you shall teach it to your children and then their children shall teach their children another generation david repeats it over and over all throughout the entire bible and so we know it's important we know that that there's a there's a value in teaching the word of god that starts at the home from the mother amen and the sunday school teacher doesn't replace that you don't you don't come to church necessarily to to have a relationship with the lord now you can start here but church isn't about having a race a relationship or even a spiritual experience with the lord church is to enrich the experience you already have amen churches to take a spiritual experience that your relationship you already have your children are to know the lord from what they're told at home and then we help to instill that amen and so we believe it's important we want to have that and so there will be more announcements coming for the structure of that how that will look if you have a desire something upon your heart you want to say if i could be of help we can't use everybody but if you want to express that amen just let us know if you have you know have a desire to do that amen and we'll sure appreciate that you love the lord amen thank you for all the music book of romans if you have your bible we'll just have you turn i'm sorry hebrews chapter 12 book of hebrews chapter 12. we just want to read just a portion of scripture here and then have you be seated amen looking forward to tonight as for the lyle amen johnson to speak for us lord put that upon my heart so i'm in an anticipation for that amen but wanting to see what the lord has for us today i believe he has something amen specific amen for his children for you for me say lord i believe you have something specific something you want to say brothers if you have that power point you can display that whenever you want or the scriptures first would be fine hebrews chapter 12 verse 18 i just want to read a portion here i'd like to speak to you this morning on refuse not the voice refuse not the voice for you are not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire now we're going to read in deuteronomy 4 and 5 where what paul is referencing here in hebrews but he says for you are not common to the mount that might be touched and that burn with fire nor into blackness and darkness and tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the sound of words which voice they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded now notice and if so much as a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with the dart and so terrible was the sight that word terrible is a word that we maybe would think you know in our english word terrible would be awful but uh this word here is actually would would you'd misunderstand if you understood it that way it actually is our english word awesome and so he says here in verse 21 and so awesome was the sight awesome is also a word that we could misunderstand because we think of cool we think of you know something great but that's really not what awesome means awesome is something that is grand glorious great hard to be fathomed hard to take in and he says that it was so awesome so magnificent so powerful that moses said now here's god's prophet i exceedingly fear and quake but you are coming to mount zion and unto the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to god the judge of all i love this and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel see that you refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spoke on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved i love that let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our god is a consuming fire let's just bow our heads if you have a need something upon your heart you just want to raise your hand to the lord as we pray heavenly father we're in great need i raised both of my hands this morning how we need you lord god this morning father to come by your word in your way lord which you can only do only you can do lord man can't manufacture it though they try lord man can't you can't uh try to hype it up lord though many have tried but lord when that voice of god speaks to the heart of your child lord it's it's something that's unique something that's sovereign something that's specific for every individual now may you do that this morning lord i've studied i've done my part lord put myself aside in prayer lord in meditation now god come and break the bread of life to each and every single one for this sunday morning service we ask in jesus christ's name amen you can be seated this morning you could put my powerpoint if you could brothers up i believe one of the greatest one of the greatest blessings uh as a child of god as a son or daughter of god is the blessing to hear the voice of god and it's possible today to hear the voice of god sister asked me here recently brother matt how do you mention about hearing the voice of god and you know does that mean that it you know do you actually hear an audible voice or you know and and she was asking a reference because she's looked in her own life and i you know just said in my own self i said you know my testimony is is that god's voice is has spoken to me many times in my life and in many different ways you know he's spoken through men he's spoken through the agency of man he speaks when i open the word and i read the word of god it becomes more than just what i read or what i you know can intellectually understand but i hear the voice of god speaking solomon spoke of it and said the voice of my beloved you know and so you know the voice of your beloved i've heard it through the tapes of god's prophet i could hear the voice of god and i could hear what god's saying to me specifically i could hear the voice of god through a prayer maybe that someone prays and then other times god has came in my prayer closet and maybe that's not a literal place but sometimes my prayer closet is in my vehicle driving down the road sometimes it's at work sometimes it's at church sometimes it's laying on my laying my head on my pillow at night and just pondering the things of god and and then suddenly uh the voice of god begins to speak to my heart and i know that it's his voice say brother matt is that possible jesus said my sheep knows my voice they hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow you know brother branham says this here he says even of industry and let me turn this on here he says i'm just your brother but by the grace of god when the angel of the lord moves down it becomes then a voice of god to you maybe if i offended you by saying that forgive me but i felt that might be resented but i am god's voice to you see i say that again that time was under inspiration see i felt bad about it the first time but it repeated it i'm god's voice to you brother branham before he says this he said it becomes then when the angel of the lord moves down it becomes then a voice of god to you so it's more than just a kentucky hillbilly's uh seventh grade education or his his la his uh his grammar it becomes more than just a tape it becomes more than just a preacher but it becomes the voice of god to you it's speaking to you lip to ear and you say brother matt well then that then i just you know i just have to turn on the tape now listen to what brother branham says here because a lot of people have have have you know as they have done many times you can take any one quote and make a doctor and make an entire uh denomination out of it listen to what brother branham says to make sure you catch the thought here and he says now god could have sent the angel down couldn't he he could have let the angel come himself but instead of that he sent the angel to speak through the voice of a man god always used man for his work is that right he don't use organizations or so forth and mechanical devices but he uses men the holy spirit fell upon men that's god's instrument on earth now we know this here from the bible the bible goes on we can we can just really lay a really long foundation and have no time but he says here he says that it's a it's a voice backing up the hebrews here he says he has given us a promise and a warning about hearing his voice now listen to what he says here he says you are coming to mount zion unto the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem to an innumerable company of angels so you can hear the voice of god because you're not coming to the mountain of fire and quaking that can't be touched but you're come you've you've come to the the assembly of the firstborn mount zion listen what brother madam says here it's like this microphone that i'm speaking through that microphone is a mute unless there's something to speak through it it can't speak through itself it's got to have something to speak through so it's not the microphone it's the voice the noise behind that the microphone transmits to the airwave to your ear it was never about the literal voice it was never about the literal mountain it was never about the literal voice brother branham speaks about the literal blood and he says even if you had a literal vial a vial a real vial of the blood of jesus he said it wouldn't save you because it's not the it's not the chemistry it's the life that's in the blood so it's not about people get people can become catholicism has turned everything uh into natural things into natural uh rosary beads and hail mary's and people come and do their penance and somehow they think because they did a natural act that they that that you know something natural to them that appeases their conscience but brother madam said it's not about it's not about uh uh hail mary's or or or rosaries or or say your penance or your confession to a priest it's about the life behind the blood it's about the spirit of the of god speaking through the agency of man it's not about the words that i speak today it's not about my voice it's about what you hear if you hear the voice of god when the angel lord comes down it becomes a voice of god to you listen what brother branham says here now that's the way it is in preaching the gospel it's not we ourselves as ministers we are not the gospel but we are only transmitters that transmit the voice of god through our agency now he didn't leave he didn't bring it all to himself he didn't say i'm the only voice that god speaks through brother branham says but the preaching of the gospel is the voice of god to you say brother matt how do i hear the voice of god uh believe in god with all your heart the bible said jesus said it this way he said if you seek me with all your heart and i'll be found of you he's a he's a rewarder of those that diligently seek him he says we as ministers are only transmitters that transmit the voice of god through our agency of men to the hearer you believe that so you can hear as you say brother matt can we hear the voice of god today as clearly as samuel heard it as clearly as david heard it as clearly as paul heard it as peter heard it as the new testament church as john on the owl of patnas patmos heard it his voice has become clearer in this age than any other age and god's voice is speaking it's got a message we've been saying it to you for two weekends now the voice of god is speaking whether you hear it or not whose voice hebrews 12 26 whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven and so god is speaking of something here and he says in hebrews verse 27 here verse 26 he says whose voice then shake the earth but now as promised i shake not only earth but also heaven so here's god's warning to to the family of god not to the heathen but to the believer here's his warning verse 25 hebrews 12 verse 25 see that you refuse not him that speaketh amen for if they escape not who refused him that spoke on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven god's spirit's crying it's been crying for generation after generation come out of her my people be not a partaker of her sins why is god calling because god's got to have a people he's got to have an elected group of people who aren't troubled by the trouble of the last day who aren't shaken by the shaking of the last day hour who are in crisis though the rest of the world's at crisis he's got to have a generation of people who can hear the voice of god who can react to the voice of god who can live daily hearing that voice that speaks to their soul god speaks and it's a clear voice and you live by that voice those people are directed by that you say brother matt why do we need the voice of god because it's your direction in your life the sons of god are led by the spirit of god it gives you direction uh that voice is your comfort in the midst of troubling times what comforts you the voice of god who speaks to me maybe through a song maybe through a musical instrument maybe through a sermon maybe through a prayer maybe through his presence but he's speaking it's your guidance and the people of god are governed by the word of god i want you to notice this here as we just just bear with me as we lay this foundation god has always spoke to his children uh adam and eve the bible says in genesis 3 18 heard the voice of god speaking heard the voice of god speaking in the cool of the evening brother branham said god would come down and speak to his children uh it was even sin what was what was the bible says it was sin who came into the into their hearts that calls them to not hear the voice of god the but the bible says here that they heard the voice in the garden and was afraid so the same voice that brought comfort brought fear suddenly because of sin abraham the bible says the father of nations the father of nations the bible says that abraham notice this in genesis 22 18 you might just want to get some scriptures ready brother because i'm going to read a lot of them and i want to put them up genesis chapter 22 verse 18 this is the promise and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because this is genesis 22 verse 18 because thou has obeyed my voice he says this series says because that abraham has obeyed my voice look at verse 5 genesis 26 verse 5 because that abraham obeyed my voice kept my charge my commandments my statutes my laws what did my what was abraham doing he was not just hearing the voice of god he was becoming obedient to the voice of god he says in exodus 19 verse 19. and when the voice of the trumpet sounded long and waxed louder and louder moses spoke and god answered him by a voice god answered him by a voice so moses didn't do anything without hearing that voice always had to hear the voice of god for his life the bible says in exodus 19 24 i want i want you to pick this up if you have it exodus 19 let's start with verse 21 uh brother exodus 19 21 good and the lord notice this dialogue here and the lord said unto moses and the lord said unto moses look at verse 23 verse 23 and moses said unto the lord the lord said unto moses and moses said unto the lord look at verse 24 then the very next verse and the lord said unto him look at look at chapter 20 verse 1 and god spoke what is it what is what is he saying here this is a this is this is more than just a religion this is more than just a a you know a worshiper out of duty this is a relationship you're reading about it's god speaking to moses and moses said unto the lord and the lord said to moses and moses said unto the lord and god spoke to moses and then moses said back what's he typing it's going to be more than just religious duty but the voice of god is going to speak and there's going to be a people to not only hear but a people who speak back to the lord and god's voice was speaking a voice that's alive a voice that says that's speaking he says in deuteronomy chapter 4 and verse 10 gather me the people together and i will make them hear my words that they may learn to fear me all the days that thou shalt live upon the earth this is deuteronomy 4 10. uh uh he says and and they may teach their children notice this here they may live upon the earth that they may teach their children uh he says here in chapter and verse 12 and the lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire you heard the voice of the words but saw no similitude only you heard a voice the lord spoken to you in the midst of the fire you heard the voice of the words but you didn't see the similitude what is the similitude it's the form in other words god is saying the form is not what's important brother branham said it this way he said god god changes his masks but his character never changes you you saw no similitude you saw no form because the form of the voice of god takes on many different forms it isn't going to be one form or one picture one portrait or one god says but you saw no you heard the voice what was important is that you heard the voice of god and i want you to notice this here he says you you saw no similitude out of the midst of the fire and and and he says here in in verse 33 did ever people hear the voice of god speaking out of the midst of the fire as thou has heard and live he says in verse 36 out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice that he might instruct thee thou heardest his words thou earnest his words chapter 5 the next chapter verse 24 and you said we have heard his voice we have seen this day that god does talk with man and live so there was there was a type for the chin of israel they now notice i want you to notice this shift i want you to notice this turn here because it's important and chapter 5 verse 25 now therefore why should we die for this great fire will consume us if we hear the voice of the lord our god any more then we shall die for who is there of all flesh that hath heard the voice of the living god speaking out of the midst of the fires we haven't lived go thou near and hear all the lord our god shall say and speak thou unto us all that the lord our god shall speak unto thee and we will hear it and we will do it isn't it amazing i i just want to i want to stop here just for a moment you notice this is this is what paul is speaking of in hebrews chapter 12. and he says he says here here they are they're they're they're they're israel's camped at mount sinai and they've they they were suddenly this great fire this great darkness just engulfs the whole mountain and the scripture says this blazing uh fire and this this thunderings and this this loud noise all of these things what was it it was it was a visible manifestation of jehovah who they had been following through a prophet through god's prophet through god's messenger and now god comes down himself and he lights the mountain on fire there's roaring there's thundering there's power there's glory there's lightning flashing thunder rolling and and and out of the midst god out of all of that god speaks and he says these words the lord spoke unto you unto all of your assembly deuteronomy 5 22 and the mountain of the midst of fire of the cloud of the thick darkness with a great voice so now these mountains are on fire they're all uh and what was that it was a supernatural was the consuming fire and here this great power and glory of god as you could hear the thunder and see the lightning and and then through all of that through all of the all of the awesomeness here comes the voice of jehovah the same one who said to the darkness let there be light and there was light the same one who spoke to the sea oh spoke to the to the winds and the air and the water the same voice of creation oh brother benham said breathe upon seeds and life came forth and now that voice is speaking to the god's people and the and the bible says god's voice spoke utterly uh audibly and now all israel hears this and the scripture says paul says in hebrews is that they froze they were paralyzed by such a great voice and they were so convicted that they would die if the lord didn't stop speaking the bible says that even moses who was a friend of god exceedingly quaked and feared and then the the the thunder stops the lightning stops and and all of the glory you could just hear the thunder just suddenly get quieter and quieter and quieter and you imagine put yourself there with such an awesome experience such a such a power such a glory or it was more than any sacrifice it was it was it was beyond any any religion it was now the voice of the living god who spoke imagine after you came out of that kind of of of of encounter with god you would no doubt just be shaken for for months for years it would have such an effect on you and the bible says that after it all stopped they after that great you know powerful manifestation of this of the living god had stopped the bible says that israel calls a meeting all the heads of the tribes call them meeting and that you know you'd expect them to say oh moses oh it was such a powerful thing on such a glorious thing all the power of god the voice of god oh we just want more of that we just oh if that could just happen in every service if that could happen every day that's what you'd expect but actually it was quite the opposite they said you know this was amazing this was this was amazing this was this was powerful moses this was you know other people have heard the voice of god and lived and we heard the voice of god and and and we seen the fire we heard the thunder and we survived we're still here we can tell our grandchildren about this experience there was a day when god spoke to us you know the the the even you can imagine some of those levitical some of those priests uh saying oh oh well you know we've got such such a testimony to tell such a life uh altering experience and you could even hear don't forget this day we we've got to remember this day the day that the lord again they memorialized it we've experienced it firsthand the almighty god and we lived yet now the now they say now that we've had that experience moses we can't handle that again can't handle that kind of experience moses listen to what the the voice of their words say even in hebrews 12 the scripture we read here i want you to hold your bible open to that uh he says for they could not endure that which was command command notice verse 19 and the sound of the trumpet and the voice of words which voice they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken what they baffled me when i read that wait a minute you just heard this great powerful voice and now you're asking you know that was good and all but no more moses that was just a little bit too much for us to handle and then they go further than that and they they say we don't we don't we can't handle it we don't want to hear god's voice like that anymore moses we don't want to hear that anymore we love the voice of god but but but but if he speaks in this way again you know from from now on what here's what we want moses we want to hear the voice of god but we want it to come through someone else will you hear god for us and then when you speak will you speak to us you see man doesn't they don't want the responsibility of hearing the voice of god directly for themselves so what have we done for generations we've passed it off to a priest or to a bishop or to a prophet or to a minister or to a pastor we don't want that responsibility i don't want that out you know moses here's what we'll do we got a plan moses you're god's prophet you go and speak to god hear the voice of god you experience that then you come and filter it down you know give it to us we can handle that we we we we don't want it directly we don't want this you know though as awesome as it may be we don't want the voice of god directly like that for her life oh my brother my sister but i believe there's a people who quite the opposite of that there's an elected family of god who is saying i don't need it through a preacher i don't need it through my past through my grandfather i don't need it through my family i need to hear it for myself oh intrigued to speak to me that way lord it's like at a funeral you hear about a man who's died and you know sometimes if you never got to know the man or the individual you never never knew much about him maybe a funeral is the only time you ever learned anything about them and someone gets up at a funeral and they begin to tell you and describe to you what he was and and how great he was and the accomplishments and great man and you know you sit there and you hear of this great man and hear how great he was and all the marvelous things he'd accomplished in his life hear about all of his accomplishments you hear about what he did in his life while he lived at a funeral you get to know that man through someone else's experience they can tell you what he did they can tell you how he lived they can tell you what he thought and what he liked and what what what made him happy and the things that he loved and you hear and for church sometimes church just becomes like a funeral service or people just hear about a god and they hear what he was and they hear how they thought but i believe there's a family of god who says i don't want some history lesson i don't want some funeral service i don't just want to know what he did i want to know what's he doing right now oh can you say a man this morning i believe there's a people who can say i don't just want to hear about what he's done but what's he doing right now i can read the word of god and it can tell me what he thought but what's he thinking right now i can hear about what he said you can read the bible to me and i can hear about what the word of god said but brother man what is the voice of god saying right now i don't just want to hear about a history i believe there's a family of god who says bring him up out of history what's he doing today what is jesus christ as the same yesterday today and forever you imagine this as they heard this they they they did they didn't want to they don't want to hear the voice of god they wanted a filter now therefore should we die we consume if we hear the voice of the lord our god anymore that we shall die because there's a responsibility there's a responsibility when you hear the voice of god and people don't want the responsibility we live in a generation of people today where they don't want to hear direct from god they don't want that direct relationship they want it filtered through through prop through through through uh through through proxy brother branham cried out against this and said you want it by proxy you want it through a priest you want it through a preacher you want it through a man you want it through a prophet and god speaks through all of those voices god speaks through all of those agencies but god is saying i want to speak to you directly child i want you to hear my voice directly child how many can say lord i want to hear it i want to hear it directly i want to hear it lip to ear i want to hear it in my in my heart i want to know that i've heard from the voice of god thousands people filling up churches uh wanting you know the a new gospel a new jesus says paul spoke of another jesus that teach that the blood of jesus didn't atone for sin or that you we can only hear god through a man's voice oh listen to me but my brother my sister deuteronomy chapter 8 verse 20 says as the nations which the lord destroyeth before your face so shall you perish because you would not be obedient unto the voice of the lord your god even david heard and spoke to the lord the bible says in psalms chapter 60 verse 6 we've read this here david says god hath spoken in holiness i will rejoice he says in ii samuel chapter 23 verse 2 the spirit of the lord spoke by me second samuel 23 verse 2 he says the spirit of the lord spoke by me and his word was in my tongue the rock of israel verse 3 says the rock of israel spoke to me god still speaks hebrews chapter one verse one god now you don't have to do to turn your god has in these last days spoken unto us unto us by his son who's his son jesus he says god at sundered times in diverse manner spoke in the past unto the fathers that's good you could put that spoken in the past by uh unto the fathers by the prophets so god says there was a generation there was a day uh you know when god spoke through prophets god still speaks through prophets god still through speaks to the fivefold ministry still spoke to us by the seventh angel prophet but but the bible says but god in these last days has spoken verse 2 and he says but hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son who what was the son of man ministry revealed through a prophet it was jesus christ speaking to us through his son some some people heard uh heard a man from kentucky i heard the voice of the lord and i still heard the voice of the lord some people heard nothing more than doctrine some people heard nothing more but dress code some people just heard religion but there's an elected family who heard the voice of their beloved some have just heard it some have just turned it into nothing more than in the nomination as as just an organization that you join but others heard the voice of the living god speaking directly lipped from his voice to your heart and you speak back and you say yes lord be it unto me god god in these last days has spoken to us through his son even paul even even saul uh who was then now paul then saul on the road to damascus the bible says suddenly uh there shined around about him a life from heaven and he fell to the earth and heard a voice in him saying saul saul why persecuted thou me what was paul doing he was hearing directly the voice of god he tells king agrippa i heard a voice speaking unto me and saying in the hebrew tongue and he said rise for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose even peter hears the voice of god in acts 11 verse 7 and i heard a voice saying unto me arise peter slay and eat but i said not so lord but the voice answered me again from heaven and this was done three times what do you find moses heard from god david heard from god paul heard from god peter heard from god and jesus now no john notice john in revelations 3 verse 20 he says behold i stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in unto him and will sup with him and he with me so the voice of god speaking the voice of god's a living voice say brother matt how do i hear that voice let me say more than hearing that voice you've got to become that voice notice what brother branham says here in our powerpoint very next slide brother if you have it you could just put it up brother adam says this side of the lady seeing church age of momentary consideration of the church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the dark ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but god sent luther with the word the lutheran spoke for god at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends towards dogma and creeds and not simple word they could no longer speak for god then god sent wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day right brother madam says when i the angel lord comes down he says i'm god's voice to you luther was god's voice to his generation luther became the voice of god brother branham says in the very next line he said revelation the people so it wasn't let me let me just control it here the people who took his revelation yeah it's one thing to say oh oh god spoke through luther oh praise god he spoke through the message spoke to the messenger now all we have to do is just listen to that voice of that messenger no brother branham says luther became the voice of god to his generation and the people who's the people the people who took his revelation from god became the living epistles read and known of all men in their generation when the method is failed god raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until in this last day how many believe we're in the last day there is again another people there's another people you better recognize who the prophet messenger was for your generation it's important to know who your prophet messenger was because that was god's voice to you but it's just as important it is to recognize a prophet it's better to recognize who you are in all the mystery of god brother branham says again there's a people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice can you say amen to the final age say what's a brother brother matt what what you mean we're going to speak and it's going to be our words or we have preachers preachers speaking listen to me brother that's a shallow understanding of a voice a voice is a life a voice is a life that's lived those people who took that revelation became the written epistles read and known of all men you are the final voice to the final age in other words the manifestation in the word uh the manifestation in the bride of the word is the final interpretation to the world it's not what the messenger not you you i just got to give them a book got to give them a tape that's important but what is that book and that tape produced in you you're the final voice to the final age what is the final voice it's the final life it's the final manifestation brother branham says it this way he says god never left the world without a witness and he says a witness who will stand and testify to him but the prophet of god speaks about witnesses and he says he's always had someone in every generation in spite of all of the accusations he says there's always been a witness a person who has a life who could stand for the testimony of christ and brother branham says you're the final voice you're the final manifestation you're the final interpretation you say brother man interpretation of what you're the final interpretation of what a christian is in 2020 by your words not by your words by your life by how you conduct yourself by how you live fathers you're the final voice you're the final interpretation of what a godly father is to a child in this generation teenagers you're the final interpretation of what a holy ghost-filled teenager is but listen to me husbands and wives your marriage is the interpretation it's the fruit of the word of god in a holy matrimony a holy covenant between a man and a woman do you realize that see why people don't want the voice of god because then the onus is put on you you are the final interpretation your life your witness well they will either prove christ a liar or prove he's the same yesterday today and forever under her messenger she'll be the final voice to the final age the final life find a witness listen to what brother adam says here he says the people uh yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god it's its own mouthpiece so god the church so god is turning on her he'll confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in say it together her say it together her the voice of god will be in yes it is from the last chapter of revelations verse 17 the spirit and the bride say they're saying something not with their voice not with their not with their words their life their manifestation of how they live of how they dress of how they act of how they think he says that the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from god as at pentecost and i say lord let them hear your voice let my life be a manifestation how many want that today to say lord don't don't let me get my opinions out of it let me get my thoughts out of it i'm the final manifestation on the final interpretation then lord let my life be a clear voice let it be clear let it be distinct let the world not misunderstand let them hear direct as brother adam says the voice of god is in her and god's very careful who he speaks to we sing the song shut in with god in a secret place god says i'll speak it'll be through that little secret place i want to hear the voice of god you got to be shut in with god you've got to be shut in in that secret place you say brother man who does god speak to to those who value his voice to those who put emphasis on the voice of god in their life on those who are willing to get the world out jesus says when you pray enter into your secret closet and shut the door what are you doing when you shut that door is it a literal door you shut no it's that door of your mind of all of the problems and all the cares and all the worries and brother adam says what it is it's that dimension you shut that dimension out and it's you in christ you alone with the holy spirit and the voice of god begins to speak and the spirit of the lord begins to discern your heart and you lay all your life you say lord i'm laid out right now all out before you nothing in my heart i want to hide from you jesus you get alone with god notice the voice of god came to moses when he was shut up and he was alone with god even john the baptist the bible says it came to john in the wilderness the voice of god comes to jacob in the desert of haran god spoke to speaks to joshua when he leaves the camp and he goes outside of the camp so i don't hear the voice of god maybe you haven't been alone with god long enough the voice of god comes to paul in the desert the voice of the father comes to jesus what does it say alone in the mountain when he's praying god says you want to hear my voice and hear the voice of god you've got to be willing to be shut in with god in a secret place you know what drowns out the voice of god busyness and sometimes that busyness can be religious busyness jesus says in mark 4 verse 18 he says these are they which are sown among thorns such as hear the word the word mark 4 18 such as hear the word and the cares of this world and the deceitful of rich the deceitfulness of riches and the lust of other things you know why put other things because there would be some things that are unnamed but they would be other things the cares of this world the deceitfulness of riches the lust of other things entering in choke the word and it becometh unfruitful you know what that word choke means it means to drown out to crowd out it crowds out the voice we have so many things in our life that crowd out the voice of god crowd out the voice of the lord sometimes those things are not sinful things sometimes those things are not anything that's of their own merit are wrong but but jesus says this is he who hears the word of god who accepts the word of god it's sown among thorns and they hear it but the cares of this world the deceitfulness of riches and you say well i don't have the cares of this world i don't have the deceitfulness of riches and the lust of other things choke the word and it becomes unfruitful other things drown out the voice of god god's voice speaks and it's clear and and you know when the voice of the lord is speaking to you and and and he says the joy of the of the lord you know what it was to hear the voice of god and the joy of the lord fills and floods your heart oh and there's such joy and there's such rejoicing oh but but then time goes on you still love the lord you still have a heart for god but other things lust of other things are crowding out the voice of the lord they're they're what does that crowd and i do it chokes the voice of god to you and then you say i'm so dry oh i'm so dry i'm so brother man i feel so so carnal i'm just i feel so lukewarm and and i just can't explain it i can't understand it oh but what is it it's other things in your life have choked out the voice of the lord how many are here to be honest today and then that voice gets quieter and that voice grows dimmer that light grows dimmer now that voice of conviction that used to convict your heart and just immediately pierce your heart but when you when you sh when you when you crowd that voice out it becomes quieter and that voice of conviction gets quieter quieter quieter as we said jesus said behold i stand at the door and knock and he's knocking and whosoever heareth my voice but brother madam says god is only obligated to knock once and he says the the more he says he comes he says that that that voice gets quieter quieter and quieter and it chokes and drowns out the voice you say then then that justice you know we've said this before you know the world is so sinful such a dark age and it is and we just you know it's so hard brother matt why is it so hard to pray and i've said it before sometimes it's so hard to get on your knees and contact the holy spirit and maybe in another day going by it wouldn't have been as hard or take you as long but now we live with so many vices in the world so many pressures that we're facing so many so so many spirits and and brother branham describes that he says he says even that that great ring around the the the earth he says was that that barrier with all the sins going up to that barrier which was christ the blood of jesus but that darkness gets thicker and now you have to wait in prayer and you you have to push through and you have to disconnect from so much you have to disconnect from so much of the world but you know often times it's not anything in the world it's disconnecting from things we've put there we have so much less time for the lord i thought about that uh even even in in my uh you know my phone i'm notorious known that my phone's always dead and it's not because they don't charge it it's always dead i look at it you know it's always it's always the battery's always dead it's always going dead it's always one ten percent i always got red i very rarely see white it's always red i gotta charge my phone anybody ever have that problem and i thought about it you know our batteries our spiritual battery we got spiritual batteries too and oftentimes our batteries are at 10 and 5 and 2 and some are dead so what do you got to do you got to plug into the charger you got to plug into the charger so you know what you do what i did what you do is you go and you say i'm so sick and tired of my phone being dead and so you buy a wireless charger you put it by your bed you buy a car charger you put it in your car then you buy the little usb where you have two or three usb ports and you plug four chargers you have a charger by your nightstand you have a charger in your kitchen have a charger in your car what are you doing you're making sure that at no moment are you dead you're always charging you're always plugged in and let me say to you my brother my sister and this age that we live in you need every available charger to your spirit that you can get you need to that's why paul said have a song upon your heart upon your lips uh read your bible pray to the lord have a tape playing even if you even if you're busy have a tape plan what is it doing it's charging your batteries that's what paul says assemble yourselves more as you see a symbol you're not assembled when you're at home but you come to the symboly of god amongst the family of god and paul says assemble yourselves more so as you see that day approaching say brother matt why is it important because you need it you need it your soul needs it why turn on that tape because your soul needs it your children needs it your family needs it your mind needs it i need it you know what i found though you know what i found i found that no matter how many chargers i had i still my phone was still dead say why brother matt because it's one thing to have a charger laying before you but you got to plug into that charger you got to have a connection to that charger and you can lay all the message books have the tape play and have the bible here put it all around you but if you're not tuning in and tuning out of the world and plugging into the world i say lord let me not just have a let me not just come to church and hear a sermon and sit through 60 minutes and through songs but how many could say lord let me disconnect from the world and let me connect to that dimension let me connect let it charge my battery i know it's so simple oh but it's so relevant it's so true you've got to connect unless you're connecting you're not getting a charge and god's speaking you know what god speaking god's speaking something fresh every day as many times i've missed that fresh word of the lord because of other things in my life but god's speaking something fresh every day the spirit and the bride say come the bible says this he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying not what the spirit has just said but what he's saying to the churches you got to be sensitive to the holy spirit because god's saying something to his family even if you're not listening god is speaking hebrews it says today if we will hear his voice hebrews 3 7. today hebrews 3 verse 7 if you will hear his voice today if you will hear his voice verse 8 hearted not your hearts if you will hear his voice hearten not your hearts let me tell you what god's voice is god's voice is a today voice it's speaking today it spoke yesterday it's going to speak tomorrow but it's speaking today it's speaking right now god's saying it's a today voice so don't harden your heart it's an up to the minute it's it's the very second there's something groundbreaking the lord's saying to his children but mark chapter four verse six and it says these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground this is the voice of god mark chapter 4 verse 16. these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground who when they hear when they heard the word immediately receive it with gladness and have no root in themselves and so endure but for a time afterward when affliction or persecution ariseth for the words sake immediately they're offended they love to hear the word with gladness with joy but the bible says here's the problem the word never sinks in the seed never takes root are you here today you know why because god's voice is there for a purpose it's there to take root in your life and it's there to change you it's there to change you oh can i just preach to you today it's there to change your heart it's there to change your spirit day by day by day by day glory unto glory the the the body of christ should be changing coming into the image of this of his son paul says i know not what we shall be when he appears here's what i know we shall be in his very image in his likeness so in order to do that you've got to be changing every day oh but paul says that there will be a change one day brother adam said suddenly you feel a sweep come over your body and he says and your entire elements all of your elements were changed from old to young from unhealthy to healthy from depressed to joy from anxiety to comfort into spirit and love and happiness paul says for this mortal shall put on immortality and this corruptible will put on incorruption we shall be changed how many say lord i want to be changed i want to be changed to see you all raise your hands but do you know the fact that your body will change is that you're changing right now under the preaching of the word the body change won't be some massive step you take it'll just be the next step in your journey you're serving god you're walking with the lord what will that body change be the bible says enoch uh uh uh served god and he was not for he had this testimony he pleased god it's a daily walk he says with glory joy and gladness the word doesn't sink in because why what why why doesn't the word that's preached why does the word preached change one and it doesn't change another why does the rain fall here on this person and even in the church you can have one person receiving the voice of god receiving the word from the lord rejoicing and another person to sit there unmoved unchanged jesus gave us the answer because this is the word which falls upon stony ground stony ground sadly today when we look at this here he says this is they which receives the word but because of state falls upon stony ground where are stony hearts in in the bar st on the bar stool out there on the street in drugs and alcohol no no no no sadly the hardest hearts can be found in church in god's house among those who don't even realize their heart has became hardened christians believers develop hard hearts that's why we read the scripture the voice of god speaks heart and not your heart because a heart heart can't hear the voice of god but god's speaking god's speaking and when you refuse that voice when you refuse him that speaketh that's why paul says refuse not him that speaketh don't refuse it because your heart becomes hard when you refuse the voice of god and that voice can speak through anything and many times we confuse it brother branham speaks about this and recognizing your day and its message he says oh if america could only recognize the constitution she's brought up she wouldn't be willing to take bibles out of the schools take the name of god off coins pledge allegiance under god but she doesn't recognize it why she's blind naked she can't recognize the blood of those things and he begins to speak of of of moses and he says he recognized his day in his calling when he saw the promises god of god's word for that day vindicated he knew then he realized what he was and what he was going to do by the promised word so he didn't fear what anybody said he wasn't ashamed of his message for every priest and every prayer everything every authority disagreed with him but he recognized when he saw that light the pillar of fire hanging in that bush that spoke to him the word that was promised for that day and said i've called you to go do it he feared not the greatest threats of the king he went down to bring those people to an exodus like the word of god had promised seeing the promise vindicated he made the people ready for their exodus when when he saw the promise when he what was it moses heard the voice of god he speaks of job and he says even job he says misunderstood his trials and he began to misunderstand why am i going through what i'm going through what job didn't see is that wasn't trials it wasn't wasn't it was it wasn't an attack from the it wasn't an attack from god it was the voice of god trying to say something and many times we have we we the voice of god's speaking to us but we don't recognize his voice we don't recognize the voice of god and sometimes he speaks through a trial and you say why is this happening in my life oh it's just the devil oh it's just sometimes it's not sometimes it is sometimes it's god trying to speak god uses the voice of storms sometimes sometimes god uses calamity in our life sometimes a lost job lost wages sometimes a health issue and what is it it's the voice of god trying to speak then paul says refuse not him that speaketh don't refuse it don't misunderstand it because it's not the voice it's not a it's not a it's not for your destruction that voice of god speaking to try to get your attention can you say amen this morning going to close i'm going to close here 11 30. musicians could you come don't want to be lengthy they fall upon stony ground and even the preaching of the word of god even the voice of god through the ministering of the word sometimes people's hearts get cold get hard the word doesn't sink in and every day god's calling even through prayer could play something softly even through prayer the voice of god is speaking and calling and is and and i thought about this even in your prayer closet god wants to speak to you wants to talk to you sometimes wants to point a finger and say hey hey you know that thing right there in your life yeah yeah that that thing it's causing that it's put something between us and the voice of the lord speaking god's saying you got to deal with that you got to make that right you got to change that god's calling out he he says in jeremiah chapter 7 verse 13 i spake unto you rising up early and speaking but you heard not and i called you but you answered not i spoke unto you rising up early and speaking but you heard not i i called to you but you answered not i thought of that and thought lord how many times has your voice been trying to speak to my life and you rosa in the early in the morning god was speaking maybe it wasn't through maybe you didn't hear an audible voice but it was speaking through a problem speaking through a trial speaking through an issue speaking through something that happens in your life and we miss it we wreck it we don't even recognize this goes right over us and god says i spoke and you didn't hear i called you didn't listen you're so busy you're so busy bow your heads with me stand to your feet go ahead and stand by your heads there every head bowed every eye closed i spoke every head bowed every eye closed but you had your own interest your own on things you were doing your life that you were allowing but what it was what was it doing it was choking the word it's choking the word and that word becomes unfruitful [Music] how many can say today [Music] lord i want to hear your voice and when i hear that voice lord i i don't want to refuse it [Music] i don't want to allow other things in life to choke out that word that word that's trying to speak that up-to-date word up to the minute lord i want to hear it i need leadership so in order to lead i gotta i gotta hear a leader can't lead unless he hears from the voice of god say lord i want to lead a family i want to lead a home i want to i want to lead my life correctly so lord i i want to hear your voice i want to hear it clear i don't want it to be crowded out or choked out god bless those hands god bless those hands up everywhere refuse not him that speaketh hearted not your hearts as in the day of provocation they hardened their hearts they wanted to hold on to other things oh moses don't we don't we don't want to hear from god like this we don't well maybe you'll speak to him let a preacher let him let some other individual let it be by proxy oh but but today i got my hands raised i'm saying lord it doesn't need to come through anybody else i want to hear it directly for myself i want to hear directly from from your thoughts from your mind directly to my spirit when i hear it lord i'll obey it i don't want to miss it i don't want to miss it today god you see the hands up everywhere both of my hands are raised lord jesus
