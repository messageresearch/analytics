[42:21] it's been
[42:23] it's been a good week appreciated
[42:25] brother Jonathan's message on Wednesday
[42:28] I was I was as I said I was a bit taken
[42:32] back because he used many of the same
[42:34] scriptures
[42:35] that I'm going to be using this morning
[42:37] he wouldn't
[42:39] he used them in a different way that I'm
[42:41] going to be using them
[42:42] but it gave me confidence
[42:44] to know that we're in the same page
[42:48] We're In The Same Spirit we're moving
[42:49] we're moving in the same direction
[42:52] um we've got there's quite a few
[42:55] birthdays today
[42:57] well this week how many March birthdays
[43:01] are there
[43:03] raise your hands God bless you all
[43:07] sister Rachel Peterson I don't see her
[43:09] anymore I want to embarrass her there
[43:11] she is it's just I want to embarrass you
[43:13] but happy birthday to you too
[43:15] today today is my boy's birthday
[43:18] um he's 21.
[43:20] yeah
[43:25] he's coming in I remember that 21 is a
[43:30] special birthday to me because that's
[43:31] the day
[43:33] on my 21st birthday when I gave my heart
[43:35] to the Lord
[43:37] it was it was late at night I'd gotten
[43:40] home
[43:42] um
[43:44] and I said Lord I don't want this
[43:46] anymore I don't want to be a sinner
[43:48] anymore
[43:49] I want to serve you
[43:52] and from that day I I did my best to
[43:55] hold hold firm to to that
[43:58] commitment to the Lord and and it's held
[44:01] through to this day
[44:03] so the 21st is is special
[44:07] it
[44:09] it's it's a time of passage from from
[44:12] youth to adulthood I remember when I was
[44:15] about that age it's like I I gotta
[44:17] decide
[44:19] what I want to do I want to get married
[44:21] and have kids and a career and and make
[44:25] some very very uh difficult decisions at
[44:27] that age and they're decisions that are
[44:29] going to affect you for the rest of your
[44:30] life
[44:32] as time went on
[44:34] I remember
[44:35] on my 33rd birthday since we're talking
[44:38] about birthdays and my 33rd birthday
[44:42] I was we were living up in ore Valley
[44:43] Stephanie and I and the kids were babies
[44:46] and I got up early in the morning and I
[44:49] was praying
[44:51] and about to go to work and I asked the
[44:54] Lord I said I said Lord
[44:57] 33 years old
[45:00] I'm the same age
[45:04] as Jesus was when he died for all of
[45:07] humanity
[45:09] and as I was there praying I said I said
[45:12] Lord
[45:13] I'm 33 years old and I've never done
[45:15] anything for you
[45:18] and as I was praying
[45:21] the Lord I believe spoke to me
[45:26] and he told me he said move
[45:30] he said move to Jeffersonville Indiana
[45:33] and
[45:35] I I got up and I thought well Lord I
[45:38] don't know how that I'm going to do that
[45:41] but I'm going to do it
[45:43] and I don't want to get into the
[45:46] testimony take me too long but the Lord
[45:47] just paved the way
[45:50] for me to move back east
[45:53] and and thinking about that this morning
[45:55] and thinking about my son's birthday and
[45:57] all these birthdays that are going on
[45:58] and thinking about what the Lord did on
[46:00] that day I thought
[46:03] he spoke to me
[46:06] God
[46:08] in heaven
[46:10] look down at this meaningless human
[46:14] being
[46:15] just as every day guy
[46:19] looked down at me saw me on my knees and
[46:23] he answered my prayer
[46:25] I thought how unworthy
[46:27] that this God that's that's he's he's up
[46:30] in heaven and he's got millions of
[46:33] angels surrounding him
[46:35] and his Holiness that those angels that
[46:37] are so close to him that they have to
[46:39] cover their face and they have to cover
[46:41] their feet with wings just to be in his
[46:44] presence and to think that that holy God
[46:48] looked down and spoke to me
[46:51] who am I
[46:53] who are we that he would humble himself
[46:56] the Mighty God and speak to a human
[46:59] being
[47:01] speak to some young man
[47:04] speak to us
[47:06] how wonderful
[47:08] that he can humble himself just
[47:11] just to talk to us
[47:14] and how we should we should give him
[47:18] more time if he is that willing
[47:22] to speak to us
[47:25] how
[47:26] we should give him more time
[47:30] I remember when
[47:31] when I moved
[47:34] the Lord miraculously gave me a job
[47:38] in Louisville which is right outside of
[47:40] Jeffersonville
[47:41] when I moved
[47:44] things were going good with my new job
[47:48] and it and and I was I was succeeding
[47:51] and I was prospering in everything that
[47:52] I was doing
[47:55] and then once again
[47:57] the Lord laid it on my heart okay now
[48:00] move
[48:02] into the ministry
[48:05] and I was I was about 35 years old then
[48:08] and and I and then the Lord opened up to
[48:11] the for a position for me to have in the
[48:13] ministry
[48:14] they're in Jeffersonville
[48:17] and I remember I went to my boss
[48:20] I I had sent in resumes and and wanting
[48:25] to to to work with the bride of Christ
[48:28] around the world and doing everything
[48:30] that I could and then finally when when
[48:32] I was able to make the transfer and I
[48:35] told my boss
[48:37] I went to him and I said his name is
[48:39] Mark I said Mark
[48:41] I said it's time for me to leave
[48:44] the USGS the government
[48:47] and he said
[48:49] are you nuts
[48:51] those those were his almost his words I
[48:54] left left out one word
[48:55] [Music]
[48:57] but he said are you nuts
[49:00] and and I and I told him I said I said
[49:03] these words I said Mark I said when I
[49:06] get to the end of my road
[49:09] when I get to the end of my life
[49:12] I want to be able to look back
[49:15] and say that I did something
[49:19] I want to I want to be able to look back
[49:20] and see that I accomplished something
[49:23] and studying the environment and and all
[49:26] that it's good but
[49:28] it's all going to perish
[49:31] but if I could accomplish something to
[49:35] lead someone to Christ
[49:38] that's eternal
[49:41] and I I told them that and and he looked
[49:44] at me and he said he says you know he
[49:45] says I know you
[49:47] and he says I could I know you're
[49:49] sincere
[49:51] and he wished me all the best
[49:53] as as I left that and went in and went
[49:57] into the ministry
[49:59] and my point in saying that is what I
[50:01] told them is that I want to be able when
[50:04] I get to the end of this road
[50:07] I want to be able to look back
[50:10] and say Lord I served you
[50:12] Lord I helped someone even if it's just
[50:16] one
[50:17] if you think it could be a child or it
[50:19] could be an adult or whoever it is if I
[50:21] could just say Lord I I accomplish
[50:24] something I didn't spend this whole time
[50:26] of my time on Earth serving myself
[50:30] I did something for someone else
[50:33] and I was
[50:35] as I was pondering on that the past few
[50:38] days
[50:39] I was thinking about all that's going on
[50:42] in the world
[50:45] and we see that
[50:48] there are certain banks that that have
[50:52] collapsed
[50:54] and and it scares people
[50:56] we see that we see the economy and it's
[50:59] just it's just teetering we don't know
[51:02] even The Economist they don't know what
[51:04] tomorrow holds
[51:05] we've spent so much money we've printed
[51:08] so much money that we see the inflation
[51:11] rising and and no one really knows what
[51:15] could happen
[51:16] and I think about the leaders of the
[51:18] country and and the decisions that they
[51:21] are making
[51:22] and I think that when we they get to the
[51:25] end of their roads and they look back
[51:29] and they come before the judge
[51:32] and they look back and what will be
[51:35] their legacy what will they have left in
[51:39] their wake
[51:41] maybe a destroyed country
[51:43] sin
[51:45] in the country and promoting the things
[51:48] that they promote is awful
[51:51] and and just making it okay and actually
[51:54] encouraging the people
[51:57] to to move into sin
[52:00] and when they stand when these
[52:02] politicians and these leaders stand
[52:04] before the Lord
[52:06] will it be like Ahab
[52:09] where it said he where the Bible says
[52:12] that he walked in Wicked Ways
[52:15] and not in the ways of his father David
[52:19] would it be like that
[52:21] or will it be that this was a good man a
[52:26] good woman
[52:27] that accomplish something in their lives
[52:31] thinking about that this week and
[52:33] looking at Sometimes some of these
[52:35] trials that have been going on and these
[52:38] lawsuits and we see that that that they
[52:41] use the courts to further their
[52:44] political agendas today
[52:46] sister Shirley and and I were
[52:49] talking
[52:51] um before church or after church the
[52:53] other day and and talking about this
[52:56] court case that's that's going on with
[52:58] this man
[53:00] this sinner of a man a lawyer that was
[53:04] just convicted of killing his wife and
[53:06] his son
[53:08] and all of the the filth that followed
[53:12] that that man in in this court case and
[53:15] everything that came out and these
[53:17] lawyers on both sides and how they were
[53:19] arguing and and seeing that this is our
[53:22] world that we're living in
[53:24] this filth
[53:26] and so what's his name Alex uh Murdo
[53:30] yeah and and and seeing that and and it
[53:34] brought to remembrance
[53:36] something that a court case that
[53:39] happened about a year ago
[53:42] and
[53:43] it was a young man
[53:47] named
[53:48] his name is Kyle Rittenhouse
[53:51] and this young man he was about my son's
[53:54] age
[53:55] and
[53:57] I was
[53:58] he he got that kind of a big puffed up
[54:02] you know he got a gun and he was kind of
[54:05] the conservative type where the the
[54:08] Second Amendment type where they they
[54:10] they're excited about the guns and and
[54:12] it's it's really important to them to to
[54:15] be able to defend themselves and and
[54:17] have the weapons and and and he got he
[54:20] got into that crowd
[54:23] and he went there was riots going on at
[54:27] that time
[54:28] um
[54:28] in Illinois so he was going to go and he
[54:32] was going to go and protect these
[54:33] businesses
[54:36] so he
[54:38] got involved maybe with the wrong group
[54:41] of people
[54:43] and they weren't doing anything wrong
[54:45] they weren't breaking the law but maybe
[54:47] they got a little bit excited and and he
[54:50] goes and then he got in over his head
[54:53] and this Riot is going through this mob
[54:56] of people and all of a sudden they
[54:58] single him out
[55:00] and he has his his rifle with him
[55:04] and he takes off running and they start
[55:06] chasing him
[55:08] and he he falls to the ground and in
[55:11] self-defense he fires his gun and he
[55:13] kills someone
[55:14] I believe he wounded somebody else
[55:18] so the government takes the the media
[55:21] takes this instance that had happened
[55:25] and they put it in front of the whole
[55:27] country
[55:28] and they are going they are going to
[55:30] crucify this young man
[55:33] because of of the social agenda to get
[55:38] rid of guns which was which was
[55:42] their agenda in doing this
[55:45] so this young man who seemed like a good
[55:48] boy
[55:50] he hadn't done anything wrong he hadn't
[55:52] even broken the law he was defending
[55:54] himself and they made him out to be a
[55:57] horrible person
[55:59] so he he goes into this trial
[56:03] and and the the lawyers are arguing back
[56:07] and forth and they're saying these
[56:08] different things and his lawyer is
[56:10] representing the best that he can and
[56:13] then it comes to the end of the trial
[56:16] and here is this young man he's got five
[56:18] counts against them one of them is
[56:19] murder
[56:22] and here he is in front of the in front
[56:25] of the jury and his lawyers
[56:28] give their closing statements
[56:31] that's the title of my sermon today is
[56:33] closing statements
[56:36] his lawyers give their closing
[56:38] statements for this innocent boy whose
[56:40] life is on the line
[56:44] they did the best that they could
[56:47] these lawyers knowing that this young
[56:49] man was innocent
[56:53] they they gave their their position to
[56:58] the jury and to the judge
[57:00] then the jury goes out and they
[57:04] deliberate
[57:05] over the the case five counts again one
[57:08] of them was murder at least one of them
[57:11] and they bring the jury comes out they
[57:14] reach a decision
[57:17] and the judge they give the decision to
[57:20] the judge the judge has the paper
[57:23] and he says will the defendant rise
[57:26] there that young man was I think of my
[57:29] son
[57:30] with his life on the line
[57:33] standing up by himself
[57:36] in this courtroom
[57:38] and he's standing there
[57:41] and I put myself I don't know why but I
[57:44] somehow I put myself in the position of
[57:48] this defense attorney
[57:50] and that defense attorney is he is
[57:53] sitting there with his notes in front of
[57:55] him and the young man that he
[57:57] represented who he knew was innocent and
[58:00] he's he's there and he's saying William
[58:02] what must have been going through this
[58:04] man's mind
[58:07] he's innocent and all this jury's
[58:11] decision was based on what he said
[58:14] how important were those closing
[58:16] arguments those closing statements of
[58:19] this of this lawyer
[58:23] the young man standing there the lawyer
[58:25] sitting in his his chair and he must
[58:27] have been going through his mind I hope
[58:29] I said it right I hope I presented this
[58:33] right this young man could go to prison
[58:35] because I made a mistake
[58:37] because I didn't do things right
[58:40] he's standing there the judge
[58:44] with
[58:47] the decision
[58:49] and he says on count one
[58:52] I believe the juror read it not guilty
[58:57] on count number two
[59:00] not guilty
[59:02] three four five
[59:05] not guilty not guilty not guilty the
[59:08] young man started shaking he started
[59:10] crying he just collapsed at the last the
[59:12] last verdict
[59:14] Justice was done that day
[59:19] but how much
[59:21] was on that lawyer's closing statements
[59:28] and as I thought about that
[59:31] over the time
[59:33] I thought all of us are in that same
[59:37] position as those lawyers were
[59:41] and how
[59:42] we are presenting Jesus Christ before
[59:47] the world
[59:49] and it is up to us to present this man
[59:54] that died for our sins in the right way
[59:57] and how much is how much is writing on
[1:00:00] what we say and how we say it
[1:00:03] and I was thinking of
[1:00:05] of all of these great Servants of the
[1:00:08] Lord
[1:00:09] Through Time
[1:00:11] that their Ministry built and built and
[1:00:14] built until they had their final closing
[1:00:18] statements
[1:00:20] and I read
[1:00:21] from the Apostle Peter
[1:00:24] in his closing statement his last letter
[1:00:27] that he read
[1:00:29] Before Peter went to the cross
[1:00:34] to be to be crucified upside down
[1:00:38] and
[1:00:39] how much he must have put into that
[1:00:42] letter
[1:00:43] I look at look at John the Baptist
[1:00:46] and John the Baptist he was he was he's
[1:00:48] born and he went into the Wilderness and
[1:00:51] everything that was about John his whole
[1:00:54] life was building for this closing time
[1:00:58] that he had
[1:00:59] John just had a little bit of time
[1:01:03] he came on the scene he started
[1:01:05] preaching the gospel he started getting
[1:01:08] a following
[1:01:09] people started listening to him people
[1:01:11] started watching him this man is
[1:01:13] different
[1:01:14] he's different than the others that
[1:01:16] we've heard
[1:01:18] following him he he got his disciples
[1:01:21] John did
[1:01:23] and
[1:01:25] he's he's talking about and he started
[1:01:27] talking about the Messiah
[1:01:30] and he started talking about my job is
[1:01:32] to introduce this Messiah not be the
[1:01:36] Messiah
[1:01:37] they thought that he was the Messiah
[1:01:39] many of them did
[1:01:40] but his job was very plainly he said no
[1:01:43] my job is to introduce him I'm not
[1:01:46] worthy to untie his shoes
[1:01:49] that's how great that this man that's
[1:01:51] coming is
[1:01:53] then one day
[1:01:55] John on the Jordan River
[1:01:58] is baptizing them baptizing people he
[1:02:01] had many disciples probably far more
[1:02:03] than even this in this room
[1:02:06] but there were two
[1:02:08] two disciples that John had
[1:02:11] that were were very special that God
[1:02:15] would use from John's closing statements
[1:02:18] that God would use these two men to
[1:02:20] change the world
[1:02:22] those two men their names were Andrew
[1:02:26] and John
[1:02:30] John the Baptist is baptizing and he
[1:02:32] sees this man walking up to the water
[1:02:37] and he said behold
[1:02:38] the Lamb of God
[1:02:40] I got maybe we should read that
[1:02:42] scripture I think it's worth reading
[1:02:51] let's see
[1:02:53] John chapter 1 verse 36.
[1:02:59] John the Baptist speaking and looking
[1:03:01] Upon Jesus as he walked he saith Behold
[1:03:04] the Lamb of God
[1:03:07] and the two disciples
[1:03:10] heard him speak
[1:03:13] and they followed Jesus
[1:03:17] they did what the prophet said here is
[1:03:20] here is John the Baptist in his closing
[1:03:22] statements he said Behold the Lamb of
[1:03:24] God
[1:03:26] and there's John and Andrew we love you
[1:03:29] John
[1:03:30] we believe you're a prophet
[1:03:33] we're going to follow him because that's
[1:03:35] what John said
[1:03:38] how many people stayed with John the
[1:03:40] Baptist
[1:03:42] as I said you know we probably have 100
[1:03:44] people in the congregation today how
[1:03:46] many if there was that many with him it
[1:03:49] was two
[1:03:51] just two we know for sure that went and
[1:03:55] did what he said a very small portion of
[1:03:58] the people
[1:04:00] so then John continues on
[1:04:05] and he continues on preaching his
[1:04:06] message and his gospel
[1:04:10] and
[1:04:11] he's baptizing
[1:04:14] people
[1:04:16] and his disciples come up to him and
[1:04:18] they're like hey John you remember that
[1:04:20] guy in the river
[1:04:23] John was probably like yeah the one that
[1:04:25] the spirit of the Lord descended upon
[1:04:26] and rested upon him and I said Behold
[1:04:28] the Lamb of God and then he went into
[1:04:30] the yeah that guy yeah him
[1:04:36] they're baptizing more people than us
[1:04:39] ah
[1:04:40] you didn't get it
[1:04:43] they're baptizing more than we are John
[1:04:45] says listen listen to John's closing
[1:04:48] statements
[1:04:50] John says he must increase
[1:04:56] I must decrease
[1:04:59] the testimony of every Christian of
[1:05:03] every minister of every pastor of every
[1:05:06] of every priest whoever it is I must
[1:05:09] decrease
[1:05:11] he must increase
[1:05:14] and that is the goal for all of us
[1:05:17] if if I could point to Christ and say
[1:05:21] lift him up and you come to him you get
[1:05:24] to him he'll never fail you
[1:05:26] I will fail you I need to decrease
[1:05:31] Jesus said the greatest man
[1:05:35] born of a woman was John the Baptist
[1:05:40] he had the first converts to Christ
[1:05:44] no wonder he was so great
[1:05:47] can you imagine the honor of all the
[1:05:49] thousands of years that the Bible has
[1:05:51] written you had the honor to have the
[1:05:54] first converts
[1:05:56] to Christ oh I would love to have that
[1:06:00] so no wonder he was the greatest
[1:06:03] and then John the Baptist steps back
[1:06:06] Jesus goes on
[1:06:09] John's time was over
[1:06:12] and he was condemned to death
[1:06:15] killed
[1:06:17] but he left his closing statements with
[1:06:20] us
[1:06:22] in here
[1:06:24] and they are recorded
[1:06:27] saying that he is the one
[1:06:31] I am not the one but he is the one
[1:06:34] follow him
[1:06:37] and God bless those disciples that
[1:06:40] actually did what he said
[1:06:43] in his closing statements
[1:06:47] I want to get into
[1:06:50] another great servant of God that never
[1:06:53] knew the Lord Jesus in his in his flesh
[1:06:57] when he came until he was 33 years old
[1:07:00] the Apostle Paul didn't know him
[1:07:03] but he knew him in his resurrected power
[1:07:08] and the Apostle Paul a great man of God
[1:07:14] how many people we look at John the
[1:07:16] Baptist and how many converts he had he
[1:07:18] probably had more than two
[1:07:20] but we look at Paul Paul took John's
[1:07:24] message
[1:07:26] of the Messiah and he took it to the
[1:07:29] word and had thousands of converts
[1:07:33] set up churches and it all over
[1:07:37] the place in in Asia Minor in Europe and
[1:07:40] and in that and was
[1:07:42] preaching the gospel with power and
[1:07:46] demonstration the same as Jesus preached
[1:07:49] it
[1:07:50] Paul took that message
[1:07:53] and he set himself aside
[1:07:56] and he preached Christ and lifted up
[1:07:59] Christ
[1:08:00] the accomplishments of that man Paul are
[1:08:04] almost without measure
[1:08:07] taking two-thirds probably two-thirds of
[1:08:10] the New Testament
[1:08:11] is Paul's writings
[1:08:14] this great man
[1:08:17] and then Paul as with John the Baptist
[1:08:20] as with Jesus as with Peter as with all
[1:08:24] of these men of God Paul
[1:08:27] comes to the end of his ministry
[1:08:32] and there was one young man
[1:08:37] that Paul was speaking to
[1:08:41] and Paul had
[1:08:43] like I said with these lawyers he just
[1:08:46] had a small amount of time
[1:08:49] Lord getting let me get this right
[1:08:52] because there is so much resting on what
[1:08:56] I say
[1:08:58] Paul
[1:09:01] has this young man named Timothy
[1:09:05] and he writes Timothy a second letter we
[1:09:09] call it second Timothy
[1:09:11] these are Paul's closing statements for
[1:09:16] his ministry
[1:09:18] and and listen to what our brother says
[1:09:22] about
[1:09:25] how
[1:09:27] a Christian
[1:09:29] should be and if you want to read a a
[1:09:32] book in the Bible
[1:09:35] that shows us genuine Christianity
[1:09:39] turn to Second Timothy I'll tell you
[1:09:41] what
[1:09:42] he goes through it all
[1:09:45] and you even see the prophetic gift
[1:09:49] of the Apostle Paul in second Timothy
[1:09:51] let's turn to Second Timothy we'll start
[1:09:56] with verse 1 chapter 1.
[1:09:59] Paul
[1:10:01] an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will
[1:10:03] of God according to the promise of life
[1:10:05] which is in Christ Jesus
[1:10:09] to Timothy my dearly beloved Son
[1:10:12] it's his son in the gospel
[1:10:15] grace mercy and peace from God the
[1:10:18] father and Christ Jesus our lord
[1:10:21] I thank God whom I serve for my
[1:10:23] forefathers
[1:10:25] with pure conscience that without
[1:10:27] ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my
[1:10:30] prayers night and day
[1:10:32] greatly Desiring to see thee being
[1:10:36] mindful of thy tears that I may be
[1:10:39] filled with joy
[1:10:41] when I called the remembrance the
[1:10:44] unfeigned faith that is in thee which
[1:10:47] dealt dwelt first
[1:10:50] and thy grandmother Lois
[1:10:53] and thy mother Eunice
[1:10:56] I am persuaded that in the also
[1:11:01] look at these two sisters
[1:11:04] we think about closing statements and we
[1:11:06] think about Lord have I made an impact
[1:11:09] and how in raising children how
[1:11:12] important it is that we teach them
[1:11:14] correctly
[1:11:16] and we look at Lois and Eunice and what
[1:11:20] they did in raising this young man
[1:11:24] and him seeing their example
[1:11:27] and them reading the scriptures and
[1:11:30] teaching this Timothy as he was growing
[1:11:33] up
[1:11:35] in Lois
[1:11:36] probably teaching Eunice and then Eunice
[1:11:39] teaching Timothy
[1:11:41] how important is it for us as parents
[1:11:45] to teach these kids right
[1:11:48] to show them how important this Bible is
[1:11:51] how important that the things that are
[1:11:54] written in here to apply to our lives
[1:11:58] so much is at stake
[1:12:01] and Lois and Eunice they were up to the
[1:12:04] task
[1:12:05] they didn't waste any time
[1:12:08] they had Bible reading at night
[1:12:11] they had prayer in their family
[1:12:15] and look what it produced
[1:12:17] It produced a minister
[1:12:20] that's recorded in this Bible
[1:12:22] as being a very special man
[1:12:26] all of us have that same opportunity as
[1:12:30] Lois and Eunice did
[1:12:32] and if you're all breathing right now
[1:12:35] which it looks like you all are
[1:12:37] there's still time
[1:12:39] don't ever say well I didn't do it I I I
[1:12:43] failed that
[1:12:46] if there's breath in your lungs and your
[1:12:48] heart's beating
[1:12:49] then there is time
[1:12:52] there is time to serve God there's time
[1:12:54] to make an impact
[1:13:00] let's skip to verse 12 for time's sake
[1:13:04] for the which cause
[1:13:07] uh let's let's go to verse 11. yeah good
[1:13:10] weren't I weren't too I'm appointed a
[1:13:13] preacher and an apostle and a teacher of
[1:13:16] the Gentiles
[1:13:17] for the which cause I suffer these
[1:13:21] things nevertheless I am not ashamed
[1:13:24] ah
[1:13:26] Timothy listen I'm not ashamed of what
[1:13:29] I'm telling you I may be Paul is writing
[1:13:31] this letter from prison
[1:13:33] and he's condemned to death
[1:13:36] and as he was on trial which which if I
[1:13:38] if time allows I'll read it but as he
[1:13:41] was on trial
[1:13:43] people left him
[1:13:44] they were embarrassed of him
[1:13:48] and yet Paul stood alone
[1:13:50] but he never wavered for the which cause
[1:13:53] I also suffer these things nevertheless
[1:13:55] I am not ashamed
[1:13:57] for I know whom I have believed
[1:14:02] brother Wilson who is that man that he
[1:14:04] believed
[1:14:06] the Lord Jesus Christ bro I know who I
[1:14:09] believed
[1:14:11] and am persuaded that he is able to keep
[1:14:15] that which I have committed unto him
[1:14:18] against that day
[1:14:20] I am persuaded that he is able
[1:14:26] we pray so often and and we're worried
[1:14:30] we worry so much
[1:14:33] we think that
[1:14:35] that these problems
[1:14:38] that that we see in the world maybe
[1:14:40] we're going to suffer for them or it
[1:14:42] might be a sickness that's that's upon
[1:14:45] us or it might be a wayward family
[1:14:48] member or it might be sin it might be
[1:14:50] something that we've done but ask that
[1:14:53] question is Jesus able
[1:14:58] is he able is he able to heal the sick
[1:15:01] is he able to forgive my sins that's the
[1:15:04] question is he able not will he
[1:15:09] but is he able
[1:15:11] Paul says I'm persuaded that he is able
[1:15:17] then in second Timothy chapter 2.
[1:15:22] start with verse 7.
[1:15:26] consider what I say
[1:15:28] and the Lord give the understanding in
[1:15:30] all things remember that Jesus Christ of
[1:15:33] the seed of David was raid raised from
[1:15:35] the dead according to my gospel
[1:15:38] he says remember what I've preached to
[1:15:40] you
[1:15:41] Jesus was raised from the dead that's my
[1:15:44] message
[1:15:45] remember that
[1:15:49] where and I suffer trouble trouble as an
[1:15:51] evil doer and here he is
[1:15:54] Paul is condemned to death
[1:15:57] and he's saying I just had this trial
[1:16:00] where and I suffer trouble as an evil
[1:16:02] evil doer even under bonds but the word
[1:16:05] of God is not bound
[1:16:08] therefore I Endure all things for the
[1:16:11] elect's sake that they may also obtain
[1:16:14] the Salvation which is in Christ Jesus
[1:16:16] Jesus with eternal glory I'll go through
[1:16:20] these things I'll suffer these things so
[1:16:23] that someone might receive Christ that's
[1:16:26] the most important part of life
[1:16:29] is that someone would
[1:16:32] receive Christ with eternal glory
[1:16:35] it is a faithful saying
[1:16:38] for if we be dead with him
[1:16:41] we shall also live with him
[1:16:47] Christianity
[1:16:49] is not an easy walk
[1:16:53] but in the world today
[1:16:55] we want easy
[1:16:58] you know
[1:16:59] there's there's no sacrifice
[1:17:02] and very little sacrifice we want our
[1:17:05] own desires
[1:17:08] and
[1:17:10] we can't so often we can't even get
[1:17:13] along with our own families
[1:17:16] we can't even get along with our
[1:17:18] co-workers
[1:17:20] and yet we claim to be Christians
[1:17:26] a Christian walk is not an easy walk it
[1:17:29] is a walk of sacrifice
[1:17:32] just because somebody's getting more
[1:17:35] than you or more than me and I want to
[1:17:37] get up and fight how is that
[1:17:40] Christianity
[1:17:42] Christ died
[1:17:44] Christ died for sinners
[1:17:47] and if we have the spirit of Christ
[1:17:50] are we not willing to do the same are we
[1:17:52] not willing to give up a little bit of
[1:17:55] our rights
[1:17:56] Something That We're entitled to
[1:17:59] you know and it's
[1:18:01] we've witnessed the people
[1:18:04] and and we're trying to get them maybe
[1:18:07] to believe like us
[1:18:10] and if they will just accept the message
[1:18:13] and come to my church then I'll serve
[1:18:17] them
[1:18:20] no
[1:18:22] if they will come to Christ
[1:18:26] and I'm going to serve them anyways
[1:18:30] Jesus came he preached things that just
[1:18:32] didn't make sense serve your enemy yes
[1:18:35] that person that hates you yes
[1:18:39] that family member that insults you yes
[1:18:43] serve them be a Christian and then
[1:18:48] you'll find you'll win that person
[1:18:56] even
[1:18:58] all the way to our neighbors
[1:19:01] you know I talk about I talk about
[1:19:02] driving in the car
[1:19:04] because
[1:19:06] that's a weakness that I have
[1:19:09] you know
[1:19:12] is that right though
[1:19:15] it's wrong to sin no matter if you're in
[1:19:18] your car or you're talking to your
[1:19:19] neighbor
[1:19:21] and your neighbors
[1:19:23] throwing stuff into your yard or or
[1:19:26] trying to um
[1:19:29] whatever neighbors do that's sinful
[1:19:34] but we need to be Christians that we
[1:19:37] might win that person
[1:19:39] you know there's so much more even all
[1:19:43] the way to giving to our tithes
[1:19:47] what are we supposed to do with our ties
[1:19:49] well I don't have quite enough this
[1:19:51] month so
[1:19:52] um I'll guess the Lord's gonna have to
[1:19:54] wait
[1:19:57] we put God first
[1:20:00] in all things
[1:20:02] whether it be our Tides or whether it be
[1:20:05] our feelings or whether it be our
[1:20:07] desires or whatever it is Christian Life
[1:20:10] is a life of sacrifice
[1:20:13] let's skip to verse 16.
[1:20:16] but son profane and vain babblings for
[1:20:18] they will increase unto more ungodliness
[1:20:22] watch our speech
[1:20:24] don't be irreverent
[1:20:26] the Amplified
[1:20:28] version of that scripture says this but
[1:20:32] avoid all irre irreverent Babel and
[1:20:36] Godless chatter with its profane empty
[1:20:38] words for it will lead to further
[1:20:41] ungodliness
[1:20:44] and their word will eat as doth a canker
[1:20:46] of whom hymenius and felitus
[1:20:50] who concerning the truth have aired
[1:20:52] saying that the resurrection has passed
[1:20:54] already and overthrow the faith of some
[1:20:58] look how important the speech was of
[1:21:02] these two brothers they were brothers
[1:21:06] there were people from the church they
[1:21:08] were talking about the resurrection they
[1:21:09] were talking about religious things they
[1:21:10] weren't talking about
[1:21:14] March Madness
[1:21:16] they weren't talking about the next
[1:21:19] basketball game they were talking about
[1:21:21] things of God
[1:21:24] and
[1:21:26] they're saying that oh the the
[1:21:28] resurrection is passed and then they
[1:21:31] they start saying these doctrines
[1:21:34] over and over again
[1:21:37] and then as they say these these these
[1:21:41] doctrines then it becomes the word
[1:21:46] the more you hear it
[1:21:49] the more it becomes the truth
[1:21:53] and then these doctrines get entrenched
[1:21:58] let me read a let me read a quote
[1:22:01] from the book an exposition of the
[1:22:03] seventh Church age of the seven Church
[1:22:05] ages
[1:22:07] says this
[1:22:11] but see
[1:22:13] yes but see what was happening back
[1:22:16] there that false Vine was getting a hold
[1:22:19] and it was teaching that rulership by
[1:22:21] man was right
[1:22:23] it taught that the church had to be
[1:22:25] governed it taught that control over the
[1:22:29] people but instead of doing it God's way
[1:22:31] they simply took Authority invested all
[1:22:34] the spiritual power in their own hands
[1:22:37] and came out with a holy priesthood
[1:22:39] standing between God and the people
[1:22:42] they went right back to the old aeronic
[1:22:45] system they went right back to Aaron and
[1:22:50] his sons and the high priest and all
[1:22:52] that when Christ that veil was torn open
[1:22:54] and now Christ can come into the person
[1:22:59] that time
[1:23:01] stayed God's Wrath until the Holy Spirit
[1:23:04] could fall
[1:23:07] they became Antichrist
[1:23:09] for they disposed of his mediatorship
[1:23:12] and imposed their own
[1:23:15] God hated that
[1:23:17] the Ephesians hated that and any True
[1:23:19] Believer will hate it too
[1:23:21] we would have to be Stone blind not to
[1:23:25] see that same thing at work All Through
[1:23:29] the Ages and right now it is the worst
[1:23:31] of all
[1:23:33] what it was is an organization that
[1:23:35] separated the people
[1:23:37] God's people are supposed to be won by
[1:23:40] one Spirit they are all baptized into
[1:23:42] the body and everyone is to be moved
[1:23:45] upon by the Holy Ghost and everyone is
[1:23:47] to participate in the worship of God
[1:23:50] when we start drawing circles and
[1:23:52] separating ourselves when we start
[1:23:54] cutting each other out because maybe you
[1:23:56] don't believe it like me
[1:23:59] we could fall into this exactly what the
[1:24:03] author is what brother Brandon is saying
[1:24:04] here but men wanted the preeminence so
[1:24:07] they took over control and Bishops
[1:24:09] became archbishops and with imposing
[1:24:11] titles they bypassed the word of God and
[1:24:14] taught their own doctrines they got the
[1:24:16] people to obey them
[1:24:18] until the time came that their way of
[1:24:21] worship did not in any way at all
[1:24:24] resemble the early days after Pentecost
[1:24:28] that's a statement
[1:24:32] from Apostolic succession it was one
[1:24:35] easy and quick step to church membership
[1:24:37] as the means of Saving Grace the word
[1:24:40] was reduced to a Creed Antichrist by his
[1:24:45] Spirit was predominating the church
[1:24:53] a a look at the the way that the world
[1:24:56] is going the way that our Brethren have
[1:24:59] gone
[1:25:01] sometimes the way that we do church
[1:25:03] sometimes the way that we have become
[1:25:05] does it even resemble
[1:25:07] what was in the book of Acts
[1:25:10] in this separation we have and drawing
[1:25:13] these circles smaller and saying we're
[1:25:14] the elite we're the special ones
[1:25:18] how does that line up
[1:25:20] with the apostolic Doctrine
[1:25:23] how does that line up in reaching out to
[1:25:26] people I don't care how they look
[1:25:29] reach out to them
[1:25:31] don't make them like me or make them
[1:25:35] like you
[1:25:36] make them like Christ
[1:25:41] I
[1:25:44] I don't have
[1:25:46] let's let's let's skip to Second Timothy
[1:25:48] chapter three
[1:25:53] this know also
[1:25:56] remember these are Paul's closing
[1:25:58] statements
[1:26:00] he's about to die
[1:26:02] he's about to go to the guillotine and
[1:26:05] he knows it
[1:26:06] this also know that in the last days
[1:26:08] perilous time shall come
[1:26:12] and he's saying that my son Timothy when
[1:26:14] you see these things happen
[1:26:17] no that the end is near
[1:26:21] for men should be lovers of their own
[1:26:22] selves
[1:26:24] Covetous boasters proud blasphemers
[1:26:27] disobedient into parents unthankful
[1:26:30] Unholy without natural affection true
[1:26:33] spirituals false accusers incontinence
[1:26:35] Fierce despisers of those that are good
[1:26:39] Traders Eddie high-minded lovers of
[1:26:41] pleasure more than lovers of God
[1:26:44] we're like oh yeah that's that's
[1:26:46] everywhere it wasn't back then
[1:26:50] he's telling Timothy my son listen when
[1:26:54] you see these things come to pass when
[1:26:56] you see this ungodliness around you
[1:27:01] know that this is the last days it's so
[1:27:04] common to us as that quote I just read
[1:27:06] over and over and over we just hear it
[1:27:09] over and over and over and it becomes
[1:27:10] not a big deal
[1:27:12] we just walk outside the church and we
[1:27:14] see all the drug addiction
[1:27:15] we see all the prostitution we see we
[1:27:17] see the filth that's around us all it's
[1:27:19] just it's just what it is
[1:27:22] we look and we see people constantly
[1:27:24] promoting themselves as I said before
[1:27:27] setting up a shrine
[1:27:29] to themselves
[1:27:30] online
[1:27:32] called Facebook and Instagram and all
[1:27:34] and all of this and and lifting
[1:27:36] themselves up it was never the case
[1:27:40] but now it is
[1:27:42] and the Apostle is saying when you see
[1:27:44] this
[1:27:46] having a form of godliness but denying
[1:27:49] the power thereof from such turn away
[1:27:52] they have an outward religion
[1:27:55] they might profess Christianity
[1:27:58] but their very lives deny the power of
[1:28:01] God
[1:28:02] if they truly believed God being the
[1:28:06] righteous judge would they live the
[1:28:08] sinful lives that they're living
[1:28:11] denying the power thereof denying that
[1:28:15] God's promises are true with their very
[1:28:18] lives denying it
[1:28:20] but they lie
[1:28:23] but they gossip about each other
[1:28:27] denying God saying well yeah I know you
[1:28:29] said it
[1:28:31] but I'm going to deny that not with my
[1:28:35] mouth but through my actions
[1:28:38] verse number 10.
[1:28:40] but thou has fully known my Doctrine
[1:28:43] manner of life
[1:28:45] purpose faith
[1:28:47] long-suffering charity patience Timothy
[1:28:51] you've seen the way I lived
[1:28:54] you've seen that I really believe what
[1:28:56] I'm preaching
[1:28:58] stand strong with this these are my
[1:29:01] closing statements Timothy hold strong
[1:29:04] I'm about to go to my death
[1:29:08] then received similar statements to all
[1:29:11] the disciples
[1:29:14] and yet
[1:29:16] we honor this book we read it we say
[1:29:21] it's absolute truth but then we're not
[1:29:23] willing to do it
[1:29:25] we're not willing to to make a step and
[1:29:28] actually live a life I'm not talking
[1:29:30] about pointing our fingers at everybody
[1:29:31] else
[1:29:32] I'm talking about this guy
[1:29:34] am I really willing to sacrifice my life
[1:29:38] for this not give it lip service I've
[1:29:42] used the illustration before
[1:29:44] it's your birthday so I'll pick on you
[1:29:45] Daniel
[1:29:46] of
[1:29:48] of my son
[1:29:49] and cleaning his room
[1:29:57] Daniel
[1:29:59] clean your room
[1:30:01] okay Dad
[1:30:03] next day
[1:30:05] room's still dirty
[1:30:07] dad imagine if Daniel said this and this
[1:30:09] is our attitude dad I love the way that
[1:30:13] you said that last night
[1:30:15] Daniel clean your room
[1:30:17] he dad that was just that was so great
[1:30:20] it was so inspired oh it was just it was
[1:30:23] such a blessing it was so authoritative
[1:30:24] dad it was so good oh it was so deep wow
[1:30:28] Daniel clean your room and it was so
[1:30:30] admit so much you know and there's so
[1:30:32] there's so many different things Dad I'm
[1:30:34] gonna learn it in Greek
[1:30:36] it was just it was great
[1:30:40] Daniel clean your room
[1:30:43] and the room is messy
[1:30:47] and that's our attitude towards this
[1:30:50] gospel
[1:30:52] it says it here
[1:30:54] so why do we not do it
[1:30:58] Paul is laying out this
[1:31:02] to his his Apprentice Timothy
[1:31:05] verse number 13.
[1:31:07] but evil men and seducers shall wax
[1:31:09] worse and worse deceiving and being
[1:31:12] deceived but continue thou in the things
[1:31:14] which thou Hast learn and has been
[1:31:17] assured of knowing of whom thou has to
[1:31:20] learn them
[1:31:22] you learn this from me
[1:31:25] is what Paul is saying have I not proven
[1:31:30] have I not proven to you to be a servant
[1:31:32] of the Lord
[1:31:33] and who have we learned from
[1:31:37] and look at the examples that we have
[1:31:39] as a congregation and look at how much
[1:31:42] this means to us this message
[1:31:46] of the Gospel of the end time
[1:31:49] and I hear
[1:31:53] well I'll skip that part
[1:31:57] um verse number 15.
[1:32:01] and that from a child thou Hast known
[1:32:03] the holy scriptures
[1:32:05] remember Paul is here speaking to
[1:32:06] Timothy which are able to make thee wise
[1:32:09] unto salvation through faith which is in
[1:32:12] Christ Jesus
[1:32:13] remember his mama Loa of Eunice
[1:32:18] and his Grandma Lois
[1:32:20] you know these things because somebody
[1:32:22] took the time to teach you
[1:32:25] all scripture is given
[1:32:29] by inspiration of God and is profitable
[1:32:31] for Doctrine for reproof for correction
[1:32:33] for instruction in righteousness don't
[1:32:36] just teach your kids Malachi chapter 4
[1:32:39] and Revelation chapter 10 and Luke
[1:32:42] chapter 17.
[1:32:45] teach them the whole book
[1:32:48] all of it is important if we're just
[1:32:51] teaching certain scriptures that match
[1:32:53] our doctrines
[1:32:55] then we are failing our people we're
[1:32:58] failing our our children we're failing
[1:33:00] as ministers We are failing just because
[1:33:04] somebody said that you can't understand
[1:33:07] it
[1:33:09] if you don't have a prophet teaching you
[1:33:12] that is not what this word says this
[1:33:15] word says right here all scripture is
[1:33:18] given by inspiration of God and is
[1:33:21] profitable for Doctrine
[1:33:23] all of this book
[1:33:26] it's it's all a blessing every word
[1:33:28] that's in it is inspired
[1:33:31] for a proof for correction for
[1:33:34] instruction and righteousness that the
[1:33:36] man of God may be perfect thoroughly
[1:33:38] furnished unto all good works
[1:33:41] another translation the English Standard
[1:33:43] Version says that the man of God may be
[1:33:45] competent equipped for every good work
[1:33:50] now Paul's closing statements second
[1:33:53] Timothy chapter four
[1:33:56] as he was writing this letter to Timothy
[1:33:59] a Wonder
[1:34:01] if his hand was shaking
[1:34:04] I wonder what was going through this
[1:34:06] man's mind as he's closing this letter
[1:34:10] knowing that he is about he's in prison
[1:34:13] knowing that maybe right outside of a
[1:34:15] cell room was the block that he would
[1:34:17] lay his head on
[1:34:19] and the execution would come
[1:34:23] and kill him
[1:34:25] imagine this man
[1:34:29] these closing statements from this
[1:34:32] representative just as as I was talking
[1:34:34] about the young man and and his lawyers
[1:34:37] how important how much more important
[1:34:39] are caught our Paul's words because this
[1:34:42] is eternal life
[1:34:44] this isn't 20 to 40 years in prison
[1:34:50] this is eternity
[1:34:53] Paul says this
[1:34:58] I charge thee therefore before God
[1:35:01] and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall
[1:35:03] judge the quick and the dead and his
[1:35:05] appearing in his kingdom I charge you
[1:35:08] Timothy
[1:35:09] this is important
[1:35:11] preach the word
[1:35:14] be instant in season out of season
[1:35:16] always be ready
[1:35:19] reprove rebuke exhort with all
[1:35:22] long-suffering and Doctrine
[1:35:25] for the time will come
[1:35:28] when they will not endure sound Doctrine
[1:35:31] but after their own lusts
[1:35:34] shall they Heap to themselves teachers
[1:35:36] having itching ears
[1:35:41] Amplified version of that says for the
[1:35:43] time will come when people will not
[1:35:45] tolerate sound Doctrine
[1:35:47] an accurate instruction that challenges
[1:35:50] them with God's truth but wanting to
[1:35:52] have their own ears tickled with
[1:35:54] something pleasing they will accumulate
[1:35:56] for themselves teachers to satisfy their
[1:35:59] own desires and to support the errors
[1:36:01] that they hold
[1:36:03] the people require
[1:36:05] a pastor
[1:36:07] or a minister to preach certain
[1:36:11] doctrines
[1:36:12] that is what this scripture is saying
[1:36:16] it's about a weak pulpit and a
[1:36:19] congregation that is requiring us to say
[1:36:23] certain things or we don't want that
[1:36:26] you know what that doesn't feel right
[1:36:28] pastor
[1:36:29] that doesn't feel right minister
[1:36:33] Heap for themselves teachers
[1:36:35] they accumulate these teachers for
[1:36:38] themselves and then all of a sudden
[1:36:40] we're all saying the same thing
[1:36:43] and who knows if it's right or not
[1:36:45] because it's not God saying it
[1:36:48] they shall heed for themselves teachers
[1:36:53] you know something that
[1:36:56] after service oh brother Daniel that was
[1:36:58] such an inspired message
[1:37:00] made me feel so good I was so
[1:37:03] encouraging
[1:37:04] I just I just really love that continue
[1:37:06] to say that by the way it helps me I
[1:37:08] know
[1:37:10] but that
[1:37:13] maybe telling you something that makes
[1:37:15] you feel good but doesn't do any good
[1:37:19] that doesn't help you in this life
[1:37:24] Jesus said straight is the gate
[1:37:28] and narrow is the way
[1:37:32] and few there will be that find it look
[1:37:37] at our congregation today if Jesus
[1:37:39] Christ was standing here
[1:37:42] straight As the gate and narrow his way
[1:37:44] and few are going to find this
[1:37:49] straighten up
[1:37:52] Jesus was telling us
[1:37:55] that there are going to be very few in
[1:37:57] Matthew chapter 7. verse 22.
[1:38:01] the Lord Jesus says this many will say
[1:38:03] in that day Lord Lord have we not
[1:38:05] prophesied in thy name
[1:38:07] and then thy name cast out devils and in
[1:38:11] thy name done my wonderful works
[1:38:13] he's talking to Jesus whoever's saying
[1:38:16] this what name is he talking about Jesus
[1:38:19] have we not in your name done these
[1:38:21] things
[1:38:22] then I will profess the Lord Jesus
[1:38:25] talking I will profess unto them I never
[1:38:27] knew you
[1:38:28] depart from me you that work iniquity
[1:38:37] you know it's like
[1:38:38] bro Daniel now are you going to do like
[1:38:41] all the other preachers you're going to
[1:38:42] tell us we shouldn't be we shouldn't be
[1:38:44] spending so much time until watching
[1:38:45] television we we shouldn't the the women
[1:38:48] shouldn't be wearing makeup and and we
[1:38:50] shouldn't be going to movies and we
[1:38:52] shouldn't be doing all this
[1:38:52] entertainment no I'm not going to say
[1:38:54] that what I'm going to say
[1:38:57] is we're not spending enough time in
[1:38:59] prayer
[1:39:02] our precious time
[1:39:04] then there's only a each one of us is
[1:39:07] just allotted on a certain amount of
[1:39:08] time it's not spent in the right ways
[1:39:12] that's great you know that God sent a
[1:39:15] prophet nice the Devils know it too
[1:39:21] you know what's
[1:39:22] popular
[1:39:25] is and I'm not talking about Catholics
[1:39:28] and and Methodist and Baptists and all
[1:39:30] the different denominations I'm talking
[1:39:32] about us
[1:39:36] I'm talking about these closing
[1:39:39] statements
[1:39:41] that these Servants of the Lord said
[1:39:45] verse number four
[1:39:48] Timothy listen
[1:39:51] and they shall turn their away their
[1:39:53] ears from the truth
[1:39:55] and shall be turned into fables but
[1:39:57] watch in all things endure afflictions
[1:40:00] do the work of evangelists make full
[1:40:02] proof of thy Ministry
[1:40:05] Timothy was not a prophet
[1:40:07] Timothy was not
[1:40:10] an angel messenger
[1:40:12] Timothy was a man
[1:40:15] he was just like me just like you he was
[1:40:19] a human being and he said yet Timothy
[1:40:23] make full proof of your ministry fulfill
[1:40:25] the duties of your ministry do this work
[1:40:29] that this Bible commands you to do
[1:40:33] we when you know when you when you have
[1:40:37] somebody come stay with you and you know
[1:40:39] that they're going to be there in like
[1:40:40] three weeks
[1:40:41] family or whatever it is
[1:40:43] then you start working on the house
[1:40:45] and it's like okay I gotta get that I
[1:40:47] got to get the picture hung here and I
[1:40:48] got to get the I gotta get the new linen
[1:40:50] for the beds and we got to paint this
[1:40:52] room we got to do all this
[1:40:55] and you do it just because that you have
[1:40:59] to prepare for these people coming well
[1:41:01] why didn't you do it before
[1:41:05] but there was a warning saying that
[1:41:07] someone is coming
[1:41:10] that you're having a guest
[1:41:12] so get the work done
[1:41:15] and that's the same that our brother
[1:41:18] Paul is saying when you see these things
[1:41:20] happen
[1:41:21] it's a warning that there's someone
[1:41:23] coming
[1:41:27] for I this is so sad
[1:41:32] Timothy Paul tells Timothy the musicians
[1:41:35] could come Paul is telling Timothy he's
[1:41:38] saying all that I've taught you hold
[1:41:41] fast to it Timothy
[1:41:44] these things are important live right
[1:41:47] don't fail
[1:41:51] because when you see these things
[1:41:53] happening
[1:41:55] the end is nigh the end's going to be
[1:41:58] here there's a lot at stake
[1:42:01] Eunice
[1:42:05] Lois
[1:42:07] Timothy
[1:42:10] Daniel
[1:42:12] all of us
[1:42:14] there's a lot at stake
[1:42:17] for I am now ready to be offered
[1:42:21] and the time of my departure is at hand
[1:42:25] oh I've fought a good fight
[1:42:29] I've finished my course
[1:42:31] I've kept the faith
[1:42:33] and henceforth there is laid up for me a
[1:42:35] crown of righteousness
[1:42:37] which the Lord the righteous judge shall
[1:42:39] give me at that day
[1:42:42] and not to me only but unto all them
[1:42:48] also that love
[1:42:51] is appearing
[1:42:52] [Music]
[1:42:56] verse number 16.
[1:42:59] at my first answer no one no man stood
[1:43:01] with me
[1:43:03] this is when he was on trial
[1:43:05] but all men forsook me
[1:43:08] I pray God that it may not be laid to
[1:43:12] their charge look at the Spirit of
[1:43:13] Christ in Paul
[1:43:16] he forgave them
[1:43:22] and they may have left him
[1:43:26] but who would you want to be on your
[1:43:28] side
[1:43:30] flesh and blood
[1:43:32] or the spirit of Christ notwithstanding
[1:43:36] the Lord stood with me
[1:43:37] and strengthen me
[1:43:40] that by me the preaching might be fully
[1:43:42] known and that all the Gentiles might
[1:43:45] hear
[1:43:46] and I was delivered out of the mouth of
[1:43:48] a lie of the Lion
[1:43:49] and the Lord shall deliver me from every
[1:43:52] evil work and preserve me unto his
[1:43:55] Heavenly Kingdom
[1:43:57] to whom be glory forever and ever amen
[1:44:01] [Music]
[1:44:04] he is warning
[1:44:07] not only Timothy but thank God that we
[1:44:10] have this letter he's warning us
[1:44:13] he's warning us that
[1:44:15] in these last days a perilous times will
[1:44:18] come men shall be lovers of their own
[1:44:20] selves
[1:44:21] let me read it again
[1:44:22] [Music]
[1:44:30] preach the word be instant in season and
[1:44:33] out of season reprove rebuke exhort with
[1:44:35] all long-suffering and Doctrine for the
[1:44:37] time will come when they will not endure
[1:44:39] sound Doctrine
[1:44:41] but after their own lust shall they Heap
[1:44:43] for themselves teachers having itching
[1:44:44] ears
[1:44:45] [Music]
[1:44:48] and they shall turn away their years
[1:44:49] from the truth
[1:44:50] and shall be turned unto Fables
[1:44:53] but watch thou in all things endure
[1:44:55] afflictions do the working of an
[1:44:56] evangelist make full proof
[1:44:59] thy Ministry
[1:45:00] [Music]
[1:45:03] the closing statements of the Apostle
[1:45:06] Paul
[1:45:08] [Music]
[1:45:11] brother Branham took what I just read
[1:45:14] [Music]
[1:45:15] wrote it
[1:45:17] those scriptures on a piece of paper
[1:45:22] as he was laying the Cornerstone for his
[1:45:25] church in 1933.
[1:45:27] took that paper and put it in the
[1:45:31] Cornerstone
[1:45:33] of his own church
[1:45:35] [Music]
[1:45:38] prophecy of what would come later
[1:45:44] built the church that's a fact that's
[1:45:48] not me making that up you can go back
[1:45:51] and you can read what he said he wrote
[1:45:54] that scripture down and stuck it in the
[1:45:56] in the Cornerstone
[1:45:59] they shall Heap for themselves teachers
[1:46:01] having itching ears turning from the
[1:46:03] truth to Fables
[1:46:07] and then as with Paul
[1:46:10] brother Branham had his closing
[1:46:12] statements
[1:46:15] in this book
[1:46:16] an exposition of the seven Church ages
[1:46:21] he
[1:46:22] finished
[1:46:24] his book published
[1:46:27] in the last couple months of his life
[1:46:29] [Music]
[1:46:31] and how did he close that book
[1:46:34] he said this
[1:46:36] I sincerely believe
[1:46:40] that the spirit of God has been speaking
[1:46:42] to us not only teaching us the truths of
[1:46:46] the ages but he has been faithful
[1:46:48] dealing with the hearts that they may
[1:46:51] turn to him
[1:46:53] that is the reason for all preaching and
[1:46:56] teaching for it is in the preaching and
[1:46:58] the teaching of the word that the sheep
[1:47:01] hear the voice of God and follow him
[1:47:04] [Music]
[1:47:06] not for one moment
[1:47:08] do I bring a message
[1:47:11] to people that they may follow me or
[1:47:14] join my church or start some fellowship
[1:47:17] and organization
[1:47:20] I have never done that and will not do
[1:47:23] that now yet we've done that
[1:47:28] I have no interest in those things
[1:47:32] closing statements I have no interest in
[1:47:36] those things but I do have an interest
[1:47:38] in the things of God and people and if I
[1:47:41] can accomplish just one thing I will be
[1:47:43] satisfied
[1:47:46] tell me this as I read this what greater
[1:47:48] thing
[1:47:49] could anyone accomplish think about John
[1:47:52] the Baptist and what he accomplished
[1:47:55] that one thing
[1:47:57] is to see established a true spiritual
[1:47:59] relationship between God and Men
[1:48:02] wherein men become New Creations in
[1:48:04] Christ
[1:48:05] filled with his spirit and live
[1:48:07] according to his word
[1:48:10] [Music]
[1:48:11] I'll read it again
[1:48:13] wherein men become New Creations in
[1:48:15] Christ filled with his spirit
[1:48:18] and live according to his word I would
[1:48:21] invite plead and warn all to hear his
[1:48:24] voice at this time and yield their lives
[1:48:27] completely to him even as I trust in my
[1:48:30] heart that I have given my all to him
[1:48:33] God bless you
[1:48:35] and may his coming
[1:48:37] Rejoice your heart
[1:48:42] God's servants
[1:48:45] are not
[1:48:46] about cutting the people out
[1:48:50] look at the Apostle Paul preach the word
[1:48:53] make full proof of your ministry do what
[1:48:57] you say live that life
[1:48:59] [Music]
[1:49:01] and because in the last day these
[1:49:04] teachers are going to come
[1:49:07] and they're going to be saying
[1:49:10] just what the congregation wants them to
[1:49:12] say so they can keep their job
[1:49:15] they're going to be saying they're going
[1:49:17] to be getting maybe mega churches
[1:49:20] coming together just love brother
[1:49:23] just love one another
[1:49:25] just just just feel good and make sure
[1:49:27] you pay your tithes and everything will
[1:49:29] be okay no
[1:49:32] this gospel is deeper than that
[1:49:35] [Music]
[1:49:36] we must live our lives according to what
[1:49:40] it says and if we are slacking
[1:49:44] I'll do it tomorrow
[1:49:46] I'll hang that picture tomorrow I'll
[1:49:48] clean my room tomorrow
[1:49:51] but I love the word it says to do it but
[1:49:53] I don't do it
[1:49:56] when the disciples came to Jesus
[1:49:59] and they said but we thought that Elijah
[1:50:02] was supposed to come first
[1:50:04] Jesus said he already came and you
[1:50:08] didn't know him
[1:50:08] [Music]
[1:50:11] how many people might say
[1:50:14] but where's the return of the lord it's
[1:50:16] already passed
[1:50:18] missed it
[1:50:20] we missed it because we weren't living
[1:50:23] every day according to this gospel
[1:50:26] [Music]
[1:50:28] forsaking ourselves
[1:50:30] and serving one another putting the
[1:50:33] other person above ourselves
[1:50:35] these little things
[1:50:37] as the word says so easily beset us
[1:50:41] but a little thing can send us to hell
[1:50:43] [Music]
[1:50:44] an unconfessed sin
[1:50:47] something that's not under the blood
[1:50:51] these are perilous times as the Apostle
[1:50:54] said
[1:50:56] so let's make sure we are doing our best
[1:50:58] we're living right not judging each
[1:51:01] other but judging ourselves
[1:51:04] living a life of servitude of
[1:51:08] Christianity that's what Christ is
[1:51:11] amen let's stand
[1:51:16] [Music]
[1:51:20] one of the closing statements that I
[1:51:22] mentioned
[1:51:24] [Music]
[1:51:27] red brother Branham
[1:51:29] and how he ended his ministry with those
[1:51:32] things
[1:51:34] told this story before but brother
[1:51:36] Jonathan you you sang that song in the
[1:51:38] wings of a snow white dove on Wednesday
[1:51:42] I was listening to that
[1:51:45] William Branham told my dad
[1:51:49] told my grandpa
[1:51:52] in 1961 he said this song that's on the
[1:51:57] radio on the wings of a snow white dove
[1:51:58] he said I have a message that I want to
[1:52:01] preach and I want to title it on the
[1:52:03] wings of a snow white dove
[1:52:05] 1961.
[1:52:08] he said when you hear this message
[1:52:12] he says you'll know it's my time to go
[1:52:15] [Music]
[1:52:16] he died
[1:52:18] in 1965
[1:52:21] December
[1:52:22] he preached that message at the end of
[1:52:24] November 1965.
[1:52:28] closing statements
[1:52:32] every day could be our last
[1:52:35] make sure that we are able to look look
[1:52:38] back
[1:52:40] and say Lord I did my best I served you
[1:52:43] LED people to Christ it wasn't about me
[1:52:46] my life wasn't live for myself
[1:52:48] as judas's was my life was lit for you
