[Music] is [Music] my grace [Music] please became [Music] all that come in by grace [Music] [Music] become in the grave [Music] is on my place [Music] foreign [Music] I wanted to say thank you so much for praying I know there's many of you that have been asking the family and myself how things are going and by God's grace I'm still here doing well um as you probably heard I had a massive issue come up last month with my clinic and they decided to terminate my treatment both with my doctor and the clinic and they gave me a 30-day notice to find a new place to run and they've made it very difficult for me to do that so we started to pray and just asking the Lord plus the treatments themselves have been really difficult but thank God last week I got notice from some physicians in a group that do serve our Clinic and they're willing to take my care and so for now I won't have any uninterrupted care which is what we were praying for the most it's very critical I have to go from one day to the next you know with the treatments I really can't spend more than three days off of treatment so that is a complete answer to prayer really given me a lot of um hope that you know this is going to get worked out and the other thing is I hadn't had several well it's almost been a year now one of my levels had gone way out of bounds and it affects bone health and skin health and things like this I was given the wrong dose of medication for almost over a year before I was able to get it corrected and I've been praying and praying about those things and always My Confession has been that the Lord will keep these things under under control because they're you know you're fighting sickness it's anything that can go wrong and just this past week I got the lab report back that it had dropped by 600 points and I've been praying for that we've been working with some medication and things and that's just a real big Comfort to my heart to know that that range is back where heading back down to where it should be so I just want to give God praise and also thank you very much for praying keeping me in prayer I still have several things coming up in this next week's a few weeks here I have to do a lot of things with the State Department of Health a lot of things with my management I have to meet these new doctors set up new orders it's quite a lot so if you would still continue to keep me in prayer but I know that I've always I just felt the Lord speak to me a lot in these last few weeks reminding me who's your source you know it's not the clinic that keeps you safe it's not the treatment that keeps you alive it's not you know those things help and they're in place by God's grace but it's his hand in his Mercy his breath of life that gives us and all our hope and so I'm um just trying to Anchor myself again in the promises that the lord gave me for full healing and this song after brother Daniel asked if I would sing I had this song in my heart Whispering hope and it's meant a lot to me over the years to sing this song but one of the things that I realized I used to wonder about Hope and one day I had to realize that before you can have faith you have to have hope if you lose your hope for something you can't have faith for it and for me hope really became something important to hold on to so I hope this is a blessing foreign [Music] hope with the gentleman's wish wait till the darkness [Music] good morning [Music] if in the dust [Music] why should the hearts why Lords means [Music] Oh Come Back [Music] oh my God [Music] Breaking My Heart [Music] [Applause] brother Joe come forward we just had one prayer request this afternoon from Sister Holly she was asking for prayer for creed Johnson he's going through some struggles so we're going to put him before the Lord um we're not going to pray for brother Joe's birthday [Music] yeah I'll uh I'll get us ready for prayer house this is a special day in a really weird way that only Christians can understand [Music] at the lowest part of my life I had my 40th birthday 14 years ago [Music] that's it I was gonna make a major decision and have someone not be in my life and uh it was so cold I was so far away from Jesus and on that day Sarah and was diagnosed with brain cancer [Music] foreign said what are you going to do what am I going to do an all-powerful creator of this universe as you know we rekindled the most incredible love story you've ever seen [Music] right here and a lot of you saw me baptized right up there afterwards with her in the pews all my kids and uh we rejoice that she's now in heaven we're glad because we're Christians all of us and to know that our family as a family of Christians is really comforting and so my birthday you know I celebrate not only you know it's not really something to celebrate when you're 54. it's like uh but to celebrate that God loved me so much to send me you each one of you and to comfort me through the hardest times of my life Tucson Tabernacle has been here and now that the Tucson Tabernacle as this rekindled energy and spirit we pray for it a sister but I think we all pray a special prayer about that one person out there that one person that needs the prayer and it shares with you when that person gets blessed you'll be blessed now let's all raise a hand [Music] have this prayer for that person heavenly father thank you so much for for this wonderful day and this wonderful service and these wonderful brothers and sisters with a pastor and a church and musicians and everyone that's doing so much my good and for the good of each other that we're so much in love with one another that we're opening our hearts and opening our minds to know how we can love those that are not here that we don't understand understanding that you want us to reach out to them that you want us to soften our hearts that you want us to be so much more than we are in this moment you created us at a credible incredible masterpieces each and every one of us and that we can see in each and every other person that we come into contact with that they are masterpieces that you've created not only for us but for all of us that together we can do what you have in store for us we have prayer requests today each one of us has these deep prayers in our hearts you know them already they've already been answered just give us the faith More Than Hope give us faith that these things are done Jesus precious name we pray amen thank you [Music] that's all Stan we'll invite our brother Aaron out oh [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] thank you all things are possible Lord I Am Lord I believe [Music] in all things are possible Lord I [Music] sometimes we even have to say Lord help thou [Music] and he will he's a father that cares for his own a matter so thank you you may be seated just for a moment here see brother Jonathan's not here but brother Jonathan has been helping this past week he spent the day with my dad we were going to have to get some full-time care and brother Jonathan we had found out had done this type of care and made himself available now as a family discussed this we sat down in and we mentioned brother Jonathan to the rest of the family and they said that'll be perfect because he's going to be a Christian in the house we don't have to worry about who they would send and what they might want and what they might be but here's going to be a Christian in the house so if there was one issue and I was going to say this in front of him so hopefully he's hearing he was doing too much he wanted my mom to sit down and he'd clean the house we had to tell him no no no no you take care of that mom does those things but that's what keeps her busy that's what keeps her active she knows where she walks with her hand touching the walls she knows where everything's at she washes the dishes she sweeps the floors she washes the clothes sometimes it's all black she says sometimes it's all white but she can't see anything she doesn't know what it's going to be but she said tell the brother please I can handle this but brother Jonathan just wanted to do that with all his heart so really appreciate it he's been the family that's been blessed with that and we're going to use him dad wanted to be in church today we told him please take a little bit more time we me and my wife spend the day with him helping him yesterday but he's getting up out of the chair on his own going to the bathroom on his own getting in and out of bed on his own now and and holding his head up like this when he sits so it's just it's encouraging to him I know that it's he called me the other day he said I was ready to get up the chair and I'll just tell you something helped me just get up she said I know the Lord is watching over me so it's it's good to know the Lord today so appreciate that so we told brother Jonathan two weeks you know and he committed to that we may if it needs more we do more but so he asked Dad is are you getting along fine with brother Jonathan can you understand him he says until he gets excited and I said we've heard him preach that way yeah and I told brother Jonathan when you get excited we have a hard time understanding you but um I said and in your exercises that you're supposed to do oh he makes sure I do them brother Larry we're going to do the exercises now so it's been good the Lord's been good to us so and I know Sarah gave her testimony we sat through the meeting when they shared all this with us but that's the day the lord gave me that song the battle is the Lord's it is the Lord's and sometimes we just have to say yes Lord take our hands off of it and brother Joe happy birthday hi yeah on the dashboard of my truck I still have that little blue thing with the that you gave us to each one of us at the memorial and I remember there at the park when they dedicated the park after your wife's name and we prayed with the people there God has a reason and a purpose for all those things song says we'll understand it all by and by in the meantime like you said Lord increase our faith to believe that so you know as as spoke with brother Daniel about ministering and I'll kind of give a little bit of background here when he spoke this man Alex that he had met out and the man was in serious problems with drugs and all and he spoke to brother Daniel and you know brother Daniel shared it with us and then the next week he comes out and he sees the three men over there and he approaches them and one of them was Alex reading the Bible to the other two now brother Daniel was honest he said really in his heart he said and God couldn't have done that so quick but yes God works that way so on on Monday I was driving one one job site to the other and just began to think of that with brother Daniel had said and the Lord began to speak to me and he said you know I have less problem with those type of people than those who are religious and don't think they need help and you know I'm fine I'm good as is you know and he began to take me to some scriptures and just speak to me about it so when I spoke to brother Daniel about ministering and he just asked him how would he want to do this he says when you feel like you have something in your heart just let me know and we'll do that he says I'll never tell you what to preach on but could you just preach on what you told me so he broke his promise right off the bat no but no it was something already in my heart and I felt show of course this morning brother Daniel's preaching and you're is this going to tie together is this going to go together is this you know and and he ran and he went to the part where he began to speak and he said he doesn't even know them they've done all these things but he says I don't even know you because we've never had that Fellowship you know so this morning when he woke up and I I looked at scripture of the day and it was in Psalms 113 and it's just seven verses so I read psalms through 113 and then I read through psalms 114 and I just went right on to 115 and began to read it in verses one through nine I'm reading through them and and just reading through them but I had forgotten that about verses 9 and through 13. and I've read and I was halfway realized these are the this is a Psalm you gave me when I asked you do you know who I am and he took me right to Psalms 115 verses 19. oh House of Aaron I have blessed thee and I have kept thee so when he began to ask him there does he know you I said Lord this morning you reminded you know who I am and I Know Who You Are so I said Lord you're in charge of all of this and and we trust in you so I would title this message he looked beyond my faults and he saw my need and if I could have maybe um what would I say uh a subtitle he said I must needs go to Samaria and you'll see that in the scripture so well while we're seated let's just bow our heads for a moment Lord as as humans in in his people with a finite mind we can see so much and so far Lord but you've already seen it all back from before the foundation of the world Lord which we can't understand that you give us glimpses and sometimes just a a touch and we know you're real you come by and you minister to us you talk with us Lord you fellowship with us Lord but Lord it was something that was in your heart a desire in your heart because it was it was that that was within you Lord and today it's being expressed this day right here at Tucson Tabernacle this evening how much you care for us that's your desire for us Lord and all you ask for us is just to surrender and yield to it and accept what you want to give to us to do for us the fellowship Lord the the conversations the times together how much it pleases you Lord so this evening Lord as as we Minister your word and things you've laid in our hearts Lord would would you just help us to see how much you care for us Lord how much we mean to you Even in our our state that we are at Even in our fallen State Even in our hard State even in the times that Lord we've done opposite of what you would desire you still look beyond our faults and you saw our need Lord and you met it so we just want to say thank you Lord because we appreciate it very much in Jesus Christ's name amen brother Daniel had asked I'd also said he said if you'd like to take one of the chapters of Acts that would be okay and I said no I think I'll leave that to you and brother Lyle because I think you do a much better job of teaching than I do so there is a portion out of the book of Acts but I'm jumping way ahead so um but we'll start with uh Luke 7 verse 28. there's a lot of scriptures we'll go through them and he says for I say unto you among those that are born of a woman there is not a greater Prophet than John the Baptist then he says but he that is the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he so sometimes if we're not careful we'll put somebody else before us higher than us bigger than us more important than us and John had that place to introduce the Messiah but God says I'm looking at that each one of you are as valuable to me as John was and I gave my life for each one of you so sometimes we look at it and and we're not careful or we do it we put this as bigger and this is less but for God it was all the same and remember the thought here that he shared with me that he spoke to me and he said I have less problem with these who are in a lot of problems than those who think they don't need help religious people Matthew 26 6-13 just kind of laying a little bit of background here 26 6-13 he said now when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box a very precious ointment and parted on his head as he sat at meat but when his disciples saw it those who are around him those who knew him well they had indignation saying to to what purpose is this waste it doesn't say when that one specific disciple said when the disciples sought for this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor when Jesus understood it he said unto them why trouble ye the woman for she has wrought a good work upon me for ye have the poor always with you but me you have not always for in that she have poured this ointment on my body and she did that for my burial he was about to go through the greatest benefit we would ever have in life and they're saying why did she waste that verily I say unto you whosoever this gospel wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world there shall also this that the woman hath done be told for a memorial of her and the disciples were complaining I just said to myself Lord help us sometimes we don't understand it but don't let us look at it wrong saying Lord I don't understand it but you're in charge of this you're in control of yourself yesterday evening we had some of the older young folks because my girls are all in their 30s and olders now so it's my turn to preach about brother Daniel gets it when he preaches that's why it turned out and so they were over in I uh waited till they were all sitted at the table and I said I just want to let you know oh everything that is said and done here be careful because it might be spoken at church tomorrow they behave themselves very well they were we we have a good group of young people here I love the Lord Jesus first of all okay it's just it's just good to see that and be there so we we were blessing it had been a long time since we had had uh something like that at the house was we had been doing a lot of remodeling work and stuff like that and Mama finally felt like it'll be okay now I'm happy with it and she said it sure was nice to have them over and and they were very um very good about leaving early enough we didn't have to chase at home at one o'clock in the morning so but we enjoyed them very much so I appreciate that so so again just just the thought here is is those that that God was ministering to if you look at it through the book The First the four gospels how he reached to those who were looked down on how we're considered they were considered less not worthy of the Gospel not worthy of this people like Peter who look at some of these that Jesus called as his disciples they were not those that we would have said oh they're not learned they're not studied they don't know the message they don't know this but God said no they're the ones I will choose and I will meet with them no the first quote that I want to read numbers have two quotes and I want to read this one first out of the message shalom and I believe I gave it to them so he says like Paul said Hallelujah he had an infirmity something that was bothering him the devil would Buffet him blow after blow and he consulted the Lord three times to take it away from him he said I don't want this Lord take it away from me now when I read that I think I could hear Paul saying Lord look I'm I'm your servant I'm doing what you want me to do you've called me to be here but this is bothering me and if you would take it away from me I would be much more effective I could do a better job I think I could handle this better I think we start telling God how we can handle his program and sometimes I can't even take care of myself you know but here we are so and then one night the Lord spoke to him and said Paul my grace is sufficient more than enough do you realize that this favor that I place on you and I do for you is nothing you've deserved it's Grace think it was brother green that used the term unmerited favor nothing that I did to Merit it I I type that in as a relationship between a husband and a wife the the the the bond of there is love okay but when I do this because I think if I don't do this for her she'll be mad at me or if she's saying then what kind of relationship is that but if I do it for her because I love her and she does it because now that's the type of relationship you want to live with you want to be in and that's the relationship we have with God we know that he first loved us we know that we're part of him we know that he went to Calvary for us and there even though he said is there another way to do this he let his will go and said not my will but thy will be done because he desired that Fellowship he loved me before I knew him before I even even had had any fellowship with him or even I knew he loved me already and he says I'm going to take care of this situation that has broken the fellowship and he's going to do that so here it is he says my grace I know you don't Merit it Paul it's nothing you did for it but I'm giving it to you so then Paul realized and he said then all glory in my infirmity all glory in it I know you're the Healer I've seen you heal the sick raise the dead and cast out Devils Open the Eyes of the blind but I've consulted you and you tell me your grace is sufficient then this devil that bothers me is The Growing Pains of your grace oh so that's why some of the problems that I go through so that I can experience his grace and his love even more when I don't deserve it because a lot of times Lord I've done some good things for you I deserve your grace now that's not Grace that's works Lord I'm a failure but yet your mercy still reaches out to me and you still love me let that Grace work in his life he says it's a Growing Pains of your grace then I'll glory in my infirmities because it lets God be manifested why if lest I get exalted above the abundance of the revelation you see Paul was given all of this so it could be written for us opened up and he could stand there and say I have more Revelation than any of you God has given to me I went three and a half years in Arabia and didn't consult with a single person but I met with God personally but he could have puffed himself up you know if you if you look through Paul through Paul's writings he's always talking and he says if and he comes in he says if if you want to compare uh uh genealogy if you want to compare lineage if you want to compare experiences I'll compare him with you I'm I was born this way I came through this I did this has happened I this I've met him she says but I count it as nothing that's the first day he's a messenger the seventh angel messenger had no education very little schooling and you hear him Lament The fact if I would have had a little more education if I would have been I could have understood I could have but God can use both he's going through the the Oral Roberts University I believe and he's walking through and he's expressing his thoughts saying Lord obviously you didn't have enough confidence in me to be able to handle the monies the things and so forth and that's he's talking to himself to God he's looking down at himself and it was not until he got out of that atmosphere he stepped outside of that that voice said I am your portion we got to get out of some of the atmospheres that we create ourselves that we put into ourselves that we find ourselves in and um they're no fun sometimes well most of the time if not all the time if it's those type of atmospheres it's the last couple of months of work and it's been the last couple years of work has been hard it's been frustrating because so much as of it is out of our control and everything to the point it's made it difficult for me and I told my wife the other day and I apologize to her I'm sorry I've been a little difficult to be around because of all this pressure all this going I want to be able to do something about it and sometimes I can't and I have to learn to understand that I can't um it's out of my control and and so I had to apologize I said I've been a little hard to deal with lately just as I'm frustrated I'm upset um and when you get that way you snap real easy or you say things you should to say and and you don't mean it you just you know but when you can let go and let God and sometimes I'm driving along going from one job to another like I said the other day that man hitting uh you know curse at me I just happened to be the employee of our company and he let go at me because he's frustrated because we haven't been able to resolve his issues and and this is what happened I I went in and I wish I could say I rejoice in the Lord that I had been a Christian and it didn't really go that way I walked in and the painter was working there and I began to tell him about what just happened outside and then I told the other guy about what happened inside and then it was later and I said but I never talked to God about it because see those guys agreed with me yeah it's been terrible yeah it's been real bad yeah it's been maybe God would have spoke a little different he would have said it's okay all right just be a Christian these are this is my grace this is how you learn your lessons this is how you grow you know and it was until later I said I'm sorry Lord I should have talked to you about it rather than spread my woes with everybody else and we get that way so Paul here is saying you know God keeps us humble God keeps us yet he gives us eternal life so looking at this here he was this parable of this this woman and now we'll take some examples of those who we were not given an opportunity to be a Christian Luke 19. verses 5 through 10 and and there's so many examples and especially in the the four Gospels of people who God Jesus went out out of his way to go meet with him Luke 19 verses 5 through 10. and I'm going to just do portions of the thing because some of these would be 25 or 30 scriptures long but now Zacchaeus we know had gotten up in the tree because he wanted he was a little man and he wanted to see Jesus and when Jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and I don't think he was surprised the Zacchaeus Was up there I think he already knew and he said unto him Zacchaeus make haste and come down for today I must abide at thy house so he's already knowing where he was going I'm going over to Zacchaeus place today he doesn't know it he's climbing up the tree but I'm fully aware of it and he made haste and he came down and received him joyfully and when they saw it they all murmured saying that was gone that he was gone to be the guest with a man that is a sinner I'm glad that he's not afraid to be the guest of someone who's a sinner because that's where me and you were at one time and he was willing to walk down our street and said hey knock on my door and I said yes who is it is that I am the Lord Jesus and I'm here for you and Zacchaeus stood and said unto the Lord be whole Lord the half of my goods I give to the poor and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation I restore him fourfold so now here he is confessing what he did when you get before the Lord and he comes and he deals you with your heart in that way you have but nothing but to say I'm you're right Lord I'm wrong it's not a time for excuses it's a time to make things right because it's God expressing his love to you and perfect love cast away all fear he's not going to condemn me he's not going to strike me dead when I tell him I'm wrong in all the wrongs I did he's going to love me and Jesus said unto him this day is salvation to come to this house for as much as he also is a son of Abraham Zacchaeus didn't know it till then that he was a son of Abraham if you looked at his deeds neither did we but when he met God God came down that way because Zacchaeus Was up in the tree how many know God has met you that way in your situation hey I was in a place and God came down my way and he said verse 10 for the son of man has come to seek and to say that which was lost so if it was lost at one time it was not lost the way it's worded at one time it was not lost brother Branham says at one time you were in the back of his mind of thought you were going to be expressed at a certain time and God chose this time for each one of you Mark 5 15-20 I'm sorry I've got the wrong scripture I jumped ahead let's go to Luke 18. 9 through 14. and he spake the this Parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others he said there are those who are righteous in themselves and they look down on others and and that's happened to all of us I'm sure somebody who has said this or that about you or you don't believe this like I believe it or you don't see it this way the way I see it therefore you're not you know I I've shared this experience with you and something brother Dan said this morning reminded me of it when he was talking about this one who who was and he is the word denominations within the message and they're there they are there and and this brother come up to me and I was with another brother and he said I got a question for you and I said yeah go ahead you know ask and he said would you do what brother Branham said or would you do what brother Branham did and I don't think you can answer a question with just that much information what is this leading to so I said explain yourself what do you mean and he said well brother Branham said you shouldn't have a a Christmas tree but he had one so which would you do and again it's just the Lord that gives you the answer he said and I looked at him I said brother I just draw a bigger Circle that was my answer to him and he goes what I said I would draw a bigger Circle and cover those that don't see it the way it'll come right back in and you look at me said Thank you and he walked away the other brother looked at me and he said where did that answer come from I said from him because I had no plans for this I didn't say I'm going to meet this man he's going to ask me this question and I'm going to no we were just walking down the hallway and the brother comes up but God gives the answers draw a bigger Circle you're my brother you're my sister so it says they trusted in themselves righteous and despise other he said two men went up to the temple to pray one a Pharisee and the other Republican the Pharisees stood and prayed thus with himself God I thank thee that I am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican I fast twice in the week I give tithe of all that I possess and the public can stand in afar off were not even lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his own breath saying God be merciful to me a sinner I tell you this man went down to his house Justified rather than the other for everyone that exalters himself shall be abased and he that humble themselves shall be exalted God said it's easier to deal with somebody like that who will come and say hey I need your help I'm willing to take your help now let's go to we did Mark I guess if I follow the sheet by number it'd be a little easier what's that yes I did I just not reading to the bottom yeah you know it's it's kind of funny if you follow directions things work pretty good you ever build a model and then skip part of the directions and wonder how you ended up with what you ended up with yeah I did a lot of that it was supposed to be an airplane but looked more like it had crashed already you know sometimes I think we do that in our own lives you know God I can finish this project you're working on I think I've got it all figured out I think I've got it resolved and I prayed all last night and Lord and I did I read a whole chapter this day and I did this I did my good deed already so Lord I'm ready God says go and then when you fall flat on your face we'll work on this again you know so let's go to John chapter 4 and I'm going to jump through some of this verses because we pretty well know the stories we've read the scriptures you know John chapter 4 verse 4. and he must need to go through Samaria he's with his disciples and he's headed in and some he knew he had to go this certain route and of course now we jump to verse 7 and he says and we know he's going down that way and there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water and Jesus saith unto her give me to drink now I don't know I've always said he told you know we know he told his disciples to go get some meat to go to town because I don't think the disciples would have understood why are you dealing with this woman do you know why she's here why the she has to be here at this time yes he did know why he said I must need to go that way there's someone over there that needs me you know ah so that you know in verse 7 he says give he tells her to give me a drink he discusses with her and tells her about the water that he gives verse 15 the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come hither to draw she's still thinking in the natural I'm not sure how you're going to do it but we have to draw we have to put the pail down we have to bring it back up too but you're telling me about something that doesn't that works differently than this Jesus said now under here you go go call thy husband and then and come hither the woman answers that I have no husband Jesus said unto her thou has well said I have no husband for thou Hast five husbands and he whom thou now has is not thy husband in that thou said is truly could you imagine being told something straight out like that whether you're walking through the line with a prophet the Lord Jesus Christ somebody using somebody and they just you have two two reactions to that you try to hide it you try to cover it you try to make an excuse for it or you realize only God knows that and if only God knows that and he's unveiling it why don't you say Lord obviously you care you know you're not doing this to embarrassing me you're not doing this to shame me you're doing this to help me when God comes down your way and he begins to unveil something begins to show you something in your heart say yes Lord you're being mindful of me right now he says so she says the woman saith him sir I perceive that thou art a prophet she had enough teaching enough knowing that this is something a prophet of God would do you know and I don't know what experiences you've had in your life but I've had some of those in my life and I think I've shared them with you when brother Steve Shelley came this way the first time and he was here ministering I came up in the prayer line he was somewhere about I think he was right about here and we came walking right up about there and I was just about to where that speaker is and I'd had some problems with my ankle but my heart was for two people who I wanted God to deal with their hearts and as he's come up right about there he said now brother you're here for two people who are in your heart he said those words right to me and I know that's exactly why I was coming up and I just jumped straight up I I just with the reaction God knows and he's going to meet it God's going to do it his way she recognized hey this has got to be God this has got to be a prophet brother Shelley came walking down the middle aisle at the end of service and there was a family sitting towards the very back and I was in the back seat like where brother Lyle is there and he's speaking in tongues and when he gets about to wear this family he turns and he's speaking in tongues pointing at them the whole family was sitting there I'm not understanding the words I'm just listening but the sister he was talking to her daughter and husband that their son-in-law were sitting there they heard the whole thing in English the rest of us heard the tongues and what he told her was exactly what was going on in her life what had happened and how God didn't hold it against her God still moves God still works God still cares these things are true no he she Rick I perceive that thou art a prophet and you know and we'll jump to verse verse 25 he said the woman saith unto him I know that the Messiah cometh which is called Christ when he has come he was tell us these things Jesus saith unto her I that speak unto thee am he I am this promise that you're asking about and I'm doing it exactly and you've recognized it now watch this and this is this is kind of when we're here and upon this time right about this time came his disciples and Marvel that he talked to with that woman yet no man said what sickest thou or who I talk is outer but they're wondering why is he talking to her he knows that at this time she's a woman of ill Fame she's not a good woman that's why they're seeing that and you know but he had already said I got to go through some area When God Says something like that don't question him if you need to know he'll tell you but just say Lord you've proved yourself over and over and over I'm going to trust in you you've got this all under control now we know that that that she goes back to tell all those isn't this the very Messiah see if you jump all the way up to verse 32 9 and he said in many of the Samaritans of that City believed on him for the saying of the woman which testified he told me all that I ever did brother Joe if the Lord would come and he would take one thing out of your life and say Joe about this and this you would say the same thing he told me everything that I've ever did because you realize he knew it all but he never condemned her he never said because of this action I can't help you he just said I am he and I can give you this water but watch of this so many of the Samaritans believed on him so when the Samaritans were come unto him they besought him that he would tarry with them and he Abode their two days and many more believed because of his own word yet he could walk among the religious people and all they did was criticize him run him down and draw none of the benefits that they could have got from him we have to be very careful because it's easy for us to do the same thing Lord you know I've been a Christian for so long I've I can honestly say I've been a Christian in my whole life I was raised in a Christian home I've never known the world as other people have known but I need just as much salvation in fact these are the type of people God has a harder time with I been a good boy I never did this and I thank God that he kept me from all of that I have an older brother who got into some trouble and later in life he was telling me he said I still have those memories I still have some of those flashbacks of things I did that I wish I never did but you know I needed God as much as anybody else there had to come to a time in my life when I realized I'm a sinner without him I am nothing and the honest truth God has kept us is watched over us the only the only person that I ever kissed in my life is my wife the only time the first time I kissed her we were married okay but I still needed salvation I still needed God's mercy it never changes but you know it was People Like Us who walked around for a while saying I'm a good boy I'm better than those you know you look down on people if you're not careful but a god rich in Mercy said you're mine and I'll reach out to you I he has spoken to me in an audible voice four times in my life why he chose to do that I don't know but he did I was a young man about 17 years old sitting maybe a couple rows would be right behind Brother Andy in the December meetings maybe close to where sister Martha is or right in that area someplace and it was jam-packed there was six 700 people and those meetings maybe more we were packed in like sardines chairs down here literally like this and by where brother Joe is maybe one row back there was a brother there who was my pastor at the time another brother was preaching here and I would watch my pastor then and how he reacted I reacted if he said amen I said amen if he nodded his head I nodded my head if he didn't react I didn't react I was being very spiritual I thought so we laugh about some of those things we look back on him but at that time it was very serious we thought we were doing right and I was facing this way so on my left side a voice spoke to me from about right here just right behind me and said is that man your Holy Ghost I turned to look because there was a loud voice from behind me and I turned to look this way to see who it was there was nobody standing there and nobody else turned I would love to say I understood it then but it was a little later in life in our allies I had my eyes on a man and God was telling me I am your portion later on a little older already married and we had gone to visit another church and I was thinking possibly maybe we would go there I had spoke to brother green about it we shared some things I told him just telling you know I'm going I didn't tell him that I was possibly thinking of going but I was going to go visit but see God knew everything behind that you know we were sitting down in the church the song leader of that church knew me well and I have said in my heart please don't call me up don't don't recognize me I just want to sit here he never did and he was leading the song service and the minister comes out like we do stand here and that same voice again said now there's a man who's very high on himself loudly again I turned to see who's standing and talking to me I turn around and look to my wife and she's not reacting and I later asked her did you hear that voice he said I heard nothing about halfway through this ministering the brother began to exalt himself how he was as revelated he had as good a revelation as anybody in the message and began to lift himself up I don't hold it against the brother it was God telling me that's not your place that's not where you belong later at the Tabernacle here Tabernacle is going through some changes and there was some competition between some of the brothers who wanted the authority here and it got pretty political there was things that happened here it happened in the offices and it was it was a tough time and I chose at that time to back away from Ministry and not get involved in that but I was driving my work vehicle East on Valencia crossing over the railroad tracks by the airport just past Nogales Highway and I asked this question out loud because brother green used to call us the pastors the four of us Brothers we were the pastors and I just said to him I said Lord what does a pastor need to know understand and it was as if he was sitting on the passenger seat there and the voice rang out and said a pastor needs to understand the Sheep are mine they're not his it made the van go like this and it shook me but it's one of the best things that ever happened to me you are God's sheep you are God's redeemed you are in God's hands we have to surrender ourselves to be of service to you and if a pastor is not careful he begins to demand the attention the desire you're serving me but no you're God's people brother Ram says we're just here to serve the last time he spoke to me we were looking at a brother and you know it's easy to look upon a man a brother and as this was before I got to service and I was looking at a certain brother and all and the Lord spoke the same voice but he spoke it quietly in my ear and I recognized the voice because it's spoken to me four times now and he said he will be their Holy Ghost and I stopped and I said Lord you are in charge of all of this and I commit it to you God watches over his heritage no man is to be in charge no man is to be the Holy Ghost we are to surrender and yield when a man and I'm saying this by personal experience now and I'm not speaking of him speaking of myself when I want to be in charge when I want it to go my way then God can't have his way but brother Branham says in brother Daniel reminded me when he said it no it was my father talking to me today I believe he said when he said remember brother brannins or maybe it was you maybe both of you got a short memory um I think I don't remember but he said the greatest gift a person can have is getting themselves out of the way and letting God Speak it's not the easiest thing to do because you're human it's a battle but look what God Said look to who he went to to people who realized they had no good to offer there wasn't nothing they could say Lord look at my righteous Deeds they had nothing there's Zacchaeus in life Legion what you know look at this man Legion at the end after his change he wants to follow he says I want to go with you Jesus I want to I want to follow you and he says no why didn't you go back home and be a testimony of what I did for you of who I am that will speak louder go home and be a Christian in your neighborhood go home and be a Christian in your job go over there and be a light where you're at that'll speak louder because all he had that group following him everywhere they went as they followed by the Branham everywhere they went it was easy to be around somebody that God was using because you you could kind of just lean on them but when you're alone your light has to shine you have to be able to reach out to someone somebody come and say Hey Brother Daniel what is it about you that's different what is it about you sister that's different or as brother Daniel was talking to our sisters today back here he said why do you dress the way you dress why do you act the way you act now you have an opportunity to share what God has done for you in your life he's a real God he never fails and if he has to take your kicking and dragging he's going to take you kicking and dragging because he's going to get to you to where you need to be are you willing to say Amen to that so be it Lord sure Sunday night at service yes but what about Monday morning when you get up go to work what about when you get there on Monday and the boss says you know what I know we had all this plan but I'm going to need you and reroute you and send you the other way and you're already set all up for this could you be like Jesus said I must needs to go that way God has a reason Acts chapter 16. 16-34. we'll finish with this one and as it came to pass and as as we went this is the relating in Acts here and it came to pass as we went to prayer a certain damsel possessed with his Spirit of divination met us which brought her Masters much gained by soothsay the same followed Paul and us and cried saying these men are the Servants of the most high God which show unto us the way of Salvation And Thus did she many days but Paul being grieved turned and said to the spirit I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her and he came out of her the same hour and I'm going to ask you a question you moms and dads you have a daughter a son who who's being used this way and you know it's not right would you not have been so happy so appreciative that God had just delivered your son or daughter well let's see and when her master saw that the hope of their gains was gone they caught Paul and Silas and Drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers and brought them to the magistrate saying these men being Jews do exceedingly trouble our city because they made one of ours well they're troubling our city because they're coming by and healing people they were more worried about the money in their pocket and teach Customs which are not lawful for us to receive neither to observe being Romans they would rather have their Customs than see someone delivered by God and the multitude wrote up together against them and the magistrates ran off their clothes and commanded to beat them and when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast them into prison charging the the Jailer to keep them safely now I've always said when Paul told Silas let's go with me why don't you go with me to the city I'm sure Silas is thinking wow we are going to see some wonderful Miracles God is going to move I've heard the testimonies of Paul ah some things they'll probably take us into the house and feed us well we'll be treated great and it doesn't go that way so who having received such a church thrust him into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stalks clocked him up and I've always said Silas is looking at Paul and he said you never told me about any of this part of your experiences I didn't know that this was included in the package that were you know that I signed up for and at midnight now Paula Terminus said to to Silas and I'm just thinking that this is a way maybe to win he goes Silas I've been here before God always comes through and there's a reason for this and there's only one way really to get past begin to sing praises to Him let's just begin to worship let's begin to talk of his goodness let's remember the good things here let's talk about his goodness the Miracles do you remember when this happened let's encourage ourselves in Christ he says and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang Praises unto God and the prisoners heard them and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were open and everyone's bands were loosed that's amazing that God is able to shake foundations loose bands and unlock doors without the whole thing falling in on them her God is more than able to go to that situation you're in and deliver you out of it let him do it his way don't begin to tell him Lord I know you can but can you do it my way he goes I could but do you want to be in this twice as long or you want to be delivered today and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the printer were shaken and me immediately all the doors were open and everyone's bands were loosed and The Keeper of the prison Awakening out of his sleep seeing the prison doors open he drew his own sword and would have killed himself supposing that the prisoners had been fled I would think that would have been the first reaction I'm out of here God is delivering me I get to run from prison now this is a mighty work of God yes it was a mighty work of God but not for that reason but Paul cried with a loud voice saying do not do thyself no harm for we are all here then he called for a light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before Paul inside us and brought them out and said sirs what must I do to be saved there's the reaction this is God's doing and I'm involved in the middle of it he's calling my name how do I react to it and they said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house and they spake unto him the word of the Lord and to all that were in the house and he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes and was baptized he and all his straightway the other ones wanted him punished and all because he had taken away their money their gains and all but God said you're going to go through that because I've got a Jailer and a family that I got to go meet with God puts us in situations sometimes and if we'll just say Lord is there a reason for this could I testify to somebody could I be a light could I be a help how long was Joseph in the prison he was a young man when he went I believe it was 19 years all Joseph really had to look back to was you gave me some dreams that this would happen and I will stand on that I have your word that you said you'd never leave me you would never forsake me that all my steps are ordered by God therefore I will trust in you and you know I wonder how many times God has done things for us and we've not recognized it in the message here ye him and if you listen to brother Brandon I'm speaking this portion you can hear Brother Brandon's voice just as his heart's being torn apart this was when he went hunting with his friend Bert and there he's he's using that call to call the does in as a fawn call and that mother deer would automatically respond to it because that's her nature and I know that deer wasn't standing over 30 yards and I looked again around again and I saw him level that steady nerve putting that crosshairs right across the heart of that mother she looked around she heard the baby's cry she come walking out in the middle of that little place right out in the open Bert is using a call imitating a baby deer why she couldn't help it she was a mother she by Nature was a mother she wasn't putting that on she was a mother to begin with and there was a baby in trouble and she must get to it it was in trouble but it speaks to me of the heart of God when you and I were in trouble and something began to call out to him he says I must go there is no hope of Salvation if I don't go it was something in her any other time she'd have been scared to death that will that's what she was hiding back in the bushes for to keep away from that light Place till it got night and then she'd go out and feed but the baby was in trouble the mother instinct called her it was Duty she walked out listening again with those big ears up and I seen his nervous as he quieted down I turned my head I thought oh God don't let him do that I note in a few moments time just a second or two that bullet of the 30-06 rifle would blow her the mother's heart right plumbed to the other side of her and thought that gallon display of real love that mother loving that little baby so much she's walking out there and I looked and she she'd seen the hunter she stopped those big ears come to a point she caught the scent of him and she stood there but the mother's love she couldn't help it she went walking on Hunting that baby it wasn't a put on it was the real thing she was right walking right into the face of death because she was a mother I turned my head I said God how can that cruel-hearted man do that this is Brother branham's thoughts how can that cruel-hearted man do that and when I while I was praying I noticed the silence I heard nothing I thought why don't the gun fire then I turn to look and I saw the rifle barrel going like this he dropped the rifle on the ground and turned around and grabbed me by the pan Lake and he said Billy I've had enough of it I can't stand it more tell me about this Jesus that puts that kind of love into a man's heart there on the snowy ground that cruel-hearted man by the display of a real genuine love LED that man to Christ a mother dear being who she was she couldn't help it she was a mother dear and she was going to give herself and it broke a man's heart and God reached out and touched he still does the same he still doesn't change if if I would finish this and our sisters could come up God here and just how he spoke it to me after what brother Daniel said about Alex was when he said they're self-righteous they're depending on their own works they think they're good enough I said I can't reach them they don't think they need my help he said it's easier me for me to walk out into the streets with them because they know they need help they know they can't save themselves and he just began to talk to me about these different ones never get to a point in their lives where we say Lord I can handle this but to say Lord let me depend on you let me surrender myself let me yield to you and you can have your own way for just powerheads [Music] Lord You Know Each one here you know them by name these are not to those that you would say I never knew you you never talked to me these are your children your redeemed help us all Lord to keep our Spirits humble our attitudes to say Lord let you have your way you'll be in charge of this you direct my path you be my light and I'll walk step by step in that light never get to a point where we feel we know enough I've got a greater Revelation I'm way beyond that what to say like Paul said brother I will trust in his grace and I will glory in my infirmity in other words Lord I will realize before you that I can't but you can and you will Lord and let that Grace and that mercy be expressed so someone out there some way fair and stranger someone walking down the road out front of the church or by the house or at work or turn around and say what is it about you that there's a peace in this situation there's a light about you there's a hope about you there's something about you I don't have how can I have it and it was and we could share then this Jesus Christ the Jesus Christ that's the same yesterday today and forever Lord help us help us to learn that lesson and put it to work every day in Jesus Christ's name amen

neighbor to my very only house those within my house to my co-workers Lord to those father that I would maybe have a tendency to look down on the Alex's of life those that that have not had the opportunity or have not received the opportunity that you have what we have but let our hearts reach out to them say Lord like you've been merciful to me merciful to them forgive me when I've not done
