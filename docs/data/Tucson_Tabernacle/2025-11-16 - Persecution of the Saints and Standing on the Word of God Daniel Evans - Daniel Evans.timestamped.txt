[4:56] We're about to sing about

[5:07] stripes.

[10:40] If the brothers want to come forward,
[10:42] Brother Aaron's going to open the
[10:43] service in prayer.
[10:46] Let's go to the key of F.
[10:49] Bring all your needs to
[10:54] the altar.
[10:57] Bring all your needs. Bring all your
[11:02] needs to the Lord.
[11:09] He is so willing
[11:13] and aable
[11:16] to help you
[11:19] bring all your needs to the Lord. He is
[11:26] so willing
[11:28] and he is [singing]
[11:30] so willing
[11:33] and aable [singing]
[11:35] to help you.
[11:38] So bring all your [music] needs to
[11:43] the Lord.
[11:53] So will you
[11:55] tell you how willing he was. He took
[11:57] your place on the cross.
[11:59] &gt;&gt; That's how willing he was. He said,
[12:01] "They can't do it for themselves, so
[12:04] I'll go down in their place." The one
[12:06] without sin, the righteous one, the holy
[12:09] one, said, "I'll die for them. How much
[12:12] will you love him?" The greatest
[12:15] expression of love is how you treat
[12:17] others. That's how it's manifested. I
[12:19] would say, Lord, may each one of us draw
[12:22] closer to you and that in how we treat
[12:25] one another. So we do have one need
[12:30] for the mark
[12:32] Marriott had asked prayer for sister
[12:34] Bonnie. She's not feeling well and I
[12:37] know it's the season changes and it
[12:39] seems like the body has trouble that but
[12:42] he's still a healer. He's not any less
[12:45] today than he ever was. And he's not any
[12:48] more than he was in a sense because he's
[12:50] everything.
[12:52] It's how much will we let him grow in
[12:54] us. That's really what it is. We do have
[12:56] a praise also.
[12:58] Um from Sister Amelia, she says she had
[13:01] been sick, but today she's feeling well.
[13:03] So, how many testified to that? God's
[13:07] been good to me.
[13:08] &gt;&gt; You know, whether it was sick in in a
[13:10] physical sickness or a spiritual
[13:12] sickness and he reached out and restored
[13:14] you. So, let's just pray.
[13:18] Father, this this morning and we can
[13:20] call you Father because you are our
[13:22] father. We are your children. We're more
[13:25] than your children. We we're we're drawn
[13:27] close to you. We're we're your redeemed,
[13:30] Lord. You were willing to die for us.
[13:33] You were willing to suffer for us. You
[13:34] were willing to be bruised and broken
[13:36] and bleed for us, Lord. And you did it
[13:40] because you loved us. And that love has
[13:42] never changed.
[13:44] It doesn't waver, go up and down. It's
[13:46] [music] consistent. It's eternal, Lord.
[13:49] And therefore, we can rest on it this
[13:51] morning.
[13:52] Every hand that was raised in every
[13:54] heart and everyone that is listening in
[13:56] maybe couldn't be here today, Lord.
[13:59] May they just realize that you are more
[14:02] than able and willing, Lord, and they
[14:04] would cast all their cares upon you,
[14:06] Lord. And as we take up the offering,
[14:09] Lord, may we may be used, Lord, in your
[14:13] honor, in your glory, Lord. We ask it in
[14:16] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[14:21] &gt;&gt; Go ahead and shake somebody's hand. I
[14:22] forgot. Is there Sunday school this
[14:24] morning? For the older young kids,
[14:27] there's Sunday school. Head to Sunday
[14:29] school now. Shake somebody's hand.
[14:31] Welcome them to church this morning.
[14:34] Amen.
[15:10] You can all have your seats.
[15:14] I just feel like praising the Lord this
[15:16] morning. You know, a worship song has
[15:18] nothing to do with me or you. A worship
[15:21] song is about how great God is. Amen.
[15:24] How great he is in our lives. Amen.
[15:27] [snorts] My troubled soul, why so
[15:29] weighed down?
[15:38] My troubled soul,
[15:42] why so weigh down?
[15:47] You weren't meant
[15:50] to bear this heavy load.
[15:55] Cast all your burdens
[15:59] upon the Lord.
[16:03] Because Jesus cares.
[16:07] He cares for you.
[16:12] Jesus cares.
[16:16] He cares for [singing] you.
[16:20] And all your worrying [singing]
[16:23] won't help you make it through.
[16:28] Cast all your burdens
[16:32] upon the Lord
[16:37] and trust again
[16:39] in the promise of his love. Let's sing.
[16:43] My anxious heart. My anxious heart.
[16:49] Why so upset?
[16:53] In troubled times,
[16:56] how you so easily [singing]
[16:58] forget.
[17:01] Cast all your burdens
[17:06] upon the Lord.
[17:10] Cuz Jesus cares.
[17:14] He cares for you. Sing that. Jesus
[17:17] cares. Oh, Jesus cares.
[17:21] cares. He cares for you.
[17:26] And all your worrying
[17:29] won't help you make it through.
[17:34] Cast all your burdens
[17:39] upon the Lord.
[17:43] Trust again [singing] in the promise of
[17:48] his love. [music] And I will praise
[17:51] and I will praise
[17:54] the mighty
[17:56] name
[17:58] of Jesus. [music]
[18:00] Praise the [singing] Lord, the lifter of
[18:06] my head.
[18:08] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[18:08] &gt;&gt; Praise [music] the rock of my
[18:14] salvation.
[18:16] Oh [singing]
[18:18] my [music] days are in his faithful
[18:22] hands. Let's sing my anxious heart
[18:24] again. My anxious heart,
[18:29] why so upset
[18:33] in troubled times?
[18:36] How you so easily forget
[18:41] to cast all your burdens
[18:45] upon the [singing] Lord.
[18:49] Cuz Jesus cares.
[18:53] He cares for you.
[18:58] Jesus cares.
[19:01] He cares [singing] for you.
[19:06] and all your worrying won't help you
[19:10] make it through.
[19:14] Cast [music] all your burdens
[19:18] upon the Lord
[19:21] and trust again in the promise of
[19:26] [music] his love. Let me hear you sing
[19:28] it.

[19:35] name
[19:36] of Jesus.

[20:36] Amen. Give the Lord a hand clap of
[20:37] praise this morning. He's wonderful.
[20:48] Daniel's going to sing a song, but
[20:50] before he comes up, let's sing worthy
[20:53] the lamb that was slain. Hear the cries
[20:56] of the shackled
[20:58] from the onset of time. But that's not
[20:59] the end of the story. That's not the end
[21:02] of the story
[21:06] because the lamb, the worthy lamb, took
[21:08] all of our sins upon himself.
[21:11] So there's nobody shackled anymore
[21:13] unless they choose to be.
[21:16] You have the right. You have the choice
[21:18] to be free this morning. Amen.
[21:21] Worthy the lamb that was slain.
[21:26] Hear the cries [singing]
[21:28] of the shackled
[21:31] from the onset
[21:34] of time.
[21:37] For the chains [singing]
[21:39] of defeat, there's no key.
[21:47] See the tears
[21:50] of the broken,
[21:53] the cries
[21:55] of the slave.
[21:58] Is there no one
[22:01] [singing] worthy to set us free? Then
[22:05] the crying was [music] still.
[22:08] Then the crying
[22:11] is still.
[22:14] As the chorus
[22:16] rings out,
[22:19] the shackle
[22:22] released from [singing] their chains.
[22:28] Oh,
[22:29] and thousands [singing]
[22:32] of voices
[22:34] are swelling
[22:37] [singing] the song.
[22:40] Worthy
[22:43] lamb that was slain. Sing it. Worthy.
[22:50] He's worthy.
[22:55] So worthy.
[22:59] Oh yes, he's worthy.
[23:03] The lamb [singing]
[23:05] that was slain.
[23:08] Sing that again. He's worthy. Oh yes,
[23:11] he's worthy. [singing]
[23:15] So worthy.
[23:20] Oh worthy.
[23:24] the lamb
[23:26] that was slain.
[23:28] Then all the archangels.
[23:32] Then all the archangels [singing]
[23:36] and the saints of
[23:39] all time
[23:42] holding
[23:44] their crowns in their [singing] hands.
[23:50] Oh, will fall down
[23:54] before him,
[23:57] joining
[23:59] [singing] the song.
[24:02] Worthy,
[24:05] worthy
[24:07] the lamb.
[24:09] Sing it. Worthy, oh Lord. You're worthy.
[24:17] Worthy,
[24:23] worthy. [singing]
[24:25] The lamb
[24:27] that was slain. Just [music] tell him
[24:30] this morning, Lord, you're worthy,
[24:38] worthy,
[24:43] worthy.
[24:45] the lamb
[24:47] that was slain.
[24:52] Praise the Lord. Daniel's going to sing
[24:54] a song this morning. It's good. My voice
[24:57] is just about ready to give out.
[25:00] Praise the Lord.
[25:03] Do you appreciate Daniel?
[25:07] Amen.
[25:27] In the eye [singing] of the storm,
[25:30] you remain in [music] control.
[25:34] In the middle of the war, [singing]
[25:38] you guard my soul.
[25:41] You alone are the anchor.
[25:45] When my [music and singing] sails are
[25:46] torn,
[25:48] your love surrounds me
[25:52] in the eye of the storm.
[25:56] When the solid ground is falling out
[26:00] from underneath my feet, between the
[26:04] black [music] skies and my red eyes, I
[26:08] can barely see.
[26:10] And when I'm feeling like I've been sold
[26:13] [singing] out by my friends and my
[26:15] family,
[26:18] I can feel the rain reminding me.
[26:23] In [music] the eye of the storm,
[26:26] you remain in control.
[26:30] In the middle of the war,
[26:33] you guard my soul.
[26:36] You alone are the anchor.
[26:40] When my sails are torn,
[26:43] your love surrounds me
[26:46] in the eye of the storm.
[26:54] When my hopes and dreams are far from me
[26:57] and I'm running out of faith, I see the
[27:01] future [singing]
[27:02] I picture
[27:04] slowly [music] fade away. And when the
[27:08] tears of pain and heartache [music]
[27:11] are pouring down my face,
[27:15] I find my peace in Jesus name.
[27:20] In [singing] the eye of the storm,
[27:23] you [music] remain in control.
[27:26] In the middle of the war,
[27:29] you guard [music] my soul.
[27:32] You alone are the anchor.
[27:36] When my sails [music] are torn,
[27:39] your love surrounds [singing]
[27:41] me.
[27:42] In the eye of the song, if we could
[27:45] stand this morning.
[27:49] In the eye of the storm,
[27:52] you remain in control.
[27:55] In the middle of the war,
[27:58] you guard [music] my soul.
[28:01] You alone are the [singing] anchor.
[28:05] And when my sails [music] are torn,
[28:08] your love [singing] surrounds me.
[28:11] In the eye of the storm.
[28:18] In the eye of the [singing] storm.
[28:21] You remain in control.
[28:24] In the middle [singing] of the war,
[28:27] you [music] guard my soul.
[28:30] You alone [singing] are the anchor.
[28:33] When my sails are torn,
[28:36] your love [music] surrounds me
[28:40] in the eye of the storm.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; I ask for that song this [snorts]
[28:46] morning. I feel like sometimes,
[28:48] especially this morning, that I am in
[28:50] the eye of the storm. Let's bow our
[28:52] heads. Lord God, we thank you,
[28:57] Lord.

[30:30] the house of the Lord this morning. I
[30:32] asked Daniel to sing that song. It's
[30:33] something that it's a song that really
[30:35] means a lot to me and it it just kind of
[30:38] gives me strength and when I hear it, I
[30:41] I just kind of I get emotional because
[30:45] it uh we all go through storms. We all
[30:48] go through hardships. [snorts]

[31:20] &gt;&gt; does anybody really believe what Jesus
[31:22] said?
[31:24] &gt;&gt; Does anybody,
[31:26] [snorts]
[31:28] &gt;&gt; you have heard that it's said of old,
[31:30] you shall not murder, and whosoever
[31:31] murders will be in danger of judgment.
[31:33] But I say to you that whosoever is angry
[31:35] with his brother without a cause shall
[31:37] be in danger of judgment. And whosoever
[31:39] shall call his brother Raqqa, it's an
[31:41] insult,
[31:43] shall be in danger of counsel. But
[31:45] whoever says you fool shall be danger in
[31:48] danger of hell fire. Therefore, if you
[31:50] bring your gift to the altar and there
[31:52] remember that your brother has something
[31:53] against you, leave your gift there
[31:56] before you go to the al before you go to
[31:59] the altar before the altar and go your
[32:01] way. First be reconciled to your brother
[32:03] and then come and give your gift. You
[32:05] should not even put money in the
[32:07] offering or pay your tithes with ought
[32:10] in your heart against someone
[32:13] &gt;&gt; is what Jesus that's how important it is
[32:15] that if we have something against
[32:17] someone we have to make it right before
[32:20] you can even serve God before you can
[32:21] even make an offering in the church.
[32:26] You have heard it said you shall love
[32:27] your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I
[32:29] say to you, love your enemies, bless
[32:31] those who curse you, do good to those
[32:33] that hate you, and pray for those who
[32:35] spitefully use you and persecute you,
[32:38] [applause]
[32:40] that you may be sons of your father in
[32:43] heaven. For he makes his son to rise on
[32:46] the evil and on the good, and sends rain
[32:47] on the just and the unjust. Even God
[32:50] blesses his enemies. Even God blesses
[32:53] his enemies.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; He lets the rain fall on the just and
[32:57] the unjust.
[33:00] For if you love those who love you, what
[33:02] reward have you? Do not even the tax
[33:06] collectors do the same? And if you greet
[33:08] your brethren only,
[33:11] maybe those who aren't part of your
[33:12] denomination or your church? What do you
[33:16] more than others? Do not even the tax
[33:19] collectors do so. Therefore, you shall
[33:22] be perfect. Therefore you shall be
[33:25] perfect just as your father in heaven is
[33:27] perfect. What a statement going through
[33:30] the biatitudes and going through that
[33:31] first uh chapter five in Matthew.
[33:35] He says if you do this you'll be perfect
[33:38] as your father which is in heaven is
[33:40] perfect.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; We spent the last month on the words of
[33:43] Jesus there and I I I feel like has
[33:46] anyone really taken it seriously? Yes.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; Has anyone actually heard these things?
[33:53] These words, these are the words of the
[33:54] Messiah.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; This is God made flesh. This is our
[33:59] savior who will one day
[34:02] keep us out of hell.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we could care less what he
[34:07] said.
[34:10] Feels like it.
[34:13] My God put me here, friends.
[34:17] He places a shepherd over a body to look
[34:19] out for them.
[34:21] You fight off the wolves and you wolves,
[34:23] you take care of the flock
[34:26] until he returns,
[34:29] but that flock doesn't belong to the
[34:31] shepherd.
[34:33] He's hired
[34:35] to take care of all of these sheeps. It
[34:37] doesn't matter if it's Joe Miller, who I
[34:40] love dearly. It's like, "Oh, he's easy
[34:42] to take care of. I want to hang out with
[34:44] this sheep.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[34:46] &gt;&gt; or ah I'm not gonna say it. [laughter]
[34:50] I'm just kidding. Or somebody else.
[34:56] [laughter]
[34:57] It doesn't matter. I'm hired by God.
[35:02] It doesn't matter if we get along or we
[35:04] don't get along. My job here is to help
[35:07] you, is to serve you.
[35:10] and the concerning this situation with
[35:14] the gossip. Stop it
[35:17] in the name of the Lord Jesus. Don't do
[35:20] it anymore.
[35:21] Let it be completely wiped away. Don't
[35:24] allow it to come to you. Leave it alone.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; All right? [applause]
[35:35] Please, please, friends,
[35:37] stand strong and do what Jesus said.
[35:42] Many, many have said hurtful things to
[35:45] each other. Proverbs six, we we're
[35:48] better than that as a church. We are,
[35:52] let me tell you, when people come to
[35:54] this church, it needs to be love. And
[35:57] they need to see love, not necessarily
[35:59] for the new people. We want to love the
[36:02] new people. But when they come here,
[36:03] they need to see our love for each
[36:05] other. That's the main thing. That's
[36:08] what matters. That's what Jesus taught.
[36:10] You with me?
[36:12] &gt;&gt; Proverbs chapter 6 verse 16 says, "These
[36:14] six thing, these six things the Lord
[36:16] hates. Yay, seven, yes, seven are an
[36:18] abomination to him. A proud look, lying
[36:21] tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,
[36:23] a heart that devises wicked plans, feet
[36:25] that are swift to running to evil, a
[36:27] false witness who speaks lies, and one
[36:29] who sws discord among brethren.
[36:33] Words of God.
[36:37] Really, there's no way that gossiping
[36:41] and talking about each other can ever be
[36:44] right.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; Never. I know it sometimes it makes you
[36:48] feel better. It makes you feel better
[36:50] about yourself,
[36:53] but it's wrong.
[36:55] And I'll tell you, I do want to tell a
[36:57] story, and this one because it doesn't
[36:59] involve uh people that are in this
[37:01] church. Sorry, my notes were are
[37:04] completely messed up because I just said
[37:07] when I was back there, I said, "Forget
[37:08] it." I uh I tried to move stuff around
[37:11] and I was all confused. So, I'm
[37:14] sometimes I'm I'm trying to flip through
[37:16] to try find my scriptures. So, what
[37:18] happened uh this what really got this
[37:21] going was I went to a ministers meeting
[37:26] last Saturday, not yesterday, uh the the
[37:29] Saturday previous. And it was good. I I
[37:32] enjoyed it. The uh the brothers that
[37:34] spoke were really really sweet. And then
[37:37] there came
[37:39] a
[37:43] attack on me
[37:46] and it was me personally.
[37:49] And it was at the end, the last
[37:50] minister, and he
[37:54] looked at me and he would he would say
[37:57] things that were things that he knew
[38:00] that I stood for and then he would stop
[38:03] and he would stare me down for an
[38:06] uncomfortable amount of time. You ever
[38:08] look at somebody in the face and you're
[38:09] not talking?
[38:11] It's awkward. You ever do it for like 30
[38:13] seconds? It's really awkward.
[38:17] Joseph
[38:22] feels weird, huh?
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Zyra,
[38:31] that's what happened. It It was It was
[38:34] very very difficult. And what it was,
[38:36] the meaning of this whole thing. And and
[38:39] the the attack that came down on me was
[38:41] to say that you cannot understand this
[38:45] Bible. You cannot preach out of this
[38:47] Bible without quoting brother Brandham.
[38:49] You need Brother Brandham to understand
[38:51] this word. I said, "No."
[38:55] And I mean, I didn't say anything. as
[38:56] you as you he would stop and he he would
[38:58] make make fun make a a funny remark and
[39:02] then the people in the back would rah
[39:04] and finally at the end I said these
[39:08] words
[39:09] after it was over I'm not going to cause
[39:11] a disturbance of course after it was
[39:12] over he said uh he came over to greet me
[39:17] and I said brother I love you I
[39:20] appreciate you but I didn't I didn't
[39:21] agree with what you said between him and
[39:24] me while I was there
[39:28] and the clause came out
[39:33] and the whole thing
[39:35] was that
[39:38] you're you're a critic telling me that I
[39:42] am I'm not a believer telling me that
[39:45] I'm anointed with the devil telling me
[39:47] that because um I say that I h I can
[39:51] understand the Bible that I am against
[39:53] brother Brham or against the message or
[39:56] any any of that stuff. And and it was
[39:58] just it was one thing after the next
[40:00] after the next. And the only really I
[40:03] couldn't really get in a word, but the
[40:04] only word that I could get in was the
[40:07] same God that wrote this Bible from
[40:10] Genesis to the re to Revelation. The
[40:12] same Holy Spirit that anointed those
[40:14] people is the same Holy Spirit that can
[40:15] anoint me to preach from the same word.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; And then and I don't need to read a
[40:21] quote. I don't need to do those things.
[40:23] And then it came out again. You need to
[40:26] tell your people. You need to tell your
[40:28] congregation how you believe.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; Now you know.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; No, that's I just did. But they were
[40:38] they were accu he was accusing me of
[40:41] this. And friends, this spirit is real.
[40:45] And this spirit is nothing new.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; This is an attacking, hateful spirit.
[40:51] John Hus. Anybody know who John Hus was?
[40:54] Hundreds and hundreds of year of years
[40:56] ago. He was burned at the stake for the
[40:58] Catholic Church for what? Saying that
[41:00] the common people should have a Bible.
[41:03] Saying that saying that the common
[41:04] people should be able to that the common
[41:07] people can understand the word. John
[41:10] Wickliffe, his body was exumed out of
[41:12] the grave, burned and thrown into the
[41:15] river, excommunicated after he's dead as
[41:18] a sign of disrespect. Why? because he
[41:21] wanted the people to have a Bible. And
[41:23] he translated the Latin Vulgate, which
[41:26] by the way, the original the the
[41:28] Catholic Bible, the Latin Vulgate, you
[41:29] know why it was written Latin? Because
[41:31] nobody spoke Latin,
[41:34] only the educated people.
[41:38] John, all he had, Mr. Wickliff, all he
[41:40] had was that Latin Vulgate. He took it
[41:43] and he translated into English for the
[41:46] people.
[41:47] excommunicated
[41:49] his ashes thrown into the river. Martin
[41:52] Luther translated the Bible into German.
[41:56] He had the Protestant belief of solar
[41:59] scriptor, the belief that scripture
[42:01] alone is the supreme authority in all
[42:04] matters.
[42:06] The salvation and that salvation comes
[42:08] from faith in Christ alone and not from
[42:11] church authority.
[42:13] Martin Luther.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; This drove the Protestant, this started
[42:19] the Protestant reformation.
[42:22] And the Catholic Church, what did they
[42:23] do? They excommunicated him. William
[42:25] Tendale, the leader of the Protestant
[42:27] Reformation about the same time as
[42:29] Martin Luther.
[42:32] He started the Reformation in England.
[42:34] He translated the Bible from the
[42:36] original Greek and Hebrew text for the
[42:40] first time in history
[42:42] into English. William Tenddale is one of
[42:45] my favorite people that's ever lived.
[42:47] The King James Bible that we read right
[42:50] now
[42:53] came as a result of William Tendale.
[42:55] They took his manuscripts, his Bible,
[42:58] and the words are 83% the same in the
[43:01] New Testament and 76% the same in the
[43:04] Old Testament as Tendale's original
[43:06] Bible. It was excellent.
[43:09] He was tried for Lutheran heresy
[43:14] and burned at the stake for teaching
[43:15] that a common man could read and
[43:17] understand the Bible just as well as the
[43:20] priests.
[43:21] Solah scriptor. The Bible is the
[43:25] absolute.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Think of this. This spirit over
[43:32] 150 million all the way up to 168
[43:36] million. One one stat that I found
[43:40] people were murdered because they said
[43:44] that you can understand the Bible
[43:47] yourself.
[43:50] You can read it and you can understand
[43:52] it. You don't need somebody to teach it
[43:54] to you.
[43:56] Murderedund over 150 million.
[44:03] Can you believe? And here is the same
[44:06] spirit
[44:08] saying, "You can't do it. Pastor,
[44:13] you need to confess to your people that
[44:15] you think that you can understand the
[44:18] Bible without brother Brandham teaching
[44:20] you." And then if I say no, the Holy
[44:24] Spirit, same Holy Spirit was on brother
[44:25] Brandham can anoint me to read this
[44:28] Bible and to teach my congregation. You
[44:30] hate Brother Brandham. You're against
[44:32] him. You're against the message. No,
[44:35] that's a lie.
[44:37] That's false.
[44:40] But do you see the same spirit
[44:44] that would put somebody burn them at the
[44:46] stake
[44:48] because they said no.
[44:51] Joe
[44:53] the common man
[44:55] can take this Bible he can read it and
[44:57] he can understand is that same spirit
[45:00] friends that's in today and that spirit
[45:03] crept in
[45:06] to the church
[45:08] sister Elizabeth you remember telling
[45:10] you remember telling me that something
[45:11] happened something was wrong that's what
[45:14] it was was here
[45:17] and it's this spirit of
[45:20] You have to have something else. You
[45:23] have to have Jesus plus something else.
[45:26] That is false. That is that it's it's
[45:30] completely wrong. And it's it's not that
[45:32] they don't like me.
[45:37] I mean, nice guy, good looking, cool
[45:39] beard.
[45:41] It's not that nice haircut. Manny says
[45:45] it's not that they don't like me.
[45:48] They hate what I stand for.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Even a Christian, these people, 150
[45:55] million Christians that were put to
[45:56] death were put to death by other
[45:58] Christians.
[46:01] And that hated, that hatred spirit is
[46:03] still here. Friends, let me tell you
[46:06] something. If you never get anything
[46:08] from me, open your Bible and read it.
[46:12] And if you don't understand it, get on
[46:15] your knees and pray
[46:17] &gt;&gt; and ask the Lord and he will reveal it
[46:20] to you.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, listen to the prophet. Yes, do do
[46:25] um live live right and and do the good
[46:27] things. Yes, do those things. But if
[46:30] somebody tells you you have to have
[46:32] something else, that is a false doctrine
[46:36] that John Hus, John Wickliffe, Martin
[46:38] Luther, um, uh, William Tendale, Brother
[46:42] Brandham, they all stood against it.
[46:46] It is a false doctrine
[46:48] &gt;&gt; that and it what it is it's it's the
[46:52] name of Jesus
[46:54] and it's always
[46:58] hated that that name is hated. They may
[47:01] not say it. My brother Adam talked to
[47:05] him yesterday and he said, "Hey, I want
[47:07] to give you testimony." So he was he was
[47:09] teaching Bible study. This kid shows up.
[47:10] I think he was like 10 years old. He
[47:12] shows up to the to the Bible study and
[47:16] he said, "Adam's like, man, we had all
[47:17] kinds of people there." And this little
[47:19] guy, he liked it. He never been to
[47:21] church before in his life, you know,
[47:23] rough poor kid inner city. And so
[47:27] afterwards, Adam goes up to him and he
[47:29] talks to him and the kid says, "Hey, can
[47:32] you buy me a McDonald's?"
[47:34] I was like, "Yeah, okay, whatever. Come
[47:36] on, let's go." And they go across the
[47:38] street to McDonald's and he's gets a
[47:40] McFlurry. I think Adam said something
[47:42] else. And and the boy looked at Adam and
[47:46] he said, "Uh, you're a preacher." He
[47:49] said, "When I grow up, I want to be a
[47:51] preacher." And Adam said, "Why?"
[47:55] He said, "Because I want to change the
[47:58] world."
[48:00] And and Adam said, "Really?" And you
[48:04] know that they tell the kids in school,
[48:07] you can do anything that you want. you
[48:09] can be a president of the United States.
[48:12] You can change the world. You can do
[48:14] anything. And they pump you up. And then
[48:17] Adam says, so this kid's used to hearing
[48:19] that all the time. Adam says to him, he
[48:21] says, "You can't change the world."
[48:24] And the kid's like, "I haven't heard
[48:27] that one before." And Adam said, "But I
[48:30] can introduce to you to someone who
[48:31] can."
[48:34] &gt;&gt; And he talked to him about the Lord.
[48:38] I talked to a lady a couple days ago,
[48:42] your mom, Phillip, and trying to help
[48:45] her get into a house and uh she was
[48:48] telling me some stuff uh about their
[48:50] needs and she knew I was a pastor and
[48:53] she told me, she said, "We've been
[48:55] trying to serve God and she talked about
[48:57] her mom and we talked about the Lord a
[49:01] little bit
[49:04] and when I mentioned the name of Jesus,
[49:08] I just told her, I said, "Jesus cares
[49:12] on the phone." She broke down
[49:15] and it was the sweetest thing. And it
[49:17] was that name.
[49:19] There is something about that name that
[49:22] just it brings out it brings out love.
[49:25] It brings out it brings out emotion
[49:28] because it's a powerful name. There's no
[49:30] other name. It's the name of Jesus
[49:33] Christ and him alone. And it brings such
[49:36] a a response. I was witnessing to a lady
[49:40] when I was in Louisville and she was
[49:43] right next door to where we were going
[49:44] to have the event and I went over to her
[49:47] and I said, "Hey, how's it going? We're
[49:48] going to have an event over here." She's
[49:49] like, "Oh, okay, good." And uh she
[49:51] wasn't doing much. She was just feeding
[49:53] the dog or um out in her backyard. And I
[49:56] said, "Uh, hey, can I tell you a story
[49:58] about Jesus?"
[50:00] And she says, "I don't want to hear it."
[50:03] She says, "I don't want to hear that."
[50:04] He says, she says, I I don't you just be
[50:06] quiet. You just go and do your way. It
[50:09] that name brought up an emotion in her.
[50:15] It always does because it's God's name.
[50:18] The Muslims, they believe that Jesus was
[50:21] born of a virgin.
[50:24] And they call him one of the greatest
[50:25] prophets in history. The Muslims do. But
[50:29] the religious ones will kill someone who
[50:31] claims to believe in Christ.
[50:33] Why is that?
[50:36] In 2015,
[50:38] 20 migrant workers from Egypt were taken
[50:40] captive by ISIS while they were working
[50:42] in the country of Libya.
[50:45] Is ISIS released a propaganda video
[50:48] titled a message signed with blood to
[50:50] the nations to the nation of the cross.
[50:52] The video showed the men in orange
[50:54] jumpsuits paraded along a beach and then
[50:57] beheaded one by one.
[51:00] As they were killed,
[51:02] many cried out. Many cried out, "Yabasu,
[51:06] oh Lord Jesus."
[51:10] What is it about that name
[51:13] that this group over here would claim
[51:16] Jesus and yet hate this group over here
[51:19] that also claims Jesus so much that they
[51:21] would kill them?
[51:24] It's what is it about that name? It is
[51:27] Satan's goal to have your eyes on
[51:31] anything other than Jesus Christ.
[51:35] Anything.
[51:37] Me,
[51:38] mom, dad, brother Brandham, Brother
[51:41] Green, anyone
[51:45] to put that person between you and Jesus
[51:48] is Satan's goal,
[51:51] not transfiguration. Let's let's get
[51:53] into the scriptures. um Luke chapter 9
[51:56] verse 28
[51:58] and it reads like this.
[52:02] And it came to pass about and 8 days
[52:05] after these sayings, he took Peter and J
[52:07] and John and James and went up unto a
[52:10] mountain to pray. And as he prayed, the
[52:12] fashion of his countenance was altered,
[52:14] and his raignment was white.
[52:19] and his reignment was white and
[52:22] glistening.
[52:24] And behold, there talked with him two
[52:27] men, which were Moses and Elias,
[52:32] who appeared in glory, and spake of his
[52:35] deceased, which he should accomplish at
[52:37] Jerusalem. But Peter and they that were
[52:40] with him were very were heavy with with
[52:44] sleep. And when they were awake, they
[52:47] saw his glory and the two men that stood
[52:50] with him. Can you imagine if you saw
[52:52] that
[52:53] Jesus shining and two men who you
[52:57] somehow recognized as Moses and Elijah.
[53:01] And it came to pass as they departed
[53:04] from him, Peter said unto Jesus,
[53:06] "Master, it is good for us to be here,
[53:09] and let us make three tabernacles, one
[53:12] for thee, and one for Moses, and one for
[53:14] Elias." Not knowing what he said.
[53:18] Elijah,
[53:21] one of the most obedient and dedicated
[53:22] prophets in the whole Bible, Moses,
[53:25] probably the most powerful prophet that
[53:28] has ever lived.
[53:31] Lord, let's make three tabernacles.
[53:34] Let's honor these two prophets and let's
[53:36] honor you.
[53:38] Jesus didn't have to stand for himself
[53:40] on this one. And while he yet he thus
[53:45] spake, there came a cloud and
[53:48] overshadowed them. And they feared as
[53:51] they entered into the cloud. And there
[53:53] came a voice out of the cloud saying,
[53:56] "This is my beloved son. hear him.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; No, not these other ones. They pointed
[54:06] to him.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; And when the voice was passed, Jesus was
[54:12] found alone.
[54:14] And they kept it close and told no man
[54:17] in those days any of those things which
[54:20] they had seen. Peter wanted to honor all
[54:23] three of them. He wanted to give honor
[54:25] to Moses. He wanted to give honor to
[54:26] Elijah. And both are both are actually
[54:29] prophesied to return in Revelation 11.
[54:33] But God is warning on all of us. Don't
[54:36] focus on those two men right there. As
[54:39] plain as you can read it in the
[54:40] scriptures, don't focus on them. Focus
[54:43] on Christ. Jesus is different than
[54:45] anyone else. the apostles and prophets,
[54:47] evangelists, pastors, teachers, they
[54:49] should focus every word on him
[54:55] as do all the sermons really in the New
[54:57] Testament. Everyone is focused on one
[55:00] man.
[55:02] I um I want to um
[55:07] explain this a little further. Moses,
[55:10] come here. Help me for a minute. Come on
[55:11] up.
[55:20] buddy right here. Could you stand right
[55:21] here? Could you hold that picture of
[55:23] Jesus up?
[55:30] Good job.
[55:33] He said, "Thank you. You, too,
[55:38] friends. Here's a prophet of God." All
[55:41] right.
[55:43] this prophet,
[55:45] this Christian, this pastor, whatever it
[55:48] might be, his job
[55:51] is to point to this person.
[55:54] And if you put it in front here, that is
[55:58] the best Christian in the world that you
[56:00] don't see. You don't see me, you just
[56:03] look right through me
[56:06] to Jesus.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; That is what they've all done. That is
[56:10] the greatest thing. But
[56:14] we
[56:18] [snorts] will.
[56:32] We will take things.
[56:41] No, you need to look at you need to look
[56:43] at these things first.
[56:45] And do you see it obscures
[56:49] it obscures that that man?
[56:52] And then well, I'm going to do I'm going
[56:55] put some more stuff here. And you have
[56:58] to look through this stuff. You have to
[57:00] look all through all of this before you
[57:02] can see him.
[57:04] Do you see all of this stuff? It
[57:06] obscures Jesus.
[57:08] The best servant [snorts]
[57:15] is as clear of a glass as you can be.
[57:21] That is the best servant. Now you and I,
[57:25] we wake up in the morning and we say, "I
[57:29] want to be a Christian. I want to I want
[57:31] to serve God. I wanna I I I want I want
[57:35] to point people to Christ. And then you
[57:40] drink some alcohol.
[57:45] And then
[57:47] over here you lose your temper.
[57:51] And then over here you want to lift
[57:54] yourself up maybe on social media.
[57:59] And all of this
[58:01] obscures that picture, that man.
[58:06] And that is what we should be, friends.
[58:08] We should not be, none of this stuff
[58:11] should be going on in our lives. The
[58:13] cleaner that this slate is,
[58:16] the more that people will see that man
[58:19] through us.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother Moses.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; I will take that.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[58:34] &gt;&gt; All of our many of our doctrines,
[58:38] many of the things that that we say,
[58:43] does it put a mark in front of Jesus?
[58:48] As I said, lose your temper a little
[58:50] bit, pass on a message,
[58:54] write a little bit of a criticism,
[58:58] it it obscures this man. The best
[59:02] servant of God is the one that that
[59:05] glass is completely clear.
[59:11] and criticism
[59:13] that
[59:14] we receive.
[59:20] It should be because we stand for
[59:22] Christ. I have a few minutes left. I
[59:25] want to talk about this man, Stephen.
[59:28] Stephen was a deacon
[59:31] and he was a uh
[59:35] a real man of God in the book of Acts. I
[59:37] believe they had seven deacons. And
[59:39] Stephen was probably the most famous of
[59:42] all of them.
[59:44] And let's go to Acts chapter 6:8. And
[59:47] we'll close with this. And Steven full
[59:49] of faith and power did great wonders and
[59:51] sign among the people. And there arose
[59:53] some from what is called the synagogue
[59:55] of the freed men, the Sirenes,
[59:57] Alexandrians, and those from Celicia and
[1:00:00] Asia,
[1:00:01] disputing with Stephen. and they were
[1:00:04] not able to resist the wisdom and the
[1:00:06] spirit by which he spoke. Then they
[1:00:09] secretly induced men to say, "We have
[1:00:12] heard him speak blasphemous words
[1:00:14] against Moses
[1:00:16] and against God."
[1:00:19] And they stirred up the people and the
[1:00:20] elders and the scribes, and they came
[1:00:23] upon him and seized him and brought him
[1:00:25] out, brought him to the council. And
[1:00:27] they also set up false witnesses who
[1:00:29] said, "This man does not cease to speak
[1:00:31] blasphemous words against this holy
[1:00:33] place and the law. For we have heard him
[1:00:37] say that Jesus of Nazareth will destroy
[1:00:39] this place and change the customs which
[1:00:42] Moses delivered to us." And all who sat
[1:00:45] in the council, looking steadfastly at
[1:00:47] him, saw his face as it was the face of
[1:00:51] an angel. So the glass in this deacon
[1:00:55] was pretty clear.
[1:00:58] They weren't seeing Stephen there. They
[1:01:00] were seeing what was behind him.
[1:01:04] Then the high priest said, "Are these
[1:01:07] things so?" So then Stephen goes on to
[1:01:10] preach really one of the best sermons
[1:01:12] that are in in the entire Bible. He goes
[1:01:14] back through history. He shows Abraham
[1:01:16] and Isaac and Jacob and Joseph and and
[1:01:19] he he it takes all of their ministries
[1:01:23] for and shows that they were for one
[1:01:25] collective purpose. And then Stephen
[1:01:27] gets to Moses
[1:01:29] who they just accused him of not
[1:01:31] believing.
[1:01:34] And he says Moses was beautiful in God's
[1:01:36] sight, mighty in his words and deeds.
[1:01:40] And he supposed the people would
[1:01:42] understand this but they didn't
[1:01:43] understand.
[1:01:44] Verse number 37,
[1:01:47] Stephen says this. This is that Moses
[1:01:50] who said to the children of Israel, "The
[1:01:52] Lord your God will raise up you a
[1:01:55] prophet like me from your brethren. Him
[1:01:59] you shall hear."
[1:02:01] He's saying that this one that Moses
[1:02:04] Moses spoke of this one. This one,
[1:02:09] this is he who was in the congregation
[1:02:11] in the wilderness with the angel who
[1:02:12] spoke him spoke to him on Mount Si and
[1:02:15] with our fathers the one who received
[1:02:18] the living oracles to give to us whom
[1:02:21] our fathers would not obey but rejected
[1:02:23] and in their hearts they turned back to
[1:02:26] Egypt. So he's speaking to the same
[1:02:27] people who kept every law of Moses and
[1:02:31] he and and then they put Moses forward
[1:02:34] instead of this man.
[1:02:37] And then a little later
[1:02:40] Stephen says this verse number 51. You
[1:02:42] stiff neck and uncircumcised in the
[1:02:43] heart and ears. So it's okay to stand
[1:02:45] up.
[1:02:47] You always resist the Holy Spirit as
[1:02:49] your fathers did. So do you. Which of
[1:02:51] the prophets did your fathers not
[1:02:53] persecute? and they killed those who
[1:02:56] were foretold who foretold the coming of
[1:02:58] the just one of whom you now have become
[1:03:01] the betrayers and murderers who have
[1:03:03] received the law by the direction of the
[1:03:05] angels and have not kept it. Then when
[1:03:07] they heard these things they were cut to
[1:03:10] the heart and they nashed at him with
[1:03:12] their teeth. You see what the name of
[1:03:14] Jesus produces?
[1:03:17] and they nashed at him with their teeth.
[1:03:26] But he being full of the Holy Spirit
[1:03:28] gazed into heaven and saw g the glory of
[1:03:30] God and Jesus standing at the right hand
[1:03:32] of God and said, "Look, I see the
[1:03:36] heavens open and the Son of Man standing
[1:03:39] at the right hand of God."
[1:03:42] Now watch what pointing to Jesus does.
[1:03:46] Then they cried out with a loud voice
[1:03:48] and stopped their ears and ran at him
[1:03:50] with one accord. And they cast him out
[1:03:52] of the city, and they stoned him. And
[1:03:55] the witnesses laid down their clothes at
[1:03:57] the feet of a young man named Saul. And
[1:03:59] they stoned Steven as he was calling on
[1:04:02] God and saying, "Lord Jesus, receive my
[1:04:05] spirit."
[1:04:07] Then he knelt down and cried out with a
[1:04:09] loud voice, "Lord, do not charge them
[1:04:12] with this sin."
[1:04:14] And when he had said this, he fell
[1:04:16] asleep.
[1:04:18] And the musicians can come. Do you see
[1:04:23] what?
[1:04:24] On one side, the name of Jesus and
[1:04:27] preaching Christ studs, it produces
[1:04:29] hatred and it produces persecution.
[1:04:34] But on the other side, what does it
[1:04:36] produce? It produces love. It produces
[1:04:40] patience
[1:04:42] to the point where Stephen said the same
[1:04:44] thing that Jesus said when he was on the
[1:04:46] cross. Stephen, as I said, was a deacon.
[1:04:51] He had a wife. He had children.
[1:04:54] You didn't see Stephen crying out that
[1:04:57] the Lord would pro protect his wife
[1:05:00] after he died. You didn't see him crying
[1:05:02] out that he would that the Lord would
[1:05:04] protect his children.
[1:05:06] He was crying out that the Lord would
[1:05:08] have mercy on those that were killing
[1:05:10] him.
[1:05:12] That's the spirit of Christ.
[1:05:14] It's Jesus in the biatitudes
[1:05:18] talking about these preaching these
[1:05:21] things that he preached. It didn't sound
[1:05:22] right, but it produces this same spirit
[1:05:26] that this man Stephen had. Friends, do
[1:05:28] you see why it's so important
[1:05:31] for me
[1:05:33] that you can read this Bible and that
[1:05:36] you can understand it and that you can
[1:05:39] put your confidence in it and take these
[1:05:42] words of Jesus as we preach on as I
[1:05:46] preach on this sermon on the mount and
[1:05:48] the things that he said and apply them
[1:05:50] to your life
[1:05:53] because that's what's real.
[1:05:55] and then all of the other stuff. That
[1:05:58] doesn't mean that you or I are against
[1:06:01] anyone. Stephen wasn't even against the
[1:06:04] ones that were murdering him. He prayed
[1:06:07] for them.
[1:06:09] But this spirit of Christ, it produces
[1:06:12] love and it produces acceptance and it
[1:06:15] condemns the gossip and the hatred and
[1:06:18] the problems that are in the church.
[1:06:20] takes it out of your life
[1:06:23] to where you we could be like this man
[1:06:26] Steven. Can you imagine?
[1:06:29] They said they condemned him. They said
[1:06:33] you blasphemed Moses, somebody Stephen
[1:06:36] loved. He his sermon, most of his sermon
[1:06:39] was about Moses.
[1:06:42] He had the big bigger part of the of the
[1:06:44] sermon more than anyone else.
[1:06:47] And then they they tried to they did
[1:06:49] kill him
[1:06:51] because
[1:06:53] he said Moses that Jesus was higher than
[1:06:55] Moses. And it produced this hatred.
[1:07:00] It produced a killing spirit.
[1:07:03] Do you see how it was in the in the dark
[1:07:06] ages
[1:07:08] about how these men, they said, "No, you
[1:07:10] can have the Bible. You can understand
[1:07:12] it." They weren't against anyone. They
[1:07:15] were saying that you need to have it.
[1:07:19] You need to accept this man Jesus
[1:07:21] Christ.
[1:07:23] They were crying out and what happened?
[1:07:24] They were burned at the stake.
[1:07:28] Heads were cut off.
[1:07:31] And it's the same spirit that we see
[1:07:34] now. And it is so common
[1:07:39] saying you need something else
[1:07:44] to be in front of that man.
[1:07:48] What this should be is this should just
[1:07:51] magnify that man.
[1:07:54] That's a true servant of God. Not saying
[1:07:57] that you need anyone else. Not saying
[1:07:59] that you have to believe in a certain
[1:08:01] way other than Jesus Christ is your
[1:08:04] savior. And then as you believe that
[1:08:08] you'll get it.
[1:08:12] [applause]
[1:08:14] Those doctrines
[1:08:16] will come
[1:08:18] and then you'll see, oh wow, I shouldn't
[1:08:21] have cut that guy off in traffic. I just
[1:08:23] broke what Jesus said.
[1:08:26] you'll see that I shouldn't have said
[1:08:28] that about that sister.
[1:08:31] He said, "Don't say nothing. Go straight
[1:08:33] to that straight to her first before you
[1:08:36] tell anyone." Imagine if we did that.
[1:08:40] We would there would be so few problems
[1:08:42] in the world. If I had a problem with
[1:08:44] one of you and I just went straight to
[1:08:47] you and I try to do that
[1:08:49] and then it just set at ease and it's
[1:08:52] like, "Oh, I was wrong. I I I had this
[1:08:55] all made up in my mind. And then you go
[1:08:57] to that person, that person says, "Oh,
[1:08:59] no. You know, I shouldn't have said
[1:09:00] that. I I'm sorry. Oh, okay. It's it's
[1:09:02] gone." And the good thing is I never
[1:09:04] told anybody.
[1:09:06] It's just between me and that person.
[1:09:08] Jesus was so wise.
[1:09:10] Instead of getting on the phone
[1:09:14] and firing out all of these these these
[1:09:17] accusations and all of this, just go to
[1:09:20] that person.
[1:09:22] If that would have happened, then the
[1:09:25] church wouldn't have been in the mess
[1:09:26] that it's been in the past week.
[1:09:29] But now it's over. It's over with me.
[1:09:33] I'm I'm grateful to God for for
[1:09:39] a manual that I can follow
[1:09:43] and handle every single situation,
[1:09:45] right?
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Everyone.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; If I would just if I would just give in,
[1:09:50] if I would just surrender to this
[1:09:52] You know what this is?
[1:09:55] In the beginning was the word and the
[1:09:58] word was with God and the word was God.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; And then the word was made flesh and
[1:10:04] dwelt among us.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; You don't need anything else.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; And here I am. I'm not being a
[1:10:15] hypocrite. I'm preaching to you because
[1:10:17] I want I want to point you to him.
[1:10:20] I want you to get to him.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean that we shouldn't have
[1:10:23] preachers. It doesn't mean that we
[1:10:25] shouldn't have prophets to set us
[1:10:28] straight. It doesn't mean that by the
[1:10:31] grace of God, we have that.
[1:10:34] But don't let it obscure that man. Are
[1:10:37] you with me? Are
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; we together? Praise God. Brother Josiah,
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; what
[1:10:50] a friend we have in Jesus.
[1:11:00] All our sins and griefs to bear.
[1:11:09] Oh, what a privilege
[1:11:14] to carry
[1:11:20] everything
[1:11:23] to God [singing]
[1:11:25] in prayer.
[1:11:27] Oh, what peace.
[1:11:31] Oh,
[1:11:33] what peace we often
[1:11:37] forfeare.
[1:11:42] Oh,
[1:11:44] what needless
[1:11:46] pain we [singing] bear.
[1:11:54] Oh,
[1:11:56] because [singing] we do not care
[1:12:08] to God in pray.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Friends, today
[1:12:15] can we all be together? Can we all do
[1:12:17] this right here
[1:12:21] and just clean it off?
[1:12:25] You know what that's called?
[1:12:28] That's called repentance.
[1:12:30] Cleaning it off. So then once you get
[1:12:34] that thing really clean, got to be
[1:12:37] perfect, man. I want this thing to not
[1:12:39] have a spot on it.
[1:12:43] Yeah. Right there. This is me. This is
[1:12:47] what I want to be. And then you can see
[1:12:50] right through that at that man, Jesus
[1:12:52] Christ. Can we do that?
[1:12:56] [applause]
[1:13:03] Really do it. Let's repent. Say, "Lord,
[1:13:08] I'm sorry. I've done wrong here. This I
[1:13:12] got this black mark and this red mark
[1:13:14] and this green mark. I'm gonna wipe all
[1:13:16] of this off and then I want to be that
[1:13:20] glass that you can see that everybody
[1:13:22] can see right through and see that man
[1:13:24] Jesus. Amen. Let's all stand.
[1:13:28] Have
[1:13:30] we trials and temptations?
[1:13:40] Is
[1:13:41] there trouble
[1:13:44] anywhere?
[1:13:46] [singing]
[1:13:50] We
[1:13:52] should [singing]
[1:13:53] never be discouraged.
[1:14:01] Take
[1:14:03] it to the Lord in prayer.
[1:14:12] Can
[1:14:14] we find a friend so faithful?
[1:14:23] Who
[1:14:25] will all our sorrow share?
[1:14:34] Jesus
[1:14:36] knows our
[1:14:39] prerequised
[1:14:46] [music]
[1:15:03] midst. Thou would all our burdens. Thou
[1:15:08] wilt all our burdens bear. May we ever
[1:15:14] Lord be bringing.
[1:15:17] May
[1:15:18] [singing] we ever Lord be bring.
[1:15:25] All to thee in earnest prayer. all
[1:15:30] to thee [singing]
[1:15:31] in earnest prayer. Let's sing. What a
[1:15:34] friend we have in Jesus.
[1:15:38] Oh, what
[1:15:41] a friend we have in Jesus.
[1:15:49] All
[1:15:51] our sins and griefs to bear.
[1:15:59] Oh, what
[1:16:01] a privilege
[1:16:04] to carry
[1:16:10] everything
[1:16:13] to God in prayer.
[1:16:19] Apologies for jumping around.
[1:16:23] Not
[1:16:26] really a really concise sermon. I had
[1:16:29] everything lined out and this is what
[1:16:30] I'm going to say and I'm going to set
[1:16:32] this right and uh I just totally
[1:16:36] chickenened out.
[1:16:38] You know why? Because friends, we are
[1:16:40] together.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; We're a family.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; We love each other. We stand with each
[1:16:47] other and even if one of us gets out of
[1:16:50] line, we stand with that person too.
[1:16:52] Amen.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; We are a church and I believe that we
[1:16:57] are an example of what a church should
[1:17:00] be because of the love that we have for
[1:17:02] one another. It's above everything that
[1:17:05] love that we have. It is it's beautiful.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; As I started this morning, don't get
[1:17:12] defensive.
[1:17:14] Don't don't do it. It'll it'll make you
[1:17:16] fail. And it is. I have to fall in my
[1:17:19] face all the time. And I'm glad that
[1:17:23] that I am able to fall in my face, but I
[1:17:27] want to stop doing it so much.
[1:17:30] Amen.
[1:17:32] Friends, can you wipe the glass off this
[1:17:35] morning?
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Father, we
[1:17:38] thankful. We're thankful for your
[1:17:41] goodness and thankful for the love that
[1:17:43] we have here. And Lord, forgive us.
[1:17:47] Every one of us that are here, forgive
[1:17:49] us for saying things that we shouldn't
[1:17:51] say. And Lord, maybe even having
[1:17:54] thoughts that we shouldn't have. We ask
[1:17:57] your forgiveness, Father. And Lord, may
[1:18:00] the love of Jesus Christ just swell
[1:18:02] within us and bring us together. And
[1:18:06] Lord, we're just grateful. We're
[1:18:08] thankful that we also have coming this
[1:18:12] week, Lord, a a church dedication,
[1:18:16] rededication.
[1:18:18] Lord, it was founded 60 years ago.
[1:18:23] Father, we want to stand strong and
[1:18:26] continue this on. You You've blessed
[1:18:29] this church over those 60 years. You've
[1:18:32] blessed it so greatly.
[1:18:35] And Lord, now we we want those
[1:18:37] blessings. We want a revival.
[1:18:40] Lord, we've seen it over the years now.
[1:18:42] Lord, give us a revival here at Tucson
[1:18:44] Tabernacle. Lord, give us the love of
[1:18:47] Christ. Let it come down and let it be,
[1:18:50] Father. Let it be greater now than it's
[1:18:52] ever been. Yes,
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; we pray.
[1:18:55] Lord, bless this week as we prepare for
[1:18:58] the the weekend meetings next week.
[1:19:01] And father that we ask that your hand
[1:19:04] would be upon each one.
[1:19:07] Lord may healing be within our
[1:19:10] congregation. I pray we love you. We
[1:19:13] thank you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
