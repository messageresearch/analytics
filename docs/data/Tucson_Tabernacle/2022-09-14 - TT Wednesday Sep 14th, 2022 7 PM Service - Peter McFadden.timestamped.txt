[13:07] so
[13:08] we were gone for a few days and i just
[13:10] want to share one little
[13:13] kind of funny thing that happened and
[13:16] but we enjoyed ourselves and
[13:19] we stopped in yellowstone and
[13:22] stopped at the the place there and i i
[13:24] bought a coffee mug just to remember we
[13:26] were in yellow
[13:27] yellowstone and
[13:29] i mentioned to the uh the lady there the
[13:32] cash register that in
[13:36] august of that year
[13:38] uh 50 years earlier we had been there
[13:41] when i was 12.
[13:43] and she looked at me she goes that's
[13:44] amazing because you were here at our
[13:46] 100th anniversary
[13:48] and now you're here at our 150th
[13:51] anniversary
[13:53] and my first thought was man i'm old
[13:57] that's what hit me
[13:59] not planned but
[14:01] we enjoyed ourselves had a good time
[14:03] drove a lot of miles all over the
[14:05] country but it was nice and
[14:06] [Music]
[14:08] what little
[14:09] uh internet we had we were able to make
[14:11] some contact but a lot of times nothing
[14:13] and
[14:14] we had a wonderful time up there now my
[14:16] daughter rachel was supposed to
[14:19] fly home on sunday and i said if you'd
[14:20] like to go with us you could stay with
[14:22] us me and mom would really enjoy that
[14:24] so her boss let her have the time off
[14:26] too and
[14:28] she got to drive quite a bit and it was
[14:30] uh
[14:32] i guess on uh
[14:33] that would have been saturday
[14:35] we were coming down through southern
[14:36] utah heading into northern arizona
[14:39] and we saw a road sign that said
[14:42] no cars oh no vehicles over 30 feet
[14:45] you're going on one of the most
[14:47] dangerous roads
[14:48] and it's partly graveled
[14:51] and we're thinking should we turn around
[14:53] now
[14:54] but we went
[14:56] we go out there and it's 1200 foot drop
[14:59] like this straight down the side of a
[15:02] it was amazing
[15:04] she took the first curve and she said
[15:06] you take over
[15:07] and when she got to the bottom she said
[15:09] i wish i would have done it
[15:11] but to look back but you know the beauty
[15:14] of the variation
[15:15] of god's work
[15:18] as as we went we took all the back roads
[15:20] and things and just just enjoyed
[15:21] ourselves to see the beauty of god
[15:24] oh what a day that will be on the other
[15:26] side amen
[15:28] what a wonderful thing
[15:30] and uh so i told brother peter brother

[37:08] genesis chapter four
[37:12] and we'll go to the fourth
[37:14] verse we'll go to genesis chapter four
[37:16] and verse four
[37:20] just uh a prayer request for
[37:25] for this friday um friday at 6 30 we're
[37:28] planning to have another youth meeting
[37:30] if lord wills
[37:31] and so
[37:32] we just want his way in that and not
[37:35] anything else so if you would pray with
[37:37] me for that i
[37:39] really appreciate that
[37:41] okay
[37:43] genesis chapter 4 and verse 4.
[37:47] it says
[37:48] and
[37:48] abel he also brought
[37:51] of the firstlings of his flock
[37:54] then of the fat thereof
[37:56] and the lord had respect unto abel and
[38:00] to his offering
[38:02] and then let's go to luke 6
[38:05] and 38.
[38:21] it says
[38:22] in verse 38 luke chapter 6
[38:25] jesus speaking
[38:28] a simple commandment
[38:30] one word he says
[38:33] uh let's let's get that up uh luke
[38:36] luke 6 38
[38:39] if we could
[38:43] it says
[38:45] give and it shall be given unto you
[38:48] good measure pressed down and shaken
[38:51] together
[38:52] and running over
[38:54] shall men give unto your bosom
[38:56] for with the same measure that you meet
[38:58] with all it shall be measured to you
[39:00] again
[39:02] amen you may be seated
[39:06] i want to speak for a little bit of time
[39:10] tonight on
[39:11] giving
[39:13] on gifts and giving
[39:15] and
[39:16] i want to speak on
[39:19] giving all that you have
[39:22] and
[39:25] we've all received gifts we know that
[39:28] it's it's a really nice thing a lot of
[39:30] times to receive a gift
[39:32] and probably most of us have given a
[39:34] gift
[39:35] and we know the joy of giving a gift can
[39:37] be
[39:38] even greater than receiving a
[39:40] gift especially if you're giving the
[39:42] gift to somebody that you love
[39:45] and especially if they love you too then
[39:47] then that's like
[39:49] that's the top of the top that's really
[39:50] good gift giving
[39:54] and we look back through history
[39:57] and we see that gift giving
[40:00] is one of the attributes of god
[40:02] and we see that he's the first giver of
[40:05] gifts he's the giver of life
[40:07] the giver of breath
[40:09] he's the giver of the first gift that i
[40:12] could think of to a living man
[40:14] was a woman
[40:16] eve and what a gift
[40:18] well that's a
[40:19] and so those of us that have
[40:21] received
[40:23] a similar gift or blessed
[40:27] but we see that god
[40:29] is showing something about himself
[40:32] everything that he does is good
[40:34] god is good and everything that he does
[40:36] is good and as he
[40:39] displays his
[40:41] in his actions he's displaying his
[40:43] attributes he's giving us an example
[40:46] that as he walks we can walk just like
[40:48] the uh the father walking through the
[40:50] snow and he's making footprints and then
[40:53] the boy comes along and he tries to walk
[40:55] in those same footprints i'm getting a
[40:56] little bit of a ringing
[40:58] up here maybe
[41:00] maybe i just need to talk louder
[41:03] we'll just see what we can do um
[41:07] but now we see
[41:09] we talk a lot about
[41:12] well abel gave a lamb
[41:14] we kind of leave it simple like that
[41:17] but
[41:19] the details of a gift matter and how a
[41:22] gift is given matters and we see
[41:25] when abel gave this lamb he didn't just
[41:27] give any lamb but he gave the first
[41:30] slings of his flock
[41:32] he gave the first and he gave it says he
[41:34] gave him the fat thereof he he picked
[41:36] the one that would be nice and tasty and
[41:39] juicy and that's the one he gave
[41:42] and he didn't just give any any gift
[41:45] and what jesus says then in this
[41:48] commandment in luke where he says to
[41:50] give
[41:51] he doesn't just say give but he says
[41:53] with what measure you meet it shall be
[41:56] measured to you again
[41:57] and so there's different levels of
[41:59] giving
[42:00] you see these pledge drives and they say
[42:02] well for one dollar you can be a bronze
[42:05] giver and then for five dollars you can
[42:07] be a silver but a hundred dollars you
[42:09] can be you can be a gold star giver
[42:13] well
[42:14] there is something
[42:17] to the
[42:18] the different levels of giving
[42:20] is going to determine what your reward
[42:23] is
[42:24] and see
[42:24] the beautiful thing about a gift
[42:27] is that a true gift is a voluntary
[42:29] donation from the heart
[42:31] you're not given a gift to try to buy
[42:33] anything back if if you're doing that
[42:36] then it's not really a gift it's just an
[42:38] attempted
[42:39] purchase transaction
[42:41] but a true gift says i don't have to do
[42:43] this
[42:44] but it is my desire i would love
[42:47] to surrender this thing that means
[42:49] something to me
[42:50] and and bestow it to you
[42:52] and hopefully it'll mean something to
[42:53] you and we know that god loves a
[42:56] cheerful giver the way that we give
[42:59] is important but
[43:01] there's a lot in here
[43:03] about
[43:06] jesus's real teachings on a gift so
[43:09] let's go to mark chapter 12. and verse
[43:12] 41.
[43:14] let's read through this is
[43:16] this is the story that i was really
[43:18] thinking about
[43:21] and this is
[43:23] this is where this thought came from is
[43:25] this story
[43:29] jesus said if you love me you'll keep my
[43:31] commandments i want to know what his
[43:32] commandments are and i want to keep them
[43:34] and so here
[43:36] in luke he said to give and so i want to
[43:38] know how to do that so here in mark it
[43:41] says and jesus sat over against the
[43:44] treasury
[43:45] and beheld how many people cast money
[43:47] into the treasury
[43:50] so one thing we know about jesus is he's
[43:52] watching
[43:54] you coming to church the way you come
[43:55] into church
[43:56] he sees it the way you leave church he
[43:59] sees it the way you sit in church the
[44:00] way you raise your hands what you do see
[44:02] we're all watching each other and oh
[44:04] what's this person that doesn't matter
[44:06] what matters is that jesus is watching
[44:09] and he's noticing he's noticing what
[44:10] we're doing and how we're doing it and
[44:12] he doesn't just see the outside
[44:14] but he sees the heart he sees what is
[44:16] causing you to do this are you just
[44:17] coming out of fear or tradition
[44:20] or are you coming because you love him
[44:22] he's watching us
[44:24] and he sees
[44:26] people
[44:27] how the people cast money in the
[44:28] treasury and many that were rich cast in
[44:31] much
[44:32] and as they were doing it i'm sure they
[44:34] were glad people were watching
[44:36] they loved to hear the the clatter of
[44:38] all those coin and everyone look over
[44:40] whoa
[44:41] that was a lot of coin and they drop it
[44:43] in
[44:44] and we get that way sometimes right we
[44:46] like to come into church and
[44:48] uh look holy and seem holy and
[44:51] everything
[44:53] but that's its own reward
[44:56] is is that the rich have their reward
[44:59] but then there came verse 42
[45:02] there came a certain poor widow and she
[45:05] threw in two mites which make a farthing
[45:09] and then he calls to him his disciples
[45:12] and he says unto them verily i say to
[45:14] you
[45:15] that this poor widow
[45:17] hath cast
[45:19] more in
[45:20] than all they which have cast into the
[45:23] treasury
[45:24] for all they did cast in of their
[45:26] abundance
[45:28] but she of her want did cast in
[45:30] all that she had
[45:32] even all her living
[45:36] jesus noticed this
[45:39] and he used this he didn't just say well
[45:40] that's nice
[45:42] but he said disciples you better see
[45:44] this
[45:45] there's a lesson here
[45:46] there's something that you need to see
[45:48] in this and so what can we see in this
[45:51] well we can see that god notices the
[45:53] widow
[45:55] he notices the one that nobody else
[45:57] notices the one that comes alone the one
[45:58] that's forgotten
[46:01] jesus has not forgotten you
[46:03] he knows that you're here he knows what
[46:05] you're doing he sees though maybe you
[46:07] can only cast in two pennies
[46:09] you say well what does that matter what
[46:11] does it matter if i come at all should
[46:14] just stay home i should just give up
[46:16] doing no use nope
[46:18] god sees you
[46:20] he sees what you put in he sees your
[46:22] heart that you're putting in
[46:26] but i believe
[46:27] there's more to it than that
[46:30] i believe that
[46:32] this caught
[46:34] jesus's eye
[46:36] because this woman this widow woman
[46:41] she had somehow got in this channel
[46:44] where
[46:46] her gift
[46:51] was showing something about god
[46:54] and we always look at this we always say
[46:56] oh well i'm the little widow
[46:59] i'm just the poor one that throws in
[47:01] everything i have and that's about me
[47:04] but i believe in this there was also
[47:07] something more than this that
[47:09] this was showing what jesus was going to
[47:11] do
[47:13] this was showing the one that became
[47:15] poor
[47:16] he was rich
[47:18] but it says for your sakes he became
[47:21] poor
[47:22] he came down and he became so poor
[47:26] that he didn't have a place to lay his
[47:27] head
[47:29] he didn't have
[47:32] didn't have anything
[47:34] but he became so poor
[47:37] to all that he had was his body
[47:41] and then he gave that
[47:43] and then he gave everything
[47:46] then he
[47:47] though he had nothing else he just gave
[47:49] it all and when he died they even
[47:53] cast lots for his clothes
[47:55] he didn't have one possession to his
[47:57] name
[47:58] he had not a not a shirt on his back
[48:01] nothing but he gave it all
[48:03] just like this woman gave it all he
[48:06] threw it all in
[48:10] and what an inheritance we have from
[48:12] that
[48:13] the
[48:14] poorest man
[48:16] that ever died
[48:18] in some ways
[48:20] but all what a richness of the
[48:21] inheritance that was purchased by that
[48:24] giving of everything
[48:26] and i believe he's calling us he's
[48:28] showing the disciples this
[48:30] because there is a call for us to
[48:32] give in great measure
[48:36] we don't have to do it
[48:38] a gift is a voluntary donation from the
[48:40] heart
[48:42] but god loves a cheerful giver
[48:45] and if you love him
[48:47] you'll keep his commandments
[48:50] including
[48:51] to give
[48:58] when we say
[49:00] i want to be like jesus
[49:03] you are saying i want to be the one that
[49:05] gives everything
[49:07] for the ones i love
[49:09] for the for the ones that i know my
[49:11] father is calling me to give for
[49:13] would we really give like that or we
[49:16] just give like these rich people that
[49:18] they've got so much that they can just
[49:21] throw it all in
[49:23] you know which which one are we really
[49:25] we i believe we could stop here i've got
[49:27] a lot
[49:28] a lot of notes but i believe we could
[49:29] just stop here
[49:31] and we could just think
[49:33] in my
[49:35] in my worship of god because when you
[49:37] give a gift to god
[49:39] that's worship
[49:41] you're giving you're saying oh god
[49:43] i know that you don't need anything that
[49:45] i have he talks about that in the bible
[49:47] he he doesn't need a temple built with
[49:50] hands he doesn't need our works
[49:52] but he loves a gift
[49:54] he loves the widow's two mites
[49:57] because he knows where it's coming from
[49:58] it's coming from the heart
[50:00] and so i believe we could just
[50:02] look and say okay let's not just hurry
[50:04] over this let's not just continue on but
[50:07] let's look at our lives
[50:09] how am i
[50:10] giving when god looks down
[50:14] what is he seeing in my life
[50:16] am i throwing in my scraps
[50:22] see the other scripture that really
[50:26] really jumped out to me
[50:28] was this uh let me see if i can find it
[50:30] here
[50:33] it says
[50:38] it's first corinthians 15 and 19.
[50:42] this was the other one that i was really
[50:43] thinking of first corinthians 15 19.
[50:47] and
[50:48] this is paul describing how he's living
[50:52] he's an example to us he's
[50:54] 15 19 first corinthians 15 19
[50:57] it says
[50:59] if in this life only we have hope in
[51:02] christ
[51:03] we're of all men most miserable
[51:08] is that true of us
[51:10] is that how we're living
[51:16] because
[51:17] if we're living by faith
[51:19] if forgiving like this widow gave
[51:23] then
[51:26] we're planting
[51:28] we're putting a seed in the ground and
[51:30] it doesn't make sense
[51:32] unless there's a harvest
[51:35] right but if there's no harvest we're
[51:37] just
[51:37] ostriches with our heads in the sand
[51:39] we're just
[51:40] clueless if we're living
[51:43] like that but
[51:44] but the way
[51:47] the way
[51:48] most christians live is not like this
[51:51] the way most christians live their lives
[51:53] are not miserable whether there's a god
[51:55] or whether there's not
[51:57] because
[51:58] they're not really given everything
[52:01] they're keeping enough back they're
[52:04] hedging their bets enough
[52:06] that even if
[52:07] there's no resurrection
[52:10] still had a pretty good life still had a
[52:11] nice house and car and
[52:14] and vacations and everything
[52:18] and we're not living in such a way that
[52:20] our lives only make sense
[52:23] if there's a resurrection
[52:27] because we're not planting everything we
[52:29] have
[52:30] we're keeping back we're throwing in our
[52:32] scraps we're throwing in our extras i'm
[52:33] talking to myself here this is not an
[52:35] easy thing to
[52:37] to preach
[52:39] because
[52:41] i don't want to be a hypocrite
[52:44] but what i don't want to do is only
[52:45] preach the parts of the bible that i can
[52:47] currently
[52:50] reach i want to keep reaching higher
[52:53] i want to say lord i see it in here and
[52:55] i don't see it here yet
[52:56] but lord i believe it
[52:58] and i believe if you said it there's a
[53:00] way somehow
[53:03] that i can
[53:04] please you by faith
[53:07] that i can walk in and that i can
[53:09] present my body a living sacrifice
[53:13] see god doesn't just want your heart
[53:17] he wants everything
[53:20] he wants all of you
[53:22] and so a lot of us will say okay god you
[53:24] can have
[53:25] my heart but if you really gave him your
[53:27] heart
[53:29] your body would be a living sacrifice my
[53:31] body would be a living sacrifice i would
[53:33] say god it's all yours
[53:36] and i believe that is our heart i
[53:37] believe that's the desire of our heart
[53:39] and i believe that
[53:43] that is what is happening in in around
[53:46] us but sometimes it's good to be
[53:47] reminded of this
[53:48] sometimes we we we are fully
[53:52] sold out but then
[53:53] the devil just tries to get us to grow
[53:56] cold and
[53:58] get us to back slide away from
[54:01] from the intensity of our first love
[54:06] let's just
[54:09] believe and push in and and i believe
[54:12] you know some of you
[54:14] have have been living like this for a
[54:16] long time
[54:18] some of you are very close to to your
[54:20] reward
[54:22] and
[54:24] i think that's a beautiful example i
[54:25] think we can look around to some of our
[54:27] elders and we can see
[54:29] their lives really didn't make sense
[54:33] look into just an earthly lens
[54:36] they gave too much
[54:39] but i believe
[54:41] that god will reward those ones
[54:44] that there will be a great reward
[54:54] see what we have is not a lot
[54:57] what we have is not
[55:00] the ability to
[55:01] to change the world in ourselves
[55:04] but if we'll just give our two pennies
[55:08] god can multiply just like the the boy
[55:10] that gave his lunch
[55:11] a couple fishes couple loaves look what
[55:13] god did with it
[55:15] he's the same yesterday today and
[55:17] forever and if you'll really give him
[55:19] your whole lunch
[55:22] i don't know if it would have worked if
[55:23] he just said well lord i've got one
[55:24] extra fish
[55:26] you can have it
[55:28] but he gave his whole lunch
[55:30] and look what the lord did
[55:32] the lord loves that because
[55:34] once you give
[55:37] he'll take care of you
[55:40] see
[55:41] we're supposed to be living by faith
[55:44] and we work so hard so that we don't
[55:46] have to
[55:47] have faith our
[55:49] our
[55:50] examples are you know work so hard get
[55:52] enough of a retirement that no matter
[55:54] what happens you're gonna be good
[55:56] you're gonna be okay
[55:58] that's not where our confidence should
[56:00] be
[56:02] our confidence is in
[56:03] the one that fed elijah
[56:06] when elijah had given everything right
[56:08] he's all alone he's starving but god fed
[56:11] him with the ravens
[56:14] that's what god wants he doesn't want 90
[56:16] he doesn't want 10
[56:19] he wants you
[56:21] he wants me
[56:23] he wants
[56:25] you to have a faith like the father of
[56:27] faith abraham
[56:30] that son isaac meant more to him than
[56:32] his own life
[56:36] he was old
[56:37] he was near done
[56:39] but that son that was the future that
[56:41] was everything
[56:42] was that son
[56:45] and he was willing to give it
[56:47] he had to be willing to say okay god
[56:50] this is the only thing in my life that
[56:52] really means anything
[56:55] and i'm not just gonna teach him about
[56:56] you and i'm not just going to try to
[56:58] make him
[57:00] the best that i can make him but i'm
[57:01] going to
[57:02] give his life
[57:04] totally to you that doesn't make any
[57:07] sense
[57:08] unless there's a resurrection
[57:10] unless there's a real god
[57:13] and that's how i want to raise my kids
[57:17] is to give them totally to god
[57:20] to teach them to live in such a way that
[57:22] their lives don't make sense
[57:25] there's a resurrection
[57:27] because i do believe
[57:31] there is a resurrection
[57:34] i do believe these are not just stories
[57:36] if they're just stories then just come
[57:37] to church throw in your extra
[57:39] that's fine
[57:41] but if this is real
[57:44] then the only way is to give your all
[57:51] just like
[57:53] the woman with the alabaster box
[57:56] that was the only thing that i know that
[57:57] she had
[57:59] the only glory that she had left was her
[58:01] hair
[58:04] she worshipped
[58:07] she gave it all
[58:10] these are examples for us these are
[58:13] these are just people that
[58:15] were human
[58:17] they didn't have the holy ghost
[58:20] but somehow
[58:21] they had enough faith
[58:23] that it says abraham staggered not at
[58:25] the promise of god
[58:28] how much better of a report can we have
[58:29] who have the blood of the lord jesus
[58:32] who have his spirit
[58:34] but is that our report
[58:37] or do our lives make too much sense if
[58:39] there's no resurrection
[58:42] here's a more recent testimony
[58:45] there's a pastor
[58:47] brother in new york named devon carrion
[58:49] maybe some of you know him
[58:51] and one of the one of the testimonies
[58:53] that i loved from his life
[58:55] is there was a man off the street that
[58:57] ended up at his house just a stranger to
[58:59] him i don't think he was homeless to get
[59:01] a job i don't mean to stay off the
[59:02] street like that but just a stranger
[59:04] there's many people in new york so of
[59:06] course they don't know each other
[59:09] and they were talking
[59:11] and then
[59:12] this brother had to go
[59:14] he came to the end of the evening he had
[59:16] to go across town to his own house
[59:19] something in brother yvonne
[59:22] see brother von cared about this man
[59:26] and brother von
[59:27] says okay well you need to go across
[59:29] town
[59:30] here's the keys to my car
[59:32] why don't you bring it back in the
[59:33] morning
[59:36] that's faith
[59:38] i don't know that i would do that
[59:41] but that man is a believer now
[59:45] i met the man
[59:46] he loves the lord
[59:48] he saw something real
[59:50] he saw somebody that was willing to say
[59:52] here's my car
[59:54] hope you bring it back
[59:57] do we give like that or do we just give
[59:59] the things that we can afford to lose
[1:00:01] we just give the keys to the car that we
[1:00:04] we're okay
[1:00:09] but we walk by faith
[1:00:11] not by sight and god will take care of
[1:00:14] us
[1:00:15] i've never seen the righteous forsaken
[1:00:18] or his seed begging for bread for bread
[1:00:22] if god cares for
[1:00:24] all of his creation won't he care for
[1:00:25] his sons and daughters that are stepping
[1:00:27] out in faith
[1:00:30] i don't know how to live like this but
[1:00:32] we have examples
[1:00:35] and i believe as we
[1:00:37] as we reach out towards the lord
[1:00:39] he'll draw us close to help us
[1:00:42] but i don't believe
[1:00:44] although we're talking about a gift
[1:00:46] we're talking about something that's
[1:00:47] voluntary i believe it is more serious
[1:00:50] than that
[1:00:52] because we see in the story of the rich
[1:00:53] young ruler
[1:00:55] this guy was good
[1:00:57] he was the guy you'd want your kids to
[1:00:59] hang out with and go
[1:01:00] learn to be like this guy i mean he was
[1:01:02] good
[1:01:05] he's the best guy in church
[1:01:07] probably
[1:01:09] he dumped a lot of money in the offering
[1:01:10] maybe he was one of the ones giving when
[1:01:12] the widow came to give
[1:01:15] and i bet he was glad to give his extra
[1:01:17] i bet he was a cheerful giver for the
[1:01:20] extra that he could give
[1:01:22] but when it came down to it when jesus
[1:01:23] said to him you lack one thing
[1:01:26] go thy way sell whatever there has give
[1:01:29] to the poor
[1:01:30] and i shall have treasure in heaven
[1:01:32] come take up the cross and follow me
[1:01:37] he was sad
[1:01:39] he was grieved he had great possessions
[1:01:45] but what was he asking
[1:01:48] was he just asking master everything's
[1:01:51] great is there any extra credit i can do
[1:01:56] when he came his question
[1:02:00] was good master what shall i do that i
[1:02:01] may inherit eternal life
[1:02:06] these are serious things you can't buy
[1:02:07] eternal life we're going to see that
[1:02:09] later
[1:02:11] that once you go and try to buy
[1:02:12] something from the lord
[1:02:17] no no go
[1:02:20] but what god is looking for is obedience
[1:02:26] he's looking for a heart that will
[1:02:28] follow him because
[1:02:29] here's the thing
[1:02:32] that last two words were the most
[1:02:33] important he only heard this other
[1:02:35] sell what you have give to the poor but
[1:02:37] follow me
[1:02:40] follow this
[1:02:48] that's where we ought to be
[1:02:51] lord help us
[1:02:54] there's also one
[1:02:56] a certain man named ananias
[1:03:00] if you read this story
[1:03:04] peter says
[1:03:06] that he lied to the holy ghost
[1:03:09] it doesn't record him actually saying a
[1:03:11] lie
[1:03:12] in acts 5 and 1
[1:03:14] it says a certain man named ananias with
[1:03:16] sapphire his wife sold a possession and
[1:03:19] kept back part of the price
[1:03:21] his wife also being privy to it
[1:03:24] and brought a certain part and laid it
[1:03:26] at the apostles feet
[1:03:28] that's all it says he did
[1:03:33] it doesn't say that he said this is
[1:03:34] everything
[1:03:37] but in his heart
[1:03:40] he was keeping something back
[1:03:43] it cost him his life
[1:03:48] was it worth it
[1:03:51] it's just like achin trying to get this
[1:03:54] little
[1:03:54] babylonian robes and a wedge of
[1:03:56] gold it wasn't worth it
[1:04:01] why do we think it's worth it to hold
[1:04:03] back part of our lives and say god i'll
[1:04:04] give you
[1:04:06] i'll give you
[1:04:07] six hours a week and me sitting in
[1:04:10] church and ten minutes today praying
[1:04:12] isn't that enough
[1:04:17] but he wants us to give everything
[1:04:20] he wants us to really follow him
[1:04:22] and he will provide
[1:04:24] and
[1:04:25] see i don't i don't know that this means
[1:04:27] for all of us to to literally
[1:04:30] sell everything that we have and dump it
[1:04:32] in the box maybe it does
[1:04:34] but i don't know that
[1:04:36] but what's important
[1:04:38] is that we're following the lord
[1:04:40] and we're listening to say lord what
[1:04:42] would you have me do
[1:04:44] because see here here's something that
[1:04:47] we learned from abraham
[1:04:49] is that what was important was the
[1:04:51] willingness to give it all
[1:04:53] it wasn't actually required that he
[1:04:55] killed his son
[1:04:56] but what was required is that he was
[1:04:58] willing to
[1:04:59] and the same thing i believe is required
[1:05:00] to us that maybe it's not actually
[1:05:02] required that we dump it all in the box
[1:05:04] back there
[1:05:05] but i do believe it is required that we
[1:05:07] say lord it's yours
[1:05:10] and the moment you show me to drop it in
[1:05:11] there i'm
[1:05:12] i'm gonna do my best
[1:05:16] see it it's in the heart
[1:05:18] god sees what's in the heart
[1:05:23] see this man ananias
[1:05:26] he had the best church
[1:05:28] i mean his pastor wrote most of the new
[1:05:30] testament wouldn't you like that
[1:05:32] go sit there and oh what does this one
[1:05:34] mean
[1:05:38] and he still died
[1:05:40] because he held back
[1:05:44] i believe if each one of us would just
[1:05:48] say lord it's all yours
[1:05:52] i believe we would see something happen
[1:05:56] and i believe we are seeing that things
[1:05:58] happen
[1:06:00] i believe
[1:06:01] that is the desire of our hearts
[1:06:04] how many of us have been here at the
[1:06:06] altar and said lord
[1:06:08] i surrender all
[1:06:10] i don't believe that we're
[1:06:13] we're
[1:06:13] so far from this i believe that we're
[1:06:15] just forgotten somewhere
[1:06:17] and we start to think oh well this is
[1:06:19] mine
[1:06:21] you know we're just stewards
[1:06:24] we're just entrusted with these talents
[1:06:26] for a little bit of time
[1:06:28] until the master comes back and we say
[1:06:30] lord
[1:06:31] here you go
[1:06:33] my crowns
[1:06:36] are yours
[1:06:38] everything
[1:06:40] is for him
[1:06:47] but this is about more than just putting
[1:06:49] money in a box this is about
[1:06:51] are we giving him all of our
[1:06:53] thoughts that we can
[1:06:56] our attention are we
[1:06:58] are we seeking him early in the morning
[1:07:00] like david said
[1:07:03] early will i seek thee
[1:07:05] are we giving him the leftovers
[1:07:09] this one's preaching to me because i
[1:07:11] like to sleep
[1:07:12] i like to sleep as long as i could
[1:07:16] but i believe it would please the lord
[1:07:18] if i would say lord i want to give you
[1:07:20] the first fruits of my day
[1:07:22] i want to seek you early
[1:07:26] i want to give you my mind while it's
[1:07:29] fresh
[1:07:30] instead of when it's so tired
[1:07:36] i want to give him the first of my love
[1:07:40] in mark
[1:07:41] 12 and 28
[1:07:43] the scribes were asking him what is the
[1:07:46] first commandment of all
[1:07:48] what is the most important thing
[1:07:52] verse 29
[1:07:53] and jesus answered him the first of all
[1:07:56] commandments is
[1:07:57] hear o israel the lord our god is one
[1:07:59] lord
[1:08:01] and thou shalt
[1:08:04] thou shalt love the lord thy god with
[1:08:05] all thy heart
[1:08:07] and with all thy soul
[1:08:09] and with all thy mind
[1:08:11] and with all thy strength this is the
[1:08:13] first commandment
[1:08:15] see that's more than just all your money
[1:08:17] because you can give all your money
[1:08:19] but if you give it without charity it
[1:08:21] profits nothing
[1:08:23] still a sounding brass tinkling symbol
[1:08:26] you can do great works you can go live
[1:08:28] your life for others and and heal people
[1:08:30] and all this stuff and still get to the
[1:08:32] end
[1:08:33] and he says i never knew you
[1:08:38] but if you just
[1:08:41] obey this first commandment
[1:08:44] if you just say lord help me to love you
[1:08:46] like that
[1:08:48] see i was thinking of what i said last
[1:08:50] wednesday where i said oh we ought to be
[1:08:52] twitterpated with him
[1:08:54] you know that's that's kind of strong i
[1:08:55] think well is that really are we
[1:08:56] supposed to be so so in love like that
[1:08:59] i think this is stronger language than
[1:09:01] twitter painted
[1:09:03] love him with all
[1:09:05] our heart
[1:09:06] with all our soul and mind and strength
[1:09:10] that's with everything that we are
[1:09:13] because anything less than that is just
[1:09:17] giving them our
[1:09:18] extras casting in like the rich
[1:09:25] but jesus said want you that are rich
[1:09:29] for you have received your consolation
[1:09:31] people love the
[1:09:33] sermon on the mountain they love the
[1:09:35] blessed are the poor and blessed are the
[1:09:38] meek i mean that part's easy to preach
[1:09:41] your poor thing blessed are you
[1:09:44] what about where it says woe unto you
[1:09:46] that are rich
[1:09:48] huh
[1:09:50] that one's a little harder
[1:09:52] more want you that are full for you
[1:09:54] shall hunger
[1:09:57] don't see that on sweatshirts
[1:10:00] what unto you that laugh now
[1:10:02] for ye shall mourn and weep
[1:10:05] woe unto you when all men shall speak
[1:10:07] well of you
[1:10:09] for so did their fathers to the false
[1:10:10] prophets
[1:10:12] but that's the word of god if we take
[1:10:14] that out
[1:10:15] it's not the gospel anymore
[1:10:17] it's not good news anymore
[1:10:20] it's death
[1:10:30] but godliness with contentment is great
[1:10:32] gain
[1:10:34] it says in first timothy six and six
[1:10:38] if we brought nothing into this world
[1:10:40] and there's a certain we can carry
[1:10:41] nothing out
[1:10:44] having food and raiment let us be there
[1:10:46] with content
[1:10:47] contentment
[1:10:48] amen
[1:10:50] but they that will be rich fall into
[1:10:52] temptation and a snare
[1:10:54] and into many foolish and hurtful lusts
[1:10:56] which drown men in destruction and
[1:10:58] perdition
[1:11:00] for the love of money is the root of all
[1:11:01] evil
[1:11:02] which while some have coveted after they
[1:11:04] have erred from the faith and pierced
[1:11:06] themselves through with many sorrows
[1:11:11] we pay for our own selfishness
[1:11:14] these corruptible things
[1:11:17] the sin and loving corruptible things is
[1:11:19] that it keeps your eyes off christ
[1:11:22] and any separation from god is death
[1:11:25] and so we chase after our own death
[1:11:28] our own destruction when we chase after
[1:11:30] things
[1:11:31] that will take us away from the lord
[1:11:32] jesus
[1:11:36] but the next verse says
[1:11:38] but thou man of god
[1:11:40] how many men of god women of god do we
[1:11:42] have
[1:11:43] and this is for you
[1:11:45] flee these things
[1:11:48] flee these earthly riches
[1:11:51] run from them
[1:11:56] and follow after righteousness
[1:11:59] godliness faith love patience
[1:12:02] meekness
[1:12:04] fight the good fight of faith
[1:12:06] lay hold on eternal life
[1:12:09] it's not a picnic to be a christian
[1:12:12] it's a race it's a battle
[1:12:18] we're unto thou art called and has
[1:12:20] professed professed a good profession
[1:12:22] before many witnesses
[1:12:24] see we make being a christian so boring
[1:12:27] because we don't live by faith
[1:12:31] but it ought to be
[1:12:34] we say lord unless you come through
[1:12:37] i'm in trouble
[1:12:40] that's what that's the kind of boldness
[1:12:42] we should live with
[1:12:44] i say well lord i'm putting myself out
[1:12:46] here
[1:12:48] not to test the lord god
[1:12:51] we don't do that
[1:12:53] but because the way he tells us to live
[1:12:54] is
[1:12:56] is a bold way to live
[1:12:59] it's an offensive
[1:13:01] way to live that we're going we're going
[1:13:03] to go take back what the enemies took
[1:13:05] from us we're not just going to leave
[1:13:07] our loved ones out there
[1:13:09] but we're going to go and fight for them
[1:13:13] and anytime you go into battle you've
[1:13:15] got the possibility
[1:13:17] that things could go very badly
[1:13:19] if you're not taking steps
[1:13:21] that could go very badly
[1:13:24] you're not really
[1:13:26] fighting on the offense are you
[1:13:28] if we're just hiding
[1:13:31] hiding in our safe little lives
[1:13:33] what faith does that take
[1:13:38] but thy seed shall possess the gates of
[1:13:40] the enemy
[1:13:42] there is going to be a people that has
[1:13:44] faith enough to take this word and just
[1:13:46] go
[1:13:47] and say i do believe
[1:13:50] that if i'll just throw my two mites in
[1:13:53] they'll take care of the rest
[1:13:59] dropping down to verse 17 there in first
[1:14:01] timothy 6
[1:14:04] there are some people that are to be
[1:14:06] rich
[1:14:07] that's okay
[1:14:08] it says charge them that be rich that
[1:14:11] are rich in this world
[1:14:12] that they be not high-minded there's a
[1:14:15] way to be a christian
[1:14:16] and have some wealth but it's
[1:14:18] you got to do it the christian way
[1:14:21] that you don't be high-minded that you
[1:14:23] don't trust in these uncertain riches
[1:14:25] but in the living god
[1:14:27] it's on the money still i believe in god
[1:14:29] we trust
[1:14:32] who giveth us richly all things to enjoy
[1:14:38] that they do good that they be rich in
[1:14:41] good works
[1:14:44] ready to distribute willing to
[1:14:45] communicate laying up in store for
[1:14:47] themselves a good foundation against the
[1:14:49] time to come
[1:14:50] that they may lay hold on eternal life
[1:14:53] don't trust in your riches but go and
[1:14:55] lay hold on eternal life that's
[1:14:57] to know him
[1:15:00] to follow him
[1:15:03] that's life eternal
[1:15:10] it's not just about giving a sacrifice
[1:15:12] what we think is pretty that's cain's
[1:15:14] offering
[1:15:16] but it's what's according to this word
[1:15:18] it's worshiping the father in spirit and
[1:15:20] in truth
[1:15:22] it's this obedience that's better than
[1:15:24] sacrifice
[1:15:26] it says and then we always quote that
[1:15:29] we go to obey is better than sacrifice
[1:15:32] and then we'll go to the next one and
[1:15:34] we'll say rebellion is like unto the sin
[1:15:36] of
[1:15:37] witchcraft
[1:15:40] amen
[1:15:41] but the next part of that we leave out a
[1:15:43] lot of times
[1:15:45] it says and stubbornness
[1:15:47] is as iniquity and idolatry
[1:15:54] got to be careful
[1:15:56] got to be pliable
[1:15:58] got to be not so set in our ways
[1:16:01] got to say lord it's all yours
[1:16:03] do you want me to move this way move
[1:16:05] that way
[1:16:06] even if i've been here a while
[1:16:08] maybe i should preach from here for a
[1:16:09] while
[1:16:10] off center
[1:16:11] we want to stay centered in the words i
[1:16:13] think it's good to preach
[1:16:15] from the center of the pulpit but you
[1:16:16] know
[1:16:17] don't be so stubborn
[1:16:19] don't be so sure that the way you've
[1:16:20] always been doing it is the right way
[1:16:27] it's very important how we bring our
[1:16:28] gift it says
[1:16:30] if we bring our gift to the altar
[1:16:34] a great gift a good gift
[1:16:36] the best gift
[1:16:39] and then we remember that our brother
[1:16:40] has ought against thee
[1:16:42] well it's him with the problem i don't
[1:16:43] have ought against anybody huh i just
[1:16:45] love everyone but your brother's got
[1:16:47] ought against you
[1:16:48] things are not right
[1:16:51] it says leave your gift there
[1:16:53] go thy way first be reconciled to thy
[1:16:55] brother and then come and offer thy gift
[1:16:59] god has a way of doing
[1:17:00] things and we can't just go and
[1:17:04] and
[1:17:05] go with our best intentions and and just
[1:17:07] do it our way
[1:17:09] but to obey is better than sacrifice
[1:17:14] it was simon that came and he offered
[1:17:16] them
[1:17:17] money to
[1:17:18] get the gift of
[1:17:20] laying hands on people need to receive
[1:17:22] the holy ghost
[1:17:23] peter said to him thy money perish with
[1:17:25] me
[1:17:26] because those thoughts the gift of god
[1:17:27] may be purchased with money
[1:17:30] now it's neither part nor lot in this
[1:17:32] matter
[1:17:33] for thy heart is not right in the sight
[1:17:34] of god repent therefore this thy
[1:17:36] wickedness and pray god if perhaps the
[1:17:38] thought of thy heart may be forgiven me
[1:17:42] you can't buy
[1:17:43] with our gifts
[1:17:46] then your heart's not right
[1:17:51] but if we will obey that first
[1:17:53] commandment
[1:17:55] and we'll love him with all our heart
[1:17:56] soul mind strength and body
[1:17:58] then how can we not give
[1:18:01] if the spirit of mozart was in you you'd
[1:18:02] write symphonies if
[1:18:04] if monet you paint paintings hitler you
[1:18:07] wage war
[1:18:08] if the spirit of christ is in you
[1:18:11] you'll lay down your life
[1:18:13] for your friends
[1:18:15] so there's no greater love than that and
[1:18:17] god is love and his spirit is the spirit
[1:18:19] of love his spirit is the spirit of
[1:18:21] sacrifice
[1:18:26] we're to take up our crosses daily
[1:18:31] every day it ought to be lord
[1:18:34] let me die for you today
[1:18:36] let me die to my own thoughts my own
[1:18:38] ways the
[1:18:39] stubbornness that i have
[1:18:41] let all that just be crucified today
[1:18:45] that you would be glorified
[1:18:49] that my treasures wouldn't be here on
[1:18:50] earth but they'd be laid up in heaven
[1:18:55] i believe there will be a people that
[1:18:56] lives like that
[1:18:58] i believe when we're talking about the
[1:19:00] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:19:06] we're not looking so much for
[1:19:09] glitter and glamour but we're looking
[1:19:10] for character
[1:19:12] we're looking for sacrifice
[1:19:15] we're looking for love
[1:19:19] so we just
[1:19:20] give our two mites
[1:19:22] and give our all
[1:19:26] and how do we give to god
[1:19:28] is it is it that box is that god's box
[1:19:31] there in the back that's the way that we
[1:19:33] give to god
[1:19:35] we give to god by giving to one another
[1:19:40] if you see your brother in need and you
[1:19:42] shut up your bowels of compassion
[1:19:44] how dwelleth the love of god in you
[1:19:50] jesus said
[1:19:52] as much as you've done it to the least
[1:19:53] of these my brethren you've done it unto
[1:19:55] me
[1:19:56] if you want to give your all to jesus
[1:20:00] give it for your brother your sister
[1:20:03] as much as you've not done this you've
[1:20:05] not done it unto me
[1:20:07] who's my brother
[1:20:09] the samaritan
[1:20:11] your enemy
[1:20:12] the person that can't pay you back
[1:20:15] that's who we're supposed to invite to
[1:20:16] our feasts right it's easy to invite the
[1:20:18] people that can have you over next week
[1:20:22] let's say come on
[1:20:24] i can't i know you can't pay me back
[1:20:26] but i want to give you
[1:20:28] my attention
[1:20:29] i want to hear your talk
[1:20:32] that's how we ought to love
[1:20:35] that's how we know that we love god
[1:20:39] it says
[1:20:42] let's go to first john
[1:20:44] 3
[1:20:45] and
[1:20:47] let's read from 16 down to 24.
[1:20:53] do we give to others
[1:20:55] the first fruits the fat part or do we
[1:20:58] give to others leftovers
[1:21:01] i usually give them leftovers
[1:21:04] but i want to give to them
[1:21:06] like i'm giving it to god let's put that
[1:21:08] 16 it says hereby perceive we the love
[1:21:11] of god
[1:21:14] because he laid down his life for us
[1:21:17] and we ought to lay down our lives for
[1:21:19] the brethren that's strong words
[1:21:22] we don't just lay our lives down for for
[1:21:24] god
[1:21:25] but we lay our lives down for the
[1:21:27] brethren
[1:21:28] so brother sister if it cost me
[1:21:31] everything
[1:21:32] i want to help you
[1:21:34] i want to bless you
[1:21:39] whoso hath this world's good and seeth
[1:21:41] his brother in need
[1:21:42] and shut up shutteth up his bowels of
[1:21:44] compassion
[1:21:46] from him how dwelt the love of god in
[1:21:48] him my little children let us not love
[1:21:50] in word
[1:21:51] neither in tongue oh i love you god
[1:21:53] bless you
[1:21:54] go be hungry
[1:21:57] but indeed and in truth
[1:22:00] and hereby we know that we are of the
[1:22:02] truth
[1:22:03] this is how we know that we've got the
[1:22:05] truth it's not by the revelation that
[1:22:07] makes you
[1:22:08] jump it's by the revelation that makes
[1:22:11] you
[1:22:12] bend down and wash somebody's feet
[1:22:20] this is how we know
[1:22:22] that we are in the truth
[1:22:24] and shall assure our hearts before him
[1:22:27] for if our heart condemn us god is
[1:22:28] greater than our heart
[1:22:30] and knoweth all things
[1:22:33] beloved if our heart condemn us not
[1:22:35] then we have confidence toward god
[1:22:38] and whatsoever we ask we receive of him
[1:22:42] because we keep his commandments and do
[1:22:43] the things that are pleasing in his
[1:22:44] sight see a lot of the reason we don't
[1:22:47] have faith
[1:22:49] to see miracles and to really see the
[1:22:51] sick healed and the dead raised
[1:22:54] because somewhere deep down we know that
[1:22:56] we're not living
[1:22:58] like jesus lived
[1:23:01] and so we can't pray with confidence
[1:23:06] because we know that we're
[1:23:10] our hearts just not right
[1:23:13] it's not about us buying our own
[1:23:15] salvation if we'll believe on him
[1:23:18] it's by grace through faith
[1:23:22] but then comes the holy spirit and does
[1:23:23] this work that lets us
[1:23:25] give our our bodies a living sacrifice
[1:23:29] see
[1:23:30] god didn't just save you to save your
[1:23:32] soul he saved you to save you and
[1:23:35] defeat the works of the enemy deliver
[1:23:37] you from sin
[1:23:38] give you the victory
[1:23:43] don't just look back to past generations
[1:23:45] one of the prophets
[1:23:48] the way the book starts i was just
[1:23:49] reading i forget which one it was
[1:23:51] god says
[1:23:53] i'm i was so displeased with your
[1:23:55] fathers
[1:23:57] they didn't do it right we can't just
[1:23:58] look to the
[1:23:59] church fathers we've fallen from where
[1:24:01] we were
[1:24:02] where the church was in the book of acts
[1:24:06] we don't want to just live as good as
[1:24:08] the methodists did or the baptist did or
[1:24:10] they did in the 60s but we want to live
[1:24:14] like jesus lived because that's how
[1:24:15] peter and paul and them lived
[1:24:19] they all gave their lives except for
[1:24:22] one or two
[1:24:27] see the miracle wasn't just that they
[1:24:29] went and healed some people
[1:24:32] that would be power
[1:24:34] but the power with character led them to
[1:24:37] live their whole lives in such a way
[1:24:40] that they didn't take this healing
[1:24:41] ministry that they had and just build
[1:24:44] themselves kingdoms and castles and nice
[1:24:46] cars and houses like a lot of us would
[1:24:47] do
[1:24:49] but they saw it all the way through
[1:24:52] that they were like jesus
[1:24:54] in the healing
[1:24:55] in the
[1:24:56] preaching in the forgiving
[1:25:00] in the dying
[1:25:02] and they'll be like him in the
[1:25:03] resurrection
[1:25:07] a perfect match
[1:25:14] these are big things to preach
[1:25:16] but i have confidence in his word
[1:25:20] that if his word goes forth
[1:25:22] it's going to accomplish that which is
[1:25:23] said to accomplish if his word comes and
[1:25:25] says give
[1:25:28] i believe that's not just a commandment
[1:25:30] without power
[1:25:32] to fulfill the commandment
[1:25:34] i believe if he tells you to do
[1:25:36] something he's going to make a way to do
[1:25:37] it
[1:25:40] we just got to be willing to give it all
[1:25:43] here's my two mites lord
[1:25:46] where were we
[1:25:47] and this is his commandment verse 23
[1:25:51] that we should believe on the name of
[1:25:54] his son
[1:25:55] jesus christ
[1:25:58] and love one another
[1:26:00] as he gave us commandment
[1:26:03] and he
[1:26:04] that keepeth
[1:26:07] and he that keepeth his commandments
[1:26:08] dwelleth in him and he in him
[1:26:10] and hereby we know that he abideth in us
[1:26:13] by the spirit which he hath given us
[1:26:17] and that spirit's the spirit that
[1:26:20] works those works of god
[1:26:27] do we need that spirit we need to be led
[1:26:29] by the spirit that's
[1:26:30] that's how we know the sons of god as
[1:26:32] those that are led by the spirit those
[1:26:33] that are not so stubborn to keep their
[1:26:36] own ways but those that can be
[1:26:39] can be moved around
[1:26:43] we need wisdom to apply this jesus said
[1:26:45] to be wise as serpents
[1:26:47] harmless as doves
[1:26:51] we need to be led by him very very
[1:26:53] exactly
[1:26:56] when jesus went to the pool bethesda
[1:26:58] there was many sick
[1:27:00] but the father wanted one healed
[1:27:03] so we can't just go and well give
[1:27:05] everything i have to everybody
[1:27:08] no we have to give our all to god
[1:27:11] and he'll show us how to give it to our
[1:27:12] brother
[1:27:14] because if we go and do it in our own
[1:27:15] thinking then we'll be the ones at the
[1:27:16] end of the day say lord we've done these
[1:27:18] miracles these great mighty works jesus
[1:27:20] says well i never knew you
[1:27:24] but if we can abide in him and him and
[1:27:26] us he'll show us
[1:27:28] jesus said
[1:27:30] in john 5 19 verily verily i say unto
[1:27:33] you the son
[1:27:35] it's talking about him but that's
[1:27:36] talking about us right the son can do
[1:27:38] nothing of himself what do you see at
[1:27:40] the father do
[1:27:42] what things so ever he doeth
[1:27:44] these also do with the sun likewise
[1:27:48] we've got to be watching father what are
[1:27:49] you doing
[1:27:50] not what did you do 20 years ago or
[1:27:52] yesterday but lord what are you doing
[1:27:54] today
[1:27:55] let me see you do it and let me do
[1:27:59] what are we it what is he doing
[1:28:01] is that our desire to say lord
[1:28:05] my first objective for today is to see
[1:28:07] what you're doing so that i can do
[1:28:08] likewise
[1:28:11] it's going to be different for each one
[1:28:12] of us we have different lives we have
[1:28:15] different ways to give our all
[1:28:18] but there is a way
[1:28:21] there are many widows in israel in the
[1:28:22] days of elijah he was sent to one
[1:28:25] there's many lepers
[1:28:28] none was cleansed saved naaman
[1:28:34] but if we'll just say lord
[1:28:37] who is it
[1:28:38] what is it lord i'm willing
[1:28:41] he'll move us
[1:28:43] we won't even understand it probably
[1:28:45] won't even know what's happening
[1:28:48] but his will will be done in this earth
[1:28:50] as in heaven
[1:28:53] as long as we're obedient
[1:29:00] see what i want to what i want to see in
[1:29:02] this church
[1:29:03] what i want to see in myself
[1:29:06] is another book of acts
[1:29:09] that says the same thing as the first
[1:29:11] book of acts i don't want the second
[1:29:13] book of acts to be a different story i
[1:29:14] want it to just be the same
[1:29:17] same things in
[1:29:19] in acts 3 6
[1:29:23] then peter said silver and gold have i
[1:29:25] none
[1:29:28] isn't that something
[1:29:31] he didn't have anything
[1:29:35] but he did have something
[1:29:38] given all that you have
[1:29:40] these things that we could have the
[1:29:42] silver and gold that's not really what
[1:29:43] it's about
[1:29:45] but what it's about is what peter had
[1:29:49] such as i have give i thee
[1:29:53] in the name of jesus christ of nazareth
[1:29:55] rise up and walk
[1:29:57] i want to have that
[1:29:59] i want to be able to give that
[1:30:02] and he took him by the right hand and
[1:30:03] lifted him up and immediately his feet
[1:30:05] and ankle bones received strength
[1:30:07] and he leaped up and he leaping up stood
[1:30:10] and walked and entered with him into the
[1:30:11] temple
[1:30:12] walking and leaping and praising god
[1:30:15] and all the people saw him walking and
[1:30:16] praising god
[1:30:18] and they knew that it was he which sat
[1:30:20] for alms at the beautiful gate of the
[1:30:22] temple
[1:30:23] and they were filled with wonder and
[1:30:24] amazement
[1:30:26] at that which had happened unto him
[1:30:35] see the beautiful thing here
[1:30:38] this that was in peter
[1:30:40] that he could give
[1:30:42] this now
[1:30:45] this is something that's welling enough
[1:30:47] inside of him
[1:30:49] this is a fountain
[1:30:52] by christ's poverty
[1:30:54] we've been made rich
[1:30:58] that we can just give and give and give
[1:31:04] if we just empty out the channels
[1:31:07] for just give it all so that the power
[1:31:09] of god can move through us
[1:31:11] that's why we have fruit
[1:31:14] that's why we have water
[1:31:17] it's for the guy sitting
[1:31:19] by the beautiful gate
[1:31:24] that he can see god
[1:31:27] that he can praise god
[1:31:30] i believe if we'll just obey
[1:31:33] so just say yes lord help me lord
[1:31:36] i believe we'll see this
[1:31:40] i believe this is the will of god
[1:31:43] that we love the man sitting outside
[1:31:46] that he'd be healed and that he would
[1:31:48] worship god
[1:31:53] for our musicians would come one last
[1:31:56] scripture
[1:31:59] john 6 and 37
[1:32:01] maybe think well the lord
[1:32:04] wouldn't want my two mites
[1:32:07] i'm too bad
[1:32:12] it says all that the father giveth
[1:32:14] me shall come to me
[1:32:17] though this is a big
[1:32:20] a big thing that seems so hard to get to
[1:32:26] we're not just the giver
[1:32:29] we're the gift we're just the gift
[1:32:33] this is a gift that god has given
[1:32:35] himself
[1:32:36] is this bride just like he gave adam
[1:32:38] this woman
[1:32:40] eve didn't have to say oh well let me
[1:32:43] let me become all this and that she was
[1:32:46] just a gift
[1:32:48] that's what god's doing once again is
[1:32:50] he's pulling a church a bride
[1:32:53] out of the side of christ
[1:32:55] by his own power
[1:32:58] calling her out from the world
[1:33:00] cleaning her up dressing her in his word
[1:33:05] we're the gift
[1:33:07] and god is a good gift giver
[1:33:11] and that which he's given it can't fail
[1:33:15] to come
[1:33:17] and he's not going to refuse that gift
[1:33:19] you are the gift
[1:33:22] that god is giving to himself in christ
[1:33:25] you are the bride
[1:33:28] if you'll be led by the spirit
[1:33:33] if you'll
[1:33:34] give away that rebellion and
[1:33:35] stubbornness and just say yes lord
[1:33:39] then you're that one that the father is
[1:33:41] giving
[1:33:43] and he's the one that does the work
[1:33:44] he'll know why is cast down cast out
[1:33:48] for i came down from heaven not to do my
[1:33:50] own will
[1:33:52] but the will of him that sent me
[1:33:55] and this is the father's will
[1:33:57] which hath sent me
[1:33:59] that of all which he hath given all
[1:34:01] are you in that all
[1:34:05] [Music]
[1:34:08] all that he hath given me i should lose
[1:34:10] nothing
[1:34:12] but should raise it up again at the last
[1:34:14] day
[1:34:16] and this is the will of him that sent me
[1:34:17] that every one which seeth the son
[1:34:20] and believeth on him
[1:34:23] may have everlasting life
[1:34:25] and i will raise him up
[1:34:27] the last day
[1:34:29] i believe we're very near that last day
[1:34:32] i believe as the lord is raising up
[1:34:35] this gift he's not just raising it from
[1:34:37] the dead
[1:34:38] naturally but he's raising us from the
[1:34:40] dead spiritually
[1:34:42] he's raising up a people that for too
[1:34:43] long has been
[1:34:45] asleep and empty
[1:34:47] that they'd be full and awake and that
[1:34:49] they'd
[1:34:50] love the lord their god with all their
[1:34:52] heart and soul and mind and strength and
[1:34:54] body and they love their neighbor as
