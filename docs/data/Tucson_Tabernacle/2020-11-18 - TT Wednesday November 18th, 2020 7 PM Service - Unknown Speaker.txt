exchange it someday for a crown aren't you glad that he took care of all what it would take for that to happen amen he covered it all we have some prayer requests to bring you to your attention while you're standing we'll do it quickly um a friend of ours uh tended brother Robert Figaro service Daniel Alvarez known him since he was a little boy he's been suffering with cancer and he called his mom and she streams the services and she said would you ask brother Aon to ask the church to pray for me I've been I've been going through a hard time Daniel's got to be probably in late 40s somewhere about there now also just got a text here little about 615 that my brother-in-law um Seth Seth SE R's father passed away also in Sierra Vista and um he's the grandpa of my oldest niece and and the family my sister's family and been sick for some years now and he crossed over this evening he had suffered quite time so remember the family the Rus family especially at this time they also attended brother Daniel R's church here in si Vista and then if you had the WhatsApp you saw them my daughter Naomi had requested for a coworker when Naomi managed the bookstore Bea College Sue Nikolai was one of her employees along she was assistant manager and both her parents were put in the hospital in South Dakota a couple days ago and they passed away both on the same day so sue is is having a hard time but I remembered um Sue I got to know her and she would send little gifts over to the family she thought so much of us and and she got to know the whole family and she would make my wife washcloth and different things just send them over and I had asked the Lord if he would be kind to her as she was kind to us so um you know sometimes it's the only God they'll ever see and know is you God in you so remember her and then I spoke with my brother Fred um they had found cancer in his esophagus and he had gotten quite sick the other day just he said I just it's anything I eat now is really troubling me and he got quite sick he called Dad up and he said would you pray for me I just don't feel well and that was between 600 and 7 o' in the evening and my dad told me he says I was listening to a message brother Brandon was and and he got to part in the in the prayer request he said you that are listening maybe hearing this tape or listening in raise your hand and believe right now so Dad did that for my brother and the time my dad was doing that was the same time my brother was receiving his healing he said all the pain that I was just went away so so I got a chance to talk with him a little bit and could hear the nervousness in his voice and all but he said um I know God answers prayer so preci so keep him in prayer also so if you have a need say Lord I have a need whatever it might be God is let's just bow our heads Lord we we come to you not with a a thought well maybe if God will hear me but Lord with an assurance we come by faith you told us only believe all things are possible Lord so we come to the god that is able that has already made a way has already provided all that we have need of these families that are are hurting and suffering Lord and including the Lopez family who just lost their dad and had a conversation with them today Lord as they make plans and what to do as they go forward in life Lord we we know that without without you it's hopeless but in you we have peace and comfort and joy Lord so meet each one Lord each hand raised each need and request Lord and if anything may it draw them closer to you as our prayer Lord for we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen thank you you may be seated so today there was a little bit of mix up the preacher sitting in the back row today because brother Matt gave him next Wednesday but told me brother Peter would be speaking tonight so brother Peter was prepared for next Wednesday so it does happen and then we were wondering where brother Matthew was and brother Matthew I forgot he was supposed to be song leading he was down here earlier so there are days like that so I took my Bible and I told brother Jeremy I said if you'll get this prepared we may go that way I told sister Martha she may be on the piano for a little while I told Sarah she might sing tonight sister Lily and Grace not yet she's giving me a strange look there so no and I just said Lord what what do you want us to do so my Bible opens to Romans 8:28 and says all things happen for a reason so I appreciate the good Lord and his grace and his mercy so now Lord willing and brother Jordan was trying to contact brother darl you were not able to get through to him okay brother darl Ward is supposed to be with us this coming weekend just haven't got a confirmation yet so but I'm going to announce that he's coming and we're going to believe that together all right Sunday morning Sunday evening brother Daryl Ward from brother Donnie Reagan's church it's been the plans it's somebody that personally I had been wanting to come over the last couple years and I talked to him a CLE times and and he was quite busy hard to hard to get you know set up and had them prepared to come and then the co situation come up and had to postpone it so Lord willing brother Daryl will be with us this coming Sunday both services and then next Wednesday night as I spoke with brother Matt we were cancelling the Wednesday night service before Thanksgiving knowing people traveling and all so brother Peter next Wednesday night if you want to come I don't know that anybody will be here so told Brother Peter to be ready tonight cuz he might get called on also brother green used to do something to us and and Sarah if you would prepare sing a song and she'll sing something that you can play she she said she would um brother green would would take us Minister sometimes and we'd meet in his office and he'd look at us and he'd hand us a scripture the four of us five of us that were there they say you got 10 minutes tonight to speak on this scripture or he would say here's a quote tell the congregation what it means to you so you had to be ready so sister Grace was coming in I said sister Grace you better pray somebody's coming in after you because the last one in today has to sing a song special and she said Eunice and your daughter are behind me and she smiled and walked on so I got away with that one but God is mindful of us is he not he's he said I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world so we'll we'll let sing a song and then brother Peter if you would come up after that and just share a testimony share a praise something and then sister Lydia if you would have a song all right cuz you're one that told me I could call on you so I'm taking advantage of it thank you I hope it's okay to say this um I was thinking that my dad was going to call on me I just had a feeling and I thought I'll better have something um to sing and uh I just wanted to mention um how much I appreciate the Lord for giving us songs in the night and that literally means in the night for me I'm often up at night because I suffer with insomnia um from some of the side effects of some drugs I have to take and um when I mean I'm awake in the night I usually am asleep during the day completely so 10:00 at night is good morning to me and um I always appreciate you know it's a very lonely time nobody else is awake I can't talk to anybody I can't do anything you know too loud I live in apartment complex and I do sing a lot through the night and I often think of the Psalms where David says Lord you give us songs in the night and you're aware of us in the night um so this song always has meant much to me because of that so I pray it blesses you and please sing along it's one we all know God leads us along just whatever [Music] key in go ahead play a little [Music] bit in shade green pasture so rich and and so sweet God leads his dear children along where the waterers cool flow BS the wey On's feet God leaves his dear children alone [Music] some through the waters and some through the flood some through the fire but all through the [Music] blood some through great was our but God gives a song in the night season and all the day long have to lower that [Music] key on the M where the sun shine so bright God leads his dear Children Al [Music] sometimes in the valley in darkest of night God leads his dear children alone though Sorrows be fall us and Satan oppos Godly leads his dear children alone through Grace we can conquer defeat all our Force God leads his dear children alone some

all through the blood some through Gra sorrow but God gives a song in the night season and all the day [Music] long amen as brother Peter makes his way up and I see the Roberts family here I spoke with brother Roberts and if you got the WhatsApp prayer request about the accident and his son is here today and thank God that even one had to go to the hospital but our uh a brother was not injured and we kept that one that went to the hospital in prayer because it is a concern for us also you know it's not this life is just not about us so thank the Lord for watching over us so and sister Lydia when brother Peter's done and maybe give them time to watch the boys and then if you would prepare to sing [Music] than God bless you all it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen this didn't catch him by surprise let's sing Mercy rewrote my life Mercy reot my [Music] life God's mercy reot my life I should have fallen my soul cast down God's [Music] mercy rro my life life amen is that your testimony I asked brother Aaron if I could preach for a little bit so he he said I could so if the musicians want to sit down for a few minutes I came totally unprepared but I just feel like the lord gave me a little bit to speak so maybe it'll be uh really short but I just pray that the Lord has his way um let's just pray let let's stand and pray if you would Lord Jesus we're so totally inadequate in ourselves but Lord You're the well that never runs dry amen and every time we're in need of water the water of your word every time we're in need of Life father you've never failed us once and Lord even if we were just to get up and and testify of how good you've been to us Lord that your mercy has rewrote Our Lives not just once but every day Lord your mercy is what's keeping us from falling Lord from backsliding and just from utter destruction father it's your mercy that you chose us father not by any good of our own but just by by your great knowledge Lord your for knowledge and your election father that you chose us to be your people Lord help us just to surrender everything to tonight help me not to speak my own thoughts or words but Lord let your spirit come and move in our midst Lord open this Word of Life To Us father for a few minutes here just pray that you'd move supernaturally and speak to our hearts as only you can we know that you're the same yesterday today and forever and we commit everything into your hands father let it be for your glory and your honor in Jesus name amen let's just turn while you're standing to Hebrews chapter 11 and we're going to pick up a little bit where our brother Diggs uh left off Hebrews chap 11 and we'll read starting from 23 and we'll read through 26 I heard it said one time that to prepare a sermon that's uh 15 minutes it can take 3 hours but then if you only prepare for 15 for a 15 minutes then it can be a three-hour sermon so this one could be pretty long but I'll I'll definitely try not to do that it says by faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment so that's the part one we heard brother Diggs speak on that but then part two of Moses's story in in verse 24 says by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer afflictions Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward amen may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word and you may be seated I just wanted to speak for a few minutes on uh a question and the question is who are you and the the subtitle would be the Eternal choice you know so many um so many things in this world are for a season just like it says there that Moses could have chosen the pleasures of sin for a season and that's the way that most of the world works is seasonally getting ready for the seasons we look to see what's coming in the near future and we prepare for it if we're in the rainy season then we prepare for rain and if we're in the cold season uh we prepare for the cold and in the heat the the summer we get our swamp cool and air our air conditioning units all tuned up for that season we look at the election season and Everyone is always talking about what's going to happen with before the election it was all they could talk about for a year that election season coming up getting ready for this season and that's natural to look at at these seasonal things what's what's the near future and how can we get ready for them but what Moses chose was something Eternal he didn't just look at the season of his life the season of the next couple years of his life or even his whole life but by faith he had a revelation from God that that's not who he was and that's what it came down to at the end of Moses's story it wasn't that Moses could figure out you know the best thing for the season the best way to have an easy life or a good life or to try to make himself remembered but the most important realization that Moses had was that he wasn't the son of Pharaoh's daughter who the world thought he was and who he was presented as it wasn't who he was it was revealed to him that he should be see he knew that there was something different there and so he had this choice that he could make he could either continue on in this great life that he had it seemed like you know he the blessing of God was there through the the choices of his mother putting him into the Nile and he could have just lived the rest of his life on that and said well you know the Lord spared me and um he made me the son of pharaoh so who am I to say different let me just live this easy life that the Lord has blessed me with let me just live this Royal life let me be the son of Pharaoh let my name be great and I'll build some monuments and win some Wars and I'll try to do some good but that's not who he was it's not who he was made to be he was made to have he was made so that his choices could have an eternal impact and the choices that we make do have an eternal impact the choice of who we are and who we are determines what we're going to be who we are determines what we're going to do see Moses once he he surrendered to that that he wasn't going to be the son of pharaoh then the Lord didn't use his way Moses's way totally failed the Lord used a totally different way but the Lord was able to use his choice that he chose the Eternal thing amen and just think about what the world would look like if Moses hadn't made that choice not to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter maybe he could have helped Egypt to grow greater maybe he could have helped things to be a little bit better for the Israelites but if he hadn't surrendered to the will of God and been used by God to deliver these people we wouldn't have Israel we wouldn't have the stories of David and and the stories of the prophets we wouldn't have you know this whole plan of History his his choice impacted all of history to choose the harder way to choose to to give aside the Royal the Royal lifestyle that he had and to choose to be that deliverer that God had had Chosen and uh a lot of times people think that to to come to the realization of who we are in Christ is going to make things greater and it's going to make us easier make the Our Lives easier but if if you choose to be who the Bible says you are a son or a daughter of God if that's your choice it's going to make your life harder Moses forsook all this the pleasures of Egypt the pleasures of sin his life got so much harder he had to go and work he had to flee for his life when we choose our identity in Christ it's the harder Choice it's the choice of the reproach of Christ there's a a scripture in James chapter 4 and verse 4 and it says ye adulterers and adulteresses know you not that the Friendship of the world is emnity with God whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God see a lot of people want to stay the son of Pharaoh's daughter and be the deliver they want to have it both ways you can't have it both ways either you're going to be be successful by the world's standards to accomplish the calling that God has put on your life or if you choose the things of God usually you'll end up a failure to the World by the world's standards you know if the world speak well of you that's not a good thing the world should hate us the world should ridicule the way that we live our Liv our lives but so many times we want to try to to be both want to try to still be the Prince of Egypt and the deliverer that's what Moses tried he tried to by his own might and strength set the the children of Israel free they totally failed the Lord had to take 40 years in the desert to get that out of him he had to just be surrendered to God had to choose that harder way yes and in our lives you know so many times we try to to have our identity just be the mix ex just good enough at church and good enough with the things of the world but who I am in the word is to be totally surrendered to Christ my eyes to totally on him to to turn aside all the the easiness of this lifestyle we have it so easy in in this life you know just to be Americans just to be living in the 21st century we have it so easy but will you give up that identity and let your identity be one of surrender because Moses's life as as a prince of Egypt it was only for a season but his choice had Eternal ramifications and when we when we choose the way of the Lord it the choices have eternal results because it impacts people right see Moses could have built the big uh monuments that everyone else was building in Egypt to be remembered by and those are all buried underneath the sand and decaying there's this this law of of decay in in the world brother Matthew was talking about this law of Decay where things will just go to nothing nothing in this world lasts it's all for a season but see because Moses's Choice was for people it was to deliver the people of God well those people are still around today they're like the Sands of the sea in number yes see and when you choose the way of the Lord when you choose to surrender to this the Lord will use that to bless his people think of your children and and the ones that are are going to be affected by your life the things of this world will pass away but one soul is worth 10,000 worlds and so whatever you can give of your life just to to bless One Soul just to help somebody a lot of times we think about coming to church and and we walk away and think well what blessing did I get from church what uh you know what did I Come Away with but we don't always think about was I able to help somebody was I able to lift somebody up was I able to be an encouragement to somebody at church were you able to to give see we don't come to church just to take but we come we come to give to give praise to God to lift his name up to give to one another find out is there a need does your brother or sister have a need do they just need somebody to talk to to fellowship with and that's not just in church but in our interactions one with another how can we be a servant because those choices are Eternal where you can focus on laying down your life for your friends and uh was thinking of the other examples in the Bible of where there is similar choices where people chose the harder way to to save their people and one that's similar to Moses is the story of Esther you know she was also in the Royal house and and they said that she was the queen they didn't know that she was a Jew but when it came down to it it she risked everything she risked her life her luxury everything to say no I'm a Jew these are my people she risked it all but look at the Eternal blessing because of that that she was able to save her people think of if she had just lived in her life of luxury and she hadn't chose to be who God had made her to be think of all the Jews that would have been killed because of hmon but she said I'm not I'm not just the queen I'm a Jew think of John the Baptist you know he was born the son of the high priest that's probably about the closest thing that they had to a royal family there in in Israel in that time he could have lived you know a blessed life maybe he could have been a high priest if he had stuck around and just been who everyone said he was to be but he found in the word that there was to be one a voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare you the way of the Lord and he said that's who I am I'm not supposed to be in their seminaries and their theologies but he chose to live such a poor life he basically chose to be homeless because he he identified himself with this word but look at the the Eternal role that he played in preparing the way for the Lord getting the the hearts of the people right and you know he he had by the world standards a horrible life he was imprisoned he was beheaded but what a blessing his eternal reward will be what a blessing it was just to to baptize the Lord Jesus see his eyes were on on that Eternal and not on this life of Seasons looking at just the the seasons of his life he had a revelation and he made that choice another one don't worry I'm almost done George Washington and the founding fathers know they were called British subjects they were called to be you know part of this great Empire in the world and a lot of these men like George Washington things were fine for them they were most of the the influential founding fathers they were wealthy enough to have a good life they weren't slaves or anything like that but they had to come to the place where they found their identity was different than the identity that they were they born with they said no we're not British subjects were to be Americans and because of that look how much harder their life came became when they signed the Declaration of Independence they were signing their own death warrant they were signing for their sons to be killed in battle many of them to they were going to lose everything but it was worth it to them because they were Americans it's like the eagle in the chicken yard you know life in a chicken yard's pretty easy they throw the food out to you they put the water out to you they clean up after you you're gonna end up eating they don't really tell you that but other than that you know a chicken yard chicken only has one bad day in their life it's the last one everything other than that's pretty good an eagle he's always got to go and find his food fly around for it he's got he's got no chicken Coupe to come back to he's got to Brave the weather but that eagle in the Barnard said no I'm not made for this chicken yard I'm made to be an eagle just like the the slave in the story we know the story where the the slave had such a good work ethic because he knew he was the father of a king well you know we think of that and oh that's that's great he he really showed them and he was unbroken but what that actually looked like for that slave was he was working way harder than anyone else it wasn't that they said oh you're the son of a king here's your special bunk and here's a little extra food and we're glad that you know you're the son of a king life is going to be easier for you but no it meant that when they were moving something he was grabbing the heavy end it meant when the person next to them couldn't finish their job he was there working double he was there making it harder on himself choosing the harder way but think of the Eternal ramifications of that choice think about maybe he had a son and think of how different it could have been if his son saw Dad defeated just trudging along think of how that can affect Generations just to to give up keep your head down be what the world says you're to be then the sun gives up a little bit and generations and generations can be affected just by the choices of one person can trickle down for a long time but think about because he chose to work hard he chose to to do the harder way to care for his people think of the generations that could could still follow in those footsteps think of his sons that could rise up and and uh say Well I'm the the grandson of a king and they could they could go and keep that Legacy going that his reward wasn't the work that he could do for the the master master was a bad slave owner he was a bad man an evil man but see the blessings from that choice was the people around him could look to him and they could be encouraged they could be blessed they could receive strength they could be helped maybe he could spare them some whipping because he he covered for them maybe because he worked so hard his sons never gave up maybe a couple Generations later his sons were were still doing you know working hard being proud instead of just being defeated not trying and then the Supreme example of one that chose his identity the harder way just like Moses and Esther left the riches of the palace would be Jesus he didn't choose the identity of God but he said no I'm going to come in the form of a man I'm going to lower myself going to come down as they are he didn't just from Heaven make a way for us but he said no I'll I'll go be the way I'm not going to send a sacrifice from there I'm going to go be the sacrifice that's our example that we can go and humble ourselves like he humbled himself leave all the riches all the the Easy Life Style say no going to go walk among them he he went down and was tempted in every way right every way whatever going through like nobody knows what I've I've gone through Jesus knows he's been there he knows what it's like to stub his toe he knows what it's like to be yelled at when he didn't do anything wrong knows what it's like to be hated for no reason to be talked badly against you know he he experienced all that so that when we need a helper when we need a savior when we need a friend say oh Lord you know you've been there you didn't just see all this from up above but you came and you got your feet dirty in the dust of everyday living he chose that he chose to be that Ram caught in the Thorns by his horns his strength his love to know I'm going to go down and humble myself so we have many examples of this in the Bible but who are we who are you you know there's uh in Revelation The Book of Revelation in 2 217 there's a verse that says and the spirit and the bride say come is that who you are are you that bride that's saying come Lord Jesus is that what your life is showing it convicts me to say that because a lot of times that's not what my life is saying the way that I live my life isn't saying come Lord Jesus come right this minute come right this hour you'll find me perfectly ready you'll find my heart right you'll find me about your kingdom I'll be honest a lot of times that's not what my life is saying maybe my words are saying that but to become that to become that bride that's echoing the spirit saying come it's the harder way it's the way way that looks so foolish to this world it's to leave the easy lifestyle that we have and to go down and get dirty help people to work all day and sometimes all night to take the stripes on your back for your friends who are you are you just another American that was born a life of luxury or are you that Queen that says I'm one of them and if it costs me my life it costs me my life are you that one that will sign online and say I'm an American even if it's total Destruction for me is your identity in this book or just the same as everyone else Let's uh let's just pray maybe as uh maybe Lydia can come up and sing a song Maybe if the musicians want to come back let's just pray Lord just an odd little sermon tonight but believe that you laid it on my heart for somebody maybe just for me but Lord we want to choose you to choose the Eternal not to live for this season of sin season of pleasure but Lord we want our lives to count for something we know that if we seek to save our lives we'll lose it but if we give them up you can make something beautiful of them Lord we're just so glad that you show us by your word that we're not meant to just live live like everyone else but we're meant to go the harder way to lay our lives down and to surrender to your will pray you'd help us each one father and just bless the remainder of this this service whatever your plan is for tonight Lord we just look to you and thank you Father for your name is great and greatly to be praised thank you for the work that you're doing in each one of our Lives you said that you that started the good work would finish it and we're trusting in that father thank you Lord Jesus name amen God bless you all um I had actually been playing a song earlier in the day and um I thought maybe someday I would sing it but I couldn't have guessed it would be tonight so um I just want to give a really quick testimony it's really close to my heart um but I really feel like the Lord wants me to share it and I knew I would someday so um a few weeks back I had been it's kind of hard to explain basically just getting down and um it started off with just maybe a small negative thought you get caught up with being a mother and your house is a mess and your children are screaming and you let a little negative thought come in your head and then the next day it's a little bit bigger of a thought and bigger and as the week went on I was just finding myself having terrible thoughts and I'm usually pretty upbeat that I was just irrational thoughts as I look back on it that you know it was just the devil that I was unfit to be a mother and you know if I did something wrong they take my kids away just bizarre things that weren't God and I had I had seen some stuff um social media some really heavy dark stuff that um just I didn't mean to see it but it wasn't edifying and it was just there's a lot of hard things happening in the world and I just stumbled across some articles about some really sad stuff that happened and it was really weighing me down and before I knew it it felt like there were just bricks on my shoulders and chest and it was just overwhelming um don't worry there's a really good end this story so um Peter had to go do something in the even and um I had a whole evening plan I'd put the kids to bed and I'd get these things done that I wanted to do and when he got back I hadn't I didn't do any of it I just I gotten so sad and um you know rather than reading my Bible and listening to sermons I just found myself wasting more time to distracted from my problems and when he got back I was really as you would say in a dark spot and um so I talked a little bit and then we just did our evening devotions like we always do and when we went to pray I um I asked them if I could pray and I mean I just felt the weight of the world on my shoulders it was just such a scary dark dark world to raise my family in and it was just overwhelming it's the only way you can put it because once you give heed to the devil's thoughts how can you see anything but darkness and all of a sudden while I'm praying the words weren't mine anymore um and to man to ear you wouldn't be able to understand them but the Lord he gave me these words to pray and it was just and I've never I've only ever really worshiped like that but to pray was such a heaviness it was kind of scary to me praying in tongues and but just such a heaviness and I didn't have the words to say it was just utter desperation and then I finished and I felt so much better that the Lord had given me the words to pray when I didn't have them on my own and then um Peter flipped open the Bible just completely randomly and I had to keep asking them the whole time he was reading the the chapter he read because I couldn't believe that he had just picked that so I'm going to read as fast as I can because um I really can't leave out any telling you the backstory it was just God directly speaking to me and I will never forget it and I've read it so many times since because when God handwrites a love letter to you so perfect in Tim I mean you can show it straight to the devil every time so it's um Psalms 116 I love the Lord because he ha heard my voice and my supplications because he hath inclined his ear unto me therefore I will call upon him as long as I live the Sorrows of death compassed me and the Pains of Hell got hold of me and I found trouble and sorrow then called I upon the name of the Lord oh Lord I beseech thee deliver my soul I mean this is like exactly when it just happened 5 minutes before gracious is the Lord and righteous say our God is merciful Lord preserveth the simp while I was brought low and he helped me return return unto thy rest oh my soul for the Lord hath dealt bound to flee with thee for thou Hast delivered my soul from Death my eyes from tear and my feet from falling I will I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living I believe therefore have I spoken I was greatly Afflicted I said in my my heast sto men are liars what shall I Render unto thee for all these benefits toward me I will take the cup of Salvation and call upon the name of the Lord I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people precious is the sight of the Lord precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints and I had always taken that very literal but in that moment it was absolutely death to self and um oh Lord truly I am thy servant I am thy servant the son of thine handmade thou Hast loose my bonds I will offer to thee a sacrifice of Thanksgiving I will call upon the name of the Lord I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people in the courts of the Lord's House in the midst of thee Oh Jerusalem praise ye the Lord and I cannot tell you Night and Day from the beginning of those devotions to the end I mean it was just talk about being brought from Darkness into light the weight of the world is lifted on my should shoulders and it was really a stake in the ground in my life and um and then this song kind of goes really hand in hand and I've only ever played through it once so I hope it's okay not because I've been so faithful nothing because I've been so good you've always been there for me to provide my every need you were there when I was lonely you were there in all my pain guiding my footsteps Shelter From the rain and it was you you made my life complete you are to me my everything and that is why I sing Jesus I love you because you care I couldn't imagine if you weren there Jesus I love you because you care I couldn't imagine if you were in there you are the joy of my salvation you're the peace in my storm your loving arms Protect Me Shelter From the horn you are all and Omega the beginning and the end my strong tower my dearest and best friend and it was you you made my life complete you are to me my everything and that is why I sing Jesus I love you because you care I couldn't imagine if you were in there Jesus I love you because you care I couldn't imagine if you were in there Jesus I love you I love you Jesus I love you I love you Jesus I love you I love you because you care Jesus I love you I love you Jesus I love you I love you Jesus I love you because you care [Music] [Applause] the things we appreciate the most are the things that we've had to battle to get to when you've spent your money to buy what you wanted you share a a whole lot more you take care of it a lot more than once somebody else buys it for you maybe as a child your parents bought it and but when you've worked hard and you've earned it it means a little bit more to you at that point and what a friend we have in Jesus let's sing that first verse what a friend we have in Jesus how many knows him to be a friend a a friend that stick us closer than a brother amen you get that first verse up there brother Jeremy what a friend we have in [Music] Jesus all our sins and grief to be what a privil to [Music] car to God pray oh what peace we off for fa oh what needless pains we bear oh because we do not [Music] care to God in [Music] pray I know I found my myself at times doing everything but praying how I do this I'm going to do that I'm going to take care of this and then you turn your heart and say Lord I've ignored you in all of this and he still merciful as brother Peter was speaking that song and we won't sing it but the words to the chorus he could have called 10,000 angels to destroy this world and set him free that would have been the easy way he could have called 10,000 angels but he died alone for for you and me and Joshua said it this way choose ye this day whom you will serve the gods of the amorites the gods of your pleasure those things but as for me in my house we will serve the Lord so appreciate the goodness of the Lord and the grace I don't know if that was his sermon he was preparing for for his next time but that's a good start huh so I'd like to share something with you brother Jeremy if you'll put up Romans 8:28 and and you can stay here on the Romans 8:28 a verse we're all very familiar with and we know you know it comes to a point in your life that you know because you experience it not because somebody else told you about it but because you've experienced that all things work together for good to them that love God and who are the called according to his purpose and I I I find myself right there it's not a choice I made but he called but how do I respond to that now I had something sent to me and I want to I want to share this with you it it's uh a brother sent this to me and he was he said he was hearing something and they were talking about about David he talks about the tremendous Pressure David is under and the overwhelming odds David's faces at uh at the first the pressure is a direct attack to on his life it comes from in various forms from The Lion The Bear Goliath Saul then it it when it the situation changes when David becomes king so not only does David have to look after himself but he's responsible for Israel now you know uh one nation after another steps up to threaten and kill the people the last area of pressure comes from within in his own house he says now the people that were closest to him turn against him and threaten him some of of this was his own doing and some of it was not and and we sometimes get ourselves into problems you know it as as I got sick and I and began to battle the diabetes and begin to realize I caused it you know if you drink uh a Dr Pepper or two every day that's real healthy and it was just good for a moment but the consequences of it you know so some of it you cause yourself he says yet through it all David was able to praise the Lord and this is the part he said David was able to praise the Lord he knew who held him up it made me think of my own life and pressures can I worship the Lord the way David did and we hear sister Lydia saying that just came up Suddenly and you began to praise and and God you began to worship God you begin to acknowledge God you begin to give him praise and it changes the whole atmosphere but you have to choose the harder way and and so think about this and and this is just what the brother sent to me and he said it made him think about diamonds and diamonds are one of the most valuable gems that there are in this world uh you know you look at the diamonds uh somebody what is it in Kentucky or somewhere where they they can go out and dig for diamonds and they find and every once one somebody finds a valuable Diamond there it's worth thousands and thousands of dollars but here's a little bit of of the makeup of a Diamond they are formed by pressure night diamonds have a reputation that for being very valuable and they had captur one's admiration and desire however the diamonds are known also for their Incredible strength and durability said however the diamond forming process is incredible it starts in a layer of the Earth crust that is very deep holds very high pressure and very very high heat so if you're becoming a diamond you know where you're being created not in the pleasures of this life and the good things and as brother Peter was speaking these things were coming to me I was just just had been reading this as the brother sent it to me in the adversities in the hard times in the choice as the the Lord told Brother brandom through the through the the the the gift that was used because you have chosen the harder way he says very deep holds very high pressure and very high heat and this was taken from a Smith's article there described that the area where the diamonds are formed no man has been able to touch or observe due to the depth of the earth not only that all the components are needed to form the diamonds already exist at that level so no matter where you're going through whatever you got God has already already prepared and placed that to perform what he wants done it's not by accident God knows you would be there says the intense pressure and heat causes a crystals to start becoming carbon molecules and and they they're forced together causing them to lock into each other using one of the strong strongest chemical bonds known to man I think it's calent coent Bond he says it's a the the way the bond is shown depicts one carbon atom reaching out an arm and the other carbon atom reaching out an arm I reaching out to you dear Lord and he's already extended his arm to you he says but I like this part he says then they grab onto each other and he gives it C equals c this process happens over and over until the diamond is formed once the bond is established it's extremely difficult to break it's an eternal Bond on his end he says because each atom is At Its most stable point and even though there's tremendous pressure and heat externally the purity of the diamond is directly related to how far down into the Earth's crust it starts the further down the higher the temperature and pressure the longer it takes to get the diamond to the Earth's surface I'm glad that God chose to do it that way but in this com he makes a comment that the diamond or the process is peaceful for those going through the profess process because there's an assurance with it and when you realize it's God in you creating that and you've Tak taking his hand he's taking your hand then you can rest and that which is performed comes out pure and valuable so some of the things you're going through in life and you say why God is perfecting that in you it's a choice you've made because it's I can't make that choice for you you can't make that choice for me but I have to say Lord I'm willing I'm willing so appreciate that and it was something that he uh he shared with me and I thought that was really good as hearing what brother Peter was saying God bringing that and you making that choice now Romans 8:28 tells us that all things happen for our good and you could say they're predestined you could say God charted them out because he knows what he's doing he's already I've always said to you the the fire you go through is not to see if there's gold in you but rather because there is gold in you you're going through that testing and God knows you will you know so part of that there and and um I appreciate the grace of God and and sometimes it's hard to say thank you Lord for the troubles I'm going through thank you Lord for the hard times I'm going through but you know what you're doing about it so I I'd like to ask brother Matthew to sing a song it's bu land if you would is is that your heart's desire I'm longing for you would you sing that brother Matthew and would you play that for him sister thank you bring words I'm kind of homesick oh for a [Music] country to which I have never been never been

brandham says and you can find different place where he said it the choice you make will be turn will determine your Eternal destination and when you think about it you saywell how do I know I'm going to make that right choice he also says because there's a SE Gene of God in you you will make that right choice I'm glad that he has it all in his hands and under his control and it's not up to him the Democratic party the Republican Party the Libertarians those that did vote those that didn't vote God has it all in his hands and in his control how many appreciate God being so good to us amen is he good to you amen appreciate his grace and his Mercy let's see did confirm that's what I thought of my so brother Wards is going to be with us and I've always appreciated the ministry of brother Daryl I'll just say this that one of the first things that really caught my attention with brother Daryl is after he finished preaching he would come back in amongst the congregation and pray with them talk to them go and me need everybody and shake their hands and I always found that I I said that's just a a good character a wonderful character to have so come believing come expecting saying Lord I have need of you but you're more than able to supply even in the darkness even in the hard time even when everything around you seems to be falling apart my hope is built on nothing less than Jesus Christ and his righteousness amen do you love him tonight amen he's so good so I trust it's been a blessing I I didn't know I we had other plans but God had something in mind and I know somebody's been touched today so brother Arney Peterson would you come and dismiss us in prayer tonight amen it's we'll get meet here on Sunday and like I said bring that lick of fire with you and I bring that and

praise God for that and I I just the hunger in your heart will draw will pull on who is behind the pulpit who is with you and God will me to your need so amen thank you brother that song was brother Green's dad's favorite song at his memorial they said that and it means married so it's something that uh God's paternal and maternal at the same time how he could be so much Lord we just want to surrender to you and realize that we love you that's your first commandment we love to be loved Lord we understand and to hear everything will work out for our good like brother Aon read it's just
