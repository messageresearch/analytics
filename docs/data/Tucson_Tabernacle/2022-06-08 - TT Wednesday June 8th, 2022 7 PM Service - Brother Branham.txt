ministry let us begin reading now in the first chapter of saint luke and beginning at the 35th verse and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the high shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which is born of thee shall be called the son of god and behold thy cousin elizabeth she has also conceived the son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who is called baron for with god nothing shall be impossible and mary answered in said behold the hands made of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her let's just once more pray if you will lord now we have sang songs tonight i never got the opportunity to sing it with the people only harm a little only believe as i was coming to the pulpit prayers has been made the bible's been read lord speak to us tonight through thy word to continue the message that we've already heard we pray that then the holy spirit will come and get into the message tonight and will bring christ real to our hearts we hear the paper where those muslims laid before mr billy graham those 30 incurables and challenged him oh lord god there's still a god that lives and answers by fire we pray the heavenly father to be with billy graham as he's ministering over there in the fields where only those who walk in those tracks many times as our servant has tried to say to the people it's all right here in america but don't drive that demon land there unless you know what you're talking about for they're ready to challenge the spirit of god lord art still god has proved every time that you were gone give your servants courage to believe you lord dark god if you're not the same god then he wasn't god at all but we know that are the same yesterday today and forever and nothing can ever change thee are the eternal and everlasting god speak to us tonight lord jesus while we think on thy word we asked it in your name and for your sake amen i believe that the sun had already come up and was bathing across the galilean skies drawing up the fragrance of the roses where the night had been quite and sweetness comes on the air and she was making her way down along the side of the street to the city well where the people come together their supply of water and as she made her way along with a little a crock under her arm she was studying thinking about the day before and the great mighty message that the rabbi had preached and at this message that she and joseph her engaged husband had of on their front porch after the midday meal as they sat there looking across the little hill to where finally the little house would be erected where they were to spend their life as far as they knew in this little building joseph was a carpenter and he loved his job and he loved to do things just right and being a believer in god and know that there was someone who watched over him he wanted all of his work to be just exactly right but all this little house was a special one the doors had to be just perfect and the closets in it because he was bringing the sweetest woman in all the world there to be his bride as a as a custom would sit out there and look at the little house and plant just how the roses would be at this little spot and the gate must be a little heart because they were so in love and how they were planning on doing it because joseph being the carpenter while he could take his time and then perhaps just behind the house that was going to be the carpenter's shop where he would do all this cabinet work to make his doors and and the little odds and ends that was brought to him and in that they would have their livelihood and this sunday as soon as they had come out of sabbath and set on the front porch after the midday meal it must have been joseph that said that was a striking message this morning mary i am so thrilled when i hear our rabbi speak of the greatness of jehovah and all how he told us of that great mighty god that came down into egypt and took our people out how he opened up the red sea when it got in his way and how he rained bred out of heaven blow the quails and out of field led them by a pillar of fire by night and a cloud by day how the children of israel camped under this great light as they walked in the light wherever it went they went also and brought them safely into the promised land and there he might have said something like this yes darling but i want to ask you something what happened to that great god that he isn't just as great today as he was then did you notice a rabbi answer that wonderful message then alas he said jehovah must have turned his back on us because he doesn't perform miracles anymore but joseph quickly picked it up and said but mary i believe that god is just as great and powerful as he ever was i found that mary's mother anna must have come to the door and said are you young folks waiting for the scriptures and handed him to the hand of mary which passed it on to joseph the book of isaiah joseph opening up the scroll begin to read and when he come to isaiah 9 6 unto us a child is born unto us our son is given and his the government shall be upon his shoulders his name shall be called counselor prince of peace mighty god everlasting father and of his peace and his kingdom there shall be no end and it must have been that time that mary's heart was strangely worn isn't it strange how god does things scriptures made manifest she said joseph and he looked at her and perhaps he always thought she was the most beautiful woman he'd ever saw but then there was a certain look in her face that charmed him more than ever while her pretty eyes looked at him like that of the dove soft innocent i think that's the way a woman should look innocent soft and sweet she said joseph [Music] what was the prophet speaking of when he said unto us a child is born and unto us a son is given who is this son and this child that he was speaking on joseph looked back to her must have been said well my dear the prophet was speaking of the coming messiah the hope of israel and you know mary that all down to the ages since moses we've looked forward to that one coming and when he comes he will deliver us our bondage of these romans out of the bondage of our sins and israel will know their god and he'll keep his word and mary my dear if we don't see him in our generation he'll surely be here in the next but we'll look for him in our generation all night she couldn't sleep over unto us a child is born under us a son is given and the next morning she slept late so she was late getting to the well that's why the sun was up and as she made her way down the street seemed like no one was around and she was thinking on this scripture and it's usually when we're thanking [Music] is because their thoughts are on other things let the meditation in my mind my heart be acceptable unto thee oh lord i believe if we'll think on him he'll draw nigh unto us remember the first easter when the orpheus and his unnamed friend in the bible was on their road to emmaus they were going along the road discussing about him thinking of him all their hearts were burned every hope seemed like that they had was taken from them and it was dan that a stranger walked out inside the bush and walked with them they didn't know who it was you're just a man come walking out walked along them and said why are you so weary why are you so faint in your mind and they said are you just a stranger nor astound not that jesus of nazareth who we hope to be the deliverer of israel has been crucified by pilate and this is the third day some women said they've seen it visit angels and then he started from the scriptures and began to explain to them the scriptures house christ must suffer and enter into his glory and then when he got them in the room and closed the doors and he did a miracle or something just like he did before his crucifixion and they knew it was him thinking on him oh if we didn't have so many other things on our mind you know sometimes we'll come to church think about tomorrow i gotta do this the next day i've got to do this when we come to church we ought to lay aside every thought and everything of the world and enter into fellowship with christ and worship meditating worshiping in our hearts and giving songs and praises to him thanking all his goodness and what he means to us worshiping in the spirit singing spiritual songs making melodies in our heart even the bible says there's any afflicted let them sing psalms be happy be in meditation always expecting god at any moment to appear to you are you doing it just now before this healing service you people stop prayer cards waiting for the line are you thinking it's just a few more minutes and all my suffering will be over are you thinking oh i don't know he might not call my card it might be oh don't do that just remember just keep it on your mind it just be a few minutes now and you'll meet the requirements that god said do these signs shall follow them that belief if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover keeping on your mind and she was thanking all the scriptures that scripture was being confirmed to her a child is born a son is given about that time she's seen something flash before the little virgin and a light no doubt my mind like the pillar of fire and standing there was a angel the mighty gabriel he's a messenger to the jews remember gabriel announced the first coming of christ the angel gabriel will announce the second coming of christ the bible said so now there it frightened the little lady and she looked at him and he said hail mary blessed art thou among the women god highly favored of god for god is with thee and he told what was going to happen that she was going to bear a child and they should call his name jesus for it save the people from the sins now she had a right to know that that was the right kind of a messenger first thing he was an angel standing there the next thing he told her who she was mary you know that was a sign of god down to the age she looked at him and she said how can these things be seen that i don't know a man and he said the holy ghost shall come upon me before miracles can take place the holy ghost has to come that's what's the matter in the world today they're denying the power of the holy ghost that's why people can't believe in divine healing they're denying the very holy spirit that brings divine healing the holy ghost shall come upon me and the most high shall overshadow thee and that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god that's how he's coming you don't need to know no man god's going to do this or with god nothing is impossible or what that little lady had to believe she had to believe something that was impossible she had to believe something had never happened heger hannah when she was told by the priest the lord gives me thy desire while she went home in nine months brought the child that was wonderful but and so was elizabeth as he said thy cousin elizabeth which was called baron is already six months to be mother and told her that with god nothing was impossible and she said behold the hands made out of the lord be it unto me according to thy word what you had to believe something had never happened zacharias the priest the husband of her cousin he doubted that same angel when he said after the days of administration at the temple he would go home and live with his wife elizabeth and she'd bring a son and he said i'm too old it can't be done oh he just doubted it and he had abraham and sarah to look at he had hannah at the temple and eli her husband to think of but that callous priest doubted god's word but his brother cicarian said the other day over in the island when i saw my mother-in-law died five days before it happened and my brother-in-law have a hemorrhage and blood out from his mouth just poured it from his mouth brother simon said let us go in and pray that this won't happen i said it won't do one bit of good god has already said it it's got to happen god when he says anything it's impossible for it not to happen therefore when god says in the books all things are possible to them that believe it's got to happen no way to explain it away you can believe god will perform every promise that he made then when she never waited little mary didn't now she had to believe something that had never happened but look at her little childish heart i'm going to thank her to be just a young woman about 18 20 years old she never taken the second thought as soon as she's seen and know that was the angel of the lord that knowed these things and told her exactly according to scripture she had been thinking on and told her her name she know that messenger come from god and the scripture that she had been thinking on was confirmed right there to her mary the holy ghost will come upon you and if almighty shall overshadow thee and that holy thing that'll be born will not be a man but he'll be called the son of god she threw her little hands up in the tears running out of those beautiful eyes said hold the hands made of the lord bid unto me according to thy word she didn't wait till she was positive of this she didn't wait till she felt life or some kind of a sensation to prove that she was to be a mother she just took his word and that was enough that's what god wants you to do tonight not wait till you feel better not wait for you to move your hand better walk a good step not wait till the doctor says you're improving but take god at his word and begin to believe that's the only way to please him take his word that's the way miracles are performed when god is tucked by his word the impossibles are made real when god is stuck at his word not question just keep it from your mind behold the hands made of the lord while she was so happy about it she just couldn't stand still and nothing had showed up yet but she knew it was going to because god said if christ says these signs shall power them that believe if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover take him at his word don't doubt anything just go right on believing it'll be all right god promised it god will perform it god watches over his words to keep it and to answer prayer then she started on her way she heard good news of her cousin elizabeth an old woman around 65 70 years old her husband the same age around 70 or 75 years old and she had conceived in her old age because she had believed god would give her a child it was an honor then to have a baby it's a dishonor now they'd rather buy a little dog give it the love of a child no wonder we got juvenile delinquency we got dog loving mothers that's oh it's a shame but it was a honor then and a dishonor for a woman not to have a baby but lil and mary takes out up in the from nazareth up into the hills of judea up over that rough path i guess further or invite you travel that path a few weeks ago up over that hill into judea to meet her cousin to enjoy his fellowship together because god had overshadowed both of them what a privilege it is for brethren to dwell together in unity it's like the anointing oil it was on aaron's beard that run all the way to the hymns of his church when people together can agree upon god still being god god just as great as he ever was and can assemble themselves together and worship god in spirit mary wanted fellowship no need of going down to the synagogue because they didn't believe it she went to somebody that had an experience like she had and she went there to fellowship so on her way she went to somebody that believed god was still just as great as he ever was yes that's why we're having this christian businessman fellowship in the morning where businessmen can worship together on one common ground believing that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever that's why we got churches around over this city and around all the world that's preaching the unsearchable riches of christ because we have fellowship together we set in heavenly places in christ jesus the holy ghost coming up on us and overshadowing us empowering us with gifts and signs and wonders and miracles why it's some closest thing to heaven there is on the earth there she took out for this fellowship the heart calls for it up over the hills i can see her going her little cheeks of blessing them little eyes sparkling as she fell out keep this a secret from joseph i just can't wait out doc to go and up in the hill she went on up into judea up at the house of her cousin and mary before she got to the house elizabeth her cousin had hid herself because he was very weary because little john in the wombs of his mother was six months and no life had showed yet now that's all together on unnatural it isn't just exactly the regular routine life appears in three or four months and this is six months and she was a little weary about it i can see her sitting back in a room and there she said praying something like this god i waited all these years and i believed in my heart that something was about to happen there sets my husband out there dumb he can't speak he keeps writing on a satan saying i saw an angel i saw an angel an angel spoke to me at the right hand of the altar something great's going to happen and all of a sudden she's seen that she was to be mother but she the baby grew but had no life no muscles are moving at all six months altogether a sub normal and she looked out the window and she saw mary coming her teeth shining like pearls in her eyes just glistening with joy and she said i ought to know that child and she had her rope wrapped around her running as hard as she could zechariah stood in the yard and said oh hail i know who you are ah you're anna's daughter you're anna's daughter yes that's who i am and elizabeth runs out she's been sitting there making little booty for the baby somehow another she bleed way down in her heart that god would let her down no matter maybe you'd be setting shake maybe you've tried to serve god in your settings 6-9 but way down in your heart something's getting ready oh i wonder if the man you're in a wheelchair if he's ready getting thank you down his heart this is the night i'll never have to use this no more one of this lady sitting here and then one behind her is thinking the same thing like others another lady sitting back there are you remembering that all things work together for their goods and that love god god's trying to do something for you and she laid the little booties down and she ran out in the yard and she grabbed mary around the neck and began to hug her and kiss us you know what people felt for one another then different they do now you know there's not much stealing amongst people no more no fellowship it hasn't been too long ago i was downtown with my wife and there's a lady said hello sister branham and i never heard her say a word i said honey that lady spoke to you she said i spoke to her well i said i'm sure she didn't hear you because i didn't and i'm sitting closer than she was or she said i i smiled at her oh i said ridiculous honey a little silly grin don't take the place hello there how you doing that'll never take the place giant people's got so they try to even substitute something else for a good old handshake i was down in florida some years ago and we were having a great meeting in a tent out there at the flagler dog tracker out that way on flagler street and um they've been a little boy had been down there a little preacher david had down there in a tent and he'd asked me to come down and help him he got a little trouble and i went down to see if i could help the little fellow and the people were crowded so much in there that i could hardly get in and out without three or four people around to help push me in and sick people that's where brother bosworth come into the ministry he said that's what i prayed for since i was a boy when he seen the holy spirit go out in the meeting and say you sitting out there a man had been thrown on a horse a few years before and his arm broke up said you was riding on a horse sunday afternoon racing you run a fruit market down you're to horse soji and you've never moved your arm since and he said that's right he said straighten out your arms jesus christ makes you whole in there when he's armed straight oh brother boss was right up there and said that's what i look for or he said i've watched the scriptures for that certainly then at that meeting they said brother branham the duchess wants to see you i said the what said the duchess i said i don't know what you're talking about and he said well it's a great woman she's the duchess and said she's right back behind the temperature i said well why she heard what about all these sick people laying out here and she's they said oh but she owns this whole thing through here i said my father owns all this whole thing across years i said why i see her i said that's his children laying out there sick and he sent me here to pray for them if i can see anybody let me see them so when i went out they had a woman standing there whether you said so or not great big woman had enough diamonds on her hand to send the missionaries around the world 50 times you never seen so much gold and stuff and a woman had a a glass in her hand had it had specks on the end of them or sticks she held out like this look down here uh you know that any common sense should tell you you're not going to keep your ass out like that holding out like that and she said are you dr branham i said no ma'am i'm not she said well i was told that you were dr brandon if i knew that i said no ma'am my brother random the servant of christ and she said well i am chomped or delighted or something like that with her hand up like this i looked at her a little bit i thought that's the funniest we don't shake hands like that in kentucky so i uh seen she wanted to shake hands with me so i reached up and got over here i said well get it down here so i know you when i see you again what is it it's somebody trying to act something that they're not that's just exactly it's a lot of putt-on that has no meaning to it at all she was no more than six foot of dirt like the rest of us that's just exactly him but trying to be something easy like old congressman upshaw that was sealed in a meeting after being in a wheelchair and crutches for 66 years he always had a little slogan he said you can't be nothing that you hate and that's really the truth that's it you can't be all people now you know you don't even know when your your neighbor dies like you see it in the paper anymore they don't have no more fellowship like we used to have we're going down the street 90 miles an hour and turn the corners stop and talk for an hour before you go home or there's something insane about the whole thing but people in them they love one another they had time fellowship and to talk to each other and elizabeth salt her cousin and she run out into her arms around her and begin to hug her she said oh mary while the last time i've seen you use a little freckled face girl here you are a beautiful woman and i heard that you were going with that fine boy of joseph she said yes that is true um elizabeth well she said i'm so glad to see you well honey why don't you come sit down while joseph has gone to set some water so i can wash your feet you must be tired they're bleeding is there anything wrong are you in a hurry you seem to be so happy but yet look like you've been hasting oh she says elizabeth i just can't wait to tell you oh she said you know i'm going to have a baby oh you and joseph already man no we're not married yet well mary i'm shocked oh but elizabeth on the road to the well the day before yesterday morning i was going along thinking about the scriptures that joseph and i have been talking about the day before and i've seen a great deep killer of fire stand before me stepping out of it was gabriel the angel of god who called me by my name and told me that i found favor before god that the holy ghost was going to overshadow me and that the power of god would be upon me and i'd have a child and you'd be called the son of god and said he told me that you were to be a mother also old age like this and said is already six months oh she said mary that is the truth i'm to be a mother but honey i am so weary i'm already six months to motherhood and the baby has never moved it hasn't had one bit of life yet and i'm just so worried about it oh i hear mary say don't worry because everything will be all right that angel knows you and calls your name too your cousin elizabeth oh everything will be all right and he told me even give me my baby's name oh he did yes he'd give me my baby's name he said i should call his name jesus just about the time she said jesus for the first time that that name has ever spoke for human lift little john received the holy ghost began to jump in the shouting in his mother's food little john begin to leap in the mother's womb for joy if the name of jesus christ the first time it was ever spoke to human lips brought a dead baby that had never had no life brought him to life what else did he do in this church tonight with a born-again bunch of people that's filled with the holy spirit and the angel of the lord here nightly showing himself that he's the same yesterday today that glorious name of the lord jesus oh there is power of power wonder working power in the precious blood of the lamb how that great wonderful immaculate amazing inscribable name of the lord jesus one time i give it a challenge i wanted to see what i was talking about when i was in france i went to pig alley i didn't take anybody's word but i want to see it myself they told me about spiritualism and i took a couple of fellows and went up in indiana where they had that big meeting of spiritualism i suppose the hopes that they were now i went in there and they had a table standing up and said no man can knock that table down going all like that the people were going on all kinds of demon powers and they looked over there and i said the power of god can knock that table down and i said they wouldn't believe it and they were trying to hold it down with hands for man with their legs wrapped around trying to pull it down and this woman standing there doing all kinds of things and making that table walk do around and i they stopped when i said this and another minister mr d'arc's standing by me i said in the name of high heaven's fault it didn't do it i said the name of the holy church fall it didn't do it i called all kinds of names that i could think of that's why i said in the name of jesus christ fall and almost broke the lakes off in the ground in my name they shall cast out devils [Music] there's power in that name it made this little baby come to life in the wombs of its mother and leap for joy and the bible said that john was born from his mother's womb full of the holy ghost not only that but while he was in the womb in the holy ghost upon him his own mother received the holy ghost and prophesied saying and gave prophecy concerning him and concerning the lord jesus don't you see friends that same jesus christ that was born of the virgin mary was born of virgin birth his holy spirit sure tonight he has ever angel under his control he has ever power under his control every all powers in heavens and earth he said has given into my hand go ye therefore and teach all nations into all the world and he he all the power lays up in him and he promised these promises just don't question him take him at his word do that while we bow our heads just a moment now for friends how many would like to be remember and say brother branham let that power that made john in the womb of his mother come to life may have waken me out of my dull senses god bless you boys god bless you there god bless you all over the building your hands up let that holy spirit awaken me from this slumber that i'm saying i want to be filled with the holy spirit in such a way that my human senses will not function unless it's in the will of god i want to be led by the spirit the spirit is the sixth sense god gave man five senses they wasn't to control you their contacts are earthly homes but the sixth sense which is faith it leads you it controls you our heavenly father oh how good it is to talk of the lord jesus to see how it blesses our soul and to know tonight that there never was a man barnes under the heavens like that that never was such a wonderful gift ever given to the world when god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever believeth on him should not perish but has eternal life all that god has done for the human race and we set and rehearse that over in the experiences of other people in days gone by who has been in contact with heaven through the messengers of angels and the lord jesus the holy spirit and god himself oh lord as we fellowship around these things and know that it's not some kind of a story just some kind of a mythical story or superstition among people but he is alive tonight he's here tonight just as real as he was in galilee he cannot fail his name has been given above every name in heavens and earth all the family is named jesus all the powers in the heavens and earth is given into his hands and he says go preach the gospel these signs shall follow in that belief night after night as he showed us here that he was the same god who came down and created himself a body and talked to abraham and done a sign of knowing that he had a wife and her name was sarah and know that she laughed in the tent behind him that body was nothing but dirt dust and cosmic light and petroleum it went right back to the dust where it come from when he got finished with it stole our body go right back to the dust again there's nothing in us lord brother that great holy spirit to look down to manifest himself and to confirm his word with us to prove that he is the same yesterday today and forever seeing that come to pass then lord we are bringing this sick tonight to this platform to lay hands upon them and pronounce your blessing if we shall lay hands upon something that you've cursed god withholds your blessings but if everyone has repented of their sins and they're ready to receive me i pray that you'll heal every person that's in divine presence tonight granted lord these that raised up their hands just a few moments ago lord may while the meeting is going on tonight they will receive the power of the holy spirit that he'll sow dead in their earth bound conscience until they'll think on him saying about him talk about him until he appears to them lord and changes them granted we committed all to the now looking for your great hand to perform these things that your word has promised and we have asked in the name of the lord jesus we pray amen do you love him oh that wonderful jesus that son of god that soul come down and made himself man that he could catch death caught the stinger of death in his own flesh and pulled it out the thing of death would never hurt us we're free from him let's sing our good old song i love him all right sonny boy let's get going now everybody's saying as we worship him message is over the prayer line fixing to be called let's say now [Laughter] [Music] my [Music] [Music] let's bow our heads real sweetly now and close our eyes and raise our hands if we really want to worship him saints low now [Music] [Music] first lovely [Music] just my [Music] [Music] all together now with the lord's prayer our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thine will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us of our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen jesus said when you pray that if you have ought in your heart forgive every man from your heart his trespass or if you do not from your heart forgive every trespass that mine has done against you neither does your heavenly father forgive you yours so to enter this line be free from sin confess your faults one to another pray one for another that you may be healed i'm going to ask our brother now what i call the prayer line i want to call him just one by one so that you won't make this a terrible condition and how many here that has prayer card now raise up your hands just come across a scene and he landed in another country and a little woman come along without any prestige anyone to bring her many years she'd had a flooding and a blood issue and no doctors could cure perhaps she'd sell it all she had to pay the physicians and they had tried hard but had failed but she believed that she could touch his garments she'd get well and she went through the crowd and touched his garment now the palestinian garment has an underneath garment and a road that hangs loose and she touched the border that would probably be that far from me swinging loose and she touched the border with her finger went back through the crowd and sat down stood up for whatever she did jesus stopped and said who touched me just think of that now i remember we're talking about jesus everything in the healing lines to my opinion has to be scriptural has to be on the bible has to be what he was what he'd done just what he done then he is the one we're looking to today he is the one that promised to be here the same yesterday and forever is there any strangers in here there's never been one of the meetings before i guess one woman two two people let's see all right so the woman touched me went back and sat down and she sitting there and jesus said who touched me and peter come up and just literally you rebuked him the bible said what imagine the apostle said something like this what do you mean by seeing a thing like that why yours 500 people and every one of them is touching you jesus said but i got weak virtue went from him and he looked around in the audience and he found the woman and he told her her blood issue had stopped because her faith had made her well is that right now how many of you ministers and bible readers knows that the bible the new testament that jesus christ is the same yesterday and forever how many knows that the bible said that he is right now on the right hand of god in the majesty on high his literal body sitting there a high priest making intercessions upon our confession and he can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities now his body's up there his spirits down here his body is spirit god's spirit work through that body his virgin born son in the fullness of god he works through you and i as portions of god that's why the holy spirit when it come on the day of pentecost it broke all up that pillar of fire and divided itself in lips of tongues and set up on each one we have to have one another the biggest thing the devil ever got on us was when he separated us from the love of god from one another and we love one another that's brotherly love when we can get to one another if you've got part of the holy ghost and i got part of the next man's got part of it put us together there's three parts i'm three times as strong as it was with you two brothers see that's where we stand i'm a real kentuckian together we stand and divide it we'll fall that's right we must stand that way together now if jesus christ is the same high priest that that woman touched by the feeling of her infirmities and he's the same high priest he'll act the same he'll do the same if you can touch him now today he's only you can't touch him with your finger you've got to touch him with your faith is that right is that right your faith is what touches you you can't touch me your finger because he's sitting on the throne of god i may believe that jesus overcome and set out on god's throne and promise that if we overcome we will set with him on his throne as he's overcome and set down on god's throne that's exactly what he said all right then if that is so then if you tonight are out there here's all the prayer cards standing and you're out there without prayer cards and you will believe with all your heart that your faith can touch him and you believe it then god will answer and act just the same as a high priest did at the beginning you believe that have you got the all the clear lines of whole 50 of the third part that be tonight the reason i call the whole bunch this is not a line of discernment this is not afraid for the sake the discernment comes each night in the meetings but he's here just the same do you believe that sure is if there's not one thing done he's still here to heal the sick how many out there now that is sick yet i see your hands if how many out there that raise your hands believe that when jesus is here on earth that the way he made himself known being a messiah he could tell the people what was their trouble and so forth how many knows that knows that that's a promise of the bible well then you know that i could not be him because he's sitting on the right hand of god but he promised the works that he did what we do also he promised in the last days that the church should grow so close from the days of luther justification days of wesley sanctification days of the pentecost the restoration gets right into the headstone and through that would bring forth the whole body the resurrection of every believer but as a the spirit of god grows closer just like the shadow of my hand the shadow gets darker and darker and darker until the shadow and the hand becomes the same thing the church come from justification sanctification baptism holy ghost now going into the very headstone and the presence of the angel of god jesus christ the holy ghost so present doing exactly the same works that he did on earth which is bringing forth the church and the christ and unite together just exactly what he promised i don't let your conscience be dull now wake up my heavenly father i promise the people just to bring them through this prayer line and pray for him but i pray thee father that you will grant at least one or two people somewhere in here that have witnessed because there's some here that has never known this only two hands that went up but they'd never been in the meetings before but lord that might be the very few people that you're calling tonight so to be sure that if the day of judgment i want nothing that i have left undone i pray thee father for a few moments that if you'll send your holy spirit out among those people and charge their bodies as they raise their hands a while ago that you will perform the same works here that you did like the woman at the well when you talk to her a man and a woman and you told her where her secret was what her trouble was why she said sir i perceive that you're a prophet we know that when the messiah cometh he'll tell us these things and he said i'm he that speaks to you she ran into the city and told the man come see a man that's told me the things i've done isn't this the messiah god granted again tonight we asked it in jesus name amen each night i've been turning my back to the audience that you might know and god to vindicate that there how many knows that jesus said as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man he said uh what happened at sodom now he said it was the days of noah eight souls were saved by water well you see where the minority is going to be before the caps put on the stone comes back now that chief cornerstone goes into the building and fits it together now he said what that would be he said what they were doing in the days of no eating drinking marrying and giving in marriage but when he come to sodom he left that for the discernment of the church i see there was a believer lukewarm church member and an unbeliever and abraham was out of sodom which means he elected and called out the church and that one two angels went down into sodom they'd done a few things such as smite and blind putting curse on the people to the church member had a meeting called for mercy from the run out but they didn't do it just like the message goes forth today but there's one angel who stayed with the church elect and he said to abraham now he was a stranger he said abraham where is your wife sarah your wife sarah stranger said in the tent behind you said i'm not going to keep this from you ah personal pronoun now i'm not going to keep this from you but according to time of life sarah's going to be a young woman again you've heard me preach on it and she's going to go back have this baby and sarah in the tent behind the man had never seen him in the tent laughed within herself and the angel with his back turned said why did sarah laugh abraham calling elohim not the man sitting there eating steak and drinking milk eating cornbread but it was the spirit that was in him now what was it a sign of that the spirit of god would dwell in the flesh of people again and show the same sign before the end time as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming son of man now sodom was the one that burned fire fell out of the heavens and burned them and that's what's going to happen again it ain't going to be water it's going to be fire so the angel of mercy comes with the same message to warn the people stay away from sodom now you pray and see if you can touch his garment and may he add his blessing just a moment billy i want these people out here in the audience first then when i start that line just let them know that the holy spirit's here and people's got prayer cards listening to brother church in the scriptures you can't deny but what is the scripture and i need tonight let him speak to me you don't know me let him tell me what i'm suffering with or something about me i'll believe lord i'll tell everybody there is that i can contact that jesus christ is soon coming the son of god and he's the great healer here it is there's a woman sitting right here looking down praying she raised her head look at me she's suffering with headaches do you believe the lord jesus will make you well lady sitting there a second woman in from the line in the back of the line there you believe that he'll make you well you believe those headaches will stop if you do raise up your hand all right they'll leave you now you believe with all your heart here this man sitting right here with his head down praying suffering with oppression do you believe that god will heal you and take that oppression away from you if you do raise up your hand all right you had more faith than you thought you had have you now the devil's been lying to you now you know that but he's left you now almost be happy and sing and rejoice have faith in god if thou canst believe all things are possible you believe that the bible said so this man here sitting here believing too but it isn't him there's somebody else that's believing isn't the man it's a colored woman she's suffering with heart trouble she has oppression also god let me know who it is her name is mrs hagwood where are you at mrs hagwood your faith has healed you go home and be well jesus christ heals you remain the same

your trouble is will you believe me to be his servant you will you know where strangers are so the people and always raise up our hands so if they'll know that we're strangers i've never seen the man know nothing about him now he he he he had a prayer card i suppose is in the line he had a prayer card rest them without prayer cards but you might know the prayer card has nothing to do with it now be real reverent now if you can real quiet don't move around see each one of you is a spirit you know that all right now you can put your hand down and look here if jesus is the same yesterday today and forever then he'll do the same would it help you if i was able by the holy spirit to tell you what your trouble is would that help you not knowing it i have to have some way of knowing this you believe it would be christ just by gift it wouldn't heal you but it would help you have faith to be healed because your healing is already done no matter what i'd say it still wouldn't heal you but it would raise your faith because you know we don't know one another would it help the rest of you all out there to believe a man suffers with a blood condition diabetes right how you believe would it
