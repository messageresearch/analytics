[13:54] [Music]
[14:13] I had a little testimony to share I had
[14:17] the children the youngest Sunday school
[14:19] class and sister Angela had said she had
[14:22] this little project to
[14:23] teach the children about prayer
[14:27] and that was such a wonderful subject
[14:30] for me I got to thinking about how that
[14:33] really everyone said
[14:34] prayer is the greatest Force there is on
[14:36] Earth
[14:37] it's greater than any paraphrasing
[14:40] greater than any atomic bomb there is
[14:43] and I thought
[14:45] it's because
[14:46] he's the one that
[14:48] created the universe
[14:51] and I was like he's my God and he
[14:55] and he and I was pondering over that and
[14:57] I went to read the Bible because you
[14:59] know what are Christians supposed to do
[15:01] because we love to read the word of God
[15:07] and I opened up the Bible and it said I
[15:10] stretched forth the heavens and I laid
[15:11] the foundations of the Earth
[15:14] and it really blessed me I really
[15:17] praised the Lord for his goodness
[15:26] [Music]
[15:43] and all these things shall be added to
[15:49] you
[15:50] Hallelujah
[15:52] [Music]
[15:59] man shall not live by Red
[16:04] alone
[16:06] [Music]
[16:18] from the mouth
[16:20] of God
[16:25] [Music]
[16:31] ask and it shall be given unto you
[16:39] seeking can keep
[16:42] shall find
[16:46] knock and the door shall be open time to
[16:52] you
[16:55] hallelujah hallelujah
[16:58] [Music]
[17:02] Hallelujah
[17:05] Hallelujah

[19:47] amen do you want him to hold your hand
[19:51] hey man if I could just grab a hold of
[19:54] his hand I know everything would be okay
[19:56] I remember walking the kids when they
[19:58] were little
[19:59] walking them outside of wherever it was
[20:02] and
[20:04] as long as me as a father as long as
[20:06] that whole had a hold of that little
[20:08] hand
[20:09] I knew that they couldn't fall I knew
[20:12] that nothing could ever happen to him
[20:13] and
[20:14] I'm that little baby that wants to grab
[20:16] a hold of that hand that unfailing hand
[20:21] um brother
[20:23] Stephen
[20:24] we heal brother Aaron's son-in-law
[20:28] we prayed
[20:30] for a friend of his last week with
[20:33] pneumonia and he writes that a man is
[20:37] doing much better and he's possibly
[20:39] coming home from the hospital tomorrow
[20:42] to thank the Lord for that
[20:46] brother Aaron writes
[20:49] that his boss brother Danny a man named
[20:52] Danny Silvis
[20:54] he uh they thought he had a stroke and
[20:57] it looks like he was diagnosed with
[20:59] Bell's palsy so he asked for prayer for
[21:02] this man
[21:04] sister Carol linhardt
[21:06] she writes
[21:07] please pray for my brother
[21:10] he is having extreme pain again and this
[21:13] time
[21:14] he's transferred from rehab to TMC
[21:19] so let's pray for sister Carol
[21:23] her brother
[21:24] there which
[21:26] is which brother is that
[21:28] Brother David okay
[21:31] and um
[21:33] another prayer request
[21:36] sister Nina but Aaron's daughter she has
[21:39] a co-worker's grandson
[21:43] I believe I got it right he's two weeks
[21:44] old
[21:45] and he's losing weight he's vomiting and
[21:48] he's in the hospital
[21:50] so let's pray for the little baby and
[21:53] that the Lord would touch him
[21:56] and brother Kevin Carey texted me he
[21:58] says this he says pray for me he says
[22:01] I'm having
[22:04] parents sentences done on Friday
[22:08] and he asked prayer that everything will
[22:10] go all right
[22:13] and I believe it will
[22:15] you know Sister Hope's song there
[22:19] let's put some scriptures together
[22:23] it's uh just beautiful
[22:26] that ask and it shall be given seek and
[22:28] ye shall find knock and it shall be
[22:31] opened to you
[22:32] so we know that if we pray
[22:34] and if we ask the Lord
[22:37] and we do it with faith
[22:40] that it's not according to anything
[22:43] other than he made a promise that we can
[22:46] have
[22:47] what we ask for
[22:50] and sister Cheryl also asked sister
[22:53] Cheryl if you'd come forward sister
[22:55] Cheryl also asked that we would
[22:58] anoint her with oil
[23:01] In The Name Of The Lord
[23:03] that she might be healed if she's been
[23:06] struggling with pneumonia having trouble
[23:08] breathing and it's just it's been really
[23:10] hard on her
[23:11] so brother Jonathan if you could come
[23:13] down with me with a microphone
[23:21] we do this
[23:23] according to the word of God according
[23:25] to the Book of James it says for the
[23:27] elders to anoint the sick with oil and
[23:30] to pray for them and that they shall be
[23:33] healed that's a good enough promise for
[23:35] me
[23:36] and I was telling sister Cheryl before
[23:38] service that I've been I've been amazed
[23:42] at how many people have come
[23:45] to be Anointed with oil over the past
[23:46] few months and that have been healed
[23:49] and just going through this
[23:53] as anointing with oil according to what
[23:55] God
[23:56] ordained through his servant Pastor
[24:00] James
[24:01] the Bible sister Cheryl the soil
[24:05] it represents
[24:07] the Holy Spirit
[24:10] and we do this as a commandment it's not
[24:13] the Holy Spirit but it's what it
[24:15] represents and when I anoint you with
[24:18] oil
[24:19] the Bible teaches us to whatever you do
[24:21] in word or D do all in the name of the
[24:22] Lord Jesus so brother Jonathan you could
[24:25] hold this
[24:27] [Music]
[24:28] Gerald
[24:31] I anoint you according to the word of
[24:33] God
[24:34] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[24:39] I lay my hands on you brother Jonathan
[24:44] father it is a great honor that we can
[24:47] read this Bible and see that
[24:51] you have given us these instructions on
[24:55] how to be how to be healed
[24:59] father we bring sister Cheryl before you
[25:01] in the name of Jesus Christ and claim
[25:04] her healing because now we have done
[25:07] what has been
[25:09] instructed to us to do now we have done
[25:12] it now Lord we lay it into your hands
[25:15] and ask for her complete healing in
[25:17] Jesus Christ's name
[25:19] and father for these other requests
[25:22] with the baby and and Lord the other
[25:24] ones that

[25:30] these people and knows who they are Lord

[25:38] that they would be healed
[25:40] and Lord that you would be glorified and

[25:45] time is limited on Earth as we grow
[25:48] older we get sick and and we die and

[26:31] we have a great blessing
[26:34] once again
[26:36] to open up this Bible
[26:40] the book of Acts
[26:42] and read what God did two thousand years
[26:45] ago through people that had faith
[26:48] and as I read through this book I just
[26:51] thank God that it never ended
[26:54] it has just continued on to this day in
[26:57] the same holy spirit that was with the
[26:59] apostle that we will hear about tonight
[27:02] is the same holy spirit that is with us
[27:05] today he said I am God and I change not
[27:11] if he was a Healer
[27:13] way back four or five thousand years ago
[27:17] he was a Healer 2000 years ago and he's
[27:19] a Healer tonight
[27:20] [Music]
[27:22] I appreciate her brother Lyle
[27:25] appreciate the
[27:27] work that he does
[27:29] that
[27:31] all of his labors and all of his efforts
[27:33] that we can benefit from them and we can
[27:35] understand this book
[27:37] a little bit better
[27:39] brother Jonathan if you have one more
[27:40] song while our brother comes

[29:48] [Music]
[29:59] thank you thank you
[30:01] good evening
[30:02] God bless you
[30:04] thank you for being here that song is
[30:07] just I think a wonderful lead-in to what
[30:10] we're going to be reading and studying
[30:12] about tonight in Acts 27.
[30:15] uh
[30:17] it's kind of sad
[30:19] not so much for what the chapter
[30:21] contains but realizing that we're coming
[30:23] to the end of our study of Acts
[30:25] I found strength and joy working on this
[30:28] and sharing
[30:30] but I'm confident the Lord has more
[30:32] Bible study for us laying ahead to learn
[30:35] and share together if you have ideas for
[30:38] topics or books that you'd like to
[30:40] pursue
[30:41] please let your pastor know
[30:45] this chapter 27 is a swashbuckling
[30:48] Maritime Adventure transporting the
[30:50] Roman prisoner Paul along with some of
[30:53] his friends from caesarea to Rome except
[30:58] they don't make it they don't get to
[31:00] Rome that's the Final Chapter next week
[31:04] before we open our Bibles and read
[31:06] Luke's account of these experiences
[31:07] let's pray together to the one that
[31:09] inspired him
[31:11] Lord it is such a privilege
[31:13] it's an honor
[31:15] it's a challenge
[31:17] but Lord it is just
[31:19] so wonderful to be gathered together
[31:23] with precious sisters and brothers young
[31:26] and old Lord that have a desire to draw
[31:29] closer to you to learn more of your word
[31:31] and Lord not to learn in our head Lord
[31:34] but to have that life in our heart Lord
[31:36] that can flow out and strengthen and
[31:38] help others Lord I pray that you'd help
[31:41] me to lay aside the the the the the the
[31:44] thoughts the cares of this world each
[31:47] one of us Lord forgive us Lord where we
[31:50] fall short where we miss the mark Lord
[31:52] and help us Lord draw us all closer
[31:54] together and to you to one another we
[31:57] thank you in Jesus precious name amen
[32:02] recall from chapters 24 through 26 that
[32:07] the Roman officials which hold trials
[32:09] and pass judgment in this case two
[32:12] different Governors and a king is an
[32:14] advisor each realized Paul is innocent
[32:17] but none will release him
[32:19] they're playing a delicate political
[32:21] game with the religious leaders of The
[32:23] Devout Judean population majority
[32:25] passions are strong there's rebellion in
[32:28] the air
[32:29] the Roman authorities want to prevent an
[32:31] uprising so try to appease the Jewish
[32:34] population to the extent they can while
[32:36] watching out for their own self-interest
[32:39] pox Romana the piece of Rome
[32:42] Paul's frustrated with what he sees as
[32:44] their hypocrisy and he may have other
[32:46] motives as well and a search is right as
[32:48] a Roman citizen to appeal his case for
[32:50] judgment in Rome I appeal to Caesar he
[32:52] said let's read the closing verses of
[32:55] chapter 26 to set the Tate set the stage
[32:58] for tonight's study
[33:01] and when he Paul had thus spoken sharing
[33:05] his testimony in the court the audience
[33:07] including many if not most of the
[33:09] high-ranking officials and the Roman
[33:12] Capital there of caesarea over the
[33:14] province of Judea the king and that's
[33:16] the grip of the second rose up and the
[33:19] governor fellow named Festus who had
[33:21] recently come to the governorship and
[33:23] Bernice the King's sister and they that
[33:26] sat with them they gathered Nobles and
[33:28] officials of the administration in
[33:30] caesarea
[33:31] and when they were gone aside out of the
[33:34] Court chambers that they that's Festus
[33:36] Agrippa Burness talked between
[33:39] themselves saying oh this man there was
[33:42] nothing worthy of death or for that
[33:44] matter even of bonds
[33:46] why is he even here
[33:48] then Agrippa said unto Festus this man
[33:52] might have been said at Liberty if he
[33:54] had not appealed unto Caesar
[33:57] hmm
[33:58] might have been please take your seats
[34:03] Festus could have easily offered him his
[34:06] choice of Freedom or Caesar simply
[34:08] dismissing his case declaring him
[34:10] innocent
[34:11] but Paul's appeal gives Festus an out
[34:14] and a very tense political atmosphere if
[34:18] you recall however the purpose of the
[34:21] hearing
[34:22] of Paul speaking in chapter 26 was to
[34:25] help Festus figure out would you charge
[34:26] Paul with before he sent him off to Rome
[34:28] seems like I should but these lists why
[34:31] I'm sending him we're not told What
[34:33] charges it is that Festus finally
[34:35] settled on but the scene is now set
[34:37] Paul will be sent to Rome for trial it's
[34:40] now late summer I believe the year is 60
[34:43] A.D at this point the weather is
[34:46] acceptable for sailing west from
[34:48] caesarea to Italy
[34:50] sailing's faster more directly less
[34:53] expensive and less risky than marching
[34:55] over land which would include crossing
[34:57] the mountainous terrain of the Balkans
[34:59] so the decision is made and now we go to
[35:03] acts 27
[35:04] and verse 1.
[35:06] and when it was determined and here
[35:09] doesn't mean when they finally made up
[35:10] their mind but it but the when is when
[35:13] the time came it had been determined so
[35:16] the time came that we
[35:18] so Luke has now indicated his presence
[35:20] with Paul in the narrative we'll talk a
[35:22] bit about that later
[35:24] determine that we should sail in Italy
[35:26] they the Roman authorities in caesarea
[35:29] delivered Paul and certain other
[35:31] prisoners unto one named Julius a
[35:34] centurion of Augustus band
[35:37] the Emperor Augustus is long dead this
[35:40] this is a regimental name it's some
[35:42] translations say the Imperial regiment
[35:44] the emperor's regiment the Augustine
[35:46] regiment just like when I was in the
[35:48] Army I served in the 101st Airborne that
[35:51] was just the name of the thing there
[35:52] weren't 101 of us
[35:54] entering into a ship
[35:57] of or from adramitium in other words the
[36:00] ship was registered in her owned by
[36:02] someone from the city of adromedium it's
[36:04] a bit south of troas
[36:06] sure you all have that pictured clearly
[36:08] in your mind we launched from the port
[36:11] of caesarea meaning to Sail by the ports
[36:14] along the coasts of Asia Southern turkey
[36:16] in today's world one aristarchus a
[36:20] Macedonian or thessalonica
[36:23] being with us accompanying us
[36:26] Luke doesn't tell us how many of Paul's
[36:29] friends and companions are traveling
[36:31] with him but he's careful to name this
[36:34] man
[36:35] aristarchus and even where he is from
[36:39] his address if you will
[36:41] well let's flash back about three years
[36:43] to Ephesus near the end of Paul's
[36:45] three-year Ministry there recall there
[36:48] was a riot instigated by Demetrius and
[36:50] the silversmiths I see Demetrius sitting
[36:52] on the front row
[36:55] and the whole city of Ephesus was filled
[36:59] with confusion
[37:00] and having caught Gaius and aristarchus
[37:03] Men of Macedonia Paul's Companions and
[37:06] travel they rushed with one Accord into
[37:08] the theater
[37:10] so at some point while Paul was
[37:13] ministering in Ephesus aristarchus had
[37:15] traveled from thessalonica in Macedonia
[37:19] northern Greece we'd think of it today
[37:21] over to where Paul was on this port city
[37:24] in the coast of what is modern day
[37:26] turkey and he was working with
[37:29] perhaps he'd accompany Paul to Antioch
[37:32] perhaps he heard Paul was an Ephesus and
[37:34] wanted to come and help we don't know
[37:35] when he joined up with Paul only that by
[37:38] this time in Ephesus aristarchus was
[37:41] with Paul
[37:43] well after Paul left Ephesus he traveled
[37:45] to Troast to Philippi thessalonica and
[37:48] so forth on his way to Corinth when he
[37:51] learned there was going to be an ambush
[37:52] there if he took a ship to Judea he
[37:54] retraced the steps Overland back through
[37:55] Macedonia and on to troas and and Acts
[37:58] 20 we read and there accompanied him
[38:01] from Philippi into troa support City in
[38:04] Asia what we think of as Western turkey
[38:07] sopater of Berea and of the
[38:10] Thessalonians or a starkas and secundus
[38:13] and gas of Derby and timothius and of
[38:16] Asia tikius and trophymus
[38:20] so we see here that aristarchus who had
[38:23] been with Paul and Ephesus accompanied
[38:24] Paul to Corinth and then back to Asia on
[38:27] the journey to Jerusalem along with Luke
[38:29] and the others
[38:31] well after Paul was apprehended and
[38:33] trundled off to caesarea while Felix was
[38:35] governor we read in Acts 24 verse 23
[38:37] that he Felix commanded a centurion to
[38:40] keep to Guard Paul to let him have
[38:43] Liberty that he should forbid none of
[38:45] his acquaintance to minister or come
[38:46] unto him so clearly there were some
[38:50] people that wanted to spend a little
[38:52] time with Paul and be with him while he
[38:53] was in bonds there
[38:55] well based on what we're reading in Acts
[38:58] 27 it appears that both Luke and
[39:01] aristarchus went to caesarea were among
[39:04] the acquaintances that came to
[39:05] administer to Paul during his captivity
[39:08] it's likely some of the others listed
[39:10] were also there at least for a while
[39:13] now some two years have elapsed we don't
[39:16] have instant Communications two years of
[39:18] elapsing we see these two Faithful
[39:20] Friends accompanying Paul on his journey
[39:22] to Rome
[39:23] it's incumbent on the Empire of course
[39:25] to provide Paul transport to Rome
[39:28] Luke and Ours tarkus are responsible for
[39:30] their own expenses travel lodging food
[39:33] this isn't a cheap internet fair and
[39:36] frencher Airlines it's a lengthy
[39:38] expensive uncomfortable and dangerous
[39:41] Journey
[39:43] later while Paul is in prison in Rome
[39:46] he'll write several letters Colossians
[39:48] and Philemon are among the first of the
[39:51] letters that he writes
[39:53] and they're sent together
[39:55] by trusted couriers one is a general
[39:57] letter to the church at colossae and to
[39:59] be shared with the church in laodicea
[40:01] the other is a personal letter to find
[40:04] an Iman on behalf of one of the couriers
[40:06] an escaped slave
[40:09] named onesimus
[40:11] at this time early in his period of
[40:14] detention in Rome Lucas still with him
[40:16] we read in the list of greetings at the
[40:19] end of Colossians Colossians 4 14 Paul
[40:22] writes Luke the Beloved Physician and
[40:26] Demas greet you
[40:29] at the end of the short letter to
[40:31] Philemon Paul mentions others that are
[40:33] with him at this time early in his time
[40:36] there in Rome Marcus Aris tarkas Demas
[40:41] Lucas my fellow laborers
[40:45] so not only is Luke his dear and
[40:48] faithful friend but aristarchus is still
[40:52] by his side at work to spread the gospel
[40:55] to assist Paul
[40:57] a fellow laborer
[41:00] in both these letters he mentions a
[41:02] fellow believer in labor in the ministry
[41:04] a fellow named Demas
[41:06] sadly later and the final chapter of his
[41:10] very last epistle
[41:12] Demus will have left Paul when Paul will
[41:14] lament his own lonely State as he faces
[41:16] execution he writes to Timothy in second
[41:18] Timothy 4. do thy diligence to come
[41:21] shortly to me
[41:23] Demas hath forsaken me he's left me
[41:25] having loved this present world and is
[41:28] departed into thessalonica
[41:30] crescents to galatia Titus unto Dalmatia
[41:33] only Luke is with me
[41:35] take Mark bring him with thee he's
[41:37] profitable to me for the ministry
[41:41] only Luke
[41:43] is with me
[41:46] in one sense it's so sad that only Luke
[41:49] is still there with Paul
[41:53] but in another sense
[41:56] that this physician has stuck with Paul
[41:59] through so many years of hardship
[42:02] Solomon tells us in Proverbs 18 24 that
[42:05] there's a friend that sits closer than
[42:07] her brother
[42:08] Luke was just such a friend to Paul
[42:13] there's one other mention that includes
[42:15] aristarchus and which speaks volumes to
[42:18] me also found in Colossians 4 verse 10.
[42:21] here he says aristarchist my fellow
[42:24] prisoner salutes greets you and Marcus
[42:26] sister son to Barnabas
[42:29] sounds like a nephew some translation
[42:31] say cousin touching concerning or about
[42:34] whom you receive Commandments or
[42:36] instructions if you come to receive them
[42:39] here again we see aristarchus here Paul
[42:41] calls him a fellow prisoner it's not a
[42:43] prisoner of Rome he's a prisoner of
[42:46] Jesus Christ
[42:48] well please note at this time
[42:51] so many years after their dispute over
[42:53] John Mark Paul is still associating and
[42:56] identifying himself with Barnabas
[43:00] here he mentions that Barnabas relative
[43:02] Marcus is with the Massachusetts to
[43:04] receive him if he comes
[43:06] in these simple lists of greetings
[43:09] I think there's truth that we can find
[43:11] that we can apply
[43:14] to our lives today
[43:17] it's supposed to be certifax get back to
[43:19] acts 27 while okay they've just boarded
[43:21] the ship
[43:22] they've loosed from caesarea
[43:25] and the next day we touched it sidon
[43:27] this is on the coast of modern day
[43:29] Lebanon it's about 78 miles due north of
[43:32] caesarea and Julius the Centurion
[43:35] guarding the prisoners courteously
[43:37] untreated Paul and gave him Liberty to
[43:40] go ashore unto his friends to refresh
[43:42] himself
[43:44] and when after we returned to the ship
[43:47] we had launched from fence from sidon we
[43:50] sailed under Cyprus that means on the
[43:53] leeward side if the wind is blowing you
[43:54] have the windward side and you have the
[43:57] leeward side where the wind is uh
[44:00] attenuated someone by the by the land
[44:02] mass so they're on the leeward side
[44:05] using the island as a shield from the
[44:06] winds why because the winds were
[44:09] contrary
[44:10] it wasn't exactly going in their
[44:11] Direction
[44:14] and when we had sailed Over the Sea of
[44:16] selicia in pamphilia this tells us that
[44:19] they were sailing north of Cyprus we
[44:21] came to Myra a city of lycea
[44:24] and there in Myra Julius the Centurion
[44:28] found a ship of from Alexandria which
[44:31] was sailing into Italy and since that's
[44:35] where we wanted to go he put us on it
[44:39] so here on this map those of you sitting
[44:42] in the back you're really supposed to
[44:43] sit really close to the front see but
[44:45] but anyway you can squint or bring
[44:47] binoculars next time but anyway uh up
[44:51] here is this place
[44:54] adromedium where this ship came from
[44:56] here's caesarea where they're leaving
[44:58] they stop in sidon and then the winds
[45:01] aren't helping and they come along this
[45:03] way and find they make it to this little
[45:04] place over here
[45:10] so
[45:12] so it makes you wonder a little bit
[45:14] about what these ships might be like
[45:15] this is an image from a coin that
[45:18] commemorates the Roman Harbor it's
[45:21] showing various types of ships how the
[45:23] sails were furled for example here or if
[45:26] the sales let out like you see here
[45:30] um
[45:31] and this was under the reign of mirror
[45:34] this coin is from 62 A.D so this coin
[45:36] was minted and put into circulation
[45:38] while Paul was in prison in Rome
[45:42] the merchant ship's cargo capacity and
[45:44] that time varied from about 70 up to 600
[45:47] tons for the largest ships most ships
[45:50] had a cargo capacity of 100 to 150 tons
[45:55] here's a model of such a ship you can
[45:58] see that it has it has a Mainsail it's a
[46:00] square sail it's not like modern sales
[46:03] and it has a for sale and this
[46:05] particular one has two Rudders there's
[46:07] no wheelhouse per se you got some
[46:10] hopefully strong guys that are hanging
[46:12] on to the thing they're trying to steer
[46:14] the ship as well as by using the tackle
[46:16] with the sail there's no Keel for it to
[46:19] work against but the ship does have a
[46:22] definite draft it's it it's not a flat
[46:25] bottom boat that's easily maneuverable
[46:27] and very unstable it's much more stable
[46:30] designed to go into ports not to land on
[46:32] beaches or anything and this little
[46:35] illustration out here gives you an idea
[46:36] the size of a typical ship compared to
[46:38] like a modern city bus or your car
[46:42] and of course if you can see little tiny
[46:45] dot here
[46:47] well I don't look at it Lyle
[46:51] right under the tube that's a person
[46:53] give you an idea of the the size of this
[46:56] stuff
[46:58] okay
[47:00] um I found a website I don't know that
[47:02] it's 100 accurate but it made these
[47:05] claims about this sort of thing said
[47:07] there were no passenger ships per se in
[47:10] first century Rome no luxury Cruise
[47:12] Lines or anything similar people willing
[47:14] to travel by ship had to board a
[47:16] merchant ship there were no passenger
[47:18] liners they would first have to find a
[47:20] ship could be almost any kind of ship
[47:22] then they'd have to get the captain's
[47:24] approval the price would be negotiated
[47:25] with the captain most of the times
[47:28] passengers would bring their own food
[47:29] supplies covers mattresses even a tent
[47:32] to sleep on Deck sometimes there'd be
[47:34] hundreds of people on the deck there
[47:36] were no restaurants or any of the
[47:38] luxuries the today ships passengers
[47:39] could use the ships facilities to cook
[47:41] their meals and you can see that on this
[47:44] ship there's just there's no shade
[47:47] there's no air conditioning there's no
[47:50] ensuite there's no toilets
[47:52] and you've got a lot of people crowded
[47:55] on the deck
[47:57] no heaters no air conditioners
[48:00] um
[48:01] the uh I look at something like this and
[48:04] I remember
[48:06] several years ago probably it's been 25
[48:08] or 30 years now back when I worked for
[48:10] the company that you're working for
[48:12] brother
[48:13] um I was in London England and I had to
[48:15] get to Sydney Australia so I got on a
[48:18] non-stop from from London to Los Angeles
[48:21] about 12 hours and about a four hour
[48:23] layover and then a 16-hour flight down
[48:25] to Sydney Australia
[48:27] and I was sitting there by the time I
[48:29] got to LAX feeling a little bit sorry
[48:31] for myself that I have to and I have to
[48:33] endure sitting in this air-conditioned
[48:35] safe stable tube with meals being served
[48:38] to me in a large comfortable seat for
[48:41] almost a day and a half to travel more
[48:43] than halfway around the world and I got
[48:45] to thinking a little bit was I was
[48:47] feeling sorry for myself I thought about
[48:49] what about those people back I was not
[48:52] thinking back in these days I was
[48:53] thinking back in uh you know the days of
[48:56] wooden sailing ships 1600 17 1800s
[48:59] whether it took days and days to cross
[49:02] the ocean and and very uh
[49:05] less comfortable than I was in a 747
[49:08] going from London to uh
[49:11] London to Sydney
[49:13] I had no idea how tough a Germany Paul's
[49:16] would have been but oh speaking of Paul
[49:17] let's get back to Paul acts 27 7. when
[49:20] we had sail slowly many days
[49:24] and scarce will come over against
[49:26] canitis it's a small island off the
[49:28] southwest of modern turkey
[49:30] just north of roads in that Rocky at jnc
[49:34] that we've talked about before the wind
[49:36] not suffering us the wind wasn't going
[49:38] our way
[49:39] we sailed under right we know that's the
[49:42] leeward side of Crete over against
[49:44] salmon and hardly passing it we came to
[49:48] a place which is called the fair Havens
[49:50] and I were unto is a city of Lucia and
[49:53] and that's where they docked
[49:55] so here we see that path they made from
[49:58] Myra here snaking their way through
[50:00] these islands there's that canitus
[50:03] roads is
[50:05] obviously a bit more visible here and
[50:07] they came down to Crete and they came to
[50:09] this place right in this little southern
[50:10] tip of Creek Fair Haven and that city of
[50:13] uh Lucia was was very nearby
[50:18] now it says when much time was spent
[50:22] so they I don't know if that means that
[50:24] they were in that City for a long time
[50:28] I don't know Sailors on Shore leave when
[50:31] sailing was now dangerous because the
[50:34] fast
[50:35] was already passed the fast
[50:38] he's talking about Yom Kippur
[50:40] the day of atonement in the year 60 A.D
[50:43] that fell in the 24th of September for
[50:46] us it was just last week September 24
[50:48] and 25 so it was exactly this time of
[50:50] year
[50:52] Early Autumn the weather starting to get
[50:54] unstable in the Eastern Mediterranean
[50:56] for a Westward sailing
[50:58] in fact commercial navigation in the
[51:01] Mediterranean was suspended during the
[51:03] four winter months this was known as the
[51:05] moderate Clausen yeah but I got Google
[51:09] Translate to read the Latin to me that's
[51:11] mare Clausen that's Latin for closed C
[51:15] in other words
[51:17] don't get on the water
[51:19] so because the fast was now already
[51:21] passed Paul admonished them
[51:23] he said unto them
[51:25] sirs sirs I perceive that this Voyage
[51:29] will be with hurt
[51:32] and much damage not only of the lading
[51:35] the the cargo and ship
[51:38] but also of Our Lives
[51:41] Paul may have had a sense of foreboding
[51:43] that caused him to make this comment but
[51:45] it's not a prophecy per se could be as
[51:48] simple as moderate closum and Paul's
[51:51] previous experience it was being
[51:52] Shipwrecked in the ajayan multiple times
[51:54] Luke tells us in this verse that it was
[51:57] due to the season
[52:00] this because the fast was already passed
[52:03] that's why Paul made this statement
[52:06] okay that plays into another statement
[52:09] he makes in a bit verse 11 nevertheless
[52:12] Julius the Centurion believed the master
[52:15] and owner of the ship more than those
[52:17] things which were spoken by Paul
[52:20] this should not be a surprise the
[52:22] shipmaster owner he was a sailor and he
[52:25] had a lot at risk Paul wasn't a seaman
[52:28] he was a passenger and besides that he
[52:31] was under guard criminal accused
[52:34] criminal being transported for trial
[52:37] so
[52:38] because the Haven which were more the
[52:41] city of lacia was not commodious to
[52:44] Winter in the Sailors would prefer to be
[52:48] somewhere else the more part the
[52:50] majority of the ships grew advised to
[52:52] depart fence also if by any means they
[52:54] might attain to Venus or Phoenix
[52:58] and there to Winter
[52:59] which is in Haven of Crete
[53:02] and lieth towards the Southwest it's the
[53:04] southwest of the island of Crete and
[53:07] Northwest Northwest of their current
[53:09] location
[53:10] so we see the ship's owner and crew
[53:12] weren't intending to go very far a short
[53:14] day's sailing distance they hold up the
[53:17] risk was small they were waiting for a
[53:18] favorable wind
[53:20] Sarah we can see that they were going to
[53:22] depart from down here at the bottom
[53:24] Lacey and just go over here to Phoenix
[53:25] it's just about 50 miles it's not very
[53:28] far it's only going to take him a few
[53:29] hours
[53:33] they wanted to winter at this place it's
[53:35] a larger City we'll find out later that
[53:37] there were 276 people on board this boat
[53:41] as well as the cargo yeah you think
[53:43] while if the weather was an issue they
[53:45] wanted to go 50 miles they could have
[53:47] left a small crew to guard the boat and
[53:49] stuff and everybody else could have just
[53:50] walked
[53:52] but at 50 miles two days if you're in
[53:55] decent Health back in those days people
[53:57] tended to walk a lot but that's not what
[53:59] they did
[54:02] and when the south wind blew softly that
[54:05] is a wind from the south so it's a
[54:06] Gentle Wind coming from the south and
[54:08] they're wanting to go
[54:10] North and and and West so that's perfect
[54:14] it blew softly the ship screw supposing
[54:17] they had obtained their purpose
[54:20] loosing fence in other words they left
[54:23] the port of lysia and they sailed close
[54:25] by Crete they say close to the shore oh
[54:28] nice beautiful soft Breeze yeah oh this
[54:32] is good
[54:33] but not long after there arose against a
[54:36] trumpetuous wind called Earl Clayton
[54:39] Earl Clayton simply means Northwest it's
[54:42] a norwester we'd say in modern terms
[54:45] so there were rows this tempestuous wind
[54:50] and it burst across the island and the
[54:52] ship when the ship was caught in this
[54:55] powerful storm and could not bear up and
[54:57] that means they couldn't Steward into
[54:58] the wind they couldn't fight it it was
[55:00] too strong
[55:02] we let her drive
[55:04] before the wind we tells us the crew had
[55:06] enlisted help from the passengers
[55:07] including Luke Paul aristarchus
[55:12] and running under again on the leeward
[55:14] side away from the island between a
[55:17] certain small island between them and
[55:18] the source of the wind the island called
[55:20] clauda
[55:22] we again the passengers apparently were
[55:24] again called upon to help had much work
[55:27] to come by the boat
[55:30] come by the boat
[55:33] what it's talking about here is we
[55:36] hardly manage with strenuous effort to
[55:38] get control of and make secure the
[55:39] ship's lifeboat so they had a small boat
[55:42] big enough for the crew not big enough
[55:44] for 276 people they fast forward to the
[55:48] Titanic and you get an idea what's going
[55:49] on
[55:51] which when they the crew had taken up
[55:53] had they'd hoisted this Lifeboat aboard
[55:55] they used helps under girding the ship
[55:57] so they got ropes and they wrapped it
[55:59] around the belly of the ship and tied it
[56:02] to help make things tight this is a bad
[56:04] storm there there have temporary slight
[56:08] relief they're still fighting things
[56:10] because they're near that other little
[56:12] Island
[56:17] and the next day the crew lightened the
[56:20] ship
[56:21] in other words they started throwing
[56:23] things overboard
[56:24] the non-essentials judging the cargo
[56:29] the third day
[56:32] oops
[56:35] I'm sorry I got ahead of myself shame on
[56:37] me
[56:38] they take it up they fearing less they
[56:40] should fall
[56:42] into the quicksands at sand bars near
[56:45] the shore of this little island this
[56:47] this ship requires a port you can't just
[56:49] pull it up on the beach so it says that
[56:51] they strike sail they lowered the sale
[56:54] and so we're driven before the wind no
[56:56] ability to steer or otherwise direct the
[56:58] ship so here you can see they're wanting
[57:02] to go from Lucia to Phoenix they wind up
[57:05] south of this island of Cloudera and
[57:06] this big nasty storm is blowing all that
[57:09] wind exactly where they don't want it
[57:12] and we being exceedingly tossed with the
[57:14] Tempest the next day they lightened the
[57:16] ship they started throwing things
[57:18] overboard jettisoning the cargo and the
[57:20] third day we sounds like the passengers
[57:23] are involved again cast out with our own
[57:26] hands
[57:27] the tackling
[57:29] of the ship ropes and pulleys and so
[57:32] forth much of the sailing gear they're
[57:34] very desperate
[57:36] and when neither Sun nor stars and many
[57:40] days appeared
[57:42] and no small Tempest lay on us all hope
[57:47] that we should be saved was then taken
[57:51] away all hope
[57:53] of survival was gone
[57:57] everybody lost hope all
[57:59] hope Paul
[58:03] Luke aristarchus
[58:06] the crew remember his warning back in
[58:08] verse 10 was based on the time of the
[58:10] year he said sirs I perceive this Voyage
[58:12] will be with herd in much damage not
[58:14] only of the lading and the ship but also
[58:17] of Our Lives
[58:19] so Paul fought if you go at this time
[58:22] people are going to die and now they've
[58:25] reached that point where all hope is
[58:28] lost
[58:31] but after long abstinence after they'd
[58:33] gone a long time without eating
[58:36] Paul stood forth in the midst of them
[58:39] and said sirs you should have hearkened
[58:43] unto me and not loose from Creed and
[58:44] have gained this harm and loss
[58:47] we see a little bit of Paul's nature
[58:49] here I told you so
[58:52] and now
[58:54] I exhort I encourage I urge I advise you
[58:58] be of good cheer keep up your courage I
[59:01] have an update for you
[59:03] there shall be no loss of any man's life
[59:06] among you
[59:08] but of the ship we're going to lose the
[59:10] ship we've already lost the cargo we're
[59:12] going to lose the ship but we're all
[59:13] going to be okay No One's Gonna Die
[59:16] before that was Paul speaking about the
[59:19] time of year now he has another reason
[59:22] and he tells us that reason
[59:25] for there stood by me this night
[59:28] the angel of God
[59:30] whose I am
[59:32] and whom I serve
[59:34] saying fear not Paul thou must be
[59:38] brought before Caesar and lo God hath
[59:42] given thee all them
[59:45] a-l-l
[59:47] all them that sail with thee if all hope
[59:51] was lost it's the same all all that sail
[59:54] with thee wherefore serves be of good
[59:58] cheer take heart I believe God it shall
[1:00:01] be even as it was told me
[1:00:04] albeit we must be cast we must be
[1:00:07] wrecked on a certain islands of some
[1:00:10] Island
[1:00:11] but when the 14th night was come
[1:00:15] two weeks
[1:00:19] the 14th night was come we were driven
[1:00:21] up and down in adri that's Adriatic Sea
[1:00:24] that's the water between Italy and
[1:00:26] Greece
[1:00:28] The Tempest apparently was more like a
[1:00:30] cyclone if they were going up and down I
[1:00:32] don't think they mean like this about
[1:00:35] midnight the shipment deemed that they
[1:00:37] drew near to some country some land
[1:00:41] they thought they were approaching land
[1:00:43] probably due to the behavior of the
[1:00:44] waves and the sea is the Tempest as the
[1:00:46] water becomes shallower and the waves
[1:00:48] become more violent
[1:00:51] and sounded
[1:00:54] and found it twenty thousands what does
[1:00:56] sounded mean
[1:00:57] well
[1:00:59] it's not a fish finder like you would
[1:01:01] find in modern
[1:01:03] votes they didn't have such technology
[1:01:05] back in the first century
[1:01:09] what they had
[1:01:14] ah
[1:01:15] and then they had knots
[1:01:18] in the rope and as they let that down
[1:01:20] they'd count the knots and that would
[1:01:22] tell them how how far it had gone down
[1:01:25] and and in this case the 120 fathoms is
[1:01:29] a translation now in modern stuff modern
[1:01:32] day a fathom is six feet but what the
[1:01:35] Greek word really means is the distance
[1:01:37] of outstretched arms well people were a
[1:01:39] little smaller mostly in those days so
[1:01:41] I'm guessing maybe it's closer to five
[1:01:43] feet instead of six feet but there were
[1:01:45] there were they were 120 fathoms so that
[1:01:49] would suggest that they were between 90
[1:01:52] and 120 feet deep
[1:01:55] excuse me
[1:02:02] and when they had gone a little further
[1:02:04] they sounded again I I don't need to do
[1:02:07] that again right my back my back is
[1:02:09] bothering me a little bit
[1:02:11] and founded 15 fathoms oh it's shallower
[1:02:14] now 75 to 90 feet well the ship has a
[1:02:17] deep draft right draft means how deep it
[1:02:20] goes into the water that's why they
[1:02:22] threw all that stuff out to make it
[1:02:24] float higher and
[1:02:25] and on on the water so then fearing
[1:02:28] unless we should have fallen upon rocks
[1:02:30] it's midnight they don't have a big
[1:02:33] bright light that they can turn on and
[1:02:34] see what's going on out there they just
[1:02:37] know that they're approaching some land
[1:02:38] they have no idea where they are they've
[1:02:40] been blown about in a storm for two
[1:02:42] weeks they don't have compasses they
[1:02:43] don't have they haven't been able to see
[1:02:45] the stars even to figure things out
[1:02:48] so they cast four anchors out of the
[1:02:50] stern
[1:02:51] and wished for the day
[1:02:54] certainly they were wishing for the day
[1:02:56] and just gives you an idea what anchors
[1:02:58] look like in those days these are Roman
[1:03:00] anchors from about that time some of
[1:03:02] them are made of
[1:03:03] of of iron some of them were made of
[1:03:05] stone actually they're quite heavy
[1:03:11] this happens to be in a Maritime Museum
[1:03:13] on the island of Malta where this
[1:03:15] photograph is from so
[1:03:21] now we read verse 30. there's a little
[1:03:23] bit of Nefarious planning going on here
[1:03:25] as the shipment the crew
[1:03:28] were about to flee out of the ship
[1:03:32] some of these guys were going to abandon
[1:03:34] ship they wanted to escape when they let
[1:03:36] down the boat in other words they'd
[1:03:37] lowered the Lifeboat into the Sea Under
[1:03:40] color as though in other words
[1:03:42] pretending like this was really
[1:03:46] attending that they were going to drop
[1:03:49] anchors off the front
[1:03:50] that they would have cast out anchors
[1:03:52] out of the four ships so these guys are
[1:03:54] preparing to abandon ship they knew
[1:03:56] that's where wasn't what they were
[1:03:58] supposed to do but they thought they had
[1:03:59] a better chance on the Lifeboat and who
[1:04:01] better to be in the Lifeboat than those
[1:04:03] guys so that's what they were going to
[1:04:05] do Paul saw what was going on
[1:04:07] and he said to juliusa Century into the
[1:04:10] soldiers except these abide in the ship
[1:04:14] you can't be saved if these guys Escape
[1:04:17] you're dead that's what he's saying well
[1:04:19] why would he say something like that
[1:04:22] like that why would he say something
[1:04:23] like that the analogy that I draw
[1:04:26] is brother Brandon would have a vision
[1:04:28] of something and he'd wait
[1:04:31] until everything lined up with what he'd
[1:04:33] seen in the vision and then he'd act I I
[1:04:35] think of the story of uh of um
[1:04:38] Ed biscal with a red check green
[1:04:40] checkered shirt and brother random is
[1:04:43] with Bud Southwick and and they're going
[1:04:45] back to some caribou and all of a sudden
[1:04:48] it's big silver trip Grizzly Rises up
[1:04:50] and brother random
[1:04:53] one shot and Bud's telling them as a
[1:04:57] tough guy you'd better take a few more
[1:04:59] shots and that said no the green
[1:05:01] checkered shirt the vision it took one
[1:05:03] shot
[1:05:04] you had it's still coming brother it's
[1:05:07] still finally fell with their feet dead
[1:05:10] so Paul is saying the vision that I had
[1:05:13] with the angel told me is we'll all be
[1:05:15] saved if these guys slip out
[1:05:17] it's broken and if that happens who
[1:05:20] knows what's going to happen because
[1:05:21] we're in a very dangerous situation
[1:05:31] so we read then the soldiers that the
[1:05:34] Centurion commanded
[1:05:36] the soldiers overcame the sailors and
[1:05:38] caught off the ropes of the boat it was
[1:05:40] being lowered and let the boat fall off
[1:05:42] into the sea and Drift Away
[1:05:45] oh
[1:05:46] and while the day was coming on
[1:05:49] Before Sunrise Paul besought them all to
[1:05:52] take meat that's that's grain that's
[1:05:54] food
[1:05:56] saying this day is the 14th day that you
[1:06:00] have carried that you've been in
[1:06:02] suspense constantly watching always on
[1:06:04] the alert and continued fasting haven't
[1:06:08] taken having eaten nothing
[1:06:10] wherefore
[1:06:12] I pray you I urge you take some meat eat
[1:06:15] something
[1:06:17] this is for your health to survive for
[1:06:20] there shall not and hair fall from the
[1:06:22] head of any of you
[1:06:25] and when are you thus spoken he took
[1:06:27] bread
[1:06:28] and gave thanks to God in the presence
[1:06:31] of them all
[1:06:32] and when he had broken it
[1:06:35] he began to eat
[1:06:39] then they were all of good cheer they
[1:06:41] were encouraged their courage was
[1:06:43] restored they also took some food
[1:06:46] began to eat
[1:06:48] and we were in all the ship
[1:06:51] 200 threescore and 16 Souls
[1:06:56] 276 people
[1:06:59] and when they had eaten enough
[1:07:02] they lightened the ship and cast out the
[1:07:03] wheat the remaining grain into the sea
[1:07:06] again it's to minimize the draft they
[1:07:08] want to get this thing as light as they
[1:07:09] can because
[1:07:11] there's probably no Port where they're
[1:07:12] headed they don't know where they are
[1:07:14] and if they've got to beach the boat
[1:07:16] they don't want it to be
[1:07:19] deep in the water they want it to be as
[1:07:21] high and the water as light as they can
[1:07:22] make it
[1:07:25] so they lightened the Ship cast
[1:07:28] everything you see and when it was day
[1:07:30] they knew not the land they didn't
[1:07:32] recognize the place they had no idea
[1:07:34] where they were
[1:07:35] the batteries were dead in their Garmin
[1:07:37] GPS they they just that didn't have any
[1:07:39] Maps they couldn't figure it out
[1:07:41] didn't even have compass in those days
[1:07:43] but they discovered they saw a certain
[1:07:46] Creek with the shore a small Bay with a
[1:07:50] beach into the which they were minded if
[1:07:52] possible to thrust in the ship they were
[1:07:54] going to run Underground on that beach
[1:07:56] that looked like the safest place
[1:07:59] to to put the ship
[1:08:03] and what they had taken up the anchors
[1:08:06] now that that sounds strange this is
[1:08:10] King James Jacobian
[1:08:13] English okay
[1:08:16] other
[1:08:17] translations say when they'd severed the
[1:08:19] ropes and let the anchors in to see but
[1:08:20] here it says they taken up the anchors
[1:08:22] and it's of the
[1:08:24] 20 or 30 translations I looked at it's
[1:08:26] only the King James that says taken up
[1:08:30] the Greek is to remove all around
[1:08:33] so they had removed the anchors
[1:08:37] they were trying to make the ship as
[1:08:38] light as possible dragging four heavy
[1:08:41] anchors back into the boat after you
[1:08:42] threw out your food I think I'd rather
[1:08:44] eat than carry around some anchors so it
[1:08:46] just makes sense if they they cut those
[1:08:48] things loose anyway they committed
[1:08:50] themselves Under the Sea they loosed the
[1:08:52] rubber bands not rubber bands Rudder
[1:08:54] they they had the Rudders tied to try
[1:08:56] and keep things steady so now they
[1:08:58] loosen that so they could attempt to
[1:08:59] steer the ship
[1:09:01] they loose the rudder bands and they
[1:09:03] hoisted up the Mainsail to the wind
[1:09:06] and made toward the shore
[1:09:10] so this is a route that they've taken
[1:09:12] approximately from lycea they've been
[1:09:15] blown around by this big wind and
[1:09:17] eventually they've arrived at this
[1:09:19] island they didn't know that it was
[1:09:20] Malta
[1:09:21] it's a straight line distance of 600
[1:09:23] miles
[1:09:24] they've been blowing around on a stone
[1:09:26] for two weeks
[1:09:29] and falling into a place where two Seas
[1:09:32] two currents met they ran the ship
[1:09:34] aground
[1:09:36] and the four part the front of the ship
[1:09:37] stuck fast and remained unmovable that
[1:09:40] jammed into that Beach
[1:09:43] but the Hydra part was broken with the
[1:09:45] violence of the Waves this isn't good
[1:09:46] sailing weather this is still a storm
[1:09:48] and it's strong enough that it's ripping
[1:09:51] the ship apart
[1:09:54] remained unmovable the Hydra part was
[1:09:56] broken with the violence of the waves
[1:10:00] so this is a satellite view and then a
[1:10:02] another view you can see a little uh
[1:10:05] let's see if
[1:10:06] there you go there's a little Monument
[1:10:08] to Paul and this is called Saint Paul's
[1:10:12] Bay on Malta where they believe that
[1:10:15] this activity took place this would be
[1:10:18] somewhere near here is the beach where
[1:10:19] they ran aground
[1:10:23] so now the ship is stuck it's falling
[1:10:26] apart
[1:10:27] and uh
[1:10:28] we've got a problem
[1:10:30] the soldiers Council
[1:10:32] these guys were talking among themselves
[1:10:35] they said we got to kill the prisoners
[1:10:36] can't let anybody swim out or an escape
[1:10:39] the soldiers were accountable to bring
[1:10:41] the prisoners to trial better that they
[1:10:43] should die
[1:10:45] there are consequences if they escape
[1:10:46] yeah the prisoners we had to kill them
[1:10:49] because they were going to escape oh
[1:10:50] well we'll cut your pay in half the
[1:10:52] prisoners escaped uh you're not going to
[1:10:55] like what happens next remember the
[1:10:57] Philippian Jailer he was going to commit
[1:10:59] suicide when he thought the prisoners
[1:11:01] might have escaped after the earthquake
[1:11:03] so apparently the punishment to a guard
[1:11:04] who fails to guard is
[1:11:06] not pleasant
[1:11:09] but the Centurion the spell to Julius
[1:11:11] being in charge and wanting to save Paul
[1:11:14] willing to save Paul he kept them from
[1:11:16] their purpose commanded that they which
[1:11:18] could swim should cast himself first
[1:11:20] into the sea and get to land now there
[1:11:22] could be something at work here remember
[1:11:24] that Paul said if those guys go in the
[1:11:27] Lifeboat people are going to die so the
[1:11:29] soldiers cut the Lifeboat loose Julius
[1:11:31] is thinking of Paul but he could also be
[1:11:34] thinking of himself and because now if
[1:11:37] they start killing prisoners well that
[1:11:38] again breaks the vision if you will and
[1:11:41] who knows what's going to happen the
[1:11:42] ship is being torn apart Still In This
[1:11:44] Storm
[1:11:48] Commander they wish could swim should
[1:11:50] cast themselves first into the sea to
[1:11:52] get to land and the rest some on boards
[1:11:55] some unbroken pieces of the ship and so
[1:11:58] it came to pass they all escaped safe to
[1:12:00] land just as followed prophesied after
[1:12:02] the angel visitation and once safely
[1:12:05] unsure we found out that we're now in
[1:12:07] chapter 28.
[1:12:11] did that again sorry Daniel I did that
[1:12:13] again brother Daniel will tell you about
[1:12:15] chapter 28 Sunday night I believe
[1:12:19] the final the final chapter of Acts but
[1:12:24] there's a couple things I'd like to
[1:12:26] share with you about this it's not just
[1:12:27] a swashbuckling Adventure
[1:12:30] we often think
[1:12:32] maybe usually think that acts as a story
[1:12:35] primarily of Peter and then of Paul and
[1:12:40] it is that certainly but there's more
[1:12:44] there's another layer that we
[1:12:45] simultaneously acknowledge
[1:12:48] an overlook
[1:12:50] I'm speaking to myself that's what I do
[1:12:52] recall in Acts 26 Paul was presenting
[1:12:56] his testimony of his life and conversion
[1:12:58] to accepting Jesus Christ as God in
[1:13:01] flesh
[1:13:02] acts 27 is part of Luke's testimony
[1:13:08] it isn't how we came to Faith in Jesus
[1:13:10] Christ but his testimony showing God's
[1:13:12] faithfulness toward his children
[1:13:14] it's the first person narrative
[1:13:17] whenever he refers to someone else are
[1:13:19] they it's often from the perspective of
[1:13:22] an observer who is present
[1:13:24] an eyewitness account
[1:13:27] these are personal experiences Luke is
[1:13:29] not presenting Doctrine he's not trying
[1:13:32] to convince us the meaning of some
[1:13:33] portion of scripture he's not trying to
[1:13:35] persuade us to his point of view
[1:13:38] he's simply stating things as he saw and
[1:13:42] experience them
[1:13:44] now unlike his gospel account in much of
[1:13:47] the acts Luke's was there and not just
[1:13:51] there observing and recording but there
[1:13:53] is an active participant
[1:13:56] so much of Acts Luke is sharing his
[1:13:59] experiences is what we call testifying
[1:14:01] that's what happens Sunday night
[1:14:03] certainly Luke has bias
[1:14:05] as do I as do you I remember a fellow
[1:14:09] that I worked for was uh pretty much an
[1:14:12] atheist and we disagreed about some
[1:14:15] things and finally I I said to him I
[1:14:17] said Wayne I respect what you're saying
[1:14:20] but as a person of faith I choose to see
[1:14:23] it this way
[1:14:24] and so
[1:14:26] he respected that there wasn't any
[1:14:28] fights or arguments after that and when
[1:14:31] things would come up from time to time
[1:14:32] I'd say as a person of faith I see it
[1:14:34] this way
[1:14:36] so there's biases that we have here some
[1:14:39] parts of Luke's testimony are exciting
[1:14:41] catching our attention action passion
[1:14:44] danger Deliverance
[1:14:46] some parts seem boring like Paul was in
[1:14:49] prison for two years the blank space we
[1:14:51] spoke about two weeks ago but all this
[1:14:54] is essential parts of this brief time
[1:14:57] that we experience life on Earth
[1:15:00] throughout Acts
[1:15:02] we have seen how Luke was often with
[1:15:04] Paul he stayed with Paul from the latter
[1:15:06] part of the third missionary journey
[1:15:08] Acts 20 verse 6 tells us Luke was with
[1:15:10] him at Philippi they were celebrating
[1:15:13] Passover there he may have been with him
[1:15:15] weeks or months earlier we don't know he
[1:15:18] stayed with them until Paul's execution
[1:15:20] in Rome
[1:15:21] that's a period of at least five years a
[1:15:25] period of hardship
[1:15:26] Danger
[1:15:27] while Paul languished for two years in
[1:15:29] prison in caesarea Luke was there while
[1:15:33] Paul is a prisoner being transported to
[1:15:34] Rome Luke was there when Paul was
[1:15:37] imprisoned his Rome possibly as long as
[1:15:40] four years
[1:15:41] Luke was there at the very last when
[1:15:44] Paul Panda's final epistle only Luke was
[1:15:48] there
[1:15:51] brother Branham said in present stage of
[1:15:54] my Ministry you talked a little bit
[1:15:56] about this
[1:15:57] I said now we know when they seen this
[1:15:59] doctor following him or with him and
[1:16:02] Paul took Luke who said he said here
[1:16:04] Luke's the only one hadn't forsaken
[1:16:06] looks good to him but Luke is prospers
[1:16:08] to him he needs him for his ministry
[1:16:10] this doctor following a man around
[1:16:12] wherever he went and preached Divine
[1:16:14] Healing
[1:16:17] here
[1:16:19] brother Branham is telling how faithful
[1:16:21] Luke was
[1:16:22] how others criticized him for dragging a
[1:16:24] doctor around with him while proclaiming
[1:16:26] God is the Healer
[1:16:28] I mentioned last week about the vital
[1:16:33] a couple times ago about the vital role
[1:16:35] of the unnamed nephew
[1:16:37] Paul
[1:16:39] that he was just a young boy and what
[1:16:42] Treasures would have lost if he had not
[1:16:44] stepped up
[1:16:45] at that critical moment
[1:16:48] think about what would be missing in the
[1:16:49] New Testament if Luke had not recorded
[1:16:51] the acts or written his gospel account
[1:16:54] we'd still have three gospels but Luke
[1:16:57] got so much information not included in
[1:16:59] the other three
[1:17:02] remember
[1:17:03] who was Luke's audience for Acts
[1:17:08] Theophilus
[1:17:09] a person who had been taught faith in
[1:17:11] Jesus Christ The Gospel account is based
[1:17:14] on eyewitness accounts which Luke
[1:17:16] investigated
[1:17:18] and Luke one it starts out this is from
[1:17:21] the NIV many have undertaken to drop and
[1:17:23] account of the things that have been
[1:17:24] fulfilled Among Us just as they were
[1:17:27] handed down to us by those who from the
[1:17:28] first were eyewitnesses and not just
[1:17:31] Witnesses but also Servants of the word
[1:17:33] with this in mind since I myself have
[1:17:36] carefully investigated everything from
[1:17:38] the beginning I too decided to write an
[1:17:40] orderly account for you most excellent
[1:17:42] Theophilus why so that you may know the
[1:17:45] certainty of the things you have been
[1:17:48] taught
[1:17:49] Luke wasn't there during that time it
[1:17:52] was an investigation but following this
[1:17:55] axes Luke acts as Luke's own often
[1:17:59] personal eyewitness account of the
[1:18:01] spreading of the Gospel which Theophilus
[1:18:03] had been taught acts opens up again from
[1:18:05] the NIV and my former book Theophilus I
[1:18:09] wrote about all that Jesus began to do
[1:18:11] and to teach until the day he was taken
[1:18:13] up to heaven after giving instructions
[1:18:15] through the Holy Spirit to the apostles
[1:18:17] he had chosen
[1:18:19] and those instructions are in verse 8.
[1:18:22] you will receive power when the Holy
[1:18:24] Spirit comes on you and you will be my
[1:18:27] Witnesses
[1:18:28] in Jerusalem and in all Judea and
[1:18:31] Samaria
[1:18:32] to the ends of the Earth
[1:18:34] and that's Acts
[1:18:36] highlights of the process by which the
[1:18:39] prophecy recorded in Acts 1 8 was
[1:18:42] fulfilled
[1:18:44] acts probably was written early in the
[1:18:46] mid 60s A.D
[1:18:51] before Jerusalem was destroyed in 70 and
[1:18:53] probably before the beginning of the
[1:18:55] Revolt did I say that too fast probably
[1:18:58] before the beginning of the Revolt in 66
[1:19:00] A.D
[1:19:02] jumping forward to our day
[1:19:05] I'm sure many of you remember our
[1:19:07] brother Al Peterson
[1:19:09] if you ever had a conversation with him
[1:19:12] that exceeded three minutes and I
[1:19:14] maintain it was impossible to have a
[1:19:16] conversation with other Isle of less
[1:19:17] than three minutes
[1:19:19] he would have told you about brother
[1:19:21] branham's discernment regarding his wife
[1:19:23] sister Minnie being in the prayer line
[1:19:25] recorded in the message Dr Moses
[1:19:27] preached in Chicago on January 14
[1:19:31] 1955.
[1:19:34] the day before
[1:19:36] January 13th brother Brandon preached a
[1:19:40] message titled the fundamental
[1:19:41] foundation for faith
[1:19:44] I want to play you a short excerpt at
[1:19:46] the very end of that recording just
[1:19:49] under two minutes and then I have some
[1:19:51] comments that tie back to the book of
[1:19:53] Acts if you could play that brother
[1:20:08] our heavenly father speaking something
[1:20:17] [Music]
[1:20:18] keeps coming before the exception of our
[1:20:21] city and the city is in a valley
[1:20:27] [Music]
[1:20:39] it moves now coming to the corner
[1:20:45] it's a woman
[1:20:47] and she's taken by loved ones to uh it's
[1:20:51] a clinical male brother
[1:20:53] planning and the woman comes from
[1:20:56] Michigan
[1:20:57] they take her in for an examination but
[1:21:00] they can't find out what's the matter
[1:21:01] with her it's a brain disease
[1:21:07] someone in here sitting in here
[1:21:09] somewhere
[1:21:10] it's a woman that's very heavy and see
[1:21:14] oh
[1:21:16] we're bound
[1:21:18] God bless you ladies laying on the bed
[1:21:21] with you
[1:21:26] thank you
[1:21:28] [Applause]
[1:21:37] [Music]
[1:21:51] I could have my
[1:21:53] slides back
[1:21:56] there we are thank you
[1:22:00] the woman brother Branham mentions
[1:22:03] after he was miraculous healing you hear
[1:22:05] the entire audience erupt she literally
[1:22:08] flies off the stretcher
[1:22:11] is Sister Grace evilly
[1:22:14] her testimony of this healing in the
[1:22:16] background of it is contained in the
[1:22:17] final two pages of the booklet the 11th
[1:22:20] Commandment that brother Brandon's
[1:22:22] campaign had printed and distributed for
[1:22:24] many years at the end of the testimony
[1:22:26] the last item in the booklet is her name
[1:22:29] Mrs Wesley evilly and her address in
[1:22:33] Saint Ignace Michigan
[1:22:35] that was 1953 January in early 1973
[1:22:40] January exactly 20 years after her
[1:22:44] healing she came to Tucson
[1:22:46] she stayed in our home at the time I was
[1:22:48] in the Army undergoing basic combat
[1:22:50] training but sister Grace Everly and
[1:22:52] Heather spent several days together
[1:22:55] here in Tucson
[1:22:56] sister Ely told Heather that she never
[1:22:59] sold the house and moved even after her
[1:23:01] husband died
[1:23:03] why
[1:23:05] because her address was in the book
[1:23:09] she wanted to be able to confirm her
[1:23:11] testimony to anyone
[1:23:14] who asked
[1:23:16] the musicians would please come my
[1:23:18] tie-in with this testimony to acts is
[1:23:21] simply this I I think I'm not a
[1:23:23] revelation it's not anything other than
[1:23:25] just thinking about this Luke gave some
[1:23:27] names and locations of people that he
[1:23:29] knew were still alive when he sent this
[1:23:32] manuscript to Theophilus
[1:23:34] Theophilus would then know where to find
[1:23:36] Rhoda the house slave Simon the Tanner
[1:23:40] Dorcas the seamstress aristarchus the
[1:23:44] helper Lydia the merchant if he wanted
[1:23:47] to confirm the testimonies contained in
[1:23:51] the book of Acts I think that's why some
[1:23:53] of these people that are only ever
[1:23:55] mentioned once in the Bible in Acts why
[1:23:57] their name is there why their location
[1:23:59] is there remember
[1:24:02] the context
[1:24:03] Luke was writing to Theophilus he wasn't
[1:24:06] panning a portion of the Bible for
[1:24:08] future Generations the Lord's return was
[1:24:11] expected any moment
[1:24:13] my sisters my brothers
[1:24:16] we each have a role to play
[1:24:19] a task to perform
[1:24:22] a life to live
[1:24:24] a testimony to give
[1:24:26] it's easy to focus on Peter and Paul and
[1:24:29] we should not forget them but we must
[1:24:31] never forget the vital roles played by
[1:24:34] others
[1:24:35] kill them Priscilla
[1:24:37] aristarchus Timothy Apollos James
[1:24:40] Stephen Phillip Barnabas Silas and the
[1:24:44] unnamed thousands who accepted the
[1:24:46] gospel message endured persecution and
[1:24:50] carried the message of Grace down to our
[1:24:53] day
[1:24:54] we need to each be diligent
[1:24:56] play our role take our place
[1:25:00] to love
[1:25:01] and serve
[1:25:02] one another
[1:25:04] thinking about Sunday not in the
[1:25:06] simulator
[1:25:07] but in the jet
[1:25:09] we need as we turn the service over to
[1:25:11] our pastor

[1:27:41] 's brother Lyle was closing
[1:27:45] he's talking about this man Luke
[1:27:48] and all the research
[1:27:50] that he did
[1:27:51] and studying this man Jesus
[1:27:55] in his life
[1:27:57] we know that is as the Book of Luke
[1:27:59] and all that he had worked and all the
[1:28:03] studying that he did to report back to
[1:28:05] this man Theophilus
[1:28:08] and I wonder when
[1:28:11] he met the Apostle Paul
[1:28:14] I wonder what he thought
[1:28:16] when he saw Paul and he had studied all
[1:28:19] of this about Jesus
[1:28:21] and when he saw that man
[1:28:25] I wonder if he thought
[1:28:28] [Music]
[1:28:29] that man that I have learned so much
[1:28:32] about that I have been baptized in his
[1:28:35] name that that I have seen that he is
[1:28:39] the Messiah and all that he studied I
[1:28:41] wonder if he thought and maybe maybe
[1:28:44] even said out loud The Same Spirit that
[1:28:48] was in that man rests in this Apostle
[1:28:50] Paul
[1:28:53] I I know that
[1:28:56] around 1950
[1:28:59] a little maybe in the early 50s
[1:29:04] my grandfather
[1:29:06] was listening to the radio down in south
[1:29:09] Georgia
[1:29:11] and he heard this man preaching
[1:29:18] he had been reading his Bible he had
[1:29:21] he had been following this new minister
[1:29:25] named Oral Roberts you know him
[1:29:30] and when he heard this man speak
[1:29:33] [Music]
[1:29:34] it may have been the same as when Luke
[1:29:37] heard this man Paul speak
[1:29:41] he heard it on the radio
[1:29:45] he told my grandmother he told his wife
[1:29:47] he said get the kids ready we're going
[1:29:49] to go hear this man
[1:29:52] he got in the car the next day and they
[1:29:54] drove
[1:29:56] I don't know six hours or so
[1:29:58] to Cleveland Tennessee
[1:30:01] and they saw that servant
[1:30:04] stand in front of the people
[1:30:08] preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ just
[1:30:11] as the Apostle Paul did
[1:30:15] and then
[1:30:17] he did the same works
[1:30:20] that Jesus did just as the Apostle Paul
[1:30:23] did
[1:30:25] and like Luke
[1:30:27] he saw something real in that man and he
[1:30:30] started following this man
[1:30:32] all around the country
[1:30:35] it may not have been an old ship
[1:30:38] across the Mediterranean
[1:30:41] but it was a station wagon
[1:30:44] following this man named William Branham
[1:30:47] all around the country and seeing the
[1:30:51] same thing that Luke saw when he saw
[1:30:54] Paul preach the same gospel
[1:30:58] so much so that even brother Branham
[1:31:00] himself when he went beyond the curtain
[1:31:02] of time he said I preached the same
[1:31:05] thing as Paul preached
[1:31:07] and he sought my grandpa saw it both of
[1:31:12] my grandpa's side
[1:31:13] it was the real thing
[1:31:17] and his brother Lyle was
[1:31:19] closing I just thought oh God the same
[1:31:24] thing happened in our day
[1:31:27] he talks about
[1:31:29] brother Peterson brother Peterson saw it
[1:31:32] he talked about the sister Grace and
[1:31:35] Michigan she saw it
[1:31:38] people around the world saw it the same
[1:31:43] spirit
[1:31:45] that was on these Apostles was
[1:31:47] manifested again
[1:31:49] in this man named William Branham and
[1:31:52] you can see why people would travel the
[1:31:54] world
[1:31:55] to come see him
[1:31:57] the same reason that this man Luke saw
[1:32:00] the truth in that man Paul
[1:32:04] and he just wanted to be a part and
[1:32:05] thank God that he did
[1:32:08] now
[1:32:10] instead of the Book of Luke
[1:32:13] in the book of Acts
[1:32:15] we've got tape recordings
[1:32:17] and thank God that we have those tape
[1:32:19] recordings that we can listen with our
[1:32:21] own ears
[1:32:23] a prophet a true Prophet a true
[1:32:25] Messenger from God
[1:32:28] that believed in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:32:30] as Paul did that spread that gospel and
[1:32:34] that did the same works that Christ did
[1:32:36] just as the Apostle Paul did
[1:32:38] not feel good
[1:32:40] doesn't feel good that that we can tie
[1:32:42] in this book of Acts all the way to this
[1:32:45] day and let me tell you something
[1:32:47] there's more coming
[1:32:49] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:32:52] and forever and there's more coming
[1:32:55] it'll be coming all the way until he
[1:32:58] comes down and we go up and we meet him
[1:33:01] in the air
[1:33:02] there's more coming friends let's all
[1:33:04] stand
[1:33:07] one more time brother Jonathan Lord
[1:33:09] prepare me Hello Brother David coming
[1:33:12] close
[1:33:16] [Music]
[1:33:17] [Laughter]
[1:33:19] [Music]
[1:33:32] with Thanksgiving
[1:33:36] sanctuary
[1:33:38] [Music]
[1:33:55] [Music]
[1:33:57] let's pray Lord Jesus we're honored to
[1:34:01] be able to gather here together like
[1:34:03] this in this building Lord Jesus
[1:34:06] what a thing to be part of the same
[1:34:08] story we're
[1:34:10] like these gentlemen have said we're all
[1:34:13] we're doing is
[1:34:15] we've written chapters through the last
[1:34:17] couple of thousand years and we're
[1:34:19] seeing the first few chapters we've
[1:34:22] we've studied it Lord but what we're
[1:34:24] living today is just a continuation of
[1:34:27] the same story Lord and and I it's a
[1:34:30] privilege to be a part of it I uh so
[1:34:34] many times Our Testimony it fails before
[1:34:38] people out in the world Lord Jesus
[1:34:41] forgive us of that
[1:34:43] give us the opportunity Lord to to live
[1:34:46] a life in front of those around us that
[1:34:49] they would see something real when when
[1:34:53] Luke looked upon Paul
[1:34:55] and thought
[1:34:57] that's the same spirit that I've read
[1:35:00] about that I saw when people looked on
[1:35:03] brother Branham and thought that must be
[1:35:06] the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ
[1:35:11] may they look on our lives and think
[1:35:14] that Jesus is Alive because I see it in
[1:35:18] that man or that woman there and that's
[1:35:20] proof to me

[1:35:40] we're thankful that you reached down and
[1:35:43] help us the 10 percent
[1:35:45] sometimes we only have what it takes to
[1:35:48] maybe make a 30 percent of the way
[1:35:51] we're thankful Lord that you your grace
[1:35:54] pours out just a little bit more and you
[1:35:57] take a seventy percent
[1:35:59] Lord sometimes we can only give one
[1:36:01] percent
[1:36:03] we're so thankful that you're more than
[1:36:07] able to take us the rest of the way Lord
[1:36:10] we it's it's not easy
[1:36:14] yielding ourselves to you that it's it's
[1:36:18] a difficult thing that's why so many
[1:36:21] have fallen by the wayside that's that's
