thank you for all the music god bless you amen certainly good to be here in the house of the lord amen on a wednesday night amen and just looking to what the lord has for us amen knowing that he always says something good something that we need amen we'd like to just look here tonight at matthew chapter 16. i'm just going to read one verse and verse 18. i'd like to take some time here tonight if i could just for a little while and maybe uh tonight would be uh wednesday night we would have it maybe maybe just in a direction more of laying a foundation for something that we want to get to and often times you you have to do that you can't say you can't complete or fully express a subject in one service sometimes not in two sometimes not in ten but uh you gotta start somewhere and so i just like to as we did sunday uh this past weekend and we'll continue next sunday i'd like to go a little different direction tonight amen that the lord will be our help next wednesday we'll continue in the same exact direction so laying the groundwork sometimes can be can be teachy can take some teaching some reading amen but i believe that it's important amen brother adam said that the teaching of the word of god is what establishes the church amen and it's not man's opinions or his theories or his idea can't be established on his personality a man or his charisma it's got to be established on the word it's the only way to last amen and i'm glad we have his word how many are glad that you have his word tonight amen i certainly am we'd like to just read one verse in matthew chapter 16 and we'll be we'll just read verse 18. i'd like to preach to you on the acts experience the acts experience matthew 16 verse 18 and i say unto thee thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church ecclesia that word ecclesia means out called or the called out and so jesus says i'm going to have a church i'm going to build a church and and peter says jesus says who do men say that i am thou art christ the son of the living god and i say unto thee read it again verse 18 that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hades the gates of hell that encompasses everything every plan every scheme everything that satan had in mind jesus says that no matter from the ages past ages present or ages to come the gates of hell will not prevail that means today that doesn't mean satan won't fight that just means in the end we win i'm glad we believe that tonight i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it heavenly father we're so grateful to be called your children lord it's only by your sovereign grace lord that you chose us you elected us father and we just raise our hands tonight lord and surrender we just want to say thank you lord for that grace tonight may you bless us now father bless each and every single individual lord those that are here lord those that are listening by stream or archive we pray your word would reach them wherever that they are at tonight now lord be my help i pray here tonight and this pulpit lord i pray that you would be the teacher father may you establish your children we ask in jesus name amen you can be seated i want to read that verse one more time just verse 18 and i say unto thee thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it so jesus didn't just come to save people or individuals we know that within the plan of god he would bring salvation to the entire world to whomsoever will but beyond that this was what jesus said he was coming to build a church and of course we know that a church is not a building you know we get so used to saying that well what church do you go to well i go to this church and we label churches by buildings but you may point to a building and say that's my church or that's the church that i go to but that's not the church that's just a building and the church can be gathered inside it can be gathered outside in the open air it could be gathered uh anywhere it doesn't matter if you don't don't have a roof uh over your church the church is not the building uh the church is the people and wherever the people the bible says where the spirit of the lord is is liberty wherever two or three are gathered in my name there i'll be in their midst uh you believe that here tonight and so whether that those people meet in a building or whether they meet outside in the open air it's the church and jesus says i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it now we could say so much upon the subject and run out of time in a hurry and that's okay if we do here tonight i know we won't cover all of this but i just want to use these wednesdays that we have as a time we could maybe slow the pace down just a little bit and uh and just be able to to teach on god's word i believe it's that what we have uh in this age is rich amen do you believe that it's rich it's endless you know what we could we're never gonna run out of things to preach where are you gonna run out of something to preach no not if i'm preaching if i'm preaching my ideas oh yeah we'll run out quick but if we're preaching the word it's endless as we said last sunday in the ceaseless ages to come brother brandon said even in the millennium jesus will still be he will still be making himself known what does that mean well we'll leave that up for the lord to to reveal to us brother branham says this out of why are we not why are we not a denomination a powerful message that i believe uh has a great amount of significance to the believer and if you haven't heard it in a while i challenge you to go back and listen to it again he says but did you ever notice that every time a church ever fails and as soon as they denominate they start failing right then even and he says and whenever they fell god never raises that church again he says in a paragraph later god deals with individuals not with denominations god in no age ever dealt with a denomination he's always dealt with an individual in the old testament he dealt with individuals in the new testament he dealt with individuals god always deals with individual hearts now we'd love because their safety in numbers we'd love to believe that we're safe collectively but we're not we're not safe because of a church that we go to or label that we have or a last name that we have but christ deals with individuals that's why i said to peter who do you say that i am now that is probably one of the most important questions that can be asked today who do you say that i am not who does man say that i am not the suda that's what jesus asked him at first some say thou art elijah some say isaiah you know one of the prophets but jesus says now peter i've got a question for you but who do you say that i am because it doesn't matter what the rest of the world says or what they're what they what the schools of theology say peter all that matters is that you understand who do you say that i am peter what is your confession what is your testimony what what what have you seen what it what what is your understanding peter says i say that thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus says flesh and blood didn't reveal this to you in other words you didn't learn this it's not something that could be taught but it's something that my father has revealed to you personally and upon this rock of personal revelation and you notice right when jesus says this he says and i say thou art peter in other words it's one thing to recognize who jesus is peter but when you recognize who i am you'll then recognize who you are hallelujah because in the identity of christ the groom is the identity of the bride and he says and i say thou art peter and he says and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it so he was coming to establish something he was coming to start if we could say it that way he was coming to start something brother branham says here and he speaks about the the the catholic church and i said in the infallibility of the catholic church why has it changed so much see he said well you you he said see we you all believe the bible we believe the church he's speaking of a a a man who he spoke to a a catholic man and he says the catholic man says we don't care what the bible says it's what the church says that's exactly right you ever come to a showdown to it try it once see they don't care what the bible says that has nothing to do with it they care what the church says but we don't care brother branham says what the church says we believe what god says for the bible it's written let every man's word be a lie and mine be the truth that's why we're not a denomination so let me say it this way say brother matt what is the church as we said that word that jesus uses there is ecclesia which it means uh out called or we would turn that around and say the called out this was the church that was separate this this was the church that was separated unto the lord for himself let me say it to you as i i'll give some just rudimentary very simple principles about the church that jesus is talking to you can just mute that here for a moment about what brother branham is talking about let me say this the church is not a business and so many churches are ran like a business so many american churches are established today and have thousands of members because they've taken an american business model of how to be successful in business but let me say this god's church is not a business now obviously we have to operate under certain legalities and the church should operate its finances like a business and and to be a good steward over what god has given them but it but it ought not to be ran like a business it's not an organization come on i need your help tonight it's not an organization we're not a denomination we're not an organization we are the church of jesus christ which is the mystical body of christ on an individual basis let me say it to you this way the church is not an organization it's an organism it's a living organism it's not an organization it's a living body the church is not a club oh let me say it let me back up here just for a moment the message of the hour is not an organization amen wow should have gotten a hearty wholesome amen on that the message of the hour is not an organization it's not a denomination that doesn't mean men will try to denominate and organize but brother adam said anytime they did god left that system because as we've said over and over again the message of the hour the word of god is not teachings and doctrines and ink on paper and theories and ideas it's a person and he's the person of the word that's why paul says i fear the lest by any means is the serpent beguiled eve through his subtility so you also so he should also corrupt your minds from the simplicity that's in jesus christ and he said and that they would accept or preach another jesus whom we have not preached or believe in another jesus whom we've not taught and so you see today there's a there's an entire world that is preaching another jesus and and they they they define him in many different ways but it doesn't matter how the world defines jesus today you say well i just believe in jesus well which which version of jesus because there's a hundred of them million of them out there today which version of jesus do you believe in you wanna you wanna you wanna believe in the version of jesus that splits him into two or splits him into three which jesus paul says lest that the serpent who begot eve should also should all should also pollute your minds that you would accept a jesus whom we've not preached who is jesus today is he a story of 2 000 years ago no he's his word he says word expressed today that's why you say what is the message of the hour it's jesus it's the anointed word that's what we're feeding upon not a bot not a man not a not a not a not an organization but an organism a living body the church is not a club church is not a club it's not a religious club that you can join or you can get disbanded from or kicked out from you know so many churches are like joining the club with the club you know you join that club you you pay your yearly dues except for in church you just pay your weekly dues you know you pay your yearly dues you pay for your subscription you know you you attend the business meetings you have a roll call and and you keep all of the rules you vote at the business meeting but that's not a church church is not a club the church also isn't the clergy i'm going to enjoy the sermon even if you don't the church is not a clergy it's not the clergy and so many people think the church today is just the preachers or the pastors or the evangelists so come on friends it's amazing how many people view the church as the clergy well you know the church ought to do something about that you know what they're really saying the preachers ought to do something about that the preachers ought to do something thank god for preachers we ought to thank god for the for the ministry that'll preach the truth can you say amen thank god for pastors that'll teach the truth and rightly divide the word of god in a dark confusing age where the lines are so uh blurred everywhere that we look but there's a ministry that takes a stand upon the word of god let me say this god is not looking for ministry or just preachers he's looking for the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god who recognize their position it's time let me say it to you it's time for believers to come to their position to to to believe like you've never believed before to come under the anointing of a believer stop waiting for something to happen in the future oh well when this brother when this thing happens over here or what'll happen at this church or that church let me just say this to you my brother my sister god is moving whether i feel him or not god is moving whether you feel him or not god is on the move and whether i miss it or i make it god is still going to move and i say tonight lord don't let me miss it don't let me be lethargic in this age let me be in tune and in sync with your spirit because god's moving he's moving in all the earth he's moving in his family not just as preachers amen so what does it mean as we see the world that we're living in the day is it's a it's a day when the when prophecy is being fulfilled now i want you to look at this here in luke 18 verse 31 and you don't have to if you have a bible you can turn it they can put it up on the screen i want you to notice that that that that jesus lived and preached uh constantly he was under an awareness that his life was fulfilling a purpose now we preached to you sunday how that these men of the old testament lived a parabolic life their their life was a type or a shadow a parable you could say in a way that could be told you look at the story all the way from jesus and who was the butler represented who was the baker we don't have time to teach on that tonight but if you look at all of the stories of the bible there was they were a parable they were telling you they were foretelling something there was something they were pointing to there was something that they were expressing even all the way up to the moment that jesus says upon this rock i'll build my church and jesus lived under this fulfillment he was constantly aware that words of prophets had been spoken that the prophets had had had declared and had and had had spoken you'll read one in luke 18 verse 31 he says then he took unto him the twelve and said unto them behold we go up to jerusalem notice this and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the son of man shall be accomplished so notice he was aware of this that it was that it was it was going to hinge upon the words of the prophets and i believe that the word of the prophet is vital in the age that you live in you say well we need less of the prophet let me say it to you the opposite we need more of the prophet's message we need more we need to be more grounded in the word god has sent us than we ever have before and if we're not careful we can be good things can become just so polarizing that we have a reaction against some of the those who have maybe went way too far on one side of the ditch but that doesn't mean we go to the other opposite side the brother branham said the stabilizers are already on the ship keep your eye on jesus we'll crest every wave we'll crest every single one of them it doesn't matter what fanaticism there is on the left it doesn't matter what fanaticism there is on the right keep your eye on jesus uh jesus says even on the road to emmaus now listen how important the words of the prophets were uh he says this here he says in luke 24 verse 25 giving brother jeremy a good work out here we gave him one sunday and uh i think he's getting a good exercise here's his uh his uh his his hands there i'm sure are getting fatigued some of these scriptures but thank you brother uh for your for your diligence there luke 24 25 uh jesus says this year he says then he said unto them oh fools now this is these on the road to emmaus he says all fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken oh fools and slow of heart to believe you're slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken uh paul even says this here in acts 3 24 he says yea and all the prophets from samuel this is acts 3 verse 24 notice what he says about these about paul speaking of prophets he says yea and all of the prophets from samuel and those that follow after as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days you think that god somehow finished up the bible and just said okay it's all over it's all finished now there's been something written about every age and every generation are you here tonight let me just say it to you this way if you would have lived in the days of isaiah and you believed isaiah to be a prophet you would have banked everything upon that man receiving the word of the lord for you and when he said behold a virgin shall conceive his name shall be called emmanuel prince of peace the mighty god my brother my sister if you would have believed isaiah to be an anointed prophet of god you would have sold everything you would have raised your children you would you would have done everything to sell out to the word of god and you would have come under expectation of that man's prophecy but for years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years that prophecy stays unfulfilled and unfulfilled and unfulfilled and unfulfilled and unfulfilled but there came a day when time met prophecy and it didn't matter what scoffers had said it didn't wouldn't matter what the mockers had said didn't matter what the generations past didn't matter what they had turned uh religion into that end of that day all that mattered was that prophecy was about to be fulfilled paul says this says all the prophets from samuel all those follow afters have likewise foretold of these days even john the baptist understood this and he preached the message that the prophets spoke uh he listened to me my brother my sister john didn't come with a new revelation he didn't come with some new inspiration he didn't go to a school and get it and come out of the the bible says but his life was under an anointing from the days he was in his mother's womb he was he was had the holy ghost he said what is that that means he was anointed with a mission to prepare ye the way of the lord john wasn't coming with a new message a new doctrine some new truth he preached exactly what isaiah had already spoken do you get that here tonight where did john john where did you come up with that it's right here except he'd point to his rolled up scroll it's right here uh now in those days listen what matthew 3 verse 1. uh brother jeremy if you want to put that up matthew 3 verse 1 and we'll just read 1 verse 1 and verse 2 and verse 3. now in those days john the baptist came preaching in the wilderness of judea saying repent repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet isaiah amen what was he doing it was already established god said i'm not going to you're not going to have to figure this out john you're not going to have to just come up with this as you go but it's already written john the only difference is is that now it's anointed to be spoken now there's an inspiration behind it and when john said prepare ye the way of the lord behold the lamb it was an anointed vindication of what isaiah already spoke though isaiah had no idea what he was saying brother brandon said when he said it brother brandon said isaiah isaiah would have scratched his head and said now wait a minute what did i just say behold a virgin shall conceive brother man and said isaiah could have scratched his head and said hold on a minute what a virgin shall conceive what was it he was under the inspiration of the holy spirit when david begins to speak and say my bones stare at me says behold how they laugh and they mock me he had he had no idea he was he had no idea was under the inspiration of the messiah he was under the inspiration of the almighty when david says you'll not leave his soul in hell neither allow your holy one to see corruption david pinned that on a piece of paper looked at it and might have thought my that's so profound but what does it mean and you know what happened to that it got rolled up got scrolled up got strolled up somewhere and it sat for years and years and years until when until the son of god was in the belly of the earth and the bible says you'll not leave his soul in hell neither allow your holy one to see corruption and words that had been pinned hundreds of years before suddenly came to life it was the words of the prophets listen to what he says here jesus he said saying repent for the kingdom of heaven for this is the one notice this is what isaiah the prophet said the voice of one crying in the wilderness put up verse three if you could brother jeremy make way make ready what it means there he says prepare ye the way of the lord prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight you see what the church needs today is not new doctrine we don't need new ideas although we love new ideas people love something new they love something shiny they they they love some new revelation or new new kind of thing here listen to my listening my brother we don't we don't need something new we need a revival which is a stirring of what we already have said brother matt does that mean god doesn't keep revealing himself absolutely that's not what i'm saying here today but what i'm saying to you is that god has god has already given us a word when are we going to believe that word when's that word going to become real when's it going to become more of brother branham said when's it going to be say when can we say this is what brother branham said i'm living what the prophet has already spoken you say what who is the message i am the message do you realize today my brother this is exactly what john was saying here we don't need to we don't need something new uh we don't like the world the bible says they'll keep to themselves teachers having itching ears because there's something always in man he always wants something novel something he could bring to himself some kind of new idea or a new way it's just sad that he won't accept god's provided way the way god already provided are you here tonight it's not something new it's not some kind of new idea let me just let me say this and it's going to be i'm not going to be able to qualify it right now so i'll just trust me i'll qualify it later brother branham didn't come the message of the hour never came with the intent or purpose at all to bring something new that wasn't the malachi 4 ministry brother branham says it would be these divinely revealed truths what truths what truths it would be these divinely revealed mystery truths that would literally turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers and it wouldn't be new ideas it would be a restoration of what was lost that's what redemption is all about even you we could we could list scripture after scripture we're going to take just a moment to do that the events you find in the gospels the unfolding events in an order that was spoken so many times you'll read this when you go through the gospels especially and it was so that the words of jeremiah could be fulfilled so that the words of isaiah could be fulfilled so that the words could be fulfilled this is exactly what you read about time and time and time again matthew chapter 8 verse 16 just one scripture matthew chapter 8 and if you have a bible you're welcome to turn there if you can get there quickly when the even was come they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick verse 17. next verse there brother jeremy that it might be fulfilled notice that that it might be fulfilled which was spoken already so here's a modern day event and you say why did it have to happen because words had to be fulfilled that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by isaiah the prophet saying himself uh saying saiyan himself took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses matthew 12 15 uh jesus aware of this withdrew from there many followed him and healed them and he warned them not to make them known this is matthew 12. he says but when jesus knew he threw himself from thence and great multitudes followed him and he killed them all verse 16 and and then charged them that they should not make him known verse 17 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by isaias the prophet you see god doesn't let his prophet's words go to waste god doesn't let his prophet's word just stay idle though though time may delay and delay and delay but yet god has a perfect season and a perfect time for everything and in that moment there will be a believer who believes it there will be a believer who's expecting it there will be a believer who's an anticipation for it hallelujah that it might be fulfilled isaiah you had no idea isaiah what you were seeing in vision what you were seeing of a messiah what you were seeing and and even what isaiah would would speak seeing the messiah seeing the vision seeing the vision what the lord begins to say here i want you to notice this uh let's listen and then we're gonna we're gonna get to our thought here in just a moment and if we run out of time we just will brother jeremy you could put up that powerpoint here for a moment so this is exactly what brother adam says this here about this first church now what do we find uh in acts and if i i don't know if this will work i'll try it if it if it does work wonderful no it doesn't because i can't blink oh i can't it can can you blank that for me just here for a moment it's a tendency to to read i want you to look at this and we're going to just have to just slow down here for just a moment but what do you have when you have this book of acts i want you to turn to acts 1 1 just quickly if you could acts 1 1 and we're just going to read just a just this first verse here or we'll read a few of them the former treaties verse 1 the former treaties have i made o theophilus of all that jesus began both to do and to teach so what was this this was the writer of this book was a man named luke now luke was a gentile he was a greek he never this this man luke is the only gentile writer in the entire bible you'll only find this one gentile writer 40 different authors of the bible 39 were jewish what what does that mean hebrew thinkers but luke so luke gets most of his material from jewish writers but he himself was a gentile not one of the twelve he never knew jesus uh the the bible the historians of biblical historians believe he was converted 20 years after the ascension of jesus but he learns everything through what he reads he learns everything through what now listen to me very closely here because you're going to find out something so amazing about this writer luke was a physician he was a doctor and doctors are very now this was very intentional god chose this man very specifically who's going to write this book of acts the man who we're reading here when he says the former treaties have i made old theophilus that's that's his book the former treaties was his record the former record the record the book of luke this is exactly what he's going to say the former treaties have i made the former record i'm witnessing i'm attesting to it uh he says he says um the former treaties that i've made of all that jesus began both to do and to teach verse two we'll just keep reading here until the day and which he was taken up after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them 40 days and speaking of things pertaining to the kingdom of god and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father now this is important i'm going to take take time to read it because we're going to we're going to refer back to this he says being assembled together with them commanded them they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he you have heard of me for john truly baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence now this is something further something more than what they had already received this was this was something more jesus says in john 7 he says he that believeth in me shall out of his belly flow rivers of living water and then in parentheses there in your scope of your king james bible it says this spoke he of the spirit which had not been given yet because here jesus was still fulfilling his earthly ministry he had it ascended and a spirit hadn't came back but this was the promise of the father he says when they work listen to what he says verse 5 again for john truly baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying lord without this time restore again the kingdom to israel and he said it's not for you to know the times or season which the father has put in his own power but you you shall receive something it's going to be more than my words it's going to be more than my miracles it's going to be more than testimonies you shall receive greek word dunamis brother adam takes that up what is dunamis english words root english word is dynamite but you shall receive dynamite glory after that the holy ghost has come upon you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judea and in samaria even to the uttermost part of the earth and when they had spoken these things while they behold he was taken up and a god received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly towards heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them now listen this was a doctor who wrote this book this was a man who was very careful to details and this is the man who testifies of the virgin birth god uses a doctor to testify to the world of a virgin birth you know how i sat down with mary investigated what happened also notice he used the doctor to describe the miracles of jesus a doctor you think god was an accident no a doctor who is very very specific in detail and so he's going to say the former treaties my book my record he says the former treaties haven't made verse one brother jeremy the the the the former treaties that i have i made a theophilus of all that jesus began to do and to teach so what was this book of acts it was going to be the first church it was going to be the original church it was going to be what jesus spoke of when he said i'll build my church prophetically this was the church he was speaking of brother branham said it was this original first ephesian age or what we call the alpha church age the alpha meaning the beginning jesus says i am the alpha and i'm the omega i am the beginning i am the end i am the first i am the last and he's everything in the middle too but he says there would be something significant about the first there would be something significant about the last because the alpha would mirror the omega the omega would mirror the alpha because what do you have in the alpha you have the seed you have the genesis of the new testament are you with me here you have the alpha church you have the seed church what do you read when you read your bible and you open up the book of acts you're reading the beginning amen you're reading the beginning of the church this is what it meant it was the book of acts church the first church the ephesian church the seed church and god was going to do something listen to what brother branham says here and i'm just going to establish this with some quotes and then we'll pick this up listen what brother branham says brother jeremy you can display that uh this is out of the ephesian church age now he says it says here it is and on can you see that all in the back an unchanging god listen to how he's going to frame this because it's important with unchanging ways what he did at the first now when you read that word genesis seed beginning alpha what he did at the first he will have to keep on doing until it is done for the last the end the omega the the harvest the fruition the final what are we we're the final voice to the final age what did the prophet god preached when he preached the the the restoration of the bride tree church and he said that little church and he gives us the example of the stalk the wheat plant and he says that seed that was at the beginning died what does brother brandon mean when he says that now i'm going to have to slow down here because i don't want to gloss over this and we said we're going to teach and everyone's going ah brother matt you're not doing too much teaching let me slow down can i do that what does brother branham have here he has this picture of this bride tree and he says it's a stalk it's like a wheat stalk and he says in the in the in the in the ground is the seed what was that seed it was the first church it was that ephesian church age that book of acts church what does brother branham mean when he refers to this that first seed that first church now the ephesian church dies we know that it ends in a in a in a very different way than how it starts paul begins to say this that i fear after i'm gone after my departing grievous woods will come in not sparing the flock and that's exactly what happens paul says it comes and says you did run well speaking and it to the galatians he says oh you foolish galatians who has bewitched you and so we know that first age brother adam says ends in death he says ephesus even the city he said it it means drifting dying wondering and he says and it ends with just a squall a little village of believers and brother branham actually stops and says now that first church starts in purity for just a short little while for just a short time it walks in purity forget the the the duration brother branham gives there for just a short duration that walks in purity says but not before long he says that same church becomes the the the tree of the book of revelations of every fallen unclean and hateful bird and jude the very last book before the book of revelation says brothers when i thought it necessary to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful that i exhort you until you earnestly contend for what we all received that's what you read in jude earnestly contend for the faith now what had happened there's such a different temperature from acts 1 1 and jude 1. i thought it need for to write unto you of the common salvation this is a man writing a letter but it was needful that i exhort you and tell you brothers you're going to have to fight you're going to have to contend you're going to have to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints brother branham says what was that one faith that jude was speaking of peter's message repent be baptized every one of you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen brother adam says it was one message one time and he says in it it never needed to be changed it was a pattern so what was god going to do in the first age the ephesian age he was going to start a pattern and brother branham stops now i've said it a lot but let me pick it up here he says first we'll have to keep on until the last time there will never be a change apply that to the church ages the kind of man that god chose for the first age and how god manifested in that man's ministry would be the example for all other ages what god did in the first church age is what he wants to do in all other ages now that first church jesus said unless a corn unless a seed unless a corn of wheat goes into the ground and dies it abideth alone and brother madam says what what why why did that first church age fall so that there could be a second church age so that there could be a third church age so that there could be a fourth tree and he said in all of those ages they were a restoration of the truth notice it was all that the palmer worm all that the cankerworm all that the caterpillar i will joel's message i will restore saith the lord and so he gives back redemption is giving back it's a restoration back i don't want you to miss that here because it's important to what the message of the hour was and is it's a restoration back are you with me and he says there will never be a change listen to this next quote here now we know exactly from the word which was recorded by the holy spirit how the first someone say first three people okay i didn't mean to say someone everybody say first he says how the first or original church was founded and how god manifested himself in her thus what the church was at pentecost is yesterday we don't need that anymore no no no can't noah noah couldn't uh preach moses couldn't preach noah's message getting a boat and float down the nile no we don't need that anymore we don't need that the days of miracles are passed that's really what you're saying it's the same spirit he says that's what the church was at pentecost now notice not 1906 azusa street not the welch revival not daddy seymour that's not pentecost that was a restoration of gifts brother branham says what the church was at pentecost acts the acts experience are you here is the standard that is the pattern there is no other pattern there is no other pattern there is no other pattern i love that brother brandon said that thank you for saying that i don't have to say it i'm just repeating it there is no other pattern god has not changed that pattern what god did at pentecost first seed genesis beginning he has to keep on doing until the church captioning ages close is over don't you believe it really simple secondly they referred to an age of manifested holy ghost powers being over since the bible has been completed i love this simple straightforward direct answer that is untrue can you say amen the promise of power with which the apostles were endued at pentecost is to you jews to your children jews to all them that are far off and to as many as the lord our god shall call both jew and gentile until he stops calling the pentecostal message in power will not cease what the church had listen to what he says here what the church had at pentecost is her you me inalienable right everyone wants to talk about rights today did you know you got a right you got a right to everything god gave you and you don't let no man or no teacher or no doctrine no theory not me not anybody take it away from you it is your inalienable right brother adam said that's what god said to joshua what wherever the soul of your feet touch that's yours and don't let anybody take it from you you say what's the soul of my feet it's my revelation whatever god has given to me no man can take away from me it's my inalienable right originally she had the pure word of god she had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs and wonders and gifts of the holy ghost amen brother branham that original church was not organized by men it was led by the holy ghost it wasn't very big it was hated and despised it was oppressed it was persecuted unto death but it was true to god it stayed with the original word pattern i want to stay with the original word pattern what was that first church it was the seed church the alpha church you can back up brother jeremy the alpha church the beginning church the the the seed church who was it for it was for believers it's not for unbelievers it's not for make believers it's for the elected family of god it's amazing because the bible the the beginning verse says that the former treaties have i made oh theophilus you know the brother man doesn't say much about this man theophilus the bible actually doesn't say much about this man theophilus the best we have is that this man i want you to notice this here this this man theophilus his name means friend of god did you know luke wrote this book for one person hallelujah that's right did you know all of this book this is who it was addressed to it's important that you catch that the book of acts was addressed to one man it's not like the gospels whose address to many to the multitudes to the thousands theophilus you know what theophilus sounds a lot like to me theophany former treaties have a nato theophany oriole theophilus notice luke writes his entire gospel this entire book to one person oh my brother my sister the book of acts is to one elected lady the rest of the world may not know what to do with it but the by the but the bride knows what god wants done with his word it's a revelation done to her and it speaks to beyond your senses the word speaks to beyond your ears beyond your mind or your intellect it goes to your theophany to the seed gene of god down inside of you and something in you says i believe it i'm a believer i can't explain it but i can't understand it all i know is that i believe it amen hallelujah what does amen mean so be it lord i may not understand it but i believe it he wrote it for one man theophilus elected chosen before the foundation of the world chosen in god oh this is exactly what the prophet of god says here it was that first inheritance that first original church that first experience that new testament church jesus says i will build my church thus what the church was at pentecost is her inalienable right it's her inalienable right i love how the prophet of god says that he says it's it's a it wasn't organized by men that's why we said the message is not an organization the message is not it was brother adam says it was i mean yeah the prophet of god says this church book it was led of the holy ghost wasn't very big it was hated in despise it was oppressed it was persecuted unto death but it was true to god it stayed with the original word pattern so there was a pattern that was sent forth there was something god set forth there was a there was a pattern it was going to follow in all other ages and brother adam says history would keep repeating itself in the generation of israel we see revival in one generation only to see the fire is fading that's the next slide only to see the fires fading in the next and the third generation embers may be glowing slightly but in the fourth there may be no vestiges whatsoever that original flame then god lights the fire again and the same process is repeated it's simply the manifestation of the truth that god has no grandchildren salvation is not passed on by natural birth what does brother brandon point to he says that that revival that died that first age that died he says then god lights the fire again the same process is repeated what is it it's the manifestation that that the message within and of itself just that revival doesn't sustain itself but every generation has to be baptized with the same pentecostal experience i know you get into the weeds there sometimes when you say that but it's just what the prophet of god said and and i know we've defined and people has defined pentecostal experience means this or it means that well you say brother matt what does it mean it's exactly what it means it means experience that you experience god and you say how do i know i've experienced god very simple you're changed when you have an encounter with god if it's really not when you encounter when you open up your bible and you intellectually understand it and read it and hear it you can do that satan does it too it's good it's profitable but when you have an encounter with god you're different you go walk out in the street in front of a semi truck you know what you're having you're having an encounter with a semi-truck and i promise you you will forever be changed by that encounter and when you encounter god you are forever changed when you have a collision with god he changes you in ways that you couldn't change yourself you say how do i know brother ma i know because i'm not brother as the woman said i may not be who i want to be but i know i'm not who i used to be there's something different in me there's been a change in me i've experienced god they're not the same anymore listen to what brother adam says they're not christians you have to be born of the will of god not the will of man the previous slide he says not the will of man to be saved but the original fires died down they're not the same anymore they're not the same anymore something's changed something's died that experience go to the next slide the fervent desire to please god the passion and those word the cry for reaching out of the spirit all begins to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of god it's cooled off and became a bit formal that's what was happening back there to the ephesians they were getting a bit formal the abandonment to god was dying out and the people weren't too careful about what god thought of them as they begin to be careful about what the world thought next slide that second generation coming on was just like israel they demanded a king to be like the other nations when they did that they rejected god but they did it anyway that is the history of the church of jesus christ you see within that book of acts seed gospel church you keep reading that book of acts as god begin to thin down the numbers and many the bible says many problems many issues he said brother matt what does that mean one age leads to the next stage to the next stage but brother adam says there's nothing beyond this there's no eighth eighth messenger beyond this the only thing after this is a harvest i want to close here just for a moment and bring you back to what we were reading in isaiah isaiah 21 2 brother jeremy if you want to put that on the screen and we'll hold that till next wednesday isaiah 21 2 i want you to see what isaiah though he sees this future messiah and it was all based upon the words of the prophet uh the prophet by the bible says that he looks into the future now the by the scripture zechariah is going to have many prophecies that are that are post or you could say post uh tribulation that you can read about you can read them you can read a lot about it in zechariah jeremiah isaiah but i want you to notice this here in in isaiah chapter 21 verse three and isaiah begins to say this he says for this reason he begins to see something here vision falls upon him he's not seeing the messiah anymore now he sees way off into the future and jeremiah says my loins if you could put that up brother jeremy that was the right one verse 3. he says therefore are my loins filled with pain pains have taken a hold upon me as the pangs of a woman that traveleth i was bowed down at the hearing of it i was dismayed at the scene of it verse four this is a vision he begins to describe my heart panted fearfulness of frightened me the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me so something strikes the heart of this prophet and and isaiah begins to list this and say i was i just i became in pain even physical pain at what isaiah was seeing here this great what what isaiah sees is this falling down of the babylonian system in verse 9 of chapter 21 if you want to read that but isaiah begins to say here in verse 9 of chapter 21 there he says behold here cometh the chariot of men with a couple of horsemen and he answered and said babylon has fallen has fallen in all the graven images of her gods he hath broken to the ground so what did what what did isaiah begin to see here as he sees this great army this great chariot army of horsemen this great enemy riders and horsemen and and and and and chariots and he says he says here he says he's seen the downfall notice what he was seeing all of the judgment and all of the destruction that was going to come upon the earth back up to verse 7 here and he begins to cry out and he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen a chariot of asses a chair of camels and he hearkened diligently with much heed and and i want you just to catch the words here i we skipped ahead but i'm going backwards i know verse five brother jeremy catch just some of the words isaiah begins to use here he says prepare the table prepare the table why because of what i've seen the judgment that's come in the destruction that's coming prepare the table watch in the watchtower eat drink arise you princes and he says and anoint the shield prepare the table watching the watchtowers there's judgment coming armies coming marching outside oh he says what is what is this what is isaiah saying watchmen you better you better cry out you better pay attention as we preach to you you better be sober you better be diligent you better be vigilant you better be on your guard he says in verse 6 just keep going there brother jeremy for thus hath the lord said unto me go said a watchman let him declare what he seeth what a vision isaiah begins to have here he says in isaiah chapter 30 if you have that verse 9 and verse 10 isaiah 30 verse 9 and verse 10 and he's going to begin to speak of these watchmen that he cries out to and he says that this is a rebellious people lying children children that will not hear the law of the lord which say to the seers see not imagine this was a prophecy of 2020. scripture has compound meaning you ever you want to talk about a of a better fulfillment today just look around say unto them say unto the seer see not to the prophets prophesy not unto us write things speaking to us smooth things prophesy deceits prophesy deceits is that what the new testament says they'll heap unto themselves teachers having itching ears and you know what people don't like prophets like this prophesied to us happy things oh yo doom and gloom brother brandon picks it up and in the sudden secret catching away of the church you'll listen to that message brother branham preaches gives a story about pearl harbor and he says could you imagine there as they were drinking that night before he said just all in a stupor and he says they're at the bar and he says that man came in ringing the bell they're coming there they're coming you got to get out of here get to your senses get to your post oh brother adam says that spirit on those people they were so intoxicated he said oh you worry wart oh you you doomsday oh you you you why don't you why don't you be quiet why don't you just why don't you just why don't you just shut up enough for your gloom enough of what you're saying but but but he's a watchman he's on the tower he's anointed to speak what he sees do you realize how maniacal it would be for him to to to not cry out when the enemy he sees coming to destroy notice what he says in isaiah 21 verse 6 for thus hath the lord said go set a watchman let him declare what he seeth let me tell you something my brother my sister we had a faithful watchman that came in our generation what a faithful watchman who declared what he's seen and i'm glad god gave us a watchman i'm glad god gave us a word that has vision and it's not blurry it's not blurry we'd have a word of these preachers these prophets so-called prophets on television you know someone out there has back trouble has back pain of course thousands of people watching somebody has back pain oh i can just see it of course they see it of course you have all the modern day people of course people see judgment but let me tell you something we didn't receive a generic blurry prophecy we have a clear word of prophecy paul's word we have a sure word of prophecy we have something we can hold on to we have something that can establish the church watchmen a watchman could say in ezekiel 3 7 son of man i have made thee a watchman unto the house of israel therefore hear the word of my mouth and give them warning from me isaiah 62 6 i have set watchmen upon thy walls o jerusalem which shall never hold their peace day or night ye that make mention of the lord keep not silence and give him no rest till he establish and make jerusalem a praise in the earth what was he saying there's going to be a watchman on the wall there's going to be a word that sounds out and declares and a watchman you know what a watchman doesn't do a watchman doesn't it doesn't just sit over the you know the tower wall and they you know they they sort of look over and say oh hey hey we've got an enemy hey guys hey there's trouble down here they're they're putting ladders oh there's a ladder there hey they got a ladder that's not what a watchman does what a waste anybody can do that anybody can get up on the wall and tell you when there's trouble but the the gift of a watchman is that the watchman could look and see miles and miles and miles and miles and he could identify what you would look at and see just as a little speck that watchman could say oh that's not a harmless speck that's an army that's an invader you know what the watchman is sent to do he's sent to identify seed there's a gift in a prophet that we don't have and that's to identify seeds brother brandon would preach a message the seed of discrepancy are you here what was he doing he was a watchman identifying seeds he wasn't going to identify the fruit anybody could identify the fruit if i give you an apple and i give you a tomato and i give you an orange and i say now brother if you've really got a gift you'll tell me is this an apple or an orange you say ah that's an orange how can you tell well it's orange but you take those seeds give me give me give me the seeds of that fruit put it out before you say now tell me well i think that's uh appleseed no wrong answer you see what the importance of that is is that there are seeds of god and they're seeds of discrepancy and god sent a messenger who was a watchman on the wall who wasn't going to just come and say here's the fruits here's what it's going to look like no but he was going to identify seeds that's why he'd crowd against the television show called i love lucy and everyone would say seems so harmless but let me let that's the seed let me show you the fruit modern day television is the fruit is the manifestation of the seeds he's gonna he's gonna prophesy and he's gonna speak about the seed of christian songs saying to the time of rock and roll music brother adam says they called me in the room here in my apartment he says and i've seen those boogie woogie says ricky's he says singing that singing gospel hymns through the time of rock and roll now what you would what you would hear if you heard that i'm sure today we'd go oh wow you know that's what brother branham called boogie woogie rock and roll well let me tell you something he was a watchman identifying seeds and then you see what's produced today in modern mega churches today it's the fruit of the seed but he was a watchman and he was coming to identify seeds isaiah says he says declare now this is this is this is from ezekiel 3 17 the one that we just now read son of man i made thee a watchman he says in isaiah 62 verse 6 that's what it was i've set watchmen upon the walls of jerusalem which shall never hold their peace day or night so what was it going to do it was it was it was sent to give hope it was sent to give encouragement that you've not been left in the dark you've not been left to figure this out you've not been left listen to me my brother and my sister you don't have to fear with what you see in the world today because you don't have to figure it out god's not figuring it out as he goes you already had a watchman come and declare to you and to cry to you all you've got to do is believe what has already been said are you glad for that this is exactly what what the bible says verily verily i say unto you luke 21 verse 32 verily verily i verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all be fulfilled heaven and earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away and take heed to yourself less than any time your heart should be overcharged with sir fire team drunkenness and cares of this life so that that day come upon you unaware for as a snare uh uh for as a stair shall come on them that dwell all of them that dwell on the face of the earth luke 21 32-36 watch ye therefore watch ye therefore what are we doing watching what are we watching that should be the question watch ye therefore what are we watching what jesus just said my words heaven and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away what am i going to be watching for that facebook cnn nbc uh you know some kind of a news outlet no watch the words of jesus for my words heaven and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away for this generation shall not pass watch you therefore and pray always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man that book of acts church was a praying church they were christians who prayed the bible says that that church was born birthed at a prayer meeting that's how that book of acts church was started tearing praying all in one mind one accord and the the rushing mighty wind the spirit of god came in like a rush he might have went rushing mighty one what was it started from prayer the disciples the bible says continued in the apostles doctrine in teaching and in prayer what was that book of acts seed church the disciples continued to pray they were proclaiming they were preaching but they were praying all the time that those leaders the apostles of that first church had gone to jesus earlier those same men and asked him to teach them to pray and then jesus said now that i've taught you now instruct others teaching them how to pray i would that men pray always everywhere from jesus to the book of acts to every true church in every generation what you find down through the years is believers practice prayer we're going to close here just for a moment as we just take a a turn do you know what that word acts this is amazing you know what that word means acts that's almost misleading a little bit if you if you're not careful with our english when you read the book of acts acts means it comes from the latin word proxies proxies you know what praxis means it's where we get the word practices so what are you reading you're reading the practices of christians what does the bible say they were first called christians at antioch that means they didn't label themselves hey guys let's come up with a good name what should we name ourselves no their lives were so manifested that they were like jesus that the bible says they were called christians because they're like christ and these were their practices this is the way that they lived this is the way we're going to get into this more lord willing next wednesday this is the way that they lived they devoted themselves acts 2 42. the bible says that they devoted themselves to the apostles doctrine and to they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and fellowship amen two fellows in a ship fellowship communal was all about community i know we want to get rid of that but it's in the bible and in the breaking of bread and in prayers prayers you read acts 4 and go read about what led up if you go read about just in acts 4 in your own time it gives you all of the events that lead up to such a mighty prayer meeting peter and john the bible says we're arrested for what preaching you know sometimes bad things can happen to you and you didn't do anything to deserve it they didn't do anything to deserve to get arrested but they were just preaching put in jail the bible says held in jail then the sanhedrin gives an order that they're never to speak again in the name of jesus or teach in the name of jesus the bible says that they get released out of prison they come back to the believers and they tell them everything that the sanhedrin said don't ever preach don't ever teach jesus again you know what the bible says that the those believers those early believers did says that they all got out their signs and their markers they started writing all the things they're going to protest and they started marching in front of the sanhedrin is that what you read no the bible says they assembled themselves in prayer they took the matter to the lord they took the matter to the lord said brother matt why are you preaching on that because i'm preaching on the acts experience this is what it meant to practice this is what it meant to live as a christian they took the matter to the lord in prayer in prayer david says in psalms 138 verse 3 he says in the day when i cried thou answered us me and strengthened me with strength in my soul and the day i cried david knew what it meant to pray david knew what it meant to commune with the lord david says i've proven you god i've proven you in all of my trials and all of my dark times and all of my darkest mysterious hours when i didn't have no one else to turn to i turn to the lord i sought only you and you here's what david says here's my testimony you heard me and you gave me strength for the battle that i was facing you caught in trouble and then david says they caught in trouble against me and you delivered me and answered me through what through prayer through what god gave him the power of prayer hebrews chapter 2 verse 3's musicians can come we're just going to have to find a spot to stop hebrews 2 how shall verse 3 how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation you know what that word neglect means it means to have little concern or to take lightly to have little concern or just play something softly if you could to take little concern or to to take lightly how shall we escape if we neglect what does it mean to neglect salvation when you neglect any part of your salvation the context of this verse you can read it in in many different ways but it's it's it's all of your salvation what is what's what's one of the greatest brother adam said the greatest weapon
