[33:38] the Lord Jesus and it was powerful it
[33:43] was just just to see when Jesus steps on
[33:48] the scene and when that presence of the
[33:49] Lord really comes anything can happen
[33:52] and this lady Mary Magdalene she was
[33:54] delivered of her demons Jesus called her
[33:57] by name a name that nobody knew and then
[34:01] he quoted a scripture that that was dear
[34:04] to her heart and she just knew there was
[34:07] something special about this man and I
[34:10] think that all of us can have that same
[34:11] experience and it was powerful and when
[34:14] I was asking the kids we had a
[34:16] discussion afterwards and I said what
[34:17] was your favorite most of the the um the
[34:19] young people they said that it was the
[34:21] ending and it was a really powerful
[34:24] ending but let me tell you no matter how
[34:27] great a movie can be it can't even touch
[34:31] the true the real life when you truly
[34:34] meet Jesus Christ and you know that he's
[34:37] alive and you feel his power there is
[34:40] nothing in the world that can compare to
[34:42] it we can write books about it we can we
[34:44] can make movies about it but man when
[34:47] you really come into His presence and
[34:49] you see that he is real and you see that
[34:52] he is the same yesterday and today and
[34:55] forever there is something about that
[34:57] that it changes your entire life and
[35:01] that's what we want for everyone that
[35:06] comes into this church everyone that
[35:08] comes into contact with any of us we
[35:11] want them to know this living Jesus
[35:14] Christ we want all of us I want to know
[35:18] him I want to know him better than I
[35:21] know him he is so deep he's so wide he's
[35:24] he is so great the the the more I get to
[35:27] know him the more I read this book The
[35:29] more great the greater he gets he is
[35:32] just he is
[35:34] everything and if we can just lead just
[35:37] one soul to know him even just encourage
[35:43] someone we don't a lot of times people
[35:46] they they want to go out and witness and
[35:47] they want to have a Ministry and they
[35:49] they want to go go on the Evangelistic
[35:52] field to win these souls to Christ but
[35:56] you have to be careful that you're not
[35:58] just trying to get a trophy that you're
[36:00] not just trying to get someone that your
[36:02] name is attached to that you can say I
[36:05] led this person to Christ no no no if
[36:07] you can just represent Christ to that
[36:10] person I've got my you heard Bethany
[36:12] sing just now my sister-in-law we got
[36:14] Adam my brother with us we are Evans

[36:47] Adam speak for a little bit and give us
[36:49] some testimony about what he's been
[36:51] doing you know we talk about the Lord a
[36:54] lot but James teaches us he says don't
[36:58] just be hearers of the word anybody can
[37:01] hear the word but be
[37:04] doers of the word and I wanted Adam to
[37:06] come up and and give some testimony

[37:24] and and
[37:26] encouraging these
[37:28] these people that really they have no
[37:30] God in their
[37:32] lives and really many of them the only
[37:36] Jesus Christ that they have ever seen is
[37:39] in my brother Adam and and it's so

[39:42] always very close coming up and they
[39:45] were just being teenage boys you know if
[39:49] you had teenage boys I don't need to
[39:50] explain anymore but if you haven't just
[39:53] pray for anybody with teenage
[39:55] boys so they were starting to be teenage
[39:58] boys and I I got my boys into boxing I
[40:02] said hey there's this boxing gym down
[40:03] there instead of punching holes in all
[40:05] our wall maybe they can you know hit a
[40:07] bag or you know hit each other and so
[40:10] they they kind of they caught onto it
[40:12] real quick and my brother Dan and I
[40:14] would talk and he's like yeah I want to
[40:16] get Daniel involved and so just matter
[40:17] of weeks Daniel was involved and we
[40:20] ended up at this this gym where the
[40:23] owner of the gym is a Christian he knew
[40:26] kind of where we come from he he kind of
[40:27] knew uh the Believers there in
[40:30] Jeffersonville and knew a lot of the
[40:32] same people and he said hey I want to do
[40:33] something for the Lord with this gym and
[40:36] he and I his name is Jeremy which
[40:38] ironically is our other brother's name
[40:39] is Jeremy but uh Jeremy the owner of the
[40:42] boxing gym he he says this and I said
[40:45] yeah let me talk to my brother I know my
[40:46] brother has a real gift in his life a a
[40:49] you guys see it he he really does he has
[40:51] a gift in his life to talk to people I
[40:53] said let me talk to Daniel and and let's
[40:56] let's come up with a plan so we did we
[40:58] got together um we had a big open house
[41:01] I don't know if any of you guys you guys
[41:02] know who Tim Witherspoon is you guys
[41:04] remember that boxer Tim Witherspoon he
[41:06] come down and kind of helped us open the
[41:09] gym and with Tim Witherspoon there and
[41:11] just rough crowd we preached to him and
[41:15] we started talking to talking about the
[41:17] Lord and we brought the Lord Jesus
[41:19] Christ into that gym and we started
[41:22] every week for 20 minutes maybe 15
[41:26] minutes we would just talk to these
[41:28] young kids about the Lord talk about
[41:30] their life talk about how they can
[41:32] improve it talk what tell them what the
[41:35] Lord Jesus has done for us and just do a
[41:38] little bible study talk about the word
[41:40] and it um that's been six years ago it
[41:44] doesn't feel like it but it's been it's
[41:45] been six years ago and and it it hasn't
[41:48] stopped we just keep going and sometimes
[41:52] I'll get a little down I'll think man
[41:53] I'm not it's not making a difference
[41:57] um and it hurts you know it's like am I
[42:00] am I doing anything
[42:03] and what I always come back to is just
[42:07] show up show up and do something show up
[42:10] and mention the name of the Lord
[42:12] Jesus and it it changes people just
[42:15] these these young people they've never
[42:17] heard that name before tell you a quick
[42:19] story there's this young lady now um
[42:22] that's that's coming there her story she
[42:25] grew up very poor so we live in
[42:27] Louisville Kentucky area home of
[42:29] Muhammad Ali just saying um but there's
[42:33] some really poor areas and that's kind
[42:35] of the the kids that kind of come toward
[42:37] boxing you're usually generally poor
[42:39] well she was in that area and grew up
[42:41] poor and she was about 10 years old she
[42:43] started getting abused um by her uncle
[42:46] so it was just her and her mom and her
[42:48] uncle started abusing her and she she
[42:52] knew it was wrong she knew something bad
[42:54] was happening but she didn't really know
[42:56] how to EXP it so this went on for a
[42:59] while and she finally went to her mom
[43:00] and said Mom this is happening I need
[43:02] help and her mom was in a bad place also
[43:06] and her mom said well don't tell anybody
[43:08] because they'll put Uncle so and so in
[43:11] prison if you tell anybody and she let
[43:14] it continue and so this happens for year
[43:17] after year after year until her mom gets
[43:21] in trouble and her mom goes to prison
[43:25] and so now this young lady need needs
[43:27] somebody to raise her she's in her mid-
[43:30] teens at this time and she needs
[43:31] somebody to raise her and what does the
[43:33] court do gives her to her uncle and so
[43:36] now her uncle is Raising her the one
[43:39] that's causing her this abuse and things
[43:42] just seem very dark for her and it's
[43:45] terrible and she goes on until she
[43:48] finally gets the courage up one more
[43:50] time and she tells a friend this is
[43:52] what's going on and it took a lot of
[43:55] Courage for her to do this this young
[43:56] lady's she's strong she strong I admire
[44:00] her and her friend told her mom you know
[44:03] friend's mom and they called the police
[44:07] and the police
[44:08] come find evidence of this and they
[44:11] arrest the uncle so now she's this I'm
[44:15] condensing a lot of this time but now
[44:18] she's older
[44:19] maybe 17 18ish maybe 19 I'm not not
[44:24] really sure today she's
[44:27] 20 maybe I'm not sure but
[44:32] so she's on her own everybody that she's
[44:35] ever trusted has betrayed her she
[44:38] couldn't trust her mom she couldn't
[44:40] trust her uncle these people who were
[44:41] supposed to be taking care of her of her
[44:43] and loving her she's at rock bottom and
[44:46] she has a seizure she says how could
[44:49] life get any worse and randomly she has
[44:53] the
[44:54] seizure and they take her to the
[44:56] hospital they don't really know what
[44:57] caused the seizure but while she's in
[45:00] the hospital this nurse starts
[45:03] testifying to her she's like do you know
[45:05] do you have Jesus in your life and this
[45:08] young lady's name is Jordan and
[45:10] Jordan no you know I've heard of Jesus
[45:13] but I don't I don't really know and but
[45:17] it piqued her interest she said there's
[45:19] something about that that I liked and
[45:21] she was telling me this story she goes I
[45:23] don't know why but there was this this
[45:25] kind of Desire this thirst and said I
[45:29] need that I need what that nurse was
[45:31] talking about and so she goes on life
[45:35] she's waiting
[45:36] tables trying to make a living and
[45:39] there's this this man that frequented
[45:42] the restaurant and he was very kind to
[45:45] her and he started talking to her and
[45:47] she started telling him some of the
[45:49] problems and he says well I'm a minister
[45:52] minister of the Gospel I want to invite
[45:54] you to my church and she's like okay
[45:57] okay maybe maybe this is that and so she
[45:59] started going to the church and she's
[46:01] athletic girl and she at that same time
[46:04] she says I've always wanted to learn how
[46:06] to box and so she comes to the boxing
[46:08] gym this is where we meet and I'm there
[46:11] talking about Jesus and she's looking
[46:14] she says this nurse is telling about him
[46:16] then this man is a minister and now I'm
[46:19] going to this church now I go to
[46:21] boxing I believe this this is what I
[46:24] need in my life and she accepted the
[46:27] Lord Jesus Christ she's turned her life
[46:30] around she's going to school she's
[46:32] working she's going to law school um
[46:35] she's gonna I can tell you right now
[46:37] she's going to do something with her
[46:38] life and so let me ask you did did I did
[46:43] this ministry that we have at the boxing
[46:46] did did that change her was that it was
[46:51] that the no I I just being honest no it
[46:54] wasn't but it was part of it
[46:57] am and it was the part that I was
[46:59] supposed to do I wasn't supposed to do
[47:02] the other parts I can't do I'm telling
[47:04] you I can't do what my brother Daniel
[47:05] does I'm as far as I feel I'm not called
[47:09] to do that I don't I don't have a desire
[47:11] to do that but I can talk to these young
[47:14] men at the boxing gym and it's something
[47:17] I'm showing up I'm trying to do what I
[47:21] can do it's nothing compared to what my
[47:23] brother Daniel does but the Bible talks
[47:26] about
[47:27] if you if everybody wants to be the eye
[47:30] in the body who's going to do the
[47:32] hearing that's right you know and if
[47:34] everybody wants to do the be the ear
[47:36] like who's gonna who's gonna walk who's
[47:38] gon to talk who's gonna so we all have
[47:40] different roles to play but the point of
[47:43] me telling you her story and telling you
[47:46] this story about the gym is to say you
[47:50] have a role also you need to play
[47:52] offense
[47:54] sometimes I was talking to this young
[47:56] man here Juan last night sorry Juan I'm
[47:59] going to put you on the spot I was so
[48:02] impressed by him I can tell he's a he's
[48:04] a good young man and Juan is he's
[48:07] struggling with something in his
[48:08] personal life where he wants to he wants
[48:12] to live a certain way and be a certain
[48:15] way but there's people in his life that
[48:17] don't want him to do
[48:19] that and we were talking about it and
[48:22] Juan there's I'm just saying this from
[48:25] experience there's nothing that you can
[48:28] say that's going to change
[48:31] them but there's things that you can do
[48:35] that's going to change them amen okay
[48:37] amen we got time for an experiment I
[48:39] want to do a quick experiment do an
[48:41] experiment with you all right I'm going
[48:44] to give you some simple instructions and
[48:45] I want you to to do what I tell you to
[48:47] do okay this is this is a very easy
[48:50] little game there's no real tricks here

[49:47] listen to you but believe me they're
[49:50] watching
[49:51] you and that action is far more more
[49:57] important than anything you can say okay
[50:01] and it's the word isn't in action it's
[50:05] action the doing of something amen

[50:30] whatever that's good to talk about it

[50:48] brother he's he's better at this I'm
[50:50] gonna I'm not going to take his

[51:00] that's there for everybody to read and
[51:03] once you say you know what I'm a
[51:05] Christian that's the top of the
[51:08] billboard it says I am a Christian and I
[51:13] and that's blank it's fill in the blank
[51:16] I am a Christian and
[51:19] I yell at people in
[51:21] traffic okay uh guess what oh that's
[51:25] what Christians do
[51:27] I am a
[51:28] Christian and I scream at my
[51:32] parents for people who are reading your
[51:35] life Daniel that was humbling you're
[51:37] saying that my life maybe is the only
[51:40] Christ that these people will ever
[51:42] see if I am doing those things wow this
[51:45] is a Christian that's what Christians do
[51:47] I am a Christian and I yell at my
[51:50] parents okay that's what Christians do
[51:52] but I am a Christian and I love my
[51:57] neighbor amen I am a Christian and I
[52:01] serve others amen that's what we want
[52:04] that billboard to be right we we are
[52:08] that representation the Bible says you
[52:10] guys know what an epistle is it's like a
[52:13] a writing an epistle and it says
[52:16] our we are living Epistles we are living
[52:21] letters to people about Christ I am a
[52:25] Christian and I do
[52:28] this got
[52:31] it Jesus said this is to the church and
[52:36] I think you guys should be so proud of
[52:37] this Jesus said when I when they look
[52:41] he's talking to his disciples and he
[52:43] says when they look at you how are they
[52:46] going to know you're my
[52:50] disciples was the answer it's like well
[52:53] they don't drink that's how they know
[52:55] they're going to be my no no was it well
[52:58] they don't um they don't go and party at
[53:00] night that's how they're G no that's not
[53:02] what he said I'm not saying we should do
[53:04] those things we shouldn't but Jesus said
[53:07] how will they know that you are my
[53:09] disciples for your love for one another
[53:13] they're going to see you love each other
[53:15] that's how they know you're one of his
[53:18] so I'll leave you with that love each
[53:20] other be in action and fill out the rest
[53:23] of that sign I am a Christian and I
[53:27] it's up to you yeah thank you brothers
[53:29] and
[53:30] [Applause]
[53:37] sisters we're here so much we need
[53:41] Unity we all need to get along we just
[53:44] need to love one another
[53:46] brother there's going to come a point in
[53:48] time that we need to start really doing
[53:50] it and let me tell you it's not
[53:53] easy some people are easier to to love
[53:56] than other
[53:58] people but Jesus didn't qualify the easy
[54:02] ones to love in fact he said it's easy
[54:04] to love those that love you we need to
[54:07] love those that hate us I appreciate
[54:10] Adam because he is really he's putting
[54:13] it into action
[54:16] he's he's being a Christian we don't
[54:18] have a works-based Salvation we're not
[54:21] Catholic the Catholics see that they can
[54:24] work their themselves to Heaven by by
[54:26] saying so many Hail mares or or doing
[54:28] this that's not what we believe you
[54:30] can't work yourself to heaven but let me
[54:32] tell you you have to obey God's word and
[54:36] God's word says to do
[54:39] something and if you really believe
[54:41] God's word we are saved by the blood of
[54:43] Jesus Christ unmar Grace but if we
[54:46] really believe him then we're going to
[54:49] be up and doing our lives are going to
[54:52] be filled with action as Adam was
[54:55] telling me that
[54:56] story um oh oh uh could you put the
[55:00] picture up there real quick I want him
[55:01] to get a visual of this young
[55:07] lady there she is with another one of
[55:09] the boxers at the
[55:11] gym she's uh
[55:17] yeah a young lady who came from a very
[55:21] very difficult
[55:23] background a a background that uh is
[55:26] really
[55:28] horrible and not only is she serving God
[55:32] but God is blessing her and giving her
[55:34] education he's going to give her a
[55:36] career she's going to be successful
[55:39] remember there are blessings that come
[55:41] with serving God there's hardships that
[55:42] come with serving God but if you're an
[55:44] honest person if you're doing what Jesus
[55:46] said you're also going to be successful
[55:48] in life that I can guarantee if you're
[55:51] if if you live up to what you say people
[55:53] are going to want to hire you they're
[55:54] going to want to do business with you
[55:57] thank you um let's turn our
[56:00] Bibles as Adam was telling me the story
[56:03] I said you know there is a scripture
[56:04] that is exactly what you're saying let's
[56:07] turn our Bibles to Matthew chapter
[56:09] 23 remember for the kids last night we
[56:13] saw we were introduced to this guy
[56:15] Matthew and how he was really um really
[56:19] good at keeping numbers and all of that
[56:21] but I'll tell you what the guy was a
[56:23] total creep I mean he was dis honest he
[56:27] was stealing from the people he was
[56:29] hated but God changed his life around
[56:33] and this this one that we saw last night
[56:35] in the video this is the one that God
[56:38] chose to write one of his four gospels
[56:41] and the most comprehensive of all the
[56:43] gospels is the Book of Matthew Matthew
[56:45] chapter 23 now Jesus had just got
[56:49] done speaking to the Pharisees and
[56:51] Sadducees and giving them giving them
[56:53] Parables and then he turns his eyes from
[56:59] the
[57:00] priests and he looks out into the
[57:03] congregation into us just the normal
[57:08] people then spake Jesus to the
[57:12] multitude and to his
[57:14] disciples saying the scribes and the
[57:18] Pharisees they sit in Moses's seat
[57:20] they're here in the Pulpit judging the
[57:22] people and and
[57:24] preaching they sit in in Moses's seat
[57:28] all
[57:30] therefore whatsoever they bid you to
[57:33] observe whatever they tell you to
[57:37] do that observe and that
[57:41] do but do not ye after their works for
[57:46] they say and they do
[57:49] not what an example what an example of
[57:53] what brother Adam was saying is how many
[57:56] so-called Christians say that they are
[58:00] Christians and then yet they yet don't
[58:02] do it they're quick to give you their
[58:05] opinion and how you should live your
[58:07] life and and how you should make your
[58:09] decisions but those are the people what
[58:13] decisions are those people making in
[58:15] their own
[58:17] lives they're quick to tell you and
[58:19] they're quick to tell me well brother
[58:22] sister what are you doing in your own
[58:23] life you show me
[58:27] faith without works as James said and I
[58:31] will show you my faith by my
[58:34] works I will show you I don't have to
[58:36] tell
[58:37] you you just look at my
[58:40] life and you look and you see what I'm
[58:43] doing as Adam said they'll all talk
[58:45] about they'll talk about unity and
[58:47] they'll talk about forgiveness if you
[58:48] have a problem with somebody else
[58:50] they're quick to say sister Shirley you
[58:54] just you got to get over it you gota I'm
[58:56] I'm talking to the sweetest person in
[58:58] the entire
[59:00] building you got to get over that and
[59:02] you got to you just can't be dwelling on
[59:05] that and then what are these people
[59:08] doing somebody does them wrong and see
[59:11] how they react I'll tell you I'd want to
[59:13] take my advice from sister Shirley even
[59:15] if she's not willing to give it because
[59:17] she's walking the walk she's not just
[59:21] talking the talk she's walking the walk
[59:22] and she is the she is living this gospel
[59:27] verse number
[59:29] four for they bind heavy burdens and
[59:32] Grievous to be born and lay them on
[59:34] men's shoulders but they themselves will
[59:36] not move them one of their
[59:39] fingers these are the guys who are too
[59:41] good to get down and
[59:44] dirty they won't take out the trash in
[59:47] church but they surely want to be up in
[59:49] the Pulpit preaching they want to be in
[59:52] front of the
[59:54] people and when it comes to to the other
[59:58] things when we need help cleaning the
[1:00:00] floors or when we need help painting the
[1:00:01] walls or we need help these things well
[1:00:04] I got something better to do but you
[1:00:06] watch those people who are willing to do
[1:00:09] anything those are the ones that God
[1:00:10] really uses they're the ones that God
[1:00:13] really takes their
[1:00:16] Ministry and whether it be pressure
[1:00:19] washing the front porch and then God
[1:00:21] will use that person to lead a soul to
[1:00:23] to lead a soul to him
[1:00:27] but all their
[1:00:29] Works they do for to be seen of
[1:00:33] men they make broad their felties and
[1:00:36] enlarge the borders of their garment
[1:00:37] brother Ed or brother ly are the felties
[1:00:40] on the forehead or they on the
[1:00:44] arm yeah they're they're they're to
[1:00:47] they're something for show these are
[1:00:48] these are the prayers and and they make
[1:00:51] these things
[1:00:52] broad so everybody can be seen so they
[1:00:55] can be seen and they enlarge the borders
[1:00:57] of their garments and they love the
[1:00:59] uttermost rooms of at feasts and the
[1:01:01] chief seats in the synagogues and the
[1:01:03] greetings in the market and to be called
[1:01:05] of men Rabbi
[1:01:07] Rabbi Pastor priest
[1:01:11] father but be ye not called Rabbi for
[1:01:15] one is your master even Christ and all
[1:01:19] ye are
[1:01:21] Brethren and call no man your father
[1:01:23] upon the Earth for one is your father
[1:01:26] Father which is in heaven I know we we
[1:01:29] laugh about it some of the people close
[1:01:30] to me because some of the homeless
[1:01:31] people around here they call me Father
[1:01:35] Daniel another one's call me Pastor you
[1:01:38] know it's like well it's it's F it's
[1:01:41] funny we we joke around but can you
[1:01:43] imagine really
[1:01:45] truly calling a man your father on
[1:01:49] Earth and putting that man in the place
[1:01:51] of
[1:01:53] God can you imagine doing that yet
[1:01:56] the priests are to this day called
[1:01:59] father that is in direct Defiance of
[1:02:03] this scripture right here and call no
[1:02:06] man your father upon the Earth not
[1:02:10] talking about your dad your Earthly dad
[1:02:12] but call no man your
[1:02:15] father the one that leads you no no
[1:02:18] there is
[1:02:19] one for there is there for one is your
[1:02:22] father which is in
[1:02:24] heaven neither be ye called Masters for
[1:02:27] one is your master even Christ but he
[1:02:29] that is greatest among you let him be
[1:02:32] your
[1:02:33] servant the very word servant is a
[1:02:37] derivative of the word
[1:02:39] serve and he that is greatest among you
[1:02:42] is the one that is serving you serving
[1:02:45] is an action serving is doing
[1:02:49] something and that's that is what a
[1:02:51] servant is that's what we're about is is
[1:02:54] Christianity is up and doing it's
[1:02:57] moving it's I I I have received the Lord
[1:03:00] Jesus Christ as my savior unmar Grace I
[1:03:04] Lord I I am so thankful that you have
[1:03:06] forgiven my sins and now I am showing
[1:03:09] that I am a Christian because I'm out in
[1:03:12] doing I'm leading souls to Christ I'm
[1:03:14] I'm in I'm I'm witnessing to people and
[1:03:18] not just that you might not be good at
[1:03:19] that that's okay lord it's my calling to
[1:03:23] be working here in the church to be
[1:03:25] serving these people Lord it is is
[1:03:28] whatever you want to call me to maybe
[1:03:30] it's to help other people maybe it's
[1:03:32] maybe it's for my donations what
[1:03:34] whatever it might be Lord I want to be
[1:03:38] in your plan and there's many different
[1:03:40] plans we all don't have to be up here in
[1:03:42] the pull pit
[1:03:43] preaching but we must be doing something
[1:03:47] if you say that you are in the body of
[1:03:50] Christ and I hope that we all say that
[1:03:52] we are then you have a purpose
[1:03:56] and you need to know what that purpose
[1:03:57] is otherwise you're not doing any good
[1:04:02] serving is doing something and whosoever
[1:04:05] shall exalt himself shall be abased and
[1:04:08] he that shall humble himself shall be
[1:04:12] exalted see so many people say I'm
[1:04:16] serving God now we should say that I
[1:04:20] quit drinking I quit smoking quit lying
[1:04:22] quit cheating quit cussing and that's
[1:04:25] good you shouldn't do any of those
[1:04:27] things but that is not serving God
[1:04:30] that's not doing
[1:04:32] something when you say I'm serving God
[1:04:34] now it's not because you quit your old
[1:04:36] sins you should quit your old sins but
[1:04:40] that's not serving that's not doing
[1:04:42] something we went through Obadiah on
[1:04:44] Wednesday and the the the sin of the
[1:04:48] was watching their Brethren be
[1:04:52] conquered by an invading our army and
[1:04:55] doing nothing but standing back there
[1:04:57] and watching it
[1:04:59] happen if they would have least
[1:05:02] tried if they would at least tried to
[1:05:04] help God probably wouldn't have cursed
[1:05:06] them but he said you saw you just stood
[1:05:09] there and you watched your brethren from
[1:05:12] Israel you watch the invading Armies
[1:05:14] come in and you watch the invading
[1:05:16] armies destroy
[1:05:18] Israel and you didn't do anything about
[1:05:22] it therefore you're cursed
[1:05:26] brothers and sisters when we go before
[1:05:28] the
[1:05:29] Lord are we going to say Lord I quit
[1:05:32] lying quit cheating quit smoking quit
[1:05:34] quit doing all my drugs and quit quit
[1:05:37] doing all these things Lord I did it all
[1:05:38] for
[1:05:40] you and is the Lord going to look down
[1:05:42] upon us and
[1:05:44] say so what you're saying is you did
[1:05:47] nothing for
[1:05:49] me because quitting something is not
[1:05:52] doing something that's not doing
[1:05:55] something
[1:05:56] and when you quit something and we
[1:05:58] should youall know me we should we
[1:06:01] should quit all of our sins but when we
[1:06:05] quit something there's a there's
[1:06:07] something in our bodies there's
[1:06:09] something in our souls that that sin is
[1:06:13] taking up space whether it's sleeping
[1:06:15] around before you're married whether
[1:06:17] it's lying whether it's doing drugs
[1:06:20] whether it's gossiping there's something
[1:06:23] that sin whatever sin you have whatever
[1:06:25] in there when you get rid of that sin it
[1:06:28] creates a
[1:06:30] void there's a hole there
[1:06:32] now and that hole has to be filled up
[1:06:35] with
[1:06:35] something fill that hole up with the
[1:06:39] things of the Lord fill that hole up
[1:06:42] with serving the lord and then that hole
[1:06:44] is no longer a hole that space is taken
[1:06:48] the enemy can't get in there anywhere
[1:06:50] because there's no room for
[1:06:52] him and then when the Lord stand when
[1:06:55] the Lord there and as my little
[1:06:57] hypothetical scenario so what you're
[1:06:59] saying is you did nothing for me while
[1:07:03] you were on
[1:07:04] earth when I needed clothes you didn't
[1:07:08] give them to
[1:07:09] me sister Lois when I needed
[1:07:12] socks you didn't give give them to me
[1:07:16] when I was hungry you didn't feed me
[1:07:18] when I was thirsty you didn't give me a
[1:07:20] drink when I was sick you didn't come
[1:07:22] and pray for me when I was in prison you
[1:07:24] didn't visit
[1:07:26] me when the church needed help you
[1:07:29] didn't
[1:07:31] offer but you quit sinning so much but
[1:07:34] you still
[1:07:36] sin all sin and come short of the glory
[1:07:39] of God but in quitting these things what
[1:07:42] did it produce it should have produced a
[1:07:45] holy
[1:07:47] vessel that is now set aside and
[1:07:50] Sanctified for the service of God and
[1:07:54] what is the service of God just read it
[1:07:56] it's serving his
[1:07:59] people I remember when I resigned my
[1:08:04] position in Louisville to go into the
[1:08:08] ministry I remember my boss I was this
[1:08:10] up upand cominging kid I was I was uh I
[1:08:12] think I was 34 years old and and really
[1:08:16] just had the whole world in front of me
[1:08:19] and I had the opportunity as Adam did to
[1:08:23] to go into the ministry and serve the
[1:08:25] people there and I went into my boss's
[1:08:29] office and I said his name is Mark I
[1:08:31] said Mark it's time for me to leave the
[1:08:33] USGS it's time I I'm I'm leaving I'm
[1:08:36] taking another job and he stood up he
[1:08:38] says are you
[1:08:40] nuts he said do you know what you have
[1:08:43] here do you know what the future you
[1:08:45] have do you know where they're they're
[1:08:47] they're thinking of sending you do you
[1:08:48] do you know what's do you know what's
[1:08:49] your what's going on and he saidh he
[1:08:53] said you're going to make a million
[1:08:54] bucks aren't you
[1:08:56] he says you're you got a you got a high
[1:08:59] paying job and I said I said' Mark I
[1:09:02] said when I leave this
[1:09:05] earth and when I look back on my
[1:09:09] life I want to be able to say that I did
[1:09:12] something I want to be able to say that
[1:09:14] I accomplished
[1:09:15] something and the greatest thing that I
[1:09:19] could do would be to help change
[1:09:23] someone's life amen
[1:09:25] I mean I could come up with a new way to
[1:09:27] collect environmental data I could come
[1:09:28] up with a a new flow model that that
[1:09:31] shows the water flowing through the
[1:09:32] different caves in Kentucky I could do
[1:09:34] something like that and make some
[1:09:35] groundbreaking stuff but what good would
[1:09:37] that do really but just further science
[1:09:41] just a little bit
[1:09:42] more but what if I could really change
[1:09:45] one
[1:09:46] Soul one person what if I could like
[1:09:49] Adam's doing what could what if I could
[1:09:51] have an effect on just one person it's
[1:09:54] like taking a Stone you have a calm Pond
[1:09:56] you take a stone and you throw it out
[1:09:59] there in the water and it makes a big
[1:10:01] splash and those ripples go out and you
[1:10:04] change that one person then that one
[1:10:06] person he has a testimony now and he
[1:10:09] changes another person it might be his
[1:10:10] wife it might be his children and he is
[1:10:12] an influence on that person those
[1:10:13] ripples go out and pretty soon Adam you
[1:10:16] know what that spot that you threw the
[1:10:17] Rock in it's just it's just calm again
[1:10:21] that that is gone but those ripples
[1:10:25] from that impact they keep going and
[1:10:29] they keep going and that's what we have
[1:10:31] the opportunity to do is make a
[1:10:33] difference make a change make a change
[1:10:36] in our lives first and then make a
[1:10:39] change in others our children's and and
[1:10:40] our brothers and our sisters and and our
[1:10:44] parents and to to get past these
[1:10:50] sins and then make it worth our while to
[1:10:54] get past them
[1:10:56] and you say brother Daniel I got so much
[1:10:58] sin in my
[1:11:00] life I can't do
[1:11:02] anything I'm doing this and I'm doing
[1:11:05] this and I'm doing that and I've done
[1:11:07] this and I have I have these weaknesses
[1:11:10] and and I come from the streets I've got
[1:11:12] all these tattoos and I've I've got all
[1:11:14] this stop looking at
[1:11:17] Satan stop giving Satan credit for your
[1:11:21] life it's like you know what I am past
[1:11:24] that
[1:11:25] I have given my heart to the Lord Jesus
[1:11:28] Christ I am a different person that was
[1:11:30] the old me I had sin in my life and now
[1:11:34] I am moving forward and you know what I
[1:11:36] still fail I still mess up I still see
[1:11:38] all the problems within me but Lord I'm
[1:11:41] going to serve you you know it's in the
[1:11:44] Bible it's all over the place in the
[1:11:46] Bible but let me read to you something a
[1:11:49] great man Isaiah chapter 6 listen to
[1:11:52] this
[1:11:56] verse number
[1:11:59] one yes in the year that King Uzziah
[1:12:02] died I saw Isaiah speaking I saw also
[1:12:06] the Lord sitting upon the throne high
[1:12:08] and lifted up and his train filled the
[1:12:09] temple in an experience with
[1:12:13] God above it stood the seraphim each one
[1:12:16] having six
[1:12:17] wings and with
[1:12:19] Twain he covered his face and with Twain
[1:12:23] he covered his feet and with Twain he
[1:12:27] did fly Bethany can you think that song
[1:12:30] you just sang I can
[1:12:32] feel that brush of angels wings and here
[1:12:36] is Isaiah he had that very same
[1:12:40] experience and one cried to another and
[1:12:42] said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts
[1:12:46] the whole earth is full of his glory and
[1:12:48] the posts of the door moved at the voice
[1:12:51] of him that cried and the house was
[1:12:54] filled with smoke there a prophet he
[1:12:56] sees all of this Holiness around him he
[1:13:00] sees these angels and he he he he's in
[1:13:02] the presence of God and he
[1:13:05] says woe is
[1:13:08] me for I am
[1:13:12] undone he says I'm a man of unclean lips
[1:13:14] and I dwell in the midst of people with
[1:13:16] unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the
[1:13:18] king the Lord of hosts I am a
[1:13:21] sinner is what the prophet Isaiah is
[1:13:24] saying and he doesn't list his his
[1:13:26] faults what he needs to give up or what
[1:13:28] he gave up but he probably said wow I've
[1:13:30] done this and I've done this I guarantee
[1:13:32] you he
[1:13:33] did I've done this and I send this very
[1:13:36] this very morning I did this and and
[1:13:38] last night I did this and and yesterday
[1:13:39] I was driving and I cut that guy off and
[1:13:41] I I shouldn't have done that no I'm not
[1:13:43] worthy and then I told a lie I told a
[1:13:45] lie I told a lie how can I handle the
[1:13:47] word of
[1:13:49] God and he said I am a man of unclean
[1:13:54] lips
[1:13:56] from mine eyes I've seen the king the
[1:13:59] Lord of hosts then flew one of the
[1:14:01] seraphim unto me having a coal a live
[1:14:04] coal in his hand which he had taken with
[1:14:06] the tongs from off the Altar and he laid
[1:14:08] it upon my mouth and said Lo this has
[1:14:11] touch thy lips and thine iniquity is
[1:14:13] taken away and thine sin is purged so
[1:14:16] this live coal touching the the lips of
[1:14:20] this man this sinful man purged away his
[1:14:24] sins what would that's a live call what
[1:14:27] would the blood of Jesus Christ do to
[1:14:28] any of
[1:14:29] us what would the filling of the holy
[1:14:32] spirit that was something different this
[1:14:35] is Jesus Christ himself the King of
[1:14:38] Kings the Lord of lords what if he would
[1:14:41] come down and dwell within me you're
[1:14:42] talking about purging my
[1:14:44] sins you're talking about making me
[1:14:47] holy he changed right there did he stop
[1:14:51] sinning
[1:14:52] no but something changed in this man
[1:14:57] Isaiah and he says I I'm not worthy but
[1:15:02] that Spirit came
[1:15:05] down and after this young man Isaiah he
[1:15:09] gives his heart to the Lord maybe he's
[1:15:11] baptized in the Holy Ghost he he goes up
[1:15:13] he's baptized in the waters of baptism
[1:15:15] he makes a change in his life he makes a
[1:15:17] commitment Lord I'm going to be
[1:15:18] different and then he hears a voice from
[1:15:22] Heaven this is this is cool this is
[1:15:25] really great this is this I love this
[1:15:28] part then he he hears a voice from
[1:15:32] Heaven the
[1:15:34] Lord the Lord had a job to do and it was
[1:15:37] a job for other
[1:15:40] people and this is a sinner he just said
[1:15:42] I'm a man of unclean lips I have all the
[1:15:44] sin in my life I'm doing all of this and
[1:15:46] and he gives his heart to the Lord and
[1:15:49] he hears the voice of the Lord cry out
[1:15:51] who shall I
[1:15:52] send and who shall go who shall go
[1:15:55] before us now this
[1:15:57] man that had all the sin and all of
[1:16:00] these
[1:16:01] things he says Lord here I am send
[1:16:09] me so who will go for us who will
[1:16:12] represent the Lord to those who need
[1:16:14] help Isaiah just saw how sinful he was
[1:16:18] he just saw all of his
[1:16:20] weaknesses and he says
[1:16:23] Lord send me
[1:16:25] I want to do it I want to help I want to
[1:16:29] do Lord whatever you would call me to do
[1:16:31] I want to do it I'm a sinful person but
[1:16:34] I had an experience with the Lord and I
[1:16:36] may not be worthy but I'm
[1:16:40] willing and it's a willing heart that
[1:16:42] God
[1:16:44] requires and all have as I said all have
[1:16:47] sinned and come short of the glory of
[1:16:48] God but there are a few people who are
[1:16:50] willing to take the opportunities that
[1:16:52] they're given and to make the most of
[1:16:54] what God allows them to
[1:16:58] do in all
[1:17:00] eternity we can't understand eternity it
[1:17:03] doesn't have a beginning and it doesn't
[1:17:04] have an end our minds don't think that
[1:17:07] way we think in time but in all of
[1:17:09] eternity there is just one short period
[1:17:12] that we call
[1:17:13] time the day you were
[1:17:16] born to the day that you die that's the
[1:17:20] only time that we have to serve God
[1:17:22] that's the only time that we have to
[1:17:24] make a
[1:17:25] difference and guess what everyone in
[1:17:27] this room I don't see anyone yeah
[1:17:31] everyone in this room that's
[1:17:34] breathing has that opportunity right now
[1:17:37] and we are living in that
[1:17:40] time book of
[1:17:42] James chapter 4 it says
[1:17:45] this verse number
[1:17:47] 13 go to
[1:17:50] now ye say that today or tomorrow we
[1:17:53] will go into a such a city and we will
[1:17:55] continue there a year and buy and sell
[1:17:58] and get
[1:17:59] gain so you're thinking about your
[1:18:01] career you're thinking about I'm getting
[1:18:02] rich I'm I'm going to go into this
[1:18:04] business I'm going to make a million
[1:18:05] dollars doing this but stop for a moment
[1:18:07] and let me let me just give you a life
[1:18:09] lesson all
[1:18:11] right that you can talk about it all you
[1:18:15] want you can talk about what you want to
[1:18:17] do you can call talk about something
[1:18:19] that you want to accomplish you can talk
[1:18:21] about being rich you can talk about all
[1:18:23] all of these things that you want to do
[1:18:25] but that has nothing that does
[1:18:27] absolutely nothing it takes hard work to
[1:18:30] get
[1:18:31] anywhere and if you really if you have a
[1:18:34] goal to be successful in in whatever way
[1:18:37] it is you got to work for it that is
[1:18:41] just the way of the world that we live
[1:18:44] in you got to work for it I saw Adam
[1:18:49] know he and Adam and I were we together
[1:18:51] and and and I saw Adam have get his mind
[1:18:56] set on doing something and I saw him
[1:19:00] going to night school I saw him taking
[1:19:02] classes when he wasn't at work I saw him
[1:19:05] working all the weekends and and and
[1:19:07] trying to put together this other career
[1:19:10] in his 40s a new
[1:19:13] career doing his best working struggling
[1:19:18] trying trying to come up with the money
[1:19:20] to pay for the school and then get his
[1:19:23] degree
[1:19:26] and
[1:19:27] then get a job a very very good job I
[1:19:33] saw him do it but you know what it took
[1:19:37] didn't take talking about
[1:19:39] it I've told Daniel
[1:19:42] before that you young people you can
[1:19:46] talk about it and talk about it and talk
[1:19:47] about it you may be 20 years old now
[1:19:49] then 21 22 pretty soon you're going to
[1:19:51] be 40 years old and you're going to be
[1:19:52] saying yeah I wanted to do this when I
[1:19:54] was a kid did but I didn't do it because
[1:19:56] you know why because you didn't do it
[1:19:59] because you didn't put your money where
[1:20:00] your mouth was you didn't put your your
[1:20:02] efforts into doing
[1:20:05] something and you just talked about it
[1:20:08] and the same thing goes with serving
[1:20:10] Christ you gotta do it you gotta you
[1:20:14] gotta step up and work for it verse
[1:20:17] number
[1:20:18] 14 whereas ye know not what shall be on
[1:20:22] the tomorrow for what is your
[1:20:25] life it is even a vapor that appear for
[1:20:29] a little time and then vanishes away you
[1:20:32] we've seen we don't see you see in
[1:20:34] Jeffersonville you see in the mornings
[1:20:36] there's this fog that comes down and you
[1:20:38] see it sometimes here like in in the
[1:20:41] cold when when there'll be a Mist above
[1:20:44] the grass from the humidity back East
[1:20:46] though there'll be a fog that's in the
[1:20:49] low-lying areas and then when the sun
[1:20:52] comes up it's completely
[1:20:56] gone and there's no more of a fog there
[1:20:59] there's no more of a Mist it's
[1:21:00] completely burned off and the sun
[1:21:02] shining and you look at it's like where
[1:21:03] did that go but while he was there it
[1:21:07] was watering the seeds that were laying
[1:21:08] on the surface of the
[1:21:11] ground it was providing moisture for for
[1:21:14] some of the plants that need moisture
[1:21:15] they get watered that way it was it was
[1:21:18] doing something but then it faded away
[1:21:21] and it was gone and the the the Apostle
[1:21:23] here is saying
[1:21:25] what is this our
[1:21:28] lives they're here and then they're gone
[1:21:31] and then there's nothing left of
[1:21:34] them for that you ought to say if the
[1:21:37] Lord will we shall live and do this or
[1:21:40] that never get ahead of the Lord and say
[1:21:42] I'm going to do this for the
[1:21:43] Lord as we were both saying before you
[1:21:46] find your position in Christ and then
[1:21:48] you move that
[1:21:50] way but now you rejoice in your boasting
[1:21:54] all such are evil therefore to
[1:21:58] him this is my point to him that knowth
[1:22:02] to do good and doeth it not to him it is
[1:22:10] sin so you
[1:22:12] can cheat on your spouse and it's
[1:22:16] sin you can go out and get tanked up and
[1:22:19] it's sin you can go murder and it's sin
[1:22:22] and you can do nothing and it's still
[1:22:26] sin you cannot do what you know you
[1:22:28] should do and that is sin
[1:22:33] also you get to be to be man you can say
[1:22:37] hey I'm not so bad I'm not such a bad
[1:22:39] guy anymore I'm not doing the drugs
[1:22:41] anymore I'm not I'm not uh I'm not
[1:22:43] having sex out of wedlock anymore I'm
[1:22:45] not I'm not looking at at at the stuff
[1:22:48] on the internet I shouldn't look at I'm
[1:22:49] not doing all these
[1:22:52] things but you're you're still sinning
[1:22:56] because you're not doing what you know
[1:22:59] you should be
[1:23:01] doing Jesus said in Matthew chapter 10
[1:23:05] he made this statement let me see if I
[1:23:07] can find the
[1:23:11] scripture he
[1:23:13] said yeah Matthew 10:37 he says this he
[1:23:17] said he that loveth a father loveth
[1:23:19] father or mother more than me is not
[1:23:21] worthy of me and he that loveth son or
[1:23:24] daughter more than me is not worthy of
[1:23:25] me that's a pretty bold statement how
[1:23:28] many of us really live that life and how
[1:23:29] many of us are really aware of that and
[1:23:31] he that taketh not his cross and follow
[1:23:35] after me is not worthy of
[1:23:38] Me Jesus can you imagine carrying that
[1:23:41] cross down the streets of Jerusalem to
[1:23:45] his
[1:23:46] death look at all the people that were
[1:23:48] watching him walk by and doing nothing
[1:23:51] and how many people
[1:23:53] knew that this is wrong what's happening
[1:23:56] to that man and yet they did nothing I
[1:23:59] believe it was prophesied to be that
[1:24:01] way but in Obadiah and those
[1:24:07] they watched the Brethren and
[1:24:10] get massacred and they did
[1:24:13] nothing Jesus said no no no no you don't
[1:24:16] do nothing now you pick up your cross
[1:24:20] put it on your back just like I did and
[1:24:23] you carry it and and you win souls to
[1:24:25] Christ you talk to you you encourage
[1:24:27] your daughters you encourage your sons
[1:24:29] you help people you do things that you
[1:24:32] know are right or else it is
[1:24:35] sin are you with
[1:24:38] me take up your cross carry that cross
[1:24:43] and
[1:24:43] follow
[1:24:51] Christ oh close
[1:24:55] my favorite
[1:24:56] scripture and this one really is I say
[1:24:59] it pretty much whenever I'm preaching I
[1:25:01] was oh it's my
[1:25:03] favorite this one's really my
[1:25:07] favorite this is on my WhatsApp thing
[1:25:09] has as the scripture yeah see they knew
[1:25:12] I didn't say it Jeremy

[1:27:01] God for as we have many members in one
[1:27:04] body and all members have not the same
[1:27:07] office so we being many same Adam was
[1:27:09] quoting 1 Corinthians chapter 12 here it
[1:27:11] is again Romans chapter 12 so we being
[1:27:14] many are one body in Christ and everyone
