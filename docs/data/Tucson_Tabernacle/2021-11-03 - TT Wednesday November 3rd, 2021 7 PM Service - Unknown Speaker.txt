to be with you tonight before sister martha sits down and before we read from the word i'd like us to sing an old hymn it was penned in 1883. it's called i know whom i have believed it's it's a methodist song and for what we refer to as a philadelphian shirt j gender john's west john wesley i'm sure you know it if you don't the words are in really big print up there [Music] i know not why god's wondrous grace to me he has made known nor why with mercy christ in love redeem me for his own i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i've committed unto him against that day i know not how this saving faith to me he did impart nor how believing his word brought peace within my heart but i know who i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i've committed unto him against that day i know not how the spirit [Music] of proves revealing jesus through the word creating faith in him but i know i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i've committed unto him against that day i know not when my lord may come at night for noonday fair nor if i walk the veil with him or meet him in the air but i know home i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i've committed unto him against that day [Music] thank you sister martha there we go isn't it a glorious time to be alive to know our god not a fable not a myth not a well-crafted story not to know of him not to know about him but to know him to know whom i have believed i'm looking at the clock it's wednesday i'll try to be brief let's join our hearts and minds together in prayer to our lord as we approach reading from the bible whose pages we hold so dear lord jesus it's an honor and a privilege and a grave responsibility to be up here this evening lord i pray that you would move me out of the way lord forgive me where i fall so short lord jesus may you minister to your people tonight may you have words that will encourage and that will strengthen and that will heal and that will draw us closer together and draw us closer to you lord it's our desire to worship you to love you and to please you every day every hour every moment of our life we thank you in jesus precious name amen before we're seated we'll read from a familiar portion of the word the book of ecclesiastes the opening verses of chapter 3. now this book is attributed to solomon it was composed therefore more than 2 900 years ago when i was a teenager in california the verses we're going to read were also the words to a song that peaked at number one on the billboard music chart on december 3rd 1965. it was in the top 100 for 14 weeks more than three months i i can't read this passage without sometimes hearing that soundtrack that's sometimes playing in my head hearing the music to that now the refrain of the song that we just sang together i know whom i have believe it that's a bible verse set to music but this is church we often do that can you imagine tuning to a popular music station today rock and roll or rap or whatever and hearing not just what amounts to gospel music but bible verses set to music and people listening to that over and over and over the most played song in america for three months that'd be almost as surprising as hearing an unbiased news report not going to happen well let's read ecclesiastes 3 to everything solomon tells us there's a season there's a time to every purpose under the heaven and solomon lists a number of contrasts that occur in life he says there's a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and and a time to reap to pluck up that which is planted a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up the time to weep time to laugh time to mourn and a time to dance a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep time to cast away a time to rend and a time to sow a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love a time to hate a time of war a time of peace please be seated and god's great plan there's both time and a time for everything there was a time for joseph to go to egypt arriving not only on the day but at the very minute that potiphar would suddenly appear in a certain slave market there was a time for pharaoh to decree the male hebrew babies to be killed so that moses would be raised in the king's house there was a time for moses to rescue the descendants of jacob israel from egypt there was a time for daniel to go into captivity in babylon there was a time for the maccabean revolt there was a time for jesus to be born and a time for him to die for us there was a time for stephen to be stoned in front of saul there was a time for philip to be on a lonely desert road to witness to an ethiopian noble there was a time for paul to spread the gospel of jesus christ throughout the mediterranean world more recently there was even a time for adolf hitler to foment an unspeakably horrific reign of terror there was a time for harry truman to grant diplomatic recognition to the modern nation of israel at its inception at a time when america was the sole superpower on this planet there was a time for brother branham's ministry to come on the scene and a time for him to depart there was a time for each one of us here or anyone that might see or hear this to recognize his or her my individual sin and need for a savior to accept and respond to the embrace of jesus christ and it's time now tonight for us to be gathered once again in this place to worship to praise to hear his words of life to us we're not here by chance i have a question for you well really i think the lord has this question for me and perhaps for you as well if this evening was your last evening in this life would you be able to look back on today and say thank you lord today was a good day i redeemed the time i was a doer of the word i have forgiven all who ever offended me regardless of my wounds i've taken responsibility for my actions i've made things right with any and all whom i think i may have offended i tried to let your light shine for me today lord i reflected your love by and through your grace i believe you were pleased with me today lord how can we live each day so we can say that in solomon's list of times he carefully contrasted things time to do this then time to do the opposite but there are some things where it's never time to do the opposite we should love the lord and never hate him we've read and heard so many times of late that we should always be thankful we should never be unthankful and we should hold to god's unchanging hand as we often sing here we should hold fast and and never let go i'm taking a couple of notes with me because when i come out from behind here and just speak without looking at my notes we might be here all night some 21 years ago heather and i moved to washington state we stayed there for about a dozen years and near our home there was a small private lake a couple of acres it wasn't particularly large but our extended family had permission to to go up into that private area and use that lake if we wished well one of my nephews had tied a rope to a branch on a limb of a tree a very stout road and a very strong branch and and it was it was kind of near the edge of the lake set back a little bit on this embankment and here's this branch and this really stout rope and you kind of walked along this trail and you'd get up and and the idea was to get a hold of this rope and then swing out over the lake and let go which is the right time and if you let go at the right time you'd land in the lake if you didn't the problem was that straight down there were rocks not not a pleasant place to land and if you didn't let go you'd smack right back into the embankment and wish you'd let go so you had a lot of incentive to hang on and to let go at the right time well naturally they wanted uncle lyle to enjoy this activity my nephew said come on uncle isle you can do this well after watching some of the younger generation do that i decided okay i'll give it a try well i forgot two things one i was at that time it seems young now but i was 51 years old at the time so i was a little heavier than i'd been in the days when i would swing on ropes i never was tarzan but but that was a fine but but the other thing that that had happened over those years is in in spite of the fact that i i worked at a desk job for many decades i hadn't built up a lot of upper body strength my upper body weight was not concentrated in my chest well i grabbed the rope i jumped i swung out from the embankment i quickly realized i was slipping down the rope and not at a slow rate of speed well what happens in any kind of a physical system where you've got a certain amount of energy and you're changing the center of gravity we have what we call in physics conservation of energy conservation of motion conservation of momentum what it basically means is as the as the weight slides down the pendulum the pendulum swings more slowly which which meant that not only was i going faster down the rope but i was approaching the lake slower and slower and slower well was i trying to solve a lot of physics equations in my head in those moments no i was looking at those rocks they were getting mighty close so what did i have to do well i i was able to bend my knees and bend my waist and tuck it and and let go of the rope at about the same time the rope let go of me and i managed to splash into the water it was pretty shallow right there but it was softer than the rocks this is not an example of graceful motion or of great acrobatic skills excuse me i need to get back up here because heather reminded me this past week of something that brother linhart used to say when you get to the end of your rope tie a knot hang on hold fast brother reggie preached her last week from hebrews unintentionally he said my brother noel has been preaching in india every couple of weeks from the book of hebrews so i'm going to read a little bit from the book of hebrews so we'll be in good company hebrews 10. starting at verse 23 paul says let us hold fast seize hold tightly and retain firmly grasp the profession of our faith without wavering unswervingly regardless of the passage of time or changing circumstances for better for worse for he that's jesus is faithful trustworthy reliable dependable sure but promised and let us consider one another be continually aware attentive watching over one another learning how to provoke stimulate stir up incite each other unto love and to do good works not forsaking giving up abandoning neglecting the assembling of ourselves together as believers as the manner or the habit or practice of some is but exhorting admonishing warning urging encouraging one another and so much the more all the more faithfully as you see the day the day of christ's return approaching so tonight i'd like to encourage you to do what paul wrote going back to verse 23 let us hold fast to the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised hold fast to the profession of our faith and that's the title of the message tonight hold fast i want to share with you directly from the pages of the bible his words are true they're life we're often told the oldest book or narrative of the bible is that of job what did job have to say about holding fast job 27 verse 6 he says my righteousness i hold fast and will not let it go my heart shall not reproach me so long as i live job asserted his claim to innocence because he knew he'd been obedient to all of god's requirements known in his time his righteousness was anchored in his unwavering faith in god our our righteousness is by faith in jesus christ and in him alone in the face of calamity after calamity loss of wealth possessions sickness even the death of his children whom he loved and cherished do anything for job clung to his faith he held it close unwavering he knew where he stood with god even as he wondered lord why is all this happening to me solomon had something to say on this topic as well from the proverbs in a section where solomon is teaching his son he says my son this and my son that and he says in proverbs 4 13 take fast hold of instruction let her not go keep her she is thy life the instruction of course is not just the book of proverbs that he's talking about they were still being written and collected and compiled solomon's referring to the entirety of the scriptures but at the time of the writing of proverbs the bible was the torah the pentateuch the five books of moses there may have also been some of the histories such as joshua or judges or ruth but they weren't considered canon at that time the psalms may have been collected by then the writings of his father who had just recently passed away perhaps even one of the scrolls of samuel had been written by then but none of the major or minor prophets no isaiah no jeremiah no malachi or amos no kings or chronicles they were just started as a set of journals being compiled over the history of israel which was really just beginning well moving on paul reminded timothy to study to take fast hold of instruction and not let it go to show himself approved of god rightly dividing the word of truth and in the final letter he wrote before his execution paul encouraged timothy in a manner similar to how solomon had encouraged his son in proverbs 2 timothy 3 starting at verse 15. he says to timothy and that from a child you were raised with this timothy you have known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation to give you the wisdom to accept the salvation that comes through faith which is in christ jesus what we call the old testament pointed to jesus as the messiah by the time that paul was writing this the old testament had been compiled and was considered scripture was considered canon paul goes on all scripture is given by inspiration of god some translations read all scripture is god breathed we talked a bit about nephesh a few weeks ago and is profitable for doctrine teaching the truth for reproof rebuke convicting of sin for correction of error correcting faults for instruction in righteousness discipline training and right living to do what is right verse 17 that the man of god the people of god the servants of anyone who belongs to god may be perfect perfect here means complete mature capable thoroughly furnished unto all good works fully equipped now timothy was familiar with scriptures from childhood he'd been tutored in the ways of the lord while not rare such a background was not common we're very fortunate in our time literacy is taught at no cost to virtually every child in america and much of the world the ability to read not so many years ago was a special skill accessible only to the wealthy or those employed in a way that required knowledge of letters and books scrolls codices were incredibly expensive they were all handwritten pre-industrial society was generally inefficient people labored and scratched out in existence from the soil they had no time for school nor could most afford a tutor for their children who were needed in the fields anyway how much value do we place on our literacy to what ends do we employ it what do we spend time reading how much of our time is spent browsing the internet reading and responding to posts on social media texting and emailing rather than conversing me when writing to the church of thessalonica paul concluded his first letter with an exhortation encouragement to the believers there let's read part of that first thessalonians 5 starting at verse 16. oh speaking to the believers there says rejoice evermore he mentions this attitude in letter after letter the joy of the lord is our strength pray without ceasing this is a matter of attitude not posture keeping our hearts and minds on the lord on the things in life that matter he tells us a lot about this in philippians for example he says in everything and not necessarily for everything but in everything give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you what's the will of god in your life to be thankful nothing mysterious here brother how can i be in god's perfect will for my life paul tells us plainly god's will for us is to give thanks in everything in every situation quench not the spirit he says don't stifle the holy spirit in your life but rather yield to the spirit of christ in you die to your own desires your own flesh let him live his life through yours despise not prophesying all things to prove means to test hold fast that which is good grip it tightly don't let it go you've made progress to this point don't slide back abstain from shrink back keep aloof from stay away from all appearance of evil you're being watched don't compromise your integrity your life testimony and the very god of peace sanctify you sanctify separate cleanse and prepare you for his service holy completely every which nothing left out and i pray god your whole your entire spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless not only without sin but without even blame not a hint of it unto the coming of our lord jesus christ faithful reliable dependable trustworthy is he that calleth you who also will do it who called you christ who says he'll do it do what sanctify you holy that your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless until he returns in second thessalonians paul continues his theme of holding fast in one of my bibles this block of verses is headed stand firm ii thessalonians chapter 2 starting at verse 13. paul says we are bound compelled to give thanks every now and again sometimes occasionally when we feel like it when things are going good no we're compelled to give thanks always to god for you brethren and the greek this word translated brethren is a gender neutral word a better translation might be siblings we're siblings in christ beloved of the lord paul's a doer a practitioner of what he preaches what he teaches he tells people always to be thankful and here he claims that he does that very thing why is he always thankful in this case because god hath from the beginning who god when from the the beginning which beginning there's only one the beginning before the foundation of the world we read in another place god has chosen you to salvation redemption through sanctification of the spirit and belief faith trust confidence acceptance of the truth where unto he called you where unto in other words to what to sanctification and belief by by what means he called you by our gospel and it will ultimately result in what to the obtaining of the glory of our lord jesus christ therefore because of this siblings stand fast and hold the traditions the teachings the instruction which you have been taught whether by word or our epistle tradition it's not a song from fiddler on the roof it's not the the sort that jesus scolded the pharisees over where they have made the word of god of none effect by their traditions that's not what paul's talking about traditions in this context are teachings which the recipient in this case the thessalonians but in the broader sense us have been entrusted to transmit to spread the church the cult out the ecclesia and thessalonica are being told to keep a strong grip not to pollute or dilute and certainly not to forget and whether paul taught them these truths by speech when he was physically present when he was absent perhaps by others as his emissaries like timothy or silas or by letter they're important to be studied remembered taught spread cling to which you have been taught by christ through paul stand fast hold fast don't waver in a second letter to timothy which is his last letter ever paul says something similar ii timothy the first chapter starting somewhere in the 11th verse is as i paul am appointed appointed by the lord jesus a preacher a herald a proclaimer and an apostle a special messenger an emissary and a teacher of of what of of this good news to the gentiles for the which cause in other words this is why i also suffer these things as i do being in prison nevertheless i'm not ashamed for or because what we sang earlier i know whom i have believed paul says i know him in whom i have put my trust says the complete jewish bible the amplified bible says i perceive have knowledge of and am acquainted with him whom i have believed adhered to trusted and relied on in other words paul isn't relying on a teaching a concept a theory a book a concept an imagined thing he's met the resurrected lord jesus he has an ongoing relationship with god it's not just a pillar of fire on the road to damascus and that's it no no and based on that relationship and that trust built over time shared experiences he goes on to say not only do i know whom i have believed but i'm persuaded i'm convinced that he that christ is able to and implied is not only his ability but his desire and his willingness to keep to guard to protect that which i have committed unto him against that day uh oh he doesn't have his notes in 1966 we were introduced to the message in california and uh some families came directly here to tucson the the dougals or the rashards and some others brother linhart uh felt like the lord was putting on his heart to go up to idaho somewhere in the region not too far from spokane washington where he had established a church when he was a part of the lutheran uh denomination and my parents and therefore i moved up to orofino idaho with him my brother noel was along brother lonnie jenkins was along with us at that time we rented a house there and my parents had a bedroom and the linhart's had a bedroom and carol and rosanne had a bedroom and then there was a basement level in there and we hung up some curtains in there we put in two bunk beds so dave lindheart and i were in one bunk bed and my brother noel and brother lonnie were in another bunk bed and alan lindheart sometimes he comes here and you see him he slept in the coal bin the place was was heated by fuel oil by then so he didn't sleep with a cold but he slept in what had been the cold bin and daniel slept in the laundry room anyway brother lonnie if any of you ever knew brother lonnie jenkins he was just on fire he learned something he dug into it he he grasped it and he shared it so he was getting invitations from some of the local small pentecostal churches there and so he was speaking in different places and we'd go along of course and um i remember one time we were singing the song that we opened up with tonight i know whom i have believe it and and after service brother lonnie looked at me i was a 16 year old kid right what did i know and he looked at me and he said well he said what have you entrusted into him against that day what is that song about i hadn't really thought about that and looked at him and i said well lonnie in those days i called him juani he was he was like part of the family he lived with us for many many months in california and it's a long history and story we maybe shared some time but i said i've i'm trusting you with my life with everything he said yeah that's right that's right and and that made me realize that sometimes when we're singing songs we have to pay attention to the words it's not just rhyming verses somebody was we're we're saying that we're proclaiming it we're singing it sometimes when we sing um uh like there's going to be a meeting in the air there there's a line in there that says and of jonah and the whale we often sing well you notice i never speak that line when we're singing that song i don't know any song about jonah i don't know anything about a whale i know about a great fish but i certainly don't often sing it so maybe based on that experience with the lining when i was 16 years old i don't sing that particular line i'm not saying that you shouldn't talk i'm just i'm just sharing i'm just sharing goes on here in verse 13 he says hold fast guard keep with the greatest care the form of the form of sound words the pattern of wholesome and sound teaching which thou hast heard of learned from me in in and the faith and love which is which is for us in christ jesus he goes on that good thing that treasure that precious truth which was committed which was entrusted unto you keep it guard with the greatest care by the holy ghost which dwelleth in us us plural we're in this together we each have a role to play a service to perform a task to accomplish timothy hold fast hang on brother lyle you're reading a lot of scripture tonight yeah yeah because his are the words of life not mine i want you to see that this theme of holding fast not letting go clinging and persevering are traits that god encourages us to possess from job all the way to the end if we look in hebrews chapter 3 we find paul is contrasting jesus with moses keep in mind that the letter to the hebrews is a letter to jewish believers and within judaism the hero the main guy is moses he's the the prime human character in judaism he's the lawgiver he's the man whom god spoke lip to ear now it wasn't because moses needed hearing aids like like brother lyle wears sometimes he wasn't shouting in moses ear he was whispering he was speaking to him as a friend hey moses check this out moses would then share through aaron and through writing the torah i hope some time to bring you a message about how writing that was even possible but it's okay not not tonight let's read hebrews 3 chapter 1. these are jewish believers he's writing to wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider think about the apostle and high priest of our profession uh this is something they can relate to this is still the time of the second temple that hadn't yet been taken away they still had the high priest office the high priest of our profession is christ jesus recall earlier this evening we were told to hold fast to our profession here we see that jesus is the high priest of what our profession was faithful to him that appointed him as also moses was faithful in all his house he's making a comparison here for this man jesus was counted worthy of more glory more honor more respect than moses that's going to raise some eyebrows it is much as he who hath builded the house hath more honor than the house for every house is built by some man but he that built everything is god and moses certainly without a doubt verily absolutely was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were re-spoken after but christ as a son over his own house whose house are we if there's a condition we have to meet this condition if we're to be of this house if what we hold fast the confidence not wavering not doubting resting in assurance and the rejoicing of the hope the joy of the lord is our strength and philippians we're told what sorts of things to think on and to speak about if we hold fast the confidence and rejoicing of the hope firm don't relax that grip for how long eight hours a day sabbath sunday when we're in church unto the end as we prepare to close i'd like to read one last portion from hebrews here paul explains about jesus being our high priest earlier this evening we read from hebrews 10 23 let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he's faithful that promised so let's touch just a bit on that holding fast to our profession and christ's faithfulness and that regard hebrews chapter 4 verse 14 seeing then that we have a great high priest that has passed into the heavens jesus the son of god there it is again let us hold fast our profession hold firmly grip tightly our confession of our faith in him our acknowledgement of what we believe is true for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with a feeling of our infirmities in other words our high priest can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities he is not unable to understand so he's able to understand and can sympathize and have a shared feeling with our weaknesses and infirmities are liabilities to the assaults of temptation why because was it he was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin he was tempted in every respect as we are because he took on human nature he faced the same testings we face different technology same nature what's the only difference he didn't sin because of this then paul says let us therefore because he completely understands us this high priest can truly have empathy let us therefore come boldly confidently not hesitantly not in fear unto the throne remember who he is and who we are it's his throne it's not ours we're not he's not a tool in our toolbox i often say come boldly unto the throne of grace undeserved favor because of what jesus did for us no other reason that we may obtain mercy mercy jesus told us in the sermon on the mount that in order to obtain mercy we must be merciful to obtain forgiveness we must forgive that we may obtain mercy and find grace not necessarily to be found at the seat of judgment but while he is still on the throne of grace we can obtain grace why to what end to help in time of need we need help we can't do it ourselves we're in this together with him and with each other we depend on his mercy found in his throne of grace we must hold fast regardless of the onslaught of our enemy of our flesh as well as satan himself we need to not only hold fast but we need to hold each other up in prayer we need to provoke one another to love and to acts of kindness last time i was privileged to be before you i read a word to the church in it were cautioned to stick together to support our pastor to be kind to say only nice things about each other to close ranks when we see the enemy in our midst to pray for each other jesus said we'd be known by our love for each other not by miracles not by signs and wonders by our love if you walk through the doors right now if he came through those doors right now what do you say well done i see this love manifested in your midst we must be doers and we must hold fast to all the things that we've reviewed tonight hold fast i'd like to invite sister martha to return to the piano here as we close the service i'd like us to sing one more song together this song is called hold the fort now whenever i think of this song i can see my mind's eye brother roy borders leading us in worship at the original tabernacle on south stone he led us in this song quite often but there's a backstory to this song that i'd like to just share with you for a couple of minutes so you can understand who wrote this why did they write this the song was written in 1870. by a fellow named philip bliss during the civil war in october 1864 a strategic position at altoona pass was being held by general course of illinois now if you look at this map here you'll see that this is atlanta georgia and this red teardrop up here in the upper left for you is showing where this location was altoona pass the union garrison under his command was outnumbered they were surrounded and the confederate general french summoned the yankees to surrender course refused fierce fighting ensued course and his troops were forced back forced up to the crest of the hill the situation seemed hopeless until the union officer caught sight of a signal flag across the valley atop kennesaw mountain which is the big blue arrow there the signal was answered and soon the message was waved signal flags the message was wave from mountain to mountain what was the message hold the fort for i am coming wt sherman cheers went up and under murderous fire the position was held within three hours sherman's advanced guard had forced the confederates to retreat my siblings in christ we must always remember we're not alone we're in this together and not just together but together with jesus christ and not only that but we're part of a body that stretches across our planet
