somebody did that yesterday and I thought that's that's good I'm going to use that brother Glenn welcome times two we um Stephanie and I were in New Mexico ministering there I do appreciate having Brother Dan Brother Nathan there brother Joe Miller was there also thanks thanks to the the brethren for coming we had a we had a nice service before before service um Steph and I were in the hotel room and we prayed and then uh went to service on on Friday night and I spoke on something similar to what I'll be speaking on this morning um and then after service yesterday we were coming home we had another service yesterday and then we were coming home and stalking with my wife and we were just talking about the Lord and talking about the people and talking about the work that sets in front of us and and Stephanie told me she said you know she said what you prayed when she prayed before service she said You Prayed you said Lord help me to say something that'll help the people and she said you know she said you you could have prayed Lord help me to have a good sermon Lord you could you could have Stephanie said you could have prayed Lord let me draw an emotion out of the people you could have prayed Lord may I tie everything together well and may it may it provoke a response and Inspire the people but but you know you prayed Lord may I say something to help the people and I believe that is our role amen it's not to bring an eloquent sermon it's not it's not to be able to tie all the scriptures in together and and make it to where it makes sense and and to bring some new revelation it it may be that but it's all to help the people or else why would we even be here if it's not to help that's it's the desire of My Heart Lord just to help in any way that I can we've been going through the book of Acts during the week and and I I think that I'm I've been the Most Blessed of everybody to be able to go through this book and and I think the thing that has meant the most to me starting with chapter one and going all the way through half of chapter 19. the thing that has meant the most to me is that these were normal human beings in the book of Acts we we talk about we quote Peter and we quote Paul and and and and we we all the Miracles that have that have happened but these were normal people they were like us they had faults they had problems and then we see the enemy coming in and trying to divide the people in this book of Acts and here we see it so plainly today in our world it's there the enemy he's always trying to separate he's trying to separate this church from that church this church teaches this Doctrine and that church teaches this Doctrine and this Baptist Church just teaches that the Assembly of God teaches this the Pentecostal Church teaches this or this little independent church down the road teaches that separates separates separate there are scriptures in quotes about separating but most of them are the opposite most of them teach Unity among the people and unity among the among the the body of Christ and I see that so often that that we as we're coming to church and as we go to work or our normal days we see so many mistakes and we have such little patience for people that make mistakes and it's it's not right it's not what this book teaches we see that people they have problems all of us do and all of us fail and we should have more patience with each other in our failures and in the problems that we have think about Moses and how Moses said come on come on the scene at about 40 years old made a big mistake Moses got it in his mind that he was going he knew that he was supposed to deliver the people in some way so he got it in his mind he said what I'll do is I will kill this Egyptian here and then there will be a big Uprising among the people and we will militarily will take over this land of Egypt that are our slave masters Moses had it in his head he carried out killed this this man that was persecuting one of his people and it didn't work it failed miserably it was a mistake Moses was exiled out and even his own people said will you kill us Kill Me Like You Killed the Egyptian the other day Moses must have thought how did how did this happen it was a mistake so then he leave for 40 years he comes back and now he's the deliverer he takes the people out God sends ten plagues upon Egypt to our Pharaoh is just like get out of here you're you're this is destroying my country they go out God hardens his heart again he sends the Army out they get backed up against the Red Sea God sends an East Wind walls up the water on both sides and here comes millions of Hebrews walking across this ocean on dry land with the walls of water on either side to the to the other side and then here comes the task Masters in the army of Egypt and God brings down the water upon the entire Army I don't know of a greater miracle in this book than that so then they go over this great miracle and immediately they start complaining we're hungry Moses must have been frustrated we're hungry so so then God Rains Down manna down from heaven every day they didn't have water Moses goes up to this Cliff this cleft of this rock and he smacks it with his Rod water comes out gives water to all all of the people and all their livestock millions of people Miracle after miracle happened and then as they traveled they got thirsty again and they started complaining Numbers Chapter 20. verse 1. it says this then came the children of Israel even the whole congregation into the desert of Zen in the first month and the people Abode in kadish and Miriam died there and was buried there Miriam is Moses's sister and there was no water for the congregation and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and the people chode with Moses and spake saying would God that we had died when our Brethren died before the Lord and why have ye brought up the congregation of the Lord Into the Wilderness that we and our cattle should die there and wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt to bring us unto this evil place it is no place of seed or of figs or vines or pomegranates neither is there any water to drink and Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation and they fell upon their faces and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them and the Lord spake unto Moses saying listen closely take the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and Aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock Before Their Eyes remember the last time he took his rod and he smacked it he hit it and then the water came forth this time God says speak to the Rock you know it shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so Thou shalt give the congregation and their BEAST's drink and Moses took the rod from before the Lord as he had commanded him and Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation there before the Rock and he said unto them here now ye Rebels much must we fetch you water out of this rock Moses there's a lot of pressure on him his sister just died they all the people were complaining and all of this was all of these Miracles that had happened and Moses was upset number one because if you look at it they were questioning Moses's Authority and they were complaining against Moses and Moses was angry about it Moses saw what they were doing and Moses was coming in and he brought correction to these people again saying do we need to fetch you water out of this rock I think Moses right there he got out of the will of the Lord I think of so many times a minister might come to the pulpit and he has it in his mind something that he's going to say to the people because maybe he sees the people straying maybe he sees he sees some problems arise in the church and he comes and he says I'm going to lay the ax to the root of the tree I'm going to hit them with everything that that I've got and I look at myself and if you know me very well um ask my wife if you don't believe me but a lot of times I'm quick to to pull the sword sometimes sometimes I'm quick to jump out and get you and and I try and I I Repent many times but it's my personality it's the way that I am it's something that I have to overcome and there's been many times that I've come to this Pulpit over the past seven months and I've had my Bible and my scriptures here and I've been ready to say you're and then the Lord says you're going to do it and here's my notes here's my scripture open and then the thoughts yeah and then something says it's you it's not me and the same thing right here was Moses and he goes up and he rips them and that was not God God didn't tell him to do that he tells them to do it at other times but in this this spot right here he didn't say it and what happened was Moses got himself and number one they were questioning him he got a little personal there Moses comes up and he just rips them and it wasn't God it was a mistake from the sermon The Works that I do bear witness of me listen to this now notice Now 51 0413. now notice now Moses smote The Rock the second time representing that Christ should come to the Earth and to Earth and die again now he had power to bring forth water out of the Rock whether it was God's will or not did you know that everybody will admit that it wasn't God's will but Moses done it anyhow he had power God entrusted him to be a prophet he gave him those powers to do that and he found out that his servant failed him and he glorified himself instead of God and then what happened God dealt with Moses then didn't he not with the children with Moses the holy spirit is given to a man and gifts are given to a man but you have to watch what you're doing with those Divine gifts scripture comes to mind that gifts and callings are without repentance so God gives us those gifts how we use those gifts is up to us if you're a gifted singer like brother Matthew brother Matthew could use that gift to serve Satan brother Matthew could use that gift to deceive people brother Matthew could use that gift for the world and God won't take it away repentance is is just a turn back it's it's to bring it back and he doesn't do it he gives you a gift all of us have gifts he gives that to you and says here what are you going to do with it and that's exactly what happened here at the rock with Moses now that quote that I just read has to do with this next verse and Moses lifted up his hand and with his rod he smote The Rock twice and the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their beasts also now remember God told him to speak to the Rock he got himself worked up he got it in his mind here's how I'm going to do it I'm gonna I'm gonna tell them how it is and they're they're sinning against God and they're they're questioning me and Moses goes out there and he he rips the people he takes his staff he hits the rock nothing comes out he smacks it again out comes the water and water flows through millions of people drank from the rock that day and not only them but their livestock also drank a brother asked me a few days ago I was talking with him he's a um a deacon in a church in New Mexico he uh he asked me he says why did God honor Moses when he's when he struck that rock twice why did God honor that knowing that God that Moses was out of the will of God that's a good question think about it why would God honor that God honored it because his people were dying of thirst it was God's will that they would drink he didn't want him to die he wanted them to drink and that's why he sent Moses to to speak to this rock to bring the water out but God also had a long-term plan and Moses messed it up that long-term plan was that that rock was supposed to be smitten one time because that rock represented Jesus Christ he should die once for the sin of the people he should be smitten once for the sin of the people and Moses in his own thinking in his own anger he got he messed it up the whole symbolic the whole symbolism of the whole Rock in the wilderness it was a mistake by the prophet it's my job as a minister not to give you a history lesson but to bring that to this day so think about this Moses smote the rock water came forth God still blessed Moses's mistake we still drank so do you think Joshua and Caleb I don't know if they knew it Aaron Aaron knew it do you think do you think Aaron maybe said Moses you should have spoke to the Rock and not hit it with your Rod twice I'm not drinking he'd have died he'd have died of thirst it was God blessing the people God wanted his people to drink so he used his servant even in his error even in his mistake God still used his servant to bring forth water and the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron because ye believed me not verse number 12. because ye believed me not to sanctify me in the eyes of the children let me read that again because you believed me not to sanctify me me meaning God in the eyes of the children of Israel it's not about you Moses it's about me it's about the Jehovah God the one that actually brings these miracles you may be a prophet you may be a servant you may be an angel but let me tell you it's God that does it God is bringing these to sanctify me in the eyes of of Israel therefore you shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them he's talking about the Promised Land he's talking about that land over Jordan that he had promised to Abraham that he had reiterated to Joseph and on and here is the deliverer and he says oh you're not gonna go because you made this mistake you messed up my whole plan so Moses it's not about you you're not going but I'm going to bring him across but Moses the great man that he was how many of us would have thought about ourselves and said I'm done with it I'm finished if I'm not going to go over if I'm not going to get this promised land that God has promised I'm the deliverer I've worked so hard for this church I've done I've I've changed all this and I've worked my fingers to the Bone helping everything if I don't get to go I'm finished why do I even need it it's not about you Moses and Moses knew it wasn't about him he made a mistake and Moses knew it Moses kept working kept trying kept doing everything that he could and that rock that Moses smote don't forget the water still came forth and the the Lord blessed the people even in his mistakes water came from that rock think about other mistakes that have made that was a big one and what I want to do and I'm just telling you what I'm where I'm going in this I want us to think about our mistakes and all that we've done and it's okay there's some Whoppers that were made in the Bible by the greatest men that have ever lived this man Joseph when he was young his Brethren got jealous of him so they they go and he's Joseph's doing he's a young man and he's he's filled with the spirit and and he has these gifts and they get jealous because they don't have those those gifts and they're sick and tired of this kid telling them how to do things and then Joseph has this dream where he's exalted over them and they're like that's enough we are sick of this guy so they take him out away they take him they throw him in this pit as well we're finished with this guy done with them they take it they take his coat that his dad had given him and they put some blood on it from a goat they bring it back to his dad said he's dead he's lying got him here and it broke his dad's heart here he is in this pit his some of his brothers felt bad they ended up selling him into slavery he goes off a horrible mistake Joseph goes off for years he's gone God starts blessing this man he's in prison He blesses him in prison he's outside of prison He blesses him outside of prison then he exalts this man Joseph so high to he's the second ruler in the greatest country on Earth at that time Egypt Joseph was the man and then he has a he has a vision and and he's storing up food and they run out of food where these same ones that that threw him in the well and tried to kill him those same ones were their dad says hey go there's there's grain in Egypt go there they go there they come before Joseph they didn't recognize him he wasn't even speaking their language they didn't recognize him Joseph he knows exactly who they were Genesis chapter 45 let's read it verse 1. then Joseph could not refrain himself from all them that stood by him remember they didn't recognize who he was these are his brothers and he cried because there caused every and he cried he said this caused every man to go out from me and there stood no man with him while Joseph made himself known to his brethren these are the people that tried to kill him his own Brothers and he wept aloud and the Egyptians and the house of the Pharaoh heard and Joseph said unto his Brethren I am Joseph I bet you that was a scary moment for these for these brothers I am Joseph doth my father yet live and his Brethren could not answer him for they were troubled at his presence I bet they were they were probably thinking well how long is my heart going to continue to beat because this man might cause it to stop and Joseph said unto his Brethren come near to me I pray you and they came near and he said I am Joseph your brother whom you sold into Egypt now listen to this this great mistake that these men had made now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves wow be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that you sold me hither for God did send me before you to preserve life sorry there's a smudge in my God to preserve life for these two years hath the famine been in the land and yet there are five years in the which there should there shall neither be earring nor Harvest and God sent me before you to preserve you at posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great Deliverance so now it was not you that sent me hither but God in this mistake in this bad attitude that they had in this hatred that they had for their brother wanting to kill him Joseph says hey it wasn't you wow how many of our mistakes how many times have we felt so bad and it wasn't nearly as bad as what these guys did Joseph says it wasn't you but it was God and he hath made me a father to pharaoh and Lord of all his house in a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt these 12 these 11 other besides Benjamin say 10 others these became the Patriarchs of the Jewish race these were the fathers of all the Jews so much so that they were each one of them was so important that their lineage is recorded all the way down all the way down to to to David later all the way down to Jesus Lion of the tribe of Judah down to the man that we've been talking about in the book of Acts down to Paul from Benjamin that's how important that these men were and yet they made a mistake caused all these problems but yet God was in it I think about Paul I just mentioned Paul how many Christians now we go into the New Testament in the book of Acts how many Christians did this man Saul of Tarsus who became Paul how many Christians did he imprison how many Christians came to their end because of this man's Saul of Tarsus this evil man that was bent on destroying this Christian faith he stood there one of the one of the greatest people in the whole new church of Christianity was this man named Stephen a deacon and he came and he was preaching the gospel and Healing The Sick and doing all of these Miracles such a good man and here comes this mob just because he was preaching things that didn't line up with their Doctrine Here Comes This mob of Jews throws them out throw them outside the city and take up stones and start hitting that man with these Stones beating him in his head destroying him killing him and here is this young man Saul of Tarsus do it kill him how bad of a mistake from this man and Paul writes that must have really bothered him through the years it must have really bothered him how that he would consented to the deaths and imprisonment of men and women and probably children too because they were Christians what an evil man what an awful thing to do and he writes later on he writes to his Protege a man named Timothy Frank Christ Jesus our lord who hath enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious but I obtained Mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief and the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom I am chief so now you know why Paul could say that because of what he had done the mistakes that he made how be it for this cause I obtain Mercy that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering for a pattern to them which should Hereafter believe on him to life Everlasting so though I make my mistakes though I have done this and everybody knew who he was when he was writing this letter so even though I made mistakes and I've done this and I have sinned so much I am the chiefest of all the Sinners they probably said yeah he actually is yeah Paul Paul speaking the truth even even when he's condemning himself actually he is the chiefess of Sinners because he's done all of this but Paul says it's Jesus is showing a pattern for those who will believe on him no matter what you have done no matter what you mistake you have made the blood of Jesus Christ covers those mistakes and if he can save Paul this man that did all of these things is he not able to correct my mistakes and we worry so much about the mistakes that we have made Peter and along the same lines as Paul Peter was with Jesus for three and a half years was with him saw all the things that he did saw his personality knew him loved him And yet when it came right down to it this man Peter denied that he even knew Jesus Christ he said I don't know that guy he was afraid what a mistake Jesus said this must have been ringing in Peter's ears Jesus said he that denies me before men I will deny him before my father Jesus and Peter denied him three times in the same night Jesus prophesied he said before the crows before the rooster crows he said you'll deny me three times Peter said not me and then a few hours later I don't even know him I don't even know him and then the last time he started cussing he started swearing just so that they would see that this man is not associated with Christ so sometimes when we let those bad words come about out of our mouths that's what Peter did to say I'm not associated with Jesus so be careful and yet this Peter and all the bad things that he did this Peter Jesus said I give you the Keys of the Kingdom so much so that he was so filled with the holy spirit that that man at the gate called Beautiful he was asking for money there in the book of Acts and Peter and John came they didn't have any money Peter said hey I don't have any silver or gold I don't have anything to give you but what I have I give to you and what was better a bunch of money or was it better what he gave them he said this man of the gay called Beautiful had been crippled since his birth Peter said what I have I give to you rise up and walk in the spirit of the Lord came down and Rose that man up and he jumped up and down and he went and he was healed from that moment on the man that denied Jesus Christ three times in one night was embarrassed and how much more have we and how much less have we done and yet we let our mistakes bother us so much I want to I want to say something about something that's so special to me and he's special to you too and that's that's this man William Branham and someone that that stood up against the organizations of his day way back in the 40s and 50s and said no you do not have to be a member of a church or an organization to know God you don't have to do it you have to know him and they hated him for it brother Bram said this he said in life story brother Jeremy that first quote that you had up there and and in here I've made many mistakes done many things that was wrong and I'll desire that you and the radio land and you that are present that you will not take my mistakes to be stumbling stones but Stepping Stones to bring you closer to the Lord Jesus think about Moses's mistakes that I was just talking about now I understand thank you then Moses made this mistake that I can understand this this mistake that the Patriarchs made thank you this mistake these mistakes that Paul made that Peter made and made them human it made him real and thank God that they're recorded in this book because now it makes it to where I can relate to them and I see some there's been so many critics that they attack the ministry of this man and they look and they pick and choose little things and from here and there and they put them together all these so-called mistakes and right here he says let them not be stumbling stones they take them and because of the ministry because of what we have done to this great man's message over the years making it something making him something that he is not and he didn't want to be we have taken what he said what he did and we have made it into something that it was not and here comes the critics and it's just giving them fuel for their fire and it has done more damage to brother branham's message not these critics but the ones that have made it into something that is not and teeded up for the devil I hate it let me tell you I love that man's message I love what he stood for I love what he did and for these people to be able to attack it it is the fault of the pulpits over these past 30 40 50 60 years that have changed it and set it up to where people can come in and and make such a mockery of it that's why I always say if you want to hear Brother Brown's message listen to him on tape because he said it right and I love it it's part of my everyday life and it is absolutely beautiful quit trying to change it and so often I'm going off my notes and the Lord said okay he he said yes so often people take quotes and all they're doing is they're taking these quotes just to support their message that they want to preach and they're just using Brother Brown's message for their own good for their own doctrines and that is why there has been so many problems it's a shame think about let me say it again I love his message I stand for it he was a great man of God and I don't like what's happened to it maybe that's why he put me in this Pulpit I believe maybe it is it's wonderful don't come against that man and don't set him up for failure because he was not like that he did not teach these things that is so common in our churches today when you talk about him those the sword is going to come out think about David I think about David and Bathsheba what he did and how wrong David did he was he was out on his balcony and looks down and he sees this woman bathing looks down on her and the Flesh and David came out he was King you get out whatever he wanted in the world so he took this woman another man's wife awful awful sin took this man's this man's wife she became expecting had the man murdered this man Uriah a husband of that little that lady and and he um Prophet came to him and he tells the story about the lamb he says there was this this poor man that had this lamb and he loved this lamb and it was his only lamb and and he it was it was just everything to him and then this rich man comes in that has all of these herds and everything and he needs a sacrifice so he takes the man's lamb because he doesn't want to get he doesn't want to use any of his so he takes the man's lamb and he uses that David said I'll have that man killed David said you tell me who that is I'll take that man and he'll be killed and I'll restore this how dare he and and the prophet says David you are that man but God's not going to kill you for it David Uriah was dead there's all these problems the child that that was conceived ended up dying a horrible mistake Psalm 51 David was so heavy so sad he was repentive and that's the thing that we have so little of today is repentance we do things wrong the greatest hear David he did a horrible thing we do things wrong all of us but David repented listen to his words how he was feeling Psalm 51 he says he says have mercy upon me oh God according to thy loving-kindness according under the multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out my transgressions Wash Me thoroughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin adultery murder for I acknowledge my transgression and my sin is ever before me how many people won't acknowledge when they're wrong how many people won't admit that they're wrong and they say they'll do something bad and then they'll make an excuse and get in a big fight no they'll lash out when they when they commit a sin or they hurt someone else and you can't do anything with those people they can't see that they did something wrong and they won't make it right because they can't see that they did something wrong but that was not the prophet here the prophet King David that's an arrogant person that can't admit when they're wrong that's an arrogant person that doesn't repent now listen to this verse number four against thee speaking to God against thee the only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judges so when we sin against each other David killed had Uriah killed he committed adultery and then he says Lord I've just I've sinned against you when we sin against each other we are sinning against God he's more important than all of us we need to always be careful when we sin I'll say it again when we sin against each other we are sinning against God against thee and the only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judges behold I was shaping an iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me behold thou desire desire is truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part Thou shalt make me to know wisdom the Amplified version of that says this behold you desire truth in the innermost being and in the hidden part of my heart you make me no wisdom Purge me with hyssop and I shall be claimed clean wash me and I shall be wider than snow amen make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou Hast broken May Rejoice Lord you may have broken my bones you may have brought me to this but in that in my suffering in the the repercussions because of my sin I am going to rejoice I will find gladness hide thy face from my sins Lord don't see my sins and blot out all of my iniquities thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ that he can't see our sins created me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from my presence you can just sing it cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit then will I teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted under thee look at the repentance and David even in my own sins even in my mistakes I'm going to teach others I was heard a brother preacher the other day he was he was telling a story about another Minister he was up there and he was preaching and he offended some people in the church and this Minister this pastor went to these people and he apologized he said I'm I'm sorry I didn't mean to offend you and what I said and this other brother this other Pastor he says you were wrong in doing that he says you went and you apologized he says when do we need an apology from the word for the word false absolutely wrong no no no no no no that's an arrogant spirit that says something like that we don't apologize for the word of course we don't and if I say something that offends you today I don't mean to do it but I believe I've been speaking the word of the Lord and we can talk it out if I have deliver me from blood Guiltless Guiltless guiltiness that means the guilt of bloodshed Uriah deliver me from blood guiltiness oh God that thou God of myself thou God of my salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness so even in the guilt of everything that he done did he's still thanking the lord and he's able to get past it in his repentance friends I I see it in so many people we make mistakes we do things wrong get past it it's in the past you didn't do it as bad as David did oh Lord open now my lips and my mouth shall show forth thy praise for thou desirest not sacrifice else I would give it thou delightest not in burnt offering the sacrifice the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit a broken and contrite heart oh God thou will not despise the sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit when we repent Lord I'm sorry I feel so bad I want to make it right I've done all of these things in my past and I'm suffering for them today Lord I've made this mistake and that mistake I've I've messed up my life how can I come back from this David came back from it and if he could we can a man of great sin yet a man after God's Own Heart this man David I heard the other day it was we were out in the fellowship hall and I her brother Lionel and he was he was talking he was explaining to a brother what repentance means and it it really blessed me when he was saying it he was he was saying that that it means literally to go back and when you fall into the into sin you repent and you go back go back to that cross the Greek word for repent is metanoia the definition is this it denotes a change of mind as brother Lionel said a reorientation a fundamental transformation of Outlook of man's vision of the world and of himself a new way of living and loving God that's what that Greek word means to repent how beautiful the Jews they made the ultimate mistake when they crucified Jesus they're there and they said let his blood be upon us send him to the Cross they say crucify it pilate said what do you want me to do they say crucify him what a horrible awful mistake that they made yet as when Moses smote the rock water still came forward and that Water of Life came out of Jesus and it rested upon the Gentiles and here we are still blessed because of that great mistake that the Jews had made in Zechariah 12 in a prophecy Zechariah says and they shall look upon me whom may have pierced speaking of the Jews and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall weep bitterly for him as one that weeps over his firstborn so when they realized that they made this mistake how bad that they're going to feel but they will repent God Jesus you know he says they asked where do you get those scars he said in the house of my friends and these same people just like Joseph but God meant it for the good so that many others will be blessed so that water would come forth out of that rock and that word repentance that I was talking about how important it is for all of us and we don't we don't just not look at our faults we don't just just go by and not admit them but repentance is to go back as I said and have a new outlook on life there was a there was a time in Acts chapter 2 that this Holy Spirit had fallen they went out and they were preaching the gospel and they were Healing The Sick and there was just such Joy it was such an exciting time and and and all of these these Miracles were happening and and there was just such a stir and these people they look at Peter and James and John and all of them they said hey wow how do we get that Peter said these great words therefore he preaches a sermon and he says therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made the same Jesus whom you crucified as I just said both Lord and Christ Acts chapter 2 verse 36. now when they had heard this they were pricked in their hearts they were cut in their hearts and said unto Peter and unto the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent repent it's the first thing brother Lyle did a wonderful job on Wednesday night he was talking about Acts chapter 19 and he was talking about baptism and and and Paul had come to this group that had listened to John the Baptist and they had learned from John the Baptist and they came to the waters and they were baptized by John the Baptist unto repentance the law was telling us that the old Customs were that when you needed to be cleansed part of it was you dip in the water and you come back up and it symbolizes being cleansed from your from your filthiness so John the Baptist is out there baptizing they would come to John they were saying I feel bad I've done wrong John baptized them so then these people Ephesus right these people in Ephesus were saying we we've repented we've done this and this man has taught us about these things and we believe John the Baptist and Paul says yeah but there's more they said have he said have you received the Holy Spirit since you've believed and you know what they said what do you mean what's the Holy Spirit we haven't learned about this yet how do we receive it Paul asked him how are you baptized and they were like well we were baptized with John he said no no it's not good enough there has to be a name associated with that baptism and that's why we are baptized in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ there has to be a name associated repentance first than baptism than an infilling of the Holy Spirit that's how it usually happens so look at the mistakes of Moses Moses goes up there and he gets he gets himself all worked up and he's gonna lay the ax to the root of the tree as it says in the Bible from John the Baptist and he goes up and he rips him and he says you're a bunch of weasels basically that wasn't me Moses Moses Moses smote the rock big mistake but water came out and we drank and we look at the Patriarchs we see their mistakes trying to kill their own brother and yet God used it to save an entire country we look at the mistakes of Peter but Jesus gave him the Keys of the Kingdom we looked at the mistakes of Paul but God gave him a revelation beyond anything that had ever struck the Earth and he led countless people to Christ and we still read what that man wrote look at the mistakes of David yeah Christ was called the son of David so friends as the musicians come and we'll close what mistakes have you made or have I made that keep coming back in our minds and I know with me I that's something I struggle with is when I mess up boy it's hard for me to get over it but what mistakes have you made and you feel that you've you've shamed yourself or you've embarrassed yourself you've done something wrong what mistakes have you made that can compare to these people that I just read about and yet these are the greatest men that have ever walked the Earth our mistakes can't compare yet the enemy the devil just keeps throwing them in our mind but remember if there's no mistakes then there is no thirst for salvation God can take our mistakes if there's a tender heart and a willingness to repent like he did with these brothers God can take our mistakes and make it a blessing to everyone a blessing to the people the Bible teaches us to confess our faults one to another pray one for another and I believe that it was on my heart today to tell you all you make mistakes as you know most of you know it you make mistakes don't worry about it their mistakes those mistakes can be stepping stones as they were with all of these others those mistakes help other people so never ever condemn someone else of a mistake you make them too Jesus said in the most probably the most besides John 3 16 the most famous thing Jesus ever said when they said the disciples said teach us how to pray he says forgiveness of our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us doesn't say require them that they say sorry you just forgive them no matter what they do and repent of our mistakes I talked about baptism I talked about how important a baptism is and how baptism needs to be first has to come from repentance Lord I've done wrong I want to I want to come back and then you're baptized and there's a promise there we have been told sister Hattie are you still good you still want to be baptized God bless you if you could if you could make yourself ready and go back whoever whichever sister usually go yeah sister um Sister Sarah there too brother Dan do you want to go up there also or do you want to stay here you're welcome wherever you are wherever you want to be if there's anyone else that would have a desire to be baptized that would see that their needs Lord I'm sorry I've done things wrong now I want to make things right I want to come back I want to come back I want to I want to make a change in my life and this is what I'm going to do Lord this is what I'm going to do for you I'm going to be baptized if there's anyone else that would have a desire to be baptized it would be a good time right now God bless you all friends I'll I'll go up and make ready but Aaron will be speaking tonight Stephanie and Daniel and I we're going to head up to the mountains I want to I want to get away I want to relax and because there's decisions that we have to make number one immediately with the camp
