he's the same yesterday today and forever amen you may be seated we have some requests some prayer requests too you bring your attention and just a few things here my daughter Elizabeth had asked to be remembered in prayer after the two extractions and she went through the prayer line and began to heal but he felt like she got a cold so she's struggling breathing and all and Aston and then the Vogel family um I got a text from Brother Renee yesterday Brother Gary had been on life support and the family chose to to disconnect him yesterday so sometime yesterday afternoon Brother Gary passed away passed over to the other side so we're remembering the Vogel family and bro I was talking with brother Dan here and I just brought back to memory the Vogel family had been here many years ago and then they they had gone and brother Renee and sister Trish they were they were she was pregnant with the child and the possibility of losing that child and Trish told Renee said he used to go to a church that believes in prayer and healing and they came to be prayed for I didn't know that Renee had been raised right down the street his mother lived there I didn't know that at the time from us but that's brought the Vogel family back to serving the lord so until Brother Gary has gone on so they really asked us to remember them in prayer and a text from Brother Peter this morning and they are in Connecticut with brother Craig brewer today so hoping to be in Boston tomorrow but if they've had a good journey and I asked the brother Al Peterson and them and brother Arnie I'm sorry yesterday was a memorial family had the memorial for brother Al and I just want to pay my respects back to to brother Al and the Peterson Family I asked brother Dan I asked the family that I'd be okay this morning I was just a young man had just started attending the Tabernacle my early 30s where the hell Peterson asked myself and brother Jerry McFadden to help just greeting the people and ushering and and we did that and then about six months later brother Jerry asked Brother Ali said could I go back and sit down and help Mama with the children and brother Al said you do that brother Jerry so I said brother Al I have more children than he does so maybe I should go help and brother Al said no brother and you stay back here with me and he mentored me I saw a living example of a Christian I saw how he treated people I saw how he acted I saw him be human and then say hey I'm not perfect didn't make excuses for it but just be a good Christian and it wasn't too long of after that that I asked brother Jerry I said I feel like I took your place you've been here longer you've even ministered and brother Jerry said I had a dream yesterday and I was asking brother bran I'm in the dream what should I do and brother brother Brown told me he said brother Jerry you don't speak Spanish and right after that the group of Spanish people came that would sit up and we would and I helped all of them so there were just things that happened and brother brother Al just was such an encouragement such a brother just just just thinking and I just wanted to pay tribute to that and you can see it in his family Christians that love the Lord that are willing to put their shoulder and so he's gone on to the other side and I pray God not too long we'll all be going home but I just wanted to to honor that if you haven't eat I know our sister Amelia said she's having some some problems with with her foot she said it seems like it wants to burst out of the the strap that she's wearing I said well

under the blood they're under the blood you say how simple is that is just confess it there's not a lot of work to do with it there's not a you got to do so much of this and so much of that but no Lord I'm sorry I'm sorry and he says it's as good as done I appreciate that amen we love him for that today so brother Dan Evans is ministering this morning so you have a you have a spiritual need this morning you know sometimes we just have to say Lord you know what that need is could be as simple as I want to draw closer to you or maybe I got a question about something Lord why or or maybe I I've even heard people say Lord I just don't understand this what what's brother Brandon trying to say what was it and God can answer that question too and when he answers it there's no more question about it and that's say Lord speak to me or administer to my heart it's just amazing how personal they can get with us so let's stand there now foreign do you love him and I don't know you know husband and wife sometimes my well my wife will ask me do you love me and I know she doesn't mean it like she's questioning me she just wants to hear it again and I think sometimes he just wants to

us as he talked with us by the way in Jesus name we prayed amen sisters stay just a moment let's turn in our Bibles to First Peter chapter 2. [Music] I was returning I want to speak this morning on the importance of setting an example [Music] start with verse 11. it says you're dearly beloved I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts with war against the soul how having your conversation honest among the Gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evildoers they may buy your good works which they Shall Behold glorify God in the day of visitation submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake whether it be to the king as supreme or unto Governors as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them that do well for so is the will of God that with well-doing you may put to silence ignorance of foolish men as free and not using your Liberty for a cloak of maliciousness but as the Servants of God honor all men love the Brotherhood fear God and honor the king God bless you you can be seated may the Lord add the blessings to the reading of his word thank you um as I said title of my sermon is the importance of setting an example and speaking of an example brother Aaron mentioned this morning about brother Al Peterson a man of God passed away this week and brother I was a wonderful man he was he was precious brother uh Ed told me we were on the phone the other day and he said he was the best Deacon he had ever seen and um appreciate his legacy in in the Peterson family and all that they do for all of us and their their all will always willing to serve the body and all that they do I think that it's just it's a blessing to have known brother Al one time I was I was jogging when Stephanie and I got married we were living over by Sabino Canyon it was out running one time and this thunderstorm came out of nowhere and I was and it just started thundering and lightning and just pouring and This SUV as I was running I was a long way from home and This SUV pulls up in front of me and the door flies open and I jumped in and it was brother Al right and he said come on in it in I uh I'll never forget that and that's how it was that's that he was just he was a wonderful man of God um and precious to to so many of us um I'll uh on the calendar for the next few for the next few weeks I've been populating the calendar on the website the tucsontabernacle.com make sure you go on there and so you can see what's going to be happening we'll have our normal service tonight and we'll have a service on Wednesday next weekend um I'll be speaking on Sunday morning and then I was praying about and I feel to invite a young brother that some of you may know his name's Josiah aho he's he sang in harmony he's a wonderful singer he's going to be in town with with his new wife Katie Robson everybody knows brother Joe Robinson family he's going to be here next Sunday night and I felt to have him speak then then I am going to leave town for a few days during the following week just Monday through Friday so I have to leave the country for work and then brother Lyle will Minister not this Wednesday but the following Wednesday then this Saturday we have a meeting we're gonna have a potluck we're gonna get everybody together and we're going to talk about some of the things um that the church has to some decisions that we have to make I want to I want to feel I want to get a feeling how you are thinking for Sunday school and uh some other things like um some of the displays out there I've heard I've heard some comments about that um and uh just some different things I think it'd be a nice time of Fellowship and I'd like to hear what you all have to say I asked the church on Wednesday night to pray about those things and um so come pray it up and ready to have a good conversation about some of the directions that we're going to move as a church um I uh Daniel yesterday went to a I went to a basketball game my brother-in-law David he's got season tickets and he he couldn't go so um he asked me if I wanted him so I gave him to Daniel and he he went to this game and it was a big game it was the the two top teams in the Pac-12 and and everything was a big big hype and and you know the place was just packed and and there's he's sitting next to this old man who doesn't miss a game he hasn't missed a game for probably decades and he just loves U of A basketball and he was there and he recognized Daniel he'd seen Daniel before he recognized him and and and he's just so excited and he's just feeling so good and and the the crowds just going and the team's winning and he's just so happy and he tells Daniel he says he says everybody's here he's and he was just he was so happy and then the game came right down to the end and U of A one and the old man was just on top of the world and he just gives Daniel a big hug and I was thinking that's that man's Church he's so happy to see the fellowship and he was just he was so excited to see his team win and as Daniel's telling me the story I'm I'm thinking wow that's what he has that's his Joy and and I I thought about what if what if that old man what if he had what we have how he was so happy that this ridiculous ball game which it's like oh that's good you know it's nice it's It's Entertainment or whatever but he's he's happy that his team won what if he knew that our team won not only our team but our champion has won that battle and we can have whatever we have need of imagine if he just found out that he was healed or imagine if you just found out that the Lord Jesus died for his sins you talk about standing up and cheering that's how we should be and it's not about you know the ball game is fine I have nothing against that but it's it's a type of this real thing and I think sometime I'd like to witness to this old guy Daniel and talk to him and say you know we've got a church and we are happy not because that this team won but because we know the end and this battle will soon be over the greatest battle in history and we are going to be Victors through the blood of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so welcome to our visitors God bless you my brothers from New York here um brother Amos I've never met you God bless you my name is Peterson I saw you up praying God bless you it's it's uh like I said you came coming from a wonderful Legacy it's it's good to see you and brother Enoch where are you at raise your hand there he is and the new little wife God bless you we all gave you a hand before welcome we have uh some other visitors that I that I don't recognize God bless you all and thanks for coming I pray that that you can that this one this Gathering that this is the real thing and it's not a ball game it doesn't matter who's ranked what or whatever there is one person that died for our sins and we are here to promote him I heard we had some we had last weekend was really I think it was really a special service we've had some I think we've had actually we've had a special week um the the prayer service that we had on Wednesday really encouraged me and the Lord really answered some of my questions and I I gave a little testimony after the service of that but uh let me read a testimony this one was from Sister Elizabeth Garrett brother Aaron's daughter our brother and his daughter um sister-in-law it says here good morning Saints I just wanted to give a testimony of God's healing power last Sunday in the prayer line I asked brother Aaron to anoint me with oil he anointed me but instead of praying for me he said to thank God for my healing I felt the Lord touch me I had some I had suffered from stomach issues since last November then the next morning I woke up completely healed may all the glory and honor be to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen then uh my little bride here had a testimony too from Wednesday night and she was she opened up her Bible to Psalm 37 4. and it says this it says Delight thyself also in the Lord and He Shall give Thee the desires of thine heart so Stephanie was looking at that scripture and and like we should we shouldn't just read over a scripture and not understand it we should get the meaning behind it and she said Lord how do I Delight myself in the Lord what does that mean to really Delight myself in the Lord so she looked at her Bible and there was a there was a note in the margin and it said Isaiah 58 14. and so she went to Isaiah 58 14 and and she actually went back to 58 13 and she started reading and it reads like this if thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath which more Modern English it says if you keep your feet from breaking the Sabbath from doing thy pleasure on my holy day and call the Sabbath a delight the holy of the Lord honorable and shall honor him not doing thine own ways nor finding thine own pleasure nor speaking thine own words he's talking about honoring the Sabbath I think he's talking about going to church here and if you're not thinking about doing your own thing on Sunday going going over here going doing going shopping or watching the ball games or doing this or that but if you honor this and you go into the house of the Lord then Thou shalt Delight thyself in the Lord and I will cause thee to write upon the high places of the earth and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it and and Stephanie was all excited after our Wednesday night service and she said honey she said and she gave me that testimony she said it's really he's talking about going to church and it Delights the Lord that we would make a sacrifice and not do our own things on this special day but we would come into the house of the Lord it Delights him and then we will receive the benefits from it so I was given merely that testimony last night my mother-in-law I was telling her I was telling her all this that that Stephanie had said and merely is writing a she's writing a card to one of her grandkids a birthday card and she says Dan look at this and on the birthday card it was Psalm 37 4. Delight thyself also in the Lord and He Shall give Thee the desires of thy heart amen so a little bit of confirmation God's timing is perfect a little bit of confirmation that hey if you delight yourself in the Lord in these things of God then he will return those blessings brother Lyle you have a you have a testimony also right do you want uh do you want to come up you want me to bring your microphone down why don't you why don't you come up good morning you know Psalms 105 6. says let everything that hath breath praise the Lord amen praise ye the Lord I turn in a prayer request Wednesday evening starting off with that Psalm the last couple of months I've had a an issue where I have shortness of breath and I get easily fatigued I I never used to take naps in the daytime but starting a couple of months ago I I got something that I call s-o-n-s the Suns it means sudden onset napping syndrome that's that's just one that I made up but but I've I've had this issue of just doing not much and feeling really fatigued afterwards well I I was at the cardiologist and of course the cardiologist sees everything to the lens of the heart so on Friday morning I went in for uh to to see I told the nurse show that I'm here to see nurse Angie and she looked at me and I said the Irish nurse angiogram and it took her a while to understand that I meant I was there for an angiogram but so anyway so I went into this procedure and and the car cardiologist is the same one that had done a procedure on me four years ago almost exactly it was an early 2019 and had noted a few things in my heart this and that well they went in they didn't find any problem with my heart I want to say that again they didn't find any problem in fact he said that when he went in that everything looked exactly as it had four years ago now if you know anything about coronary artery disease and all that it's a progressive disease they they put in stents they do things and then a few years later they go in and things a little more clogged and they put in some more stents and and then after a while then they get out their skill saw and they start doing bypass surgeries because it's a chronic ongoing thing my brother-in-law is a physician and he was telling me the same thing well when they go in there you know they're going to find this and they're going to find out no they didn't find that because God healed my heart I gave that testimony in April of 2018 where I I'd had the heart attack in uh in November of uh 2017 Thanksgiving week and and I was running at 62 percent of a heart after that and then one Wednesday night here the Lord touched me and and as I've said many times people don't want to sit too close to me anymore not because I sing and I don't run out of breath so they have to listen to me and they want to move a little further back but but the the the real Point here the real testimony isn't isn't about fatigue and stuff we're still trying to figure out what's causing all that but the testimony is that the Lord healed my heart he doesn't do a halfway job he healed it it still healed there's still nothing wrong with my heart it's exactly the same as it was four years ago there's nothing wrong with my coronary arteries they're exactly as they were four years ago God is faithful we just have to trust the Lord and that's my testimony God bless you thank you very much [Applause] that ain't the Arizona Wildcats that's the real deal the Lord Jesus is alive today we had prayer on Wednesday night for brother Lyle Island and I I was given a testimony about her brother I was so tired he was he was fatigued but he was the one that knew how to put up this tent back here for Harmony and he didn't complain he just went out there and I was noticing he was his shoulders were a little slumped and and I asked him and and he told me that he was struggling with what he was struggling with and uh and then we had prayer Wednesday night with a while and thank the Lord you know we serve a god that says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen has anybody else have any testimonies about about Sunday on the prayer line or Wednesday the the um the prayer service that we had I know of her I'll bring you a microphone how's that sound Amos come here could you could you run this back for me thank you my brother all the way to the back back there maybe future deacons here maybe even ministers thank you brother Amos stay there I'm gonna need that back so Sunday when we had the prayer line I I well I don't really have anything I want prayer for I mean pressing but then I thought I'm going to go up and support the church I'm going to pray for continued unity and love that's going to be my request so I did that and held out on my heart but as I got to the closer to the light I had been for weeks now waking every up every morning around between 5 5 30 with a really nervous stomach just horribly nervous to wear I just didn't know what to do you just get so just awful anyway as I got closer I just put my hand over my stomach and I just held it there I didn't ask the Lord didn't say anything and then my dad anointed me with oil and I went through the line held my hand over my stomach without thinking about it and the next morning I woke up and I woke up past the time I'd been waking up every morning for several weeks and I looked over at Stephen and I said it's gone amen I don't have any more nervous stomach and I've been sleeping in every morning past that time without that horrible feeling it's completely gone amen thank the Lord I see any more hands about this week right here we have two good uh sister Naomi first and then come over to Sister Amelia well mine isn't necessarily about Sunday or Wednesday but I had told myself that if they asked for any Praises I would give it thank you so I work at Pima college at the west campus and Thursday was the first day of school for the semester and we had an incident where the school had to go on lockdown for about half an hour so um we shut down the bookstore because that's where I work and we brought everybody that was in there the employees as well as um any students to the very back room um it's mostly secure they have we have a really high window like we do here in the church and um I was fine these incidents thankfully never turn into anything serious but one of the ladies that we brought back there was very very nervous and she was trying to find the corners trying to hide and stuff so I told her okay this will be the best place for you to hide and I positioned her directly underneath the window and that morning when I was getting my lunch ready I grabbed four bags of chips they're just small little leaves different flavors and one of the flavors that was available it's actually um Smart Food popcorn and I don't care for it but I just like I'm just gonna take it anyway if I get really desperate and hungry I'll eat it so while we're locked in the back room this lady asked does anybody have any popcorn and I look at her and like what kind of popcorn thinking she meant like microwavable popcorn it's just like you know like the pre-popped kind the kind that's already made and I was like oh I I do actually he's like you do yes I do so I bring it out and I give it to her and it helped her calm down and she ate it and stuff I pass out the rest of my chips but it didn't hit me until I was going home that night that that is why I took the popcorn amen because the Lord already knew amen he's the god of the big things he's the god of the little things too praise the Lord bless you Sister Amelia I had a few oops sorry I had a few uh prayer requests on my mind when I went to the line and uh towards the end there was Brothers there that I really didn't know towards the end of the line um uh this brother um I don't think I knew him he started praying for me for asking um he said uh prayers for this mother for the Salvation of her sons and daughters and grandchildren I said how does his brother he doesn't know me and I I thought well maybe maybe brother it was brother Lyle because he was right close to him and uh so I mentioned it to him and he said you know of course he just said no they have a children and grandchildren and but uh that's what the brother prayed for and that was one of my prayer requests and that's my prayer uh prayer to God every day and so I was really really blessed with that prayer amen there was a sister one time that she had that same prayer brother Branham was as you know he was squirrel hunting and this little lady named Hattie Wright she said the right thing and then brother Branham said ask anything what you said please the Lord ask anything and it'll be given to you and she said I'd like to have the salvation of my two boys and that is when the spirit of the Lord came down and brother Brown liking that to the third pole powerful powerful situation sister Amelia the same thing we can't ask for anything greater than that God bless you all that's the um like I said this past week was was special special to me I am all of this you know if we we Delight ourselves in the Lord then he will he will meet these needs and we set an example for the world like this old man that was at that ball game he was so excited he was so happy because these people that he liked to be around were there and and the team won and just I guess you can't say it praising the Lord but just up and shouting and jumping and it's like Lord but there's a real there is a real church here there is something that our healing can come like brother Lyle our Salvation can come our even little things sister Naomi that the Lord just tells us I'm with you you know these little love letters you know with sister Elizabeth and her healing of her stomach and and um the the different things that happen God you're with us and we want to worship you and we want to cheer for you Lord Jesus because you are great you are the champion this isn't a three-pointer or a slam dunk this is the end of ends this is this is the Alpha and the Omega so in my sermon today I want to talk about like I said the importance of setting example and I want to take my text from second chronicles as we read in Peter about how important that these examples are but in second chronicles we see the influence of a man that is dear to my heart and he's a man that you've probably never heard of he was a priest and he lived in the time just after Ahab came and he had a very special wife also and this man's name was jehoiada and he had a very special family and he was a great influence on all of the tribe of Judah and God blessed that whole Kingdom just because of this one man he wasn't the prophet he wasn't even I don't even know if he was a high priest he was a good man that God had his hand on and I think all of us can relate to this man and I don't know if I'll get all the way I have two sermons today so I can pick it up tonight if I don't get all the way to the jehoiah and his ministry but I want to lay a foundation of what was happening at that time now we we read in Chronicles and Kings these two books they tell basically the same stories they just have different authors it's kind of like Matthew Mark Luke and John they're different perspectives on the same things that have happened now we start with this King Saul who was the first king of Israel and then we go to David and then we go to Solomon and the those three kings we have a united front in Israel we have these 12 tribes and they're all together but what happened after Solomon died was sin entered into this Israel and it split into two different countries one country was called Judah and that's where Jerusalem was and that had two tribes that had Judah and it had Benjamin and then the other tribe the other country was Israel the capital of Israel was Samaria and that had the other ten tribes so so we have these two sometimes they got along sometimes they didn't and as time went on um there came Kings throughout history and if you look you see Judah and you see Israel going side by side Judah had some good Kings Judah had like ASA and Jehoshaphat and and Hezekiah they had some good ones they had a lot of bad ones Israel never had a good King after Solomon died there was never a good king after that so whenever you see when you're looking at the Kings and you say I wonder if he was Judah or Israel if he was good he was never Israel it was Judah so these we see that the lineage coming down and we see that this man named Ahab came on the scene a very evil man and and this is in Israel Ahab married someone that was outside of his faith and that was this woman named Jezebel we all know who these people were they um and then as Ahab and Jezebel are governing over here in Israel then there was a righteous King named Judah that was governing I'm sorry named Jehoshaphat that was governing over in Judah good man prayed when he made decisions and so they were they were running side by side and they interacted and jehoshaphat's son when Jehoshaphat died his son took over and this man's name was jehorah and he was he became the king of Judah he married Ahab and Jezebel's daughter Wicked woman named athaliah so they uh they were they were together and we we see that durum johoram let's let's go ahead and read it let's go to um II Chronicles chapter 21. we'll start with verse four now when joram was risen up to the kingdom of his father he strengthened himself and slew all his Brethren with the sword and divers also of the princes of Israel johoram was 30 and 2 years old when he began to Reign and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem and he walked in the ways of the Kings of Israel now remember he was king of Judah and he walked in the way of the Kings of Israel like as did the house of Ahab for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife and he wrote that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord look at the influence that his wife had on him this woman athaliah Jerome's dad as I said was a good man and righteous but this woman comes in and she loved the things of the world she took after her mama Jezebel she was a murderer as you know and it goes to show this man johoram probably wasn't a very strong man in his faith it goes to show how important it is who we marry and what spouse we choose whether whether we be a young lady and we're choosing a husband or a young man and we're choosing a wife because this influence that we have on us it could completely ruin our lives it could end up in divorce it could end up in in just complete misery or for some of us it could just end up in joy end up that we have this soul mate that God gave us this person to share our life with us and to and to give us strength also but joram jehoram he never served the Lord let's go to verse 11. moreover he made the high places in the mountains of Juna Judah and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication and compelled Judah there too so we see jehoram he builds these idols and what he does is he encourages this immorality among the people in his country he encourages these and it sounds bad but it's not preached enough he encourages marital relations before marriage and we see that in the world today we see it we see it everywhere that it's it's encouraging this immorality among our young people and they're not told they're not taught against it it used to be in the schools that they would teach against it now they teach for it they encourage this in in with our youth in in their schools and where they they go to learn and this was this johoram he encouraged this type of thing in his country and it ended up ruining Judah he uh if let me say a little bit about the Bible here when we see the word fornication it generally means marital relations before you're married when we see the word adultery it means those same relations with someone other than your spouse so that's the difference between fornication and adultery and johoram encouraged these things and he encourage sin in his country aside from what his righteous father taught the taught the people he encouraged this sin so Elijah's a prophet he's still on the scene when we see jehoram here and he writes him a letter and he basically says you're a creep don't try to search creep in your Bible I probably won't find that part but he does and Elijah lays the ax here to the root of the tree and he says you've made Judah to walk in the ways of Israel not the ways of Your Righteous father Jehoshaphat or Your Righteous Grandpa this other guy named ASA this other king another good man and he killed when when he took the when he took the kingdom this man johoram ends up killing all of the other seed so he wouldn't have any competition and Elijah calls him out he said he says you taught Judah to fall into the traps of the world like Israel did you have killed your brethren and he said because of this I'm going to bring sickness God's going to bring sickness onto the land and you're going to die of that sickness too so johar did as the prophet said johoram got sick and he died he died a terrible death and the the in fact the leaders of Jerusalem saw what a bad man this was and they wouldn't even bury him with the Kings his fathers they buried him in a place that was set aside because he was not even worthy to be in the same ground as they were we go to Second Chronicles 22 and let's read let's let's start with verse 1. and the inhabitants now now he and this woman athalia now johoram's dead he dies he dies from this disease and his wife this daughter of Jezebel and Ahab is still there and the inhabitants of Jerusalem made a hazia his youngest son King in his Stead for the band of men came with the Arabians to the camp and had slain all the eldest so ahasia the son of johoram King of Judah reigned 40 and two years was ahasia when he began to Reign and he reigned one year in Jerusalem and his mother's name also was athaliah the daughter of Omri now it's sometimes when the Bible talks when it says a daughter or a son it's not talking about the direct descendant it's talking about a descendant like Jesus the son of David and that's that's why it doesn't actually disagree with each other it actually lines up perfect he also walked in the ways of the House of Ahab for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly wherefore he did evil on the sight of the Lord like the house of Ahab for they were his counselors after the death of his father to his destruction and remember I'm talking about here setting a good example and how important it is and how important these examples are his example was his mom and his dad and he learned these these behaviors he learned that from watching his parents one time I was I was praying and I was I read I read a scripture um and I believe it was in Deuteronomy and it said something to the effect of I will visit the sins of the parents upon the children and I didn't understand that and remember when we're reading our Bible friends don't just read over it and go to the next verse if there's something that you don't understand there it's very important I believe the Lord would want us to understand even if it's just one sentence more than reading in a whole chapter and not understanding what we read so pause on those things that you don't understand and I was I was reading that and I said Lord I know that later on it says that that it was unlawful to punish the children for the crimes of the parents but here it says that I will visit the sins or the iniquities of the parents upon the children I didn't understand that and I was on my knees and I was praying and I said Lord it doesn't seem fair and I know there's many things in the Bible it's not us to decide what's fair and what's not God is just but I was reading and I said Lord I don't understand it doesn't seem fair maybe I don't understand this how can the sins how can I suffer how can I be punished for something that my mom or my dad did I was praying about it and I feel like I spoke about hearing God's voice a couple weeks ago and I feel felt that still Small Voice speak to me and it said this it said because they are taught that way oh so we're not being punished for something our parents did we learn that behavior and then we go and we do the same behavior because that's how we've grown up that's that's what we've learned how to do and then we commit the same sin and then yes we will be punished for that same sin and I look at this this ahasia and look at the example that he learned from with athaliah this Wicked Woman and johoram this weak Wicked Man and how they taught all of Judah to sin both sexual immorality and murder and all the things that and bring in these idols and all of that and he learned this young man and then he went and he started doing the same thing and I'm thinking as parents as we are raising our children we need to teach our children the things that are written in this book show them where these things are teach them why we believe the way that we do now look at I look at hazia growing up and listening to his parents talk and the type of conversation that they had and I think of myself as I go back as a child something that we always did is we always had supper together you may think that that's not important but it is getting that family together eating a meal talking about the Lord giving testimonies about about what's happened during the day or about things of old I remember growing up and sitting and listening to Mom and Dad and they were talking about all of they would talk about the word and they were talking about testimonies they were talking about miracles and how good God was and it Formed my character raise up a child child right and then these things will come back I may have strayed I may have done things that were wrong and I did but I had a foundation built within me and that Foundation brought me right back to this word and I look at my family now and I'm looking my my two brothers are serving the lord my sisters serving the lord all of them have Ministries and I've talked about like I've talked about my brother Adam and and the the Ministry we started in Jeffersonville with all of the with all of the um inner city youth these these mostly black kids that come out of Central Louisville and and just having a terrible life and one thing that they all have in common almost all of them they don't have a dad the world has taken the father out of the family and it's basically it's a demasculinization of the American man he is no longer the head of his house that is shunned by the world and sometimes I think it's shunned in our churches instead of having the amen the the dad who is the head of the house now remember First Corinthians chapter 11 says that that the man is the head of the woman Christ is the head of the man so tell me how righteous is Christ compared to you and me he is the head he is the more righteous so the the dad how much more righteous how much more holy how much better should the dad live than those that are in the family but do we follow that are the men in our family are they stepping to the plate are they living a life that is worthy of this gospel are we as dads are we putting this before our children all the time we need to a dad needs to be the head of the house and I see so often that we get stuck in what's called legalism especially in our ranks of people so we want a book of rules we want to say that a Scourge should be this long a hair should be this long and and the pain should be this and and the men should wear dad pants and white tennis shoes I like Dad pants you know they're fine but then we start becoming all the same but the dad needs to be able to make these decisions and it shouldn't have to always it shouldn't have to come from this pulpit the man is the head of the family and instead of having a book of rules we should have holy spirit filled fathers making these decisions as I said the other night brother but Aaron you don't want me telling your wife or your daughter how to live it's not the job here we should present this as I am now but we as men should step to the plate and that is what this man of hazia didn't have he did not have that leadership in his life of this of a Godly father and I I think about with us and trying to raise my children right and and and Daniel having our devotions at night like we did every night putting this message before my children all the time trying to live it in front of them Daniel used to wake up with me at 4 30 every morning when he was a kid when he's he's still a kid when he was this kid like this big study the Bible with me as a little boy and he'd walk he'd walk in there I'd be sitting there I'd have my Bible open Daniel would walk in he was so sweet he his little guy bring me a blanket and then he'd go sit down on on the couch and I'd be studying and he would you know but he was trying and he built something inside of him now there's a Time when Our Youth and us when we will be presented with questions on what we believe we've heard this these comments so often and this fighting that's going gone on within brother branham's message of the absolute what a ridiculous argument it really is the absolute is whatever you and your life put as the absolute but we hear Brother Branham say these things and we need to know where these are in the Bible because there may be a time parents young parents future parents there may be a time when your children say you know what I don't believe brother Branham anymore that time May Come but will they have the foundation of this word then this becomes the absolute and then they will be able to say no actually it says it right here in the Bible you know we look at we talk about so often well and it's too much we talk about a woman's dress and and and all of these different things and we look at Paul First Timothy chapter 2. Paul said a woman shall Adorn herself in modest apparel would shame-facedness and sobriety not with gold or pearls or costly array we see that right here in the Bible and then people say well I don't believe it was random anymore and then they run and they start dressing the way that they want to dress and they start looking the way that differently than than they should be looking and what they're realizing is that ain't brother Branham he's not the one that taught that gold and pearls and costly way all right brother branham's actually his his angle on it was hey don't be so legalistic you can wear a wedding ring but if you just took the if you just took what Paul said to be like no no you can't wear any of that but brother Brandon the prophet said no a wedding Ring's okay if and he made the comment if your husband buys you a a brooch to pen to your your garment or if he buys you a necklace he says that'd be okay he said but just don't look like I think he he said his words were to let you walk through a dime store with a magnet attached to you but we look at we look at these things and when the time comes what is the absolute you can say wait wait wait wait wait a minute that wasn't brother Branham that was Paul that was the Bible don't don't pin that on him he was just preaching the Bible and he was preaching it with a wonderful wonderful perspective you know he talks about a woman having long hair you know first thing you know I don't believe brother Brandon anymore it comes off wait wait wait a minute that wasn't brother Branham that was first Corinthians chapter 11. you know it says very plainly that a woman should have long hair because it's recovering that's that is that but but so but because people don't understand they don't know their Bible all they hear is brother Brandon said brother Branham said brother Branham said well what happens when they say I don't care what brother Branham said I care you care but what happens when we face that this Foundation needs to be built then the absolute becomes this and it's a little bit different for people in today's society saying I don't believe that it's a little bit harder to say but if we can build that in our youth build that in each other then we have a little bit stronger foundation and answering these questions and that's what this man of hazia he did not have he didn't have that family around the supper table you know the guy that was at the U of A game the basketball game you know he was so happy he was so happy because he says you know these are my people this is this is what I was what I like let me tell you I am so happy I am so happy today because these are my people this is what I like to be around I love being here with people that actually care about this book I love it this book is my life it has been for a long time and it's and I love being around someone else that cares that they're not setting it aside like a hazia did they're not setting it aside for their own thoughts verse number five he said he he also walked after their counsel and went with johoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazel the king of Syria at Ramos Gilead and the syrians smoke smoke jorm now joram was the king over in um Israel now you remember when I talked about the other day about the still Small Voice the Elijah in the cave do you remember what the still Small Voice told him it told him to go out and anoint a few people it said anoints Hazel king of king of Syria I believe it was and it said anoint this guy named jehu this guy was a warrior jehu was a strong powerful General turned out to be not such a good guy but annoyed him and then jehu you know what he did he walked in he came in with all of his chariots and everything and there's a there's Jezebel up on the rafters and she's looking like Jezebel and she sticks her head out and he says Hey throw her down and Jezebel it's in the Bible I'm okay to say it those are down you know Splat right on the ground dogs ate her you know I know it's kind of a horror movie but it's true I mean this is the real thing so this man jehu rolls in and he ends up killing this man ahasia let's go to verse 10 if you could my brother but when athalia I called her athelia athalia the mother of ahasia saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the Royal seed all the seed Royal of the house of Judah a woman took the opportunity to take the kingdom to herself just like her mama you know she was taught wrong too now and uh I'm gonna close and I'm gonna I'm gonna get to this this evening and um the musicians if you would come but now we see introduced a wonderful wonderful example to the people of Judah but jehosha Beth the daughter of the king now there was this baby that they had athaliah came in and she starts killing all of the seed so she could have it her son ahasia died so afterlaya she's going out and she's killing all of these people so she doesn't have any competition so she can have the Kingdom so she can have the power but when ethaliah the mother of hazia saw her son was dead she Rose and destroyed all the seed Royal of the house of Judah but Jehoshaphat the daughter of the king took joash the son of ahasia and stoled him from among the king's sons that were slain and put him and his nurse in a bed chamber so jehoshaph joshabeth the daughter of King joram johoram the wife of jehoiada the priest for she was the sister of ahasia hid him from athaliah so that she slew him not so that this lady Jehoshaphat protected this baby who was of the royal seed this was being purged and these things were going on but she made a stand for God she made a stand for what was right her husband was a great man powerful man and in the Kingdom but this Jehoshaphat unlike Jezebel and unlike at thelaya she wasn't thinking about her own skin she was thinking about Lord what is the right thing to do and she risked her life to do what was right and he was hid with them in the house of God six years and athaliah reigned over the land [Music] this dear sister she as I said she was an important lady in Judah she had what she needed to get by but she was willing to pay the ultimate sacrifice that this young man this little baby I think he was probably two years old or one year old or whatever it was that he would live and she protected him and I think about and I'm going to talk tonight about her husband jehoida who is one of my absolute heroes in the Bible but she and her husband protected this baby raised him up right in the Lord this baby named joash taught him right maybe sat around the supper table talked about the things of the Lord and today friends as as we are trying to do things right we are we are trying to serve God we see Satan coming in in all directions trying to distract us with any way that he can whether it be with our phones or whether it be with the television or whether it be with social media or whatever it is and and making it to where we don't have that family life anymore and I was thinking about I was thinking about Lord how our children and how all of these things are forced on them as I said the immorality that comes from the schools and and and all of these different voices that they hear and then we put social media in their hands and as I've said before I'm not against social media I think it could be used for the Lord but look what happens it takes the mom and dad takes them out of the equation and now they're all talking with each other all the time there's no more family time and they're raising themselves and they're being an influence on themselves and Mom and Dad aren't even there back and forth and back and forth if we could build a strength in our children and it comes from that home life it comes from Raising it comes from loving them it comes from teaching them so when the enemy comes in and he does when he comes in like a flood as Isaiah said that God will raise up that standard against him and we teach our children that hear this is God's word brother Branham we refer to him so much he preached this brother Branham lifted up this man named Jesus Christ and children if you could just meet this man Jesus this one that I have met this one that saved me this one that I was baptized in his name if you could just meet him then the sins that you commit the mistakes that you make and you will make them you can come back to that because he loves you a hazia didn't have that taught to him he had the world talk to him so I'm speaking mostly As I spoke a lot to the dads and the future dads today make sure that we are living a life that's worthy of the Gospel make sure we are living that life so our wives can look to us feel comfortable looking to us for leadership make sure of that and then mothers make sure we're teaching our children that this word it's the truth and it is the absolute make sure that that is taught because there is coming a time for all of them and all of us that those doubts come in and when those doubts come in that standard of the word that's inspired by the Holy Spirit it'll stand it'll stand against The Wiles of the devil so let's all stand brother Aaron if you could come and [Music] it's a special time friends I believe that the Lord will soon return I know brother Peter said that but the law he said that 2000 years ago and he was expecting it but there's a lot of things that had to happen and if they haven't all happened they're all getting pretty close but we know that the devil is stronger today he is more influential he has more tools than he's ever had but never ever underestimate the power of sitting around the supper table never underestimate that fellowship with family that fellowship with loved ones and we're trying to build that Fellowship here with each other and we can lean on each other we can rely on each other you know when when the storms come and the Sheep they they get together and they'll all huddle up out in the fields and they just kind of lean on each other when those Storms Come they stay really tight together and that's how we should be is leaning on each other and loving one another protecting one another speaking for one another praying for one another that's what we need to be because we can look and we can see in this word we can see these examples and how so many times parents have failed because they've they've forgotten how important these things and they've fallen into the world but friends let's bow our heads thinking on the things of God thinking how important that Bible is to us thinking how important the words are in that Bible and how we just we should understand everything in there there's so much it's so rich Lord just let us let us have a little more revelation of your word Lord we love you we thank you feel your spirit of Love here this morning Lord we're just grateful we're grateful that you've recorded these stories we can read them we're grateful for loved ones
