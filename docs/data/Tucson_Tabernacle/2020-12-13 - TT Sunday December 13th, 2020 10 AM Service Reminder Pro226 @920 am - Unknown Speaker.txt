you have your Bible amen we'll go straight to the word this morning AMS chapter one you love him amen praise the Lord I'd like to to say just before before we begin as a way of announcement we'll have brother Wayne Lawson here this coming weekend amen and so I know that you'll have great expectation amen for that brother Wayne is uh I got everybody has their favorite preachers well that's mine uh so I love brother Wayne he's always since I was uh very young uh he I heard his ministry when I was just a boy and uh just he's always had a great impression on me I love his Spirit his attitude amen out of the pull pit and in the pull pit amen he's just a wonderful brother so I know you'll come in expectation for brother Wayne Amen for this coming weekend amen the the morning and evening service amen announce it yeah okay so announcement for the choir practice children's choir practice right after service in the sanctuary amen so if you got children in that make sure they attend I'd like to also say just a as a way of um reann ancing something that we've already announced uh concerning the fellowship poll and I know that we made some loose announcements concerning uh concerning the fellowship hll being closed during uh the pandemic and so we want to reup that make sure that you're aware of that just to remind you um that when you're in the fellowship poll please use it for passing through if you want to greet somebody briefly now I don't want to say you know have a deacon on a timer and say you got five seconds and then we're out of the term brief but I'll leave that descrip freshing up do you please don't congregate uh in there I'll just say I've seen that a couple the last couple weekends and we just we don't want to have to have deacons come and get you and and remove you uh if you need to be in there and it's essential we understand that but if you don't have a need to be in there just please go to the outside use that just for we almost thought about closing it off but a lot of people access it from the parking lot um and so I know that you're more aware I'm sure that I am that uh the the co 19 is spreading uh really On The Rise here Arizona is leading uh Tucson in fact leading uh many parts of the country in cases and my brother-in-law who's a nurse uh here in Tucson was just reporting last night that the hospital beds ICU beds are filling up and uh there's been a lot of cases around with Believers even here in Tucson some who have uh went on to be with the Lord some back home uh who we we had funeral a funeral here recently for a sister in our church who passed from it so we we don't say that to put fear upon anybody but this is the end times this is the end of the world so what do you expect uh it's going to get worse before it gets better but we just want to say that uh we we're good with what we're doing here uh there's been other churches even here in town who've had to completely shut down and close uh church because of uh cases that have risen and and just got out of control I don't want to see that happen here do you no we don't want to see that happen so we should do all we can all we could possibly do uh if you feel to wear a mask I'd encourage that do it um have I have no issue with that someone asked me is be okay if I wear a mask absolutely if you feel to wear a mask wear one uh and if and and so whatever you you do it do it Paul The Book of Romans says that whatever we do we do it by faith and if it's not Faith it's sin to us and so we want to uh do things that are pleasing to the Lord so I just wanted to as a a way of reminder to remind you uh take all Fellowship outdoors in an outdoor area uh and not in the fellowship poll so if it's a brief greeting something just quick you just saying hello that's fine just don't congregate again there are people who need to be in there as essential things that they're doing those are just fine amen you love the Lord amen praise God Amos chapter 1 Brothers if you have the PowerPoint I'll have you to speak L it I'd like to minister to you today and it's going to be um just how the Lord laid it upon my heart very uh very uh just a we would almost call it a study amen a Bible study here this morning just but just some a word that the Lord put upon my heart and started dealing with me uh yesterday and so I just like to speak to you on return to me return to me Amos chapter 1 the words of Amos who was among the Herdman of tooa which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah and in the days of jeroboam the son of joash king of Israel two years before the earthquake I almost titled the message today two years before the earthquake uh but the Lord just changed me here but I want you to notice the emphasis here that this is written in retrospect so when you read The Book of Amos this is after the fact this isn't during uh this isn't the unfolding this is writing after the fact the words uh the Bible read it again here in verse one the Bible says the words of Amos who was among the Herdman tocoa which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah and in the days of jeroboam the son of joash king of Israel two years before the earthquake and he said the Lord will Roar from Zan and utter his voice from Jerusalem and the habitations of the Shepherds shall mourn and the top of caramel shall wither thus sayith the Lord for three transgressions of Damascus and for four I will not turn away the punishment thereof because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron but I will send a fire into the house of haziel which shall Devour the Palaces of benh Hadad I will break also the bar of Damascus and cut off the inhabitant of the plain of aan and him that holdeth the scepter from the House of Eden and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto cerr saith the Lord uh Amos chapter 4 turn over and we'll read one more scripture and then I have you be be seated verse N9 Amos 4 verse N I have smitten you with blasting and mildew when your Gardens and your Vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased the p worm devoured them yet you have not returned unto me sayeth the Lord let's bow our heads here amen together Lord Jesus we just Trust You Lord fully leaning Upon Your Grace this morning asking God that you would come Lord as we we've we've worshiped Lord the musicians the song leader we've sang the songs of Zion there's been praise sing Lord we've raised our hands now God we come to this most important part of the service and we bow our heads to you Lord as your creation and ask Lord for you to take preeminence Lord may you speak to each and every single life each and every single heart here today God as you've moved heavy upon my own heart I pray God that you would just use me Lord as a vessel Lord of mercy and of Honor Lord to these people I pray God that you would use the words that I speak may they be your thoughts Lord we ask Grant it Lord Jesus we pray in your name we we ask amen you can be seated this morning I'm going to go through a lot of of what we would know is history and you could read from Biblical historians and I just bring a thought out of it I believe it's it's a a well-known book in many ways and then not so well known in others this man Amos uh the prophet of God In Our Generation spoke a lot about this little sycamore tree farmer named Amos and this is a a man who uh is from the kingdom of Judah and so if this gets just a little bit teachy I don't have a whiteboard here a chalkboard to draw it on so just uh listen as close as you can and I'll give you some of these because I believe it's important to know the context uh when you're reading the Bible it's important to know who was the writer who was the prophet what was the message what was happening in the in the generation uh in the time frame where are we uh when we read these words and I believe it has such a an amazing parallel to the generation that we see here today Amos is a man from the southern Kingdom of Judah and he's he's preaching his message to the northern uh tribes of Judah this is in the 8th Century year is about 760 and Amos is going to be one of the last two prophets that God sends to Israel and so you read throughout your Bible and you read Israel in many different conditions and and this was a this was a time when there was uh just sin rampant amongst the churches both in the Southern and the northern tribes and so it's an it's it's during the time Amos writes this it's a during a time of of of relative what you would call Peace there's no war there's no battles the Assyrians have repented under Jonah there's no pressure coming from anybody whether from the northern Kings or the southern Kings there's no there's no there's there's no famine this is a time of Peace it's a time and this is the the setting for when Amos begins to write what we just read in Amos chapter 1 it's a time of prosperity uh but it's also at the same time a time of great neglect of God's word you always find hand in hand most of the time brother brandham says it this way he says sometimes Prosperity is one of the greatest curses that can come upon you we we know we've preached that here many times the the most spiritual David was the David uh in the desert running for his life and the most carnal backslid in David was the castle version of David when he had everything and so Israel is in great Pro great prosperity yet they're at the same time neglecting God and they've turned away from the god of their fathers and so you find this refrain you'll find this message throughout all of amos's words return to me sayeth the Lord return back to me and and he comes through Amos and he's going to be uh as we said he's one of the last two he's the last second to last prophet that is sent after Amos comes a man named Hosea and Hosea is the last warning that God sends to Israel with the same message returned to me now if you study a little bit of just uh uh history you'll find that the 8th Century you'll find all of these prophets are considered 8th Century Prophets The Year 760 and so the centuries are named prior and so we know that so this is the eth and eth Century prophet and and he's a sycamore farmer means that he's he's a no body he doesn't he comes from just out of nowhere suddenly comes upon the scene and this is the way God always uses his prophets he always takes a nobody someone with no history someone with no prominence someone who really doesn't maybe have a great education and he comes here and he and and right in the in the middle of this uh right right in the middle of this he comes with this message to the northern tribes of Israel and so he he he he he's a he's a nobody as we said he's a sycamore farmer that just simply means in the Bible times that uh he didn't have much he was very poor Sycamore farmer didn't make a a great living they were very meager uh income and so but but here's a principle that you'll find throughout the entire Bible God loves to confound the somebodies with the nobody he loves to take a nobody and and and and and he loves to confound them by choosing uh a nobody and this is what it spoke of when it said that Amos was a sycamore farmer it spoke to this man under the sycamore tree as you read his story and God let me Cho let me tell you this God did not choose Amos because of who he was but God chose Amos because of who he was not and God chooses us not because of what we are but what we're not God chooses us not because of who we are but who we not and the reason for God's choice when God chooses a vessel the choice lies and is revealed with him not the person in other words if you want to try to find why did God choose me you will never find it when you search yourself because the choice that God Made For You in election had nothing to do with you or how good you are or how bad you are or how great your conduct is or how bad your conduct is or or how good you look or how bad you look his choice in election is not revealed in the creation but the Creator because his reason lies in him not you and that's why you can never question why did God choose me because God didn't choose you for you he choose he chose you for him the Bible is not the the the people we have this modern day thinking that the Bible is is God's answer to us you know it's it's the answer that we needed and so it's it's all it's it's preached you know uh you need God well God's here for you you need you need Prosperity well God's here for you and God needs you listen friend the the Bible is God's answer to his problem not our problem he the Bible doesn't come the word of God doesn't come to fix our problems they come because he had a purpose before eternity brother manam says this and I want you just to read here he says this little unknown fellow was Amos he's a little unknown fellow was Amos the prophet now we don't know very much about him he says we don't know very much about him we don't know where he come from prophets usually he says prophets usually come on the scene unknown and leave the same way we don't know where they come from where they go don't know about their backgrounds God just raises them up he wasn't much to look at but he had thus saith the Lord that's the main thing I see of course he come to Samaria to begin his campaign I'm sure he had no cooperation from nobody he had no Fellowship card from any denomination he had no credentials to show what group he come from but he had one thing he had the word of the Lord for that City look what the prophet said Amos when he come into Samaria his little eyes narrowed as he come up over that and seen that sinful City now that sinful City that brother Bram is referring to is not the cosmos it's not the whole rest of the Heathen world that sinful city is Judah that sinful city is Israel and brother Bram says he comes over his eyes narrowed and he says he's seen that little sinful City women laying in the street with man a modern America when he looked up over his eyes narrowed and he had nobody to sponsor him he had no Fellowship card God had sent him would the people hear his message no they wouldn't hear him but he prophesied and he said the very God that you claim to serve will destroy you this is a modern picture of what you would maybe call the kingdom of of of that time it's accuracy could be questioned but I just thought it was uh just just so to give you some background here of the time frame and and so this is a time when Amos comes along when you ask the question he's he's coming in what you would know in history is the 8th Century so what was taking place in the 8th Century what was happening where was the world picture what was the era that he comes upon what did the world look like very much like it does today what what was the what was the the the the worldly as we would call it scene what's the backdrop well you'll find there were there were two major world powers in dominance in the 8th Century just two two major Powers you had Rome and you had Greece and we know that there was a great rivalry a great uh H H war between these two Nations these two great names Rome and Greece and we know that Rome was uh building infrastructure they were building roads and you see some of those roads we had a map that we'll display not sure how good you can see that but Rome is busy building roads and streets and highways and and they're they're building infrastructure and some of those roads that lead to to through Athens and you can go and travel some of those same roads today and they would be the very same roads that the gospel is is carried through in the New Testament and so Rome is busy building uh infrastructure and military strength and and and and and and but what Greece was uh uh establishing what we have today as the as the modern world what we call the the the the the World of Sports it's where you'll find their Origins everything you see here in the world today had a beginning it had an origination it started somewhere right even some of the same spirits that you see today and you think well it's it's Unique to our age it's not unique at all because everything started in a seed form where the only uniqueness is the m maturity of those Spirits are you here today what you're what what we face today is no different than what they faced back then the only difference is is that this is the Harvest Time and so at the Harvest Time all seeds come to maturity Satan's Eden comes to maturity that's why entertainment is at its Zenith it's at its maturity it's at its climax this is Brother Ram called he said he's the God of this evil age this where we're living today is not in God's Eden this isn't God's Planet this isn't God's world uh utopian uh the people who have the utopian view that this is the best life and this is we just want to make it as great as we can listen friends this is the worst life now popular Pastor in in Dallas Church of the largest church in America wrote a book that your best life now now you know just the title is not biblical this isn't your best life now your best life is the next life that's why I'm laying Treasures up in this life for the next life can you say amen and so Greece is established in the word of sports this is where the 8th Century where the Olympic games begin the Olympic Games we have today Trace them all the way back to this era and so it's it's it was laying uh Greece was uh busy the world was busy it was it was flourishing and prosperity and and and it was just an age of development and arts and literature and uh were were under Greece were being uh uh just the very foundations and the Very roots of it even even this is the age when the uh the civilization of the Chinese and the the Indian culture uh is is is established here in this age in this 8th Century you say well that was what the world was doing the world was flourishing the world was beginning the world was growing but my question is what was God doing where was God at this time what was God thinking what was God's people doing and the the answer to that question is that God was very very busy with his people God was having trouble great trouble he was having great problems from his children great great issues great problems and and it's amazing because Israel had a very simple Covenant to live by it's the same very much the same that you live by today and we can complicate things but let me give you the very simple Covenant that Israel had to live by blessing or cursing obedience brings blessing Disobedience brings cursing and God doesn't break covenants God keeps his covenants God doesn't break marriage God loves marriage he hates divorce God doesn't like separation so God says here's here's the law I'm going to you're going to live by blessing or cursing obedience or Disobedience and what we find very sadly is that they were living in a time where there's much Disobedience you'll find there in in your in your uh in the map there that we have before you the purple would be the southern Kingdom and the green would be the Northern Kingdom Israel and Judah and you'll find that in both places uh during this time God sends prophets two last prophets a man named Amos and a man named Hosea and they there that God had a special purpose and a special role and a special message now remember it wasn't amos's message it wasn't hosea's message oh this is so important for you to catch the message was not William bram's message I if you get offended I'll pull you up the quote and show you where he says that it's not my message this wasn't amos's message this was God's message this was God's heart and so God took a chosen vessel one who could be wholly separated unto himself and he said I'm going to fill you and baptize you with my spirit I'm going to take my burden that I have upon my heart and my message of what I want to say to my people and I'm going to so saturate you with that message Amos that you and the message will become one and amos's very heart was the heart of God he was expressing the very Mind Of God he was expressing the thoughts of God when he spoke he was not expressing his own thoughts he was a unic spiritually he didn't have any seed of his own he didn't have any mind of his own he didn't have any thought of his own it was the thought of God so when you rejected Amos who were you rejecting hello when you reject Amos you're not rejecting Amos you're rejecting God when you rejected Hosea you're not rejecting Hosea you're rejecting God that because it wasn't their message they were simply the mailman and don't get mad at the mailman he's just delivering the male and so when you get upset at the sermon when you get upset at what God's telling you don't get upset at the mailman he's just delivering the male amen and so God comes through the min histories of Amos and Hosea and he has a specific purpose he has a specific need and a specific message and he says I'm going to have you speak it now this is this is sad because when you look also in the 8th Century where was Israel we asked that question well unfortunately as you can see by our map they're divided they're not one at all uh they're they're they're they're separated now I know that all of us some of us here would would know some of this so let me just go over a brief uh cuz when you hear that maybe some would get confused on what do you mean the northern and the kingdom you you know we know the the the Civil War right there was the North and there was the South well let me talk about a different Civil War one that happened before that Civil War because that's what it was really it was a civil war that broke out between the North and the South amen and I'll just say Amos was a southerner so he comes from the south and his message is to the north now notice why are they divided they become where do we get a kingdom we have a northern kingdom and Southern Kingdom well then we have to ask well why a kingdom well because there's Kings well why Kings because they demanded a king to be like other nations originally in God's mind he was the great uh uh potentate he was the great Monastery he was the great he was the great uh King for Israel but they wanted a king they wanted to be like other nations so even though God warned them even though God tell told them Kings will fail you men will fail you yeah they wanted the king to be like despite all Samuel's warnings they wanted to become a kingdom and so then when they become a kingdom they chose a leader they chose a king and that man was Saul and he the son of Kish you know he has the image he has the stat sture he has the looks he has the gift he has the ability he's very eloquent he's very articulate he looks like the king he dresses like the king he's got a strong stature strong and build and so this is who they choose that's who man always chooses because God says man looks after the outward of is not like you I look upon the heart and so God's man was a little man named David not a big man named Saul but they chose Saul and we know the story of Saul and he has his own uh moral failure and issues and and he and and his own issues and problems and he falls apart as he's a popular choice but major character issues inside of this man that would only come out later and so God God gave them a man after his own heart a man named David and we know the story of that but you say well that's great well well God chose a man not but look friends even David had his mistakes even David backsliding murder and adultery in David's life you see God was trying to tell them that he he spoke to them when you go read the Bible you'll find that there was a there was a dispensation where God chose prophets there was a dispensation when God chose priests there was a dispensation when God chose Kings but at the end of all of man's dispensation then comes one man and King Jesus and he's Prophet he's priest and he's King and is the only unfailing high priest and so God God God sends them through this we know that they become a kingdom then after David comes Solomon who builds this great glorious Temple and it's a it's just a in magnificent Kingdom our temple in glory and and and and he did his his his his uh economy is flourishing and under Solomon its Prosperity but even if you go look up uh the the the details you miss the details sometimes you don't read the fine print you just read all the major highlights you'll find that Solomon built that Kingdom off of heavy Taxation and forced labor Solomon heavy Taxation and forced labor and so what did that lead to well a Revolt no one wanted to work for free he goes and taxes everybody heavy Taxation and so there leads this great Revolt after he dies his son after him we know we know the the story I'm just giving you just a brief uh history here because all of the wealth all of the money is going to be concentrated in the south in Judah that's where all the money's going to come from so before this map they were all one Kingdom but because of that taxation because of the forc labor because of because of man's schemes and man's ways Civil War breaks out a Revolt breaks out under rabo and and and we know that we know that the kingdom then uh splits and so 10 tribes of Israel revolt and they separate and there's the there's the separation and they they create their own kingdom and then there's two tribes that stay faithful in Jerusalem because now you have you have a you have a a a a a split and now you have the northern kingdom which is Israel and you have the southern Kingdom which is Judah and you have the Tribe of Benjamin and Judah the ones that stay true to the line of David because you see God this wasn't this wasn't about Kings and kingdoms and and buildings and Ministries and popularity and reputations this was about a seed line God's mind was about a seed that would come through David that out of the root of David out of the root of Jesse would come a deliverer but you see how man gets right in the way of God's plan and it becomes personal and then their feelings get involved then there's a Revolt then there's a split they forgot the purpose they forgot the meaning it wasn't about you it was never about your kingdom it was never about your way or what you wanted it was about fulfilling the purpose of God it was about bringing forth the plan of God it was about a royal seed so they they they stay true this these Southern kingdoms stay true and faithful to Jerusalem and the Royal line that God was going to bring through David but you know what that meant when the northern kingdom split it meant now they don't have a temple because the Temple's in the southern Kingdom so you know what they did they created their own temple in fact they created two of them they don't have a Temple they don't have a king so what do they do they got another king when you read the book of Kings this is what you're reading that's why you read about the king that has the same name but it's a different King one's Northern one Southern and they buildt a temple they built a king and then you read in the book of Kings such and such was the son of tcoa the mother was name was was this name and he lived this many years and he did that with that which was right you remember that and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord and this is what you're reading in the book of Kings as these two northern and southern kingdoms that had split because now that the northern kingdom pulls off you say brother Matt who are we talking about this is God's chosen family I want that to sink in this isn't heathens this is God's people that became so inundated with their life became so inundated with their purpose they forgot the main thing so they establish they create their own Royal Line they create their own religion their own culture it's very much like the southern Kingdom it's very much like the way of David but not exactly sort of mixed in little mixed religion and they create two shrines two holy temples one's going to be you can't see it there but there's a little town that we know very well named bethl and they create one temple in bethl they create one in Samaria and the both temples are going to be just infested with sin and adultery and debauchery some of the most horrible things but they have two they have two uh one one at bethl which bethl means what it means the house of God and then one further north in Samaria you remember the Samaritan woman when she comes to Jesus and she's asking the question should we worship in Samaria should we worship here or in Jerusalem she's referring all the way back to this and and and they they established their own King their own kingdom their own Temple their own way of worship their own way of worship starts right here makes their own Royal Line you could go read about it in the book of Kings as we said first and second Kings it's it's an amazing thing because there there's a mixture now remember the message is returned to me sayeth the Lord there's this mixing this mixture this mixture within right within the family of God right within the people of God and they start bringing in other gods the gods of Bell and the gods of asteroth and it's mixed in it sort of it sort of looks like a message church I mean a David church but not exactly something just not exactly there's hints of it there's there's ways you could trace it oh that's that's right but there's so many things that don't reflect the god of their fathers remember he was the one who called himself the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob it was God who chose to identify himself with these men with God's family and God said I'll put where I put my name not where you put my name where I put my name and I'll put my name in them the god of their fathers the god of the of of how they were raised the god of their past it there was traces that you could label but then there was so much mixture that was so different so new so Heathen even their culture even the Bible says that they eventually you come to Hagi and they had completely forgotten the children had completely forgotten the ancient language didn't know how to speak it didn't know how to talk they they they knew there was a language but they didn't know it and God through ha condemns them for this what was it it was a mixture and so it's amazing because anytime there's wickedness anytime that you f that you backslide away from God many many times that backsliding now remember there's a difference there's such a difference between falling away and backsliding say brother Matt how's there a difference because the prophet of God said we backslide every day now that's his words the Apostle Paul said I Die daily because backsliding all backsliding is is just going backwards it's not necessarily I know we used the term to say oh they've backslid and they're in the world but backsliding sometimes you have a person who falls away falls into sin and they're out of church and they're in the world they're captive and a prisoner but but then you have backsliding which is much more gradual because with backsliding there's still the outward image most of the time you can still talk and say the same things you can still look sort of the same part but something's taking place in the heart and it always starts in the heart backsliding always starts in the heart are you here today Church backsliding always starts in the heart it always starts it never starts with an outward act the Bible says when lust hath conceived When sin hath conceived when lust has con conceived it brings forth sin and When sin has ran its work it brings forth death but when lust is conceived that conception happens in the mind in the heart and the spirit yes and many people backslide in their heart long before they fall away in their flesh and that's why in churches church that's why we're preaching here today that's why we're saying the things that we're saying because the word of God meets both the the believer the unbeliever and the make believer the word of God speaks to all of us and the backsliding always takes place as Israel that was always gradual it always slowly started as turning away from God and the heart always turns before the feet we've preached on that hair before look at lot and Abraham Abraham the Bible says lot pitched his tent towards Sodom with Abraham right but he wasn't in Sodom yet but he had pitched his tent in other words his heart is affection and what happens it's only a matter of time and lot leaves and dwells inside long before the feet leave the heart leave first and so there's a gradual backsliding it's it's a turning away what's amazing the as a bi as an average it's just incredible to me that if you go and you read the book of kings and you average out the lifespan of a wicked King The King that says and he did that which was evil in in in Kings you'll read that and it says he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord and then it then it begins to talk about it it says and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord and it's amazing because when you look at the history of all of the northern Kings they had very very short Reigns very short every single one of you find very short Reigns a wicked King only Reigns for a very short period of time they always uh they always either were assassinated there was a takeover there was a coup it was always an unstable government and in fact the average was three years they would only Reign for three years on average before they would be assassinated or a coup their government was always unstable because why because anything I'm reminded of the words of brother Brandon anything outside of the line and Order of God's word will fail amen that doesn't mean it doesn't work for a period of time and it looks like everything's fine because sometimes the decisions that we make we don't we're not affected by immediately and so we think hey it must be fine but the the Bible says because sentence because the sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily therefore the hearts of the sons of men fully set in them to do evil what is that is Ecclesiastes what is it saying it says just because you don't reap what you sow the next day after you seow it doesn't mean you're not going to reap what you sow that's why choices are important decisions are important what we the choices we make can have a consequence that affects not just us but our children and our children's children Generations and so they they they they they last three years on average unstable but you know what's amazing the southern Kings if you go and look at the southern Kings it was always a stable government because why it was based upon God's word it was based upon the Royal Line Of God through David and if you average out the reign of a king from the southern tribe it was 33 years imagine Jesus at 33 you think God did that by accident no the average reign of a Godly King imagine that because there was one righteous King and his name was Jesus the average reign of a southern of of a king from the southern tribe who was followed after the precepts of David they weren't perfect was 33 years so the northern kingdom becomes the focus of these two men Amos and Hosea the Bible says here the words of Amos this is Amos 111 who was among the herdmen of tcoa which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah and in the days of jeroboam the son of joash king of Israel two years before the earthquake now remember that this is the words of God before as we said this was a time of peace and prosperity uh Jonah goes to Assyria who was one of their number one adversaries and Assyria unlike what Jonah wanted repent so it eases off the pressure Israel is not under any kind of pressure there was no kind of threat immediately no trouble no stress no war in fact there was an entire generation of young people who never experienced War they never experienced War they never experienced trouble if you read about that era and you you go and look at that uh um uh uh uh era of of of what we're speaking of here with Amos children who were born who never knew War you know that has an effect that has a consequence whether good or bad it has a consequence you know I I've known war you've known My Generation has known war our nation has been to war multiple times but this was a generation who never knew War now I didn't experience by no means have any way to to I can only imagine when I hear the stories of my grandfather about real war and I hear about World War II about Vietnam and you hear what the nation was like under real War I never experienced a draft I never watched my father uh get drafted but some of us have some of us here have have fought in war it's a amazing thing because when you don't when when you when you don't experience it sometimes God has to bring a person through something sometimes you just got to live it before you can you got to experience it before you can really know what you're talking about and they had no war that means there would they never experienced stress they never experienced real anxiety they never experience real pressure no trouble and an entire generation grows up soft soft soft they're soft people they don't really know how to appreciate normal things don't know how to appreciate hard time good times because they've never really had hard times you know sometimes God's got to bring you through hard times just so you can appreciate good times sometimes God has to break your health so that you'll appreciate good health yeah so I don't know why I'm stopping here but I'm just going to stop sometimes God has to bring people through things and you have no you have you have you have you have no you don't you don't know how to appreciate things that just work things that just work things that you take for granted every single day I'm just talking about very physical things very natural things you know I'll never I I'll never I remember thinking that when I had lost my hearing and and I had intense uh vertigo and couldn't walk couldn't hardly get without help from my house to my vehicle had to be helped because everywhere the world I looked was spinning and shaking and I would fall and you know I thought I never knew how to appreciate balance until I didn't have it and you ought to look at the things God has given you in your life and you ought to say thank you thank you Lord for the things I'm unthankful for thank you for the things I don't think about thank you for the things I take for granted 11:22 boy we have not even scratched the surface are you all right so it's a time of great Prosperity under under King jeroboam II and if you read about that era in the north and we don't have it here I think you're not going to be able to see there on the map but there's in the north you'll find there was right up uh oh right up on the very top there was a a trade route a road that goes all the way from Europe to Arabia and it and it what it meant was that they were the pass through cities so they could trade they they became prosperous because of this they became Rich they became soft they were very religious very religious yet very backsliding very soft very religious but not the religion of their fathers it was mixed with Pagan practices cultures the god of bell and asteroth were mixed into their worship now Bell and asaroth are both gods of fertility both of them gods of fertility and it's amazing because if you go look and I'm not in a mixed audience going to say too much here today but if you look at the temple at bethl and the one at Samaria uh there were there was there was actually prostitutes at the church on the at the front door not there for the right reasons you go read some of your Bibles some of the most horrible things you could ever imagine took place right in the house of God this is this is people always look and you know you have a secular world who looks at the Judgment of God and says oh my such a horrible God and so mean and so angry well you don't the the punishment fit the crime you never understand why did God react this way till you go back and realize how how really awful it was what they were doing to Children what they were doing to to to to people it was horrible right in the church God of bell and astrath both gods of fertility and people were turning up in droves to the temples to worship because when worship when worship I'm going to make this point when worship becomes sensual it always attracts crowds when worship becomes sensual it becomes popular it's amazing because fertility sexuality those kind of things that you find even here that we read about mixes with religion and Jesus speaks about or Jude speaks about this you'll read it in the book of of Jude and and he go go on I forget it's the 20th verse or somewhere around there he says these be they who separate themselves sensual not having the spirit sensual it's amazing because today's modern churches are full of it full of it modern churches sensual worship you said brother Matt why do you preach on that because we always have to be careful that we don't bring some of those things right into the way of worship that we have the inspiration is from God and it's good to have inspiration I'm not against any of that but sometimes the vessels are dishonorable vessels and dishonorable people well that was that was really for free Israel was backsliding in the you know there there they were completely backsliding on God but let me just let me just uh come to a close here today you say brother mat those are awful things we read about some of the most terrible things we can read about there they were backslid and but you know what that wasn't the worst part the sins that you read about were not the worst part some of the most horrible things you can hear that wasn't the worst part the worst part is that nobody cared nobody cared this is why God sent Amos and Hosea no one cared you ever heard of apathy when you're apathetic towards something you know it's sort it's it's one it's that apathetic attitude you know sort of uh you know so you know that's one of the worst attitudes that you could have towards this and people can become good Believers can become if we're not careful pathetic just yeah no you you wouldn't say that we wouldn't say that but in our attitude it just becomes sort of I don't know you know it's there yeah I know that's what the word of God says but Israel was had this apathy just so yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we know it's true we know what you're saying is true we get it you've preached it every Sunday but you would you would be better off to come in here completely blitzed drunk out of your mind You' be better to come here like that completely high as a kite you'd be better off in that condition than to come here in your sane mind and hear the word of God and your attitude be because God can deal with a drunk God can deal with a drug addict but God has such a hard time breaking through religiosity of now this is what the Lord told me to preach so don't get mad at the mailman no one cared because why you say brother Matt how did that happen how do you get to such a place you don't get there overnight you don't happen it doesn't happen where you're on fire one day and you're worshiping the Lord and you come to church next Sunday and you're just no it happens very gradual Israel was very gradual slow you know if it would have happened suddenly there would been an outcry for it but it came in so slowly that people eventually accepts and just you just eventually accept it and and you know it it it just slowly Creeps in as I've as I've I've said this here before little little uh picture that I one of my I think it was my wife who sent it to me or and it was so powerful just in a little word it said spiritual death begins one compromise at a time spiritual death doesn't happen overnight it's one compromise at a time it slowly Creeps in slowly it creeps in slowly it it washes over like water and God's response to all of this after all of their backsliding that backsliding after all of their sin God could have chose just to disown them he could have said you know what okay that's it we're done you I'm just going to wipe my hands of it you obviously don't want me you obviously have no interest in it I'm just going to toss you out we're going to start over again God could have had that and just destroyed them and looked at another people and and and and just said I'm just going to start over but here's something you'll learn about God your heavenly father no matter how low no matter how far you go no matter how how deep you go in sin God never gives up on youen God never stops coming after you God never stops pursuing you no matter how distant no matter how cold no matter how much in sin the heart of God is always God hates divorce God hates divorce he loves union he loves relationship and no matter how Unfaithful you and I ever become to him he remains faithful to you and me and chapter one and chapter two you'll read this H we read it in chapter one this is all God coming to them and he's and and you'll notice Amos is prophesying against all of these neighboring cities he's prophesying against all of the other uh kingdoms that uh that had came against uh uh uh God's people and he condemns six different you'll read this in Amos one he goes to condemn six different nations and he brings great condemnation and great judgment and he's and he's and he's and he's he's condemning them for pursuing uh uh wealth and and land and power with no regard for human life with no regard for people just conquering to conquer gaining to gain and these nations are now coming under the wrath of God because of their hatred because of how they treated God's people this is what Amos 1:2 is about and you read Amos 1 and two and you think oh God is Amos is just coming after all of the world and all of the nations against him you know be like me up here preaching against uh you know uh different movements that are against God's program and we preach against the culture and everyone oh cheering and all of Israel's amen and oh go you know go after them Amos and you know preach it hard to him Amos and you know go after him that's what that's what it sounds like because you can hear the Roar from the people as Amos is just declaring and crying out and crying out against the the Nations and then you come to chapter three and then Amos turns and now those same people who are cheering he points his finger and he says hold on a minute I'm done with them now I'm going to talk to you and Amos 3 God turns and he starts to speak to Israel and he starts to deal with their condition and he he condemns Judah and Israel and says you've done the same thing you're here you are busy cheering uh you know at the condemnation coming to the Nations but you're doing the very same thing you're just like them your life is no different how do you think you're any different than them your life is no different Judah you've spurned God the ways of David you've SP you followed your diluted ideas of religion you followed your own ways of worship and because of that jerus Jerusalem's going to burn to the ground that's that's amos's message God's going to burn it all he's going to set it on fire as a punishment and and and Israel is it going to be is it going to be off the hook either but but they're they they their their sins of oppressing the people and worshiping uh any God that they come across getting drunk in the temple this is all what you find in in chapter three and so comes to all of these things and he begins to tell them I want you to turn to chapter 4 uh there in your Bible and you could put it on the screen I don't think I have it uh there I don't yet but Amos chapter 4 God comes to Ramos and he gives him a message this is a message of judgment this message of warning and he begins here in verse four listen to the listen to the listen to this preacher I want you to just for a moment put yourself there listen to this preacher come to this backsliding church and he says he says in verse verse one brother Jeremy chapter 4 verse one hear this word in other words listen close listen close I'm laughing because I know what's next he says listen close you kind of Bashan that are on the mountain of Samaria which oppress the poor let me give you the NLT this is the New Living Translation and this is verbatim exactly what he's saying I'm going to read it to you from the NLT now this is the n this is his words not mine listen to me you fat cows living in Samaria that's his words listen to me you fat cow enough you think I think the preacher ever called you something I didn't call you a fat cow Amos says listen give heed to my warning you women who oppress the poor and crush the needy who are always calling to your husbands bring us another drink verse two just follow me The Sovereign Lord has sworn this by his Holiness the time will come when you will be led away with hooks and your noses every last one of you will be dragged away like a fish on a hook you will be led out through the ruins of the wall you will be thrown from your fortresses sayth the Lord go ahead and offer sacrifices to the idols of bethl verse4 keep on disobeying at gilgal offer sacrifices each morning and bring your tithes every three days present your bread made with yeast as an offering of Thanksgiving then give you extra voluntary verse six I want to read this verse six and I'm going to switch back to the King James notice what he begins to say this is to Israel and I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities that's famine I now notice what Amos didn't say he didn't say now the devil has attacked you and brought famine in your life no he says I have given you cleanness of your teeth in all your cities and want of bread in all your places yet here's the war here's here's the words here's the heart of God yet you have not returned unto me sayeth the Lord I have also withholden the rain from you did you know God can withhold the rain from your life he can take blessing that God's given you for this many years and then suddenly pull it off of your life and it's not the devil who does that it's God hello I've taken the clean I've given you cleanness of teeth one of bread I've also withholden the rain when there were yet three months to the Harvest and I caused it to rain upon one city and caused it not to rain upon another city one piece was rained upon and the the peace whereupon it rained not withered in other words God said blessing fell here but it didn't fall to you rain fell here but I withheld it from you follow this he says and I've withholden the rain verse seven and he says verse eight so two or three cities one wed into one city to drink water but they were not satisfied yet you have not returned unto me saith the Lord I have smitten you with blasting and mildew when your Gardens and your Vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased the pmer worm devoured them yet you have not returned unto me saeth the Lord I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt you're young the same thing that God does to Egypt now God says I did that to you and you ask this question you say brother Matt why God sends food shortage crops failed then he holds the rain a water shortage there's no fresh water anywhere to drink who's doing this God now all of the people are coming under the effect of this and they might be asking the question why did this happen to me why is this happening why is this taking place over here and God says it was me the whole time why so that you would return return unto me why does God bring judgment so that you would return unto me and he says I I brought I I I I I then after then after that he sends plagues he sends plagues through diseases first the crops locusts and the crop fails imagine this if you were the people of God your your your crop three months before Harvest suddenly no rain the the crop fails you have no food now now you're hungry and and and and then disease then if you go read further God says then I sent disease he says I sent you at verse 10 among the pestilence after the man of re your young men have I slain with the sword have taken away your horses have made the stink of your camps to come up into your nostrils yet you have not return unto me sayeth the Lord what's he do he sends plagues to the people God's family this is God's people raids from other nations other Nations come suddenly Raiders from other nations come and plunder them and then God sends lightning you go and and read that is some other some uh I have overthrown some of you go to the next verse you can uh I have overthrown some of you as God overthrew Sodom and gomor and you were as fire bur and plucked out of the burning yet you have not returned unto me sayith the Lord verse 12 he says therefore thus while I do to the old Israel because I will do this unto thee prepare to meet thy God God sins pestilence God sends crop failure God SS you said brother the mat why is he doing this at any time they could have heard the voice of God through the pestilence through the crop failure through the disease through the through through God removing the blessing and it was all for the purpose of them returning unto him so he sent more and he sent more and he sent more all the while trying to get their attention trying to get their attention trying to wake them up trying to make make them realize what was happening to them was the hand of God God wasn't the hand of man this was the hand of God it was a hand of Mercy because God will keep coming God will keep pursuing God will keep pushing God will keep God you you you get so concerned oh look what God's doing to the world and the you know look what God's going to bring what is this Corona virus it's just it's it's it's judgment and and and it's it's come upon the Earth because uh the world because the nation has turned their back on God I I've heard that you know from a from a little boy you know that the the America was a Christian Nation we know that founded upon good Christian things but they're nowhere nowhere near a Christian Nation now nowhere not not even a not even a small amount of a Christian Nation Are We Now none not none whatsoever they've completely turned their back on God they've completely turned to the ways of the world and so what is God doing God is sending judgment God is s pestilence God sends earth earthquakes and hurricanes and the of God says why does he do that as a judgment to the nation but let me just stop here just for a moment my brother my sister lest we get so mesmerized by what God is doing to them that we forget God's attention is still on you it's still on me and God says don't get go so concerned with how much the world has turned their back on me what about you where is your life where is your dedication where is your worship where is your life because if you thank God has attention and has has his attention on the world how much more does he have it upon his family and God says make sure that lest while you so are so quick to judge your neighbor why you're so quick to judge the world why you're so quick to judge the the the sin in the world which is good we recognize the sin but what about the liven in our own lives we can become so obsessed with how evil the world is that we completely miss the evil that is in us and this is what happened to Israel and God was saying I sent you this you were so busy looking at the rest of the Nations and so busy about the judgments coming upon the Nations you completely forgot I'm still dealing with you I'm still dealing with the Gentiles I'm still dealing with your heart I still care so he sends all of these yet there's two more disasters as we close there's two more judgments coming upon them notice this here if you have the PowerPoint you can put it back the words of Amos who were among the Turman now the Herdman of takot now notice this is verse one of chapter one I want you to follow this closely because notice what aamos says here he says the Bible records this in retrospect which he concern Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah and the days of jerbo and the so jash king of Israel notice two years two years before the earthquake now this is written after the fact no one knew that amos's warning was two years 24 months and Counting before an earthquake a massive earthquake massive an earthquake so powerful that hits the two Northern tribes it was so big that even the prophet Zachariah 250 years later mentions this earthquake an earthquake that destroys and Sever and destroys people and families and homes yet they don't know that's God's final warning final judgment before he final warning before he sends judgment and they go into captivity after this they go into Babylonian captivity they don't know it two years before my brother my sister just pinch your conscience this morning they had no idea when they came to church and they heard that sermon on return to me saith the Lord that that sermon would start a timer and that but from that message two years 24 months and Counting before the earthquake you imagine this it was after the fact no one knew that this was two years before the sermons they were hearing turn back to God get rid of your Idols return to me sayeth the Lord was too years before the earthquake yet no one heeded the warning no one heeded the warning no one listened I thought about this as I read these words this morning and I said Lord little do we know that this sermon here today will be two years before California goes underneath the ocean little do you know that this is the last few sermons you'll hear and the last message is you say brother Matt why would you preach on this the world is so uh covered in fear and there's so much already bad news and this seems so negative my brother the message of God is a is a message of love it's a warning return to me oh sayith the Lord because little do you know it's just two years 24 months before destruction Falls and God comes to get a people little do we know that maybe we'll look back brother Aaron maybe we'll look back and say that message you preached here that message uh uh brother Peter spoke that message brother L spoke that message brother Aaron spoke or the the minister that came little did we know as we're looking in retrospect little did we know that was just 24 months before we all went home God was making one more final call one more final push one more final wooing one more final message one more he says surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth it revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophet God never sends judgment until he sends a prophet and gives a warning and you have received that warning he was going to send two last to this Northern tribe Amos and Hosea these were two opposites two completely opposite men Amos was very hardened was very very tough it was very very bare Knuckles no kid gloves this came with the message of God and spoke but God's going to send one more Prophet one more man little man named Hosea and Hosea is going to be so opposite of Amos but yet their message is going to be the same thing Amos comes with a strong accusation of God's justice spoke of what God's going to do and and how what what God's about to do but now Hosea as the last warning as the last message as the last plea Hosea comes with the message of he's it's an appeal it's an appeal and he comes return to me Amos deals with their outward sins but Hosea deals with their backslid and heart Hosea is so different the contrast between Hosea and Amos is so clear there's an affection you notice you read the words of Hosea we don't have time to turn here but there's an affection rather than an accusation there's a wooing there's a wooing where rather than a warning like Amos Hosea comes with a tender hand a soft hand a tender hand rather than a tough hand what is it it's Mercy rather than Justice because the Bible says this it says it says here for the word of God Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick that doesn't mean fast it's like you've been quickened under life it means alive the word of God the word of God is quick it's alive and powerful and sharper notice than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing the sun of the Soul and Spirit and the joints and the marrow and it is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart I want you to notice this this double-edged sword he comes from Amos and he's tough he's accusing he speaks to the mind he Majors on Justice he gives them the Divine thoughts of what God thinks but then God sends the other side of the sword named Hosea and Hosea comes tender with an appeal he speaks to the heart and he Majors on mercy and he gives to them not the Divine thoughts of God but the feeling because God says just as Hosea Gomer is going to be unfaithful to you Hosea this is and that what that does to crush your heart this is what Israel's done to me so return as one final appeal before after this you go read after this 10 tribes poof they're gone it's only later that they come and Deport the rest of them what is it it's a message of mercy God always sends mercy and judgment together yeah God always sends it as a two-edged sword the Bible says it this way mercy and judgment have kissed they've joined together they they they've actually are adjoined one to the other you can't have mercy without judgment just as much as God sends judgment he sends mercy and sometimes that love is correct of love but it's always God's love bow your heads here with me we're out of time we're going to close musicians if you could make your way he sends a man named Hosea the burden of Hosea what is it it's God's warning but it's God's mercy it's God's dealing with with a with a sharp sword dealing with the sins in your life confronting those ways that you know are not like him those ways that are not the ways of your fathers God confronts it head on sometimes that's exactly what we need we need someone to be honest with us we need the Holy Spirit to to say like David say search me oh God see if there be any wickedness in me as brother Brandon would come to the end of a message a cutting message and he he'd say oh don't you feel just so scoured out sometimes we need that we need to raise a hand and say Lord scour me out that's what I need carve it out Lord root it out come to every area and every aspect of my life have I not seen your your hand in the way that that you came to Israel you failed crops you brought disease you brought pestilence but maybe it wasn't the devil maybe it was you trying to get my attention to say return to me but then Lord that same hand that can be so firm that same hand of judgment comes with a hand of Mercy outstretched and says I'm not I'm not here to judge you I'm not here to destroy you I'm not here to insult you I'm not here to condemn you I'm here to set you free I'm here to outstretch a hand of Mercy to say Mercy is here Mercy is still here the grace of God is still here the grace of God is still for you it'll always be for you it'll always come after you because your mind saith the Lord I've bought you I've purchased you with my own blood don't be so concerned and get so wrapped up with what's taking place in the world that you miss what's happening in your world what's happening in your your little world what's happening in your planet what's happening in your home what's happening oh let me go direct to you sister brother what's
