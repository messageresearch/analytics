evening brother life we'll be ministering on another one of the books that tributed to Solomon and again as I I was thinking about this today because Solomon asked when the Lord said you could have all of this he said give me wisdom and give me a heart for the people and with that came everything else so I would say let's let's be the same way Lord I want to love you more than I ever have before

because you first love me and I love you yes I love you because you first love me yes he first loved us and we love him thank you so much first I must apologize for a misstatement from last week's lesson when talking about the topic of the Rapture I mentioned Paul writing to the Corinthians to correct a false teaching it was to the Thessalonians so often say don't take my word for anything trust but verify tonight our study or overview is of the Book of Ecclesiastes let's begin tonight's study with prayer Lord it's such a privilege to come to you once more Lord gathered with this blood-washed throng the people each of whom you paid so great a price and we're so grateful that we can count ourselves among that vast number Lord Jesus I pray that you would move by your spirit this evening I thank you for the spirit that's here I thank you for the worship and for the praise and for the heart and Lord I just pray now that you'd help us as your word comes forth Lord that that you'd Feed Us Lord that you'd give us what we need for each person that's here that you'd provide some special tidbit some special nugget some special thing Lord that they can say it was good to have been in the house of the Lord this evening Lord we thank you for your word we thank you for this responsibility and opportunity we commit now this evening to you in Jesus name amen well to to get a sense of the theme for Ecclesiastes let's open our Bibles and read our opening scriptures from uh second Peter chapter 3 you thought it was second Peter Peter writing says this Second Epistle beloved I now write unto you in both of the first letter and now also in the second one which I stir up your pure your unsullied your sincere Minds by way of remembrance I want to keep reminding you that you may be mindful of The Words which were spoken before by the holy Prophets The Old Testament and are the Commandment of us the Apostles of the Lord and Savior New Testament commands of Jesus Through the apostles knowing this first and let me give you heads up that there shall come in the last days Peter CED himself as being in that time scoffers those that will mocking us walking after their own lusts pursuing their own sinful desires and goals and saying where's the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation a verse from Luke where Jesus is speaking Luke 1726 he says and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man as it was the distant past so shall it be at some future time please be seated there is uncertainty if not controversy about when the Book of Ecclesiastes was accepted as part of the cannon of the Hebrew Bible uh there was apparently some debate about it as well as the Song of Solomon and couple of others about whether they should or should not be included there's lots of tradition about this I won't attempt to detail the arguments or the traditions because none of them can be proved what we do know is it by not later than the first century ad and likely much earlier it was part of the Hebrew scriptures the Tanakh Ecclesiastes is a short book it's only 12 chapters consists of 222 verses five or six pages in many bibles we could read it in its entirety tonight but we won't because the point is for you to read it read it at home meditate pray seek the Lord let him speak to you but we will summarize and read from it in Antiquity author ship of a book or scroll was sometimes presented as what is called a suit epigraph this means a book would claim to be author or written by some famous person often from the past in an effort to increase its acceptance books were very expensive reading skills were limited so it wasn't as if the publisher was trying to promote something to sell a million copies there are many examples of this there are plenty of works from very early Christianity that claim to be authored by famous people people like the Gospel of Thomas The Book of Enoch or even The Apocalypse of Adam others are what we call pseudonymous meaning that the author is not named not mentioned not claimed much of our new testament is this way as as much of the Old Testament for example who wrote judges or Ruth or Kings or Hebrews but regardless of who wrote them or who we think or or believe wrote them they are in the Bible so with that as a brief background let's see what the book says about its author Ecclesiastes 1:1 the words of the preacher the son of David King in Jerusalem and and in verse 12 he says I the preacher was King over Israel in Jerusalem well if these claims are true that the author is a descendant of David and he ruled over Israel from Jerusalem there's only one individual that fits that description and that is Solomon later descendants of David ruled over Judah from Jerusalem but never over Israel from Jerusalem what is the role associated with the title of preacher the Hebrew word is calet you knew that Josiah the Hebrew word is calet and it's the title of the book in the Hebrew Bible this word occurs only seven times in the Old Testament and and all seven all seven occurrences of this word calet or preacher are in this book the Hebrew word translated preacher means one who assembles or gathers a community or congregation a lecturer a preacher various modern dictionaries of English Define preacher to include one who gives a religious speech one who publicly proclaims the gospel perhaps for an occupation one who discourses publicly on religious subjects so Ecclesiastes is an address to gathering in this case the congregation or the community of Israel why was it written what is its theme or its topic vanity of vanities sayth the preacher vanity of vanities all is Vanity well what does vanity mean the word translated as vanity means Vapor futility meaningless pointless pointless futile says a preacher utterly meaningless nothing matters it's all Vapor everything is meaningless futile pointless what is everything all such a cheerful encouraging theme certainly a way to get our attention and you can wonder why people had a little bit of a struggle putting this in the collection of scriptures what profit hath a man of all his labor which he taketh Under the Sun what does Under the Sun mean basically means on Earth not geographically specific like Israel or Egypt or the Americas the imagery is toiling labor work under a hot summer sun most people in this era worked in agriculture subsistence farming very low yields you plant t and get 10 or 20 it just wasn't very productive God told Adam he'd live by the sweat of his brow in fact Ecclesiastes could be taken as a sermon expounding Genesis 3:19 and the sweat of thy face Thou shalt eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it was thou taken for dust Thou Art and unto dust shalt thou return back to Ecclesiastes continuing on one generation passes away and another generation comes but the Earth abides forever dust Thou Art andto dust shalt thou return The Sun Also Rises and The Sun Goes Down And hasten us to his place where he arose an endless cycle the wind goeth toward the South turneth about unto the north it whirle about continually and the wind returns again according to his circuits all the rivers run into the sea yet the sea is not full un the place once the rivers come thither they go again even nature is thwarted in its continual labors of trying to fill the ocean the sea is not satisfied at once ever more round and round it goes All Things Are full of Labor man cannot utter it that means everything is wearisome beyond description the eye is not satisfied with seeing it continues looking the ear nor the ear filled with hearing it it continues listening it's never satisfied the thing that hath been it is that which shall be and that which is done now is that which shall be done there's no new thing under the sun is there anything whereof it may be said see this is new it's been already of old time which was before us there is no remembrance of former things neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after we forgotten the past we'll be forgotten after we die that these 11 verses set the theme of the book A continual search for a change in the pattern of Life a weary unending round of work and toil only to end in the grave we really don't know our past and we'll become the Forgotten past to those who live in the future I remember a few years ago digging into some ancestry website records and taking a DNA test and so forth the result is I have the names of a few ancestors going back perhaps 250 to 300 years even at that level it's very incomplete and aart from their names I know nothing about them except when they were born maybe when they died perhaps where they may have lived what did they do were they happy or sad what was their life like in the place and times in which they lived did they fight in wars did they know know peace did they know the Lord I basically know nothing about my ancestors Beyond a generation or two and my descendants in a very few Generations will know nothing about me where I lived what I did who I loved how I behaved what I said who I helped who I hurt who I worshiped I recall when I was a vice president at modular mining systems here in Tucson a company I helped start occasionally going to my team of engineers in the early evening and telling them to go home many of them were working overtime and as salary people they didn't collect extra pay for that I was called on to the carpet about that by my partners and I explained to them that is important as the work was that we were doing and it was important we literally changed the face of the mining industry worldwide over a period of about 20 years that these people had families and they worked to support their families the families were more important than some arbitrary schedule none of my partners had children for them the company was their family and their life I would sometimes point out to my staff that they should keep in mind to not forget that The Cutting Edge Products that we were developing would be an amus Museum or a landfill in 20 or 30 years do a good job make a great product but don't make it the focus of your life keep a balanced approach to life we've covered the initial topic or heading of the book The assertion that all is futile like a vapor nothing is permanent nothing really changes or improves all our labor is in vain in the end we are where we started dust don't drop any hints like a rodent in a wheel running hard getting nowhere we really are getting nowhere aren't you little buddy there we go at least you think you're making progress the Apostle James wrote James 4:14 whereas you know not what shall be on the tomorrow for what is your life it is even a vapor it appear for a little time then vanishes away see you you you be still you be still you're disturbing things thank you it seems similar to what the preacher was saying other scriptures talk about the flower of grass that blooms and Withers but don't be discouraged stick around we'll see what's really being said I've collected a set of headings for the book of ecclesiast ases the first verses make the assertion that all is Vanity our efforts are pointless here today gone tomorrow that's what we just read the rest of chapter one and all of chapter 2 describe the futility of wisdom self-indulgence wise living and toil some examples the vanity of wisdom Ecclesiastes 1 16 I communed with my own heart saying lo I am come to Great Estate have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem y my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge I'm the smartest guy in the world the smartest guy that ever was I gave my heart to know wisdom and to know Madness and folly I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit it's just troubling unsettling for in much wisdom is much grief he that increases knowledge increases sorrow nothing made me happy the smarter I got the more depressed I became on the uselessness of self-indulgence Solomon brags on his riches his Vineyards his Landscaping the singers music Ecclesiastes do not so I was great and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem also my wisdom remained with me I was rich as well as smart and whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them I withheld not my heart from any joy for my heart rejoiced in all my labor and this was my portion of all my labor in other words I did whatever I wanted to do nothing stopped me then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought on the labor that I had labored to do and behold all was vanity vexation of spirit there was no profit Under the Sun it was all a temporary pleasure on living wisely Ecclesiastes 2:15 then said I in my heart as it happeneth to the fool so it happeneth even to me why was I then more wise then I said in my heart that this also is Vanity there's no remebrance of the wise more than of the fool forever seeing that that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten and how dieth the wise man as the fool dust to dust therefore I hated life because the work that is wrough under the sun here on Earth is Grievous unto me all is Vanity vexation of spirit regarding work y I hated all my labor which I had taken Under the Sun why because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool yet shall he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored minus the part the IRS takes and wherein I have showed myself wise Under the Sun this is also vanity think Rayo po First Kings 12 followed foolish advice greed self-indulgence and destroyed the kingdom therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labor which I took Under the Sun in other words I sank further into depression the next section the beginning of chapter 3 is sometimes called the weary round of life for me personally it is one of the most memorable portions of the book why sometimes there's a Confluence of events that cause me to shake my head in Wonder and realize the hand of God must have been at work for everyone I don't know for me definitely for many others highly likely in October 1965 of FK rock group released a song called turn turn turn by December 4 1965 it had reached number one of the top 100 hit songs that's the same date on which brother Brandon recorded the Rapture started the week of his final sermons things that are to be monored events made clear by prophecy leadership communion if you were a follower of his teachings I I wasn't at that time I'd never heard of William brandom and tuned into a radio station playing popular music during the week brother Brandon was hospitalized in Amarillo Texas until his death at Christmas Eve you would have heard this song the majority of the youth in America heard the song at that very time along with their parents and siblings I expect please turn in your Bibles to Ecclesiastes chapter 3 we'll read the lyrics of this number one song to everything there's a season a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born a time to die a time to plant a time to reap A Time to Kill a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh time to mourn and a time to dance a time to Cast Away stones and a time to gather Stones together a time to embrace time to refrain from embracing a time to get a time to lose a time to keep and a time to Cast Away a time to Rend and a time to swow a time to keep silence time to speak a time to love a time of hate a time of War a time of Peace the lyrics of the most played song of December 1965 are the King James version words of Ecclesiastes 3 1-8 in 1965 there was no internet no cable TV no cell phones you got your news and discover new music through the radio driving in your car you turned on the radio how often are the airwaves or information sources blanketed with scripture and with words that are so time appropriate God signaling a time of change and announcing it to the entire English-speaking world and Beyond by the way I'm not suggesting you listen to the song my point in mentioning it is to emphasize the timing how God can use anything he wants to serve his purposes to everything there's a season a time to every purpose under the heaven in the next short section Solomon starts to broaden his Horizon from the endless and futile cycle of life to a recognition of God's Eternal nature what profit hath he that worketh and that wherein he labor Earth I've seen their travail the task the burden which God ha given to the sons of men to be exercised in it to keep us occupied keep us busy Heath made everything beautiful in his time also he hath set the world in their heart so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end you got that verse might be a little clearer in another translation here it is from the complete Jewish Bible he has made everything suited to its time also he has given human beings an awareness of Eternity but in such a way that they can't fully comprehend from beginning to end the things God does I know there is no good in them there's nothing better for people but for a man to Rejoice be happy and to do good in his life also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labor it's the gift of God I I know that whatsoever God doeth it shall be forever in contrast with the transient nature of man's efforts nothing can be added to it nor anything taken from it and God doeth it why that men should fear before him that which hath been is now and that which is to be hath already been and God requireth that which is passed we sum that up and say history repeats itself more headings dust to dust man and beast alive the righteous and the wicked Evil Under the Sun chapter 4 includes a small set of proverbs better is a handful with quietness than both hands full accompanied with travail and vexation of spirit if one Prevail against him you shall withstand him and a three-fold chord is not quickly broken in unity we have strength Unity don't stand alone Unity Reach Out chapters five and six are again a short collection of short admonishments and observations and the form of Proverbs Ecclesiastes 51 keep thy foot guard your steps when thou goest to the house of God and be more ready to hear go to listen rather than to give the sacrifice of fools for they consider not that they do evil for and the multitude of dreams and many words are also also diverse vanities but instead fear the lord here we see the perspective of the preacher changing a bit he's included the fear of God not just the works and his observations in the context of our mortal life he goes on about other things and in verse 10 he says he that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver he that loveth abundance won't be satisfied with increase this is also vanity it's futile whatever your appetite it will never be satisfied it's never enough Ecclesiastes 612 for who knoweth what is good for a man in this life all the days of his vain pointless life which he after him under the sun the preacher again is frustrated by the fact of mortality and the uncertainty of the future of his efforts chapter 7 continues Solomon's proverb likee statements this time contrasting wisdom and Folly when you're reading these keep in mind the preacher is only only seeing futility in everything we do his measure of this is that when we die we take nothing with us and have no control over those who inherit what we leave behind this is a worldview that I suspect the Sadducees embraced they saw death as the end of our existence there was nothing Beyond like job's friends their perspective was that if you please God you'll be protected life will be good the gospel of prosperity if you don't do all of God's Commandments your short life will be full of misery and pain job surely you're a secret sinner the same line of reasoning if you're suffering it has to be punishment from God verse 14 of chapter 7 in the day of prosperity be joyful but in the day of adversity consider God also set one alongside the other to the end that man should find nothing after him in other words you can't discover what the future holds all things have I seen in the days of my vanity there's a just man that perishes in his righteousness and there's a wicked man that prolong us life in his righteousness it all seems so random and unfair but it's from the perspective persective of a short life might there be another Factor at play was God just being capricious more headings chapter 8 begins with the description of the power of a dictator using the example as a king this guy was a king he was a dictator so if you happen to be in a place that's run by dictators pay attention to that chapter it might help you the preacher then begins to speak of the fear of God Ecclesiastes 811 because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil keep getting away with stuff right though a sinner do evil a hundred times and his days be prolonged yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God which fear before him openly reverence show respect to him but it shall not be well with the wicked neither shall he prolong his days which are as a shadow because he feareth not before God think of the Judgment parable of Jesus in Matthew chapter 25 Solomon is admitting that there's something Beyond this life maybe It Isn't So pointless goes on and talks about how God's ways are unknowable that I beheld all the work of God that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun because though a man labor to seek it out he won't find it though A wise man think to know it yet shall he not be able to find it even the preacher was unable to understand it chapters 9 and 10 deal with these topics the universality of death spending quality time with your mate and then a lengthy section on why wisdom is better than Folly even though it is all futile some of these Proverbs perhaps many have cultural context it's not always clear to us and our time and place a simple example Ecclesiastes 10:2 a wise man's heart is at his right hand but a Fool's heart is at his left huh in The Sermon on the Mount Jesus shocked his audience when he said I say unto you that you resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek indicating he struck you with his left hand turn to him the other also there's this association with the right and the left equating evil with being hit on the right cheek I wondered about this in 2000 I traveled to Saudi Arabia to participate in a Space Project the culture they tracing back to ancient times in the Middle East is that you never ever eat or even touch food or almost anything else with your left hand putting it plainly you eat with your right hand you clean yourself with your left so the person hitting you on the right cheek with his left hand is insulting you in a very degrading way Jesus audience understood this symbology of the right and left the preacher audience and Ecclesiastes 10 to also understood my point is that some of these sayings are a bit pers per Excuse Me Maybe I need a drink yes eat drink and be satisfied yes some of these saying are a bit perplexing and we sometimes need to dig into the history and culture of the day the context to make sense of them moving on oh there was that I forgot to advance it chapter 11 starts with this rather strange thing cast thy bread upon the waters for Thou shalt find it after many days give a portion to seven and also to eight for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the Earth huh as a kid I thought this was weird I I remembered when I was about four years old or so sitting in the backyard where we had a little waiting pool that was probably about as big as this Pulpit maybe that deep and I was sitting out there with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and I dropped it into the waiting pool it just got soggy and it tasted really yucky afterward and then I thought well maybe bread in those days floated an axe had floated when the prophet threw some salt or something in the water so maybe maybe the tide would bring it back it's speaking of Investments if you ship your G your grain out for Commerce you may eventually get a return from it and giving a portion to seven or eight meant don't put all your eggs in one basket spread it out reduce the risk the evil that shall be upon the Earth brother brandom mentioned Ecclesiastes 111 many times sometimes in prayer sometimes s in the body of a sermon and it was often if not always in the context of the spiritual equivalent of investing in the context of you reap what you sow showing kindness to others I'll share one short paragraph part of a prayer from influence October 1962 may we mean this in our heart as we speak it Lord take a coal of fire of the Holy Ghost off the altar of Calvary touch each heart and lip tonight Lord that we speak no lies that we speak the truth take us tonight Lord just what we are all of us are not preachers all of us are not prophets all of us are not speakers with tongues all of us are not miracle workers but all of us have something to do show us where it is Lord Lord testify sing pray and like bread upon the Water it will return some Glorious Day Grant it Lord here we are send us to our neighbors to wherever we can to our fellow man tell them the coming of the Lord granted father the preacher starts to show us the reason that we should be wise and not foolish industrious not lazy Rejoice oh young man in thy Youth and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy Youth and walk in the ways of thine heart and and the sight of thine eyes but know thou that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment therefore remove sorrow from thy heart put away evil from thy flesh for childhood and youth or vanity Sadducees take note the preacher is speaking of judgment accountability for our actions is this during our life the days of our mortality the last headings the closing verses of the words of the preacher summarizes the book Ecclesiastes 12 7 then shall the dust return to the Earth as it was was he's speaking of death and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it ah Sadducees did you hear that after the body dies the spirit returns to God vanity of vanities all is Vanity we turn to dust pointless moreover because the preacher was wise he still taught the people knowledge yay he gave good heed and sought out and set in order many Proverbs as we read last week some 5,000 again telling us this is Solomon the preacher sought to find out acceptable words and that which was written was upright even words of truth skipping down to verse 13 the last two verses of this book let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man this applies to every person why for God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil there's so much in this book but a couple of things seem to underly all it says for one the preacher was at the center of his Universe I was the wisest person ever I was the richest person in Jerusalem I did whatever I wanted I built I planted I bought I I so I gave myself over to Hedonism seeking whatever fleshly pleasure I could imagine and the words of Frank Sinatra I did it my way I I I I I all is Vanity a world view centered on oneself if that's your perspective your foundation then no matter what you do what you obtain or attain it will never be enough your addictions will never be satisfied or ultimately satisfying what was the primary concern of the preacher why did he view everything as vanity Vapor meaningless futile it was in part because he couldn't control or even know his legacy he would die like everyone else and like everyone else he would be forgotten well he can say Solomon wasn't forgotten but but it's not really the point of the one or two names that come down through history what were the names of his wives his concubines can you name even one or his sons apart from rehoboam what happened to his Palace his Temple his kingdom his wealth his Pursuits became so disgusted and offensive that God called him on the carpet First Kings 11 we read King Solomon loved many strange women together with the daughter of pharaoh women of the moabites ammonites zidonians and Hittites of the Nations concerning which the Lord said to the children of Israel you shall not go to them neither shall they come in unto you for surely they will turn your heart after other gods Solomon clave unto these in love he had 700 wives princesses and 300 concubines and his wives turned away his heart for it came to pass when Solomon was old that his wives turned away his heart after other gods and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God as was the heart of David his father for Solomon not just his wives Solomon himself went after asht Toth the goddess of the zidonians and after milcom the abomination of the ammonites Solomon did evil in the sight of the Lord went not fully after the Lord as is David his father Solomon is worried in Ecclesiastes if his son will be wise or a fool seeming to forget that he was the son of his father and look what happened verse n the Lord was angry with Solomon because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel which had appeared unto him twice and had commanded him concerning this thing that he should not go after other gods but he kept not that which the Lord commanded wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon for as much as this is done of thee and thou Hast not kept my Covenant and my statutes which I have commanded Thee I will surely run the Kingdom from thee and will give it to thy servant notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father's sake but I will rent it out of the hand of thy son well it's it's easy to judge Solomon one of the beauties of the Bible is that it talks about our weaknesses as well as our strengths it's not a it's not a a Marvel comic book of superheroes it's people like you people like me I see some of these things in some of these people and I think what got into them and then I look in the mirror and then I say I know what God did to them yeah if the musicians would please come at this time we need to be careful seek the Lord serve him Solomon was an imperfect human same as me same as each of us what is another world viw not of self-centeredness and self-indulgence not depending on wisdom or knowledge or gain the one that the preacher concluded let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments it's the whole duty of man God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil Paul expressed it this way it'll be our closing set of verses and conclude our thoughts tonight on Ecclesiastes we started in the New Testament we should end in the New Testament right Colossians 3 whatsoever you do do it hard as to the Lord not unto men knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance for ye serve the Lord Christ but he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done there's no respect of persons whatever you do do it heartily as to the Lord and not unto man let's sing a song from Solomon's dad David as we turn the service over to brother Aaron and brother Daniel create in me a clean [Music] heart a clean heart God and renew a right Spirit Within Me cre me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit Within [Music] has me not away from thy presence oh Lord take not thy Holy Spirit for me [Music] restore onto me the joy of my salvation and we Spirit within me one more time create in me a oh God and renew a right Spirit Within [Music] Me me a clean heart oh God [Applause] and renew right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence oh [Music] Lord take God the Holy Spirit [Music] [Applause] are restore to me the of thy salvation and reew a right Spirit Within Me amen I believe that when a minister truly captures the spirit behind the original message that's written in the Bible that the brother ministering will be ministering in the same mood and in same atmosphere as the author when he wrote it as I say I say it many times I ask the Lord to let the Holy Spirit come down and may we receive the word in the same spirit that it was written and if you notice how brother ly tonight was was a somber mood it wasn't a happy joyous [Music] sermon study it was it's all it's all vanity what what means anything what's what's what is there in life it's all feudal as I believe the translation said doesn't matter and if you read the last the conclusion of the matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of a man for God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil imagine for the line of imagine if that's all we had that's the spirit of the law where the prophets would bring the message of condemnation and say that just like the author said here it's all feudal serve God and you'll do well sin and you'll answer for your sin but thank God that all of this built up to one man and when that man came that last message that Solomon said let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter that conclusion of the whole matter changed and now you can be forgiven for your sins no matter how much you have ever done you bring it to that Lord and that Savior and he'll wipe it away oh I I just I felt the spirit as brother L was ministering I I felt that feudal spirit it's like why should I how many times have we heard people say that well what good is it what's what what good is it to to change my ways what good is it to serve the Lord what good is it I believe uh they were um can't remember which one they were telling believe it was Peter it was Peter they said they said what are you doing they said everything's going along the same way as it always has and it's not going to change and Peter was steadfast he said no it is going to change the Lord Jesus is going to return and he's going to restore all these things and I I just I think if what if we just thinking about our friends brother L from from Israel and I know one day soon there's a promise that the Gospel of Jesus Christ is going to go to the Jews but I don't even I don't feel like I could live like that that there's not a savior that the Messiah they don't understand him but by the grace of God he came and he forgave our sins and now it's no more vanity it's no more more meaningless it's it's no more just a feudal attempt there is there is salvation there there is a change in our lives I am so grateful I am so grateful for Jesus Christ I mean that's like the understatement of the century sister surely but I am let's let's all stand I would ask congregation to uh to help me to do me a favor I um as brother ly was going through this I've been visiting a young man that's in prison he in jail over the past month or so and um you know how right before they're sentenced they allow people to read a letter brother brandom talked about he went to Houston um to uh to speak on behalf of someone that was in jail um and it was successful that man was far worse than this young man but would you pray with me that I can say the right words on Friday that if it would be the Lord's will that um this young man would receive not deserved but receive his freedom and I'd like to see him in this church um he's just got in with the wrong crowd but I I wish we could just empty out these prisons I wish we could change all of these homeless people we see walking around I wish just but you talk with them and it's this right here everything's feudal why should I yeah I I know that I know that God's real yeah I know he loves me and I know this but why if if I if I don't do my drugs I'm still homeless so let's just let's just pray let's bow our heads our heavenly father I thoroughly enjoyed this lesson tonight oh God I'm so grateful that this life isn't feudal as brother L quoted the Apostle James and he James said our our life is but a vapor but there's a work to do while we're here father that these lives won't just pass away but the things that we do to tonight than we do with our lives Lord we believe that it if you would T that it would carry on for generations to [Music] come Lord let us be strong Christians strong in the faith that these lives are not feudal that they're not vanity but Lord that they would make a difference help us father I thank you very much for the word tonight pray that it would stay in our hearts father that you would bless all that we here go before us Lord May we surrender to you and give our lives over to you and then father may your Holy Spirit come in and then guide us and use us and then may we be bold in preaching your gospel granded father we thank you for your love to us in Jesus name amen at what time will you be did all the time I don't know

Ecclesiastes it's beautiful am it is as brother and brother L and I have been teaching it's one of the poetical books which usually means you can just open it up you can jump right in and where wherever you're at you're going to get some wisdom and you're going to get something that that'll be a blessing to you I uh again I I thoroughly enjoyed it tonight I pray that the Lord will be with each and every one of you brothers and sisters never never stop thanking God for his son Jesus Christ and for what he did and Calvary because no matter what happens in our life no matter how bad things get no matter how your world might seem like it comes down upon you there is always hope in Christ and he has made I mean he has made a way for people that are in a lot that have been in a lot worse situations than any of us have been so let me tell you something make sure you are thanking the Lord for all that he's done for us that we do have hope now and I would never I appreciate the Book of Ecclesiastes I I love it I read it it's one of my favorite books in the whole Bible and it just makes me love the Lord Jesus even more because I see that no there it's not just judgment there's not just a judgment there I have somebody that's going to go in front of me and he's going to be judged for me because if I have to be judged I don't think I'm going to make it because my life has I failed before but there was a sinless spotless Lamb of God that stands between us and a wrathful God and and he won the victory for us God bless you brothers and sisters brother Aon you have one
