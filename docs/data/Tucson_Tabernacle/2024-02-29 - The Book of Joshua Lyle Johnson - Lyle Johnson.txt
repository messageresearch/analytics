actually it might be but anyway uh let's see if we can get this first slide up here yeah there we are so and and that song I really appreciate the effort that the Peterson family plus one put into that's all song that was just uh just wonderful it made me decide I'd [Applause] better I better get rid of my notes and talk about Joshua tonight instead the the mound that you see here in this picture is the modern day ruins of the place they sang about Jericho now we've covered an overview of the Torah the five books written by Moses we move on now to the next group of 13 books in the order that our Christian bibles are organized these are the his the histories Joshua Judges Ruth 1 and 2 Samuel 1 and 2 Kings 1 and 2 Chronicles Ezra Nehemiah Esther job there's no test but that's what's next and gives you a preview of what's coming tonight got your track shoes on we're going to Sprint through Joshua we're going to get an overview of its contents there's going to be a lot of reading but before we do let's pray once again again to the one who inspired the unknown and unnamed author of this book lord Jesus we are so grateful that we can be gathered here this evening thank you Lord for these people that have come each of us that are here Lord because it's the last week of the year it's the last Wednesday we have in 2023 to tell you that we love you to tell you that we care to tell you how much you mean to us Lord forgive us where we have fallen short today Lord and let our hearts just draw together and draw dra to your word and draw from it what you have for us this evening Lord you you put it there for a purpose and you put it there for a purpose for us tonight in this place we thank you Lord and we thank you and we thank you again in Jesus precious name Amen in the simplest summary this book covers Israel's history During the period from the death of Moses to the incomplete conquest of Canaan under Joshua and the apportionment of the lands to to the various ancestral lineages of Jacob's sons as a person Joshua is is an inspiring story Moses faithful servant and follower the one who wholeheartedly believes in trusting the Lord's word becomes a new leader the rise of Joshua yahoshua in Hebrew the same name as Jesus thus parallels the one that we know as Jesus Moses commissioned Joshua to lead the people was recorded in Deuteronomy 31:7 Moses called unto Joshua and said unto him in the sight of all Israel be strong and of a good courage for thou must go with his people unto the land which the Lord has sworn unto their fathers to give them and thou shalt cause them to inherit it and the Lord he it is that death go before thee he will be with thee he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not neither be dismayed Paul recounts an early victory in the conquest as he shares examples of faith in Hebrews 11 we read in verse 30 by faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days somewhat sadly the Book of Joshua also records the planting of the seeds of fulfillment of the prophecy Moses recorded in Deuteronomy 31 and 32 a prophecy of failure and ultimate ejection from Canaan also in the same portion of Deuteronomy as Joshua's commission we read in verse 16 of chapter 31 the Lord said unto Moses behold Thou shalt sleep with thy fathers and this people will rise up and go whing after the gods of the strangers of the land whether they go to be among them and will forsake me and break my Covenant which I have made with them Paul addressing the Galatians Echoes the lesson of Joshua to his contemporaries some 1500 years later in Galatians 5 we read starting at verse 7 you did run well who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you but pointing to one of the root causes in galatia and as we'll discover in the Book of Joshua he summarizes a little 11 Levens the whole lump like the story starting with the Exodus Joshua shows that strong Godly leadership is necessary but by itself insufficient we each regardless of our gifts or calling must possess faith and once possessing it we must exercise it Joshua is not simply a history it's a warning that speaks to us across centuries and Millennia please be seated we can sometimes look at that at being a little kind of sad about the future failures that happen but you know the Jewish people say that the the five books of Moses were written to bring the law so that they could uh please God if you will but but really I think when you look at the end of Deuteronomy and where Moses is talking about the failure what they're really doing what God is really doing is not bringing them to the law he's trying to bring them through the law to The Ultimate Gift the ultimate Grace the ultimate recognition that we have to try we have to do all that we can but we can't depend on what we do we have to depend on him I should get back to my notes we're going to run out of time The Book of Joshua can be thought of as having three components the first is a narrative of the physical movements of the people the the battles with the Canaanites and so forth the second component is geographic it describes a division of the land including the internal borders between the various Clans or or tribes this includes a listing of the pasture lands and towns for the Levites scattered throughout the territory as well as Cities of Refuge the land a gift from God is divided by lot similarly the gifts of the Spirit in our lives are at the Lord's discretion we don't get to pick and choose he's not a tool in our toolbox we're Tools in his toolbx the third part is a warning and encouragement to trust in the Lord and to keep the faith a heads up here Joshua is full of violence we look on it 7500 miles miles away and 3,400 years later as as a type or as a lesson but for the people in Canaan at that time it was not symbolic it was horrific it was physical it was real for each Victory mentioned there were terrible consequences for those over whom the victory was won if nothing else Joshua should help us truly appreciate the grace of God in our lives and the blessing we have to be Here and Now rather than there and then at least I'm grateful for that Joshua has a total of 24 chapters if you listen to the voice message this morning our pastor read to us a large chunk of uh of one of the last of those chapters so we'll be able to save a little time this evening because we've all remembered exactly what he said when you listen to that this morning but we'll proceed through each of these chapters reading from some summarizing others be aware that the chapters and the events described in them are often not in chronological order often can be confusing starting what a good place to start Joshua how about 1 one now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spoke unto Joshua the son of nun Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all the people unto the land which I do give them even to the children the descendants of Israel skipping to verse 5 there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of a good courage For unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them skipping to verse nine have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whether soever thou goest multiple words of encouragement and repeated strong courageous Fearless the Lord is with thee now we just read verse 9 the entirety of chapter 2 Falls between verses 9 and 10 chronologically but we'll just go ahead and read 10 and then we'll get into chapter 2 here pretty quick then after the events recorded in Chapter 2 Joshua commanded the officers of the people saying pass through the host command the people saying prepare you victuals for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan and go in to possess the land which the Lord your God giveth you to possess it Jos josua then reminds the descendants of Reuben God and Manasseh whose land grant was east of the Jordan that they promised to help their relatives secure the territory west of the Jordan they renew their pledge to do so and in chapter two we read Joshua the son of nun sent out to shittum two men to spy secretly saying go view the land even Jericho and they went and came unto an harlot's house named Rahab and lodged there and verse four the woman took the two men and hid them and when questioned as they hid said thus to the local authorities who were inquiring did you see these two guys there came men unto me but I didn't know where they were from skipping to verse n and after she misdirected the authorities which left she said unto the men I know that the Lord hath given you the land and that your terror is Fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you for we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt and what you did un the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side Jordan Sion and OG whom he utterly destroyed as soon as we heard these sayings our hearts melted neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the Lord you your God he is God in heaven above and in Earth beneath she extracts a promise that she'll be protected when Israel attacks Jericho and the spies replied in verse 18 behold when we come into the land Thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread representing danger safety through atonement in the window which thou did let us down by and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother and thy brethren and all thy father's household home unto thee and it shall be when we attack and capture this city that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be Guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon him and furthermore if thou utter if you warn anyone about our business then we'll be free of this oath with which you've made us to Swear to protect you and she said according to your words so be it and she sent them away and they departed and she bound the Scarlet line in the window and they went and came unto the mountain and Abode there three days until the pursuers the folks that were out looking for them had returned the pursuer sought them throughout all the way but found them not so the Two Men return turned descended from the mountain came to Joshua the son of nun and told them all things that befell them they said unto Joshua truly the Lord hath delivered into our hands all the land for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us in chapter three the nation crosses the Jordan River from the East to the West at verse 7 we read the Lord said unto Joshua this day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel that they may know that as I was with Moses so I will be with thee Thou shalt command the priests that bear the Ark of the Covenant saying when ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan ye shall stand still in Jordan and now Joshua instructs the congregation skipping to verse 13 he's telling them it shall come to pass as soon as the souls of the feet of the priests that bear the Ark of the Lord the Lord of all the the Earth shall rest in the waters of Jordan that the Waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above and they shall stand upon a heap verse 17 the priests that bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan and all the Israelites were passed clean over Jordan now in Exodus after crossing the Red Sea they sang and danc the song of Moses was so inspired that in the Book of Revelation we read that they sing it but this time the time of crossing the Jordan the flood the spring of the year they don't sing and dance they build a memorial each tribe provides a male representative and in Joshua 4:4 we read then Joshua called the 12 men whom he had prepared of the children of Israel out of every tribe a man Joshua said unto them pass over before the Ark of the Lord your God into the midst of Jordan and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel this may be a sign among you when your children asked their fathers in time to come in the future saying what's with these rocks what do you mean by these Stones you shall answer them the Waters of the Jordan were cut off before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord when it passed over Jordan the Waters of Jordan were cut off notice you may not recognize this but this is a form of Hebrew poetry when something is said and then it's same thing is said again slightly differently you'll find these kind of couplets in in many places and it's as I say it's a form of Hebrew poetry and it's wonderful in a way because it doesn't depend upon rhyming in pentameter and that so when you translate it into other languages it still retains that same format that same Beauty and these Stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel forever now brother Daniel I think when Joshua was looking for guys he didn't say let's find a 73 year old guy to carry this Boulder I think he I think they got Daniel Jr and and other folks like him because this wasn't to be Pebbles this wasn't to be stones these were to be Boulders these were to be a burden they were to show the the the work and the turmoil and the travail they were a testimony they were a testimony just like two and a half weeks ago we had a testimony service here many of those testimonies were of many of you that have come through some pretty rough places carrying those Boulders on your shoulder to stack them up as a testimony as a witness and that's exactly what they did here the children of Israel did as Joshua commanded took up 12 Stones Out of the midst of Jordan as the Lord spoke unto Joshua according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel and carried them over with them into the place where they lodged and they laid them down there Joshua didn't stop there Joshua set up what another 12 Stones in the midst of Jordan in the place where the feet of the priests which bear the Ark of the C stood and at the time the book was written the author says and they are there unto This Day verse 14 on that day the Lord magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel and they feared that word there means revered were in awe of him as they feared Moses all the days of his life he didn't give them a reason to not unlike with Moses who stretched out his staff over the Red Sea the Jordan opened when the feet of the priests carrying the ark touched the water the waters returned when the priest's feet came to the normal Shoreline of the river and we read and the people came up out of Jordan on the 10th day of the first month and encamped in gilgal and the east border of Jericho so they're between Jericho and the river that's a distance of about six miles between the walls of Jericho and the Jordan River and these 12 Stones which they took out of Jordan did Joshua pitch did he place in gilgal so we now come to chapter five you recall when we studied the book of Acts I mentioned that the people falsely accusing Paul of teaching against circumcision of Jewish Believers being a violation of the law of Moses that they could have picked a better example and here's why Joshua 5:2 at that time the Lord said unto Joshua make the sharp knives and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time that is circumcise this second generation this new generation and this is the cause this is the reason why Joshua did circumcise all the people that came out of Egypt that were males even all the men of War died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of Egypt now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt them they had not circumcised and their children whom he raised up in their stead them Joshua circumcised for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the way 40 years under Moses 40 years Moses was disobeying the law of Moses if we want to take how the people in Acts were talking about it with all the Revelation that came they didn't practice this fundamental institution I I find that amazing the Lord said unto Joshua look how important this was to the Lord this day have I rolled away the reproach the shame the stigma of Egypt from off you this right was that important to the Lord as he told Abraham the same thing when he instituted it wherefore because of this the name of the place is called gilgal unto this day gilgal is derived from the word that means wheel and it means rolling this day I have rolled away the reproach and the reminder of that is the name of the camp remember in chapter 4 we read it was the 10th day of the first month when they crossed the Jordan now on the 14th day they observe the Passover in the land the next day the Mana stops we're told in verse 13 and came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against that means opposite near in in in front of him with his sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto him and demanded of him are you for us or for our adversaries and he said nay but as a captain of the host of the Lord am I now come and Joshua fell on his face to the Earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my Lord unto his servant and the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua loose off thy shoe from off thy foot the place whereon thou standest is Holy and Joshua did so brother bradam tells us that Joshua met Jesus that in chapter six we read now Josh now Jericho was straightly shut up because of the children of Israel none went out none came in the Lord said unto Joshua see I have given unto thine hand Jericho and the King thereof and all the Mighty Men of Valor and you shall compass that means encircle the city all ye Men of War and go round about the city once thus shalt thou do six days days and seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams horns and the seventh day you shall Compass the city seven times and the P priests shall blow with the trumpets and it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast with the Rams Horn and when you hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall Shout with a great shout exactly what the song said this evening and the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall send up every man straight before him well they did that in verse 20 we read so the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people heard people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell down flat so that the people went up into the city every man straight before him and they took the city now those of you sitting in the back you might want to bring your binoculars a little late tonight so squint or move forward this is a drawing from the excavation that was done Jericho back around 1950 and uh you can see this is what what it looked like at the time just a lot of dirt but when they got rid of that dirt that was on the level they found that there was a fallen wall it wasn't knocked down from the outside pushed in it fell down it fell out and there was a second wall around Jericho and it also fell down flat huh interesting the Bible says you dig in the right place and you find it it's there it's there I recently acquired a book Exodus route restored I was going to bring it out here but it's big and heavy and I I would have had to put it on my shoulder it provides an in-depth examination of the archaeology of The Exodus under Moses and the subsequent Conquest under Joshua now there's no archaeology that can say yeah trumpets were blown or people shouted but the archaeology can show that the walls fell down outward let's read on Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country go into the harlot's house and bring out then the woman and all that she hath as she SAR unto her and the young men that were spies went in and brought out Rahab and her father and her mother and her Brethren and all that she had unlike all those people in Noah's day more people listen to Rahab and they brought out all her Kindred and left them without outside the camp of Israel and they burnt the city with fire and all that was therein well I know that these are a little bit hard to see but the guy on that side at the far end of the screen with a red shirt he's showing that here's these pots big big ceramic pots and what's in them seeds that had been burned burnt seeds there's evidence of the fire but the amazing thing here is that this shows that Jericho didn't give in after a lengthy Seas the people starving to death and all the rest of the things that happened in Warfare in those days they had plenty of food they had plenty of food no it the walls fell down when they blew the trumpet and when they shouted there was food there was everything they needed in the city it wasn't a Siege it was an instantaneous Victory and the archaeology demonstrates that 3,400 years later it's there as a witness and Joshua saved Rahab the Harlot alive and her father's household and all that she had and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day because she hid The Messengers which Joshua was sent to spy out Jericho Paul refers to this also in Hebrews 11:31 by faith the Harlot Rahab perished not with them that believe not when she had received the slies with peace and not only that we read in the list of the ancestors of of Jesus adoptive parents and Matthew as the children did so wonderfully this last Sunday morning I'll do it in the NIV to make it a little clearer talking about this lineage it says salmon was the father of Boaz whose mother was Rahab yeah this Rahab the Harlot a Canaanite a woman of Jericho Boaz was a father of OED whose mother was Ruth of Moab two of the only three women that are mentioned in the genealogies of Jesus adoptive parents and the only two that are mentioned by name the third one not mentioned by name was basba OED the father of Jesse Jericho wasn't just an important gateway to the land it contained an extremely important person a woman at whom we might look a scance but whom God looked upon with great favor we must be very very careful how we see and treat not only each other but everyone we find in chapter 7 that when the city of AI was attacked the army of Israel suffered losses and retreated they they discovered that a young soldier named achen had taken some things from the city of Jericho that he had been told not to touch his punishment was severe I think we all know that he and his family and everything he had were destroyed and the Disobedience was eradicated so it's important not just to seek the will of the Lord but once having it shown to us to follow in it Aon knew the will of the Lord was for him to not take that he disobeyed once this was dealt with Joshua led the forces of Israel to victory over AI as recorded in chapter 8 after the victory we read then Joshua built an altar unto the Lord God of Israel and mount Abal as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded the children of Israel as it is written in the book of the law of Moses an altar of whole Stones over which no man have lifted up any iron that's Exodus 20:24 which you remember because we studied Exodus and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the Lord and sacrificed peace offerings the background in this slide is the archaeological site of an altar on Mount Abal believed to include that of Joshua it's been excavated in the last archaeologists have been there Excavating and sifting through things and they found some pretty amazing things starting about 2016 I think it's all very recent stuff the more the skepticism arises the more the Lord raises up a standard through science through faith through every Dimension that you can think of of human activity his witness is there it's consistent and it's true and he Joshua wrote thereon upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel Deuteronomy 27 we also discover in Deuteronomy that this altar Moses said when you build this altar in this place covered in plaster well makes it possible to write if it's covered in plaster otherwise it's just rocks that you've picked up it all fits together and all Israel and their elders and officers and their judges stood on this side of the Ark and on that side before the priests the Levites which be the Arc of the Covenant of the Lord as well as a stranger as he that was born among them half of them over Mount against Mount girisim half of them over against Mount ebal as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded before that they should Bless the people of Israel that's Deuteronomy 11 and Deuteronomy 27 and afterward he Joshua read all the words of the law the blessings and cursings according to all that is written in the book of the law one of the things that they found in this site at Mount eel is some lead uh tablets that are kind of folded up but they contain cursings of the god of Israel in chapter nine the leaders of the cities of gibian jeffa Barth and kth yum pretended to be from an unnamed far country they're good actors maybe they were from the Hollywood of their day I'm not sure and Joshua and the princes of the congregation made an agreement with them to not kill them they then find out that these Travelers are in fact from the local area that God through Moses and Deuteronomy told them to annihilate they became bond bondmen in modern terms slaves to Israel then in chapter 10 now it came to pass when Adon zc adoni is is means Lord basically and zedek is is righteous or holy so this guy's title is is I'm I'm a righteous Lord king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai and had utterly destroyed it as he had done to Jericho and her King so he had done to Ai and her King and how the inhabitants of gibian had made peace with Israel and were among them that they feared greatly because gibian was a great city is one of the Royal cities because it was greater than Ai and all the men thereof were Mighty and now they're in League with Israel wherefore ad onedc king of Jerusalem son unto ham it's not ham it's ham king of heon and unto Pam king of yut and unto yafia king of leish and unto deil king of Egon and and Kings here are more like city managers or or Mayors today is like he sent to the to the king of Oro Valley and the king of South south Tucson and the king of Sarita okay so these are cities they're not countries as we think of countries and kings and he said to them come up unto me and help me that we may Smite gibian for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel I'm glad you brought your binoculars so we see here this red line in this map that's towards the outside wall there that's the route that Joshua takes from gilgal up to gibian which is circled in red and he surprises the Army assembled against gibian we read about two Miracles associated with with these battles one is that the Lord gives him a great Victory with more of the Enemy being destroyed by giant hailstones a massive desert hail storm we live in the desert how often do we have hail that's big enough to hit you and kill you it's a miracle it's unusual more were killed by giant hailstones than by the Army led by Joshua the city circled in yellow are the cities where the five kings were that came to destroy gibian again gibian circled in red if you can't see that map very well we got lots of seats in the front Okay I placed a rectangle on the other map which is modern borders and modern territories to show you uh where this other one is zoomed in in front to give you an idea where this particular campaign was fought in blue I circled I alone this is where the second Miracle occurs while they're fighting we read that the sun over gibian and the Moon Over the Valley of Ione Stood Still for about a day by the way you may have heard about oh there's a computer simulation they did at Nasa at Caltech and it shows that there's a day that's missing or almost a day and there's 20 minutes that's missing those reports are not true you can look it up you can research it you can contact NASA or jet propulsion labri Caltech if you want or you can take my word for it those reports are not true there's controversy over what does this actually mean the the the Hebrew word Dam has many meanings to stop also means to cease to forbear to hold peace to quiet self to us to be silent uh to stand still to chry to wait so we don't know the the mechanism by which God performed this miracle but we do know that whatever it was it was miraculous and we read in the New Testament of another Supernatural occurrence in the valley of Iowa did you know what it was nobody's raising their hand okay I'll tell you then Luke 24 we read behold two of them that went that same day to a village called Deus which was from Jerusalem about three score fur belongs it's located in The Descent to the valley of ion and they talked together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they commun together and reasoned that the miraculous happened again in the valley of Ione and Jesus himself Drew near and went with them a personal note brother Arie May recognize this this is a painting that was done by Brother Steve schwitzer about 45 years ago of of a mon are the large building that you see there that was built about a 100 years ago when we lived in Israel nearly 50 years ago my oldest brother Paul and his family lived there helping to repair it to restore it in fact his youngest daughter was born in that building and her name is Iona because she was born in IO and and the foreground of this painting you can see a little bit of an arch and whatnot is the ruins of a fourth Century Church complete with Mosaic floors and believed by some to be the site of the building in biblical emus where Jesus broke bread brother Arie you may recall we had communion in one of the upper rooms of that building with brother Green in 1976 in the ruins there's a baptistry indicating that baptism by immersion was the practice at that time okay back to Joshua chapter 11 we read of a northern campaign of Conquest West again the same thing a rectangle in the modern map showing you what's going on in the other map uh I'll tell you what's on the map um it's it's it's various battles that are described in chapter 11 and while it's a little bit hard to see and I apologize for that because I I got this map from uh from a program that made it hard to make things Bolder but in any event you'll notice that most of the fighting most of the things that are going on here the red is the path of the children of Israel the blue is the path of the of the bad guys if you will that uh that these battles occur in the Hill Country what they're conquering is the Hill Country when you get down by the by the shorelines uh there's not too much activity going on there well chapter 12 lists the kings of the various cities and territories defeated under the commands of Moses and of Joshua in chapter 13 there's a Flash Forward in time and we learn verse one now Joshua was old and stricken in years and the Lord said unto him Thou Art old and stricken in years I I I love this can you see the humor here Joshua I'm going to reveal something to you my friend you're old and stricken in years and and and and you can just say you're old you don't have to say you're stricken in years right Hebrews a very compact language and it's expensive to to write things down so to take the time to write this and to write it twice I just think God has a wonderful sense of humor I I read this and I just well I did more than chuckled Thou Art old and stricken in years and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed the extensive territories that remain are then listed the territory east of the Jordan is listed where the descendants of Reuben manasse and Gad were given under Moses here's a pop quiz for you it's the descendants of Reuben manasse and Gad what do those three guys share in common okay they're all firstborns they're all firstborn son Ruben is the firstborn of Leah Manasseh is the firstborn of Joseph who was the firstborn of Rachel and Gad is the firstborn of Zila who was uh Leia as slave okay that was just a pop quiz you're not going to be graded it's fine but there's a warning sign that gets flashed in verse 13 nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the gites nor the maites but the gites and the maites dwell among the Israelites under this day this is in the land east of the Jordan This is while they were still under the leadership of Moses incomplete chapter 14 starts the process of dividing the land both conquered and still to be conquered among the descendants of Jacob and Joseph at the start of this there's something that we learned but but notice that they're dividing the land even though they haven't conquered it yet it's part of the territory that's described I think that speaks to Faith but let's there's a little bit of a surprise it was a surprise to me in Joshua 14 at verse 6 we're going to learn a little bit bit of something here and the thing we're going to learn I'll make it easy for you is that this these campaigns these battles after they crossed over from Jericho until they stopped fighting was about seven years that's a long time to be fighting but seven years Joshua lived for decades after they crossed the Jordan but they stopped fighting after seven years the children of Judah came unto Joshua in gilgal and Caleb the son of jhuna the kenite now now some people say well well he was a mixed multitude guy or he wasn't Jewish or something but but when they're picking the 12 Spies earlier back in numbers to go into the land and and check and and see what's going on and the 12 guys come back and Joshua and Caleb say we can take the land and the other 10 guys persuade people that they can't that Caleb is the representative of the tribe of Judah he is a major guy in the tribe of Judah so he his dad would jauna and the the kenite doesn't mean that he's from some place called Kenny and therefore he's a kenite it just it has something to do probably with where he was from but probably in Egypt because he'd been in Egypt for 4 something years they hadn't been in Canaan anyway calb came and said unto him thou knowest the thing the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee and Kadesh barnea 40 years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from KES barnea to spy out the land and now behold the Lord has kept me alive as he said these 45 years ever since the Lord spake this word unto Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo I am this day four score and five years old excuse me so he's age 85 it's 45 years after being a spy they want wandered for about 38 years after that uh uh rejection of going into the land at that time so that leaves about seven years for the conquest of Canaan now some people do the math and say well it's six years because it was this month and that month and other people say well no it was really eight years seven years plus or minus now therefore give me this mountain where of the Lord spake in that day and Joshua blessed him and gave unto Caleb the son of jauna heon fore an inheritance Hein therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of jauna the kenite unto this day because that he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel the name of hrin before was cirat arba which means settlement or Community number four and the land had rest from war so at age 885 of Caleb they stopped the fight so this map shows in Salmon I guess that's the right color to describe that as being uh the territory the approximate borders the region of the territory that they that they conquered but their territory that their promise goes all the way to the Sea so a lot of that white area between the Mediterranean and that salmon colored area is land that is supposed to be theirs but they didn't take so under Joshua the hill country was bacon some of the Southern desert and the Jordan Valley but the campaign ended with large portions of the divided territory still in the control of the Canaanite population why is that I'll give you a lead in when we when we get to the first part of the Book of Judges you may hear about that that why that was which would be next Wednesday approximately or we may not hear so you might want to go ahead and read chapter 15-8 continue describing the borders within the division of the land land and in chapter 18 we read the whole Congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh and set up the Tabernacle of the congregation there and the land was subdued before them the background of this slide is the archaeological dig now occurring in Shiloh this is where the Tabernacle was pitched this is where the ark resided when we get to the book of Samuel Samuel served under the priest there at the Tabernacle at Shiloh this is that very spot the ark was moved to Shiloh about 1399 BC it remained there acting as a de facto capital of Israel certainly its spiritual center for over 300 years until the Philistines capture it around 1094 BC Shiloh is located about 20 miles north of Jerusalem chapter 19 concludes the land division among the tribes and 19 ends these are the inheritances which elaser the priest and Joshua the son of nun and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the Lord at the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation so they made an end of dividing the country so when we see in uh acts: 126 where the disciples cast lots to to choose a replacement for judas's carriot they were following a long established practice so here what I've done is I've taken a a modern map on the one side and in the middle the approximate division of the territories among the tribes and you'll see that different Maps will show things a little bit different but it gives you the general idea and even if you had binoculars you probably couldn't read the labels of all that but that's not what's so terribly important what I wanted to also put in there the black lines that I put in show you the borders of modern Israel and the red lines show you the Palestinian territories the West Bank and Gaza just to give you an idea of the things you see in the news today and what's going on and how that fits into the into the Book of Joshua how it fits into things today you know it's it's interesting that we read about something that's 3,400 years ago and then we turn on the news today and you see exactly the same places and exactly the same struggles and exactly the more things go on the more they seem to not really change that much anyway I just wanted to give you that I that idea of context and and again this shows the territories of uh divided on the one side versus the territory they actually conquered on the other side so you can see that uh way over here the purple going up on that edge is ashers territory he uh he's going to have a hard time living there because they they didn't conquer that and a big chunk of what's called West manasse uh a large chunk of Dan big piece of Judah they uh they've got some work ahead of them so I think there's another lesson in there that that we can take and that is to be strong to be encouraged and to press on Don't Stop Don't Stop chapter 20 identifies six Cities of Refuge this is for protection of one accused of murder but more likely guilty of what we would think of as manslaughter it becomes a safe place to act as a temporary place to stay until he or she may stand trial this is a major advancement in criminal justice distinguishing between causes of death as opposed to the social status of the accused and the deceased Joshua 20 the Lord also spake unto Joshua saying speak to the children of Israel saying appoint out for you Cities of Refuge whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses that the Slayer that kth any person unaware bears and unwittingly May flee thither and they shall be your Refuge from the Avenger of blood and when he that doth flee unto one of these cities shall stand at the entering in of the Gate of the city and shall declare his cause in the ears of the Elders of that City they shall take him into the city unto them and give him a place that he may dwell among them and if the Avenger of blood pursue after him then they shall not deliver the Slayer up into his hand because he smote his neighbor unwittingly and hated him not Before Time hate crimes that's something that we hear about a lot today and he shall dwell in that city until he stand before the congregation for judgment and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days then shall the Slayer return and come into his own City and unto his own house unto the city from whence he fled excuse me please so this map I've circled in red the Cities of Refuge I realize you probably can't read them but you can see that they're scattered throughout the territory three on the east side of Jordan three on the west side of Jordan the one in the middle on the west side is a city of sheam which plays a big role in in in many things here in uh this portion of the Old Testament uh now they're not close together if you happen to be unlucky enough to have accidentally killed your neighbor and you're halfway between those places you're going to have to almost run a marathon you've got you got to cover 20 miles before the people that are mad at you can catch up to you okay that was supposed to be a little bit of humor sorry in chapter 21 a total of 48 cities and their surrounding pasture lands are divided out amongst the priest and Levites from the various Clans territories that's what we were talking about the other day about uh um in uh in in in Samuel where Hannah yeah Dad yeah yeah okay that's something private revealed publicly so when we get to the fir the book of 1 Samuel uh you've got a clue that that there's something interesting coming up okay um in chapter 22 we see that people are often prone to think the worst about others it's a warning to us to be careful how we View and especially how we interpret the actions of others Joshua 22 verse one then Joshua called the reubenites and the gadites and the halft tribe of Manasseh and said unto them you have kept all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you and have obeyed my voice and all that I commanded you You' have not left your brethren these many days unto this day but have kept the charge of the Commandment of the Lord your God and now the Lord your God hath given rest unto your brethren as he promise them therefore now return ye and get you into your tents and unto the land of your possession which Moses the servant of the lord gave you on the other side Jordan but take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the Lord charged you to love the Lord your God and to walk in all his ways and to keep his Commandments and to cleave unto him and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul it's good advice to all of us so Joshua blessed them and sent them away and they went into their tents so far so good as they turn into their inheritance we get to verse 10 when they came unto the borders of Jordan that are in the land of Canaan the children of Reuben and Gad and Hal tribe manaza built there an altar by Jordan a great altar to see too and the children of Israel heard say behold the children of Reuben the children of G and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an over an altar over against the land of Canaan in the borders of Jordan at the passage of the children of Israel uhoh when the children of Israel heard of it the whole Congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh to to go up to war against them go to war these guys had just been their brothers and arm standing shoulder toosh shoulder and putting their lives on the line for seven long and dangerous years but the instant they hear of others even close Associates doing something that's not according to their interpretation of way they thought the prophet had said their Revelation they want to excommunicate them in this case to go to war to kill them fortunately they're willing to communicate before they knock their arrows and their bows the leaders of the various PL Clans came first to those whose lands were east of the Jordan and said in verse 16 thus saith the whole Congregation of the Lord what trespass is this that you have committed against the god of Israel to turn away this day from following the Lord and that ye have build it an altar that you might Rebel this day against the Lord we've got our altar in Shiloh what do you do in building an altar down here remember an altar is made of uncut Stones so this is an effect carefully arranged pile of rocks it's not unlike the 12 Stones stacked in nearby gilgal or the Joshua placed in the midst of the Jordan River as memorials or reminders When Future Generations would ask what this group of rocks means and the ones moving back across Jordan declared in verse 26 guys you got it wrong therefore we said let us now prepare to build us an altar not for burnt offering nor for sacrifice but it may be a witness a testimony between us and you and our Generations after us that we might do the service of the Lord before him with our burnt offerings and with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings that your children may not say to our children in time come you have no part in the Lord you live over on that side of the river we live on the better side of the river you're on the wrong side of the tracks you can't be part of us therefore said we that it shall be when they should say to us or to Our Generations and times to come that we may say again behold the pattern of the altar of the Lord which our fathers made not for burnt offerings nor for sacrifices but it's a witness between us and you not against us between us God forbid that we should rebel against the Lord and turn this day from following the Lord to build an altar for burnt offerings meat offerings or sacrifices beside the altar of the Lord Our God that is before his Tabernacle in Shiloh and when pinkas the priest and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him heard the words that the children of Ruin and the children of G and the children of Manassa spoke it pleased them go Gosh guys we misunderstood their motive we misunderstood and fellowship is restored we must not be quick to judge others or impute the intent behind their actions we should always we should always seek understanding often we react based on limit and perhaps inaccurate information guilty we need to respond with love not accusation we need to be circumspect not jump to conclusions we need to go to the source not second or third hand information rumor gossip Snapchat Facebook Instagram X social media no moving on to chapter 23 the second to last chapter Joshua addresses the leaders of isra Israel towards the end of his life and it came to pass a long time after that the Lord had given rest unto Israel from their enemies round about so this is years later that Joshua waxed old and stricken in age Joshua called for all Israel for their Elders their heads their judges their officers and said unto them I am old and stricken an age and you have seen all the Lord your God hath done unto thee all these nations because of you for the Lord your God is he that hath fought for you he goes on to rehearse many many of the things that they have witnessed and experienced verse 11 take good heed therefore unto yourselves that you love the Lord your God else if you do in any wise go back and cleave unto the remnant of these nations even these that remain among you and shall make marriages with them and go in unto them and they unto you know for a certainty there is no doubt the Lord your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you but they shall be snares and traps unto you scores in your sides thorns in your eyes until ye perish from off this good land which the Lord your God hath given you we conclude in chapter 24 with something that may surprise you pardon me Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to sheim I love sheim to sheam and called for the Elders of Israel and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers and they presented themselves before God and Joshua said unto all the people thus saith the Lord God of Israel your fathers dwelt this is what our brother Daniel read this morning in in his message to us all but did you notice Joshua the leader the general is speaking as a prophet thus saith the Lord God of Israel it's only two times in the Book of Joshua that he says thus sayeth the Lord this is one of them the other there's in in uh chapter uh seven I think it was after the sin of achen so a number of things are rehearsed and then in verse 13 we read this is again Joshua saying thus sayeth the Lord and I have given you and I have given you a land for which you did not labor and cities which you built not and ye dwell in them of The Vineyards and Olive yards which he planted not do you eat and I think at this point it stops being Joshua speaking as a prophet but now responding to the prophecy now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth it takes both and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom ye will serve whether the gods which your fathers serve that were on the other side of the flood gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell as for me and my house we will serve the Lord and the people answered and said God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods verse 19 Joshua said unto the people you cannot serve the Lord he's a holy God he's a jealous God he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins if he forsake the Lord and serve other gods okay looks like I blew it again brother Jordan then he will turn and do you hurt and consume you after that Heath done you good and the people said unto Joshua but we will serve the Lord and Joshua said unto the people ye are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen you the Lord to serve him and they said we Are Witnesses now therefore put away the strange Gods which are among you and incline your heart unto the Lord God of Israel and the people said unto Joshua the Lord Our God will we serve and his voice will we we obey so Joshua made a covenant with the people that day and set them a statute and an ordinance and shck them did they do it did they serve the Lord and not forsake his ways and Obey him the people that took this pledge skipping to verse 31 we read and Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua which had known all The Works of the Lord that he had done for Israel so I think the answer is yes they made that pledge and they fulfilled it but sadly many in the following Generations did not as we'll see as we continue through the Bible and Joshua the first of the history books ends much as Genesis the first book of the Torah with mention of the bones of Joseph also in the second to last verse just as it was in Genesis we read and the bones of Joseph which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt buried they in sheim and a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of hamor the father of shakam for 100 pieces of silver back in Genesis 33 and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph it's the musicians would please come sheum is a city on the border between Manasseh and Ephraim it's hard to see there I've circled sheam and this kind of gray area is a territory of rhri and this green area above is ter territory of manasse sheum lies in both territories it's a border it's on the border between manasse and ephriam which are the sons of Joseph it's the sight of the horrible Massacre by Sim and Levi it's the last place in Canaan where Joseph had peace his neck stop searching for his brothers in Genesis was when he went from shakum to Dothan and was there beaten and sold into slavery thus Joseph's bones are laid to rest in peace in the very spot of his inheritance shared by his two sons whom Jacob had claimed as his own and on the very plot of land Jacob purchased some 500 years earlier and that's not all was one of the six Cities of Refuge speaking both of mercy and Justice what a poetically beautiful and fitting way to end the first of the book of histories along the way this evening we noted a number of things we can relate to I think in our lives today lessons of Faith consistency not jumping to conclusions not judging others not relying on second or third hand reports or imputing motives motive or intent and so on to follow the lord as he guides us through life and not be distracted from this primary goal or mission to be obedient to do the things the lord requires of us aren't you glad that this book has been preserved for us by faithful scribes for three and a half thousand years and its story contains lessons that are so Timeless we can apply them profitably to our our lives today in Tucson in 2021 as our pastor comes to close the service and thinking about Joshua as well as the theme of the service on Sunday morning making room in our heart for God to write his story let's worship together and song with Jesus be the Lord of all the kingdoms of my heart Jesus be the Lord of all Jesus be the Lord of all Jesus be the Lord of all the kingdoms of my heart Jesus I surrender all Jesus I surrender all Jesus I surrender all the kingdoms of my heart Jesus be the Lord of all Jesus be the Lord of all Jesus be the Lord of all the kingom of my heart for if he's not Lord of everything then he's not Lord at all God bless you brother amen I uh want to highlight a couple things our brother said one thing is a bit humorous when the Lord was telling Joshua you had to tell him a couple times you are old and you are stricken in years when that angel stood before Joshua when he looked out and he saw this man in armor coming with his sword and and and how powerful he looked that man that was coming towards Joshua was not an old man Joshua looked at him he drew his sword and he said are you for us or are you for an enemy I think Joshua was like 80 years old wasn't he about that when that happened so Joshua was not aware of his age he didn't care Caleb wasn't aware of his age either when Caleb is as uh brother Lyall said when Caleb came to get his inheritance he looked up at the mountains and he saw this hill country of Judea and he said I want these Hills I want to take that mountain right there and that mountain just happened to be full of giants the Anakin and Joshua said I want to take it or Caleb said I want to take it Same Spirit as he had before as Joshua had I also want to point out I believe it was in Joshua chapter 22 I believe believe that you said when um it was Reuben and Gad and manasse good job on the firstborn that that helped me Reuben and Gad and manasse they built this Altar and they wanted it for Fellowship they wanted to reach out to their Brethren just like Joshua had built had built the stones at gilgal and placed them there they had placed this Memorial there am I right and it was for Fellowship they wanted to say hey here's what happened here and word got out to the other tribes and they thought that these people had fallen into idolatry they thought that these people had fallen into sin and they started preparing for battle this would have been a civil war between this country that had just formed and it was all because of a misunderstanding Thank God as brother Lyall said thank God they thought enough of each other to talk to each other and how many times do we fail at doing that let's all stand do you appreciate brother Lyle in the Book of Joshua I do too what a powerful story this is when this is is what they had all wanted for 40 years they wandered in the wilderness and only two of them went over Joshua and Caleb they went over and the walls of Jericho and brother Lyall even showed us the archaeological evidence the walls of Jericho fell down they went through and all of these great stories and all of these great lessons that were taught us in that book and it's amazing that it's considered a history book but wow how many beautiful lessons are in that book how um how precious brother Joe if you come and close in prayer oh I will serve thee because I love thee you have G life to me I was nothing before you found you have gi life to me there were heart broken pees ruin lies of why you ride on calary your T was what I long for you have [Music] K

Scarlet strand that red strand in front of the pull pit I just that just blessed me so much and I thought that's way I want my life to be see Rahab she had to dis display something she had to show there had to be something there that identified her and it was that red strand that she hung from her house from the window let's as we go let's lay out that red cord as as she laid out let's be different than this world and let's let's lay it out there and everyone that walks by can and see that there's something about something different about this person this person's a Christian think
