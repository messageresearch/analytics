[29:35] brother whether peter was supposed to
[29:36] speak tonight and sister
[29:38] lydia's back and believe her and so

[33:37] seated
[33:38] as we start this sermon
[34:04] okay
[34:53] good evening to houston
[34:56] i certainly deem this the great
[34:58] privilege of being here again tonight
[35:01] in houston it's been many years since
[35:04] i've had the privilege of being here
[35:06] and i've been setting listening tonight
[35:08] to each of these speakers
[35:11] and the other day when i had
[35:14] arrangements made
[35:15] for something else another place
[35:18] and i knew that those children were
[35:22] facing death i thought if something
[35:26] would happen to those children
[35:27] i would never forgive myself of not
[35:30] coming here
[35:31] to give my opinion and doing all that i
[35:34] could
[35:35] help this uh mother and father and
[35:38] of these children and to do all that i
[35:41] could for the saving
[35:43] of their lives and
[35:47] houston has is a memorial place to me it
[35:51] holds many great memories that i
[35:54] have cherished ever since i first
[35:57] made my visit here many years ago over
[35:59] here to the
[36:01] herald of faith brother kidson and then
[36:04] down here to the auditorium when
[36:06] i was here with brother raymond richie
[36:09] and
[36:10] the ministers of the city and then of
[36:13] course mr iris mr kipperman
[36:16] the night that the camera proved that
[36:20] i wasn't telling anything that was wrong
[36:22] it was truth
[36:24] and when the mechanical eye of the
[36:26] camera caught
[36:28] the vision of the or not the vision the
[36:31] reality the
[36:32] christ that we preached and so loved was
[36:35] with us that he promised to be with us
[36:38] and
[36:38] the camera tuck his picture many times i
[36:42] said in times past that that i'd see
[36:46] that light
[36:46] all the time but sometimes people would
[36:49] be a little skeptic of it which you
[36:51] could
[36:51] believe they could be that way but that
[36:54] night
[36:54] it proved it that was the first time it
[36:56] was ever taken since then it's been
[36:58] taken several times
[36:59] in germany just recently coming down
[37:02] when the anointing was when it went back
[37:04] again
[37:04] and those things are not to magnify
[37:08] some human being but it's the vindicate
[37:11] the presence of jesus christ among these
[37:13] people
[37:14] and we believe that that same lord jesus
[37:16] is here tonight
[37:17] to help us in this case and i believe
[37:21] that he's
[37:21] more interested in it than we could be
[37:24] and i am
[37:25] certainly in sympathy with the parents
[37:28] of these
[37:29] children and shoulder-to-shoulder with
[37:31] every man and woman that's trying to
[37:34] deliver them from the jaws of death
[37:37] and now i understand that this is not a
[37:40] revival meeting
[37:42] but it's just a series of prayer
[37:45] meetings being held
[37:46] for these souls that's laying in the
[37:50] shadows of death
[37:52] and so i am late
[37:55] i will not speak very long but i would
[37:58] like to
[37:59] draw a text or context whether from a
[38:02] text that i would like to read in two
[38:04] places
[38:05] in the scripture and you who have the
[38:08] bibles if you would turn with me for
[38:11] just a moment
[38:12] to the book of philippians
[38:15] the first chapter and the 20th
[38:19] verse of the first chapter of
[38:22] philippians
[38:24] according to my earnest expectations and
[38:28] my hope that in nothing i shall be
[38:31] ashamed
[38:32] but with all boldness as always
[38:35] so now also christ shall be magnified
[38:39] in my body whether it be life or
[38:43] death and then in also
[38:46] in the book of acts the second chapter
[38:51] and the 30th verse i might read the 25th
[38:55] through the 30th
[38:56] for david spake concerning
[39:00] him for i'll foresaw the lord always
[39:03] before my faith
[39:04] for he is on my right hand that i should
[39:07] not be moved
[39:08] therefore did my heart rejoice and my
[39:11] tongue was
[39:11] glad moreover
[39:15] also my flesh shall rest in hope because
[39:17] i will not leave my soul in hell
[39:20] neither will i suffer thy holy one to
[39:22] see corruption
[39:23] thou has made known to me the way of
[39:25] life
[39:27] thou shall make me full of joy with thy
[39:30] countenances men and brethren let me
[39:33] freely speak to you the patriarch david
[39:35] that he's both dead and buried and his
[39:37] sepulcher is with us unto this day
[39:40] therefore being a prophet
[39:43] and knowing that god had sworn with an
[39:46] oath to him that of the fruit
[39:50] of his loins according to the flesh he
[39:52] would raise up
[39:53] christ to set on his throne he's seeing
[39:57] this
[39:57] before spake of the resurrection of
[39:59] christ
[40:00] that his soul was not left in hell
[40:02] neither did his flesh
[40:04] seek corruption let us bow our heads
[40:07] just a moment
[40:08] for prayer our heavenly father
[40:13] we are grateful to thee for our
[40:16] mercy and that's truly lord why we are
[40:20] here tonight
[40:21] is to ask mercy
[40:25] we would not ask this if we did not have
[40:29] faith to believe that it would be
[40:30] granted to us
[40:32] man has flown across the country
[40:35] and prayers are going up everywhere to
[40:39] thee
[40:39] that the lives of these that we are
[40:43] earnestly interceding for tonight
[40:46] may be spare lord we would ask for
[40:50] strength for the
[40:52] mothers and fathers of these young
[40:54] people
[40:56] and as we understand that this young man
[40:59] has
[40:59] turned his life to thee and wants to
[41:03] serve the
[41:04] as we heard one of the speakers say that
[41:06] he wanted to become a minister of the
[41:08] gospel
[41:10] i pray god that you will grant this
[41:12] opportunity to the young fellow
[41:15] forgive us of our sins cleanse our
[41:18] hearts from evil thoughts
[41:20] and whatever would be in our way that
[41:23] would hinder
[41:24] our prayer from being answered for these
[41:27] people as we have read thy word we know
[41:31] both heavens and earth will pass away
[41:33] but thy
[41:34] word shall not fail we pray that you
[41:36] will add to us
[41:38] by the holy spirit the context that
[41:41] would take that would be your divine
[41:43] will
[41:44] in this case now as we've heard the
[41:47] attorney
[41:48] and many speaking and we pray that we
[41:51] will find
[41:52] just what to do next what is our next
[41:55] step
[41:56] to do lord we are here to do it make it
[41:59] known
[42:00] to us lord through thy word for we asked
[42:03] it in the name of thy
[42:04] son the lord jesus amen
[42:10] reading these few verses
[42:14] and i'll realize the occasion is great
[42:18] because it's concerned i would think
[42:21] when i heard
[42:22] and got that mother's telegram what if
[42:24] that was my
[42:25] son sitting in that role or my
[42:29] daughter and i we want to
[42:32] put everything that we can to it
[42:35] then some might say well that was just a
[42:37] very small
[42:38] portion of the word that you read
[42:41] brother branham
[42:42] well that may be true too but you see
[42:45] it isn't the the size or the amount of
[42:49] words
[42:49] it's what it means it's it's just
[42:53] what it is it's the promise of god
[42:57] and i want to draw from this night from
[42:59] this
[43:01] text tonight or a text from this
[43:04] uh absolute now i've chosen this
[43:08] text a while ago sitting in my motel
[43:11] room because
[43:12] i think that now we need
[43:16] something positive some absolute
[43:20] that we can hold on to and know that
[43:22] it's
[43:23] true crucial hour like this we must have
[43:26] something that we are positive that's
[43:29] right
[43:30] something that we can hold to to know
[43:32] whether
[43:34] uh how the case is going now
[43:37] according to to webster
[43:40] uh absolute in itself is
[43:43] unlimited in power
[43:46] and primarily is an ultimate
[43:50] and an ultimate is an amen
[43:53] it's the absolute as what
[43:56] if that's the end that's everything
[44:00] now every great achievement that's ever
[44:03] been in the world
[44:05] has been tied to some sort of an
[44:08] absolute
[44:09] you cannot do anything unless there's
[44:12] something that you can hold to when a
[44:15] young man is going to get married to a
[44:17] young woman
[44:18] he must know the character of this young
[44:21] woman
[44:22] or the young woman must know the
[44:23] character of the young man something
[44:26] that she can
[44:27] hold to will this man be a just man will
[44:29] he make me the
[44:31] right type of husband will this
[44:34] woman give to me in life what i
[44:37] what i expect out of her loyalty and
[44:40] so forth and then it's got to be
[44:44] somewhere that they can base their their
[44:48] vows upon knowing that there's something
[44:51] that will
[44:52] hold and that's the reason we bring them
[44:54] to the church
[44:55] and to the word of god to get this
[44:58] absolute
[44:59] uh tide now paul
[45:02] here as we see he had an absolute that
[45:05] he held to
[45:06] all his life after his conversion
[45:10] that was a christ-centered
[45:13] life and what a place to have an
[45:17] absolute a christ-centered life it was a
[45:20] different life than what he had lived at
[45:22] one time
[45:23] for he said the life that i now live
[45:25] which was a different from what he
[45:27] had lived there come a time that
[45:31] paul had this experience
[45:35] that brought him to this decision
[45:39] for paul was a great mighty man
[45:42] amongst the jews and a great
[45:46] theologian but he wasn't too
[45:49] sure of his standing but one day on the
[45:52] road down
[45:53] to damascus a light pillar of fire
[45:57] came down from heaven and paul being a
[46:00] jew was
[46:01] acquainted that this light pillar of
[46:05] fire
[46:05] had been the thing that had the god that
[46:08] had led his people
[46:09] out of egypt they had followed this
[46:13] pillar of fire so being a jew he said to
[46:16] him quickly
[46:17] lord who art thou he knew him as
[46:21] lord but who art thou and the
[46:24] voice came back from the pillar of fire
[46:28] i am jesus and it's hard for you to kick
[46:33] against the pricks
[46:34] from that time on paul
[46:38] knew that the jehovah of the old
[46:41] testament
[46:42] was jesus of the new and he had
[46:45] something that he could hold to and
[46:48] that's how you could write that great
[46:50] book of hebrews now
[46:53] if you if in your life you have
[46:57] an absolute you do things
[47:00] ordinarily you would not do especially
[47:02] if you have a god-centered life
[47:05] the god-centered life makes the person
[47:08] do things that ordinarily they would not
[47:11] do
[47:11] very odd peculiar why
[47:14] is a christian life so odd and peculiar
[47:19] it's because that they are looking
[47:22] to god's word which is almost
[47:26] foreign to the world today now we have
[47:29] churches
[47:30] and we have organizations and we have
[47:34] religion all
[47:35] much of it around the world am i
[47:38] seven times around since i was here with
[47:41] you at houston
[47:42] i've accumulated much knowledge on the
[47:45] gods and the religions
[47:48] of this world but that isn't what i'm
[47:51] talking about
[47:52] i'm talking about an absolute
[47:56] connected with christ
[47:59] then it makes you a a
[48:02] odd person you do odd
[48:06] things your thinking is all together
[48:10] different than the thinking you once did
[48:13] because you have found something that
[48:16] you've
[48:16] anchored a faith in someone that created
[48:20] the heavens and the earth
[48:22] that his very word itself is creative
[48:26] a god who spoke the world into existence
[48:29] and there's nothing too hard for him
[48:33] so it makes you a creative yourself
[48:36] because you
[48:37] take his words and a word is a thought
[48:40] expressed
[48:42] now paul had got into that
[48:46] state to where that he had had
[48:50] not a theological experience altogether
[48:53] but he
[48:53] had a personal witness
[48:56] he had met god and knew
[48:59] that he was called of god and nobody had
[49:03] to tell him anything about it he was
[49:05] absolutely hopes but our our
[49:08] positive thought upon what he says
[49:11] and we know that it is the truth and
[49:14] people
[49:15] act funny they seem to just forget about
[49:18] the negative side because they have
[49:20] found
[49:21] an absolute because it's the word of god
[49:25] jesus said heavens and earth will pass
[49:28] away but my word
[49:29] shall never fail so if we've got the
[49:33] word of promise
[49:34] then there's no failing to it it cannot
[49:38] fail
[49:39] so i i'm believing that that's what the
[49:42] prayer meetings here
[49:43] the the religious people of houston are
[49:47] interested in human lives and that's
[49:49] what we are gathered here for
[49:52] is to is to call on a power that's
[49:55] beyond all
[49:56] man-made laws and powers something who
[49:58] can change the hearts of man
[50:01] like he did pharaoh in egypt and he's
[50:03] he's god
[50:05] and we must stop now looking at the the
[50:08] negative side and go to looking at the
[50:10] positive side
[50:12] and before you can have faith you've got
[50:14] to have something to have
[50:15] faith in and what more can you trust
[50:18] faith in than it can the word of the
[50:21] living god what's created the powers
[50:25] what more could we put our hopes in
[50:28] therefore it makes you look different
[50:30] act different
[50:31] you are looking for god to fulfill his
[50:34] promise
[50:35] and when difficulties arise like we have
[50:38] now
[50:39] it is an anchor it's something that that
[50:42] holds you something that you're
[50:44] tied to it's a promise that we have been
[50:47] tied to the word of god is just like the
[50:50] anchor
[50:50] is the absolute to the ship in the time
[50:53] of storm
[50:55] the ship can be sailing the sea
[50:58] the anchor is out in the front it's it
[51:02] rests you people here in houston so
[51:04] close to the sea
[51:05] see the ships come in and why i carry
[51:07] this
[51:08] excess weight of this great mighty
[51:11] anchor but you see when the storms come
[51:15] the the raging storms that rips up the
[51:18] sea
[51:19] and control the vessel into the bank
[51:21] somewhere and
[51:22] crash it or turn it over in the shallow
[51:25] waters
[51:25] it gets out into the deep waters and
[51:28] lets
[51:29] down this great huge anchor that's so
[51:33] fixed that it'll drag on the bottom of
[51:35] the sea and
[51:36] until it hooks into the top of some
[51:38] unseen
[51:40] mountain then let the
[51:43] storms rage if they want to it's got an
[51:46] absolute the anchor hole some worry on
[51:49] earth
[51:50] but it's it's tight and as the
[51:53] ship and the waves whip around the ship
[51:56] it's got an absolute because it's tied
[52:00] that's the way that a man is when he's
[52:03] tied to christ
[52:04] into his word and believes it there's an
[52:07] absolute there's something
[52:09] that holds him an absolute is like the
[52:12] north star
[52:13] when you're lost when you when you've
[52:16] lost your directions
[52:18] and you want to find your way back the
[52:20] north star
[52:21] is an absolute now these other stars
[52:25] but they turn with the world as the
[52:28] world turns around them
[52:30] the it turns away from them and the you
[52:33] know the same
[52:34] morning star is the evening star also
[52:36] because the world's just turned around
[52:39] but there's one star that does not
[52:42] move and it's centered right in the
[52:45] middle of the earth
[52:47] and therefore the it's a it's a sure
[52:50] star if you know the north star
[52:54] you can always find your way around
[52:57] but oh that's when a man's lost and he
[53:00] doesn't know just which way to go
[53:03] now i know a star
[53:06] oh it's more than a north star
[53:10] and to be tied and see his
[53:13] presence no matter how you're lost or
[53:17] where you are you can find your way back
[53:19] but his guidance
[53:20] that's his word it's the way out of all
[53:24] troubles
[53:25] it's the way to peace it's the way to
[53:27] success
[53:28] it's a way to life itself
[53:32] is to follow this star the lord jesus
[53:36] and now if you are tied to that star the
[53:41] holy spirit
[53:42] is a compass that will only point to the
[53:45] star
[53:47] the holy compass it is magnetized to
[53:51] that north pole
[53:52] and the only way no matter how much
[53:54] jungler you're in or
[53:56] how deep the thickets are around you how
[53:58] foggy it is to see
[54:00] that compass hand you can turn it any
[54:02] way you want to and it'll swing right
[54:03] back and point to the north star
[54:06] and when we're in trouble and trust in
[54:08] christ there's
[54:09] one thing sure the holy spirit will
[54:12] point us to the word that will guide us
[54:14] to the north star into the deliverance
[54:16] of everything we have in edom
[54:19] he is our absolute
[54:22] to the man that's lost in the wilderness
[54:24] the compass
[54:25] is the thing that guides him to the
[54:27] outward when we are in trouble there's
[54:29] only one thing it's just as sure as in
[54:31] our star as long as the world stands in
[54:33] his position and turns around
[54:35] the north star will remain in his place
[54:37] and long as there is an eternity christ
[54:40] will ever be the savior in a way out of
[54:42] every problem ever just
[54:44] every trial ever the thing and therefore
[54:46] we
[54:47] we when we are tied to him we don't get
[54:49] flustered and all
[54:51] worked up like the world does and all
[54:53] what will we do about this what will we
[54:55] do about that
[54:56] we seem as if we're not even anchored
[54:58] but a man who's
[54:59] anchored his soul into christ jesus his
[55:02] trust there
[55:03] knowing that when he asks the father
[55:04] anything in his name jesus said i'll do
[55:06] it
[55:07] that settles it that settles it
[55:10] it's the amen it's the absolute it's the
[55:13] ultimate
[55:14] when jesus said ask the father anything
[55:17] in my name
[55:18] i'll grant it now that's an ultimate
[55:21] that's it
[55:22] whatever you have need of when you pray
[55:24] believe that you receive it you shall
[55:26] have it
[55:27] that settles it that's all of it see if
[55:30] we're really
[55:31] anchored and believe it and we've made
[55:33] him our
[55:34] absolute of course he does he is
[55:37] the absolute that takes us from all fear
[55:40] there's no
[55:40] fear when you are really tied to the
[55:43] rock of ages
[55:45] there's no fear to the sailor how hard
[55:48] the ships are
[55:49] being buffeted by the waves as long as
[55:51] that anchor's holding in the top of the
[55:53] mountain down there
[55:54] well sure he knows the ship's going to
[55:56] stay up it isn't going against some rock
[55:59] somewhere it isn't going to get in some
[56:01] shallow water and be turned over
[56:03] because it's got the absolute anchored
[56:06] in the top of some mountain
[56:08] and when a man can pray the prayer of
[56:10] faith and
[56:11] anchor his soul you honor in the word of
[56:13] god where all heavens and earth will
[56:15] pass away
[56:16] for that word cannot there is no fear
[56:18] let them come
[56:19] say whatever they want to our faith is
[56:21] in god
[56:23] god alone we believe it there was a time
[56:27] that when the table manners of this
[56:29] nation rested upon
[56:31] the word of a woman i believe her name
[56:33] was called emily post
[56:35] now she was the absolute to table
[56:38] manners
[56:39] if emily poe said take and eat your
[56:41] beans with your knife
[56:42] that was it that was it because she was
[56:46] the
[56:46] absolute for table manners as she said
[56:49] drink your coffee out of your saucer and
[56:51] sup it as you did no matter how sloppy
[56:53] it sound
[56:54] it was still the absolute everybody
[56:57] bowed to it
[56:58] because they've taken her to be the
[57:00] absolute of
[57:01] table manners we've got to have an
[57:04] absolute
[57:05] no matter what we're doing if we're ever
[57:07] going to achieve anything we've got to
[57:09] have an
[57:09] absolute there was a time
[57:12] when hitler's word was an absolute in
[57:15] germany
[57:17] no matter what anybody else said
[57:20] hitler's word was an absolute
[57:23] if he said they die they die if he said
[57:26] they live they live
[57:27] and if he said we go to war we do not go
[57:30] to war
[57:31] whatever we do his word was an absolute
[57:34] there was a time that when italy had an
[57:37] absolute
[57:38] that was a word of their dictator
[57:40] mussolinia
[57:41] what he said do they said his chauffeur
[57:44] drove up one minute early to get him he
[57:46] shot him
[57:47] wow he said i don't want you here one
[57:49] minute early i want you here on the
[57:51] dock exactly time see his word was
[57:55] absolute all italy bowed to it
[57:58] there was a time when pharaoh in egypt
[58:01] was an absolute but you see but
[58:04] all these decisions that they made were
[58:07] man's made decision and they all
[58:09] fell why because they were not in
[58:12] accordance
[58:13] with human it wasn't accordance with
[58:16] god's word for human life
[58:19] i want that i hope to anchor
[58:22] if we expect to save human life we've
[58:24] got to come in accordance with god's
[58:27] word and god's plan for human life
[58:30] and the only way you're going to find
[58:31] this is to find it in his word
[58:34] and believe it now so them
[58:37] pharaohs i was in egypt not long ago and
[58:40] i think they had to dig 20 feet down in
[58:42] the ground to find the
[58:44] the place where pharaoh was seated as a
[58:47] king of the earth
[58:48] and great herod's and so forth passing
[58:52] down along the line
[58:53] we see where their kingdoms has fallen
[58:55] and gone on but
[58:57] there is one kingdom that's above all
[59:00] kingdoms
[59:01] it's so high to the heavens so he'll
[59:03] never pass away
[59:05] there sets a king that when he makes his
[59:08] decision on anything
[59:09] and we believe that decision that is an
[59:12] absolute it's going to be that way
[59:14] regardless
[59:15] of what anyone else says about it it's
[59:18] always
[59:18] now our supreme court our supreme court
[59:22] it is an absolute the end of all the
[59:25] trials
[59:27] now we have to have it sometime we might
[59:29] not agree with this decision
[59:31] like they didn't agree with hitler's and
[59:33] so forth but yet we've got to have this
[59:36] absolute and the absolute of the nation
[59:39] and trials is a supreme court
[59:41] our local courts can try anything and
[59:43] pronounce this but the supreme court
[59:45] rules over it all
[59:47] we must have it as a nation we must have
[59:50] its decision because a nation is tied to
[59:54] this
[59:54] absolute of the supreme court all right
[59:57] everything must have an absolute did you
[59:59] know a common ball game has to have an
[1:00:02] absolute
[1:00:04] how what is the absolute of a ball game
[1:00:06] an umpire
[1:00:08] what if there is no empire see a
[1:00:11] umpire no matter where you're standing
[1:00:13] what position you look at
[1:00:15] and you say it was a ball and he said it
[1:00:18] was a strike
[1:00:20] well that's what it was it was a strike
[1:00:23] why because his word no matter what the
[1:00:26] bleacher said
[1:00:27] what somebody else said it's a strike
[1:00:29] because he called it a strike
[1:00:31] and he's the empire now what if there
[1:00:34] was no umpire
[1:00:36] there'd be such a fuss and everything in
[1:00:38] chaos until you couldn't have the ball
[1:00:39] game
[1:00:40] therefore you've got to have a absolute
[1:00:43] to have a ball game it must be that way
[1:00:47] now there must be a an absolute
[1:00:50] in a traffic light a traffic light is an
[1:00:54] absolute rather to traffic
[1:00:57] what if there was no traffic light or
[1:00:59] what if the traffic light was out
[1:01:01] and you run down the street and one
[1:01:03] fellow was coming this way and
[1:01:05] he said i was here first i've got to get
[1:01:07] through that and said i'm late for work
[1:01:09] talk about a traffic jam you'd really
[1:01:12] have it
[1:01:12] but see the traffic light settles
[1:01:15] it's the absolute if the light is green
[1:01:18] go
[1:01:19] if it's red stop if there is no such a
[1:01:22] thing as a
[1:01:23] traffic light then we'd have traffic
[1:01:25] jams and that's what's the matter in the
[1:01:27] christian
[1:01:27] faith today we got too many traffic jams
[1:01:30] everybody making their own absolute
[1:01:32] when we got one absolute and that's the
[1:01:34] word of the living god
[1:01:36] that settles it forever no matter what
[1:01:39] anyone else says
[1:01:40] it's almost gotten to a place like it
[1:01:42] was in the days of judges
[1:01:43] everybody has their own absolute but it
[1:01:46] all fails like the pharaohs and so forth
[1:01:48] but god's
[1:01:49] absolute is his word he gives it and
[1:01:52] heavens and earth will pass away but it
[1:01:54] shall never
[1:01:55] pass away i like that now we haven't got
[1:01:58] much time so just just look for a few
[1:02:00] moments
[1:02:00] to a few people that did come into
[1:02:03] crisis
[1:02:04] and of times where death was at hand
[1:02:08] like we are standing tonight and they
[1:02:11] took an absolute let's interview some of
[1:02:15] them
[1:02:15] let's go back to an old story that's
[1:02:17] familiar to all of us
[1:02:19] in the days when sin had heaped into the
[1:02:22] world to god
[1:02:23] got sick and tired of it and the world
[1:02:25] was going to be destroyed
[1:02:26] and god gave noah an absolute
[1:02:30] that was his word and it no matter
[1:02:34] that absolute was of the saving of the
[1:02:37] people
[1:02:38] noah knew that the world was going to
[1:02:41] die
[1:02:42] and god gave him the absolute and that
[1:02:46] was
[1:02:46] his word now to save his people from
[1:02:49] death
[1:02:50] now what was the absolute to save people
[1:02:53] from death and noah's time
[1:02:55] was the word of god that was the
[1:02:58] absolute no matter what anybody else
[1:03:00] said
[1:03:01] what science said there's no rain up
[1:03:03] there we can shoot the moon with our
[1:03:05] instruments
[1:03:05] there's no rain there how's rain going
[1:03:07] to come down if god
[1:03:09] said that there would be rainfall god
[1:03:11] can put rain
[1:03:12] in the skies if he said so noah went
[1:03:15] right about his business
[1:03:16] relaxed and preparing an ark for the
[1:03:19] saving
[1:03:20] of the people for there was an absolute
[1:03:23] given to the people that they would be
[1:03:25] saved if they took
[1:03:26] god's provided way for this absolute
[1:03:30] so after sometimes when we've accepted
[1:03:33] the absolute
[1:03:34] i would like to say this because of the
[1:03:36] parent
[1:03:37] of these children of what i want to tell
[1:03:40] you just in a moment
[1:03:42] now if uh sometimes when we have
[1:03:45] accepted it we are put to trial to see
[1:03:47] if we really believe it
[1:03:50] we god usually does that and god works
[1:03:54] uh he cannot change his program because
[1:03:56] his
[1:03:57] word is himself in the beginning was the
[1:04:00] word and the word was with god and the
[1:04:02] word
[1:04:02] was god and the word was made flesh and
[1:04:05] dwelt among us the same yesterday today
[1:04:07] and forever
[1:04:08] so it's always god when he's called upon
[1:04:11] a scene
[1:04:12] to act and the decision that he makes he
[1:04:15] has to ever remain with that decision
[1:04:18] he cannot change it because he's
[1:04:19] infinite now i can change my decision
[1:04:22] you can because we're finite therefore
[1:04:25] we make mistakes
[1:04:26] but god cannot change his decision
[1:04:28] because he's
[1:04:29] infinite and his his decision is
[1:04:32] perfect always he cannot say i was wrong
[1:04:35] here
[1:04:36] and i'll change my decision because that
[1:04:37] was sure god could change and god
[1:04:39] cannot change neither can his word
[1:04:42] change he's the same
[1:04:43] always so god gave noah trial
[1:04:47] after accepting his absolute noah went
[1:04:49] into the ark
[1:04:50] god shut the door behind him no doubt
[1:04:52] they said now in the morning there'll be
[1:04:55] black clouds and there'll be thunder and
[1:04:56] lightning
[1:04:57] and the rains will fall but you know the
[1:04:59] next day the sun come up just as bright
[1:05:01] as it ever did
[1:05:02] i imagine the borderline believers that
[1:05:04] said we'll grow up the old man could
[1:05:06] have been right about that
[1:05:08] so maybe science uh was wrong that there
[1:05:11] there could be some rain up there
[1:05:13] but remember it never rained but then
[1:05:16] the second day the sun was just as
[1:05:18] bright as it always was
[1:05:20] third fourth fifth sixth and even to the
[1:05:23] seventh day
[1:05:24] but noah had climbed up in the upper
[1:05:26] room so he could watch the skies
[1:05:29] and on that seventh morning when there
[1:05:32] come a time when people had refused
[1:05:34] god's absolute
[1:05:36] way of salvation of saving of the lives
[1:05:40] of the people
[1:05:41] the rains began to fall and the sewers
[1:05:43] filled up and
[1:05:44] the boat began to rise and it took noah
[1:05:47] and them to safety
[1:05:49] sure because they were trusting in god's
[1:05:51] word the absolute
[1:05:53] god's word of promise no matter how bad
[1:05:56] it seems like and how
[1:05:57] dark it gets still believe your absolute
[1:06:01] moses well his he had tried to save the
[1:06:04] life of those poor hebrews
[1:06:07] and they were almost as bad off or just
[1:06:10] as bad off as these two children are
[1:06:12] that were trying to save tonight
[1:06:16] they were slaves and they killed him
[1:06:17] just at random whenever they wanted to
[1:06:19] and moses felt in his heart that that
[1:06:22] wasn't
[1:06:22] the will of god so he he tried to do it
[1:06:25] through education
[1:06:27] he tried to do it to his own efforts and
[1:06:30] he found out
[1:06:31] that he miserably failed he did
[1:06:33] something himself
[1:06:34] that wasn't right because he took
[1:06:37] another
[1:06:38] man's life that was not right then he
[1:06:41] went into the wilderness and was there
[1:06:42] for 40 years
[1:06:44] but one day he was herding sheep on the
[1:06:46] backside of the desert
[1:06:48] and there was a light in a bush and when
[1:06:51] moses got near
[1:06:52] this light the voice of god spoke to him
[1:06:56] out of this
[1:06:56] pillar of fire laying back in this bush
[1:06:59] and said
[1:07:00] moses moses and he said you're
[1:07:03] my lord he said take off your shoes for
[1:07:05] the ground that you stand on is holy
[1:07:09] i have heard the groans of my people
[1:07:12] i've heard their prayer meetings i've
[1:07:15] remembered that i
[1:07:17] made them a promise if that ought to set
[1:07:21] the hearts of christian believers
[1:07:22] of fire tonight i am god i remember i
[1:07:27] promised how scriptural that voice was
[1:07:33] and he said moses i'm sending you down
[1:07:36] there to deliver them
[1:07:38] and moses of course as i said at the
[1:07:41] beginning when you
[1:07:42] take that absolute of god it makes you
[1:07:45] do things that
[1:07:46] uh well sometimes ridiculous in the
[1:07:48] sight of the people
[1:07:50] could you imagine a man that had run
[1:07:52] from the egyptians
[1:07:53] the next morning after seeing this
[1:07:56] absolute this
[1:07:57] word of god spoke to him positive
[1:08:00] witness
[1:08:01] because it was the word the promise was
[1:08:03] there
[1:08:04] and the vindication of the great god of
[1:08:08] creation how he performed a miracle
[1:08:10] in a in the presence of moses and showed
[1:08:13] that
[1:08:13] he was a god of creation and moses the
[1:08:16] next morning
[1:08:17] took his wife and set her on a mule with
[1:08:20] the the
[1:08:21] kid on her hip and the 80 years old
[1:08:24] whiskers hanging to his waistline his
[1:08:27] bald head
[1:08:27] shining with a crooked stick in his hand
[1:08:30] going down towards egypt
[1:08:31] shouting as hard as he could go where
[1:08:33] are you going moses i'm going
[1:08:35] down to egypt to take over take over
[1:08:39] a one-man invasion why he had an
[1:08:43] absolute he had something he had the
[1:08:45] word of god he could spit on
[1:08:47] a man of 80 years old with a mule and a
[1:08:51] stick in his hand
[1:08:52] that's all he had like a one-man
[1:08:54] invasion to russia today
[1:08:56] but he went down and took over because
[1:08:58] he had an absolute he had talked to god
[1:09:01] he had heard the voice of god
[1:09:03] and the thing of it was he did it
[1:09:06] right why that was with him all the days
[1:09:09] of his life
[1:09:10] it was an absolute no man has a right to
[1:09:14] climb into the pulpit to preach the
[1:09:15] gospel
[1:09:16] unless himself has treaded on those
[1:09:19] sacred sands
[1:09:20] where no agnostic or unbeliever can ever
[1:09:23] explain away the supernatural of god
[1:09:26] jesus would not let his disciples preach
[1:09:28] no matter how well they knowed him
[1:09:30] they must go to the city of jerusalem
[1:09:32] and wait till they was endued with power
[1:09:34] from unharmed
[1:09:35] they must have that experience moses
[1:09:37] knowing that he was a prophet nobody
[1:09:39] been raised up for this purpose
[1:09:40] but without that personal contact that
[1:09:43] absolute
[1:09:44] something it proved to him that when he
[1:09:46] went down there he was going to have
[1:09:48] deliverance for these people
[1:09:49] he was never the same he went down there
[1:09:52] because he had the absolute and he did
[1:09:54] just exactly what god told him to do
[1:09:56] there was no fear in his heart when he
[1:09:58] threw down the serpents
[1:09:59] or the rods and they turn to the serpent
[1:10:02] and the
[1:10:03] carnal impersonators come up with their
[1:10:05] type of ministry and
[1:10:06] throw down and done the same thing moses
[1:10:08] had done just exactly what god told him
[1:10:10] to do
[1:10:11] there was nothing for him to do but
[1:10:12] stand still and see the glory of god
[1:10:16] then we find out that god taken his
[1:10:18] serpent and eat up the rest of them
[1:10:19] that's the way it's done
[1:10:21] he was positive that the god that could
[1:10:23] tell him to do this could take care of
[1:10:25] him in the
[1:10:25] bad situations can't we tonight upon the
[1:10:29] basis of that young man giving his heart
[1:10:30] to christ
[1:10:31] stand upon this absolute that god can
[1:10:34] make the
[1:10:34] impossibles be possible he can change
[1:10:36] the hearts of judges
[1:10:38] [Applause]
[1:10:39] why do we skip so frantically about
[1:10:41] other things let's take god first
[1:10:44] bring it back to the promise god
[1:10:45] promised it if
[1:10:47] he would do it so remember moses was
[1:10:49] always
[1:10:50] a different person because he took god's
[1:10:52] word
[1:10:53] and believed it and he had a promise
[1:10:56] vindicated to him
[1:10:57] how many can we call we don't have time
[1:10:59] and writing note
[1:11:00] the day i was writing here of daniel how
[1:11:03] that it was a
[1:11:04] what it was it was a capital punishment
[1:11:07] for him to
[1:11:08] to pray to any other god but he had been
[1:11:10] in connection with god and he know that
[1:11:12] god was able to take care of him
[1:11:15] the hebrew children they'd be thrown
[1:11:17] into a fiery furnace
[1:11:18] and would be burned with heat seven
[1:11:20] times hotter than a furnace would ever
[1:11:22] be had
[1:11:23] that hebrew children believe god they
[1:11:26] said
[1:11:26] our god is able to deliver us from this
[1:11:29] furnace why
[1:11:30] they had had an absolute that had the
[1:11:32] word of god
[1:11:33] and the god that could deliver them
[1:11:35] hebrew children from the death cell
[1:11:37] of a fiery furnace how much more can he
[1:11:39] deliver this little jewish boy out here
[1:11:42] that's laying on her in a death cell how
[1:11:44] much more is in he's still the same
[1:11:46] jehovah god that he always was
[1:11:49] we like apostle paul can realize that
[1:11:51] same god
[1:11:52] lives today yesterday today and forever
[1:11:54] the same then christians can hold to
[1:11:56] god's unchanging hand and change the
[1:11:59] whole situation
[1:12:00] prayer changes things that's what we
[1:12:03] want to do
[1:12:04] how can we say about joshua how is he
[1:12:06] going to cross the jordan
[1:12:07] seemed like god was a strange military
[1:12:09] man right in the month of april when the
[1:12:11] waters was up like that but he said to
[1:12:13] joshua
[1:12:14] take the ark and go forward that's all
[1:12:16] he had to do
[1:12:17] and god moved back the jordan made dry
[1:12:20] grounds and they walked across
[1:12:21] and was delivered how well no one of
[1:12:23] joshua said for me and my house we'll
[1:12:26] serve the lord
[1:12:27] how david that great patriarch i would
[1:12:30] like to speak about him
[1:12:31] we have in time but in many times as we
[1:12:34] heard someone speaking a few moments ago
[1:12:36] about david
[1:12:37] and his sin but when all it was forgiven
[1:12:40] when he was going to
[1:12:41] battle and we call it in the world the
[1:12:43] chips were down
[1:12:45] and the opposition was great and david
[1:12:48] laid there under the tree and sweated
[1:12:50] out
[1:12:50] until he heard the sound going through
[1:12:52] the mulberry bushes
[1:12:54] then it was different david rose and
[1:12:56] went on
[1:12:57] because it he had an absolute that he
[1:12:59] knew that was god
[1:13:00] going on before him can't we pray a
[1:13:03] prayer of faith that will send
[1:13:04] god on to that parole board down there
[1:13:07] sure we can
[1:13:08] we believe that we can if we hold to
[1:13:11] that absolute
[1:13:12] how abraham called things that were not
[1:13:15] as though they were because
[1:13:16] he had an absolute promise from god
[1:13:19] that god was going to give him his give
[1:13:22] him a child by sarah when she was a
[1:13:24] hundred years old or he was and she was
[1:13:26] 90
[1:13:27] he still didn't stagger at the promise
[1:13:29] of god through unbelief but was strong
[1:13:31] giving praise to god
[1:13:32] and we claim to be abraham's children
[1:13:35] when abraham
[1:13:36] when we've had the bible wrote since the
[1:13:38] days of abraham
[1:13:39] and all the witnesses that we've had
[1:13:41] behind the jehovah keeps his word
[1:13:44] that christ is the son of god he's a
[1:13:46] mediator between
[1:13:47] man and god and there's no other
[1:13:48] mediator besides him and promising if
[1:13:51] you ask the father anything in my name
[1:13:53] it'll be granted
[1:13:54] and we claim to be the children of
[1:13:56] abraham when abraham called things that
[1:13:58] were as though they were not
[1:14:00] because he believed god absolutely
[1:14:03] i believe it with all my heart paul's
[1:14:06] christ-centered life
[1:14:07] was his absolute entity christ was the
[1:14:10] absolute of the resurrection
[1:14:12] as we read here he said god swore by an
[1:14:14] oath to david
[1:14:15] that he would not leave his soul in hell
[1:14:18] the oath is the end of all strife
[1:14:20] and he swore that he would not leave his
[1:14:22] soul in hell but would raise him up
[1:14:24] and therefore he trusted god and was
[1:14:27] crucified
[1:14:28] died rose again and ascended into heaven
[1:14:31] because he believed
[1:14:32] god how much more as he's setting the
[1:14:35] example
[1:14:35] can we take the absolute if christ could
[1:14:38] take it upon that one
[1:14:39] promise there how much more can we take
[1:14:42] it with thousands of promises
[1:14:44] with the blood of jesus christ there to
[1:14:46] cleanse our way and
[1:14:48] bring us across that great chasm of sin
[1:14:50] that separated us of unbelief from god
[1:14:52] and bring us right into his presence to
[1:14:54] talk to him
[1:14:55] how much more could it be yes we've got
[1:14:58] to have an
[1:14:59] absolute i'm thinking of one right now
[1:15:01] as in closing
[1:15:03] would be george washington when america
[1:15:06] was young
[1:15:07] and we were fighting for life the life
[1:15:10] of this great
[1:15:11] nation that we have george washington
[1:15:15] was a christian
[1:15:16] he was a believer and down at valley
[1:15:19] forge
[1:15:19] i'm told that the american soldiers only
[1:15:22] had about one-third of them had on
[1:15:24] shoes and the winter was cold and
[1:15:28] the zero weather and the river frozen
[1:15:31] and
[1:15:32] gorging over and the british on the
[1:15:34] other side
[1:15:35] and the life of this little nation
[1:15:38] was at hand what did he do he was a
[1:15:42] christian
[1:15:43] he goes out in the night time and kneels
[1:15:46] down in the snow and
[1:15:47] prays until he was wet with snow water
[1:15:50] up around his waistline
[1:15:52] and he stayed there and prayed until he
[1:15:55] got the absolute
[1:15:57] the answer from god that god was going
[1:15:59] to give him the victory and the next day
[1:16:01] that valley forge was nothing to him
[1:16:03] he crossed the delaware pushed through
[1:16:05] the ice with half
[1:16:07] dressed soldiers half frozen their bare
[1:16:09] feet on the ground in the snow
[1:16:11] and he took it when three rifle bullets
[1:16:13] went through his coat why
[1:16:14] he was trusting in the absolute of an
[1:16:16] answered prayer
[1:16:17] hey man the very backgrounds of our
[1:16:21] nation based upon such a thing what's
[1:16:23] the matter with people today who claim
[1:16:25] to be christians
[1:16:26] why are we disturbed an hour like this
[1:16:28] let's not be disturbed let's be
[1:16:30] soldiers yes sir he prayed until he got
[1:16:33] that answer
[1:16:34] that no clouded river no bare feet
[1:16:36] soldiers regardless of the circumstance
[1:16:39] they could take it because
[1:16:40] god had said so a bullet couldn't even
[1:16:42] kill him for an enemy's rival
[1:16:45] certainly why it had a prayer meeting he
[1:16:48] got the answer
[1:16:49] how well it was one night when apostle
[1:16:51] peter was in the jail
[1:16:53] and they were going to kill him the next
[1:16:55] morning he was going to die under
[1:16:57] capital punishment
[1:16:58] this little jews go to do now
[1:17:01] but what did they do they did the same
[1:17:03] thing that we here in houston are trying
[1:17:06] to do they formed a prayer meeting
[1:17:08] at john mark's house
[1:17:11] while they were praying the angel of the
[1:17:14] lord went to the prison
[1:17:16] and opened up the prison bars and opened
[1:17:18] the gates and beyond that
[1:17:19] led peter i'd come right down to the
[1:17:21] prayer meeting
[1:17:23] i believe tonight that that same god
[1:17:25] lives if he is the same god then did
[1:17:27] something wrong certainly what was it
[1:17:30] done
[1:17:31] by a prayer meeting by faithful
[1:17:34] christians
[1:17:34] who believe and believe that god would
[1:17:38] deliver
[1:17:38] their brother from capital punishment
[1:17:42] them were christians who stayed all
[1:17:44] night and laid up on their faces and
[1:17:47] cried out and prayed as i heard
[1:17:48] one of the ministers a while ago saying
[1:17:50] he's gonna cry out all night long
[1:17:53] the trouble of it is today people let
[1:17:55] down they get tired sleepy
[1:17:56] they can't even sit through a 10-minute
[1:17:58] service harley
[1:18:00] it's something wrong if you love god
[1:18:03] where we should be busy it should be our
[1:18:06] our hopes our desires it should be
[1:18:08] everything that's in us should be in the
[1:18:10] love of christ
[1:18:12] hey man we set so slawful
[1:18:15] we set so unconcerned when the world's
[1:18:18] dying under our feet
[1:18:19] that's right man's lives going out
[1:18:21] without god
[1:18:22] and we set so so unconcerned about as
[1:18:25] long as we belong to the church that's
[1:18:26] all we think it makes a difference
[1:18:28] i was talking about the coming of christ
[1:18:30] a few weeks ago
[1:18:31] in a certain church an effort says
[1:18:34] someone met me in the back of the church
[1:18:35] and said brother brandon you scare
[1:18:37] people to death
[1:18:38] i said why do i do that he said well
[1:18:40] you're talking about the coming of
[1:18:41] christ
[1:18:42] i don't want to hear such things as that
[1:18:43] i got a little boy here i got to raise i
[1:18:45] got a girl in school
[1:18:46] well i said the coming of christ is the
[1:18:48] most glorious thing i can think of
[1:18:51] certainly see the bible said all those
[1:18:55] who
[1:18:55] love his appearing whoa my for a day
[1:18:58] that when this old marvel take on
[1:19:00] immortality in this
[1:19:02] this past house that a living will be
[1:19:04] changed in a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:19:06] eye
[1:19:06] and a body like his own glorious body it
[1:19:08] should be the heart's desire the church
[1:19:10] it should be
[1:19:11] every man and woman on fire preaching
[1:19:13] the streets and everywhere else trying
[1:19:15] to get souls saying
[1:19:16] certainly i'm wondering if we really
[1:19:18] tied to that absolute that we claim to
[1:19:21] are we looking at the right morning star
[1:19:23] if we're just trusting in our
[1:19:25] church and our denomination our
[1:19:26] affiliation as the world changes it
[1:19:29] changes with that round and around but
[1:19:32] there's one star that never changed
[1:19:34] there's one thing you can ever change
[1:19:36] that's god
[1:19:37] god cannot change his word cannot change
[1:19:39] his
[1:19:40] bible cannot change and if a man is born
[1:19:43] to the spirit of god with christ in him
[1:19:45] it punctuates every promise with an amen
[1:19:48] that is right
[1:19:49] certainly oh sure a prayer meeting is
[1:19:52] what we need
[1:19:53] we must be christians all christians
[1:19:55] must use this same
[1:19:57] absolute the word of god god's word
[1:20:00] is the christian state jesus said in his
[1:20:03] word
[1:20:04] if ye abide me my words abide in you
[1:20:07] then you can
[1:20:08] ask what you will and it will be done
[1:20:10] for you
[1:20:11] think of it what more of an absolute
[1:20:14] would you want
[1:20:16] what could you trust more in than
[1:20:18] something like that if you abide in me
[1:20:20] my words abide in you then ask what you
[1:20:24] will
[1:20:26] to ask for god to work upon the heart of
[1:20:29] that
[1:20:29] judge or that parole board and get that
[1:20:32] little fella
[1:20:33] out of that death cell if we asked it
[1:20:35] with faith believing in these prayer
[1:20:36] meetings
[1:20:37] we'll get it that's i just believe god
[1:20:40] like that
[1:20:41] i'm my faith that i have and god that's
[1:20:43] why i'm here tonight that's why i
[1:20:45] canceled out something
[1:20:46] else and got in here and got to drive
[1:20:47] hundreds of miles a night
[1:20:49] back to tucson arizona because i come to
[1:20:52] put my faith with yours
[1:20:54] that's a matter of souling hunter it's
[1:20:57] someone in need
[1:20:58] and we christians have got to wake up to
[1:21:01] a reality
[1:21:02] to real genuine faith tied to the word
[1:21:05] of god and plead that promise
[1:21:07] yes sir oh my if you abide in me in my
[1:21:11] word and you ask what you want
[1:21:13] and again if the people is called by my
[1:21:15] name shall assemble themselves together
[1:21:18] and pray then out here from heaven
[1:21:20] prayer meeting that's it
[1:21:23] i believe in talking to attorneys and
[1:21:25] talking to
[1:21:26] lawyers or judges or parole boards or
[1:21:29] whatever more
[1:21:30] that's all right but brother if your
[1:21:32] hope isn't
[1:21:33] tied to something and it's a carnal man
[1:21:35] of mine a mind of man rather
[1:21:37] you're sure be sadly disappointed but if
[1:21:40] you can tie your
[1:21:41] faith into such a place that you know
[1:21:44] and stay there and pray
[1:21:45] until god answers back and you know
[1:21:47] you've got it in your heart something's
[1:21:48] going to happen
[1:21:50] i've seen the dead race from a funeral
[1:21:53] home i've seen the
[1:21:54] the blind eyes come open the deaf ears
[1:21:56] unstopped
[1:21:57] i've seen cancer-ridden cases of
[1:21:59] sarcomas cancer
[1:22:01] leprosy healed by the power of the
[1:22:03] almighty god because
[1:22:04] they had faith to believe that that god
[1:22:07] who made the promise
[1:22:08] would be able to keep his promise that's
[1:22:10] real genuine faith like abraham had
[1:22:14] hi to their stay there and pray not just
[1:22:16] get out and god
[1:22:17] deliver the poor little fella and send
[1:22:18] him home we'd all like that
[1:22:20] but let's stay there until something
[1:22:22] happens
[1:22:23] oh when something happens then that
[1:22:25] assures could fall amongst this little
[1:22:27] handful of people sitting in this
[1:22:29] auditorium here tonight could fall
[1:22:31] among us right you're enough faith and
[1:22:33] power of god if we could pray through
[1:22:34] till we strike that
[1:22:35] homeline to that absolute comes down
[1:22:38] that same
[1:22:38] pillar of fire that was taken here in
[1:22:40] houston by ted kipperman's
[1:22:43] camera 12 years ago he's here tonight
[1:22:46] just as great as he was then
[1:22:47] to deliver that boy if we'll just
[1:22:49] believe it because he's the same
[1:22:51] yesterday today and forever i believe it
[1:22:53] with all my heart
[1:22:55] that's why i'm here to offer my prayer
[1:22:57] with you all
[1:22:58] that god will spare their life then if
[1:23:00] you can pray through
[1:23:02] until you've got to answer back got the
[1:23:04] assurance back like
[1:23:06] washington had like john mark had like
[1:23:08] daniel had
[1:23:09] like moses had so you've got an absolute
[1:23:12] something that you know that you can
[1:23:14] anchor to then up
[1:23:16] on this absolute i'll build my church
[1:23:19] and all the
[1:23:21] courts in the land cannot resist that's
[1:23:24] right
[1:23:25] upon that the very god that could take a
[1:23:27] little hook knows
[1:23:28] you like paul angry and going down there
[1:23:30] to put all the christians to death under
[1:23:32] capital punishment and could change him
[1:23:34] and make him a lovely christian
[1:23:36] that same god lives tonight can change
[1:23:38] law to grace any time that he takes an
[1:23:40] ocean to do it
[1:23:41] hallelujah you go to call me a holy
[1:23:44] roller anyhow so i might as well get
[1:23:45] started
[1:23:46] right now i believe that god amen
[1:23:49] yes sir then mark 11 22 when you prayed
[1:23:52] to
[1:23:52] he said i verily verily i say unto you
[1:23:54] have faith in god
[1:23:56] i say unto you if you say to this
[1:23:58] mountain be moved
[1:23:59] when that absolute has come to you when
[1:24:01] you're anointed with that spirit that
[1:24:03] comes beyond all
[1:24:04] scientific control out yonder before
[1:24:06] there was an atom or a molecule
[1:24:08] that one has spoke everything into
[1:24:10] existence
[1:24:11] and when your soul is anchored to that
[1:24:13] there's nothing can stop it
[1:24:15] that's right say to this mountain be
[1:24:17] moved and don't doubt in your heart but
[1:24:18] believe that what you've said will come
[1:24:20] to pass
[1:24:21] you can have what you said if that ain't
[1:24:23] absolute to whole to
[1:24:25] certainly it is that's right an absolute
[1:24:27] now
[1:24:29] the nation has absolute your home life
[1:24:31] has absolute
[1:24:32] everywhere if it's ever going to achieve
[1:24:34] anything it's got to have an absolute
[1:24:36] we appreciate this attorney we
[1:24:38] appreciate all the other man
[1:24:40] this fine chaplain for here from
[1:24:42] california and what a marvelous message
[1:24:45] and our brother who tried to take the
[1:24:47] money and everything to try to help this
[1:24:48] poor woman
[1:24:49] and and with their children to deliver
[1:24:51] them that's all fine and
[1:24:53] we appreciate that and i'm for it but
[1:24:55] there's one thing beyond that friends
[1:24:58] when we're closing this meeting tonight
[1:24:59] we must tie it to an absolute
[1:25:02] a prayer meeting before god that will
[1:25:04] send the deliverers from the same
[1:25:06] jehovah
[1:25:06] god just as much god denied as he was
[1:25:09] saying
[1:25:10] hallelujah do you believe it let's stand
[1:25:13] up to our feet then
[1:25:14] and tonight form a prayer meeting in
[1:25:16] here until an
[1:25:17] absolute takes place raise up our hands
[1:25:20] before
[1:25:20] god pray until you strike home until an
[1:25:23] absolute falls into your heart lord god
[1:25:26] send your
[1:25:27] holy spirit down and sin and free those
[1:25:31] children your lord
[1:25:32] they're sitting in the regions of the
[1:25:34] shadows of death
[1:25:35] something sticks in the half and lord
[1:25:37] and we pray that these prayer meetings
[1:25:39] will strike far
[1:25:40] i believe you lord i'm accepting it and
[1:25:43] i believe that you'll deliver those
[1:25:45] children
[1:25:46] read it almighty god we your church
[1:25:49] asked it through
[1:25:50] jesus christ
[1:25:56] oh my can you take god at his word today
[1:25:59] like that
[1:26:01] can you know him in an assurity that he
[1:26:03] never fails
[1:26:07] it's it's it's inspiring to hear
[1:26:10] brother brandon preaching that way but
[1:26:13] even more so let it become an experience
[1:26:15] in your life
[1:26:17] that you're just as sure you're just as
[1:26:20] set you're believing that
[1:26:23] amen i don't know the results of that
[1:26:27] that boy they were praying for but i
[1:26:28] know god had it in his hands
[1:26:31] and i believe that the anchor holds
[1:26:36] though the ship is battered
[1:26:38] [Music]
[1:26:42] the anchor home
[1:26:48] though the ship is better
[1:27:09] i have fallen
[1:27:12] on my ears
[1:27:19] [Music]
[1:27:22] [Applause]
[1:27:28] in spite of the one more time
[1:27:47] the anger
[1:28:01] i have fallen
[1:28:06] [Music]
[1:28:12] on
[1:28:14] [Applause]
[1:28:20] in spite of the storms when brother
[1:28:28] murrell was
[1:28:29] praying and he said
[1:28:32] lord you know our thoughts you know
[1:28:34] everything about us
[1:28:36] and sometimes that might put a little
[1:28:38] fear in you
[1:28:41] but if you take him ahead his word he
[1:28:43] says if you'll confess
[1:28:45] and if he'll put it through the blood
[1:28:46] it's gone it's clear
[1:28:49] and you take a stand on that and you
[1:28:52] believe it you begin to take god at his
[1:28:54] word in everything he says
[1:28:56] and let that peace of god settle in your
[1:28:58] heart
[1:28:59] in in that atmosphere you create about
[1:29:02] yourself
[1:29:03] you know you might have come to church
[1:29:05] today and
[1:29:07] maybe you kneel down to pray and you
[1:29:08] start thinking and your mind starts to
[1:29:10] battle with
[1:29:11] the day you had or the problems you
[1:29:13] might have had
[1:29:14] but set all that aside and say lord i'm
[1:29:17] talking to you
[1:29:18] i'm going to you today and just
[1:29:21] believing that so
[1:29:22] we appreciate that the grace of god and
[1:29:27] the the excitement the um the energy
[1:29:30] that brother branham had
[1:29:31] to know that this god is alive and well
[1:29:35] by experience not by somebody else's
[1:29:37] testimony
[1:29:38] but by experience so i appreciate the
[1:29:41] grace of god to us to allow us to hear
[1:29:43] that
[1:29:45] and to know that i was telling brother
[1:29:48] jordan and went back there to give him
[1:29:50] the
[1:29:51] sermon because i forgot to tell him what
[1:29:53] it was and i just read an article today
[1:29:57] earlier somebody had posted about what
[1:30:00] the
[1:30:01] rich people that the very wealthy people
[1:30:03] are doing to prepare for the catastrophe
[1:30:05] they're
[1:30:06] expecting on this earth line up land in
[1:30:09] places
[1:30:10] that the oceans won't reach and they
[1:30:13] begin
[1:30:13] then to lay out all their plans what
[1:30:15] they're doing what they're thinking
[1:30:17] about because they know something's
[1:30:18] coming
[1:30:19] there's no question about it and where
[1:30:22] safety would be and
[1:30:24] the one thing i noticed they said it
[1:30:26] won't be caused by an earthquake
[1:30:28] it's going to be caused by something
[1:30:30] else i said the word of god tells us it
[1:30:33] will be caused by an earthquake
[1:30:36] so god keeps his word we know that but
[1:30:38] they're making all these plans
[1:30:40] to save their lives but we have an
[1:30:43] absolute
[1:30:44] we've committed our lives ourselves to
[1:30:46] jesus christ
[1:30:48] and just like those he's talked about
[1:30:50] daniel and the three hebrew children who
[1:30:52] said
[1:30:53] though they tell me and though god slays
[1:30:56] me yet i'll trust him
[1:30:58] that's our trust and that's our hope
[1:31:00] today so we stand on that
[1:31:02] [Music]
[1:31:04] i talked to my brother fred today and
[1:31:08] and he had the cancer in the
[1:31:11] esophagus and they declared him
[1:31:14] cancer-free
[1:31:15] on the last test and he said
[1:31:18] tell them tell them thank you for prayer
[1:31:20] because we know that's
[1:31:22] that's what would cause that to and we
[1:31:25] stand on that
[1:31:27] and if this old body fails i've got
[1:31:29] another one
[1:31:31] that's waiting for me nothing to fear so
[1:31:33] we appreciate that
[1:31:34] [Music]
[1:31:37] my daughter rachel and naomi took
[1:31:41] nina to the airport up in mesa to fly
[1:31:44] home
[1:31:46] and they were on their way back and nina
[1:31:48] called them and said my flight's been
[1:31:49] canceled
[1:31:51] and something happened with the crew and
[1:31:53] they couldn't fly so
[1:31:55] they drove back up to bring her back
[1:31:57] down and she's going to stay till
[1:31:58] saturday now so we're okay with that
[1:32:03] but god knows why you don't know the
[1:32:06] circumstances
[1:32:07] and i know stephen is probably a little
[1:32:09] disappointed or maybe he's not i don't
[1:32:11] know
[1:32:12] but i know they were talking to each
[1:32:13] other yesterday and they were missing
[1:32:15] each other quite a bit
[1:32:16] but god has it all in his hands and we
[1:32:19] appreciate that god would do those
[1:32:21] things for us
[1:32:22] brother jordan had to sing in the
[1:32:25] presence of jehovah
[1:32:27] troubles vanish everything when you can
[1:32:30] get into that presence rather than
[1:32:32] what's going on around you and let that
[1:32:35] settle in your heart
[1:32:36] so we'll sing that song with just a
[1:32:39] couple of announcements
[1:32:40] before we go but
[1:32:45] again this this sunday morning service

[1:33:23] will have more information as to
[1:33:25] which way to go forward also next sunday

[1:33:50] of our 42nd

[1:33:54] for a few days
[1:33:56] but uh god said he'd be with us and
