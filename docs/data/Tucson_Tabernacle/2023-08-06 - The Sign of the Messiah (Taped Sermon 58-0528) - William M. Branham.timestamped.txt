[30:33] seeds
[30:34] [Music]
[30:36] um you can stop playing for just a
[30:37] minute
[30:40] just a minute I
[30:43] felt the
[30:46] I really felt the presence of the Lord
[30:48] this morning
[30:49] I believe that we're in the Lord's will
[30:51] and in doing what we're doing and
[30:53] following the leading having brother Eli
[30:57] Minister for us
[30:59] and I felt like
[31:01] the Lord told me something
[31:05] as I said I felt like it I felt a
[31:07] Feeling
[31:08] that the Lord was leading me
[31:11] for tonight's service and I have all of
[31:14] my notes here and I don't believe that
[31:18] he wants me to minister on this tonight
[31:22] um
[31:24] I don't know sometimes you you just want
[31:27] to do you want to do what the Lord wants
[31:29] you to do and you put this together and
[31:31] you work all the way up to the end and
[31:34] then he says no
[31:36] and his nose are just as good as his
[31:39] yeses
[31:40] I was I was so bla blessed this morning
[31:44] brother Eli
[31:46] in his subject on prayer
[31:49] brother Eli did not know that I was
[31:52] planning on having the people come for
[31:55] prayer this morning and yet he preached
[31:58] on that
[31:59] and
[32:01] lifted the people's faith and then the
[32:04] people came and I believed that there
[32:06] were many that received what they were
[32:08] asking for this morning
[32:11] we put God first
[32:15] brother Eli some of the things that he
[32:17] said they really struck my heart and
[32:20] what he said he said he says pray first
[32:23] and then you might not have to pray
[32:25] later to clean up the mess that you made
[32:28] and you know the young Brothers was
[32:31] talking about prayer and and talking
[32:33] about the time that we spent he said
[32:35] that Jesus had a Ministry of three and a
[32:38] half years
[32:39] three and a half years a short space of
[32:42] time and yet he spent that time in
[32:44] prayer
[32:46] 30 30 years old
[32:49] when he began preaching the gospel and
[32:51] how much prayer was there from that time
[32:54] until 30 years old
[32:57] and yet during that Ministry that was to
[33:00] change the world and bring Salvation
[33:03] he spent it in prayer
[33:06] so how important is praying how
[33:09] important is it to put these things
[33:11] before the Lord and and say Lord
[33:14] whatever you want but I'm going to spend
[33:16] this time and he's and he said this he
[33:18] said if you spend hours in prayer with
[33:20] God then you'll spend seconds dealing
[33:22] with man
[33:24] and then he likened it
[33:26] he talked about all of this time and and
[33:29] as he was talking I was thinking about I
[33:31] was thinking about a sprinter and an
[33:34] athlete and how much that they train and
[33:38] how much that they work and and and what
[33:40] they go through the hours every day of
[33:43] sprinting and and doing the different
[33:45] exercises and that all for 10 seconds on
[33:48] the track
[33:50] 10 seconds it's over and all of that
[33:53] time spent in training and that's how
[33:56] prayer is
[33:57] we pray and we spend all this time
[34:00] trying to get ready and and Lord and
[34:03] seeking the Lord and people were coming
[34:05] through the prayer line this morning and
[34:07] they were seeking God with all that
[34:09] heart and many of them said but I just
[34:11] can't break through
[34:13] I can't I can't I can't get past
[34:16] something
[34:19] Maybe
[34:21] maybe that thing that you're trying to
[34:25] get past
[34:27] maybe that's called the second coming of
[34:29] the Lord
[34:31] maybe that is the rapture and when we
[34:34] can all get to that place through prayer
[34:37] if we can get to that place
[34:41] will go up
[34:42] but we will never be content
[34:46] but Andy if we're content why would we
[34:48] want to pray
[34:50] why would be a there would be such a
[34:52] desire a burning desire to pray if we
[34:55] have everything that we need it's God's
[34:57] way
[34:59] he wants us to spend this time in prayer
[35:02] he wants us he wants our dedicated time
[35:06] as the athlete
[35:09] he needs that that athlete needs that
[35:13] time in training
[35:15] or he'll fail
[35:17] he won't win
[35:19] but if he spends the time if he works
[35:21] hard then a few seconds
[35:25] and he's won the race and the same with
[35:27] us with these people coming
[35:30] in the prayer line how much do we owe
[35:34] those people especially the brothers
[35:37] standing up here
[35:40] how much do we owe these people
[35:43] this time in prayer all of those hours
[35:46] for just a few seconds someone coming
[35:49] that needs healing
[35:51] someone coming that needs Deliverance
[35:53] someone coming that needs their family
[35:54] back
[35:56] we need to spend that time we owe it to
[35:58] one another
[35:59] it is prayer is the most important thing
[36:05] as our brother said this morning
[36:07] it's the most powerful weapon ever to
[36:09] ever placed in the hands of man
[36:11] is prayer Jesus Christ himself the son
[36:15] of God
[36:16] prayed all night long before he chose
[36:19] his disciples
[36:21] what an example our lord Jesus was to us
[36:26] pray or is that pray pray the only way
[36:31] to bring to reach Higher Ground
[36:34] I love it
[36:36] what's the rest of it sister surely pray
[36:38] pray the prayer of faith bring God's
[36:40] blessings down amen
[36:43] and it's the same with us
[36:45] pray
[36:47] try to find the will of God and and
[36:50] another thing the brother said this
[36:52] morning he says that we're always trying
[36:54] to find the hand of God
[36:56] we always need our healing we always
[36:59] need deliverance we always need this but
[37:01] instead of always trying the hand of God
[37:03] why don't we seek the will of God
[37:06] if we were seeking the will of God at
[37:08] first then we wouldn't necessarily need
[37:11] the hand of God later we would be in his
[37:15] will
[37:16] and that's my desire that's that's my
[37:19] desire for this church Lord let us be in
[37:21] your will
[37:23] whatever it is
[37:25] and I was this morning as I was standing
[37:28] about right here
[37:29] and I was looking out at the people
[37:31] worshiping and and I was just feeling
[37:33] the presence of the Holy Spirit I said
[37:35] Lord what do you want me to do
[37:37] and I even told some of the brothers
[37:41] um
[37:41] that I don't feel
[37:44] necessarily that this message that I
[37:46] have today would be good to follow that
[37:48] that we had this morning and the Lord
[37:51] confirmed it
[37:52] I don't think he wanted it either
[37:54] well thank God thank God I want to be in
[37:58] his will
[37:59] if we and if we walk if we walk in that
[38:03] will
[38:05] then everything
[38:07] the Seas the Seas the ocean will part
[38:13] it'll wall up on both sides and we'll
[38:16] walk through on dry ground as it has
[38:18] happened with the children of Israel
[38:20] same thing happened with Elijah and
[38:22] Elisha they came up to this Jordan River
[38:24] it was swollen Elijah took off his
[38:27] mantle he smote it the water dried up
[38:30] and across they went
[38:32] then here comes then Elijah goes up in
[38:35] the chair Here Comes Elisha he has the
[38:38] same mantle Elijah's gone he he threw
[38:41] down his mantle to Elijah Elisha Elisha
[38:43] walks up there to that river that now
[38:45] had water in again and what did he say
[38:48] where is the god of Elijah and the same
[38:52] God did the same thing and he'll do the
[38:55] same thing for us he will always do it
[38:58] if we will put our faith in him and we
[39:03] will spend that time in prayer I have in
[39:05] my notes they're sitting back there I
[39:07] wrote down in all capital letters I will
[39:11] pray more
[39:13] and I will
[39:15] it just it just so on my heart pray
[39:20] bring this these things before the Lord
[39:23] before they happen
[39:26] pray before you have problems when times
[39:29] are good Pray when times are bad Pray
[39:31] when you're driving home pray
[39:34] before you go to sleep Pray when you
[39:36] wake up Pray when you're going through
[39:37] the day pray
[39:39] talk to the Lord
[39:42] the Lord Jesus
[39:44] the the Bible tells us right at the very
[39:48] beginning of the book
[39:52] in Genesis
[39:54] the Bible tells us that God our brother
[39:57] said it this morning that God created
[40:00] man in his own image
[40:04] so with me with my children I'm a Man
[40:07] created in the image of God
[40:10] so does that mean God has feelings
[40:12] you bet it does
[40:14] if I have feelings I made in His image
[40:18] so how do I want my children to be with
[40:22] me I've been missing my boy my girl
[40:25] lately my son's at the camp and my my
[40:28] girls in Jeffersonville and I just I
[40:30] love them so much and I just want to
[40:32] talk to them I love them and it makes me
[40:35] feel so good when they call me
[40:38] when they want to talk to me I'm daddy
[40:41] his father
[40:43] and we are his children
[40:45] why don't we talk to him
[40:48] why don't we call him
[40:50] he's easier than getting on your phone
[40:55] Lord I need to talk to you I want I want
[40:59] to talk to you Lord listen to me I told
[41:02] the story about when Daniel was little
[41:06] and
[41:07] you know he was this little guy and and
[41:09] he had a funny speech you couldn't
[41:11] understand what he was saying and and he
[41:14] would grab Stephanie's face or my face
[41:17] when he was a little guy he wanted us to
[41:19] hear him and he would grab his face and
[41:21] say mommy listen to me
[41:24] daddy listen to me
[41:28] and we listened to the little guy and
[41:31] that's how we are with the Lord Jesus we
[41:33] get down on our knees and say father
[41:35] father listen to me and you know what
[41:40] he loves us more than we love our
[41:43] children
[41:44] we are not even capable of love like he
[41:49] is capable of love how beautiful
[41:53] how beautiful is our father
[41:57] so much so that he went through all of
[42:00] these thousands of years
[42:02] being up there and he could not have
[42:05] fellowship with us there was this gulf
[42:09] of sin that separated God from his
[42:13] children
[42:15] by his own law
[42:17] there was this separation that God
[42:20] couldn't have that Fellowship that he
[42:23] wanted to with man
[42:25] he only came down once a year in the
[42:29] temple my brother what's your name
[42:31] right here from uh from Louisville
[42:33] what's your name
[42:35] brother God bless you welcome welcome my
[42:38] brother I I
[42:41] um they told me that that you were here
[42:42] and I just want to welcome you to the
[42:44] Tabernacle
[42:47] brother
[42:49] he was separated from us
[42:52] through this veil of sin
[42:55] then once a year one time a year they
[42:59] would go in the the high priest just one
[43:02] person
[43:03] just one man would represent all of the
[43:05] human race he would go into the
[43:07] tabernacle into the holy of holies
[43:09] behind this thick curtain go back there
[43:12] and then the presence of God would come
[43:16] down one man
[43:18] one man
[43:21] and yet God wanted this fellowship with
[43:25] his people
[43:26] he needed it he he was their father
[43:31] he was our father
[43:33] and how he wants to talk to us
[43:35] How He Loves Us
[43:38] and then
[43:41] because he was a spirit
[43:44] up in heaven as I've said in the Book of
[43:47] Revelation it says that that he's up
[43:49] there and around his throne
[43:53] or a hundred thousand thousand two
[43:55] hundred thousand thousand Angels a
[43:57] hundred million angels surround his
[44:00] throne
[44:02] flying around and they're seeing holy
[44:04] holy holy unto the Lord
[44:07] and there he is up there Isaiah sees a
[44:10] vision of this
[44:12] and he sees that no man
[44:14] can come there or else he die and he
[44:17] Isaiah himself the prophet of God
[44:18] probably the most holy man in the whole
[44:20] world he goes and he says that I'm gonna
[44:23] die because I saw God
[44:25] this gulf of sin that's separated even
[44:29] the most righteous of all the people on
[44:31] Earth this man Isaiah
[44:34] could not even come
[44:36] into the presence of God without
[44:38] thinking that he was going to die
[44:41] years past and then finally God's plan
[44:45] came came to pass he was a spirit he
[44:47] said I am going to come down in flesh
[44:51] and fellowship
[44:52] with my people
[44:55] so he comes down he fellowships with his
[44:57] people and we've gone through the book
[44:59] of Acts and and and we see how God has
[45:03] moved among the people we go through the
[45:06] gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John we
[45:08] see Jesus walking through for this three
[45:11] and a half years with his people and how
[45:13] much he loved them and he was teaching
[45:15] them he only had this three and a half
[45:17] years to teach him
[45:19] and yet as our brother said this morning
[45:21] he prayed
[45:23] he spent that time in prayer and then
[45:28] teaching
[45:30] and he taught them
[45:31] he said
[45:33] things that they never would have
[45:35] imagined
[45:36] he said things like
[45:39] like prefer your brother if somebody
[45:42] slaps you in the face turn the other
[45:44] side and let him slap that side
[45:48] they're like what that's not what Moses
[45:49] said
[45:51] Moses said an eye for an eye Jesus said
[45:53] no
[45:54] no that was a law
[45:57] there was no Grace there
[45:59] but then Jesus comes a man full of grace
[46:02] a man full of love he was the very
[46:05] essence of love he comes down three and
[46:07] a half years he preaches and then he
[46:09] goes to the cross
[46:12] dies for our sins
[46:15] way back when in the Garden of Eden
[46:18] we see
[46:20] there was a
[46:23] a woman named Eve
[46:25] a man named Adam
[46:28] and then there was this evil
[46:31] spirit
[46:33] that came
[46:36] in the form
[46:38] of this serpent
[46:39] a man can talk
[46:43] reason
[46:46] Eve comes before him
[46:50] they
[46:51] the serpent says you don't have to
[46:54] believe everything that God says
[46:57] God's a good God he wouldn't he wouldn't
[46:59] kill you if you do this
[47:02] he was afraid he fell she caused her
[47:05] husband he fell and then they're they're
[47:08] hiding in the bushes God's walking
[47:11] through the Garden of Eden he says Adam
[47:13] my son where are you
[47:17] Adam comes out and he says
[47:19] he's here he says I was embarrassed he
[47:22] said I was ashamed
[47:24] because I was naked
[47:25] God says wait a minute
[47:27] how did you know you were naked you were
[47:29] pure
[47:31] you were just a pure human being you
[47:34] were you were made in my image how do
[47:37] you know these evil things
[47:41] it came back to the serpent and there
[47:44] they are
[47:46] God looks at them and he goes to a
[47:49] defenseless animal probably a lamb and
[47:52] he kills it
[47:53] the first sacrifice
[47:57] four thousand years later
[47:59] Jesus is against sacrificed
[48:02] not in this time not to just stay the
[48:06] wrath of God but this time
[48:08] he made it to where God could not only
[48:12] communicate
[48:14] with not just the high priest over here
[48:17] behind the curtain
[48:20] but he made it to where he could enter
[48:22] in
[48:24] to the body of not just the high priest
[48:27] but the body of every single person who
[48:31] loves God
[48:33] that he could be with them all times
[48:38] prayer
[48:39] the prayer of Jesus Christ standing
[48:43] strong and Jesus Jesus prayed for his
[48:46] people that they would be one as he and
[48:49] the father are one
[48:51] and here we are
[48:53] together
[48:57] are we One Like Jesus prayed that we
[49:01] would be one
[49:03] are we reaching out that's what I wanted
[49:05] to talk about in my notes that and I
[49:08] will get to that at a different time
[49:10] but the prayer of Christ and then we see
[49:13] this man Paul come on the scene and Paul
[49:16] prayed and the things I was telling my
[49:18] wife this morning I was in tears he said
[49:21] Paul Paul goes and he says I have I have
[49:24] a leading to go to Jerusalem
[49:26] I want to get there I want to get there
[49:29] and I want a fellowship with my brethren
[49:32] and everybody was prophesying and saying
[49:34] don't go Paul don't go you're going to
[49:35] die if you go over there
[49:37] Paul said but I feel to go
[49:40] and then Paul made this statement
[49:43] he said I would
[49:47] that I
[49:50] would be lost
[49:53] rather than my brethren
[49:56] my Jewish Brothers in Jerusalem these
[49:59] people that treated him so badly
[50:02] these people that gave him problems he
[50:04] said I would rather that I would not
[50:06] even enter into the kingdom
[50:09] rather than have them be lost
[50:12] talk about the spirit of Christ on this
[50:14] man Paul and how he prayed and how he
[50:17] wanted
[50:19] to lift up this man Jesus Christ
[50:22] because he knew he knew if they would
[50:25] accept Christ
[50:28] that they would be saved and it was
[50:31] everything to Paul
[50:33] he loved people he wanted them to be
[50:36] saved and I look out at
[50:39] us
[50:41] brother
[50:43] where is our burden for people that they
[50:47] would be saved
[50:50] where is it and we see such a division
[50:52] if you don't see it like I see it
[50:55] then you don't matter I don't care about
[50:57] you
[50:59] a Christian Paul he said I would rather
[51:02] be lost than have these ones that have
[51:05] given me so many problems
[51:07] then then be lost
[51:10] do we have that same spirit
[51:13] we need it
[51:15] and it'll come through prayer
[51:19] when I was
[51:21] sitting there in the back and
[51:23] I was like Lord what do you want me to
[51:25] do
[51:27] you want me to minister on this and I
[51:30] felt no I went back I I
[51:33] stood back there with brother Lyle
[51:36] and I said no he doesn't want me to do
[51:38] it
[51:40] and I felt
[51:44] to listen
[51:46] to a sermon
[51:48] of a man who truly did pray
[51:51] a Man Who Loved God so much that he
[51:56] dedicated his life
[51:58] to serving others and that he would pray
[52:02] he and God would answer his prayer
[52:06] why because he spent the hours in the
[52:08] prayer in prayer for 10 seconds with a
[52:10] man in the prayer line or woman in the
[52:12] prayer line
[52:13] that was this man
[52:15] and that's the man that I want to hear
[52:17] tonight standing in the door right here
[52:19] I came to this place Lord I don't know
[52:22] what to do I can preach on another
[52:24] subject what do you want me to do
[52:25] walking up here and then our brother
[52:27] sings only believe
[52:30] if you don't know only believe is a song
[52:34] that brother William Marion Branham
[52:37] would come to the pulpit
[52:39] he sings it it was on My Heart Lord what
[52:41] do you want me to do
[52:44] my question
[52:46] is answered
[52:48] I want us to hear
[52:50] this man
[52:53] named William Branham tonight preach a
[52:56] sermon called The Sign of the Messiah
[53:01] brother Branham talked about the sign of
[53:03] the Messiah as being when Jesus
[53:06] many times it was when the woman with
[53:09] the blood issue came through touched His
[53:11] Garment he turned he said virtue has
[53:13] gone from me he knew the secrets of her
[53:15] heart he knew the secrets of the heart
[53:16] of the of the woman at the well he knew
[53:19] that she had sinned that she had all
[53:21] these husbands she was living in sin and
[53:23] he knew these things that was Jesus then
[53:26] we see Peter here after he's filled with
[53:28] the Holy Spirit you see we see ananias
[53:30] and Sapphira Come Peter knew that they
[53:32] had cheated God he showed that same sign
[53:35] that sign had been so rare and then boom
[53:39] it shows up again in our day
[53:42] that sign of God
[53:45] and it was a warning
[53:47] a warning that one day soon that our
[53:51] lord Jesus would return
[53:55] we don't have
[53:57] the whole sermon
[53:59] that I want to play tonight
[54:01] it ends
[54:04] at 32 minutes
[54:07] but I know because I've heard him so
[54:09] many times I know what happened after
[54:12] that
[54:13] and that is brother Branham started
[54:15] going through
[54:17] each
[54:18] each person and started showing that
[54:22] sign and Discerning and when the Lord
[54:25] Jesus is here
[54:26] just as Adam and Eve they were
[54:28] embarrassed and they were covering up
[54:30] themselves that's how we are before the
[54:32] Lord
[54:33] we can't hide anything
[54:36] and you don't want to hide anything you
[54:39] want that blood of Jesus Christ to cover
[54:40] you and the only way friends is to spend
[54:44] that time in prayer and the man that we
[54:46] are going to hear tonight spent the time
[54:49] in prayer
[54:51] that is this man
[54:53] William Marion Branham
[54:56] I'm so honored
[54:58] that I can introduce him
[55:00] he's gone
[55:04] the Lord saw fit to take him away but he
[55:08] left
[55:10] sermons for us
[55:12] to enjoy and to see to listen to these
[55:16] sermons and to see that God is still
[55:19] alive
[55:21] let's all stand
[55:23] my brother if you would lead us with our
[55:25] theme song
[55:28] [Music]
[55:39] all things are possible
[55:46] only
[55:48] believe
[55:50] my Lord
[55:53] [Music]
[56:04] all things are possible
[56:10] [Music]
[56:12] only be
[56:14] [Music]
[56:15] amen friends you can be seated
[56:19] 1958 May the 28th brother Madam preached
[56:23] this sermon
[56:44] he didn't do that
[56:48] he said the sun can do nothing in
[56:51] himself but what he sees the father
[56:54] doing that's who it's a son lifeline the
[56:58] father worketh and I worketh hitherto
[57:01] for the Young Folks Jesus saw a vision
[57:05] what God wanted him to do and he just
[57:08] acted it out in drama
[57:10] you should have been with us at the
[57:12] dinner table today to watch
[57:13] the same thing take place
[57:16] now
[57:17] notice
[57:20] that's the scripture says that
[57:23] he spoke these words a little while and
[57:26] the world will see me no more that's the
[57:29] unbeliever
[57:31] yet ye shall see me
[57:33] for I'll be with you even in you to the
[57:38] end of the world
[57:41] now is that true or isn't it true let's
[57:44] just talk it out and reason Among Us
[57:48] is that the truth ah as a personal
[57:51] pronoun I'll be with you
[57:55] in you until the end of the world a
[57:58] little while in the unbeliever the
[58:00] church world will be issued in and
[58:01] they'll see me no more but the church
[58:04] itself ye
[58:07] I'll be with you in you to the end of
[58:12] the age
[58:14] the world it hasn't come to the end yet
[58:17] so Christ Remains the Same
[58:20] now he said I am divine
[58:24] ye are the branches
[58:27] now the vine doesn't bear fruit of
[58:29] itself
[58:30] it only purges the branches and the
[58:33] branches bears fruit do you know that
[58:37] well then if you went to a grapevine
[58:39] what would you expect to find
[58:41] great
[58:43] if you went to a watermelon vine you
[58:46] find watermelon if it's a fertile dime
[58:49] if you went to a peach tree you'd find
[58:51] peaches
[58:54] but then if you if Christ is divine and
[58:58] his members of the church is the
[59:00] branches what ought you to find in the
[59:03] church
[59:06] The Works that I do shall you also more
[59:09] than initial you do for I go to my
[59:12] father
[59:14] what do you find when you go to church
[59:16] we are the Presbyterian we are the
[59:18] Baptist we are the Pentecostals we got
[59:20] the message we got this that's not
[59:23] Christ
[59:25] Christ is love because he was God
[59:30] have this will all men know you're my
[59:32] disciples when you have loved one for
[59:35] the other
[59:36] but we won't go down to that meeting our
[59:38] church is not cooperating all right
[59:42] all the fathers did and it will come
[59:46] said Jesus now notice
[59:49] now let's search the scripture then and
[59:52] find out just what he did back there
[59:54] that the people would know that he was
[59:56] the Messiah
[59:58] and whatever he did then to prove to the
[1:00:02] people he was a messiah
[1:00:04] then he's got to do the same now or he
[1:00:08] isn't the same yesterday today and
[1:00:10] forever you believe that
[1:00:12] now we all know that we are churches
[1:00:15] says different all because it we uh have
[1:00:20] this denomination we have this charity
[1:00:22] those things are fine but that's not
[1:00:25] what Christ did and that's not what he
[1:00:26] said to do
[1:00:29] not at all
[1:00:32] so notice let's turn back we're reading
[1:00:35] and Saint John let's go back to the
[1:00:37] first chapter we're on the 12th let's go
[1:00:39] back to the first chapter and find out
[1:00:41] reason he amazes these quotations the
[1:00:43] way he did here all right thank God the
[1:00:45] first century
[1:00:47] we find out here that after he was
[1:00:50] baptized and the Holy Spirit was on him
[1:00:52] which was God and he had the spirit
[1:00:55] without measure
[1:00:58] we have it by Major
[1:01:01] here's the ID all the water that's out
[1:01:04] there in the ocean with the spirit that
[1:01:05] was in Christ watching us as a spoonful
[1:01:08] out of that ocean
[1:01:10] but the same tentacles are in the
[1:01:13] Spoonful that's in the entire ocean it's
[1:01:15] not as much of it he had it all the
[1:01:17] waters was in him and we have a spoonful
[1:01:20] here's what he was God made flesh into
[1:01:23] all Among Us
[1:01:25] he was Emmanuel
[1:01:27] but we are adopted children by his grace
[1:01:31] now after he had received the Holy Ghost
[1:01:35] in the fullness of the Holy Ghost where
[1:01:37] we received the baptism he received the
[1:01:40] fullness of the Holy Spirit
[1:01:41] now we find that immediately his
[1:01:44] ministry begins during Saint John 1.
[1:01:47] and there was a certain man who got
[1:01:49] saved and as quick as he got faith he
[1:01:53] went for his brother's Simon
[1:01:56] and he brought his brother back in the
[1:01:58] presence of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:00] and when Jesus saw him for the first
[1:02:03] time he told him
[1:02:05] what his name was
[1:02:07] and told him he was going to change it
[1:02:09] from Simon to Peter's season
[1:02:13] did he do that
[1:02:15] and he told him what his father's name
[1:02:17] was Jonas
[1:02:19] said thou or your name is Simon you're
[1:02:23] the son of Jonas
[1:02:26] I remember this is the first thing and
[1:02:30] Caesar was a ignorant and unlearned in
[1:02:33] name he never had any education he could
[1:02:35] not even sign his own name the Bible
[1:02:38] said he was ignorant and unlearned
[1:02:42] if education plays such a big part what
[1:02:45] about that and that man was given the
[1:02:47] keys to the kingdom of heaven
[1:02:51] where we gone to with all of our schools
[1:02:53] now I'm not saying we don't have them
[1:02:55] but you're putting too much emphasis on
[1:02:57] your education
[1:03:00] that's all right but that'll never save
[1:03:03] you
[1:03:04] don't watch it'll damn you
[1:03:07] education has been the greatest hinder
[1:03:09] since the gospel has ever had
[1:03:12] that's right because people try to
[1:03:14] outsmart it's the our criminal records
[1:03:17] when Captain Al Ferrar
[1:03:19] the head of the FBI the juvenile was
[1:03:21] converted in my meeting he said brother
[1:03:23] Graham your statement of that is true
[1:03:24] I'll take you right here to every
[1:03:25] juvenile cases happened in the past 10
[1:03:27] years in the United States it's amongst
[1:03:29] the educated people
[1:03:31] right 90 of it is they're so smart they
[1:03:35] figure they can just outfigure the law
[1:03:37] and things like that that's why they're
[1:03:38] getting trouble and they think well
[1:03:40] we've got a great church we're a great
[1:03:42] name that isn't it you've got to be born
[1:03:45] again
[1:03:47] that is your loss completely no matter
[1:03:50] how good your team was as good as able
[1:03:52] worship the same as able build a church
[1:03:55] the same as able May the sacrifice the
[1:03:57] same disabling God rejected him because
[1:04:00] he didn't have the spiritual Revelation
[1:04:02] what was wrong
[1:04:04] Jesus set upon that same spiritual
[1:04:06] Revelation he had built his church in
[1:04:09] the Gates of Hell couldn't Prevail
[1:04:10] against it
[1:04:11] a spiritual reveal by the Holy Spirit
[1:04:15] now what's Jesus doing he's going to the
[1:04:20] Jews making himself known now as soon as
[1:04:23] it's taken place there was one named
[1:04:25] Philip he thought that was drilling so
[1:04:27] around the mountain he went for 15 miles
[1:04:30] and he found a friend of his by the name
[1:04:32] of Nathanael
[1:04:34] and Nathaniel when he found him was
[1:04:36] under a tree plane
[1:04:38] and he waited till Nathaniel finished
[1:04:40] praying and if perhaps when he got up he
[1:04:43] said hello get up glad to see he said
[1:04:46] come see who we found
[1:04:49] that's it not even time today how do you
[1:04:51] do glad to meet you is your wife all
[1:04:53] right he had a message
[1:04:55] and if the church ever gets that
[1:04:57] thrilled about Christ
[1:04:58] something will take place
[1:05:01] but we got all kind of Social and
[1:05:03] everything to go on no wonder we're
[1:05:05] dying
[1:05:07] certainly
[1:05:09] I am we're worried about Russia go to
[1:05:11] come over here and get don't worry about
[1:05:13] that it isn't a Rob and it pecks the
[1:05:15] Apple it hurts it it's the worm at the
[1:05:17] core that kills them
[1:05:19] it's our own rockness Among Us
[1:05:22] let's watch Gillian
[1:05:24] we were a real Christian backbone of men
[1:05:27] and women who stood forgotten instead of
[1:05:30] going to church on Wednesday night we
[1:05:32] stay home to watch rock and roll
[1:05:33] television and Arthur Godfrey and all
[1:05:36] these other
[1:05:37] people on the radio we love Susie it
[1:05:40] shows you love the world more than you
[1:05:42] love God
[1:05:44] if your heart's forgot God comes first
[1:05:49] is all of your heart Nathaniel said come
[1:05:52] see you we found Jesus of Nazareth the
[1:05:54] son of Joseph
[1:05:56] and now he's I can just imagine here and
[1:05:58] say now wait a minute Philip you surely
[1:06:00] have gone off on the bad end of it you
[1:06:03] went off on the deep end I've known you
[1:06:05] to be a man of honest man and here you
[1:06:08] mean to tell me that you've gone off
[1:06:10] with something like that
[1:06:12] while you must have got into some
[1:06:14] fanaticism do you know Philip if that
[1:06:17] guy wasn't Messiah you know where he'd
[1:06:18] come to you he'd go to Jerusalem
[1:06:21] you go to the priests the high priest
[1:06:24] did say great campuses the high Priests
[1:06:26] of God we know you're the smartest man
[1:06:29] in the country the greatest religious
[1:06:30] man in the country and all you holy
[1:06:32] priests you know all the words he'd come
[1:06:34] there and he'd make himself known
[1:06:38] you Catholics think you'd go to the
[1:06:40] Vatican you prayers that you're in thank
[1:06:42] you go to the bishop your Pentecost
[1:06:44] thinks he goes to the state transmitter
[1:06:46] but he goes to who he
[1:06:48] to go to it's his business
[1:06:51] and he said could anything good come out
[1:06:54] of Nazareth don't give him the best
[1:06:56] answer that any man could give him he
[1:06:58] said come and see for yourself there's
[1:07:01] the way don't stay home and criticize go
[1:07:04] find out search it in the scriptures
[1:07:07] come find out for yourself
[1:07:09] on the road around the mountain I hear
[1:07:11] Nathaniel tension you know that old
[1:07:13] fisherman and she bought the fish from
[1:07:15] that time and couldn't sign the receipt
[1:07:17] yeah he come up before him the other day
[1:07:19] his name is Simon you know and he told
[1:07:21] him what his name was
[1:07:23] and told him what his father's name was
[1:07:25] or which surprised me if he didn't know
[1:07:27] who you were ah Phillip now Philip ah
[1:07:32] you can't tell me that stuff I'll make
[1:07:34] up my mind when I get there so when he
[1:07:37] walked up into the presence of Jesus for
[1:07:39] the first time Jesus looked around said
[1:07:41] behold in Israelite
[1:07:43] in whom there is no guile
[1:07:46] now he could have been an Arab he could
[1:07:48] have integrate they all dressed alike
[1:07:51] and looked like dark rates of people
[1:07:52] wearing beard turbans
[1:07:54] loose garment throat
[1:07:57] and besides that he could have been an
[1:07:58] Infidel he could have been a critic but
[1:08:00] he said you are a just man in whom
[1:08:03] there's no God
[1:08:05] and he looked at him he said Rabbi when
[1:08:08] did you know me
[1:08:09] this is the first time I've ever seen
[1:08:11] you you see me when did you ever know me
[1:08:14] you said before Philip called you when
[1:08:16] you were under the tree I saw you
[1:08:20] what did that Jew say here's the here's
[1:08:24] the attitude of a real believer you
[1:08:25] looked at him he said you are the Son of
[1:08:28] God you are the king of Israel
[1:08:32] but there was those stood by the smart
[1:08:34] priests
[1:08:35] they said this man the eligible he's a
[1:08:38] fortune teller
[1:08:40] Jesus turned around and said this
[1:08:44] you speak that against me the son of man
[1:08:46] I'll forgive you
[1:08:48] but in other words there's coming a day
[1:08:50] when the Holy Ghost will come and when
[1:08:53] he does the same thing one word against
[1:08:55] it will never be forgiven in this world
[1:08:58] neither in the world to come how many
[1:09:00] knows the scripture says that right the
[1:09:03] unpardonable scene is the call the Holy
[1:09:06] Spirit the working of the Holy Spirit an
[1:09:08] unclean thing that you never can be
[1:09:10] forgiven for CE that Jesus
[1:09:13] now did you notice Jesus never done that
[1:09:17] to a gentile
[1:09:19] nor in presence of a gentle house
[1:09:21] because he he forget his disciples to go
[1:09:24] to the Gentiles and when the therapy
[1:09:27] open woman said to him come have mercy
[1:09:28] on my daughter he sees that he said I'm
[1:09:31] only not least for me to take the
[1:09:33] children's bread and cast it to the dog
[1:09:36] and she said yes Lord that's true I know
[1:09:39] that but the dog gets a crime
[1:09:42] he said there's great faith if you
[1:09:44] believed it that way go find it the same
[1:09:45] way
[1:09:46] it's all he said to her no vision for
[1:09:49] her that her own faith do it see
[1:09:51] now
[1:09:53] he did that and he forbid his disciples
[1:09:55] to do it now we know there's only three
[1:09:59] uh nationalities of people are racist
[1:10:03] people
[1:10:06] that's the Jew Gentile and the Samaritan
[1:10:09] which the Samaritan is a half Jew and
[1:10:11] Gentile
[1:10:13] you notice Peter with the keys to the
[1:10:14] kingdom he opened it to the Jews at
[1:10:17] Pentecost went down to Samaria up to the
[1:10:20] house of Cornelius never again was it
[1:10:22] used there's the three races of the
[1:10:24] world
[1:10:25] now he in his day he came to his own and
[1:10:30] his own received him not
[1:10:33] now those who made fun of him and said
[1:10:36] he was the algebra a devil
[1:10:38] or telepathy or a fortune teller or some
[1:10:41] evil spirit he said I'm going to forgive
[1:10:44] you for that then the Holy Ghost will
[1:10:45] never yet been poured out upon the
[1:10:47] nation
[1:10:47] that I'll forgive you but when the Holy
[1:10:50] Ghost has come not one word against it
[1:10:52] or it'll never be forgiven
[1:10:54] I now notice one day he went by the way
[1:10:57] of Samaria
[1:10:59] and what he did he had need go that way
[1:11:01] and he sent his disciples into the city
[1:11:04] to buy some food and there's a little
[1:11:07] place that our whale outside the city a
[1:11:09] little tamaranic and where the the
[1:11:12] public confidence where they go get
[1:11:13] their water and there's a window that
[1:11:15] runs over the pumpkin the ladies come
[1:11:17] out there with pictures it's got hooks
[1:11:20] to go around just let them down in the
[1:11:21] well and get the water and bring it up
[1:11:23] and set it on their head and one on each
[1:11:26] hips and walk right along talk and go on
[1:11:29] Jesus is waiting there for his disciples
[1:11:31] to return
[1:11:33] and while he was waiting let's say she
[1:11:35] was a pretty woman real pretty woman
[1:11:38] come walking out there she is a
[1:11:39] Samaritan and she started to let her pop
[1:11:43] down into the well to get some water and
[1:11:45] she heard someone said woman
[1:11:47] bring me a drink
[1:11:49] and she looked around and it was a Jew
[1:11:52] sitting there
[1:11:53] she said well we don't have any dealings
[1:11:55] with each other you are a Jew and I am a
[1:11:58] Samaritan a woman of Samaria in other
[1:12:00] words they had segregation racial
[1:12:03] differences but he let her know he's no
[1:12:05] different he said if you knew who you
[1:12:08] were talking to you had asked me for a
[1:12:10] drink and I'd bring you water you don't
[1:12:11] come here to draw or give you water
[1:12:14] I listen that was Jesus yesterday
[1:12:18] I was at the Samaritan
[1:12:20] Jew and Samaritans which was the
[1:12:22] outcasts they all breed
[1:12:25] I now watch again
[1:12:28] and she said do you mean that you're
[1:12:30] greater than our father Jacob he does
[1:12:32] the well
[1:12:33] see they claim God too he dug so well
[1:12:36] his children drink from it is cattle and
[1:12:38] here you say you got water don't you say
[1:12:40] you're greater than he is and their
[1:12:42] conversation kept going what was he
[1:12:44] doing contacting her spirit
[1:12:46] and when he found water trouble was
[1:12:50] he found her trouble
[1:12:52] and he said woman
[1:12:53] go get your husband and come here
[1:12:56] she said I don't have any husbands he
[1:12:58] said that's right you've had five and
[1:13:01] the one you're living with now is not
[1:13:03] your husband you told the truth
[1:13:05] now what did she say say are you a
[1:13:08] fortune teller is that a mental
[1:13:10] telepathy you're blzibub no sir she know
[1:13:13] more about God than half the preachers
[1:13:15] in the United States
[1:13:17] her being a prostitute
[1:13:20] she said sir I foresee that you are a
[1:13:24] prophet
[1:13:27] now if you run that reference it goes
[1:13:29] back to that prophet
[1:13:31] the one that Moses spoke of
[1:13:33] I perceive that you are a prophet
[1:13:38] we know we Samaritans Now watch how they
[1:13:40] were taught see
[1:13:42] we know when the Messiah cometh you'll
[1:13:45] tell us these things
[1:13:47] but who are you
[1:13:49] what was that to be the sign of the
[1:13:51] Messiah
[1:13:52] it was to the Jews and it was to the
[1:13:54] Samaritans the Gentiles were heathens
[1:13:57] they know nothing about any Messiah they
[1:13:58] worship an Idols Sun gods and everything
[1:14:00] that's our our class
[1:14:04] and said
[1:14:06] we know when the Messiah cometh that
[1:14:08] trees he had to declare it they'd heard
[1:14:10] of him we know when he comes he'll tell
[1:14:13] us these things but who are you he says
[1:14:14] I'm he that speaks to you
[1:14:17] and she ran into the City and said come
[1:14:21] be a man who told me the things that
[1:14:24] I've done isn't this the very Messiah
[1:14:29] if that's the way he made himself known
[1:14:31] to Israel who was looking for him also
[1:14:34] to the Samaritan who was looking for him
[1:14:37] to come what about the Gentiles today
[1:14:39] who's looking for him to come
[1:14:42] if he acted that way and he can't change
[1:14:45] in being God if that was a sign he
[1:14:48] showed him as to make himself the
[1:14:50] Messiah the true Jew believed it all the
[1:14:54] great Starkey he didn't believe it
[1:14:56] didn't even start with although he was
[1:14:58] holding a precise man he was a great man
[1:15:01] but theologians we haven't got him today
[1:15:05] like that they had to even come through
[1:15:07] a certain generation Levi or he could be
[1:15:09] a priest yes fathers fathers fathers
[1:15:12] fathers father father was free and he
[1:15:14] had to come down that lane holy without
[1:15:17] blemish that don't have one thing to do
[1:15:19] with it
[1:15:20] you might never tell a lie and if this
[1:15:22] is true go to church every night and be
[1:15:25] just as Reverend and pay your tithes and
[1:15:27] do everything and kneel the Alder and
[1:15:28] worship and go to hell like a Martin to
[1:15:30] its bounce
[1:15:31] that's what the scripture says that's
[1:15:33] what Cain done
[1:15:36] so where's our self-style religion
[1:15:38] getting us anyhow
[1:15:40] it's sending us away from God
[1:15:43] certainly is now notice
[1:15:46] did you the real truth you believed it
[1:15:49] as soon as they've seen that sign
[1:15:51] performed he said that's the Messiah you
[1:15:55] are the Son of God you're the king of
[1:15:57] Israel Jesus said because you believe
[1:15:59] when I told you you were under the tree
[1:16:01] before you come you believe you'll see
[1:16:03] greater things than this
[1:16:06] and the woman at the well said we know
[1:16:08] the Messiah will do those things because
[1:16:10] we're looking for that to happen but who
[1:16:12] are you are you a prophet he said I'm
[1:16:14] the Messiah she comes said to the man
[1:16:16] now you've taught me that the Messiah
[1:16:18] would do these things
[1:16:21] now
[1:16:22] there's the man out there that told me
[1:16:24] the things that I've done isn't this the
[1:16:26] Messiah
[1:16:29] now if he has to act the same now
[1:16:32] remember it never was done before a
[1:16:34] gentile we've had 2 000 years of half
[1:16:38] Dart and half-life
[1:16:40] joining church but he would be unjust
[1:16:45] amateur partiality if he didn't declare
[1:16:48] himself the Risen Christ after 2000
[1:16:52] years is not because we got big churches
[1:16:54] that ain't the sign because we went
[1:16:57] across the nation Billy Graham Oral
[1:16:59] Roberts and all of us had great
[1:17:00] memberships coming into church that's
[1:17:02] not the sign
[1:17:04] that's no sign at all
[1:17:07] that's not what he did say watch your
[1:17:09] alcohol bigger crowd than John did that
[1:17:11] wasn't a sign
[1:17:12] but the sign of the Messiah was what I'm
[1:17:15] speaking of here that he did
[1:17:18] if he did that before that generation of
[1:17:21] Jews was cut off of them had breeds that
[1:17:24] was looking for him he's got to do the
[1:17:26] same thing before this Gentile
[1:17:28] generation or he did wrong when he acted
[1:17:30] back there in that way
[1:17:32] if he lets us go in with all our
[1:17:34] Theology and things like that and
[1:17:36] doesn't declare himself like he did to
[1:17:38] them before their destruction and this
[1:17:40] is the great sign to prove that the time
[1:17:43] is at hand
[1:17:45] that was at hand for the Jews and every
[1:17:48] Bible teacher knows that the the
[1:17:50] Gentiles dispensation is the end that
[1:17:53] he's the turn again to the Jews
[1:17:56] and God's heart and the Heart of Hitler
[1:17:58] mussolinia all those dictators in Russia
[1:18:01] and run those Jews right back in the
[1:18:03] Palestine where they're supposed to be
[1:18:04] standing there I got a picture three
[1:18:06] minutes before midnight according to
[1:18:08] science and those Jews coming in was
[1:18:11] packing their loved ones old crippled on
[1:18:13] their back you see in the look magazine
[1:18:15] live coming down from Iran in those
[1:18:18] places hacking those old Jews in the
[1:18:20] friend of mine went to him got it all in
[1:18:22] total chrome color said are you coming
[1:18:24] back to the Homeland
[1:18:27] to die to know
[1:18:30] we're coming back to see the Messiah
[1:18:35] we're not coming back today we're coming
[1:18:38] back to see the Messiah Jesus said when
[1:18:40] the Fig Tree goes to putting for this
[1:18:42] bud
[1:18:43] this generation 40 years
[1:18:45] shall not cease until all these Saints
[1:18:49] be fulfilled
[1:18:52] do you get it
[1:18:54] what's happening the last call for the
[1:18:57] Gentiles the nations are ready to be
[1:18:59] pulverized at any time
[1:19:01] and to think of it before that can
[1:19:05] happen the church goes on first
[1:19:08] and if we could be pulverized before
[1:19:11] Marty and the judgments
[1:19:13] how about the going home of the church
[1:19:15] he could come at any minute
[1:19:18] it's hurry oh wake up people shake your
[1:19:22] spiritual Soul Within You by reading the
[1:19:25] word
[1:19:26] we're at the end
[1:19:29] the time is at hand
[1:19:33] we've had theology we've had Church age
[1:19:35] but this is the time and now the life
[1:19:38] sign to the Jews
[1:19:40] was what the appearing of the Lord Jesus
[1:19:42] the life signed to the Gentile is him
[1:19:46] coming in the spirit of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:48] back into his church doing the same
[1:19:50] things that he did then you declare
[1:19:51] himself the same yesterday today and
[1:19:53] forever
[1:19:55] you look out you read the newspaper and
[1:19:57] see the writing in the sky
[1:19:59] you see we're bound to be doomed there's
[1:20:02] no other way out for him if God lets
[1:20:05] this nation get by with the sins of the
[1:20:07] doing he'll be obligated as a just God
[1:20:10] to raise up Simon and Gomorrah and
[1:20:12] apologize for burning him up
[1:20:14] they're doing the same things that we're
[1:20:16] doing God loves The Sinner but he hates
[1:20:19] sin and he's just and it's got to be
[1:20:22] judged
[1:20:24] and what he's doing his son is moving
[1:20:26] through the land today in the form of
[1:20:28] the Holy Ghost and the churches burn it
[1:20:30] getting away from it making fun of it so
[1:20:32] that he can be just to send a judgment
[1:20:34] what he promised he would do
[1:20:36] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:20:40] and forever that same Lord Jesus that
[1:20:43] declared himself there promised
[1:20:45] prophesied said all these things that
[1:20:47] take place and here they are what are we
[1:20:49] going to do about it that's accepted
[1:20:52] friend
[1:20:52] let's believe it here's a little picture
[1:20:55] laying here
[1:20:58] someone asked me about that
[1:21:03] that light now forget about me I'm just
[1:21:06] a man see we're talking about the life
[1:21:10] it's a pillar of Fire
[1:21:12] George J lace to the head of the FBI
[1:21:15] fingerprinting document examiners
[1:21:16] hanging under Washington DC in the
[1:21:18] religious Hall of art the only
[1:21:19] supernatural being was ever photographed
[1:21:21] it's in Switzerland it's in Germany
[1:21:23] where they've taken it what else is
[1:21:25] scattered out why isn't this to be known
[1:21:27] it can't be no one
[1:21:30] they never know these things until it's
[1:21:31] done passed by he said I have hide it
[1:21:34] from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[1:21:36] and they revealed to they such as would
[1:21:38] learn how many knows Jesus said that
[1:21:40] thank God for it
[1:21:43] you Catholic people you never know who
[1:21:45] St Patrick was he wasn't a Catholic to
[1:21:48] begin with you know that
[1:21:49] but after he was dead a long time you
[1:21:51] recognized he was the same how about
[1:21:53] Saint Francis of assisia a walking
[1:21:55] preacher with a Bible under his arm
[1:21:57] you didn't recognize him then how about
[1:21:59] Joan of Arc the Catholic Church burner
[1:22:02] to his stake and her screening for Mercy
[1:22:04] you burn her as a witch
[1:22:06] of the algebug
[1:22:10] Spirit-filled woman saw visions and done
[1:22:13] signs and wonders and you better as a
[1:22:16] witch
[1:22:17] as it Beelzebub
[1:22:19] but about a hundred years later you
[1:22:21] realize she was a saint
[1:22:23] of course you've done repentance you dug
[1:22:24] up that priest's body and throwed it in
[1:22:26] the river now she's tannenized the
[1:22:28] Saints
[1:22:29] God always sends his Mercy his sign he
[1:22:32] goes over the top of the eyes otherwise
[1:22:34] it prudent reveals the baby calls the
[1:22:36] church and steals it there he goes he's
[1:22:38] just he said it
[1:22:41] obligated to his words look at many of
[1:22:44] those Jews down there in that day
[1:22:45] Matthew 12. he said many of them saw the
[1:22:48] things he done yet they could not
[1:22:49] believe only because the prophet said uh
[1:22:51] that they got eyes and can't see in ears
[1:22:53] and came here
[1:22:55] blinded
[1:22:57] the Gentiles are blinded by trees and
[1:23:00] and denominations
[1:23:03] hailed to see the mysterious resurrected
[1:23:06] Jesus moving in his Spirit among his
[1:23:08] church and doing the things that he's
[1:23:10] doing right here at the end time
[1:23:12] oh God open our eyes
[1:23:15] open our eyes with my prayer
[1:23:18] one more thing he did before we closed
[1:23:21] one day he was passing through he didn't
[1:23:23] see no vision
[1:23:25] he was passing through a little crowd of
[1:23:27] people and they were all packing him and
[1:23:29] shaking his hands and uh and so forth
[1:23:31] and a little woman stood within her
[1:23:33] heart I believe him to be a holy man I
[1:23:36] believe he's the son of God
[1:23:38] and I I'm just a little woman and she
[1:23:40] had a blood issue during the time of
[1:23:42] menopause is for many years she'd had it
[1:23:44] and they couldn't stop it
[1:23:46] the doctors could do nothing about it
[1:23:48] and she said if I can just touch His
[1:23:50] Garment I believe I'll be made whole
[1:23:53] and she touched His Garment now the
[1:23:55] Palestinian garment hangs loose you
[1:23:58] couldn't touch it the Border that's the
[1:23:59] bottom of it hanging way loose and she
[1:24:02] touched the border that garment she's
[1:24:04] setting probably below him and she
[1:24:06] touched the Border he walked a little
[1:24:08] bit
[1:24:09] he turned he said who's touched me
[1:24:12] that was Jesus yesterday
[1:24:15] the Bible said he's a high priest
[1:24:17] tonight that can be touched by the
[1:24:19] feeling of our infirmities is that right
[1:24:21] the same yesterday today and forever the
[1:24:24] woman touched him he said who touched me
[1:24:26] and Peter being always felt big because
[1:24:29] he was kind of want to hear the apostles
[1:24:31] he said now rebuke the Lord Jesus and
[1:24:34] said why do you say such a thing as that
[1:24:37] who could tell who touched it
[1:24:39] everybody's touching you Jesus said but
[1:24:41] I got weed
[1:24:43] virtue's gone out of me
[1:24:45] that's the church I hope that you
[1:24:49] New Haven people touch
[1:24:51] I perceive that have gotten weak virtues
[1:24:54] gone from me everybody kept still you
[1:24:57] looked all around over a little group of
[1:24:58] people standing there around them
[1:25:00] fishermen around the river you looked
[1:25:02] out there and he saw the little woman he
[1:25:04] was in dude with power that could tell
[1:25:06] what was real Faith he said to the woman
[1:25:09] told her her conditions that thy faith
[1:25:12] has Daisy
[1:25:15] that was Jesus yesterday
[1:25:17] the Bible said he's the same yesterday
[1:25:19] and forever and a high priest Hebrews
[1:25:22] the New Testament that can be touched by
[1:25:25] the feeling of our infirmities then if
[1:25:28] he is the high priest yes if you touched
[1:25:31] him if you said the audience where you
[1:25:32] are and say oh God let me touch you
[1:25:35] Jesus I believe you're not excited over
[1:25:37] just touching
[1:25:40] how would he act
[1:25:41] you'd have to act the same way he did
[1:25:43] then or he wouldn't be the same Jesus
[1:25:47] see he'd have to speak back use the lips
[1:25:51] of his church and say the same thing
[1:25:53] because we are Divine of the branches
[1:25:55] he's the vine you'd have to speak right
[1:25:57] back and say the same thing you did then
[1:25:59] or he isn't the same Jesus he isn't the
[1:26:02] same high priest he's another
[1:26:04] but he's alive tonight
[1:26:06] oh I'm so glad of that friend he's alive
[1:26:10] and in this day when we not don't have
[1:26:13] one then we can rest upon
[1:26:16] you you're we're just we're finished
[1:26:18] there's only one thing that can stand at
[1:26:22] the kingdom of God
[1:26:25] our nation gone
[1:26:28] she's eat to the core with termites
[1:26:31] I stood on the half on the places where
[1:26:34] pharaohs in Egypt had to dig 20 feet to
[1:26:37] find their palaces
[1:26:38] and enroll with the Caesar
[1:26:41] and all kingdoms give away because
[1:26:44] there's coming a kingdom
[1:26:46] that can never give away
[1:26:49] at the kingdom of God
[1:26:51] these others all Mortal gives away to
[1:26:53] immortality
[1:26:55] but the great nation that we have and
[1:26:56] yet the Bible says that every Nation
[1:26:58] Under the Sun is controlled by the devil
[1:27:00] Jesus said so all nations are controlled
[1:27:03] for the devil that's why we fight and
[1:27:05] carry on the way we do Satan said
[1:27:07] they're all mine he showed them I'll
[1:27:08] give them all to you if you worship me
[1:27:10] Jesus though he'd fall heir to him he
[1:27:12] said just be behind me Satan
[1:27:16] he knew he was there to them and as long
[1:27:18] as we are we got a marvelous president
[1:27:21] I'm not a politician but I like Mr
[1:27:24] Eisenhower and I think he's a wonderful
[1:27:26] man but if we put a Dwight Eisenhower in
[1:27:29] every County in this United States can
[1:27:32] still go up right on and sins
[1:27:34] the Bible said she was
[1:27:37] there you are the times here
[1:27:39] friend
[1:27:41] not long ago I took a trip up in Finland
[1:27:44] right after the first the second world
[1:27:46] war I've seen those Finnish women at
[1:27:49] night time all hooked up in the Hornets
[1:27:51] dragging a Hera behind them man little
[1:27:54] children packing linear and then it'll
[1:27:56] stop for night just keep on going the
[1:27:58] war was ended they had to paint the weed
[1:28:01] if they didn't get the wheat into be no
[1:28:03] crop next year that all starve to death
[1:28:05] little fellas running off the laners
[1:28:07] they'd be so tired and mother pulling
[1:28:09] and sweating shoulders rubbed and
[1:28:11] everything young girls and all dad
[1:28:13] coming behind throwing the wheat like
[1:28:15] that scratch it anyways just scratch the
[1:28:17] surface get the weed in the Snows is
[1:28:19] coming
[1:28:20] lays on all women no wheat No Lie
[1:28:24] brother that's the way it is today in
[1:28:26] the kingdom of God it's later than you
[1:28:28] think we can't have time to stop for Big
[1:28:31] Revival got to scratch the surface
[1:28:34] get the seat in
[1:28:40] brother Branham
[1:28:43] his message gets so much criticism
[1:28:46] today
[1:28:48] but did you hear anything in that sermon
[1:28:53] that wasn't about the Lord Jesus
[1:28:57] brother Branham had the same message
[1:28:58] that Paul had he said had the same
[1:29:00] message that Peter had it was lifting up
[1:29:03] a living Jesus Christ before us the
[1:29:06] musicians could come
[1:29:11] and
[1:29:13] when brother Branham was was preaching
[1:29:15] this and I I'm sure that they don't have
[1:29:18] the end of the tape but what happened
[1:29:20] every single time
[1:29:22] when he would preach a sermon like this
[1:29:24] is people he would start calling people
[1:29:28] out of the audience
[1:29:30] he was or if there was a prayer line
[1:29:32] they would come up and he would tell the
[1:29:36] people what was wrong with them
[1:29:38] one of those people was my grandfather
[1:29:43] his name is Carl wheeler
[1:29:45] he had a chronic stomach problem
[1:29:50] and he had heard that this man William
[1:29:53] Branham was going to be down
[1:29:56] in a place called Acton Kentucky
[1:29:58] he drove down there
[1:30:01] he got into the prayer line I believe he
[1:30:03] had a prayer card or anything like that
[1:30:04] they were coming around just like we
[1:30:06] were this morning they were coming
[1:30:08] around and he comes before brother
[1:30:10] Branham
[1:30:12] brother Branham
[1:30:14] tells him his name
[1:30:16] it's on tape brother Bram tells him his
[1:30:19] name
[1:30:21] he said you have a stomach problem
[1:30:22] called colitis
[1:30:25] he said brother your faith I believe he
[1:30:27] said something on the order of your
[1:30:28] faith has made you well go and be healed
[1:30:30] in the name of Jesus Christ my
[1:30:32] grandfather never from that day never
[1:30:34] suffered from stomach problems again
[1:30:38] fact
[1:30:39] he started following this man he saw
[1:30:41] something real in this man named William
[1:30:43] random that same night
[1:30:46] there was another lady that came through
[1:30:48] that same prayer line
[1:30:50] that lady came forth and he said you're
[1:30:52] here for someone else
[1:30:55] he said there is a lady an old lady that
[1:30:59] is sick and she's dying with cancer he
[1:31:01] said take that that handkerchief that
[1:31:04] you have in your hand and bring it up
[1:31:06] and lay it on that lady
[1:31:08] [Music]
[1:31:11] you know what happened
[1:31:13] this is a fairly famous story in the
[1:31:15] message
[1:31:17] so that lady went and she did it she was
[1:31:19] told she went up now this is down in the
[1:31:21] hills of Kentucky way back in the 1940s
[1:31:24] or 50s
[1:31:26] she goes and this lady was up on the
[1:31:29] hill and and she was she took that
[1:31:32] handkerchief
[1:31:34] and she laid it on this old lady who was
[1:31:36] dying with cancer
[1:31:39] and that little old lady was healed in
[1:31:41] the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:31:44] and there was another brother there and
[1:31:45] they had a group that went up with this
[1:31:47] old lady that this lady that took that
[1:31:50] handkerchief up there and when that
[1:31:52] woman that was dying of cancer was
[1:31:55] healed they started shouting and
[1:31:57] praising the Lord and it was heard down
[1:32:00] at the neighbor's house
[1:32:03] and there was another old man
[1:32:05] that was living down there and he heard
[1:32:08] all this this screaming and shouting and
[1:32:10] he said oh the old sister the old lady
[1:32:13] must have passed away
[1:32:14] he said I'll get my wagon in the morning
[1:32:18] and I'll go up there and I'll throw in
[1:32:20] this wagon we'll take her to the
[1:32:21] graveyard
[1:32:23] so that next morning that old man he
[1:32:25] gets he gets his wagon hooked up and he
[1:32:27] drives up to the top of the hill
[1:32:30] and he looks and there is that woman
[1:32:33] that was dying of cancer the day before
[1:32:36] she's there drinking a cup of coffee and
[1:32:39] eating breakfast
[1:32:41] oh
[1:32:42] so
[1:32:45] a while later
[1:32:47] the same man that we heard tonight
[1:32:51] he's down there squirrel hunting hunting
[1:32:53] with his buddy Banks wood
[1:32:57] and they go over and they
[1:32:59] they go to this they see this old man
[1:33:01] under this apple tree
[1:33:04] and
[1:33:06] they asked brother Banks goes up there
[1:33:09] and he asks the man can we hunt on your
[1:33:10] land the man the man said yeah he knew

[1:33:32] low
[1:33:33] that you carry a preacher with you
[1:33:35] everywhere you go
[1:33:37] brother Branham walked over there he
[1:33:39] said well it's about my time I guess to
[1:33:41] go over there he goes over there and he
[1:33:43] talks to this old man
[1:33:45] and this old man says well he tells him
[1:33:48] he says I'm an infidel and brother Bram
[1:33:52] says well that's not something I'd be
[1:33:53] proud of
[1:33:55] and he says well he says I think your
[1:33:56] preachers are blocking up the wrong tree
[1:34:00] they talk for a little while and
[1:34:03] brother Brandon presents the word to him
[1:34:06] and he says you know
[1:34:08] he says the only thing
[1:34:11] he says that I would I would have a
[1:34:13] question about
[1:34:15] he said is um there was a man that came

[1:38:42] time otherwise I got no time
[1:38:45] [Music]
[1:38:47] friends
[1:38:48] I believe that
[1:38:50] the Lord
[1:38:51] wants us to spend more time in prayer
[1:38:55] I really have been thinking about that
[1:38:57] all day
[1:38:59] and um
[1:39:01] thinking about it
[1:39:03] a few days before I knew that we were
[1:39:06] going to pray for sister Connie
[1:39:08] and I did my best
[1:39:11] to prepare
[1:39:14] praying for her
[1:39:17] and I prayed more than I usually praise
[1:39:22] I fasted
[1:39:24] prayed
[1:39:26] and I'll tell you what I'm a better man
[1:39:28] today just spending a couple more in a
[1:39:31] just a couple days spending that more
[1:39:35] time in prayer I believe that the Lord
[1:39:37] has made me a better person and I would
[1:39:39] encourage you to
[1:39:41] God bless you brother Jonathan if you
[1:39:43] can lead us on the wings all the small

[1:40:27] one more friends I'm sorry I know you've
[1:40:30] heard the testimony but I just gotta
[1:40:32] tell it again this song
[1:40:35] 1961. I believe is when this song came
[1:40:38] out by a man named Ferlin Husky
[1:40:41] brand new song and this is where I might
[1:40:45] differ with some of the died in the wool
[1:40:47] message people that say that we can't
[1:40:50] sing any of these modern songs
[1:40:53] that was a modern song
[1:40:55] by a man that didn't maybe live such a
[1:40:58] good life
[1:40:59] but he was inspired to write that song
[1:41:01] that song was on the radio brother
[1:41:03] Branham asked my grandpa Evans and my
[1:41:06] dad
[1:41:07] both of them were there
[1:41:09] he said you know that song on the wings
[1:41:10] of a snow white dove by Ferlin Husky
[1:41:12] have you heard it they said yeah he said
[1:41:14] I got a message I want to preach
[1:41:17] and he says I'm going to call it on the
[1:41:19] wings of a snow white dove
[1:41:21] and he said when you hear me preach that
[1:41:24] message
[1:41:26] you know it is my time to go
[1:41:30] brother Brandon preached that message
[1:41:31] less than one month before he was before
[1:41:34] he died in a car accident
[1:41:37] profit speaking prophetically in my
[1:41:40] family is a witness
[1:41:42] one more verse my friend

[1:42:40] sweet love is a sign from
[1:42:47] all the wings of a dove brothers and
[1:42:51] sisters brother branham's message
[1:42:54] we've we've
[1:42:56] believed that we've messed it up over
[1:42:58] all these years
[1:43:00] brother branham's message and you heard
[1:43:02] him talk about it tonight it was to come
[1:43:06] out of those denominations
[1:43:09] because you think that you're saved
[1:43:11] because you're a Methodist you think
[1:43:13] that you're saved because you're a
[1:43:15] Baptist you think that you're saved
[1:43:17] because you go to this church or that
[1:43:19] church it has nothing to do it with it
[1:43:21] you have to know Jesus Christ you have
[1:43:24] to have that relationship with him only
[1:43:27] then will you be saved and he that man
[1:43:30] stood against the denominational the
[1:43:33] denominational system of that day and it
[1:43:37] is still here today let me read to you
[1:43:39] something that you just heard
[1:43:41] it says this
[1:43:45] it says
[1:43:47] now he Jesus said I am the vine and you
[1:43:49] are the branches
[1:43:51] now if the vine doesn't bear the the
[1:43:53] fruit of itself it only purges the
[1:43:56] branches and the branches bear the fruit
[1:44:00] so that vine that stump brings the water
[1:44:04] and nutrients up into the branches and
[1:44:07] then it goes out into the branches and
[1:44:10] bears fruit from those branches
[1:44:14] do you know that brother Brahm said well
[1:44:17] then if you went to a grapevine what
[1:44:20] would you expect to find grapes if you
[1:44:23] went to a watermelon vine
[1:44:25] you'd find watermelon if it's a fertile
[1:44:28] Vine
[1:44:29] and if you went to a peach street find
[1:44:31] peaches
[1:44:33] but then if Christ is the vine
[1:44:37] Hallelujah and his members of the church
[1:44:40] is the branches
[1:44:42] what ought you to find in the church
[1:44:46] The Works that I do Jesus speaking right
[1:44:49] here the works that I do shall you do
[1:44:51] also More Than This shall you do for I
[1:44:53] go unto my father
[1:44:57] what do you find
[1:45:00] in contrary to what he just said
[1:45:04] what do you find
[1:45:06] when you go to church
[1:45:09] we are Presbyterian
[1:45:12] We Are Baptist
[1:45:16] we are Pentecostals
[1:45:20] we got the message
[1:45:22] [Music]
[1:45:24] we got this that's not Christ
[1:45:28] is love
[1:45:30] because he was God
[1:45:32] so how can we say
[1:45:36] that we are we are something more
[1:45:39] special
[1:45:40] in this day when brother Branham right
[1:45:43] there put us right in with the with the
[1:45:45] Baptist and the Presbyterian
[1:45:48] right in with the denominations
[1:45:50] we are nothing
[1:45:53] without Jesus Christ we are nothing
[1:45:56] without him he is everything he is the
[1:46:00] one that heals the sick he is the one
[1:46:03] that cleanses the lepers as the Bible
[1:46:05] says he is the one that gave the prophet
[1:46:08] the discernment to know what was on
[1:46:10] these people's hearts he is the one that
[1:46:12] is here today that answers our prayers
[1:46:15] it is Jesus Christ and we are wrong in
[1:46:20] creating a denomination around it listen
[1:46:23] to what the prophet said
[1:46:25] you won't go wrong
[1:46:27] with what that man said that man William
[1:46:29] Branham God bless you all
[1:46:32] on their wings
[1:46:35] [Music]

[1:47:05] God sends his pure Sweet Love
[1:47:11] aside from above
[1:47:16] all the wings of us
[1:47:18] [Music]
[1:47:24] I'd like to read a testimony
[1:47:26] [Music]
[1:47:27] just Amelia writes this on Wednesday
[1:47:30] my daughter and I
[1:47:32] we're coming to church
[1:47:34] and a neighbor stopped us and asked
[1:47:36] asked if we had heard about the fire
[1:47:38] [Music]
[1:47:40] she said I said no
[1:47:43] and she said that there had been a fire
[1:47:46] on our floor in the stairwell and I
[1:47:49] slept through it
[1:47:51] thank you Lord for protecting us
[1:47:53] [Music]
[1:47:54] [Applause]
[1:47:58] there's a common denominator here and
[1:48:00] she writes sister Amelia writes another
[1:48:01] one
[1:48:03] coming home from church
[1:48:05] [Music]
[1:48:09] God bless you hard sister Amelia going
[1:48:12] to church and coming home from church
[1:48:15] a lot of the roads were blocked by
[1:48:18] police cars
[1:48:19] I was able to get into my building by
[1:48:21] the back and we learned that there was
[1:48:23] an active shooter in the apartment
[1:48:24] across the street from us thank you Lord
[1:48:26] once again
[1:48:28] Mr Amelia
[1:48:29] [Applause]
[1:48:36] let me just bow our heads
[1:48:38] or Jesus
[1:48:41] cause us Lord to check our hearts to
[1:48:43] listen to what's been said
[1:48:45] oh Lord we know so many times we we have
[1:48:48] different ways of hearing things but
[1:48:50] let's hear it the way you want us to
[1:48:51] hear it
[1:48:52] let us hear the Revelation that you have
[1:48:54] for us personally Lord we know this is a
[1:48:57] message to each and everyone so father
[1:49:00] let's take this and oh Lord there's
[1:49:02] nothing been said here that's going to
[1:49:04] hurt us it's going to help us amen and
[1:49:06] oh God you know your word says praying
[1:49:08] always father you know I was thinking
[1:49:11] that sometimes they would say that how
[1:49:13] do you pray always how do you always be
[1:49:16] thinking about you Lord
[1:49:17] but we know that Satan constantly is
[1:49:20] pressuring our people he never lets up
[1:49:23] he never sleeps so Lord Jesus let us
[1:49:26] counter that with calling upon you
[1:49:28] staying in your spirit we know brother
[1:49:30] Branham said is that we are pressure
[1:49:32] honest with the Holy Spirit no evil can
[1:49:35] get in so father pressurizes Lord will
[1:49:39] cause us oh God to take this has been
[1:49:41] said
[1:49:42] and Lord let us cause us to pray more
[1:49:45] whatever it takes father we know that's
[1:49:48] the answer for the personal relationship
[1:49:50] Lord
[1:49:52] the building block of your of our
[1:49:55] relationship is our prayer with you Lord
[1:49:57] and as we're in relationship with you
[1:49:59] and we come and meet with each other
[1:50:01] Lord we know that it's all good father
[1:50:04] you are good Lord these are your
[1:50:07] children so we pray Lord that each and
[1:50:10] one would take the words that we've
[1:50:11] heard today and take them to heart and
[1:50:14] Ponder them in our hearts oh Lord
[1:50:16] consider them and then Lord find time
[1:50:20] to go before you in prayer Lord and not
[1:50:23] just asking for something but Lord in my
[1:50:25] heart I believe sometimes father you
[1:50:27] just want Fellowship amen you just want
[1:50:30] us to just be appreciative of you and
[1:50:34] Lord you know our hearts we know that
[1:50:37] when you're in your presence oh God
[1:50:39] you'll take care of us and Lord let us
[1:50:43] let us learn to love to be in your
[1:50:45] presence Let It Be an addiction that we
[1:50:48] can't do without it forgive me Lord or
[1:50:51] for I am slack I'll confess this before
[1:50:53] my brothers and sisters help me
[1:50:56] to pray more forgive me oh God for not
[1:50:59] being more diligent but I thank you Lord
[1:51:02] for this time that we've had to remind
[1:51:04] us one more time oh God
[1:51:07] one more time we thank you for this
[1:51:10] warning we thank you for this blessing
[1:51:11] we ask now that you go with each and
[1:51:14] every one to their homes and Lord they
[1:51:16] would take this to heart and not forget
[1:51:18] what's been said but act upon it
