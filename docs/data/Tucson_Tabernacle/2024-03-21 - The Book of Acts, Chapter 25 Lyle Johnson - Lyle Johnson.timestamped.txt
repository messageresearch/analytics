[9:06] [Music]
[9:08] this afternoon or I guess it was late
[9:10] morning I've shared a few times of a
[9:13] co-worker or a one that he's a painter
[9:16] and a younger Indian and I've shared
[9:19] several times we've prayed together and
[9:21] all and I hadn't seen him for quite some
[9:23] time
[9:24] been working on the east side of town
[9:26] and today we ended up in the same house
[9:29] and I'd been thinking a lot about him
[9:31] his name is Nick
[9:33] and he saw me in his his face just kind
[9:36] of happy and he says I've been
[9:37] struggling something he said and he
[9:39] began to share he said some of my
[9:42] friends got into some trouble and it
[9:43] disappointed me so much that I stopped
[9:45] going to church
[9:47] and he began to share and I just began
[9:49] to share the scriptures that we know
[9:51] from going from Isaiah 53
[9:54] through through not only that but he was
[9:57] slain before the foundation of the world
[10:00] and just to share that with him and
[10:02] watch his heart just
[10:04] and he says I just had told the Lord
[10:06] I've got to get back to you
[10:09] he was crying he's just said thank you
[10:12] we couldn't miss each other by five
[10:14] minutes
[10:16] God allowed both of us today and I just
[10:18] said Lord you are so precious
[10:21] if he'll stand with me
[10:24] there were no written requests but I
[10:28] my wife was in some pain
[10:30] um
[10:31] he's been having problems with her left
[10:32] shoulder and the
[10:33] doctors think there's a tear there but
[10:35] yesterday she was watering thank you
[10:41] she slept on a muddy spot and then she
[10:44] didn't fall but in trying to hold
[10:45] herself shaved she felt like she hurt
[10:48] herself but this afternoon she was
[10:49] feeling a little better so
[10:51] she was uh she says it's no fun getting
[10:55] older but

[24:20] us
[24:22] he is so good
[24:24] brother Joe Miller
[24:26] texted me I'm not too long ago I sit on
[24:30] a note that we have this um
[24:33] this little thing where they tore up the
[24:35] the asphalt they're going to repave it
[24:38] and I was just warning the people to go
[24:40] slow when you when you come in the
[24:42] in the parking lot brother Joe sent me a
[24:46] note saying that
[24:49] he said it's just another sign
[24:52] It's Just Another Blessing
[24:54] and that they're going to pave our
[24:56] street out front and give us a nice nice
[24:59] asphalt to drive on no more bumps on the
[25:01] road and I just thought hey man you know
[25:05] brother Joe I was thinking the same
[25:06] thing and I'm just grateful it's a
[25:07] little bit of a hardship now
[25:09] but
[25:11] the the good times coming the good
[25:13] pavement's coming and we might be going
[25:15] through a little hard time right now we
[25:17] might be struggling a little bit right
[25:19] now but there's a good time coming
[25:21] there's a nice smooth road ahead of us
[25:25] and that's a promise for us
[25:28] and a welcome a couple special boys to
[25:31] me

[25:42] lot
[25:43] Benjamin's the guitar player that I also
[25:46] talk about a lot they're they're good

[25:56] it's good to have you guys here thanks

[26:09] we're gonna keep you here
[26:11] God bless you it's it's nice to have you
[26:15] um
[26:17] sister Jessica I think you inspired
[26:19] Daniel on that song
[26:21] sister Jessica sang that song at camp
[26:24] and wow it just it was amazing it was
[26:29] just we had an amazing camp
[26:31] if you I think most people were there
[26:34] um I'll share some testimonies in the
[26:38] coming services but I really believe the
[26:40] Lord was with us I believe he paved the
[26:43] way
[26:44] for a nice time and I think he was
[26:47] working on quite a few Souls at camp and
[26:50] I saw that in the last day that
[26:53] couple
[26:54] people I never thought
[26:56] whatever
[26:59] give the hearts to the Lord to be
[27:00] touched
[27:01] made a commitment in their life
[27:06] um it was a blessing
[27:09] um we were sitting around the fire we
[27:12] had some really nice conversations and
[27:14] worship around the campfire and had some
[27:17] of the young people around and I asked
[27:19] him I said what would encourage you so a
[27:24] lot of times we don't have
[27:27] a full house on Wednesday night and
[27:29] Sunday night I said what would encourage
[27:32] you to
[27:34] serve the Lord to to to be excited about
[27:37] the Lord and one of the numer girls said
[27:40] that you know we really appreciate
[27:43] testimonies
[27:44] we really appreciate hearing what the
[27:46] Lord's doing in other people's lives
[27:47] what you didn't know is that I had
[27:50] already scheduled a service
[27:52] um
[27:53] the uh next weekend that we're just
[27:56] going to have a testimony service and
[27:58] that's that's next Sunday I think I told
[28:00] you at the fire that it was this Sunday
[28:02] but I already had it on the schedule and
[28:04] it was already on my heart to do it so
[28:06] when you said that it was it was just
[28:07] confirmation that no this is right let's
[28:10] continue on this way and so next Sunday
[28:14] next Sunday evening be prepared for
[28:18] testimonies and I wanted to go orderly
[28:20] so if you have a testimony to give let's
[28:23] let's keep it short and if you could um
[28:26] contact one of the brothers and we'll
[28:29] put you on a list and I'll just go down
[28:31] the list with testimonies and that also
[28:33] includes song specials too I want to get
[28:37] in some song specials and some
[28:38] testimonies just a nice time of worship
[28:41] I think the Lord would be pleased with
[28:42] it I think he was leading me and you
[28:45] saying that it really it gave me
[28:48] confirmation this is this is the right
[28:50] thing to do
[28:52] I have a testimony I want to share
[28:54] Stephanie and I were we're working late
[28:57] out here wanted to get the the kids room
[29:01] done for the kids
[29:03] I forgot it was a Friday night or a
[29:05] Saturday night sister Debbie when you
[29:07] stopped by
[29:09] it was a Thursday night so Stephanie and
[29:11] I were there and we were working
[29:13] and uh we're here knock at the door and
[29:16] sister Debbie comes in
[29:19] with this little girl sweet little girl
[29:22] her name's Riza she's 11 years old
[29:25] it's her niece
[29:27] she brings her in and and we show around
[29:30] the new area that we had back there
[29:34] and she seemed to like it with all the
[29:37] games and the and everything in there
[29:39] and
[29:40] and I I told her I said you need to come
[29:42] to church you need to come so she came
[29:45] to church and she went um
[29:47] she went to Sunday school
[29:49] and she went to I think she was up in
[29:51] Stephanie's class and she came home she
[29:53] had her book bag and her Bible and all
[29:55] of that and she told
[29:58] sister Debbie she said you know I I
[30:00] didn't I always was afraid of church it
[30:03] was always scary to me she'd never been
[30:05] she thought church was like you see in
[30:08] the movies with these weird old Catholic
[30:10] priests and all these weird spirits and
[30:12] the horror movies she didn't know that
[30:14] church is actually a loving place
[30:17] and a good place
[30:19] so she came to church and she enjoyed it
[30:22] so she couldn't she wanted to come back
[30:24] and she she couldn't have come back for
[30:27] a couple weeks she was busy with her
[30:28] family
[30:30] and sister Debbie said that uh was it uh
[30:33] yesterday or did you say Saturday what
[30:35] day was it they were in the in the wreck
[30:37] it was on Sunday night
[30:40] they were caught they were driving on
[30:41] I-10
[30:43] and
[30:45] a semi was in front of them and the semi
[30:48] in front of them slammed on the brakes
[30:51] and the dad who is the driver he
[30:53] couldn't stop in time so he slams into
[30:55] the back of the semi somebody somebody
[30:58] behind them slams into them the car
[31:01] starts spinning around on the highway
[31:06] and comes to a stop and and of course
[31:08] the EMS come and the Wreckers are there
[31:11] and they give them a ride to the uh to a
[31:14] nearby service station
[31:16] and sister Debbie drove up to pick him
[31:19] up
[31:20] and of course everyone was telling them
[31:21] how
[31:22] dangerous of a situation that was and no
[31:25] one got hurt and the only real damage to
[31:27] the car was was the right front wheel
[31:30] got bent and they couldn't drive it
[31:34] so sister Debbie comes in
[31:36] and
[31:37] she tells
[31:39] Risa her niece who knew nothing about
[31:42] the Lord friends nothing she'd never
[31:45] been to church
[31:46] she she had never there was no
[31:49] background there at all
[31:51] and she tells Risa she says the Lord
[31:56] God protected you
[31:59] and Riza says I know
[32:01] she says when we got after the wreck
[32:05] when we got here she says I went into
[32:07] the bathroom and I prayed
[32:09] I thought oh Lord
[32:12] how sweet that's why we're here
[32:16] we're here not to get to somebody to
[32:18] believe like us or get somebody
[32:21] converted or fill up a church we're here
[32:24] to get people to Christ and sister
[32:27] Debbie it didn't you got the little girl
[32:30] to where she loves the Lord she's going
[32:32] to start coming to church she she
[32:33] enjoyed it she saw all the people that
[32:35] were so sweet and nice and they loved
[32:38] her and she just she wants to come back
[32:41] I thought praise God
[32:44] thank thank the Lord for kindness and
[32:47] love because that will win over every
[32:49] time
[32:50] that little girl
[32:53] she'll know the Lord Jesus and I believe
[32:57] with all my heart
[32:58] because
[33:00] of how the Lord is using you sister
[33:03] Debbie and using this church she's going
[33:05] to be with us at an eternal camp
[33:09] where we will be all together and
[33:11] everything will be good and we'll be
[33:13] praising the Lord and and sister Jessica
[33:15] will be singing and and Daniel will be
[33:18] playing and and we'll just we'll just
[33:20] have a great time forever
[33:24] and there'll be people there
[33:26] that you may not have ever known just
[33:28] like this
[33:30] Native American man that brother Aaron
[33:31] was talking about there'll be people
[33:33] like him there
[33:36] and they have come because of our
[33:39] witness and our testimony
[33:43] is what the word tells us
[33:45] so let's all stand
[33:47] wow brother Lyle makes ready
[33:50] think about this book of Acts and I
[33:52] think about this
[33:54] next chapter in Paul's again on trial
[33:58] and just getting beat down and and
[34:01] everything everything is just constantly
[34:03] against this man
[34:05] and as I was praying today I was
[34:07] thinking about Paul and I was thinking
[34:09] about how much he relied on God
[34:13] for everything
[34:15] he relied on the Lord and and as he went
[34:17] as he came before these
[34:20] rulers
[34:22] replace Pontius Pilate
[34:24] these people they had the power to
[34:27] crucify him they had the power to cut
[34:29] his head off and he would not he was
[34:31] obedient
[34:33] to that heavenly vision
[34:35] we're going to hear today about how Paul
[34:37] stood and he stood on trial again
[34:40] and he wouldn't back down
[34:43] he loved the Lord
[34:45] and he had had an experience
[34:49] sister Debbie I want a little risen to
[34:51] have that same experience I want us all
[34:54] to have that same experience to where it
[34:56] is just perfectly real and there is no
[35:00] way we could ever forsake it it is Jesus
[35:03] Christ we can testify Jesus Christ how
[35:06] do you know him because he lives right
[35:07] here
[35:08] and and he speaks through me and he uses
[35:11] me he provides for me
[35:14] and I am like that Apostle Paul I am
[35:18] like that Apostle Peter I'm like Mary
[35:20] Magdalene I'm like Mary of Bethany I am
[35:23] like these people because I know the
[35:25] same Jesus Christ that they knew amen
[35:28] and that's what happened to these people
[35:30] in the book of Acts brother and you have
[35:33] a song for we'll just continue
[35:35] whole thank you Lord
[35:40] for saving my soul

[36:28] tonight we're going to study
[36:31] chapter 25 in the book of Acts I I will
[36:36] keep you less than two hours tonight
[36:38] in fact I'll probably keep you less than
[36:40] 45 minutes but that's okay in it Paul
[36:42] prepares for a third trial this one this
[36:46] time is before a new governor once again
[36:48] the person judging seems focused on
[36:50] political expediency rather than
[36:52] application of Justice based on law
[36:56] but before we open our Bibles to read
[36:58] this account let's approach the author
[37:01] once more in prayer
[37:02] Lord Jesus it is such a privilege that
[37:06] we can gather together

[37:56] short we commit this service once again
[37:59] into your hands in Jesus precious name
[38:03] amen
[38:05] we recall from chapter 21 that Paul
[38:09] arrived in Jerusalem and agreed at the
[38:11] repressor of James and Elders heir to
[38:13] participate in an end of vow ceremony at
[38:16] the temple with four Jewish Christians
[38:18] before that could be completed he was
[38:21] recognized by some Pilgrims from Ephesus
[38:23] and Jerusalem for the Feast of Weeks
[38:25] what we call Pentecost and they stirred
[38:28] up the crowd and there was a riot that
[38:29] followed and Paul was arrested chapter
[38:31] 22 as he was being led into the Fortress
[38:34] he addressed the crowd they listened to
[38:36] him until he said that he was sent to
[38:39] the Gentiles and then they erupted this
[38:42] man should not live
[38:43] Paul was then bound and being prepared
[38:45] to be beaten beat the truth out of him
[38:47] tortured for a confession what they
[38:50] called being examined and he told his
[38:52] interrogators he was a Roman he was
[38:54] exempt from such practices he'd had
[38:57] quite enough physical abuse in chapter
[38:59] 23 the next morning he was brought to
[39:01] the Sanhedrin Council and broke him to a
[39:03] fist fight over differences that they
[39:05] had in interpretations of scripture a
[39:07] plan to Ambush Paul was foiled when the
[39:10] Roman Commander Claudius Licia snuck
[39:13] Paul out of Jerusalem that night with a
[39:15] little tiny guard of only
[39:17] 470 soldiers to take him to caesarea to
[39:21] stand trial chapter 24 Paul confronted
[39:24] his accusers in caesarea before the
[39:26] governor Felix only about 12 days it
[39:29] elapsed from when he'd arrived in
[39:30] Jerusalem until he was standing in front
[39:32] of Felix let's read this closing verses
[39:34] of chapter 24 to set the stage for
[39:37] chapter 25. this works better Lyle if
[39:40] you turn it on
[39:42] technology okay acts 24 verse 22 and
[39:47] when Felix he was the governor of the
[39:49] district and also the judge at Paul's
[39:51] trial heard these things Paul's defense
[39:53] against the charges brought by the
[39:56] Jerusalem Council Felix
[39:59] we're told having a more perfect
[40:00] knowledge of Christianity of that way he
[40:03] deferred them he adjourned the
[40:04] proceeding and said oh when Lycia is the
[40:07] chief Captain shall come down I'll know
[40:09] the utter most of your matter I'll
[40:12] decide your case later of course there's
[40:15] no record that lycius ever came
[40:17] and Felix commanded a centurion that's a
[40:21] relatively low ranking military officer
[40:23] in charge of 60 to 100 soldiers to keep
[40:25] Paul in custody but to let him have some
[40:28] limited Liberty and that that Roman
[40:31] officer should forbid menopause
[40:33] acquaintance of his friends to come and
[40:35] minister or come unto him
[40:37] we'll talk more about one of these
[40:39] friends when we get to acts 27
[40:42] but we're in 25 tonight
[40:46] and after some days when Felix came with
[40:49] his wife Drusilla which was a Jewish in
[40:51] fact she was a daughter of Herod Agrippa
[40:55] he sent for Paul and heard him
[40:56] concerning the faith in Christ
[40:59] and as Paul reasoned of righteousness
[41:02] Temperance that's self-control and
[41:05] judgment to come Felix trembled and
[41:07] answered or go thy way for this time
[41:09] when I have a convenience season I'll
[41:12] call for you Felix was afraid
[41:15] afraid of the consequences of his life
[41:17] under Paul's Ministries he understood
[41:19] that so Felix
[41:21] also hope that money should be given him
[41:23] of Paul that he might lose him
[41:25] wherefore he sent from the oftener and
[41:27] communed with him
[41:28] Felix was corrupt
[41:31] that's all there is to it it's all too
[41:32] common throughout human history he
[41:34] wanted a bribe to release Paul but after
[41:37] two years
[41:39] Perseus Festus came into Felix room in
[41:42] other words
[41:43] Festus became the governor and Felix was
[41:46] no longer the governor and Felix willing
[41:48] to show the Jews a pleasure to gain
[41:51] favor left Paul
[41:54] bound
[41:55] there's a lot going on in this verse 27
[41:59] we'll investigate some of that this
[42:00] evening as it applies to chapter 25 but
[42:03] you're tired now so please be seated
[42:08] we see Paul's been kept in custody
[42:12] for two years
[42:14] Felix refuses to release him
[42:17] or to condemn him
[42:19] Paul's life is on hold there's no formal
[42:22] charges or Lodge so no one can prove him
[42:25] guilty and he can't prove his innocence
[42:28] now as you'll probably expect from me by
[42:30] now I want to read from a totally
[42:32] different place in the Bible
[42:35] let's pick up the story of Paul from
[42:37] Genesis chapter 40. it's a good place to
[42:40] start Genesis
[42:41] and verse 23
[42:43] . here a fellow named Joseph is in
[42:46] prison
[42:48] he had interpreted the dreams of a baker
[42:50] and a butler and those dreams came to
[42:52] pass exactly as he told them it would
[42:55] he asked the butler to remember him not
[42:57] the baker because the baker was going to
[42:59] die
[43:00] and bring his situation to the attention
[43:02] of pharaoh not unlike Paul appealing his
[43:05] case to Caesar
[43:07] let's read Genesis 40 starting at verse
[43:10] 23.
[43:12] yet did not the chief Butler remember
[43:14] Joseph but forgot him
[43:17] and the very next verse is Genesis 41
[43:21] verse 1. it came to pass at the end of
[43:23] two full years that Pharaoh dreamed and
[43:27] behold he stood by the river
[43:30] I once heard an amazing sermon from this
[43:34] portion of the Book of Genesis this part
[43:36] right here between 40 23 and 41 1.
[43:41] as you can see there's only a blank
[43:43] space
[43:45] but in that blank space two important
[43:47] years elapsed while Joseph was unjustly
[43:51] held in prison
[43:53] some of his experiences in that blank
[43:56] space would help shape his ability
[43:59] to be the number two person in Egypt
[44:02] maybe someday we'll have a chance to
[44:03] show what happened in that blank space
[44:07] well here in Acts some
[44:10] 1945 years after Joseph was released
[44:13] from prison we again read of 2
[44:16] silence
[44:17] a blank space
[44:19] also during an unjust imprisonment
[44:23] I'd like to make an observation here
[44:27] lack of evidence of activity is not
[44:32] evidence of a lack of activity
[44:36] let me repeat that lack of evidence of
[44:40] activity is not evidence of a lack of
[44:44] activity
[44:46] Luke's account of Acts contains only
[44:48] highlights in the early Ministry of
[44:51] Peter and then some highlights and the
[44:54] ministry of Paul the end of Acts 24 that
[44:56] we just read is in 60 A.D that's about
[45:00] 30 years after the day of Pentecost
[45:03] recorded in Acts 2.
[45:05] you can be sure there were a large
[45:07] number of evangelists spreading the
[45:09] gospel
[45:10] Peter Silas Timothy Apollos Barnabas
[45:15] many others whose names we don't know
[45:17] were active
[45:19] Peter didn't retire after he brought the
[45:22] gospel to Cornelius
[45:25] Paul was busy in Corinth during his
[45:27] first 18-month stay as well as his later
[45:29] three months day
[45:31] little details recorded at that time
[45:34] or of his activity in Ephesus which
[45:37] spans some three years
[45:40] Philip and cesarea wasn't known as the
[45:43] Evangelist because he stayed home once
[45:45] he arrived there after baptizing the
[45:46] Ethiopian treasurer
[45:50] what about James the Jerusalem Church
[45:52] didn't number in the many thousands
[45:54] because the apostles stopped their
[45:56] Witness
[45:57] remember at the first wave of
[45:59] persecution many if not most fled
[46:02] Jerusalem we read when we studied acts 8
[46:04] verse 1. Saul that's Paul was consenting
[46:06] unto Stephen's death and at that time
[46:09] there was a minor insignificant
[46:12] no a great
[46:15] persecution against the church which was
[46:17] at Jerusalem and a few fled the city no
[46:22] act says they were all scattered abroad
[46:25] throughout the regions of Judea and
[46:27] Samaria except the apostles Peter and
[46:30] James and others of the original
[46:32] disciples of Jesus
[46:34] this verse tells us a large portion of
[46:37] the thousands of converts recorded on
[46:39] the day of Pentecost and shortly
[46:41] thereafter
[46:43] fled Jerusalem
[46:45] what remained was the core of the
[46:47] Apostles
[46:48] the church body had to be rebuilt new
[46:51] converts added certainly some would have
[46:53] returned after the persecution settled
[46:55] down but it's safe to say that James and
[46:58] Peter and the others continued their
[47:01] witness and their Ministry
[47:04] looking Beyond Jerusalem what about
[47:06] Priscilla and Akila what about the
[47:08] church in Antioch
[47:10] what about the churches throughout Asia
[47:12] and Europe and what we call the Middle
[47:13] East that Paul and Barnabas and Silas
[47:15] and others founded Philippi thessalonica
[47:18] Berea Corinth Ephesus
[47:22] the church didn't die
[47:25] congregations didn't collapse Luke's
[47:28] narrative the book of Acts is narrowly
[47:31] focused it's not a broad record of all
[47:34] activity
[47:35] it's called The Acts of the Apostles but
[47:37] it could be called some of the acts of a
[47:40] few of the Apostles over many decades
[47:42] not all the acts of every apostle
[47:47] back to Genesis I I'm sure Joseph
[47:49] wondered why he would
[47:53] in the prison
[47:55] beneath Potiphar's house at the end of
[47:59] Genesis 40.
[48:01] but he didn't spend his time bemoaning
[48:03] his fate
[48:05] he continued his life he continued
[48:07] serving in that prison and was being
[48:09] prepared for the transformation that
[48:12] would occur in Genesis 41.
[48:15] and here in Acts this Saint Paul had
[48:18] been released from prison by an
[48:20] earthquake in Philippi
[48:22] right the earthquake came he witnessed
[48:24] to the Jailer it was in prison for a day
[48:27] this time
[48:29] it's been two years
[48:30] there's no earthquake
[48:32] Peter had twice been set free by angels
[48:34] from confinement in Jerusalem
[48:37] for Paul
[48:39] there'd be no angel to Spring him from
[48:41] caesarea
[48:43] in the past he'd born physical suffering
[48:46] and deprivation for his witness to the
[48:48] gospel
[48:48] he hadn't been confined for any length
[48:51] of time
[48:52] prior to this incarceration
[48:55] frankly I I wish personally that the ax
[48:58] account told us why the other Christians
[48:59] didn't just pay the bribe and set Paul
[49:01] free
[49:03] maybe they tried maybe Felix was too
[49:06] greedy maybe Paul said no
[49:08] we don't know
[49:10] and therefore we can't judge
[49:13] what we do know as we saw in Acts 24 was
[49:16] that Paul used his opportunities to
[49:20] witness to Felix he didn't give up
[49:22] he didn't wallow himself pity though I'm
[49:26] sure he earnestly prayed to be set free
[49:28] and I'm sure many others were praying
[49:31] for him to be set free
[49:34] and I'm also sure that there were some
[49:36] detractors that said uh Paul you know he
[49:39] was told by many in the spirit he
[49:41] shouldn't go to Jerusalem did he listen
[49:44] no not stubborn Iron Will Paul now look
[49:47] at him
[49:49] Paul would later write that he learned
[49:51] to be content and whatsoever State he
[49:54] found himself
[49:56] when we encounter dry places blank
[50:00] spaces in our lives isolation
[50:03] prayers that seemingly are unanswered
[50:06] the spirit sometimes seems far away
[50:10] we must continue to be what he has
[50:13] called us to be it isn't about our
[50:16] circumstances
[50:18] it isn't about our comfort
[50:20] it isn't about what we feel
[50:22] it's about faith
[50:24] continuing to believe it's about him
[50:27] and his often mysterious will being
[50:30] worked out in our lives
[50:33] it's about being a Christian
[50:36] in the blank spaces
[50:39] Paul wrote to the Romans shortly before
[50:41] his imprisonment in caesarea in Romans 8
[50:44] 14 he said for as many as are led by the
[50:46] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[50:51] Solomon wrote something a little similar
[50:54] proverbs 3.
[50:56] heard this many times I'm sure trust in
[51:00] the Lord with all fine heart
[51:04] lean not
[51:06] unto thy knowing understanding that
[51:08] sometimes is pretty hard in all thy ways
[51:11] acknowledge Him
[51:14] and he shall Direct
[51:17] bypass
[51:20] whenever I read this Heather and I we
[51:23] can't help but here brother red certel's
[51:25] voice when he read this passage in
[51:27] Proverbs as he minister to us in his
[51:29] living room in gizborne New Zealand more
[51:31] than 50 years ago
[51:33] he he brought it to life for us
[51:36] in those dark in those dry places
[51:39] continue to seek the Lord
[51:41] and trust the Lord
[51:43] be like job
[51:45] never give up
[51:49] or back to acts let's see where were we
[51:51] 24 27 to me this is this is like chapter
[51:55] 25 verse 0 just before verse one
[51:58] it says but after two years forecast
[52:01] Festus came into Felix room Festus
[52:04] became Governor replacing Felix and
[52:07] Felix willing to show the Jews of
[52:09] pleasure left Paul found
[52:14] have you ever read acts 24 verse 27 and
[52:18] wondered
[52:19] what was going on behind the scenes
[52:23] why was Felix being replaced with Festus
[52:28] is that the normal order of events
[52:31] why was Felix so intent on showing the
[52:33] Jews a pleasure
[52:35] that he was no longer going to be
[52:37] governing
[52:38] why would he care
[52:42] as we read chapter 25 we'll see that
[52:45] Festus was yet another unjust judge
[52:48] along with a fellow we'll meet called
[52:49] King Agrippa but but let's take a brief
[52:52] a brief but closer
[52:55] look at Felix
[52:57] I'm going to give you a little
[52:58] historical information it's from the
[53:01] Jewish encyclopedia
[53:03] Felix was a governor of Galilee and he
[53:06] was promoted to be governor of Judea a
[53:09] much larger territory by the emperor
[53:10] Claudius and 52 A.D
[53:14] according to the Roman historian tacitus
[53:17] Felix exercised quote the Royal
[53:19] prerogative in a slavish sense with all
[53:22] manner of cruelties and excesses
[53:26] it was he who excited the bitter
[53:28] feelings of the Jewish Patriots to the
[53:31] highest pitch
[53:32] as they moved closer and closer to open
[53:34] rebellion in the first Jewish revolt
[53:37] Felix was right there
[53:39] putting on the pressure according to
[53:41] Josephus Felix sent the chief of the
[53:44] zealots Eliezer Bay deny and chains to
[53:47] Rome while taking Relentless measures
[53:50] against his followers the zealots whom
[53:53] he'd announced as robbers Joseph
[53:56] Josephus says crucifying them in
[53:59] countless numbers
[54:01] Felix also proceeded rigorously against
[54:04] the would-be prophets that were
[54:05] disturbing the peace with their
[54:06] fanaticism especially against an
[54:09] Egyptian Jew who with several thousand
[54:11] followers attempted to drive the Roman
[54:13] Garrison from Jerusalem but was defeated
[54:15] and that's probably the Egyptian that
[54:17] Claudius lysius mistook Paul for at his
[54:21] arrest
[54:22] Felix's term of office we're told was
[54:25] practically A Reign of Anarchy for even
[54:27] the high Priestly families war with the
[54:29] lower priests we saw that and Paul's
[54:32] trial before the Sanhedrin in Acts 23.
[54:36] during Felix's term
[54:39] the Jewish encyclopedia tells us the
[54:41] Apostle Paul was taken prisoner at
[54:43] caesarea
[54:44] a fierce contest arose at that time
[54:48] between the Jewish and Syrian citizens
[54:52] of caesarea
[54:54] and as Felix acted unjustly toward the
[55:00] Jews it was so bad that he was recalled
[55:03] by Nero about 60 A.D
[55:07] at the intercession of an influential
[55:09] man named palace with neuro Felix
[55:11] escaped punishment
[55:13] so we see Paul was taken prisoner in 58
[55:16] A.D Felix was recalled in 60. Felix was
[55:20] ruthless plant
[55:22] the Flames of rebellion I I probably
[55:24] need a drink
[55:28] he was also responsible it turns out for
[55:31] the murder of the high priest Jonathan
[55:32] which led to ananias this fellow being
[55:35] the high priest during this period with
[55:37] Paul
[55:38] after eight years under Felix Festus
[55:40] took over the governance of Roman Judea
[55:43] Felix having lost his position due to
[55:46] his persecution of the local Jewish
[55:49] population tried to make amends or at
[55:52] least hoped to secure his own safeties
[55:54] who left caesarea by keeping Paul
[55:57] incarcerated as a favor he was still
[56:00] able to Grant
[56:04] I'm sure you all knew all of that about
[56:05] Felix but I needed to refresh my memory
[56:08] about it so I thought I'd share that
[56:09] with you let's move on now to 25 and
[56:12] verse 1. now when Festus was come into
[56:15] the Province to replace Felix after
[56:19] three days he ascended from caesarea to
[56:22] Jerusalem
[56:24] now as you as you know one always goes
[56:27] up to Jerusalem or comes down from
[56:29] Jerusalem and he most certainly went
[56:31] there to acquaint himself with the
[56:33] Jewish religious leadership pay his
[56:35] respects and introduce himself to them
[56:37] as their new Roman governor
[56:40] then the high priest is ananias and the
[56:43] chief of the Jews informed against Paul
[56:46] notes they laid out their case they made
[56:48] accusations to Festus against Paul and
[56:51] they besought They begged they urged
[56:54] they pleaded with Festus
[56:58] and they the priests desired favor of
[57:01] Festus against Paul
[57:03] that Festus would send for Paul to
[57:06] Jerusalem would transfer Paul to
[57:08] Jerusalem and meanwhile they would be
[57:10] laying in wait the Jewish leaders would
[57:12] be preparing an ambush in the way to
[57:15] kill him
[57:17] these guys don't really like Paul very
[57:21] much do they
[57:22] remember back in Acts 23
[57:25] there have been a plot to lure Paul to
[57:28] the Jerusalem Council and lay an ambush
[57:30] to kill him on the way
[57:32] at that time it was a youth
[57:35] it was a young boy
[57:38] that saved Paul's life
[57:40] recall Paul's nephew his sister's son
[57:44] heard that an ambush was being planned
[57:47] Paul was going to be summoned to the
[57:49] Jerusalem Council and be killed on the
[57:50] way from the castle to the council by
[57:52] these 40 guys that would be there to
[57:54] Ambush and kill him
[57:56] now we don't know the age of the young
[57:57] man I I'm guessing that he was probably
[58:00] between the age of eight
[58:02] and perhaps as old as 15 that intervene
[58:04] that's why I asked Elijah Andre
[58:08] to portray Paul's nephew when we studied
[58:10] acts 23 some of you might have been here
[58:13] and remembered that Elijah if you're
[58:14] here or streaming or listening great job
[58:18] but how
[58:19] do I was such a young person brother
[58:21] Lyle
[58:22] well it says here acts 23 19 then the
[58:26] chief Captain took him by the hand and
[58:28] went with him aside privately and asked
[58:31] him what is it you have to tell me
[58:34] well I see is took him by the hand
[58:36] the 10 year old sure come come here what
[58:39] what is this that you want to tell me a
[58:41] 20 year old he's not going to take him
[58:43] by the hand what do you want right
[58:45] so we can tell from the context that
[58:48] this was a young fellow
[58:50] what if this boy had thought well I'm
[58:54] just a kid
[58:56] no one's going to pay attention to me
[58:57] those guys are probably drunk or
[58:59] something they they probably weren't
[59:01] serious and castles a scary place
[59:05] think about this
[59:07] if that young person
[59:10] had not stepped up
[59:12] overcome his natural fear
[59:15] and Lycia said not believed him
[59:18] Paul would have been killed in the
[59:20] ambush
[59:21] and we would not have the following
[59:23] Epistles Ephesians
[59:26] Philippians
[59:27] Colossians
[59:29] first and second Timothy
[59:31] Titus Philemon Hebrews
[59:35] these wouldn't be in our Bibles today
[59:37] imagine your new testament missing
[59:39] those books those Epistles those letters
[59:41] but they are thanks in part
[59:45] to that boy
[59:47] when you read those sometimes you might
[59:49] think about that this is here because it
[59:52] was a a little boy that overcame his
[59:55] fear and helped his Uncle Paul
[59:58] well back to Acts 25.
[1:00:02] the priests desired favor of Festus
[1:00:04] against Paul that Festus would transfer
[1:00:06] Paul to Jerusalem laying wait in the way
[1:00:07] to kill him verse 4 but Festus refused
[1:00:11] their request and answered that Paul
[1:00:13] should be kept Paul's being held in
[1:00:14] custody at caesarea and that he himself
[1:00:17] Festus would depart shortly thither too
[1:00:20] caesarea
[1:00:23] let them therefore said he which among
[1:00:26] you are able go down to caesarea with me
[1:00:28] and Abel here doesn't mean that you're
[1:00:31] able to travel you're not in firm or
[1:00:33] something but leaders competent men
[1:00:36] positions of authority able to make
[1:00:38] their case
[1:00:39] go down to assessor with me and accuse
[1:00:41] this man if there be any wickedness in
[1:00:43] him press charges against him at trial
[1:00:46] there the the Roman capital of Judea is
[1:00:49] caesarea not Jerusalem old court and
[1:00:51] accessories
[1:00:54] and when Festus had tarried among them
[1:00:56] in Jerusalem for more than 10 days
[1:00:59] he went down to caesarea and the next
[1:01:01] day sitting on the judgments he wasted
[1:01:04] no time
[1:01:05] he convened the court and commanded Paul
[1:01:07] to be brought
[1:01:08] to stand trial again
[1:01:13] this is the third time we call the first
[1:01:15] trial in Acts 23
[1:01:17] Paul perceived that one part this was
[1:01:19] the Jerusalem Council where Sadducees
[1:01:21] and the other Pharisees he cried out to
[1:01:23] the council men and brother and I'm a
[1:01:25] Pharisee
[1:01:26] my dad was a Pharisee of the hope and
[1:01:29] resurrection of the dead I'm called to
[1:01:31] question
[1:01:32] and we read we talked about it before
[1:01:35] this big fight that they started to have
[1:01:36] so in verse 10 we read that uh
[1:01:40] when there arose a great dissension the
[1:01:42] chief Captain that's Claudia sliceus
[1:01:45] fearing Paul should have been pulled in
[1:01:47] pieces of them so it wasn't just a
[1:01:50] verbal argument
[1:01:52] it was physically violent
[1:01:54] we got a couple of boxers here
[1:01:56] yeah so those guys know what we're
[1:01:58] talking about
[1:02:00] commanded the soldiers to get out and
[1:02:01] take them by force from among them and
[1:02:04] to bring them into the castle what today
[1:02:05] we might call protective custody
[1:02:08] the Roman soldiers had to rescue Paul
[1:02:11] from that trial
[1:02:13] a few days later was Paul's second trial
[1:02:15] before Felix who refused to pass
[1:02:18] judgment
[1:02:19] with our new knowledge of Felix what I
[1:02:21] just read to you and you all memorized
[1:02:23] from that Jewish encyclopedia rapidly
[1:02:25] taking detailed notes
[1:02:27] let's look again at this initial
[1:02:29] presentation of the prosecutor to Felix
[1:02:31] and don't worry it's just five verses
[1:02:34] we read that after five days ananias a
[1:02:38] high priest descended came down to
[1:02:40] caesarea from Jerusalem with the elders
[1:02:42] and with an order named Turtles who
[1:02:45] informed the governor against Paul so as
[1:02:47] our brother Daniel pointed out he's a
[1:02:49] prosecutor
[1:02:53] knowing what we know about Festus when
[1:02:55] you read this is just have to shake your
[1:02:57] head I mean about Felix we just called
[1:02:59] forth Turtles began to accuse Paul
[1:03:01] saying
[1:03:02] seeing that by thee we enjoy great
[1:03:05] quietness
[1:03:07] yeah he's getting the Zeal it's all
[1:03:09] stirred up and crucifying them in
[1:03:11] countless numbers and that very worthy
[1:03:13] Deeds are done unto this nation by thy
[1:03:15] Providence like killing Jonathan the
[1:03:17] high priest
[1:03:19] we accept it always and in all places
[1:03:22] most noble Felix with all thankfulness
[1:03:26] that Felix may be cruel he's not stupid
[1:03:29] he can see right through this guy
[1:03:31] notwithstanding that I be not further
[1:03:33] tedious unto thee I pray that one is
[1:03:35] here so they come and see if a few words
[1:03:36] but now verse 5. knowing what we know
[1:03:40] about Felix for we have found this man
[1:03:43] Paul a pestilent fellow and a mover of
[1:03:45] sedition
[1:03:47] in other words he's lumping Paul with
[1:03:49] the zealots the ones that they know that
[1:03:51] Felix chases down and kills
[1:03:54] Paul's one of these guys a mover of
[1:03:57] sedition among all the Jews throughout
[1:03:59] the world not just here everywhere and
[1:04:02] not
[1:04:03] a non-ringleader of the sect of the
[1:04:06] nazarenes
[1:04:08] oh so he's an attempt to connect Paul
[1:04:10] and all the other Christians to the
[1:04:11] zealots these guys really don't like
[1:04:13] Paula they don't like Christians
[1:04:16] in Israel when we lived there
[1:04:19] how many years ago was that close to 50.
[1:04:24] yeah I guess I can believe it Christians
[1:04:27] there are known as note Stream So I was
[1:04:29] a notes error and notes Remus plural it
[1:04:31] means nazarenes so today the Hebrew word
[1:04:34] for Christian is Nazarene
[1:04:37] okay going on let's just see verse 22
[1:04:40] which is how we opened this evening when
[1:04:42] Felix heard these things having more
[1:04:44] perfect knowledge of that way that is
[1:04:46] Christianity he deferred them he put
[1:04:48] this off delayed said when life see us
[1:04:50] the chief Captain shall come down all
[1:04:52] know the uttermost of your matter
[1:04:54] so here we go again it's two years later
[1:04:57] trial number three before the newly
[1:04:59] appointed Governor Festus
[1:05:01] acts 25 verse 7.
[1:05:04] and when he Paul was come into the
[1:05:07] courtroom
[1:05:08] the Jews which came down from Jerusalem
[1:05:11] stood round about they surrounded Paul
[1:05:13] and laid many and Grievous complaints
[1:05:16] against Paul
[1:05:18] which they could not prove
[1:05:19] accusations no evidence
[1:05:25] while he Paul answered for himself
[1:05:31] I'm sure he was looking at Festus maybe
[1:05:34] at some of these other guys and said
[1:05:35] neither against the law of the Jews
[1:05:40] neither against the temple
[1:05:43] nor yet against Caesar Roman law
[1:05:46] have I offended anything at all
[1:05:51] Festus wanting to the Jews of pleasure
[1:05:54] answered actually interrupted Paul and
[1:05:56] said well will you go up to Jerusalem
[1:05:59] and there be tried and judged of these
[1:06:01] accusations before me
[1:06:04] yet another delay
[1:06:06] Festus has heard the arguments he's been
[1:06:09] presented with the lack of evidence
[1:06:11] but he seems to refuse to do his job as
[1:06:14] a judge
[1:06:16] Paul's had enough of this nonsense Felix
[1:06:19] wanted a bribe Festus is having a hard
[1:06:23] time making a decision now the back
[1:06:25] route to context
[1:06:28] is the growing recess of the people of
[1:06:30] Judea
[1:06:31] a simmering pot that's about to boil
[1:06:33] over in Rebellion
[1:06:35] Festus is a politician
[1:06:37] is unwilling to do what he already knows
[1:06:39] is the right thing and he apparently
[1:06:41] fears the consequences in the context of
[1:06:44] his new role and just getting acquainted
[1:06:46] with the other leaders in the
[1:06:48] complexities of this province called
[1:06:50] Judea so he's proceeding slowly and
[1:06:53] carefully
[1:06:57] then said Paul
[1:06:59] I stand at Caesar's judgment seat I'm
[1:07:02] I'm here in a Roman Court where I ought
[1:07:05] to be judged here in your court in
[1:07:09] caesarea not in Jerusalem where they
[1:07:12] only want to kill me
[1:07:13] to the Jews
[1:07:15] I've done no wrong
[1:07:17] that was pretty angry
[1:07:19] we see a another little bit of Paul's uh
[1:07:23] temper I think here he publicly scolds
[1:07:26] Festus to the Jews I have done no wrong
[1:07:29] as thou very well knowest
[1:07:32] oops
[1:07:34] for if I be an offender
[1:07:37] or have committed anything worthy of
[1:07:39] death
[1:07:41] refuse not to die
[1:07:43] remember from our previous study a Roman
[1:07:45] citizen condemned to death at least in
[1:07:47] theory has the right to demand
[1:07:49] banishment rather than death so Paul's
[1:07:52] again reminding everyone that he's a
[1:07:54] Roman citizen
[1:07:56] but if there be none of these things
[1:07:58] whereof these accuse me
[1:08:01] no man May deliver me unto them my
[1:08:05] accusers frankly including you Governor
[1:08:09] Festus since you're apparently unwilling
[1:08:11] to equip me I appeal unto Caesar
[1:08:18] appeal unto Caesar what does that
[1:08:20] actually mean
[1:08:22] repealed to Caesar does that mean the
[1:08:24] emperor himself would try the case
[1:08:27] does it mean the case
[1:08:29] has to have already been decided much
[1:08:31] like an appellate court in America today
[1:08:34] what's going on
[1:08:36] but a Roman law I don't speak Latin
[1:08:40] I don't pronounce Latin but it's called
[1:08:43] The Lexington
[1:08:44] was passed about 20 BC along with many
[1:08:48] other reforms under Caesar Augustus
[1:08:50] around that time this is from a textbook
[1:08:52] of this period by a fellow named FF
[1:08:54] Bruce if you want to look it up it
[1:08:57] forbade any magistrate to kill Scourge
[1:09:01] chain torture or even sentence a Roman
[1:09:04] citizen who has announced his intention
[1:09:06] to appeal or prevent him from going to
[1:09:09] Rome to Lodge's appeal there within a
[1:09:11] fixed time
[1:09:12] this is the same law that stopped
[1:09:14] Claudius lysius from having Paul
[1:09:16] scourged it's why he feared himself when
[1:09:19] he'd had Paul bound with chains at his
[1:09:21] arrest once you realized Paul was a
[1:09:24] Roman citizen
[1:09:26] Nero
[1:09:28] this user at this time became emperor in
[1:09:31] 54 A.D about the time that Paul set out
[1:09:33] on his third missionary journey
[1:09:36] Nero said according to the Roman
[1:09:38] historian tacitus that he would not be
[1:09:41] judged in all cases and until 62 or 63
[1:09:44] A.D he made no exceptions and just
[1:09:46] simply wouldn't judge anyone and only
[1:09:49] did a few after that time so appeals
[1:09:51] cases were apparently assigned to
[1:09:52] various officials
[1:09:55] so thus in Rome Paul would most likely
[1:09:58] be Tried by an imperial representative
[1:10:00] subject to Roman law but he had this
[1:10:03] right to appeal
[1:10:07] then Festus
[1:10:10] when he had conferred with the council
[1:10:13] clearly realizing Paula just given him a
[1:10:15] way to appease the Jewish religious
[1:10:18] leaders and wash his hands of the whole
[1:10:20] mess that Fest Felix had left him
[1:10:22] answered
[1:10:25] have you appealed to Caesar
[1:10:27] under Caesar you'll go
[1:10:31] oh well some days later after certain
[1:10:34] days King Agrippa and Bernice Burness is
[1:10:38] this King agrippa's sister and both are
[1:10:41] children of a fellow named Herod Agrippa
[1:10:44] they came into caesarea to salute Festus
[1:10:47] to greet him congratulate him on his
[1:10:49] appointment as a procurator of Judea we
[1:10:52] all know who this guy is right
[1:10:56] review
[1:10:57] when we studied acts 12 we went over all
[1:11:00] the various Kings of portions of Judea
[1:11:03] in the gospels and acts
[1:11:05] so this is the Dynasty and a dynasty
[1:11:09] simply means this guy was ran things and
[1:11:12] then his kid ran things and his kid ran
[1:11:14] things and then somebody killed that kid
[1:11:17] and so they it was so a different family
[1:11:19] took over so a dynasty is just a family
[1:11:21] line okay so this is the dynasty of
[1:11:24] Herod the Great
[1:11:26] so Herod the Great when the Bible says
[1:11:29] the in yellow is the the the name that's
[1:11:33] given in the New Testament when you're
[1:11:34] reading and that's why it gets confusing
[1:11:36] because we've got three different people
[1:11:37] that are all called Herod
[1:11:39] so Herod the Great was the Herod at the
[1:11:41] time of Jesus birth and he died about
[1:11:42] for BC
[1:11:45] Herod Antipas you see directly below
[1:11:47] Herod the Great was the Herod of John
[1:11:49] the Baptist and Jesus judgment
[1:11:51] he died about 39 A.D
[1:11:56] over here on the on the on
[1:12:00] your left no you're right yes yes
[1:12:04] it's like the fellow said at the train
[1:12:05] station well if I want to get to this
[1:12:07] place for the said well turn to the left
[1:12:09] and you'll be right and the person said
[1:12:11] don't be emptying it he said well then
[1:12:13] turn to the right and you'll be left but
[1:12:15] anyway
[1:12:16] heroda gripper was a nephew of Herod
[1:12:18] Antipas and a grandson of Herod the
[1:12:20] Great
[1:12:21] it was a herd who persecuted the early
[1:12:23] Church in Jerusalem and who died after
[1:12:25] his speech listed in Acts 12 around 44
[1:12:28] A.D
[1:12:30] so when we see this name Agrippa this is
[1:12:33] actually Herod Agrippa II but in the in
[1:12:36] acts in 25 and 26 he's simply called
[1:12:39] Agrippa
[1:12:40] he's great grandson of Herod the Great
[1:12:43] and the last of the dynasty he was made
[1:12:45] King and 53 A.D
[1:12:48] it turns out that he and Josephus that
[1:12:50] famous historian were correspondents
[1:12:52] after the failed Jewish rebellion of
[1:12:55] 66-73-80 in fact Joseph publishes two or
[1:12:59] three of the letters that they exchanged
[1:13:01] in his
[1:13:02] massive work that's very difficult to
[1:13:05] read and this Herod Agrippa II was the
[1:13:08] one who tried to quell the Rebellion he
[1:13:10] fled your DNA in 66 A.D when it was
[1:13:12] clear it could not be prevented he
[1:13:14] eventually died in Rome various sources
[1:13:17] say it was 92 A.D or 100 A.D
[1:13:21] well here's his territory and we don't
[1:13:25] really need to to zoom in on this Z
[1:13:27] Paul's captivity in caesarea that's
[1:13:29] where that is this whole green area is
[1:13:31] the province of Judea under Felix and
[1:13:34] later under Festus these three little
[1:13:36] spots that are circled in red that's the
[1:13:38] domain of Herod Agrippa II so you can
[1:13:42] see that
[1:13:44] he really has no jurisdiction in Judea
[1:13:48] or Samaria so this is a state visit of
[1:13:50] Pomp and Circumstances it's Trudeau
[1:13:54] coming down to see Biden or vice versa
[1:13:56] they we have a common border but not a
[1:13:59] common government
[1:14:00] so this visit will read about now in
[1:14:03] Acts 25 is a formal visit with Pomp and
[1:14:05] ceremony but Agrippa has no jurisdiction
[1:14:09] so continuing on verse 14. and when they
[1:14:13] Agrippa and Bernice had been there in
[1:14:14] cesarea Festus many days so they're
[1:14:17] visiting and after a while you know
[1:14:19] they're probably sitting around having
[1:14:20] dinner and having a cup of whatever they
[1:14:22] had a cup of and they're talking about
[1:14:24] stuff and eventually they get a little
[1:14:26] bit bored and what are we going to talk
[1:14:27] about now and how long is this guy going
[1:14:29] to be hanging around and uh oh hey you
[1:14:32] know
[1:14:33] uh Festus uh talks to Griffin he says
[1:14:36] you know a strange thing there's there's
[1:14:39] a guy that was left here in bonds by
[1:14:41] Felix
[1:14:43] and when I went to Jerusalem when I
[1:14:45] first came to this place and went up
[1:14:47] there to check things out and get
[1:14:48] acquainted with everybody the chief
[1:14:50] priests and the Elders of the Jews
[1:14:51] accused this guy to me and that he
[1:14:53] desire to have judgment against them
[1:14:55] they they wanted me to condemn this guy
[1:14:58] to whom I answered it's not the manner
[1:15:01] of Romans to deliver any man to die
[1:15:03] before that which he is Accused have the
[1:15:06] accusers face to face and have license
[1:15:08] or opportunity to answer for himself
[1:15:10] concerning the crime laid against him
[1:15:12] with which he's charged
[1:15:15] just because you don't like him doesn't
[1:15:17] mean I'm going to kill him
[1:15:19] so I had him come down and when they
[1:15:21] came hither without any delay on the
[1:15:24] morrow in fact the very next morning I
[1:15:26] convened a trial and sat on the Judgment
[1:15:28] seat and commanded this man Paul to be
[1:15:31] brought forth
[1:15:33] against
[1:15:36] whom
[1:15:37] when the accusers the priests and
[1:15:39] council members from Jerusalem stood up
[1:15:42] they brought no accusation of such
[1:15:45] things that violate Roman law as I
[1:15:48] suppose that they were going to do but
[1:15:50] I have certain questions or charges
[1:15:53] against them of their own Superstition
[1:15:55] their religion and some guy called Jesus
[1:15:58] which was dead but Paul said was alive
[1:16:03] because I doubted such manner of
[1:16:05] questions I'm not Jewish I I don't know
[1:16:08] how to proceed how do I investigate
[1:16:10] something like this this is all very
[1:16:12] confusing I asked Paul whether he would
[1:16:14] go to Jerusalem and never be judged of
[1:16:16] these matters
[1:16:17] in their own courts while I presided
[1:16:20] in Roman law this is known as
[1:16:23] extraordinum which literally means not
[1:16:25] on the list of offenses
[1:16:28] so if a person is broken a law and it's
[1:16:30] on the oh we can go to chapter so and so
[1:16:33] of our law book and it says oh yeah no
[1:16:35] you're not supposed to do this here's
[1:16:37] the punishment but this is something
[1:16:39] that wasn't in their list of laws so
[1:16:41] they had rules for how you deal with
[1:16:43] that
[1:16:43] a lot of latitude is given to the
[1:16:46] governor or the head of a tribunal
[1:16:48] that's hearing such matters
[1:16:50] so Festus is saying this isn't a normal
[1:16:52] offense it's not on the list
[1:16:54] wants a little help to understand if an
[1:16:56] offense has actually occurred and if so
[1:16:58] what a reasonable punishment might be
[1:17:04] but when Paul had appealed to be
[1:17:06] reserved under the hearing of Augustus
[1:17:08] now that's not actually Augustus who's
[1:17:10] long dead but in other words the emperor
[1:17:13] I commanded him
[1:17:16] until I might send him to Caesar
[1:17:19] you can make that arrangement then
[1:17:21] Agrippa
[1:17:23] who knows a lot about Jewish stuff
[1:17:26] he said oh
[1:17:28] interesting I I'd like to hear the man
[1:17:31] myself
[1:17:34] um
[1:17:35] tomorrow said Festus you'll hear him
[1:17:39] and on the morrow
[1:17:41] when Agrippa was come and purness with
[1:17:44] great pomp and was entered into the
[1:17:47] place of hearing with the chief captains
[1:17:49] and principal men of the city at Festus
[1:17:52] commandment Paul was brought forth so
[1:17:54] this is just a big show trial sort of
[1:17:57] thing it's not even really a trial
[1:17:59] because he's already appealed to Caesar
[1:18:03] and Festus said
[1:18:05] King Agrippa
[1:18:07] all men which are here present with us
[1:18:10] you see this man about whom all the
[1:18:13] multitude of the Jews have dealt with me
[1:18:15] both at Jerusalem and also here
[1:18:18] crying that he ought not to live any
[1:18:20] longer
[1:18:23] but when I found he had committed
[1:18:25] nothing worthy of death
[1:18:28] but which fact I was unwilling to state
[1:18:30] that the trial and thus set him free
[1:18:34] but it's obvious that he's innocent and
[1:18:36] that he himself hath appealed to
[1:18:38] Augustus that is the emperor
[1:18:41] because he's been detained for two years
[1:18:43] is clearly innocent disgusted I wouldn't
[1:18:45] make the perfectly obvious decision to
[1:18:47] free him I have determined to send him
[1:18:50] to Rome
[1:18:52] of whom but regarding Paul I have no
[1:18:56] certain thing no specific accusation to
[1:18:58] write unto my Lord Caesar the emperor
[1:19:01] the wherefore I have brought him forth
[1:19:04] before you all and especially before
[1:19:06] they do okay
[1:19:07] that after hearing the evidence after
[1:19:10] examination had I might have something
[1:19:13] to write
[1:19:14] maybe you could help me figure out what
[1:19:16] he is or should be accused of within
[1:19:18] Roman law or a clear statement of
[1:19:21] offense of extraordinum
[1:19:24] I laugh when I read this next verse
[1:19:27] it seems to me unreasonable to send a
[1:19:30] prisoner and not be able to say what the
[1:19:32] crimes are against him
[1:19:35] oh look like a buffoon or at least
[1:19:38] incompetent if I send him and say I
[1:19:41] don't know what he did or why I'm
[1:19:42] sending him to you
[1:19:45] the next verse then Agrippa said to Paul
[1:19:49] Thou Art permitted to speak for thyself
[1:19:51] then Paul stretched forth a hand and
[1:19:54] answered for himself oh
[1:19:56] that's acts that's Acts 26.
[1:19:59] Oh Come Back
[1:20:02] brother Daniel we'll teach from Acts 26
[1:20:05] and tell you about Paul's response to
[1:20:06] Agrippa
[1:20:10] what can we learn
[1:20:11] from Acts 25. to apply to our lives
[1:20:16] I I think one of the most important
[1:20:19] things is to not become discouraged
[1:20:23] like Paul
[1:20:24] like Joseph we need to persevere
[1:20:28] those blank spaces in our lives
[1:20:31] times have drawn times of difficulty in
[1:20:34] isolation we need to hold fast musicians
[1:20:37] would please come
[1:20:39] remind ourselves of the love and grace
[1:20:42] bestowed upon us by the God we know
[1:20:45] and love and serve
[1:20:48] be sensitive to those around us who
[1:20:51] might be encouraged or helped by contact
[1:20:53] like like Paul in prison but allowed
[1:20:56] visitation and assistance by his friends
[1:20:58] his fellow Believers in spite of
[1:21:00] continued isolation or opposition this
[1:21:02] past week Heather and I visited an old
[1:21:05] friend who was hospitalized had been for
[1:21:08] several days he commented to us that it
[1:21:11] was a time of reflection for him to look
[1:21:13] back on his life to this point and think
[1:21:15] about things
[1:21:17] look for opportunity
[1:21:19] in every situation
[1:21:21] times for reflection
[1:21:23] meditation
[1:21:25] prayer to grow as Christians we need to
[1:21:28] read our Bibles and spend time in prayer
[1:21:32] daily
[1:21:33] there's no substitute for that
[1:21:36] always remember when Jesus spoke about
[1:21:39] dividing Souls at the final judgment in
[1:21:41] Matthew 7 part of The Sermon on the
[1:21:43] Mount blessed are these and blessed are
[1:21:45] those his sole Criterion
[1:21:48] was whether he had known whether he had
[1:21:51] a relationship
[1:21:52] with the one being evaluated not what
[1:21:55] the person did or knew or could quote or
[1:21:57] recite Miracles wrought in the name of
[1:22:00] Jesus Christ meant nothing at that day
[1:22:03] depart from me that work iniquity
[1:22:07] is what Jesus
[1:22:15] said Criterion
[1:22:16] I never knew you
[1:22:19] I never knew you
[1:22:21] be sure
[1:22:23] you know him
[1:22:25] and be absolutely certain
[1:22:27] he knows you
[1:22:29] a personal relationship
[1:22:32] with Jesus of Nazareth
[1:22:34] is not optional
[1:22:36] it's essential
[1:22:39] we close this part of the service
[1:22:46] yes okay I guess you're going to do your
[1:22:49] version rather than mine and that's fine
[1:22:50] I'd like us to sing at Calvary
[1:22:56] years I spent in vanity and pride
[1:23:02] caring not my Lord was crucified
[1:23:07] knowing not it was for me he died
[1:23:15] Glory
[1:23:19] Mercy there was great and Grace was free
[1:23:24] hard and there was multiplied to me
[1:23:30] there my burdens all found Liberty
[1:23:35] [Music]
[1:23:43] by God's word at last my sin I learned
[1:23:48] that
[1:23:50] trembled at the law I'd spurned
[1:23:54] till my guilty Soul employ
[1:23:59] [Music]
[1:24:06] Mercy there was great and Grace was free
[1:24:12] hard and there was multiplied to me
[1:24:18] there my burdens all found Liberty
[1:24:25] oh my
[1:24:29] [Music]
[1:24:30] now I've given to Jesus everything
[1:24:36] now I gladly own him as my king
[1:24:41] now my raptured soul can only sing of
[1:24:48] cows
[1:24:51] [Music]
[1:24:54] of
[1:24:54] Mercy there was great and Grace once
[1:24:58] free
[1:25:00] hard and there was multiplied to me
[1:25:06] bear my burdens all found Liberty
[1:25:12] [Music]
[1:25:18] oh the love that Drew salvation's plan
[1:25:24] oh the grace that brought it down to man
[1:25:30] oh the Mighty God that God did span at
[1:25:36] Town over here

[1:26:10] [Music]
[1:26:18] is
[1:26:22] [Music]
[1:26:28] amen I gotta read it again what Paul
[1:26:31] said I I love Paul's personality the guy
[1:26:34] was tough
[1:26:36] and you know he he didn't back down and
[1:26:40] when he knew he was right he would stand
[1:26:42] up to anybody remember when when the
[1:26:46] high priest had the guy slap him in the
[1:26:48] face
[1:26:49] he was there Chained and he said the
[1:26:51] Lord's gonna Smite you you Whited wall I
[1:26:55] love that about Paul
[1:26:56] says this
[1:26:58] then said Paul
[1:27:01] I stand at Caesar's judgment seat where
[1:27:04] I ought to be judged
[1:27:06] to the Jews
[1:27:08] have I done no wrong
[1:27:10] as thou very well knowest brother Joseph
[1:27:14] you come close my friend
[1:27:17] for if I be an offender
[1:27:20] or have committed anything worthy of
[1:27:22] death
[1:27:23] I refuse not to die
[1:27:26] but if there be none of these things
[1:27:28] whereof these accuse me
[1:27:32] no man
[1:27:33] May deliver me unto them I appeal unto
[1:27:37] Caesar
[1:27:38] he was Paul he stood up he knew that
[1:27:44] they didn't have anything they didn't
[1:27:45] have anything on him he didn't break any
[1:27:48] law
[1:27:49] and the Romans are like what's the deal
[1:27:51] with these so-called these Jews they
[1:27:54] hate each other and they want to kill
[1:27:56] somebody he didn't even break any law

[1:28:00] way that you brought that out I love the
[1:28:03] way the apostle
