[24:57] me read a
[25:00] scripture book of 1 John chapter
[25:05] 4 verse 7 it says
[25:08] this 1 John 47 it says
[25:12] beloved let us love one another for love
[25:15] is of God and everyone that loveth is
[25:19] born of God and knoweth God he that
[25:23] loveth
[25:24] not knoweth not God for God is love
[25:30] love in this was manifested the love of
[25:33] God toward us because that God sent his
[25:37] only begotten son into the world that we
[25:39] might live through him
[25:43] believe brother is also quoting John
[25:45] 3:16 there he wrote he wrote both of
[25:49] those herin is love not that we loved
[25:54] God but that he loved us and sent his
[25:58] son to be the perpetuation of our
[26:01] sins beloved if God so loved us we ought
[26:05] also to love one another no man hath
[26:08] seen God at any time if we love one
[26:11] another God dwelleth in us and his love
[26:15] is perfected in
[26:18] US hereby know that we that hereby
[26:24] hereby know we that we dwell in him and
[26:27] he in US because he hath given us of his
[26:30] spirit and we have seen and do testify
[26:34] that the father sent the son to be the
[26:36] savior of the world whosoever shall
[26:39] confess that Jesus is the son of God God
[26:41] dwelleth in him and he in God and we
[26:45] have known and
[26:48] believed the love that God hath to us
[26:52] God is love and he that dwelleth in love
[26:56] dwelleth in God and God in
[26:59] him amen wonderful
[27:03] words I want
[27:05] to say a few words
[27:08] tonight before we um we go into our our
[27:11] tape service I was
[27:14] outside before service
[27:16] and I uh I drove I drove by Stone and I
[27:20] took a left uh to come into the church
[27:23] and there was two uh two young people
[27:27] they were sitting on the on the wall
[27:29] over there
[27:31] and I uh so I pulled in and they were
[27:38] um sitting there on the wall talking and
[27:41] and I got out and and I told them I said
[27:43] hey this is this is private property and
[27:47] uh they're like oh okay and and they
[27:49] they get up and they they left they they
[27:53] um started to leave and brothers and
[27:55] sisters listen right there
[27:59] is the
[28:00] time that you have a decision to make
[28:04] and I had a decision to make am I going
[28:06] to just let them
[28:08] go or am I going to take an
[28:11] opportunity and talk about the Lord and
[28:14] worry about and and do something for
[28:16] these two Souls that were there one of
[28:20] them was a red-headed young man he had
[28:23] kind of long hair and he was 19 years
[28:26] old his name is Johnny the the other
[28:30] is um his name is Alex and he's 22 years
[28:35] old and he's what looks like a trans
[28:39] what we would call a trans um looks like
[28:43] he he was born a boy and and um he is
[28:47] taking looks like he's taking hormones I
[28:49] can't speak for him but he's he's making
[28:51] a some sort of a transition and so I
[28:55] said I said hey I said uh you guys live
[28:58] around here or what and so we we were
[29:01] standing um in the street and they're
[29:04] like well yeah you know we do and and I
[29:08] said I said so why why are you sitting
[29:10] here what what do you guys do and the
[29:13] one kid said he had a job doing this and
[29:15] the other kid says he says I am
[29:17] completely unemployed I don't do
[29:18] anything so I I said you know what come
[29:20] on over here let's come back and let's
[29:22] let's start talking about this and I I
[29:25] started talking to him on the sidewalk
[29:26] there and I said list listen I said you
[29:29] boys I said you're you you need to do
[29:31] something you need to make a living you
[29:33] need this is a pivotal time in your life
[29:36] we started talking and then I said you
[29:38] know what come on over here let's go sit
[29:40] down and I said do you have anything to
[29:42] do and they said no we're just you know
[29:44] we're just hanging out so I said let's
[29:46] let's sit here and we we sat there um on
[29:49] the short wall and I started talking to
[29:52] them about the
[29:54] Lord and I said I said do you do you all
[29:57] have any type of Rel relationship with
[29:59] God or anything like that and the one um
[30:04] Alex
[30:06] said and they're they're speaking in
[30:08] their in their vernacular of a young man
[30:10] that that they're not used to talking to
[30:12] a minister or someone that that that
[30:14] goes to church so so there was there was
[30:16] some what be would be perceived as
[30:18] disrespect but it wasn't disrespect it
[30:20] was just the way that they talk and uh
[30:22] and using the swear words and stuff and
[30:25] and the one young man said he says you
[30:28] know he says 'well if there is a
[30:31] God he said all the things that are
[30:34] going on right now he said something on
[30:37] the order of you know he he'd be really
[30:39] messed
[30:40] up and I said uh I said okay and then
[30:45] then the other one he um I don't
[30:47] remember what he
[30:49] said and I started talking to them about
[30:52] the Lord and I said I said well have you
[30:55] ever considered him have you ever
[30:57] thought about about if there is If there
[31:00] really is a true God and I said I said
[31:03] what you
[31:04] said I said that's because that's the
[31:08] way that you think and you have in your
[31:11] mind you have an image of what God
[31:13] should be and this is if you were God
[31:17] this is how you would be I said but God
[31:19] is different than you and he's different
[31:20] than me God has his way of doing things
[31:25] and I'll tell you God's way of doing
[31:27] things he does everything in one thing
[31:30] and it's in love and I quoted this
[31:33] scripture to him that I just
[31:35] read I said God knows the beginning from
[31:39] the end God knows what we have need of
[31:43] and the other young man the redheaded
[31:45] boy he started listening and he he
[31:47] started saying he he says yeah he says
[31:50] he says you know some people say that
[31:51] there's no God he says I'm agnostic and
[31:54] a very bright young man extremely
[31:56] intelligent you could just feel it just
[31:58] emanating from him the other one said
[32:00] yeah I'm an agnostic too and and he
[32:02] didn't I don't think he knew what
[32:03] agnostic meant but I said I asked them I
[32:06] said well what is
[32:07] agnostic and they were like well and I
[32:10] said basically you're not
[32:13] denying that there could be a God but
[32:17] there is just nothing in you that's
[32:18] seeking that God and they said yeah and
[32:21] especially the redheaded young man said
[32:24] that and I said I said listen I said
[32:27] when God God does
[32:29] things he does them for a purpose and I
[32:32] say you see all of the death and all of
[32:35] the suffering and and all of these
[32:37] problems that are in the in the world I
[32:39] said do you think maybe that they're for
[32:41] a
[32:42] purpose I said it's not because God
[32:45] wants someone to suffer but God sees the
[32:48] end and we're here right we're here
[32:51] right at the very beginning or in the
[32:53] middle but God sees the end and he wants
[32:56] salvation for his children he really
[32:58] cares for
[33:01] us and and the the one young man said
[33:04] said yeah and and he started
[33:07] talking and I said you know I said
[33:10] there's a there's a a scripture I said
[33:12] there is a prophet in the Bible I said a
[33:14] prophet is someone that speaks on behalf
[33:18] of God and I said this Prophet was named
[33:21] Isaiah and he addressed what you're
[33:23] saying he said God's ways are not your
[33:26] ways his thoughts are not your thoughts
[33:29] his ways are higher than our ways and
[33:31] his thoughts are higher than our
[33:33] thoughts he understands these things and
[33:35] he wants us to be successful in life to
[33:40] where at the end that we will have this
[33:42] eternal
[33:44] blessing and then the the one young man
[33:46] he starts talking about he says you know
[33:48] he says churches Don't Preach about
[33:54] demons and I saidwell I said I said they
[33:57] do I said some of them do I said they're
[33:59] definitely in the Bible and he says
[34:00] that's right he says they're real and I
[34:03] said you know what these demons do they
[34:06] influence and I said there's demons on
[34:09] this side and there's angels on this
[34:12] side and both of them are influencing
[34:15] and I said the angels are influencing
[34:18] people to love to
[34:21] selflessness to giving to helping to
[34:26] sacrifice I said that that is what the
[34:28] angels are are influencing people to and
[34:30] I said the demons are influencing people
[34:33] to
[34:35] self-righteousness to
[34:37] selfishness to serving themselves more
[34:40] than serving someone else to hatred to
[34:45] vitriol I said that's what they are
[34:47] influencing us to and that and the other
[34:49] is what God's angels are influencing us
[34:52] to and I said and they are influencing
[34:55] us I said you know what they're
[34:56] influencing us right now
[34:59] in this
[35:01] Courtyard and then and I and I started
[35:04] conversing with the young W with both of
[35:07] them and and talking with them and and
[35:09] the one young man he was like this is
[35:12] this is amazing and I told him a story
[35:14] about Daniel and how Daniel was got down
[35:18] and he he started praying and he and
[35:20] fasting he said Lord I've had this
[35:21] experience I need to know what it
[35:23] means I this is this is vital to me and
[35:27] then 21 days
[35:30] later an angel came to Daniel and he
[35:34] tells him this he says that Daniel from
[35:37] the moment you started
[35:39] praying 21 three weeks ago God sent me
[35:43] he dispatched me to come to you and to
[35:45] give you
[35:46] understanding he said but when I was on
[35:49] the road he said I met a
[35:52] demon this Prince of
[35:55] Persia and he says I've been fighting
[35:57] with him all this time and he says I
[35:59] needed help and then this other angel
[36:01] came down this Prince Michael and he
[36:04] helped me and I said explain that and
[36:08] these boys were locked on now like
[36:10] really yes that's what the Bible is full
[36:14] of and and this Angel gets to Daniel and
[36:17] he gives him this understanding and I
[36:19] said do you think those angels are here
[36:21] with us today they said yeah and I and I
[36:23] tried to explain to them that these that
[36:25] God loves us these things are
[36:28] important
[36:30] and it's you know what it's stuck I
[36:34] could feel it brother
[36:36] Joe in the young man named Johnny I
[36:38] could feel he was his his he started
[36:43] quivering when he was talking he started
[36:45] he started to getting
[36:46] excited and I said that's what it's
[36:48] about and I said that's what a church is
[36:51] about a church is about serving other
[36:53] people and and trying to get people to
[36:56] the Lord and I told them the story I
[36:58] said you know you've heard about Sin and
[36:59] all this and I looked at the young man
[37:01] and I said I said I said brother I said
[37:04] you're wrong in what you're
[37:06] doing you're wrong in this this sexual
[37:10] deviation that that is that you're going
[37:12] towards in your
[37:14] life I said
[37:17] but also I said you have a weakness
[37:20] there I said but other people have a
[37:23] weakness for
[37:24] lying other people have a weakness for
[37:26] stealing other people have a weakness
[37:28] for gossiping I said it's all being
[37:31] influenced by the enemy and I said you
[37:33] know what there's going to be some
[37:35] people that
[37:36] overcome these things and I said why do
[37:39] you think that God allowed you to have
[37:42] this
[37:44] weakness and he says he says well you
[37:47] know I was born this way and I said yeah
[37:49] I'm sure you were born that way I said
[37:52] some people are born
[37:54] Liars some people are born cheaters
[37:59] but they overcome those things and I
[38:02] said you can overcome
[38:05] this and he
[38:07] said he he said well basically he didn't
[38:11] want to it's
[38:13] fine it's not fine it's
[38:16] sin and if there's no condemnation for
[38:19] sin in us then there's there's a lot
[38:21] worse problems there than than being a a
[38:25] sexual
[38:26] deviant but
[38:28] now if there is something in us that
[38:30] wants to change that wants to get better
[38:33] I said do you think maybe that God
[38:35] allowed you to have this weakness or I
[38:38] looked at the other young man or you
[38:39] have your weaknesses or me have my
[38:41] weaknesses that God allowed us to have
[38:44] these weaknesses so that we would build
[38:47] character and that we could be able to
[38:49] overcome and make it on the other side
[38:53] through the salvation of Jesus Christ
[38:56] and I said it's twofold old
[38:58] brother I said that you can overcome I
[39:02] said but why
[39:05] overcome am I famous that I always say
[39:09] because it's not about
[39:11] you maybe you can help someone else who
[39:15] has the same
[39:17] weakness if you overcome these
[39:22] weaknesses then you can say Hey Brother
[39:24] listen I used to be like that here here
[39:27] how I overcame
[39:29] it I used to be this I used to suffer
[39:33] with this perversion or I used to be a
[39:35] liar or I used to be a a cheater a thief
[39:38] or a drug addict and I overcame it now
[39:42] you can overcome it if I can do it you
[39:44] can do
[39:45] it explaining to him how you can help
[39:48] someone
[39:51] else we had a great conversation and and
[39:55] and I said oh you know we've been here
[39:57] long and I said I said I'm sorry for
[39:58] taking your time and the one kid was
[40:00] like no no no no he goes I'm really
[40:02] liking
[40:04] this all right I'll keep
[40:07] going so we
[40:09] continued talking about
[40:13] these
[40:15] different perspectives of the Lord and I
[40:19] said let me tell you I said when Jesus
[40:24] came I said you know why he was hated
[40:27] hated so
[40:28] much he was hated so much because he
[40:31] hung out with
[40:33] Sinners I said it's all over the Bible
[40:36] it's all over the New Testament you
[40:37] can't deny it he was hated and they said
[40:41] you the reason we hate you is because
[40:42] you're hanging around with prostitutes
[40:43] and sinners Tax
[40:47] Collectors it's in the Bible you can't
[40:49] deny it it's not my Doctrine it's
[40:52] Jesus's Doctrine or John or Matthew or
[40:54] Mark or
[40:55] Luke it's their
[40:57] doctrines so I said and I tell them the
[41:01] story of there was a woman that was
[41:05] caught in adultery in the very Act of
[41:07] adultery with a married man and Moses's
[41:11] law which was the Bible Moses's law was
[41:14] that these people would be put to death
[41:18] by stoning I said it was written in the
[41:20] Bible that's what the punishment
[41:24] was so
[41:27] they were into this and I said so there
[41:31] was a bunch of
[41:35] preachers they came
[41:37] up and they're like oh here's the new
[41:40] Young
[41:41] Rabbi and he always takes the side of
[41:44] the
[41:45] Sinners so we're going to trap
[41:48] him so they look at Jesus they knew that
[41:50] he had a heart for for all of the
[41:52] Sinners and they
[41:53] said this woman was caught in the very
[41:56] Act of adulter they knew the
[41:59] Bible they knew that this word commanded
[42:03] that they would be they would be killed
[42:06] by
[42:09] stoning so they said what should we do
[42:14] and I said you know what Jesus
[42:16] did and and the one boy when I said that
[42:19] he stood
[42:20] up and he was like what he got excited
[42:26] he said what what did they do what did
[42:28] he do and I said he knelt
[42:31] down and I said he just drew in the sand
[42:36] and he left all of these preachers there
[42:38] looking at him and he made him
[42:41] wait Drew in the
[42:44] sand and then he stood up and when I
[42:46] stood up they both kind of went back
[42:48] like
[42:49] that and he said
[42:52] you that is without
[42:54] sin cast the first stone the other boy
[42:57] said hey I know that
[43:00] story and I said you know what
[43:04] happened the older and wiser they
[43:07] started dropping their Stones because
[43:09] they knew they had sin in their lives
[43:12] all the way
[43:15] down dropping their stones and they all
[43:18] walked away and I said you know what he
[43:19] said he looked down at the
[43:22] lady and he said where are your accusers
[43:27] and she looked around they're all
[43:32] gone and I said this is so Jesus this is
[43:36] so Jesus he says neither I do I accuse
[43:40] you he said but
[43:43] go and sin no
[43:47] more and I
[43:49] said guys I said it's important that you
[43:52] live right and then he the the the one
[43:55] young man he's like man he goes I want
[43:57] to I want to like a I want to go to a
[43:59] philosophical do you have any like like
[44:01] philosophy classes that you teach here
[44:03] in the in the church and I said you know
[44:05] I said some of the young people have
[44:06] been
[44:07] asking for to do that I said maybe we'll
[44:10] start doing
[44:11] it and and they were they were just they
[44:15] were excited the one was really
[44:18] excited and so I went back and and uh I
[44:24] walk in and I see sister Shirley's there
[44:26] and she's praying and only one in the
[44:29] church
[44:31] and I just said

[44:40] below that young man that was a
[44:43] transsexual that doesn't know if he's a
[44:44] boy or a girl no better than him I see
[44:48] these these people walking out down the
[44:50] street and and strung out on drugs and

[46:12] tonight we're going to listen to this
[46:15] this
[46:16] sermon on
[46:18] Hebrews and let me tell you let me tell
[46:21] you a man that was
[46:24] low that was the lowest of the low
[46:27] is the man that's going to be preaching
[46:30] tonight I was I met a man named Don
[46:35] Weber um do you for the people that
[46:38] listen to tapes did you ever hear
[46:40] Brother brandom's story of when they
[46:42] couldn't make ends meet at the
[46:44] church and there was a little lady in
[46:48] the front and they'd always they'd
[46:49] always Pass the
[46:50] Plate but brother brandom came out and
[46:54] he said because they wouldn't get enough
[46:55] money
[46:57] and I was actually able to to look at
[46:59] the records of the church in that time
[47:02] they would get like 90 cents in an
[47:05] offering I was telling somebody the
[47:07] other day you know how much that is
[47:08] today it's like 30
[47:12] bucks how could we run a church on $30 a
[47:15] week you can't but that's about how much
[47:18] they were getting brother brandom they
[47:20] couldn't they had to pay the electric
[47:21] bill and and they couldn't they couldn't
[47:23] do it so he said you know what I'm going
[47:24] to take the offering back then there
[47:27] wasn't a lot of people at the
[47:28] Tabernacle so he goes
[47:31] out
[47:32] and he says okay we're going to take an
[47:36] offering we need this help and there was
[47:37] a little old lady in the front and she
[47:40] pulled out her little purse and opened
[47:42] it up and he just couldn't do it he said
[47:44] I was just kidding I was just kidding
[47:47] we're not going to do that that lady's
[47:49] name was Sister
[47:51] Weber I met her son he's about 90 years
[47:55] old when I met him he was was there he
[47:58] was a young boy when they were laying
[48:00] the Cornerstone for the brandom
[48:03] Tabernacle at eth and Pinn Street in
[48:05] Jeffersonville and he said that they had
[48:08] two big wagons and they had the big
[48:10] trusses that they were bringing down the
[48:13] street to to put it up and he told me
[48:15] who loaned brother brandom the money he
[48:17] told he he had just wonderful
[48:19] information about all of this history
[48:22] and he says there was nobody very few
[48:24] people in church for for years and years
[48:27] and years and this Don Weber he says you
[48:29] know he says I want you to talk to my
[48:31] sister who was there too so and neither
[48:35] of them were were message Believers like
[48:38] we would call message Believers and I so
[48:41] I met this his sister I can't remember
[48:43] her
[48:45] name and I sat down with her in her
[48:48] house sweet
[48:49] lady and she says she tells me this she
[48:54] says you know she says
[48:58] you probably don't know it but them
[48:59] brandom's were
[49:03] Drinkers and I said no I actually knew
[49:06] that and she said now we went to school
[49:10] she says I went to school with
[49:13] Billy and she says this was The
[49:16] Depression she says everyone was
[49:19] poor she said but those brandom boys she
[49:23] said they were poor
[49:27] poor they were the poorest of the poor
[49:31] she says I remember them and the clothes
[49:33] that they would wear and she said that
[49:36] they would make make fun of them now
[49:39] this is a woman that went to
[49:41] school with this family and she
[49:44] remembered how destitute these people
[49:49] were it shows you the character that was
[49:52] built in that man and how he grew up and
[49:57] why how God could put him through those
[50:00] things and how he could do so much for
[50:03] so many people is because he went
[50:06] through
[50:07] it it was hard and he came out the other
[50:11] side of with a as a man of great great
[50:18] character
[50:20] thinking on those things
[50:23] and and brothers and sisters like I said
[50:28] I feel
[50:31] like I'm nothing compared to what these
[50:35] people could be brother Paul and I have
[50:38] been talking before about how we'd we'd
[50:40] like to witness to some of these
[50:42] homeless people and TR and try to
[50:44] encourage them to get on the right track
[50:47] the
[50:48] problem is the same problem with with
[50:51] the others they don't want to that that
[50:53] something else is more important it's
[50:55] usually drugs
[50:57] but if we could just present Jesus
[50:59] Christ to these people if we could just
[51:03] say here is what Jesus is today and you
[51:06] know what it is it's that scripture I
[51:08] just read God is
[51:12] love they would know that these people
[51:14] showed me
[51:16] love that these people made me feel
[51:20] important and that's what the
[51:23] man that we're going to hear tonight
[51:27] and preaching on this book of
[51:31] Hebrews he came from the worst he came
[51:33] from the lowest of the low he's a good
[51:37] man he knew how it
[51:40] was not to have any money he knew how it
[51:43] was not to have
[51:44] shoes he knew how it was not to even
[51:47] have a
[51:49] shirt he had to go to school he was
[51:52] embarrassed he didn't have a shirt so he
[51:53] wore a jacket wore a
[51:55] coat and and and it was too
[51:59] warm the teacher made him
[52:01] sit as you know the story by the stove
[52:04] by the wood burning
[52:05] stove because he was wearing his coat
[52:08] and he he told the teacher he's cold he
[52:09] was embarrassed that he didn't have
[52:10] anything on underneath
[52:13] it Jesus Christ said he said the foxes
[52:17] have
[52:19] dens no he said he said birds have
[52:22] trees he said they have homes these
[52:24] animals have homes but I don't even have
[52:27] a home I don't even have a place to
[52:29] sleep tonight Jesus knew how it
[52:33] was and brothers and sisters we need to
[52:37] always remember those people that don't
[52:40] have as much as we do and put them as
[52:45] more important as you are make them more
[52:49] important because they need
[52:53] it brother brandham
[52:55] did I've often
[52:58] said I used to write an article for the
[53:01] magazine that we did and I would drive I
[53:03] would ride my bike around and I talk to
[53:05] I talk to these these old people sitting
[53:07] on their porch and and I'd ask them if
[53:10] they knew William brandom almost all of
[53:12] them did and almost and all of them
[53:14] without exception with no exceptions not
[53:17] one exception and I talked to I'd say
[53:19] probably a hundred people not one
[53:22] exception no one said a bad word word
[53:26] about him no one had a bad experience
[53:30] with the man William brandom they say a
[53:32] lot about him now because he's
[53:35] gone but the ones that met him loved him
[53:39] without exception and I can say I am a
[53:42] witness to
[53:44] that I they all thought he made everyone
[53:48] feel so good he made them feel like they
[53:51] were special I'm brothers and sisters

[55:49] purpose of gathering here is for that
[55:51] purpose and now and to pray for God's
[55:54] sick children and this morning we had a
[55:58] a wonderful blessing from the scriptures
[56:01] we are trying to take each time of the
[56:04] service a part of I'm teaching in the
[56:08] book of Hebrews have been for the last
[56:09] couple weeks now and now if the Lord
[56:12] willing will continue on Wednesday night
[56:15] then on Sunday morning and Sunday night
[56:17] on for as long as I'm to be here in this
[56:21] time not a Revival but it's Revival a
[56:24] meeting on our regular nights amen and
[56:26] so we're very very happy to have this
[56:29] time to meet with our good friends
[56:31] around about in the cities and around
[56:34] about the fall cities here and if um if
[56:37] we happen to have a cancellation or
[56:39] something it might be that the Lord
[56:41] might lead us pretty soon to maybe we
[56:44] could have a few nights maybe in the gym
[56:47] or something after a while if the Lord
[56:48] seems to lead that way to a place where
[56:50] we could get our people together and
[56:53] we've seen people as it's coming up
[56:55] going back saying there was not room to
[56:58] to come in of course the Tabernacle is
[56:59] awful little it just seats a very very
[57:02] few people and we
[57:04] are uh just so glad that you're willing
[57:07] to come out and set in the heat uh to
[57:09] hear the word of the Lord and we're
[57:12] praying that God will exceedingly
[57:14] abundantly bless you and to help you and
[57:18] now tonight we want we're beginning on
[57:21] the fourth chap how many we here this
[57:24] morning let's see your hands oh that's
[57:25] wonderful practically all of you and we
[57:28] are on beginning on the fourth chapter
[57:31] of the book of Hebrews oh what a
[57:35] marvelous book are you enjoying it and
[57:38] it's comparing scripture by
[57:42] scripture and Paul before he would ever
[57:46] witness to his
[57:47] experience he first had to go down to
[57:50] Arabia and find out by the word if it
[57:53] was the truth I like that
[57:56] and this morning's lesson we found out
[57:59] in the teaching this morning that Christ
[58:03] was the same yesterday today and forever
[58:05] and Paul found that the same Pillar of
[58:10] Fire that led the children of Israel had
[58:13] met him on the road to
[58:16] Damascus we found out that the pillar of
[58:19] fire that led the children of Israel out
[58:23] of the Wilderness to the promised land
[58:26] met Paul on the road to Damascus and
[58:29] called himself Jesus amen then we find
[58:33] out the real Supreme deity of Jesus
[58:37] Christ the whole book here is just a
[58:40] revelation of Jesus
[58:42] Christ and he come we find it in Sun
[58:45] Times and in diverse manners God spoke
[58:49] to the fathers through the prophets in
[58:52] this last days through his son Christ
[58:55] Jesus he's revealed
[58:56] himself and the book from Genesis to
[59:00] Revelations is nothing but one constant
[59:04] Perpetual revelation of the Lord
[59:08] Jesus and we find out that he was the
[59:11] one that was in the burning
[59:14] bush we find out that he was the one
[59:17] that was with God before the foundation
[59:19] of the
[59:21] world and we find out that in the New
[59:23] Testament he was God in man together
[59:27] amen and then when he left the New
[59:29] Testament to go into heaven he said I
[59:32] came from God and I returned to God and
[59:36] then when Paul met him he was in the
[59:39] same form that he was when he led Israel
[59:43] a pillar of fire and Paul looked him
[59:45] right into the face being
[59:49] unconverted and it caused him to have
[59:52] eye trouble the rest of his days he went
[59:55] blind
[59:56] and for several days he could not see
[59:58] nothing at all he had to be led to a
[1:00:01] street called straight and God had a
[1:00:04] prophet down there that he spoke to by
[1:00:06] the name of ananas who came in by a
[1:00:09] vision and laid his hands on Paul and
[1:00:12] said brother Saul receive thy
[1:00:15] sight and we find out then that that
[1:00:19] same holy spirit that same Lord Jesus
[1:00:23] came to Peter in the farm of a
[1:00:27] light and delivered him out of the
[1:00:30] prison and we find that that same Lord
[1:00:34] Jesus and these days is still in that
[1:00:38] Pillar of Fire Light that's leading his
[1:00:42] people his
[1:00:43] church performing the same thing giving
[1:00:46] Visions come in and lay hands on the
[1:00:48] People by a vision the Lord Jesus who
[1:00:51] met last Sunday
[1:00:54] morning at the house and said there was
[1:00:56] a man coming blackheaded graying he was
[1:00:59] a Greek his wife was middle-aged and
[1:01:03] would be Weeping at the altar some of
[1:01:05] them had told it and know it was
[1:01:06] happening he was both crippled the the
[1:01:10] banel nerve in his head was gone he
[1:01:12] couldn't even have control of his feet
[1:01:14] or his Limbs and he was
[1:01:17] blind and to make it double prooof I had
[1:01:21] a little lady to come pray for the sick
[1:01:23] first then turned back around and had
[1:01:25] brother Thomas to come pray and we
[1:01:27] sitting here watching it develop and
[1:01:30] then I went out and prayed for the sick
[1:01:31] and walked back and she come just
[1:01:33] exactly according to the vision and
[1:01:35] caught me by the arm and began weeping
[1:01:37] and said Dr aaman had sent them here Dr
[1:01:40] aaman is the bosom friend of mine
[1:01:42] Catholic his boy is a priest at the
[1:01:44] monastery at
[1:01:46] um at St Miner and down Indiana this man
[1:01:51] was from Jasper and the Lord healed him
[1:01:55] out of that church got up and walked and
[1:01:57] could see as good as anybody else and
[1:01:59] walked out of the building nor and ho
[1:02:01] all by a vision brother Saul the Lord
[1:02:07] Jesus that appeared to you in the way
[1:02:11] has sent me that I might lay my hands on
[1:02:14] you that you might receive your sight
[1:02:16] and be filled with the Holy Ghost amen
[1:02:19] wonderful praise the Lord then we find
[1:02:22] out seeing that we have this great
[1:02:24] salvation we should not we could not
[1:02:27] escape the penalties and wrath of God if
[1:02:29] we neglect such a great salvation now
[1:02:33] we're going to start reading tonight out
[1:02:36] and begin the fourth
[1:02:38] chapter of the book of Hebrews if
[1:02:40] anybody wants to follow along we got
[1:02:42] some Bibles here if they want one while
[1:02:45] one of the ushers will bring it to you
[1:02:46] hold up your hand these these bibles if
[1:02:48] one of the Brethren here will uh take
[1:02:51] there's two Bibles Ling there I believe
[1:02:54] and um and and now we'll hurry because
[1:02:57] we have communion after a bit and where
[1:02:59] we get done tonight Wednesday night we
[1:03:02] begin again
[1:03:04] now I believe this morning in our
[1:03:07] reading we begin on the 15th verse
[1:03:11] somebody maybe not know me putting on
[1:03:13] glasses to read by I'm getting
[1:03:17] old and I can still read but I can't
[1:03:20] pick it fast especially when I'm got
[1:03:22] fine reading here fine print and I went
[1:03:25] to have my eyes examined to see if I was
[1:03:28] really losing my sight my eyes were 10
[1:03:30] 10 he said but you're past 40 son you
[1:03:34] had a thing for me to read says start
[1:03:35] reading I read it and I kept getting
[1:03:37] closer it got slower and slower and it
[1:03:39] got about like this I
[1:03:41] stopped then he put out there for 10 10
[1:03:43] I could read it anywhere but he said
[1:03:45] what it is when you pass 40 your
[1:03:48] eyeballs get flat now I can squint my
[1:03:51] eyes and read just that post to me but
[1:03:54] you have to squint so he just made me a
[1:03:56] pair of of glasses I can see it anywhere
[1:03:59] when it's real close to me now when it
[1:04:01] gets all from me can't see it all with
[1:04:03] these things but I read them uh read
[1:04:06] from this with the glasses now this
[1:04:08] morning we had the last part of the
[1:04:12] third chapter of the
[1:04:15] Hebrews and oh what Rich Colonels we
[1:04:19] find I listen I want to read again so we
[1:04:21] get a background now not talk on it but
[1:04:24] just kind of go go over it a little
[1:04:27] while it is said today if you hear his
[1:04:30] voice Harden not your hearts as in the
[1:04:35] provocation for some then they heard the
[1:04:40] word when they had heard the word did
[1:04:43] provoke how be it not all that came out
[1:04:46] of Egypt by Moses I end that this
[1:04:50] morning we find that he said don't
[1:04:52] Harden your heart
[1:04:54] now as in the days of provocation that's
[1:04:58] when they provoke God to anger because
[1:05:02] that he had give to them Moses his
[1:05:06] prophet and a sign that was with Moses
[1:05:10] how many of the class tonight knows what
[1:05:12] that sign was Pillar of Fire Hebrews 13
[1:05:17] now we don't know whether the
[1:05:18] congregation saw that sign or not but
[1:05:21] Moses saw it for Moses first met him in
[1:05:25] in a burning
[1:05:27] bush he was a
[1:05:29] fire and the children of Israel obeyed
[1:05:33] Moses and left
[1:05:35] Egypt and as soon as they come out of
[1:05:38] Egypt God we found LED them right into a
[1:05:42] trap where Pharaoh's Army behind them
[1:05:46] the Red Sea on either
[1:05:48] side and God put them to test and they
[1:05:51] got
[1:05:52] scared and it provoked God
[1:05:56] he said why do you cry at
[1:05:58] me said just speak and go forward amen I
[1:06:02] like that now they were following Moses
[1:06:06] as Moses followed the pillar and cloud
[1:06:09] and they were on their way to the
[1:06:13] promised land beautiful picture of the
[1:06:16] church tonight on our way to the
[1:06:20] promised land led by The Same Spirit
[1:06:25] same signs and wonders as God spoke of
[1:06:30] now notice then they come to the
[1:06:33] Wilderness of sin the W the waters were
[1:06:37] bitter
[1:06:38] M why did God lead him to Bitter Waters
[1:06:42] looks like he'll led him to good water
[1:06:45] but he led them to Bitter Water so he
[1:06:47] could prove their
[1:06:50] faith he likes to do it amen he likes to
[1:06:55] let tribulation come on you so he can
[1:06:59] show you his love and his
[1:07:02] power how can people today who doesn't
[1:07:05] believe in the miracle working of God
[1:07:07] when tribulations come they just give up
[1:07:10] and go on but we believe that God works
[1:07:14] miracles amen he can't God has listen to
[1:07:20] this if God doesn't act the same when
[1:07:25] the the same circumstances arise than
[1:07:29] God's guilty of being partial to his
[1:07:31] people
[1:07:33] amen God's
[1:07:36] sovereignty demands of him to work in
[1:07:40] every case like he did the first case or
[1:07:43] he was wrong when he worked in the first
[1:07:45] case amen if God does not act in the
[1:07:49] same way he did on the first case if
[1:07:52] he'll act different to the second case
[1:07:55] that he acted wrong when he acted on the
[1:07:57] first
[1:07:59] case if God healed was sick in the Old
[1:08:01] Testament he's got to do it in the New
[1:08:03] Testament and today or he did wrong when
[1:08:05] he healed him back
[1:08:06] there he's got to act the same every
[1:08:11] time and he will do it when the same
[1:08:15] Faith meets a
[1:08:17] condition the faults in us not in God
[1:08:21] for we see him on some and many work
[1:08:25] great outstanding
[1:08:27] Miracles we know it the critic cannot
[1:08:30] say it's not so for we see it prove
[1:08:34] it there it is they used to say show me
[1:08:38] a miracle they can't say that no more
[1:08:42] science can't say it no more we can
[1:08:45] absolutely prove to the scientific world
[1:08:47] and the scientific world has witness
[1:08:51] that a supernatural being in a form of a
[1:08:54] pillar of Fire
[1:08:56] is with us here's this picture right
[1:08:59] here and one hangs in Washington DC
[1:09:03] tonight it is the same Christ therefore
[1:09:07] is a while my ministering brother used
[1:09:10] to tell me oh brother BR that's the
[1:09:11] devil don't you fool with that have me
[1:09:14] scared and I would not preach it until
[1:09:18] God came and revealed it that he's the
[1:09:22] same
[1:09:23] Jesus the same one
[1:09:26] oh then try to shake it out of me can't
[1:09:30] be done for it's the scripture it's
[1:09:34] God's word it's not just an experience
[1:09:37] that's loose it's an experience that's
[1:09:40] backed up by God's word and God's
[1:09:43] Eternal blessed promise Hallelujah now
[1:09:47] we notice over here then that he said
[1:09:51] for some when they had heard did provoke
[1:09:55] certainly they got weary every time they
[1:09:58] get to a place where a showdown
[1:10:01] come then what would they do they would
[1:10:04] fly loose and get weary and want to turn
[1:10:06] back and why did this happen to me
[1:10:09] strange thing this morning after
[1:10:11] preaching that just as hard as I could
[1:10:14] there was many came to the alter and
[1:10:16] questioning why does this happen to me
[1:10:19] you see how it go it goes over the top
[1:10:22] of the people's
[1:10:23] head help it's it's just the same people
[1:10:28] Jesus said you have eyes but you can't
[1:10:30] see he said that to the disciples they
[1:10:33] said Lo now thou speakest plainly now we
[1:10:36] believe no man has to tell you anything
[1:10:38] because God shows it he said do you now
[1:10:42] believe after all this time see you
[1:10:46] mustn't question anything to God amise
[1:10:51] God for the footsteps of the righteous
[1:10:53] is ordered out of the law
[1:10:56] and every trial is put up on you to
[1:10:59] prove you and the Bible said there're
[1:11:02] more precious to you than gold
[1:11:06] amen so if God let a few light
[1:11:08] afflictions happen to you remember it's
[1:11:11] far the correction of you amen every son
[1:11:14] that cometh to God must first be
[1:11:17] chastened of God and tried amen help us
[1:11:20] Lord child trained there's no exceptions
[1:11:24] every son that
[1:11:26] cometh these afflictions are done
[1:11:29] brought about to see what attitude
[1:11:31] you'll take amen see it's God on this
[1:11:36] Proving Ground that's all Earth is is
[1:11:39] The Proving Ground amen and where he's
[1:11:41] trying to prove you now listen as we go
[1:11:44] ahead and I want to get the last part of
[1:11:46] this and to whom he swear that they
[1:11:49] should not enter into his rest now
[1:11:51] that's where we're coming to tonight
[1:11:53] into his rest but to them that believe
[1:11:57] not so we see that they could not enter
[1:12:01] because of
[1:12:03] unbelief now what is
[1:12:06] sin
[1:12:08] unbelief God had come to him in a pillar
[1:12:10] of fire sent his prophet and anointed
[1:12:14] him give him signs to do before the
[1:12:17] people and then the pillar of Fire by
[1:12:21] the prophet LED them out every
[1:12:23] circumstance they come to they begin to
[1:12:25] murmur and say every little fault they
[1:12:26] found with Moses begin to chat and
[1:12:29] chatter against him and God was
[1:12:32] displeased because he said they were
[1:12:34] sinning
[1:12:35] amen they should have
[1:12:38] listened but instead of that they
[1:12:40] listened to
[1:12:41] reason how can it be how can these
[1:12:44] things be if he's got everything is
[1:12:48] possible and he'll make all things work
[1:12:51] together for good to them that love him
[1:12:54] now we're going into a great study here
[1:12:59] that is on the rest the Sabbath amen now
[1:13:04] they were pilgrims in their
[1:13:07] Journey see they had been down in Egypt
[1:13:09] 400 years and in bondage and now they
[1:13:12] were being brought out by The Miracles
[1:13:15] of God according to his promise and they
[1:13:19] were on the road to the promised land
[1:13:22] and here a supernatural light appears in
[1:13:24] amongst them
[1:13:25] and begins to lead them now some of them
[1:13:28] would say now look at here who is this
[1:13:31] Moses who made you a ruler overs aren't
[1:13:35] you one of us who put you down here to
[1:13:38] be our boss you think you know more than
[1:13:41] our pastor does you think you know more
[1:13:43] than the priest does you think you're
[1:13:47] you're smarter than what our religious
[1:13:49] man are this day that had nothing to do
[1:13:52] with it it was God Amen in the pillar of
[1:13:56] fire of
[1:13:58] vindicating that he was in the move
[1:14:01] didn't make any who was smart who wasn't
[1:14:03] smart it was the idea of following what
[1:14:07] God put before
[1:14:10] them well Moses as far as physical done
[1:14:14] a foolish thing when he tried to deliver
[1:14:16] the children by the word of God taking a
[1:14:19] bunch of people out in the wilderness
[1:14:20] when he had his well he was an heir to
[1:14:22] everything to had he had every Army
[1:14:25] there was and all the world whipped and
[1:14:28] there he was a great military General
[1:14:32] and the next movie is to be king pharaoh
[1:14:34] of Egypt why he could just have stepped
[1:14:36] up to the throne and said all right
[1:14:38] children go on back to your home that
[1:14:39] settles it he was a
[1:14:42] pharaoh but Moses oh here it is Moses by
[1:14:50] faith saw the promise of God and the
[1:14:54] angel of the the Lord come to himen and
[1:14:57] he know more about God in five minutes
[1:15:00] in the presence of that angel and he
[1:15:01] learned in 40 years with the teachers of
[1:15:04] Egypt he know that he
[1:15:08] was he seen the supernatural down he
[1:15:11] said I'll be with you Moses I'll go
[1:15:14] before you and they understood and he
[1:15:17] give him signs to perform now they were
[1:15:21] on their road to the land of rest
[1:15:26] rest God had them a
[1:15:30] rest a place where they wouldn't have to
[1:15:32] be
[1:15:34] test Masters over them to drive them to
[1:15:38] make them do things what a beautiful
[1:15:41] picture it is
[1:15:42] today when we look at the
[1:15:45] church and see the church in its
[1:15:49] condition every man that's born to the
[1:15:51] spirit of God despises the world
[1:15:56] J if you love the world are the things
[1:15:59] of the world the love of God's not even
[1:16:01] in you that's what the Bible said and
[1:16:04] the real Pilgrim on his Road simply
[1:16:10] hates the things of the
[1:16:12] world he hates to see man drinking he
[1:16:16] hates to see man smoking he hates to see
[1:16:18] women on the street with them little
[1:16:20] little dirty clothes on he hates to see
[1:16:23] bunk clothes and card parties and
[1:16:26] yesterday while brother Tony or brother
[1:16:28] woods and I were coming through the
[1:16:31] street and some more some of the man
[1:16:33] there was a little lady there in
[1:16:35] Louisville coming down the street lovely
[1:16:36] looking little
[1:16:38] woman with a clothes on that was
[1:16:41] horrible just a little way up on the hip
[1:16:44] and a little ribbon tied on her hips on
[1:16:47] each side and a little bitty round piece
[1:16:50] of cloth in front of her and tied with a
[1:16:52] string behind walking down the street
[1:16:54] horribly
[1:16:55] and every man on the street looking at
[1:16:58] her I said she doesn't
[1:17:01] realize that she's guilty in the sight
[1:17:05] of God with committing adultery with
[1:17:08] every man that looked on her in that
[1:17:10] manner and she'll answer at the day of
[1:17:13] judgment for committing adultery with
[1:17:14] those men Jesus said whosoever look at
[1:17:17] TH old woman to lust after her has
[1:17:19] committed adultery with her already amen
[1:17:22] that's right so you see
[1:17:25] brother wood said to me what do you
[1:17:27] allow for that brother Bram I said it's
[1:17:29] either mental deficiency or devil
[1:17:33] possession amen there's only two things
[1:17:36] to make it a decent clean woman won't
[1:17:39] wear those things unless she's devil
[1:17:43] possessed it's exactly the truth now a
[1:17:46] pilgrim that's on his road to Heaven he
[1:17:49] lives in a different atmosphere you
[1:17:52] don't have to worry about him looking at
[1:17:53] her he'll turn in his head if he's got
[1:17:56] God in his heart for he's living in an
[1:18:00] atmosphere that's a million miles from
[1:18:03] those things that's right you don't want
[1:18:06] to be guilty of that stuff at the
[1:18:08] Judgment so he turns his head and think
[1:18:11] God have mercy on the woman and on he
[1:18:14] goes we're in our
[1:18:17] journey we're on our way to canaan's
[1:18:20] land we're on our way to that Eternal
[1:18:24] and bless for
[1:18:25] rest that God has given us and in the
[1:18:29] journey we are tempted we are tempted of
[1:18:32] all kinds of things but yet be tempted
[1:18:35] without sinning now notice as we go to
[1:18:39] the fourth chapter let us therefore
[1:18:43] fear let us therefore fear L the promise
[1:18:46] being left us to enter into his rest I
[1:18:49] want you to remember that unless we find
[1:18:53] out
[1:18:55] unless God has revealed it to us no
[1:18:58] matter how much we go to church that has
[1:19:00] nothing to do with it God must come by
[1:19:04] Revelation and reveal himself to us that
[1:19:07] takes all the things of the world out
[1:19:12] now while it is said today if you now
[1:19:15] let's start the the fourth chapter let
[1:19:18] us there fear lest a promise being left
[1:19:23] us to enter into
[1:19:25] his
[1:19:27] rest I remember when they were on the
[1:19:30] road to rest the pillar far LED them now
[1:19:34] we want to find out what is this rest
[1:19:38] let us fear lest the promise being left
[1:19:41] us to enter into his rest
[1:19:49] watch any of you should seem to come
[1:19:53] short of it
[1:19:56] now here's the promise here's what we
[1:19:59] got to fear if there's not a promise
[1:20:01] left us but there is a promise and then
[1:20:03] the next thing don't come short of it
[1:20:07] amen now the thought is if we are on our
[1:20:11] way to the rest what is the
[1:20:15] rest where is
[1:20:17] it is it joining
[1:20:20] church is it being uh baptized a certain
[1:20:24] way
[1:20:26] is it becoming a member of the greatest
[1:20:28] Church in the city wearing better
[1:20:30] clothes is it education is it money so
[1:20:34] we can get work just lay down rest the
[1:20:37] rest of her life as we call it that's
[1:20:39] not it listen what the Bible says it is
[1:20:42] and how we get it let us therefore fear
[1:20:44] less a promise being left us to enter
[1:20:46] into his rest any of you should seem to
[1:20:48] come short of it for unto
[1:20:51] us the day then the gospel was was
[1:20:54] preached as well as unto them what is
[1:20:57] the gospel the good
[1:20:59] news the good news came to them in Egypt
[1:21:02] that God has sent a deliverer and it's
[1:21:04] going to bring us out and take us to the
[1:21:06] promised land the good news to us now
[1:21:09] that God has sent a deliverer the Holy
[1:21:11] Ghost and we're on a road to the
[1:21:12] promised land now people has made it
[1:21:15] Creeds and denominations but God Still
[1:21:18] Remains at our rest is the holy
[1:21:20] ghosten Lois gospel was preached un them
[1:21:24] as well listen to us but the word
[1:21:26] preached did not profit them the
[1:21:29] remember the word preached did not
[1:21:32] profit them not being mixed with faith
[1:21:35] in them that heard
[1:21:38] it oh my brethren let me stop here for a
[1:21:45] minute no matter how much the word is
[1:21:48] preached how well you like the way it's
[1:21:51] been preached unless you yourself are a
[1:21:54] PO Aker of that amen it won't do you one
[1:21:58] bit of
[1:22:00] good not being mixed with Faith by them
[1:22:04] that heard it amen they seen the
[1:22:07] Miracles of Moses they said that's
[1:22:08] pretty good and they walked over and
[1:22:11] they they seen perform Miracles and seen
[1:22:13] the pillar of fire maybe or heard them
[1:22:15] talk about it oh that's all right but it
[1:22:17] wasn't mixed with personal
[1:22:20] faith for as soon as they got to the
[1:22:23] Wilderness they every every one begin to
[1:22:26] murmur and God said because if they
[1:22:29] doubted it was sin amen don't doubt
[1:22:34] nothing amen
[1:22:37] believe don't doubt no matter how hard
[1:22:40] the case is believe
[1:22:43] it now they begin to murmur and God
[1:22:46] overthrow them and then he swore in his
[1:22:49] wrath that they should never enter into
[1:22:52] his rest and the Bible said here I
[1:22:54] believe it's in the the third chapter
[1:22:56] that their carcasses fell in the
[1:22:59] wilderness the third chapter the 17th
[1:23:01] verse but with whom he was grieved for
[1:23:03] 40 years was it not with them that had
[1:23:07] sin whose cares fell in the
[1:23:11] wilderness and of all of them that come
[1:23:14] out of Egypt only two went into the
[1:23:18] promised
[1:23:19] land out of the whole anti luian world
[1:23:22] in the days gone by there were eight
[1:23:25] Souls saved out of
[1:23:28] billions straight is the gate and narrow
[1:23:32] is the way amen and but few there will
[1:23:35] be that'll find
[1:23:36] it some people says say brother R what
[1:23:39] about all these thousands that the Bible
[1:23:41] said appear there just remember how
[1:23:43] many's died in each generation it's been
[1:23:45] Christians down to the age they'll all
[1:23:47] resurrect that makes up the body amen
[1:23:50] you're expecting to be 100 billion in
[1:23:51] this America come out or some other this
[1:23:54] world to today there might not be 50
[1:23:56] come out amen but the great Ransom
[1:23:59] church is laying in the dust awaiting
[1:24:03] there are God's
[1:24:05] Jewels that's resting in the dust but
[1:24:08] their souls are under the altar of
[1:24:10] God they're not in their right state
[1:24:13] they're in a body truly but a theosophy
[1:24:16] and they cried out to God how long they
[1:24:19] could see one another but they couldn't
[1:24:21] shake each other's hands that kind of a
[1:24:23] body you meet your mother in glory
[1:24:25] tonight if you should go you couldn't
[1:24:27] shake her hand cuz she has not that kind
[1:24:29] of a hand you couldn't feel it like
[1:24:31] could feel now because five senses is
[1:24:35] what's putting this body could of
[1:24:36] control the presence of her would be
[1:24:39] felt in a different atmosphere that's
[1:24:42] like a husband and wife there'll be no
[1:24:43] married or giving in married in
[1:24:45] heaven why because there is a different
[1:24:48] kind of love there's no sexual desire
[1:24:52] all those things has passed away you
[1:24:54] you're cleansed and pure but you never
[1:24:57] did live in that state therefore you
[1:24:59] wasn't created for that state you're
[1:25:02] just waiting
[1:25:03] there but you're longing to come back
[1:25:08] amen where you was created a man in a
[1:25:10] woman and there God will raise that body
[1:25:13] Out of the Dust of the earth and
[1:25:15] glorify then you'll see taste feel
[1:25:18] smelling hair and Associate praise the
[1:25:21] Lord we'll never know we can never enjoy
[1:25:24] Angels life we wasn't created angels God
[1:25:27] created angels but he created you and I
[1:25:29] men and
[1:25:30] women that's the state we'll be forever
[1:25:34] at his blessed coming now see other fell
[1:25:38] short because they sin and come short of
[1:25:42] the glory god showed them the pillar far
[1:25:45] he showed them signs and wonders he led
[1:25:48] them out he brought them into temptation
[1:25:50] to try prove them now haven't you had a
[1:25:53] lot of Temptation
[1:25:55] don't complain about him
[1:25:58] Rejoice God's with you he's trying to
[1:26:01] prove your faith look at job in the Old
[1:26:05] Testament when he said have you
[1:26:07] considered my servant job a just man a
[1:26:10] perfect man there is none like him on
[1:26:12] the earth oh he said sure you got him
[1:26:15] hedged up doesn't have any troubles
[1:26:17] doesn't have any wearies he doesn't have
[1:26:20] any Financial burdens everything's fine
[1:26:22] he don't have any sickness any pain let
[1:26:25] me have him I'll make him curse you to
[1:26:27] your face he said he in your hand but
[1:26:31] don't you take his life oh he done
[1:26:34] everything but take his life but he
[1:26:36] couldn't move
[1:26:38] job job know he stood pat on the word
[1:26:43] that's right all the Devils Out of Hell
[1:26:45] couldn't move him for he know he had
[1:26:48] offered that sacrifice he was justly
[1:26:51] accused him said you sined job and God's
[1:26:53] a punish you
[1:26:54] he knew that God had that he hadn't
[1:26:57] sinned before God he knew that he was
[1:27:00] righteous not because he was a good man
[1:27:02] but because he was accepting the burnt
[1:27:04] offering in his sin and tonight we know
[1:27:08] that his life proved out that he was
[1:27:10] righteous and when you not trying to get
[1:27:12] home to Glory because you try to help
[1:27:15] your neighbor that's good not because
[1:27:17] you join church that's good but you get
[1:27:20] home to Glory because you accept the
[1:27:22] righteousness of Jesus Christ
[1:27:25] nothing that you've done yourself now as
[1:27:28] we read on Far unto us was the Gospel
[1:27:31] preach second verse as well as to them
[1:27:35] but the word preached did not profit
[1:27:37] them not being mixed with faith in them
[1:27:40] that heard
[1:27:41] it Faith wasn't in them that heard the
[1:27:45] word just think
[1:27:48] today in the little humble Ministry that
[1:27:50] the Lord has given me there should be 40
[1:27:54] million Americans saved
[1:27:56] tonight you know what they say watch
[1:27:59] mental telepathy he's a mind reader no
[1:28:02] such stuff well he don't belong to our
[1:28:04] church see it's not no matter how much
[1:28:06] you lay it on the word and prove that
[1:28:08] it's God's word it's God's promise how
[1:28:11] much science would prove it that is true
[1:28:13] they'll still can't believe that's right
[1:28:17] the Bible said they couldn't said then
[1:28:18] what used of preaching God has to have a
[1:28:21] witness to condemn them at that day amen
[1:28:24] the word was preached and proved among
[1:28:26] them and they still ignorantly walked
[1:28:29] away there nothing left but judgment God
[1:28:32] could not just could not justly judge a
[1:28:35] nation unless it had mercy before it had
[1:28:39] judgment amen he's God he couldn't do it
[1:28:42] now what do we
[1:28:43] say for we which believe to have entered
[1:28:47] into rest as he said as I have sworn in
[1:28:51] my wrath if they shall enter into my
[1:28:54] rest although the works was finished
[1:28:57] from the foundation of the world for he
[1:29:00] spake in a certain place on on the
[1:29:03] seventh day on this wise
[1:29:07] I I do not want to hurt people's
[1:29:10] feelings against their religion that's
[1:29:12] not my purpose out in the fields I just
[1:29:15] preach a regular great Evangelical
[1:29:17] fundamental doctrines but in the
[1:29:19] Tabernacle amongst my children here I
[1:29:22] feel I have a right to preach what I
[1:29:24] think is Doctrine and Truth see I think
[1:29:28] that it's right now I have thousands of
[1:29:30] good saboorian friends of people who are
[1:29:33] 7-Day Adventists some of the dearest
[1:29:36] friends that I got some of them are
[1:29:38] 7-Day Adventists although the great move
[1:29:41] of the What's called the prophet the um
[1:29:44] voice of Prophecy they're firmly against
[1:29:47] me they said that I make the statement
[1:29:49] in the pull pit and said I was God and
[1:29:52] um at this light that followed was an
[1:29:54] angel and I was God and I come to the
[1:29:57] world to do great things to prove people
[1:29:59] that I was God now that's what the voice
[1:30:02] of Prophecy said about me over in
[1:30:04] California and every who told that you
[1:30:06] know told something wasn't
[1:30:09] so but in the first place not taking a
[1:30:12] thought against the Seventh Day
[1:30:13] Adventist Church or any other
[1:30:15] sabbatarian church but only for the sake
[1:30:18] of the Gospel we're going to get down in
[1:30:20] a few minutes on Pentecost
[1:30:22] too yeah true on Baptist we're going to
[1:30:26] get out on that and show that God
[1:30:28] doesn't favor any
[1:30:30] denomination that's right he only favors
[1:30:32] the individual and he doesn't deal with
[1:30:35] any denomination he never did and he
[1:30:38] never will according to his word but he
[1:30:41] deals with the individuals in every
[1:30:44] denomination yes it's individuals God
[1:30:46] deals with now listen to this real clear
[1:30:48] and if ever any time that question ever
[1:30:51] comes up to you it'll be
[1:30:52] settled now may the Lord help
[1:30:56] us now
[1:30:58] closely for the fourth verse for he
[1:31:01] spake in a certain place of the seventh
[1:31:04] day on this
[1:31:07] wise now watch he's talking about
[1:31:10] Sabbath how many knows that the word sa
[1:31:12] a b b a t h in the he is a Hebrew word
[1:31:16] that means r s how many knows that
[1:31:19] English sure don't Sabbath sound a funny
[1:31:22] word it is don't sanctify sound a funny
[1:31:26] word sanctify is a Greek word sanctify
[1:31:30] means to be made
[1:31:32] holy Hebrew means make holy Greek means
[1:31:36] sanctify English means make
[1:31:39] clean Sabbath
[1:31:41] means a day of rest that's what the old
[1:31:45] Sabbath was a day of rest when you see
[1:31:49] rest it means
[1:31:51] Sabbath look it up in your
[1:31:54] manuscript if you happen to have a Greek
[1:31:57] Bible and find out if the word if you
[1:31:59] got a scof your Bible look at your Marg
[1:32:01] reading on rest and see if it don't run
[1:32:03] you back to Sabbath Sabbath means rest
[1:32:07] amen all right now watch let us
[1:32:10] therefore fear less a promise being left
[1:32:14] to us to enter into his Sabbath
[1:32:21] rest now many people keeps d
[1:32:24] like keep Sabbath day Saturday others
[1:32:27] make a Sunday an idol a worship day and
[1:32:32] by the grace of God and by the God's
[1:32:35] word God help me tonight I can prove to
[1:32:38] you that they're both
[1:32:40] wrong both the Sunday worshipper and the
[1:32:43] Sabbath keeper there are absolutely both
[1:32:46] wrong according to the word and after
[1:32:49] all it's the word that we have to go by
[1:32:52] not the what Adventist say or not but
[1:32:54] what the Protestant says or the Catholic
[1:32:56] says it's what the Bible
[1:32:59] says now now watch for he spake in a
[1:33:03] certain place on the seventh day on this
[1:33:06] wise now we're going to put up a
[1:33:08] something like this and call this the
[1:33:11] God's rest the seventh day now watch and
[1:33:16] God listen to the scripture now God did
[1:33:21] rest the seventh day from all his
[1:33:27] work God had a
[1:33:30] Sabbath and that seventh day was 1,000
[1:33:33] years
[1:33:34] long a type of the
[1:33:37] Millennium for he spake of the seventh
[1:33:40] day on this wise and God did rest from
[1:33:45] all
[1:33:48] his his work the personal pronoun all
[1:33:53] his works he rested on the seventh day
[1:33:57] that's God and in this place under the
[1:34:01] law if they shall enter into my
[1:34:04] rest God rested physically for he had
[1:34:09] made the heavens and earth in six days
[1:34:12] and on the seventh day he rested from
[1:34:14] all his work he rested 1,000 years for
[1:34:20] the Bible said that one day on Earth is
[1:34:22] a thousand years in heaven
[1:34:24] a thousand years in heaven is one day on
[1:34:26] the earth how many knows the scripture
[1:34:27] says that in second Peter all right God
[1:34:31] rested on the seventh day and he spoke
[1:34:33] on this wise at a certain place listen
[1:34:36] close for he spake in a certain place of
[1:34:39] the seventh day on this wise and God
[1:34:40] rested from all his works and in this
[1:34:44] place again the law if they shall enter
[1:34:46] into my rest he gave the Jews on their
[1:34:50] way from the promised land or from the
[1:34:53] egyp up to the promised land the seventh
[1:34:55] day Sabbath now listen seeing therefore
[1:34:59] it remaineth that some must enter
[1:35:01] therein and to they whom it was first
[1:35:03] preached the rest God given the law and
[1:35:06] the Sabbath was the fourth Commandment
[1:35:09] entered not in because of unbelief now
[1:35:13] watch he's talking about the law how
[1:35:15] they entered in wasn't mixed with faith
[1:35:17] they didn't keep it they kept the
[1:35:19] Sabbath in a memorial that they were
[1:35:21] going to a land of Sab AB to have
[1:35:25] everlasting rest am from all their
[1:35:28] troubles and all their wearies no more
[1:35:30] task Masters no more restless nights
[1:35:34] they were on their way to the promised
[1:35:38] land of
[1:35:39] rest it flowed with milk and honey The
[1:35:43] Grapes was so big that two men packed
[1:35:46] one Bunch over their shoulders amen oh
[1:35:50] what a land of blessed rest amen but
[1:35:55] they failed to get it when they got
[1:35:57] there because of their
[1:36:01] unbelief they were turned
[1:36:04] aside at only 40 miles from where they
[1:36:08] left in Egypt to the promised land and
[1:36:11] they were 40 years getting there because
[1:36:15] of their unbelief amen God gave him the
[1:36:18] prophet gave him his sign gave him the
[1:36:20] pillar fire showed signs and wonders and
[1:36:23] preached of gospel to them and they
[1:36:25] walked out after the fishes and
[1:36:28] Loaves and fell in the wilderness and
[1:36:31] their carcasses perished in the
[1:36:34] wilderness Jesus at the fountain he they
[1:36:37] said our fathers eat man in the
[1:36:39] wilderness for 40 years he said I am
[1:36:42] that bread of life that come from God
[1:36:44] out of Heaven
[1:36:46] amen I am the bread of life Moses didn't
[1:36:49] give you that bread my father give that
[1:36:52] bread and I I am the bread that comes
[1:36:54] from God out of Heaven if a man eats
[1:36:56] this will never
[1:36:58] die there's the
[1:37:00] difference now watch they said he they
[1:37:03] drank from the rock that was in the
[1:37:05] wilderness for the space of so many
[1:37:07] years he said I am that
[1:37:11] rock Blessed Be His holy name amen I am
[1:37:15] that rock how could he be that
[1:37:19] Rock that Rock was a spiritual rock it
[1:37:22] followed the children of Israel and
[1:37:24] Moses had a stick in his hand which was
[1:37:26] a judgment Rod of God and God told him
[1:37:29] to Smite The Rock and he smoke The Rock
[1:37:32] and when he did Waters came from the
[1:37:34] Rock and Christ was that rock and the
[1:37:39] Judgment of God's penalty of sin was
[1:37:43] struck upon
[1:37:44] him God caused to lay on him the
[1:37:47] iniquity of us all and that iniquity
[1:37:51] bursted forth his heart and from his
[1:37:54] heart poured the Holy Spirit like rivers
[1:37:57] of
[1:37:58] water to a perishing dying people thank
[1:38:02] God I am that rock that was in the
[1:38:05] wildness why he said you mean to tell he
[1:38:07] said Moses the one that told you that he
[1:38:11] longed to see my day and he saw it in
[1:38:15] portion he said now you mean to tell us
[1:38:18] that you're greater than Moses that You'
[1:38:21] seen Moses and Moses has been dead 800
[1:38:25] years said now we know that you got a
[1:38:28] devil other words crazy we know that
[1:38:31] you're
[1:38:32] crazy he said before Abraham was I
[1:38:37] am I was a great I am that was in the
[1:38:40] burning
[1:38:41] bush I'm that
[1:38:44] fire that was in the burning bush I'm
[1:38:46] that
[1:38:47] angel that went before them and he said
[1:38:51] I come from God and I I go back to God
[1:38:55] and he came from God made flesh and
[1:38:58] dwell Among Us went back to that same
[1:39:00] pillar far and here he is tonight after
[1:39:04] 2,000 years the same yesterday today and
[1:39:08] forever doing the same thing praise the
[1:39:11] name Lord leading his blessed children
[1:39:14] and many are coming in because of
[1:39:16] unbelief now he said he limited a day
[1:39:19] and day when God finished his work then
[1:39:22] he limited another day
[1:39:24] and on this wise that if they shall hear
[1:39:27] if they shall come they keep the Sabbath
[1:39:30] go on through the new moons and so forth
[1:39:32] that's where the Advent Brethren tries
[1:39:34] to take you back now let's read
[1:39:36] on notice see therefore that some must
[1:39:40] enter therein and them to whom it was
[1:39:43] preached first enter not in because of
[1:39:45] unbelief now the seventh verse
[1:39:49] Oh I say the scripture is mathematically
[1:39:52] inspired amen I say the scripture is uh
[1:39:56] in an every way
[1:39:58] inspired the mathematics of the Bible
[1:40:01] are perfect did you notice this United
[1:40:03] States is number 13 and everything it
[1:40:05] does you know it establish a 13 colonist
[1:40:10] you know the flag will had 13 stars in
[1:40:12] it first amen you know what everything
[1:40:14] that the United States does is in a
[1:40:15] number 13 Did You Know It appears in the
[1:40:18] Bible in Revelations
[1:40:21] 13 certainly does the Little Beast the
[1:40:24] lamb that come up out of water not
[1:40:26] thickness and multitudes of people not
[1:40:28] out of the water but out of the land
[1:40:30] where there's no one it had two little
[1:40:32] horms civil and ecclesiastic powers and
[1:40:35] he was a lamb freedom of religion and
[1:40:37] after a while they went together and he
[1:40:39] spoke like the
[1:40:40] dragon and exercise all the power that
[1:40:43] Rome did before him that's coming to our
[1:40:46] nation amen you mark it down you watch
[1:40:49] to the confederation of churches and the
[1:40:50] Catholic unite together and watch what
[1:40:52] takes place
[1:40:55] people who follow the pillar of fire
[1:40:56] will certainly have a rough time but
[1:40:58] they're ready for the translation at
[1:40:59] that time that's right just ready to go
[1:41:03] fire the lamb overcome them the Bible
[1:41:07] and they thought him because they were
[1:41:09] called The Chosen and the faithful the
[1:41:13] elected of God keep from getting onto
[1:41:16] that prophecy now so we can run this on
[1:41:19] listen close the seventh chapter the I
[1:41:22] mean the four chapter the 7th
[1:41:24] verse seven is the number of
[1:41:28] completion three is the number of
[1:41:31] Life seven is the number of completion
[1:41:35] and this gives a complete
[1:41:38] Sabbath and again remember he spoke God
[1:41:41] on this wise then he spoke of the law on
[1:41:44] this wise and then again he limited a
[1:41:47] third
[1:41:49] day third time again he limited a day
[1:41:54] a certain day saying in David today
[1:41:57] after so long a
[1:42:00] time today after so long a time as it is
[1:42:04] said today if you will hear his voice
[1:42:08] Harden not your
[1:42:11] heart
[1:42:14] watch if Jesus had given them rest a
[1:42:18] Sabbath would he not after have spoken
[1:42:20] of another day
[1:42:23] the dispensations change with Jesus
[1:42:25] Christ from the law to Grace from Works
[1:42:29] into Grace from something you do to what
[1:42:32] something God did upon your own merits
[1:42:35] or upon his merits it changed when Moses
[1:42:39] come out of the Wilderness with the law
[1:42:41] he said Thou shalt not commit adultery
[1:42:43] Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not kill
[1:42:46] keep the Sabbath day holy when Jesus
[1:42:48] come out of the Wilderness when Moses
[1:42:50] come the devil tempted him it soon that
[1:42:53] devil tempted him he heeded to it Moses
[1:42:55] had a weak spot how many knows what it
[1:42:57] was temper and as soon as he seen him
[1:43:00] worship the golden cast he threw down
[1:43:02] the Commandments and broke them showing
[1:43:04] you that priesthood would be
[1:43:06] broken and God give them to him again
[1:43:10] but when Jesus came out of the
[1:43:12] Wilderness 40 days of fasting he was
[1:43:15] hungry the only weak spot he had and the
[1:43:18] devil come to him and said if thou be
[1:43:20] the Son of God turn these stones in the
[1:43:23] bread do a miracle here let me see you
[1:43:25] do it and I'll believe you Jesus said
[1:43:27] it's written man shall not live by bread
[1:43:30] alone but by every word that proceeded
[1:43:33] the mouth of God he know he didn't meet
[1:43:35] Moses
[1:43:36] there for he went to the word talk him
[1:43:40] upon the pinnical temple said if thou be
[1:43:42] the Son of God cast thyself down and
[1:43:44] cated not quoted but coed the
[1:43:48] scripture that it's written to give the
[1:43:50] angel charge concerning that same time
[1:43:51] to dash foot against the stone he'll
[1:43:53] bury the up and Jesus went straight to
[1:43:56] the word and rebuked him took him up on
[1:43:59] the mountain and showed him the United
[1:44:00] States and Germany and Switzerland all
[1:44:02] the nations of the world whatever would
[1:44:04] be so they're all mine I do them
[1:44:06] whatever I want to no where we got Wars
[1:44:08] and trouble said I do them no wonder
[1:44:11] women dressed and get by with it by the
[1:44:13] law they're all governed of the devil
[1:44:15] that's what the Bible said Satan said
[1:44:17] they're mine I do with them whatever I
[1:44:19] want
[1:44:20] to said if you worship me I'll make you
[1:44:23] King like I am Jesus said it's written
[1:44:26] thou shall Worship the Lord thy God only
[1:44:28] shalt thou serve get thee behind me
[1:44:31] Satan why Jesus knew that he had fall
[1:44:34] air to them in this great Millennium
[1:44:37] when his kingdom had come thy will be
[1:44:39] done on Earth as it is in heaven there
[1:44:43] will be no more sharks more there will
[1:44:45] be no more drinking there will be no
[1:44:47] more lust there will be no more adultery
[1:44:49] there will be no more death there will
[1:44:50] be no more
[1:44:52] sorrow Falls air to Every Nation they
[1:44:55] are his that's right they are his and he
[1:45:00] will fall air but Satan has them for a
[1:45:02] space of time that is the day that we're
[1:45:07] living you appreciate
[1:45:11] that I want to
[1:45:13] uh brother random said something that
[1:45:18] um let me see I highlighted it here
[1:45:35] brother Braham said this he
[1:45:37] said here it is he said Moses by faith
[1:45:40] saw the promise of God and the angel of
[1:45:43] the Lord came to him and he knew more
[1:45:46] about God in 5 minutes in the presence
[1:45:49] of that angel than he learned in 40
[1:45:51] years with the teachers of Egypt
[1:45:54] that shows you how important an
[1:45:56] experience
[1:45:58] is when you truly have that experience
[1:46:02] with the Lord Jesus when your
[1:46:06] life truly that's when your life
[1:46:10] changes when you have that contact with
[1:46:15] that Holy Spirit there is something that
[1:46:18] changed and you could be in seminary for
[1:46:20] 20 years you could have a PhD and all
[1:46:23] the Theology and and everything that
[1:46:26] that you could have stud studied the
[1:46:27] Bible since you were born but if you
[1:46:29] come into the presence of God just one
[1:46:31] time everything will change and you'll
[1:46:34] know more from that one moment than all
[1:46:37] of the studying can ever give to
[1:46:40] you and I'm a witness to that let's all
