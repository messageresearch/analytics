our heads and talk to them as they continue to play that course Lord we we come this evening some of us gathered here at the Tabernacle and others gathered in their homes maybe some families together and I know some may be having to work and may be listening in that way to date you're not limited to a specific place or who were just in the church building order but you said wherever two or three are gathered that you'd be inadmissible because you would be in us so each one denied listening in and having a need and a desire Lord to hear from you and father maybe a question that needs to be answered or today a situation came up they're not too sure what to do about it Lord would you minister to each landlord or through the ministry of your word Lord even in the scene in the songs and the worship and all Lord made the needs of your children be met Lord for you said every need is supplied Lord we can go to you full believe it we'll ask we appreciate that Lord we just ask you to speak to our hearts Lord use these lips lord help me to set myself on the side and let you speak nor dead which would be most needful we ask you to Jesus Christ amen thank you musicians god bless you just an announcement to make and there were no prayer requests that were given indirectly but there was a brother that did send one in during the week asking prayer for his stepson 15 year old stepson who had gotten into some trouble and was taken to the juvenile hall or just remembering that situation in prayer and a family and I don't know their name I didn't get their name but he's a missionary to the Philippines and a young couple I did see the picture with three children and the missionary did contract this virus he was guarded and he gave it to his wife and his children so lord knows who that family is and God is a healer it's already done so if you do have a need and you can call my phone you can call the church you can get it if you have whatsapp you can send it that way again and it can be prayed over also if you don't have whatsapp or no way to or maybe not a on your phone you don't have a smartphone you can call the church number at five two oh six two three oh three eight one and that if the phone doesn't answer then sister Rachel Peterson it goes to her voicemail and someone will get back to you so if they can't answer it they will if just general questions and information needed that's one way to to find out and we'll get back to you as soon as possible so just trust it in the time like this that we can help one another I got home the other day from service and I mentioned to my family I haven't seen brother so-and-so and sister zones so and then it dawned on me I haven't seen a lot of them they haven't been here but just something came up and they kind of laughed a little bit but sure would be good to see the saints one more time and get his feed but lord knows the reason as to why and as we spoke into different folks in different parts of the country and everybody going through the same thing and going through the same time so but it didn't come as a surprise to God he didn't have to go back to the drawing board and say wow how am I gonna fix this situation as it come talking to one of my daughters and she said maybe to use this time to break some habits change they say habits can take some time to change well there may be time to work on it now you know some of the things that you said boy I sure would like to change this in my life I would like this to be different and maybe there's time to dedicate to those things and heard some folks say that God may have put a stop to the rush so we could stop slow down a little bit and spend some time getting getting life or life straightened out getting things that sometimes things are in a busy and in a hurry and it's just hard to stop and get some of the things done both natural things things with the family but especially spiritual things and life gets busy at times there's a lot of plans and you know you say well I'm planning to take some time off here and something comes up and you can do it but maybe now there will be some time and God still supplies all our needs just the different testimonies you hear how God has met a need and a prayer request and and God meets it and sometimes you get nervous and you get afraid and say one of my co-workers today and as we were working together in a house and I made a comment to him and he just exploded and he just just got very upset and didn't say anything bad to me but just kind of vented on me so just let him and and went in before I came in service and I set my phone down I got a text and it was him he said I'm very sorry of how I acted today and I thought well thank the Lord for that you know and because of the stress in the situation's that we go through sometimes we can react in ways that we have to just say Lord forgive me and maybe go ask somebody hey I'm sorry or tell somebody I'm sorry I didn't mean to do that but I read this it was sent to me or those of you that get the daily strength and this is the one that came in a couple of days ago and I just like to share with it with you and read it here the scripture they use is 1st Peter 3:18 and for Christ also has one suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the Spirit and it was said it is doubtful whether God can bless a man greatly until he has hurt him deeply and that caused me to stop for a moment and it made me realize that said Jesus learn through the things he suffered and we would like to learn in a nice beautiful calm environment where everything is happy but sometimes you don't learn that way but in the time of need and the time of of maybe some some hardships it begins to teach you things teaches you they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength but you don't know if you don't have to wait this is especially for those who are older amongst us mungus those with experience and years under their belts they know what that life is full of hard knocks some things are extremely hard to deal with in this life and others are just perplexing bad times seem to outweigh the good simply because it's the bad times that shape us most that's the work where the word gives you so simply because it's the bad times that shape as the most they deeply affect us oftentimes in ways that we don't even see but do you really believe that this molding and changing is the tender and of Jehova in your life sometimes on this side of it looking back here saying wow that was God boy did I need it I didn't see it then I wondered why but thank God for it character is a victory and it is one through the tender hand of Jehovah molding and shaping the clay into a beautiful vessel of honor he is a potter and it would do us well to simply rest in the fact that we that when we can't seem to figure out why certain things happen some things that happen in our lives hurt us deeply it is the reaction to that hurt that shows our character and I just this what happened today and it work and he's we've worked together for many years and he's got a son that works with him now and the son is like 37 years old but act sometimes like he's 12 and when he wants to do good work he want he can do good work but he has a hard time getting out of bed and sometimes doesn't show up till noon and then a lot of issues but he does a good work so his father has gotten tired of hearing about the problems of this boy and and but you know if we always went to God and and just said you know Lord you need to deal with this problem with that person and you need to deal with this problem with that person we were always telling him and God would look down and say no I think I know where I need to deal with this I need to deal it with it in you and I've learned that by experience you know so you know he just he exploded he was that but but he sent me a text because I'm sorry with everything's going on I did I should have never done that to you and sometimes that's how we learned it's not a pleasant experience while we're going through it but second time around third time around and maybe for some of us five and 10 times around before we catch on but it's a shaping of our of us you know it is the character alone that we bring with us to the other side it is the Lord's prerogative to make sure his people have the fit to ring with him and character is a victory to overcome means that you've had a battle you had to overcome something Christ suffered for us since we suffer with him in this life don't forget that the fact that Christ paid the penalty for a wrongdoing it's it's a fact he says so what situation or what circumstance could ever darken the fact that crisis on the throne and it is to his side that we will one day go nothing will keep us from that it says don't let yourself forget that God allows us to wait to hurt to experience trouble all for our good trust in Him lean not to your own understanding and you know sometimes as as a parent or maybe a an elder sibling or older brother and sister who's already been through some of the situation's and teaching a younger sibling or a child or somebody that hey I've been there before don't do that don't get cut off in that you know and maybe that child or that younger princess and I've heard it this way well I need to learn on my own well there's some things that hey I could take some some good advice from somebody and go that way because they've been there and so if you wonder what's good advice open the scriptures and I'd like to start with revelations chapter 1 verses 3 and then 17 and 19 and want to continue back into his series that we were speaking on a relationship but the thought came with reading between the lines and I know there's a lot of things that could be said about reading between the lines but they have a certain way that I'd like to go so the scripture tell is blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand you know there there comes a time in a day when this is fulfilled every age look I said it's this day it's this day it's a this day but it's closer now than it's ever been I just like to read this translation of it blessed is he who reads and blessed are those who listened to the words of the prophecy and lay to heart what is written in it for the time before his fulfillment is now close at hand it's one thing to listen to it it's another name to take it at heart and put it into action so and in verses 17 and 19 and I don't know that we'll get through all of this it's a lot but maybe over a couple of Wednesday nights Lord willing and then John here in that same chapter 1 he says and when I saw him verses 17 through 19 and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death so what why do we fear he's got it in his hands it's under his control and he tells John write the things which thou has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be Hereafter and we just read verse 3 it says blessed are they who listen read and pay attention to the things that are written so if we take what God's Word says and we see what it is and we let him reveal it to us not make up our own ideas of what it is but let the Holy Spirit reveal it to us then we don't have to fear God has his hand in all things and in this thought of reading between the lines I as I was listening to brother Matz the Bible study and I had some written some thoughts down and they had archived it since I could elicit during the day while I was working and so it just kind of says he's talking about some things that just kind of fed a little more into this and and I was a God chance to speak to brother Matt for a little while and we were talking about the time you know and realize that when God addresses the church ages - each age you can go back and read it I went back through and just refreshed each church age he praised them for something he said you still handstand on this you still do this but I have somewhat against you I have this and he began to and to each overcomer for that age he gave a promise to the overcomer in this age this is this is your what you overcome this is what you receive isn't but when you get too loud Asiya this age the one that we were born and raised into and and I believe coming to the very end of it now he doesn't say very much good about it in fact he immediately begins to tell him your situation is bad but as I speaking to brother man I said but remind us let's be reminded so let's look at that revelations 3-2 to 22 and we use this once before but I like to go behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in some in to him and will sup with him and he with me here he is he's talking he says you have this problem you have this you're you know you're you've your failed in this you're you you know you say you're rich and you you're not rich you're blind in the end he's is really hard on loud Asiya because that's how loud you see is this today but he says but I still knock the door he said I didn't turn my back and walk over right away from you and leave you hopeless leave you helpless leave you in your own he says I'll knock on the door of your heart still and I will sup with you and come in and share with you if you let me and he says to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne out of this age the age that he hit hardest to that one I will grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame what it means does that mean he battled and went through it also to overcome you have to go battle you have to fight it wasn't just handed to him like I saved a silver spoon or golden spoon no there was a battle there was there was things that God had to face through in tabernacled in a body and he says even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne and then it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and so I just want to open it with that just again reminding we are blessed to read to know in to place keep in our hearts the thing God has said because that's what encourages us you know you get a phone call maybe a letter maybe in today's a text or something like that and sometimes yesterday I think it was yesterday morning or I believe yeah I opened up my gmail account and checked to see because we get information that way or work updates and things like that and a brother said hey bruh there and just thinking about you and your family praying for you what a blessing to wake up in the morning you see they whoa somebody's thinking about me and my family and said we just prayed for you my family prayed for you I said Lord thank you because that's how you work with your family and it's just a thing to realize that that he watches over us and he cares for us there so in looking at this and again I said reading between the lines and I thought as I thought on that subject his brother branham it says it quite often reading between the lines so I pulled up all the quotes and just seeing what they think most of them were talking about when he would be out of town or in another country and sister Branham would write him a letter and he would respond and he would say you know honey I just can hardly wait till I get home and she would say you know little Joseph for this and she goes but I can read between the lines I could tell I could read in there what she's really trying to say we're both telling their each other how much we miss each other how much we love each other we're praying for one another and and as I was looking at this reading between the lines God's Word is a love story and this is where this came to it's his love to us yet some people look at as condemnation as harshness as Boyd the requirements to live this are impossible but you and I can read between the lines and see God is telling me he loves me God is telling me he cares for me God said look not only do III require this of you but I'll do it in you when he talks to his disciples and he says there's a better way I'm gonna go away and they say Oh Lord don't leave us he's to know there's a better way there's something that there's a reason for this and why but he says I could be here with you every day of your life but unless I'm in you that's all it is I'm just around you just with you and I love him when he's around but it's greater when he's inside so reading between the lines not your own interpretation or personal thoughts it's not well it because look God's Word is a level of letter to his bride and it's a many membered body but she's one bride she's not brides different brides scattered all around just like that that young man from the meat market in Chicago who came and he found that that the character in that in that young lady he said it was that one that he came back for even though brother Branham in this story talks about all of her cousins and those around him they were all around her but - that one was his promise now is it just a Tucson Tabernacle no it's to everyone that's part of Christ part of that right it's it's so it's not our own personal thoughts and not our own personal interpretation it's the Holy Spirit making it real and you know what it'll produce a true Christian and it's it's but it becomes that thought becomes a personal relationship between you in Christ and it you know it's in its again it's it's for those of us who are married and and have family and all and anything's that it's a it's a relationship that we can really look closely at because in the natural you know and even those that are are not married but part of a family you can see how that works within your siblings within your parents you know it's still a real and in speaking with brother Matt and he just made a comment back to me and I was getting ready to say it but he beat me too and he said but that reading between the lines never gets out of the Word of God it has to run in continuity with the Word of God it's not special revelations out there it's not I remember I believe it was brother green one day that was ministering and he had made this comment how he had been talking to a brother who was talking about the deep revelations that this Minister preached so brother green asked him and he said well tell me about it and the brother turn it's so deep I can't even explain it to you well it's like having a glass of something to drink and it's so good it's delish I can recommend it to it have you tasted it no I haven't you know you should be a partaker of it too then you can really recommend it and and then remember he tells Peter blessed art thou simon peter sorry minbari jonah he said my father has revealed this to you it's not something that you learned on your own is not something that that that how did that you work to get but God gives it to you and it matches his word because it's his word that will not return void so and you think about that that relationship the the the building of our relationship the experiences in life in looks both ways you know I can look back as as we're growing up and things around mom and dad or things with my older brother and older sister and a younger brother and I laugh about it sometimes now and I forget who I was talking to and had a 13 year old son and they were talking about the problem the 13 year old son was having with a 17 year old son because now the 13 year old is beginning to express himself and in all and it reminded me when I turned 13 I thought suddenly I was big and tough and just be honest about it I thought I could beat up my older brother and it took about five weapons before I learned just I was 13 I couldn't beat him up he got a little frustrated with me because he said I keep having to knock you down in the ground and you keep getting back up when are you gonna learn you're not you're not stronger cuz your turn turn 13 but down the road as experiences in life and we laugh about those things but we can see the lesson in it things we've experienced by life things we have learned you know hey last time I did this and it hurt I'm gonna do a little bit different this time you know just things that we learn in like the personal experiences in our life is this remember even even God Jesus is speaking to his disciples before he leaves and he's talking to them and he's telling them look I'm sharing with you things these things must come to pass I must suffer I must go through this I must you know he's talking to him about this and yet when it started to help me there tell him don't do it don't do it don't do it Oh Lord no but he had already but he says remember these things that I shared with you they will come back to your memory they will be brought back to your remembrance and you can see oh that's what it was that's what he meant now brother Brown would say now you're reading between the lines you're beginning to see but it's the fulfillment of the scripture it's not something way out there you know and you know just just some thoughts as we get started into this here what builds a relationship the things you go through the things you experienced the daily things both good and bad both hard and easy you know those bring up even even the repetition at work you know and when when you do the same thing over and over you learn skill sometimes they get monotonous but somebody watching you because you've done it a hundred times and you know how to do they go man you make it look so easy but if they seen you do it the first time they ought to go I'm not doing it that way but you've learned you've experienced it I remember that one time at work and and the guys had left and I stayed late to finish a job that needed to be done in the morning for the morning and when they came in the morning said you did that all by yourself I said yeah he goes well how why is it because I've been doing this for about 15 years now and I know how to do it but it had been 15 years ago I would have left with you guys in the morning but I know this it's part of of what you've learned as life has gone on it's a daily thing that we go through and it's that's how we learn that's how we get our experiences that's how we grow that's how our faith grows you know he's never failed me he's met me he's coming and it gets stronger Lord you've never failed I know I can trust you because I've looked back in my life that was you that was you that was you and you've never left me sometimes I wondered where you were but you were there and therefore I know that I can trust you talking to a one of the co-workers today one of the guys that out on the jobsite and we both came to the same conclusion as we were talking a little bit you know as work is slowed down people are being laid off and one of the guys told me he says I'm gonna keep working but they're gonna cut my salary and you know all those things and we're talking and the heater on he goes but you know what we just got to trust in the Lord amen that's right we just trust in him does that mean I'm not gonna go through a hard time I'm not no we trust in him we put because that relationship has been built up I can trust him him he never has failed me and again they're the things experienced as we go through and remember again and I say this in here in Christ and God is His Word he's not just some spirit off one place you know you can hear and right now if you if you would look up and get on YouTube and just see sometimes when I'm listening to one of the brothers preach you know all the other youtubes come up and there's quite a few ministers from different organizations and they're all talking to everybody about being you know having peace and and being trusting everybody is preaching the same message right now that's affecting the world you know but you got to go back to God's Word because that never fails he says my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth I was listening to a man and in the headline that they'd posted it caught my attention he said this man is talking about the peace and all and then on the very last five minutes he expressed please don't stop sending in your tithes in your offerings and that's what he preached for the last five minutes and if you've heard of this man he has like six private jets you know in other words hey I still want my private jets make sure you that's all everybody heard you took the effectiveness of the peace part and said hey but don't forget to like my pockets you know but God's Word doesn't say that God's Word says with nothing in your hand but with peace in your heart you're much better off yeah and it's again those experiences that we learn those things that we go through that that we can summon but God you brother BAM said of you cannot separate Jesus Christ you cannot zip Christ from his word because he is the word he was a word made flesh you cannot put him into separate places so if I want to know him I go back to see what he says what did he tell us how did he do it what did he and then we'll take the message because it was unveiled to us through the message and saying this is how it you were through this situation this is how God did I can look through the testimonies I can hear what other people have I can hear and all of us have done that was when somebody have even right behind this pulpit and shared their testimony of how God delivered them how God brought them out how God saved him and say yes I can believe that because that's what God said he would do in his word so you can't separate him from his word because he is the word so when you go back to the word and you go back into Psalms and you go back into some of those places and say Lord your word says so therefore I'm taking you at your word you know the the little widow woman that that had said all I have is is this much oil and and the creditors are coming and I've got no way to I'm going to lose I'm others and I believe it's Elijah just told them hey how many of those empty ones can you get fill them up and take God at His Word he'll meet your every need and you can go back and read those things you open up the cabinet doors and there's just maybe in one box left or one loaf of bread but remind herself in his word he took the fish into three loaves and fed 10,000 so he's still the same yesterday today and forever it's just so you can't separate that so and I was thinking about this I said experiences that me and my wife have had now as a married couples 40 years there's a lot of things you learned in 40 years and if the Lord desires another 20 here on this earth there's a lot more will learn in fact sometimes you'll probably forget more than you remember because there's been a lot of things that have but as I was thinking about that I said well how long has a relationship been with Christ and I said it's eternal you were part of him before this world even began he thought of you and this is where I want to get into that love story that relationship you were part of him you were as brother Graham said in the back of his mind you were a thought that was going to be expressed in its due time so the relationship began on the eternal side only you didn't know it until now on this side you're in a human body and you're saying Lord according to your word you know me you know be my name and you've proven it to me you've shown it to me so that relationship again it's eternal with him and as I was thinking about this I remembered that story that that brother Graham talked about that the young man that you know from the meat packing farm and and and he's going he says I will be back for you in one year that was his promise to her and the same as he says I will return to take you back until we can be together as he prayed in John 17 that they may be where I am that was you you were in his mind you know and so just looking at that and and this love story is because he's coming back to take you to claim you to bring you with him he says and as I was looking at and I said Lord our relationship goes back to Eternity and you see me already at your side so your word will not return void so therefore I can stand on that and I can claim it sometimes looking at myself and my experiencing then I say Oh Lord of what would you why would you want this guy and he says because I've seen you there already you were with me in the beginning so and it made me think going in that line there and I just want to read a couple quotes here let's start with that first one there brother Jeremy I believe and brother Matt had asked us to listen to and read the feast of the trumpets and I had this thought already and I just just caught me as brother bran begins to pray and he says Lord most any person here that can move their hands could turn the pages of this Bible but there is but one among us this morning that can open it and that's a great Holy Ghost which is in our myths and that's the point I would say Lord we all could read between the lines and come out with different messages different ideas different thoughts but if the Holy Spirit in each one of us is going to teach us back to the Word of God so he says open up to us the word Lord as we read as you did to the disciples as they went on on their road to Emmaus and begin to explain to them the scriptures and may we when we leave say like those who coming back to Jerusalem from Emmaus did not our hearts burn within us as he spake to us along the way it's the same thing today Ted not my heartburn today as I read his word as I prayed with him as I shared fellowship as we listened to the ministry in water did not my heart burn with us the same way as he reminded us what the scripture says remember the love letter that he wrote to you that's what it is sir we would see Jesus just a couple different things that he said did not our heart burn with this within us as he talked to us along the way we know that he did something before them just like he did before his crucifixion no other man ever did it like that and when he got to that when he got them on the other side and close the door then he did this thing that he did before and they recognized quickly that it was him he hadn't changed he was Jesus Christ the same yesterday day before he goes that's him they were able to identify him and then we go to Israel in the church I believe it is there yeah Israel in the church that wouldn't you know if you read the word write like this here it's alright but you sure miss the meaning of it the word is written between the lines jesus said I've hid it from the eyes of the wise and the prudent and revealed it to the babes such as would learn I'm one of those can you claim that I'm one of those you know and and just looking at that and I I think back sometimes that's over the years and and I don't know what what your background some of you have been raising this message that's what you've known your whole life others came on either in a non-christian background or maybe a total different denomination I think some of the things that we were taught as young people are growing up as children and and some of those and things that we thought was right the evidence of the Holy Spirit was speaking in tongues you know the different things and others brought in through a Trinitarian doctrine that there were you know the Father Son and the Holy Ghost but God said I will reveal it to those and in due time yes you know III always remember this when we first came to Tucson and I've shared this before right behind my parents house was a an older couple there and they had a daughter our age and we were going to high school together and he was a I don't remember I think he might have been a Baptist and a good good folks good folks and him and dad would talk quite a bit and her name is Alma and we're going to school together and we got to talking one day in the bus as we were traveling about the Scriptures and she she made the comment she goes well really it doesn't make a difference what you are on the inside it has to be on the inside and I thought about it I said you know okay so we shared a little bit I said but you know that life that's on the inside is going to demonstrate to the outside this little seed here is an apple seed but until it gives forth and breaks forth nobody knows for sure unless you know what an apple seed looks like yeah if you've never seen one you wouldn't know somebody told that's an apple seed but until it gives apples you see that's right that's an apple seed until Christianity begins to show hey that's a Christian so we got to talking a little bit and she was talking about the Godhead and with the Trinity and all and speaking to her back and my brother was with me younger brother and we're talking to her and she said you know it doesn't make a difference you know and this and she saying all these things and I said well but God had already began to unveil these things to us and just you just gave her a simple illustration and I said look I said here's a man you know he's human he's got a wife so he's a husband and he's got a child so he's a father I said is he three or is he one she stopped and she looked as she goes I've never heard that one before I go that's God and she was quiet about it unfortunately she never talked to us again but I wouldn't have not known that had God not unveiled that to us because we thought it as Jesus only others had the you know but because we're part of him he makes those things known to us it's a love letter it's him expressing his love that he had with us from before the foundation of the world back to us today let's go ahead and finish the quotes there and in sinuses many of the bodies of the saints that slept in the dust of the earth rosin came out of the grave and entered into the city Abraham Isaac Jacob and then brother Branham says he was talking about this at the time when Jesus resurrected and and also when when these Saints back there and says don't leave me here in Egypt take me to the promised land because they knew where the resurrection was coming and here brother Branham answers it to us therefore have anything you wish to but bury me in Christ for those things in Christ will God bring with him at his coming hide away from the world what a beautiful picture there it's between the lines what the Bible says and what you see in between the line goes right on with the rest of the word but it just fills up the gaps when you wonder why they was doing it it didn't change the Word of God it just shows you it makes it brother Branham says bury me in Christ and he goes see it it's the same type back then when they said take me to the promised land because on that resurrection morning that's when we're coming up and Jehovah Jireh that's where it is with God and not trying to study from the newspaper and standpoint some theological standpoint but fall in love with him get down and really get him in your heart the love of God shed abroad in their heart by the Holy Ghost then go to reading the Bible and you'll see it coming right out between the lines you realize he loves me that's what it is he loves me and this is why he's making it no this is what he's revealing it this is why I'm getting to see him and understand him J because he loves me and that's what he's sharing with me see you know that what he's saying he never said the rut that right out in the word Jesus thanked the father because he had hid those things from the eyes of the wise and the prudent and brother Branham even says that when he's ministering I thought it was this until he showed me what it was he was talking about his brother Matt covered it on the seals and those he studied LARC and he studied those because he was trying to find that he said but the Holy Spirit came into the room was that for brother Branham only no that's for each individual in Christ the Holy Spirit will reveal the Word of God to you not a different word but what's been unveiled to us already and in the last one communion did I give you that communion I'm sorry I did miss oh I missed Jehovah Jireh sorry then when I go overseas he says can you bring that down just a little bit when I go overseas I got a lovely wife and tell her now goodbye sweetheart you pray for me now she prays for me when I'm overseas and and while gone for months and I pick up the letter and she'll say dear Billy I'm sitting here tonight with the children thinking much of you now I see what she's writing on the paper but you see I love her so much till I can read between the lines I know what she's talking about and he goes that's the way it is with God you can't just sit down and read it in a cold formal heart you've got to be in love with the author and then you can read between the lines then you have an understanding of the scriptures but all let me say it this way you have an understanding the scriptures and it becomes a life in you and what is that life that very word of God is expressed out in you and and and Paul writes and and I didn't put the scriptures down but Paul writes it in Corinthians chapter 13 he says we have all of this but there's a greater a more excellent way he said and he begins to speak of the love of God in a true believer they don't they're not like this and and we could read all all thirteen but the verses but to save time he says they Envy not that there's an audience but they they have faith they have charity they have and it begins to express what a true believer who has a true relationship with Christ and knows what that love story is about and has read between the lines and said hey this is how God wants me I'm not filled with anger I'm not filled with this I'm filled with what God's Word says you know sometimes we get angry but the scripture says don't let the Sun go down on your anger say lord help me and he does let your love fill me and then we let's finish with communion then we'll get into some more scriptures here we are not of the world we are different from the world live a different life a separated life we are never to live the life of the world and be a Christian we're to live an outstanding life a different life now I don't mean that in the social ranks but I mean we are to live a life of genuine holiness that the fruits of the spirit might be seen in us of meekness and gentleness and patience and long-suffering faith the fruit of the Spirit see that's who Christ to us that's who Paul lays out in the scriptures so why would we be any different arrogant haughty saying I've got it you don't know that's contrary to what the scripture says but one that says know he loves me and I love him and therefore you're where my brother my sister so I could treat you no different I have no desire to treat you any different because it's Christ in me doing the same thing no I want I want to get into just a little bit of a scripture lesson here and you know how much we hear about Peter and in it I looked it up how many times Peters name is mentioned in the scriptures it's quite a few Peters mentioned this both both and most of the time he's he's getting in trouble or saying something or doing something and God has to say hey Peter or even Paul later after in the book of Acts is saying hey Peter look how you're acting you know and you know what it makes me it encourages me because hey if God loved Peter that we think God can love me too cuz I give troubles to you know it's the same way so if we go to Matthew 16 and then we'll just read these because just some of the scriptures here about Peter and look what he says and I say all also unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it and we know that brother Branham preaches that that was revelation not Peter becoming the first Pope not the church being the rock but God revealing unveiling making it known to each individual he dresses that to Peter he didn't say now all you disciples the Lord just gave know Peter you got up you spoke because the father gave you that to speak so he addresses it to Peter that's how he addresses it to you he calls you by name it says this has come from the father and it has been revealed to you it's been made to you that hasn't changed and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it so I can stand on that same promise the gates of Hell will not prevail against the revelation God has placed in my heart also because it's still the same yesterday today and forever then we go to Matthew 26 58 there's so many different scriptures in here and we see the life of Peter in all the things but he was there with Jesus with the disciples around Jesus this whole time and and they're there living those three and a half years with him you know when Jesus comes by and says come but come follow me and they heard all the things that God said they experienced them all now here comes the time the greatest fulfillment of everything that Jesus came to be born on earth or when he had told them already I have to go this way I must do this in order to fulfill all of this as to follow what the scripture says and for me to redeem you back this has to go and Peter and then same oh no don't do it No and then over here Peter saying I won't deny Oh in fact I'll go with you I'll be there with you along with all the other disciples you can read that too we always talk about Peter but there's a disciples you know wait a minute but you were gonna you were going to destroy the Romans and in 'but but he said no there's a better way now here it says now I just want to hit these parts here but Peter followed him afar off unto the high priests palace and went in and sat with his servants to see the end he became a spectator Peter the one that said I will never leave you I won't turn my back on you I will never he goes and he sits over there because he's just gonna sit back and watch let's see what happens that's what he said he went to see the end to watch what was going to happen verse 69 now Peter sat without the palace and a damsel came to him saying thou also was with Jesus of Galilee now we know what Peter's answers were no I wasn't I don't know what you're talking about the st. Peter who just a couple of days earlier was saying I'll never deny you thou art the Christ now he say tellin this damsel it goes no I don't even know him 73 and after a while came unto Him they that stood by and said to Peter surely thou art one of them for thy speech betrayeth thee you talk like them you talk to you you quote the scriptures your language is the same as theirs and again Peter denies it verse 75 and Peter remembered now we know that said Peter even cursed and then Peter remembered the words which Jesus said in him before the crow thou shalt deny me thrice and he went out and wept bitterly he hears that crowing and it reminds him what Jesus had told them and I'm sure if Peter was like us and I'm sure he was there's no hope for me I've betrayed him I failed him I turned my back on him I told him I would've and he went out and he wept bitterly where am I gonna find mercy where am I gonna find forgive us not knowing that that's exactly why Jesus was hanging on the cross for that reason and he still will forgive those who have done things that you and I would be embarrassed of and I like to bring this part in from mark chapter 16 verse 7 also maybe I gave you the wrong one mark 16 7 I'm sorry I did give you the wrong one no you've got 17 mark 16 7 and he says but go your way tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee there shall you see him as he said unto you he specifically said and tell Peter also behold I stand at the door and knock even though I said these things and I said this is the loudest seea and this is what you're I still stand at the door of your heart and knock and say come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and I will give you rest he says and tell Peter also to come how many are glad that he still says come on come hey there are some times that I don't feel worthy at all I say Lord I'm a failure but he says come on to me anyways come in here you know and so we think about those things that we see that in that relationship that they built of three and a half years with Christ fishermen that they were rough men you know you hear this comment made every once in a while they can curse worse than a sailor they have rough languages they you know we worked with one in at work that had just retired and he was the chief mate in one of the big ships and boy sometimes you just didn't want to be around him because his language was terrible it was just it was I mean it was filthy and he would say well it's just what I learned and we'd say but you're sitting here at the meeting you don't need to talk like that it's just not a good thing that's that's what these disciples came from they came a lot of them came from a rough background and God still said come follow me you're going to be my disciples uh-uh you know with us like one person said we want to clean the fish before we catch them but you got to catch them and land them first before you can clean them let God do the bringing in and landing and let God do the cleaning let us show an example of what a clean Christian is what God has done for us and say I've been where you're at but you can be where I'm at today let our life speak that way back to somebody I used to have those problems I used to be my habits that used to be my life but God has changed me you know God has done this and he can do that for you now so in in in their relationship with Christ it was very personal they walked with him they talked with him they slept on the ground if he slept on the ground they went to Lazarus how they they were with him all the time a few times it said that Jesus crossed over was alone then he came back out to meet him or he told them going buy some food I'm gonna go but most the time they were with him daily they saw him and he saw them - I'm sure he saw the squabbles I'm sure they saw the elbows I'm sure he's all the times that they said no I'm gonna sit closer to him no I'm gonna do this they were human they were like us Jesus saw it all and he says again Peter is the one that they really talk about in the scriptures and he says but go your way tell his disciples this is the angel speaking to him and Peter also specifically calls him by name I just tell him I want to have let's let's get into st. Luke chapter 24 and I was looking through the chapter 24 and st. Luke and it's it's after his death and resurrection and and it's quite a story there they've waited there the road to Emmaus is what most of us talk about there let's start with verse 1 in chapter 24 I'm st. Luke again part of that relationship now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came unto the sepulchre bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain others with him now didn't he tell them that in three days he would rise again but they came really expecting to find the body to an item go on go through this fairly quickly and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre verse three and they entered in and found not the body of the Lord Jesus he said in three days I'll write and if they had caught that word if they realized they would have said why are we looking for him because even they tell him that let's continue on and it came to pass as they were much perplexed thereabout wondering where did he go where's the body what happened behold two men stood by them in shining garments and as they were afraid and bowed their faces to the earth they said unto them why seek ye the living among the dead did not he tell you did not he say to destroy this temple in three days I'll rise it up again did not he refer to the scriptures and the prophecies and they're saying so why are you looking for him here for six he's not here but his risen remember how he spoke unto you when he was yet Galilee that's why angels tell him remember he told you this remember he talked member he said he would rise again remember he said my peace I give you not as the world remember said I'll never leave you I'm with you Kobach didn't he tell you those things wasn't it in the letter he wrote you I get to preach to some of the folks here this is to all of us in the letter that he wrote says that's what he's saying to you your mind I love you I have redeemed you he said well he was yet in Galilee he's telling them there he's not here he's risen saying the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again it's the third day so why did you expect to find him here why did you come to me and ask me and not expect me to answer to meet your need to to be with you to comfort you because I said I'm the comforter I said I'm your peace I'm your joy and that's what you should expect it's gone and they remembered his words and I like that sometimes I have to stop and say Lord I just read to remember your words in this letter that you wrote to me it behooves me it's to my benefit it's good for me to remind myself by reading it by getting then opening up the scripture and say hey your word says in Psalms 23 the Lord is my shepherd it says in Jeremiah 29:11 I know the plans I have for you I can go to st. John 17 and read the prayer that you prayed for me and remind myself what your word says let's go on and return from the Sepulcher and told all these things unto the eleven and the rest they shared it and said hey listen do this verse 10 it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and other woman that were aware of them which told these things unto the disciples O Lord how dare you use nice men will just don't like that but you know what if I'll tell the Lord if you need to have a donkey speak to me because I won't listen do it Lord so that I can pay attention whatever it takes if God wants to use someone in your life your neighbor your friend your child your husband your wife a brother a sister whatever it is to get your intention and you say thank you Lord because you were mindful of me and their words seemed to them as idle tales and they believed them not that's then arose Peter and ran into the sepulchre and stooping down he said I gotta go find this out for myself and he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves and he parted wondering himself what happened what has happened I denied him over there I I watched from a distance I heard that that rooster crow and so I know his words were true these three and a half years I saw him walk on the water in fact I walked on the water with him I saw him for what's happened what's taking place let's go on and behold two of them went the same day to a village called Emmaus which was from Jerusalem about threescore long they said you know what we got to go home now let's go back and they took a trip and I'm glad that when you go out you walk and you turn your back and I'm gonna say it that way you turn your back is you know what I'm just I'm just gonna go back that way he'll come and meet you he'll come out and he'll say hey hold on let me talk with you and they talked together of all the things which had happen brother sister wasn't it supposed to be like this didn't the pastor preach it this way didn't brother Branham say this I thought it was supposed to be this way then this scripture didn't Isaiah say didn't Jesus tell us and and this is what they're talking about 15 and it came to pass that while they come in together and reason Jesus himself junior and it comes by and he just hey guys no and in it just what are you guys talking about we can't be where that what talks about that in the scripture come that's gone and but their eyes were holding holding that they should not be holding they were for some reason God allowed it to be this way he said you know what they just didn't recognize it maybe it was in their misery maybe it wasn't their sadness maybe it was in their confusion that they didn't realize that was him walking with him and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk and you're sad wait a minute brother wait a minute sister I'm looking upon you you're walking you seem disappointed you seem brokenhearted and and and some of the things you're saying I thought he said he would never leave me I thought he said that I wouldn't you're talking like you're disappointed you're talking like you're hurt this is what he what's your communication why are you talking like this he's talking to them you're sad you you're down fallin you know you're you're brokenhearted eighteen and one of them whose name was Cleopas answered him are Theo are you the only stranger in Jerusalem did you know what's going on haven't you heard CNN didn't you hear this news didn't you heard the latest up do you know what governor Ducey said did you miss all of this or view better Jesus and has not known these things which are come to pass them these days are you not aware what we're having no idea that they all came to pass because of him and for him for them let's go on and he said unto them what thinks and they said and I'm concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God in all the people they began to preach back to him 20 and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him even though he told us that was what's gonna take place let's continue on but we trusted that ahead that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel and besides all this today is the third day since these things were done yeah that's right it's the third day when you should have been looking for a resurrected Christ it's the third day but you're turned in your and your broken heart and your sadness and your wandering and your walking in the other direction and sometimes we'd get to that time in our lives Lord where are you I don't know brother branham said that this guy was like brass to him at one time just thought broken hearted wondering God doesn't talk to me God doesn't answer me God it's a part of everybody's life but just look at it on the third day they should have said we should be out here looking for him he's resurrected but they're walking the other direction yes and certain women also of our company made us astonished they were early they're at the gravesite that's a poker and when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive could this really be we don't know where this is not how we thought it was going to work out let's continue on and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre and found it even so as a woman had said but they didn't see him they didn't find him they didn't see the vision of the angels neither did they find Jesus and he said unto them o fools you know what we've heard the description of a word a fool it's a person that says there is no God and today is the day the honor people like that I think they called it April Fool's Day and he said unto Him old fools I think to me this is just me okay he's just saying wait a minute are you saying God died are you saying he didn't resurrect are you telling me that he says then slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken everything in the scripture that prophesied of me I fulfilled it yet you're questioning in it you're wondering about it let's go on what not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory isn't that what the scripture says isn't that what he told you and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them all the Scriptures the things concerning to himself and what a brother branham's he'll tell us when you take this word and it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday from beginning to the end that's exactly what he did he went back and said from the beginning the scripture spoke of this and he expounded that to them and they drew nigh unto the village where the weather they went and he made as though he would have gone on is it ok guys I'm good talking with you but I've got to go away there but something about them was starting to pull and draw and they constrained him saying abide with us for it's evening time and the day is far spent and it's going to get dark soon and it's dangerous going down the road you know there's thieves and robbers on the way he says so why don't you stay with us the night and he went as to into tarry with them yeah he says ok that that's a good idea I'll go in with you they still don't know it's him and it came to pass as he sat up meet with him he took bread and blessed it and brake it and gave to them 31 and their eyes were open and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight he came back and he did what he's always done he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's not a new special revelation for our age it's not something that nobody's never had he said the love letter is the word of God all of it he says but the Holy Spirit we go and he opened their eyes and they realized that was him did not our hearts burn I realize it's him there's something about his presence when it draws nigh and draws and comes close you've been a hate that's the Lord and you humble yourself and you quite your spirit say Lord that's you because you've experienced him before and they said to one another did not our heart to bring with us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures he opened to them the scriptures brother Bram says it takes the Holy Ghost to open he's the same yesterday today and forever and they rose up the same Mountain returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and then that were with him he they went back and turn around I said let's head back to Jerusalem and share it the sisters were right he is alive He is risen saying the Lord has risen has appeared to Simon and they told what things were done on the way and how he was known of them in the breaking of bread brother Brown says they just saw that he was the same he did it he didn't change it exactly the same he's consistent he's the same yesterday today and forever that's the Lord can point back to it point back to it that's gone that's gone that's God there's no question in it and as they thus spake Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and he saith unto them peace be unto you even his greeting fear not peace be unto you that didn't change brother Branham says you began to talk about him you began to speak about him and he draws near and that's what they were doing now they Rika sat down there being talk listen what happened because and suddenly he was in their best that's continued on 37 but they were terrified and frightened and suppose that they had seen the spirit they just finished telling him and he appeared to us and he says and they got afraid though the other disciples wait a minute who was that the same one that walked in the water he even showed him the nail-scarred hands he showed him he was Jesus Christ still but they got afraid and he said unto them why are you troubled and why do the thoughts arise in your heart behold my hands and my feet that it is myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as you see me here he said come and touch me come and fill me let me prove it to you even we know what he did with Thomas he said doubting Thomas so sometimes we wonder sometimes we questioned but he'll come by Hey look I'm here you can experience me again I haven't changed and when he had thus spoken he showed them his hands and his feet and while they yet believed and while they yet believed not for joy and wondered he said unto them have you here any meat they're still having trouble can it could it be did his appearance change so much they couldn't recognize him what was it it was just having trouble of saying in their hearts I know he said that but could it be and every once while we get to that place I know you said that Lord but could it be but let let us rather take Lord I know you said it and it will be Lord if I have to I'll say lord help my unbelief and they gave him a piece of broiled fish and of a hand out of a honeycomb and he took it and did eat before them and he said unto Him these are the words which I spoken to you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and the prophets and in the Psalms concerning to me everything that God said concerning him and concerning us will be fulfilled because his word never returns void then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures again brother Branham said it takes the Holy Spirit to open the understanding of the scriptures and he said unto Him thus it is written and thus it behoove Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead of the third day because this is how I am redeeming you restore him back to that fellowship that I had with you from before the fountain and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all the nations beginning at Jerusalem and ye are witnesses of these things are you a witness of these things that he's the same he's telling your witness and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tarry this of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high remember he said I told you of a better way he said now go there to Jerusalem and wait because that better ROI is coming and he led them out as far as Bethany and he lifted up his hands and he blessed them and it came to pass while he blessed them they were and he was parted from them and carried up into heaven and they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy and we're continually in the temple praising and blessing God amen and they realized that their hearts were full and they went now to fulfill what he told them go to Jerusalem and wait until you be filled with this promised that better way I'll be in you not with you he said it's a better way you've had me with you but all being it and if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you it will quicken bring to life this mortal body because without it we don't have that resurrection he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday Dave and he tells us that in his letter to us his love to us what he done for us what why how he redeemed us how he wants us at his side how he wants us to reign with him how there's an eternal an eternal gathering with him he said that's what all this is for to take us back to what we had in the beginning if the love letter doesn't tell you that then I'd say go back and read it again if the love letter doesn't tell you how much he loves you and cares for you and how much you mean to him and even though you're going through the hard times and the difficult times he still loves you and he still cares for you then go back and read it again until it speaks the same that what he said to his disciples to you because he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today let's bow our heads of the musicians would make their well Lord we thank you that and and and we say appreciate
