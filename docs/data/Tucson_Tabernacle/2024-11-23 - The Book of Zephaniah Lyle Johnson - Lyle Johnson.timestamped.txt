[35:18] we're excited to look into this book of
[35:20] your Prophet Zephaniah we thank you in
[35:23] Jesus name amen
[35:28] while we're standing and for our opening
[35:30] verses I'd like to read a short account
[35:32] of two incidents in the life of King
[35:36] Josiah both are found in 2 Chronicles
[35:39] chapter 34 and occurred in the time of
[35:43] Zephaniah the first is the finding the
[35:47] discovery of the book of the law it's
[35:51] six years into Josiah's reforms
[35:53] destroying the Pagan places of worship
[35:56] smashing idols and and so forth it says
[35:59] now in the 18th year of Josiah's Reign
[36:02] so he's aged 26 now about 623 BC when he
[36:07] had purged the land and the house he
[36:10] sent chiffon the son of aaliah and
[36:12] Messiah the governor of the city of
[36:14] Jerusalem and joah the son of jehoahaz
[36:17] the recorder to repair the house of the
[36:20] Lord his God continuing the reforms he
[36:23] started six years earlier and now
[36:26] restoring Solomon's Temple
[36:28] skipping to verse 14 and when they
[36:30] brought out the money that was brought
[36:32] into the house of the
[36:34] Lord hilia the
[36:36] priest found a book of the law of the
[36:40] Lord given by
[36:41] Moses skipping to verse 18 then chiffon
[36:44] The Scribe told the King Josiah saying
[36:47] hilaya the priest hath given me a book
[36:51] and chiffon read it before the
[36:54] king and what's Josiah's reaction to the
[36:57] words he hears for the very first
[37:02] time it came to pass when King Josiah
[37:06] had heard the words of the law that he
[37:08] rent his clothes a way of expressing
[37:11] extreme grief in the culture of the
[37:14] time and Josiah commanded hilaya and
[37:18] ayim the son of
[37:21] sheon and abdon the son of Micah and
[37:25] chiffon The Scribe and aasia a servant
[37:28] of the Kings saying go inquire of the
[37:32] Lord for me and for them that are left
[37:34] in Israel and in Judah concerning the
[37:37] words of the book that is found for
[37:40] great is the Wrath of the Lord that is
[37:42] poured out upon us because our fathers
[37:45] have not kept the word of the Lord to do
[37:48] all that is written in this
[37:53] book the second incident is the prophecy
[37:57] of Hala and Heather will be helping you
[38:00] with this assuming the microphone is
[38:01] ready there and H and hilka and they
[38:05] that King Josiah had appointed went to
[38:07] holda the prophetess not to Nahum not to
[38:11] Zephaniah not to Jeremiah all of whom
[38:14] were in Judah and active at that time
[38:18] holda the wife of shalam the son of
[38:20] tikva the son of hazra Keeper of the
[38:23] temple or priest's wardrobe now she
[38:26] dwelt in Jerusalem in
[38:28] Mish the new quarter the second part
[38:31] only the King James version uses the
[38:33] word
[38:34] college and they spake to her to that
[38:38] effect they relayed the king's
[38:41] inquiry and she answered them thus saith
[38:45] the Lord God of Israel tell ye the man
[38:48] that sent you to me thus saith the Lord
[38:52] behold I will bring evil upon this place
[38:56] and upon the inhabitants there of even
[38:58] all the curses that are written in the
[39:00] book which they have read before the
[39:02] king of Judah because they have forsaken
[39:05] me and have burned incense under other
[39:07] gods that they might provoke me to anger
[39:10] with all the works of their hands
[39:12] therefore my wrath shall be poured out
[39:15] upon this place and shall not be
[39:18] quenched and as for the king of Judah
[39:20] Josiah who sent you to inquire of the
[39:23] Lord so shall you say unto him thus
[39:27] saith the Lord God of Israel concerning
[39:30] The Words which thou has heard because
[39:34] thine heart was tender and thou did
[39:36] humble thyself before God when thou
[39:39] heardest his words against this place
[39:41] and against the inhabitants thereof and
[39:43] humblest thyself before me and did ren
[39:47] thy clothes and weep before me I have
[39:49] even heard thee also Josiah sayeth the
[39:52] Lord behold I will gather thee to thy
[39:56] fathers and thou sh sh be gathered to
[39:58] thy grave in peace neither shall thine
[40:01] eyes see all the evil that I will bring
[40:03] upon this place and upon the inhabitants
[40:06] of the
[40:06] same so they brought the king word again
[40:11] please be
[40:14] seated the portions we just read set the
[40:18] stage for the destruction of Jerusalem
[40:21] and Judah and provide background for our
[40:25] lesson this evening
[40:36] technical
[40:43] difficulties
[40:46] oops more technical
[40:56] difficulties is it's at the slide of
[40:58] Minor Prophets I'll I'll just go ahead
[41:01] and use your imagination that that slide
[41:03] is up there
[41:07] Zephaniah got it thank you Zephaniah is
[41:10] the ninth among the group we call Minor
[41:12] Prophets the Hebrew Bible does not call
[41:15] them minor it simply refers to them as
[41:17] the Dozen or the 12 reminds me of Jesus
[41:21] and the disciples brother brandom
[41:24] sometimes referring to Christians as
[41:26] Messiah ETS
[41:28] zephaniah's prophecies are focused on
[41:30] Judah in particular and the world of
[41:33] their oppressors in general this is also
[41:37] the third and last of the Minor Prophets
[41:39] to specifically mention Nineveh the
[41:42] capital of the ancient Assyrian Empire
[41:45] which we encountered in the books of
[41:46] Jonah and
[41:51] nahm the book is short has only three
[41:55] chapters this is one breakdown I found
[41:57] of the topics covered in its prophecies
[41:59] the the background image represents
[42:01] Solomon's
[42:03] Temple there are a total of only 53
[42:06] verses in the entire book so we'll read
[42:08] it all this
[42:09] evening before we do of course we need
[42:14] context let's start with geography the
[42:17] map shows the approximate area of the
[42:19] Kingdom Under of Judah under Josiah it's
[42:22] inviolet the capital Jerusalem is
[42:25] circled on the map you can see it
[42:28] includes much of the former Northern
[42:29] Kingdom of Israel at the time of Josiah
[42:32] the Assyrians controlled the surrounding
[42:34] area including Egypt the whole entire
[42:37] area you see is under ass Syrian control
[42:40] Josiah's kingdom is is allowed to sort
[42:43] of be a
[42:45] kingdom uh but it's a vassal state so
[42:48] they're paying tribute taxes extortion
[42:52] to
[42:53] Assyria well when did this happen to get
[42:56] the time of the prophecy let's start
[42:59] reading the introduction zephani
[43:02] introduces himself in the contents of
[43:04] his writing in the very first
[43:06] verse the word of the Lord which came
[43:09] unto Zephaniah which means treasured of
[43:12] God the son of Kushi the son of galiah
[43:16] the son of amariah the son of Hezekiah
[43:18] and the days of Josiah the son of Amon
[43:22] king of
[43:23] Judah Zephaniah tells us his lineage
[43:26] it's the longest lineage goes back more
[43:29] Generations is listed by any of the
[43:31] other prophets it may have been clear to
[43:33] his peers not so much to
[43:37] us many claim that the Hezekiah noted as
[43:40] a former king of Israel Josiah's
[43:43] grandfather it certainly is possible it
[43:45] it could be the difficulty is that his
[43:48] father is named after a tribe or people
[43:51] of Africa this implies that Galah
[43:54] married an African woman and named his
[43:56] son or one of his Sons Kushi after her
[43:59] tribe it's certainly possible of
[44:02] Uncertain
[44:06] likelihood when did all this happen what
[44:08] is clear is that he prophesied in the
[44:11] reign of Josiah the K we read about in
[44:13] our opening verses many place a time of
[44:16] his prophecy just after the book was
[44:18] found and read to the king in 623 BC the
[44:21] the 18th year of his Reign but
[44:24] zephaniah's angry denunciation of the
[44:27] widespread idolatry in Judah seems to
[44:29] indicate that it was before or early in
[44:32] the period when Josiah's reforms were
[44:34] initiated which began in 631 BC the 12th
[44:37] year of his Reign at the age of 20
[44:40] either way zephaniah's prophecy is an
[44:43] expansion of and in complete agreement
[44:46] with the words of the propheus holda
[44:49] which we read in our opening
[44:52] verses so we place his prophecy is most
[44:55] likely between 632 and 6 22 BC less than
[44:58] 25 years from the Babylonian conquest of
[45:01] Jerusalem 40 to 45 years before the
[45:04] destruction of Jerusalem and the temple
[45:07] I've indicated the likely range with the
[45:08] yellow line for those of you that have
[45:11] the quiz this is an on it all the
[45:14] references I found agree that Zephaniah
[45:17] was probably a priest and that he was in
[45:20] Jerusalem and for interest the only
[45:23] place I can find brother brandham even
[45:25] mentioning Zephaniah is when he was
[45:27] looking for something in Zachariah and
[45:29] accidentally turned to Zephaniah and so
[45:31] oh this is an old Bible I'm not going to
[45:33] find Zachariah in Zephaniah and flip the
[45:36] pages end of the entire references of
[45:38] all the recorded sermons of brother Bram
[45:41] of the name or the book of
[45:44] Zephaniah so we're treading new ground
[45:48] here let's continue
[45:50] on the next portion of the book is the
[45:53] coming judgment on Judah the book the
[45:55] book immediately gets right to the
[46:00] point I will utterly consume all things
[46:03] from off the land sayeth the Lord I will
[46:06] consume man and Beast I will consume the
[46:09] fowls of the Heaven and the fishes of
[46:11] the Sea and the stumbling blocks with
[46:14] the wicked and I will cut off man from
[46:16] off the land sayeth the
[46:20] Lord this speaks of a general
[46:22] destruction or judgment it's a shocking
[46:26] apocalyptic
[46:27] Vision it may be
[46:30] literal it is more likely a literary
[46:33] device to get people's attention telling
[46:35] them to prepare for an unimaginable
[46:38] catastrophe that the Lord is really
[46:41] really angry like finding out your child
[46:44] did something really bad and responding
[46:46] I'm going to kill that kid when I get
[46:49] home I'm reminded of a time when I was
[46:52] in Washington DC in that area in the
[46:54] spring of 2004
[46:57] was in a in a in a building with a at a
[47:00] satellite company we were working on
[47:01] three small satellites a group of us had
[47:04] designed these we're going to hand carry
[47:06] them through Moscow and onto Kazakhstan
[47:09] for launch on a Russian rocket I was
[47:12] head down and focused when a dear friend
[47:15] of mine a NASA scientist told me he had
[47:18] recently purchased an automobile a Mini
[47:20] Cooper S and asked me why would you like
[47:23] to see my car now I said either no no or
[47:27] no not right
[47:29] now he was hurt by my
[47:32] response and I later realized when I got
[47:35] my head out of what I was focused on
[47:37] that while what he said was would you
[47:41] like to see my mini what he was saying
[47:44] was Lyle I want to show you my new car
[47:47] please come have a look admire it be
[47:49] sure to congratulate me on acquiring
[47:52] it I heard and responded to what he said
[47:56] I I completely missed what he was saying
[48:00] I didn't read between the lines so to
[48:03] speak it's my usual nerd clutz mode well
[48:07] and Zephaniah if everything is gone if
[48:09] humanity is eradicated why would the
[48:11] Lord then go on to speak of Juda and the
[48:13] people of
[48:14] Jerusalem if it's meant to be literal
[48:16] and the event
[48:18] sequential rest of the book doesn't seem
[48:20] to make sense at least to me but if on
[48:23] the other hand it's an expression of
[48:25] God's extreme disp pleasure showing us
[48:27] his perspective on the subsequent events
[48:30] described it makes perfect sense at
[48:32] least to
[48:33] me let's move on the prophecy then goes
[48:36] on to a more specific area in
[48:42] time I will also stretch out my hand
[48:45] upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants
[48:49] of Jerusalem and I will cut off the
[48:51] remnant of Bal from this place and the
[48:53] name of the Kims with the priests
[48:57] Ms are priests of idol worship the Lord
[49:00] is going to wipe out not only the
[49:01] priests of false gods but also the
[49:04] priests that are merging worship of the
[49:06] Lord with idol worship the kind of
[49:09] syncretism blending cultural religion
[49:12] with worship of the Lord that Paul
[49:14] admonishes us against in some of his
[49:16] letters trying to make it more
[49:17] comfortable within the local culture or
[49:19] religions I remember when Heather and I
[49:23] uh went to New Zealand for the first
[49:25] time in 1972
[49:27] and and we went to a a a place I don't
[49:30] remember where it was but there was it
[49:32] was a Maui area and there was a church
[49:34] there and we went and saw the church and
[49:36] as you come up the church is all these
[49:38] carvings of all these demons and all
[49:40] these and the pulpit is held up by these
[49:43] strange creatures and I'm thinking wow
[49:47] they're they're trying to make
[49:49] Christianity palatable to this group of
[49:51] people but they're not taking out what
[49:54] needs to be taken out by Christianity
[49:57] so uh this sort of thing goes on all the
[50:00] time that was just a very graphic
[50:01] example to me it sort of jumped out well
[50:04] Zephaniah goes on and them that worship
[50:07] the host of Heaven upon the housetops
[50:10] the creation rather than the Creator
[50:12] evidence exists that worship of Astral
[50:15] deities the Sun the moon the stars was
[50:18] common in Judah in the seventh century
[50:21] BC and them that worship and that swear
[50:24] by the Lord and that also swear by m or
[50:27] moak or their Idol King and them that
[50:30] are turned back from the Lord lost their
[50:33] faith backslid we might say in our day
[50:37] and those that have not sought the Lord
[50:39] nor inquired for him agnostics and
[50:42] atheists as well are those that just
[50:45] don't care can't be bothered
[50:49] lukewarm notice this isn't the prophet
[50:53] reporting it's the prophet quoting the
[50:56] words of the
[50:58] Lord Jerusalem and its Temple were to be
[51:01] a beacon to the world instead they were
[51:04] crushed by the world worship of the Lord
[51:07] became that of religion rather than
[51:10] relationship from the head rather than
[51:13] from the heart it became polluted a
[51:16] cultural thing a
[51:19] tradition we must be careful as
[51:21] individuals that we don't go down that
[51:24] same path remember Psalm 1 from our
[51:26] previous lesson on neum avoid the
[51:29] counsel of the
[51:32] ungodly goes on the day of the Lord is
[51:36] near Zephaniah now tells of the day of
[51:39] the
[51:40] Lord understand that the word translated
[51:43] day can mean the daylight part of a day
[51:45] an entire day an unspecified period of
[51:49] time an era sometimes I hear well Day
[51:52] means a thousand years and it can but it
[51:55] can mean a lot of things so the day of
[51:58] the Lord is a period of time it's a time
[52:02] of judgment that goes far beyond Judah
[52:05] as we'll
[52:06] see verse seven hold thy peace at the
[52:10] presence of the Lord God for the day of
[52:12] the Lord is at hand for the Lord hath
[52:15] prepared a sacrifice he hath bid
[52:17] Sanctified his guests and it shall come
[52:20] to pass in the day of the Lord's
[52:22] sacrifice that I will punish the princes
[52:25] and the King's children children and all
[52:27] such as are clothed with strange
[52:30] apparel that's a curious
[52:33] phrase he has initial focus on the
[52:36] leaders that mislead the clothing refers
[52:40] to foreign clothes in other words
[52:41] they're no longer wearing the fringed
[52:43] garments as the Lord commanded through
[52:45] Moses I numbers 15 I'll read it in the
[52:48] NIV speak to the Israelites and say to
[52:52] them throughout the generations to come
[52:55] you are to make tassel on the corners of
[52:57] your garments with a blue cord on each
[53:00] tassel you will have these tassels to
[53:03] look at and so you will remember all the
[53:06] commands of the Lord that you may obey
[53:08] them and not prostitute yourselves by
[53:10] chasing after the lust of your own
[53:13] hearts and
[53:16] eyes all such as are clothed with
[53:19] strange apparel returning to
[53:22] Zephaniah and the same day also I will
[53:25] punish those that leap on hop over the
[53:29] threshold that's another strange
[53:32] one it's a way that worshippers passed
[53:35] into or out of the Temple of an idol
[53:37] they didn't step on the threshold they
[53:39] hopped over it it's kind of like when I
[53:41] was a kid oh step on a crack break your
[53:43] mother's back you know Superstition kind
[53:45] of stuff but that's how they entered and
[53:47] exited those places and that's what he's
[53:49] talking about so he's talking about Idol
[53:52] worshippers which fill their Master's
[53:54] houses with violence and deceit those
[53:57] that kill and steal threaten and plunder
[54:00] and it shall come to pass in that day
[54:02] saeth the Lord that there shall be the
[54:04] noise of a cry from the fish gate that's
[54:06] one of the Gates of Jerusalem and an
[54:08] howling from the second district and a
[54:11] great crashing from the hills all over
[54:13] Jerusalem and the surrounding territory
[54:16] howl the inhabitants of mesh another
[54:19] District of Jerusalem for all the
[54:21] merchant people are cut down all they
[54:24] that bear silver are cut off
[54:27] it shall come to pass at that time that
[54:29] I will search Jerusalem with candles I
[54:33] will painstakingly and search through
[54:37] every nook and
[54:39] cranny You Can't Hide and punish the men
[54:43] that are settled on their leaves kicking
[54:46] back another translation says that are
[54:48] stagnant in spirit that say in their
[54:51] heart the Lord will not do good neither
[54:54] will he do evil God doesn't care he
[54:57] doesn't do
[55:00] anything therefore their goods shall
[55:03] become a booty and their houses a
[55:06] desolation they also shall build houses
[55:09] but not inhabit them and they shall
[55:11] plant Vineyards but not drink the wine
[55:14] thereof the great day of the Lord is
[55:16] near it is near and hasteth greatly even
[55:18] the voice of the day of the Lord the
[55:22] mighty man shall cry there bitterly he
[55:25] goes on to Des described this time that
[55:29] day is a day of Wrath a day of trouble
[55:33] and
[55:34] distress a day of
[55:37] wastesson a day of darkness and
[55:41] gloominess a day of clouds and thick
[55:43] Darkness a day of the trumpet an alarm
[55:46] against the fence cities and against the
[55:48] high
[55:50] Towers I read that and I remembered as a
[55:54] kid I guess that's what I was when I was
[55:56] 16 I guess that's still a kid and Tucson
[56:00] we had just arrived here and I noticed
[56:02] on Saturday mornings in midm
[56:10] morning there were Air Raid
[56:12] Sirens the entire city you couldn't be
[56:14] anywhere in the City of Tucson and not
[56:16] hear that s in midm morning Saturday it
[56:19] was they were practicing for when the
[56:20] Russians were going to bomb the place it
[56:22] was the Cold War and of course what they
[56:24] were telling the Russians is uh if you
[56:26] want to hit us do it at 10:00 a.m. on
[56:28] Saturday when we're practicing our
[56:30] alarms because everybody knew if it's
[56:32] midday Saturday ignore the alarm right
[56:35] so he's talking about people blowing the
[56:37] trumpet sounding the alarm there's
[56:39] danger
[56:40] coming and I will bring to stress upon
[56:43] men and they shall walk like Blind
[56:46] Men why because they have sinned against
[56:49] the Lord and their blood shall be poured
[56:51] out as dust and their flesh as the dung
[56:57] neither their silver nor their gold
[56:59] shall be able to deliver them in the day
[57:01] of the Lord's wrath but the whole land
[57:04] shall be devoured by the fire of his
[57:06] jealousy he shall make even a speedy
[57:09] riddance of all them that dwell in the
[57:15] land
[57:17] wow but there's an
[57:20] invitation chapter
[57:23] 2 gather yourselves together yay gather
[57:27] together oh Nation not desired devoid of
[57:29] shame in your present State before the
[57:33] decree bring forth before the day passes
[57:37] the CHF before the fierce anger of the
[57:40] Lord come upon you before the day of the
[57:43] Lord's anger come upon you he's saying
[57:47] don't wait for this act now this phrase
[57:51] off Yahweh the Lord's anger occurs twice
[57:54] in this sentence it's EMP emphasized
[57:57] he's saying here's what you must do and
[58:00] don't wait do it now seek ye the Lord
[58:05] all ye Meek The Humble saintly gentle of
[58:08] the earth which have wrought his
[58:10] judgment performed his commands practice
[58:13] his ordinances act in compliance with
[58:17] his revealed will seek righteousness
[58:21] seek meekness it may be that you shall
[58:25] be hid and the day of the Lord's
[58:29] anger just like the Lord said he would
[58:31] seek with candles in every nook and
[58:33] cranny so the meek are told to seek the
[58:35] Lord before the day his wrath Falls he
[58:40] knows among the meek The Humble are
[58:43] those that have lived
[58:52] righteously judgment on judah's enemies
[58:57] here we see the Lord's anger is not only
[58:59] directed against the unrepentant of
[59:01] Judah but also on those that were
[59:03] judah's
[59:04] enemies he has not forgotten that even
[59:08] in his anger with Judah they are still
[59:11] the descendants of Abram through which
[59:13] he intends the nations of the earth to
[59:15] be blessed he will keep his promise to
[59:18] Abram in Genesis 12 he told him I will
[59:21] make of thee a great nation and I will
[59:23] bless thee and make thy name great Thou
[59:26] shalt be a
[59:27] blessing I will bless them that bless
[59:30] thee and curse him that curseth thee and
[59:35] in thee shall all the families of the
[59:38] earth be blessed Judah you've been
[59:41] misbehaving that doesn't give people the
[59:43] right to curse you to punish you to
[59:46] persecute you the rest of this chapter
[59:49] we'll see that the Lord is staying true
[59:51] to his promise to Abram so many
[59:52] centuries later verse four for Gaza
[59:56] shall be
[59:57] forsaken ashalon a desolation they shall
[1:00:01] drive out ashdot at the Noonday and
[1:00:03] erron shall be rooted
[1:00:06] up woe unto the inhabitants of the Sea
[1:00:09] Coast the nation of the carites the word
[1:00:12] of the Lord is against you oh Canaan the
[1:00:15] land of the Philistines I will even
[1:00:17] destroy thee that there shall be no
[1:00:21] inhabitant here's a a map of Israel I've
[1:00:26] circled the four cities that are
[1:00:29] mentioned in this prophecy these are
[1:00:31] four of the five Royal cities of the
[1:00:34] Philistines the fifth one not mentioned
[1:00:35] is
[1:00:37] gath I've also marked the boundary of
[1:00:39] the modern day Gaza Strip you can see
[1:00:42] that there is a lot of today in the
[1:00:45] words of zephaniah's
[1:00:48] Prophecy in the Sea Coast shall be
[1:00:50] dwellings and cottages for Shepherds and
[1:00:53] folds for flocks and the co G shall be
[1:00:56] for the remnant of the house of Judah
[1:00:59] and they shall feed thereup and the
[1:01:00] houses of ashalon shall they lie down in
[1:01:03] the evening for the Lord their God shall
[1:01:05] visit them and turn away their captivity
[1:01:08] restore their
[1:01:11] prosperity I have heard the reproach the
[1:01:14] insults the taunts of Moab and the
[1:01:17] revilings of the children of Aman
[1:01:20] whereby they have reproached they have
[1:01:21] mocked my people and magnified
[1:01:24] themselves against their border made
[1:01:25] made arrogant threats against their
[1:01:28] territory therefore as I live saith the
[1:01:31] Lord of hosts the god of Israel surely
[1:01:35] Moab shall be as Sodom and the children
[1:01:38] of Aman as Gomorrah even the breeding of
[1:01:42] nettles and salt pits and a Perpetual
[1:01:45] desolation the residue of my people
[1:01:47] shall spoil shall plunder them and the
[1:01:50] remnant of my people shall possess them
[1:01:53] the the background in the image of this
[1:01:56] slide is the Jordanian the Aman side of
[1:01:59] the Dead Sea you can see the salt there
[1:02:03] if you can see the barren Hills if you
[1:02:05] look up an aerial view of
[1:02:07] Jordan you'll see it's mostly desolate a
[1:02:10] Barren
[1:02:11] desert a Perpetual desolation to
[1:02:16] among this desolation shall they have
[1:02:20] earned for their pride because they have
[1:02:23] reproached and magnified themselves
[1:02:25] against the people of the Lord of hosts
[1:02:28] the Lord will be terrible unto them for
[1:02:30] he will famish all the gods of the earth
[1:02:33] men shall worship Him everyone from his
[1:02:36] place even all the Isles of the Heathen
[1:02:39] do you see yourself there isn't that
[1:02:41] what we're doing today worshiping the
[1:02:44] god of Israel all across the globe it's
[1:02:47] why we're here tonight we're fulfilling
[1:02:50] part of a prophecy of
[1:02:53] Zephaniah the Ethiopians also so ye
[1:02:56] shall be slain by my sword and again
[1:02:59] remembering Assyria and Nineveh he will
[1:03:02] stretch out his hand against the North
[1:03:05] and Destroy Assyria and will make
[1:03:08] Nineveh a desolation and dry like a
[1:03:12] Wilderness and now he describes the
[1:03:14] Desolation flocks shall lie down in the
[1:03:17] midst of her all the beasts of the
[1:03:19] Nations both the comat and the bitan
[1:03:21] shall Lodge in the upper lentil of it
[1:03:24] their voice shall sing in the Windows
[1:03:26] desolation shall be in the thresholds
[1:03:29] for he shall uncover the cedar work
[1:03:31] remember the
[1:03:32] thresholds the idol
[1:03:35] temples this is the rejoicing City that
[1:03:38] dwelt carelessly that said in her heart
[1:03:41] I am and there is none beside me how she
[1:03:45] has become a desolation a place for
[1:03:49] beasts to lie down and everyone that
[1:03:51] passes by her shall hiss and wag his
[1:03:53] hand
[1:03:55] I showed you this slide when we talked
[1:03:58] about knam we just read that flocks
[1:04:00] would lie down in the midst of Nineveh
[1:04:03] and they due to this day 2600 years
[1:04:06] after its destruction I've indicated the
[1:04:08] places where crops grow you can see the
[1:04:10] Green in there animals Graves and what
[1:04:13] was once the greatest city of Assyria
[1:04:20] Nineveh judgment on Jerusalem and the
[1:04:24] Nations the third and final chapter of
[1:04:26] the prophecy speaks of Jerusalem and all
[1:04:30] the nations first in
[1:04:32] judgment then in Hope and remember
[1:04:34] Nations it's not speaking about Portugal
[1:04:37] and Spain and Mexico and the United
[1:04:39] States and Cuba and Venezuela and
[1:04:42] Australia it's talking about peoples
[1:04:44] it's talking about ethnicities it's
[1:04:46] talking about Clans it's not talking
[1:04:49] about modern political borders as we
[1:04:51] think of
[1:04:52] Nations first in judgment then in Hope
[1:04:57] Zephaniah 3:1 woe to what sorrow awaits
[1:05:02] her that is filthy and polluted to the
[1:05:04] oppressing city he's speaking of
[1:05:07] Jerusalem she obeyed not the voice she
[1:05:10] received not correction she trusted not
[1:05:13] in the Lord she Drew not near to her God
[1:05:16] her princes within her are roaring Lions
[1:05:19] her judges are evening wolves they gnaw
[1:05:22] not at the bones till tomorrow they're
[1:05:24] so hungry so ravenous so so destructive
[1:05:26] they don't even leave the bones to chew
[1:05:28] on in the
[1:05:29] morning her prophets are light Reckless
[1:05:34] insolent and treacherous persons her
[1:05:36] priests have polluted the sanctuary they
[1:05:40] have done violence to the law
[1:05:42] substituting their words for
[1:05:45] Gods the just Lord is in the midst
[1:05:48] thereof he will not do iniquity every
[1:05:50] morning do he bring his judgment to
[1:05:52] light he faileth not but the unjust
[1:05:56] knoweth no shame Here I Am the Lord is
[1:05:59] saying but you ignore and avoid me to
[1:06:03] your
[1:06:04] hurt I have cut off the Nations their
[1:06:08] towers are desolate I made their streets
[1:06:11] waste that none passes by their cities
[1:06:14] are destroyed so there is no man there
[1:06:17] is no inhabitant they lie and Silent
[1:06:21] ruin I said surely thou wil fear me thou
[1:06:25] Willl respect me that will honor me that
[1:06:27] will receive
[1:06:28] instruction remember Psalms 19 James 1
[1:06:32] from last Sunday so their dwellings
[1:06:34] should not be cut off howsoever I punish
[1:06:37] them but they Rose early and corrupted
[1:06:41] all their
[1:06:43] doings therefore wait ye upon me sayeth
[1:06:46] the Lord until the day that I Rise up to
[1:06:48] the prey for my determination is to
[1:06:52] gather the Nations that I may assemble
[1:06:54] the kingdoms to pour out upon them mine
[1:06:57] indignation even all my Fierce anger for
[1:07:00] all the Earth shall be devoured with the
[1:07:02] fire of my
[1:07:06] jealousy and now comes hope and promise
[1:07:11] for the
[1:07:12] future Zephaniah 3 for then verse N I
[1:07:17] will turn to the people a pure language
[1:07:20] that they may all call upon the name of
[1:07:22] the Lord to serve him with one one
[1:07:26] consent Unity from Beyond the rivers of
[1:07:30] Ethiopia my suppliance my worshippers
[1:07:32] those who pray to me even the daughter
[1:07:34] of my dispersed shall bring mine
[1:07:37] offering and that day Thou shalt not be
[1:07:40] ashamed for all thy doings wherein thou
[1:07:42] Hast transgressed against me for then I
[1:07:45] will take away out of the midst of thee
[1:07:47] them that rejoice in thy pride and thou
[1:07:50] shalt no more be hauy because of my Holy
[1:07:53] Mountain
[1:07:56] we have the temple is what they said in
[1:07:58] their
[1:07:59] pride we have the temple they have
[1:08:02] forgotten the god of the temple but we
[1:08:05] have the temple today what do we hear we
[1:08:07] have the message we have the
[1:08:09] Revelation I thank God for the words
[1:08:12] we've received but there is no place for
[1:08:15] Spiritual Pride never blessed are the
[1:08:19] meek The Humble not the proud and
[1:08:23] arrogant
[1:08:25] I will also leave in the midst of thee
[1:08:27] and Afflicted and poor people the meek
[1:08:30] and humble and they shall Trust In The
[1:08:33] Name Of The Lord the remnant of Israel
[1:08:36] shall not do iniquity nor speak lies
[1:08:40] neither shall a deceitful tongue be
[1:08:41] found in their mouth for they shall feed
[1:08:44] and lie down and None Shall make them
[1:08:49] afraid and finally Israel's joy and
[1:08:54] restoration
[1:08:55] the final portion of the
[1:08:57] prophecy and watch how it starts not
[1:09:00] with wait and then do this but do this
[1:09:02] while you're awaiting do what
[1:09:07] [Music]
[1:09:08] sing shout O
[1:09:12] [Music]
[1:09:18] israad Lord taken away thy judgments he
[1:09:23] ha cast out th
[1:09:25] eny the K
[1:09:30] [Music]
[1:09:32] ofid Thou shalt not see evil anymore and
[1:09:37] that day it shall be said to Jerusalem
[1:09:40] fear thou not and to Zion let not thine
[1:09:43] hands be slack hanging down listless
[1:09:46] limp the Lord thy God in the midst of
[1:09:48] thee is right there with you and he is
[1:09:52] mighty he will save he will rejoice over
[1:09:55] the with joy he will rest rest he will
[1:09:59] be silent about your past sins rest in
[1:10:02] his love he will Joy over thee with
[1:10:05] singing I will gather them that are
[1:10:07] sorrowful for the solemn assembly who
[1:10:10] are to thee who are of thee to whom the
[1:10:13] reproach of it was a burden behold at
[1:10:16] that time I will undo all that afflict
[1:10:19] Thee I will save her that is lame gather
[1:10:22] her that was exiled and I will get them
[1:10:25] praise and fame in every land where they
[1:10:27] have been mocked and put to
[1:10:30] shame at that time will I bring you
[1:10:33] again even in the time that I gather you
[1:10:36] for I will make you a name and a praise
[1:10:39] among all people of the earth when I
[1:10:41] turn back your captivity when I restore
[1:10:44] you before your eyes saith the
[1:10:49] Lord we see at least two threads here
[1:10:53] the first one short term is judgment on
[1:10:56] Assyria 612 BC Judah 3 years later 609
[1:11:02] BC and
[1:11:03] Jerusalem destroyed
[1:11:06] burned destruction 586
[1:11:09] BC the second thread is
[1:11:12] longterm far in the future from
[1:11:14] zephaniah's time called the day of the
[1:11:18] Lord this is when all peoples of the
[1:11:20] Earth are judged the people of Israel
[1:11:23] restored
[1:11:25] we see what may be some beginning
[1:11:27] elements of that in our
[1:11:32] day two things strike me as lessons that
[1:11:35] we can apply to our lives today from
[1:11:39] Zephaniah the first has to do with our
[1:11:43] worship going back to Zephaniah 1
[1:11:47] verse4 I will also stretch out my hand
[1:11:50] upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants
[1:11:52] of Jerusalem and I will cut off who the
[1:11:56] remnant of Baal from this place the name
[1:11:59] of the hamams with their priests and
[1:12:01] them that worship the host of Heaven
[1:12:03] upon the housetops and them that worship
[1:12:05] and that swear by the Lord and that also
[1:12:08] swear by malem and them that are turned
[1:12:11] back from the Lord and those that have
[1:12:13] not sought the Lord nor inquired for
[1:12:16] him the Lord demands our
[1:12:19] worship our love because he first loved
[1:12:23] us but he does not not want to be our
[1:12:26] part-time spiritual
[1:12:28] partner nor does he want to share us
[1:12:30] with other deities real or
[1:12:34] imagined Paul wrote about this as well
[1:12:37] I'm going to display the King James for
[1:12:38] you to follow but I'll read from the
[1:12:40] complete Jewish Bible translation as I
[1:12:42] think parts of it are a bit
[1:12:43] clearer Colossians chapter 2 verse 8
[1:12:48] watch out so that no one will take you
[1:12:51] captive by means of philosophy and empty
[1:12:53] deceit following human tradition which
[1:12:56] Accords with the elemental spirits of
[1:12:58] the world but does not Accord with a
[1:13:02] messiah speaking of private Revelations
[1:13:05] and contrived doctrines skipping to
[1:13:08] verse 18 don't let anyone deny you the
[1:13:11] prize by insisting that you engage in
[1:13:13] self mortification or Angel worship
[1:13:17] Angel worship such people are always
[1:13:20] going on about some Vision they have had
[1:13:22] and they vainly puff themselves up by
[1:13:24] their words worldly Outlook they fail to
[1:13:27] hold to the Head Christ from whom the
[1:13:30] whole body receiving Supply and being
[1:13:32] held together by its joints and
[1:13:34] ligaments grows as God makes it grow if
[1:13:38] along with a messiah you died to the
[1:13:40] elemental spirits of the world then why
[1:13:43] as if you still belong to the world are
[1:13:46] you letting yourselves be bothered by
[1:13:48] its
[1:13:49] rules don't touch this oh don't eat that
[1:13:52] don't handle the other such prohibitions
[1:13:55] are concerned with things meant to
[1:13:56] perish by being used they're going to
[1:13:58] wear out not by being avoided and here's
[1:14:01] the key they are based on man-made rules
[1:14:06] and
[1:14:07] teachings they do indeed have the
[1:14:09] outward appearance of wisdom with their
[1:14:11] self-imposed religious observances false
[1:14:13] humility and asceticism but they have no
[1:14:16] value at all in restraining people from
[1:14:18] indulging in their old nature if the
[1:14:21] musicians would please come at this time
[1:14:25] John's gospel tells us that Jesus said
[1:14:28] John
[1:14:28] 4:23 but the hour cometh and now is when
[1:14:33] the true worshippers shall worship the
[1:14:36] father in spirit and in truth for the
[1:14:39] father seeketh such to worship Him and
[1:14:43] in John 14 we read Jesus saith unto him
[1:14:47] I am the way the truth and the life no
[1:14:52] man cometh unto the father but but by
[1:14:56] me again emphasizing pure worship not
[1:14:59] mixed with cultural and man-made ideas
[1:15:01] of
[1:15:02] religion well when should we do all of
[1:15:06] these things let's go back to Zephaniah
[1:15:09] chapter 2 and verse one gather
[1:15:13] yourselves together yeah gather together
[1:15:15] oh Nation not desired before the decree
[1:15:18] bring forth before the day passes the
[1:15:21] chaff before the fierce anger of the
[1:15:24] Lord come upon you you before the day of
[1:15:26] the Lord's anger come upon you don't
[1:15:28] wait act now here's what you must do
[1:15:33] now seek ye the Lord all ye Meek of the

[1:15:48] you shall be hid in the day of the
[1:15:51] Lord's
[1:15:52] anger seek the Lord
[1:15:55] seek
[1:15:57] righteousness a right relationship with
[1:15:59] the Lord
[1:16:00] relationship not
