[49:37] 15 talking about the Lord Jesus it says
[49:40] here and they brought unto him also
[49:42] infants that he would touch them but
[49:45] when his disciples saw it they rebuked
[49:48] them but Jesus called them unto him and
[49:52] he said suffer the little children to
[49:55] come to me and forbid them not for such
[50:01] is the kingdom of
[50:02] God Mark tells the same story and he
[50:06] says he Mark says and they brought young
[50:10] children to him that he should touch
[50:12] them and he took them up in his arms and
[50:16] put his hands on them and blessed them
[50:19] verse 17 out of Luke verily I say unto
[50:21] you Jesus speaking whosoever shall not
[50:24] receive the kingdom of God as a little
[50:28] child shall in no wise enter therein
[50:33] friends all children every birth comes
[50:37] from God every birth is a gift from God
[50:40] they are brought in this world
[50:44] dependent on their mother on their
[50:46] father on their family to teach them

[57:15] children up here and I believe that the
[57:16] Lord has special things in
[57:19] store let's turn in the
[57:22] scriptures my sermon today is is is
[57:25] based on an experience I had a few years
[57:28] ago something a friend of mine said to
[57:30] me and um it's based on a
[57:34] scripture from
[57:36] Hebrews um it's about the
[57:40] sins these sins that so easily beset us
[57:44] I want to start in 1 Corinthians chapter
[57:46] 6:9 and then I'm going to go through
[57:48] scriptures fairly quickly but I'm I'm
[57:50] reading these to lay a
[57:52] foundation for my message this morning
[57:55] morning says this know ye not that the
[57:59] unrighteous shall not inherit the
[58:01] kingdom of God be not
[58:04] deceived neither fornicators nor
[58:07] idolators nor
[58:09] adulterers nor
[58:11] effeminate effeminate homosexual nor
[58:14] abusers of themselves with
[58:16] mankind nor thieves nor Covetous nor
[58:20] drunkers nor reelers nor extortioners
[58:23] shall inherit
[58:25] the kingdom of
[58:26] God and such were some of you but you
[58:31] are washed but you are Sanctified but ye
[58:33] are justified in the name of the Lord
[58:35] Jesus and by the spirit of our God all
[58:39] things are lawful unto me but all things
[58:41] are not expedient all things are lawful
[58:44] for me but I will not be brought under
[58:46] the power of
[58:47] any Meats for the belly and belly for
[58:50] the meats but God shall destroy both it
[58:52] and them now the body is not for
[58:55] fornication but for the Lord and the
[58:57] Lord for the body and God hath both
[59:00] raised up the Lord and will also raise
[59:02] up Us by his own
[59:05] power I'll skip to
[59:10] uh let's skip to the next the next um
[59:15] the next scripture which is Proverbs
[59:17] chapter 6 verse 16 it says this these
[59:20] things do the Lord hate yay seven are in
[59:24] an abomination a unto him a proud look a
[59:27] lying
[59:28] tongue hands that shed innocent blood a
[59:31] heart that deviseth Wicked
[59:34] imaginations feet that be Swift in
[59:36] running to
[59:37] Mischief a false witness that speaketh
[59:41] lies and he that sth
[59:43] Discord among
[59:46] Brethren Colossians chapter 3 verse 11
[59:50] says this where there is neither Greek
[59:53] nor Jew circumcised ision nor
[59:55] uncircumcision Barbarian schian Bond or
[59:58] free but Christ is all and in all put on
[1:00:02] therefore as the elect of God holy and
[1:00:04] beloved bowels of mercies kindness
[1:00:07] humbleness of Mind meekness
[1:00:10] longsuffering forbearing one another and
[1:00:13] forgiving one another If any man have a
[1:00:17] quarrel against any even as Christ
[1:00:21] forgave you so also do do ye and above
[1:00:27] all these things put on charity which is
[1:00:30] the bond of per of perfectness that
[1:00:33] charity means Modern English means love
[1:00:36] and let the peace of God rule in your
[1:00:38] hearts to the which also ye are called
[1:00:41] in one body and be ye thankful let's go
[1:00:45] to Ephesians chapter 4 verse 26 it says
[1:00:49] this be ye angry and sin not let not the
[1:00:53] sun go down upon on your wrath neither
[1:00:55] give place to the
[1:00:58] devil let him that stole steal no more
[1:01:01] but rather let him labor working with
[1:01:03] his hands the thing which is good that
[1:01:06] he may have to give to him that
[1:01:09] needeth look at the big purpose of
[1:01:11] working there is that so you can give it
[1:01:15] away let no corrupt communication
[1:01:18] proceed out of your
[1:01:20] mouth but that which is good to the use
[1:01:23] of edifying that it may Minister Grace
[1:01:26] unto the hearers remember edifying is
[1:01:28] building
[1:01:30] up and grieve not the holy spirit of
[1:01:33] God whereby you are sealed unto the day
[1:01:36] of your Redemption let all
[1:01:38] bitterness and
[1:01:40] wrath and
[1:01:42] anger and clamor and evil speaking be
[1:01:46] put away from you with all
[1:01:48] malice and be you kind one to another
[1:01:53] tenderhearted forgive one another even
[1:01:55] as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven
[1:01:59] you these are the Commandments of the
[1:02:02] Lord through these different scriptures
[1:02:04] and finally the Lord Jesus said this in
[1:02:07] St John
[1:02:11] 14:21 he that hath my Commandments and
[1:02:13] keepeth them he it is that loveth me and
[1:02:18] he that loveth me shall be loved of my
[1:02:21] father and I will love him and will
[1:02:24] manifest myself to him Judas saith unto
[1:02:27] him not is Carrot Lord how is it that
[1:02:32] thou wi manifest thyself unto us and not
[1:02:35] to the
[1:02:36] world the disciples asking Jesus how he
[1:02:40] is going to manifest himself to the
[1:02:42] chosen people and then Jesus turns right
[1:02:45] about right back around to his disciple
[1:02:48] and puts the burden on the
[1:02:50] disciple Jesus answered and said unto
[1:02:53] him if a man loves me he will keep my
[1:02:57] words do you believe this is his
[1:03:01] words he will keep my words and my
[1:03:04] father will love him and we will come
[1:03:07] unto him and make our Abode with him he
[1:03:11] that loveth me not keepeth not my
[1:03:14] sayings and the word which ye hear is
[1:03:17] not mine but the fathers which sent
[1:03:21] me again my sermon it's titled here the
[1:03:25] sins that so easily beset us I was out
[1:03:28] for a walk with a friend of mine when I
[1:03:30] was in the ministry in
[1:03:32] Jeffersonville and uh during lunch
[1:03:34] during a lunch break and we were talking
[1:03:36] I can't remember what the exact
[1:03:38] conversation was but we were talking
[1:03:41] about some of the sins that um that that
[1:03:44] people had
[1:03:45] done and he made this statement to
[1:03:48] me he said this he said we all have our
[1:03:53] vices
[1:03:55] Vice is a
[1:03:58] sin and when he said that kind of kind
[1:04:02] of struck
[1:04:04] me and I didn't like the
[1:04:07] statement I didn't like it at all kind
[1:04:09] of gave me the creeps like well we all
[1:04:12] we we all have these
[1:04:14] sins and uh and it bothered
[1:04:17] me and so I was I thought about that for
[1:04:22] years now that we all have our sins we
[1:04:25] all have these things in our lives that
[1:04:27] that we do that maybe we know we do that
[1:04:30] we shouldn't be
[1:04:31] doing and I want to read a
[1:04:34] story about a man that had those sins in
[1:04:38] his
[1:04:38] life and he didn't take care of him go
[1:04:42] to Luke chapter
[1:04:46] 19 I'm sorry Luke chapter 16 verse
[1:04:50] 19 it says this there was a certain rich
[1:04:54] man man which was clothed in purple and
[1:04:57] fine linen and fared sumptuously every
[1:05:01] year that sumptuously means
[1:05:03] extravagantly he was a very rich
[1:05:08] man and there was a certain beggar named
[1:05:11] Lazarus which was laid at his gate full
[1:05:15] of sores and Desiring to be fed with the
[1:05:18] crumbs which fell from the rich man's
[1:05:22] table moreover the dog came and licked
[1:05:25] his sores very very poor man
[1:05:29] Street
[1:05:31] person and it came to pass that the
[1:05:33] beggar died and was carried by the
[1:05:36] Angels into Abraham's
[1:05:39] bosom the rich man also died and was
[1:05:43] buried and in hell this rich man and in
[1:05:47] hell he lifted up his eyes being in
[1:05:50] torments and seeth Abraham a far off and
[1:05:54] and Lazarus the homeless man the poor
[1:05:57] man in his
[1:05:59] bosom and he cried and said Father
[1:06:03] Abraham have mercy on me and send
[1:06:06] Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his
[1:06:09] finger in water and cool my tongue for I
[1:06:13] am in torment in this
[1:06:16] flame notice he is calling Abraham his
[1:06:22] father he is what we would call call a
[1:06:25] son of
[1:06:26] Abraham know we have we sing the song
[1:06:30] that we are all spiritual sons of
[1:06:32] Abraham the faith that Abraham had had
[1:06:35] and the promise that God gave Abraham
[1:06:38] and we say we are his sons and here is
[1:06:40] this man in hell and he is claiming that
[1:06:42] I am a son of Abraham and yet I'm in
[1:06:47] hell send this poor man just to dip his
[1:06:50] finger in water and cool this Burning
[1:06:55] the
[1:06:57] suffering but Abraham
[1:06:59] said
[1:07:01] [Music]
[1:07:03] Son
[1:07:05] remember that thou in thy lifetime
[1:07:07] receivest thy receivest thyy good things
[1:07:11] and likewise Lazarus evil things but now
[1:07:14] he is comforted and thou art
[1:07:18] tormented and beside all this between us
[1:07:23] and you
[1:07:25] there is a great Gulf fixed so that they
[1:07:28] which would pass from hence to you
[1:07:30] cannot this there's no passing this this
[1:07:33] gulf that's between us neither can they
[1:07:36] pass us that would come from the hence
[1:07:38] so you can't send anybody here and we
[1:07:41] can't send anybody down
[1:07:43] there this gulf is not crossable and
[1:07:47] that is the sin that was in this man's
[1:07:49] life has created this
[1:07:52] gulf
[1:07:54] we're not told what this what this sin
[1:07:57] is but soon we're going to hear a
[1:08:00] similar story about another man that we
[1:08:03] do know what his sin
[1:08:05] was brother
[1:08:07] brandom tells us that this man that we
[1:08:11] are reading about right now is the same
[1:08:14] man that I am going to read about here
[1:08:17] in a couple chapters later in the Book
[1:08:19] of
[1:08:20] Luke many scholars say that he's the
[1:08:23] same man that this was a prophecy from
[1:08:27] the Lord Jesus saying here's what's
[1:08:29] going to happen to this man that's to
[1:08:36] come in fact this
[1:08:39] man in this
[1:08:41] story had a spirit of a
[1:08:44] minister he had a spirit of an
[1:08:47] evangelist there he is in hell with the
[1:08:51] same Ministry wanting to come out from
[1:08:53] him
[1:08:54] how do we know that verse number
[1:08:57] 27 then he said I pray thee therefore
[1:09:01] the man that's in hell I pray thee
[1:09:03] therefore father that thou would us
[1:09:06] send him to my father's
[1:09:10] house he's asking to send the beggar
[1:09:13] named Lazarus to his home to his living
[1:09:17] family for I have five Brethren that he
[1:09:20] may testify unto them lest they also
[1:09:23] come in into this place of
[1:09:25] Torment so there he is this man in hell
[1:09:28] and he is worried about his family that
[1:09:32] they're going to end up in the same
[1:09:34] place he is this is a horrible
[1:09:38] story he's trying to keep his loved ones
[1:09:41] out and he wants to warn
[1:09:44] them Abraham saith unto him they have
[1:09:49] Moses and the
[1:09:50] prophets let them
[1:09:54] hear
[1:09:56] them so Abraham said he he says they
[1:09:59] have Moses they have the prophets
[1:10:02] they've got a Bible they've got
[1:10:05] prophets they should be able to find
[1:10:07] their salvation in the word of
[1:10:12] God and he said no Father Abraham but if
[1:10:17] one went unto them from the dead they
[1:10:21] will repent he's saying that if there
[1:10:23] was a miracle if someone if this Lazarus
[1:10:27] would rise from the dead and they would
[1:10:29] see Lazarus rise from the dead and
[1:10:31] Lazarus went over to his family to his
[1:10:34] brothers and said repent stop sinning
[1:10:37] then they would believe it how many of
[1:10:40] us had said the same thing if I would
[1:10:43] just see a miracle if I would just see a
[1:10:46] supernatural thing happen then I would
[1:10:48] know that this is
[1:10:51] right and this man that's in the in hell
[1:10:55] right now he is saying if you would just
[1:10:57] sin this then they would believe now
[1:11:00] watch
[1:11:01] Abraham's
[1:11:03] response and he said unto him if they
[1:11:06] hear not Moses and the
[1:11:08] prophets neither will they be pers
[1:11:12] persuaded though one rose from the
[1:11:17] dead he's saying that the Bible is
[1:11:19] sitting in front of
[1:11:21] them telling them not to lie
[1:11:25] Not to cause Discord among Believers not
[1:11:27] to lose your temper even if you devise
[1:11:30] something in your
[1:11:33] mind that someone is doing wrong
[1:11:35] Proverbs 6:18 the seven things that God
[1:11:39] hates then you are sinning all of those
[1:11:42] sins that I read earlier in those
[1:11:47] scriptures yet they still won't
[1:11:49] repent you can read it right here that
[1:11:52] you are sinning
[1:11:55] but yet we still continue on in our
[1:11:59] sins and we don't
[1:12:01] repent and here is this man he's in hell
[1:12:04] and he's crying out don't come where
[1:12:06] I've come repent of what you've been
[1:12:09] doing and Abraham says listen no matter
[1:12:13] what happens they're going to continue
[1:12:15] on doing what they're
[1:12:19] doing now again
[1:12:24] we believe that this man that was in
[1:12:30] Hell he's
[1:12:32] mentioned here in a couple scriptures a
[1:12:35] couple uh verses or a couple chapters
[1:12:39] later and I had it on my
[1:12:42] heart it's really a neat testimony I had
[1:12:46] in my heart as I was as I was thinking
[1:12:48] about this and I was praying like Lord I
[1:12:51] see so much sin I see so so many things
[1:12:53] going
[1:12:55] wrong and people will not they're going
[1:12:57] to continue what they're doing no matter
[1:13:00] what I say no matter what your Bible
[1:13:02] says they just continue on because they
[1:13:06] want
[1:13:07] it and I
[1:13:09] was praying about that I was just
[1:13:11] troubled this week and I believe the
[1:13:14] Lord laid on my heart two
[1:13:17] stories and it's amazing how these two
[1:13:19] stories go together and I I look them
[1:13:22] both up and they're in the same chapter
[1:13:25] Luke chapter
[1:13:27] 18 verse
[1:13:29] 9 now one thing I want to point out is
[1:13:32] there is a difference between a
[1:13:35] parable and something that actually
[1:13:38] happened a parable is a story that Jesus
[1:13:44] uses to prove a point to prove a
[1:13:49] narrative and it's not a literal not
[1:13:52] necessarily a literal occurrence but
[1:13:55] then there are things that actually
[1:13:56] happened so we're going to see here
[1:13:59] we're going to see a parable and then
[1:14:00] we're going to see something that
[1:14:02] actually
[1:14:03] happened and he spake this Parable unto
[1:14:07] certain which trusted themselves that
[1:14:09] they were righteous and despised
[1:14:15] others
[1:14:18] so he's talking about a self-righteous
[1:14:21] person now Daniel was telling me a story
[1:14:25] about a coworker that he has she grew up
[1:14:28] in a Catholic boarding
[1:14:30] school and she was telling Daniel she
[1:14:34] she said I don't want anything to do
[1:14:37] with church I I haven't since I got out
[1:14:39] of that school she said because
[1:14:42] everything that I
[1:14:43] did they were always telling me I was
[1:14:46] going to
[1:14:47] hell you do this you're going to hell
[1:14:50] and the young lady no matter how hard
[1:14:51] she tried
[1:14:54] she was always condemned by the
[1:14:56] nuns you're going to go to hell and she
[1:14:59] said why do I even
[1:15:01] try and she tells Daniel she says I
[1:15:04] believe in
[1:15:05] God but I don't want anything to do with
[1:15:08] the
[1:15:09] church because I'm always
[1:15:12] condemned we need to be careful always
[1:15:15] condemning but it doesn't mean that we
[1:15:17] don't point out
[1:15:19] sin my job is to bring the sin to you
[1:15:25] now you deal with it because you're the
[1:15:27] one in the situation I have no right to
[1:15:30] condemn because every time I point my
[1:15:32] finger at somebody out in this audience
[1:15:34] there's a lot more ping fingers point
[1:15:36] right back at
[1:15:38] me because I am I need the grace of
[1:15:46] God verse number 10 two wom went two men
[1:15:51] went up into the temple to pray
[1:15:54] the one a Pharisee and the other a
[1:15:56] Publican Pharisees is a minister as we
[1:15:59] know Publican is a Tax Collector someone
[1:16:03] who was generally thought of as a
[1:16:04] traitor cheater Lo
[1:16:08] life the Pharisees stood and prayed thus
[1:16:11] within himself God I thank thee that I
[1:16:14] am not as other men
[1:16:18] are extortioners unjust
[1:16:22] adulterers remember the scripture I just
[1:16:24] said where Paul said these people
[1:16:26] wouldn't enter into the kingdom of
[1:16:27] heaven and he's saying I'm thankful that
[1:16:29] I'm not like that I'm not an extortioner
[1:16:33] I'm not unjust I'm not an adulterer or
[1:16:35] I'm not even like this guy over here
[1:16:37] this
[1:16:38] Publican I fast twice a
[1:16:41] week I give tithes of all that I
[1:16:44] possess and the Publican standing a far
[1:16:48] off would not lift up so much as his
[1:16:51] eyes in under heaven
[1:16:53] heaven but smoked upon his breast saying
[1:16:57] God be merciful to me a
[1:17:00] sinner so we have two right here we have
[1:17:03] one saying I'm thankful that I'm not
[1:17:05] like all of these other people that
[1:17:06] aren't that aren't doing like they
[1:17:08] should and then we have this other guy
[1:17:10] saying I'm not even worthy to look up to
[1:17:12] heaven I'm going to look down at the
[1:17:14] ground from where I
[1:17:20] came I tell you Jesus is speaking this
[1:17:24] man went down to his house
[1:17:28] Justified the man that smote himself in
[1:17:31] the chest the man that said Lord I'm a
[1:17:35] sinner rather than the
[1:17:38] other for everyone that exalteth him s
[1:17:42] shall be abased and he that humble
[1:17:44] himself shall be exalted look at the
[1:17:46] difference between the two men one man
[1:17:49] had far more sin in his life yet he was
[1:17:51] justified you know you know what
[1:17:53] Justified means Justified doesn't mean
[1:17:55] forgiven of your
[1:17:57] sins Justified means that that sin
[1:18:00] wasn't even there you didn't even do
[1:18:03] it I can for if brother Aaron does me
[1:18:05] wrong I can forgive him for doing that
[1:18:08] but in my mind I always remember that
[1:18:09] brother Aaron did me
[1:18:11] wrong when he is
[1:18:14] Justified brother Aaron didn't do
[1:18:16] anything wrong and that's how this man
[1:18:20] this sinner man came he came lowly and
[1:18:23] he left Justified completely cleansed
[1:18:26] the other man
[1:18:30] didn't now that was a story Jesus tells
[1:18:34] now I want to tell you real quick about
[1:18:36] an amazing
[1:18:37] coincidence when I had on my
[1:18:40] heart to minister on these two stories
[1:18:44] which is the Rick Rich Young Ruler and
[1:18:48] this that I just told this Parable that
[1:18:50] I just told I had him in my my
[1:18:54] mind and I looked and I said oh they're
[1:18:57] in the same
[1:18:59] chapter amazing so I looked and and
[1:19:03] there was the first part that I just
[1:19:06] read and then there were three
[1:19:09] verses and then it starts
[1:19:14] up in three verses later in verse
[1:19:19] 18 it's amazing to me brother Lionel
[1:19:23] that the three verses that I skipped
[1:19:26] were the three verses that I read for
[1:19:29] dedicating babies this
[1:19:32] morning verse number
[1:19:35] 18 and a certain rule ruler asked him
[1:19:39] now this is not a
[1:19:41] parable this happened in flesh and blood
[1:19:46] and a certain ruler asked him saying
[1:19:47] good Master what shall I do to inherit
[1:19:51] eternal life and Jesus Jesus said unto
[1:19:53] him why callest thou me good none is
[1:19:55] good save one that is God thou knowest
[1:19:58] the Commandments do not commit adultery
[1:20:00] do not kill do not steal do not bear
[1:20:02] false witness honor thy father and thy
[1:20:04] mother he's quoting The Ten Commandments
[1:20:06] he's quoting the law of Moses which
[1:20:08] we'll hear more about tonight in The
[1:20:10] Book of Leviticus brother Lyall started
[1:20:12] it on Wednesday about the law now we're
[1:20:14] going to hear more tonight about this
[1:20:16] law and that's what he's quoting he says
[1:20:18] you know how to live right it's written
[1:20:20] in your
[1:20:21] Bible
[1:20:24] and the young man said this he said all
[1:20:26] these I have kept from my youth
[1:20:29] up when Jesus heard these things he said
[1:20:33] unto
[1:20:34] him now The Book of Mark I believe all
[1:20:38] the sna the gospels Matthew Mark and
[1:20:40] Luke all tell this story
[1:20:44] Mark says the same story and he says
[1:20:47] that Jesus looked at him and loved him
[1:20:51] this young man
[1:20:57] yet lackest thou one thing yeah you've
[1:21:00] done all these things you've lived a
[1:21:01] good life you you've been raised right
[1:21:03] you haven't sinned you haven't ran with
[1:21:05] wrong girls you haven't you haven't lied
[1:21:07] you haven't cheated you haven't done all
[1:21:08] these things you've honored your father
[1:21:09] and your mother but you're lacking
[1:21:12] something sell all that thou Hast and
[1:21:15] distribute unto the poor and thou shalt
[1:21:18] have Tre Treasures in Heaven and come
[1:21:21] follow me
[1:21:26] and when he heard this he was very
[1:21:28] sorrowful for he was very rich and when
[1:21:30] Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful he
[1:21:32] said how hardly shall they that receive
[1:21:35] that have riches enter into the kingdom
[1:21:37] of God this young man we don't even know
[1:21:40] his
[1:21:42] name but what a what a very sad story
[1:21:46] that's in the Bible is this young man
[1:21:49] came to Jesus in another place it says
[1:21:51] that he bowed down a knee he bowed on
[1:21:53] his knee before him and he said what
[1:21:55] must I
[1:21:56] do to inherit this
[1:21:59] Kingdom Jesus loved
[1:22:02] him and Jesus looked and in the love
[1:22:05] that God has he looked and he saw that
[1:22:07] you have something wrong you have a
[1:22:11] vice there's something in your life
[1:22:14] that's going to keep you out of
[1:22:17] Heaven one thing let me tell you who
[1:22:20] this young man was this young man was
[1:22:22] well respected in his
[1:22:24] church he was a very giving person if he
[1:22:28] was in our congregation today this young
[1:22:31] man would want to be one of the most
[1:22:33] highly respected people in this
[1:22:36] congregation and
[1:22:38] yet he lifted up his eyes in
[1:22:42] Hell
[1:22:44] asking that Abraham would send this
[1:22:47] beggar to witness to his
[1:22:51] brothers
[1:22:53] one sin one Vice that this young man
[1:23:01] had he
[1:23:05] coveted his
[1:23:07] money and Jesus saw he saw the long term
[1:23:11] you know the the Rich Young Ruler
[1:23:13] probably looked at at these disciples
[1:23:14] said I don't want to be like them
[1:23:15] they're
[1:23:16] poor I don't want to be like this
[1:23:18] Lazarus over here this beggar he's poor
[1:23:21] if I sell everything then what I have
[1:23:23] imagine what he gave up right
[1:23:26] there he would have been probably
[1:23:29] numbered with one of the
[1:23:31] disciples we don't even know his
[1:23:34] name but we have these disciples they
[1:23:37] were they became the greatest people on
[1:23:39] Earth and here is this man Jesus looks
[1:23:42] down on him and loves him and sees that
[1:23:44] he is going to make the wrong
[1:23:46] decision because of one thing one Vice
[1:23:50] that this young man had and it doesn't
[1:23:52] even seem like it's that big of a deal
[1:23:54] but it sent him to
[1:23:55] hell when I was a
[1:23:58] kid
[1:24:00] um watched this movie it messed me up um
[1:24:05] it was called it was a it was back then
[1:24:08] it was a cartoon it's called Lord of the
[1:24:09] Rings everybody's heard about it written
[1:24:12] by I believe as a Christian Author I
[1:24:14] read the books in school and there was
[1:24:17] this character in that movie and I know
[1:24:21] there's there's more modern versions of
[1:24:23] it creepy little
[1:24:26] guy and he
[1:24:29] had his
[1:24:31] vice was a
[1:24:34] ring and everything in his life centered
[1:24:39] around this ring and he coveted it and
[1:24:41] he loved this ring so much that he
[1:24:43] called it his
[1:24:45] precious one
[1:24:47] thing tormented that
[1:24:51] being
[1:24:53] and ruined his
[1:24:55] life and here we have this Rich Young
[1:24:58] Ruler and he's coveting this thing and I
[1:25:01] look out at this audience and how many
[1:25:03] of us have something in our lives or or
[1:25:06] other things that we covet more than we
[1:25:09] covet the word of
[1:25:12] God and it'll ruin our lives one little
[1:25:15] thing oh it's not that big of a deal it
[1:25:16] is a big
[1:25:18] deal it may be
[1:25:21] money it may be the way you
[1:25:25] dress it may be
[1:25:28] drinking it doesn't have to be drugs and
[1:25:33] prostitution it may be
[1:25:35] pornography it may be
[1:25:38] lying and maybe running to mischief and
[1:25:41] getting in the
[1:25:43] gossip it could be anything that will
[1:25:46] send us to Hell one
[1:25:49] thing with this Rich Young Ruler it was
[1:25:52] one
[1:25:53] thing that sent him to hell and these
[1:25:56] disciples they're watching
[1:25:58] Jesus like whoow they see what an
[1:26:02] upstanding man this was I was talking
[1:26:06] with a friend of mine the other day I've
[1:26:07] known for 10
[1:26:10] years called me
[1:26:13] and he was done
[1:26:16] wrong his in-laws came and
[1:26:20] and his wife ends up leaving
[1:26:25] him she she and she takes the kids and
[1:26:28] he would call me and he'd be weeping he
[1:26:30] saying I don't know where my kids are
[1:26:31] they could be sold into trafficking they
[1:26:33] could be anywhere he says I don't know
[1:26:36] they they've taken them and and not SP
[1:26:39] spoken to the man and he was just
[1:26:41] distraught for
[1:26:44] Years
[1:26:47] hated his in-laws and his wife for doing
[1:26:50] what they did to him
[1:26:53] talked to him two days ago I believe it
[1:26:54] was two or three days ago and he says
[1:26:58] tells me we've been
[1:26:59] reconciled my wife and
[1:27:01] I to a certain point said good and I
[1:27:05] hear his kids talking in the
[1:27:08] background and I said how about with the
[1:27:11] in-laws he tells me
[1:27:14] this he said they're going to die for
[1:27:16] what they've done God's going to punish
[1:27:20] them he was done wrong
[1:27:25] buddy you better not hope
[1:27:28] that how much more and here's what I
[1:27:31] said how much more have I done to God
[1:27:34] than anyone has ever done to
[1:27:37] me and the same for every person in here
[1:27:40] no one has ever done something in your
[1:27:42] life to you that outweighs what you have
[1:27:45] done to God in your sins the same for
[1:27:48] me so if somebody comes and does me
[1:27:52] wrong and I hold a grudge against
[1:27:54] them I very well could end up like this
[1:27:57] Rich Young Ruler in Hell looking up
[1:27:59] saying go tell the Tucson Tabernacle not
[1:28:02] to hold a grudge against
[1:28:04] someone because they'll end up in the
[1:28:06] same place one
[1:28:09] sin one
[1:28:11] Vice can send us to hell and all of us
[1:28:15] have them don't covet
[1:28:18] that everything is fine for me except
[1:28:21] for this one thing that I'm going to
[1:28:24] keep like the character in the
[1:28:29] movie each of us friends has a
[1:28:34] vice and we need to fully repent of our
[1:28:40] sins not just Lord I was wrong but I
[1:28:42] can't I just can't overcome
[1:28:45] this how many times have you heard that
[1:28:48] I just have this one trouble and Lord I
[1:28:50] I know I'm wrong but I just can't
[1:28:52] overcome it the Bible says that God will
[1:28:55] not tempt you above that you are able to
[1:28:58] overcome it above that you were able to
[1:29:00] bear so if this
[1:29:03] book says it I take it over your
[1:29:06] testimony or my
[1:29:08] testimony I just can't overcome that no
[1:29:10] no yes you can you just want it more
[1:29:14] than you want God I know that's harsh
[1:29:17] but it's the
[1:29:19] truth and here we have this Rich Young
[1:29:21] ru
[1:29:25] and the disciples are looking at him and
[1:29:27] they're like whoa this is this is big we
[1:29:30] know this guy he's like
[1:29:34] great Jesus says this for it is easier
[1:29:38] for a camel to go through the eye of a
[1:29:41] through the needle's eye than for a rich
[1:29:43] man to enter into the
[1:29:46] kingdom and then the disciples heard it
[1:29:50] said and they said who who then can be
[1:29:53] saved all of us have sin in our
[1:29:56] lives and this guy probably has less
[1:29:58] than any of his disciples
[1:30:01] there and yet he
[1:30:04] himself said it's more precious to
[1:30:08] me than the
[1:30:13] word they heard it and they said who
[1:30:15] then can be saved and he said the things
[1:30:18] which are impossible with men are
[1:30:21] possible
[1:30:22] with
[1:30:24] God verse
[1:30:27] number I'll go ahead and read um the
[1:30:30] rest of
[1:30:31] it Peter said Lo we have left all and
[1:30:34] followed thee and he said unto them
[1:30:36] verily I say unto you that there is no
[1:30:38] man that hath left house or parents or
[1:30:40] Brethren or wife or children for the
[1:30:42] kingdom of God's sake who shall not
[1:30:44] receive manifold more in this present
[1:30:49] time and in the world to come Jesus is
[1:30:52] saying hey be encouraged because if you
[1:30:55] give up your Vice if you give up that
[1:30:57] thing that you want so bad that thing
[1:30:59] that's separating you from God if you
[1:31:01] give that up then God will replace it
[1:31:03] with something
[1:31:05] better something that's more precious
[1:31:08] than
[1:31:09] gold but you have to repent first and
[1:31:12] give everything to God that has to
[1:31:15] happen
[1:31:16] first
[1:31:18] before and the the problem with that
[1:31:20] Rich Young Ruler
[1:31:22] is he was too
[1:31:25] stubborn he
[1:31:27] knew he wanted a little praise there
[1:31:30] bowed on his knee before the
[1:31:34] prophet said all these things I've done
[1:31:36] check my check my
[1:31:39] past and Jesus loved the young
[1:31:43] man and he saw there was a vice there
[1:31:47] that was more important to
[1:31:50] him
[1:31:52] than anything else in the
[1:31:55] world and he ended up going to hell for
[1:31:59] it terrible terrible
[1:32:03] story so then you you think you say how
[1:32:06] can I you brother Daniel but we all have
[1:32:09] sins in our lives and we do I certainly
[1:32:13] am one of them I was praying the other
[1:32:16] day I felt felt bad because I do this
[1:32:21] sometimes
[1:32:22] I was on my knees and I was praying and
[1:32:26] my SmartWatch goes
[1:32:29] off and I'm in prayer seeking the
[1:32:33] Lord my watch goes
[1:32:39] off I'll just
[1:32:41] look now look read the message that came
[1:32:46] through right there brother Jordan right
[1:32:49] there the very first commandment that
[1:32:51] Thou shalt have no other gods before me
[1:32:54] I broke
[1:32:55] it I sinned right
[1:32:58] there I put the little
[1:33:03] Idol in front of God there I was in
[1:33:06] prayer what a
[1:33:08] shame I Comm I confess my
[1:33:12] sins before the church that's one of
[1:33:15] them don't want to tell all of
[1:33:19] them but it's a lesson
[1:33:23] I did wrong right
[1:33:26] there I could go to hell for putting
[1:33:30] something in front of God the very first
[1:33:33] commandment I look at
[1:33:35] Paul and I don't have time to read it
[1:33:37] but but Paul says he he's he's looking
[1:33:40] at himself and he says the things that I
[1:33:43] hate the
[1:33:44] most those things are the things that I
[1:33:46] do in Romans chapter
[1:33:49] 7 he says I I I hate it I preach against
[1:33:52] it and then I go do it and he says this
[1:33:55] he says oh Wretched Man that I
[1:33:58] am how terrible I am but look at the
[1:34:01] difference between Paul and that Rich
[1:34:03] Young Ruler there was repentance in
[1:34:06] Paul and Paul says this he says oh
[1:34:09] Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver
[1:34:11] me from the body of this
[1:34:14] death I thank God through Jesus Christ
[1:34:18] Our Lord so then with the mind
[1:34:22] I myself serve the law of God but with
[1:34:25] the Flesh of law of the law of sin he
[1:34:28] says this he
[1:34:29] says thanks be to God who delivers me
[1:34:32] through Jesus Christ Our Lord even
[1:34:35] though all of my sins are
[1:34:38] there I thank God that he does delivered
[1:34:41] me out
[1:34:43] there so what do we
[1:34:45] do what do we do with these
[1:34:48] sins and look at look at my life and now
[1:34:52] now we confess I look at my life and I
[1:34:55] see Peter and James and John in the book
[1:34:57] of Acts I say my life doesn't measure up
[1:35:01] to their lives and the Bible is is very
[1:35:05] careful to record sins of all the
[1:35:07] prophets and sins of these of many of
[1:35:10] these
[1:35:11] disciples but how
[1:35:13] come my life doesn't measure up to
[1:35:18] theirs where are these miracles we see
[1:35:21] Miracles we see
[1:35:23] blessings we see that God has done
[1:35:25] things for us but I read there should be
[1:35:29] more there should be more gospel there
[1:35:31] should be people should be flocking here
[1:35:34] to be healed to receive salvation Lord
[1:35:36] where do I fall
[1:35:39] short John chapter 3 there was a man
[1:35:44] named
[1:35:45] Nicodemus this man was not a normal guy
[1:35:51] he was at the
[1:35:52] top Bible says he was a Pharisee of
[1:35:55] Pharisees a teacher of the Pharisees he
[1:35:59] comes to the Lord
[1:36:04] Jesus came by night and said unto him
[1:36:08] Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher
[1:36:09] come from God for no man can do these
[1:36:12] Miracles that thou doest except God be
[1:36:14] with him Jesus answered and said unto
[1:36:16] him verily verily I say unto thee except
[1:36:18] a man be born again he cannot see the
[1:36:22] kingdom of God Nicodemus the master says
[1:36:28] this how can a man be born when he is
[1:36:32] old can he enter into the the second
[1:36:34] time into his mother's womb and be born
[1:36:37] Jesus answered and said verily verily I
[1:36:39] say unto thee except a man be born of
[1:36:42] water and of spirit he cannot enter into
[1:36:45] the kingdom he can't go there's there's
[1:36:49] different schools of thought about the
[1:36:51] water the water breaks and the child is
[1:36:53] born he he's born a flesh child there's
[1:36:57] there's many think that that think that
[1:36:58] that is coming into this world others
[1:37:01] think that it's in the baptismal pool up
[1:37:04] there that you have to be baptized but
[1:37:06] the second one is without dispute you
[1:37:09] have to be born again there has to be a
[1:37:12] new creat cre New Creation in
[1:37:17] you and a vice a sin will keep us from
[1:37:22] that whatever it is and friends we all
[1:37:26] have
[1:37:27] them as you sit here now look into your
[1:37:32] lives each one of us has it and are we
[1:37:36] willing like Paul was to say oh Wretched
[1:37:39] Man that I am I'm
[1:37:42] trying by the grace of Jesus Christ I'm
[1:37:44] going to keep trying I'm going to
[1:37:45] overcome it or are we like the Rich
[1:37:48] Young rulers like I think I'll go to
[1:37:50] another church
[1:37:52] I think I'll
[1:37:54] just
[1:37:56] forget about that part because it's not
[1:37:59] that important
[1:38:02] anyways in closing and uh
[1:38:06] musicians can
[1:38:08] come friends when I'm talking about
[1:38:11] these
[1:38:14] vices they they are what will keep you
[1:38:19] out of the Kingdom there are people in
[1:38:23] this room now that may be in the same
[1:38:28] place that that rich young ruler
[1:38:31] was that may be their
[1:38:35] destination it's a horrible thought but
[1:38:37] it's
[1:38:38] true the individual where am I going to
[1:38:41] end
[1:38:42] up you young men where are you going to
[1:38:45] end
[1:38:46] up you can't do
[1:38:48] it through your works if there is
[1:38:52] something in your life that is
[1:38:55] separating you from Jesus Christ get rid
[1:38:58] of
[1:38:59] it as best as you can confess it Lord
[1:39:03] I've got a
[1:39:05] problem Lord I need you to help me to
[1:39:07] overcome
[1:39:09] this and then overcome
[1:39:12] it I look and I see I see today it makes
[1:39:16] it's been bothering me so much that you
[1:39:18] think so highly of someone that that you
[1:39:21] have a friend or a or a colleague or or
[1:39:23] somebody in church and you lift them up
[1:39:25] so much and then you see they are fine
[1:39:29] up until one thing
[1:39:32] no the word says it well maybe that's
[1:39:35] not exactly
[1:39:36] true and they just Overlook
[1:39:41] it and it will end up taking them to
[1:39:44] torment into
[1:39:46] hell I'm not usually a fire and
[1:39:49] brimstone type teacher but but friends
[1:39:52] this will send us to hell if we don't
[1:39:55] get rid of every
[1:39:58] sin God will help
[1:40:00] us but if there is something in our
[1:40:03] lives get rid of
[1:40:06] it in my case there might be a lot of
[1:40:09] different
[1:40:11] things but I go before the Lord and I
[1:40:13] say Lord I'm
[1:40:15] sorry I'm a sinner oh wretched man than
[1:40:19] I am but I thank God for the blood of
[1:40:22] Jesus Christ that was shed on the cross
[1:40:25] and I want to do everything that I can
[1:40:27] but in the world today it says please
[1:40:29] yourself you're
[1:40:31] entitled we are not entitled to any
[1:40:34] anything a Christian forfeits all of our
[1:40:37] rights well he did me wrong so
[1:40:42] what I preached last
[1:40:44] week quot of the
[1:40:47] scripture you loan something to someone
[1:40:51] someone not your good friend you loan it
[1:40:56] to your enemy and then you hope that he
[1:40:59] doesn't bring it
[1:41:01] back so you can be
[1:41:04] blessed how many of us have that but
[1:41:07] instead somebody does something wrong to
[1:41:10] us a little thing and and says something
[1:41:12] bad maybe spreads a rumor about us and
[1:41:15] all of a sudden we want to condemn them
[1:41:17] and how much have I done to God how much
[1:41:20] have I done to God I remember one time
[1:41:23] somebody was spreading an awful rumor
[1:41:24] rumor about me I got down on my knees
[1:41:28] and I was praying I said
[1:41:31] Lord make this person's Folly
[1:41:36] manifest let the world see that what
[1:41:38] this person is saying about me is
[1:41:42] false put my head
[1:41:45] down I said Our Father who art in heaven
[1:41:48] Hallowed be thy name
[1:41:51] thy kingdom come thy will be done in
[1:41:54] earth as it is in heaven give us this
[1:41:56] daily bread and forgive us of our
[1:42:00] trespasses oh God forgive
[1:42:02] [Music]
[1:42:04] me oh God forgive
[1:42:07] me as I forgive those that trespass
[1:42:10] against me what a
[1:42:12] hypocrite and how many of
[1:42:15] us have been in that situation no matter
[1:42:18] what we do we have no
[1:42:21] rights you have rights as an
[1:42:26] American but a Christian forfeits
[1:42:29] it that person that would do you
[1:42:32] wrong that would kill
[1:42:34] you you turn around as a Christian you
[1:42:37] pray for that person Stephen when he
[1:42:39] died when he was being stoned Lord
[1:42:41] forgive them for they know not what they
[1:42:43] do exactly almost the same words that
[1:42:45] the Lord Jesus said when he was on the
[1:42:46] cross Lord forgive them for they know
[1:42:48] not what they do
[1:42:53] and breaks my
[1:42:56] heart I see my failures everywhere but I
[1:42:59] see so many failures within the within
[1:43:01] the people that call themselves
[1:43:02] Christians are they
[1:43:05] really brothers and sisters are we
[1:43:08] Christians oh we believe the message we
[1:43:11] believe this there is no higher thing
[1:43:14] than to be Christlike a
[1:43:19] Christian are are we
[1:43:22] that what vices do you each have in your
[1:43:25] life are you

[1:43:31] to do your best to get rid of it to
[1:43:33] Forfeit everything and give your life to
[1:43:35] Christ because it says that I just read
[1:43:37] the scriptures that you will not enter
[1:43:40] into the

[1:48:58] happened the man made such an impression
[1:49:02] upon that group of people these these
[1:49:05] missionaries came years
[1:49:09] later they came to India they came to
[1:49:11] this Village they're spreading the
[1:49:13] gospel they're te they're preaching
[1:49:15] Jesus Christ they come to this Village
[1:49:17] this Village says oh we already know
[1:49:19] Jesus
[1:49:21] we already know him the same
[1:49:24] Village the missionary said how do you
[1:49:27] know Jesus Christ and they told these
[1:49:31] missionaries the story of this man many
[1:49:36] years earlier that had given his life
[1:49:39] that was executed in front of the whole
[1:49:41] village and it made such an impression
[1:49:44] that from the village Chief they
[1:49:47] converted from Christianity the whole
[1:49:49] village because of this man's testimony
[1:49:52] and his strength in dying for what he
[1:49:55] believed how many people today will give
[1:49:58] up a little
[1:50:00] Vice refuse to give that up but he gave
[1:50:04] everything the things that he loved the
[1:50:06] most he gave everything for this Jesus
[1:50:08] [Music]
[1:50:10] Christ do you believe the Lord
[1:50:14] Jesus friends he is worth it don't end
[1:50:18] up like this rich Young Ruler where he
[1:50:21] lifted up his eyes in
[1:50:26] hell and cried out for them to go to his
[1:50:28] his
[1:50:30] brothers because it's standing there
[1:50:32] right before each of us and if we won't
[1:50:35] give it up as I said it could be
[1:50:37] anything it could be when somebody says
[1:50:40] something against
[1:50:41] you and you want to fight
[1:50:45] out
[1:50:47] don't pray for that person that's a
[1:50:49] Christian
[1:50:51] CHR somebody takes something of
[1:50:54] yours pray for that
[1:50:56] [Music]
[1:50:58] person that's a Christian that was this
[1:51:01] man that I just talked about and that is
[1:51:04] what the Lord Jesus wanted us to be
[1:51:07] that's what he wants missionaries to
[1:51:10] be as you're going out spreading this
[1:51:12] gospel live the gospel before him that's
[1:51:15] going to be more successful than
[1:51:16] anything that you ever
[1:51:18] say
[1:51:20] the song came from this man's testimony
[1:51:22] but the conversions came from his what
[1:51:25] he did in the life that he
[1:51:30] [Music]
[1:51:35] lived but give me
[1:51:40] Jesus

[1:51:58] whole
[1:52:01] world but give me

[1:52:08] of those people I won't turn back I'm
[1:52:11] not turning back I am not turning back
[1:52:14] for anything I won't turn back I'm
[1:52:16] keeping going in the direction that I'm
