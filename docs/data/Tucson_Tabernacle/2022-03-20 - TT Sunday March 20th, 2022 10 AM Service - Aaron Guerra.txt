[Music] amen i think it was you friday may be seated you went friday afternoon as i was just going over some of these things and that song just came to mind and i said well i only know one that sings it so i'm going to ask sister martha if she would sing that i can trust jesus i can give my awe without fear let's just bow our heads lord we lord we should just be such a grateful people a happy people a trusting people lord you've never failed your your record is unblemished lord there's not even a question we question ourselves we wonder why but lord everything is perfect you have a reason and a why lord and a perfect timing for everything lord so we just want to say thank you we love you for that today lord help us lord just set ourselves out of the way and let you minister to us today lord we ask in jesus christ's name amen while you're standing well we'll read the scripture here in psalms chapter 25 and we'll read verse 12 to start and then you may be seated at point psalms 25 12. you think of a man like david who had some bad hard times that he caused himself and sometimes our problems are problems that we cause of ourselves but he found out that a god full of mercy rich in mercy if he would turn and humble himself and say i'm wrong and he would find the mercy of god he says he says what man is he that feareth the lord him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose you may be seated to think that god would be mindful of us you know if you work for a large corporation a big company i worked for all local companies until we went to work for masco a fortune 500 company and you were just a number you were just another employee because they had thousands of employees all over the country and maybe even different parts of the world and working for local companies you could go to your manager who could go to the owner and get it resolved quickly but you're working for a large corporation with a lot of employees you go to your manager who goes to his manager who goes to the regional manager who goes to the area manager and then a month later come back and they ask you what was the question and you start all over and i didn't know that when i went to work there he told me when my boss told me he said don't expect a quick answer it's got to go through the system but if you'll just bow your heart down before him and go directly to him he'll answer back because he loves you he takes care of you appreciate his goodness and his mercy and he's so good to us i'd like to read something to you it was from the daily strength came in last night i read it just a portion taken from mark chapter 4 verses 26 to 29 and he said so is the kingdom of god if a man should cast seed into the ground and he should sleep and rise night and day and the seed should spring and grow up he knoweth not how for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade then the ear after that the full corn in the ear but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he putteth a sickle because harvest has come and sometimes we get anxious in our own selves i i've i've wanted this i i want the manifestation of god the peace of god whatever it might be and we get anxious for it but god has a time and a place for it all and this was a thought there were two brothers lawrence and frank leibach that wrote a famous piece of christian literature called practicing his presence and that almost seems contrary practicing his presence you've heard the term practice makes perfect but perfect practice makes perfect because if you practice something wrong you'll get it wrong every time you know i practice practice but you were practicing wrong okay but he just said in the book one of them writes at times i fill my whole mind and heart being raised up into god's presence as if without effort that they had always belonged there when you experience the presence of god like this and know that you have experienced the lord in a unique unique way you will never be the same person and that is the truth you will never get to the point where you've had enough of the lord's presence we must practice being in his presence and make him feel welcome in our lives because it is only in his presence that we will become mature and thereby receive our translation into glory so practicing what is practicing praying every day reading your brother brown says read your bible and pray every day and make that a practice at times when it's even difficult you've got so much going on everything you're getting but take some time to practice it till it becomes part of your what you do what you are different different uh people that you might you know especially in sports and different things like that but whatever it is they'll talk about the dedication and the time spent to get to the place that they're at today yeah and i know there's some people that just seem to be born into it we we ran cross country and there was a young man a freshman for every uh uh whatever exercise it was whether it was jumping jacks or stretching you did ten he did one he hardly did it at all but he won every race that he ran and those of us that practice and stretch were always disappointed because we did everything but he was a natural runner and i'm not saying there are some people that way but there is a practice that you put in read your bible and pray spend time with god do those things which are good it is a practice it becomes part of your life and you know jesus humbled himself before his father he could have said i'm god and i don't need to listen i've got it but no he learned obedience through the things he suffered and sometimes we say lord why am i going through this again he said because i'm teaching you i'm working with you to become that which i've already seen you i've already seen the fruit there so and david says what man is he that feareth the lord now that fear is not being afraid but having respect and reverence realizing his awesomeness realizing what he can do but that he loves you and he has your best interest in mind he says him shall he teach in the way that he shall shall choose god will teach him or should he the way that god has appointed it to be and and sometimes we'll get to looking at somebody else's blessings what somebody else is going through and it seems that they're just further along than we are they get more blessings they seem to go along but god has a reason when you see um and i'm just going to use this as an example the truck that you want and you see it drive by on the road and you look at it and you say my i'd love to have that truck and you're kind of you look at the boy and in your mind and that person is driving it already and sometimes you forget that god gave you what you're driving but you're looking at something else and you're desiring it and i'm not saying that that's wrong to do that but sometimes you get to looking at what other blessings somebody else is getting you're wondering why am i shorted but god chooses your way and learning to surrender and yield to that and sometimes that's the hard part it seems like my brother and my sister or my friend or this church or that church seems to get more blessings the first quote fellowship through the reconciliation of the blood some things that brother branham says it's it's if if you realize it in your own life sometimes your thoughts or something what's burning in your heart and you'll open a scripture or you'll open a message and it seems like right there on that first paragraph or right there god speaks right back to you because he will take care of me and i can trust him in the beginning when god made man in his own image put him in the garden of eden he had a perfect fellowship in the late of the afternoon the evening time when the twilights was falling i can see the great jehovah come across the top of the palm trees and the roaring of the thunder when adam and eve gathered out there in the great open air cathedral and worshiped god had fellowship talked with him the lion the tigers all coming up around in perfect harmony wouldn't that be a wonderful place to live amen you know we dad took us when we were kids too i think it then it was called lion country safari in san diego and you drove your vehicles through it was one of the first ones you got to drive your vehicle dude we're kids we're trying to stick our heads out the windows and everything you know and suddenly we noticed all the lions coming towards us and it was about 15 of them running towards our truck and we all backed away from the windows and we're like is it my dad's red truck is it the red truck is that what we didn't know the food truck was falling right behind us had nothing to do with our red truck but would you ask me and my brothers we were terrified because the lions were coming after us and sometimes you get looking that way and you get feeling that way it's because of this but god has you in mind and a reason and a why because he takes care of you and you imagine that place of harmony when the lion and the tiger would come and they just come and lay down at adam and eve's feet and be petted and be touched by them what an amazing time wouldn't that be a wonderful place to live at abiding place where there's no sickness it's hard to read that way no sorrow no way of ever being upset everything's in perfect harmony god in harmony with his creature and the creature in harmony with his maker what a perfect time a complete fellowship that's the way god intended it he'd come in the cool of the evening to fellowship with his children and you know it it's it's such a time to sit down with your own children with your family with your loved ones and have a good fellowship and it's just it's a pleasure but then there are those that haven't had that pleasure don't have the pledge satan has gone in and mixed things up and life is difficult for them but we ought to be grateful that god has been good to us about that the next quote there's two quotes on this when man was made in the image of god and then god came down in the image of man to redeem man that that brought man and god together heavens and earth hugged and kissed each other god and man embrace each other as fatherhood and sonship when the logos became flesh and dwelt among us jesus said i came from god and i go to god is that right after his death burial and resurrection and ascension when the body was taken up to set at the right hand of god i don't mean god's got a right hand god's a spirit but at the right hand means his power and authority of god that in the name everything in heaven is named after it and subject to it everything in earth is named after and subject to him a name above all names jesus christ now this logo was in him which was a spirit of god the anointing through the sanctifying grace of the blood brought many sons to god which is anointed with the same logos it wasn't for him it was for me and you his desire of his family to share that the very spirit of god in you and me has hard times that we wonder lord where is it when we have our ups and downs and sometimes more downs and ups but that's okay one more quote there abraham's covenant confirmed and when i can show you in the bible that he forgives all our iniquity oh god heals all our diseases let me just take hold of that promise and say father god i'm weak i need you i know you keep your word your el shaddai i'm believing you lord fill me with your spirit wash me in your blood take me back o lord and try me let me lean against your bosom i am your child i was don't born to you but i got weak but you're my strength giver you promised you would do it and i'm just going to hold right there lord and i'm going to be satisfied that you'll fill me with your spirit wash me in your blood take away all of my condemnation heal my body and make me well what a promise it is to confirm his promise to abraham i'm el shaddai and he never changes he's the same yesterday today and forever and realize it every promise in god's word everything that was written and allowed for us to read is because he had you in mind because he's still the same yesterday today and forever sometimes we say well that was good for david that was good for abraham and it was it was good for brother branham it was good for brother green but it's good for me and i can take his very promises so as i was thinking this was david speaking here looking at the life of david looking at the life of solomon and looking at the life of paul brother lyle spoke wednesday night on paul and god had put a portion in my heart already just something that paul had said and then brother lyle brought a portion it just tied in well and i love a god that just works that way you know somebody here preaching it this way and then somebody here preaching it this way in the congregation and going which way is it but god ties it all together so what man is he that feareth the lord has respect has reverent understand that it's not him but is god and has respect unto god him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose in the way that god appointeth verse 13 his soul shall dwell at ease that's not kicking back taking it easy and got nothing to do but there will be a rest there'll be a peace there'll be a portion that no matter what the trouble and what the problem is they'll say god is still in control and he has me in mind jesus his soul shall dwell at ease and his seed shall inherit or possess the earth every step in the land is possession you get out and you walk all over the promises of god if i could say it that way i don't mean step on your bible i mean walk in his promises and said that's mine that's my god said so healing is mine salvation is mine peace is mine rest is mine because god said so even in the middle of the night when you wake up because there's a sudden noise a sudden disturbance and nobody wakes up and goes oh i guess i'll get up and go see that no we jump out of bed what was that what was that that's our first reaction but when you wake up and you know god is watching you over here i can plant my feet on the ground and i can walk because god is watching over me every step in the land is possession and in today's land we're talking about the word of god this is my land this is my inheritance what god has promised me walk in it open it read it practice it god said brother branham had taught us he says you can never pray enough but you can practice you can put yourself to doing it and praying doesn't mean you're on your knees all the time because sometimes you're working all day sometimes you're driving but you can still talk to god and he can talk back to you and then david says the secret of the lord is with them that fear him the thoughts the things that god wants to reveal the unveiling of his word is with them that god wants to and fellowship he says to them that fear him and he will show them his covenant his counsel his friendship you know if if if if you got letters received somebody's writing to you and you they write them in beautiful stationary and good writing and all but you never open the letter you just stack them there you'll never know what they say you could suppose you could guess well you know i know enough about them they probably said open it up and read it open the word of god said hey your word says this lord i've talked to some folks who had never read the bible never they always had some and they opened it for themselves and said wow this is this is amazing what god says it is for us he says here the secret of the lord his counsel his friendship his own feelings his own how he is then he says mine eyes my thoughts my vision my desires are ever towards the lord for he shall pluck my feet out of the net when you think of a net it's an entrapment it's something that tangles you something that holds you to keep you from moving forward these entanglements confusion disappointments and those are part of life there are disappointments there is confusion at times which way what do i look how do i turn um i worked with a young man that had this dyslexia and i didn't know it at the time and i was going to send him to phoenix and he told me when i say he was young he was probably in his early 20s maybe late teens and i know he'd graduated from high school and all so i said i'm going to send you up to phoenix and you go pick up some material and he says i can't do that i said well you drive to work every day you should be able to drive he goes yeah because i know how to get here i said well it's real simple i'll give you a map and then he looks at me goes i got dyslexia he said and when i get nervous everything flips and when i look at a sign i'm not sure if i'm reading it right and without the holy spirit without a yielding and surrendering to god you'll have spiritual dyslexia you'll look at it and you'll not be too sure could it be could it not be it's just a natural application to that but if you'll trust in the leadership of the lord and if you'll practice learning how to yield learning how to surrender learning how to let go and let god have his way he will lead you he will guide you he'll direct you keep you away from the entanglements the confusions the disappointments life has its disappointments frustrations there's pains there's sicknesses there's hurts it's part of life it came in the fall but he became me so that i through his grace could become him he walked this earth he wore a body of flesh he suffered he bled he was sick he was tired he was worn he had his frustrations he called those those brothers of his those ones that he had just met he goes oh fools and slow of heart they had just just walked with him now he's going through emmaus and and they don't even recognize him and he called them fools the bible says the fool says there is no god have you ever looked at it that way they had thought god had died and in their mind there was no god walking and saying we thought he was going to be the one we thought at this time it was going to be and he says o fools slow of heart did not i tell you did not i say have not you read in the word jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he healeth all thy diseases he forgiveth thine iniquities and when you live trapped up and entangled disappointed because you can't just seem to overcome go to him and realize he's with you a solomon in proverbs this is david's son the bible says and the wisest man on earth why was he that because his heart pleased god god told him you can have anything you asked for proverbs 3 11 through 13 is the scripture we'll be reading but god tells them he said solomon you can have anything you ask for riches untold wealth and he says give me a heart to rule the people and it pleased god so much he said i'll give you that and everything else too and here's solomon speaking verse 11 my son despise not the chastening of the lord neither be weary of his correction or reproof the word reproof or despise not despise not either by making light of it not taking it seriously not putting any weight in it or not being duly affected with it you got to a point where it doesn't bother you anymore you can walk right through it and say oh he says more by accounting it as a un as an unnecessary thing and look at today's world the people who fill the law is for those others not me i i encountered a homeowner that way i did my best not to laugh but i thought it was funny i went to this home on a retired gentleman and he wanted some things done repaired replaced that were not our fault and i explained to him i do and he got very upset and he started telling me how i should do my work and what i should do and you know got to be let me just say you got to be nice to them you can't you got to act like you're real happy in front of them even though you might be burning up inside and he began to say things and i began to explain to him and i just said you know sir there are certain parameters that we work through and everything and these this was his answer to me he said a person of less intelligence needs parameters ah that was the nicest way to call me dumb it really is kind of what he said you're not smart enough to do this you know by that time i actually thought it was funny and i was doing my best not to laugh because then he went on and criticized his neighbors they were grading the land across the street for the next phase and he was telling me how those operators on those equipment didn't even know how to use it and i realized where the problem was his wife was back up in the corner over there just standing by the door and never said a word because i don't think she wanted to get something told to her also but when you realize that if your heart is not right you can get yourself in that same attitude and you don't want reproof you don't want correction you don't need it either by making light of it or not being duly affected by it or about by accounting it as an unnecessary thing but rather esteem it a privilege and a favor from god that he would be mindful enough of me and care enough of me that he would say hey aaron i need your attention i need your attention you're about to get yourself into some trouble here and i'm going to get you out of it if you listen don't not getting weary my son defies not the chastening the discipline instruction of the lord neither be weary of his correction reproof neither think it a tedious or hard but endure it with patientness patience and cheerfulness lord i love it when you correct me easy words to say but hard to keep that attitude but lord let me yell let me surrender let me say yes lord whatever it might be the difference between reproof and correction both are related to errors or mistakes and their consequences when you make a mistake or an error there's a consequence with it um in in in working in the shop that i did when we we got our first job in acrylics and the other guy who had seniority over me did not like the plastics and the smells and the glues so they let me do it and which i ended up doing it for about 12 years and they've they the the boss went out he got the um the training and all and then we came under his certification as long as we were working under them so they gave it to me and they gave me my first job and and it was an expensive product where count regular laminate countertops were about 15 a foot this was like 50 a foot and in the early 80s that was a lot of money and so i built it and he's watching me and we build it and get the whole job takes about two days to get it done and he comes in to do the final check on it and he read the thing and he goes did you see this right here where it said the color i said yeah he goes well why did you build it in the wrong color after two days of work i built the whole job in the wrong color because i didn't read through the whole thing didn't double check it so there was consequences a lot of time a lot of money and the delay of the job so after that you learn to read everything twice you rent then double check everything i would tell the guys as i would train them double check all my numbers i could have flipped a number ten minutes of checking and anything could save us two days of labor there are consequences jesus reproof refers to expression of blame or disapproval correction refers to the action process of the action of fixing it so god will give you some reproof but he won't leave you there he'll give you the action to correct it and that's a god rich in mercy yes you did make a mistake yes you did wrong but i'll show you how you can get right and this is what solomon is saying my son he says despise not the chasing of the lord neither be weary of his correction i don't want to find out at the end that i was wrong when it's too late the key difference between reproof and correction one is an action the other one is just words for whom the lord loveth he correcteth even as a father the son in whom he delighteth for whom the lord loveth he correcteth so when god speaks to you whether it's through the ministering of the word through reading the scriptures through hearing a message to someone however it is say lord thank you because you're mindful of me you care for me happy is a man that findeth wisdom and the man that gideth understanding happy there's a joy there's a peace and happiness there's something about being happy that transcends a lot of the trouble that's going on when you're in a happy state and it doesn't mean a drug effect to stay or a drink affected it means there's a peace of god in your life there's something beyond a natural stimulation it's god alive in you he says happy is a man that finds his wisdom and the man that gideth understanding or another word for that gets the revelation of it it becomes something real something he can live or she can live it's not just a law that i have to try to keep but god in me can live it when you find that place brother branham in the message shalom is what i'd like to get to today like paul said hallelujah he had an infirmity something was bothering him the devil would buffet him blow after blow and he consulted the lord three times to take it away from him said i don't want this lord take it away from me and then one night the lord spoke to him and said paul my grace is sufficient he said then all glory in my infirmity i'll glory in it i know you're the healer i've seen you heal the sick raise the dead and cast out devil devils open the eyes of the blind but if i've consulted you and you tell me it's your grace is sufficient that your grace is sufficient then this devil that bothers me is is the growing pains of your grace then i'll glory in my infirmities why if if les i lest i get exalted above the abundance of revelation and and if you're not careful in this message there are people that are so exalted in their revelation so exalted in their revelation they cannot be corrected they cannot you cannot talk to them you cannot have anything to do with them because they are so right and paul realized that he says all glory in my infirmities that doesn't mean i'm happy to be in pain but i'll understand that god is going to get glory out of this i'm a man an insufficient man i don't have the strength i have my problems but yet god is going to be glorified in this so let's look at the scripture here ii corinthians 12 8-10 for this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me three times i went to the lord and said i could be a much better servant of yours lord i could get a whole lot more done for you i'd be so much more effective if you would take this infirmity this problem this sickness this weakness whatever it is in my life i could be a much better servant for you lord i'd have more energy i'd have more strength i'd have more understanding i would just be a better person for you lord if you would do this and the lord's saying yeah and i can see already you got a problem with it you're already beginning to exalt yourself but paul is not thinking he's doing that paul is looking at it in the natural saying i could be much better if i didn't have these problems and then paul says and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee my grace the unmerited favor that which you did nothing to deserve but i choose to give it to you his grace his forgiveness his love his mercy all under grace it's sufficient it's more than enough it'll get you through it and my word will be fulfilled and that which i sent you to do will get done he says for my strength is made perfect in weakness complete whole it's demonstrated to its fullness lord that had to be you because there's no way i could do that paul had to come to that understanding i've said this before the two messengers paul being the first messenger to the first stage and brother branham being the messenger to the second age to the last age i'm sorry paul who had to struggle with education he even says if you want to show your qualifications let me show you mine i was born this way i studied under the best i did this i did that and brother branham on this side he said obviously he goes i don't have the education quite often as you're reading me i i can't even pronounce the words he struggled with the fact that he did not have the education and to me god was showing i can use that one as much as i can use this one the six age messenger john wesley an intelligent man an eloquent man god used him brother branham a man with very little education and god used him he's telling paul this my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness when i can realize lord that was you because i had no strength to do it on my own no ability to do it on my own i would have failed i was going the wrong direction i thought i would do it this way and you took it around and did it this way to god be the glory so then paul says most gladly therefore will i glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me therefore i take pleasure in my infirmities in reproaches in necessities in persecutions in distresses for christ's sake for when i am weak then i am strong oh those are two opposites when i'm weak i'm strong when i can't lift this up i gotta depend on him and i get myself out of the way and that's the hardest part sometimes getting yourself out of the way this is what paul is saying here the message shalom and brother branham speaks here in shalom paul said hallelujah he had an infirmity something was bothering him the devil the devil would buff and buffet him blow after blow and he consulted the lord three times to take it away from him i don't know i don't want this lord take it away from me and then one night the lord spoke to him in paul and said my grace is sufficient he said then i'll glory in my infirmity when i am weak he's made strong when i can't he will but when i can he can't because i don't get him lord i can handle this by myself i've got this figured out i know that i can handle let me go and sometimes god says go and then he sits down he says hey angels come on let's watch this for a little while watch this no he's got his eye over you he's caring for you he knows he's been there already he's walked this path before he was tempted he was tried he didn't give in to it but he was tempted he knows the feeling of temptation he knows the pull the desire because he wore flesh he bathed himself so he could understand or else he wouldn't know what you're asking him about he wouldn't understand it it would be like going and talking to your cat and telling your cat how terrible you feel and the cat just walks away no understanding it's not human but he took flesh upon himself he hurt if he cut himself he bled if he tripped it hurt when he hit his knee when he laid down and he was tired his body ate as hard as it is to imagine a god and flesh could be but he did he took it upon himself so he could be touched by the feeling of mine and year's infirmities and paul realizes when i'm weak he's made strong because he's the one that begins to work this out paul on his way and brother lyle covered it well on his way self-righteous doing what he thought was a perfect will of god i'm going to destroy these christians when we've had this truth the law of moses that god established from the beginning and they're saying that god is in a man today i'm going to put a stop to this brother lyle covered that very well on wednesday night through the scriptures but god rich in mercy said oh paul you're going to have to come to the place where you're going to glory in your infirmities that had to be god this was not paul because i could not do this paul had to live with the thought that he committed christians to death i don't know you know i don't know what you've been through i don't know what you've been through in your life but if you've done something that you can't go and do and it troubles you the rest of your life you wish you could go fix it but you can't you know you see in the news when a drunk person a person high on drugs or something they get an accident and people are killed and the remorse the feeling that you'll see the picture of them they're crying they can't undo it the remorse and it's too late now how do you fix it paul had to be sitting there thinking i had them put to death for this very god that i'm certain this very christian life this very way that i'm serving god i had people put to death for that he said i'm going to glory in my efforts god had a reason for it now brother bran i'm in a message called i know it's a fairly long quote a few days ago when i come out of the most prettiest and most gorgeous place that i ever saw in my life is a great building of our brother oral roberts when i seen that solid marble and not a window in it nowhere but how it was fixed i've been to hollywood and i've seen things kings palaces and i've been everywhere that could be and i've been everywhere that could be hardly around the world and all that swanky swanky sorry lovely places in the home but i never seen anything any place to compare with it nowhere at all how the little aluminum wires weave the inside together and oh i've never seen anything so gorgeous in all my life that's his descriptions those are his words when i walked through there and i took and it took my hands and rubbed those pole pilasters and the great granite all the form of the trinity of the father son and holy ghost the carmens in it all those things had just come from brother tommy osborne and seen his great mighty work there for the lord i stood on the outside looked back at that building thought god surely i have become a hypocrite surely i have become an outcast somewhere for these men's ministries come off a mine and i thought what maybe i'm so untrusted lord that you couldn't trust me with anything like that even the little few dollars that you let me pay for the campaigns and things now they're trying to send me to the penitentiary for it and why am i such a hypocrite or why am i such an untrusted person here's brother branham saying look what they got and obviously i didn't deserve it i'm not worthy of it i'm no good for it and he begins to look at himself that way he's just being honest with his words here the beauty and and and the the the vastness of it all and it's just amazing to him he says i was on the ash sheep as job was of old when i stood outside there with just couldn't hardly get my breath from such a majesty that a poor boy born in a dugout a pentecostal could do and bring that into that great mammoth building and i thought oh god maybe i am not worthy but watch this and then a little voice came down through those quarters and said but i am your portion stop for a little bit here's brother ben i'm walking through this place a manus of god like people had never seen before it had been amazing what god was doing and he said their ministries came from mine people who saw what was god doing and say lord if you can do that with him you can do it with me and god allowed that to be let this word of god get out all over the world but brethren random is walking through it he's amazed by the beauty of it and all and he says obviously god you didn't trust me you wouldn't give me such a thing i couldn't handle it here listen to paul again saying lord if you'll do this for me i'll be better at that here's brother branham doing the exact same thing god answers paul and says my grace is sufficient for you paul and here god tells brother branham i am your portion he says so then i thought oh lord god oh let that just let that let that stay that way then lord because i wouldn't have the intelligence to carry in a great word like that for you and i'm i'm an illiterate person but as long as you're my portion i am yours and you will lead me i could not lead myself but o lord lead me both of them come to the same place paul says therefore i will glory in my infirmities in my weaknesses in my inability and i'll let god have his way and he said as long as i can stay like this and let you be my portion he said then the work can get done both messengers and god says i am your person my grace is sufficient for you grace unmerited favor nothing you did to deserve it nothing you could earn it by 500 hours of prayer reading all the messages going to every campaign every every uh uh church that has their their uh services and fellowship and all not missing a single one if you're basing it on that you've deserved nothing because then it becomes works but if you have him and he's that portion in you then it's his grace in your life and he begins to work his life out through your life direction taking care of leading you guiding you where sometimes you say my how did i accident it must have been by accident then i turned the wrong way here and god says no no that's not an accident there's a purpose for that there's a reason as to why the different testimonies that we've heard from behind this pulpit over the years how what seemed like how could that have happened but god had a purpose for it in life and because of that some of us are here today because somebody quote unquote took the wrong turn but there were you and god knew it i'll ask this question this way how many of you were so holy and so righteous and so perfect that god had to come to you that's what i thought none of us how many know that god had to reach out to where you are and get your life and bring it back that's why he gives the story of the prodigal son a man who had everything a son i said give me my inheritance that i may go do what i want to do and he went and it didn't take long to make a mess of his life and one day he comes too and for each one of us there was a time in our lives that we came to and realized i'm not where i want to be this is not the life i want to live but a god rich in mercy set somebody down your way say something down your way or caused a reason to why whatever it was maybe flat on your back somewhere maybe a co-worker who knows however it wasn't god allowed it to be to reach out and touch your life and he said that's what it's been all along not because i was good not because i deserved this not because god owed it to me but a god rich in mercy reached out to my life and got a hold of me you know it and it's amazing how many people in today's world are looking for a god like that and can't find them because they've just been given man's religion i've worked with some and and i'm not putting any religion down in any ways they're people they're human they need a god just like i needed a god they deserve a god as much as i deserve the god god didn't do it just because it was me god did for each one that would he said i would that none would perish but that all would come to life and hear some of their stories what they've done what they've had to do what they've had to try to accomplish and when they couldn't get it do it so disappointed because it didn't it didn't come out that way went to my co-workers funeral service a good man a good man one of the best um when i was was the the area manager and i had him working under me as my service tech one of the best guys ever worked he was an old gentleman he had good work habits just a good man did good work you know passed away and we went to his his memorial and the service it was a catholic church and on one side the priest around his cactus kept his casket not the cactus the casket he's the instance i'd never been when the incense and all and on one side he's talking about how safely my friend was in the hands of jesus and on the other side of it and he's doing the same thing he's asking for god to lift him out of purgatory and i'm thinking are these people not hearing what the priest is saying on one side he's saved on the other side he's still in purgatory but god rich in mercy the same god who said my grace is sufficient to paul and told brother branham i am your portion it's the same one that came to me and said my grace is sufficient for you i am your portion took me beyond that and brought me to the real word of god the unveiled word of god to what he really is and it's not something mysterious it's not something so great you can't understand but by faith you can receive it and put it to action a god rich in mercy a god of grace paul said hallelujah he had an infirmity and i will glory in my infirmity therefore his strength is made known you say i'm weak i'm tired i've got problems young man young lady especially coming through your teenage years you go through the struggles you go through the hard times we've all been there and because sin has really come out i would say they're going through a harder time than some of us had to go through but his grace is still sufficient it's not any weaker it's not any less and it's more today as it needs to be met whoever you are wherever you are his grace is sufficient for you cast all your cares upon he cares for you brother peter if you would come back up musicians his grace is sufficient more than enough whatever it's needed his shed blood puts sin through his shed blood it confessed sin it's clean it no longer exists it's not held against you cleanse my heart oh god take that that that feeling of i'm lost i mean give me a peace over give me a satisfaction over it it's borious lord your your prophet brother branham preach a message called shalom peace rest not in our own abilities not because we're good enough not x amount of works and x amount of quotes and x amount of praying could cover this but rather your grace is sufficient your unmerited favorite heart how could we what what would be the measure to merit it who would we compare ourselves to who would be the determining one who would set the level in the mark we look in the natural life of humans lord especially in sports or in great businesses
