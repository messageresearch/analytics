[48:45] [Music]
[48:58] as you continue to play that friend for
[49:02] a moment there there were no written or
[49:06] called in prayer requests I'm sure there
[49:10] are some needs yes as we bow our heads
[49:13] to pray before we minister will consider
[49:17] we remember those who would have a need
[49:19] the Lord as we we've gathered today in
[49:22] that precious name of our Lord and
[49:24] Savior Jesus and you are the light if
[49:28] we're walking in you and you're in us
[49:30] you are that light it's not a light that
[49:32] we manufacture but Jesus is the light of
[49:35] the Father you know the needs that are
[49:38] out there you know whatever they might
[49:41] be Lord every day we're a needy people
[49:43] are to me we need more of you Lord and
[49:46] there's more of you to be Hance the Lord
[49:48] would you minister to any of those or
[49:51] who at this time Lord maybe they're in
[49:52] their home maybe traveling maybe some
[49:54] working wherever they might be today and
[49:56] they're crying out or is it with a need
[49:59] or something would you minister to them
[50:02] Lord and as we Minister the word Lord
[50:05] trusting that it would be you would put
[50:06] the words and you would anoint them in
[50:08] us Lord to minister Lord to those where
[50:11] we have need of you Lord and we know you
[50:14] are the word made life today or become
[50:17] that life that Living Word in us today
[50:19] Lord father we ask it in Jesus Christ
[50:23] we love 4:8 thank you sister amen it's
[50:31] good to think it's good to be in the
[50:34] house of the Lord again this evening and
[50:38] those of you wherever you're gathered
[50:40] today and may that be that place that
[50:44] excited and dedicated this evening and
[50:48] always a place that God is welcome in
[50:51] your home in your vehicle wherever you
[50:54] might be never never a place that God
[50:57] would feel unwelcome but he'll always be
[51:00] welcome there so just appreciate the
[51:03] goodness of the Lord in His grace as we
[51:05] as you hear the news and you read this
[51:08] and you hear that and you just know that
[51:11] God is mindful us and he's in charge of
[51:13] it all and we don't have to fear where
[51:16] God is there is light there is no
[51:18] darkness so and we'll walk in that light
[51:21] and I'd like to read them open up with
[51:23] this scripture found in Jeremiah chapter
[51:27] 1 verse 5 it says where the thoughts
[51:32] started with this scripture it says
[51:34] before I formed thee in the belly I knew
[51:36] thee and before thou camest forth out of
[51:39] the womb I sanctified thee and I
[51:42] ordained thee a prophet unto the nations
[51:44] and that was a word that the Lord spoke
[51:48] to Jeremiah and as I read it and I
[51:51] thought about and I said you know that's
[51:54] for us to also you may be seated those
[51:57] standing here to church are standing at
[51:59] home and as I read that scripture and I
[52:04] was looking at it and I realized that
[52:06] was not only to Jeremiah but each one
[52:10] was known by God when you were formed
[52:14] before he even came out of the womb you
[52:16] were known by God and it might be a
[52:19] strange thought to some that they would
[52:22] think that but he's the eternal one he
[52:25] dwells an eternity and if you were part
[52:27] of God now you were always part of God
[52:29] and so as I spoke to brother Matt on
[52:33] Monday morning we usually do spend a
[52:36] little
[52:37] I'm just going to reviewing the past
[52:40] week and what we're looking forward in
[52:41] in plans for this week and I had several
[52:46] thoughts that had been you know just in
[52:48] my mind and which way to go and his
[52:50] brother Matt ministered I felt this
[52:52] would be the way to go
[52:53] and we shared some things but to know
[52:56] that he knew us and he loved us anyways
[52:59] but he loves his own so as I was looking
[53:06] at this and just the different thoughts
[53:08] that came with and I began to look at
[53:10] there's so many scriptures in the Bible
[53:12] that testify to this that God already
[53:17] knew and and brother Branham says and
[53:20] there's quite a few quotes in you could
[53:22] bring so I chose a few of them but God
[53:25] knew you he even knew your name and
[53:29] we'll show that to some of the
[53:31] scriptures but let's let's take this
[53:32] first quote take him from the message
[53:36] speak to the mountain and he says you
[53:40] say if I knew there was a scripture that
[53:43] pertained to me like that I believe I
[53:46] could have the same faith well my
[53:49] beloved friends every divine promise in
[53:52] the Bible belongs to you and it's just
[53:55] as essential to you as it was to him he
[53:59] says you find one and he was speaking of
[54:02] Abraham there you find one promise here
[54:05] that God has made and all the heavens
[54:08] and earth will pass away before that
[54:09] promise would ever fail to act in your
[54:12] stead because it is to the believer God
[54:16] has given these promises to them that
[54:18] belief and if you have that seat of God
[54:22] in you you are a believer you know and
[54:26] you say well how can that be how could
[54:27] we know every see brings forth of its
[54:30] kind and and based on the scripture and
[54:33] based on the time that we're living this
[54:35] is manifestation time so seeds are
[54:38] bringing forth of their kind so you say
[54:41] well you know my faith is little but it
[54:44] is faith and if you have the faith of a
[54:47] mustard seed you could speak to this
[54:49] mountain
[54:50] and it'll move and brother branham in
[54:52] this semester's speak to this mountain
[54:54] he says this is when you lose it or this
[54:57] is where you lose it when you get up and
[54:58] you spoke to the mountain and you look
[55:00] out the window at the mountain and it
[55:02] doesn't seem to have moved in yourself
[55:04] and he said you lose it right there but
[55:07] he said one grain of sand has moved
[55:09] already and it has began to happen he
[55:12] said then you stand on that and watch
[55:15] how it happens to go so in and say well
[55:18] how does that tie in every scripture
[55:20] pertains to you you're a child of God so
[55:25] from the message identification he says
[55:30] if he is a redeemer he come to redeem
[55:35] become a redeem as to pick up that which
[55:38] has fallen to redeem back to a place
[55:41] where it was at the beginning so none of
[55:44] none will be picked up but what was but
[55:47] them that was with him his thoughts at
[55:51] the beginning now you didn't choose this
[55:55] he chose us you know and he looked back
[56:00] in it and in the scripture that says and
[56:02] and when Abraham was meeting Melchizedek
[56:06] and I've been in his own grandchildren
[56:09] it was the tithe paid where a tribute
[56:11] him because they were in that vintage so
[56:15] again you say well hey I'm not worthy or
[56:17] I'm not good in if it doesn't speak of
[56:19] that and speaks of he thought of you you
[56:24] were part of him and as you go
[56:26] especially later in the messages you
[56:28] start as I was going through looking at
[56:30] these quotes in the beginning brother
[56:33] Branham is making reference to but he
[56:35] said now we are becoming the sons of God
[56:37] but later on as he begins to unveil he
[56:40] because know you were a son of God
[56:43] already the answer realize that you
[56:46] don't work up you don't earn up to that
[56:48] you were a son of God but it's a
[56:49] manifestation time now and it begins as
[56:52] you see as we go to and then in
[56:55] questions and answers look he never went
[57:00] in got dirt and made Eve but he made
[57:02] from the original dirt
[57:04] he took a rib from his side and made him
[57:06] a helpmate that was Eve she was made for
[57:09] the man and part of the men she was part
[57:12] of him in the beginning in the creation
[57:14] in a theophany she was part of him down
[57:17] here in this creation she could not be
[57:20] divided in another creation she had to
[57:23] be made in the same creation so he's
[57:28] speaking in a spiritual sense there he's
[57:31] talking about this had him in this Eve
[57:33] today the second Adam and this Eve that
[57:35] will not fall she's part of him and I
[57:40] know and I've I've seen over the years
[57:42] you've heard and people get to a point
[57:46] and begin to manifest the wrong spirit
[57:48] with that they begin to get proud in
[57:51] themselves they begin to lift themselves
[57:53] up they begin to say things and act in a
[57:56] way that it's contrary to the Spirit of
[57:58] Christ because you're part of him so you
[58:01] have to you would have the same response
[58:03] the same thing and you know and and I do
[58:06] remember there was a situation of a
[58:09] church and the minister was speaking and
[58:13] their windows were open it was a small
[58:15] Church and there was it was right in the
[58:17] middle of a neighborhood and he was
[58:18] speaking and and he's he addresses
[58:20] congregation he was talking to them
[58:23] saying you know you're the bride you're
[58:24] the chosen you're the elect therefore
[58:26] you don't have to treat your neighbors
[58:28] right you don't have to he began to tell
[58:30] them they have nothing to do with the
[58:32] neighbors and begin to put it in a
[58:34] position that we don't belong because
[58:37] that was not Jesus Christ spirit he even
[58:41] cried out Father forgive them they don't
[58:42] know what they're doing if it is
[58:44] possible that's the Spirit of Christ and
[58:49] as I was looking into this and I was
[58:51] sitting down them listening to the
[58:54] brother Matt in the office there Sunday
[58:56] morning and I said Lord you already know
[59:00] what's in my heart and brother Matt's
[59:01] going in this direction right now and I
[59:04] said but what about that spirit and I'll
[59:07] just identify as some of title they call
[59:10] it bride pride as if we made ourselves
[59:14] but we did it make
[59:16] else he did and brother Matt then there
[59:20] at this there at the end of sermon began
[59:22] to talk of having the Spirit of Christ
[59:24] and how it would manifest itself so I
[59:27] said Lord you you have everything but I
[59:29] just I want to I want to just show you
[59:30] this and I don't know that I've ever
[59:32] approached this subject this way but I
[59:35] just felt the Lord began to show me some
[59:37] things here and trusting that that I can
[59:39] deliver it that way
[59:40] in broken cisterns the next quote there
[59:45] I believe it was and I watch rubella
[59:50] Bram says that if I had to if I would
[59:52] have known before there was a world when
[59:55] we were Souls a part of God that we are
[59:58] for we were with him before the
[1:00:00] foundation of the world because there's
[1:00:02] only one form of eternal life and that's
[1:00:04] God and we're a part of him we was not
[1:00:07] so much that we would know and could
[1:00:10] think and had a being but we were in his
[1:00:12] thoughts of what we were before the
[1:00:14] foundation of the world because we are
[1:00:17] part of him like my son is part of me
[1:00:19] and I am part of my father and so forth
[1:00:21] we are sons and daughters of God can we
[1:00:26] move that up a little bit there by his
[1:00:28] foreknowledge and back there if I could
[1:00:31] have known as I know now and could have
[1:00:34] looked over the whole span of time and
[1:00:36] he would have said to me what time do
[1:00:38] you want to live I'd have said this time
[1:00:41] right now just the eve or the ending of
[1:00:44] the world history and the uncommon
[1:00:47] coming of the kingdom of God to be
[1:00:49] established in the earth I think it's a
[1:00:51] most glorious time of all ages is right
[1:00:53] now but God put you here there were
[1:00:57] those even the scripture tell us they
[1:00:59] longed to see this day but God put you
[1:01:01] here for a reason from the message in
[1:01:06] absolute
[1:01:10] and I can see eternity break and come
[1:01:14] down into time since eat and when it did
[1:01:17] there come a line of blood all the way
[1:01:18] up unto of Calvary and from Calvary tied
[1:01:22] with this lining goes on to the post
[1:01:24] Jesus and some day when he comes to
[1:01:26] claim his own everyone that's tied to
[1:01:29] the ultimate will be raised up into
[1:01:31] eternity why they have been in eternity
[1:01:34] all the time they were predestinated to
[1:01:37] attorney return 'ti they are part of God
[1:01:40] they were in his thinking at the
[1:01:43] beginning my brother branham begins to a
[1:01:45] defy you were a thought in his mind and
[1:01:48] and I know that these aren't strange and
[1:01:51] new scriptures or quotes to you but it
[1:01:53] just like to with I think we have two
[1:01:57] more of them to read them who do you say
[1:02:00] this is just notice how if you recognize
[1:02:03] him to be the anointed word of that day
[1:02:05] see God in the beginning being infinite
[1:02:08] and know all things from the beginning
[1:02:09] and the only thing that these things are
[1:02:12] is the display of his attributes and
[1:02:15] attribute you have an attribute it's
[1:02:17] your thought you think of something then
[1:02:19] you speak it then you take it that's God
[1:02:22] he in the beginning if if ever if you
[1:02:26] ever was or ever will be in heaven you
[1:02:28] wasn't heaven to start with you're part
[1:02:30] of God you were his thought he knew your
[1:02:34] name he knew who you were before you
[1:02:36] there ever was a molecule before there
[1:02:39] ever was a light and before there was
[1:02:42] anything he knew you and your name he
[1:02:45] put it in the Lamb's Book of Life before
[1:02:47] the world was ever formed see you were
[1:02:50] his thought and then you became a word
[1:02:53] and a word is a thought expressed and
[1:02:56] there you are manifested and he does
[1:02:59] know your name he knows who you are he
[1:03:02] can call you by name and as I was
[1:03:04] reading some of this I just I was there
[1:03:07] just kind of going over some of these
[1:03:09] thoughts and anything and brother
[1:03:11] branham would be in that prayer line and
[1:03:13] the the the different folks coming up to
[1:03:15] be prayed for and and you know brother
[1:03:19] Branham couldn't do this on his own he
[1:03:21] would say you know what I'm waiting for
[1:03:23] I'm waiting for that angel and then he
[1:03:26] would say he's here and then he would
[1:03:29] begin to speak anyway say now wait a
[1:03:31] minute in case you're from this place
[1:03:34] you were here and he began to tell him
[1:03:36] anyway say now your name is and he would
[1:03:39] tell them their name who was telling him
[1:03:42] that the angel of the Lord was telling
[1:03:44] him that it shows he knows exactly who
[1:03:47] we are and where we come from where
[1:03:49] we've been he knows the end from the
[1:03:52] beginning the beginning from the end
[1:03:54] everything is covered there and then the
[1:03:58] last one Christ is revealed in his own
[1:04:00] word the last quote there now the same
[1:04:08] thing is this if you're a son of God and
[1:04:10] if I am a son of God or a daughter of
[1:04:12] God we were in God at the beginning and
[1:04:14] when Jesus became the fullness of the
[1:04:17] word then we were in him jerm form life
[1:04:21] form seed form and when he was crucified
[1:04:24] we was crucified in his body when he
[1:04:27] arose from the dead we rose with him and
[1:04:29] now since we have recognized it now we
[1:04:32] set together with him in heavenly places
[1:04:35] in Christ Jesus see we if we are sons
[1:04:38] and daughters of God we are God's
[1:04:40] children we are attributes of God so
[1:04:45] then we we we got eternal life and God
[1:04:49] is the only eternal life there is then
[1:04:51] we were in him from the beginning
[1:04:53] and when Jesus became all that word then
[1:04:57] we were part of him then Amen there you
[1:05:00] are that's in there there is no devil no
[1:05:03] power no nothing can ever move it that's
[1:05:06] the type host of the soul you have to
[1:05:09] understand you're not doing this on your
[1:05:12] own it was God that did all the work and
[1:05:14] you can anchor on it because he never
[1:05:16] fails he said if the Sun comes up every
[1:05:19] morning and he in he tells exactly what
[1:05:22] we see every day he said you know my
[1:05:24] word will never fail and he said you
[1:05:28] were part of it and and so it it was
[1:05:32] encouraging to me as I when I read this
[1:05:34] scripture that's what started the
[1:05:35] thought of Jeremiah and I said
[1:05:37] than you knew me also you already knew
[1:05:41] my name you knew you knew my ups and
[1:05:44] downs of my life yet you still you
[1:05:47] didn't say no can't use that one can't
[1:05:49] do that one you knew every situation you
[1:05:52] knew everything that would happen and
[1:05:54] you chose me it was in your thoughts
[1:05:57] nothing that I had to do but he did and
[1:05:59] I'm thankful for that but something in
[1:06:02] me responds back to that and brother
[1:06:05] branham said that's that attribute of
[1:06:07] God in you you know you could be
[1:06:10] somewhere else you could be in another
[1:06:13] and in another religion in another group
[1:06:15] something else you know one day beam up
[1:06:18] and the next day being down one day
[1:06:20] being saved the next day being lost but
[1:06:23] God's children know where they stand and
[1:06:27] now David said in Psalms 138 verse 8 the
[1:06:33] Lord will perfect or accomplish complete
[1:06:37] that which concern a--the me God will
[1:06:42] perfect bring to perfection bring to an
[1:06:44] end bring to a full accomplishment that
[1:06:47] which concerns me thy mercy O Lord
[1:06:49] endures forever
[1:06:51] forsake not the work of thine own hands
[1:06:53] David said don't I'm the work of your
[1:06:56] hands don't forsake me it's not my own
[1:07:00] works it's not my own ability and as as
[1:07:02] brother Peter was leading the song
[1:07:05] service and I just quieted myself down
[1:07:08] and I was kneeling down there and just
[1:07:11] talking to the Lord and each one of us
[1:07:13] you know yourself and you know your
[1:07:15] shortcomings you know your strong points
[1:07:17] brother Bram says each one of us has a
[1:07:19] weak point and we know we have to learn
[1:07:21] to defend that and in life and all and
[1:07:23] we're going and I was just talking to
[1:07:25] the Lord I said help me to get out of
[1:07:27] the way help me to just deliver these
[1:07:29] thoughts and brother Peter begins to say
[1:07:31] heal me O Lord and I shall be healed
[1:07:34] I said thank you Lord you're listening
[1:07:36] and and maybe to nobody else but to me
[1:07:40] just lord knows I'm just trying to say
[1:07:42] Lord I just want to get out of my way
[1:07:44] just I want nothing Lord let this be you
[1:07:47] this speaks and so God just shows us
[1:07:50] in little ways sometimes in great ways
[1:07:52] and a simple thing here whatever it is
[1:07:55] that he's mindful of us Philippians 1:6
[1:08:00] Paul says this in Philippians being
[1:08:03] confident or assured it's a certainty of
[1:08:07] this very thing that he he which have
[1:08:10] begun a good work in you will perform it
[1:08:14] unto the day of Jesus Christ he the
[1:08:17] began of that good work is not going to
[1:08:19] leave it half done sometimes you you go
[1:08:22] by maybe a construction site or you go
[1:08:25] by and you watch this houses have been
[1:08:26] sitting there you drive by it two years
[1:08:28] five years ten years it never went
[1:08:31] beyond that point
[1:08:32] in fact it's falling in decay or or a
[1:08:34] subdivision that they started and I know
[1:08:36] there's one by our house that one
[1:08:38] builder started and there was like ten
[1:08:40] houses there and then the rest of the
[1:08:42] lot set vacant overgrown with with
[1:08:46] shrubs and weeds and all they weren't
[1:08:49] able to complete it they weren't able to
[1:08:51] finish it somebody else then had to come
[1:08:53] in and do it down time but it's had
[1:08:55] vacant for a long time somebody didn't
[1:08:58] count the cost somebody didn't look and
[1:09:00] say am I able to but God counted the
[1:09:03] cost he knew what it would cost him and
[1:09:06] he said I'm willing to go and pay the
[1:09:08] full price for it because I want to
[1:09:11] express those thoughts those attributes
[1:09:13] that were in me so they brought to
[1:09:15] brought me to this point and I don't
[1:09:18] know how far we'll get along today I'll
[1:09:19] try not to be too long but Isaiah
[1:09:22] chapter 7 verse 14 and in one that we we
[1:09:31] all know very well Isaiah 7:14 therefore
[1:09:39] the Lord himself shall give you a sign
[1:09:42] behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[1:09:45] a son and shall call his name Immanuel
[1:09:50] Isaiah I mean Jerry Yan Isaiah he gives
[1:09:55] this God gives this promise and it's
[1:09:58] recorded in the book Isaiah a son to a
[1:10:01] virgin
[1:10:03] his name he didn't say a child shall be
[1:10:07] worn to someone down the road and we'll
[1:10:10] see what they named him it is very
[1:10:12] specific behold a virgin shall conceive
[1:10:16] and bear a son and shall call his name
[1:10:20] Emmanuel now we go from there and and
[1:10:25] you know we've heard you you think about
[1:10:27] it at different different ministers that
[1:10:29] are ministered it and talked about it
[1:10:31] when that promise is given and and the
[1:10:33] congregation the people there believed
[1:10:36] that seeing God fulfilled the word of
[1:10:38] the prophets and and you know people
[1:10:41] began to prepare and make ready for a
[1:10:43] virgin to conceive but he didn't say oh
[1:10:46] by the way this will be eight hundred
[1:10:48] years down the road he just gave the
[1:10:51] promise and brother branham says if we
[1:10:54] read that quote for brother Branham says
[1:10:55] if I would have had a choice and they
[1:10:58] told me I would choose this day because
[1:11:01] this is the fulfillment of the day
[1:11:03] because we have the opportunity and the
[1:11:06] privilege to read and know what this day
[1:11:08] is but then they all began to make
[1:11:11] preparation there's going to be a virgin
[1:11:13] but it had a time and a place so now we
[1:11:17] go to Luke chapter one and we'll look at
[1:11:20] verses 26 to 38 and as I thought about
[1:11:24] this and and and and begin to read the
[1:11:28] scripture here because this when I read
[1:11:30] Jeremiah then this was the next thought
[1:11:33] that came that promise and the
[1:11:35] fulfillment of it in the sixth month the
[1:11:37] angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a
[1:11:40] city of Galilee named Nazareth and it
[1:11:43] stopped and I thought to myself you know
[1:11:47] angel didn't come down and Lord didn't
[1:11:50] say go down to go down to the planet
[1:11:51] Earth go find a virgin and tell her this
[1:11:55] he didn't come down and walk and knock
[1:11:57] on the door excuse me is there a virgin
[1:11:59] in this house I've got a promise to him
[1:12:02] but I don't know who it is no there was
[1:12:05] a he was specific he says a city of
[1:12:08] Galilee named Nazareth to a spouse to a
[1:12:11] man whose name was Joseph all the
[1:12:15] details are put in right there
[1:12:17] of the house of David and the Virgin's
[1:12:19] name was Mary it was very specific to
[1:12:23] one and just like he can call your name
[1:12:28] specifically we've shared those
[1:12:30] testimonies how God has done that it
[1:12:32] showed in the scripture actually called
[1:12:34] out a name we've seen it in the
[1:12:35] testimony we've seen it in the in the in
[1:12:38] reading and hearing the messages God
[1:12:40] knows exactly their home address
[1:12:42] what street they lived and he hasn't
[1:12:44] changed he's the same yesterday today
[1:12:46] and forever you're from this city you
[1:12:50] say I see you're not from here you're
[1:12:52] down kind of south from here in fact
[1:12:54] you're from this city and you live on
[1:12:56] this street and here's your address and
[1:12:58] your name is he's still the same
[1:13:00] yesterday today and forever so it's a
[1:13:03] Gabriel knew exactly where to go because
[1:13:06] God said these are the specifics verse
[1:13:10] 27 28 and the angel came unto her and
[1:13:17] said hail thou art highly favoured the
[1:13:20] Lord is with thee blessed art thou among
[1:13:23] women and when she saw him she was
[1:13:26] troubled had his saying and cast in her
[1:13:28] mind what manual manner of salutation
[1:13:30] should be this is not a standard
[1:13:32] greeting this is not what people come up
[1:13:35] and tell you this is you know maybe at
[1:13:38] the moment she didn't think of hope this
[1:13:40] is Isaiah when Isaiah said and caught
[1:13:43] her by surprise
[1:13:44] how many times did you hear when they
[1:13:46] would say and you would they would begin
[1:13:47] to cry that's exactly the truth that's
[1:13:49] right they couldn't deny it so it caught
[1:13:53] her it was strange to her it was it but
[1:13:56] she didn't say oh this can't be it was
[1:13:58] just different that's gone and the angel
[1:14:05] said unto her fear not Mary be at peace
[1:14:07] about it being arrested about it for
[1:14:09] those found favor with God and behold
[1:14:12] thou shalt conceive in thy womb and
[1:14:14] bring forth a son and shall call his
[1:14:16] name Jesus Emmanuel God is with us and
[1:14:20] he shall be great and shall be called
[1:14:23] the son of the highest and the Lord God
[1:14:26] shall give unto him the throne of his
[1:14:27] father
[1:14:29] not only that but he told him where the
[1:14:32] lineage went back and where the throne
[1:14:35] was there was no there was no question
[1:14:37] about this and he shall reign over the
[1:14:44] house of Jacob for error
[1:14:45] forever and of his kingdom there shall
[1:14:48] be no end
[1:14:49] now watch there is a part for us to play
[1:14:53] oh well lord chose me oh right great no
[1:14:57] then Mary said unto the angel how shall
[1:15:00] this be seen I know not a man she has a
[1:15:02] question this is not how you have
[1:15:06] children this is not what happens how
[1:15:09] can this be
[1:15:11] she does have a question last two verses
[1:15:15] and the angel said answered and said
[1:15:18] unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon
[1:15:21] thee and the power of the highest shall
[1:15:24] overshadow thee therefore also that holy
[1:15:27] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[1:15:29] be called the Son of God he says it's
[1:15:33] not gonna be of your ability it's not
[1:15:35] gonna be your work it's not anything
[1:15:38] that a man's gonna have to do it's God
[1:15:40] the Holy Ghost having overshadowing you
[1:15:43] and you know what it's the exact same
[1:15:45] thing today it's not of our ability it's
[1:15:49] us yielding to the Holy Ghost and
[1:15:50] letting him have his way and watch her
[1:15:52] answer here did I did I miss the one
[1:15:58] scripture be it unto me according to of
[1:16:02] it and behold thy cousin Elizabeth I'm
[1:16:04] I'm sorry I I think I go ahead back
[1:16:07] thirty Six's and behold thy cousin
[1:16:10] Elizabeth she have also conceived a son
[1:16:13] in her old age and this is a six month
[1:16:15] with her who was called barren he knows
[1:16:19] Elizabeth by name and he knows exactly
[1:16:22] what's going on with her and for with
[1:16:26] God nothing shall be impossible in God's
[1:16:32] Word never returns void and this is
[1:16:34] Mary's response and Mary said Behold the
[1:16:37] handmaid of the Lord be it unto me
[1:16:40] according to
[1:16:42] thy word and the angel departed from her
[1:16:46] she had to make that a declaration of
[1:16:50] faith say be it unto me according there
[1:16:55] comes a time in your life whenever it is
[1:16:58] when you have to make that same choice
[1:17:01] lord I am that promise is mine be it
[1:17:06] unto me according to thy word and that's
[1:17:10] seed then that that that that that was
[1:17:12] implanted in her by the Holy Ghost
[1:17:15] begins to grow begins to form and and
[1:17:21] there is a time and and we know in a
[1:17:24] human it's it's about nine months it can
[1:17:26] vary a little bit but there is amount of
[1:17:27] time so there is a space of time a
[1:17:30] growth period could I put it that way of
[1:17:33] the manifestation of Christ in you there
[1:17:38] there is a growing a bringing to
[1:17:40] maturity of and brother Branham says in
[1:17:43] this age I would want to leave why
[1:17:45] because this is when the full
[1:17:47] manifestation of a child of God the
[1:17:50] Bride of Christ and again you say well
[1:17:53] how do you know that the scripture tells
[1:17:55] us when these things begin to happen
[1:17:58] when you begin to see the fulfillment of
[1:18:01] these things when these prophecies these
[1:18:03] events look up your Redemption draweth
[1:18:06] nigh this is the day we're looking at
[1:18:09] that now you would say well what a
[1:18:11] marvelous thing with Mary that God would
[1:18:14] know her and as she accepts it and and
[1:18:16] you know we know the history and the
[1:18:18] story of Mary she was raised there as a
[1:18:21] young lady in the temple she never went
[1:18:24] out into the world that is recorded well
[1:18:26] well of course she deserved it
[1:18:30] let's look at another one here let's go
[1:18:34] to Acts chapter 7 and we'll gonna go
[1:18:38] through chapters 7 8 9 parts of it we'll
[1:18:42] start first with 758 through 60 and this
[1:18:46] was when Steven was was being stoned and
[1:18:49] cast him out of the city and stoned him
[1:18:51] and the witnesses laid down their
[1:18:54] clothes at the young
[1:18:55] man's feet whose name was saw and they
[1:18:59] stoned Stephen calling upon God and
[1:19:00] saying and they stoned Stephen calling
[1:19:04] upon God and saying Lord Jesus receive
[1:19:06] my spirit and he kneeled down and cried
[1:19:08] with a loud voice Lord lay not this sin
[1:19:11] to their charge and when he had said
[1:19:13] this he fell asleep this is after acts
[1:19:18] 2:38 the spirit of Christ and Stephen
[1:19:21] says lay this not to their charge now
[1:19:28] you begin to see the attributes of
[1:19:30] Christ in a man of the Holy Ghost in a
[1:19:33] person but look saul was there and you
[1:19:38] and I would have looked at Saul and
[1:19:40] blamed this on him now wait a minute
[1:19:44] Saul consented to their death that's
[1:19:47] going to acts 8 1 2 4 and Saul was
[1:19:52] consenting unto his death and at that
[1:19:55] time there was great persecution against
[1:19:57] the church which was at Jerusalem and
[1:19:59] they were all scattered abroad
[1:20:00] throughout the reasons of Judea and
[1:20:02] Samaria except the Apostles the church
[1:20:05] began to be scattered around he says and
[1:20:08] devout man carried Stephen to his a
[1:20:10] burial and made great lamentation over
[1:20:13] him not realizing that this was part of
[1:20:17] the plan of God you and I would have
[1:20:20] said hey this is all wrong
[1:20:23] but and force as for Saul he made havoc
[1:20:26] of the church entering into every house
[1:20:28] and Haley men and women committed them
[1:20:31] to prison you know when Satan knows
[1:20:35] someone is getting close and opening
[1:20:38] their heart he's going to turn
[1:20:39] everything he can against it and I can
[1:20:43] tell her this when we first heard the
[1:20:44] message I was a young man 14 15 years
[1:20:47] old and and we were still living in
[1:20:50] California the message just come we're
[1:20:51] listening to the tapes and we're and and
[1:20:55] it was it was an exciting time for us to
[1:20:57] to to hear something that was beyond the
[1:21:01] emotion of a Pentecost sure - when -
[1:21:03] then those those that had had come in
[1:21:06] the Pentecostal or should I say that
[1:21:09] the 40s 50s 60s like my parents and
[1:21:12] maybe some of your parents and and saw
[1:21:15] the reality of it when I got there I saw
[1:21:18] the entertainment of it I still remember
[1:21:20] that going to services and this was the
[1:21:24] move of the Holy Spirit and watch it
[1:21:26] become just an entertainment
[1:21:28] the music would start and all the young
[1:21:31] people sat in the first two or three
[1:21:32] rows and as soon as the music started
[1:21:34] and they had the drums all all the young
[1:21:36] people were jumping and shouting and
[1:21:38] they're screaming and yelling and as
[1:21:39] soon as the music started so did the
[1:21:41] dancing and I usually sat with our
[1:21:45] parents and I noticed it and then the
[1:21:48] minister would get to speaking and half
[1:21:50] of the young people would walk of church
[1:21:51] and they wouldn't stay in there until
[1:21:52] after and then the worship starting
[1:21:54] today come back in I caught the end of
[1:21:56] it the entertainment of it and when this
[1:22:00] message comes that we began to hear it
[1:22:02] begins to say this is what I've been
[1:22:04] longing for this is there's some reality
[1:22:06] in this and what an excitement so I
[1:22:10] remember dad he made he we had a
[1:22:12] three-car Garage and he made a little
[1:22:14] portion of it put some chairs so we
[1:22:16] could have Church in there and we
[1:22:18] received the message of the movie the
[1:22:21] deep call is to the deep and dad want to
[1:22:25] show so we invited our relatives we
[1:22:26] invited the neighbors and began to to
[1:22:30] watch Deep Ecology and there was a
[1:22:32] response from the some of the relatives
[1:22:34] and like wow this is absolutely amazing
[1:22:36] this is God and suddenly the door opens
[1:22:40] to the garage the light gets flicked on
[1:22:42] and the pastor of the church that we
[1:22:45] were attending comes in and he begins to
[1:22:47] scream and yell at us turns out turn
[1:22:50] that thing off that's of the devil and
[1:22:52] just totally opposes it
[1:22:55] well the shocked us all over here we are
[1:22:57] all you know and some of those folks
[1:22:59] that were there never came back never
[1:23:02] know because Satan will oppose the truth
[1:23:06] every time he's always tried to put a
[1:23:10] stop to it so here's salt okay and and
[1:23:15] and it scatters the people and it
[1:23:18] doesn't look like it's a work of God the
[1:23:21] people are scattered
[1:23:22] Sall is threatening he's having people
[1:23:25] committed to prison but we know the rest
[1:23:30] of the story let's go to chapter 9
[1:23:35] therefore that we had already read that
[1:23:37] I believe chapter 9 and saw yet
[1:23:41] breathing out threatenings and slaughter
[1:23:42] against the disciples of the Lord went
[1:23:44] unto the high priests and desired of him
[1:23:47] letters to Damascus to the synagogue's
[1:23:49] that if he found any of this way whether
[1:23:53] they were men or women he might bring
[1:23:54] them bound into Jerusalem Paul in his in
[1:23:59] his great
[1:24:01] what would you what's the word I'm
[1:24:02] looking for in his his zeal his want to
[1:24:07] crush this heresy because Paul says
[1:24:11] later in this way that's called heresy
[1:24:13] it's now the way I serve the Lord but to
[1:24:16] him it was an area I'm going to put a
[1:24:18] stop to this he says and as he journeyed
[1:24:21] he came near Damascus and suddenly there
[1:24:23] was shined around him a light from
[1:24:26] heaven and he fell to the earth and
[1:24:29] heard a voice saying to him Saul Saul
[1:24:31] why persecutest thou me and Paul Saul at
[1:24:37] this time still knowing the Scriptures
[1:24:40] because he knew the scriptures he knew
[1:24:43] the law as he tells you later on he says
[1:24:46] if you want to if you want to compare
[1:24:48] experiences of knowledge ability let me
[1:24:50] tell you of mine he knew the scriptures
[1:24:53] he knew what is it and he realizes this
[1:24:57] is God and he says who aren't though and
[1:24:59] he said who art thou Lord and the Lord
[1:25:03] said I am Jesus whom thou persecute us
[1:25:05] it is hard for thee to kick against the
[1:25:08] pricks and heat timber trembling and
[1:25:10] astonished said Lord what will thou have
[1:25:13] me to do the same guy that just a minute
[1:25:18] ago
[1:25:18] five minutes ago whatever amount of time
[1:25:20] this experience was was on his way to
[1:25:23] get those Christians thrown into jail
[1:25:27] and and to death or what else now he
[1:25:29] says what will you
[1:25:31] me to do now you could read the whole
[1:25:34] story when when you know we won't go
[1:25:37] into all of it but when Paul comes back
[1:25:39] they're saying isn't this the same Paul
[1:25:42] that wrecked havoc with the children
[1:25:44] Christians the people were still very
[1:25:47] about it okay let's go on the next and
[1:25:52] the man were journeyed with him stood
[1:25:54] speechless hearing the voice but see no
[1:25:56] man
[1:25:56] this was to Paul and saw rose from the
[1:26:00] earth and when his eyes were open he saw
[1:26:02] no man but they led him by the hand and
[1:26:05] he brought and brought him into Damascus
[1:26:07] he still went into Damascus as he was
[1:26:09] going and he was there three days
[1:26:13] without sight and neither did eat nor
[1:26:15] drink and there was a certain disciple
[1:26:17] at Damascus named Ananias and the Lord
[1:26:20] had to him had the said the Lord in a
[1:26:23] vision and an eye as he said behold I am
[1:26:25] here Lord Ananias had already known the
[1:26:28] voice of God being being a man a prophet
[1:26:32] he knew that so here I am Lord this is
[1:26:35] you I know that and it should be in our
[1:26:38] lives to a place well that we know when
[1:26:40] God is speaking when God is calling us
[1:26:41] one and get our attention there we
[1:26:44] should say Here I am stop for a moment
[1:26:45] say Lord is that you know yeah let's go
[1:26:50] on come to the next yeah and they said
[1:26:56] and the Lord said unto Him arise and go
[1:26:59] into the street which is called straight
[1:27:00] again look at the details are and
[1:27:03] inquire in the house of Judas for one
[1:27:06] called Saul of Tarsus before behold he
[1:27:09] prayeth again I'm just I'm trying to
[1:27:12] show you how specific goddess he knows
[1:27:16] everything about it and he is he has
[1:27:19] seen in a vision a man named Ananias
[1:27:22] coming in and putting his hand on him
[1:27:24] that he might receive his sight and then
[1:27:29] Ananias answered said Lord have you read
[1:27:33] the news lately have you been staying
[1:27:36] up-to-date with the news Lord do you
[1:27:37] know what's happening out there do you
[1:27:39] know who this Saul is and what he's done
[1:27:42] kind of like I sometimes lower
[1:27:44] where are you in this I think Lord that
[1:27:49] that that if you were in this it would
[1:27:51] be going in this direction it would be
[1:27:52] it wouldn't be so hard it wouldn't
[1:27:54] there's a reason for it I nice Ananias
[1:27:57] answered lord I have heard by many of
[1:27:59] this man how much evil he had done to
[1:28:02] the Saints at Jerusalem to thy Saints
[1:28:04] and here he hath authority from the
[1:28:06] chief priests to bind all that call him
[1:28:08] thy name Lord are you aware of this but
[1:28:12] the Lord said unto him go thy way for he
[1:28:15] is a chosen vessel unto me I know him by
[1:28:21] name I've called him a fact I called him
[1:28:23] I said Saul Saul he's a chosen vessel to
[1:28:28] bear my name before the Gentiles and
[1:28:30] kings and the children of Israel for I
[1:28:32] will show him how great things he must
[1:28:35] suffer for my name's sake the same one
[1:28:39] who just a couple days previous to that
[1:28:42] is attacking the Christians trying to
[1:28:45] destroy them God has st. him I've chose
[1:28:48] him and he's called to do this again I
[1:28:53] just want to show you Isaiah tells of a
[1:28:57] virgin to be conceived of origin
[1:28:59] conceiving and his name shall be called
[1:29:01] and is it and we look at Mary and we say
[1:29:04] well sure she was a holy child she was
[1:29:07] raised in the temple she never went out
[1:29:09] into the world she was raised in church
[1:29:10] and all she was worthy of it
[1:29:12] well then how do you explain Saul it's
[1:29:16] God's choosing it's God's doing it's not
[1:29:19] mine it's not yours it was not brother
[1:29:21] branham's choosing to be the prophet of
[1:29:24] this day it was God in the back of his
[1:29:26] mind although when we look at it now as
[1:29:28] brother Brown said I would have chosen
[1:29:30] if I got in the truth to live in this
[1:29:32] day to see the fulfillment all of this
[1:29:35] but God chose it that way just like God
[1:29:38] chose it that way for you
[1:29:44] now again we look at those things why
[1:29:47] brother branham why Oral Roberts why
[1:29:52] Billy Graham because God chose it that
[1:29:54] way each one playing their part when
[1:29:57] when Elohim comes down the three men
[1:30:00] come down and visit Abraham and why
[1:30:04] Abraham his father made idols that they
[1:30:09] weren't even Christians we could say
[1:30:10] they weren't believers but before the
[1:30:14] foundation of the world as brother Ram
[1:30:16] said in the back part of his mind in his
[1:30:17] thoughts
[1:30:18] he was there already because the
[1:30:21] scripture tell us before the foundation
[1:30:23] of the world he was slain to him all of
[1:30:27] that and if brother Branham says he was
[1:30:29] in eternity we know it in a block of
[1:30:31] time but he was an eternity and you were
[1:30:33] part of it so here we would wonder why
[1:30:37] brother Branham hawaii's man because God
[1:30:39] chose it that way why didn't he take
[1:30:42] this man he seemed to be an even brother
[1:30:45] branham when he walks through a Roberts
[1:30:47] University and he's looking at his
[1:30:50] grandeur and the splendor and all of it
[1:30:52] and brother Branham begins to say Lord
[1:30:54] you must have not had confidence in me
[1:30:56] you must have known that that I wouldn't
[1:30:59] be able to handle this wealth this
[1:31:00] beauty to me it's just given a little -
[1:31:03] I just got you know and he describes his
[1:31:05] is his living and and how they were
[1:31:07] raised and what he had and all so in his
[1:31:10] mind he's looking at himself and saying
[1:31:11] I couldn't have done this Lord you would
[1:31:13] know didn't have that confidence in me
[1:31:16] but you know what there was something
[1:31:19] greater than that because as it when he
[1:31:22] walks out and he steps out of that or
[1:31:25] Roberts University and the Lord tells
[1:31:28] him because I am your and that's exactly
[1:31:34] what I want to hear I am NOT this
[1:31:38] world's good not the popularity not to
[1:31:41] be well-known not to be no but he is my
[1:31:45] portion he is mine and I am his now if
[1:31:50] brother Branham would have had like he
[1:31:52] said the the education the study that he
[1:31:55] might have depended on some of that
[1:31:57] he might have looked at it Paul said I
[1:31:59] had to learn to let all of that go I had
[1:32:02] to count it as nothing but for a reason
[1:32:06] God allowed Paul do because Paul was
[1:32:08] going to write a lot of the New
[1:32:10] Testament so God allowed it to be to him
[1:32:13] to know the Scriptures and have the
[1:32:14] ability to do it but he didn't need that
[1:32:18] in this age these scriptures didn't have
[1:32:20] to be written again they were written
[1:32:22] already they were going to be
[1:32:24] demonstrated to be living to be the same
[1:32:26] yesterday he needed a man they could
[1:32:28] humble himself and surrender himself and
[1:32:30] yield himself and say Here I am Lord and
[1:32:33] I'm not trusting because I know I don't
[1:32:35] have the abilities to do these things
[1:32:37] and that's sometimes where we get into a
[1:32:39] little bit of trouble lord I prayed all
[1:32:41] night Lord I studied all night
[1:32:43] Lord I'd done this I'd done that and I'm
[1:32:45] not saying not to do that but don't
[1:32:47] depend on it you depend on the Lord to
[1:32:51] do what he says I know brother green
[1:32:52] used to tell us ministering wise he said
[1:32:55] study like there's no God and then come
[1:32:59] out depending on God like you never
[1:33:01] studied there's a big difference in
[1:33:05] agency so we see these two two opposites
[1:33:10] if I could put it that way here Saul and
[1:33:12] here's Mary both fulfilling the Word of
[1:33:16] God and he says I knew both of you I
[1:33:18] knew where to send the angel I knew
[1:33:21] where to meet you Paul I knew where to
[1:33:23] Santa Anna Ananias I knew where where
[1:33:25] you were going to be and I knew what you
[1:33:27] were gonna do and he's the same
[1:33:30] yesterday today and forever now let's
[1:33:33] look at first Peter 2:9 and I believe
[1:33:35] brother Jeremy had this put up here
[1:33:38] before service but ye are a chosen
[1:33:41] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[1:33:46] nation a peculiar people that ye should
[1:33:50] show forth the praises of him who hath
[1:33:53] called you out of darkness into his
[1:33:55] marvelous light you're chosen and it's
[1:34:00] not a eenie meenie miney mo I'll take
[1:34:03] one I'll take the odd numbers I'll take
[1:34:05] thee no you were part of him you were an
[1:34:07] expression of him
[1:34:09] I like this but you're a chosen raced a
[1:34:12] priesthood of a kingly lineage this is a
[1:34:18] holy nation of people belonging
[1:34:20] specially to God that you may make known
[1:34:23] the perfection of him who has called you
[1:34:26] out of darkness into his marvelous that
[1:34:28] I nu God will be made manifest perfected
[1:34:33] shown but you are an Electress a royal
[1:34:37] pre-hook priesthood a holy nation a
[1:34:39] people for God's own possession that ye
[1:34:44] may show forth the excellencies of him
[1:34:46] was called you out of darkness into his
[1:34:48] own Marvis li it's God's working you you
[1:34:52] got to put your name in there you've got
[1:34:53] to see that you're part of it you know
[1:34:57] and this is what Peter is saying you're
[1:34:59] a chosen generation and and and to each
[1:35:03] generation you could say this scripture
[1:35:06] to blame because to each generation they
[1:35:07] had a part to fulfill but there comes a
[1:35:10] time when it's all fulfilled and and
[1:35:13] he's and it's still the same yesterday
[1:35:14] and then Peter says in first Peter 1
[1:35:17] verse 2 elect according to the
[1:35:21] foreknowledge of God the Father brother
[1:35:25] Ram talks about predestination being
[1:35:27] foreknowledge not that he just decided
[1:35:31] well I'm gonna make a choice today I'm
[1:35:33] gonna take this one but I want to know
[1:35:35] it was foreknowledge he knew because he
[1:35:38] already had representation there
[1:35:41] he said elect according to the
[1:35:43] foreknowledge of God the Father through
[1:35:45] sanctification of the Spirit unto
[1:35:46] obedience and sprinkling of the blood of
[1:35:49] Jesus Christ grace unto you and peace be
[1:35:53] multiplied grace unto you he called your
[1:35:57] name out grace I don't know how many
[1:36:00] times you read the scripture and you see
[1:36:01] grace in there you say thank you Lord
[1:36:04] for grace you can take it personally I
[1:36:07] know when I read and I see my name in
[1:36:09] there I say thank you Lord my name is in
[1:36:11] there if I'm not any more smarter than
[1:36:14] that at least I can read my name in
[1:36:16] there but you know it is the grace of
[1:36:19] God
[1:36:20] his his own choosing as to it not to him
[1:36:23] that willeth but to whom God chooses
[1:36:25] here now let's look at how Paul deals
[1:36:29] with some of this here in Romans chapter
[1:36:34] 9 we'll go through 11 through 16 here
[1:36:37] and again for the children be not born
[1:36:40] not yet born neither having done any
[1:36:43] good or evil that the purpose of God
[1:36:46] according to election might stand not of
[1:36:50] works but of him that calleth nothing
[1:36:54] you did to deserve to earn there was no
[1:36:57] could I say a thing we had to earn this
[1:37:01] you got to meet this standard in order
[1:37:03] to become a child of God no he said it's
[1:37:06] not it is by grace he said it was said
[1:37:10] unto her the elder shall serve the
[1:37:12] younger
[1:37:16] as it is written Jacob have I loved but
[1:37:20] Esau have I hated what shall we say then
[1:37:23] is there unrighteousness with God said
[1:37:26] God for a bit no it's nothing to do with
[1:37:29] unrighteousness
[1:37:30] he says for he saith to Moses I will
[1:37:33] have mercy on whom I will have mercy and
[1:37:35] I will have compassion on whom I will
[1:37:37] have compassion so then it is not of him
[1:37:40] that willeth nor of him that runneth but
[1:37:42] of God that show is Murthy and you know
[1:37:47] what I don't know who those are and you
[1:37:50] don't know though whose are you just
[1:37:51] need to make sure your calling and
[1:37:54] election is sure God doesn't have to
[1:37:58] make your calling and election sure he
[1:38:00] knows it it's not god that's wondering
[1:38:03] about you it's sometimes you wondering
[1:38:05] about yourself if I was really a son of
[1:38:08] God if I would did I wouldn't struggle I
[1:38:10] wouldn't go through this and we begin to
[1:38:12] look at ourselves that way and we might
[1:38:13] trouble ourselves don't get frustrated
[1:38:15] with ourselves because it seems like
[1:38:17] sometimes we run godly but the scripture
[1:38:22] tells us you make sure of your election
[1:38:25] you check it over you look at it closely
[1:38:28] God is sure of it it's just settling it
[1:38:31] in your own heart
[1:38:33] Lord I surrender all Lord I yield to you
[1:38:37] III do this not because I'm trying to
[1:38:40] merit your goodness not because I'm
[1:38:42] trying to merit salvation I do this
[1:38:44] because I want to show you that I love
[1:38:46] you and I care for you you know III
[1:38:48] refer to that quite often in a
[1:38:50] relationship especially through a
[1:38:52] husband and wife if we're still trying
[1:38:55] to merit the the affection and the love
[1:38:58] and and and should I say the respect and
[1:39:01] we've been married 20 30 or 40 years and
[1:39:03] we still haven't figured out how to do
[1:39:04] it I would say that relationships not
[1:39:06] doing too good but a relationship after
[1:39:10] it's began to build and to begin he
[1:39:11] didn't you know you learn it it's a
[1:39:13] learning process it's an experience you
[1:39:15] go through but a time comes in their
[1:39:17] relationship that it's based on the love
[1:39:19] for one another that's the motive behind
[1:39:22] it all I do this because I want her to
[1:39:25] be happy I do this because it pleases
[1:39:27] her I do this because I love her
[1:39:29] not because if I don't do it she's going
[1:39:31] to be mad at me or it's the same way
[1:39:34] with God I'm not doing this to try to
[1:39:36] please you so you won't be mad at me
[1:39:38] Lord I'm doing this because I love you
[1:39:39] you've already showed your love to me
[1:39:42] you already gave your life you gave your
[1:39:44] all for me I just want to give my all
[1:39:46] back for you because I want that
[1:39:47] relationship with you it's the same way
[1:39:50] he said to do him God show as a mercy
[1:39:54] Colossians 3:12 there 17 put on
[1:40:00] therefore as the elect of God holy and
[1:40:03] beloved bowels of mercy kindness
[1:40:06] humbleness of mind
[1:40:08] meekness and long-suffering who is Paul
[1:40:11] describing right there none other than
[1:40:16] Jesus that's describing him bowels of
[1:40:21] mercy kindness humbleness of my meekness
[1:40:23] long-suffering he says put on others put
[1:40:27] on Christ receive him receive the whole
[1:40:30] let him manifest himself forbearing one
[1:40:33] another and forgiving one another Father
[1:40:35] forgive them they know not what they do
[1:40:38] having that spirit and if any man have a
[1:40:41] quarrel against any even as Christ
[1:40:42] forgave you so also do you
[1:40:46] Paul is just giving a long explanation
[1:40:50] as put on Christ the nature and the
[1:40:53] character of Christ is gone and above
[1:41:00] all things put on charity which is the
[1:41:02] bond of perfectness for we know charity
[1:41:04] is gone we know the whole motive God is
[1:41:08] love is perfect love me and Rachel's
[1:41:11] we're coming in the church and she comes
[1:41:14] with me usually to drive me home want
[1:41:16] him to drive me home at night my vision
[1:41:18] is not as good and I'm usually tired
[1:41:20] after ministering so I just feel safer
[1:41:22] although sometimes the way she drives I
[1:41:24] get prayed up to so I got to say no I'm
[1:41:27] just kidding about them but we're
[1:41:30] talking about that the motive what is
[1:41:33] the motive behind the action and we are
[1:41:36] talking a little about and the things
[1:41:37] are happening today and how the fear has
[1:41:40] swept into the people so much fear so
[1:41:42] much nervousness so much what's going on
[1:41:45] what's going on what's going to happen
[1:41:47] you know what do you think about it ask
[1:41:50] your opinion and all and I said well
[1:41:52] fear is what Satan works with that's
[1:41:56] what he's always worked with through
[1:41:58] fear but god's motive god is love and
[1:42:01] his motive is love and everything that
[1:42:04] god is does is motivated by love for you
[1:42:07] and because it is love when he chastises
[1:42:11] you when he corrects you when he gets
[1:42:13] your attention it is for your good
[1:42:15] not for your condemnation not to put you
[1:42:18] down not to make you feel worthless see
[1:42:20] you're not a child of God
[1:42:21] then you begin to brother brother green
[1:42:23] used to say it this way condemnation
[1:42:27] it's what Satan uses to to talk to you
[1:42:30] with see if you were really a child of
[1:42:33] God you would have done that you
[1:42:34] wouldn't had a thought you wouldn't
[1:42:35] acted like that you know and he begins
[1:42:38] but conviction is what God were see says
[1:42:41] now daughter no son you know you know
[1:42:45] that's not how a Christian asks so let's
[1:42:48] do something about it and he comes and
[1:42:49] he touches your heart he talks to your
[1:42:51] heart you say Lord you're right I'm
[1:42:52] sorry
[1:42:53] I'll make that right I'll take care of
[1:42:55] that I don't want to offend you neither
[1:42:56] do I want to offend any of your children
[1:42:59] I don't want to offend anybody because I
[1:43:02] don't know remember brother branham is
[1:43:04] ministering in his preaching and he says
[1:43:06] he said don't call them Rickey's and
[1:43:09] Raquette us because some of them are my
[1:43:11] children I don't know who they are and
[1:43:16] my God had mercy in me I would ask God
[1:43:18] to have mercy on them again he says put
[1:43:21] on charity which is the bond of perfect
[1:43:23] completeness wholeness and let the peace
[1:43:26] of God rule in your hearts to the which
[1:43:29] also you are called in one body and be
[1:43:32] thankful let the word of Christ dwell in
[1:43:37] you richly in all wisdom teaching and
[1:43:40] admonishing one another in Psalms and
[1:43:42] hymns and spiritual songs singing with
[1:43:45] grace in your hearts your Lord you know
[1:43:47] the song is a song of worship it's a
[1:43:49] song of gratitude it's a song of praise
[1:43:52] back to him your heart is just the song
[1:43:55] is thing is to worship him to praise him
[1:43:57] to lift him up it's not a song and in in
[1:43:59] some of the songs that are being in
[1:44:01] composed today and they call him
[1:44:03] Christian songs and sometimes you listen
[1:44:05] and there is no worship to God in them
[1:44:06] it's self gratification it's just self
[1:44:09] praise it's a lifting up of self but he
[1:44:11] says in singing and spiritual songs
[1:44:15] Psalm singing with grace in your hearts
[1:44:17] to the Lord
[1:44:18] understanding Lord this is my love and
[1:44:20] my worship back to you and whatsoever
[1:44:23] you doing were in word or deed do all in
[1:44:27] the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks
[1:44:29] to God and the Father by him everything
[1:44:33] is based under that motive and that way
[1:44:35] we do and you know I know everybody in
[1:44:39] here and those listening you never get
[1:44:41] upset you never get angry and ever
[1:44:43] you never think a bad thought because
[1:44:45] you guys are all way ahead of me I know
[1:44:47] that but some of us know we're not there
[1:44:50] yet so sometimes we have to say Lord I'm
[1:44:53] sorry and sometimes I have to go to my
[1:44:56] brother and my sister my wife one of my
[1:44:58] children my coworker so my hey I'm sorry
[1:45:01] I shouldn't act it that way
[1:45:03] I shouldn't have done that and he says
[1:45:05] again that's it and whatever you do in
[1:45:07] word or deed do all in the name of the
[1:45:09] Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the
[1:45:11] Father if
[1:45:13] in my asking for forgiveness in my
[1:45:15] humble in myself that fits right in
[1:45:18] there because that's how father that's
[1:45:21] how Jesus was that same spirit saying
[1:45:23] Lord lay it not against their charge
[1:45:26] don't hold him guilty for it Lord
[1:45:30] forgive them give him a chance give him
[1:45:33] an opportunity brother branham the Lord
[1:45:35] said they're going to lay a trick for
[1:45:37] you there Satan is going to come in and
[1:45:39] he's going to try to and and he talks
[1:45:41] about that that young couple he said
[1:45:43] that they were being ungodly in the
[1:45:45] church and he said anything you say will
[1:45:48] be and he looks at him but the Spirit of
[1:45:52] Christ in the man says I forgive you
[1:45:57] I'm glad that Spirit of Christ says I
[1:46:01] forgive you because how many times have
[1:46:03] we needed forgiveness have we needed the
[1:46:05] Lord to say son daughter I forgive you
[1:46:08] and he says do everything in the name of
[1:46:10] logic all that I say or do let it be
[1:46:13] pleasing Lord to you now he says you
[1:46:18] know we look at this and we say well
[1:46:20] brother Aaron you know if I'm elect I'm
[1:46:23] chosen of God I'm his you know then you
[1:46:27] know it's I've got it made
[1:46:29] I can be what I want to be I can do as I
[1:46:32] want I'd question that a child of God is
[1:46:37] not that way a child of God is looking
[1:46:38] and saying Lord let my life be pleasing
[1:46:41] to you let me a being a true ambassador
[1:46:44] of the kingdom of God just like a
[1:46:47] husband and wife or just like parents to
[1:46:49] children just like a brother and his
[1:46:51] sister just like a mother and a father
[1:46:53] to their own children if we're truly a
[1:46:56] true father a true mother with her we're
[1:46:59] not looking to hurt to damage to take a
[1:47:01] rule over them we're trying to encourage
[1:47:03] or trying to raise them I was talking a
[1:47:05] little bit with Rachel as in the
[1:47:07] sometimes you might have thought the dad
[1:47:09] and mom were angry with you upset with
[1:47:12] you and we might have been at times I'm
[1:47:13] gonna saying we were we weren't at times
[1:47:15] but it was it was we are our motive was
[1:47:18] to help to raise you to be a young lady
[1:47:22] a Christian lady grow up and they say
[1:47:24] that was our motive we mean
[1:47:25] always done it right but that was our
[1:47:27] motive now in today's world sometimes
[1:47:30] it's not the motive of people I was
[1:47:32] listening to a testimony of a young lady
[1:47:34] or she was giving her testimony as she
[1:47:36] was trying to to speak to other women
[1:47:38] who had and she talked about her raising
[1:47:40] and and and how she was she was
[1:47:44] trafficked out to two men and everything
[1:47:46] and and all that she was raised in and
[1:47:50] such an ungodly thing and it is out in
[1:47:55] the world it does happen I'm not saying
[1:47:56] it doesn't but when you have Christian
[1:47:59] parents and when you have God in you
[1:48:00] you're at you're your hope your desire
[1:48:02] all you want to do is to raise to
[1:48:04] encourage to lift somewhat of the Lord
[1:48:05] just like you were merciful merciful to
[1:48:09] me be merciful to that one also remember
[1:48:12] Jesus when he's talking about that that
[1:48:14] man that was laying there on the side of
[1:48:16] the road and he was wounded and hurt and
[1:48:18] he said and the priest gave it a wide
[1:48:20] turn and the leave I gave him oh I
[1:48:22] turned and everybody the Christians all
[1:48:25] went around him but the Samaritan came
[1:48:28] by and took and he dressed them any any
[1:48:32] any any help can clean up his wounds and
[1:48:34] he took him to the end close by and says
[1:48:36] take care of this man and and here
[1:48:39] here's some money to cover it and when I
[1:48:43] come back because I will be coming back
[1:48:44] through here if there's any more I'll
[1:48:46] pick up that charge - that's the life of
[1:48:49] a Christian because of the grace of God
[1:48:53] in their life they realize that that's
[1:48:55] how God treated them and again Paul is
[1:48:59] talking about this and in Romans chapter
[1:49:02] 11 and I don't know how far along we'll
[1:49:05] get on this but let's look at Romans
[1:49:07] chapter 11 starting with verse 1 and
[1:49:09] Rome and and Paul here is speaking about
[1:49:14] his children his people Israel and he
[1:49:18] said I say then hath God cast away his
[1:49:20] people god forbid for I also AM an
[1:49:23] Israelite of the seed of Abraham of the
[1:49:25] tribe of Benjamin God hath not cast away
[1:49:29] his people which he foreknew what not
[1:49:32] that ye the scripture saith of Elias how
[1:49:35] he maketh intercession to God against
[1:49:37] Israel saying
[1:49:40] let's go on Lord they have killed thy
[1:49:43] prophets and digged down thine altars
[1:49:45] and I am left alone and they seek my
[1:49:47] life but what saith the answer of God
[1:49:50] and to him I have reserved to myself
[1:49:52] seven thousand men who have not bowed
[1:49:55] the knees the knee to the image of bale
[1:49:59] he said Lord these people they've turned
[1:50:02] against you they've they've even killed
[1:50:03] your prophets but God specifically tells
[1:50:06] him I have seven thousand who have not
[1:50:11] bowed their knees he didn't say oh
[1:50:13] there's a bunch of people if there's a
[1:50:15] handful of people he said I have seven
[1:50:16] thousand he is specific God knows every
[1:50:19] one of them let's go on even so then at
[1:50:24] this present time also there is a
[1:50:26] remnant according to the election of
[1:50:28] grace and if by grace then it is no more
[1:50:32] works otherwise grace is no more grace
[1:50:35] but if it be of works then it is no more
[1:50:37] grace otherwise work is no more work so
[1:50:43] again when you go to your job and you
[1:50:46] work you put the hours in you do what
[1:50:49] you're called to do you do what you
[1:50:50] signed to do and to hand you a paycheck
[1:50:54] you're thankful for it but you're did
[1:50:57] you did you did what you were supposed
[1:50:59] to but if the boss comes by and he says
[1:51:03] Peter you've done a great job you really
[1:51:06] I'm happy with you and everything you've
[1:51:08] done that here's a check for $5,000 on
[1:51:11] top of what you going now that's grace
[1:51:15] that's that's unmerited in a sense
[1:51:18] you're doing what they've told you to do
[1:51:20] you met your obligations and you know
[1:51:22] they they promised you a certain salary
[1:51:24] or Harvard whatever that is but then
[1:51:26] they give you something like that a
[1:51:27] bonus if we would call it that way
[1:51:28] that's grace but you would come and say
[1:51:32] Lord I've worked I've worked I've worked
[1:51:34] and I did all of this I deserve all of
[1:51:36] this no you made it into works then it
[1:51:39] is the grace of God and this is what
[1:51:41] Paul is talking about here that's gone
[1:51:44] what then Israel have not obtained that
[1:51:47] which he seeketh for but the election
[1:51:50] has obtained it and the rest
[1:51:51] were blinded it's God's working all this
[1:51:54] according as it is written God has given
[1:51:56] the spirit of slumber eyes that they
[1:51:59] should not see and ears that they should
[1:52:01] not hear and to this day God blinded his
[1:52:05] own children Israel the seed of Abraham
[1:52:09] the literal seed of Abraham so that you
[1:52:12] and I would have an opportunity but was
[1:52:16] it just something he says well I got no
[1:52:17] it was all part of God's plan it's all
[1:52:20] part of God's plan let's go on and David
[1:52:27] says let their table be made a snare in
[1:52:29] a trap and a stumbling block and a
[1:52:32] recompense unto them let their eyes be
[1:52:33] darkened that they may not see and bow
[1:52:35] down their their back alway now let's go
[1:52:40] on and I say then have they stumbled
[1:52:43] that they should fall god forbid but
[1:52:45] rather through their fall salvation has
[1:52:49] come unto the Gentiles for to provoke
[1:52:52] them to jealousy God chose to do it this
[1:52:54] way God called it this way God said this
[1:52:58] is how I'm going to lay this plan out
[1:53:00] now I'm even going to take a man named
[1:53:03] Saul whom the Christians of that time
[1:53:05] would have said no he would have not got
[1:53:07] voted on they would have said no we will
[1:53:09] not elect it but God said I'm gonna do
[1:53:11] this
[1:53:12] that's gone now if the fall of them be
[1:53:18] the riches of the world and the Minish
[1:53:20] them be the richest of the Gentiles how
[1:53:24] much more their fullness for I speak to
[1:53:27] you Gentiles here as much as I am
[1:53:29] apostasy of the Gentiles I magnify in my
[1:53:32] office he say no I mean showing you
[1:53:34] where I stand what I'm called to do
[1:53:37] let's go through that was gone if by any
[1:53:40] means I may provoke to emulation them
[1:53:43] which are my flesh and might save some
[1:53:45] of them for the casting away of them be
[1:53:48] the reconciling of the world what shall
[1:53:51] the receiving of them be but life from
[1:53:53] the dead God chose to do that and Paul
[1:53:56] recognizes this and he says God cast him
[1:53:59] away
[1:54:00] for the salvation of the Gentiles and
[1:54:03] you and I were included in that because
[1:54:06] God had it in the back of his mind let's
[1:54:11] continue on here for if the first-fruit
[1:54:13] be holy the lump is also holy and if the
[1:54:16] root be holy so are the branches and if
[1:54:19] some of the branches be broken off and
[1:54:21] thou being a wild olive tree were
[1:54:23] grafted in amongst them and with empar
[1:54:25] takes of the root and the fatness of the
[1:54:27] olive tree we receive over the same God
[1:54:30] and but they didn't know him as Jesus
[1:54:33] because to them is still to be revealed
[1:54:36] but it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:54:37] today and forever it's still God both
[1:54:42] not against the branches but if thou
[1:54:44] boast thou Bharath not the root but the
[1:54:46] root D thou will say then the the
[1:54:49] branches are broken off that I might be
[1:54:51] graft in Paul is telling us how we came
[1:54:53] in how God chose to do it here I'm going
[1:54:57] through this as quick as again well
[1:54:59] because of unbelief they were broken off
[1:55:01] and thou standest by faith be not
[1:55:04] high-minded but fear for if God spared
[1:55:06] not the natural branches take heed lest
[1:55:08] he also spare not thee behold therefore
[1:55:12] the goodness and the severity of God on
[1:55:14] them which fell severity but toward thee
[1:55:17] goodness if thou continue in his
[1:55:20] goodness otherwise thou shall be cut off
[1:55:23] Paul says don't glorify don't magnify
[1:55:26] yourself don't lift yourself up stay in
[1:55:30] that humbleness that sweetness and that
[1:55:32] grace of God because it's through His
[1:55:33] goodness and they also if they abide not
[1:55:38] still in unbelief shall be graffed in
[1:55:40] for God is able to graft them in again
[1:55:42] forth outward cut out of the olive tree
[1:55:45] which is wild by nature and we're graft
[1:55:47] contrary to nature into a good olive
[1:55:49] tree how much more shall these which
[1:55:51] shall which be the natural branches be
[1:55:54] graffed into their own olive tree now we
[1:55:57] are coming to that place to see that
[1:55:59] place when all of that is coming to his
[1:56:02] fulfillment now let's finish up here for
[1:56:06] I would not brethren that you should be
[1:56:08] ignorant of this mystery unless he
[1:56:09] should be wise in your own conceits
[1:56:11] that blindness in the part has happened
[1:56:14] to Israel until the fullness of the
[1:56:16] Gentiles be come in and I'm glad that
[1:56:19] God did it this way because if it had
[1:56:22] been my choice being a human I would
[1:56:24] have said Lord they've turned their back
[1:56:27] on you having nothing to do with him but
[1:56:31] God allowed them to turn their back on
[1:56:33] him so that you and I would have this
[1:56:36] opportunity had God chosen to take the
[1:56:40] children the the first generation home
[1:56:42] the first church age you and I would
[1:56:44] have never had the opportunity and if
[1:56:46] the Ephesian Church come to a full
[1:56:48] perfection gone into rapture you and I
[1:56:50] would have never been here but God has a
[1:56:52] reason and a way to do the things he did
[1:56:54] he does that's gone and so shall all
[1:57:00] Israel be saved as it is written there
[1:57:02] shall come out of Zion the deliverer and
[1:57:04] shall turn away the ungodliness from
[1:57:06] Jacob for this is my covenant unto them
[1:57:09] when I shall take away their sins there
[1:57:13] comes to the that day when they say
[1:57:15] where did you receive those scars and he
[1:57:20] says in the house of my friends he still
[1:57:23] called him friends and concerning the
[1:57:25] gospel they are enemies for your sakes
[1:57:26] but as touching the election they are
[1:57:29] beloved for the father's sakes for the
[1:57:32] gifts and callings of God or without
[1:57:34] repentance you didn't earn him you
[1:57:37] didn't deserve him God gave them to you
[1:57:39] for as Ian tine pass have not believed
[1:57:42] God you have now obtained mercy through
[1:57:44] their unbelief even so have these also
[1:57:47] now not believe that through your mercy
[1:57:51] they cell ups also obtain mercy it gets
[1:57:55] reversed right back I'm glad that God is
[1:57:59] merciful to me and how am I going to
[1:58:01] express that by being merciful to others
[1:58:04] by saying God as you had mercy in me as
[1:58:07] you love me as you washed me as you do
[1:58:10] it unto them also give unto them also
[1:58:14] for God hath concluded all the depth of
[1:58:17] the riches both of the wisdom and
[1:58:19] knowledge of God how unsearchable are
[1:58:21] his judgments and his ways past fine
[1:58:24] get out for who have known the might of
[1:58:26] the Lord or who has been his counselor
[1:58:28] Paul says look at this you and I would
[1:58:31] have never done it this way you and I
[1:58:33] wouldn't have never planned it this way
[1:58:34] but God did so and he didn't ask your
[1:58:37] opinion of it either do you think I
[1:58:39] should do he chose to do it this way and
[1:58:41] I love him for his choosing in his
[1:58:44] election and the way he does things
[1:58:46] because he knows what's best for us or
[1:58:49] who have first given to him and it shall
[1:58:52] be recompensed unto him again for of him
[1:58:55] and through him and to him are all
[1:58:57] things to whom be glory forever amen you
[1:59:04] say amen to that
[1:59:05] amen to God be all the glory to God be
[1:59:09] all the praise to God be may he be
[1:59:12] exalted in all of this not ourselves and
[1:59:15] this is where I was saying let's be
[1:59:17] careful that we worship Him and love him
[1:59:19] and praise him and don't walk around
[1:59:21] saying I'm it and you're not because you
[1:59:25] don't know where they are
[1:59:25] in fact let your life what does the
[1:59:27] scripture tell us you're a light to this
[1:59:29] world you're the salt of the earth that
[1:59:32] they might want what you have they might
[1:59:34] desire and if there is that
[1:59:36] representation of God they would see it
[1:59:38] in you and say that is remember that
[1:59:40] little eagle brother Branham talks and
[1:59:42] that was was taken by the farmer and put
[1:59:44] in the nest of the with the chickens
[1:59:46] there but he was an eagle he didn't know
[1:59:49] that he was born under and under that
[1:59:52] mother hen he thought he was part of
[1:59:55] that chicken group but there was a
[1:59:57] mother Eagle saying hey I'm missing one
[1:59:59] of mine and she begins to search for him
[2:00:02] she begins to go out and look for him
[2:00:04] and and he's going you know I'm I was
[2:00:06] born here I was raised here this is what
[2:00:09] we do but I just don't fit with them I'm
[2:00:12] not like them I look different than them
[2:00:14] I act different than him sometimes they
[2:00:17] do this and I don't want to do that
[2:00:19] sometimes I do it and I go and ask God
[2:00:22] for forgiveness cuz that's not my desire
[2:00:24] but he didn't know who he was yet but
[2:00:28] then she comes flying by and she says
[2:00:30] there's that one that's missing and he
[2:00:33] hears that Eagle cry he hears that
[2:00:35] screaming hisses hey
[2:00:37] there's something about in that
[2:00:39] responding back to that that is
[2:00:42] something and he's looking at me said
[2:00:45] but hey I've never seen any of these
[2:00:47] chickens fly never seen them go up into
[2:00:49] the heavens how do I do that
[2:00:50] and mother begins to tell him God begins
[2:00:53] to speak back to you and say here some
[2:00:57] of this some of that get into this book
[2:00:59] and begin to read begin to listen begin
[2:01:02] to hear get on your knees and ask God to
[2:01:04] unveil this thing and he will show you
[2:01:06] he'll say set your wings he go and fly
[2:01:09] and what was it he was always an eagle
[2:01:13] but he there was a time for that to come
[2:01:16] but you know brother Branham never has
[2:01:19] turns around and says when he flew away
[2:01:21] he looked at chickens and said I hate
[2:01:23] you I think nothing of you he said I'm
[2:01:25] an eagle I belong over here by the grace
[2:01:27] of God and you know my heart's desire is
[2:01:31] Lord that they would have that same
[2:01:33] opportunity that I have that you've
[2:01:36] given to me to know you and your
[2:01:37] fullness to know you and your love to
[2:01:40] experience you to have a change in their
[2:01:44] lives as I've had because it's Christ in
[2:01:49] us and he said oh that he said o Israel
[2:01:52] o Israel how oft as a mother would hen
[2:01:55] would spread your wings how often I want
[2:01:57] to do that that same desire when you see
[2:02:00] your neighbor going the opposite way you
[2:02:03] say God have mercy on them the same way
[2:02:05] you've had whereas if the musicians
[2:02:07] would come for it I trusted that the
[2:02:10] thought came across the way it was in my
[2:02:13] heart that it is a work of God it is a
[2:02:17] choice of God it's a call it's a
[2:02:21] representation in your life but be
[2:02:23] grateful for it be loving for it I have
[2:02:27] the Spirit of Christ in you because it
[2:02:29] is the Spirit of Christ the life of
[2:02:31] Christ and let that express the love and
[2:02:33] the mercy back to others around you to
[2:02:37] your brother to your sister to your
[2:02:38] mother to your father to your child to
[2:02:42] your neighbor to whoever it might be let
[2:02:44] Christ let the light of God reach out to
[2:02:48] wherever there is
[2:02:49] I am redeemed I am redeemed bought with
[2:02:54] a price
[2:02:55] redeem means you were there at one time
[2:03:00] and maybe you got traded maybe you got
[2:03:03] sold off maybe you fell into something
[2:03:04] but the Redeemer came I've come back to
[2:03:07] seek just to to save that which was lost
[2:03:11] and I am reading Oh
[2:03:18] [Music]
[2:03:19] ah
[2:03:21] [Music]
[2:03:27] have changed my
[2:03:33] [Music]
[2:04:10] ha
[2:04:17] [Music]
[2:04:29] ah
[2:04:30] [Music]
[2:04:38] lorded cost you everything to redeem to
[2:04:42] bring back out of the pawn shop out of
[2:04:47] the clutch of Satan's hands you went
[2:04:50] down Lord as you you said I lay my life
[2:04:53] down when you you were there Gethsemane
[2:04:56] and the decision had to be made the
[2:04:59] choice had to be made or to redeem that
[2:05:03] which was lost
[2:05:04] to redeem which which back in the
[2:05:06] beginning when when Adam willingly
[2:05:08] stepped out with Eve Lord knowing that
[2:05:10] they would lose that that inheritance or
[2:05:13] the rights there to eat and Lord but in
[2:05:18] this there was a plan in this there was
[2:05:20] a something that you had seen and you
[2:05:22] Fortin you and you were going to do Lord
[2:05:25] but it costs you everything Lord it cost
[2:05:29] you your life and cost you your
[2:05:31] reputation it costs you the splendor of
[2:05:34] heaven your throne there had cost you
[2:05:35] everything you didn't even have a place
[2:05:38] to lay your head a house to sleep in
[2:05:40] Lord you didn't have a place to really
[2:05:42] call your own home you didn't have your
[2:05:45] own church to stand there and preach on
[2:05:47] every Sunday with a congregation you you
[2:05:49] went from place to place it cost you
[2:05:53] everything you are called Beelzebub your
[2:05:56] own your own Lord received you not they
[2:05:59] turn your back on you Lord but it was
[2:06:01] all part of your plan Lord but as a man
[2:06:04] Lord being robed in flesh you felt the
[2:06:06] heard of it you felt the anguish you
[2:06:08] felt the rejection Lord so she would
[2:06:12] understand that you would know but that
[2:06:16] day came and Gethsemane and they said
[2:06:18] you said father
[2:06:20] can we redeem them a different way can
[2:06:23] we get back to eat in a different way
[2:06:25] but then you said no father whatever
[2:06:28] your will is because it would take like
[2:06:31] in the very beginning the blood of an
[2:06:33] innocent one Lord to pay the price and
[2:06:36] you willingly win and on that day Lord
[2:06:41] when you gave up the girls and in it you
[2:06:43] travel down into the depth of hell and
[2:06:45] you went down there and you preached to
[2:06:47] those souls in prison Lord and you went
[2:06:50] there too to those Lord that had died
[2:06:52] before Lord those Saints and you opened
[2:06:55] the door and you called them out Lord
[2:06:57] and you began to tell you begin to show
[2:06:59] all the reason and the plan that you had
[2:07:01] and what you intended to do Lord and on
[2:07:05] the third day you rose again and you
[2:07:08] gravid your disciples together and you
[2:07:10] told them go up go up into that upper
[2:07:13] room and wait because this spirit that's
[2:07:16] in me will be in you and therefore you
[2:07:19] can go out and preach and teach and show
[2:07:21] what this is what God has done what God
[2:07:25] is doing Lord we thank you for it Lord
[2:07:28] we thank you that you were willing to do
[2:07:30] that Lord may our hearts and our
[2:07:34] attitude in our life or our whole being
[2:07:37] just show the appreciation and the love
[2:07:39] or what you've done for us or that
[2:07:43] you're redeemed us and you care for us
[2:07:46] thank you in Jesus Christ

[2:09:47] [Music]
[2:10:01] we've been made more than conquerors
[2:10:07] we've been made more than
[2:10:15] overcome
[2:10:17] [Music]
[2:10:23] Oh
[2:10:26] Oh
[2:10:30] [Music]
[2:10:37] more than

[2:10:47] we
[2:10:50] [Applause]
[2:10:54] [Music]
[2:10:59] [Applause]
[2:11:01] big
[2:11:04] [Music]
[2:11:08] I
[2:11:11] [Music]
[2:11:15] big
[2:11:18] [Music]
[2:11:28] big heart
[2:11:37] [Music]
[2:11:46] me
[2:11:49] [Music]
[2:11:55] [Music]
[2:12:01] ah
[2:12:04] [Music]
[2:12:16] [Music]
[2:12:29] I
[2:12:32] [Music]
[2:12:49] maybe life is worth it it's it's
[2:12:53] sometimes things get hard and sometimes
[2:12:55] secrets and contrary to what we thought
[2:12:58] they should but because he lives and
[2:13:01] because he's he overcome then God bless
[2:13:08] each one of you tonight trusting that
[2:13:12] this it was said and delivered would be
[2:13:16] the Lord would unveil it to you just
[2:13:18] what my heart was what my intention was
[2:13:21] it's not by chance it's not by accident
[2:13:24] by managers it's what God has chosen to
[2:13:28] do and I want to walk in his choosing I
[2:13:32] want to walk in his favor because when
[2:13:35] you go against it it's a hard life then
[2:13:37] you're like the prodigal son when you
[2:13:39] finally find yourself down there at the
[2:13:41] bottom eating with the pigs saying how
[2:13:44] did I get here but it was still a son
[2:13:47] and fear in that place today just say I
[2:13:49] want to go back to the house of my
[2:13:50] father because in my father's house
[2:13:53] there's food to eat there's a place to
[2:13:56] sleep there's rest and if that desire is
[2:13:59] to go back to the house of the father's
[2:14:01] because the father is drawing you Lord
[2:14:04] there might be one right now may be
[2:14:06] sitting there wherever they're at their
[2:14:08] hope may be outside of it alone maybe in
[2:14:12] a you know in a hard place right now
[2:14:14] they'd be locked up in a prison cell in
[2:14:17] a hospital so bad mental ward even
[2:14:22] let them come to themselves or maybe
[2:14:23] they aren't coming to themselves and may
[2:14:26] they turn their heart back to your
[2:14:28] father say father will you accept me
[2:14:31] Lord in you and no wise would ever turn
[2:14:34] one of your own you said my sheep know
[2:14:36] my voice and another they will not
[2:14:39] follow Lord sometimes we get a confused
[2:14:43] maybe we get we get off the path Lord
[2:14:45] but we are your shoes there might be
[2:14:48] what needed that today and they turned
[2:14:52] our heart back to Jesus Christ Jesus has
[2:14:57] the table spread where the saints of God
[2:15:01] Jesus has
[2:15:04] we're the Saints of gonna face
