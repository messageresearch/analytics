[34:50] [Music]
[34:57] dog owners
[35:01] [Music]
[35:08] escribe I true
[35:11] to
[35:19] [Music]
[35:32] come
[35:33] [Music]
[35:33] [Applause]
[35:36] [Music]
[35:44] Oh
[35:48] [Applause]
[35:50] [Music]
[36:26] Oh
[36:54] would you play that just as I am
[36:57] it was so fitting to the song that you
[36:59] girl thing and then to that and it fits
[37:03] just right so I appreciate the goodness
[37:06] of the Lord today how he he comforts you
[37:10] how he strengthens you how he he comes
[37:13] to where you're at you might be going
[37:16] through a hard time and hard struggling
[37:19] but he'll take you just as you are and
[37:22] sometimes when you realize you come to
[37:26] that realization that there's nothing
[37:28] you can do with
[37:29] in it it's the place that me realize
[37:32] that you can let him have preeminence
[37:37] the last song that I heard before I came
[37:40] to service was the love of God and I
[37:43] just had just blessed my heart to see
[37:45] that how things go together in the
[37:47] tortoise beings we do have a couple of
[37:54] prayer requests that we were made aware
[37:57] of so brother had to go I sent me a text
[38:02] today and said he'd be on his way home
[38:04] tomorrow driving back in from work so
[38:07] let's me remember brother had as he's
[38:09] driving in and also my daughter Naomi
[38:14] she yesterday was her last day of work
[38:18] at Pima College as they've closed
[38:20] everything down except for management
[38:23] but they found out that one of their
[38:25] co-workers named Sandra who worked in
[38:28] the cafeteria she's been gone for
[38:30] several weeks if she had gotten sick and
[38:33] all the symptoms that she has looks like
[38:36] the corona virus so some of those
[38:39] workers may have been exposed to that oh
[38:43] we have a mighty God they can take it
[38:47] and do anything that is it would be
[38:49] harmful to us so we don't we don't let
[38:53] that take us and make us full of fear or
[38:56] anything like that
[38:58] if you have a need there wherever your
[39:01] abdomen should be nice to see everybody
[39:04] back here in service but the Lord
[39:07] willing that won't be too far down the
[39:09] road but wherever we are he's the same
[39:11] yesterday today and forever so if you'll
[39:15] raise your hand up if you have a need
[39:16] and just say Lord I accept I believe I'm
[39:20] coming just as I am I'm not I'm not
[39:24] gonna present myself in a way Lord that
[39:26] you would know better but Lord that
[39:27] you've said I could come as I am and you
[39:29] would accept me so let's pray Lord it's
[39:33] just so fitting more to hear those two
[39:35] songs tied in together
[39:37] [Music]
[39:38] we can't even walk without you holding
[39:41] our hands we think we're strong we think
[39:43] we're we're able to Lord and then we're
[39:45] faced with something Lord we don't even
[39:47] know what to do or where to turn but if
[39:50] we'll commit ourselves to you and we
[39:52] will approach you as you said we could
[39:54] more through the shed blood and enter
[39:57] into that holy of holies Lord and let
[40:00] you minister to us today Lord in all the
[40:03] knees Lord you know each one where
[40:06] they're at right now and what that need
[40:07] is Lord father would you go and minister
[40:11] would you would you draw an eye to them
[40:13] Lord
[40:14] for this lady Lord that worked there
[40:16] with my daughter Lord possibly had the
[40:19] coronavirus Lord and those that could be
[40:22] affected around her Lord would you go
[40:24] through Lord and touch each one of them
[40:26] Gordon not only them but wherever Lord
[40:29] in this whole world wherever your
[40:32] children are Lord but to be with each
[40:34] one or do we give you honor well give
[40:37] you glory and we'll give you Prince and
[40:39] Jesus Christ name Amen
[40:42] [Music]
[40:44] also a couple of testimonies that were
[40:48] shared and a thank-you and we prayed for
[40:54] Stephen and Nina and they left yesterday
[40:57] morning go back up to Kansas and they
[41:00] arrived home safely
[41:01] appreciate about 16 hours of driving and
[41:04] all is well
[41:06] and my niece Eunice she sent in a praise
[41:11] her and the girls were in the backyard
[41:13] and they were swinging some golf clubs
[41:15] and Avis swung one or one of the girls
[41:19] swung then as she saw that Avis suddenly
[41:23] held her mouth and went down and looked
[41:24] like she had been hit in the face with a
[41:26] golf club so Eunice went over quickly
[41:29] thinking she'd find a busted lips and
[41:31] broken teeth but there was just a slight
[41:34] mark just a small grace Fork what could
[41:37] have been so she just wanted to thank
[41:39] the Lord also I've heard several
[41:43] testimonies now from the service that
[41:45] when brother Joe Adams was here and he
[41:49] ministered in prayer after the services
[41:51] I've heard some testimonies of the the
[41:54] power of God coming in and meeting some
[41:56] needs and I heard one today they sent it
[42:00] to me to forward it to brother Joe just
[42:03] thanking him and I did that and someone
[42:07] he had prayed for because they had been
[42:08] having just some very dark thoughts and
[42:13] suicidal tendencies and and just
[42:16] depression they said from that day the
[42:19] prayer not a single one again so we
[42:22] praise God for that and I know there
[42:24] were others that the Lord touched in a
[42:26] week we all thank the Lord that he's the
[42:28] same yesterday today and forever so amen
[42:33] do you believe that so appreciate that
[42:36] thank you musicians I just appreciated
[42:40] that just as I am Lord you'll take meal
[42:44] accept meal but you won't leave me as I
[42:47] am I won't go back out torn and broken
[42:51] and downhearted but will be encouraged
[42:55] so thank the Lord for those good things
[42:58] he does for us so this evening we'd like
[43:02] to maybe continue a little bit on what
[43:05] we ministered last Wednesday just taking
[43:08] God at His Word where brother Branham
[43:12] said God's Word defeats Satan every time
[43:15] without fail so we were looking at some
[43:19] of those things and another testimony to
[43:23] and was called brother Matt because he
[43:27] had sent me
[43:28] me and my wife a little devotional book
[43:30] that he said he just felt the Lord
[43:33] impressed one morning send this to
[43:35] brother Aaron sister Rachel so the very
[43:38] next day we received it in the mail
[43:39] because he did exactly what he felt to
[43:41] do and when Nina and Steven got ready to
[43:45] leave and with everything that's going
[43:49] on well the thoughts well are we gonna
[43:50] see them again it's something gonna
[43:53] happen and that was so I was in the in
[43:56] there and my office is also in the
[43:58] bedroom and you know was thing and momma
[44:00] got down to pray before she went to bed
[44:02] and I heard her crying and I said I
[44:05] think I know what this is just thought
[44:07] of possibly that we might not see them
[44:10] again and so when she finished praying I
[44:14] turned to her and I looked and I said
[44:16] was was that part of it and she said yes
[44:19] it was but just a lot of troubling times
[44:22] but she said yep give me that book that
[44:25] brother man said let me let me read to
[44:27] you or let us read what what today's
[44:29] devotional is and there was a I don't
[44:33] know if he'd call it a poem but a five
[44:35] stands a portion that was written there
[44:37] and it talked about the dark cloud in
[44:40] your life and and and the things that
[44:44] you would look at it as a dark cloud but
[44:47] it was a promise of God
[44:49] behind that dark cloud and sometimes you
[44:52] look at that and as as we read through
[44:54] it every one of those answered a
[44:56] question that she had in her heart and
[44:59] III just appreciate the brother Matt
[45:02] followed the leadership with the Lord
[45:03] and it was timely for us so it's the
[45:07] goodness of the Lord he does not leave
[45:09] his sheep alone he stays with them
[45:12] because they're his so let's so let's
[45:15] let's read the first scripture here in
[45:18] second samuel chapter seven verse 22 and
[45:24] i had just written this scripture down a
[45:27] while back and i went back to look at it
[45:29] i'd like to just start here and it says
[45:33] wherefore thou art great o lord god for
[45:36] there is none like thee neither is there
[45:40] any god beside thee according to all
[45:42] that we have heard with our ears so
[45:46] let's just bow our heads lord we thank
[45:48] you that it's not only that we've heard
[45:51] with our ears but we have been
[45:53] privileged to experience and to get to
[45:56] know you personally lord and there is
[45:59] none like You Lord no one else could
[46:03] know about us so intently so deeply so
[46:06] personally like you Lord and therefore
[46:08] be able to minister to us that way and
[46:10] we thank you lord now speak to us Lord
[46:13] let our hearts and our ears be open Lord
[46:16] let us just receive that which we have
[46:19] need of as you know best we ask in Jesus
[46:21] Christ's name Amen amen
[46:25] so again therefore thou art great o Lord
[46:29] our God for there is none like thee
[46:33] neither is there any God besides thee
[46:36] according to all that we have heard with
[46:39] our ears and this with the children of
[46:42] Israel as they were as a Word of God in
[46:45] the the testimonies had been rehearsed
[46:46] to them and reminded and this was their
[46:49] their exclamation or their response
[46:52] there is none like the O Lord so and
[46:55] that's our same the same reaction that
[46:59] we have Lord there is
[47:02] unlike you amen and if we'll go to that
[47:07] first quote there brother Jeremy from
[47:12] the beginning it wasn't so and I had had
[47:17] heard a portion thing and it just this
[47:21] caught my attention so I looked it up
[47:23] and in brother Brahma had been to India
[47:26] and they had all the fences made of
[47:30] stone and all the walls so he describes
[47:34] that but picking it up from here if the
[47:38] little birds had been in there and he's
[47:39] speaking of those stone walls and the
[47:41] homes they'd been killed if the cattle
[47:44] had been standing under these fences
[47:46] that have gotten killed but the holy
[47:48] spirit that worn two cattle the birds to
[47:50] go into the ark to escape the judgment
[47:53] of God the same Holy Spirit drove them
[47:57] cattle those Lyn he send the Holy Ghost
[47:59] in this last days just before the great
[48:02] judgments coming to to send you into
[48:05] Christ to safety the only place that you
[48:08] could be redeemed and resurrected the
[48:11] only place there is salvation in Christ
[48:13] and the Holy Spirit is here tonight
[48:16] trying to bring you and woo you out from
[48:19] the things of the world into himself and
[48:22] you can look at that of the world the
[48:25] worldly thinks or the situations that
[48:27] are around us but he'll draw you to
[48:30] himself he's the same yesterday today
[48:33] and forever and then I had read read
[48:37] another portion and blind bartimaeus and
[48:43] may use this the whole quote here and
[48:45] then just portions of the other court
[48:47] quote here and he says now I if I went
[48:50] out there in the ocean and picked up a
[48:52] spoonful of water now like all the ocean
[48:55] that that's what was in Jesus the
[48:58] fullness of God but what's in me and you
[49:00] is just little spoonfuls he said but if
[49:03] he took that spoonful of water to the
[49:06] laboratory and tested it the same
[49:08] chemicals that were in the spoonful
[49:09] would be what was in the ocean that's
[49:12] right the same kind of chemicals is that
[49:15] right
[49:15] the same Holy Ghost then amen and with
[49:19] your spoonful and my spoonful and their
[49:22] spoonful and all of it put together we
[49:25] can do things for God if we'll just let
[49:28] it flow together it'll bring the
[49:30] presence of God well you said he say
[49:34] well I'm just a little part what good in
[49:37] mind he says if we all get together then
[49:40] again from be not afraid and just the
[49:44] last part the response to what he was
[49:47] talking again the same thing of that
[49:48] spoonful of water but he says but when
[49:51] God on the day of Pentecost when he come
[49:53] down like a rushing wind did you see he
[49:56] was a pillar of fire but you notice he
[49:59] separated himself from the pillar of
[50:01] fire divided himself among his people
[50:04] and cloven tongues of fire set upon each
[50:07] of them God separating himself to his
[50:10] church no wonder he spoke wherever two
[50:13] or three are gathered in my name all be
[50:16] in their midst so that same he's again
[50:19] he's taking that same quality oh that's
[50:23] in the ocean he ties it to a spoonful or
[50:25] the same quality all that God was he
[50:28] poured into Christ and a greater than
[50:31] Solomon is here well then when we think
[50:36] of the Spirit of Christ that we have
[50:38] enough see it's just a spoonful of what
[50:42] was in him see he had all of it in him
[50:45] and that that God was he poured into
[50:48] Christ all that Christ to us he poured
[50:51] into the church so if you have God in
[50:54] you you have everything you have need of
[50:57] and in it it's a it's Christ in you the
[51:01] hope of glory I can't even walk without
[51:04] you holding my hand
[51:06] you realize he becomes our everything
[51:08] and it's it's it's that which all
[51:11] together brother Branham said making
[51:14] that deck of fire and I have heard but
[51:18] now I see the last quote here one day
[51:22] when the lepers were laying all over the
[51:24] country
[51:25] he used his power and put a curse on a
[51:27] tree and began to wither
[51:29] when there was people laying everywhere
[51:31] needing that healing power but you see
[51:33] he wanted to show he's got over
[51:36] everything whether it's small whether
[51:39] it's big whatever it is he's still God
[51:42] over all things all the creation so we
[51:46] love him because that he gives us to
[51:48] know if he's interested to speak the
[51:51] Word of Life into a little insignificant
[51:53] fish laying there dead on the water for
[51:56] a half an hour he's speaking of that
[51:59] when he called gave that little fish
[52:00] back his life he can certainly someday
[52:03] speak life into his children no matter
[52:06] if your body be no more than a spoonful
[52:09] of dust he'll speak and we'll answer him
[52:11] someday he's God who is interested in
[52:14] everything all that we do all that we
[52:17] say everything he's interested and that
[52:21] was reading that myself I said thank you
[52:23] Lord there's not a situation there's not
[52:26] anything going on right now that you're
[52:28] not aware of you're not paying attention
[52:30] to your thing so we appreciate him being
[52:33] that way so as we go into some
[52:35] scriptures here Psalms 119 101 oh five
[52:41] and you read the Book of Psalms and some
[52:45] of the most to me some of those
[52:47] inspiring some of those times that I've
[52:49] gone in and read something from Psalms
[52:51] I'm just maybe needing to hear from the
[52:54] Lord and I just said I'm gonna open the
[52:56] Book of Psalms and I'm gonna begin to
[52:57] read and God will always have something
[53:00] just to encourage just to say hey I'm
[53:03] aware I I know what's going on and and
[53:06] what I like about it too is David was a
[53:08] man just like me he had problems he had
[53:11] issues he had things but God still went
[53:16] ministered to him talk with him walk
[53:19] with him he called him a man after my
[53:21] own heart
[53:22] so David says this in Psalms 119 I have
[53:25] not departed from thy judgments
[53:28] I'm not gotten so caught up on
[53:31] everything that's going around that I've
[53:33] forgotten what you said Lord for thou
[53:37] hast taught me and he said how sweet are
[53:39] they words unto my taste
[53:42] yayyyy sweeter
[53:43] the honey to my mouth we could eat a
[53:46] good meal but I'm gonna need another one
[53:49] after a while but if he have you have
[53:52] the words of life in you you have
[53:54] eternal life in you he says through thy
[53:59] precepts I get understanding
[54:01] therefore I hate every false way through
[54:05] your word david says sooth I presume you
[54:10] know what is true he said though
[54:13] therefore everything even how I feel
[54:15] even how I think even my emotions can be
[54:18] false but God's Word is true he said
[54:21] that's where I hate every false way and
[54:24] sometimes we get frustrated with
[54:25] ourselves we get oh why am I like that
[54:28] but take God at His Word and apply to
[54:32] every situation he says then he says it
[54:34] thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a
[54:38] light unto my path in a situation right
[54:41] now and you every time you open the news
[54:45] or talk to somebody it seems like every
[54:48] conversation even today and in working
[54:50] in some of the houses listening the
[54:53] conversations and someone would come up
[54:54] and say so what do you think about the
[54:56] situation today and that's got
[54:58] everybody's concern you know you turn on
[55:01] the news everybody's talking about
[55:03] what's happening today and both sides of
[55:06] it and you look at what politics is
[55:09] doing what politicians are doing and
[55:12] each one is trying to use the situation
[55:14] for their good to enhance their standing
[55:17] you know if you elect me I'll do this
[55:20] and you know like if they have any
[55:23] control of it through their through
[55:25] their politics and that's what
[55:27] everybody's doing some are saying doing
[55:30] this and I was thinking about it and
[55:31] they were saying wash your hands and and
[55:34] we should do that I'm not saying to be
[55:37] foolish and not go out and I'll just do
[55:39] anything anyway
[55:40] we should be we should do those things
[55:42] that the the medical field is doing
[55:45] their best as they can but they were
[55:48] talking wash your hands do this and as I
[55:49] was sitting there studying and it's to
[55:52] wash your hands and I started thinking
[55:54] washing me oh Lord
[55:57] cleanse me Lord wash me not only from
[56:00] those things we see the effects of a
[56:03] corona but wash me from every spirit
[56:05] wash me and cleanse me from anything
[56:07] that the after effects or the the what
[56:11] is going to show is going to show the
[56:13] the sickness of it down the road the
[56:15] evil of it cleanse me even of the things
[56:17] that I don't see
[56:19] he says thy word is a lamp unto my feet
[56:22] and a light unto my path because I must
[56:26] continue on the journey and he said I'll
[56:28] take your word and now we say how could
[56:33] this how could these things happen and
[56:35] come upon a child of God how Lord you
[56:38] know where are you in this and as I was
[56:41] thinking that just just kind of going
[56:43] over some of these things and I thought
[56:44] Lord what about Jobe so I went over to
[56:49] job chapter one and I started reading
[56:51] through there and and when God says have
[56:57] you considered my servant job you know
[57:01] God God had full confidence in job he
[57:07] got new jobs end from the beginning
[57:11] but joke didn't know you know and
[57:15] neither did his friends but God did so
[57:16] listen let's look at chapter 1 will pick
[57:18] up verses 6 through 12 here now there
[57:25] was a day when the sons of God came to
[57:27] present themselves before the Lord and
[57:29] Satan came also among them and the Lord
[57:34] said unto Satan whence cometh thou and
[57:36] Satan answered oh I've been going from
[57:39] to and fro on this earth he said walking
[57:42] up and down all over it and the Lord
[57:45] said I say have you considered my
[57:47] servant job there is none like him in
[57:50] the earth a perfect and an upright man
[57:55] that was the god speaking of job now you
[57:59] and I being around Joe maybe I don't
[58:02] know that we would have described him
[58:03] maybe job's wife wouldn't have described
[58:05] him that way maybe his children would
[58:07] have described that way but God said he
[58:11] is a perfect and upright man one that
[58:13] feareth God and his choose evil he turns
[58:16] his back he does he does not want to
[58:19] participate in evil let's continue on
[58:24] there then Satan answered Lord he said
[58:27] does choke fear thee for not I mean
[58:29] there's a reason why he's that way has
[58:31] not thou made a hedge about him and
[58:33] about his house and I'm glad God does
[58:36] I'm glad as as brother Matt talked about
[58:39] that fire about us and about all that he
[58:42] has on every side so he promises to you
[58:45] and your children in your household
[58:47] Satan is just quoting what God has done
[58:50] for his children he says thou has
[58:53] blessed the work of his hands and his
[58:55] substance is increased in the land let's
[59:01] continue on there but put forth thine
[59:04] hand now and touch all that he hath and
[59:07] he will curse thee to thy faith same
[59:10] goes just make it hard on him
[59:12] and he's going to be like the rest of
[59:15] the people they're gonna turn on saying
[59:17] where is God in all this what have I
[59:20] done wrong what did I do and the Lord
[59:23] said unto Satan behold all that he hath
[59:26] is in thy power only upon himself put
[59:29] not forth thine hand so Satan went forth
[59:32] from the presence of the Lord and it
[59:34] just wanted to read that because Satan
[59:36] had to get permission from God he walked
[59:41] around and I know he saw Jobe he knew
[59:43] where Jobe lives he didn't have to ask
[59:46] God okay where's this Jobe guy tell me
[59:49] where was that so I can go after him he
[59:50] knew exactly where to go back to but he
[59:52] had seen the hedge around him he had
[59:54] seen all of that he says I can't get to
[59:56] him God's got him protected God said go
[1:00:00] so again in job chapter 2 verses 6 & 7
[1:00:04] we know the story there of job well how
[1:00:08] well he was having one of the messengers
[1:00:10] telling him what had just happened
[1:00:12] another messenger comes and we know job
[1:00:16] says naked I was born naked I shall
[1:00:19] return blessed be the name
[1:00:22] the Lord so just to save some time we'll
[1:00:25] jump to job chapter two six and seven
[1:00:28] and Satan goes back up to to speak to
[1:00:34] the Lord about Joe because the Satan
[1:00:36] says well did Joe back here like you
[1:00:39] said job chapter 2 verses 6 & 7 but put
[1:00:44] forth thine hand now and touch his bone
[1:00:48] and his flesh and he will curse thee to
[1:00:50] thy face Satan tells him now touch him
[1:00:53] you you've let me touch everything else
[1:00:55] let me go touch him and the Lord again
[1:00:57] said unto Satan behold he is in thine
[1:00:59] hand but save his life again God puts
[1:01:03] the limits God says you can but you're
[1:01:06] not going to do this and he has not
[1:01:09] changed he's the same yesterday but will
[1:01:13] we go through hard times will we go
[1:01:15] through troubles and trials yes we do
[1:01:16] but God has already seen you victorious
[1:01:20] God has already seen you as an overcomer
[1:01:24] because to John in the book of
[1:01:27] Revelation he says now look let's
[1:01:29] preview let's look at this bride that is
[1:01:32] adorned for him and brother Branham
[1:01:34] calls that that many many membered bride
[1:01:36] and that's meeting you just to show you
[1:01:40] there that he's a great God as Samuel
[1:01:43] said and David says thy word is a lamp
[1:01:46] but Satan can still come and tempt us in
[1:01:49] this flesh but God never turns his back
[1:01:53] then Psalms 103 verses 1 through 5 David
[1:02:01] here and he's and David is speaking out
[1:02:04] and and as they as a man of God as a man
[1:02:08] called of God and he's writing these
[1:02:11] things having no idea that how many
[1:02:14] years down the road you and I would be
[1:02:16] sharing these would be reading these
[1:02:18] would still be receiving the blessing
[1:02:20] out of it because God's Word is the same
[1:02:22] yesterday today and forever because
[1:02:24] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:02:26] and for him bless the Lord O my soul and
[1:02:29] all that is within me bless His Holy
[1:02:33] Name in
[1:02:34] parentheses when everything's going okay
[1:02:37] no it says bless the Lord O my soul and
[1:02:42] all that is within me bless His Holy
[1:02:45] Name
[1:02:47] bless the Lord O my soul and forget not
[1:02:50] all his benefits who forgiveth all thine
[1:02:55] iniquities who healeth all thy diseases
[1:02:59] who redeemeth thy life from destruction
[1:03:02] who crowns thee with loving-kindness and
[1:03:05] tender mercies who satisfies thy mouth
[1:03:09] with good things so that thy youth is
[1:03:12] renewed like an eagle's these are
[1:03:16] David's words but not David's words they
[1:03:20] were inspired by God for David append
[1:03:23] them for David to sing them for David to
[1:03:25] say them and to record them so that you
[1:03:27] and I could say the same thing I will
[1:03:30] bless thee O Lord with these lips with
[1:03:34] my actions with everything I say and do
[1:03:37] I will bless thee O Lord I will give you
[1:03:39] praise I will give you honor it says and
[1:03:42] with all that is within me I'll bless
[1:03:45] His Holy Name
[1:03:46] and I'll not forgive his benefits
[1:03:49] because it because of his benefits I am
[1:03:52] Who I am you know it's not one of those
[1:03:54] when last what was that the day that we
[1:03:58] had the lunch here at the church and
[1:04:00] Elizabeth drover his story in the man
[1:04:01] hit her car well - they called her and
[1:04:05] they offered a settlement for the
[1:04:07] vehicle and and for the bruising of the
[1:04:10] arm and they told her it's all it's
[1:04:13] worth is this and this that's all the
[1:04:15] benefits you have and that was to his
[1:04:17] insurance and we know that the insurance
[1:04:19] eight companies there wanna good get as
[1:04:22] low and payout as little as possible
[1:04:24] it's how they work but David says here
[1:04:27] forget not all his benefits their
[1:04:30] eternal benefits their unlimited
[1:04:33] benefits you cannot the more you draw
[1:04:36] from him the more you can receive it's
[1:04:38] not it's not like that word brother
[1:04:40] Branham talked about that little mouse
[1:04:42] and the grains in the Garner's of the
[1:04:44] grains or the little fish in the ocean
[1:04:46] no part
[1:04:47] at all he says who forgiveth all thine
[1:04:51] iniquities who healeth all thy diseases
[1:04:52] who redeemeth thy life from destruction
[1:04:56] who crowns thee with lovingkindness and
[1:04:59] tender mercies who satisfies of thy
[1:05:01] mouth with good things so that thy youth
[1:05:04] is renewed like an eagle to me when I
[1:05:07] read that I remember what brother
[1:05:09] Branham talked about and he said one of
[1:05:11] these days somewhere between 19 and 21
[1:05:14] years old my youth is renewed there are
[1:05:19] some days I wake up in the morning it's
[1:05:21] Oh Lord I'm gonna need some help get out
[1:05:23] of bed this morning just the parts don't
[1:05:26] quite do like they used to but I have a
[1:05:28] promise I do have a promise and that's
[1:05:30] God's Word Isaiah says in chapter 41
[1:05:34] verses 8 and 9 and I chose this too -
[1:05:39] Lord willing to get to something at the
[1:05:42] end here but Isaiah 41 8 and 9
[1:05:46] but thou Israel art my servant Jacob
[1:05:51] whom I've chosen the seed of Abraham my
[1:05:55] friend and we are the spiritual children
[1:05:59] of Abraham every promise everything is
[1:06:03] given to his children he says but thou
[1:06:05] Israel aren't my servant Jacob whom I've
[1:06:08] chosen the seed of Abraham my friend to
[1:06:12] whom I have taken from the ends of the
[1:06:13] earth and called me from the chief men
[1:06:16] thereof and said unto thee thou art my
[1:06:19] servant I have chosen thee and have not
[1:06:22] cast the away now I know Isaiah speaking
[1:06:26] to Israel he's speaking to Israel at
[1:06:29] that time but we can take the very
[1:06:31] promises God and given in fact brother
[1:06:34] Branham always told us if you're not
[1:06:36] finding Jesus Christ all the way through
[1:06:39] the scriptures go back and read it again
[1:06:41] and you'll see that was the fulfillment
[1:06:43] he said I've come to fulfill the law and
[1:06:47] he says that I have chosen thee thou art
[1:06:50] my servant I will not cast me away
[1:06:54] isaiah 54:17
[1:06:56] he tells them in this in Isaiah 54 no
[1:06:59] weapon that is formed against the
[1:07:01] shall prosper and every tongue that
[1:07:04] shall rise against the in judgment thou
[1:07:06] shalt condemn and we get to think well
[1:07:08] I'm gonna condemn them you know that's
[1:07:12] not my heart to condemn somebody but let
[1:07:15] my life speak of the righteousness of
[1:07:19] God rather than a condemning spirit but
[1:07:24] your life full of God let that be what
[1:07:29] if they choose to know they're not
[1:07:31] denying you they're denying God but not
[1:07:33] because you're condemning him but rather
[1:07:35] let that be the life of God in you this
[1:07:40] is the heritage of the servants of the
[1:07:42] Lord and their righteousness is of me
[1:07:46] saith the Lord and I'm glad it's of him
[1:07:50] because there are some days that I sure
[1:07:53] get get upset with myself you know it's
[1:07:56] just Paul said it this way I find myself
[1:07:59] doing things that I don't want to do and
[1:08:02] not doing the things that I should be
[1:08:04] doing and we hit you know in this life
[1:08:07] sometimes the day goes long work gets
[1:08:10] busy you have a lot to do at the end of
[1:08:13] the day you're tired and you said you
[1:08:14] know I'd love to just spend and you
[1:08:17] kneel down and you start falling asleep
[1:08:19] it happens how and you say but that's
[1:08:23] okay because he knows the desire of your
[1:08:28] heart
[1:08:28] he says righteousness is of me in if it
[1:08:35] if it came to our goodness and what we
[1:08:38] were able to perform and what we were
[1:08:41] able to keep and meet all the statutes
[1:08:43] and and come down exactly in fact to me
[1:08:46] that's what what when he said the law
[1:08:49] they chose law over grace and he said if
[1:08:55] you want the law here's my law this is
[1:08:59] the only way you can come and get it and
[1:09:03] have and talked to me through the law
[1:09:04] and you can see how it is described down
[1:09:08] to how many steps to take what you could
[1:09:11] wear how you could act what you were
[1:09:13] supposed to do on this day how
[1:09:15] you were supposed to be if the high
[1:09:17] priests went in and was missed one step
[1:09:19] he lost his life
[1:09:21] that's best before the presence of a
[1:09:24] righteous God but God desired your
[1:09:29] fellowship he wanted to meet with you
[1:09:32] and talk with you and share himself
[1:09:34] again like he did with Adam and Eve so
[1:09:37] he says my grace Paul is sufficient for
[1:09:41] you but we sometimes want to go back to
[1:09:44] the law and you can't live the law you
[1:09:49] know I was driving down the road and
[1:09:50] Annie was talking with my wife and we
[1:09:54] were talking about you know she looked
[1:09:55] at that at the speedy City what's your
[1:09:56] speed limit right now I said I'm going a
[1:09:58] little bit over the speed limit you know
[1:10:00] it says 55 I'm doing 58 but that's okay
[1:10:04] because for the next mile I'll drive at
[1:10:05] 52 so I'll make up I don't think it
[1:10:09] works that way doesn't I don't think so
[1:10:12] the speed limit says 55 but you know
[1:10:15] sometimes it's okay well I'll do two
[1:10:17] good deeds to make up for that bad deed
[1:10:19] no it doesn't it doesn't work that way
[1:10:21] that is the law oh but he became me so
[1:10:28] that I through his love could become him
[1:10:30] he bore the penalty of the law for of us
[1:10:34] the four of us all of us nothing so here
[1:10:37] he's saying they chose law over grace
[1:10:43] they wanted to be like the others now we
[1:10:47] get over to st. John chapter 14 we'll go
[1:10:53] from verse 26 to 29 and he says but the
[1:10:59] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[1:11:02] the father will send in my name he shall
[1:11:05] teach you all things and bring all
[1:11:08] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[1:11:11] have said unto you he's talking to his
[1:11:15] disciples here and there he tells them I
[1:11:17] must go away I've gotta go these things
[1:11:21] I've got to do and they're telling them
[1:11:23] no no you know we had hope we had wanted
[1:11:26] you to restore the kingdom
[1:11:28] we thought the Romans would be gone
[1:11:31] where we would become the sovereign
[1:11:32] nation you would this is this and he
[1:11:35] says no I've got to go away because
[1:11:37] there's a better way than this and you
[1:11:40] know and you think about that and and
[1:11:43] and the book of before accident in the
[1:11:47] Gospels and they record the events
[1:11:50] before the crucifixion of Jesus Christ
[1:11:52] and you saw his disciples his followers
[1:11:56] fall away at one time 70 at another time
[1:12:02] all of them except for John who was
[1:12:03] there at the foot of the cross but the
[1:12:05] rest I mean Peter even denies him the
[1:12:09] very same one who Jesus has said to him
[1:12:11] blessed art thou simon barjona for the
[1:12:14] father has revealed this to you but he
[1:12:17] denies him he said because the comforter
[1:12:20] had to come the same one that Isaiah had
[1:12:24] spoken him behold unto you and he speaks
[1:12:29] of this comforter well while he was
[1:12:31] there they were gonna be happy with him
[1:12:34] and everything but he said I've got a
[1:12:36] better way he said because and he said
[1:12:38] when you receive this comforter these
[1:12:42] things that have I've taught you and
[1:12:44] have showed you you will remember let's
[1:12:47] go on he says peace I live with you my
[1:12:51] peace I give unto you not as a world
[1:12:54] giveth give I unto you and let not your
[1:12:57] heart be troubled neither let it be
[1:12:59] afraid you know when a heart gets
[1:13:03] troubled in and when you gets anxious
[1:13:06] and and you start to think in little
[1:13:09] things like that come big things which
[1:13:11] just continue to grow you know it you we
[1:13:16] talk about him and then when you come
[1:13:17] back and you you see it you look at Wow
[1:13:19] that little thing sure became something
[1:13:21] big in my life and and when the doubts
[1:13:24] and when the fears get to be in working
[1:13:26] they draw other spirits to them you know
[1:13:32] it's amazing because even the Scriptures
[1:13:35] tell us that a man has been cleaned
[1:13:38] he's been washed out he's been made
[1:13:40] clean and those spirits
[1:13:43] cast out of them they go around and they
[1:13:45] look for another place to get into and
[1:13:48] they come back and look to see this
[1:13:50] house they were comfortable in that
[1:13:52] house one time they liked that place
[1:13:54] they had made themselves at home there
[1:13:56] and they come back to see and he says
[1:13:59] see if it's still empty
[1:14:01] so that spirit comes back and he calls
[1:14:04] that says his friends over and is 7
[1:14:07] times worse
[1:14:08] that little thing suddenly is this big
[1:14:12] maybe explain it this way to understand
[1:14:15] you just kind of shaded the truth a
[1:14:18] little bit to the side and we're
[1:14:21] probably all guilty of that sometimes
[1:14:22] it's it's mostly true but we leaned it a
[1:14:26] little bit to make ourselves look a
[1:14:27] little better maybe so I wouldn't be so
[1:14:30] embarrassed or so and then you got to
[1:14:32] retell it again and now you've got to
[1:14:34] work with it a little bit more and work
[1:14:36] with a little bit more and pretty soon
[1:14:38] this story is nowhere near this story
[1:14:40] and there's a lot of fixing to do at
[1:14:43] that point it's like throwing the what
[1:14:45] is a pillow full of feathers out into
[1:14:47] the wind go back and try to collect them
[1:14:49] it is a difficult thing to do he says so
[1:14:53] he says he says let let let not your
[1:14:56] heart be troubled neither let it be
[1:14:58] afraid this piece that I give with you
[1:15:01] how does that piece come well he is the
[1:15:03] Prince of Peace but there is something
[1:15:06] else - they might that piece comes
[1:15:09] because he gives us to know what this
[1:15:12] word of God means so not through
[1:15:16] somebody else's interpretation is not
[1:15:18] your idea of it but this is so because
[1:15:20] you know what he desires what he wants
[1:15:23] you can do it and there's a peace in
[1:15:25] doing what God asks you to do there's a
[1:15:29] joy in that I was able to not as a work
[1:15:32] but because you love him and you know
[1:15:35] the fruit of it he says so again let not
[1:15:37] your heart be troubled neither let it be
[1:15:40] afraid and fear can grip a person to do
[1:15:44] things that is you read that you read
[1:15:47] things that people have done because of
[1:15:50] a fear thing and and from people lifting
[1:15:53] up a car for somebody to come out just
[1:15:55] in that month
[1:15:56] things that we normally couldn't do but
[1:15:58] in that moment but God can do it all the
[1:16:03] time if we let himself let's go on the
[1:16:07] last 29 it says verse 29 there and now I
[1:16:18] have told you before it come to pass
[1:16:20] that when it come to pass you might
[1:16:23] believe as you see these promises of God
[1:16:27] are being fulfilled you can say yes and
[1:16:30] you can be encouraged and you can be
[1:16:32] strengthened and you can learn upon each
[1:16:34] one and say the same God like David did
[1:16:37] that delivered me from the lion and
[1:16:39] delivered me from the bear is going to
[1:16:41] deliver me from you and the next one
[1:16:44] because in this life we face troubles we
[1:16:48] face things all the way through but the
[1:16:50] same God the overcomer in you overcomes
[1:16:54] every one of them and I like the way
[1:16:57] he's Paul says this and in Thessalonians
[1:17:00] chapter 3 verse 5 and the Lord direct
[1:17:04] your hearts into the love of God and
[1:17:07] into the patient waiting for Christ and
[1:17:10] as I was looking at that I was looking
[1:17:11] at some of the other ways it was waiting
[1:17:13] steadfast not movable not not with every
[1:17:18] time the wind blows you shift to one
[1:17:20] side every time you go but waiting
[1:17:22] steadfast waiting there is it or in a
[1:17:25] quiet waiting for not an anxious not a
[1:17:28] worked up not a frustration but in a
[1:17:30] quiet waiting for Christ where the peace
[1:17:33] of God is there saying lord I don't see
[1:17:35] the end I don't see the end of the
[1:17:37] tunnel or I see the light from a
[1:17:40] distance but I'm waiting on you knowing
[1:17:42] that you're taking me there I like the
[1:17:44] way Paul put that it just spoke to me I
[1:17:46] said you know the Lord direct your
[1:17:48] hearts into the love of God o love of
[1:17:51] God how rich help here how measureless
[1:17:54] it provided everything that we had to
[1:17:58] eat him because he loved us now let's go
[1:18:02] into Romans and this is kind of where
[1:18:03] I'd like to to bring this thought to
[1:18:09] Romans we'll look at Romans chapter 10
[1:18:12] we know Romans chapter 8 28 probably one
[1:18:17] of the most quoted scriptures Romans
[1:18:19] 8:28 I don't I didn't give it to brother
[1:18:21] Jeremy but I'll just for we know that
[1:18:23] all things happen for our good and as as
[1:18:28] to those who are the called and I put my
[1:18:31] name in there put your name in there to
[1:18:34] those that are called he says we know
[1:18:37] that but when we get into Romans 10 Paul
[1:18:39] opens this and in Romans chapter 10 and
[1:18:42] Paul is speaking of the children of
[1:18:44] Israel he goes those who God blinded for
[1:18:50] your and my sakes so let's go to chapter
[1:18:53] 10 we'll start with verse 8 so we know
[1:18:56] how Paul starts as speaking of Israel
[1:18:59] being blinded and then he comes to say
[1:19:02] this he said because it's not of
[1:19:04] circumcision or uncircumcision and he
[1:19:07] says but what saith the word is nigh
[1:19:10] thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart
[1:19:13] that is the Word of Faith which we
[1:19:16] preach
[1:19:17] Paul said aplenty it's this Word of God
[1:19:20] that we're preaching if any angel would
[1:19:22] come and say something different than
[1:19:24] this let him be accursed and that still
[1:19:28] holds that wasn't just in his time of
[1:19:31] writing that still today if anything if
[1:19:33] a thought and something in your heart
[1:19:34] would be contrary this let that be set
[1:19:36] aside let that be pushed away but rather
[1:19:39] stand by faith that if thou shalt
[1:19:42] confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus
[1:19:44] and shalt believe in thine heart that
[1:19:46] God has raised him from the dead thou
[1:19:50] shalt be saved
[1:19:53] no is that salvation a one-time thing no
[1:19:57] it's a continual work of God he redeemed
[1:20:02] us but he is still working everything
[1:20:05] out for our good let's go to verse 10
[1:20:09] for with a heart man believeth unto
[1:20:14] righteousness and with the mouth
[1:20:16] confession is made unto
[1:20:20] it's it's a part that we play
[1:20:22] it's our part in this he's telling he he
[1:20:26] blinded the Jews from this to give us
[1:20:29] this opportunity and he says with a
[1:20:35] mouth confession is made unto salvation
[1:20:37] with what we speak we do or we don't
[1:20:43] it's not that God's Word doesn't it's
[1:20:46] how we speak God's Word never fails
[1:20:49] God's Word is the same yesterday today
[1:20:52] and forever but if you won't let what we
[1:20:55] talked about that behold I stand at the
[1:20:57] door and knock if you'll open the door
[1:21:00] I'll come in but if you don't open the
[1:21:03] door he stays on the outside I think was
[1:21:06] brother Matthew they talked about a
[1:21:07] little bit went last Sunday when he said
[1:21:10] they they call for a time of Prayer but
[1:21:12] no time of repentance Lord saved me from
[1:21:16] this so I can go on doing what I was
[1:21:18] doing
[1:21:18] that's really why I want you to save me
[1:21:21] for because I want to continue but when
[1:21:23] a heart turns around and says Lord saved
[1:21:25] me from this and changed my life so I
[1:21:29] don't desire that anymore let that be
[1:21:31] the confession let that change me Oh
[1:21:34] Lord take this out of my life
[1:21:36] I don't want to deal with it I don't
[1:21:38] want to I think do that to me for the
[1:21:40] scripture saith whosoever believeth on
[1:21:43] him shall not be ashamed you know as
[1:21:47] sometimes you know maybe a product has
[1:21:50] failed you you've you've told somebody
[1:21:54] you know hey we went over this
[1:21:55] restaurant and it happened to me and
[1:21:57] that's when when say my boss he asked me
[1:21:59] do you know a place where they made good
[1:22:01] Manila and I said yeah there's this
[1:22:04] place that I go to and I buy it all the
[1:22:05] time there so he went and got some and
[1:22:08] he got home and he said I've never
[1:22:11] tasted a lousy room I knew them all my
[1:22:12] life I don't know if what his
[1:22:15] expectation was or they just made a bad
[1:22:17] batch so then I tried it one more time
[1:22:20] we were we were out working together in
[1:22:22] horror where is a good place to stop and
[1:22:23] get some DEET I said well there's this
[1:22:25] little truck over here and I really
[1:22:26] liked their food so we went over there
[1:22:29] and we ordered and he ordered what in
[1:22:30] and then we went we were both going on
[1:22:32] to a different
[1:22:32] when he called me back up he says I've
[1:22:34] never had such a bad burrito in my life
[1:22:36] he goes to meet I'm going like oh wow
[1:22:39] I'm never gonna recommend anything to
[1:22:41] you I guess then you know for me it was
[1:22:44] good but I'm just saying you know so I
[1:22:46] was embarrassed to do it now so
[1:22:49] sometimes he now he hasn't asked me
[1:22:50] lately where's a good place to eat I
[1:22:52] think he just goes to where he wants to
[1:22:54] go now but I'm just saying for the
[1:22:57] scripture says whoever believeth on him
[1:22:59] shall not be ashamed you you you have no
[1:23:03] fear of recommending this to someone
[1:23:06] else because it doesn't fail
[1:23:07] I remember this testimony as a young man
[1:23:11] one of my cousins and they not been
[1:23:14] raising the Pentecostal church that we
[1:23:17] were they were raised Catholic because
[1:23:18] their mother was Catholic and that's how
[1:23:20] they were raised and and the older the
[1:23:23] older cousin mark he was my older
[1:23:25] brothers age he was experimenting
[1:23:28] started experimenting with with drugs
[1:23:29] and things and and and when this message
[1:23:32] came and we were dad had gone over and
[1:23:34] we're all talking together there and so
[1:23:37] he makes a comment he says well tell me
[1:23:39] why smoking is wrong and I knew that you
[1:23:45] know the different family members had
[1:23:47] preached to them and and and my uncle
[1:23:49] used to go to the same church we did but
[1:23:51] you know my aunt was Catholic and all
[1:23:54] and it was a difference in the in their
[1:23:56] up raising and we began to say some of
[1:23:59] the same things I've heard all those
[1:24:00] it's bad for my health it's this than
[1:24:03] the other but tell me why it's wrong but
[1:24:06] because God had shown us already through
[1:24:10] the unveiling of God's Word the spirits
[1:24:12] that caused those things we began to
[1:24:15] tell him and when I say well i was i was
[1:24:17] listening as my older brother told him
[1:24:19] that it's a spirit in you that craves
[1:24:22] that and it's the first time he says
[1:24:25] that's the first time i've ever heard
[1:24:27] anything that makes sense but he didn't
[1:24:31] accept it but it didn't make sense so
[1:24:35] it's not that just making this sense but
[1:24:38] rather receiving it letting it become
[1:24:40] part of you letting it bring it to its
[1:24:42] fruit and it will not make
[1:24:45] you shamed you can say I can recommend
[1:24:50] this for there is no difference between
[1:24:52] the Jew and the Greek for the same lord
[1:24:54] over all is rich unto all that call upon
[1:24:58] him he has more than enough more than
[1:25:02] enough let's go on for whosoever shall
[1:25:08] call upon the name of the Lord shall be
[1:25:10] saved and how then shall they call on
[1:25:15] him in whom they have not believed and
[1:25:17] how shall they believe in him of whom
[1:25:20] they have not heard and how shall they
[1:25:22] hear without a preacher and I stopped
[1:25:28] though like that without a preacher does
[1:25:32] that mean every preacher has to stand
[1:25:33] behind a pulpit I don't think I think
[1:25:36] the life that we preach every day
[1:25:39] wherever we're at wherever a situation
[1:25:42] we're in where we find out I think that
[1:25:44] put has the ability to reach up more
[1:25:46] people sometimes sometimes in a church
[1:25:49] service we might get one or two or three
[1:25:51] visitors that never heard but most the
[1:25:52] time in our church service most of us
[1:25:54] are here are believers but you and
[1:25:57] you're out there
[1:25:58] whatever your situation is wherever
[1:25:59] you're at what is your life preaching is
[1:26:02] there preaching joy is a preaching
[1:26:05] happiness is a preaching contentment or
[1:26:08] is there preaching a self-righteous
[1:26:10] attitude I'm a Christian therefore you
[1:26:13] can't be that way I've heard that one
[1:26:16] before in fact I had to one happen to me
[1:26:19] the other day my my I I called him my
[1:26:21] old boss the guy worked for a long time
[1:26:24] his name is Tony and he sent me a tax he
[1:26:28] said can we play golf and I said but at
[1:26:30] this time I can't play so he sent me you
[1:26:33] know how they put all the little things
[1:26:35] for cursing on the text you know and I I
[1:26:40] just texted back to my said decode that
[1:26:43] please and he says I can't you're a
[1:26:47] minister
[1:26:49] not that I okay so did get your
[1:26:52] attention didn't it because he's my boss
[1:26:54] or he wasn't my boss who worked many
[1:26:56] years but I never said those things
[1:26:58] about them I never treated them wrong
[1:27:00] but I didn't talk like them I didn't act
[1:27:02] like them had no desire to and here.his
[1:27:06] those who hit was his response was I
[1:27:07] can't say those words because you're a
[1:27:10] minister and I wouldn't do it now I wish
[1:27:12] she would act like that to everybody
[1:27:14] not just me just not use the words but
[1:27:17] the life you preach the life you live
[1:27:20] speaks louder so many times than the
[1:27:24] words that are said now I know the
[1:27:26] preaching of the word but I'd like to
[1:27:28] looked at also the life that we live 15
[1:27:34] and it's going to versa and how shall
[1:27:37] they preach except they be sent as it is
[1:27:40] written how beautiful are the feet of
[1:27:42] them that preach the gospel of peace and
[1:27:45] bring glad tidings of good things and I
[1:27:49] know that is that is part of a ministry
[1:27:51] but it's also part of a life we have you
[1:27:56] know somebody could say and I saw it
[1:27:57] happen at work they would they would do
[1:28:01] their things they would say their stuff
[1:28:02] but I hadn't come I said your you're a
[1:28:06] Christian right can you pray for my
[1:28:09] daughter can you do this they knew where
[1:28:13] to go I never treated them wrong I never
[1:28:16] tried to to insult them or anything but
[1:28:18] I just wanted to be a Christian in front
[1:28:19] of them and then they would come to the
[1:28:22] point that I had one of them asked me if
[1:28:24] I would do his funeral when he passed
[1:28:27] away and I said why he says because
[1:28:31] you'll speak honestly about me because
[1:28:34] you know me he says you'll be an honest
[1:28:37] man there he said you won't make up all
[1:28:39] these stories and make me sound like an
[1:28:42] angel I said no I know you're not an
[1:28:44] angel but then neither am i I say and I
[1:28:48] thought that isn't interesting that
[1:28:50] somebody would come and say that you
[1:28:52] will speak the truth and I thank God for
[1:28:55] that but it's a life lived it's it's a
[1:28:58] voice preaching
[1:29:01] not so much behind a pulpit but a life
[1:29:03] live but yet at the same time how
[1:29:05] beautiful are the feet of them that
[1:29:07] preach the gospel of peace and bring
[1:29:09] good tidings and I'm glad there are
[1:29:10] ministers that will stand behind the
[1:29:12] pulpit and do that and tell us and
[1:29:15] preach and minister the goodness of the
[1:29:18] Lord but they have not all obeyed the
[1:29:22] gospel for Isaiah said Lord who have
[1:29:26] believed our report so then faith cometh
[1:29:29] by hearing and hearing by the word so
[1:29:34] when the life you minister the words you
[1:29:37] speak back right into what the Word of
[1:29:40] God says then faith comes with it and
[1:29:45] those things that God has said he will
[1:29:48] do those things that God said he will
[1:29:50] perform because of faith puts them into
[1:29:53] action and you know it doesn't say
[1:29:56] because of your holiness of your
[1:29:58] righteousness because of how many hours
[1:30:00] you prayed about how many good deeds you
[1:30:02] did but rather you had faith because
[1:30:05] you've heard his word and you've taken
[1:30:07] at it and I thought about that as I was
[1:30:09] reading my mind went back to that
[1:30:10] Centurion that Roman centurion who
[1:30:13] looked at God at Jesus standing in there
[1:30:16] and he says my servant is dying and
[1:30:20] Jesus as well go and he says now wait a
[1:30:23] minute I understand the authority you
[1:30:26] have he goes because I have authority I
[1:30:30] say to one go and they go I say to
[1:30:33] another one do and they do he said if
[1:30:36] you'll just speak these spirit
[1:30:38] sicknesses and all are under your
[1:30:40] command they're under your authority so
[1:30:43] just speak and that Centurion turns
[1:30:47] around and says no he says I have Jesus
[1:30:50] says I mean says to him I have never
[1:30:52] seen such a faith he says so then faith
[1:30:56] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[1:30:58] Word of God and his faith that takes a
[1:31:01] we are the children of Abraham the
[1:31:03] father of faith and that's what God
[1:31:06] honors and respects he says and to think
[1:31:09] about that how a man would faith a man
[1:31:12] who could take God's Word assist
[1:31:14] I think about sister Hetty right and
[1:31:17] brother branham is talking about those
[1:31:19] those five times of the spoken word and
[1:31:24] and maybe to us who were raised as
[1:31:27] Christians or raised in a message church
[1:31:29] we've been raised around all of this
[1:31:31] it's it's it's not something that
[1:31:33] catches us by surprise but imagine those
[1:31:36] who were raised in the church where they
[1:31:38] told him those things don't happen
[1:31:39] anymore
[1:31:40] and she is she has this tutu where bread
[1:31:43] bran talks about speaking creation
[1:31:46] speaking things into life and she says
[1:31:49] brother branham bat is nothing but the
[1:31:52] truth and God says give her what she
[1:31:56] wants because it please God because when
[1:32:03] job said though God slay me yet I'll
[1:32:06] trust him
[1:32:07] God is still looking said job there's
[1:32:10] gonna be a chapter 38 written and in
[1:32:13] your book of life Joe isn't there yet
[1:32:17] but God is already preparing those
[1:32:20] things there's going to be a chapter in
[1:32:23] your life where that comes to affect and
[1:32:27] it should be now it should be daily
[1:32:29] taking God at His Word and watching God
[1:32:32] bring it to pass and when you get to
[1:32:36] that fellowship or that relationship
[1:32:39] with God we're we're it's it's not let
[1:32:44] me it's not a surprise it's not a
[1:32:47] something you got to work up to but it's
[1:32:49] part of the fellowship what you do all
[1:32:51] the time it's it's his desire to be with
[1:32:55] you like your desire is to be with him
[1:32:56] and it's evident and so that faith
[1:33:00] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[1:33:02] Word of God we hear a lot of things a
[1:33:05] lot of things are being said today over
[1:33:07] the news over this and you know you get
[1:33:11] on and you read the news and like I said
[1:33:13] this the Democrats are pulling this way
[1:33:15] and the Republicans are pulling this way
[1:33:16] and this group is doing that and this
[1:33:18] church is going this way and these
[1:33:21] people are saying well we don't have to
[1:33:22] listen to the government you're hearing
[1:33:24] everything that's going on that doesn't
[1:33:26] bring faith
[1:33:27] that can bring fear that can bring
[1:33:29] nervousness that can bring criticism
[1:33:32] like I can bring everything else but
[1:33:34] when you go back Lord what do you say in
[1:33:36] a time like this
[1:33:38] what do you have to say about this
[1:33:41] situation what have you said let me go
[1:33:43] back if I have to and as our brother
[1:33:46] spoke I believe it was the brother Tim
[1:33:48] that said go back to that place where
[1:33:50] you met him go back and remind yourself
[1:33:53] that was God that was God that was God
[1:33:56] and encourage yourself again
[1:33:58] go back to what the Word of God said I
[1:34:01] will be with you I'll never leave you I
[1:34:03] will deliver you I will comfort you I'll
[1:34:06] be your piece also pry every one of your
[1:34:08] needs yes Lord you're still the same
[1:34:11] yesterday today and forever and then you
[1:34:14] can say like David Lord though I walk
[1:34:16] through the valley of shadow of death I
[1:34:17] will fear no evil but I wrought in thy
[1:34:19] staff they comfort me
[1:34:21] that's the word of God and that defeats
[1:34:25] Satan
[1:34:25] every time every single time because he
[1:34:29] cannot combat the Word of God the
[1:34:32] musicians would come
[1:34:37] if if it was our thoughts we would be in
[1:34:43] trouble sometimes our thoughts are good
[1:34:45] and sometimes our thoughts are not very
[1:34:48] good
[1:34:49] sometimes our thoughts are full of hope
[1:34:51] and full of faith and sometimes they're
[1:34:53] critical but if you take guarded word
[1:34:55] and say I'll think on these things
[1:34:59] well what God has said what God has
[1:35:02] given unto us in this day through a
[1:35:04] message it has come and we can go back
[1:35:06] and say what did God and we can look at
[1:35:09] it and God will speak to us today so
[1:35:11] amen sheltered safe in the arms of God
[1:35:14] that is my rants Lord we you said you
[1:35:18] would never leave us you we would never
[1:35:21] be left all alone trying to fight
[1:35:24] through this time through these thoughts
[1:35:25] through these actions through these ways
[1:35:28] which said I'll be with you even in you
[1:35:31] to the end of the world you said you
[1:35:33] told your disciples I have a better way
[1:35:35] a comforter she'll come and he told
[1:35:38] teach you all these things he'll bring
[1:35:40] them back to your remembrance you said
[1:35:42] father we just appreciate that today
[1:35:45] lord help us to be a little more quiet a
[1:35:48] little more restful a little bit more at
[1:35:51] peace and take you at your word and let
[1:35:54] you speak to us Lord not to be so
[1:35:56] anxious and caught up with the events of
[1:35:58] the day and the events of time and and
[1:36:01] everything that they're saying Lord but
[1:36:03] rather what does God's Word say what is
[1:36:05] God trying to speak and tell us today
[1:36:07] more that our spirits be quiet even as
[1:36:10] you said for us the peace that passes
[1:36:13] all understanding you even tell us to be
[1:36:16] still
[1:36:18] and let and know that you are God Lord
[1:36:20] let not be better us not be anxious and
[1:36:22] and disquieted Lord but to be at rest to
[1:36:26] be still and let you know let us know
[1:36:29] that you are God we ask it in Jesus
[1:36:32] Christ's name Amen
[1:36:34] I heard that the testimony of this song
[1:36:38] it was written by Dottie Rambo and she
[1:36:42] couldn't come find the words to the
[1:36:44] first verse she said you were just
[1:36:46] coming to Jeremy if you would put the
[1:36:49] first verse up to that
[1:36:51] and and she was out at the ocean she's
[1:36:54] by the beach after a storm and the storm
[1:36:57] was was washing everything up that it
[1:37:00] driftwood and stuff all over and she was
[1:37:03] thinking she said Lord you know why all
[1:37:05] of this and this is her testimony she
[1:37:08] said as she was walking she just
[1:37:09] couldn't find the first to the chorus
[1:37:12] and she said she felt a hand of touch
[1:37:14] her shoulder she said I literally felt
[1:37:17] the five fingers of the hand reach and
[1:37:19] touch me on the shoulder and these work
[1:37:21] escape and sometimes they'll combine and
[1:37:25] he'll meet you touch you in a way that
[1:37:27] you
[1:37:28] [Music]
[1:39:36] Oh

[1:40:32] [Music]
[1:41:09] [Applause]
[1:41:18] [Music]
[1:41:37] you know to think sheltered safe in the
[1:41:40] arms of God and as she was giving that
[1:41:43] testimony you've seen the song and Lord
[1:41:47] knew I had this song in my heart already
[1:41:48] for today so I looked it up didn't know
[1:41:51] who wrote the song is written by Dottie
[1:41:53] Rambo and as she's singing it she began
[1:41:57] to sing the last line of their purse and
[1:42:02] she was saying they're sheltered safe in
[1:42:04] the arms of God and she began to speak
[1:42:07] to folks he said your children your
[1:42:10] mother sheltered safe maybe they're
[1:42:12] going through something maybe they're
[1:42:14] going through but you've committed them
[1:42:16] to the Lord you've given them to God
[1:42:18] they're sheltered in that comforted me
[1:42:20] to to realize that the Lord is mindful
[1:42:23] sometimes we look at situations and our
[1:42:26] families and in friends maybe our
[1:42:28] children or our brother or sister or
[1:42:30] maybe a husband wife a mother father and
[1:42:33] wondering why alone
[1:42:35] they're given over to God we've
[1:42:37] committed to the Lord and though job was
[1:42:40] going through all of what Joe was going
[1:42:42] he was still sheltered safe in the arms
[1:42:46] of God because God watches over him so
[1:42:50] let the storm treat you so
