[30:45] symptoms and uh sister Naomi Walters has
[30:48] pneumonia and she's not doing well.
[30:50] She's at home resting. We want to keep
[30:53] her held up before the Lord in prayer
[30:55] this
[30:57] morning. We bring these prayer requests
[30:59] because he answers them. We don't just
[31:02] bring them to read them and talk about
[31:04] the troubles we have. We bring them
[31:06] because he has the power to fix the
[31:08] problem. Isn't that right? Amen. So, if
[31:11] you have anything you need to hold up
[31:13] before him this morning, he can hear it
[31:15] and answer it. Brother Adam, if you
[31:18] don't pray.
[31:23] [Music]
[31:24] Heavenly Father, it's always such an
[31:26] honor to come to you in prayer, Lord. As
[31:30] our brother was saying, we just we live
[31:32] beneath our privileges because we don't
[31:35] ask, Lord. So, we come to you asking for
[31:38] these things today, Lord, with brother
[31:40] Lyall, Sister Naomi, and all the other
[31:43] requests that are out there. Lord, we
[31:45] ask in just faith and confidence that
[31:47] you are God answering prayer. So Lord,
[31:50] we pray that you'd be with them and
[31:52] every other one that has a need. Just
[31:54] ask this morning for a special service,
[31:57] a special blessing on this service,
[32:00] Lord, that you would be with each one in
[32:02] the congregation. And pray that you
[32:04] would touch hearts this morning, Lord.
[32:06] Draw us closer to you and teach us,
[32:08] Lord, how to serve each other, Lord.
[32:12] serve you by serving each other. Pray
[32:15] for for that revelation today that you
[32:17] would be with us and love you and thank
[32:19] you for all these things and we ask it
[32:21] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[32:23] [Music]
[32:25] Amen. You can all have your seats and
[32:28] then if you want to take up the
[32:31] offering just as the brothers take up,
[32:34] let's say a quick word of prayer. Lord
[32:36] Jesus, thank you for everyone who's here
[32:37] this morning. Thank you for the giving.
[32:40] Lord Jesus, I pray that whatever is
[32:42] given in the in the tithes and offerings
[32:43] this morning that you take it, bless it,
[32:45] multiply it, use it only for your glory
[32:48] in Jesus name.
[32:49] Amen. As you see, brother Adams here
[32:52] visiting us. Let's welcome him this
[32:54] morning. Thank you for being
[32:59] here. You were already standing, so I
[33:01] won't make you stand, but Amos and Lena,
[33:03] would you
[33:04] stand? Would you stand with the baby?

[33:13] little while in Phoenix or something
[33:16] like that. Welcome. Thank you for being
[33:18] here this morning. And anyone else who's
[33:21] here, God bless you. Thank you for
[33:23] coming. We're just here to worship him
[33:26] down from his glory. Brother Jeremy, I'm
[33:28] sorry I didn't send you that song before

[33:34] Jesus was his name.
[33:36] He came down from glory to save a sinner
[33:39] like
[33:39] me and to make me his
[33:42] child. The greatest story ever told.
[33:46] Down from his glory. Do we have

[34:23] manger to his own a strangeanger.
[34:31] A man of
[34:33] sorrows,
[34:35] tears, and
[34:39] agony. Let's sing it with all our

[34:49] him, how I
[34:53] adore him. Hallelujah. He's my breath,

[37:47] Calary. And now I know thou art the
[37:54] great

[38:43] dwell in
[38:47] him. Last weekend, we went to a funeral
[38:50] of Sister Zyra's friend and she got up
[38:53] to share a little bit at the service and
[38:56] speak to the family and the friends and
[38:59] she talked about the memories she had
[39:01] had with this
[39:02] friend. I'm sorry for sharing this. And
[39:06] then she broke she began to break down.
[39:08] It's emotional at a funeral. And uh she
[39:12] said, "I accepted the Lord into my
[39:14] heart." Did you say two years ago? She
[39:17] said, "Two years ago, I accepted the
[39:18] Lord into my heart." And she said, "It's
[39:20] the best thing I've ever
[39:22] done." Let's
[39:30] sing. That is the truth. It's the best
[39:32] thing you'll ever
[39:34] do. So, Brother Daniel had this song on
[39:37] his heart. I I also had this song on my
[39:39] heart. We're gonna sing it. Falling in

[44:36] strength, he was a friend. When I needed
[44:37] a friend, he's always just been a
[44:40] wonderful, wonderful brother to me.
[44:42] Marily, it's good to see you again.
[44:44] You've been sick for a while. God bless
[44:46] you. Welcome. Welcome home. Ruth back
[44:49] there and the family. God bless you.
[44:52] It's good. Good to have you all. I
[44:54] wanted to start this morning service.
[44:57] Daniel told me a testimony uh shared a
[44:59] testimony with me a couple days ago and
[45:02] I thought, you know, this would be good
[45:04] on my subject this morning and I think
[45:06] it would be good for the whole church to
[45:09] hear. I think it'd be a blessing to you.
[45:11] So, I want to take a couple minutes and
[45:14] give it to my son and if you could
[45:16] share, buddy. Thank you. God bless you
[45:18] all.
[45:20] Um, so I was at work one day and this it
[45:23] was a really powerful thing I feel like
[45:24] happened to me and immediately after it
[45:26] happened I was like I have to call dad.
[45:28] So I went took a break and I called dad.
[45:30] I was I was just really excited about
[45:31] it. But anyway, this I I was working one
[45:35] day and as most of you know I'm a tech
[45:36] in the hospital and I deal with usually
[45:40] very sick patients and you know very
[45:42] needy patients. You know they need to
[45:44] they need us to help them with
[45:45] activities of just daily living. And so
[45:48] I walked into this one room and this
[45:50] guy, he hadn't been calling all day and
[45:52] he was just kind of sleeping and he was
[45:54] he was kind of with it. He was one of my
[45:55] patients who didn't need very much help.
[45:58] And so I kind of got worried about him.
[45:59] I was like I was like, "I wonder if this
[46:00] guy's doing okay." And I was just he was
[46:02] on my mind. And so I I walk in the room
[46:05] and I I was like, "Hey man, I got your
[46:06] lunch for you." And he's like, "Oh, you
[46:08] know, thank you." I was like, "Do you
[46:08] need anything?" He's like, "No, man. I'm
[46:10] fine." I was just like then I stopped
[46:12] and I was like, "Man," I was like, "You
[46:13] seem down today." And I was like, "You
[46:15] seem down." I was like I was like I was
[46:17] like what's wrong? I was like how can I
[46:18] help you? And he looked at me and big
[46:21] tears just started coming to his eyes
[46:23] and he just started just crying and I
[46:25] was like man I was like what's wrong and
[46:27] the only words he could get out at first
[46:29] he was like dude I just messed up. He's
[46:32] like I messed up so many times and he
[46:34] was like and I just really messed up. He
[46:36] was like this was my last mess up. He
[46:38] was like it was it was just the worst.
[46:40] And I was like man I was like what
[46:41] happened? And anyway, he was a he was a
[46:44] recovering drug addict and he had just
[46:46] started doing really well and he started
[46:48] to have a relationship with his family
[46:50] again. And then he was he started
[46:52] hanging around the wrong people and um
[46:55] hanging around the wrong people caused
[46:56] him to fail and he had an overdose and
[46:58] that's what put him into the hospital
[47:00] where I was at. And he was just so down.
[47:03] He was like, "Man, there's no more hope
[47:04] for me." He was like, "There's nothing
[47:06] left I can do." And I was like, man, I
[47:09] was like, "There's there's never no more
[47:11] hope, man." And I was like, just the
[47:12] fact that you're alive here today.
[47:14] You're with me. I was like, means you
[47:16] still have a purpose to live. You still
[47:18] have a reason to live. And he just
[47:20] looked at me. He was like, man, I just
[47:21] don't know what to do. I don't know. And
[47:23] I asked him, I was like, I was like,
[47:24] well, I was like, are you a Christian?
[47:26] And he was like, he was like, yeah, man.
[47:27] He was like, but he was like, I he was
[47:29] like, I used to go through this program
[47:30] with the church. He was like, but I
[47:32] always just felt like they were judging
[47:33] me. And I was I was like, man, I was
[47:35] like, that's not Jesus. I was like,
[47:36] "Jesus is always there to always give us
[47:38] a second chance, to always always give
[47:40] us more than a second chance, to give us
[47:42] as many chances as it takes." And so I
[47:45] got the opportunity to ask him. I was
[47:46] like, "Can I pray with you today?" And
[47:48] he was like, he was like, "Man, I would
[47:49] just love that." And so me and him sat
[47:51] there and we prayed and we talked for
[47:53] about two hours. And it just it really
[47:54] blessed me to be able just to sit there
[47:56] with one of God's children and just pray
[47:58] with them. Amen. Amen.
[48:09] Falling in love with Jesus. One more
[48:11] time. Falling in
[48:13] love with
[48:15] [Music]
[48:18] Jesus. Falling in
[48:21] love with Jesus.
[48:26] Oh, falling in
[48:28] love with Jesus.
[48:31] [Music]
[48:33] was the best thing I've ever
[48:37] ever done. One more time. Falling in
[48:38] love with Jesus.
[48:41] Oh, falling in
[48:44] love with Jesus.
[48:48] [Music]
[48:50] Falling in
[48:52] love with Jesus.
[48:56] [Music]
[48:58] Falling in
[48:59] love with
[49:03] Jesus was the best thing I've
[49:07] ever ever done. Lord God
[49:11] Almighty. Falling in love with Jesus.
[49:14] Lord, it it's the best day of our lives
[49:17] when we fell in love with our Savior and
[49:20] our
[49:22] Lord. Father, I appreciate the testimony
[49:25] from Daniel. And Lord, if we could
[49:28] represent this Jesus Christ that we have
[49:31] fallen in love with, if we could
[49:33] represent him, Father, to this world and
[49:36] then maybe others would fall in
[49:38] love. Oh dear
[49:40] God, let us represent you well, we pray.
[49:44] Bless our service, Father, and bless
[49:46] these scriptures as I read them in Jesus
[49:50] name. Amen. If you could remain standing
[49:54] and keep playing, Sister Katie, I'm
[49:56] going to read Luke chapter 18 and we're
[49:59] going to stay in our parable series
[50:00] here. Luke chapter
[50:02] 18, verse
[50:05] 9. We started on the subject of pride on
[50:08] Wednesday. And I want to continue on
[50:10] with that
[50:12] subject. The Gospel of Luke chapter 18
[50:15] verse9 it says
[50:17] this
[50:19] Jesus speaking of Jesus and he spake
[50:21] this parable unto a certain which
[50:24] trusted in themselves that they were
[50:27] righteous and despised
[50:30] others. Two men went up to the temple to
[50:33] pray. The one a Pharisee and the other a
[50:35] publican. Publican is a tax collector.
[50:38] It's a very low person in the society
[50:40] back then. one a Pharisee and the other
[50:43] a publican. The Pharisees stood and
[50:45] prayed thus with himself, "God, I thank
[50:48] thee that I am not as these other men
[50:51] are, extortioners and unjust and
[50:53] adulterers, or even as this
[50:57] publican. I fast twice a
[51:00] week. I give tithes of all that I
[51:03] possess." And the publican standing a
[51:06] far off would not lift up so much as his
[51:09] eyes into heaven.
[51:11] but smoteed upon his
[51:13] breast, saying, "God, be merciful to me
[51:17] a
[51:18] sinner." I tell you, this man went down
[51:23] to his house justified rather than the
[51:27] other. For everyone that exaltth himself
[51:29] shall be abased, and he that humble
[51:32] himself shall be
[51:34] exalted." Why? Why, brothers and
[51:37] sisters, was one justified and the other
[51:39] was not. It's because one had pride and
[51:43] the other had humility. God bless you.
[51:46] You can take your
[51:49] seats. Appreciate that testimony from
[51:56] Daniel. The thing that that man
[51:59] had, he has sin in his life. He has
[52:01] failure. His life's been constantly
[52:04] marked with failure after failure after
[52:06] failure. And it's because of the
[52:07] decisions that he made. But the one
[52:09] thing that he had is there's hope for
[52:12] that man. And there's hope because he's
[52:15] willing to humble
[52:17] himself. He's willing to get rid of that
[52:20] pride and say, "I'm a sinner. I've done
[52:23] these things wrong." And it's something,
[52:26] friends, that is so rare and it's
[52:29] becoming more and more rare in the world
[52:31] today.
[52:33] We started on the subject of pride on on
[52:37] Wednesday night and I want to continue
[52:40] on with this subject the I looked up the
[52:45] the meaning of the word and it says this
[52:50] pride is a feeling of deep pleasure or
[52:51] satisfaction derived from one's own
[52:54] achievements the achieve the
[52:56] achievements of those with whom one is
[52:59] closely close closely associated
[53:02] or from the qualities or possessions
[53:04] that are widely admired. Doesn't sound
[53:06] like such a bad word, does it? Doesn't
[53:09] sound like such a bad thing. This thing
[53:11] called
[53:13] pride. When we unfortunately when we
[53:16] today when we think of pride, what's the
[53:18] first thing really that crosses your
[53:21] mind? And it's this gay pride that we
[53:24] see so much. I uh I looked up that and
[53:30] uh found this. It says the term gay
[53:32] pride was claimed to be coined by either
[53:36] by either by Jack Baker and Michael
[53:39] McConnell, an activist couple in
[53:41] Minnesota, or by Tom Higgins, another
[53:44] gay rights activist in Minnesota.
[53:46] Higgins, a former member of the Catholic
[53:49] Church, sought to combat the negative
[53:52] energy emanating from the institution,
[53:54] from the
[53:56] church. Higgins paired one of the seven
[53:59] deadly sins, pride, with gay.
[54:04] And due to the church's stance, because
[54:06] of the church's stance on same-sex
[54:09] behaviors as going against divine and
[54:11] natural
[54:12] laws, that language was transformative.
[54:16] McConnell said, "This approach not only
[54:19] opened doors, but also propelled
[54:21] individuals forward. In 1971, McConnell
[54:25] introduced the term gay pride in
[54:27] Chicago, setting off a powerful
[54:30] movement.
[54:33] We look at this sin of homosexuality and
[54:36] so many modern preachers preach against
[54:38] it and it is it is very much a sin. It's
[54:42] it's very much something that is wrong.
[54:45] But I ask you when with the term gay
[54:47] pride, what is worse? Is it the gay part
[54:51] or is it the pride
[54:53] part? We would probably lean towards the
[54:57] gay pride gay part. But I say no, the
[55:01] worst
[55:03] of the two is the pride
[55:07] part. It's something that it's it's a
[55:11] curse. It could be a curse to a family.
[55:14] It could be a curse to a workplace. And
[55:16] it's it's ultimately it's a curse to
[55:19] yourself. I um when I was a kid, I got a
[55:24] hold of this book. You know, when you're
[55:26] a kid, you get these little picture
[55:27] books and and they have they have
[55:29] stories in there. And uh there is this
[55:32] fairy tale written and it it was
[55:34] published the same time this other fairy
[55:36] tale called the little little mermaid
[55:38] was published. We've all heard of that.
[55:40] But there's this other one that some of
[55:42] you young people may have never heard
[55:43] of. And that is this fairy tale of the
[55:46] emperor with no
[55:48] clothes. We laugh. It's a very funny
[55:51] story. Let me let me tell the story real
[55:54] quick. It's
[55:55] uh I mean it's just a few words. I I
[55:58] downloaded it and it says this. One day,
[56:00] two conmen visit the emperor's capital.
[56:03] Posing as tailor, as clothing makers,
[56:06] they offer to supply the emperor with
[56:09] magnificent clothes that are invisible
[56:13] to those who are incompetent or stupid.
[56:16] Got to remember that part. These clothes
[56:18] are invisible to those that are
[56:22] stupid.
[56:25] Incompetent. The gullible emperor hires
[56:28] them and they set up the looms and they
[56:31] pretend to go to work. And a succession
[56:34] of officials starting with the emperor's
[56:35] wise and competent minister and then
[56:38] ending with the emperor himself visit to
[56:40] check their progress each sees that the
[56:42] looms are empty, but pretends otherwise
[56:46] to avoid being thought a
[56:48] fool. Finally, the weavers report that
[56:51] the emperor's suit is finished.
[56:54] They fake dressing him and and and he
[56:57] sets off a pro procession before the
[56:59] whole
[57:00] city. The town's folk uncomfortably go
[57:04] along with the pretense, not wanting to
[57:07] appear inept or
[57:09] stupid until a child blurts out that the
[57:12] emperor isn't wearing any
[57:15] clothes. The people then realize that
[57:18] they have all been fooled.
[57:20] The emperor is startled but opts to
[57:23] continue in the
[57:26] procession and then it kind of ends
[57:29] right there and I want to see what you
[57:31] know what happened to this emperor but
[57:33] it tells a story that because of his
[57:37] pride that this emperor will eventually
[57:41] be brought down and embarrassed and the
[57:43] biggest problem with someone who has
[57:46] pride is they don't admit that they have
[57:49] pride. pride because they have pride and
[57:53] it goes it just it makes a it makes a
[57:55] big mess of your life because you're not
[57:57] willing to humble yourself. Brother
[57:59] Josiah, he knew my subject this morning
[58:01] when um we were talking in the back. He
[58:04] shared with me a testimony a a a writing
[58:08] from Benjamin Franklin. Benjamin
[58:10] Franklin said this. He says, "I worked
[58:12] my whole life to be as humble as I
[58:17] could. After a while, I realized that I
[58:20] was the most humble person that I
[58:23] knew and then I had to start all over
[58:29] again. So, we see that this thing pride
[58:32] it it is a very very bad thing and it
[58:35] will it will bring you down. Proverbs
[58:37] 11:2 says this, "When pride cometh, then
[58:40] cometh
[58:41] shame, but with the lowly is wisdom."
[58:44] Another translation said when pridees
[58:46] comes then comes
[58:48] disgrace but with the humble is wisdom.
[58:51] Inevitably that prideful person will be
[58:54] brought down. And the biggest as I said
[58:56] the biggest problem with it is if you
[58:58] have pride then then you're not really
[59:00] willing to swallow that pride the more
[59:02] that you have. Daniel in the testimony
[59:05] that he gave
[59:07] earlier that man has something.
[59:11] He's not walking a prideful life. The
[59:14] Lord has his hand on that man. And maybe
[59:16] it took drugs. Maybe it took failure.
[59:19] Maybe it it took divorce. May maybe it
[59:22] took rehab. Maybe it it takes anything
[59:26] that God will h have us humble our pride
[59:29] so that he can deal with us. And we look
[59:32] back at the failures that we have in
[59:34] life and we can say, "Wow, God actually
[59:36] did have his hand on me. God allowed me
[59:40] to make mistakes because of my
[59:43] pride. God allowed me to think that God
[59:47] allowed me to be chastised, to be
[59:50] humbled because he loved me because that
[59:53] was the only way for me to swallow my
[59:57] pride. As I said in in Proverbs, it
[1:00:01] talks many times about pride. The
[1:00:04] amplified version of that of that last
[1:00:06] scripture says, "Everyone who has pride,
[1:00:09] everyone who is
[1:00:10] proud and is and arrogant in heart is
[1:00:14] disgusting and exceedingly offensive to
[1:00:17] the
[1:00:18] Lord." And be assured that it will not
[1:00:20] go
[1:00:21] unpunished. Pride is an
[1:00:24] abomination and disgusting to the Lord.
[1:00:28] You think what is the worst sin, the
[1:00:33] most disgusting sin to us that we can
[1:00:35] think of? We can think maybe lust or
[1:00:38] someone that that is addicted to
[1:00:39] pornography or or someone that that lies
[1:00:43] all the time or someone that that would
[1:00:46] steal out of your purse or out of out of
[1:00:48] your pockets, would come into church and
[1:00:50] steal something. You think, what a what
[1:00:51] a disgusting person. You wouldn't
[1:00:53] wouldn't want to see that person come up
[1:00:55] here and ever address the congregation.
[1:00:57] And you never want to see that person
[1:00:59] come up and pray even in public before
[1:01:01] the
[1:01:02] congregation. But pride, what about that
[1:01:06] pastor or that minister who struggles
[1:01:08] with pride? Oh well, that's okay. You
[1:01:12] know who doesn't struggle with pride?
[1:01:15] Yet God says that that
[1:01:17] that sin of pride is greater than these
[1:01:21] other sins.
[1:01:24] Proverbsapter 6:1 16 says this, "These
[1:01:27] six things that the Lord hate, yay,
[1:01:31] seven are an abomination to him." That
[1:01:33] word abomination, it makes God sick. He
[1:01:35] hates
[1:01:36] it. The seven are an abomination to him.
[1:01:39] What does it start with? Pride. A proud
[1:01:43] look. A lying tongue. Hands that shed
[1:01:46] innocent blood. A heart that devises
[1:01:47] wicked imaginations. Feet that be swift
[1:01:50] to running to mischief. A false witness
[1:01:52] that speaks lies and he that sews
[1:01:54] discord discord among brethren. A liar.
[1:01:57] A murderer. A heart that devises wicked
[1:02:01] plans. Feet that are quick to run to
[1:02:04] evil. A false witness that breathed out
[1:02:07] lies. One who sows discord in the family
[1:02:12] or in the community or in the church.
[1:02:14] But the first in that list is
[1:02:18] pride. Why? Because pride can be and it
[1:02:22] is such a barrier between us and
[1:02:25] God. You can't tell me what to do. I
[1:02:27] have my own relationship with God. I
[1:02:29] don't need your church. I don't need I
[1:02:31] don't need to go. I I know. But but what
[1:02:33] it is is it's pride keeping us from the
[1:02:37] Lord. The seven deadly sins. We've all
[1:02:38] heard the seven deadly sins. What
[1:02:41] they're not in one scripture in the
[1:02:42] Bible. what they are as scholars
[1:02:43] throughout the ages have studied this
[1:02:46] Bible and come out with these are the
[1:02:47] seven big
[1:02:50] sins in the whole Bible. Number two is
[1:02:53] greed. Number three is wrath, hatred.
[1:02:57] Number four is
[1:02:58] envy. Number five is
[1:03:01] lust. Six is gluttony. Seven is
[1:03:04] slothfulness. But number one, number one
[1:03:08] on the list is pride.
[1:03:13] And where does this pride come from? As
[1:03:17] I said, we think of dirty, disgusting
[1:03:19] sins. And they are
[1:03:22] sins. But this pride is so common with
[1:03:25] us. And and so many of us struggle with
[1:03:27] it. We all, let me tell you this, we all
[1:03:29] struggle with it to a certain extent.
[1:03:31] All of us do. But this is the greatest.
[1:03:35] This is the big one. So where does it
[1:03:37] come from? What is this terrible sin
[1:03:40] that is so common that we just say, "Oh,
[1:03:43] well, he might struggle with pride, but
[1:03:45] at least he doesn't struggle with this
[1:03:46] sin or that sin or this one. That would
[1:03:48] kick him out of the pulpit, but he's
[1:03:50] okay being being prideful." When God
[1:03:53] says, "I hate it." God says, "It makes
[1:03:55] me sick. It disgusts me." Where does
[1:03:58] this come
[1:03:59] from? It comes from the enemy.
[1:04:03] It comes from Lucifer
[1:04:06] himself. Isaiah chapter
[1:04:09] 14 verse number 12. Listen to
[1:04:15] this. God is talking to the devil
[1:04:19] here. How art thou fallen from heaven,
[1:04:22] oh
[1:04:23] Lucifer, son of the morning? How art
[1:04:26] thou cut down to the ground? Which did
[1:04:29] we did weaken the nations? How can you
[1:04:33] weaken a
[1:04:34] nation? How can you weaken a family? How
[1:04:37] can you weaken a church? How can you
[1:04:38] weaken someone's walk with the Lord? How
[1:04:42] can you weaken someone's
[1:04:45] faith? How can you weaken a relationship
[1:04:47] between you and your
[1:04:49] spouse? How can you weaken a
[1:04:51] relationship between you and your
[1:04:52] family, you and your brothers and your
[1:04:54] sisters? How can you weaken those
[1:04:55] things? When a spirit influences a
[1:04:58] person, that spirit makes that person
[1:05:01] act like the
[1:05:03] spirit. Act like the demon. And here's
[1:05:06] the big one, Lucifer. He's the big
[1:05:09] guy. That demon influences that person
[1:05:12] to mimic himself. That's what he
[1:05:15] wants. Lucifer is influencing the the
[1:05:19] people, the world to act like him. The
[1:05:21] Holy Spirit
[1:05:24] influences the people to act like
[1:05:26] Christ. Humble, loving, willing to
[1:05:29] sacrifice, willing to make a stand for
[1:05:31] what's right, willing to take the low
[1:05:33] position in a relationship, willing to
[1:05:37] give. God is saying, Lucifer, you weaken
[1:05:41] the nations. And how does he weaken the
[1:05:44] people? How does he weaken a
[1:05:46] relationship between a husband and a
[1:05:47] wife? Pride.
[1:05:50] It was pride that prevented Cain from
[1:05:52] receiving the blessings of God in the
[1:05:54] Garden of Eden. It was pride that
[1:05:57] destroyed Nebuchadnezzar in the book of
[1:05:58] Daniel. It was pride that constantly
[1:06:01] produced failure in King Saul. It was
[1:06:03] pride that caused almost every king of
[1:06:06] Israel to
[1:06:08] fail. It was pride that caused Lucifer
[1:06:12] to be cast out of heaven.
[1:06:14] It was pride that prevented the
[1:06:16] Pharisees and the Sadducees from
[1:06:18] accepting Jesus Christ. It's pride that
[1:06:21] destroys
[1:06:22] relationships. It's pride that ruins
[1:06:24] careers. It's pride that destroys
[1:06:29] churches. It's pride that prevents an
[1:06:32] understanding of the
[1:06:35] scriptures. That is one that is so
[1:06:38] subtle. I know. This is how I believe.
[1:06:42] It's pride that prevents a walk with
[1:06:44] God. It prevents an
[1:06:47] understanding. How can you prevent a
[1:06:50] walk with God? It prevents you from
[1:06:52] understanding the scriptures that God
[1:06:54] has for you. I have to have it this way,
[1:06:56] God. That is the way. That's the way I
[1:06:58] learned. This is this is how I was
[1:06:59] taught. This is what's right. If Lord,
[1:07:01] if you don't come this way, I'm not
[1:07:03] going to accept you.
[1:07:05] Pride. You got to come through my way of
[1:07:09] thinking. Pride. and it destroys people
[1:07:13] and it sends people to hell. It's
[1:07:15] inspired by Lucifer
[1:07:17] himself. Second Timothy, let's pause
[1:07:21] right there and let's go to second
[1:07:22] Timothy chapter
[1:07:23] 4. This is the Apostle Paul instructing
[1:07:26] his protege
[1:07:29] Timothy. He says, "I charge thee before
[1:07:32] therefore before God and the Lord Jesus
[1:07:35] Christ who shall judge the quick and the
[1:07:37] dead at his appearing in his kingdom.
[1:07:40] Preach the
[1:07:41] word. Be instant in season, out of
[1:07:43] season. Repro, reprove, rebuke, exhort
[1:07:47] with all long suffering and doctrine. So
[1:07:51] he's saying, Timothy, preach this word.
[1:07:55] Correct the
[1:07:57] people. Tell them what is right. And all
[1:08:01] of us, all of us know there's people
[1:08:02] that are too good to go to church.
[1:08:05] They're too good to be here. They're too
[1:08:07] good to be here because maybe they don't
[1:08:10] want to be corrected. There's too much
[1:08:14] pride. They're too good because maybe
[1:08:17] they have something better and they
[1:08:19] create this this this weird world in
[1:08:22] their mind that I am too good for this
[1:08:26] group of people. Well, they judge
[1:08:29] me. When in fact, they're really not
[1:08:31] judging you. That is the devil trying to
[1:08:33] keep you away from church is what it
[1:08:38] is. What keeps people away from church?
[1:08:42] I know it's laziness, but it's pride
[1:08:46] more. Reprove, rebuke, exhort with all
[1:08:50] longsuffering and doctrine. For the time
[1:08:52] will come when they will not endure
[1:08:53] sound doctrine. Listen to this. They
[1:08:55] will not endure sound doctrine, but
[1:08:57] after their own lusts, at their own
[1:09:01] desires, they shall heap to themselves
[1:09:06] teachers having itching
[1:09:08] ears, and they shall turn away their
[1:09:11] ears from the truth, and shall be turned
[1:09:14] to
[1:09:16] fables. It's the pride of people. As I
[1:09:19] said, they don't want to be corrected.
[1:09:21] So what they do is they they choose a
[1:09:24] pastor or they choose a teacher that is
[1:09:28] willing to correct someone else and to
[1:09:31] preach their doctrine that they want to
[1:09:33] be
[1:09:34] preached because it matches their
[1:09:37] pride. It matches their doctrine and
[1:09:40] they're not worried. They're not willing
[1:09:41] to humble
[1:09:42] themselves. A prideful person is the
[1:09:46] most difficult person to preach the
[1:09:48] gospel to. Number one most difficult
[1:09:52] person to get through is a prideful
[1:09:54] religious
[1:09:57] person. Pride produces really strong
[1:10:01] religious spirits that are adverse to
[1:10:04] any type of correction and they're
[1:10:06] always correcting and looking down on
[1:10:08] someone else, but they are not world
[1:10:11] they are not they would never think that
[1:10:13] wow they could be wrong. They shall heap
[1:10:16] for themselves is what what um Paul
[1:10:19] said. They shall heap for themselves.
[1:10:22] They are the ones that put this minister
[1:10:24] up there because he preaches the way
[1:10:26] that they want. And then that minister
[1:10:29] is
[1:10:30] controlled. I'm not saying always, not
[1:10:34] me, but I hope. I pray not me. But it is
[1:10:39] a warning
[1:10:40] here. This minister is controlled by the
[1:10:43] congregation.
[1:10:45] And he preaches those things that they
[1:10:47] want to hear instead of how God is
[1:10:49] leading
[1:10:52] him. They shall turn. And then what
[1:10:54] happens? What happens when this is the
[1:10:57] case in a church or a group of people?
[1:11:01] Then they shall turn away their ears
[1:11:03] from the truth.
[1:11:05] right
[1:11:07] here. They shall turn away their their
[1:11:10] ears from the truth and they shall turn
[1:11:12] to fables, things that really aren't
[1:11:15] true, things that are just made
[1:11:19] up because they shall heap for
[1:11:21] themselves teachers because they don't
[1:11:22] want to receive the correction. They
[1:11:25] want the doctrine to be preached. They
[1:11:28] want the narrative to be preached. And
[1:11:31] when they do
[1:11:32] that, as I said, as I asked the
[1:11:35] question, how could pride keep you from
[1:11:39] understanding the
[1:11:41] word? Well, it keeps you from
[1:11:42] understanding the word because you want
[1:11:44] your doctrine. I want my doctrine. All
[1:11:48] of us. Back to Isaiah 14 verse 12. How
[1:11:52] art thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer,
[1:11:54] son of the morning? How art thou cut
[1:11:56] down to the ground which did weakestake
[1:11:59] the nations? How does he weaken the
[1:12:00] nations? Through pride. Now listen to
[1:12:02] this. Here's here's what it is. For thou
[1:12:05] hast said in thy heart, I will ascend
[1:12:10] into heaven. I will exalt my throne
[1:12:14] above the stars of God. I will sit also
[1:12:17] upon the mount of the congregation in
[1:12:19] the sides of the north north. Notice
[1:12:21] that Lucifer is saying he's saying it in
[1:12:24] his heart. He's not even saying it
[1:12:25] outwardly.
[1:12:27] He's saying inside of him that I am
[1:12:31] right. It was his
[1:12:33] desire. And God weighs the desires of of
[1:12:37] the
[1:12:38] person. Proverbs 21 says, "Every every
[1:12:42] way of a man is right in his own
[1:12:45] eyes. But the Lord ponderth the hearts."
[1:12:49] English standard version of that says,
[1:12:51] "Every way of a man is right in his own
[1:12:55] eyes, but the Lord weighs the
[1:12:58] heart." So if you're
[1:13:00] wrong, the Lord weighs your
[1:13:03] heart. He can see all the way to your
[1:13:06] inner desires. Can you imagine going
[1:13:08] onto your
[1:13:09] knees and saying,
[1:13:11] "Lord, I genuinely, Lord, I just want
[1:13:14] your will. I just want to be what you
[1:13:17] want me to be. I just want to know
[1:13:18] what's right, Lord. I want to set aside
[1:13:21] everything that's in me. And then you go
[1:13:23] and make a mistake. And you get on on
[1:13:25] your knees and say, "Lord, I made a
[1:13:27] mistake, but search my heart. You know,
[1:13:30] you know, I was
[1:13:32] sincere. You know, I just I got myself
[1:13:34] in the way. I didn't I didn't want to do
[1:13:36] that. Lord, you know my heart." Can you
[1:13:39] imagine if you could truly go to the
[1:13:41] Lord that way? Imagine if you could
[1:13:43] truly get on your knees and then all of
[1:13:47] the sin that's there, all of the filth
[1:13:51] that's in your life, all of the
[1:13:52] everything that you've done that's
[1:13:54] wrong, here is Jesus, and he
[1:13:58] weighs not your sin, but he weighs your
[1:14:03] heart. He weighs the desire of your
[1:14:06] heart. And this
[1:14:08] Pharisee that I talked about when I read
[1:14:11] the parable, the desire of his heart was
[1:14:13] pride. He wanted to be right. This
[1:14:16] publican was a sinner. He had done
[1:14:18] wrong. He had lived his whole life as a
[1:14:19] sinful sinful person. This Pharisee
[1:14:22] probably never done anything wrong in
[1:14:23] his
[1:14:24] life. He was always always living right.
[1:14:27] And he says, "I always pay my tithe and
[1:14:28] I always do everything. Lord, I'm so
[1:14:30] glad I'm not like this sinner." And then
[1:14:32] God weighs the heart.
[1:14:35] He says, "The
[1:14:36] Pharisee is the one that God didn't hear
[1:14:39] and the sinner is the one that God did
[1:14:43] hear." Adam and I were talking last
[1:14:46] night and uh he was telling me a story
[1:14:49] about a uh a college girl on the campus.
[1:14:51] There's this guy named Charlie Kirk.
[1:14:52] He's one of the you know, he's like a
[1:14:54] influencer uh type podcast guy. And uh
[1:14:58] he was debating with this girl on the
[1:15:01] subject of
[1:15:02] abortion. And this girl came, this girl
[1:15:06] had the excuse for abortion. Charlie
[1:15:09] Kirk was like, "Listen, this is a life."
[1:15:11] And this girl says, she says, "Do you
[1:15:14] want me to drop out of school? Do you
[1:15:17] want me to ruin my career for this baby?
[1:15:20] Do you want me to ruin all my
[1:15:21] scholarships? Do you want me to ruin my
[1:15:24] life and to have this
[1:15:26] child?" Whoa, look at this influence of
[1:15:29] Lucifer here. me, I will exalt myself
[1:15:33] even if it causes the destruction of
[1:15:35] someone else. It's all about
[1:15:39] me. Verse number 15 and
[1:15:43] 13 speaking to
[1:15:45] Lucifer again he said, "For you have
[1:15:49] said in your heart, I will ascend into
[1:15:53] heaven. I will exalt my throne above the
[1:15:56] stars of God. I will sit upon the mount
[1:15:58] of the congregation in the sides of the
[1:16:00] north. I will ascend above the heights
[1:16:03] of the clouds. I will be like the most
[1:16:08] high. I I I I Man, it's like he's the
[1:16:11] CEO of Apple, iPhone, iPod,
[1:16:15] iPad, iOS, I I I I everything's about me
[1:16:20] today. Notice, but notice he's not
[1:16:23] saying that he wants to be God. He's not
[1:16:25] going that far. He's like, I want to be
[1:16:27] like God.
[1:16:30] There is only one God, brothers and
[1:16:33] sisters, and it's not us. He is the one
[1:16:35] we worship. He is sovereign. He does
[1:16:38] things the way he he does things and he
[1:16:40] does not have to conform to our way of
[1:16:42] thinking. He has his own way of thinking
[1:16:45] and we conform to his way of thinking.
[1:16:49] Genesis chapter 4, Cain and Abel. What a
[1:16:53] story. These two children, the first
[1:16:56] children that were ever born in the
[1:16:59] world, Cain and Abel, watch the
[1:17:03] difference. Watch how Lucifer's spirit
[1:17:05] of pride comes even back then at the
[1:17:09] very beginning. Genesis 4:1. Thank you.
[1:17:13] And Adam knew his wife, knew Eve his
[1:17:16] wife, and she conceived and bare
[1:17:19] Cain, and said, Eve said, I have gotten
[1:17:23] a man from the Lord. And she again bare
[1:17:26] his his brother Abel. And Abel was a
[1:17:28] keeper of the sheep, but Cain was a
[1:17:30] tiller of the ground. And in process of
[1:17:33] time, it came to pass that Cain brought
[1:17:35] of the fruit of the ground an offering
[1:17:37] unto the Lord. and Abel he also brought
[1:17:40] of the firstlings of his flock and of
[1:17:42] the fat thereof and the Lord had respect
[1:17:45] to Abel and his
[1:17:46] offering. NIV says and the Lord took the
[1:17:49] Lord looked with favor on Abel and his
[1:17:53] offering but unto Cain and to his
[1:17:56] offering he had not
[1:17:58] respect and Cain was very wroth very
[1:18:02] angry and his countenance fell.
[1:18:05] Amplified version so says so Cain became
[1:18:09] extremely angry and he took and he
[1:18:12] looked annoyed and hostile. It was
[1:18:14] written all over his
[1:18:16] face. Cain could not contain his
[1:18:19] emotions. It was written as I said all
[1:18:21] through his body language and
[1:18:23] everything. You can imagine how this
[1:18:26] Cain felt. Put yourself in the place of
[1:18:28] these two these two young men.
[1:18:32] Cain was saying, "Look at how hard I
[1:18:36] worked. Look at the altar that I built.
[1:18:39] Look at all of these flowers and all of
[1:18:41] this offering. We came from the Garden
[1:18:43] of Eden, didn't we? Look at my altar.
[1:18:45] Doesn't it resemble back to this garden
[1:18:47] that we came
[1:18:48] from? Look at this. Look at these
[1:18:50] beautiful flowers. And look at this
[1:18:52] fruit. Look at how nice this look looks.
[1:18:55] Now look at my brother Abel's.
[1:18:58] It's a pile of rocks and a dead
[1:19:04] animal. Look at him. Look at
[1:19:08] me. I deserve it. I've worked
[1:19:14] harder. Same thing with more work or
[1:19:17] school or whatever it is. Listen, I have
[1:19:20] been here longer. I deserve this. This
[1:19:23] is this is what something that that is
[1:19:25] owed to me. That was able or Cain's
[1:19:29] thoughts. I was able Cain's way. That's
[1:19:31] the pride that was in
[1:19:33] Cain. I'm not going to lower myself to
[1:19:37] that. And the Lord said unto Cain, why
[1:19:41] are you
[1:19:42] wroth? And why is thy countenance
[1:19:45] fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou
[1:19:48] not be
[1:19:50] accepted? And if thou doest not well,
[1:19:53] sin lith at the door. Sin is crouching
[1:19:58] at the
[1:19:59] door and unto thee shall be his desire,
[1:20:03] sin's
[1:20:05] desire, and thou shalt and thou shalt
[1:20:08] rule over him. So So what he's saying is
[1:20:10] God is warning Cain about his pride. And
[1:20:12] he's saying, why are you why are you
[1:20:14] upset that your gift isn't accepted? If
[1:20:17] you bring the right gift, the one that
[1:20:18] shows the sacrifice that I started in
[1:20:21] the Garden of Eden when I killed this
[1:20:25] animal to cover up the nakedness of of
[1:20:27] Adam and
[1:20:28] Eve, if you'll do like the word says, if
[1:20:31] you do like what is right, rather than
[1:20:33] getting this own image in your mind,
[1:20:35] this old this this whole flowery thing,
[1:20:37] and this this is going to be the the
[1:20:39] better thing if we do it this way, if
[1:20:41] you will just do it the right way, the
[1:20:43] way that I
[1:20:44] say, then you'll do
[1:20:47] Well, but God's saying that I
[1:20:51] know, Cain, that this pride is welling
[1:20:55] up in
[1:20:56] you, but you can overcome it,
[1:21:00] Cain. He said, "You'll do
[1:21:03] well. You can overcome it and you can
[1:21:06] rule over this
[1:21:09] pride." Cain didn't listen to God.
[1:21:12] the pride of his
[1:21:15] altar was not
[1:21:17] accepted and his brothers over here that
[1:21:20] just didn't seem right to him. It was
[1:21:23] accepted. So he said, remember God says,
[1:21:26] he says that if he says sin is crouching
[1:21:29] at the door. It's just waiting for you,
[1:21:33] Cain. You can have rule over it. You can
[1:21:36] overcome it. But this pride that's in
[1:21:39] you, Cain, here is Lucifer, as I read
[1:21:42] before, and he's right there, and he
[1:21:44] wants to influence you, but don't fall
[1:21:47] for it,
[1:21:49] Cain. But he fell for it. And Cain
[1:21:53] talked with his Abel, his
[1:21:55] brother. And it came to pass when they
[1:21:57] were in the field that Cain rose up
[1:22:00] against Abel, his brother, and he killed
[1:22:03] him. Murdered him because of his pride.
[1:22:09] Look at what pride
[1:22:11] produces. It's a gateway to so many
[1:22:14] sins. Back to Luke
[1:22:19] 18. This the parable Luke 18:10. Two men
[1:22:22] went up to the temple to pray. The one a
[1:22:25] Pharisee and the other a publican. The
[1:22:27] Pharisees stood and prayed thus with
[1:22:29] himself. God, I thank thee that I'm not
[1:22:32] as the other men are, extortioners and
[1:22:34] unjust and adulterers, or even as this
[1:22:37] publican. I fast twice in a week. I give
[1:22:40] tithes of all that I that that I
[1:22:43] possess. Look at all that I do,
[1:22:47] God. Look at my flowery altar. Look at
[1:22:50] all that I do for you. Look at all that
[1:22:53] I do for everyone else. Look at who I
[1:22:55] am. And the publican standing a far off,
[1:22:59] similar to the guy Daniel was talking
[1:23:01] about earlier. And the publican standing
[1:23:03] a far off would not even lift so much
[1:23:06] his eyes into heaven. He was he was
[1:23:08] ashamed of
[1:23:09] himself. He was sad that he had become
[1:23:12] such a
[1:23:13] sinner. And he smote his chest. He
[1:23:16] smacked himself on the chest and saying,
[1:23:18] "God, be merciful to me a sinner." And
[1:23:22] Jesus says, "I tell you that this man
[1:23:26] who was the
[1:23:27] sinner, he went back to his house
[1:23:30] justified." He may have thought that he
[1:23:32] is so much lower than this than this
[1:23:34] Pharisee. He might have thought that he
[1:23:36] is so much lower than this preacher
[1:23:38] because all that he had in his in his
[1:23:40] life and all the sin that he had there.
[1:23:42] But this man went to his house
[1:23:45] justified rather than the other one. The
[1:23:48] other one had
[1:23:49] pride. For everyone that exalts
[1:23:53] himself shall be abased, shall be
[1:23:55] brought down. And he that humbles
[1:23:58] himself shall be
[1:24:01] exalted. Pride comes from
[1:24:06] Satan. David, King David, brother Lyall
[1:24:10] is going to start on a series on this
[1:24:12] man. David, king, second king of
[1:24:17] Israel, line in the line of Judah, the
[1:24:21] the lineage of of
[1:24:23] Jesus. Great man, a man that was full of
[1:24:27] mistakes, full of problems. But this
[1:24:31] man, the Bible says, David was a man
[1:24:34] after God's own
[1:24:35] heart. Why? How could David with all of
[1:24:39] the sins of I mean, you name it, David
[1:24:43] did it. How could this man be a man
[1:24:46] after God's own heart? Because he
[1:24:48] humbled
[1:24:50] himself. How much more important is
[1:24:53] humbling ourselves than sinning in the
[1:24:56] first
[1:24:57] place? So,
[1:24:59] David, Saul
[1:25:01] had gotten jealous. The pride welled up
[1:25:04] in King Saul.
[1:25:06] He got jealous. He tried to kill David
[1:25:09] twice with a javelin, with a spear,
[1:25:11] tried to hit him. David would dodge and
[1:25:14] take off. Finally, David takes off and
[1:25:16] he goes out into the wilderness and he
[1:25:18] he's got his his loyal men with him. And
[1:25:20] here is Saul and Saul's after David. He
[1:25:23] Saul hated David because how could God
[1:25:27] favor David over me? I am the righteous
[1:25:30] king of Israel. So, here is David and
[1:25:33] he's out running
[1:25:35] away. They hide up in a
[1:25:39] cave. They're in the dark. Here comes
[1:25:41] Saul and his
[1:25:42] men. David's back in the back and he's
[1:25:46] probably kneeling down in the shadows.
[1:25:49] And here comes Saul by
[1:25:52] himself into the
[1:25:56] cave. David sees him coming.
[1:26:01] David's men like, "Let me take him
[1:26:05] out." David, this is your enemy. He was
[1:26:08] like,
[1:26:09] "No." David sneaks up there as Saul is
[1:26:13] there and he cuts
[1:26:14] off a piece of Saul's robe, goes back
[1:26:18] into the
[1:26:19] shadows. Saul walks out of the
[1:26:26] cave. I'll tell the story. 1 Samuel
[1:26:29] chapter
[1:26:31] 21, 1st Samuel chapter 24, excuse me.
[1:26:36] And it came to pass when Saul was
[1:26:38] returned from following the Philistines
[1:26:40] that it was told to him, "Behold, David
[1:26:42] is in the wilderness of Engeti. And Saul
[1:26:45] took 3,000 chosen men out of is Israel,
[1:26:48] and went to seek David and his men upon
[1:26:50] the rocks of the wild goats. And he came
[1:26:53] to the sheep coats, by the way, and
[1:26:54] there was a cave. And when Saul went in
[1:26:57] to cover his feet, that David and his
[1:26:59] men remained in the insides of the in
[1:27:01] the sides of the cave. And the men of
[1:27:04] David said unto him, "Behold the day of
[1:27:07] which the Lord said unto thee." David,
[1:27:10] God promised you the
[1:27:12] kingdom. Behold, I will deliver thine
[1:27:14] enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest
[1:27:17] do to him as it shall be seem good to
[1:27:19] thee. David, God promised you this. Then
[1:27:23] David arose and cut off the skirt of
[1:27:25] Saul's robe privile. And it came to pass
[1:27:29] afterwards that David's heart smoteed
[1:27:32] him because he had cut off Saul's
[1:27:35] skirt. What a spirit that is in this man
[1:27:40] David. He
[1:27:42] repented. He said, "Oh, he was there."
[1:27:44] And his buddies are like, "Kill
[1:27:47] him. This is you take and you take the
[1:27:50] kingdom." David, a man after God's own
[1:27:52] heart, says, "No." And he cuts off the
[1:27:55] the the robe and he sneaks back in and
[1:27:58] he could have what he should have said,
[1:27:59] what we would have says, "I could have
[1:28:00] killed you, Saul." But no, it was like,
[1:28:04] "Man, I shouldn't have." He was the
[1:28:06] king. He's the king. I shouldn't have
[1:28:08] cut off a piece. David repented because
[1:28:12] Saul David knew that Saul was placed
[1:28:15] there by God.
[1:28:17] God had promised through the prophet
[1:28:20] Samuel many years earlier that David was
[1:28:24] going to be
[1:28:26] king. And David knew that and his his
[1:28:30] soldiers knew that. And yet look at the
[1:28:34] humility. There wasn't pride in David.
[1:28:37] Look at the humility there.
[1:28:40] And he said unto his
[1:28:44] men, verse six, the Lord forbid that I
[1:28:47] should do this thing unto my master, the
[1:28:50] Lord's anointed, to stretch forth my
[1:28:52] hand against him, seeing he is the
[1:28:54] anointed of the Lord. So David stayed
[1:28:56] his servants with these words, and
[1:28:57] suffered them not to rise against Saul.
[1:28:59] But Saul rose up out of the cave and
[1:29:01] went his way. So David also arose
[1:29:03] afterwards and went out of the cave and
[1:29:06] cried after Saul. So Saul walked out.
[1:29:08] David walks out of the cave and said,
[1:29:10] "Saul, my lord, the
[1:29:13] king." And when Saul looked behind him,
[1:29:16] David stooped with his face to the earth
[1:29:18] and he bowed
[1:29:21] himself, showed respect to this
[1:29:25] prideful, narcissistic
[1:29:28] king. And David said to Saul, "Wherefore
[1:29:32] hearest thou men's words, saying,
[1:29:35] Behold, David seeketh thy hurt." He's
[1:29:37] saying, "Listen, you've heard all of
[1:29:39] these people, Saul. You've heard
[1:29:41] everybody telling you that I'm against
[1:29:43] you, that I want to destroy you, Saul.
[1:29:45] That's not
[1:29:48] true. Behold this. Thine eyes have seen
[1:29:54] how the Lord had delivered thee
[1:29:58] today into mine hand in the cave. And
[1:30:02] some told me to kill you,
[1:30:06] Saul, but mine eyes but mine eyes spared
[1:30:10] thee. And I said, I will not put forth
[1:30:13] my hand against my Lord, my ruler, for
[1:30:16] he is the Lord's
[1:30:18] anointed. Now he holds up a piece of
[1:30:24] cloth. He says, he holds up a piece of
[1:30:27] cloth of a piece of Saul's robe. And he
[1:30:30] says, "Moreover, my
[1:30:31] father, see, moreover, Saul, my leader,
[1:30:35] see, see the skirt of your robe in my
[1:30:38] hand. For in that I cut off the skirt of
[1:30:40] thy robe, and I killed thee not. know
[1:30:43] thou and see that there is neither evil
[1:30:45] nor transgression in my
[1:30:48] hand and I have not sinned against
[1:30:51] thee yet thou hest my soul to take it
[1:30:55] see Saul I'm not against you I don't
[1:30:57] have bad intentions remember this whole
[1:31:00] time that he's kneeling he's kneeling
[1:31:01] down there before
[1:31:02] Saul David didn't say at that point
[1:31:05] David didn't say Saul the prophet Samuel
[1:31:09] said I was going to be
[1:31:10] king he didn't say twice You tried to
[1:31:13] kill me with the
[1:31:15] spear. He didn't say, "Saul, the kingdom
[1:31:19] likes me better than they do
[1:31:21] you." He was submissive and
[1:31:25] kind. Imagine, friends, if we could
[1:31:27] handle our arguments like David handled
[1:31:30] that one. Imagine if we could handle the
[1:31:33] arguments with our spouses as David
[1:31:35] handled that one. If we could be
[1:31:38] submissive and
[1:31:40] humble when we get in an argument with a
[1:31:42] wife or a husband, brother or
[1:31:45] sister, imagine if if we would be
[1:31:48] submissive then do you think that they
[1:31:51] would continue beating you over the
[1:31:52] head? Probably not.
[1:31:56] And that's not what this narcissistic
[1:31:58] man who's, I promise you, he's probably
[1:32:00] a lot worse than your
[1:32:05] wife. Worse than your wife,
[1:32:10] Saul. That's not how Saul responded when
[1:32:13] David presented love to Saul. Verse
[1:32:16] number 16, let's skip down there. And it
[1:32:19] came to pass when David had had made an
[1:32:21] end to speaking these words unto Saul
[1:32:23] that Saul said, "Is this thy voice, my
[1:32:26] son David?" And Saul lifted up his voice
[1:32:29] and
[1:32:31] wept. And he said to David, "Thou art
[1:32:34] more righteous than
[1:32:36] I, for thou hast rewarded me good,
[1:32:39] whereas I have rewarded thee evil. I've
[1:32:41] done wrong to you, Saul, and you've done
[1:32:43] nothing but be sweet to me, be kind to
[1:32:45] me.
[1:32:50] And thou has showed this day how that
[1:32:52] thou hast dealt well with me. For as
[1:32:53] much as when the Lord had delivered me
[1:32:55] into thine hand, thou klest killst me
[1:32:57] not. For if a man find his enemy, will
[1:33:00] he let him go well away whereof the Lord
[1:33:04] reward thee good for that thou hast done
[1:33:08] unto me this day. Lord reward you reward
[1:33:11] you for being kind to me when I was mean
[1:33:14] to you.
[1:33:17] And
[1:33:18] behold, I know well that thou shalt
[1:33:20] surely be king. Saul's the one that
[1:33:23] brought it up, not
[1:33:25] David. I know well that thou shalt
[1:33:27] surely be king, and that the kingdom of
[1:33:30] Israel shall be established into thy
[1:33:32] hands. Swear now, therefore, unto me by
[1:33:34] the Lord, that thou will not cut off my
[1:33:36] seed after me, and thou will not destroy
[1:33:38] my name out of my father's house." And
[1:33:41] David swear unto Saul, and Saul went
[1:33:43] home. But David and his men got them up
[1:33:47] into the hold. Notice, even after Saul
[1:33:51] left, David knew that even after he
[1:33:54] humbled himself, David knew, "Don't
[1:33:57] return back to that city because that
[1:33:58] spirit of Lucifer is going to come back.
[1:34:01] That spirit's going to come back on him
[1:34:02] and he's going to hate you again." And
[1:34:04] he did. David knew that the sin of pride
[1:34:07] would be crouching at Saul's door. So,
[1:34:10] he quietly just went back to his place
[1:34:12] up in the rocks. not in a nice home
[1:34:15] where he could defend his men and then
[1:34:17] he went about his business. Same thing
[1:34:20] happens two chapters later in first in
[1:34:23] 1st Samuel 6. Samuel 20 Samuel
[1:34:28] 26.
[1:34:31] Philippians
[1:34:35] 2:9 says
[1:34:39] this. Philippians chapter 2 verse 5.
[1:34:41] Thank you. Let this mind be in you which
[1:34:44] was also in Christ. who being in the
[1:34:47] form of
[1:34:48] God, thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:34:51] with
[1:34:52] God. Now look at the difference. Now
[1:34:55] Lucifer wanted to be equal with God. But
[1:34:58] now here comes the son of God. Now watch
[1:35:02] what he does. Lucifer lifts him up.
[1:35:04] Says, I will exalt myself above all the
[1:35:06] all the the people of God. I will be
[1:35:08] this. Now watch what Jesus does. He
[1:35:10] thought not robbery to be equal with
[1:35:12] God, but made himself of no reputation.
[1:35:16] and took upon him the form of a
[1:35:19] servant and was made in the likeness of
[1:35:22] men. And being found in fashion as a
[1:35:24] man, he humbled
[1:35:27] himself. Talking about
[1:35:29] Jesus. Lucifer didn't humble himself,
[1:35:33] but Jesus humbled himself. Listen to
[1:35:36] this example.
[1:35:40] If we are Christians, we should humble
[1:35:42] ourselves with each
[1:35:44] other between
[1:35:47] churches, between families. We humble
[1:35:50] ourselves if we have the spirit of
[1:35:52] Christ. We don't exalt ourselves. He
[1:35:55] humbled himself and became obedient to
[1:35:59] death, even the death of the cross.
[1:36:02] Wherefore God ha also hath highly
[1:36:04] exalted him and given him a name which
[1:36:06] is above every name. Obedient to the
[1:36:09] cross. How many of us are able to set
[1:36:12] aside our pride and be obedient to
[1:36:14] humility like Jesus Christ
[1:36:17] was in all parts of our lives? How many
[1:36:20] of us can live our lives knowing that
[1:36:22] the sin of pride is crouching at the
[1:36:27] door? David saw that he was nothing. And
[1:36:31] David saw every good that every good
[1:36:33] thing about him was a gift from God.
[1:36:36] Read the book of Psalms. It's full of
[1:36:39] it. How how David is lifting up God for
[1:36:42] every good thing that happens. David
[1:36:45] failed over and over and over. But the
[1:36:48] Bible says that he was a man after God's
[1:36:53] own
[1:36:54] heart. How could a man that failed so
[1:36:57] many times have the heart of God? He
[1:36:58] humbled himself when he cut off of
[1:37:01] Saul's robe. He humbled himself later as
[1:37:03] I said in the in two chapters later when
[1:37:06] he stole Saul's spear when he was
[1:37:08] sleeping. He humbled himself when he
[1:37:09] committed adultery with his friend's
[1:37:13] wife. He comm he humbled himself when he
[1:37:16] had his friend
[1:37:18] murdered. He humbled himself through his
[1:37:20] entire life. And that is why he had a
[1:37:23] heart like God's heart.
[1:37:26] I don't think anyone here has done as
[1:37:27] bad as David has. But even yet, he had a
[1:37:31] man. He was a man after God's own heart.
[1:37:33] The parable of the
[1:37:34] Pharisee. God's heart was not in that
[1:37:38] Pharisee. But God's heart was in that
[1:37:43] publican. Sin is crouching at the door
[1:37:47] with that with that Pharisee. Sin was
[1:37:50] right there. Sin was ready. He was ready
[1:37:53] to come home and have a fight with his
[1:37:55] wife. He was ready to have a fight with
[1:37:58] his kids. He was ready for sin, ready to
[1:38:01] condemn someone else. But the sinner
[1:38:03] publican says, "I'm not worthy to walk
[1:38:05] into church. I'm a sinner." And God
[1:38:09] heard his prayer, but he did not hear
[1:38:11] the prayer of the
[1:38:14] prideful. I got a lot more. Let's let's
[1:38:17] close. If uh the musicians would come
[1:38:23] forward, you know what? Let me just read
[1:38:25] the scriptures. They'll be great. I
[1:38:28] promise. Lot these scriptures are way
[1:38:30] better than anything that I can say.
[1:38:32] Proverbs 11:2 says this, "When pride
[1:38:36] comes, then cometh shame, but with the
[1:38:39] lowly is wisdom."
[1:38:41] Isaiah 2:1 says, "The lofty looks of man
[1:38:45] shall be humbled, and the hottiness of
[1:38:48] men shall be bowed down, and the Lord
[1:38:51] alone shall be exalted in that
[1:38:53] day." Psalm 10 verse4 says this, "The
[1:38:57] wicked through the pride of his
[1:38:59] countenance will not seek after
[1:39:03] God." God is not in all of his thoughts.
[1:39:08] In all of his thoughts. God to be in all
[1:39:10] of our thoughts. And how can God be in
[1:39:12] our thoughts if we have sinful
[1:39:14] thoughts? 1 John chapter 2:16 says, "For
[1:39:18] all that is in the world, the lust of
[1:39:21] the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the
[1:39:25] pride of
[1:39:27] life, is not of the father, but is of
[1:39:31] this world."
[1:39:32] Galatians chapter 6:3 says, "For if a
[1:39:35] man think himself to be something when
[1:39:37] he is nothing, he deceiveth himself."
[1:39:40] That's a big
[1:39:43] one. 1 Peter 5:5, listen to this.
[1:39:47] Likewise, you
[1:39:50] younger, submit yourselves to the
[1:39:53] elder. Yay. and all of you be subject
[1:39:58] one to
[1:40:00] another and be
[1:40:02] clothed clothed with
[1:40:05] humility. God resists the
[1:40:08] proud and gives grace to the
[1:40:13] humble. The last scripture is
[1:40:16] this 2
[1:40:19] Chronicles 7:14.
[1:40:23] If my people which are called by my
[1:40:26] name shall humble
[1:40:29] themselves and pray and seek my
[1:40:33] face and turn from their wicked
[1:40:37] ways, then will I hear from heaven and
[1:40:40] will forgive their sin and will heal
[1:40:43] their
[1:40:44] land. What a promise for humility. What
[1:40:48] a man this man David was. What a man
[1:40:52] Jesus Christ was to say that to put it
[1:40:55] so
[1:40:57] simply that if you would just humble
[1:40:59] yourself and set aside your pride, there
[1:41:02] was never there has never been a fight
[1:41:04] between a husband and wife that did not
[1:41:06] have pride. There has never been a
[1:41:09] church split that was not because of
[1:41:11] pride. There has never be been a
[1:41:15] divorce that did not have pride.
[1:41:21] There has
[1:41:23] never, you can see why. You can see why
[1:41:26] God hates that sin above all
[1:41:30] else. Number
[1:41:32] one in the Proverbs chapter 6 of the
[1:41:35] seven things that God hates. Number one,
[1:41:37] a proud look. He hates it because it
[1:41:40] separates us from him.
[1:41:43] But if we will humble ourselves like
[1:41:45] King David did like this beautiful
[1:41:49] story of this these two people that went
[1:41:53] to pray. I love when God touches a
[1:41:58] repentive heart. There is nothing when I
[1:42:01] stand here and I see someone
[1:42:04] come and I see that
[1:42:07] sincerity. There is nothing to me that
[1:42:11] is greater than that. Zyra, you said the
[1:42:13] other day or you said or Daniel said
[1:42:15] earlier that or no, Josiah said that um
[1:42:19] in the funeral you said it was the best
[1:42:21] thing you ever
[1:42:22] did. I remember
[1:42:25] that. It's
[1:42:28] it's it may seem like a small thing to
[1:42:31] us, but the heavens are rejoicing with
[1:42:35] angels shouting praise when a sinner
[1:42:38] comes and repents and says, "Lord, I am
[1:42:42] wrong. I want to change my life like
[1:42:44] that publican did when he went to the
[1:42:47] altar." He says, "I'm not even worried
[1:42:48] worthy to go into church. Lord, forgive
[1:42:51] me a sinner."
[1:42:54] That's when heavens rejoice. And when
[1:42:57] the preacher, when the priest, when the
[1:43:00] Pharisee comes and says, "Look how great
[1:43:03] I am. I'm better than all these other
[1:43:05] people because I've never done anything
[1:43:06] wrong. You shouldn't do anything
[1:43:08] wrong." Paul said, "Do I do I sin that
[1:43:11] grace may prevail?" He said, "God
[1:43:14] forbid. We don't sin. We try not to
[1:43:19] sin, but that
[1:43:21] repentant sinner, God loves
[1:43:25] it. He loved that prayer of that
[1:43:29] publican. And he hated, he
[1:43:31] despised the prayer of the
[1:43:36] Pharisee. Two things that are just the
[1:43:38] opposite of the way that we think of.
[1:43:41] But the blessed words of our Lord Jesus
[1:43:44] through these simple stories give us
[1:43:47] that understanding that we need so
[1:43:50] dearly. Amen. Brother Josiah, where are
[1:43:53] you?
[1:43:55] First things first,
[1:43:58] Jeremy, this
[1:44:00] song, Brother Josiah is about to
[1:44:05] sing. It's a it's a modern song. It's
[1:44:07] not a congregational
[1:44:09] song, but the first time I heard this
[1:44:11] song, I thought, "Wow, there's a
[1:44:14] repentive heart." Whoever wrote this
[1:44:17] song and and just the the way that it
[1:44:21] presents this repentance is just
[1:44:23] beautiful. I didn't know Josiah was
[1:44:25] going to sing it. He he said he has a
[1:44:26] surprise for me. And this is the songs I
[1:44:29] have. Please sing it.
[1:44:34] [Music]
[1:44:35] All the things that I have
[1:44:38] held, the vanities that whispered in my
[1:44:43] ear. What would I do if they all
[1:44:51] disappear? Riches and fame and all that
[1:44:54] they could buy come to find. They never
[1:44:58] satisfy.
[1:45:01] What would I gain if my soul's the
[1:45:08] prize? I don't want to love what the
[1:45:11] world
[1:45:12] loves. I don't want to chase what the
[1:45:15] world does. I only want
[1:45:19] you. I only want you.
[1:45:25] So, first things first, I'll seek your
[1:45:28] will, not my own. Surrender all my wants
[1:45:34] to
[1:45:35] you and keep the first things
[1:45:40] first to live your truth, walk your
[1:45:44] ways, set my eyes. Lord, I fix my face
[1:45:50] on
[1:45:51] you. All my desires
[1:45:55] reversed to keep the first things
[1:46:01] [Music]
[1:46:05] first. I give it all. My life an
[1:46:09] offering. My heart is yours. So have
[1:46:12] your way in
[1:46:15] me. Your kingdom's all I want to
[1:46:18] seek. I don't want to love.
[1:46:21] I don't want to love what the world
[1:46:24] loves. I don't want to chase what the
[1:46:27] world does. I only want
[1:46:32] you. I only want you. I don't want to
[1:46:36] love. I don't want to love what the
[1:46:39] world
[1:46:40] loves. I don't want to chase what the
[1:46:43] world does. I only want you.
[1:46:49] I only want
[1:46:52] you. So, first things first, I seek your
[1:46:56] will, not my own. Surrender all my wants
[1:47:01] to
[1:47:03] you. Keep the first things
[1:47:08] first to live your truth. Walk your
[1:47:12] ways. Set my eyes. Lord, I fix my face
[1:47:17] on
[1:47:19] you. All my desires
[1:47:23] reversed to keep the first things first.
[1:47:29] [Music]
[1:47:35] What did you say?
[1:47:40] I give it all my life an
[1:47:43] offering. My heart is yours. So have
[1:47:46] your way with
[1:47:48] me. Lord, your kingdom's all I want to
[1:47:51] seek
[1:47:55] again. I give it all, my life and
[1:47:59] offering. My heart is yours, so have
[1:48:02] your way in me.
[1:48:05] Your kingdom's all I want to seek. I
[1:48:08] don't want to. Amen.
[1:48:11] Love what the world
[1:48:13] loves. I don't want to chase what the
[1:48:16] world does. I only want you.
[1:48:22] I only want you. I don't want to love.
[1:48:26] I don't want to love what the world
[1:48:29] loves. I don't want to chase what the
[1:48:32] world does. I only want
[1:48:36] you. I only want
[1:48:40] you. So, first things first, I seek your
[1:48:44] will, not my own. Surrender all my wants
[1:48:50] to
[1:48:51] you. To keep the first things
[1:48:56] first. To live your truth. Walk your
[1:49:00] ways. Set my eyes, Lord. I fix my face
[1:49:05] on
[1:49:07] you. All my desires
[1:49:10] reverse to keep the first things
[1:49:17] first. Keep the first thing first.
[1:49:19] Brother Amos,
[1:49:21] please. My friend, would you come
[1:49:24] forward and close? Brother Amos purges.
[1:49:28] Brothers and sisters,
[1:49:29] pride is something that is present in
[1:49:32] all of our
[1:49:34] lives. Pride is the very spirit of the
[1:49:39] devil
[1:49:40] himself. This blessed
[1:49:43] book tells
[1:49:46] us his spirit and how it influences all
[1:49:51] of the people in the world.
[1:49:54] But God told the same God that's here
[1:49:57] today, the same God that we pray to the
[1:50:00] that same God told
[1:50:02] Cain, he said, "If you can overcome
[1:50:06] it," he said, "you can conquer
[1:50:10] this." He says, "But if you don't," he
[1:50:13] said, "Sin is crouching at the
[1:50:17] door." Cain gave
[1:50:19] in to pride.
[1:50:23] It didn't make sense in his mind. His
[1:50:26] offering, his altar was more beautiful.
[1:50:29] It was more probably more work went into
[1:50:31] it. Everything about Cain's altar was
[1:50:35] greater in his eyes than his brother
[1:50:40] Abel's. But he fell to
[1:50:43] pride. And it's something that is
[1:50:46] everywhere. That's why God lists it
[1:50:48] first in so many things. Brother
[1:50:51] [Music]
[1:51:00] Amos. Dear Lord Jesus, I thank you for
[1:51:04] this word this morning, Lord
[1:51:08] God. Lord Jesus, as I stand here, I know
[1:51:11] humbly in my heart, Father, I'm nothing
[1:51:13] before you, Lord.
[1:51:16] I pray, Father, forgive me, Lord Jesus,
[1:51:19] where I've been lifted up, Lord. God
[1:51:21] caught in my own eyes,
[1:51:23] Lord. Oh,
[1:51:25] God. Lord
[1:51:29] Jesus. Father, your word is the same,
[1:51:31] Lord. No matter where it is, when it's
[1:51:33] preached, Lord, it speaks to my heart,
[1:51:36] speaks to each of our hearts, Lord.
[1:51:39] Father, I pray that you would help us to
[1:51:41] take these words inside of us, Lord.
[1:51:43] That we could live humbly, Lord, before
[1:51:46] you, Lord Jesus, and approach you,
[1:51:49] Father, every day, Lord. That we could
[1:51:52] draw closer to you, Lord, to serve you
[1:51:56] better than the day before, Father.
[1:52:00] Lord, I pray that you would continue to
[1:52:03] go with us today, Lord Jesus, throughout
[1:52:06] this day, that we might meditate upon
[1:52:08] these things that we've
[1:52:09] heard, that you would speak to us, Lord
[1:52:12] God, and help us, Lord Jesus, to lean on
[1:52:16] you and not our own understandings.
[1:52:19] Father, we commit our ways to you now
[1:52:22] this day.
[1:52:24] Father, as the day is
[1:52:26] long, pray that you bless Brother
[1:52:29] Daniel, Lord, his family, Lord Jesus,
[1:52:31] and the church here. Those that come in,
[1:52:34] Father, may they feel your presence,
[1:52:36] Lord, and know that you're the same
[1:52:38] yesterday, today, and forever. Yes.
[1:52:40] Amen.
[1:52:42] Grant it,
[1:52:43] Father. We ask all these things in your
[1:52:47] glory. Jesus name. Amen.
[1:52:52] [Music]
[1:52:55] We bow our
[1:52:58] hearts. We bend our
[1:53:02] knees. Oh spirit, come make us
[1:53:07] humble. We turn our
[1:53:09] eyes. We turn our
[1:53:13] eyes from evil things.
[1:53:18] Oh Lord, we cast down our
[1:53:22] idols. Give us clean
[1:53:26] hands. Give us pure
[1:53:30] hearts. Let us not lift our souls to
[1:53:37] another. Give us clean
[1:53:41] hands. Give us pure hearts.
[1:53:46] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[1:53:52] So give us clean
[1:53:55] hands. Give us pure
[1:54:00] hearts. Let us not lift our souls to
[1:54:06] another and give us clean hands.
[1:54:11] Give us pure hearts.
[1:54:14] [Music]
[1:54:15] Let us not lift our souls to
[1:54:20] another. Oh, and God, let us be a
[1:54:26] generation that
[1:54:28] sees seeks your face.
[1:54:32] Oh God of
[1:54:35] Jacob, oh God, let us be a
[1:54:40] generation that
[1:54:43] sees seeks your
[1:54:46] face. Oh God of J. We bow our
[1:54:52] hearts. We bow our
[1:54:56] hearts. We bend our knees.
[1:55:01] Oh spirit come make us
[1:55:07] humble. We turn our
[1:55:11] eyes from evil
[1:55:14] things, oh Lord. We cast out our idols.
[1:55:19] Yes. Amen. Give us clean. Sing it to the
[1:55:22] Lord now. Just sing it to him. Give us
[1:55:24] pure hearts.
[1:55:28] Let us not lift our souls to
[1:55:34] another. Give us clean
[1:55:37] hands. Give us pure
[1:55:41] hearts. Let us not lift our souls to
[1:55:46] another.
[1:55:48] Oh God, let us be a generation that
[1:55:55] seeks, seeks your
[1:55:58] face. Oh God of
[1:56:02] Jacob, oh God, let us be a generation
[1:56:07] that
[1:56:09] seeks, seeks your face.
[1:56:13] Oh God of
[1:56:17] Jacob, let this mind be in
[1:56:20] you which was also in Christ Jesus. who
[1:56:23] being in the form of God, thought it not
[1:56:26] robbery to be equal with God, but made
[1:56:28] himself of no
[1:56:30] reputation, and took upon him the form
[1:56:33] of a
[1:56:34] servant, and was made in the likeness of
[1:56:38] men. And being found in the fashion in
[1:56:41] fashion as a man, he himself humb he
[1:56:45] humbled
[1:56:46] himself and became obedient unto death,
[1:56:50] even the death of the cross. Wherefore
[1:56:53] God also hath highly exalted him and
[1:56:55] given him a name which is above every
[1:57:00] name. That's the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:57:03] And every knee shall bow to that name
[1:57:06] and every tongue will confess that name.
[1:57:09] The name of Jesus Christ. There's no
[1:57:12] service
[1:57:14] tonight. Pray that the Lord will give
[1:57:16] you a good day. Brothers and sisters,
[1:57:18] he's given us. The more scriptures I
[1:57:20] read, I feel like the more the Lord
[1:57:22] blesses us. He's given us just a good
[1:57:25] day, a good morning. I pray that you'd
[1:57:29] always keep your eye out from Lucifer.
[1:57:31] He's crouching at the at the door of
[1:57:34] every one of us. It wasn't just Cain.
[1:57:36] Every single one of us, even
[1:57:39] Peter, Jesus said, "Peter, Satan has
[1:57:43] sought sought you.
[1:57:46] He has sought you to sift you like
[1:57:47] wheat, but I have prayed for you. And
[1:57:51] then Peter comes back and he said, "The
[1:57:53] devil like a roaring and lion is going
[1:57:56] forth devouring whom he may
[1:57:59] devour." But if we can stay humble,
[1:58:01] brothers and sisters, if we can keep our
[1:58:03] word, our our mind on the word of God
[1:58:06] and humble in our heart, then we'll have
[1:58:10] the same fate as that sinner, that
[1:58:13] publican that went to pray. God will
[1:58:15] hear our prayers. It's a promise. Not
[1:58:18] for me. It's from the book. God bless
[1:58:21] you. You're
[1:58:22] [Music]
[1:58:23] dismissed. More of
[1:58:30] you. More of
[1:58:37] you. I've had it all.
