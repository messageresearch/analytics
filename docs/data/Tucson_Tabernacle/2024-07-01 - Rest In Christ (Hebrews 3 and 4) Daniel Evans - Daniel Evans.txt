to give I want to give you my heart this um we've been going through this series on the book of Hebrews and it's it's a tremendous book that really it's it's set apart it seems like from all the other um books in the New Testament it's just got a different feel to it it's got a different a different way of of introducing it and and a different way of closing very beginning usually the letters from from the apostles it'll say something like Paul an apostle of Christ to the church at Ephesus but Hebrews doesn't do that it it jumps right in and it it hits with God who at sundry times and in diverse manner spake in times past by the prophets hath in these last days spoken to us by his son by whom he created the worlds and and and he he goes in and and and just has this beautifully poetic way of speaking in in this book of Hebrews and it's it's meant for a purpose and the purpose isn't necessarily just to teach us about the Old Testament but it's to provide encouragement to not leave this faith that these people had had accepted to L understand the book I believe that we have to understand really the audience that it it's being written to and remember this is not too long after Jesus had ascended into heaven and there the message pretty much was only to Jewish people and this letter is written to these Jews that that they really understood the word of God they they um brother Jordan could you turn my monitor down just a hair um they understood the word of God and they they were well versed in the Old Testament and then when they saw this Jesus appear and they they heard this gospel and it says that they had received it from Witnesses of people that were with Jesus and they saw that this lines up right but what had happened with this book of Hebrews and we see it later on I believe it's around in chapter 10 we see that they started to fall away from the faith maybe they got discouraged maybe things weren't going like they thought that they should and this book is written to get them back with a proper perspective that this man Jesus Christ is not like anyone that has ever walked the Earth Hebrews chapter 1 and two separates Jesus from the Angels it separates Jesus from the uh the prophets and now when we get into chapters chapter 3 today he's even going to separate Jesus from the greatest Prophet that the Hebrews had ever um that it was consistent consistent that consensus that Moses was the greatest of all the prophets and even in this Hebrews chapter 3 he's going to separate Jesus even from Moses he's trying to tell them listen don't let these things slip this is really really important what you're learning and this faith that you have accepted in this Jesus it's different than anything that has that you have ever received this really makes it all alive and he the the author of the book he assumes as he's writing that the recipients the audience that they know the Bible very well and so he starts he starts talking and bringing scriptures out of history and one thing brothers and sisters is we need to realize that there is a place for all types of ministry this ministry in the book of Hebrews is very much a Teaching Ministry Jesus when he came he was a teacher he was an expounder upon the word and there's different kinds of gifts that that come to the pulpit some some gifts may have that ability to draw the the the strength out of the people and bring an emotional response that's very important many times it's you sometimes you need that crying at the altar then there's other Ministries that have the gift of healing and miracles and and we need those gifts also in our church and we have seen those manifested here but there's also the gift of teaching brother Ryan and I last week after service we were talking about about these things and and I was telling him that there's different Ministries and there's different gifts for all the people as I just said and there is something about when we come to church and when we leave and something that was said just turns on the light bulb there it's like oh I never thought about that those things stay with you that many times that emotion it it it'll leave after a while but those when when you get a revelation of the word and it comes down and you think oh this is how that applies to my life I've got to make some changes here or I'm going down the right Road I wasn't sure that I was going but now I know I'm going down the right Road and that's that's where that Ministry comes in and it's like this book of Hebrews and I gave a testimony on Wednesday night that I was talking to some young men out in front of the church and I could tell them about some of the Miracles that had happened it didn't really stick but when I started talking about who God is and pulling God out of this Bible and explaining how that God is alive and he does things today and how he wants to be worshiped and that he is The Sovereign Authority and not us we want to put God in the box of our lives and in our understanding of God but God is God he doesn't answer to us so often with the world today we want God to answer to our way of thinking Lord I will I I will serve you or I'll accept you in into my life if it lines up with nobody dying or no Wars and that's what we were talking about on Wednesday with with these young men brothers and sisters that's not God he doesn't answer to my way of thinking he doesn't answer to your way of thinking what we need to do is try to get into his way of thinking and as I was expounding on these things that is what really made a difference to this young man that's what he wanted to know he wanted to know more the theological approach and how that this would make sense in his life and that's when this book of Hebrews was written that's what he's doing he's the author is trying to bring Christ out of history and say here this man Jesus fulfills these these many many prophecies and he makes statements in this in the first just couple chapters he says that that this Jesus he says he's the brightness of God's glory so so and he is the express image of his person so the author is saying listen if if you see this Jesus Christ or you get to know him the once Untouchable God who no man could even look at and live the one that dwells in this unapproachable light with tens of millions of angels surrounding him this one that it was death to see him it was death to go into the holy of holies if you weren't the high priest once a year once a year that one now can be approached and should be approached and we can have a relationship with him him and it's he's saying do you see the gravity of this man do you see the importance of this it's not just being a Christian and seeing that there are Miracles and and and the the gospel was preached to the Sinners it wasn't just that it was a this is God the Eternal being the one that created the heavens and the Earth this isn't a man and he's here he came he died he rose again and now he wants to dwell in people it's just it's an incredible book and as we get into a little bit further the author it's important that we understand some of the stories that are talked about that are referenced in the book of Hebrews they're referenced very um subtly but the recipients knew what he was talking about this man Moses as I said he was according to the Hebrews he was the greatest of the great he was the the the prophet the lawgiver is this Moses he wrote the Torah and the Torah the book of Hebrews expects the reader to understand and to know the Torah very well the Torah first five books of the Bible written by Moses from Genesis to Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy those five books make up the Torah those five books are written by the prophet Moses we need to understand what those what those are and what in Genesis it brings down this lineage of God starts as we know with Adam then goes down to Seth and all the way down through the genealogies down through like Methuselah and Noah and um and then Abraham and Abraham's a pivotal part in this first book of the Torah Abraham then Abraham was baren he couldn't have children as we know and then God promised that he was going to make a great nation out of Abraham and that he was going to give him this promised land so then Abraham by a miracle of God in his old age he and his wife have this son named Isaac Isaac has a son named Jacob Jacob's name was changed to Israel so when we hear the children of Israel we are talking about the sons of Jacob there were 12 of them the book of Hebrews it's very important that we know two of those Sons the first one is Judah Judah was um when Jacob at the end of his life he prophesied over all of his sons individually when he prophesied over Judah he made a statement that was interpreted interpreted correctly as the Messiah would come from the line of Judah later on we see that Judah that that line went through King David we see a prophecy again I believe it was from Samuel that said that the son of David would be the Messiah so we know that the Messiah comes down through that line of Judah through David and all the way down to the Lord Jesus being the Messiah that's one of the ones that we need to understand as we're getting into the book of Hebrews and the second one is this other brother of the twel named Levi Levi was he was the priesthood Moses was from the tribe of Levi Aaron his brother obviously I mean by default was also from the tribe of Levi and and Aaron was the first what we refer to as the high priest it's very important that we understand what the high priest is the high priest is the one that he went into so Moses built the the Tabernacle in the wilderness the tents we had in the in the Tabernacle there was a there was a place in the very back called the holy of holies that is where the high priest would go in once a year and he would make an offering a sacrifice for the atonement of the people and God would his presence would come down into that area the high priest is the one that did that the high priest was he was pretty much the boss of of the priests he he really was the one that made an atonement for the people it's a very important part of that so we see down through this Li this line of Levi that's where the priests that work in the temple and the high priest comes from that and and Moses and Aaron and down over here is the tribe of Judah okay are we Square now they're they all of their dads their dad name name was Jacob also called Israel and these are where all of the Jewish people come from is those 12 tribes those two tribes are what the book of Hebrews concentrates on now the book of Hebrews it references a few different stories and and one of the stories it references and and when we get into chapter 3 in in a couple minutes we'll talk about this is when Moses came do you remember Moses was sent to call the people out of bondage so they Moses comes and and he brings all the plagues and remember the death angel cames comes and and uh he he tells pharaoh to let my people go I think we've probably most of us have seen the movie it's it's good it's it's good that we understand that because it is a very very important story so they they come out then they go up and they get locked up against the ocean God comes down and a wind wind blows and parts the ocean on both sides they go across they head north and remember the promise of the promised land and that is from even more land than this but about the Jordan River over to the Mediterranean Sea you've heard they say that the um the Palestinians are want to destroy Israel and they say from The River To The Sea and they say well it's ours will know my Bible says that God gave it to the Jewish people and there was so they're wandering in the wilderness they head north and then they're going to cross over this River into this promised land so they get to this place called Kadesh Baria and they send spies over from each tribe they send spies over to spy out this land and they go out and it's like wow this place is great there's there's grapes and figs and and we could really make a good living over here and they see though there were giants in the land and there were great warriors and this land was going to be hard to take so they come back and 10 of those spies say we can't do it we're not able to do it these guys are tooo big they got they have these big swords that are too much and they have shields they're Warriors we can't do it but then there was two spies that said no yes we can we are able to do this so there was a big rebellion in the in the in the tribe in the uh Camp of Israel and it got so bad that they wanted to kill Moses and the leaders and they wanted to go back to Egypt it grieved God because God was imagine put yourself in God's place it's like did I not just part the Red Sea did I not just kill the biggest army in the world with one little swipe with the Egyptians drown them all did I not re Mana from Heaven did I not bring water out of the rock did I not do all these things and you're worried about these few people over here and it grieved God it upset him it as the Bible will say it provoked him to anger so we have to remember that story in the Bible as part of what is being talked about in this book of Hebrews and I believe it calls it the provocation they provoked God in doing this and the Bible is telling us this for a warning hey don't you do it now God sent you Jesus Christ he sent you the Holy Spirit he sent things these things to you now you don't provoke God like your ancestors did so let's get into it so in Hebrews chapter 2 God put everything in subje subjection to to Jesus Christ but he was made flesh and blood so that he might become a mer merciful and faithful high priest I just mentioned what the high priest was in the service of God to make the propit tuation of sins to to be able to make an atonement to be able to step in for our sins because he Jesus suffered Temptation so he is able to help those that are attempted all without sin but he suffered he knows how it feels so basically God came down in human flesh he felt the same feelings as we feel so he can make an atonement for our sins so he gets it more than any of us knowing what everybody else is going through Jesus understands he knows how it feels to be you and me he knows how it feels to be tempted he knows how maybe lying is a Temptation or gossiping or or wanting power or wanting money he knows all of that and he overcame that so now he can help us overcome it so the author is writing this letter to try to get the people to understand that Jesus is a lot more than a prophet or even an angel he's saying that he understands our trials he understands our sufferings he is this high priest the real one that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities that can understand us so let's start Hebrews chapter three verse one says it says this wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our confession Christ Jesus who was faithful to him that appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all his house for this man was counted worthy of more Glory than Moses in as much as he who had builded the house hath more honor than the house for every house is builded by some man but he that built all things is God and Moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after but Christ as a son over his own house this is my favorite part right here I love this part whose house we are wow If We Hold Fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the Hope firm unto the end so he's saying that the prophet was faithful that Moses Moses was was was a faithful and true servant but he's saying that Jesus Built the house and Moses the greatest of all the prophets in the in the all the Old Testament he was just part of the house so the greatest of all prophets was just something that was built by Christ and Christ should receive the glory for everything that Moses did is what the author is trying to tell us here and the APO the Apostle Paul he was Paul was great I mean talking about an understanding of the word Paul he said he said for I know that there is nothing good in me in my flesh he said there's nothing good but if there's anything that's good in me it comes from Christ right in line with this verse number seven wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith today if you will hear his voice Harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of Temptation in the wilderness what I just spoke about when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my Works 40 years wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do always he in their heart and they have not known my ways so I swear in my wrath that they they shall not enter into my rest now he's quoting not only is he talking about this story that happened but he's also quoting a Psalm probably written by the by King David Psalm 95 verse let's read it because he he mentions it two or three times um from now Psalm 95:7 he says for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture and the Sheep of his hand today if you will hear his voice Harden not your heart as in the provocation as in as and as in the day of Temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my work 40 years long was I grieved in with this generation and said it is a people that do he in their heart and they have not known my ways unto whom I swear in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest so this Psalm was written after that that happened in the wilderness and a thousand years before this letter of the Hebrews was written and it's referring as I said to the Rebellion that was in the wilderness back to Hebrews chap 3:2 take heed Brethren lest there be any of you an evil heart of unbelief in parting from the Living God but exort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin remember these words are Eternal they are not just for the Hebrews that that read this first letter can you imagine man you getting that letter first and reading these words but now we can read them and people have been reading them for 2,000 years and they're not just for the original audience times repeat themselves so he's the author is telling us that if we truly love one another then exort one another daily about these things because the time is short and there will be those whose hearts are hardened through sin in this building I'm not talking about 2,000 years ago with the with the recipients of this letter I'm talking about today he is commanding us through the inspiration of the Holy Ghost to exhort one another daily all the time while it is called today so today do it then tomorrow it'll be called today tomorrow when we get there do it not yesterday and then two days from now it'll be called today again and do it again how many people have all of us seen that desire the world and then that lust leads them to a sinful life there's there it just it's torn and it breaks my heart when I see that probably more than anything else as as a pastor is just as a brother that when someone they just have a desire for the things of the world they have a desire they they put whether it be when you're my age whether it be money or or business deals or something like that or or when they're young whether it maybe it's it's sinful living it's clubs and sleeping around before you're married and and all of those things they put that before they put God it's it's it's very sad thing to watch but it's because that desire of the world is more important than that desire for God you're going to serve whatever you want to serve let me tell you that you are going to do what you want to do do you want is it a stronger desire for you to serve God or is it a stronger desire for you to be pulled into the things of the world first John says love not the world or the things of the world for the love if if any loves the world then the love of the father is not even in him so the ath author of The epistle is pleading with the readers to encourage one another in the things of the Lord and don't stop doing it so so mothers teach your children fathers teach your teach your children your wives and your husbands and your brothers and your sisters always exhorting one another daily when uh we were living in Jeffersonville i' I've given the testimony a couple times that we started this boxing gym and we wanted to dedicate it to serving God and to Leading people to the Lord Jesus to showing them that Jesus is real there there's it was it was a Ministry to many of the down andout people that just they didn't have money they didn't have there was really just no potential but we wanted to give them a chance and the chance that they have is through Jesus Christ if they can change their lives if they can break this cycle of just not working crime all these things if they can break that cycle and make a change and get that New Birth being born again then they can change their families they can then they can have a good happy life so we started this and we working um we had uh one fighter he's uh heavyweight and really really good um I think he was I don't know 7 and0 or so something like that and uh he actually went to Vegas and stayed there for about a year or two or whatever it was to train there and started fighting there really high caliber fighter and what we wanted to do was we wanted to have a uh like a a grand opening for our gym it was we'd been on on the scene for maybe six months and we wanted to get the word out so we invited the mayor of the city he ended up coming and we uh we talked about the fighting and then we talked um we wanted we also invited a sister gym that we had in Philadelphia and Tim Witherspoon was part um was in that Circle probably everyone under my age probably are a little bit older than me probably doesn't know who Tim Withers spin is he was a heavyweight champion professional boxer um that was just before Mike Tyson everybody knows who Mike Tyson was he was he was just a he was a great Fighter um so he ended up coming to our uh Gathering there and what we did is we set up a big tent in Jeffersonville and we like I said the mayor was there and we had I don't know how many people and we had um we had a service and we had a tent there and then I spoke at the service and I talked about sacrifice and how that the original sacrifice in the Garden of Eden was an animal and how that represented Jesus and then I talked about how we should give God everything and and this Tim Witherspoon was in the audience a famous guy um brother Jordan if you could show the picture I took um here's Tim and and Daniel um and that guy on the left he's by the way it's the picture's a little out of um perspective he's giant he's uh he's about 65 six6 and just a big guy and then there's my little boy right there and and so Tim was he was there and I'm just gonna I'm gonna brag for just a second it's okay to do it because I'm on somebody else but so Tim comes in and and he sees our Flagship heavyweight fighter and he's like oh yeah yeah he's good but who is this white kid and uh so he's he's watching Daniel fight and then he starts saying hey this guy right here this young man has got something so he gets in the ring with Daniel and he's starting to coach him and and Daniel's learning some stuff from him Tim Withers is some of the older folks if if you ever saw him fight he had this overhand right that would just come like from out of the country and just land and just knock heavyweights out he was he could hit hard and he saw Daniel and he's like this kid has really got something and he wanted to kind of attach himself to Daniel because he saw that that this kid has some potential and let me tell you Daniel my son he did have a lot of potential but he saw something more important than boxing and he made a choice in his life boxing is a very worldly um profession and and you have to go through a lot and and Daniel saw that the more important thing was serving God and serving God's people and you see that my son a after you see the Lord working and he just wanted to help the help the fighters and he would encourage them and counsel them and and he was so respected that everybody kind of flocked to him and he Daniel used that to point them to Jesus Christ and that's the most important thing if God gives us a gift take that gift and use it for God it's not your gift anyways a gift means somebody gave it to you so God gave it to you now use it for him and that's this Tim Witherspoon so he's he's he's talking finished up my sermon and he raises his hand and he says I want to say something so he comes up to the platform and he had already told me this story earlier and he said he says my mother was a preacher and she always told me jtim serve God serve the Lord don't you you take this boxing it's okay but but make sure that you're living for Jesus and he said you know she told me that and I I never I never thought about it it was just it wasn't anything he said but now he says I see what you're doing in this gym and he says my mom's words are coming back to me and he says you're doing right what this is about putting God first he said this is the right thing to do and this is the guy that um he got hooked up with um what was the promoter's named Don King anybody my age or probably a little probably not younger but older um probably remembers Don King he was a crook but he was he was a promoter for like Tim Witherspoon he took all of his money Mike Tyson got him all messed up he was the guy that had the hair that stuck straight up you remember him um but he got hooked up with that and it just made Tim bitter and he and when he was talking he says that he says now these things my mom telling me he says I see how important they are and and Tim he didn't have money he'd been ripped off and he was just he was looking for something and I I saw that the Lord really used him to speak to these people me saying it I'm a nobody but him saying it held a lot of weight among those people and I I looked at him and I told him afterwards I said man God's given you another chance chance he's he you can do it just serve him we talked for a while and and he was just such a such a sweet sweet person and I just pray that it made a difference in his life and that's why what I wanted to tell that story is his mother exhorted him daily always telling him Tim serve God serve God and it planted a seed that made a difference in his life life later on that's this book of Hebrews it says verse 13 but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast Until the End English Standard Version says this for verse 14 it says for we have come to share in Christ if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end hold strong to what you have learned he previously says the author says how can we escape if we neglect so great salvation he's saying you've been given a gift and how can you escape later if you if if you just throw it out it's more important than you can ever imagine it's God himself not a high priest not a prophet but God the Creator the Eternal one the one that spoke a word and the world came into existence he's saying that this man is that man that came this Jesus is him while it is said today if you'll hear his voice Harden not your hearts as in the provocation he's again referring to that Psalm 95 and that story from Kadesh barnea for some when they had heard did provoke how be it not all that came out of Egypt by m Moses English Standard Version is much easier to understand on that for who were those who heard and yet rebelled was it not all those who left Egypt led by Moses he's asking a very important question he's saying that the ones who rebelled and provoked God were the ones who came out of Egypt following the prophet Moses they were the ones who rebelled wow so just because God sends a prophet and you recognize who that Prophet is it does not mean that you've made it you could be the problem like the Hebrews were the problem in the wilderness who follow and they were the ones who were following Moses but they didn't do what God commanded them to do through Moses but with whom was God but with whom was he grieved 40 years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness so they fell into sin they worshiped the golden calf they complained about everything they were complaining about the food they were eating and it was fallen from heaven and they weren't paying for it and they were complaining about it they were complaining about the water they were drinking and it was coming as a miracle from a rock and they were provide they were complaining about the leadership that God had provided you know sometimes we don't think our sin's a big deal but we're quick to point out sin in the other guy one word brothers and sisters one word of blasphemy has the potential of of never being forgiven one word one sin has the potential to send us you or me to hell that's how important these Stakes are that's why this book of Hebrews he is trying to say look how important this man is and to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believe not so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief these are called out people and he's saying that even they couldn't enter into the promised land because of their unbelief and he almost uses sin and unbelief interchangeably and as we progress to the scriptures you'll see that Hebrews chapter 4 let us therefore lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it the scripture says it is impossible to please God without faith faith in what faith in him that not only is able to do what he promised but also that there are consequences for not doing what he commanded for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said at as I have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and God did rest the seventh day from all his Works seventh day the the Sabbath believe it's the fourth Commandment says to keep the Sabbath to honor that Sabbath to keep that day holy when time started ticking God God separated the light from the darkness on on that first day and he went through the things that he did he separated the the dry land from the oceans and and he put the stars in the heaven and the moon in the sky and the last thing that he did was create a human being and after those six days of creation then God took some time off he rested from all his works on the seventh day and God commanded Ed us to do the same thing through the Ten Commandments the fourth Commandment as I said that God gave Mo Moses on Mount Si but the thing that we always need to realize that like almost everything in the Bible especi all the Commandments they are s they are they're symbolic of something else yes they were they were given to us to obey and to be practiced but there was a deeper meaning Behind These Commandments the first sacrifice in Genesis 3 Adam and Eve Sinn by eating the fruit um of the tree of knowledge that God had promised that if they disobeyed his Commandments that death would follow we know the story in Genesis 3 so he required something to stand in that PL in their place because of that sin he says if you eat of this fruit then this day you will die so what happened they did what he said not to then God goes He is a just God justice justice is not forgiveness Justice is if you steal money from me you're gonna pay there's no me forgiving you it's just God is a just God his wisdom his Justice is wonderful but there's no mercy there so he says that if you do this and they did it then I will require death and then God goes and he kills an animal or two and then makes a garment to cover their nakedness to cover their sin so God takes their sin and he says okay I require death now this is going to die because you did this and he takes it and he clothes clothes them with it and here they are and they're they're in these skins and it represented that death that had to happen but the thing is they still died it was only a representation so it only stayed the wrath of God for a little while it was symbolic and that blood then Abel the son he goes and he kills an animal on the altar because God had commanded that Abel probably saw his sins he had done things wrong so he goes and he kills an animal because he knew that God required death for sin and the thing is that we have to understand that our sins require death and then require our death yes if there's no atonement there and that atonement cannot be provided by an animal anymore it never could it never worked they still died so brothers and sisters I just want want to make that plain our sin requires death the separation from God really it requires hell the stakes are very very high if we sin and there is no atonement for sin through the blood of the Supreme sacrifice Jesus Christ we will go to hell I don't know how else to play to say it it's not me that's saying those things it's this Bible that says it that's how important Jesus is so back to the Sabbath in uh numbers chapter 15 so so Moses brings down the Ten Commandments okay and and one of those Commandments is honor the Sabbath day to keep it holy so he comes down and and he tells all the people and you'll be punished they'll be there'll be they'll be punishment for this so this man goes out on the Sabbath and I remember first time I read this I was like no way first time I remember reading it he goes out and he probably going to cook some dinner so he goes out and he gets a couple sticks and he picks them up and he's walking back and they're like hey that just broke the Sabbath you're not supposed to do that so he he was like oh yeah or maybe he was just disrespecting God we don't know but they're like well let's go see Moses and see what's the punishment is is so they take the man and they bring him to Moses and Moses is like yeah um let me ask God so he asked God God says that man must die take him outside the city and kill him when I read that I was like no way they killed him what about what about him him saying he's sorry or whatever this can't be right let me get another translation you know that was Justice God provided that Justice remember aen when he stole when they went over in the promised land they went over to Jericho and they they aen steals the wedge of gold and the Babylonian garment they took him outside not only did they kill aan they killed his whole family that is Justice Brothers and Sisters I Don't Want Justice I want Mercy you can see brother Lyall I can see why it's so important to the Jewish people that they have two separate pots one for cooking a goat and one for boiling milk and and they they don't even I was there and it was Saturday and the the elevator didn't work they're not allowed to press the button on Saturday but I understand I get it the stakes are really high that's why that they put those things in order they want to make sure that they are not breaking those Commandments but in they don't know Jesus yet they don't know how important that this Jesus Christ is they don't know that there is a rest that we find in Christ that if we do sin that there is an atonement for sin and I love him so much that I'm going to try not to there is a rest there I preached on on Mother's Day I believe it was I preached on El Shai that God that can nurse strength into that child there's something about the one that you really love the one that you really trust that you can really find rest in that person remember meline when she was a little girl she was she had a spoon and there was something plugged into the light socket and she goes over there brother Jordan This is the difference between a a dad and a mom and she takes the spoon and she starts to put it in behind the lights the the plug the light switch that was plugged in she starts putting it in there and I was like I think I know what's going to happen and and it did it boom it it arked and I'll tell you what the little girl she big pucker lip and she was scared and she ran to me she knew she had done something wrong but she ran to that safety and that's how we do with Christ there is rest a a baby I noticed when little Laurel when when when she when she gets upset she wants mom she wants Dad she wants the ones that that she knows the best that she trusts the most and that's how it is how we can have rest in Jesus we want to go to the one that knows me the best the one that I can really trust so this sabbath day it was only a type of the real thing that's why the seventh day adventti they don't get it the Sabbath should be honored more today than it as ever been but it's not one day of the week we can rest in Christ 24 hours every single day knowing that Jesus Christ has forgiven me for my sins and there's no fighting like they did when they crossed over Jordan remember they went in the promised land and he says I'm not God says I'm not going to give them rest remember when when the spies came back he says they will not they are all going to die and I'm going to raise up a new generation and they'll go over but when they went over there was no rest first thing they do is get in a big fight at Jericho and kill a bunch of people and the walls come coming down then they then they go to Ai and they lose it wasn't rest that didn't fulfill it let's keep on going in the scriptures um with like I said with the Sabbath it's it is a type of something and it's like like communion we take the communion with understanding that that piece of bread is not the literal Body of Christ and that wine is not his literal blood but we are doing this in remembrance as a symbol We are following a commandment but we're doing as a symbol that one day we will eat with that man that died for our sins we will eat with him and when we go and when we eat communion is not a meal it's just a little piece of bread tiny and a little thing of wine but when we go it represents when we go to be with him that now they will we will have that communion with him it's representative same with the Sabbath it's representative of someone something else we honor it we obey it but it represents something else and there there are people that claim to be Christians they claim the name of of Jesus Christ but they don't honor what he said I uh I'm running out of time I'll tell you what I'll finish tonight I want to get to I want to get to this when Jesus said I believe it's in Matthew chapter 7 he said many will come to me in my name and say have we not cast out Devils have we not healed the sick have we not done Mighty works in your name in the name of Jesus and he's going and he's going to say depart from me you that work iniquity for I never knew you I didn't know who you were you've done these things you went through the the Motions but you didn't know me and I didn't know you so these people are banished to Hell who are these people they're not Muslim Muslims don't come in the name of Jesus Christ they're not Hindus Hindus doesn't come in the name of Jesus Christ they're not the drug addicts on the street they're not coming in the name of Jesus Christ who comes in the name of Jesus Christ claims his name but they're not real they don't take it seriously enough how important is it this hits right at home brothers and sisters we cannot if we if we are sinning will willfully if we're doing these things is it going to be us that says oh one time I had an experience at the altar he'll probably say if you had the experience of the altar then you should have known better than to fall back into that sin book of Hebrews is warning don't go back to that and he's trying to tell them do you see how important this is that if you really accept it you know the Sabbath Hebrews you know that the Commandment if you really understood the Sabbath you would see that it only typed it was a representation of this man when he came that you can find rest like a child can find rest in its mother's arms and if we find that rest everything will always be all right and the author is trying to get people back to the seriousness of Christ and then he says in verse 5 he says and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest and he quotes again Psalm 995 saying seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief Let's uh the musicians would would come and um I'm out of time so we'll uh I'll I'll pick it up tonight brothers and sisters this book of Hebrews he is saying look here he is in history all of these things are a type of now this man Jesus Christ and don't neglect it you will find yourself being judged one day you'll find yourself with that righteous judge and and where will mercy be that we didn't try to serve him and he's warning the Hebrews listen you know the scriptures you know the prophets you know what they said you have a good understanding but please don't neglect these things study this and he's taking the scriptures and he's bringing them out so that the people will understand do we understand do we understand that just because we call ourselves Believers just because we call ourselves Christians just because that we say that that we understand this or or we might read our Bibles there has to be that personal experience that personal relationship if you look at the Old Testament and the New Testament there's one really big difference and we'll close with this that big difference in the Old Testament is God dealt with with the entire country when achen stole the wedge of gold he and his family were put to death and all of Israel suffered for it but now in the New Testament it's no longer dealing with an entire country now it is dealing with an individual with one person with Daniel Evans with me with you and him that's a big that's a huge difference between the old and the new now we can know Jesus Christ ourselves now the high priest we don't have to go to the priest and give him a lamb to sacrifice to sacrifice we can go straight to God through the atonement of Jesus Christ that's what it's all about that's a big difference between the old and the new and imagine the rest that we know whatever happens imagine how we can have comfort knowing that Jesus Christ is on the throne and that he knows my name that he knows me he knows my family imagine how we can just un how we can just rest in that and we talk about the Sabbath it was just a little hint of what we have now that we can rest in Jesus Christ if we know him and if we put him first in our lives amen brother just I was Str in sin's dark Valley no hope within good I see they search through heaven to find a savior to save a poor lost soul Like Me Oh What A Savior oh Hallelujah his heart was broken on calary his hands were nail SC his side was rien he gave his life's blood for even me he left the father he left the father with all his r es with calmness sweet and sering came down from heaven and gave his life's blood to make the V sinner clean oh what a Savor oh Hallelujah his heart was broken on calary his hands were nail scored his side was Ren he gave his life's blood for even me and death's chilly waterers I'll soon be Crossing but his hand Will Lead Me sa [Laughter] for I'll join that corus in that great City and I'll sing up there forever more Oh What A Savior oh Hallelujah his heart was broken on Calvary his hand hands were n scored his side was rien he gave his life's blood for even me the rest the rest of Jesus Christ there is something there is just something so special to know that whatever happens that Jesus is there and that is what the Sabbath represented it wasn't just a day to take off and to relax the Sabbath was representative of something that is to come and what was it what was to come is now that is Jesus the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed me from my sins this book of Hebrews was written to remind those people that had already accepted Christ of the gravity of the situation and he was bringing him up out of the Old Testament and showing that listen that he is the Fulfillment of everything and brothers and sisters he is alive today he's everything the book of Hebrews to me it is an absolute Masterpiece a literary Masterpiece quote after quote after quote from the Old Testament and lifting him up just wait till we get into MDC and the spiritualness of that man that met Abraham it was Jesus the author says Jesus over a thousand years earlier in the form of a man and Abraham recognized him and paid ties to him tremendous tremendous and and the high priest and how that Jesus that even the high priest going into the holy of holies it wasn't it represented something else and when Jesus came and made that atonement there was a curtain that covered the holy of holies that back room and only the high priest could go in there once a year and when Jesus Christ died on the cross that curtain was ripped from top to bottom exposing that Mercy Seat that holy of holies representative of what Jesus did he was torn so that we might be able to talk to God and brothers and sisters it is the most important thing to remember that this new testament it speaks of a personal relationship a personal walk with God you have to talk to him and if we as in the ministry if we can just open this book like the book of Hebrews does and show that here he is now you have to have that relationship with him it can't be from Washington pots and and making sacrifices it has to be that relationship if we can just show that but there's going to be those that come in the name of Jesus Christ and he's going to say depart from me you that work iniquity I never knew you because they just say they're Christians they just give him they just give him lip service but oh when you have something that hurts when you have something that that you need you need that rest he is alive and he works miracles he does things and if we could just know him if you're sick you're you you'll get healed but you'll get sick again but there is an eternal reward and to me that Eternal reward is I get to be with him that's what I want with all of my heart I want to be with Jesus do you want to be with him that's all [Music] [Applause] stand to God be the glory to God be the glory to God be the glory for the things he has done with his blood he has saved me by his power he has raised me to God be the glory for the things he has done to God be the glory to God be the glory to God be the glory for the things he has done with his blood he has saved me with his power he has raised me to God God be the glory for the things he has done let's bow our heads God is a just God and he requires justice but there was also a sacrifice that was without spot or blemish that stood in my place so that I might receive eternal life so that my sins might be forgiven please if you don't know him if you don't have that relationship ship with him seek it out ask him Lord I want to know you I want to have that that rest to know that my Jesus Knows My [Music] Name Lord I want to have that rest I want to talk with you almighty God we are thankful
