[3:50] day. God bless you all. We'll just uh
[3:53] bow our heads to our Lord and
[3:56] Savior. Lord Jesus, we just thank you,
[3:58] Father. What a what a great opportunity
[4:01] to be in your presence, Lord. Once
[4:03] again, Father, to hear from you, Lord.
[4:06] We deem it such a privilege, such an
[4:07] honor, dear Lord. Father, we just invite
[4:11] you, Lord. You said where two or three
[4:13] are gathered in my name, there you'd be
[4:15] present among us, Father. And we know
[4:18] that that's the truth, Lord. And Lord,
[4:21] whatever you have today, whatever you
[4:23] have for each individual, Lord, because
[4:25] you deal with us, Lord, as individuals,
[4:27] Father, Lord, whatever you have, Father,
[4:30] we just have an open heart to receive,
[4:33] Lord Jesus.
[4:35] Lord, we pray for any need, any request,
[4:38] anything, Lord, that you'd you'd have,
[4:40] any person would have this morning,
[4:43] Father, that you would just meet that
[4:45] need, Lord God. And Lord, we just pray
[4:48] that you'd be with the the minister, be

[5:30] [Music]
[5:33] Sunday school, you can go ahead and go
[5:35] back. Thank you
[5:38] guys. Greater is he that is in me. Oh,
[5:43] greater is he that is in
[5:46] me. Or greater is he that is in me than
[5:51] he that is in the world.
[5:55] Satan's like a roaring lion roaming to
[6:00] and
[6:02] fro seeking whom he may devour. The
[6:07] Bible tells us
[6:09] so. Many souls have been his prey to
[6:14] fall in some weak
[6:16] hour. What God has promised us today,
[6:21] his overcoming
[6:24] power. Oh, greater is he that is in
[6:28] me. Greater is he that is in me. Or
[6:33] greater is he that is in me than he that
[6:37] is in the world.
[6:41] On the day of
[6:43] Pentecost, a rushing mighty
[6:47] wind blew into the upper room and
[6:52] baptized all of
[6:54] them with the power greater than any
[7:00] earthly
[7:01] foe. And I'm so glad I've got it, too.
[7:06] I'm going to let the whole world know.
[7:10] Oh, greater is he that is in me. Oh,
[7:14] greater is he that is in
[7:16] me. Greater is he that is in me than he
[7:21] that is in the
[7:25] world. Amen. Guys, happy to be here this
[7:28] morning. I'm happy to be here. I know
[7:30] I've already said that, but isn't it so
[7:32] good to be in church this morning?
[7:34] There's so many people without church
[7:35] this morning. We are just such a blessed
[7:37] people just to be even given the
[7:39] opportunity to be here. Amen. Uh let's
[7:42] all
[7:44] [Music]
[7:47] stand. Oh, I can't
[7:51] even walk without you
[7:55] holding my hand.
[7:59] The
[8:00] mountains too
[8:02] high and the
[8:05] valleys too
[8:08] wide. Down on my
[8:12] knees, it's where I learn to
[8:16] stand. Oh, I can't
[8:19] even walk without you
[8:23] holding my hand.
[8:29] I thought number
[8:33] one would
[8:35] surely be
[8:38] me. I thought
[8:40] I could
[8:42] be what I
[8:44] wanted to be.
[8:48] I thought I could
[8:51] build on life
[8:54] sinking
[8:56] sand, but I can't even walk without you
[9:03] holding my
[9:05] hand. I can't
[9:08] even walk without you
[9:12] holding my hand.
[9:15] The
[9:17] mountains too
[9:19] high and the
[9:21] valleyies too
[9:24] wide. The down on my
[9:28] knees is where I learn to
[9:32] stand. Lord, I can't even walk without
[9:38] you
[9:39] holding my
[9:44] hand. I thought I had
[9:49] done a lot on my
[9:53] own. I thought
[9:55] I could make
[9:58] it
[10:00] all alone.
[10:03] I thought
[10:04] of
[10:06] myself as a
[10:09] mighty big
[10:10] man, but I can't even walk without you
[10:17] holding my
[10:20] hand. Oh, I can't even walk without you
[10:27] holding my hand.
[10:30] The
[10:31] mountains too
[10:33] high and the
[10:36] valleys too
[10:38] wide. Oh, down on my
[10:42] knees. It's where I learn to
[10:47] stand. Lord, I can't even walk without
[10:52] you
[10:53] holding my hand.
[10:56] [Music]
[10:59] Oh, I can't even walk without you
[11:05] holding my
[11:07] hands. The
[11:10] valleys too
[11:11] wide and the
[11:14] valleys too
[11:17] wide. Down on my
[11:20] knees, it's where I learn to stand.
[11:26] But I can't
[11:28] even walk without you holding my
[11:34] hand. As the brothers would make way for
[11:37] the offering, uh the prayer requests, we
[11:39] got a couple this morning. One's from
[11:41] brother Ronnie Glidewell is asking
[11:44] prayer, asking for prayer as he and his
[11:47] wife, Sister Susie, traveled to
[11:49] Montreal. Sis Susie lost her aunt last
[11:52] week. They desire strength, wisdom, and
[11:55] the leading of the Lord to handle the
[11:57] things that they need to take care of.
[11:59] Remember that in
[12:01] prayer. And from Sister Erica Morales,

[13:14] father. Lord, as we sing, we can't do
[13:17] anything without you holding our hand.
[13:21] So, Father, we want to commit ourselves
[13:23] in to your hands this morning. We desire
[13:26] these requests,
[13:27] Father, that you'd place your hands upon
[13:31] them. Do you know the needs that have
[13:34] been unspoken, the requests that have
[13:35] been written out and
[13:38] spoken? Lord, have your way in each
[13:40] need.
[13:42] We commit them into your hands and we
[13:44] give you thanks, Lord, for what you're
[13:46] about to do and what you've already
[13:48] done. And as we
[13:51] take the offering, Lord, we'd ask that
[13:53] you'd bless the offering. Bless the
[13:55] giver. Use it for your honor and glory.
[13:58] We we ask and be in the remainder of the
[14:01] service. And we give you praise, honor,
[14:03] and glory in Jesus Christ's name.
[14:06] Amen. You may be seated.
[14:13] [Music]
[14:21] All throughout my
[14:26] history, your faithfulness has walked
[14:30] beside
[14:33] me. The winter storms make way for
[14:37] spring.
[14:41] In every season from where I'm

[25:27] faith. There are two roads.
[25:34] You may
[25:39] take, one by

[25:50] Take the word of
[25:54] God or what you
[25:59] see, what you
[26:05] believe is what will
[26:10] be. Set your
[26:12] [Music]
[26:14] wings to the winds of faith.
[26:21] You can
[26:23] [Music]
[26:25] fly in a higher

[28:28] For the

[30:01] [Music]
[30:10] heads. Think on these
[30:13] words with your heads
[30:15] bowed. For this Melzdc, king of
[30:18] Salem, prince, priest of the most high
[30:22] God, who met Abraham, returning from the
[30:24] slaughter of the kings, and blessed him,
[30:27] to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part
[30:29] of all, first being by interpretation
[30:32] king of righteousness, and after that
[30:35] also king of Salem, which is king of
[30:37] peace, without father, without mother,
[30:41] without
[30:42] descent, having neither beginning of
[30:44] days nor end of life,
[30:46] but made like unto the son of God,
[30:50] abideth a priest continually. Now
[30:53] consider how great this man was unto
[30:57] whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the
[31:00] tenth of the
[31:02] spoils. Our heavenly
[31:05] father, open your word, father, to us,
[31:08] the meaning of your word this morning.
[31:11] And Lord, as we're
[31:14] here, there are needs within our congre
[31:18] congregation. And Father, I pray
[31:21] that as we leave today, that there would
[31:24] be every single need
[31:27] met. And Lord, that you would have your

[33:04] have you
[33:04] [Applause]
[33:07] back. It's good to be in the house of
[33:09] the Lord this morning. I uh I wanted to
[33:12] mention uh yesterday was a is a tragic
[33:15] event that um we all are aware of it,
[33:19] I'm sure, about uh Donald Trump and and
[33:22] how that was an attempted assassination
[33:24] on him. He was hit by a bullet. Um and
[33:28] uh then finding out late last night who
[33:31] the shooter was. He's a young man, 20
[33:33] years
[33:34] old. And uh you
[33:37] think about this and I've mentioned
[33:41] quite a few times about this this
[33:42] contention that we have in politics
[33:44] today. I believe it's it's great and
[33:46] it's probably greater than this country
[33:48] has ever seen and the hatred on either
[33:51] side. so much so that that you would
[33:55] attempt to kill another person. And
[33:59] brothers and sisters, there's only one
[34:02] um thing besides politics that I see
[34:06] that brings a a greater response and
[34:10] than divi division over politics and
[34:12] that's really division over
[34:15] religion. a
[34:17] Christian. These things, these
[34:20] these politics, they divide us. And even
[34:23] our faith, what we call our faith and
[34:26] our religion, it divides us. But a true
[34:29] Christian should never succumb to that
[34:32] hatred and never succumb to that that
[34:35] feeling of animosity toward each other.
[34:37] We should, if you believe in Jesus
[34:39] Christ, who I assume that we do, you
[34:41] should love your enemies. Not just love
[34:44] those that believe like you. Not just
[34:46] pray for those that believe like you,
[34:48] not just pray for those that are in this
[34:50] church, but we pray for those as Jesus
[34:52] taught that hate us.
[34:55] And if we had that spirit, there would
[34:59] be no division. And if there was a group
[35:00] that truly had that spirit and truly
[35:04] loved one another and prayed for one
[35:06] another even if they hate us then this
[35:12] world would be a much better place and
[35:14] we would not see I don't believe that we
[35:16] would see the divisions that we see in
[35:18] politics right
[35:19] now. Shooting a man he was just a
[35:23] fraction away from being killed. It's it
[35:28] was nothing but the hand of God and even
[35:30] he said it that it was nothing but the
[35:33] hand of God that helped him that
[35:35] protected him and I believe it's God's
[35:39] hand is still on this
[35:41] country. I love this country.
[35:45] We should not just pray for the one that
[35:48] we want to win but we should pray for
[35:51] all of our leaders. And that includes
[35:53] Joe Biden. Amen. He's a He's a man that
[35:56] I might not agree with politically. I
[35:58] might not agree with morally, but he is
[36:00] the leader of our country and he is
[36:02] worthy of our prayers because the Bible
[36:04] commands us to pray. And let me tell
[36:06] you, if he prospers and he succeeds with
[36:09] the country, then it trickles down to us
[36:11] and we all succeed also.
[36:14] And we should also pray, of course, pray
[36:16] for Donald Trump and and what's going on
[36:19] there. Pray that the peace of God would
[36:22] reign.
[36:23] That's what we want and that is what I
[36:26] believe that's what God wants.
[36:29] Last uh last week I want to I want to
[36:32] review of what we went over last week.
[36:33] For the the visitors that are here,
[36:34] we've been going through the book of
[36:35] Hebrews. We started in chapter 1 and
[36:38] we're going through we got through
[36:39] chapter 6 last Sunday. This morning
[36:42] we'll we'll get to chapter 7, but I want
[36:45] to review what we went over last week.
[36:47] So let's go to Hebrews chapter 6 verse 1
[36:50] and let's do a short review of of
[36:52] chapter 6. Therefore, leaving the
[36:55] principles of the doctrine of Christ,
[36:57] let us go on unto perfection, not laying
[37:00] again the foundation of repentance from
[37:01] dead works and faith towards God.
[37:03] Remember this, the author is saying
[37:06] here, don't rehash what the Messiah is
[37:09] supposed to be and keep going and and
[37:11] arguing over is he going to be the son
[37:12] of David? Is he going to be the son of
[37:14] Joseph? What is he going to be a great
[37:16] military leader? Listen, he's already
[37:17] come. We don't have to resurrect this
[37:19] stuff and continue to to beat a dead
[37:21] horse. We know. We know who this man,
[37:24] the Messiah, is he is Jesus Christ.
[37:28] Of the doctrine of baptisms and on
[37:30] laying on of hands. That word baptism is
[37:33] also washing, ceremonial washing, and on
[37:36] laying on the hands and resurrection of
[37:37] the dead and of eternal judgment. And
[37:39] this will we do if God permit. For it is
[37:42] impossible for those who were once
[37:43] enlightened, and have tasted of the
[37:45] heavenly gift, and were made partakers
[37:46] of the Holy Ghost, and have tasted of
[37:48] the good word of God, and the powers of
[37:51] the world to come, if they shall fall
[37:53] away to renew them again unto
[37:55] repentance, seeing they crucify to
[37:58] themselves the son of God aresh, and put
[38:00] him to an open shame. If you remember
[38:03] last week, I told a story, and I didn't
[38:06] finish my story. I got into into the
[38:09] word and what we were doing and uh and I
[38:12] forgot to uh to close out the story. Do
[38:15] you remember when I talked about last
[38:17] week? We're at camp and there was a
[38:21] young man that really wanted nothing to
[38:23] do with God, wanted nothing to do with
[38:26] religion, was just there because his
[38:27] parents made him go.
[38:30] and he in the service and the final the
[38:34] closing day he was sitting um in the
[38:38] congregation and they dismissed the
[38:40] service while he was the last one and he
[38:42] was just sitting there all by himself in
[38:44] the chairs. So I went down and I sat
[38:48] next to him and the Lord was really
[38:51] dealing with a young man. We went into a
[38:54] uh another area, a little uh tent that
[38:56] we had set up for prayer. And he he he
[39:00] was back and forth and and really he was
[39:02] torn from giving his heart to the Lord
[39:05] or staying in the position that he was
[39:08] at. Well, he ended up giving his heart
[39:11] to the Lord. And I told the story of how
[39:14] while I was speaking to him, I told him
[39:17] that the Lord wanted to fill him with
[39:19] the Holy Spirit. and I heard a scream of
[39:24] an
[39:25] eagle and he didn't seem to hear it and
[39:29] it really kind of freaked me out because
[39:31] I thought I actually heard it and then I
[39:34] was thinking well this is this must be a
[39:36] spiritual thing. So we were going on and
[39:40] then I told him the story of the and I
[39:45] didn't tell this part because I didn't
[39:46] finish my story. I told him the story of
[39:48] the the chicken or the the eagle in the
[39:51] hen house and and and with a bunch of
[39:54] with a bunch of chickens because the
[39:56] farmer had taken the egg and and put it
[39:58] with the chickens to hatch it and he was
[40:00] this oddlooking chicken. And I said,
[40:02] "What happened? You what just happened
[40:05] when the Holy Spirit came into that
[40:06] room? What just happened was you
[40:09] realized that you were an eagle and you
[40:12] spread those eagle wings for the first
[40:14] time and then it screamed
[40:19] again. And I was like, "This is
[40:22] something that I've never experienced."
[40:25] And I looked at him like, "Did you hear
[40:27] that?" And he looked back at me and I
[40:29] obviously didn't hear it. So the young
[40:32] man um was so excited and and really
[40:35] gave his heart to the Lord. And what I
[40:36] forgot to say last week, and sometimes
[40:39] when we tell these stories, sometimes we
[40:42] leave parts out and we we tell them um
[40:46] slightly differently. They're all right,
[40:49] but we point out certain subjects. And
[40:51] many
[40:53] times ministers, especially like William
[40:56] Brandham, they get criticized for
[40:59] telling a story differently over time.
[41:02] And brothers and sisters, it is
[41:04] impossible to tell it exactly the same
[41:07] every time. You I was
[41:09] there and this is one of the greatest
[41:12] experiences I've ever had in my life.
[41:13] And I left out this part that I'm about
[41:15] to tell you. So, we
[41:18] were we came out of the tent and and
[41:21] then I was pretty shaken up and so I
[41:23] wasn't talking and and all of the um
[41:26] like the the the ushers were around the
[41:29] um chaperrons and I'm
[41:32] just like, whoa, this is this is wild.
[41:36] This is uh something I've never
[41:37] experienced. I wasn't telling anybody.
[41:39] And then I heard one of the other
[41:42] brothers say, "Hey, did you
[41:46] see while we were baptizing over across
[41:49] the lake, did you see that bald eagle
[41:53] flying around the prayer tent?" So, it
[41:57] was real.
[41:58] It was a real bird that was flying. And
[42:01] what I was hearing, it wasn't something
[42:03] necessarily that was supernatural. It
[42:05] was supernatural, but I was actually
[42:07] hearing a real eagle. So that was that I
[42:11] wanted to I wanted to make that right
[42:12] with everyone and wanted to finish that
[42:14] story. But later this young man and the
[42:17] main part of the story was later this
[42:18] young man drifted back away even with
[42:22] that powerful experience and it was one
[42:24] of the most powerful if not the most
[42:26] powerful presence of the Lord that I
[42:28] have ever felt. And even after that, and
[42:32] he felt it as strong or stronger than I
[42:34] did. And even after that, the young man
[42:38] still drifted
[42:40] away. And that is this scripture in
[42:44] Hebrews that I just read that there you
[42:49] can have these great experiences and
[42:51] they are wonderful, but you can still
[42:54] fall back and drift away. And if there
[42:57] is no repentance in your
[42:59] heart, then you run the risk of coming
[43:05] outside of the blood of Jesus Christ and
[43:08] then there is no salvation there
[43:10] afterwards. So we have to be very very
[43:12] careful. But if there is, and I was very
[43:14] plain with this last week, if there is a
[43:17] repentance in your heart, then there is
[43:21] still grace to be had. Amen. So always
[43:24] brothers and sisters never let never
[43:28] become so come so far away from God that
[43:31] you become so hard to the Holy Spirit
[43:33] and there is no repentance inside of you
[43:37] because then you run a very very serious
[43:41] risk for the earth. Verse number seven.
[43:44] For the earth drinks in the rain that
[43:45] often comes upon it and bears herbs
[43:47] useful for those by whom it is
[43:49] cultivated receives the blessing from
[43:52] God. But if it bears thorns and briars
[43:55] and it is rejected and near to be
[43:57] cursing whose end is to be burned.
[44:00] Again, we talked about this last week.
[44:01] So the the wheat and the weeds they grow
[44:05] together and then later God will
[44:08] separate those. One he brings into
[44:12] eternal glory and the other he brings
[44:15] into eternal separation from God which
[44:17] is hell to be burned. It's very very
[44:20] these these stakes are very high. Many
[44:22] ministers, many churches don't talk
[44:24] about hell but as I've said before,
[44:26] Jesus talked more about hell than he did
[44:28] about heaven. He was warning the people.
[44:31] He cared about them. Verse 11. And we
[44:35] desire that every one of you do show the
[44:37] same diligence to the full assurance of
[44:38] hope until the end. That you be not
[44:40] slothful, but followers of them who
[44:43] through faith and patience inherit the
[44:46] promises. So, so those who are living
[44:48] the Christian life, they are our
[44:51] examples. For when God made a promise to
[44:54] Abraham, because he could swear by no
[44:56] greater, he swear by himself, saying,
[44:58] "Surely saying, surely blessing I will
[45:01] bless thee, and multiplying I will
[45:02] multiply thee." And so after he had
[45:05] patiently endured, he obtained the
[45:07] promise. For men verilely swear by the
[45:10] greater and and an oath for confirmation
[45:14] to them an end of all strife, wherein
[45:17] God willing more abundantly to show unto
[45:20] the heirs of promise the immut
[45:23] immutability, that is the unchanging
[45:26] nature of his counsel, confirmed it by
[45:29] an oath, that by two immutable
[45:31] unchanging things in which it was
[45:34] impossible for God to lie, that we might
[45:36] have a strong consolation, who have fled
[45:39] for refuge to lay hold upon the hope
[45:41] that is set before us. Which hope we
[45:44] have as an anchor of the soul, both sure
[45:47] and steadfast, and which enterth into
[45:50] that into that within the veil, whether
[45:54] the forerunner is for us entered, even
[45:58] Jesus made a high priest forever after
[46:02] the order of
[46:05] Melzdc. This next chapter concentrates
[46:09] on Melzdc and Melzdc's a bit of a
[46:13] controversial person in the Old
[46:15] Testament. Very little is written.
[46:17] There's only two scriptures in the Old
[46:19] Testament about this man. Some people
[46:22] say that he is what's called a
[46:25] christophony, which is Christ
[46:28] manifesting himself in the Old
[46:30] Testament. Brother Brandham said that
[46:33] that was true. He called it a theophony
[46:36] of Jesus Christ manifesting itself to
[46:41] Abraham. And it's my question is, is
[46:47] this
[46:50] manifestation isn't an isolated incident
[46:53] that happened just with
[46:56] Abraham?
[46:58] And what about me? And what about
[47:03] you? Is there a Daniel
[47:06] Evans that is out somewhere else like
[47:11] there was a Jesus Christ? And when Jesus
[47:14] came to Abraham, which we'll talk about
[47:18] here in a
[47:19] moment, and spoke to
[47:21] him, what about all of us?
[47:26] Is there another form of each of us,
[47:29] especially that is in the presence of
[47:31] God? And does this person that's here
[47:33] right now that you're looking at in the
[47:35] pulpit or the people out in the
[47:37] audience, do those people, is that the
[47:40] real
[47:41] you or is there something else going on
[47:43] right
[47:44] now? And I
[47:48] suggest, and I'm pretty sure, and you'll
[47:51] see why here in a minute, that there is
[47:55] a
[47:56] representative for every child of
[47:59] God that is out
[48:02] there and it is sometimes manifested as
[48:08] Jesus's was to Abraham.
[48:13] Jesus said, let's go of Matthew chapter
[48:17] 18 says this verse
[48:20] one. At the same time came the disciples
[48:23] unto Jesus, saying, who is the greatest
[48:25] in the kingdom of heaven? And Jesus
[48:27] called a little child unto him, and set
[48:30] him in the midst of them, and said,
[48:31] verily I say unto you, except you be
[48:33] converted and become as little children,
[48:36] ye shall not enter into the kingdom of
[48:38] heaven. Whosoever shall humble himself
[48:40] as this little child, the same is the
[48:43] greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And
[48:46] who so shall receive one such little
[48:50] child in my name receives
[48:52] me, but who so shall offend one of these
[48:56] little ones which believe in
[49:01] me. Very, very important part of this
[49:05] entire scripture. probably the most
[49:07] important part. But who so shall offend
[49:10] one of these little ones which believe
[49:13] in me? It were better for him that a
[49:15] millstone were hanged about his neck and
[49:17] that he were drowned into the depth of
[49:19] the sea. Woe unto the world because of
[49:21] offenses. For it must needs be that
[49:24] offenses come, but woe unto that man by
[49:27] whom the offense come. Wherefore, if thy
[49:31] hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them
[49:33] off and cast them from me. It is better
[49:35] for thee to enter into the into into
[49:38] life halt or maimed rather than having
[49:40] two hands or two feet and be cast into
[49:42] everlasting fire. And if thy hand or if
[49:46] thy eye offend thee, pluck it out and
[49:48] cast it from thee. It is better for thee
[49:50] to enter into life with one eye rather
[49:53] than having two eyes to be cast into
[49:55] hell fire. How high are the
[49:58] stakes? Jesus is using a hypothetical
[50:01] example and saying basically cut off
[50:03] anything that causes you to sin. It's
[50:06] not worth
[50:08] it. And watch the theme here that we
[50:12] need to become a little child like a
[50:15] little child and one that believes in
[50:18] Jesus Christ and never offend a
[50:21] believer. For it would be better that
[50:23] you would have a stone tied to your neck
[50:25] and you cast into the bottom of the sea
[50:26] than to offend one of these little ones.
[50:30] Why? Next verse, listen to this. Take
[50:34] heed that you despise not one of these
[50:36] little ones. For I say unto you that in
[50:41] heaven their
[50:43] angels do always behold the faith of my
[50:47] father which is in
[50:49] heaven. What a statement. So even these
[50:52] little child that that Jesus took these
[50:55] these children and he says you have to
[50:56] become like this
[50:58] child and never offend this child
[51:01] because this child has a representative
[51:05] in heaven right now that is in the
[51:08] presence of God and beholding his face.
[51:11] So there is a connection between this
[51:14] child and that child that's in
[51:17] heaven. What about me?
[51:21] Do I have something that is also
[51:24] beholding the face of God like these
[51:26] child these children that that Jesus
[51:28] said? I believe I do. And I believe
[51:31] every person that believes in Jesus
[51:33] Christ that truly gives their heart over
[51:35] to them that is truly a child of God. I
[51:38] believe that we have a representative
[51:40] over there.
[51:44] There was a there's a story in the
[51:47] Bible of um when Peter when James the um
[51:52] after
[51:53] Jesus the Roman soldiers they killed
[51:56] James the apostle and they saw that it
[51:59] pleased the Jews. So they said hey this
[52:02] Jesus is or this Peter is more important
[52:04] than James. So they grabbed Peter and
[52:07] they were going to do the same to Peter
[52:09] the next day. So Peter is bound. He's in
[52:14] chains. He's in prison. And he's
[52:17] sleeping between two
[52:19] soldiers. And he's laying there. And in
[52:22] the middle of the night, an angel comes
[52:25] to
[52:26] Peter. Wake up. Get up and let's go. His
[52:32] ch his chains fall off of him. He gets
[52:35] up. And he follows the angel out of the
[52:38] prison. He takes a cloak. He puts it
[52:41] puts it over his head and he's walking
[52:42] out. He follows the angel out. The angel
[52:44] disappears and he goes to the house of
[52:47] his friends where they are praying for
[52:49] him. He gets there, door's locked,
[52:53] knocks on the
[52:57] door. Roa, a young lady, comes to the
[53:00] door. She listens and he's like, "Open
[53:03] the
[53:04] door. It's me, Peter." She's like,
[53:07] "Whoa." So she goes over, tells her
[53:09] friend. She doesn't open the door. It's
[53:10] like, "Why didn't you open the door,
[53:11] Roa?" But she goes to her friends and
[53:14] she says, "Hey, we're all praying.
[53:16] Peter's at the door." They're like, "No,
[53:17] no, he's not. He's in prison." No, he's
[53:20] there. No, he's not. He's in prison. She
[53:22] goes
[53:23] back. Yep. That's Peter. I hear him.
[53:27] They go back. And then they say
[53:30] this. They said, They said unto her,
[53:33] "You're mad."
[53:36] But she said and she constantly affirmed
[53:39] that it was even so. So then they said
[53:42] it is his
[53:45] angel. What does that
[53:47] mean? An angel can knock on the
[53:50] door. Obviously it wasn't. It was really
[53:53] Peter. So we see that they had an
[53:55] understanding of this that there is
[53:58] another being besides the one that is
[54:00] right here.
[54:02] In Job, it says this that there was a
[54:04] day when the sons of God came to present
[54:06] themselves before the Lord and Satan
[54:09] also came with them. So those sons of
[54:11] God that were presenting themselves
[54:14] before God and it happens a couple times
[54:16] in Job, who were
[54:19] they? They were
[54:23] us. They were people that lived on
[54:26] earth. I don't know when time. I I don't
[54:28] understand it. Neither does anyone else.
[54:31] But it was a
[54:33] representative on in
[54:36] heaven of something that was going on in
[54:41] earth and there was Satan there too and
[54:43] he was among
[54:45] them. So what about this man
[54:50] Melzdc? Who is this? I would recommend
[54:53] that the church listen to a sermon
[54:56] titled Who is this Melzdc?
[55:00] It's it's it's beautiful. It answers a
[55:02] whole lot of these questions and it asks
[55:05] some questions that will certainly make
[55:07] you think. He said um brother Brandham
[55:11] said this in that sermon. He said, "Then
[55:15] after you recognize the very word of God
[55:18] was eagle
[55:19] food, then you left the other
[55:23] thing. You have then been formed into
[55:26] the living image of the living God. You
[55:30] heard from your theophony."
[55:34] Now, he only said that one time that I
[55:37] know of, and I'm not one to try to pick
[55:39] and choose and pull out things and try
[55:41] to make a doctrine out of them, but he
[55:43] still said it. And it's still a very
[55:47] intriguing thing that happened. That
[55:50] example with Peter, there's an example
[55:53] that we'll talk about with Abraham. And
[55:56] let me tell you an example of some of
[55:59] the things that I've witnessed. a friend
[56:01] of mine, Jewish man. He was I was very
[56:05] close with him. He had just
[56:10] received Jesus Christ as his
[56:13] savior. And his mind was just
[56:16] overwhelmed. He was born a Jew, raised a
[56:18] Jew, he was a devout Jew. And then he
[56:21] reads this New Testament and he sees
[56:23] that this is Jewish. This book, this New
[56:27] Testament, they're all Jews in this.
[56:29] this is for
[56:31] us. And as and he gave his heart to the
[56:34] Lord and he is he is pondering on these
[56:38] things and he's in his apartment and
[56:42] he's sitting on the
[56:44] bed and the the door is open. Someone
[56:48] walks into the
[56:50] room and sits down next to him and he
[56:55] looked at him. He felt the weight of the
[56:59] person and the bed go down goes down.
[57:01] This was not a vision. This was a real
[57:04] person and he looked over at him and
[57:08] this person was him
[57:11] exactly exactly the same person. He
[57:14] looked at him. He didn't feel like a
[57:16] presence of God. He didn't feel anything
[57:18] strange. He looked at him and he said,
[57:20] "You're exactly
[57:23] me." This is in his home.
[57:27] And then the man
[57:29] disappears. Another friend of mine,
[57:32] completely different person, different
[57:36] part of the country. He was praying
[57:39] about things and he was laying in his
[57:43] bed on his back and he was
[57:46] praying
[57:47] and he
[57:50] felt pressure on his
[57:52] chest and he looked up and there was
[57:55] somebody looking down at him and it was
[57:58] him exactly
[58:01] himself and then the man disappeared.
[58:04] And I thought, these are these are
[58:06] strange stories. And believe me, I would
[58:08] not be telling the church these things
[58:10] if it didn't happen to
[58:13] me. I was driving
[58:16] um I was young. I was probably
[58:19] mid20s. And I was driving home from
[58:22] Jeffersonville. I was by
[58:24] myself. And uh my brother Jeremy and I
[58:27] had had gone there um to volunteer and
[58:29] work. And then he stayed and I ended up
[58:32] driving home by myself. Well, I got to
[58:34] uh uh just just east of Dallas and um I
[58:38] stopped as I was falling asleep and I I
[58:41] took about a 2-hour rest and I got back
[58:43] in the vehicle and I started driving and
[58:46] I got into Dallas. The sun was just
[58:48] coming up behind me and I'm driving and
[58:50] I'm doing probably 80 miles an hour and
[58:54] I'm still tired and I'm coming into the
[58:56] the traffic of Dallas and I fell
[59:00] asleep at the
[59:03] wheel
[59:05] and my head went
[59:08] down and I
[59:10] felt a
[59:12] punch on my shoulder on my arm twice.
[59:16] Boom.
[59:17] Boom. And I looked up and there was a
[59:21] young man looking at me. He put his
[59:23] finger up and he said, "Wake up." And he
[59:27] smiled at me. And I knew what I could I
[59:29] could feel what he was thinking. I had a
[59:31] real connection with this young man. I
[59:33] could feel that he he was saying, "I
[59:35] know that you can see me."
[59:39] And I jerked my head up and I was about
[59:42] to go under a tractor
[59:45] trailer. I was I would have died. I
[59:48] jerked back on the
[59:50] road and he was
[59:52] gone.
[59:55] And I thought, "What just happened?" And
[59:59] one thing about the young
[1:00:01] man was he had a shirt on. You'd think
[1:00:05] it'd be a robe or something like that.
[1:00:06] He had a shirt on that had a had brown
[1:00:10] stripes on it and it was a shirt exactly
[1:00:14] that I had. And I look and that man he
[1:00:18] had black curly hair unlike it is now
[1:00:20] but it used to be like that. It was
[1:00:23] great while it lasted. But uh he had my
[1:00:27] hair exactly. He even had my
[1:00:30] mannerisms. I knew who it was. I never I
[1:00:32] didn't tell I told people the testimony
[1:00:34] many times but I never told them that
[1:00:37] the shirt that he was wearing or that it
[1:00:39] was actually
[1:00:41] me. So there are these things happen
[1:00:45] brothers and sisters they
[1:00:47] happen
[1:00:49] and it one thing I I do want to say is
[1:00:53] after that
[1:00:54] happened I felt like there is nothing in
[1:00:58] the world that could ever hurt me.
[1:01:01] that God knew exactly where I was. He
[1:01:04] protected me from from a a a devastating
[1:01:06] car wreck and I
[1:01:10] knew I had such a confidence in God and
[1:01:15] how that there is nothing that can ever
[1:01:18] happen to a child of God unless God
[1:01:22] allows it. We should never
[1:01:25] fear. He is watching over us. He has
[1:01:29] angels protecting us. He He is in
[1:01:32] charge. And I had such a confidence. I
[1:01:35] remember thinking as I was driving,
[1:01:37] there is nothing that can touch me.
[1:01:41] There is nothing that can harm me. And I
[1:01:44] still feel that today. I still feel that
[1:01:46] that
[1:01:48] this body, this carnal body that is able
[1:01:52] to to die and that is able to get hurt,
[1:01:55] but it it is always protected by God
[1:01:59] until the time comes. There was a time
[1:02:02] that
[1:02:03] Moses, he had talked to God many
[1:02:06] times and there was a time that Moses
[1:02:10] asked God, he said, "Lord, I want to see
[1:02:12] your glory."
[1:02:14] He says, "I want to see
[1:02:17] you." And Moses and and God says,
[1:02:20] "Okay." He says, "Go up and stand upon
[1:02:23] this
[1:02:25] rock and hide in this clft of this
[1:02:29] rock." And he says, "I will put my hand
[1:02:32] over your face, over your eyes, because
[1:02:36] you can't look at me, but I will pass
[1:02:41] by. and then I will take my hand away
[1:02:44] and you can see my back. A spirit
[1:02:48] doesn't have a front and a back. It was
[1:02:51] a man that Moses
[1:02:54] saw. And who was that man? The very
[1:02:57] glory of God. Who was the man that Moses
[1:03:01] saw? I believe I know who it was. I
[1:03:04] believe it was the Lord Jesus Christ. in
[1:03:08] the Old Testament, hundreds of years
[1:03:10] before that, Abraham, he had just his um
[1:03:13] nephew had just been attacked by these
[1:03:17] these other kings. A king back then was
[1:03:20] was just like a governor of a city. And
[1:03:23] these governor these kings had all got
[1:03:25] together. They had attacked this place
[1:03:26] called Sodom, which where this young
[1:03:29] man, this man named Lot lived. And they
[1:03:32] took all of the people, many of the
[1:03:34] people captive. and they stole all the
[1:03:36] money and they went off. And Abraham
[1:03:39] gets a um an army together and he goes
[1:03:43] to save his son-in-law. They go to
[1:03:47] battle. They kill they they destroy the
[1:03:49] kings and the armies and they're coming
[1:03:52] back from the slaughter of these kings
[1:03:55] with all the spoil and
[1:03:57] everything. And Abraham meets this man.
[1:04:04] Genesis chapter 14 verse
[1:04:07] 18. And
[1:04:09] MelkiseDC, king of Salem, brought forth
[1:04:12] bread and wine, and he was the priest of
[1:04:15] the most high God. Now, notice it was
[1:04:18] Melzdc who gave the bread and the wine
[1:04:21] to Abraham. The last supper, Jesus gave
[1:04:26] the bread to the disciples. Jesus gave
[1:04:30] the wine to the disciples. And here
[1:04:33] Melzdc gives the bread and the wine to
[1:04:36] Abraham and he said bless and he blessed
[1:04:39] him and said blessed be Abram of the
[1:04:42] most high God possessor of heaven and
[1:04:44] earth and blessed be the most high God
[1:04:47] which hath delivered thine enemies into
[1:04:49] thine hand. And he meaning Abraham gave
[1:04:53] him Melzdc tithes of
[1:04:56] all. So Melzdc blesses Abraham not the
[1:05:00] other way around. Abraham can't bless
[1:05:03] Melzdc. And that's a very important
[1:05:05] thing to understand here. The greater is
[1:05:08] the one that gives the blessing to the
[1:05:10] lesser. Melzdc was the greater than
[1:05:13] Abraham. And this is the first place in
[1:05:15] the Bible that the tithes tithing is
[1:05:18] ever given. This is the very foundation
[1:05:20] of it right here. Abraham gave a tenth
[1:05:23] of what he had. The word tithe just
[1:05:25] means a tenth. That's you know how much
[1:05:27] do you tithe or whatever? Well, the very
[1:05:30] definition of tithe is
[1:05:33] 10%. So, let's turn now to Psalm 110,
[1:05:36] the other place where Melzdc is
[1:05:39] mentioned. The Lord said unto my Lord,
[1:05:42] Psalm 110 verse1, the Lord said unto my
[1:05:44] Lord, sit thou at my right hand until I
[1:05:47] make thine enemies thy foottool.
[1:05:51] The Lord said to my Lord, it's very
[1:05:55] strange thing, but if you'll notice, if
[1:05:57] you look, yeah, it's right. If you look
[1:06:00] here, see the see the all caps. It's
[1:06:02] actually usually small caps in the King
[1:06:04] James. The Lord said unto my Lord. So
[1:06:06] that first Lord right there, that's
[1:06:08] Yahweh. That's
[1:06:09] Jehovah. That's the I am. That's the
[1:06:12] eternal
[1:06:14] being. And he said to my my Lord, sit
[1:06:19] thou on my right hand. So what does this
[1:06:20] mean? Let's turn to Matthew chapter 22.
[1:06:22] We'll get what what Jesus said about it.
[1:06:25] Matthew 22:41 says this. While the
[1:06:27] Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus
[1:06:29] asked them, and I know I'm going through
[1:06:30] a lot of scriptures, but I hope that
[1:06:32] it's telling a story here. While the
[1:06:35] Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus
[1:06:37] asked them, saying, "What think he of
[1:06:38] Christ? Whose son is he?" They said unto
[1:06:41] him, "The son of David?"
[1:06:44] And he said unto them, "How then doth
[1:06:46] David in spirit call him Lord, saying,
[1:06:49] The Lord the Father, said unto my Lord,
[1:06:53] the Messiah, sit thou on my right hand
[1:06:55] till I make thine enemies thy foottool."
[1:06:58] If David then call him Lord, how is he
[1:07:02] his
[1:07:03] son? It's a very good question. The
[1:07:06] amplified version of that scripture says
[1:07:07] this. So then if David calls him the son
[1:07:10] of m the son the Messiah Lord then how
[1:07:13] how is he David's
[1:07:15] son and no man was able to answer him a
[1:07:18] word neither does any man from that day
[1:07:21] forth ask him any questions. It's a very
[1:07:24] interesting exchange right there. Jesus
[1:07:26] asked the Pharisees why David was
[1:07:29] referring to the me was referring to the
[1:07:32] Messiah calling him Lord. And if he was
[1:07:35] the son of David, which we know from the
[1:07:38] blessing of um Jake Jacob to Judah and
[1:07:43] if he and and and in Samuel, if he is
[1:07:46] the son of David, then how can David not
[1:07:51] be the greater?
[1:07:54] How come he didn't say my offspring or
[1:07:56] my heritage or my lineage? He didn't say
[1:08:01] that. But David called him Lord. Meaning
[1:08:03] that the son of David is greater than
[1:08:05] any king that could be in the natural
[1:08:08] natural lineage of David. So let's go to
[1:08:10] Psalm let's go to uh verse two on Psalm
[1:08:14] 110. The Lord shall send the rod of thy
[1:08:17] strength out of Zion. Rule thou in the
[1:08:20] midst of thine enemies. Thy people shall
[1:08:22] be willing in the day of thy power in
[1:08:24] the beauties in the beauties of holiness
[1:08:27] from the womb of the morning. Thou sh
[1:08:29] thou hast the due of thy youth. The Lord
[1:08:33] hath sworn and will not repent. He won't
[1:08:36] change his mind. Thou art a priest
[1:08:40] forever after the order of Melchzdc.
[1:08:43] This is speaking of the coming Messiah,
[1:08:45] which the book of Hebrews, if you've
[1:08:47] been coming to church and and on Sunday
[1:08:50] morning, we've been talking about this.
[1:08:51] The whole book of Hebrews is is telling
[1:08:54] these people that had already accepted
[1:08:56] Jesus Christ as their savior, these
[1:08:58] Jewish people, and they were starting to
[1:09:00] slip away and lose the zeal, he was
[1:09:03] bringing back to their remembrance,
[1:09:05] saying, "Hey, this man is far more than
[1:09:07] you think he
[1:09:10] is." And this
[1:09:14] Melzdc was three
[1:09:16] generations. He wasn't even in the
[1:09:17] lineage of Abraham. He was three
[1:09:20] generations before Levi was born. If
[1:09:23] you've been here, we talked about Levi
[1:09:25] and Judah, the sons of Jacob. Jacob also
[1:09:28] called
[1:09:29] Israel. Then these two in this Hebrews
[1:09:33] are the important tribes that we're
[1:09:35] talking
[1:09:37] about. So this man Melzdc was a priest
[1:09:41] really before they were
[1:09:43] priests. Levi's dad was Jacob. Jacob's
[1:09:48] dad was Isaac. Isaac's dad was
[1:09:51] Abraham. So, three
[1:09:54] generations earlier, this man was a
[1:09:57] priest. Now, let's get into Hebrews
[1:10:01] chapter 7 with that little foundation of
[1:10:03] who this man Melzdc is.
[1:10:07] For this
[1:10:08] Melzdc, king of Salem, priest of the
[1:10:11] most high God, who met Abraham,
[1:10:13] returning from the slaughter of the
[1:10:15] kings, and blessed
[1:10:16] him, to whom also Abraham gave a tenth
[1:10:19] part of all, first being inter in by
[1:10:22] interpretation the king of
[1:10:24] righteousness, and after that also the
[1:10:26] king of Salem, which is king of peace,
[1:10:29] without father, without mother, without
[1:10:31] dissent, having neither beginning of
[1:10:33] days, nor end of life, but made like
[1:10:35] unto the son of God abideth a priest
[1:10:39] continually. So this high priest never
[1:10:41] dies. And we'll dig into that in a in a
[1:10:44] little bit as we get down. But I would
[1:10:46] like to go over to
[1:10:48] John
[1:10:50] 8:51. He Jesus says this. He says,
[1:10:52] "Verily, verily, I say unto you, if a
[1:10:54] man keep my saying, he shall never see
[1:10:58] death." Then said the Jews unto him, now
[1:11:02] we know that thou hast the devil.
[1:11:03] Abraham is dead and the prophets and
[1:11:05] thou sayest if a man keep my saying he
[1:11:08] shall never taste of death. So basically
[1:11:10] they're saying Abraham and all the great
[1:11:12] men of old are dead and you show up now
[1:11:15] and you say that anyone who does what
[1:11:17] you say shall never taste
[1:11:21] death. Matthew
[1:11:23] 8 53.
[1:11:26] Now art thou greater than our father
[1:11:29] Abraham? These are the Pharisees, the
[1:11:30] Jews talking to Jesus. Art thou greater
[1:11:33] than our father Abraham which is dead
[1:11:34] and the prophets are dead? Who make it
[1:11:37] whom makest thou thyself? Jesus
[1:11:39] answered, If I honor myself, my honor is
[1:11:42] nothing. It is my father that honorth me
[1:11:44] of whom ye say that he is your God. My
[1:11:47] father stands for me. He protects me is
[1:11:51] what Jesus is saying. And he's honoring
[1:11:53] my
[1:11:54] words. Yet ye have not known him, but I
[1:11:58] know him. And if I should say, I know
[1:12:01] him not, I shall be a liar like unto
[1:12:04] you. But I know him and keep his saying.
[1:12:09] So if I said, I didn't know my father,
[1:12:12] I'd be a liar like you
[1:12:14] are. Your father Abraham rejoiced to see
[1:12:17] my
[1:12:19] day. And he saw it and was glad. So, not
[1:12:23] only did Abraham see the Messiah, but he
[1:12:26] met the very man that the Pharisees were
[1:12:28] talking to over a thousand years
[1:12:32] earlier. And then, brother, am I on the
[1:12:35] right? Do we have the wrong scriptures?
[1:12:40] John
[1:12:47] 8:51. John um 8:56 here.
[1:12:53] Yeah, there we go. Your father Abraham.
[1:12:56] So Jesus is talking. Your father Abraham
[1:12:58] rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and
[1:13:02] was glad. So not only did Abraham see
[1:13:04] the Messiah, but he met the very man
[1:13:07] that the Pharisees were
[1:13:10] talking
[1:13:11] about over a thousand years earlier. So
[1:13:15] this Jesus had already met this Abraham.
[1:13:19] So, as I said, some scholars call this a
[1:13:22] christophony, a an a a
[1:13:24] a manifestation of Jesus Christ in the
[1:13:27] Old Testament. We've heard it we've
[1:13:30] heard it called Christ theophony, Christ
[1:13:32] celestial body. Then said the Jews unto
[1:13:35] him, "Thou art not yet 50 years old, and
[1:13:39] hast hast thou seen Abraham?" Jesus said
[1:13:42] unto them, "Verily, verily, I say unto
[1:13:44] you, before Abraham was, I am." How
[1:13:48] could Jesus say
[1:13:50] that? He was a young man. He was 32, 33
[1:13:54] years old. And he said, "Before Abraham
[1:13:56] was, I
[1:13:57] am." And number one, when Moses asked
[1:14:01] who Jehovah was, Jehovah said, "I am
[1:14:06] that I
[1:14:07] am." And then Jesus says, "Before
[1:14:11] Abraham was, I am."
[1:14:16] Same one that Jehovah told Moses, "I
[1:14:18] am." Here is Jesus telling the
[1:14:20] Pharisees, "I
[1:14:22] am." Same
[1:14:24] one. Then took they up stones and ca to
[1:14:27] cast him out to cast at him. But Jesus
[1:14:30] hid himself and went out of the temple
[1:14:32] going through the midst of them. So that
[1:14:33] and so passed by. So why would they have
[1:14:36] stoned Jesus for saying that? They were
[1:14:39] going to stone him because he was saying
[1:14:42] that I am God.
[1:14:45] And they knew that. So they were going
[1:14:48] to kill Jesus for saying that because if
[1:14:51] you're not God, that would make you a
[1:14:54] blasphemer. But he was
[1:14:57] God. So let's go back to Hebrews 7. And
[1:15:00] I promise I'll stay
[1:15:03] there. And so this is such a beautiful
[1:15:06] subject with Jesus. Jesus is everywhere.
[1:15:10] And this man who the author of this
[1:15:12] whether it's the Apostle Paul or whoever
[1:15:14] it might have been he is showing Jesus
[1:15:17] all over the Bible and he's saying
[1:15:20] listen he's great he is greater than you
[1:15:23] could ever imagine
[1:15:25] for this Melzdc king king of Salem
[1:15:27] priest of the most high God who met
[1:15:29] Abraham returning from the slaughter of
[1:15:31] the kings and blessed him to whom also
[1:15:34] Abraham gave a tenth part of all first
[1:15:36] being by interpretation king of
[1:15:38] righteousness and after that also king
[1:15:40] of Salem which is king of peace. Isaiah
[1:15:44] said that he'd be called counselor,
[1:15:45] prince of peace, mighty God, everlasting
[1:15:48] father, without father, without mother,
[1:15:51] without descent, having neither
[1:15:52] beginning of days nor end of life, but
[1:15:55] made like unto the son of God abideth a
[1:15:58] priest continually.
[1:16:02] It says
[1:16:03] here that being made like unto the son
[1:16:08] of God. Every other translation says
[1:16:12] that he resembled the son of God. He or
[1:16:16] he resembled the son of God. So Melzdc
[1:16:19] looked like the son of God. It was him.
[1:16:24] If he looks like
[1:16:25] him in just a different form because
[1:16:29] Jesus had a beginning of days. He was
[1:16:31] born in a manger in Bethlehem and he had
[1:16:33] an end of life. He was crucified and
[1:16:35] died. Now consider how great this man
[1:16:38] was unto whom even the patriarch Abraham
[1:16:40] gave at the tenth of the
[1:16:43] spoils. So in chapter six before he laid
[1:16:46] the foundation of Abraham receiving the
[1:16:48] promise and sticking to the promise of
[1:16:50] God and laying his son on the altar to
[1:16:52] sacrifice him. So there is a
[1:16:54] relationship here between God and
[1:16:56] Abraham and even God calls Abraham his
[1:16:58] friend.
[1:17:00] So Abraham along with Moses they are
[1:17:03] really the greatest prophets in the Old
[1:17:05] Testament but the author is saying that
[1:17:07] Abraham paid tithes to this man
[1:17:11] Melzdc. So this man Melzdc was greater
[1:17:14] than
[1:17:16] Abraham. And verily they that are the
[1:17:19] sons of Levi who received the office of
[1:17:21] the priesthood have a commandment to
[1:17:23] take tithes of the people according to
[1:17:25] the law that is of their brethren though
[1:17:28] they come out of the loins of Abraham.
[1:17:30] But he whose descent is not counted for
[1:17:33] them. Melchazdc received tithes of
[1:17:37] Abraham and blessed him that had the
[1:17:39] promises. and without all without all
[1:17:42] contradiction the less the less is
[1:17:46] blessed of the better. So he's saying
[1:17:50] that the
[1:17:51] superior will give the blessing to the
[1:17:55] lesser person. Again he's separating
[1:17:57] Abraham and the prophets from this man
[1:17:59] Jesus Christ. This man Jesus Christ he's
[1:18:02] saying is is is far
[1:18:05] better. And here
[1:18:08] men that die receive
[1:18:10] tithes, but there he receiveth them of
[1:18:14] whom it is witnessed that he lives
[1:18:17] forever. Let me read the amplified
[1:18:20] version of that. It says this.
[1:18:21] Furthermore, here in the Levitical
[1:18:23] priesthood, tithes are received by men
[1:18:25] who are subject to death. But in that
[1:18:28] case concerning Melzdc, they are
[1:18:30] received by one of of who it is
[1:18:33] testified that he lives perpetually.
[1:18:36] This priest never
[1:18:41] dies. And as I may say, I may so say,
[1:18:45] Levi also who received who receiveth
[1:18:48] tithe paid tithe in
[1:18:50] Abraham, for he was yet in the loins of
[1:18:52] his father when Melzdc met him. Let me
[1:18:56] stop right there. And um I know I've
[1:19:00] I've mentioned a lot of scriptures, but
[1:19:01] they're all moving together to who this
[1:19:04] man Melzdc is. And he says
[1:19:07] here, for he was yet for this Levi was
[1:19:10] yet in the loins of his father when
[1:19:12] Melzdc me met him. So the decision that
[1:19:17] Abraham
[1:19:18] made in not only paying ties to this
[1:19:21] male man Melzdc but really accepting him
[1:19:24] for who he was. It affected Isaac his
[1:19:30] son. It affected Jacob his grandson. And
[1:19:34] the Bible says right here that it was a
[1:19:37] blessing to Levi his great
[1:19:41] greatgrandson.
[1:19:44] So, how
[1:19:45] important are the actions of us
[1:19:49] today? How
[1:19:51] important is the work that we're doing
[1:19:53] here at the Tucson Tabernacle? Not just
[1:19:56] physically, but in what we're trying to
[1:19:58] present here as Jesus Christ. It will
[1:20:01] not only affect my son
[1:20:04] Daniel, but it will affect Daniel's
[1:20:08] children. and it will affect Daniel's
[1:20:11] children's
[1:20:13] children all the way down the line. And
[1:20:16] that's what he's saying here. He's
[1:20:18] saying that that this man Abraham
[1:20:22] because of his dedication, because of
[1:20:24] his his sacrifice to the Lord and what
[1:20:28] he did for God, it affected generations
[1:20:32] down the
[1:20:33] line. So, we should always be careful.
[1:20:37] always put God first in everything that
[1:20:39] we're doing. You young people, as you're
[1:20:41] going up, the decisions that you're
[1:20:43] making now are going to affect your
[1:20:44] children and your children's children
[1:20:46] and your children's children's
[1:20:49] children. That was hard to say, but you
[1:20:53] understood. It will go all the way down
[1:20:57] because of what decisions you are making
[1:21:00] today. Don't just think that they affect
[1:21:02] you.
[1:21:04] Amen. Your children, your grandchildren
[1:21:07] and on down will suffer for the wrong
[1:21:10] decisions and they will be blessed by
[1:21:13] the right
[1:21:18] decisions. Verse number 11. If therefore
[1:21:22] perfection were by were by the Levitical
[1:21:25] priesthood, for under it the people
[1:21:27] received the law, what further need was
[1:21:29] there that another priest should rise
[1:21:32] after the order of Melzdc and not be
[1:21:35] called after the order of Aaron. So are
[1:21:37] we clear? Aaron is a Levite. He was the
[1:21:41] first high priest. He was the son of
[1:21:44] Jacob. So also called Israel. So he was
[1:21:48] he was that and that priesthood went all
[1:21:51] the way down to when the the author
[1:21:53] wrote
[1:21:55] this. So why he's saying what further
[1:21:58] need was there that another priest
[1:22:00] should rise after the order of Melzdc
[1:22:02] and not be called after the order of
[1:22:06] Aaron for the priesthood being changed
[1:22:09] there there is made of necessity a
[1:22:12] change also of the law. So later on the
[1:22:14] chapter it's going to say that the law
[1:22:17] had given way later on in the book that
[1:22:20] the law gave way to something
[1:22:23] better. For he whom these things are
[1:22:26] spoken pertainth to another tribe of
[1:22:30] which no man gave attendance at the
[1:22:32] altar. I'll I'll go through this
[1:22:35] quickly. He's talking about the tribe of
[1:22:36] Judah. Judah was
[1:22:39] not meant to be the priesthood. That was
[1:22:42] Levi. But he's saying right here that it
[1:22:46] came through Judah. This high priest
[1:22:48] came through Judah. But Judah was
[1:22:50] promised to produce the
[1:22:53] Messiah. So this man Melzdc. So the
[1:22:57] burning question is his priesthood had
[1:23:00] to come from the order of a of a
[1:23:03] mysterious priest who had no
[1:23:06] lineage but was greater than all the
[1:23:08] priests and all the prophets. That was
[1:23:11] this man Melzdc. So Mary and Joseph,
[1:23:14] Jesus's earthly parents, they were from
[1:23:17] the tribe of Judah. So Jesus could be
[1:23:20] born from Judah, fulfilling that part of
[1:23:25] being the son of David, fulfilling that
[1:23:28] part of the prophecy. For it is evident
[1:23:30] that our Lord sprang out of Judah, of
[1:23:32] which tribe Moses spake nothing
[1:23:34] concerning the priesthood. and is yet
[1:23:36] far more evident for that after the
[1:23:38] simultude of
[1:23:40] Melchzdc there ariseth another
[1:23:43] priest who is made not after the law of
[1:23:46] carnal commandment but after the power
[1:23:48] of an endless
[1:23:50] life. So this man Melzdc who had no
[1:23:53] beginning of days or ending of life he
[1:23:55] had no earthly
[1:23:57] lineage. This priest after the order of
[1:23:59] Melzdc is eternally the high priest.
[1:24:02] That get that gets important right here
[1:24:04] as we as we wrap it up. For he
[1:24:06] testifith, "Thou art a priest even after
[1:24:08] the order of Melzdc. For there is a very
[1:24:12] so there is verily a disoling of the
[1:24:14] commandment going before the weakness
[1:24:17] and unprofitableness thereof. For the
[1:24:19] law made nothing
[1:24:21] perfect, but bringing in of a better
[1:24:25] hope did by the which we draw nigh unto
[1:24:29] God." and and in as much as not without
[1:24:33] an oath he was made priest. For those
[1:24:37] priests were made without an oath, but
[1:24:40] this with an oath by him that is that
[1:24:43] said unto him, the Lord swear and will
[1:24:46] not repent. He won't change his mind,
[1:24:48] thou a priest after the order of Melzdc.
[1:24:51] By so much was Jesus made assurityity of
[1:24:54] a better
[1:24:56] testament. And they truly were many
[1:24:59] priests because they were not suffered
[1:25:02] to continue by reason of death.
[1:25:07] So the the high priest, brothers and
[1:25:09] sisters, the high priest, he makes the
[1:25:12] atonement. He goes, and we've been going
[1:25:14] through this Hebrews book, he takes the
[1:25:16] sacrifice, but first he sacrifices for
[1:25:18] himself because he's a
[1:25:20] sinner. Then once he is made clean, he
[1:25:23] takes the sacrifice for the other
[1:25:25] people. He goes and he sacrifices that
[1:25:28] animal.
[1:25:31] But this
[1:25:32] man, because he continuthth forever,
[1:25:35] hath an unchangeable priesthood.
[1:25:37] Wherefore he is able also to save them
[1:25:39] to the uttermost that come unto God by
[1:25:41] him, seeing he live, he ever liveth to
[1:25:45] make intercessions for them.
[1:25:49] That that's my favorite part about about
[1:25:52] this whole chapter is because he is
[1:25:56] continually all the time ever living to
[1:26:00] make intercessions. He's always making
[1:26:02] intercessions for our sins all the time.
[1:26:04] It's not just once. He died once, but
[1:26:07] he's there and he's continually making
[1:26:10] that atonement for us up in heaven. So
[1:26:14] every time that I sin, I don't need to
[1:26:16] go back and and do the sacrifice again.
[1:26:19] There is a representative in heaven for
[1:26:22] me continually making an atonement. And
[1:26:25] that's the man Jesus
[1:26:27] Christ all the time. So when I sin,
[1:26:31] which I do daily, we sin, there is a
[1:26:34] Jesus Christ up there making atonement
[1:26:37] for that sin. He always lives to make
[1:26:40] intercessions for those he saves. Jesus
[1:26:42] never stops interceding by the grace of
[1:26:44] God. He'll never stop. He never stops
[1:26:48] protecting us. He never stops making
[1:26:50] atonement. He ever liveth to make
[1:26:54] intercessions. My salvation, and so is
[1:26:57] yours, is dependent on Christ's constant
[1:27:02] intercession. Do you remember the
[1:27:04] vision? We played a a a sermon the other
[1:27:07] Wednesday night. Do you remember the
[1:27:09] vision that brother Brandham had when he
[1:27:11] walked into the restaurant and they were
[1:27:13] drinking and playing the slot machines
[1:27:15] and there was this woman and and he
[1:27:16] described her and how she was dressed
[1:27:18] terrible and everything about her just
[1:27:20] seemed bad and he said, "Lord, why don't
[1:27:22] you just destroy all of this?" And then
[1:27:25] he saw the
[1:27:27] vision and
[1:27:29] there was Jesus Christ. And every time
[1:27:33] that he would sin, it would punch Jesus
[1:27:37] and bruise him and he would take the
[1:27:39] punch constantly all the time. Do you
[1:27:43] remember that vision? And he was always
[1:27:46] taking he was constantly the vision was
[1:27:49] perfectly in line with this chapter of
[1:27:52] Hebrews. He was always taking that punch
[1:27:57] for the sinner, for all of
[1:28:03] us. Go back to chapter six. But brothers
[1:28:06] and sisters, if we don't see our sins
[1:28:07] and there's no repentance for those
[1:28:09] sins, then we do run the risk of coming
[1:28:12] outside the blood of Jesus Christ. There
[1:28:14] needs to be repentance in us.
[1:28:17] For such a high priest became us, who is
[1:28:20] holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from
[1:28:23] sinners, and made higher than the
[1:28:25] heavens. Another translation said, "Such
[1:28:28] a high priest truly meets our need, one
[1:28:30] who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart
[1:28:34] from sinners, exalted above the heavens,
[1:28:36] who needeth not daily as those high
[1:28:39] priests to offer up sacrifices, first
[1:28:41] for his own sins, and then for the sins
[1:28:44] of the people, then for the peoples. For
[1:28:47] this he died once, when he offered up
[1:28:49] himself."
[1:28:52] For the law maketh men high priests,
[1:28:54] which have an have infirmity, but the
[1:28:58] word of the oath which was since the law
[1:29:01] maketh the son who consecrated forever
[1:29:05] more. So the law brought by Moses, it
[1:29:09] makes high priests from men who have all
[1:29:12] kinds of weaknesses.
[1:29:14] But the word of the oath which came
[1:29:16] later than the law appoints a son, the
[1:29:20] son of God who has been made perfect
[1:29:23] forever. He is the atonement for our
[1:29:25] sins and he is always making that
[1:29:27] atonement. He died once but he's
[1:29:30] continually advocating for us. Amen.
[1:29:33] That is Hebrews chapter 7. That's this
[1:29:36] Melzdc. If you can come in
[1:29:40] closing, let's go
[1:29:43] back to the thought that we have a
[1:29:49] representative that is now in the
[1:29:52] presence of God
[1:29:54] and that influences what we are here. Uh
[1:30:00] people go too far and they they start
[1:30:02] they start making a doctrine out of this
[1:30:04] and then and then they'll they'll go off
[1:30:06] in certain ways and and when when you
[1:30:08] get out when your focus loses when you
[1:30:12] lose your focus on Jesus Christ that's
[1:30:14] when you're able to stray from the road.
[1:30:18] And in me telling those stories those
[1:30:20] all those stories actually happened. two
[1:30:22] brothers that I I know pretty well and I
[1:30:26] trust them and then it happened to me
[1:30:29] and I saw that. Can I explain it? I
[1:30:31] can't. But there
[1:30:34] was there is another person there and I
[1:30:38] believe that's a person that doesn't
[1:30:40] grow old. I believe that's a person that
[1:30:43] I really believe that's in the presence
[1:30:45] of God. Now, as Jesus said, those little
[1:30:49] children, even even these kids here, if
[1:30:53] they're believers in Jesus Christ, they
[1:30:55] have a representative up there. And
[1:30:58] Jesus said, "Be careful what you say to
[1:31:01] them. Be careful not to offend even the
[1:31:04] even the
[1:31:05] kids because their angel in heaven is
[1:31:09] now
[1:31:11] beholding the face of God."
[1:31:15] So, we should never, brothers and
[1:31:18] sisters, if you truly are, if you're
[1:31:20] truly a believer, we should never fear.
[1:31:23] I remember when that happened to me,
[1:31:25] there was no fear whatsoever. And it's
[1:31:29] because I knew that God loved me. I knew
[1:31:31] that God was with me. And if we put
[1:31:34] these things before him, he is the high
[1:31:37] priest that is willing to take the
[1:31:39] punches for us, to stand for us.
[1:31:43] And we should give him everything that
[1:31:46] we have. We should put it all into Jesus
[1:31:50] Christ. And this book of Hebrews, it's a
[1:31:54] masterpiece. If you read it, we went
[1:31:57] through a lot of scriptures and I didn't
[1:31:59] touch the
[1:32:00] surface of the depth that the author is
[1:32:05] going back into the Old Testament and
[1:32:08] bringing these things out and he's
[1:32:10] giving these people in their church
[1:32:12] services. He's giving them something to
[1:32:15] study and he's saying, "Look how great
[1:32:18] this man
[1:32:19] is. You don't look don't get off of the
[1:32:22] path. looked to this
[1:32:25] man. He spoke to
[1:32:28] Abraham. The man that was that was that
[1:32:32] many of them
[1:32:33] knew the author saying this man spoke to
[1:32:37] Abraham. He was after that order of
[1:32:39] Melzdc. He was that priesthood. And this
[1:32:43] man Melzdc the reason his priesthood is
[1:32:45] so important that priest makes
[1:32:47] atonement for the sinner. But this man
[1:32:51] Melzdc, he is eternal. He didn't have a
[1:32:55] beginning. He didn't have an
[1:32:56] end. He is always there for
[1:33:01] us. It's Jesus just in a different
[1:33:06] manifestation. And he
[1:33:09] is
[1:33:10] everything. He's wonderful. Daniel,
[1:33:16] I just want to speak the name of Jesus
[1:33:23] over every heart in every mind.

[1:37:00] presence. I speak
[1:37:03] Jesus. Amen.
[1:37:06] [Music]
[1:37:08] Whether we're praying, whether we're
[1:37:10] we're singing, or whether we're digging
[1:37:13] deep like today into scriptures all
[1:37:16] throughout this
[1:37:18] Bible, Jesus Christ is in it
[1:37:22] all. We worship him. We learn more about
[1:37:27] him. And brothers and sisters, he is
[1:37:29] always there for
[1:37:31] us. He's he's wonderful. Brother Daniel
[1:37:35] and sister um sister Roelly Walker,
[1:37:38] friends of um brother Tim Cruz. God
[1:37:41] bless you. Welcome. I'm sorry I didn't
[1:37:43] recognize you earlier. God bless
[1:37:45] [Music]
[1:37:49] you, brothers and sisters. Dig into this
[1:37:51] book of Hebrews. You won't be
[1:37:54] disappointed. I promise.
[1:37:57] It's this man Melzdc.
[1:38:02] He was the manifestation of something
[1:38:03] that we may not
[1:38:05] understand, but things are going on
[1:38:09] behind the scenes in the spiritual
[1:38:11] realm. And they're going on right now.
[1:38:14] And there is a battle going
[1:38:16] on. And it's a battle for the souls of
[1:38:20] men and
[1:38:22] women. And it's it's a raging battle.
[1:38:25] Satan wants those souls. Jesus Christ
[1:38:28] wants those souls. And the
[1:38:32] decision is up to us. As I've said
[1:38:35] before, we're coming up on an election
[1:38:39] year. Jesus voted for me. Satan voted
[1:38:44] against
[1:38:45] me. And my destination depends on how I
[1:38:48] vote. Amen.
[1:38:50] Vote for Jesus Christ. Love him. Serve
[1:38:53] him. Do everything that you can for him.
[1:38:55] Put him first in your life. And trust
[1:38:57] him. You don't ever have to fear. If you
[1:39:00] truly trust in Jesus, he is capable. He
[1:39:03] is willing and able to take care of any
[1:39:06] problem that you may have. It might be,
[1:39:09] if you're young, it might be who you're
[1:39:11] going to
[1:39:12] marry. It might be a sickness. Whatever
[1:39:15] it is, Jesus Christ can take care of it
[1:39:19] and he will. We just lay it upon
[1:39:22] him. He said, "Take your burdens, lay
[1:39:25] them upon
[1:39:26] me." He said, "My yoke is easy. My
[1:39:29] burden is
[1:39:30] light. I can handle
[1:39:33] it. And as we get on to the last chapter
[1:39:36] of this book of Hebrews, it says that he
[1:39:38] is the same yesterday and today and
[1:39:39] forever.
[1:39:41] Let's bow our
[1:39:43] heads. Heavenly Father, we are
[1:39:47] grateful, Lord. We're grateful for for
[1:39:49] your
[1:39:50] word, for your Bible that we can dig
[1:39:53] into it. Father, we can dig deep into
[1:39:56] these scriptures and see that Jesus is
[1:39:59] everywhere.
[1:40:02] all the way from the tree of life all
[1:40:04] the way down through
[1:40:07] Melchzdc, all the way to
[1:40:10] [Music]
[1:40:12] Moses to the manifestation of of the
[1:40:16] Messiah in the in
[1:40:19] Bethlehem and then the Holy Spirit that
[1:40:22] fell
[1:40:24] upon the people from the day of
[1:40:27] Pentecost until this day. Lord, we're
[1:40:31] grateful for Jesus Christ. We're
[1:40:33] grateful for for Lord his word. We're
[1:40:37] grateful for
[1:40:38] the for the atonement. Lord, we just
[1:40:41] can't say
[1:40:43] enough. Pray for each person here that
[1:40:46] your hand would be upon them. And
[1:40:48] Father, that that you would go before us
[1:40:51] as we leave and we go to our places,
[1:40:55] Lord, that you would bless the service
[1:40:56] tonight. Bless brother Aaron as he
[1:41:00] ministers. Father, may it be a blessing.
[1:41:02] I pray we love you and we thank you in
[1:41:05] Jesus name. Amen.
[1:41:14] when he moves among us. All that he
[1:41:19] does and all of his
[1:41:23] mercy and all of his
[1:41:26] love. If the pen of a
[1:41:29] rider could write every
[1:41:33] day, even this
[1:41:36] world could never
[1:41:39] contain. Oh, how I've been blessed.
[1:41:46] The warmth in the
[1:41:49] winter, flowers in
[1:41:52] spring, laughter at
[1:41:55] summer, and changing of
[1:41:58] leaves, the food on my
[1:42:02] table, a good place to
[1:42:05] sleep, clothes on my
[1:42:08] back, shoes on my feet.
[1:42:12] I have been
[1:42:18] blessed. I have been
[1:42:20] blessed. God so good to
[1:42:24] me. Precious are his thoughts of you and
[1:42:29] me. No way I could count them. There's
[1:42:34] not enough time.
[1:42:37] So I'll just thank him for being so
[1:42:42] kind. God has been
[1:42:45] good,
[1:42:46] so
[1:42:48] good. I have been blessed.
[1:42:55] But arms that will
[1:42:57] raise, a voice that can
[1:43:00] talk, hands that can
[1:43:03] touch, legs that can
[1:43:06] walk, ears that can
[1:43:09] listen, eyes that can
[1:43:12] see. I've got to praise him. As long as
[1:43:17] I
[1:43:18] breathe, I have been blessed.
[1:43:25] A mother and father who nurtured and
[1:43:30] raised. Sisters and
[1:43:33] brothers, memories made our pastor to
[1:43:38] lead us. This altar to
[1:43:42] pray, stripes that could heal the blood
[1:43:46] that still
[1:43:48] saves. I have been blessed.
[1:43:54] And I have been blessed. God so good to
[1:43:59] me. Precious are his thoughts of you and
[1:44:05] me. No way I could count them. There's
[1:44:09] not enough
[1:44:11] time. So I'll just thank him for being
[1:44:16] so
[1:44:17] kind. God has been good.
[1:44:21] So
[1:44:23] good. I have been
[1:44:28] blessed. We live in a country. The
[1:44:32] greatest on earth where the flag stands
[1:44:36] for freedom in what is it worth. She
[1:44:41] stands in the harbor. Miss Liberty
[1:44:45] calls.
[1:44:47] All have given some but some gave it
[1:44:51] all. I have been
[1:44:57] blessed. I have been
[1:45:00] blessed. God so good to
[1:45:03] me. Precious are his thoughts of you and
[1:45:08] me. No way I could count them. There's
[1:45:13] not enough time.
[1:45:15] So I'll just thank him for being so
[1:45:20] kind. God has been
[1:45:23] good. So
[1:45:26] good. I have been blessed. Raise your
[1:45:29] hand if you've been blessed. Amen. Jesus
[1:45:33] Christ is our blessing. He's alive
[1:45:35] today. He's given us so much. Brothers
[1:45:38] and sisters, we could there's not enough
[1:45:41] words to thank him for what he's done
[1:45:43] for us. Each one of us can look into our
[1:45:45] the the history of our lives and we can
[1:45:48] see how many times he's taken care of
[1:45:50] us. And let me tell you, there's more
[1:45:52] times coming. He's going to take care of
[1:45:54] you today. He'll take care of you
[1:45:56] tomorrow. And one day soon, we will be
[1:45:59] with him in eternity. And I look forward
[1:46:02] to that day that I can just fall down
[1:46:04] out of fall down at his feet and say, "I
[1:46:07] have been blessed." And we have. God
[1:46:10] bless you, brothers and sisters. I pray
[1:46:11] that the Lord be with you. You're
