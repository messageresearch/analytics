young people can he's got a um a presentation that he's done that uh it was really a blessing to me I watched it the other day about social media and um just the Perils of social media so if the youth

um it's it's really good it's it's very interesting the um some of the things that he points out so tomorrow for the Youth we we will have another special blessing um I don't usually do this but um I'm gonna grab microphone number two here and um I can't um announce birthdays we just we can't because we we we talk about them and um I'll inevitably I'll leave someone out and and feelings get hurt and that [Laughter] sister Betty God bless your heart today is Sister Betty glidewell 89th birthday sister Betty I have a question for you I uh as I Was preparing for this sermon I was thinking about you sister Rachel she's the one that ratted You [Laughter] Out Sister Betty in in your years what have you seen in the world and in this United States and maybe in the church what have you seen change the most over over all these years I've seen a lot I've I I was raised in um sem of God church and I see how things were then and I see how things are now and I've seen people change but we also I look forward to the coming of the Lord because I believe we're in the age for that and I thank God so much that he has given me strength to be up and do what I do every day he's been real good to me and I love him God bless you 89 years old significant Sister Margaret where are you at it's your birthday too where where did you where is she where oh happy birthday God bless you um there's been a lot change I'm sure over the past 89 years and uh one of the things that I wanted to mention to the church before we the Sunday School gets back and before we have the baby dedication um one of the things that happened this past week that has just been I think a tragedy to this country and as you know I'm not I'm not a fan of of any of the politicians and I I don't really I don't really support um anyone I want what's best for this country but this past week what has happened in them trying a former president and convicting him and in the situation and and the circumstances which he was convicted brothers and sisters I think that we have seen something this week that we might look upon this 20 years from now and see that was a sign that our country was going into freefall this man Donald Trump was tried in a court we are guaranteed by our Constitution that we are guaranteed a trial by our peers and he was tried in a court in an area and this man's a politician former president and running for president right now he was tried in a place that's 95% Democrat and there's no way that he could have had a fair trial and he didn't have a fair trial these things that have happened it is it is a shame and it's a shame on our country that a politician a a government can go after a political rival in the courts like has happened and like I said before you all know me I'm not a fan of Donald Trump I don't like his arrogance I don't like his immoral living I don't like his language but it's it's wrong and to see our country now making a stand making some of the stands that we've made making a stand against Israel and Israel tell us trying to influence them not to go in and fight their enemies that came into their cities that killed their people that raped their women that burned their babies and then for us to try to use our political clout as the United States to tell them that they can't do something this is a shame this is the same country that was in Egypt that God brought down the plagues upon their their captors that God brought down turned the water into blood brought fleas and brought flies and brought hail of fire that came down and killed the firstborn son and this the history of this country and our country makes a stand and says that you can't do this trying to use our political Advantage trying to use our money and our arms to do this brothers and sisters it should not be so it is prophesied that Israel whatever blesses you will be blessed and whatever curses you will be cursed those prophecies are Eternal brothers and sisters they don't just end and we see that today and we see what's happening and we see this this election and all this fighting that's going on like I said we are in a time that has never been going after each other politically going after each other with the law and we're making all of these issues about the border and about the economy and about gun control and there's one person that we are leaving out of this and that's God God Jesus Christ should be on the ballot not all of this other nonsense and and the the election should be about who is standing the most for God and not about all these ridiculous political issues I just it makes me sad it makes me it makes me sick I uh if they would do what I just said and I know it's cliche and I I know it's easy to say but if they would put Christ first if they would put God first then they would be able to reach across the aisle like our founding fathers did and they may not have agreed but they looked and they saw what was best for the people of this country instead of just trying to get their way instead of trying to push their agenda and many times it's just little special interests things that they try to get and and like I said I'm not a political person I've only I I'll share a secret with you I think I've only voted one time in my life and it was for a a House of Representatives someone that helped us in Jeffersonville one time and and uh so I'm not I'm not a political person I'm sorry I probably should vote but um it's wrong it's wrong what this country is doing and I I worry that the direction we're headed and the Precedence is being set is going to lead to what we see now in Russia and what we see in these different countries and it's a shame it's a stain on our flag is what it is I um wanted to read something that I've been listening to um this Hebrew series from brother brandom and and if um you could put up this quote that I gave you you Brothers brother Bram said this he says and then when we see those things take place that we do see take place and done we should never let these things slip we just let it go through our fingers and that's what the that's what's the matter with this the great Pentecostal church today they've let the very cream of the crop slip through their fingers when they had it in their hands but look what they done they' done like the rest of of the churches they've run in the way of Kora and perished in the way of Cain and perished in the gang Saints of Kora they've organized instead of having Brotherhood where we could all be one they've organized themselves made little organizations and little isms and sprung up from there and just broke up the Brotherhood and if you don't watch the Baptists and the Presbyterians is going to pick it up because God is able of these stones to rise children of Abraham and we've let it slip away from the hands by being disunified how did the Indians lose this country to the white man is because they were disunified if they had been one big Forefront but they were fighting one among each other they would have had they would have held their grounds if they would have all come together how are we going to lose it because we're disunified how are we going to lose our experience with God is because we dis unify we set up one and call this the Methodist and this the Baptist and this the assemblies and this the Oneness and this something else and the Church of God and the Nazarene and the pilgrim Holiness we dis unify the body of Christ we should never be divided we might differ in ideas but let's be heart inhe heart Brothers God wants us to be he died for the entire Church of God and we do not want want to be disunified even in our little portion of the body of Christ and what do we do this one has this doctrine that one has that Doctrine and it causes us to divide it causes us to fight or brothers and sisters are we Christians are we just Christians that should unite us and that is the only thing that will ever unite the body of Christ is the man Christ Jesus no matter what what sect you're from no matter what denomination you're from no matter what he is the only one that can can that can unite us and our I fear and I I see and I I know we can all see this that the disunity that is in the body of Christ and when I say body of Christ I mean Body of Christ I don't mean the message denomination and the Baptist denomination and the Pentecostal denomination I mean Jesus I mean Christians ones that really believe Christians and believe Christ and we see that disunity and it comes all the way up to their government the Republicans and the Democrats and and fighting over these little things but if we would all put our Lord first then things would change and I just wanted to I wanted to say that before we got get started that I really believe that our country made a very very bad decision this week we saw the man we saw the manifestations of the wrong spirit and that is going after your enemies if we were Christians Jesus said to pray for your enemies Jesus said to love those that hate you and would despitefully use you where is Christianity Today there is nothing higher than the Lord Jesus and I look at it's we see it on the news and we look into all the way down and we see it in our inside of our families and it's Satan trying to get in everything and stirring everything up and cause hatred and cause disunity and cause fighting and it will never come to good it never has it never will God wants us together not an organization like I just read brother brandom said we can differ on things that's okay but when we fight against each other that's that's when we fail we uh we have a special honor this morning of being able to dedicate another child to the Lord Jesus Jesus said he said suffer the little ones to come to me and forbid them not so when they brought the the babies to Jesus they just wanted him to bless them and and the disciples were like he's busy and and they tried to cut him out and he's like no no no no no this is something that I want to do this is something he said bring them to me he said because the kingdom is like this he says if we could just be like these child brother brother Jeremy and sister Angela if you come if we could just be like these children just totally dependent on mama and daddy to take care of them if we could just be more like that then we would inherit the Kingdom then our lives would be better then everything that we have need of would be provided for [Music] us that's a good song to sing don't you sing that Jesus loves loves me this I know for the Bible tells me so little ones to him belong they are weak but he is strong yes Jesus Loves Me Oh yes Jes Jesus loves me yes Jesus loves me the Bible tells me this is cute this is Evan welcome to this world Evan now I'm going to commission you my little buddy I'm going to commission you to serve the Lord your whole life and may you be a witness to others and Lead souls to our lord Jesus Brothers and Sisters Let's bow our heads our heavenly father I hold in my hand a helpless little baby that you commanded that we should become like this baby father I pray that this baby would go forward through life if you would T and father May the holy spirit always guide him may he Lord one day be a servant of God and Lead many souls to you father We Lay this baby at your altar at your feet and ask father that your hand would be upon him all the days of his life in Jesus name amen thank you he is a cute little dude right I think I just put him on the pulpit and I'll preach with him up there cute blessy sweetheart thank [Music] you thank [Applause] you we um brother Mark we started on a a series series on the Hebrews and um we started last week we devoted part of the service to that and i' would like to continue as long as the Lord is leading let's continue on with this great book this great letter of the Hebrews and uh we will continue on um the Lord's willing we'll see how far we get through today but it's a it's a tremendous book and as we see this day approaching as we see all these problems s and that I was just talking about it's it's a time it's a time for mourning and it's a time to to to be sorrowful but it's also a time that when we see these things happening around us it's a time for us to look up because we know that our Redemption is drawing nigh and this book tells us that because of the sacrifice of one that things everything in the Bible came in order when Jesus arrived here on the scene he was the great one he was the greatest of the great let's uh let's review and let's go to Hebrews chapter 1 verse one says this God who had sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past under the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath app appointed heir of all things and by whom also he made the worlds so don't forget the author of this book he had never met Jesus In the Flesh he came to the Revelation by through someone else's um someone else's witness and then he says that God spoke to To Us by his son so this isn't Peter and James and John speaking that they could say that we are the witnesses we gave witness he he spoke to us and then we gave you all this message no this is this man is saying that God actually spoke to me by this man Jesus Christ who had already resurrected already gone up to be with the father and it's we can put ourselves in that situation now if this man who wrote the book of Hebrews can say that God spoke to him us then we can say the same who being the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins and sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on on high this man that the letter is talking about he was the brightness of the father's glory and he is the express image of his person so in the NIV version says the sun is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being that Radiance of God's glory is the shikina glory that that we hear so much about it's that it was manifested itself in the pillar of fire in the pillar of cloud when the Hebrews were coming out of Egypt that led them the author is writing to the ancestors of the ones that came out of Egypt these people called the Hebrews and he's saying that our fathers were there in Exodus 33 when God spoke to Moses out of the cloud and Moses desired to see God this was the Radiance of God that was speaking to Moses this was that shikina Glory it was the brightness of his glory and the author is saying that Jesus is the one that was that Radiance of Glory he was that shikina glory in the wilderness this man Jesus the author could not Lift Jesus any higher than he lifted him and then he goes on to say that he is the express image of God he is the exact representation of God so when you look at Jesus you're looking at god brother Josiah and I were talking in the back and and uh we were talking about something completely unrelated and brother Josiah shared a scripture with me let me read it in John chapter 1 verse 6 it says this John 1:6 there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light that is the shakor that's the radiance of God that this man John the Baptist is witnessing too that is Jesus Christ himself that was the True Light which lith every every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not that Radiance of God and the author here is speaking to this Hebrew audience and he's saying that this man was not just the Messiah maybe you don't know what the Messiah is and he goes and he writes this whole book to show us what the Messiah is in John 14 chapter 6 Jesus is speaking to Thomas Jesus saith unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh to the father but by me today we hear so much from people if you witness to someone you'll say are you a Christian and we all do or we should and the people so often they say that well I believe I believe there's a higher power or I believe that there is a God or I pray but to call themselves a Christian they always want to push it off to something else or even they'll say it happened to me the other day I I would witness to a a lady and I said are you a Christian and she said no she said I'm Catholic that's that's that's bad that's an insult no I'm not a Christian I'm a Catholic how many of us say well I'm a message believer or I'm a Baptist or I'm something else and we lessen Jesus by saying that it's always Jesus plus something I'm I'm against drawing a circle as you know I always it's it's really my Ministry it's like no Reach Out bring everybody in but the message of Jesus Christ is exclusive brothers and sisters when Jesus said that no man can come to the father except by me you know what he meant he meant no man can come to the father except by me he means that there there's only one way to come to God and that's through Jesus Christ so it's not you can't come through just saying I'm spiritual or you can't come through saying that well I believe there is a God there is only one way to God and that is through the son Jesus Christ so you can't be a devout Muslim you can't be a devout Hindu or Buddhist you you have to know Christ or you can't make it that's the Bible so not joining it not joining a denomination not accepting a certain man and not going to church but truly meeting Jesus Christ accepting him as your savior and receiving his Spirit into your heart heart that is the only way and there is no other way Jesus continues verse 7 he says if you had known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him and Philip saith unto him he's a bit confused he sees Jesus he says this man that that they knew that was the Messiah that they knew was a Son of God but there was something more even more than that and Philip was confused and he said unto him he said 'lord show us the father you're talking about the father show us the father and it sufficeth us so Philip asked Jesus he said we want to know we want to know who this Jehovah of the old Old Testament this El Shai this Elohim this Yahweh who is this Everlasting father who is this show us this man and watch how Jesus responds to the question to see the almighty God Jesus said unto him have I been with you have I been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me he's answering the question Philip is saying show us the father and he says how do you not know me he that hath seen me hath seen the father and how sayest then show us the father so right here we see that God isn't three separate but equal Gods having his own personality the son is the express image of the father they don't just bear a resemblance to each other they are the same and Jesus said that no man can come to the father except by Christ so you see brother Daniel are you saying that my friends they're good people they can't go to heaven unless they're Christians are you saying that all these people are lost or doomed because they accept something else a way of living or they accept something else for Christ are you are you saying that that's the case no I'm not saying that the Bible is saying that that's not me that is the doctrine of Jesus Christ if you don't know the bridegroom brothers and sisters then and you have not accepted him as your savior then you can't you really can't enter into the kingdom you say well I believe a prophet they said the same thing to Jesus and he said if you would have believed Moses then you would believe me because Moses wrote of me so when you make the commitment to be a Christian it should start a change in your life and I'm not talking about how you dress I'm not talking about how you look I'm not talking about all these other things I'm talking there should be a categorical change in your life where you come into the presence of the almighty God and you speak to him and he speaks back to you and then all of these other things they will change your life will change your words will change your whole being will change because now brother Mark it's not you anymore it's Jesus Christ in you that is the power of God and it's this man Jesus made it to where we could enter into that fellowship with God the father and only through one man can you do this and that man's name is Jesus I may sound simple but it gets even more simple John 3:16 Says this for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever whoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life so when so he's saying that you have to believe in this man me basically he's speaking of himself that you have to believe in Jesus to receive this everlasting life let's go on a little bit let's stay with that John 11:20 says this this is when Lazarus was sick he died Jesus waited four days and then Came John 11 11:20 says this then Martha as soon as she had heard that Jesus was coming went and met him but Mary sat still in the house then Martha then said Martha unto Jesus if thou Hast been here my brother had not died look at the faith that that sister had but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give thee Jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha saith unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me remember John 3:16 he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this she said unto him yay Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the son of God which should come into the world but we see in other places we hear so often I believe Jesus therefore John 3:16 and and this this other this John 11 therefore I fulfill that but it's more than just saying it with your mouth we see places in the Bible where Satan himself knew that Jesus was the son of God so does that mean Satan saved it doesn't but Satan knows who he is so if you say that I just I accept Jesus Satan did that there's more to it there has to be a change in our lives it's not just to say that you believe Jesus the devil say the same thing there's more you need to surrender to him and stop fighting with him remember Legion when Legion he was running around and naked and all of these problems and he was crying out thou son of the Living God and Jesus came and cast out the demons that were the demons that were saying that but we brothers and sisters we fight against God and we fight against God we get depressed we worry about our kids we worry about our jobs we we we want our kids to live up to way our way of thinking and in doing that so often we are found fighting against him because we have something in our minds that we think they should live up to or or a friend or a job or what it whatever it is we think that it should it should live up to our way of thinking and it's God that wants us to surrender and he's there but he requires a separation and he requires a surrender for us to come to him and then he will do it his way he's Sovereign he doesn't answer to us he's God friend of mine I was I was talking to a sister yesterday and she was giving me a a wonderful testimony of her son her son she was so worried about him he was in his 30s he um wasn't going to church he he didn't he couldn't hold down a a a good job that could support a family he wasn't married it was just everything that she was praying about she's like Lord help him help him to find the right girl Lord help him to find the right job Lord let him come to church and in praying and praying and all these years she was praying year after year after year praying the same thing and then she realized that she was wrong and she took in her prayers took her son and said Lord I give him to you whatever you want to do Lord I'm sorry I have been praying that he would live up to my expectations Lord here he is and then she left it there this is after years and years of praying for him she finally surrendered she was the one that was fighting against God God had a plan but our our prayers and our way hinder his plan we put him there we put our loved ones there whatever the situation is and say Lord now you have your way and right when she did that the most amazing thing started happening she started started noticing him reading this book more not by anything she did except for that prayer then he started coming to church more and then he met a good Christian girl married her and now everything is wonderful but she had it in her mind I want it to be like this but God didn't want it like that God wanted to surrender he said just lay it just give it to me come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest just give it to him the Apostle Paul he was I he was his name was Saul of Tarsus back then you think he wasn't praying when he was persecuting the Christians he was up in the San hadin Council he was a highlevel person you think that he wasn't praying you think that he wasn't reading through the scriptures and yet going after God's people and cons consenting to their deaths he had the papers in his hand from the Sanhedrin Council he was going there to Damascus and he's going to arrest these Christians and probably praying the whole time and then God by his Mercy because he saw that Saul was sincere God by his Mercy comes down says Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and he's like whoa Lord who are you and he said I am Jesus I am that I am that was in the wilderness I am that Jehovah that was there I am That shikina Glory I manifested myself in this man Jesus Christ and you're persecuting me let's go back to Hebrews 1 verse four being made so much better than the angels as Heath by inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than they For unto which of the Angels said he at any time Thou Art my son this day i' I have begotten the have I begotten thee and again I will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son the author is quoting scripture after scripture after scripture by the way and again when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world he saith and let all the angels of God worship him this man far exceeds what you think he's he is let's go to chapter two now therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we let them slip so it's it's not just being spiritual as I was talking about or believing that there is a God or saying that you're a Christian or believer or that you attend church the people reading this letter brothers and sisters were Hebrews that had already accepted Jesus Christ this isn't to a new believer this isn't to someone that didn't know Christ this is to Christians Messianic Jews ones that had accepted Christ they had probably been baptized they were attending church but sometimes we let things become common to us in the United States we can worship as we please we can come to church and we can stay home there's many freedoms that we have and really they become common to us say oh well I'll go to church this morning or yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna skip here and I I'll go there um and it becomes common to us we don't appreciate it so what does it mean to say I'm a Christian we always want to convert brother and sister we always want to convert someone to our way of thinking we always say that you have to accept Jesus but there's always a plus sign we always want something more and that's why we don't see the converts that we we should that's why it doesn't work because it's always Jesus plus something instead of Christ plus something that plus should be put first and say here this will help you come to Christ not now you've accept Jesus now you want something higher there is nothing higher than Jesus Christ remember he's God there's nothing higher than that there's if you're coming to Tucson I've used this analogy before if you're coming to Tucson and Tucson is your ultimate destination there are many roads that get to Tucson there's a road from Phoenix there's a road from Yuma there's there's a road from nogalus there's a road from Los cruus and all of these roads come to the same place and that's with Christ however whatever Road you're on make sure that that road is going to Jesus and don't get off on an exit Jesus plus something stay on that Highway and as long as the destination on that highway is Jesus Christ and knowing him and having that relationship with him then you're on the right Road you don't have to take a detour around coming from Interstate 8 and come in on a from another Direction just stay on the path and Jesus is that bridge you know there's a there's there's there's the ultimate destination which is the father and eternal life and and here is this bridge and we come across that bridge and you have to come through Jesus Christ and it's a toll bridge it's a toll road it requires a fair to be paid and as you're driving on you're getting to that destination as you're driving on you can just wave your hand and say my toll has been paid it was paid before me I come in the name of Jesus Christ and they say come on through because he's the only one that could pay the toll you might say brother we're already Christians in this room all of us here are Christians why are you always preaching Jesus to us the people reading as I said the people reading this letter to the Hebrews they were Christians too they were people they were Jews that had made a stand for Jesus Christ and they were in danger danger of their lives because of that stand which we're not the people that are receiving this letter they were they could have been killed for what they believed they were willing to sacrifice everything they were real Christians and yet the author is telling them more about Jesus therefore we ought to give the most Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast in every transgression and Disobedience received a just recompense of reward so the prophets and the ministers they brought the word in every transgression and Disobedience received punishment they didn't Escape we've gone through a good portion of the Old Testament in our Wednesday night bible study and we see that when the people sinned they were punished when the world fell into sin and violence and immorality with Noah God drowned them with Sodom when they came into sexual immorality God burned them when Judah had their sins Babylon came in took the king took his sons Nebuchadnezzar we you know the story we' we' talked about 2 Chronicles and second Kings Babylon came in killed the sons of the king said look watch killed the sons of the king then gouged his eyes out so that would be the last thing that he ever saw they were punished for their immorality and they received a just recompense of reward then how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will For unto the Angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come whereof we speak now he's going to quote another Old Testament prophecy about the Messiah but one in a certain place testifieth saying what what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visit him thou mest him a little lower than the Angels then crownest him with the glory and honor and did set him over the works of thy hands thou Hast put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under him it's a little hard to understand so I'm going to read the English Standard Version verse six brother Jordan or um Brothers if you could go back to verse six this is the English Standard Version it has been testified somewhere again the author wasn't able to look it up like we can't it has been testified some he's quoting Psalm 8 uh 4-6 has been testified somewhere what is man that you are mindful in of him or the son of man that you care for him you made him for a little while lower than the Angels you have crowned him with Glory and Honor putting everything in subjection under his feet now in putting everything in subjection to him he left nothing outside his control at present we do not yet see everything subjection in subjection to him so there's more there's still more work to do and we don't see these things now but we will see them in time to come Philippians says that he says therefore God hath highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name so that the name of Jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on Earth and under the Earth and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the father Jesus is Lord to the glory of the father but we verse number nine but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man so God in his power and His glory was able to Humble himself and become a man so that he could suffer like we suffer so that he could taste death like we taste death how can brothers and sisters how how could a father how could someone stand for us or relate to us if they' never been through it you can't you might have a problem and if I've never experienced anything like that how could I relate to it I can't I can imagine and I can I can try to help but I don't really know that's why Jesus had to be born from a woman he had to suffer hunger and sickness he had to suffer from his his friends forsaking him he had to suffer from rumors being spread about him he had to suffer all of the things that we suffer he had to suffer he had to feel Temptation like we feel temptation but he was tempted and higher than any of us because Satan knew that he was a Son of God but yet he was without sin he overcame where no Prophet No Angel no being has ever been he overcame or they couldn't overcome for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings we can all come into Glory because of this man and even he was perfected by suffering so he can know how it is to suffer as I said and for both he that sanctifieth and they who are Sanctified are all of one for one for which one caused which CA which cause he is not ashamed to call them Brethren so the author is saying here that both Christ who cleansed us and those who are cleansed have the same father mean because we have the same father as Jesus he considers us his Brethren so do you see the spirit of Joseph here in the Bible go go back to Genesis remember our Bible study and we see Joseph and how Joseph was forsaken by his Brethren and then they didn't know who he was and all of his Brethren come in to the palace and and Joseph's like he's right under the king and they come in they don't recognize him and they had forsaken him and Joseph was not ashamed of them he still called them Brethren he still loved them because they had the same father Father and Jesus and here the author is saying that we have the same father so Jesus calls us his Brethren remember the audience is Hebrews this is a Jewish way of thinking saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church I will sing praises under thee and he quotes more scriptures and again I will put my trust in him and again behold I and the children which God hath given me for as much then as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the Seed of Abraham the Seed of Abraham remember he came he's a lion of the tribe of Judah that lineage comes from Abraham his mother Mary came from the line of Judah his stepfather Joseph came from that line of of Judah and we will get to later on in the book we'll get to that no priest ever came from Judah they all came from Levi but this man was different and there's more the Apostle Paul and this is where it hits right home with us so we're talking about these Jewish people we're talking about this Jewish Heritage coming down through this line of Judah but the Apostle Paul put us right in there Galatians chapter 3: 23 but before Faith came we were kept under the law shut up under the faith which should afterwards be revealed wherefore the law was our school Master to bring us under Christ that we might be justified by faith he's talking about the writings of Moses he's talking about the law the Torah but after that faith is come we are no longer under a school Master for ye are the children of God by faith in Jesus Christ so there's no more just the he Hebrew race following the law brought by Moses for as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ that there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither Bond nor free there is neither male nor female for you are all one in Christ Jesus as I mentioned earlier you look at that your race doesn't matter your gender doesn't matter your social standing doesn't matter your denomination or your church doesn't matter you are all one if you you have accepted Christ as your savior and if you be Christ's then you are Abraham's seed and HS according to the promise so now us Gentiles we are put inside of that line and we have the same rights as the sons of Abraham had we are adopted it says in Ephesians we are grafted in however you want to say it we are part of this lineage because we believed Jesus Christ and now we are sons of Abraham let's go back to Hebrews 2:17 wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his Brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people let's break that scripture down quickly it says therefore it was essential that he had to be made like us his brothers Mankind in every respect so that he was born into the world he was crying like a baby he got cold he got sick people picked on him he tripped and he fell and he skinned his knee he he did everything that a a a young man or a baby or a teenager he was part of it all that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in the things pertaining to God he experienced these things but he didn't sin but he was he experienced them and he understood have you ever gotten advice from a minister or or from from someone else that they're going to tell you well if you're having problems with your wife or if you're having problems with your husband well just just say this just tell him that or or you need to put the you need to lay down the law brother and you're you're the head of the family it's like wait wait wait you don't know or if somebody if there's an addictive personality someone that is a drinker or someone that gets gets hooked on drugs I wouldn't know how it is he might say brother you don't understand but Jesus does understand he is someone that can be touched he does he understands the things that we go through or you can say that well my my kids are sinning or or my sister my brother my wife my husband and I might not not know how it is but Jesus always does and he's there as the Bible says to be touched in all things it behooved him to be made like us so that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest so what does it mean to be a high priest the high priest was the highest ranking person in the church in the Jewish church he was he was the main guy and what he did is he made an atonement for the people he went in and he sacrificed once a year remember he went into the holy of holies once a year and the co the the glory of God would come down the priest would make these sacrifices for the sins of the people and that was that was the high priest that was his job and a high priest when he was raised to that level of the high priest he was not only judged by his knowledge of the Bible he was also judged by the life that he led he couldn't have a spot on his record his parents were probably Rich he probably came from an affluent family he lived a legalistic life and was probably never accused of doing anything wrong because of his standing and how can that person relate to most of us he was doing his job but he didn't understand how it was but Jesus understands it as I said without sin he never did anything wrong but he was still the devil came against him let's uh let's close verse number 18 for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able to sucker them that are tempted he was able to help them that are tempted um the musicians can come this is one of the most beautiful things I've ever read in the whole Bible that because Jesus went through it you can say as many of the young people that they'll they'll tell their parents you know you just don't understand you don't get it and we don't sometimes I know I certainly don't and some of the things that I hear but he gets it he understands he's he's been there he's suffered he's felt these Temptations and he showed us that no you can you can overcome well I wanted to get to Hebrews 3 but I won't um this book of Hebrews [Music] it was written to a Hebrew audience that were already Christians they had already given their lives to the Lord and here comes this book and it is telling the people that know this man wasn't just a prophet he wasn't just a priest he wasn't just an angel he was better than all of that and in saying that to our people today don't neglect to lift Jesus up and no you don't have to come in a certain way or in a certain fashion the ultimate goal is Jesus Christ he was he was everything and he gets it he understands I don't know how I don't know how to say it any better brothers and sisters we can touch him we can we can get on our knees and we can pray and we can say Lord I need help and he will hear us no one else can do what he did no one else understands how he understands that's why it is so important that we have that relationship between me and him and not anyone in between between you you and him and that's what this book of Hebrews is saying listen he is a high priest he is God himself he was our savior he was our King he is our King he is our savior he's God and he can be touched we can talk to him he understands us just like the sister she was fighting against God and she was saying Lord help my son to get to church help him to find a girl help him to read his Bible help him to do this and this and this and this and God was there he was like if you will just give it to me then I'll take care of it God can give us a promise but unless we accept that promise it'll never happen he promised eternal life to anyone who would accept him he promised healing to everyone he promised all of these things yet how many how come so many people don't get healed how come so many people don't get saved how come so many people don't have don't receive what is promised he promised it why can't we receive it it's because we got to do it our way and if we would just surrender and give it to him then we would have the same results as we see in the book and we would have the same results as a sister that was praying for her son give it to him he understands he gets it we might not but he does brother [Music] Josiah All to Jesus I surrender all to him I freely give I will ever love and trust him in his pray stay here I surrender all I [Music] surrender all all to thee my blessed save your I surrender all oh All to Jesus I Surrender humbly At His Feet I bow worldly pleasures all forsaken take me Jesus take me now I I surrender all oh I [Music] surrender all all to thee my blessed savior I surrender all [Music] therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things which we have learned which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for the word spoken by Angels was steadfast and every transgression and Disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great Sal salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him God also bearing them witness with both signs and wonders in diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will we can't escape if we neglect this salvation that has been given to us it should be everything to us we should instead of trying to get God to change his ways to match our ways we should change our ways to match God ways and God's ways and the only way that we can do that is to get on our knees and to surrender to God and say Lord I don't care you just tell me what to do you just show me you just lead me Lord and I will do what ever you say that is what it is to be a Christian it's not just confessing Christ it's confessing Christ with your mouth and then confessing Christ with your actions and giving your lives to him let's all [Music] stand I claim the blood I have a source of strength when I am weak that takes me through when life is pressing [Music] me I have a source of power from above I'm covered over by a shield of blood I claim the blood Jesus shed on calary those precious blood stains were made

great and precious promises have been placed before us hard for us perhaps to reach with our our minds to reach up that high as the pastor has tried to break it down found for us the calling that you've placed before us Lord may we just Ponder these things let it soak into our hearts the great apostle that wrote this book of Hebrews I know I can almost sense Through the Ages that he is struggling with his audience to to get them to understand the calling that's before them Lord so now we're reaching back through the time and through the history but your Holy Ghost is here Lord to illuminate those things to us maybe just a little word maybe a phrase just a turn of a phrase in a scripture that we haven't quite seen it that way before the Holy Ghost is there and here to illuminate those these things to us I pray that you do that for each heart and as we continue to to probe this great book of Hebrews Lord just loaded and packed with truth and with promises maybe they're they're just a treasure chest full of jewels May a jewel go to each person Lord that's just perfect for them that will bring them along in their faith farther Lord I know you love this
