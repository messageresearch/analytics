[41:02] Lord amen just to be able to to say that
[41:07] name and and
[41:10] have be able to use that name if I could
[41:13] say try to try to give the words to that
[41:16] when you use that name the only
[41:19] name and it has an effect and it has a
[41:22] power people use that name in a way that
[41:26] they they put it down they they they use
[41:29] it in the wrong manner but you and I can
[41:30] use
[41:31] it in in a maybe a similar situation I
[41:36] would say you know I can use my name my
[41:39] girls might say well my father's name is
[41:41] Aaron and he said I could do this may
[41:43] not you might not saying that but what
[41:45] they're saying and it has a certain
[41:47] effect maybe they would go well my dad
[41:50] said it was okay and they would say well
[41:51] who's your dad and they would say well
[41:54] that's a okay I know him it's all right
[41:57] but to say I say in my father's name and

[42:03] have and I appreciate that today let's
[42:05] bow our heads
[42:06] here Lord what a wonderful name almighty
[42:11] God would wrap himself up in flesh be
[42:14] born as a

[42:22] through learning obedience by the things
[42:24] he suffered
[42:26] [Music]
[42:27] coming to a place where you would yield
[42:29] yourself Lord there at Gethsemane at
[42:31] that rock
[42:33] Lord when you realized that everything
[42:36] that had been that you had come for was
[42:38] coming for that time for fulfillment
[42:41] Lord but you still had to yield yourself
[42:43] and say not my will but thy will be done
[42:47] Lord and we are the recipients of that
[42:50] today that Grace that Mercy
[42:52] Lord but you said as as you were
[42:55] speaking to your disciples you said I
[42:57] must go away Lord and their hearts were
[42:59] sad they say why are you going away he
[43:01] because if I don't go away he said then
[43:03] this comforter can't come I can't come
[43:05] and dwell in you I could just be around
[43:08] you be by you but this way I can be in
[43:11] you so Lord we appreciate that today and
[43:14] we love you for it Lord we yield
[43:15] ourselves we surrender our being to you
[43:17] now in Jesus Christ's name amen while
[43:21] you're standing we'll read the first
[43:25] scripture in uh thank you
[43:28] musicians 2
[43:31] Corinthians 4: 17 and
[43:34] 18 and then you may be
[43:41] seated now Paul says it this way for our
[43:44] light
[43:46] afflictions and some of you might argue
[43:49] with me that your afflictions aren't
[43:50] very light
[43:52] sometimes but when you think what he
[43:54] went through and what he suffered in
[43:55] your place Paul says for our light
[43:58] afflictions which is but for a moment
[44:01] worketh for us a far more exceeding and
[44:04] eternal weight of
[44:06] Glory while we look not at the things
[44:09] which are seen But at the things which
[44:11] are not seen for the things which are
[44:13] seen are temporal but the things which
[44:15] are not seen are Eternal amen you may be
[44:20] seated you know you would say well
[44:23] brother if you were going through my
[44:24] afflictions you wouldn't think they're
[44:25] light
[44:27] but you also realize God will never put
[44:29] nothing upon you you cannot bear but we
[44:32] give you the strength and the grace to
[44:35] go through it and you say well you know
[44:36] God didn't do that I did it to myself
[44:38] but he was aware of it it didn't catch
[44:41] him by surprise I'm not saying sometimes
[44:43] we don't get ourselves into the troubles
[44:44] we get into but God's aware fully aware
[44:47] of it
[44:48] so I didn't hear any brother Peter
[44:51] mentioned any prayer requests but sister
[44:54] Amelia had put one if you don't have the
[44:56] WhatsApp you might have not seen it for
[44:58] her her daughter Eva who's been going
[45:00] through some physical problems and she
[45:02] was saying that she went to the doctor
[45:03] and they did some tests on her so let's
[45:06] remember her in prayer but also sister
[45:09] Amilia told me for her salvation for her
[45:11] to turn her heart completely to God and
[45:14] yesterday
[45:16] on I believe it was brother Robert
[45:18] Figaro posted on Facebook there's a
[45:20] family that sings they may be part of
[45:23] wo a a Spanish family they sing both
[45:26] Spanish and English and they they
[45:27] feature them
[45:29] sometimes uh on on on YouTube some of
[45:33] their songs and everything but they had
[45:35] put in a prayer request that there had
[45:36] been an accident the family is an
[45:38] accident and the youngest daughter was
[45:40] killed on the in the accident didn't
[45:42] didn't say the age or anything but the
[45:44] pictures that they posted it was it was
[45:46] a young family it looked like she would
[45:48] have been
[45:50] maybe not ENT teenss definitely younger
[45:52] than that so um let's just remember the
[45:55] Lord knows who they are
[45:57] and I I sometimes when I hear that news
[46:00] I try to
[46:02] imagine or put myself in their place but
[46:04] I really
[46:05] can't until you go through it you don't
[46:07] really know but that's why he went
[46:10] through what what he went through so
[46:11] that when you and I would ask or talk to
[46:14] him about it he would say I understand I
[46:17] Can Be Touched by the feeling of your of
[46:19] our infirmities you might say well you
[46:22] know was he ever spanked did he ever get
[46:25] his ears pulled I don't know
[46:28] but he was a child he was taken care of
[46:32] you know the same way I'm sure there was
[46:34] times that Mary and Joseph got impatient
[46:37] with him and maybe they had to remind
[46:41] each other of his special birth and of
[46:43] the things they went through but as
[46:45] humans you know sometimes we get a
[46:47] little frustrated we get a little
[46:49] upset and um and then Lord help us to
[46:53] say we're sorry you know to go back and
[46:55] make things right is when you hold those
[46:57] things in your heart you hold those
[46:59] things in yourself and they begin to
[47:00] fester and they begin to they begin to
[47:02] trouble you they begin to to to cause
[47:05] you to get weak and and and you know and
[47:08] they'll affect your relationship with
[47:10] God which will affect your relationship
[47:13] with your brother and your
[47:14] sister you know and and there I hear
[47:17] people and you see people say I can do
[47:19] this by myself I don't need
[47:21] anybody you get around them get talking
[47:24] to them after a little bit you find out
[47:26] they're usually pretty sad people
[47:27] they're usually going through a hard
[47:28] time they're just trying to be brave and
[47:31] tough about it but you know if we'll
[47:33] just surrender ourselves and just say
[47:36] not my will but thy will be done he has
[47:40] he has a a perfect plan for you a
[47:43] complete whole plan for you with best
[47:46] intentions Jeremiah tells us I know my
[47:49] thoughts that I have toward you and the
[47:51] Angus you know I say well I know
[47:55] sometimes that you might have some good
[47:57] thoughts about somebody and then they do
[47:58] something and boy it kind of changes
[48:00] your thoughts for a moment you know but
[48:03] his never changed is never changing and
[48:06] I sure appreciate that
[48:09] so what brother Peter spoke last
[48:11] Wednesday
[48:12] night and what some of what brother Dave
[48:17] gadman
[48:18] spoke I had already had some thoughts in
[48:20] my heart I had got a brother sent me a
[48:23] quote with a scripture and it just spoke
[48:26] to me and it started a a series of you
[48:30] know thinking about it this ties into
[48:32] that scripture and brother brandham said
[48:34] this I've experienced that and it just
[48:36] starts to build into a
[48:38] thought and um I had just mentioned it
[48:42] to my wife she's the only one that I
[48:43] said you know this this is kind of
[48:44] what's on my heart right now and then
[48:47] listen to what brother Peter said and
[48:49] even though we weren't in service we we
[48:50] heard it and being here with brother
[48:51] gadman especially when he got into let's
[48:55] fight and it was challenge you let's
[48:58] fight what he was saying let's stand in
[49:01] this and let's let's take possession of
[49:03] what God has given
[49:05] us and brother Peter talking about cold
[49:08] and
[49:09] hot and being the U I don't want to call
[49:13] him a scientist that wouldn't be the
[49:15] word but I know some of the the stuff
[49:17] that he's done and and how he was able
[49:19] to explain some of the processes in all
[49:21] and those of us who who passed science
[49:24] because we we had a good science person
[49:26] sitting next to us you know and I it's
[49:29] honest I'm being just honest about it um
[49:32] you know it didn't make a whole lot of
[49:34] sense I I struggled through
[49:36] algebra and my cousin who went to school
[49:39] with me got so bored with algebra
[49:41] because there was nothing exciting about
[49:43] it that he quit doing math and he failed
[49:46] the
[49:47] class and when they gave out the awards
[49:50] that year in in in high school for the
[49:53] top math student his name was mentioned
[49:55] of one who could have but because he got
[49:59] so bored it was so simple it had no
[50:02] excitement and to me I just blowing
[50:05] brain fuses all the time trying to
[50:06] figure it out you know but I thank God
[50:09] that he doesn't look at our
[50:12] ability well this one's good enough to
[50:14] handle but he himself dwells in
[50:17] you I want to read a quote in brother
[50:20] Jeremy I didn't give you this quote
[50:21] because it was one at the last minute I
[50:23] read
[50:24] it and brother brandom says this in 1949
[50:28] and and and you could hear the
[50:30] excitement in his voice when he
[50:32] beginning to see and this was on the
[50:35] voice of God quote of the day which I
[50:38] try to read them every day and see what
[50:39] scriptures and and just different things
[50:42] that different people post and I see a
[50:43] scripture or quote I'll read it just to
[50:45] see there's something there but it's
[50:47] it's from the deity of Jesus Christ
[50:49] preached in 49 he says and that same
[50:52] power that same Christ and the
[50:55] Hallelujah let the fundamentalists let
[50:57] them who deny the power of God say it's
[51:01] wrong but the same power that spoke the
[51:03] world into existent is in those people
[51:07] that's got the Holy
[51:10] Ghost you know being raised in a
[51:13] Pentecostal Church our idea of the Holy
[51:15] Ghost really was a little different it
[51:18] was a lot of tongues and a lot of
[51:19] emotion and a lot of you know that's
[51:21] what you know growing up at especially
[51:23] in the latter part uh or or even brother
[51:26] brandham said in 56 he says America
[51:28] you've turned your heart I remember in
[51:31] the mid-60s and as a young man I began
[51:33] to see the the U the stuff that wasn't
[51:37] genuine anymore you know when God gives
[51:40] you the Holy Ghost it's
[51:42] genuine because it's
[51:44] him but people have have made their
[51:47] ideas and things like that and to see
[51:49] some of the things we saw but brother
[51:51] bam says here it's that same creative
[51:54] power in you the Holy Ghost he
[51:57] that's right men and wom it's time we
[51:59] found out who it's time we find out who
[52:01] you are the devil is trying to hide hide
[52:04] you back tell you you're some little
[52:07] coward down something he says you're not
[52:10] you are Sons and Daughters of God the
[52:13] deity is not in heaven it's in you
[52:17] Hallelujah I know you think I'm crazy
[52:19] but let me tell you something brother
[52:21] when you realize that almighty God lives
[52:23] in you in Mortal life my life I give Zoe
[52:27] the life of God is in the human
[52:32] being amen okay now so that fits perfect
[52:37] with my thought even though it was last
[52:39] night because the quote that the brother
[52:42] sent
[52:43] me it made me think I need to deny my
[52:46] own
[52:47] thoughts and say what God
[52:50] said because sometimes you hear
[52:52] something in the scriptures you hear
[52:54] something that is preached and you say
[52:56] Amen man I that's I know that's a truth
[52:58] but me but you don't know my situation
[53:01] you don't know what I'm going
[53:03] through and you immediately water down
[53:06] lessen the
[53:08] effect you don't lessen the word of God
[53:10] you lessen the effect it has in you
[53:13] that's what ends up happening you know
[53:16] um and and then you're saying if you're
[53:19] not careful and and brother Brown says
[53:21] you've made of the the scripture tell
[53:23] you made the word of God of none effect
[53:26] but God says my word shall not return
[53:29] void so God's word is
[53:32] effective it doesn't fail it's true he's
[53:36] faithful he's the
[53:37] amen so so we see that and then we say
[53:41] but why isn't it happening in me why am
[53:43] I struggling through that and I
[53:45] understand we're we're robed still in
[53:47] flesh and the scripture tells us that
[53:49] Jesus had to Humble himself had to say
[53:51] no to the
[53:53] flesh so if he had to say no to the
[53:56] flesh then so do
[53:57] we as brother Peter was talking about
[54:00] that hot and cold and I had these
[54:01] thoughts and I'm listening and I brother
[54:03] Peter doesn't know what when I say my
[54:06] goodness and you could see yourself at
[54:08] places like that you say wow how did I
[54:10] get to this place how did I you how did
[54:13] I end up here you know and and um you
[54:17] realize okay but God doesn't leave you
[54:21] there it says behold I stand at the door
[54:24] and knock if If any man would open the
[54:27] door I will come in and Su with
[54:30] him now and he will do it without he
[54:32] said If any man would do that if any
[54:36] being now I was listening to the message
[54:40] hidden
[54:41] life and brother brandom is talking
[54:43] about getting into that third part
[54:45] behind the
[54:47] curtain you know you have the three
[54:49] parts coming into the Tabernacle there
[54:53] but the holies of holies is where God
[54:55] dwelt
[54:57] now you came into the first part you
[55:00] observed you washed you prepared you
[55:03] came into the second part where the
[55:04] light was but if that's as far as you
[55:07] went you didn't get to what God
[55:11] desired and that was to get into the
[55:13] holy of holies behind the curtain now he
[55:15] rent the veil in
[55:17] two we know that to open the access so
[55:21] that you and I could get in there
[55:23] because before that it was the high
[55:25] priest only a a man walked in uh uh you
[55:29] know uh that was called of the the the
[55:32] tribe specific one Aaron being the first
[55:35] the first high priest and then the
[55:36] lineage followed and brother brandom in
[55:39] Hidden life he strongly talks about that
[55:42] dead uh almond stick that that Aaron had
[55:44] with him got left inside the holy of
[55:47] holies and when that high priest came
[55:50] back and it it had life had returned to
[55:53] it it had budded and it had brought
[55:55] forth fruit a dead limb you know so he's
[56:01] talking you know you look at yourself
[56:02] maybe you're looking at yourself and man
[56:04] I'm just I'm just a whole pile of
[56:06] nothing I just don't see well let's look
[56:09] to see where we're at let's see if we've
[56:12] gotten into that that behind behind that
[56:14] curtain going through there and gotten
[56:16] into the place where there is life where
[56:19] God chooses to meet now we also know
[56:22] he's placed it in his name brother BR
[56:25] says God's provided Ed place of worship
[56:28] it's not a physical building anymore
[56:30] it's not Tucson Tabernacle it's not
[56:32] brandom Tabernacle it's not this church
[56:34] that church it's not sunset Mountain or
[56:37] Sabino it's you in Christ it's wherever
[56:41] you are because he's there too you know
[56:44] and and you can have an effect of the
[56:48] surroundings as as brother Peter started
[56:50] saying the only real peace that I have
[56:53] is in
[56:54] you and I never thought of the the other
[56:56] and I don't know if you were heard it
[56:58] that way their only real Joy or was that
[57:00] just coming fresh when you were singing
[57:02] it or somebody else I never heard it
[57:03] that way maybe they do sing it but the
[57:06] only real Joy the only real strength the
[57:08] only real hope everything I have lies in
[57:10] you
[57:12] Lord then why do we go look elsewhere
[57:15] you know I after going through some of
[57:18] the things I went through and you know
[57:19] being sick and the effects of the
[57:22] diabetes and all that and um I I would
[57:26] drink you know I would drink one or two
[57:28] do peppers a day it was my uh my cold
[57:33] coffee some people would drink coffee I
[57:35] drink you know and after I got sick I'd
[57:38] walk by them and part of me would say
[57:39] get another one another part of me would
[57:41] say
[57:42] no you don't want to go through that
[57:45] again you know and it's been to a little
[57:50] over two years now and I can walk by him
[57:52] there is no temptation there but there
[57:54] still is some Temptations for some of
[57:56] the other things
[57:57] too you I would love to say exempt I
[58:01] I've way back but no you've got to walk
[58:04] in a way every day say no to the things
[58:08] that are not of God say no to the
[58:10] thoughts that are contrary to his word
[58:12] and say yes to what he
[58:14] says if if I would title this I'm going
[58:16] to title it deny your own
[58:19] thoughts because sometimes our thoughts
[58:21] are contrary to the word of God and then
[58:24] we question the Lord
[58:26] why and he just he he'll tell you if he
[58:29] would talk to you in plain English he
[58:31] well he just told me I can't do
[58:33] it no I didn't say that no that was your
[58:37] thoughts God you're you you're faithful
[58:40] you're wonderful you're just marvelous
[58:42] you're great but only in brothers so and
[58:44] so or sisters so- and so because oh they
[58:46] love the Lord but not in me Lord I'm
[58:49] struggling I'm this I'm and you begin to
[58:52] look at yourself and you begin to make
[58:54] the word of God of non effect in your
[58:56] own
[58:57] life and I know I've been there and it's
[59:00] a daily struggle Paul says oh Wretched
[59:03] Man that I am who shall deliver me from
[59:06] this the things that I should be doing
[59:09] and want to do I find myself not doing
[59:12] the things that I shouldn't be doing I
[59:15] find myself
[59:16] doing frustrated you know waking up in
[59:20] the middle of the night and I wish there
[59:23] was sometimes a way you could click and
[59:26] turn off the dreams or the thoughts and
[59:28] just sleep but sometimes you can't they
[59:31] flood you I'll read some scriptures
[59:34] where the scriptures tell us God is
[59:36] greater than that David tells us in the
[59:38] Psalms God is greater than that and and
[59:41] Paul's telling us in in Corinthians
[59:43] we're looking to that which is
[59:45] unseen we're looking not at that which
[59:47] is around us which we we can comprehend
[59:50] with our our physical
[59:51] being and when reality what we
[59:54] comprehend with our physical being is so
[59:56] little and compared to what is available
[59:59] and what is out there brother brandham
[1:00:02] says in the message looking at the
[1:00:04] Unseen we'll read a couple of quotes
[1:00:07] here we won't be too long
[1:00:10] tonight looking at the
[1:00:14] Unseen now here he he's talking to the
[1:00:16] congregation there he says look how many
[1:00:18] here for the first time they was ever in
[1:00:22] one of my meetings raise your hands
[1:00:23] pretty near half the audience they've
[1:00:25] never been in the meetings how many here
[1:00:27] that's sick and needs prayer for their
[1:00:29] bodies won you raise your hand well all
[1:00:32] of us at times would say Lord I need you
[1:00:36] maybe a physical healing maybe a mental
[1:00:38] healing maybe a spiritual healing some
[1:00:40] type of healing something I'm going
[1:00:41] through you know and you know brother
[1:00:44] Brandon would be preaching and and
[1:00:46] brother Brandon was God's the The Voice
[1:00:50] God used for this day and age Elijah had
[1:00:54] his time Elisha had his time John joh
[1:00:56] the Baptist had his time and God chose
[1:00:58] brother brandom and and and to when we
[1:01:01] listen to that we realize it's God
[1:01:03] speaking to us not brother brandham
[1:01:04] speaking to us he had to yield himself
[1:01:07] he had to surrender himself he had to
[1:01:09] take that so we have to do it the same
[1:01:11] way and he's and he's telling because he
[1:01:14] would stand there he would preach the
[1:01:17] and just lay it out before the people
[1:01:19] and then he would say now if what I've
[1:01:21] told you is the
[1:01:23] truth he'll come and back it
[1:01:26] up but then he would wait he says you
[1:01:30] know what I'm waiting for it's him
[1:01:33] because brother man could not do this
[1:01:35] alone and neither can you and
[1:01:37] I and then all of a sudden he would say
[1:01:40] he's here and there's a complete
[1:01:42] different a
[1:01:44] change you know if if you all alone and
[1:01:47] you've got some maybe if you're you're
[1:01:49] one guy and there's three guys against
[1:01:51] you and they're standing front of you
[1:01:52] and threatening you all and and you you
[1:01:55] you want to take care of yourself but
[1:01:58] then all a sudden three or four your
[1:01:59] brothers show up right behind you and
[1:02:00] say we're with you oh boy all a sudden
[1:02:02] your chest gets up and say come on we're
[1:02:04] ready well that was brother Brandon he
[1:02:06] knew that alone he could not do
[1:02:08] it but with the angel of the Lord
[1:02:11] standing there nothing would could get
[1:02:14] past you you you can sometimes encourage
[1:02:16] yourself and just read some of the
[1:02:18] prayer lines just listen to some of the
[1:02:19] things he's saying there and watch God
[1:02:21] moving and he's the same yesterday today
[1:02:24] and forever he changes not
[1:02:26] he's he's speaking to one and he's
[1:02:28] talking about the that he goes that
[1:02:29] devil and that is crying out to help and
[1:02:31] the devil and that one over there he
[1:02:33] said why because God was standing
[1:02:35] there and then he turns around he says
[1:02:37] look he said the Holy Spirit just fell
[1:02:39] on that one right there and I know he
[1:02:42] catches somebody's thought and he says
[1:02:44] what the one that tells me there's
[1:02:46] sickness couldn't show me the Holy Ghost
[1:02:48] falling down it was the same it was God
[1:02:51] doing those things so here he's telling
[1:02:53] me he says look now he says oh dear
[1:02:56] precious brother sister please listen to
[1:02:58] what I've just said don't look at your
[1:03:01] disease you can never get well don't
[1:03:04] look to your Affliction look to Jesus
[1:03:07] he's the one he said you say brother
[1:03:09] brandom if I could rest assure that he
[1:03:12] was here if if I knew that he was here
[1:03:16] I'd be willing to accept him in every
[1:03:18] Power would you do that raise your hands
[1:03:21] if he was positive that he was here you
[1:03:23] could accept him just raise your hands
[1:03:25] all that say that I'm positive
[1:03:28] here well what would he do if he was
[1:03:32] here and God allowed over and over to be
[1:03:35] recorded for us to see it but that's not
[1:03:38] all it was going to be God brought it so
[1:03:41] that you and I could have the same
[1:03:44] experience because you walking down you
[1:03:47] at home you at work you wherever you're
[1:03:50] at if Christ in
[1:03:53] you and you're standing there and you're
[1:03:56] his mouthpiece and you're his hands and
[1:03:58] you're his eyes and it's the same as
[1:04:01] he's here now I can therefore
[1:04:05] Speak oh he said brother that's was for
[1:04:07] the brother brand no that's for every
[1:04:09] son and daughter of
[1:04:11] God and watch what Jesus says here when
[1:04:14] he does when he takes and he says talks
[1:04:17] about the Prodigal
[1:04:19] Son the one that was going to go out and
[1:04:22] if I understand the word prodical also
[1:04:24] ones who would go out and spend their
[1:04:25] riches foolishly it ties into that
[1:04:28] that's why he used that word so the
[1:04:30] father knew what the son was going to go
[1:04:32] do he was not surprised by it obviously
[1:04:34] the son had done certain things around
[1:04:36] the house that the dad
[1:04:38] knew you know as you're raising your
[1:04:40] children as my my mom and dad raised me
[1:04:43] they knew things that you know I would
[1:04:45] do and I learned things that they would
[1:04:47] do both ways it's how it is your
[1:04:50] co-workers you know their certain the
[1:04:51] way they lean to do it just as you get
[1:04:53] to know them so the father goes lets the
[1:04:57] son go knowing the son is going to get
[1:04:59] himself into some
[1:05:01] trouble but he didn't disown
[1:05:03] him but he has another son at home who
[1:05:07] never caused any
[1:05:08] trouble but he didn't have the best
[1:05:10] attitude as it came to show at the end
[1:05:14] so the Father Knows those things about
[1:05:16] us he knows the road you're going to
[1:05:18] travel he knows the steps you're going
[1:05:19] to
[1:05:20] take and he knows the lessons you're
[1:05:22] going to
[1:05:24] learn and you say Lord why did I have to
[1:05:26] learn him so hard because brother Lyall
[1:05:28] never had to learn him this hard and
[1:05:30] brother lyall's looking at at brother
[1:05:32] Merl and saying why the Lord why do you
[1:05:34] have to give me a heart brother Merl
[1:05:35] didn't have to learn him this heart and
[1:05:36] brother Merl will pass each one of us
[1:05:39] are the things we go through for one for
[1:05:41] each another you know but it's part of
[1:05:43] the body of Christ some of the parts of
[1:05:45] your body physical body feel more pain
[1:05:47] than others some are a lot more
[1:05:50] sensitive some a lot of part you you you
[1:05:52] hit yourself certain place and
[1:05:54] immediately you feel it some sometimes
[1:05:55] you hit yourself and you don't know you
[1:05:57] hit yourself do you see the SCAR or the
[1:06:00] bruise this part knew it got hit but
[1:06:02] this part didn't
[1:06:03] register but sometimes you're already
[1:06:06] feeling the pain when you're watching
[1:06:07] that that ball flying at you you know
[1:06:09] you're already feeling it you're so just
[1:06:12] it we're all different we're all part of
[1:06:14] the body of Christ so brother random
[1:06:17] says you know on that he's
[1:06:19] saying I'm positive he's here because
[1:06:23] God said so
[1:06:26] speak to the Rock and it shall give
[1:06:28] forth his
[1:06:31] water brother Braham says here it
[1:06:34] depends on what you look
[1:06:36] at if you look to your Affliction you'll
[1:06:39] never go any further but if you look at
[1:06:42] the promise of God you've got every
[1:06:44] right to every Redemptive blessing that
[1:06:47] God promised in his word is
[1:06:50] yours if you're good if you behave
[1:06:52] yourself if you meet I didn't say that
[1:06:56] they're
[1:06:56] yours I was thinking of the song brother
[1:06:59] Matt had to sing the last time he was
[1:07:01] here is um your grace still amazes me
[1:07:05] they're singing and one of the girls
[1:07:06] said Dad that's an old
[1:07:09] song and uh you know some of these songs
[1:07:11] we sing and yeah they were old they were
[1:07:13] written in the 80s that's so old you
[1:07:16] know but I was thinking how old is
[1:07:20] Grace when did Grace start it just
[1:07:22] thought that Pro that he was slain came
[1:07:25] from before the foundation of the world
[1:07:28] Grace was already
[1:07:30] working because that's what motivated
[1:07:33] him be like and I started go J if if you
[1:07:36] look at the pro you got every right to
[1:07:38] every Redemptive blessing that God
[1:07:40] promised in word is yours right the
[1:07:42] Christian always looks at the Unseen
[1:07:44] things every Redemptive blessing of God
[1:07:47] is
[1:07:48] unseen the here's the whole armor of the
[1:07:51] Christian love joy faith longsuffering
[1:07:55] goodness meekness gentleness patience
[1:07:59] it's all unseen forces that work in the
[1:08:01] heart of the believer amen that's right
[1:08:04] we look at things we do not see if we
[1:08:07] are the children of Abraham then we
[1:08:09] don't walk by sight we walk by faith for
[1:08:12] Abraham walked by faith and called those
[1:08:14] things which are not as though they were
[1:08:16] because God said
[1:08:18] so now I'll ask you personally you can
[1:08:21] answer this verbally with your hand
[1:08:22] raise
[1:08:23] yourself how many believes God said
[1:08:29] so okay how many believe God said so to
[1:08:33] you
[1:08:35] personally it's good for everybody but
[1:08:38] it has to be come right down to you
[1:08:42] personally
[1:08:44] because brother Lyle could enjoy seeing
[1:08:48] me eat I don't know maybe not he might
[1:08:51] want to eat with me but I'm just saying
[1:08:53] some people make food look
[1:08:56] delicious you watch them eat they seem
[1:08:58] to be enjoying it they're having a good
[1:09:00] time you're like
[1:09:01] man and and then other people are in a
[1:09:05] hurry to get done because they got to go
[1:09:06] do something they're just you know one
[1:09:09] of the young guys that I work with I
[1:09:11] remember his his father had passed away
[1:09:13] so it just him and his mom and Mom would
[1:09:16] make the same lunch for him every day
[1:09:20] and he was happy with it a meat
[1:09:22] burrito a thing of Kool-Aid a thing of
[1:09:26] salsa and a bag of
[1:09:28] chips and it was the same thing every
[1:09:30] single day we worked together for 10
[1:09:33] years or more I never saw it
[1:09:35] change but he enjoyed it in front of me
[1:09:38] every time watch him he' didat just
[1:09:41] smile on his face and just good I was
[1:09:43] like man I've got to have one of those
[1:09:46] but it was him he was enjoying it there
[1:09:48] was another uh guy that worked with us
[1:09:51] and here's the two
[1:09:54] extremes he bought one big frozen
[1:09:57] pizza and he baked it and he took two
[1:10:00] pieces from that frozen pizza every
[1:10:03] day the cheap package of cookies the
[1:10:06] cheapest one from Walmart the 99 Cents
[1:10:08] took two of those and a glass of
[1:10:11] cool-aid every day and it never
[1:10:14] changed he didn't look so happy eating
[1:10:16] but he ate it one day I asked him he
[1:10:19] said the reason I do this is because my
[1:10:21] wife is back in Nebraska taking care of
[1:10:23] her mom I'm paying my house payment and
[1:10:25] their house paint me he says I got to
[1:10:26] save every penny I got that's why he was
[1:10:29] doing
[1:10:31] it he did it for his love for his
[1:10:34] mother-in-law and his wife not because
[1:10:36] he loved the cheap cookies and the sweet
[1:10:39] but my friend Joe loved the
[1:10:42] food you know but you have to have fall
[1:10:47] in love with
[1:10:49] God it's wonderful to see somebody else
[1:10:52] being blessed it's wonderful to see the
[1:10:54] joy of the Lord moving amongst the
[1:10:56] people and and sometimes standing on
[1:10:58] this side looking back either you're
[1:11:01] ministering or you're song leading or
[1:11:02] you're playing the music and you see the
[1:11:04] Lord moving it's a
[1:11:06] joy to see people praising the Lord
[1:11:08] smiling worshiping clapping it's you
[1:11:10] know just it brings joy to your
[1:11:14] heart but if that's all you're
[1:11:17] doing you're not getting too much out of
[1:11:19] it it's a joy but you need to experience
[1:11:22] that also yeah he said so
[1:11:25] God said
[1:11:28] so from the message Arius a secret
[1:11:33] believer now this one's a little long
[1:11:35] one we read it one night the disciples
[1:11:37] was waiting on him down by the seashore
[1:11:40] and they took off ahead they thought oh
[1:11:42] well we can make it anyhow we will go
[1:11:44] out into the sea and they rode off out
[1:11:48] and went off without Jesus now there's I
[1:11:51] skipped some portions
[1:11:52] so so just kind of short that's what's
[1:11:55] matter with a lot of families around
[1:11:56] here and everywhere else you think you
[1:11:58] can row across the sea of life without
[1:12:00] Jesus but you'll find out there there
[1:12:02] will be trouble in the little bark
[1:12:04] before you get too far you can't stem
[1:12:07] the tides of life without Christ he says
[1:12:11] there they was out but I love this oh my
[1:12:14] when I think of it now he knew they went
[1:12:16] off without him but you notice he
[1:12:18] climbed upon the hill and he watched
[1:12:20] them out in the sea and he seen the
[1:12:23] devil catch him out there in that little
[1:12:24] whirlwind and began to dash the boat up
[1:12:26] and down but his eyes was on them and he
[1:12:29] was watching for them maybe the devil
[1:12:31] has caught you out somewhere and he give
[1:12:33] you a disease or some sickness or your
[1:12:35] backslid or something like that but
[1:12:37] remember he climbed the ramparts of
[1:12:39] glory and setting on high His Eye Is on
[1:12:43] the Sparrow and I know he watches me he
[1:12:47] is from Everlasting to everlasting God
[1:12:51] he doesn't change what he did that back
[1:12:54] then he still doesn't the same you know
[1:12:57] he steps up and he watches you he sees
[1:13:00] where you're at he knows we're having
[1:13:02] the meeting tonight he knows how
[1:13:03] concerned each one of us are about it he
[1:13:06] knows your interest in him he knows your
[1:13:08] interest in the Kingdom he knows where
[1:13:11] your heart is so he watches over his
[1:13:16] word he gave the word and he watches
[1:13:18] over it you know my wife my wife likes
[1:13:21] to plant
[1:13:23] flowers and this time around around when
[1:13:25] she plants his little seedlings that
[1:13:27] come up in the plant them in the winter
[1:13:28] for spring and Asher and and Chloe
[1:13:32] helped her plant them you know and they
[1:13:34] get all excited about
[1:13:36] everything but saying she'll say oh I
[1:13:39] forgot to water them will you go water
[1:13:41] them for because she's watching waiting
[1:13:43] for that little sign of that little
[1:13:47] those buds coming out and once they
[1:13:49] started coming out you should see my
[1:13:50] wife how excited she gets now I don't
[1:13:53] get quite the same excitement that she
[1:13:55] does because I know I have to get in
[1:13:56] there and weed everything she doesn't
[1:13:58] want in there you know but it's part of
[1:14:01] of what we do but the joy of it and then
[1:14:04] when they begin to bear fruit and they
[1:14:06] begin to or flowers and and the
[1:14:09] grandkids come over and Chloe goes out
[1:14:11] in Asher and they go the flowers the
[1:14:13] yellow flowers red the joy of it to see
[1:14:16] that and God gets the same uh response
[1:14:20] to himself when he begins and he watches
[1:14:22] over where and he begins to see it grow
[1:14:24] in in you begins to see it manifest
[1:14:27] begins to see it flower the joy of
[1:14:31] it he makes sure he get water he makes
[1:14:33] sure the ground is good he makes sure
[1:14:35] that all the processes and nutrients are
[1:14:37] given to it why to bring forth that
[1:14:41] which that seed
[1:14:42] is he says and as the waters pushed on
[1:14:46] and while Jesus spoke and said be not
[1:14:49] afraid of his ey now he's he's out now
[1:14:51] on Peter said if it's you Lord give me
[1:14:54] just a little little
[1:14:56] test and ask and you shall
[1:14:59] receive Lord Try Me Lord test
[1:15:03] me I don't know how many actually say
[1:15:06] that but he'll I'll say okay but be like
[1:15:11] job and said I shall then come forth as
[1:15:14] gold he says you know and and ask and
[1:15:18] you shall receive and he gave him the
[1:15:20] test and when he tried to do it in
[1:15:22] himself he failed and every other man
[1:15:25] will fail he got his eyes off Jesus and
[1:15:28] he began to look how big the waves was
[1:15:30] and he began to see the waves were
[1:15:32] contrary and he began to sink and every
[1:15:35] man that will look at his Affliction
[1:15:36] after being prayed for is sure to sink
[1:15:39] you don't look at your Affliction you
[1:15:41] keep your eyes on the promise Giver the
[1:15:43] Lord Jesus Christ who never fails keep
[1:15:46] your eyes on his word he's the one who
[1:15:49] promise he watches over it to perform it
[1:15:52] he keeps it in the hollow of his hand in
[1:15:54] the depth of his heart heart it's bedded
[1:15:56] his words his words has to be true get
[1:16:00] your mind off your sickness off your
[1:16:02] trouble keep your eyes on
[1:16:06] Jesus boy that's a good quote to read
[1:16:09] but Lord help me to do it I put my hand
[1:16:13] up there Lord help me to do that you
[1:16:16] know you would say man brother Brandon
[1:16:18] was so inspired what a wonderful
[1:16:20] thing but go read some of the other
[1:16:22] quotes some of those things he shared
[1:16:24] about his own person personal life he
[1:16:26] was a man just as much as you and I
[1:16:29] were and he had to he yield himself
[1:16:32] surrender himself and say not my will
[1:16:34] but thy will be done now we take the
[1:16:37] scriptures here we read in in
[1:16:39] Corinthians 4:7 chapter 41 17
[1:16:42] 18 for our light Affliction which is but
[1:16:46] for a moment worketh for it or as a far
[1:16:50] more exceeding and eternal weight of
[1:16:53] Glory when you can look past and look at
[1:16:56] the end results remember the the story
[1:16:59] that brother brandham relates quite
[1:17:01] often about the the young boys that were
[1:17:04] competing for that Schwin
[1:17:06] bicycle and I still remember when Schwin
[1:17:09] bikes were a name but as kids you wow
[1:17:13] he's got a Schwin bike that cost a whole
[1:17:16] lot more money than the one I got you
[1:17:18] know that was a brand that there was and
[1:17:21] brother bam uses that and he says and to
[1:17:23] ride up on that board cross over on the
[1:17:26] narrow plank without falling off and all
[1:17:30] the best Riders went first and they all
[1:17:33] fell off and the young man that they all
[1:17:35] looked at say he doesn't have a chance
[1:17:37] he made it to the other side so they
[1:17:40] asked him what was the secret you know
[1:17:42] how did you manage to stay on that plank
[1:17:45] he said I never look down at the
[1:17:47] circumstances I never looked down at
[1:17:49] what was going but I kept my eyes on the
[1:17:52] prize that was before me
[1:17:55] and because of that that did not have
[1:17:58] the effect on me that it had on
[1:18:00] you because you know when you start
[1:18:03] walking on a narrow path and you start
[1:18:05] looking down you start seeing how far it
[1:18:06] is and how far you could fall boy your
[1:18:09] confidence on that trail disappears like
[1:18:11] that but you watch some of those folks
[1:18:14] they walk right through it like if they
[1:18:15] were walking on a 10- foot wide path and
[1:18:17] they had a a chain hanging up from the
[1:18:19] side of the mountain and they seem so
[1:18:21] confident because they're not paying
[1:18:23] attention to the circumstances what how
[1:18:24] narrow the path looks to them but rather
[1:18:27] they're taking each step and going
[1:18:29] forward I remember we we came through
[1:18:33] Arizona in 1972 on our way back from a
[1:18:36] trip the dad took us on and we stopped
[1:18:39] to see the Grand
[1:18:41] Canyon and dad said let's hike it and I
[1:18:44] was 12 years old or going to be 12 that
[1:18:46] year and my younger brother so south rim
[1:18:49] we went down and we went all the way
[1:18:50] down to what do they call that g Indian
[1:18:53] Garden that's the Springs down there and
[1:18:56] that's about as far as I got and that
[1:18:57] was
[1:18:58] downhill still had to come back up dad
[1:19:02] and my brother went to overlook the
[1:19:03] river and on the way back
[1:19:06] up dad just said follow me I'll set a
[1:19:10] pace we'll walk quarter of a mile we'll
[1:19:13] rest for a bit we'll walk a quarter of
[1:19:15] Mile but watching different hikers going
[1:19:18] back up and some coming down ladies in
[1:19:21] high
[1:19:22] hills not recommended at all
[1:19:26] people that came down without water not
[1:19:28] recommended at all a young a young a
[1:19:32] couple young guys that took their mother
[1:19:33] down and she tired and they went back up
[1:19:35] and left her at the
[1:19:37] bottom um this all happen on that that
[1:19:42] trip we had
[1:19:44] um a gentleman older gentleman and his
[1:19:47] son with full backpacks and
[1:19:50] all and they came walking up and they
[1:19:53] went right past us just like if they
[1:19:56] were going downhill and we're going
[1:19:58] uphill so Dad offered and said you guys
[1:20:00] need some help we'll help you carry that
[1:20:02] and dad turned around goes no we started
[1:20:04] on the north rim yesterday and I think
[1:20:05] we can finish this rim and they just
[1:20:07] kept on
[1:20:09] going and I'm already thinking man I'm
[1:20:11] going to climb up on his backpack and
[1:20:13] let him haul me out you know and then
[1:20:15] there was two young girls and I would
[1:20:17] say probably college girls same thing
[1:20:19] and dad made the same offer you need
[1:20:22] some help and they said the same thing
[1:20:23] oh we started a way down 25 miles from
[1:20:26] here he said we're almost
[1:20:29] done dad say let's just make it to the
[1:20:31] next Bend let's just make it to the next
[1:20:33] Bend hey we got up to the
[1:20:36] top now ask me if I'll do it again
[1:20:39] probably
[1:20:40] not but where was your what was your
[1:20:43] goal what was your I set on what was the
[1:20:45] end result now I remember as we were
[1:20:48] making the last bends and I could see
[1:20:49] the end some strength came back to me
[1:20:51] that I hadn't found for the last three
[1:20:53] miles and I want wanted to run to the
[1:20:57] Finish hey we're almost
[1:20:59] there hold steady don't give up
[1:21:03] now just deny your own thoughts and say
[1:21:07] this is what God said this is what God
[1:21:11] says so again while we look not at the
[1:21:13] things which are which are seen But at
[1:21:16] the things which are not seen for the
[1:21:19] things which are seen are
[1:21:21] temporal but the things which are not
[1:21:23] seen are
[1:21:25] Eternal
[1:21:27] now let's just make an age
[1:21:29] comparison my dad's 84 I'm gonna be
[1:21:34] 61 my youngest daughter Rachel's
[1:21:38] 31 Chloe's
[1:21:41] four we all have different perspectives
[1:21:45] at the same
[1:21:46] thing dad's looking back at most of it
[1:21:50] now and saying hey you can make it you
[1:21:53] can make it I already been there I've
[1:21:55] got here I'm looking back at a lot but I
[1:21:58] still see some ahead of
[1:22:00] me and Rachel is about getting to the
[1:22:04] middle of it and looking at both sides
[1:22:07] and Chloe is looking at it says boy I've
[1:22:09] got a lot to go
[1:22:11] do we're all looking at the same
[1:22:14] path what's your perspective of it where
[1:22:17] are you on that
[1:22:19] Journey we ought to encourage one
[1:22:21] another brother sister I've been there
[1:22:24] God will was faithful he never left us
[1:22:27] he always watched over us he met every
[1:22:29] need come on come on let's put our arms
[1:22:32] around we we don't leave the wounded
[1:22:33] soldiers on the side we pick them up and
[1:22:35] we bring them with
[1:22:37] us says so the things which are not seen
[1:22:41] those are
[1:22:43] Eternal now we'll go to Psalms and out
[1:22:45] of this we'll do our scripture lesson
[1:22:47] tonight
[1:22:50] Psalms psalm 16 veres 1-1 David
[1:22:55] now we we know all about David's life
[1:22:58] because David wrote a lot about
[1:23:00] it he laid out his heart quite a bit
[1:23:03] laid out and even God speaks so much of
[1:23:07] David as a brother Matt Matthew spoke to
[1:23:11] us and he compared David and and
[1:23:15] Solomon David was a man after God's Own
[1:23:19] Heart but you and I looking at it from
[1:23:21] our side whoa aser made a lot lot of
[1:23:24] messes didn't he he sure made a lot of
[1:23:27] mistakes well so have I but great is his
[1:23:32] faithfulness when you think when he was
[1:23:35] there at
[1:23:36] Gethsemane and he's come now to what he
[1:23:39] was brought what to
[1:23:42] fulfill what he was born on Earth
[1:23:46] for that Plan of Redemption all that God
[1:23:49] had planned from before the foundation
[1:23:51] of the world the decision has to be made
[1:23:53] then will I or will I
[1:23:57] not father let this cup pass from me
[1:24:01] father is there some other way to
[1:24:03] perform to get this done without me
[1:24:06] having to shed my own life and shed my
[1:24:09] own
[1:24:11] blood but he said not my will but thy
[1:24:15] will be
[1:24:16] done and for me he was
[1:24:19] bruised for me he was
[1:24:21] broken for me he was ripped apart
[1:24:26] raise your hand if you know it was for
[1:24:28] you
[1:24:28] too for me he was he was as a scripture
[1:24:32] Isaiah says you didn't even recognize
[1:24:35] him he was so beaten I think it was
[1:24:37] brother Nathaniel Johnson the ones that
[1:24:39] spoke a few times and gave such a
[1:24:41] description of the whipping and the
[1:24:43] beating and the cutting the bruising and
[1:24:44] the breaking the part that he
[1:24:47] did and the father's looking at him and
[1:24:50] he's saying it's not enough yet it's not
[1:24:53] enough yet no 30 5 whippings would not
[1:24:57] be
[1:25:00] sufficient he would have to have every
[1:25:02] single one the blood would have to be
[1:25:04] shed every one of the scriptures would
[1:25:07] have to be filled
[1:25:08] before he said it is sufficient it is
[1:25:13] finished why for
[1:25:16] me for you every part of
[1:25:20] it he had already seen the scripture and
[1:25:23] David uses it here I will not suffer my
[1:25:26] Holy One to see
[1:25:29] corruption so he had to he had that
[1:25:32] expectation that he had already said
[1:25:35] this destroy this Temple and I will
[1:25:36] raise it in three days speaking of
[1:25:40] himself not the temple they were looking
[1:25:42] looking at the prophecies and when he
[1:25:44] cries out it is
[1:25:45] finished he knew it had all been taken
[1:25:48] care of it was
[1:25:50] accepted in my stad and your stead so
[1:25:54] here David is speaking and he says in
[1:25:56] verse one preserve me oh
[1:25:59] God for in
[1:26:01] thee do I put my
[1:26:06] trust H for in thee do I take refuge in
[1:26:10] thee do I cast myself in thee do I let
[1:26:15] you have preeminence all of it Lord
[1:26:18] because I trust
[1:26:19] you I can't trust
[1:26:22] myself because today today I'm gung-ho
[1:26:26] and go and tomorrow I'm
[1:26:28] not or maybe right now I am and in the
[1:26:31] moment I'm no
[1:26:32] longer we can change
[1:26:34] quickly wake up in the morning feeling
[1:26:37] fine you wake up and you get a phone
[1:26:38] call and you get some
[1:26:40] news and boy your countenance change
[1:26:43] your heart breaks something happened you
[1:26:46] were expecting some good news You're
[1:26:47] Expecting but you get something opposite
[1:26:49] of that and suddenly changes but he
[1:26:52] never fails
[1:26:55] he
[1:26:59] says oh my soul thou H has said unto the
[1:27:03] Lord Thou Art my
[1:27:06] Lord my goodness extendeth not to
[1:27:11] thee David is saying here he says my
[1:27:14] soul thou has said unto the Lord Thou
[1:27:16] Art my
[1:27:17] Lord but nothing good have I done to
[1:27:22] return it back to you to deserve it as
[1:27:25] you look at some of the translations do
[1:27:26] some you realize some of the wording and
[1:27:29] I like to do that because sometimes you
[1:27:30] might think it's saying this but this is
[1:27:32] what he's trying to say and you know God
[1:27:35] allowed brother brandom to show us so
[1:27:36] many times he would say this is what but
[1:27:38] this is what God was
[1:27:40] telling and that's what the reason of
[1:27:42] the holy spirit in your life because he
[1:27:45] can tell you this is what I mean this is
[1:27:47] what I mean he says nothing good have I
[1:27:50] done to deserve this Lord there's
[1:27:51] nothing that you would say well I owe
[1:27:53] this to David because he's good at this
[1:27:55] David is saying I don't have that he
[1:27:57] says at all nothing to offer you that
[1:27:59] way outside of Here I Am
[1:28:02] Lord and God says come unto me and I
[1:28:05] will give you
[1:28:07] rest he didn't say come but you got to
[1:28:10] be holy you got to prepare you got to do
[1:28:11] this you got to do this you got to meet
[1:28:13] all these
[1:28:14] standards and then I'll know he said
[1:28:16] come unto me all ye that are heavy
[1:28:20] laden so you got troubles you got
[1:28:23] baggage you've got problem but he said
[1:28:25] come unto me
[1:28:30] anyways but to the saints that are in
[1:28:32] the Earth and to the excellent in whom
[1:28:35] is all my delight he said none of my
[1:28:37] good nothing that I have good to offer
[1:28:40] is for you Lord because you need it
[1:28:44] because it's the only way no but what
[1:28:46] he's saying but what I have done here
[1:28:48] what I'm sharing is for those who will
[1:28:50] read this who will hear this to the
[1:28:53] saints that are on the the Earth and in
[1:28:55] in my heart to do so but you know that's
[1:28:58] Christ speaking through David but David
[1:29:00] is sharing these words to encourage one
[1:29:03] my brother to lift up my brother to you
[1:29:06] know and and it's not to make God great
[1:29:09] he's great
[1:29:12] already we worship and adore him it
[1:29:15] doesn't make him greater in the sense no
[1:29:18] but it we are giving him what he
[1:29:20] deserved we are doing it you know in in
[1:29:23] appreciation to him that's what David is
[1:29:24] saying but to the Saints to my brother
[1:29:26] and my sister this is why I'm saying
[1:29:29] this is what I'm doing so they can be
[1:29:31] encouraged in it
[1:29:33] also and then he says this and it's a
[1:29:35] strange scripture to me right in the
[1:29:37] middle their sorrows shall be
[1:29:39] multiplied that hasten after another God
[1:29:43] I wonder how David knew
[1:29:45] that by experience Maybe by watching
[1:29:49] what happened by seeing somebody else's
[1:29:52] life by going through it himself
[1:29:55] and brother Peter talked about some
[1:29:58] Gods lukewarm and cold oh I would never
[1:30:02] go serve a god like that or I would
[1:30:03] never go serve this God and put a you
[1:30:05] know a name I'd never go serve the
[1:30:08] trinity in him but what else have you
[1:30:10] put between you and God because that
[1:30:13] becomes a god what is occupying your
[1:30:15] time what is causing that to happen and
[1:30:19] not all of it is
[1:30:21] bad you got to go to work
[1:30:24] but to some work becomes their
[1:30:27] God you know I I I worked with enough
[1:30:31] people to to see that just it was never
[1:30:33] enough never enough I got to have that
[1:30:35] last dollar got to have that last dollar
[1:30:36] it was just never
[1:30:38] enough and you've heard this and I've
[1:30:41] mentioned it too never at the end of
[1:30:43] somebody's dying days they say oh my I
[1:30:46] spent way too much time with my family I
[1:30:48] should have been a whole lot more at
[1:30:50] work but you hear the other way around
[1:30:54] I spent way too much time away and not
[1:30:57] enough time with
[1:30:58] them he says their sorrow shall be
[1:31:02] multiplied that H hasten after another
[1:31:05] God that drink their offerings of blood
[1:31:09] their drink offerings of blood will I
[1:31:12] not offer and I I just want to bring
[1:31:14] that a little bit to our language will
[1:31:18] sweat have you've heard we'll sweat
[1:31:19] blood we'll give all our toils we'll
[1:31:22] give something
[1:31:26] but it's for our own good for our own
[1:31:28] benefit to get what we want and David
[1:31:32] said I won't do
[1:31:33] that I've tried it it's not
[1:31:37] satisfying nor take up their names into
[1:31:41] my lips now we could put the names of
[1:31:43] different gods there but you go down in
[1:31:46] your life and see what those names are
[1:31:47] in your life what are the things that
[1:31:50] occupy a lot of your time what are the
[1:31:52] things you know and and it it's to our
[1:31:54] shame a lot of
[1:31:57] this
[1:32:00] um there's uh people that you hear and
[1:32:02] you know and there seems like their Joy
[1:32:06] was to talk about their afflictions how
[1:32:08] much pain they were in how hard they
[1:32:09] were having how good it just seems like
[1:32:11] that's all they did they wanted your
[1:32:14] sympathy they wanted your sorrow they
[1:32:16] didn't really want healing
[1:32:19] though I don't know I think I would
[1:32:21] rather take my healing and end that
[1:32:22] conversation right about
[1:32:24] in I'm the Lord God that Health all thy
[1:32:29] diseases by thy stripes we ye are healed
[1:32:32] by my stripes he says and people get
[1:32:35] caught up in this and that and this
[1:32:37] nonsense and that he says look I won't
[1:32:40] take those names up I won't spend my
[1:32:42] time in
[1:32:43] that it robs me of my energy it robs me
[1:32:46] of my strength it robs me of my time it
[1:32:49] robs me of my family and it definitely
[1:32:51] robs me of my time with God
[1:32:58] he
[1:33:02] says their sorrows let's go to verse
[1:33:05] five
[1:33:10] now he says the Lord is the portion of
[1:33:12] mine inheritance and of my
[1:33:15] cup I want God in all of that I want him
[1:33:20] Jehovah the Lord God Almighty and as and
[1:33:23] today our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:33:26] Christ thou maintain my
[1:33:29] lot that which you have planned for me
[1:33:31] when you take my lot this is my lot this
[1:33:34] is what God has ordained for me this is
[1:33:36] the what David is saying you maintain it
[1:33:39] you care for it you take care of it you
[1:33:41] make sure it comes to pass you know we
[1:33:44] could look at that in the in the natural
[1:33:46] uh maintain your own lot keep your own
[1:33:49] yard clean you know we would look at it
[1:33:51] that way some do some don't
[1:33:54] but if you own this piece of property
[1:33:56] and you want to sell it you're going to
[1:33:58] spend some time getting it ready for
[1:34:03] sale he says he maintains us everything
[1:34:07] that he has for us everything about us
[1:34:09] and Us in it David is saying you
[1:34:12] maintain this it's not me you that which
[1:34:15] you saw for me that which you gave to me
[1:34:18] you will be sure that I get it another
[1:34:22] way he says it it's let me here he
[1:34:29] says let me get back to that
[1:34:32] here says so he said we should not be
[1:34:35] worried about tomorrow because God is
[1:34:37] our support and stability you're
[1:34:40] maintaining everything of
[1:34:43] us I don't worry about tomorrow I just
[1:34:46] live from day to day I don't borrow from
[1:34:49] his
[1:34:50] troubles hey today's got sufficient not
[1:34:53] look for tomorrows
[1:34:57] H the lines are Fallen unto me in
[1:35:00] Pleasant places God has given you a
[1:35:02] portion he's divided it if could I say
[1:35:05] just like he did it with the tribes of
[1:35:06] Israel they had their portion they have
[1:35:08] place he says God
[1:35:10] maintains or the lines of following are
[1:35:12] in a pleasant
[1:35:14] places God
[1:35:16] has for
[1:35:19] you every good thing
[1:35:24] and then he saysi have a
[1:35:26] goodly
[1:35:29] Heritage he says the places Fair are the
[1:35:33] places marked out for me I have a noble
[1:35:36] Heritage
[1:35:38] nobility that which belongs in the Royal
[1:35:42] palaces when we think about somebody
[1:35:44] Noble we usually talk about the Kings
[1:35:46] and the queens and all of that that goes
[1:35:48] around with that nobility you know um
[1:35:51] and and he's a king of kings he's the
[1:35:53] Lord of Lords and you're his
[1:35:55] wife you're part of the bride of Christ
[1:35:58] David is saying I have a goodly Heritage
[1:36:02] all that God has promis I Will Bless The
[1:36:04] Lord I will give him honor I will give
[1:36:08] him glory I will exalt him in all of
[1:36:11] this he says who ha given me counsel and
[1:36:14] I really like this he has given me
[1:36:16] counsel my Reigns also instruct me in
[1:36:19] the night Seasons my
[1:36:22] thoughts you the the word the Reigns is
[1:36:25] is is then there is his thought he
[1:36:28] says he says
[1:36:32] um when you look at the night season as
[1:36:36] I was reading that thinking about it how
[1:36:37] many times has God woken you up with
[1:36:41] something putting something in your
[1:36:43] heart giving you a good dream answering
[1:36:46] you a question placing a scripture
[1:36:48] placing a song I know he's done it for
[1:36:51] me many of times even this afternoon I
[1:36:54] was after I got home from work I was
[1:36:55] resting and just some songs came to my
[1:36:57] heart
[1:36:58] just I wasn't saying about but they were
[1:37:01] part of my thinking process and it
[1:37:02] reminded me of the scripture he
[1:37:05] says the Reigns or the thoughts the
[1:37:07] action you give me good ones you allowed
[1:37:10] that to happen you know because you can
[1:37:12] get caught up in your own thoughts and
[1:37:14] the fear of it all but David is saying
[1:37:16] he says you also instruct me in the
[1:37:19] night SE even while I'm sleeping the
[1:37:21] dreams and the thoughts and the
[1:37:23] impressions
[1:37:24] and in The Nearness of God around you
[1:37:26] how many times has he done that for
[1:37:30] you he says I have set the lord always
[1:37:34] before me because he is at my right hand
[1:37:37] I shall not be
[1:37:39] moved right hand refers to strength an
[1:37:43] anchor a solidness he
[1:37:46] says I Look to Him First in all
[1:37:50] things not third not second not forth
[1:37:54] okay Lord now I've got some time for you
[1:37:57] I had to get all of this done and this
[1:37:59] done and this done first okay Lord now I
[1:38:01] got some time for you and then you
[1:38:03] realize this and this didn't work
[1:38:05] out or had you looked to him first he
[1:38:09] might have said leave those alone they
[1:38:11] won't be good for you he says Look to
[1:38:14] Him First on all things in every
[1:38:17] situation and in all circumstances Look
[1:38:21] to Him First
[1:38:23] Lord I commit this day to you I commit
[1:38:26] my thoughts I commit my actions whatever
[1:38:28] it's going to be I commit it to you
[1:38:30] first Lord I remind myself and I even
[1:38:33] brother bam says many times he loves to
[1:38:36] re be reminded of his word he loves for
[1:38:38] you to challenge him God you
[1:38:40] said and he says I did watch me
[1:38:44] do he says so you commit it to him you
[1:38:47] give it to him
[1:38:49] first all my plans all my ideas all my
[1:38:52] thoughts Lord Lord I need to go through
[1:38:55] bring them through this
[1:38:58] first do they fit within this or are
[1:39:01] they outside of the God's
[1:39:03] work I have these ideas I have these
[1:39:05] Ambitions I have I have this I like to
[1:39:07] do and there's nothing wrong with that
[1:39:09] brother brandham tells us he says plant
[1:39:11] your crops do the things you do like
[1:39:14] he's not coming for a hundred
[1:39:16] years but live like he's coming
[1:39:19] today unfortunately most of it goes the
[1:39:22] other way they live like he's not coming
[1:39:25] for a hundred years but only plann for
[1:39:27] one
[1:39:28] day you see the failure and the opposite
[1:39:31] of what God wants us today because he is
[1:39:34] your
[1:39:35] strength he is
[1:39:39] amen and then in verse n he said
[1:39:41] therefore my heart is glad and my glory
[1:39:44] rejoices My Flesh shall also Rest In
[1:39:48] Hope even when God puts you at peace
[1:39:52] even this part can be at PE you take
[1:39:55] what God's word says about you and watch
[1:39:59] when you begin to confess what God says
[1:40:01] about
[1:40:02] you because you can start confessing the
[1:40:05] opposite I don't feel good I hurt I'm
[1:40:08] tired I'm weary nobody likes me and boy
[1:40:13] does the mood change
[1:40:15] quickly you know it's we laugh about it
[1:40:18] but you know they say at the football
[1:40:19] game and the person that went to the
[1:40:21] football game had this this little thing
[1:40:22] about nobody liked him everybody had
[1:40:25] something to say so as soon as they
[1:40:26] huddle up it gets that idea that the
[1:40:28] Huddle they're talking about
[1:40:29] him now we laugh about it but if we're
[1:40:32] not careful we can get ourselves into
[1:40:33] that place oh that person that that
[1:40:36] person walked right by me didn't even
[1:40:37] say hello they must be upset me and then
[1:40:40] next thing you know you're upset and the
[1:40:42] person the next time you see them they
[1:40:43] say hi I haven't seen you in a while
[1:40:45] maybe their mind was elsewhere when they
[1:40:47] you know was one of the things I'm
[1:40:49] standing at the door and people are
[1:40:50] coming in saw it all the time
[1:40:54] some would come in God bless you brother
[1:40:56] and it's good to see you others walk
[1:40:57] right in the door without a
[1:41:00] word and the next time they came in hey
[1:41:03] good to see you brother and how you
[1:41:04] doing you know I could be hurt or I
[1:41:07] could just say God bless you brother
[1:41:08] good to see you
[1:41:10] too what was your action what was your
[1:41:13] we had a brother that was helping us and
[1:41:16] I told him I said one of the things
[1:41:17] you're going to need to learn as you as
[1:41:18] you start to help
[1:41:20] us is you're going to hear things and
[1:41:23] you're going to find out things and
[1:41:25] you're going to see things about
[1:41:27] others and you have to be bigger than
[1:41:33] that I said because they will happen
[1:41:36] those things do
[1:41:38] happen and you
[1:41:40] know I I as as you guys know I'm one of
[1:41:43] the most serious person you ever
[1:41:45] met I think I even laugh at my sleep
[1:41:49] sometimes but there was a sister coming
[1:41:52] in and we got along
[1:41:54] fine and she was coming in with another
[1:41:57] sister at the door and I won't say the
[1:41:58] names but neither one are here
[1:42:02] so and I opened the door for them to
[1:42:05] come in and um the sister in front I
[1:42:09] looked back at the sister behind her and
[1:42:10] I said sister if this sister hadn't been
[1:42:12] here with you I would have never opened
[1:42:13] the door for
[1:42:15] you and she knew me already she just
[1:42:18] started laughing the other sister around
[1:42:20] turned around and she surprised me she
[1:42:21] goes oh brother give it to her just give
[1:42:23] it to her she deserves it we had a good
[1:42:26] laugh but there's others that I would
[1:42:28] have never done that
[1:42:29] to because who knows how they would have
[1:42:32] reacted and brother Peter was just a
[1:42:35] young boy brother Jerry was
[1:42:38] helping back there also myself and
[1:42:41] brother Jerry brother Al Peterson was
[1:42:42] kind
[1:42:43] of coaching us just just teaching us you
[1:42:47] know being a mentor to us brother
[1:42:50] Peter's I don't know four or five years
[1:42:52] old maybe and brother Jerry had him back
[1:42:54] there and there was nobody at the door
[1:42:57] and brother Jerry goes now he said Peter
[1:42:59] son I need to show you he says when they
[1:43:02] come up to the door just at reaching
[1:43:04] push it back and they'll fall over and
[1:43:07] he started saying all these things and
[1:43:09] I've never seen this sight of brother
[1:43:13] Jerry and Peter I remember Peter's face
[1:43:15] he's looking at his dad like are you
[1:43:17] serious
[1:43:19] father and I'm standing and Jerry has
[1:43:21] just got the straightest face and he's
[1:43:23] talking about he's I want to put all of
[1:43:25] it because somebody might get mad at
[1:43:26] brother Jerry for what he
[1:43:28] said and and he's saying all these
[1:43:30] things and right about then a real big
[1:43:33] brother one of the bigger Brothers of
[1:43:34] the church come walking up and I reached
[1:43:37] over and I opened the door and as he
[1:43:38] walked by I told Brother Peter when a
[1:43:39] brother this size is walking you don't
[1:43:41] do anything to him because he'll throw
[1:43:44] you out the door
[1:43:45] himself and then brother Jerry started
[1:43:48] laughing he go brother you've never seen
[1:43:49] that sight of me have you I thought it
[1:43:51] would be fun for Peter
[1:43:54] you see a lot of things you hear a lot
[1:43:55] of things how are you going to react to
[1:43:58] them how are you going to do again
[1:44:01] here's therefore my heart is glad and my
[1:44:05] glory rejoices My Flesh shall also Rest
[1:44:08] In Hope Lord I seen these situations but
[1:44:12] I'm looking at what you
[1:44:14] said I'm looking at what you've given to
[1:44:17] me and in that will I even this man will
[1:44:22] be satisfied right in that he
[1:44:25] says and then he says this now we know
[1:44:27] Christ was going to fulfill this for
[1:44:30] thou will not leave my soul in hell but
[1:44:32] you know what I have that same promise
[1:44:35] to
[1:44:37] me neither WIIL thou suffer thine Holy
[1:44:40] One to see
[1:44:42] corruption Paul says it this way so when
[1:44:44] this corruptible shall put on
[1:44:47] incorruption and this Mortal shall have
[1:44:49] put on immortality then shall be brought
[1:44:52] to pass the saying that is written death
[1:44:55] is swallowed up in Victory de oh death
[1:44:58] where is I sting oh grave where is th
[1:45:01] Victory because he did it for you you
[1:45:04] have that
[1:45:05] promise and this is what David is saying
[1:45:07] my heart rejoices in this job looked at
[1:45:11] it differently the first book written in
[1:45:13] the Bible job looks at it a little
[1:45:15] differently he says I've see the the
[1:45:17] flower come up in Spring I see it grow
[1:45:20] through the summer and in Fall it begins
[1:45:23] weather and in Winter it
[1:45:24] dies but I see it come back up in Spring
[1:45:27] and he speaks of the leaves he speaks on
[1:45:29] but what happens to man I've seen them
[1:45:31] put in the grave over and over and I've
[1:45:33] never seen one rise
[1:45:39] again there is a Resurrection
[1:45:44] coming and then job cries out something
[1:45:47] in job cries out I know my redeemer
[1:45:51] liveth and with these eyes eyes I shall
[1:45:53] see
[1:45:55] him we're looking at thou will suffer
[1:45:58] not suffer thy Holy One to see
[1:46:00] corruption you are part of him when he
[1:46:04] died you died when he arose you
[1:46:08] arose you can take these scriptures and
[1:46:11] apply them to
[1:46:13] yourself I love it where Paul says oh
[1:46:16] death where is thy sting oh grave where
[1:46:20] is thy
[1:46:21] Victory then he says th thou will show
[1:46:23] me the path of life for in thy presence
[1:46:26] is fullness of joy at thy right hand are
[1:46:31] Pleasures forever more you will make
[1:46:34] clear to me the way of
[1:46:37] life if he's sitting next to you if he's
[1:46:40] living in you if he's with you and
[1:46:42] you've got questions you got something
[1:46:44] you understand and you talk to him he
[1:46:46] can make it clear he can make it plain
[1:46:49] Jesus says father I thank you for hiding
[1:46:53] this from the wise and The Prudent those
[1:46:54] that think that they could do it on
[1:46:56] their own by their own understanding by
[1:46:57] their learning by their books and have
[1:47:00] revealed it to babes such as would learn
[1:47:03] who would say teach me Father show me
[1:47:06] father let me see it your
[1:47:09] way he says you'll make it clear where
[1:47:14] you are Joy is
[1:47:17] complete when you're filling down when
[1:47:20] you're filling without Joy take a quick
[1:47:21] inventory
[1:47:23] where is God in
[1:47:26] this because if he's with you there
[1:47:29] should be a joy there does that means
[1:47:31] you don't suffer does that mean you
[1:47:32] don't have pain no but Paul I Paul says
[1:47:35] I can do all things through Christ who
[1:47:36] strengthens me because where he is is
[1:47:39] joy in your right hand or in in your
[1:47:42] strength in all that you that's the the
[1:47:44] right hand is speaking of the power the
[1:47:46] glory nothing can defeat the right hand
[1:47:48] of God there's Pleasures forever and
[1:47:52] ever
[1:47:54] all that he imagined all that he desired
[1:47:56] all that he wanted for you he's
[1:47:59] accomplished he will
[1:48:01] do show the thought deny your thoughts
[1:48:06] and take God at his
[1:48:09] word Lord I I'm struggling through this
[1:48:13] but your word says you're my strength
[1:48:16] you're my help Lord my body is is going
[1:48:19] through a hard but by thy Stripes I am
[1:48:22] healed
[1:48:24] Lord my mind is a a in a turmoil but you
[1:48:28] said you're my peace you're my
[1:48:31] joy Lord I I I I'm I'm having trouble
[1:48:34] getting along but you said love covers a
[1:48:37] multitude of
[1:48:38] sins Lord and your love is in me you
[1:48:41] said because of your presence in me I
[1:48:44] can love another
[1:48:46] one if if perfect love as brother Bram
[1:48:49] talked about perfect love and he talks
[1:48:51] about that and he's talking about
[1:48:52] walking across that that pasture and
[1:48:55] that bull comes out and he said
[1:48:57] something in him took over the situation
[1:49:00] and spoke to that bull and that bull
[1:49:03] rested down on him is he not the same
[1:49:07] yesterday today and
[1:49:08] forever what about a situation at home
[1:49:12] what about a situation between a brother
[1:49:14] and a sister a husband a wife a mother
[1:49:16] father and children sometimes they can
[1:49:19] get hard sometimes they can get tough
[1:49:21] but let the love of God
[1:49:23] L because it's Christ in you already
[1:49:26] take over that
[1:49:28] situation you know I I say this to my
[1:49:32] shame but it was a lesson to be
[1:49:34] learned I had preached a
[1:49:37] message on love and
[1:49:41] fear had preached a couple of them this
[1:49:43] was some years ago and we were talking
[1:49:46] about having the love of God and when
[1:49:48] it's fear and this you know that's
[1:49:50] Satan's work because God doesn't work
[1:49:52] with fear Fe God works with through love
[1:49:54] but love is corrective love can be
[1:49:57] strong love can be
[1:49:59] gentle you know brother bam talked this
[1:50:01] way you know Johnny's playing in the
[1:50:03] middle of the street and the cars are
[1:50:04] coming Johnny get out of the street oh
[1:50:07] because I love him so much I don't want
[1:50:08] him to get hurt at my yelling well get
[1:50:11] him let him get run over by the car it
[1:50:12] would show you really didn't love him
[1:50:13] that much brother R said no you would go
[1:50:16] out there You' grab him you would drag
[1:50:17] him in out and I thank God he's done
[1:50:20] that to me at times when he's reached
[1:50:22] down and taken Me by here and dragged me
[1:50:24] out of that situation because he did
[1:50:26] love me he does love me he cares for me
[1:50:29] but other times it's just a sweet gentle
[1:50:31] word where he tells you he loves you you
[1:50:34] let the love of God and and and I had i'
[1:50:37] preach that you know and brother green
[1:50:39] head said some things to me when I just
[1:50:40] first started ministering and he's
[1:50:43] encouraging me and and helping us to
[1:50:45] grow in this
[1:50:46] and and he said brother Aaron he goes he
[1:50:49] just told me goes that was a masterpiece
[1:50:51] he said but I will tell you there all
[1:50:52] won't be
[1:50:54] masterpieces sometimes you'll struggle
[1:50:56] through a sermon you'll feel like you
[1:50:57] didn't deliver
[1:50:58] it so I was
[1:51:01] encouraged and then that very next week
[1:51:04] a situation came up at home and my
[1:51:06] reactions were not
[1:51:09] good and I regret to say I put my hands
[1:51:11] on one of my daughter and I threatened
[1:51:13] her and right about that
[1:51:17] time that message came ringing right
[1:51:19] back through me what did you just preach
[1:51:23] I opened the door I went to the house
[1:51:25] and I took off down the road crying
[1:51:28] saying God I
[1:51:29] failed and God said no you didn't I put
[1:51:31] you to the
[1:51:33] test and now you've learned now you
[1:51:36] learn God puts you to a test because he
[1:51:39] loves you because he cares for you
[1:51:42] because he knows you are gold he's not
[1:51:45] looking for gold gold is in you he's
[1:51:47] going to bring it
[1:51:49] out and who what is gold it represents
[1:51:52] God
[1:51:53] it's Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:51:56] deny your own thoughts say Lord I'm not
[1:51:59] going to I'm not going to rest on how
[1:52:01] I'm thinking right now I'm going to rest
[1:52:03] on what your word says in fact I'm going
[1:52:04] to take your word and open it begin to
[1:52:07] read it over this I'm going to go to
[1:52:10] Psalms 23 the Lord is my shepherd I
[1:52:13] shall not
[1:52:14] want he maketh me to lie down in Green
[1:52:18] Pastures you know he he prepares a table
[1:52:21] in the presence of my enemy
[1:52:23] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:52:25] me that's God's
[1:52:27] word he says I will not leave Thee I
[1:52:30] will not forsake
[1:52:32] thee Lord I'm feeling alone but your
[1:52:34] word
[1:52:36] says and I'll take it but your word says
[1:52:39] over what my thoughts
[1:52:40] are and I would say Lord help us if the
[1:52:43] musicians would make their way up I
[1:52:45] would say Lord help us to say no to what
[1:52:49] is contrary to the word of God and say
[1:52:51] yes to the word of God at all times
[1:52:53] brother Bram says as quick as you can
[1:52:57] catch yourself and make it
[1:52:59] right because we do at times get
[1:53:02] ourselves into trouble but he said don't
[1:53:05] let it linger don't let it go on as
[1:53:07] quick as you can catch yourself and say
[1:53:09] I'm sorry Lord I'm sorry let me take
[1:53:13] what you said let me turn my heart at
[1:53:15] what you said let me meditate on the
[1:53:17] things that have life
[1:53:20] in amen
[1:53:23] Lord help me I put my hand up Lord help
[1:53:25] me to be that way all the time let me
[1:53:27] take you at your word let's bow our
[1:53:31] head lord it's it's hard at times to
[1:53:33] deny our thinking to deny our thoughts
[1:53:35] to deny our
[1:53:38] desires because they're not all
[1:53:41] bad sometimes our thoughts are are
[1:53:43] Pleasant our heart's desires are good
[1:53:46] and we we enjoy that time
[1:53:48] Lord but Lord sometimes we're resisting
[1:53:51] we're fighting
[1:53:53] we we're trying to tell you Lord but but
[1:53:55] Lord the way I'm thinking is how I
[1:53:57] really
[1:53:58] feel but you know that
[1:54:00] Lord but you said to confess your word
[1:54:04] your word will not return
[1:54:06] void it is not in
[1:54:08] effective if I confess my ailments and
[1:54:11] my pains and that's what I I I give life
[1:54:14] to but if I can confess Isaiah
[1:54:18] 53 if I can confess greater is he that
[1:54:21] is in you
[1:54:23] if we can go back and said it's deity in
[1:54:25] us she is Mrs Jesus Christ the word of
[1:54:28] God tells us that then this flesh can be
[1:54:31] put into
[1:54:32] subjection for greater is he that is in
[1:54:34] us than he that is in the world Lord in
[1:54:37] our times in our Hard Times Lord let us
[1:54:40] look to your word let us comfort oursel
[1:54:43] with your word Lord let us sing the
[1:54:44] songs of Zion Lord let us made meditate
[1:54:47] on those things that are good for us
[1:54:49] Lord is our prayer today in Jesus Christ
[1:54:52] Christ name
[1:54:55] amen you appreciate his goodness and his
[1:54:57] grace to you amen I I I surely would
[1:55:00] never say oh you're not going through
[1:55:02] what you're going
[1:55:03] through but I'm saying God is with you
[1:55:06] he never leaves you he said I'll be with
