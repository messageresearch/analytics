love amen you all did wonderful there guys you guys all passed the test I was thinking this morning or even this week I thought I should thank the congregation more for participating in all our little quirks and things we do and you just come in and bringing your lick of fire and singing and worshiping God it's certainly easier to lead worship when you all are worshiping as well rather than it just being just a performance or us it's just up there here singing for you all but it it really helps when you are singing and so thank you for that I know sometimes in the last 5 years we've been a smaller congregation maybe going through different things a little quieter but you all have helped put your shoulder to the wheel and I appreciate that so thank you for doing that for us amen I'm going to ask brother Dan Roberts if you would just come and just open the service with a word of prayer and take these requests that they been turned in Sister Elizabeth Beth Gara Beth is asking prayer for herself she is not feeling well she also asks for healing for insomnia God bless you and thank you for praying also I don't see brother Peter and sister Lydia mcfaden here tonight I don't see them so I think my understanding was Sister Lydia wasn't feeling well so let's just remember them in prayer and that's why they weren't here this morning um we weren't sure how much that was but at any rate let's just remember them in prayer and the needs that were mentioned this morning and those on the WhatsApp let's just remember each one in prayer let's just sing that song I'm not my own I belong to Jesus he purchased me I'm all his amen as brother Dan comes I'm not my own I belong to Jesus he purchased me I'm all his god with a price the blood of Jesus I'm not my own I am his let's sing this as a song of surrender one more time I'm not my own I belong to Jesus he purchased me I'm all his the with a price the blood of Jesus I'm not my own I'm all [Music] his uh let's pray Lord we just come to you father as your needy people Lord and we just want to praise you and thank you for this day today that be able to worship you and to raise you and lift you up father for all the glorious great things you've done in our lives over time and and helping uh heal and touch each person in here in our needs father uh we have some needs we want to bring forth to you today uh a sister's not able to get through the night with sleep Lord and anybody that's faced that challenge uh knows just how troubling it could be that uh you just don't have the energy or the strength the next day to carry on you feel like you're dragon lord and we just ask you to reach out and touch her and give her that strength and comfort her father and let her know that you're with her Lord we ask you to be with the mcfadin father that they could be healthy again and and our sister there would be able to feel better have some kids to take care of Lord and it's always a challenge when the kids have more energy than you do so we just ask you to touch her father and be with her and be with each unspoken request Lord sometimes we feel like those three in the fire this morning Father where we're standing by ourselves uh but you are with us Lord and we just give everything to you and put it on your altar we pray that we can be the Daniel Lord that we can stand strong against all enemies even if we're standing alone Lord we know that we're standing with you and we give you all the praise and glory father and please answer these needs Lord and bless this service in Jesus name we pray amen you may be seated this evening [Music] amen just thought I'd give a little testimony I was thinking about it there and wasn't really even on my mind but the Matthew had said well that sounded like a real the Watkins had said that sounds like a real testimony so maybe I should share it I as you all know in March when Co hit essentially our line of work that I was in just shut down wasn't that I specifically lost my job but it was just a matter of time and the owners were real good to just say you know if you find something else just go do that the Lord blessed me with a couple different things between now and then and I wasn't exactly looking for something different but the Lord saw it fit to just bring something by my path and it just is a real big blessing because it's significant pay increase from what I'm currently doing with the government and it's more than I've actually ever made with a lot of opportunity and keeping me challenged and so I just want to thank the Lord for just being mindful of us us it's not something like I said I was exactly looking for I was fairly content to say well Lord if this is where you'd like me this is where I'll be but the Lord knows everything amen also I've had a few people at least two people today and number of people the last couple of weeks asked me most out of town but I had two people today asked me if Harmony was happening this year and the decision was made this week that it's going to be canell um at least for Tucson January 2021 um will be cancelled there's a potentially may do something later in the year back east or do something like he did this past fall he did a small mini Harmony I think he called it harmony with Believers in Idaho um Bobby might do something like that again back east or something else but as far as January Harmony here in Tucson that has been cancelled just number of reasons but the primary one being covid uh 19 just not sure what the authorities would would consider and everything and so the decision was made to cancel that for this year so um I think that was all the announcements I had I was going to mention this I thought it was another little Testament last not this Satur past Saturday not yesterday but yesterday a week ago it was actually what three two Sundays ago have been when brother DDA or brother Diggs was here that was 55 years the church being open brother green started the church 55 years ago and last Saturday a week ago was 55 years ago brother Brandon preached in the old Tabernacle what house will you build me thought it's just a testament the Lord's kept this this church and the things he's he's wanted us to do is not us as individuals but us as a congregation and the Lord's kept this this work in this little Lighthouse along the road where weary pilgrims can come and find rest amen just want to thank the Lord for that as well amen just sing maybe one song and then we're GNA ask Bel to come up he's got something to share on his heart hopefully I didn't say anything you were going to share but uh he's got something on his heart let's just sing Our God is tremendous strength never faileth goes through the [Music] s when

that really blessed me this month that I found out you probably all know about it and it's old news for you but it was new news for me even if it's 73 years old let me uh yeah and it's all about November 29th so I had a brief thought I asked to share with you and uh I'm closing now so I just have five minutes to go you can start your stopwatches in in Jeremiah 30:1 we read the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying thus speaketh the Lord God of Israel saying write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book well to what end would that be just like we heard about Psalm 78 this morning tell our children our children's children what Jeremiah had wasn't for them then but he says for Lo the days come saeth the Lord that I will bring again the Captivity of My People Israel and Judah saeth the Lord and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers and they shall possess it today is November 29th 2020 I'd like you to Journey back in time with me some 73 years the year is 1947 my name is El eer sukenic I came to Palestine in 1911 from Eastern Europe I'm an archaeologist and a professor at the Hebrew University in West Jerusalem here in Palestine this land is under the control of the British government as the result of a mandate to administer this territory following the breakup of the Ottoman Empire after defeat in World War I this mandate was awarded to Great Britain by the now defunct League of Nations at the end of that war this is a very dangerous time here in 1947 Jews Arabs are engaged in a struggle over this place the British are unable to maintain order an Undeclared state of War exists here and every day it gets more dangerous to venture from Jewish areas to Arab ones and vice versa snipers are everywhere no one feels safe from their bullets or from attacks from terrorists on both sides after the Holocaust that killed more than six million of my people the survivors are yet today after two and a half years still herded into camps surrounded by barbed wire not allowed to return to their homes they're not allowed to come here either though most want to America allows only tiny trickle of this displaced Humanity to enter we have enemies on every side I'm reminded of the words of David but I trusted in thee oh Lord I said Thou Art my God my times are in thy hand deliver me from the hand of mine enemies and from them that persecute me but recently in spite of all this I have heard of a possible mind of ancient documents I've examined a tiny fragment of such a document a scroll and I read on it a phrase from the book of Isaiah a friend and I met a few days ago that I might borrow this scrap to see if it's indeed ancient or just another forgery I'm convinced it's real and today I travel with him to Bethlehem that's dangerous Journey it's in the Arab section of this area to see about purchasing the entire scroll along with two others that I am told are part of the same find I Must disguise myself as an Arab and sneak across to East Jerusalem and then to Bethlehem it's a good thing I'm fluent an Arabic or I'd never make this journey and hope to return with my life surely the Lord will forgive me for traveling today for it's Shabbat Saturday November 29th 1947 look I've obtained three Scrolls they were found in clay pots and a cave near kurbat kumran down by the Dead Sea this fragment I'm showing you are four columns from the book of Isaiah I must study these documents Professor sukenik then sat in his home well past midnight studying what we now know as the Dead Sea Scrolls then his youngest son burst into the study he announced that the United Nations General Assembly had just voted and passed resolution 181 to partition Palestine and allow the creation of a Jewish State the very same day that the first person was able to read the first scroll Jeremiah 30:3 again for Lo the days come saeth the Lord that I will bring again the Captivity of My People Israel and Judah sayeth the Lord and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers and they shall possess it amen I wanted to remind you that today November 29 is the anniversary of the UN resolution that led to the establishment of modern Israel and to share that that very same day for the first time in nearly 2,000 years the first of the Dead Sea Scrolls Scrolls that demonstrate the Integrity of biblical transcription over the centuries were read they had been found in a cave several months before but Professor sukenik was the first person to see them who could read them they came into his possession at Great risk to his life on the very same day he was reading them at the very moments the vote was taken and announced many of you may have already known this but it only came to my attention a few weeks ago and I had to share thank you God bless you [Applause] amen amen right let's just stand this evening we're going to turn the service over to brother Matthew he was saying to me how much he enjoyed that song we sang this morning so we'll try it again I keep listening for a different sound and you guys won't have to hear any more of the songs we sang this [Music] morning start with the we hear about wars see famine in the Land There are questions in the children's eyes trouble in the East again the whole world is shaking there's no sure place

groom oh I keep listening I keep listening I keep listening for for a different sound I remember the preacher saying son it shall come to pass there will come a generation that will be the very last I

different brother Aaron but uh brother Aaron Oglesby is a good friend of mine wonderful friend his brother Tim pritz there in Louisiana his son-in-law and uh he's came and spoke I've heard him a few times and he just been a real blessing the Lord really put it upon my heart to have him come amen so you just be an expectation and in prayer for those Services one more thing is uh we're praying about not sure yet but we're just pray and I want you to pray also um for a watch Night Service this year at the end of this year year if there is an end of this year if there's not it won't hurt my feelings one bit um but if there is an end of this year we're going to have Lord willing just keep that in prayer not it's not certain so we don't want to announce it yet but at that time we'd like to do communion and foot washing uh at the same time and so we'll have that and I have some ideas for that I was just telling the brothers there in the back and uh just thought it would be uh would be good amen to have that so if we don't have communion in foot washing watch night we are mindful of that and we want to have that uh soon before the end of the year so just keep that Amen in prayer you do you love him this evening amen isn't he wonderful to us I told you first uh Samuel 14 and that's not where we're going to turn ah had that before me but uh I want you to turn actually to the book of uh Psalms again if we could amen we're just going to read that one more time Psalms chapter 78 then I'll have you be seated verse one Psalms chapter 78 thank you brother l so appreciated that also wanted to say that I I didn't know that amen at all and so that was just uh just such a blessing to hear amen it's a special date today amen or yesterday it was so all right Psalms chapter 78 we'd like to just continue from this morning my people I want to read you this I'm going to read it from a different translation follow along with me in the King James my people hear my teaching listen to the words of my mouth I will open my mouth with a parable I will utter hidden things things from old things we have heard and known and he makes that clear this is something we've heard and we've known but it's not and he says things and things our ancestors have told us we will not hide them from their descendants we will tell the Next Generation the praiseworthy Deeds of the Lord his power and his wonders he has done he decreed statutes for Jacob and established the law in Israel which he commanded our ancestors to teach their children so the Next Generation would know them even the children yet to be born and they in turn would tell their children then they would put their trust in God and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands they would not be like their ancestors a stubborn and rebellious generation whose Hearts were not loyal to God whose Spirits were not faithful to him notice here in verse 12 he did miracles in the sight of their ancestors and in the land of Egypt in the regions of zoanne he divided the sea and led them through he made the water stand up like a wall imagine that he guided them with the cloud by day and with the light from the fire all night he split the rocks in the wilderness and gave them water as abundant as the Seas he brought streams out of a rocky Crag and made water flow down like Rivers Lord Jesus we thank you for your word tonight we've read it Lord and and I just want you to take preeminence now Lord in this evening service you've already blessed us Lord and visited us this morning been with us throughout the day Lord and I just pray for that same nearness that same presence Lord to come and draw close once again tonight father for we raise our hands together Lord as a body and say we we're we we're thirsty tonight Lord for a drink from Heaven we're hungry Lord in our souls for Mana from on high would you feed it to us Lord Jesus we pray we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated tonight we left off here with this story of Daniel and we learned about Verse 18 faith faith that says even if even if God doesn't deliver me know this oh King I'll still not bow I believe it's this kind of Faith as we spoke on this morning that we need now more than ever before we need that type of faith more than ever before to say Lord even if I'm still going to believe even if I'm still going to go forward and I preached this morning that that was faith that fights fear Faith That Conquers fear fear is as we spoke on this morning and said so much about it uh the there's a there's a promise in Luke chapter 1 and I just want to read it to you in verse 68 you can pull it on the screen if you want brother Jeremy it says blessed be blessed be the Lord God for he hath visited and redeemed his people and hath raised up a horn of salvation for us notice this uh he has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David we know who he's speaking of here uh being Christ and he says in verse 70 and he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets which have been since the world began that we should be saved from our enemies now here's the promise that God gives to each and every single uh one of his children that we should be saved from our enemies so the the the victory at Calvary brought us this promise that we should be saved from our enemies I'm thankful for that to perform the mercy promised notice this to perform I'll finish the verse there from enemies and from the hand of all that hate us to perform the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember His Holy Covenant the oath which he swore to Our Father Abraham that he would Grant unto us that we being in delivered listen to this out of the hand of our enemies that's one thing to be grateful to say Lord I'm I'm glad you've delivered me out of the hand of the devil I'm I'm not I'm not uh I've been purchased I've been bought with the price I'm not my own I belong to the Savior but with that comes This Promise he says that he would Grant unto us this that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear might serve him without fear in Holiness and righteousness before him I love this all the days of our life say brother Matt how can I how can I serve the Lord I'm free from I'm free from my enemies but with that promise also comes a promise to be able to serve the Lord free from Fear how long all the days of my life and so God speaks this promise to a to knowing that it was uh swearing it by a covenant to Abraham but but there's a there's such a embedded promise here that we find that the that the Savior would Deliver us from our enemies but also that that that he would enable us or that he would he would he would enable us to serve him without fear in Holiness and right ousness all the days of our life I'm glad for that and so it's amazing because when you think about this here when you think about even this climate as we said this morning in the world that we see today is such a climate of fear that we live in and it's it's a it's it's always if you study the lives of God's family all the way especially if you study through the Old Testament you know what you'll always come up with is that when whenever it came to battle whenever it came to any kind of of of of military operation no matter what king it was under you you'll most of the time always find a characteristic about the enemy and God's family and here was the characteristic God's family was almost always outnumbered they almost always were outgunned they were almost always were outmanned God almost always put his family always in this spot of out of a of a climate of fear when you looked at the outward circumstance because who naturally would not get scared or begin to get fearful when you look at your army of 200,000 and you're look going up against an army with 1.5 million it seems 200,000 sounds like a lot until you're coming against an army five or six times that size and God always intentionally puts his family against the fiery furnace where it looks impossible it looks like there's no way out he puts Daniel in the Lion's Den he puts Shadrach Meshach and abedo in a fiery furnace and he's always putting he's always putting his children in the place to where it looked like as far as numbers are concerned it's hopeless always outgunned always outnumbered always outmanned but always with God and that's why the Bible says With God all things are possible With God all things are possible and he always put them in a place of total dependence upon him this question always was put in the way God's family you say brother Matt what are you saying here tonight I'm saying that for you to trust the Lord for everything in your life is not unique to 2020 for you to have to trust the Lord for everything in your life is part of being a child of God since the beginning God's family has always been required to trust the Lord always they had to go with faith and faith we walk by faith and not by sight and the family of God has always had to trust they've always and and so because of this you'll find in the Psalms you'll find many times in the Psalms David beginning even before War uh before there was ever a great contest or a great battle and he was outnumbered and he'd begin to pray and he'd say many are they increased uh that trouble me uh many are they that surround me and it would David would always begin to sing songs uh and it what was those songs to do those those songs were to build up an atmosphere of Faith because if he didn't sing those songs all he could look at was what he seen with his own two eyes and what he could see with his own two eyes was an Army greater than his when he looked with his own two eyes all he seen was an impossible situation and but yet God put him in this situation to trust him and so what did David learn David learned that by music he could create the right atmosphere and the right atmosphere would produce faith and Faith would produce the Victory and so you find David singing songs and he would begin to sing for thou oh Lord are a shield for me you're the glory and the lifter up of mine head you go and read the psalm and he says many are they be increase that trouble me many there be which sa my soul there is no help for him and God say lie notice the words of the devil there are there is no help for me in God say l turn there Psalms 3 if you could just real quickly in the King James if you have your Bible I want you to turn there amen you love the Lord tonight I I want you to look at this and he says Lord this is a prayer here how are they increased that trouble me notice he's looking at numbers here how are they increased there there's so many they're overwhelming how many of us have prayed this in our own life Maybe not maybe you don't have to go and face a person with a shield and a sword and a chariot but you sometimes have to face impossible circumstances and situations that you know good and well that that there's no way that you're going to come out of this all right you know good and well that that left to your own demise left to your own it's going to be a demise and you know good and well what you're facing is impossible outside of the Lord coming in with mercy and intervening on your behalf and we've prayed this so many times Lord It's how how are they increase that trouble me many are they that rise up against me many there be which say of my soul there is no help for him in God say you know what the devil always tries to like to to put and and and and and and put over you constantly and be and listen let me say this here tonight I'm about to say something and and you're going to realize you're not the only one who who gets told this you know what the devil tells all of us it's hopeless ever had the will tell you that maybe not may maybe in a situation in your life and you say there there's just no way I mean I've tried I've given it my best shot but there's just no way it looks hopeless you know who loves hopelessness the enemy and the enemy loves nothing more than to get you in a mental state to where you believe your situation is hopeless but let me tell you something that's never hopeless with God he says many are they which r R up many are they how Lord how are they increase that trouble me many are they that rise up this is the enemy speaking here there is no help for human God say la David says but thou oh Lord are a shield for me my glory and the lifter up of mine head I cried now he begins to testify I Cried unto the Lord with my voice and he heard me out of his Holy Hill say I laid me down and slept I awake for the Lord sustained me and then he says I will not be afraid of 10, thousands of people that have set themselves against me round about and then he proclaims arise oh Lord save me oh my God for thou has smitten all my enemies upon the cheekbone thou has broken the teeth of the ungodly salvation belongeth unto the Lord thy bless in is upon thy people what was David doing he was using the words of God to take his impossible situation and he was using the words of God and it begin to create an atmosphere so that he could believe the word of God and before you can believe sometimes you need to create the right atmosphere to believe why do you think we sing songs in church before the preaching of the word of God because the word's going to come across and so we create an atmosphere where others can believe and say accept it because brother bam said all you have to do is accept it and once you accept it and it comes from here and drops to your heart there's nothing the devil can do then and so David I could imagine as he begin to play instrument that's why he begins to say praise him on the harp PR praise him on the the the drum praise him on the tambourine praise him on the timberl praise him with the snare and David what's he saying these M they're just musical instruments that's all they are but when you put that with those those musical instruments you you lace in the word of God then that becomes an atmosphere it becomes a power it becomes a faith I can imagine David many times uh taking all of his soldiers and Gathering them close and saying listen guys It seems impossible uh look how many are increased against us we're just a few there are many what are we going to do David here's what we're going to do pick up a pick up a a heart pick up a pick up a a string pick up a a drum pick up a snare what we going to do with that David we're going to start creating the right atmosphere and David begin to create the atmosphere and he begin to say many there be increase that trouble me but thou oh Lord are a shield for me you're the glory and the lifter up do you realize that something takes place when you declare with your mouth the word of God and you send that out to the atmosphere my brother whether you see it or not there is a spiritual Warfare taking place and Angelic soldiers and armies that God promised would be there to protect you are put on notice and aware and called to fight your battles you weren't called to fight your battles God was called to fight your battles all you got to do is praise Him worship Him and trust him all you got to do David says but Thou Art Lord but thou oh Lord are a shield for me my glory and the lifter up of my head Psalms 3 is just one example of many that we could use David knew the power of creating the right atmosphere of Faith because if you want to move out of the atmosphere of fear if you if if if you don't want to live in an if you want to live in an atmosphere of Faith you've got to move out of the atmosphere of fear say what is my atmosphere of fear whatever you're facing today that causes you fear anxiety worry move out of that atmosphere stop focusing on that and start focusing on what the word says that's why the Apostle Paul said let it pray without ceasing he says in another place let a song be upon your heart a melody in Your Heart A Hymn upon your lips why because it's created the right atmosphere and my brother and my sister you live in an atmosphere every single day you wake up you go out tomorrow you're going to go right back into this atmosphere but brother says something he says but you he says you can create a world and go live on it and some people are theorize that think oh I'm going to create you know some Planet over here I'm going to go no no no no how about create an atmosphere of love right here how about creating a world of faith and putting your family in that world and say yeah we're here but we're going to create an atmosphere where the where the holy spirit is welcome we're going to create an atmosphere in the midst of the calamity we're going to not speak words of doubt in our house we're going to speak words of Faith but it looks hopeless that doesn't matter but you've already got the report that doesn't matter I'm not going to speak those things I'm going to speak what the word of God says I'm going to create the right atmosphere and then leave the rest up to God you find even this kind of extreme Faith even in we we turn there in Samuel if you want to turn there look at this kind of Faith to face fear 1st Samuel chapter 14 this is is amazing when it speaks of this here in 1st Samuel chapter 14 and verse 1 uh brother uh brother Jeremy if you could put that up now it came to pass upon a day that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bore his armor come and let us go over to the Philistines Garrison that is on the other side but he told not his father Notice come let us go unto the Garrison of the other side now here's Samuel and he's in a situation because if you go and you look this up uh there's the there's a there's a a complete state of paralysis taking place uh with Saul and the Philistines it's complete stalemate remember this morning we talked about response to fear would either be to fight or fight to be able to to run or to fight or with some you go into a state of paralysis where you're not doing anything you're just stuck you're you're you're you're you're you're completely uh Paralyzed by the situation well this is exactly what happens uh with with Saul there's a there's a stalemate nothing's taking place you have the Philistines garrisoned all over here you have Saul and his army Garrison over here and Saul's just over there waiting for a waiting for you know a prophet or word from the Lord not really knowing what to do he's sort of in stalemate doesn't really want to stick his neck out there is not too sure you it be sort of like if you ever seen the old scenes from the Civil War very similar you would have a an army no none of the armies stayed out no matter what you see uh on television none of the armies ever stayed out in the middle of the open in the plane just standing there they would all hide like we do today we cover ourselves with cover in the military they're always going to be behind cover they're always going to be behind something so that they don't take take enemy fire and so here was Saul's Army and they're garrisoned over here in this mountain and then here is here is uh the Philistines Garrison and there in this mountain and then in between this this great big field this great big plane and no one wants to come out first L they take enemy fire and get shot and so suddenly Jonathan has this idea and it came to pass Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bore his armor come and let us go to the Philistines Garrison that is on the other side but he told not his I'm going to I'm going to do a brother digs here I'm going to come down here is that all right he told not his father now I want you to notice this because this is amazing when you look at Faith this is the kind of faith that that that it took to fix the situation now notice what he says here now now now he gets this idea look what he says in verse six skip to verse six brother Jeremy he says and Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armor now notice what he says here he says come and let us go over unto the Garrison of the uncircumcised it may be that the Lord will work for us y'all didn't catch it if do you realize this is what he's literally saying he's saying Hey listen I got an idea all right now this is just an idea here you see we're here the arm's over there here's the field in the plane I've got this idea what is it what is it Jonathan listen has got this master plan we're going to go over to the other side okay a and and maybe the Lord will work for us do you realize what he's saying it may be that's that's our our our Southern word for maybe maybe you never know but maybe just maybe the Lord will work you right ready do you realize this is what Jonathan was saying let us go over to the other side maybe the Lord notice what he says for there is no restraint to the Lord to save by many my Dad's Army or by few just me and you and so it took this kind of Faith before someone in I hope you catch it here tonight before someone in the state of all the paralysis someone could have the faith to give God a chance to operate to give God the opportunity sometimes we never give the Lord a chance to make a move in our life we're out seeking advice from this person and this brother and this church over here and this Pro this thing we're we're get trying to figure everything out Google and everything and never giving the Lord an opportunity to move but Jonathan says it may be you know what that is that's faith that defeats fear here say brother Matt what happened all right let's find out verse seven and his armor Bearer said unto him do all that is in thy heart turn thee behold I am with thee according to thy heart I love that then said Jonathan behold we will pass over unto these men and we will discover ourselves unto them if they say if they if they thus say uh if if they say thus unto us T until we come to you then we will stand still in our place we will not go uh up unto them but if they say thus come up unto us then we will go up for the Lord hath delivered them into our hand and this shall be a sign unto us and both of them discovered themselves into the Garrison of the Philistines and the Philistines said behold the Hebrews come forth out of the holes that were the uh where they had hid themselves and the men of the Garrison answered Jonathan as Amor armor Bearer saying come up to us and we will show you a thing and Jonathan said unto his armor Bearer come up after me for the Lord hath delivered them into the hand of Israel and Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet and his armor bear after him and they fell before Jonathan and his armor Bearer slew after him and that first Slaughter which Jonathan and his armor Bearer made was about 20 men within as it were a half acre of land which a yoke of oxen might plow small victory but it it broke the ice say what did it take it took one person to step out on faith it took one person to take a stand for the word of God and sometimes when you have to stand for the word of God you have to stand alone you have to stand alone and say I'm going to go with you you know what they did a actually a social experiment it was amazing and they they had an experiment where someone it was a it was a h a uh just a I don't even remember who what what school had put it on but they they identified how hard it was to not go with the flow to be odd to step out and so all of these children are in a line I forget what it was these college students and one one of the teenagers stepped outside and started doing this goofy dance of some kind it was just an article that I read started doing some kind of goofy uh uh dance and at first you know everybody looked at him and everybody's you know no one's moving and everyone's watching this guy and he's out there you know all by himself just stuck his neck right out there in front of hundreds we learned this morning what's the greatest fear public speaking when you have to single yourself out in the midst of a crowd let me show you that I'm going to use an example no I'm just kidding I'm not going to do that pass the mic around but this young man he stepped out he started doing this dance and and everyone you know at first was like this is really you know odd you know and they start snickering at the guy snickering at the guy and then you know what happens then a second person steps out of the line and he starts doing it with him that same dance you know what happens after that the floodgates open and the whole entire line starts doing this dance and they did an experiment they said who was it harder for who had more pressure you would say the man who stepped that originally but actually who had more pressure pressure was the second individual to follow the first cuz it takes more to stick to to it takes more pressure it's one thing for one person to do something it's another thing for another to step out and say I'll support you I'll get behind it I'll support it it's one thing for the preacher to have uh uh to be on fire for God it's another thing for you to catch that same fire it's one thing for one young person to get a Revival it's another thing for another person to say I'll stand with you I'll pray with you and you know what you start when you start you start Synergy you start uh you there's a fire a Revival fire spreads from one to the next to the next before you know it the whole church is on fire all because a couple people decided to have faith in God and and deny fear and not run from their fear but face Their Fear and stand for the promises of God's word cuz they because they stood out cuz they stood stood out amazing I had a brother with me and and he and he and he was we was in a vehicle and he's telling me this long testimony of this uh just this this thing that he had read in Genesis and it was something I forget what it was to do with Adam and something he had found in the New Testament it was just a wonderful thought just a brother there we was on our way to a church event and it was so good I mean it was just so good what he began to tell me about I was so blessed by it and so we get to the Gathering we get to the event and then we're all talking in the conversation and there's a bunch of people there a bunch of brothers and the conversation sort of turned reminded me I said oh brother I said tell everyone tell tell these brothers and boy when I said that I mean he immediately just flushed pale you know was like no brother man no no no I'm and I thought he didn't want to do I could tell he was scared I changed the subject really quick and I thought that really terrif now I thought that's odd we were in a vehicle it was just me and Hy had no problem expressing his thought articulating but then I put him in the in the in the room with a bunch of people suddenly paralysis doesn't want to speak doesn't want to say anything why is that why do you think and you know you said brother the matter are you uh uh are you susceptible absolutely you put me on the spot if I'm not preaching and I'm having to speak any one of us can get nervous in a moment but why do you think the devil if anything I'm I hope you catch this here tonight if anything the devil will try to suppress it's your voice if anything the devil will try to suppress in a young person no matter who it is if they're going to take a stand for God he'll try to clam them up to where they're so inward that they're they're they're they're so introverted they can't they can't step out and speak up but oh if just one could step out oh if just one of us could have faith all if one of us could just stand on the word of God if one of us could have sh the faith like Shadrach Meshach and abedo and say even if he doesn't I'm still not going to Bow oh what effect it'll have on the family of God what an effect it could have on your family your children your church for one to have faith and to stand up and speak fear is such a paralyzing thing brother bam said it I read it this morning it's the worst thing he said I've spent that the these nights trying to tell you fear is one of the worst things Satan can place upon a person is fear you say fear uh fear is fear is what fear of anything I don't care what you want to name here tonight and this world that we live in more than any other age men's hearts are failing them for fear friend I I hope it's not be honest and transparent here tonight and tell you and say to you I B fear all of us no matter what it is uh my what my what I'm afraid of is different than what you're afraid of and what may cause me uh uh uh uh worry may not cause you any worry at all but what may cause you worry May uh may not bother me one bit and we're all susceptible to this I think it's amazing in Matthew chapter 10 this is just powerful to me Matthew chapter 10 and verse 28 I want you to read here and then I'm going to read from Luke also but I want you to look at this because I believe that there's something so important out of what Jesus says here very familiar scripture but in Matthew chapter 10 and verse 28 if you could pull that up brother Jeremy on the screen and display that here Jesus is going to begin to talk about this uh this example here of sparrows notice what he says and he says and fear he says and and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather film that which is able to destroy both soul and Body in Hell verse 29 and he says and not Two Sparrows he says are not Two Sparrows sold for a farthing now this is if I've if I've gotten this correct it's about it's worth about two pennies about two pennies say what would that mean not not very much how much value do you put on it well two pennies you know you see you see a penny laying on the ground uh you know how much trouble would you go through maybe if it was right there but how much trouble would you go through to to to to to get two pennies Jesus says now notice this he says are not two far thingss are not Two Sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them one of them just one shall not fall fall on the ground means die without your father not one Jesus says not one not one Sparrow even though when you look at Value is not worth a lot yet they shall not fall on the ground without your father verse 30 and he says but and he he immediately goes to you and says but the very hairs of your head are all numbered the very hairs of your hair of your head are all numbers even even David would boast of this and David would say Heath delivered me from all my fears he have delivered me so what was David saying he says I've I've I've obtained something he's delivered me I've came to this place of victory in my life I don't fear anything anymore if you go back and study how David was delivered from all of his fears it was always because he was magnifying how great God is and David found Victory from Fear by magnifying how awesome the Lord is when David had his eyes on the Creator then nothing seemed impossible when David kept his eyes and on how big God is then it didn't seem like his problem was all that big thought this was so interesting here when when you look at this sparrows and Jesus mentions in verse 29 there are 9,000 and this may stand correction just from research and and and a little article that I had read There are 9,000 species of birds approximately species of birds and out of all 9,000 Jesus could have referred to any he refers to one the sparrow and and if you look in in America just in iron there's 35 different kinds of sparrows but in Jesus's day this term Sparrow it's talking about a small land bird and these birds were caught very differently than they take birds today with a shotgun but back then they would trap them with little ground traps as they would go to to get things to build their nest they would have a trap and it would be caught in a snare but the the these birds uh these these sparrows how you recognize them for their music and and some of them sing as many as 22 different Tunes sparrows and Larks and Vesper sparrows I'm not a uh by no means know that much about birds just from this that I've read so if you got any bird watchers in here someone who knows a lot you could correct me afterwards but Vesper sparrows white-throated sparrows all of them having names to do with music and sparrows like all birds like all of God's creation is intricately designed and made God doesn't do anything by accident and he doesn't design anything without a purpose they the the Bible says you are fearfully and wonderfully made right and so these birds here uh uh they they they're thin small bones thin very thin very very small bones but are strong and they're equipped specifically for flying even today in modern science they can't replicate the the the the intricacy of the wings of a sparrow or the the wing system that allows them to migrate you know thousands of miles they have no no no way to reproduce that and so each each Sparrow has anywhere from 1, 1300 to 2600 feathers and and they're detailed detailed ever seen a bird that's died and you and you go through that you you look at the the just the the beauty of that bird that's why the songwriter wrote How Great Thou Art how how great when I when I survey when I look at God's creation I I say How Great Thou Art intricately and designed uh designed perfectly every bone every feather their wing system and God counted every single bird each one it's what Jesus says your father not one of them even is what you would call valueless yet not one of them has hit the ground without your father knowing not one of them he counted every single one of them most of those birds as we said uh uh were were trapped trapped with Nets and they would they would they would trap them and in Jerusalem Jesus is using this example because this was a common practice he sees sparrows being sold uh and and and and and even just for such a small value these birds that have been trapped with trip Nets and and out of all of these birds that looked like they had no purpose other than just to be trapped and to be sold and to be ate yet Jesus says I want you to know something about you and before I talk about you I want to talk about something you think is so valueless because if I value the sparrow that much how much more do I value you in so much that I've not only know the sparrow I've numbered the hairs on your head imagine that even hair such an amazing subject every hair Jesus says he's numbered every single hair now between 100,000 and 15,000 hairs are on the human head the normal human head now I know some of you don't have as many hairs as others and that number is way shy of 100,000 but originally there was a 100,000 to 150,000 hairs on the human head even those it's amazing because even those who are bald uh or balding or have went bald still have the the the the the system and on their head on their head that produces hair even though it's unseen by the human eye there's tiny follicles tiny small little follicles hair follicles and so God God doesn't just create hair for looks but he makes hair very useful and it's not just for the sake as we said of a of of appearance but our hair on our head is for insulation during the summer and the winter even your eyebrows that you have have a purpose and they're to keep sweat as you begin to prirate the eyebrows are there as a guard to keep sweat from going into your eyes your eyelashes go fur further than that and they protect your eyelids from dusts and and little tiny insects or something that would fly in your eyes God intricately and very detail oriented created you and everything has a purpose and and and even the tiny hairs in your ears which are much less tiny on some than others and nostrils hairs in your ears and hairs in your nostrils uh they there to filter incoming particles or things that that that are uh you know uh bacterias or things and so what God does is he makes um he doesn't just take hair but he makes a marvelous intricate system of protection and and any even even the every hair you take just the individual hair and you were just to take an individual hair and put it on a microscope it's a cylinder of cells uh that that tunnel Deep Way deep into the into the skin beyond the skin down into the to the blood vessels that nourish each and every single hair on your head and every hair has muscle nerves and glands if you even touch lightly the top of your head your hairs will alert the nerves will the the nerves will alert your brain and you know what you feel it what is it God made you that way even in if you look at a drawing of a single human hair you're going to see a section A crosssection with many different rings and these rings of tissue uh that surround the trunk which is surrounded by nerve collar and and it maintains the cuticle and and it and it's just what you say brother Matt what are you trying to say I'm trying to say that we serve an awesome God who did nothing by chance or by happen stand but he created you very specifically in a certain way even the color the melanin that produces the hair's color it's deposited in growing hair and so God puts a color a tinning Factory right on your head and and and and and and and if a hair is left alone it could grow up to 25 feet long in a lifetime 25 ft long now you know why David says I am fearfully and wonderfully made now you know why the Bible says your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost that's why we don't Mar our bodies with tattoos or piercings it's the Temple of the Holy Ghost we don't we don't abuse our body right even you know I know uh the Bible says you know physical people people say well physical exercise well exercise is good for the body and people that Creek say well Paul said it profiteth little well still a little and so it's it's to be taken care of God gave it to you you ought to take care of it I don't know where that came from so that's for free but in the notice here Jesus is speaking here in Matthew 10 and he begins to talk about two things sparrows and hair that The Sparrows not one of them fall to the ground without your father know and the Very hairs you know those intricate things we just learned about every single one has a number that's what Jesus says he's trying to get them to understand something he's trying to get them to understand what it means when he says that he's allowed us he's enabled us to serve him without fear all the days of our life God never created you to live on this Earth to live in constant anxiety and fear never if anything brother bam says fear is something Satan puts on you like a coat like a cloak like a chain it's something he puts on you and so he says now notice right before this this verse fear not this is what he says his very words in verse 28 and fear fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body and hell then he goes to talk about this fear and he says are there not Two Sparrows and not worth much sold but your father knows about every single one of them and the hairs the very hairs on your head notice what Colossians 1 Colossians chapter 1 verse 16 says for by him were all things created Colossians 1:16 for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in the earth all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consists all things are held up all things are gelled together all things by him you imagine if Jesus could have said yeah I'm the one who created the feathers on that Sparrow I'm the one who designed the wing structure I'm the one who designed the hair on your head and it wasn't Jesus was who was Jesus his occupation was a carpenter as a man but he was more than a man he was God and as the Creator he was saying no man could do this no scientist could do this but the creator of Heaven heavens and earth designed you created you built you so why fear anything in your life this is exactly what he's saying Peter what if Jesus you know Jesus Jesus could have looked over to Peter and said Peter I know you're fearful but let me let me just tell you something Peter what if I told you that you have 127,000 364 hairs on your head you have 16 three in your right eyebrow you have 160 in your left eyebrow you have you have 25 eyelashes in the left eye you have 23 in this eye you have you have 319 over here your beard Peter it's made up of many on your head you have this many on your eyebrow you have this many now since you know Peter that I've numbered every hair on your head won't you trust me then with every single little detail of your life W you believe that I don't know just the big choices I'm not just there for the big times I'm there for the little moments in your life in fact the Bible says the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord you know what that means the footsteps every step you take righteous steps are ordered of the Lord that means he called them he ordained them he provisioned them he purposed them every single step you know what that includes my last one that's why David could say that God knows you show me how how how he says teach me to number my days in other words God you've numbered every single day I have here on this Earth You know every day someone passes away and you say I don't understand but God does if God ordered all their steps in life don't you trust in that he ordered their last one he says Peter I've I've ordered every every aspect every detail every intricate detail every step James do you understand man uh you know uh did you know there's 2,396 65 sparrows on the Earth right now as of yesterday that's the count in the last 24 hours uh 24 uh 2, 440,000 of them uh H H have died by natural death and 9 million and however many are trapped in a trap right now you know Jesus could say that he knew exactly how many he knew the exact number the exact detail why why was he so why not just a generic number because he was trying to teach them something I've I've enabled you to serve me without any fear or worry and I say Lord let me serve you that way let me live all of this days how many could say that let me live all the days of my life without fear because Jesus says not one of them falls to the ground without your father in Heaven's knowledge not one of them falls to the ground so be careful for nothing that's what the scripture says don't be anxious for anything the Bible says don't be anxious for anything but with prayer and supplication make your request known unto God not with fear not with worry not with anxiety with prayer and supplication make your request known to God will you now believe me that I promise to clothe you I promise to feed you I promise to put a roof over your head I promise to take care of every single detail will you trust me will you trust me in every every decision and every time and every purpose in your life not just the good times it's so easy so easy so easy man the times are good things are happening things make sense so sweet to trust in Jesus just to take him at his word but let the times get rough start having questions pop up and why this and why that and suddenly it's so much harder times of your life I think of and I'm going to close here I think of josaphat King Jehosaphat in his life it was so amazing because you take take this this man who was the Bible Mo for the most part talks about Jehoshaphat as a as a Godly King and he's son of a son of Asa and the Bible begins to to tell about this situation that arises in his life and the scripture says here that Jehoshaphat that there's this great and new this great Army that teams up against him and and they're there to to to to a a great Alliance I think it was five uh kingdoms let me just pull it up here on my screen in the scripture here think it was five kingdoms that made an alliance against him and it was amazing because let let me let me find here in in in chapter 20 you don't have to turn 2 Chronicles chapter 20 you you can turn you can put it on the screen if you have your Bible you can turn but he Jehoshaphat is a a Godly Man Who d destroys a lot of the asteroth poles and and he does a lot of cleaning up in Israel but he makes a big mistake a huge mistake and he made this mistake over and over in his life a few times in his life because he was a sympathetic man he was so sympathetic to the northern kingdom and the Kings though they were evil wicked men he was always trying to to send out an olive branch always trying to reach out you study the life of Jehoshaphat always trying to reach out and and to be open and to be diplomatic but it got him in trouble and he he makes uh Ahab you know the story really well from Sunday school I'm sure Ahab wants to uh attack and he and he to attack I think it was Syria and he and he invites Jehoshaphat and to come in and make an alliance and we're going to team up and we're gonna we're going to take out the syrians and and and so you know he Jehoshaphat says well you know should we cons a prophet and so he brings in these 400 prophets and you know they're all prophesying and and Jehoshaphat says is there is there not a real a true prophet in the land and he says oh yeah there's you know there's this one but he always prophesies against me and you know the story of MAA oh you go to the end of that story and even after the prophet's warning even after jeos or or Mah prophesize and he gives just what he basically tells Ahab what he wants to hear and then Ahab says you know how you you know you got to tell me the truth uh speak the truth and he says I've seen Israel scattered like sheep and even though he had given him the warning not to go yet somehow through his maybe I don't know through his maybe I'm adding here but his kindness uh uh his benevolence just wanting to be uh to have to have an open door here with this King he teams up with him and God rebukes him and so he makes this Alliance now you say brother mat why is this story important because josaphat's life had been a life that had been trusting God for everything trusting the Lord for every decision in his life but he makes this mistake and we know even further than that he he he marries has his son Mary the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel but now one morning Jehoshaphat the Bible says is is woken up and he says in verse one and and he gets this bad terrible news and in 2 Chronicles 20 and verse one the news comes to him as no doubt as his his uh the Bible says maybe his military soldiers or whoever it was his captains and Generals wakes him up and says Jehoshaphat he says it came to pass after this also the children of his Moab and the children of Amon and with them other besides the ammonites came against Jehoshaphat to battle and so he says in verse two Then There came some that told Jehoshaphat saying there cometh a great multitude against thee from Beyond the Sea on the side of Syria on on this side Syria and behold how they be in ha Tomar which is in Getty and so notice he gets this bad news this great Alliance as it were is is coming to wipe him out now it's it's he's reaping what he's reaping the results of a really bad decision and sometimes our actions are reaping the results of a really bad decision but now he's he's he gets this news and there's these team of Alliance and Jehoshaphat they're 15 miles away they're just 15 miles they're just they're right on our our doorstep just 15 miles south of Jerusalem what are you going to do what do we do they're on the western shore of the Dead Sea what are we going to do Jehoshaphat imagine these leaders in and these generals who had trusted him it it seemed hopeless we're going to be wiped out it's not a chance I mean it what what chance do we have it's it's Extinction imagine being woken up with this kind of news they're coming to destroy us coming an our army innumerable you know what Jehoshaphat had right then he had a reason to panic and he had a reason to start pushing Panic buttons you know what those are don't you had a reason to start pushing Panic buttons and start trying to figure it out find out what what what what what are you going to do what what's going to happen the verse three notice what it says and Jehoshaphat feared and set himself means he determined he set himself to seek the Lord and proclaimed to fast throughout all Judah you know what you know what you say brother Matt what do we do in times of Calamity in times of Crisis now let me just let me just give me just can I just have about five more minutes here this is what the Lord put upon my heart and Times of Calamity times of Crisis you say brother Matt what should the believer do what what what what would your answer be pray right be the natural answer for the Christian and of course that's what all Christians do right the natural answer you say what does the word say uh we have a great need it's a great Calamity of a great problem oh it's so it says David said that's increased against me it's seems impossible what should it do it should drive us to our knees it should drive us to do exactly what Jehoshaphat did to seek the Lord and Proclaim to fast throughout all Judah you say brother Matt what is that that's the obvious answer you should pray but it's not the automatic response in fact if we'd be honest sadly most of the time it's not our response our first response we Panic it's amazing because I could say it would have been very human it would have been very understandable for Jehoshaphat to hear this news this enemies on your border they're coming to wipe us out and it would have been natural to hear Jehoshaphat say uh uh call all the generals call all my generals get them in in the war room in here let's get in the situation room and we're going to figure this out and what's our intelligence tell us give me the latest where they at right now how many tanks do we have how many jets do we have how many bombs do we have what's you know what's our what's our rations at right now let's try to figure this out guys that would have been very normal get immobilized immediately let's let's set up uh uh stations we don't have one second 15 miles we don't have one second to waste and as soon as as soon as Johan fat would sent him out you know and let's get out there let's get on the front lines and oh oh oh and by the way if you guys find time to pray we probably should pray too if you guys if we find time when you get all set up and you do all that may you know that's how we react so many times we set up our army we make all of our plans we get everything ready we get our defenses and then we go now Lord will you help me what if that was the first thing we did what if this was the first thing we did Jehoshaphat rather than doing the natural thing Jehoshaphat calls the whole nation calls everybody and he proclaims a fast throughout the whole church the whole nation the problem is great Panic would have been normal but it says in verse now now what's even more amazing go back to verse one brother Jeremy this is what's more amazing about this in verse one it says it came to pass after this also after what now here's here's the here's the latter an army of multiple kings are coming to wipe you and sin and no actually it's quite the opposite you go and read chapter 191 1817 this is after Jehoshaphat cleans house kicks the trash out and and begins to make great reformations to Israel this is what happens right after you say I don't deserve this you know how many times that's our answer in our heart whether we say it with our mouth what did I do to deserve this this Lord what did I ever do to deserve this what did Paul and Silas do to deserve to be in a prison chained up to chains in the inner dungeon as Roman citizens you know what they could have said if anybody could have said we don't deserve this it's Paul and Silas but you know what Paul and Silas didn't do they never said that they begin to sing and praise God after this it came to pass after this after Jas fat tried to do something for God tried to bring the nation it would have been very natural for him to get bitter for him to get angry and say Lord this is how you repay me after I've set my heart to seek you after I've after I've tried to to do something for you and now we're on the brink of being wiped out but you know what josaphat he didn't do that he didn't do what was automatic in a crisis he prayed I know it's very simple but I hope it's dealing with your heart here tonight he prayed it had been natural to trust his resources but he didn't he trusted God it had been natural to look to armies but he didn't he looked to the word he did what was what what was not automatic what was obvious but not automatic he gets down to his knees you go read chapter 17 through through 19 it tells about the might the power of all of his for forces that he had was equipped for war that he had accumulated it had been easy get get ready get prepared get let's go after them but rather than trust in his army rather than trust in his army now I tell you another thing he didn't do it would have been very he would have been very susceptible as a leader as a king pride gets in the way dignity gets in the way and what you say privately you maybe don't say publicly because you got the image right it would have been very rather than trust in his army Jehoshaphat publicly makes an admission and what's he admitting a lack of strength a lack not strength but a lack of strength not ability but a lack of ability and he calls on God to help him in this time of Crisis Jehoshaphat here he was the king of all of Judah and and and and and this was this was a prideful thing to be a king and to to to be put in this position it was he had some dignity there was an image to go with it and it was to there's a reason for that it's important leaders Inspire confidence by their confidence you inspire other people by your so by your uh Resolute attitude you inspire others it had been natural for Jehoshaphat to be proud and say well I can't surely I can't say that to my whole church I I I can't I can't show that type of transparency I can't show that type of weakness you know sometimes people appreciate that more than strength I appreciate God's Prophet when he would make humble admissions of his own faults and his own mistakes and his own failures how far away I would feel if we had a prophet who came and just told us how all the time he was just never made a mistake never but no he goes on further to tell us he told a lie he got in a car with a gun to go kill another man his temper got the best of him I know people don't like to talk about that but it's important because it gives you Faith to believe if God used him God could use me if God could if God could look past God could look past here what kind of leader what kind of strong leader gets up and admits before his whole church we're helpless we're helpless I'll just be honest today friends uh we we don't have no answers could you imagine we have no answers I'm afraid I'm afraid friends to tell you that uh we're helpless against this enemy our army doesn't stand a chance we're going to get wiped out we don't have a prayer there's not even a chance not even a remote chance that we're going to survive what is it Jehosaphat get get up and he admits to the whole church of his fear and he calls a National Prayer meeting are you with me here tonight in front of everyone look at verse 12 I want you to notice this because it's so important uh he he begins to say this brother Jeremy in verse 12 he says Oh Our God this is his prayer in front of the whole church he says will thou not judge them for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us neither let me go further than no might neither know we what to do but our eyes are upon thee he says that we don't know what to do it's a public admission to say oh you you know it could have been easy for him to go in the back room and to pray this you know privately and to say this to the Lord Lord I really I can't tell that to the people but honestly Lord I don't know what to do but no but he gets up before everybody and says Lord we don't know what to do in other words apapat was put in himself with the rest of everybody and says we're all in this together and Lord we're in your hands we're in your hands Lord the problem is in your hands Lord he wasn't he wasn't concerned about politics he wasn't concerned about Public Image he wasn't concerned about what people would think he wasn't concerned about what what people would say here's what he knew we're in deep trouble and if God doesn't answer we'll be wiped out so what does he do he openly admits his weakness and begins to call upon the Lord notice what it says here back up if you could to verse three I want you to notice this just as we close here and Jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the Lord and proclaimed to fast throughout all of Judah verse four uh keep going there and Judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the Lord even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord notice he says it says he set his face you ever read that you read that about Daniel and it says he set his face you read that I think it's about uh Isaiah or Jeremiah he set his heart what does that mean when it says they they begin to seek their heart it says they seek help from the Lord he sought the god of his father he's seeking the Lord I clicked on that word seek it's amazing it means here when it says it seek when it says seek not just to pray but I'm going to read it to you it literally means when it says he said his heart to seek the Lord it literally means to trample underfoot to beat with your feet to beat a path to God because you frequent that way so often you ever seen a beaten path a path that you can identify because it's traveled a lot this is what it meant he had sought he had set his face this was a way josaphat knew really well he had a beaten Worn Path of all the times in the past he had went to God for problems and for needs and for issues my brother my sister in crisis should not be the first time you speak to the Lord Jesus but you ought to have a beaten path one that's welln to where when you begin to pray and say father it's a words you've spoken many times before to the Lord Jesus oh God help us to to be people who only cry out to God and and begin to speak to the Lord and begin to get in touch with God when we have Calamity and crisis but say Lord let it be a beaten path that I've worn because I frequent that way so often verse five musicians could you come we're going to have to close out of time je Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the Lord before the new court verse 6 and said oh Lord God of our fathers art thou are not thou God in heaven and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the Heathen and in thine hand is there not power and might notice not my hand hand not my power not by power not by might but by my spirit sayith the Lord not by what I can do not by not by what I had Lord but he says is there not power in thine hand and might so that none is able to withstand thee verse seven are not thou Our God who did drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy People Israel and givest it to thy seed of Abraham thy friend forever verse nine of Jeremy if when evil cometh upon us as the sword if when evil cometh upon us I love this prayer as the sword judgment or pestilence or famine here's my resolution we stand before this house and in thy presence for thy name is in this house and cry unto thee in our Affliction then thou will hear and help stand to your feet stand I wonder if you could pray that now every head bowed every eye closed put that back up if you could brother Jeremy verse 9 if when evil every head bowed every eye closed I want you to take that problem in your family in your home wherever it's at if I don't name it here tonight the Lord Jesus knows I want you to pray this prayer and say Lord we have no might against this enemy we don't neither know we what to do can we be honest neither know we what to do and here's what I'm going to say but mine eyes are upon thee Oh Lord and here's what I'm going to pray if when evil cometh upon us as the sword judgment or pestilence or famine or whatever it is we stand before this house and in thy presence for thy name is in this house and cry unto thee in our Affliction then thou will hear and help can you ask the Lord Jesus and say Lord I'm asking something very simple tonight hear and help hear and help Lord verse 10 and now behold the children of Amon and Moab and mount seir whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt but they turned from them and destroyed them not verse 11 behold I say how they reward us to come to cast us out of thy possession which thou Hast given us to inherit verse 12 again oh Our God will thou not judge them for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us neither know we what to do but our eyes are upon thee verse 15 I want you to notice this promise that comes through a prophet and he said hearken this is a prophet speaking after that prayer here's what the Lord says hearken you all Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem and Thou King Jehoshaphat thus saith the Lord unto to You Be not Afraid there it is don't fear you have nothing really when it comes down to it my brother and my sister you have nothing to fear you have nothing to fear be fear not thus sayith the Lord be Not Afraid nor by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not even yours but gods's the battle is not even yours it's God's oh take verse 16 brother Jeremy the battle is not yours it's the Lords and tomorrow go you down against them behold they come up off the cliff of ziz and you shall find them at the end of The Brick before the Wilderness of jru verse 17 and he says you shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand ye still and see the salvation of the Lord oh could the Lord speak to your heart tonight my brother could speak to your heart my sister a young person there in your seat old alike can he speak to your heart and say to you you shall not need to fight the battle is not yours it's the Lord just set yourself stand you still and see the salvation of the Lord don't go to and fro just stand still and see the salvation of God in your life fear not be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the Lord will be with You Verse 18 and Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground and all Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the Lord and here's what they did worshiping the Lord raise your hands now say Lord I worship you I worship you Lord Jesus I'm going to bow my head it's already bowed it's to the ground here's what I'm going to do I I don't feel maybe I don't feel it maybe I don't feel it here tonight maybe I I don't maybe it's impossible I don't even I don't even know if this is going to work but here's what I'm going to do I'm going to put my trust in you I'm going to put my hope in you I'm going to put all my hope in Jesus tonight I'm going to bow my head to the ground I'm going to Worship the Lord oh verse 19 go to the next verse brother Jeremy and he says and the Levites and the children of the coites and the children of the kites stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high and verse 20 says and they Rose early in the morning and went forth Into the Wilderness of tcoa and as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood and said hear me oh Judah he wanted them to hear something and he got a message for him he said hear me oh Judah and you inhabitant of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your God so you shall be established believe His prophets so shall you prosper oh and it's my
