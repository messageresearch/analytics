[27:04] when he reached down his head forward
[27:13] amen it's hard for me sometimes to stop
[27:16] singing I often think
[27:19] you might say
[27:21] dream or
[27:22] maybe it's more imagination
[27:25] what it will be like in heaven
[27:28] where we'll have just
[27:29] I think of it maybe like a stadium maybe
[27:32] this just goes back to when I was in
[27:34] Africa and all those Believers were just
[27:35] there singing
[27:37] tens of thousands of them just singing
[27:39] to the Lord and
[27:40] the first service we were there was
[27:42] eight hours long and just such a Zeal
[27:45] and a joy for the Lord and sometimes I
[27:47] think that's
[27:49] it's like how Heaven's going to be and
[27:51] this is just a little glimpse of what
[27:52] heaven's going to be and then
[27:54] I don't know if I've I don't know if
[27:56] I've said this here I know I've been
[27:58] told different people this but then
[27:59] several couple years later after that
[28:01] trip to Africa
[28:03] I was at a
[28:05] football game
[28:06] college football game and it was the
[28:09] number one team in the nation at the
[28:11] time and
[28:12] I said to somebody I said to several I
[28:15] said if I am ever in a stadium
[28:18] of 92 000 bail worshipers I'll know what
[28:21] the spirit is like
[28:22] even though there were maybe good
[28:24] players and with good intentions on the
[28:26] team
[28:27] there was a there was a worship there
[28:29] that was and it was such a parallel what
[28:32] God what God does in the spiritual and
[28:34] what Satan was doing in the earth and
[28:36] the natural and sometimes we can just
[28:39] kind of
[28:40] go through life and not realize where
[28:42] brother Branham says we have a moment
[28:45] where right now miss what God's doing
[28:47] right now and we have this is just a
[28:49] glimpse of what we're going to have over
[28:51] there amen sorry sister hope I'll let
[28:54] you say

[42:47] trust that you were amen this morning
[42:49] that the Lord was able to move upon your
[42:51] heart and say something to you maybe

[43:55] your presence Lord your Prophet taught
[43:57] us the reason churches don't reverence
[44:00] your presence is because they don't
[44:02] recognize it Lord and so tonight we just
[44:05] want to recognize you father that you're
[44:07] here that your holy spirit is in Supreme
[44:10] control not men Lord not an organization
[44:14] Lord not a personality Lord but we just
[44:18] become subservient to you right now holy
[44:21] spirit we just step aside and submit
[44:23] ourselves and surrender ourselves Lord
[44:25] each one of us God I'm just clay Lord
[44:29] imperfect like every person I'm speaking
[44:31] to here to night Lord you called this
[44:33] the foolishness of preaching how that
[44:35] you would take an imperfect man and
[44:37] speak to imperfect people and preach and
[44:40] Perfection would come out of that Lord
[44:42] only you could do that that's
[44:44] Supernatural Lord for We Believe Lord
[44:46] that we're not feeding upon an
[44:48] intellectual word we're not feeding and
[44:50] just thrown in the emotion Lord but this
[44:53] is this is real Zoe life that we have
[44:56] and so God that's what our hearts are
[44:58] hungry for May you meet every need Lord
[45:00] every hand that's been raised whether it
[45:02] was sickness Lord or whatever it would
[45:05] be God I pray that you would come and be
[45:07] Jehovah to all of your children we ask
[45:10] we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the
[45:13] church said
[45:14] amen Zechariah Chapter 12 we'll just
[45:17] begin reading and just recap or not
[45:20] recap but read what we uh read this
[45:22] morning verse 2 of Zechariah 12 behold I
[45:27] will make Jerusalem
[45:29] a cup of trembling unto all the people
[45:32] round about when they shall be in The
[45:34] Siege both against Judah and against
[45:37] Jerusalem now remember what we pointed
[45:39] out to you this morning this is
[45:41] something the Lord says he's going to do
[45:43] and he says here and in that Day verse 3
[45:46] will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone
[45:49] for all people and all that burden
[45:52] themselves with it shall be cut in
[45:55] pieces though all the people of the
[45:57] earth be gathered together against it
[45:59] let's begin reading here at verse 8 and
[46:01] that day shall the Lord now this is God
[46:04] he didn't send a general he didn't send
[46:07] a nuclear bomb he didn't send a tank but
[46:10] he said I'm going to come down myself
[46:12] this is who's going to defend Israel
[46:14] ultimately is the Lord himself
[46:18] couldn't imagine a greater General than
[46:20] him
[46:21] and he says here in verse 8 and that day
[46:22] shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of
[46:26] Jerusalem now notice how he specifies
[46:28] this and he that is feeble among them at
[46:32] that day shall be as David
[46:36] he that is feeble shall be is David and
[46:39] the House of David shall be as God as
[46:42] the angel of the Lord before them
[46:46] now remember what we pointed out I won't
[46:48] have you I won't preach to you while
[46:50] you're standing I'll let you sit here
[46:51] and sit here in a minute but remember
[46:53] what we pointed out that the prophet
[46:54] said everything what happens with
[46:56] natural Zion happens to spiritual Zion
[47:00] so natural is natural Israel and
[47:03] spiritual Israel the church doesn't
[47:05] replace Israel we don't believe in
[47:08] replacement uh theology but there's a
[47:10] part that Israel plays in the natural
[47:13] that the church the elected mystical
[47:16] body plays in the spiritual
[47:18] and so notice what he begins saying here
[47:20] when he says the Lord shall defend
[47:22] Israel now notice he says here and let's
[47:24] read it in verse 8 again and then as in
[47:26] that day shall the Lord defend the
[47:27] inhabitants of Jerusalem now not all
[47:30] Israel it doesn't say I'm going to
[47:32] defend the entire nation but he says all
[47:35] those in Jerusalem and then he specifies
[47:38] and he that is feeble among them at that
[47:40] day shall be as David let's begin
[47:43] reading here at verse 9 and it shall
[47:45] come to pass in that day that I will
[47:47] seek to destroy all the nations that
[47:49] come against Jerusalem and I will pour
[47:51] upon the house
[47:53] of all of Israel no
[47:56] I will pour upon the House of David and
[48:00] upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem So
[48:03] within all of Israel there's a special
[48:06] elected set-aside group
[48:10] that God said I'm going to pour my
[48:12] spirit upon this house he says I'll pour
[48:15] upon the house and upon the inhabitants
[48:18] of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and of
[48:22] supplications and they shall look upon
[48:25] me whom they have pierced and they shall
[48:26] mourn for him as when morneth for his
[48:29] only son and shall be in bitterness for
[48:31] him as one that is in bitterness for his
[48:34] firstborn let's just read one verse from
[48:36] chapter 14 two chapters over
[48:38] verse 2 for I will gather all nations
[48:40] against Jerusalem to battle and the city
[48:43] shall be taken and the house is rifled
[48:46] and the women ravished and half of the
[48:47] city shall go forth into captivity and
[48:50] the residue of the people shall not he
[48:52] says in the residents of the people
[48:53] shall not be cut off from the city then
[48:57] shall the Lord go forth and fight
[49:00] against those Nations as when he fought
[49:03] in the day
[49:04] of battle
[49:06] when the day of the Lord comes you
[49:09] better be on the Lord's Side
[49:13] let's just pray if you just want to just
[49:15] pray over the blessing for the reading
[49:17] of the word God we give you thanks here
[49:19] tonight once again Lord knowing that
[49:21] we've already
[49:22] received a blessing just by reading your
[49:24] word now God I pray that you would come
[49:26] and take your word Lord and break it to
[49:28] your people we ask it in Jesus Christ's
[49:31] name amen you can be seated
[49:42] we're just going to pick up right from
[49:43] where we were where we left off this
[49:45] morning it's amazing when you think of
[49:48] the spirit of Grace that he pours out
[49:50] and he says I'll pour out the spirit of
[49:52] Grace and of Supplication so what is
[49:56] that Spirit of Grace Grace means
[50:00] unmerited favor in other words I didn't
[50:03] do anything to deserve this but somehow
[50:05] I received it I didn't do anything I'm
[50:08] Unworthy of it but the Lord's given it
[50:11] to me so he says I'll pour out I'm going
[50:13] to give them what they would need more
[50:16] than anything at this moment they need
[50:19] Grace more than anything that the Jewish
[50:22] Nation needs today is Grace more than
[50:25] anything that the bride of Christ needs
[50:28] more than anything today is Grace when
[50:31] you look at the things that the prophet
[50:33] of God begin to speak about we're just
[50:35] going to read a few of them here in the
[50:36] countdown if you would put that up
[50:38] brother Peter that would be wonderful
[50:39] I'm just going to begin reading here at
[50:42] paragraph 79 not 77 79 the prophet says
[50:47] what does it represent
[50:49] a spiritual age a spiritual time to
[50:52] where God's going to have a spiritual
[50:55] astronaut amen they're here right now
[50:58] Hallelujah the Eagles of the air that
[51:01] can go beyond the other bird and sell
[51:03] above everything spiritual astronauts
[51:05] that can take the word of God and prove
[51:08] that he's the same yesterday today and
[51:11] forever
[51:12] our spiritual astronaut oh my that makes
[51:15] me feel good glory living in this age
[51:17] now what a wonderful thing for Spiritual
[51:21] astronauts so you notice in this message
[51:23] countdown brother Brandon's trying to
[51:25] bring something across that you'll see
[51:27] also in the following messages after
[51:29] this to say that it was a wonderful
[51:32] thing when God poured out his Spirit
[51:34] upon Luther and and an entire age of
[51:37] people was justified under his message
[51:39] and those that believed his message it
[51:41] was a it was the age of the horse and
[51:44] buggy it was a wonderful uh achievement
[51:46] and he says in everything that the man
[51:49] that man has been allowed to achieve in
[51:51] the natural God was proven in the
[51:53] natural that something was taking place
[51:56] in the Supernatural it uses man's
[51:59] achievements and he begins to talk about
[52:00] the automobile and and he would type
[52:02] that automobile with Wesley in his
[52:05] message of sanctification and how that
[52:06] those who were Sanctified under Wesley
[52:09] that in the group of all of those people
[52:11] who just were took a profession and then
[52:13] lived any old way yet that within that
[52:16] group there was people who were really
[52:18] Sanctified and then he talks about Azusa
[52:21] and Pentecost in the 1906 Azusa Street
[52:23] Revival that that was a moment a
[52:26] momentous moment in history it was a
[52:28] marker it was a junction it was an
[52:31] important moment that God had placed in
[52:34] his drama Before Time began that there
[52:36] would be this moment and this marker and
[52:39] this group long before God had
[52:41] established and determined where it
[52:43] would take place what would happen when
[52:45] it took place the fruits of what would
[52:47] happen The Men Who were involved daddy
[52:49] Seymour and Welch and you go study some
[52:51] of the Seymour and Welch Revival and
[52:53] read the original Revival that poured
[52:56] out when the gifts of the Spirit will
[52:58] return to the church let me tell you
[52:59] something friends it wasn't the work of
[53:02] man it was the work of Jehovah because
[53:05] he made a promise in the Book of Joel
[53:08] I'll restore all the Palmer worm and all
[53:12] that the caterpillar and all that the
[53:13] canker worm has taken out of my church
[53:16] so what was one of the things that he
[53:18] removed the gifts of the Spirit the
[53:20] gifts of speaking in tongues the gift of
[53:22] faith the gift of wisdom the gift of
[53:24] healing the gift of Miracles those are
[53:27] all Miracle or gifts that are mentioned
[53:29] in the book of Corinthians that were to
[53:31] the inheritance of the church that had
[53:33] been lost but now God was going to begin
[53:36] to restore them but notice it was a
[53:39] power that was greater than the horse
[53:41] and buggy the horse and buggy was
[53:43] powerful at that day you would think man
[53:45] this is really cutting edge technology a
[53:49] horse and a buggy
[53:51] but to them it was the best way to get
[53:55] from one side of the town to the next
[53:57] side of the town but that's all they had
[53:59] but it's how God restored and brother
[54:01] Branham says notice that achievement
[54:03] something as small as that it was
[54:05] representative that God had moved up he
[54:08] had moved further he had restored more
[54:11] then he goes from there and he begins to
[54:13] talk about the air the automobile and
[54:15] how that when they Henry Ford built that
[54:18] model T in that first Ford combustion
[54:21] engine that God had put it onto the
[54:23] heart of Henry Ford and the heart of man
[54:25] to accomplish something in the natural
[54:28] that would only be a representation of
[54:32] something significant in the
[54:35] Supernatural
[54:36] and he says notice what did it the notch
[54:39] what did the natural scientists do uh
[54:41] let me turn this on so it'll work here
[54:43] he says what did the natural scientists
[54:45] do has been able to achieve that and God
[54:47] through man notice with God through man
[54:50] would stay with the Bible and say that
[54:52] he's the same yesterday today and
[54:54] forever and not afraid of the promise
[54:56] regardless of what anybody said stay
[54:59] with it what is it you become an
[55:03] astronaut that can go so far it's beyond
[55:07] notice keyword it's beyond
[55:11] any he says it's beyond denominational
[55:14] thinking
[55:17] it wasn't to do away with what the
[55:19] denominational thinking was it wasn't to
[55:22] do away with anything God had given but
[55:25] he says it's beyond anything else
[55:30] it's beyond the things of the church out
[55:34] yonder with God and him alone you stay
[55:38] astronauts in order notice he says and
[55:40] remember in order to get to be an
[55:43] astronaut they had to get in a tank and
[55:45] they can't control themselves it takes
[55:47] radar power anatomic power to lift him
[55:51] out beyond space and then he's
[55:53] controlled by a tower listen how brother
[55:55] random starts to type this Glory God's
[55:58] spiritual astronaut is the same they
[56:00] come into a tank and into a place to a
[56:03] body and that body is the body of Christ
[56:05] then it's not them it wasn't John Glenn
[56:09] it was the tank that he was in
[56:13] it was the machine he just sat there he
[56:16] didn't do any nothing he just had the
[56:18] real pure courage to get up there and
[56:21] say it's right because science had
[56:25] proved it
[56:26] God wants man who can come into Christ
[56:29] and believe that he's the same yesterday
[56:32] today and forever remember what brother
[56:35] random says about his own message he
[56:37] said it wasn't me who appeared on the
[56:39] river it wasn't me who appeared there I
[56:42] was only standing there when he appeared
[56:44] the prophet would later after the seal
[56:46] say I don't declare to you I'm not here
[56:49] to declare to you to say that the Lord
[56:51] the Lord is coming I'm here to declare
[56:53] he's here
[56:55] his presence he's here by the person of
[56:58] his word he's the angel of the Covenant
[57:01] he's backing up these things that you
[57:03] see Vindicated are to lift up Christ
[57:07] they're to raise your faith and put your
[57:10] faith and anchor it in something listen
[57:12] and he says notice here he says God
[57:15] wants man who can come into Christ and
[57:18] believe he's the same yesterday today
[57:19] and forever and don't take their own
[57:22] thinking move out into space controlled
[57:25] by the Holy Ghost that's my prayer Lord
[57:29] he says how far it is back from the old
[57:32] horse and buggy how far it is even from
[57:34] the airplane how far it is from
[57:37] justification sanctification baptism of
[57:40] the Holy Ghost they're coming to Eagles
[57:45] the first they were lizards then they
[57:48] become chickens then they become crows
[57:50] but now
[57:51] they're Eagles
[57:54] I love that first a lizard and the horse
[57:56] and buggy right only the prophet could
[57:59] say it that way then they become
[58:00] chickens in the cars then they become
[58:02] crows in the sky but now we're
[58:04] astronauts
[58:06] and he says no one can follow them and
[58:10] he goes a special bird it can go higher
[58:12] than any other bird he's prepared to see
[58:15] keep his head level when he gets up
[58:17] there there's some people can jump way
[58:19] up don't know where they're at after
[58:21] they get there because he can't see no
[58:23] further than what he's jumped but
[58:24] there's some that can look back and see
[58:27] what's going on that's the eagle he can
[58:31] stand there till he looks it over and
[58:33] waits till he hears a message that tells
[58:35] him what to say that's the astronaut of
[58:37] God see it's followed all the other
[58:40] achievements so no notice what he says
[58:42] in the next paragraph astronauts for
[58:45] Jesus how many astronauts we got here
[58:48] tonight don't even leave by his own
[58:50] power he's fired out one thing he does
[58:53] is get into it
[58:56] do you realize what the prophet is
[58:59] teaching us here you don't have to
[59:01] manufacture the power of the Holy Ghost
[59:04] that brings about the body change you
[59:06] just have to get into the word and the
[59:09] Dynamics of the Holy Ghost will do the
[59:11] rest
[59:12] you don't have to manufacture a move of
[59:14] God you don't have to manufacture
[59:16] Revival there's a lot of a lot of
[59:18] churches Pentecostal churches whoop it
[59:20] up Whip It Up holler it up but you know
[59:22] a real move of God is Not based upon
[59:25] what you what you emotionally feel based
[59:28] upon some whoop up or pep rally but it's
[59:31] when you see the word of God as John
[59:34] seen the word of God and John said all
[59:36] that was in heaven all that was in the
[59:38] earth heard I John say worthy Worthy is
[59:41] the Lamb what was it he's seen himself
[59:43] in the book
[59:46] and he says here he says notice you just
[59:48] have to get in it that's all you have to
[59:50] do is get into God God he says get into
[59:52] it God will do the shooting and the
[59:54] placing it ain't gasoline power no more
[59:57] neither some church Creed it's God's
[1:00:00] Adam power that push it pushes you Plum
[1:00:02] out of space out yonder amen
[1:00:07] why what is it these astronauts they've
[1:00:09] got they they just took the word
[1:00:11] justification just the word
[1:00:12] sanctification he's got into the whole
[1:00:15] Bible amen he's got into all of it
[1:00:17] because that he knows that God is able
[1:00:19] to perform every promise he ever made
[1:00:24] he just sits there and waits
[1:00:28] he doesn't have to do nothing as we said
[1:00:30] their vision is turned when they sit in
[1:00:33] that ass in that spaceship before they
[1:00:35] take off their entire vision changes
[1:00:37] from the Earthly and they're looking at
[1:00:39] the heavenly
[1:00:40] their eyes are focused on one thing
[1:00:42] they're not trying to manufacture no you
[1:00:44] don't see no astronaut getting out of
[1:00:45] there pouring the jet the rocket fuel in
[1:00:47] there hoping the Rocket's going to take
[1:00:49] off what is it he's already put his
[1:00:51] confidence in the thing but that's why
[1:00:52] brother Branham says all it takes is for
[1:00:55] a man to have enough confidence to get
[1:00:56] in it
[1:00:59] and he says they've got he says he just
[1:01:02] sits there and wait oh my the word is
[1:01:04] bound to manifest itself if you're sick
[1:01:06] and an astronaut just remember get in
[1:01:09] Christ
[1:01:10] wait the countdown that's all he'll fire
[1:01:13] the bullet don't worry he's been able to
[1:01:16] achieve it because God's
[1:01:18] promised it
[1:01:20] I'd encourage you to go read that
[1:01:22] message the countdown
[1:01:24] it's just wonderful notice here so he
[1:01:26] says what's he going to pour out this is
[1:01:28] the spirit of Grace
[1:01:30] and supplication so it's a it's a it's a
[1:01:34] spirit of Grace which means unmerited
[1:01:36] favor something God is going to pour out
[1:01:39] I looked at this word supplication it
[1:01:41] was incredible to me because when you
[1:01:42] when you when you look at this word
[1:01:45] simply at a Justice at a very basic
[1:01:48] level it just means the word prayer so
[1:01:51] he says I'm going to pour upon Jerusalem
[1:01:54] the spirit of Grace
[1:01:58] and prayer but look a little deeper into
[1:02:01] that word prayer and do you know what
[1:02:03] the the exact word
[1:02:06] that the Lexicon gave me
[1:02:09] desperation
[1:02:13] desperation
[1:02:15] now if you're spiritual if you're if
[1:02:16] you're a Believer here tonight
[1:02:18] you'll know that brother Brandon
[1:02:19] preaches the message the token which is
[1:02:21] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then
[1:02:23] comes to the evening Med comes to the
[1:02:25] message desperation it says something
[1:02:26] God gave me that was even more momentous
[1:02:28] than that message on the token it was a
[1:02:31] Capstone to the Token was the message
[1:02:33] desperations
[1:02:35] Lord Make Me desperate
[1:02:39] so what is this prayer that the Jew is
[1:02:42] praying God says I'll pour upon before
[1:02:44] he ever steps foot on the Mount of
[1:02:46] Olives before he ever comes down and
[1:02:48] fights for Israel for Jerusalem he first
[1:02:51] pours upon the House of David the spirit
[1:02:53] of Grace why Grace because they're going
[1:02:56] to need Grace
[1:02:58] why it's death so what does he bring
[1:03:00] desperations what is that prayer of
[1:03:03] desperations that prayer of desperation
[1:03:05] is the same thing that you've got to
[1:03:07] come brother random says until the
[1:03:09] church gets into desperations until she
[1:03:12] gets to a place to where she's so
[1:03:14] desperate that she wants the word lived
[1:03:17] in her life more than her daily bread
[1:03:19] and so what is he saying at the moment
[1:03:21] at the climax this is the crescendo this
[1:03:25] is the Day of Reckoning this is
[1:03:26] Armageddon this is when all nations have
[1:03:29] surrounded Israel a United Nations Army
[1:03:33] surrounds Israel this surrounds
[1:03:35] Jerusalem destroys its City plunders
[1:03:38] rifles the houses and at the moment of
[1:03:41] total despair
[1:03:44] Holocaust Holocaust part two
[1:03:47] is what it would probably feel like what
[1:03:49] it's going to probably feel like to the
[1:03:50] Jew
[1:03:51] but at the moment of total despair God
[1:03:54] says now I'm going to pour out my spirit
[1:03:57] of Grace
[1:04:00] because you're undeserving of this
[1:04:05] you're undeserving of it
[1:04:08] but they're his children
[1:04:10] and he says I'll pour out the spirit of
[1:04:13] Grace and supplication God has a way of
[1:04:18] reorchester of orchestrating your life
[1:04:20] and reorganizing things that bring
[1:04:23] tension and bring pressure and bring
[1:04:25] Calamity and you say why is this
[1:04:27] happening in my life right now because
[1:04:29] God's trying to pour out a spirit of
[1:04:32] Supplication of desperation when that
[1:04:36] Jew can say Lord I don't deserve it I
[1:04:38] don't know why you'd ever choose me but
[1:04:40] somehow you chose me I don't know why
[1:04:42] you would ever do it Lord I'm not worth
[1:04:44] it Lord I've been so hard-hearted and
[1:04:46] stiff-necked but you've poured on the
[1:04:48] spirit of Grace and supplication and the
[1:04:51] Bible says that when he pours that
[1:04:52] Spirit upon them all of Israel will
[1:04:55] become like David Like a Warrior all of
[1:04:58] Israel will suddenly their their hearts
[1:05:00] will be encouraged and God says then
[1:05:03] I'll step in the battlefield
[1:05:05] and I'll judge all the nations who've
[1:05:07] came to destroy it to to destroy Israel
[1:05:10] oh what a wonderful type so notice here
[1:05:13] he says it's the spirit of Grace
[1:05:16] unmerited favor and supplication it's a
[1:05:19] direct correlation to you and me look at
[1:05:22] our history notice this this is what God
[1:05:24] says brother Adam says what will be
[1:05:26] poured out upon the church and he says I
[1:05:28] believe there's coming I didn't have
[1:05:30] time to put it here on the on the slide
[1:05:31] but even in the message countdown
[1:05:33] brother Brandon begins to talk about the
[1:05:35] former and the latter rain will be
[1:05:37] poured out upon that group of people
[1:05:39] what is it going to be it's going to be
[1:05:42] rapturing grace
[1:05:47] brother random says here in the message
[1:05:49] to trial and you got this on the
[1:05:51] PowerPoint brother Peter if you could
[1:05:52] just play that display that second slide
[1:05:54] he says now still they won't believe it
[1:05:58] I'm just going to take a little turn and
[1:05:59] I'm going to try to do better tonight
[1:06:01] about my time uh I went in double
[1:06:04] overtime this morning so
[1:06:06] we're going to try to stay in single
[1:06:08] over time no I'm just kidding
[1:06:10] foreign
[1:06:11] notice what he says here now now still
[1:06:14] they won't believe it
[1:06:17] Jesus promised us it was in the days of
[1:06:19] Noah and as it was in the days of lot it
[1:06:21] would be in the last day we've got it
[1:06:23] it's here
[1:06:26] so remember what we talked about there's
[1:06:28] a special marker this was a moment this
[1:06:30] wasn't just a man speaking this wasn't
[1:06:33] just the voice of a Kentucky hillbilly
[1:06:35] this wasn't just another another moment
[1:06:38] in time he says we've got it this is the
[1:06:40] trial 1964. we've got it it's here it's
[1:06:44] already Vindicated just how many
[1:06:46] scriptures in the Sodom age what
[1:06:48] happened to Abraham when we turn back
[1:06:51] again to Abraham's Royal seed which is
[1:06:54] in Christ Christ returning
[1:06:57] in the form of the word working in human
[1:07:02] beings
[1:07:04] and showing the signs that he promised
[1:07:07] it would sign it would do he promised
[1:07:09] that he would do it
[1:07:11] God promised it and God will keep his
[1:07:15] promise
[1:07:17] so what is he trying to get them to
[1:07:19] understand in this message is the trial
[1:07:20] is Something's Happened it's not it's
[1:07:23] not not sure not it wasn't what you had
[1:07:26] yesterday
[1:07:27] it wasn't what Luther had it was greater
[1:07:29] it wasn't what Wesley had it was greater
[1:07:31] it wasn't what Pentecost said it was
[1:07:33] greater
[1:07:34] it wasn't the gift now it's The Giver
[1:07:37] it wasn't just his gift now it's his
[1:07:40] person
[1:07:41] why would brother Branham stand and turn
[1:07:43] his back to the audience and begin to
[1:07:45] discern the hearts of people with his
[1:07:48] back turn it was a sign of Melchizedek
[1:07:52] who had his back to the tent and
[1:07:54] discerned the heart of Sarah you say
[1:07:56] that was an accident brother Matt that
[1:07:57] was a momentous moment and it was trying
[1:08:01] to get you to understand something has
[1:08:03] happened
[1:08:04] something's taken place
[1:08:08] it was the Fulfillment of Luke 17 30.
[1:08:11] that as it was in the days of lots so
[1:08:13] shall it be in the days of the coming of
[1:08:15] the son of man so he says some things
[1:08:17] happen something's different
[1:08:19] it's greater than the greater than the
[1:08:21] automobile it's greater than the jet
[1:08:23] aircraft it's an astronaut age and
[1:08:25] there's nothing Beyond it
[1:08:31] there's nothing Beyond it
[1:08:33] so what was it we we use this term and
[1:08:37] I'm just going to go through some of
[1:08:38] this and I just the Lord is so impressed
[1:08:40] us upon my heart we use this term that
[1:08:43] the word was opened that they are the
[1:08:46] opening of the word so you say brother
[1:08:47] Matt what that sounds so clicheish what
[1:08:50] does it mean when you preachers say the
[1:08:52] the do you do you believe in the opening
[1:08:54] of the word let me just simplify it and
[1:08:56] this is an oversimplification I
[1:08:58] understand but let me just simplify it
[1:09:00] what is the opening of the word it's the
[1:09:02] opening of this Bible
[1:09:06] in its most simplistic way to say this
[1:09:08] brother Branham said it this way the
[1:09:10] Bible has became a whole new book
[1:09:16] so he said I looked at everything
[1:09:18] differently it's it's it's different
[1:09:20] than what the reformer thought it's not
[1:09:22] that God didn't use the reform remember
[1:09:24] one remember what we read this morning
[1:09:25] the one compliments the other you don't
[1:09:28] do away with Delta Airlines just because
[1:09:30] we got astronauts I still need a Delta
[1:09:32] to get here to Tucson but that doesn't
[1:09:35] mean there's not an astronaut we don't
[1:09:36] do away with one just because there's a
[1:09:39] greater it doesn't mean we do away with
[1:09:40] the framework
[1:09:42] right
[1:09:44] and so he says what was it it was the
[1:09:46] opening of the Bible that had been
[1:09:49] probed at
[1:09:51] for hundreds of years and brother random
[1:09:54] says it this way but with he says with a
[1:09:56] blindfold with a blindfold they would
[1:09:59] look at the word and they could feel the
[1:10:01] word and oh I think it's this no I think
[1:10:04] he's this no it was a an apple it was it
[1:10:06] was an allegory in the beginning it was
[1:10:09] just spoke of Adam's Disobedience they
[1:10:11] probed at it and brother Madam says when
[1:10:13] they probed at it they got some right
[1:10:14] some wrong some a little off some a
[1:10:17] little twisted they came up with three
[1:10:19] gods
[1:10:21] so what did God have to do he removed
[1:10:24] the blindfold by the Mighty God
[1:10:27] unveiling himself
[1:10:30] and that so what was it it was the
[1:10:32] opening it was what men had probed that
[1:10:34] theologians had probed that see you say
[1:10:36] brother Matt then what is the message of
[1:10:38] the hour it's the son of man revealing
[1:10:41] himself or unveiling himself
[1:10:46] that's the prophet's words
[1:10:47] and he's identifying himself by his word
[1:10:51] through a Melchizedek sign through a
[1:10:54] prophet so the word was made flesh
[1:10:56] working what did we just read here he's
[1:10:58] working in human beings the word was
[1:11:01] made flesh through a badger skin of a
[1:11:04] man
[1:11:07] you know I said I realized something the
[1:11:09] other day and I thought it was
[1:11:09] incredible it is so amazing to me how
[1:11:12] the religion and tradition is always
[1:11:15] just one step behind God always you
[1:11:19] notice in the days of Jehovah it was
[1:11:21] only a small select group of people who
[1:11:24] believed in the god of Jehovah but by
[1:11:25] the time Jesus comes on the scene and
[1:11:27] he's the Fulfillment of all of the Old
[1:11:29] Testament prophets now you have masses
[1:11:32] accepting Jehovah and you have a mo a
[1:11:35] small multitude accepting Jesus
[1:11:37] and so they accept Jehovah now that the
[1:11:40] anointed word is no longer under the law
[1:11:42] of Moses now the anointed word is became
[1:11:44] flesh and they crucified Jesus
[1:11:47] and then Jesus leaves the scene and now
[1:11:50] what do we have we have the
[1:11:51] administration of the spirit and now
[1:11:53] masses accept Jesus
[1:11:56] man I don't know if you realize that
[1:11:57] everybody's a Christian
[1:12:00] I don't know if y'all have that way in
[1:12:02] here but let me just speak for South
[1:12:03] Carolina
[1:12:04] everybody's a Christian
[1:12:06] I mean you ask someone are you a
[1:12:08] Christian and they'll say I'm a
[1:12:09] republican ain't I
[1:12:12] I voted for Trump right
[1:12:15] and so they they almost become
[1:12:17] synonymous one with the other
[1:12:18] everybody's a Christian so it religion
[1:12:20] is always one step behind the anointed
[1:12:23] word but now that the anointing word
[1:12:25] moves through a prophet they reject
[1:12:27] God's prophet and accept Jesus
[1:12:31] and now you have people who can why did
[1:12:33] Brother Branham say he said man never
[1:12:35] has trouble seeing God yesterday or God
[1:12:39] tomorrow but they have trouble seeing
[1:12:41] God today
[1:12:43] and so they accept that they they accept
[1:12:46] the prophet the word of God becoming
[1:12:48] flesh behind the seventh messenger but
[1:12:51] they reject that the word comes flesh in
[1:12:54] the body
[1:12:56] and so we're let me just say this I'm
[1:12:58] going to give some principles here and
[1:12:59] we don't have time to break them down
[1:13:01] really but I'm just going to say a few
[1:13:03] things here that will we can just say as
[1:13:04] principles so let me say it this way
[1:13:06] you're not living in the horse and buggy
[1:13:10] age you're not living in the in the
[1:13:13] automobile age you're not living in the
[1:13:15] jet aircraft age you're living in the
[1:13:17] astronaut age
[1:13:19] they're living in the age where brother
[1:13:20] Brandon would preach the seed is not
[1:13:23] Heir shall not be air with the shuck
[1:13:26] so he said what what happened through
[1:13:28] Panic through through Luther through
[1:13:30] Wesley all the way up to the restoration
[1:13:32] of the gifts the shuck pulls away
[1:13:35] when the grain manifests itself
[1:13:38] now do we do away with the chuck with
[1:13:40] the tassel no with the stalk no
[1:13:44] but we've moved Beyond this is what the
[1:13:46] prophet is trying to get them to see
[1:13:48] you've moved Beyond something you're not
[1:13:50] living in the age of partial truth
[1:13:53] anymore
[1:13:55] you're living not with a partial
[1:13:57] understanding but with the fullness of
[1:14:00] all that God wanted to give his church
[1:14:02] of all that God wanted to express of all
[1:14:06] God wanted to reveal you know what the
[1:14:09] you know what you restored back to
[1:14:10] everything the first church had
[1:14:15] oh I should get a loud hearty amen if
[1:14:17] this is a message church you've been
[1:14:19] restored back to everything the first
[1:14:22] church had
[1:14:24] and when I say that I mean all of it you
[1:14:27] know what that you know what the first
[1:14:28] church had the first church had all the
[1:14:31] gifts of the Spirit they had all the
[1:14:33] fruits of the spirit they had all the
[1:14:36] workings of the Holy Spirit they didn't
[1:14:37] leave off anything
[1:14:40] they didn't cut out anything so it
[1:14:42] wasn't a partial it was a fullness
[1:14:45] and so what is God doing so so what
[1:14:48] happens is that the brother random tells
[1:14:50] us and the seed shall not be aired with
[1:14:52] the Sheck and I think I may have it I
[1:14:54] don't let's just read this first
[1:14:55] Thessalonians 4 for the Lord himself
[1:14:57] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[1:15:00] and with a voice and the arcade of the
[1:15:03] Archangel with the Trump of God and the
[1:15:04] dead in Christ shall rise first then we
[1:15:07] which are alive and remain shall be
[1:15:09] caught up that word is harpazzo you know
[1:15:13] what that word literally means to be
[1:15:15] snatched out
[1:15:17] oh boy that sounds good to me brother
[1:15:19] Aaron snatch me out Lord this is what it
[1:15:23] means it says then we shall enlife that
[1:15:25] are alive and remain shall be snatched
[1:15:27] out we shall be pulled out of it
[1:15:30] and in the midst of when it gets so bad
[1:15:32] and and then it's dark as dark can get
[1:15:34] she gets pulled out of it all
[1:15:36] and so he says this is this is how this
[1:15:39] is this is what's to the believer he
[1:15:41] says the Lord himself shall be uh the
[1:15:43] Lord himself shout a sin from heaven
[1:15:44] with the shout notice in Revelations 10
[1:15:46] and I saw another Mighty Angel crowned
[1:15:49] with a loud voice as when a lion roared
[1:15:51] and when he had cried seven Thunders
[1:15:53] uttered their voices but in the days of
[1:15:56] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:15:58] shall begin to sound the mystery of God
[1:16:00] should be finished as he hath declared
[1:16:03] to his servants the prophets let me just
[1:16:06] be careful so I don't move too fast
[1:16:07] through this so he says the shock pulls
[1:16:11] away and this happens at the opening of
[1:16:13] The Seven Seals so Revelations 10 which
[1:16:16] is what we just read from Revelations 10
[1:16:19] so that it shows us that the that Christ
[1:16:22] would unveil himself in all of his
[1:16:26] fullness not a partial not a
[1:16:28] misunderstanding but a loud voice as
[1:16:32] when a lion roarth
[1:16:34] what was that loud voice it was to
[1:16:36] silence all other voices
[1:16:40] it would be a clear distinct as when a
[1:16:43] lion roarth
[1:16:45] it's the answer
[1:16:48] it's the indole it removes all doubt
[1:16:53] can you say Amen
[1:16:55] notice he says here now notice the very
[1:16:57] day when this messenger not when he
[1:16:58] starts out but when he begins to declare
[1:17:00] his message see the first bull healing
[1:17:02] second Bull prophesied third pull the
[1:17:04] opening of the word the Mysteries
[1:17:06] revealed no more there is no more higher
[1:17:08] order to reveal the word than prophets
[1:17:10] but the only way the prophet can be
[1:17:11] Vindicated is by the word and remember
[1:17:13] the third pool was the opening of film
[1:17:17] Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth
[1:17:21] that's been sealed in the word do you
[1:17:24] see it yes brother Branham I see it
[1:17:26] thank the Lord and so he says here he
[1:17:29] says still they won't believe it this is
[1:17:31] the message the trial that we read from
[1:17:32] and he's showing that he's gone as
[1:17:34] Christ is returning in the form of the
[1:17:36] word so as we said here the last time we
[1:17:39] were here so his his returning would be
[1:17:42] different
[1:17:44] then everything that was previous
[1:17:46] ly thought
[1:17:49] it was different than everything
[1:17:50] previously looked at it was more
[1:17:54] as brother random says over and over and
[1:17:55] that message the countdown this is
[1:17:58] something greater it's something further
[1:18:00] it's something not to do away with the
[1:18:04] previous but it complements the next
[1:18:07] it's greater power with less work
[1:18:14] the buggy the automobile was more power
[1:18:17] more horses less work
[1:18:19] the jet aircraft more power less work
[1:18:22] the astronaut more power
[1:18:25] less work
[1:18:27] and so brother Madam says what is this
[1:18:29] now brother Peter if you have that
[1:18:30] PowerPoint that I sent you the God of
[1:18:32] all time we're just going to turn a
[1:18:34] corner here and then
[1:18:36] find a stopping point notice
[1:18:39] notice this here we spent a lot of time
[1:18:41] to talk about this this morning
[1:18:44] because when you look at everything that
[1:18:46] we spoke about that it's a good that
[1:18:49] it's a great drama
[1:18:51] that everything that has happened God
[1:18:53] has already charted he's already planned
[1:18:56] it he's already charted it he's already
[1:18:59] scripted it and so to God it's like a
[1:19:02] rerun it's already happened
[1:19:05] now he says here and notice this notice
[1:19:07] this here brother random says he fills
[1:19:10] all time and then they have time to put
[1:19:12] this quote up here in all space and all
[1:19:15] eternity he's the God of all time David
[1:19:19] said it this way my time is in your
[1:19:23] hands Lord
[1:19:25] all my goings all my Cummings my raising
[1:19:28] my let my laying down all of it's in
[1:19:31] your hands Nebuchadnezzar had to realize
[1:19:34] this and confess it after God put him
[1:19:36] and made him made him like an animal
[1:19:38] that it wasn't a man who would be the
[1:19:40] great ruler of all kingdoms of the Earth
[1:19:41] but it would be Jehovah who was the king
[1:19:44] of all nations of the Earth
[1:19:46] we said it this morning that he was like
[1:19:48] the great Potter that molds The Vessel
[1:19:50] it molds the clay so all events that are
[1:19:54] happening are being controlled not by
[1:19:57] the Democrat might not by the as my dad
[1:20:00] says the demon Kratz
[1:20:02] are the Republicans
[1:20:05] none of it's being controlled by them
[1:20:07] they may think it is
[1:20:10] But ultimately it's been controlled
[1:20:13] by prophecy
[1:20:16] because that controls everything
[1:20:20] you have this word and and and it's and
[1:20:22] it's almost how you view time they call
[1:20:24] it the philosophy of History
[1:20:26] how you view this linear line that we
[1:20:31] call time and we make sense of that by
[1:20:33] yesterday or the past in the present and
[1:20:37] the future and it really just means how
[1:20:40] do you view or how do you think of that
[1:20:44] line called history which we referred to
[1:20:47] it today it's not history it's his story
[1:20:49] so there are five different types of
[1:20:53] this philosophy of history when you look
[1:20:55] at any person any philosopher any person
[1:20:56] writing a book they're going to have
[1:20:58] their own philosophy of how they view
[1:21:00] time
[1:21:01] and so so they they would they would
[1:21:03] notice a certain pattern or they'd try
[1:21:06] to find a certain pattern with history
[1:21:08] and to make sense of of of of the
[1:21:11] present you have to look and find a
[1:21:13] pattern from history so when you when
[1:21:15] you read a newspaper let me just say it
[1:21:17] this way when you read a newspaper uh or
[1:21:20] you read the news online most people
[1:21:21] don't read newspapers
[1:21:23] but you read the news or you you you
[1:21:25] look at something you could say do you
[1:21:27] see a pattern do you see something
[1:21:29] emerging that that something's taken
[1:21:32] place do you see a pattern of what's
[1:21:34] almost like a timeline almost like
[1:21:37] events that are leading up to something
[1:21:41] do you see any purpose
[1:21:44] or is it just repeated you know
[1:21:47] yesterday what was yesterday will be
[1:21:49] today and then what's tomorrow will be
[1:21:51] yesterday and today is just the same as
[1:21:53] it will be tomorrow and it's just the
[1:21:54] same as it was yesterday and there's
[1:21:56] really nothing
[1:21:57] new
[1:21:59] it just all just sort of randomly goes
[1:22:01] so it's just it's just like a it's it's
[1:22:04] it's it's the word let me just say this
[1:22:06] to you this morning that this evening
[1:22:08] there are people who view time as that
[1:22:10] wave and it's just happening I'll live
[1:22:13] here today I'll I'll I'll die one day
[1:22:16] and then my children or my grandchildren
[1:22:19] and and and time will go on and whatever
[1:22:21] Legacy I've left I'll just go out of his
[1:22:23] existence and time just keeps going on
[1:22:25] and going on and going on until finally
[1:22:27] all the polar caps melt and and then
[1:22:29] finally somewhere there's an apocalypse
[1:22:31] in the end of the world and then
[1:22:32] Humanity goes out of existence there's
[1:22:34] people who literally live every single
[1:22:35] day with that philosophy of their life
[1:22:39] that's why the Apostle Paul would say if
[1:22:41] in this life only I had hope I would be
[1:22:46] he says if this life was the only life I
[1:22:48] had I would be of all men most miserable
[1:22:54] it's like we preached on it before it's
[1:22:57] like a roundabout you ever get on a
[1:22:59] roundabout you know we have those back
[1:23:00] home just a traffic circle
[1:23:02] and you know the the point of that
[1:23:04] roundabout is to get off that roundabout
[1:23:07] it's not to go around and around and
[1:23:09] around and around and around and if you
[1:23:11] ever do that your people think you're a
[1:23:13] tourist and you're not from there you
[1:23:14] just go around and around and around and
[1:23:16] around but some people's lives are like
[1:23:18] this they just go around about the
[1:23:19] roundabout round about the roundabout no
[1:23:21] Direction no purpose not really coming
[1:23:23] where are they coming from I'd rather
[1:23:24] random called it like the man he talked
[1:23:26] it was a Drifter where'd you come from
[1:23:27] oh you know here and there where are you
[1:23:28] going oh I don't really know just here
[1:23:30] and there
[1:23:31] just sort of drifting and so they they
[1:23:33] come on this roundabout of life that I'm
[1:23:36] just you know I was just born and so so
[1:23:39] I just go through this cycle this great
[1:23:41] cycle of life I I wake up every day I've
[1:23:43] got a career I wake up I I say goodbye
[1:23:46] to my family I go to work I work a job
[1:23:49] whatever that is with my hands or
[1:23:51] whatever it is I get done with work put
[1:23:53] in my eight hours go home say hello to
[1:23:56] my family veg on entertainment take a
[1:23:58] shower brush my teeth go to bed I wake
[1:24:01] up the next day and I go back to work I
[1:24:03] say goodbye to my family I work all day
[1:24:05] I come home I greet my family I veg on
[1:24:08] entertainment I go to bed and then I
[1:24:10] wake up and then I go back to work and I
[1:24:12] work eight hours a day and then I come
[1:24:15] home and I Vigilant entertainment then I
[1:24:17] wake up the next day and I work eight
[1:24:19] hours the next day then I come home you
[1:24:21] want me to keep going
[1:24:24] and people just go around and around and
[1:24:26] around
[1:24:27] and around and around and around and
[1:24:29] then they go for 50 60 years and then
[1:24:31] they retire and they step off the
[1:24:33] roundabout about about the point where
[1:24:34] they stepped off
[1:24:36] and that's how they live their life
[1:24:38] but let me tell you that's not how God's
[1:24:40] called ordained your life you've got a
[1:24:43] purpose you've got a plan you're headed
[1:24:46] somewhere you're not part of a circle
[1:24:48] you're part of a linear line that leads
[1:24:51] from this Dimension to another dimension
[1:24:54] and so my life is a purpose when I read
[1:24:56] the word of God let me just stop here
[1:24:59] and say for a minute you can read the
[1:25:00] word of God like a newspaper
[1:25:02] like a story and that's good sometimes I
[1:25:04] mean it's not not a bad thing you know
[1:25:06] it's not a bad thing to read the Bible
[1:25:08] like a story there are great stories out
[1:25:09] of it I mean you know you should get a
[1:25:12] children's Bible one time
[1:25:13] it's wonderful children's Bible you read
[1:25:16] through I remember reading through a
[1:25:17] children's Bible and I'm literally
[1:25:18] looking at things going wait a minute is
[1:25:20] that in the Bible and then open my bible
[1:25:22] and go oh yeah actually it is in the
[1:25:24] Bible what was it it was it was a way
[1:25:27] that I had never heard it before or said
[1:25:28] it and then it opens my mind that
[1:25:30] there's a way we need teaching we need
[1:25:32] good Sunday school we need to we need to
[1:25:34] learn about these things but let me just
[1:25:35] say this I'm not reading the word just
[1:25:38] like a newspaper or an edge of academic
[1:25:41] knowledge that I can again in my head
[1:25:43] I'm not reading that I'm not reading the
[1:25:45] word like a horoscope to see what kind
[1:25:47] of day or what kind of life and how God
[1:25:48] can better my life but when I read the
[1:25:51] word I I got a desire to know where do I
[1:25:55] fit in where's my purpose in the midst
[1:25:58] of all of this plan where's my spot
[1:26:00] what's my day in its message what has
[1:26:03] God ordained for me specifically
[1:26:09] I want to find the purpose not just for
[1:26:12] the whole universe
[1:26:14] but I want to know where do I fit in
[1:26:16] and all of that great universe so notice
[1:26:20] here there's there's different five
[1:26:22] different patterns
[1:26:23] that people in our world see world
[1:26:25] events four of these five are being
[1:26:28] thrown at us in the world today if we're
[1:26:30] not careful you say to the mat why are
[1:26:32] you saying that because it's so
[1:26:33] important the lens the lens that you
[1:26:37] have when you look at time it's so
[1:26:39] important how you frame what's happening
[1:26:41] in your mind and when you have a
[1:26:43] perspective of a horse and buggy it will
[1:26:46] be totally different than the
[1:26:47] perspective of the automobile and the
[1:26:50] automobile will have a totally different
[1:26:51] perspective than the jet aircraft but
[1:26:54] guess what the astronaut has a whole
[1:26:56] different View
[1:26:59] and brother Brandon said this morning
[1:27:00] you're a spiritual astronaut
[1:27:03] you look at things differently
[1:27:07] you're an oddball
[1:27:09] and that's good
[1:27:12] you're not normal to the rest of the
[1:27:14] world you're not I don't fit in you're
[1:27:16] not supposed to fit it
[1:27:19] I mean if you believe the words of Jesus
[1:27:21] he's the one who said they hated me
[1:27:24] they'll hate you
[1:27:27] so notice here it's the philosophy of
[1:27:29] History sorry these are too small for
[1:27:31] you to read just I'm just going to go
[1:27:33] through some of them here you have this
[1:27:35] first
[1:27:36] cyclic View
[1:27:39] in the cyclic view it just means history
[1:27:41] is going nowhere it's just no pattern
[1:27:44] there's no purpose just history just
[1:27:47] keeps repeating and repeating and
[1:27:49] there's good times and then there's bad
[1:27:51] times and then there's Christmas and
[1:27:53] then there's birthdays and then there's
[1:27:55] funerals and it's just part of like
[1:27:57] there's really no pattern and no purpose
[1:27:59] and it's just a great big cycle going
[1:28:01] round and around and around and around
[1:28:03] and around history just keeps repeating
[1:28:05] itself we have some good men raise up
[1:28:07] good leaders then we have bad leaders
[1:28:09] then it's just a big old you know big
[1:28:11] old roundabout you know as we said you
[1:28:13] just get on the roundabout then you get
[1:28:15] off somewhere and retire in life and
[1:28:17] that's really it and then you have the
[1:28:20] Epic view of history epic view of
[1:28:22] History it goes forward it's a it's a
[1:28:25] forward we're going forward but it goes
[1:28:28] forwards and ups and then downs and you
[1:28:32] sort of hope your life ends on an up and
[1:28:34] not a Down
[1:28:35] and it's just this you know good times
[1:28:38] rich people then there's poor people
[1:28:40] there's inflation and deflation
[1:28:42] and then you have the
[1:28:44] optimistic view of History
[1:28:48] that history is getting better it's the
[1:28:51] optimistic view brother Aaron we're
[1:28:53] we're increasing in technology and
[1:28:55] education and Science and you know the
[1:28:57] new scientific discoveries and it's just
[1:29:00] getting better and and I agree there's
[1:29:02] been some great advancements out of
[1:29:04] modern medicine but this idea that that
[1:29:06] all of our hope is in our scientists and
[1:29:08] discovering education and they spend
[1:29:10] billions on NASA and trying to find
[1:29:13] alien life and and and what is it it's
[1:29:15] all an optimistic view we're trying to
[1:29:17] it's a hope and God put that hope in man
[1:29:21] but he's channeling it through the wrong
[1:29:23] thing he'll never find his hope in
[1:29:25] education or science there's only hope
[1:29:27] in one thing and that's the word
[1:29:29] there will be no peace until Jesus comes
[1:29:33] and so there's this optimistic view
[1:29:35] life's getting better all the time in
[1:29:38] the 1900s this is what everybody thought
[1:29:40] oh it's just getting better and better
[1:29:43] and but better you know you could sum up
[1:29:46] this entire view with this word progress
[1:29:49] progressives we're just progressing
[1:29:52] we're moving forward and and and and and
[1:29:55] and everything's just going to get
[1:29:56] better it's just to get better it's
[1:29:58] going to get better it's going to get
[1:29:59] better you know a British it's
[1:30:01] incredible the British prime minister
[1:30:04] won an election on this slogan up and up
[1:30:08] and up and on and on and on
[1:30:11] a powerful slogan up and up and up and
[1:30:15] on and on and on it'll just get better
[1:30:18] you know they thought at the turn of the
[1:30:20] 20th century Humanity thought this was
[1:30:24] going to be the greatest era of human
[1:30:27] history it was optimistic it's going to
[1:30:30] be the greatest in Discovery with all
[1:30:33] the modern inventions and all the modern
[1:30:35] discoveries it's going to help us
[1:30:37] overcome all of our problems and all
[1:30:39] life is going to be good
[1:30:43] life is going to be better and better
[1:30:46] and better this was Charles Darwin's
[1:30:48] View
[1:30:50] in the view of evolution
[1:30:53] that will evolve and get better and
[1:30:55] we'll get better and we'll get better
[1:30:56] and just keep going up and up and up how
[1:30:59] opposite is that from the Bible view of
[1:31:03] since the fall man has been going down
[1:31:06] and down and down
[1:31:10] it'll just get better and better and
[1:31:12] man's evolving and Technologies
[1:31:15] involving we're increasing everything
[1:31:17] will just get better and Mankind entered
[1:31:19] the 20th century with that High Hope of
[1:31:23] of of of of of of optimism
[1:31:27] then you know what happened the Titanic
[1:31:29] the boat they said God can't even sink
[1:31:33] went to the bottom of the ocean
[1:31:36] and with it sunk all man's hopes for the
[1:31:39] greatest Century of modern invention
[1:31:43] it was the first you could say it this
[1:31:45] way the largest
[1:31:47] man-made object ever built
[1:31:51] filled in its vessel it was
[1:31:54] representative of man's greatest
[1:31:58] achievements oh this is incredible you
[1:32:01] think about this for a moment the
[1:32:02] Titanic was representative of man's best
[1:32:06] efforts of his best scientist of his
[1:32:11] best Engineers of his best it was all
[1:32:14] represented in the Titanic with his
[1:32:15] greatest Technologies in so much that
[1:32:19] man was so arrogant they would say God
[1:32:22] himself couldn't sink it
[1:32:26] so you know what God did please don't
[1:32:28] get
[1:32:31] what he did
[1:32:33] he sunk it
[1:32:36] and still let me say this still the
[1:32:39] Titanic is the most popular shipwreck in
[1:32:43] history
[1:32:44] you know why it pricked the bubble
[1:32:48] of great optimism
[1:32:51] it was the first bubble in progress it
[1:32:55] was the first major disaster of the 20th
[1:32:58] century and it challenged man's ability
[1:33:02] it challenged science it challenged
[1:33:05] education and so you say brother Matt
[1:33:07] did what follows that what follows the
[1:33:10] Titanic is the first woe
[1:33:13] of World War One
[1:33:17] or if you study World War One
[1:33:20] you want to talk about an overwhelming
[1:33:23] number it's unfathomable
[1:33:27] the amount
[1:33:29] of death
[1:33:31] that world war one brings
[1:33:33] I believe it's a third of all Europeans
[1:33:36] uh uh I I don't want to quote the number
[1:33:40] here just read it just the other day but
[1:33:42] the amount of death
[1:33:44] that World War One brought
[1:33:49] it was one of the greatest terrors
[1:33:52] it was one of the greatest Horrors
[1:33:55] of mankind this after all of our effort
[1:33:58] and all of our progress
[1:34:00] now World War one where the entire world
[1:34:03] is at War and you know what
[1:34:06] Humanity scene just an unfortunate event
[1:34:10] just a uh you know a a man who was out
[1:34:13] of his mind just a a a
[1:34:16] narcissistic uh you know Adolf Hitler
[1:34:20] but you know what
[1:34:22] God had already seen it in Prophecy
[1:34:25] and God had already prophesied and used
[1:34:27] used a vision through it through the
[1:34:29] through through a prophet to to prophesy
[1:34:32] about the rise of Adolf Hitler and the
[1:34:35] rise of fascism Nazism and communism
[1:34:39] and so man looked at us just another
[1:34:41] event but it you know what it was it was
[1:34:43] an important marker
[1:34:45] it was a momentous moment that would
[1:34:48] change everything
[1:34:51] and no one would ever be the same from
[1:34:53] World War one then what did you have
[1:34:55] that followed World War Two
[1:34:58] it was the optimistic view of history
[1:35:01] that had been at that point completely
[1:35:03] destroyed in fact the 20th century was
[1:35:06] could be labeled the worst
[1:35:09] of all centuries so you have the
[1:35:12] pessimistic view I think I have it on
[1:35:13] the next slide
[1:35:15] the pessimistic View
[1:35:17] was that things are not getting better
[1:35:19] they're getting worse
[1:35:21] they're getting worse and worse and
[1:35:24] worse and worse destruction is
[1:35:26] unavoidable there's global warming the
[1:35:29] melting of the polar caps we're all
[1:35:30] going towards doomsday and we're all
[1:35:32] gonna everything's gonna everything's
[1:35:34] gonna end now there's a lot of Truth to
[1:35:36] both of these views you see what they're
[1:35:38] mixing and the optimistic and the
[1:35:40] pessimistic View
[1:35:42] the pessimistic view says things are
[1:35:44] getting worse history is going downhill
[1:35:46] not uphill we're doomed to destruction
[1:35:49] the economy is going to crash we're all
[1:35:52] going to die in a nuclear bomb
[1:35:57] the cyclic
[1:35:58] View
[1:36:00] the Epic View
[1:36:03] you have the
[1:36:06] optimistic View
[1:36:08] you have the
[1:36:11] pessimistic View
[1:36:13] sorry for my simple labels here
[1:36:17] the up
[1:36:19] and then the down
[1:36:21] and worse and worse and worse say
[1:36:24] brother Matt then what view do we have
[1:36:25] we have the God view
[1:36:29] you see brother Matt what is the God
[1:36:30] view the God view says that yes things
[1:36:33] will steadily get worse and worse and
[1:36:36] worse and worse and go down all the way
[1:36:38] to where it looks completely hopeless
[1:36:40] and then suddenly out of nowhere with no
[1:36:44] build up to the rest of the world no one
[1:36:47] notices anything suddenly the God view
[1:36:50] says history is going to get worse and
[1:36:52] worse and worse
[1:36:54] but then out of nowhere it's going to
[1:36:56] get better
[1:36:59] who's going up on that Arrow
[1:37:02] to say Lord I'm not going down with the
[1:37:04] rest of the world there's going to be a
[1:37:06] harpazzo where I'm snatched out of all
[1:37:09] of it oh it may look like for Israel
[1:37:12] that all hope is lost but at the moment
[1:37:14] when all hope is lost God steps in
[1:37:17] and it may look like your life is all
[1:37:19] lost but just wait God's at the darkest
[1:37:22] moment God at The Darkest Hour just just
[1:37:25] before the dawn
[1:37:27] and God steps in and changes everything
[1:37:31] and we don't just go on a sudden incline
[1:37:33] we go straight up
[1:37:37] notice this here and I'm just going to
[1:37:39] skip some of these slides brother Peter
[1:37:42] sorry to have you go back and forth go
[1:37:43] to my previous one
[1:37:46] I'm going to skip some of these here
[1:37:47] that I have notice what he speaks about
[1:37:49] the Jews brother Adam says in the
[1:37:51] Revelation slide 10 of the first one I
[1:37:53] sent you brother Peter
[1:37:55] the the hour of Grace and supplication
[1:37:57] I'm going to close you all right
[1:37:59] and he says in the revelation of Jesus
[1:38:01] Christ yes thank you the Gen this
[1:38:04] Gentile message as the Jews brought it
[1:38:07] to the Gentiles the Gentiles would take
[1:38:10] it right back to the Jews again and the
[1:38:13] Rapture will come I'm looking forward to
[1:38:15] that day
[1:38:16] now he will pour out upon the house of
[1:38:19] Israel what the same Holy Spirit see
[1:38:24] they don't receive anything different
[1:38:26] than what you receive
[1:38:28] why does God send them Moses and Elijah
[1:38:30] Purdue prophets to give them the same
[1:38:33] thing a jubilees coming to Israel for
[1:38:35] the second time Pentecostal fall for the
[1:38:38] second time in Jerusalem and now speak
[1:38:41] with other tongues and great Miracles we
[1:38:42] don't know what we don't know what's
[1:38:44] going to happen because it's not I won't
[1:38:45] be here that Joseph dismissed his uh the
[1:38:48] queen to the palace and then revealed
[1:38:50] himself to Benjamin so where will you be
[1:38:52] I'll be at the waiting for the wedding
[1:38:54] supper I'm already married right here
[1:38:56] and I'm going to a supper one day
[1:38:58] oh but notice brother Adam says what
[1:39:00] happens he reveal he says God will pour
[1:39:03] out a spirit the same Holy Spirit after
[1:39:06] the Gentile church is gone not only will
[1:39:10] it be a mournful time for the Jews who
[1:39:13] rejected him as Messiah but it'll be a
[1:39:16] mournful time for them left Gentiles
[1:39:18] back here
[1:39:19] who has accepted notice this it'll be a
[1:39:22] mournful time for those Jews as we just
[1:39:25] read
[1:39:26] and I can't imagine
[1:39:29] I was reading this in Zechariah the
[1:39:30] early morning hours and I just stopped
[1:39:33] for a minute and thought I can't imagine
[1:39:35] you you imagine the
[1:39:38] the the the the the
[1:39:40] embarrassment or shame
[1:39:43] as the Bible says them they'll be bitter
[1:39:45] like in bitterness of them on themselves
[1:39:48] that they realize this is this is this
[1:39:50] is this is who you've pierced this is
[1:39:52] who you've crucified I was so wrong
[1:39:56] I was so wrong all those years I was so
[1:40:00] wrong
[1:40:02] you know what God will say what did
[1:40:04] Joseph say
[1:40:05] don't worry
[1:40:06] what the enemy intended for evil
[1:40:09] God has made for good
[1:40:13] and brother random says he'll reveal
[1:40:15] himself to them notice it won't be just
[1:40:17] a mournful time for them Jews but also
[1:40:20] them gentiles
[1:40:22] who has rejected him as their Messiah of
[1:40:25] this day
[1:40:28] they'll be welling and weeping the
[1:40:31] sleeping virgin will be willing that's
[1:40:33] the church that refused to get oil in
[1:40:36] its light do not think of a church you
[1:40:39] passed on the way to this church tonight
[1:40:41] don't think of the denominational system
[1:40:43] where the foolish virgin will be listen
[1:40:46] friends it's not a group it's individual
[1:40:48] basis
[1:40:50] it will be all individuals who refused
[1:40:54] to get the light into their vessel you
[1:40:58] say what is that light it's the light of
[1:40:59] the Holy Ghost it won't be those who
[1:41:01] just accept mentally the message of the
[1:41:04] hour that God sent in Prophet won't be
[1:41:06] those who just pay the biggest tithes or
[1:41:07] go on the most mission trips it's not
[1:41:10] going to be that friends it's going to
[1:41:11] be those that that wise virgin has
[1:41:14] trimmed their lamps and they're ready
[1:41:15] they're waiting they're watching they're
[1:41:18] an expectation for the coming of the
[1:41:20] Lord
[1:41:21] their entire life their perspective is
[1:41:24] different
[1:41:29] he says that's the church that refused
[1:41:31] to get oil oh I wonder if you could just
[1:41:33] raise a hand and say Lord let me get
[1:41:35] make sure I have oil
[1:41:36] let me get oil in my vessel and he says
[1:41:40] so I pray tonight I love this faith of
[1:41:42] Abraham so I prayed tonight
[1:41:45] father
[1:41:46] that you'll wake up somebody to the
[1:41:49] knowledge to know that unless they're
[1:41:52] born again of the spirit of God has
[1:41:54] received and then become Abraham's seed
[1:41:57] that they'll never be able to make the
[1:42:00] rapture
[1:42:03] how
[1:42:05] desperate
[1:42:07] brother Brandon says it takes true
[1:42:10] desperation
[1:42:12] that God literally can reprogram your if
[1:42:15] you're a seed of God and a child of God
[1:42:17] God will break your wallet he will break
[1:42:20] your health he'll break your home he'll
[1:42:23] do whatever he has to do to genuine to
[1:42:26] generate desperation out of a seed of
[1:42:29] God
[1:42:31] because he said I'll not lose
[1:42:34] any of them
[1:42:37] brother Brandon says let may you wake
[1:42:39] somebody up tonight to realize they'll
[1:42:42] never go in that Rapture without the
[1:42:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost so I pray
[1:42:47] father that you'll give rapturing
[1:42:51] Grace
[1:42:55] what is Rapture in Grace oh it's just
[1:42:58] some oh I don't really know what it is
[1:43:00] brother Matt is just some kind of Hocus
[1:43:02] Pocus you know at that moment I'll just
[1:43:04] live any old life I want to and just
[1:43:05] keep living a carnal life and then bam
[1:43:07] boom just Rapture and Grace no that's
[1:43:09] that's that's that's a deception on the
[1:43:11] LIE of the devil
[1:43:13] you want to know what your rapture in
[1:43:15] Grace is it's right here
[1:43:18] be born of the spirit of God
[1:43:20] this is your rapture in Grace
[1:43:23] this is what gives you rapturing Grace
[1:43:27] the Holy Ghost enables you
[1:43:30] and a a free it it avails you of all the
[1:43:34] promises of God and he says so I pray
[1:43:36] you give them Rapture and Grace tonight
[1:43:39] oh Jehovah Jireh now we've seen all
[1:43:41] kinds of great moves and shouting and
[1:43:43] praising God oh fine we're not doing
[1:43:47] away with any of that we want that we
[1:43:49] need that I experience that I want to
[1:43:51] experience more of that
[1:43:54] and he says we've spoken tongues and
[1:43:57] prophesied no one's doing away with that
[1:44:00] we've spoken tongues and prophesied at
[1:44:02] all we've seen all of that that's fine
[1:44:04] listen what he says that comes right
[1:44:07] along with it
[1:44:10] but remember the last thing is his
[1:44:15] divine
[1:44:17] presence
[1:44:18] the word itself
[1:44:22] he is the word the head why would
[1:44:26] brother Brandon have to say this over
[1:44:27] and over and over to the Pentecostal
[1:44:29] Church they wanted the signs they wanted
[1:44:32] the Wonders they wanted the Miracles
[1:44:34] they wanted the tongues but they didn't
[1:44:35] want the word
[1:44:37] because the word brought correction
[1:44:43] he says what comes last
[1:44:46] is the word
[1:44:48] he's the word that had the word it's
[1:44:50] coming to the body
[1:44:56] it's coming to the body now it's not
[1:45:00] some man here is the messiah
[1:45:03] it's the holy spirit is the messiah
[1:45:06] Christ and the Holy Spirit is the same
[1:45:08] thing so here it is now just working in
[1:45:12] the flesh
[1:45:14] getting the body ready for rapturing
[1:45:17] Grace
[1:45:18] believe it friends
[1:45:20] but I pray this is countdown we read
[1:45:22] from this message just one of the last
[1:45:24] ones I'm going to read here he says but
[1:45:26] I pray that you'll give them such a
[1:45:29] crave I love the way brother Brandon
[1:45:31] prays this in his prayer because some
[1:45:33] people say I'm not where I want to be
[1:45:35] I'm not where I'm not I know that in my
[1:45:37] life it looks like a mess brother Matt
[1:45:39] I'm not where I want to be then you say
[1:45:41] what do I do I pray that God gives you a
[1:45:44] crave pray that God gives you a desire
[1:45:46] if you don't have it you can at least
[1:45:48] pray for that brother Brandon says I
[1:45:49] pray that you give them such a crave for
[1:45:51] it Lord that they'll come and see where
[1:45:54] at the end time the astronaut age
[1:45:56] I pray father they'll realize it isn't
[1:45:59] trying to condemn what they had
[1:46:03] it isn't trying to condemn what they had
[1:46:09] it's only trying to give them more
[1:46:14] it isn't trying to condemn them for what
[1:46:17] they have
[1:46:19] trying to give them more
[1:46:24] if you want more there's more
[1:46:29] if you've got a craving for something
[1:46:31] more there's more
[1:46:34] and he says it isn't trying to condemn
[1:46:36] them for what they had he said it's only
[1:46:38] trying to give them more rapturing grace
[1:46:41] for the hour will come and we'll have to
[1:46:43] have Rapture power not only to heal the
[1:46:46] body but to change it in a moment in a
[1:46:50] twinkling of an eye
[1:46:53] and he says Christ you say how brother
[1:46:55] Matt how is that going to happen listen
[1:46:58] to what he says Christ will be so real
[1:47:03] into their bodies till he can change it
[1:47:06] I don't know about you but when I read
[1:47:08] this quote in my home I just raised up
[1:47:11] my hand and say then let Christ be more
[1:47:14] real than he's ever been in my whole
[1:47:16] life that's my prayer is that your
[1:47:18] prayer tonight let Christ become so real
[1:47:23] in my body
[1:47:25] till he can change it
[1:47:28] brother random says let him become so
[1:47:32] real
[1:47:33] by his great death and what he's
[1:47:35] purchased may they take this today that
[1:47:38] token that I spoke of last night hold it
[1:47:41] before them and walk into this astronaut
[1:47:44] Granite father where Visions powers and
[1:47:48] worlds be unknown
[1:47:51] oh God where all the great mysteries of
[1:47:54] God is unfolded in those Seven Seals and
[1:47:56] made known to man granted
[1:47:59] father
[1:48:01] is that your prayer here tonight
[1:48:04] I wonder if you could stand to your feet
[1:48:06] with me
[1:48:10] and just bow your heads to the Lord just
[1:48:12] for a moment
[1:48:15] every head bowed every I closed just
[1:48:18] reverent now to the Lord
[1:48:28] something's happening
[1:48:31] let me just say it that way
[1:48:33] something's taken place I said it over
[1:48:35] and over and over again this morning
[1:48:38] whether you or I are on the sideline and
[1:48:43] not part of it some things happen
[1:48:47] happens we read it here tonight God's
[1:48:49] doing something all the time he's not
[1:48:53] static
[1:48:55] he's not stagnant he's Dynamic he's
[1:48:58] moving
[1:48:59] [Music]
[1:49:00] and how to say Lord
[1:49:02] let me be a part of it
[1:49:07] I wonder how many would just raise a
[1:49:09] hand not to me I'm not even looking
[1:49:12] and just say to the Lord Lord
[1:49:15] let me miss it
[1:49:16] don't let me be so caught up and
[1:49:18] distracted by what's happening around me
[1:49:22] that I miss what you're doing right now
[1:49:25] one of these days
[1:49:28] that message will go to Israel
[1:49:31] God will send unto them Moses and Elijah
[1:49:34] and Revelations 11 and they'll do signs
[1:49:37] and wonders in Jehovah's sign
[1:49:39] while the Gentile is finished
[1:49:41] the grace the day of Grace
[1:49:45] will leave the Gentile Church
[1:49:48] the denominations will continue on
[1:49:51] because they come up here with a
[1:49:53] sleeping virgin
[1:49:57] but when they do
[1:49:59] when they do that
[1:50:01] the Jews will receive the baptism of the
[1:50:04] Holy Ghost
[1:50:09] that'll be their day
[1:50:10] but let me say this to you young person
[1:50:12] let me say this to you old young person
[1:50:14] let me say this to you elderly
[1:50:17] foreign
[1:50:18] right now
[1:50:20] is your day of Grace and supplication
[1:50:24] today is the day of salvation not
[1:50:26] tomorrow
[1:50:28] don't be like Felix of Paul who said
[1:50:30] leave me Paul for at a more convenient
[1:50:32] time out
[1:50:34] the Bible says it Paul's word so
[1:50:36] convicted Felix that he he came under
[1:50:38] conviction but then he said just leave
[1:50:39] me I don't want to hear this right now
[1:50:41] my life's too busy can't contemplate
[1:50:43] that
[1:50:44] we don't ever know what happened to it
[1:50:46] oh don't be guilty of that
[1:50:48] just open up your heart right now while
[1:50:51] he's knocking If any man will hear my
[1:50:54] voice and open up the door I'll come in
[1:50:56] and sup with him that's a promise to you
[1:50:59] prodigal that's a promise to you
[1:51:01] backslider that's a promise to you
[1:51:03] lukewarm that's a promise to you child
[1:51:05] of God that's a promise to all of us
[1:51:08] this is the day of Grace
[1:51:11] and supplications
[1:51:13] this is the day where the Gentiles
[1:51:16] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:51:19] this is the day where you receive your
[1:51:21] token
[1:51:22] this is the day where God changes you
[1:51:27] from a horse and buggy
[1:51:30] the automobile
[1:51:31] from an automobile to a jet aircraft
[1:51:34] from a jet aircraft
[1:51:36] to an astronaut
[1:51:38] and I believe God's doing it today
[1:51:42] and I just want to say Lord I want to be
[1:51:44] a part of it
[1:51:46] don't let me miss it Lord Jesus
[1:51:49] oh God as I raise my hands Lord and
[1:51:53] standing instead Lord of my own needs I
[1:51:56] stand with all of these that are here
[1:51:58] this isn't me up here in them down there
[1:52:00] Lord I'm right here in the thick of it
[1:52:02] and right here in the middle of it Lord
[1:52:04] raising my hands out of desperation what
[1:52:07] is that it's a it's a unmerited Grace I
[1:52:10] don't deserve it I don't know why you
[1:52:12] would choose me I don't know why you
[1:52:14] would still love me but I'm just going
[1:52:16] to raise my hand and say Lord I want to
[1:52:17] receive whatever you want to give me
[1:52:20] whatever my heavenly father wants to
[1:52:22] give me I want to receive it Lord
[1:52:27] I want to receive it I don't want to
[1:52:30] miss it
[1:52:34] all right Lord Jesus
[1:52:39] Granite Lord I wonder if we could play
[1:52:40] that song you played set your wings to
[1:52:42] The Winds of faith I want you to keep
[1:52:45] your head bowed
[1:52:46] just for another moment here

[2:14:57] can
[2:14:58] he would not give you anything that you

[2:15:05] glory you don't do this alone
[2:15:08] amen and I appreciate that as brother
[2:15:11] Matt was speaking it brought it brought
[2:15:13] something to my memory
[2:15:16] we had just moved here in 1976 this
[2:15:19] message had come
[2:15:20] and and you know 46 years ago 47 years
[2:15:24] ago it was just all new to us
[2:15:27] things we hadn't hadn't even heard
[2:15:29] didn't realize it was in the Scriptures
[2:15:32] it just hadn't been
[2:15:34] some family of ours came over to see us
[2:15:37] about a year later
[2:15:38] and he had been our pastor in the
[2:15:41] Pentecostal Church
[2:15:42] and he loves the Lord my uncle still
[2:15:44] loves the Lord with all his heart
[2:15:46] but he made some comments
[2:15:49] and out of my my voice came this I said
[2:15:53] but Uncle
[2:15:54] we are seeing things today in this
[2:15:57] scripture
[2:15:58] that you have never seen before in your
[2:16:01] life
[2:16:03] I don't even know why he said it but now
[2:16:05] I know why
[2:16:06] because God was unveiling himself
[2:16:09] unveiling and if we're not careful we
[2:16:11] say okay that's enough of the book
[2:16:14] we gotta say Lord be it unto me
[2:16:17] according to Thy Word
[2:16:19] every promise in the book is mine every
[2:16:22] chapter every verse every line
[2:16:28] oh every promise in the book is my
[2:16:34] marriage after every verse every night
[2:16:40] I am trusting in his love
[2:16:45] divine
[2:16:46] every promise in the book is mine
[2:16:52] every promise in the book is mine sign
[2:16:57] your name to it every chapter every
[2:17:00] verse every time
[2:17:05] trusting in his love
[2:17:08] divine
[2:17:10] every promise in the
[2:17:13] business
[2:17:16] filling the amount
[2:17:18] he's already signed a check and said
[2:17:20] it's yours fill in that which you have
[2:17:22] made us Lord we thank you
[2:17:24] for your word today
[2:17:26] it's not a new mystery it's not
[2:17:30] something we've never heard but Lord
[2:17:31] sometimes it'll just click it'll just
[2:17:35] suddenly come together
[2:17:37] Lord it is something that has been in
[2:17:39] the scripture it's not a new book that
[2:17:41] had never been written down lord but
[2:17:44] it's just something that suddenly
[2:17:45] becomes real to us Lord in its time and
[2:17:48] in its place Lord each one being a child
[2:17:51] of God maybe maybe as a little child as
[2:17:54] a baby they're born into a royal family
[2:17:56] but they don't know that yet their
[2:17:59] children they cry like children they act
[2:18:01] like children lord they're just but as
[2:18:04] they begin to grow and as they begin to
[2:18:06] to to get some knowledge of what is
[2:18:08] happening and begin to see they realize
[2:18:11] that they were born into a royal family
[2:18:15] father not of their own doing Lord but
[2:18:18] it's of your doing father we are part of
[2:18:20] this royal family because you chose us
[2:18:22] Lord and we recognize it today that
[2:18:25] you're our father we are your children
[2:18:27] we're Heirs of this great Promises of
[2:18:30] God
[2:18:31] and every promise in the book is our
[2:18:33] sword
[2:18:34] and we have a right to it
[2:18:36] it pleases the father when he sees his
[2:18:39] sons his daughters come and saying
[2:18:41] that's mine I can have it I can partake
[2:18:44] of it it pleases the father Lord Lord
[2:18:48] let us be pleasing to you Lord let us
[2:18:50] take it by faith and live it by Faith

[2:18:55] is included Lord for all that was in
[2:18:59] Christ God God he poured into Christ and

[2:19:04] into his church his beloved bride Lord
