[0:01] God bless you, brothers and sisters. No,
[0:02] I'm not leading
[0:04] songs. Won't get up and
[0:07] leave. I uh I just want to say a few
[0:10] words before we start. Are we on the
[0:14] Manny? Okay. Um first of all, I want to
[0:19] I want to thank everyone. This morning
[0:21] was just a stellar stellar
[0:24] service and it was it was just
[0:30] to see the the people that were in the
[0:32] front rows here. Manny, you were sitting
[0:34] next to them, to see how the Lord
[0:37] touched them, especially at the end of
[0:39] service. The first couple rows, they
[0:42] were just weeping and praising the Lord.
[0:46] And I I just thought I was just I was so
[0:49] proud. And then the man that walked in,
[0:52] the homeless man. I want to thank our
[0:55] deacons and our trustees for the very
[0:58] professional job that they did this
[1:01] morning. You brothers did a great
[1:06] job. I thought it was handled with a lot
[1:08] of class and and very very professional.
[1:13] Very very nice job.
[1:15] And I also want to say just this is more
[1:19] to the elders in the
[1:21] church. I know the sacrifices brothers
[1:24] and sisters that you've
[1:26] made over the past couple
[1:29] years. You have
[1:31] really given your
[1:33] church to something that maybe you
[1:36] didn't expect.
[1:39] And we are seeing the benefits of your
[1:44] sacrifices in all of these souls that
[1:47] are coming to the Lord
[1:48] Jesus. But we all had to give. And I
[1:52] stand here as as a new pastor and one
[1:55] that you wholeheartedly accepted in
[1:58] me. And I say thank you. And these souls
[2:04] will be attached to each one of you.
[2:07] Each one of you elders that were here,
[2:09] Brother Ron and the Petersons and the
[2:11] Garas and and all of you that have so
[2:14] freely given these souls will be
[2:17] attached to you all. I believe with all
[2:19] of my heart. I I just I'm taken back to
[2:24] see what the Lord's doing and he's he's
[2:26] just doing just great great
[2:29] things. Let's all stand and I'd like to
[2:32] read a scripture to start. Uh, I'm sorry

[2:40] 5 and let's start with verse
[2:44] 14. Ephesians 5
[2:54] verse14. And it reads like
[2:59] this. Are we gonna Oh, I didn't see it
[3:02] down here. Wherefore he saith, Awake
[3:06] thou that sleepeth, and arise from the
[3:08] dead, and Christ shall give thee light.
[3:11] See then that ye walk circumspectly, not
[3:14] as fools, but as wise, redeeming the
[3:17] time, because the days are
[3:20] evil. Wherefore be ye not unwise, but
[3:24] understanding what the will of the Lord
[3:26] is. And be not drunk with wine wherein
[3:29] is excess, but be filled with the
[3:32] spirit, speaking to yourselves in psalms
[3:35] and
[3:36] hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and
[3:39] making melody in your heart to the Lord,
[3:42] giving thanks always for the things unto
[3:45] God and the Father, in the name of our

[16:10] I there's a song that I that I like and
[16:13] I'm just going to read a few
[16:16] words. Consider the
[16:19] lilies. They don't toil nor
[16:23] spin. And there are there's not a
[16:27] kingdom more than splendor than
[16:31] them. Consider the
[16:34] sparrows. They
[16:36] don't plant nor
[16:40] sew, but they're fed by the
[16:43] master who watches them
[16:47] grow. And this is the time when I hear
[16:50] in the morning, and I think a lot of you
[16:53] too, the birds
[16:56] are
[16:58] singing. And if they are singing, why
[17:01] not me too?
[17:05] God bless you all.
[17:07] [Applause]
[17:15] Sister Amelia, do you have a song? You
[17:17] have a song.
[17:19] Daniel, stay down there for Sister
[17:22] Amelia. She's gonna sing, too.
[17:50] God bless you
[17:52] all. He'll be okay.
[17:56] [Music]
[18:07] I'm looking for a city, the one I made
[18:12] by hand. I'm looking over Jordan. I see
[18:17] the promised land. The waters will be
[18:21] parted and I'll be on my way. As we're
[18:25] crossing over Jordan, I can
[18:29] say now I have
[18:33] that everlasting joy
[18:36] within. Since he came and took away my
[18:41] sin, the moment that he blessed me, he
[18:46] made me fully whole with that
[18:49] everlasting joy within my soul.
[18:54] I'm drinking from the fountain that
[18:57] flowth from on high. A well blessed
[19:01] waters that never shall run dry. I'm
[19:06] feasting on God's banner. I'm praying
[19:09] day by day and that everlasting joy to
[19:14] stay.
[19:17] Now I have got everlasting joy with him.
[19:23] Since he came and took away my sin. The
[19:28] moment that he blessed me, he made me
[19:32] fully whole. With that everlasting joy
[19:36] within my
[19:38] soul. I've heard the prophet's message.
[19:42] I placed it in my heart. of God. The
[19:47] revelation that never shall depart. The
[19:51] rapture is upon us. The stage is set to
[19:55] go. We have this precious promise we all
[20:01] know. Now I have that
[20:06] everlasting joy with
[20:08] him since he came and took away my sin.
[20:14] moment that he blessed me. He made me
[20:18] fully whole with that everlasting joy
[20:22] within my
[20:28] [Applause]
[20:33] soul. Wonderful.
[20:37] I uh sometimes wake up in the middle of
[20:39] the night and a song hits me that I
[20:40] haven't heard in
[20:42] like 15 years, which is most of my
[20:46] life. And uh I write it down and I'm
[20:49] like, we're going to sing that one. And
[20:51] it's songs like that that heard in so
[20:54] long that now I'm going to sing that a
[20:57] couple Sundays from
[20:58] now. And this is one. Isn't he
[21:01] wonderful? Isn't he wonderful?
[21:04] eyes have seen.
[21:07] Isn't
[21:11] he
[21:13] wonderful? Isn't she my
[21:20] Lord? Eyes have seen, ears have
[21:28] heard. Jesus my Lord.
[21:33] Oh, let's sing
[21:37] it. Oh,
[21:39] wonderful,
[21:41] wonderful isn't
[21:46] she?
[21:48] Oh,

[22:02] Wonder isn't he?
[22:06] Wonderful.
[22:08] Wonderful.
[22:09] Wonderful. Isn't Jesus my Lord?
[22:16] Wonderful. Eyes have seen, ears have
[22:20] heard. What's recorded in God's word?
[22:25] Isn't Jesus my Lord? Wonderful. One more
[22:31] time. Isn't he
[22:34] wonderful?
[22:38] Wonderful. Isn't Jesus my Lord?
[22:44] Wonderful. Eyes have seen, ears have
[22:48] heard. What's real in God's word? Is in
[22:54] Jesus my Lord. Wonderful.
[22:58] [Music]
[23:22] [Music]
[23:34] I searched and I searched for the road
[23:38] that leads to glory. I wondered if I'd
[23:42] ever find the
[23:45] way. I sat down to rest. for my feet had
[23:50] grown so weary. But then I heard a voice
[23:54] within me
[23:56] say, "You've got to keep on walking.
[24:00] Just keep right on walking. Walking in
[24:05] the light of the Lord.
[24:09] You'll get to heaven someday if you walk
[24:14] the right way. Walking in the light of
[24:18] the
[24:20] Lord. I prayed and I prayed for the Lord
[24:25] to give me mercy. I pray for him to
[24:29] brighten up my way.
[24:33] I was so afraid for the road became so
[24:38] lonely. And then I heard a voice within
[24:42] me
[24:43] say, "You've got to keep walking. Just
[24:49] keep walking, walking in the light of
[24:54] the Lord.
[24:56] You'll get to heaven someday if you walk
[25:01] the right way. Walking in the light of
[25:05] the
[25:08] Lord. But after a while, I felt
[25:13] something got close. I stepped back up
[25:17] behind a great big column there and I
[25:19] said, "What would you have your children
[25:22] do?
[25:32] [Music]
[25:39] Oh,
[25:41] okay. What would you have your servant
[25:43] do? It kept
[25:45] going. I was real still a minute and I
[25:48] heard a deep voice say, "Turn. Go back."
[25:52] Well, I turned and went walking back
[25:54] down the street. I walked I walked on
[25:57] past the hotel on down through South
[25:59] Memphis. Just walking on and on. I was
[26:03] going walking along where I thought,
[26:05] Lord, I don't know. You said walk. Here
[26:08] I am. I'm walking. I just kept on
[26:12] walking, walking, walking. Walked out
[26:15] pretty near the other side of Memphis.
[26:21] You've got to keep on walking. Just keep
[26:26] right on
[26:27] walking. Walking in the light of the
[26:32] Lord, you'll get to heaven someday. If
[26:37] you walk the right way, walking in the
[26:41] light of the Lord. If you're walking in
[26:44] the light of the Lord, sing along.
[26:46] You've got to keep on walking. Just keep
[26:51] right on walking. Walking in the light
[26:55] of the
[26:57] Lord. You'll get to heaven someday. If
[27:01] you walk the right way, walking in the
[27:06] light of the Lord.
[27:09] [Music]
[27:16] You know that story,
[27:18] right? That story. There was a brother
[27:21] Brandham was late for a plane. He had to
[27:25] he had to be at the airport. He was in
[27:28] Memphis,
[27:29] Tennessee, and he went to he was looking
[27:32] at uh he was looking at some fishing uh
[27:35] equipment in a in a in a sporting goods
[27:38] store. So he was looking through the
[27:39] window and I there was a policeman there
[27:42] and he said, "Well, maybe I shouldn't be
[27:43] looking at that. They might think I'm
[27:45] going to try to steal something." So as
[27:47] he he started to walk away and as he he
[27:49] was walking away, the Lord told him,
[27:53] "Keep on walking." And brother Lyall
[27:55] gave the quote there, "Keep on walking."
[27:58] And he kept walking and he was walking
[28:01] and as as brother Lyall said, plum to
[28:03] the other side of Memphis. And when he
[28:06] got to this certain place, there's this
[28:11] black lady leaning on the edge of her
[28:15] fence. And she says, "Good morning,
[28:19] Parson." Brother Brandham looked at her,
[28:21] and Parson is an old word for preacher.
[28:24] Brother Brandham looked at her, he said,
[28:26] said, "How'd you know I was a preacher?"
[28:29] And she said, "I knew you were a
[28:30] preacher?" She said, "I knew you were
[28:32] coming."
[28:34] And he's and she said she said she had a
[28:37] dream last
[28:39] night that a minister would be coming by
[28:43] and her
[28:44] son was dying of a venerial
[28:49] disease. She said, "Would you come in?"
[28:51] And she said, she said, Parson, she
[28:53] said, would you just pray that he would
[28:56] give his heart to the Lord and then let
[28:58] him die in peace and and then then
[29:01] mama's heart would be okay with it? And
[29:04] he said, "Sister," he says, "I can't
[29:05] pray that that the Lord would just take
[29:07] him." So he gets over there and this
[29:11] this man he says a young man big strong
[29:14] man and he he was clutching his his
[29:18] blanket and he says mama it's dark in
[29:20] here. It's dark in this
[29:23] room. The man the young man was about to
[29:26] about to death and this is before we had
[29:29] the antibiotics that we have today.
[29:32] Brother Brandham walked in and she said,
[29:36] "Would you pray?" He walked in, he
[29:38] looked and he there was a sign on the
[29:41] wall that said, "God bless our home."
[29:44] And he said, "I walked in there and he
[29:46] says, "I've been to many, many
[29:47] churches." And he says, "I've been to
[29:49] churches that I didn't feel as
[29:50] comfortable as I felt when I walked into
[29:52] that house. I saw that sign said, "God
[29:54] bless our home." And he said, he called
[29:58] her auntie. He said, "Auntie," he said,
[30:00] "Would you
[30:02] pray?" And the mama prayed over her
[30:06] baby. And her her little baby boy, she
[30:08] called him mama's
[30:11] baby. And brother Brandham said
[30:14] that they're always mama's baby, no
[30:17] matter how old they
[30:18] get. And she she prayed over her son.
[30:24] And then brother Brandham said, "You can
[30:26] tell that that woman had prayed before."
[30:30] And then afterwards, Brother Brandham
[30:32] said, "Well, it'd be okay if I prayed."
[30:34] And and she said, "Yes." And Brother
[30:37] Brandham made a simple prayer over the
[30:40] boy. And he was going, "Oh, oh, it's
[30:44] dark." And then he said, "Mama," he
[30:47] said, "It's getting light in the room.
[30:50] It's getting light in the room." And
[30:52] then the Lord stepped in and the the boy
[30:56] was completely healed. And brother
[30:58] Brandham ended up seeing him years
[31:00] later. He had a job and he was working
[31:02] at the train station. Brother Brandham
[31:03] was taking a a train somewhere and and
[31:06] this young man walked up and said,
[31:08] "Parson Brandom, Parson Brandon." He
[31:10] said, "Do you remember me?" He says, "I
[31:11] don't remember you." He says, "I'm the
[31:13] one that you prayed for here in
[31:15] Memphis." And he said, "Are you that
[31:16] boy?" He said, "You're not that boy." He
[31:18] says, "Yes, I is." And the Lord healed
[31:20] me. and he says, "And now I'm a
[31:22] Christian." And it just that's that's
[31:24] the story that our brother Lio and
[31:26] sister Heather sang about. And what a
[31:29] tremendous testimony that is. I was just
[31:32] thinking as our brother here, Brother
[31:35] Johnny, Brother Manny shared with me his
[31:41] testimony, and it's one of the most
[31:43] powerful testimonies. It's similar to
[31:45] what I I just said. It's a just it is
[31:51] there's nothing that you can explain it
[31:53] other than this was a living Jesus
[31:57] Christ that healed this man that stepped
[32:00] on the scene with this man. We all have
[32:03] a testimony and friends we should all be
[32:06] willing to to share our testimonies.
[32:08] When the apostle Paul came to ki to king
[32:11] agrippa the man that could save him and
[32:15] he gives a testim and and agrippa asks
[32:19] him about this what does Paul do about
[32:21] this Christianity and all this Paul
[32:23] gives his
[32:24] testimony because that's the most
[32:26] powerful thing that he could have done
[32:29] and agrippa said Paul he says you almost
[32:33] convinced me to believe on this Jesus
[32:35] Christ from that testimony that you said
[32:37] and he said a grippa he said I would
[32:39] that you were like me except without
[32:41] these
[32:42] bonds he wanted the
[32:46] king to have the same or the agrippa
[32:50] wasn't the king then but he wanted this
[32:51] man to have the same testimony that he
[32:54] had and Paul was no respector of persons
[32:56] he threw the net out and whoever would
[32:59] come in would you like to hear brother
[33:02] Johnny's testimony
[33:07] come on out, my friend. Come on up. He
[33:10] says, I've never done this
[33:12] before. He said, uh, I I I don't know
[33:15] what to do. And I said, brother, I said,
[33:18] just tell us what happened and and the
[33:21] Lord will be with you. And I said, you
[33:23] are going to be a blessing to these
[33:25] people here. Brother Johnny, if you come
[33:28] on out, my
[33:30] friend, speak right here.
[33:42] First of all, I just want to say thank
[33:44] you guys for letting me in and the Lord
[33:48] of the
[33:49] house. One thing I can say, he is a
[33:53] miracle.
[33:59] I'm sorry, but I always believe whenever
[34:04] you have something wrong, always believe
[34:07] that he's going to be there no matter
[34:10] what. My life changed back in
[34:15] 2009 when they told me I was going to
[34:19] die.
[34:21] I needed a liver and a kidney
[34:26] transplant. I didn't believe in anything
[34:29] like
[34:32] that. You always got to have faith no
[34:34] matter
[34:36] what. When I heard the word that I was
[34:39] going to die, I walked out of the
[34:42] hospital. I didn't believe that it was
[34:45] going to happen to
[34:47] me and eventually end up going back. And
[34:51] that was
[34:52] it. I landed in a
[34:55] coma. I was in the hospital almost a
[35:00] year. I was dying. I had to be on the
[35:05] list to get a to be a donor. And I
[35:09] wasn't on the list at
[35:11] all. So my only hope was to
[35:15] die. That's it.
[35:21] But I kept my
[35:23] faith because when you believe in
[35:26] something, it will happen.
[35:29] And when I heard that I was going to die
[35:32] and I live needed a liver and a kidney
[35:35] transplant, my life was over. I didn't
[35:38] know what to do. But I kept praying when
[35:41] I was in laying in bed praying and
[35:45] praying and praying.
[35:47] I literally had blood coming coming out
[35:50] of my eyes. I was done. There was no
[35:54] hope for
[35:57] me. But I kept
[35:59] praying until one night. I was
[36:04] asleep. I had my eyes closed. And I
[36:07] always remember I saw three
[36:13] white dresses or whatever you want to
[36:16] call. It was one man in the middle and
[36:21] two angels on the
[36:25] side. All I felt was them touching my
[36:29] feet, calling my name.
[36:35] I woke up. It was a doctor and two
[36:38] ladies standing in white
[36:41] uniforms. The first thing they came out
[36:44] of the mouth, you got a
[36:47] miracle. And I just said,
[36:49] "What? I don't know what happened, but
[36:53] you went on the list. You got a liver
[36:56] and a kidney
[36:58] transplant. I don't know how it
[37:00] happened for her.
[37:03] why it happened. But there's other
[37:05] people here that needs what you need. I
[37:10] was telling them, I don't need it. Give
[37:12] it to somebody
[37:14] else. But for some reason, I had died in
[37:17] the hospital. One, once,
[37:23] twice, four
[37:24] times. I died seven
[37:29] times. And this is the first time I ever
[37:32] did a testimony to
[37:35] people because I
[37:37] believe no matter what we go through or
[37:41] what we were going through, there's
[37:43] always somebody out there that if you
[37:47] believe, he will be there for you.
[37:52] One thing, you got to love each other no
[37:54] matter what.
[37:57] I never used to be a man that believe in
[38:01] Christ or in the Lord until all this
[38:05] happened to
[38:06] me. But now it's
[38:09] different. I'm
[38:11] humble. I know what it takes to live and
[38:15] to learn how to love people.
[38:18] Now, the Lord has me here for a reason.
[38:21] I don't know what reason it is, but I'm
[38:25] happy to be here with you all and I'm
[38:29] happy to see you guys all
[38:32] here. But one thing is, God is a
[38:36] miracle. And I just want to say that no
[38:41] matter what we go through, keep going,
[38:43] keep pushing, cuz I wanted to get up and
[38:47] leave. But seven times
[38:52] I never met nobody that the Lord said
[38:55] seven times and I'm one of
[39:00] them. And I believe that he can do
[39:04] miracles because there was a medicine
[39:08] that first came out and they use me as a
[39:13] guinea
[39:13] pig to try that
[39:16] medicine. And that medicine was supposed
[39:19] to cure people in 12
[39:22] months. And I got the medicine. And
[39:26] there was another guy that got the
[39:28] medicine just like me. But there was a
[39:31] difference between me and him. He never
[39:34] believed in the Lord and I did. Amen.
[39:39] And I hate to say
[39:41] it, the medicine didn't help him, but it
[39:46] cured me in six months.
[39:49] Wow. Praise God. That's why I believe in
[39:53] the Lord always.
[39:56] I don't care what
[39:58] happens, but there's always somebody out
[40:01] there that can lift your heart and your
[40:04] spirit up. No matter who it is, no
[40:07] matter what kind of day we're having, if
[40:11] you're solo, married couple, always talk
[40:15] to each other because you never know
[40:19] when it's going to be your last day. But
[40:22] it turns out we have to enjoy one
[40:26] another no matter how mad we are at each
[40:29] other. Cuz right now I'mma learn I'm
[40:33] lonely but I'm happy. I have
[40:37] childrens but I'm blessed to be here to
[40:41] testimony my story to let you guys
[40:45] know no matter what we go through always
[40:48] have faith.
[40:51] always for me to be here and die seven
[40:55] times. He has me here for a reason.
[40:59] Maybe this is one of them.
[41:02] And I'm happy to be here with you all.
[41:05] Even though I don't know you all, but my
[41:09] heart and my love and respect will
[41:11] always go to each one of you.
[41:15] And the Lord keep blessing you guys all
[41:18] and your family and and keep us going in
[41:23] life no matter what we go
[41:25] through. And I thank you all for your
[41:29] time and moment for me to be up here to
[41:33] say this
[41:35] testimony cuz God is real.
[41:39] I know.
[41:42] just want you to be here right now
[41:45] talking to you guys. It's been 16 years
[41:50] I've been here. It happened 16 years ago
[41:54] and I'm still here. Cuz why I believe in
[41:58] the Lord. Amen. He's got me here for a
[42:02] reason. Not only me, he gots us all here
[42:06] for a reason.
[42:08] And that reason we don't know but we're
[42:11] here. Praise God. And one
[42:16] thing always have faith no matter what.
[42:19] And I thank you guys all for your time
[42:22] and effort and always have faith and
[42:26] always believe that he's a miracle and
[42:30] always will be a miracle to each and one
[42:32] of
[42:34] us. I thank you guys all.
[42:49] Praise God. What a wonderful testimony.
[42:51] Let's give the Lord another hand clap of
[42:58] praise. We're going to sing He Leadth
[43:01] Me, Oh Blessed Thought.
[43:06] These are powerful words right here.
[43:08] Song was wrote almost 200 years ago.
[43:11] Almost 300 years ago,
[43:13] sorry. He
[43:15] leadth me, oh
[43:19] blessed thought, oh words with
[43:25] heavenly comfort.
[43:30] What hair I do,
[43:34] wherever I
[43:37] be, still is God hand that
[43:43] leadth
[43:46] me. He
[43:48] leadth me. He
[43:52] leadth
[43:53] me. By his own hand he
[43:58] leadth
[44:01] me. His
[44:04] faithful
[44:05] follower I would be. And by his hand he
[44:13] lead. Sometimes
[44:16] mid-cenes.
[44:18] Sometimes
[44:20] midcenes of deepest gloom.
[44:25] Sometimes where
[44:27] Eden's flowers
[44:31] bloom by water still or trbled
[44:39] sea stilt is his hand that
[44:45] leadth
[44:47] me. Oh he
[44:50] leadth me. He
[44:53] leadth me by his own hand. He leadth
[45:02] me. His
[45:05] faithful follower I would be. For by his
[45:12] hand he
[45:14] leaded. Lord I would
[45:17] clasp. Lord I would clasp. thy hand in
[45:23] mine, nor
[45:26] ever
[45:27] murmur or
[45:31] pine.
[45:33] Content
[45:35] whatever lot I
[45:39] see
[45:41] since my God that leadth me. Praise the
[45:47] Lord. He
[45:49] leadth me. He leadth me by his own hand.
[45:58] He leadth
[46:02] me. His
[46:04] faithful follower I would be. For by his
[46:11] hand ye. Last verse.
[46:17] And when my task on earth is done, when
[46:24] by thy grace the
[46:28] victories won. Hallelujah. In death's
[46:33] cold wave. I will not
[46:38] flee since God through
[46:43] Jordan. Oh hallelujah. He leadeth me.
[46:46] Oh, he leadeth me. He leadth me. By his
[46:55] own hand he leadth
[47:00] me. His
[47:02] faithful
[47:04] follower I would
[47:07] be. By his hand he
[47:12] leadth me. Sister Hope, if you'd come
[47:16] up. He
[47:18] leadth me. He leadth me by his own hand.
[47:27] He leadth
[47:31] me. His
[47:33] faithful follower I would be. For by his
[47:41] hand he
[47:43] leadth me.
[48:13] [Music]
[48:22] Hear the Lord of harvest sweetly
[48:27] calling. Sing it with
[48:29] me. Who will go and work for me today?
[48:38] Who will bring to me the lost and
[48:45] dying? Who will point them to the narrow
[48:51] way? Speak my
[48:55] Lord. Speak my
[49:00] Lord. Speak and I'll be quick to answer
[49:05] thee.
[49:08] Speak my
[49:11] Lord. Speak my
[49:16] Lord. Speak and I will answer. Lord,
[49:21] send me.
[49:27] In the cold of fire touch the
[49:32] prophet, making him as pure as pure can
[49:40] be. When the voice of God said, "He'll
[49:44] go for
[49:47] us." Then he answered, "Here am I. Send
[49:52] me.
[49:55] Speak my
[49:58] Lord. Speak my
[50:02] Lord. Speak and I'll be quick to answer
[50:09] thee. Speak my
[50:13] Lord. Speak my
[50:18] Lord. Speak and I will answer. Lord send
[50:27] me. Millions now in sin and shame are
[50:34] dying. Listen to their sad and bitter
[50:41] cries. Hasten brother, hasten to their
[50:46] rescue.
[50:50] Quake answer. Here am I. Send
[50:56] me. Speak my
[50:59] Lord. Speak my
[51:04] Lord. Speak and I'll be quick to answer
[51:11] thee. Speak my
[51:15] Lord. Speak my Lord.
[51:21] Speak and I will answer. Lord, send
[51:29] me. Soon the time for reaping will be
[51:36] over. Soon we'll gather for our harvest.
[51:45] May the Lord of harvest smile upon
[51:51] us. May we hear his blessed child
[51:58] will speak my
[52:02] m. Speak my
[52:07] word. Speak and I'll be quick to answer
[52:12] thee.
[52:14] Speak my
[52:17] Lord. Speak my
[52:22] Lord. Speak and I will answer. Lord,
[52:28] send
[52:28] [Music]
[52:31] me. Speak and I will answer. Lord, send
[52:36] me.
[52:39] [Music]
[52:42] [Applause]
[52:47] Amen. Can I give a part
[52:51] two? After brother Brandham had left
[52:54] that house in West
[52:57] Memphis, he was hours late for his
[53:01] airplane and he was able to get back to
[53:03] the airport. And right when he walked
[53:05] into the airport, he had his bag and he
[53:07] was going to go talk to whoever it would
[53:09] be to see if he could get a flight um
[53:11] the next flight out. And he heard over
[53:14] the loudspeaker last call for Brandom
[53:16] that the flight was leaving. The flight
[53:19] was delayed. God had delayed the flight
[53:22] long enough for him to go and visit that
[53:24] lady, pray for her son. He was healed in
[53:28] the name of Jesus and God grounded the
[53:30] flight until brother Brandham could come
[53:32] back. Part part
[53:36] two. Johnny's a humble man. Brother
[53:40] Johnny, thank you my friend for giving
[53:42] that I mean died on the bed seven
[53:45] times. Brother Manny was there. I mean,
[53:49] and how could this man have ever
[53:51] survived? And then at the very lowest of
[53:54] the low, as his life was leaving him for
[53:58] the final time, they were able to find a
[54:02] donor for a kidney, for a
[54:06] liver. What he didn't tell us, and as he
[54:11] stood up here telling me the story, you
[54:14] noticed that I talked to him for a
[54:16] little bit afterwards.
[54:19] earlier. How many was it? Years earlier,
[54:22] Johnny. Years
[54:24] earlier. Were you driving or were you
[54:26] walking?
[54:33] Is so he was dry driving and he sees two
[54:40] prostitutes and they're being
[54:42] assaulted by how many men? By a man.
[54:48] Johnny didn't like what he was
[54:51] seeing. So, he gets out and he defends
[54:54] these prostitutes. He defends these
[54:56] women. Didn't matter how low they were.
[54:58] Didn't matter who they were. Didn't
[55:00] matter that they were they were maybe
[55:02] drug addicts or or whatever they were
[55:04] obviously doing about the this
[55:06] profession that's that's a a shameful
[55:09] profession. But Johnny goes and he risks
[55:12] his life to protect these two women.
[55:17] The doctors told him, these two
[55:19] prostitutes, the doctors told
[55:22] him, the people, the woman that gave you
[55:27] your liver, remember, he wasn't even on
[55:30] the list. The woman that gave you your
[55:33] liver and your kidney was a
[55:36] prostitute. Brother Johnny thinks it
[55:38] might even be the same one that he
[55:40] protected. So, there's a part two to
[55:42] that story, my friend. Brother Johnny,
[55:44] we want to see more of you, brother. You
[55:46] got the sweetest spirit. And we just
[55:48] It's that testimony. It gave me
[55:50] strength. God is here. He's alive. And
[55:52] he still does miracles. Amen. Praise
[55:56] Praise God, Brother
[56:02] Josiah. We're going to sing uh well,
[56:04] with a little bit of help, if Katie's
[56:07] siblings want to come forward, we're
[56:09] going to sing Through the Fire. I think
[56:11] it's fitting for that testimony.
[56:14] Come on up,
[56:16] Nathaniel. These are Katie's little
[56:18] siblings. That's Lydia. That's Rachel.
[56:20] That's
[56:21] Nathaniel. And if you have, we have the
[56:24] words to Through the Fire. Could you put
[56:25] them up on the screen and you can all
[56:28] sing with us?
[56:43] [Music]
[56:55] So many times I've
[56:58] questioned certain
[57:01] circumstances and things I could not
[57:05] understand.
[57:10] Many times in
[57:12] trials, weakness blurs my
[57:16] vision. My frustration gets so out of
[57:22] hand. It's then I am
[57:26] reminded I've never been
[57:29] forsaken. I've never had to stand the
[57:33] test
[57:36] alone. And as I look at all the
[57:40] victories, spirit rises up in me. It's
[57:44] through the fire my weakness is made
[57:51] strong. He never promised that the cross
[57:55] would not get heavy or the hill would
[57:59] not be hard to climb.
[58:06] He never
[58:07] offered our victories without fighting.
[58:11] But he said help would always come in
[58:15] time.
[58:18] Just remember when you're standing in
[58:22] the valley of
[58:24] decision and the adversary says
[58:30] heaven, just hold
[58:33] on. Our Lord will show
[58:37] up and he will take you through the
[58:41] fire. He never promised.
[58:46] He never promised that the cross would
[58:50] not get heavy and the hill would not get
[58:54] hard to climb.
[58:57] [Music]
[59:00] He never
[59:01] offered our victories without fighting.
[59:05] But he said help would always come in
[59:09] time. Just
[59:11] remember, just remember when you're
[59:14] standing in the valley of
[59:18] decision and the adversary says, "Give
[59:23] in." Just hold
[59:27] on. Our Lord will show
[59:30] up and he will take you through the fire
[59:36] again. And I know it in myself.
[59:40] I know within myself that I would surely
[59:45] perish. But if I trust the hand of God,
[59:49] he'll shield the flames
[59:53] again.
[59:57] Again, he never promised that the cross
[1:00:01] would not get heavy and the hill would
[1:00:05] not be hard to climb.
[1:00:10] time. He never offered our victims
[1:00:14] without fighting. But he said help would
[1:00:18] always come in
[1:00:21] time. So just remember when you're
[1:00:25] standing in the valley of
[1:00:29] decision and the adversary says give in.
[1:00:35] Just hold
[1:00:38] on. Our Lord will show
[1:00:41] up and he will take you through the fire
[1:00:46] again. Just
[1:00:48] remember. So just remember when you're
[1:00:51] standing in the valley of decision and
[1:00:56] the adversary says give in.
[1:01:01] Just hold
[1:01:04] on. Our Lord will show up
[1:01:08] and he will take you through the fire
[1:01:12] again.
[1:01:18] [Music]
[1:01:26] Again, we're gonna have brother Michael
[1:01:28] and sister Naomi sing now.
[1:01:37] Let's just sing a song ac cappella just
[1:01:40] a chorus as they're coming up.
[1:01:42] At the cross. At the cross. Where I
[1:01:47] first saw
[1:01:53] the
[1:02:09] heart. I am happy.
[1:02:13] Let's sing that again. At the cross.
[1:02:21] [Music]
[1:02:26] My
[1:02:32] [Music]
[1:02:36] heart received.
[1:02:43] [Music]
[1:02:49] [Music]
[1:02:56] Oh, I was a warm green soul traveling a
[1:03:03] wellworn
[1:03:05] road so far from home with no second
[1:03:11] chance.
[1:03:14] When I heard you call my name, I felt
[1:03:19] you lift my shame. And I made a vow that
[1:03:26] day that I'd spend the rest of my life
[1:03:31] loving my
[1:03:34] Jesus, showing my
[1:03:38] scars, telling my story and how
[1:03:43] mercy can reach you where you are. And I
[1:03:48] pray the whole world hears the cry of my
[1:03:54] heart. Is to see all the ones I love.
[1:04:00] Loving my
[1:04:06] Jesus. Sin tries to make you hide.
[1:04:12] whispers and
[1:04:14] save life. Keep all your pain
[1:04:19] inside. No one
[1:04:21] will understand the last thing this lost
[1:04:26] world needs. Someone I'm trying to be.
[1:04:31] The truth that has set me free. Is it
[1:04:36] I'm just a
[1:04:37] bro. Amen. Loving my
[1:04:42] Jesus, showing my
[1:04:46] scars, it's telling my
[1:04:49] story. How
[1:04:51] mercy can reach you where you are. And I
[1:04:55] pray the whole world hears the cry of my
[1:05:00] heart.
[1:05:02] to see all the ones I love. Loving my
[1:05:08] Jesus.
[1:05:14] And when all is said and done, when my
[1:05:19] last song's been sung, I'll stand face

[1:05:28] all for me. May all I have to show be
[1:05:34] see all that
[1:05:36] mattered most keeping your great

[1:05:56] telling my story of how
[1:05:59] mercy can reach you where you are. And I
[1:06:04] pray the whole world hears the cry of my
[1:06:09] heart is to see all the ones I love. All
[1:06:15] the ones I love loving my Jesus.

[1:07:28] So I'mma keep on
[1:07:31] singing till my soul catches up with my
[1:07:36] song. There's times when my hands go off
[1:07:40] freely and times that it

[1:08:52] light. This trouble keeps me
[1:08:56] honest, and it breaks down the walls of
[1:09:00] my
[1:09:01] pride. Cuz faith isn't proving like
[1:09:05] gold.

[1:10:21] awesome? Lydia and Katie will be next.
[1:10:24] Lydia Peterson, you don't have to
[1:10:26] worry. Come on
[1:10:29] up. as she's coming. Um, let's sing. You
[1:10:32] are my refuge. Just one chorus of
[1:10:37] [Music]
[1:10:38] that. You are my
[1:10:42] refuge. You are my
[1:10:47] sanuary when I feel
[1:10:51] afraid. You're my hiding place. You are
[1:10:56] my refuge.
[1:10:59] And when the storm is
[1:11:03] raging underneath your
[1:11:07] wings, I rejoice and sing. You are my
[1:11:13] [Music]
[1:11:16] refuge. Let's give a hand for these new
[1:11:18] piano players we've had. Camila and
[1:11:21] Lydia stepping up and playing the piano.
[1:11:31] [Music]
[1:11:43] A name was being high upon a
[1:11:48] throne with a kingom and a crown. All is
[1:11:55] low.
[1:11:58] Unmoved by the sorrow that we bear.
[1:12:03] That's not the God I
[1:12:10] know. Unable to be touched by all the
[1:12:16] needs of those crying out to him down on
[1:12:22] their knees.
[1:12:24] Not hearing or answering a
[1:12:28] prayer. That's not the
[1:12:31] God I know.
[1:12:36] The one I know will
[1:12:39] go to the darkest
[1:12:42] place to reach you.
[1:12:47] No matter how
[1:12:50] far you'll come to where you
[1:12:53] are to
[1:12:57] [Music]
[1:13:00] meet the one I know will
[1:13:04] stay when others go
[1:13:07] away and leave
[1:13:10] [Music]
[1:13:14] you. If you think that God is far away
[1:13:18] and cold, that's not the
[1:13:22] God I
[1:13:27] know. Seen me so lost without a hope. He
[1:13:33] left the
[1:13:34] 99 safe in the fold to search until he
[1:13:42] found and brought me home.
[1:13:45] Yes, that's the God I
[1:13:53] know. The one I know will
[1:13:56] go to the darkest place to reach you. No
[1:14:04] matter how
[1:14:05] far, he'll come to where you are to meet
[1:14:13] [Music]
[1:14:16] you. The one I know will
[1:14:19] stay when others go
[1:14:23] away and leave
[1:14:29] you. If you think that God is far away
[1:14:34] and cold, that's not the God I
[1:14:43] know. He left the 99 safe in the
[1:14:50] fold to search until he found and
[1:14:54] brought me home.
[1:14:57] Yes, that's the God I
[1:15:02] [Music]
[1:15:13] [Applause]
[1:15:21] know. We have one more song, uh, one
[1:15:24] more special tonight. But before we have
[1:15:26] sister Jessica come, let's all stand and
[1:15:29] let's sing when he reached down his hand
[1:15:30] for me. Let's do let's do
[1:15:35] G. Once my soul was astray. Let's start
[1:15:38] with that first
[1:15:38] [Music]
[1:15:50] verse. Once my
[1:15:53] soul was
[1:15:55] astray from the
[1:15:58] heavenly
[1:16:00] way and was
[1:16:02] wretched and
[1:16:05] vile as could be.
[1:16:10] But my
[1:16:12] Savior
[1:16:14] above gave me
[1:16:16] peace, joy, and
[1:16:19] love when he
[1:16:21] reached down his
[1:16:23] hand for
[1:16:27] me. Well, when he
[1:16:30] reached down his
[1:16:33] hand for
[1:16:36] me. Well, when he
[1:16:40] reached down his
[1:16:42] hand for
[1:16:46] me. Oh, I was lost and
[1:16:51] undone without
[1:16:53] God or his
[1:16:56] son when he
[1:16:58] reached down his hand. For I was nearing
[1:17:02] despair.
[1:17:05] Oh, I was
[1:17:07] nearing
[1:17:09] despair when he came to me
[1:17:14] there and he
[1:17:16] showed me that
[1:17:18] I could be
[1:17:23] free. Then he
[1:17:26] lifted my
[1:17:27] feet, gave me
[1:17:30] gloryy
[1:17:32] complete. when he reached out his hand
[1:17:37] for
[1:17:40] me. Oh, when he
[1:17:43] reached down his
[1:17:45] hand for
[1:17:50] me. When he reached down his
[1:17:54] hand for me.
[1:17:59] Oh, I was lost and
[1:18:03] undone without
[1:18:05] God or his son when he reached down his
[1:18:12] hand for me. How my heart doth
[1:18:16] rejoice. How my
[1:18:18] heart doth
[1:18:21] rejoice since I made him my choice. from
[1:18:27] the
[1:18:28] tempest to
[1:18:30] him. Now I
[1:18:34] flee. Now I
[1:18:36] lean on his arm and I'm
[1:18:41] secure from all harm. Oh, since he
[1:18:45] reached down his
[1:18:48] hand for me.
[1:18:52] Oh, and he reached down his hand for
[1:19:00] me. Oh, and he reached way
[1:19:06] down for
[1:19:08] me. Oh, I was
[1:19:12] lost and
[1:19:14] undone without
[1:19:16] God or his
[1:19:18] son. when he reached down. Sister
[1:19:22] Jessica, if you'd come while we sing the
[1:19:24] last verse. Since the Lord gave me
[1:19:27] peace, and since the Lord gave me peace,
[1:19:32] heavenly
[1:19:34] joy never
[1:19:36] cease. Lord, I
[1:19:38] give all my
[1:19:40] life unto thee.
[1:19:46] Guide my feet and hold my hand. Grant
[1:19:50] with
[1:19:51] thee I may stand for you reached down
[1:19:57] your hand for me. One last time when he
[1:20:02] reached. Oh, and he reached down his
[1:20:07] hand for me.
[1:20:12] and he reached down his
[1:20:16] hand for
[1:20:20] me. I was lost and
[1:20:25] undone without
[1:20:27] God or his
[1:20:29] son when he
[1:20:31] reached down his
[1:20:34] hand for
[1:20:37] me. You can all have your seats. Sister
[1:20:40] Jessica
[1:20:50] [Music]
[1:21:12] I was raised on the old
[1:21:16] hymns. John
[1:21:19] 3:16 stained glass pictures of
[1:21:25] faith. A shepherd and a
[1:21:29] giant. Daniel and a lions.
[1:21:33] Three blue boys in the
[1:21:38] flames. A coat of many colors and the
[1:21:42] walls falling
[1:21:45] down. And the red sea becoming dry
[1:21:49] ground. I
[1:21:53] believe every line, every word I
[1:21:57] believe.
[1:21:59] Every story I've
[1:22:02] heard written on the pages is the truth
[1:22:06] of the ages and it's changing
[1:22:13] me. I
[1:22:19] believe it's wise men and
[1:22:23] angels, blind
[1:22:25] Bardameus, a thief and a traitor's
[1:22:31] kiss. A walk on the
[1:22:35] water, Gyrus's daughter, five loaves and
[1:22:40] two little fish.
[1:22:44] A lonely garden where Jesus
[1:22:49] prayed. Sunday morning when the stone
[1:22:53] rolled away I
[1:22:57] believe. Every line, every word I
[1:23:03] believe. Every story I've
[1:23:06] heard written on the pages is the truth
[1:23:10] of the ages. and it's changing
[1:23:17] me. I believe in the message of mercy
[1:23:21] and grace that tells of a savior who
[1:23:26] died in my
[1:23:28] [Music]
[1:23:31] place. I
[1:23:34] believe every line, every word. I
[1:23:40] believe every story I've
[1:23:43] heard written on the pages is the truth
[1:23:47] of the ages and it's changing
[1:23:53] me. I
[1:23:55] [Music]
[1:23:59] believe. I
[1:24:04] believe. I believe.
[1:24:08] [Music]
[1:24:16] Praise
[1:24:18] God. Something Brother Green said just
[1:24:21] flooded my mind as she was singing that.
[1:24:24] I didn't see uh Jesus heal Gyrus's
[1:24:28] daughter and I didn't see him walk on
[1:24:30] the water and I didn't see all those
[1:24:31] things, but I believe the witnesses that
[1:24:33] wrote it down and I give God praise for
[1:24:36] it. I feel like the devil's been trying
[1:24:38] to fight us tonight in this worship
[1:24:40] night. Don't you think so? He doesn't he
[1:24:42] doesn't want want us to be doing what
[1:24:44] we're doing. So let's stand to our feet
[1:24:46] one last time before brother Daniel
[1:24:49] closes and let's sing
[1:24:51] uh worthy worthy the lamb that was slain
[1:24:56] [Music]
[1:24:59] KBF. Hear the cries of the
[1:25:01] shackled. And let's just give him every
[1:25:05] last bit of worship, every last bit of
[1:25:07] praise that we got left in this last
[1:25:10] song. All the glory to Jesus. Let's do
[1:25:12] it tonight.
[1:25:17] Hear the
[1:25:19] cries of the
[1:25:22] shackle from the
[1:25:25] onset of
[1:25:27] time for the
[1:25:29] chains of defeat. There's no
[1:25:36] key. and see the
[1:25:39] tears of the
[1:25:42] broken, the
[1:25:44] cries of the
[1:25:46] slaves. Is there no
[1:25:49] one worthy to set us free? Then the
[1:25:54] crying was
[1:25:56] still. Then the
[1:25:59] crying is still. Hallelujah. As the
[1:26:03] chorus rings
[1:26:05] out, oh the
[1:26:08] shackled released from their
[1:26:13] chains, glory, oh and
[1:26:17] thousands of
[1:26:20] voices are

[1:26:24] song, singing worthy.

[1:27:06] lamb that was lame. Let's go to G. Then

[1:27:11] archangels. Then all the
[1:27:15] archangels and the saints of all
[1:27:20] times. Oh,
[1:27:22] holding their crowns in their hands.
[1:27:27] hand. Oh hallelujah. They fall
[1:27:31] down before
[1:27:34] him. Oh, join

[1:30:16] hast

[1:30:21] things
[1:30:23] created. Thou hast
[1:30:28] created all things.
[1:30:33] Oh, and for thy
[1:30:38] pleasure they are
[1:30:43] created.
[1:30:44] Thou art were thee, oh
[1:30:50] Lord. Praise the Lord, brother Dan.
[1:30:54] [Music]
[1:31:03] [Music]
[1:31:16] the the king
[1:31:20] David, a man after God's own heart.
[1:31:25] The ark of the covenant had been out of
[1:31:28] the
[1:31:30] city and the feeling just overwhelmed
[1:31:34] him as he walked before that ark and
[1:31:37] knowing that this was God's ark that he
[1:31:41] said that will go before the children of
[1:31:44] Israel. And as he brought this ark into
[1:31:48] Jerusalem, he shouted and he praised and
[1:31:53] he danced in front of the ark. And the
[1:31:56] joy just overflowed in David knowing
[1:31:59] that his redeemer lived and knowing that
[1:32:02] this gift had come into God's house once
[1:32:06] again. and we saw our brother and how
[1:32:09] much this gospel means to us that we can
[1:32:13] shout and we can praise and we can dance
[1:32:16] and we can sing softly and we can sing
[1:32:19] loudly and we can just give the Lord a
[1:32:23] heartfelt hallelujah. Lord, we love you
[1:32:26] and we thank
[1:32:27] you. Praise
[1:32:31] God. Let's let's sing it one more time.
[1:32:34] Let's sing this. Worthy is the lamb.
[1:32:36] brothers and sisters because he is
[1:32:39] worthy.
[1:32:41] If we could just know who he is. If we
[1:32:44] could just get to know him a little bit
[1:32:46] better, our better, our brother's
[1:32:48] testimony. God came down in that
[1:32:50] hospital room and delivered him from
[1:32:53] certain death so that he could give this
[1:32:56] testimony and he could say, "I am a
[1:32:58] witness that Jesus Christ is alive."
[1:33:01] Amen.
[1:33:03] And now we can sing, Lord, you are
[1:33:05] worthy. Worthy is the lamb. Let's sing
[1:33:08] it one more time. Brother Josiah, thou
[1:33:11] art
[1:33:13] worthy.
[1:33:15] Thou art
[1:33:18] worthy.
[1:33:20] Thou art
[1:33:22] worthy, oh
[1:33:26] Lord. Yes.
[1:33:29] to receive
[1:33:32] glory.
[1:33:34] Glory and
[1:33:37] honor,
[1:33:39] glory and
[1:33:41] honor and
[1:33:44] power.
[1:33:46] For thou hast
[1:33:50] created, hast all things created.
[1:33:57] Thou hast
[1:34:00] created all
[1:34:04] things. Yes. And for thy
[1:34:09] pleasure they are
[1:34:14] created.
[1:34:16] Thou art
[1:34:18] worthy, oh
[1:34:21] Lord. Now friends, before we
[1:34:24] leave,
[1:34:26] Always
[1:34:28] remember when we truly go to
[1:34:31] prayer, we are speaking to the Almighty
[1:34:34] God, the one that that heals, as the
[1:34:38] Bible said, all of our diseases. The one
[1:34:42] that died for our sins and the one that
[1:34:45] gave us eternal life. When when we pray,
[1:34:48] friends, don't take it for granted.
[1:34:51] Don't just bow your heads and and go
[1:34:53] through the motions. We are speaking to
[1:34:55] the almighty
