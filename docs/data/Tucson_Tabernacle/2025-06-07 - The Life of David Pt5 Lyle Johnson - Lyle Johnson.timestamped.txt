[0:00] [Music]
[0:04] Good evening. Let's stand and sing that
[0:06] song. For a long time I
[0:10] travel down a long lonely
[0:15] road. My heart was so heavy in sinners
[0:22] sink. Then I heard about Jesus.
[0:28] What a wonderful
[0:32] hour. I'm so glad that I found out he
[0:36] would bring me out through his saving
[0:41] power. Thank God I am free. Free. Free
[0:47] from this world of
[0:50] sin. Been washed in the blood of Jesus.
[0:55] I've been born again.
[1:00] Hallelujah. I'm saved. Saved. Saved by
[1:04] his wonderful
[1:08] grace. I'm so glad that I found out he
[1:12] would bring me out and show me the way.
[1:18] Like a bird out of
[1:22] prison that's taken his
[1:26] flight. Like a blind man that God gave
[1:31] back his
[1:33] sight. Like a poor wretching
[1:38] beggar who found fortune and
[1:43] fame. Well, I'm so glad that I found out
[1:47] he would bring me out through his holy
[1:52] name. Well, thank God I am free. Free.
[1:57] Free from this world of
[2:02] sin. Been washed in the blood of Jesus
[2:07] and been born
[2:08] [Applause]
[2:10] again. Hallelujah. I'm saved. Saved.
[2:15] Saved by his wonderful
[2:19] grace. I'm so glad that I found out he
[2:23] would bring me out and show me the
[2:28] way. Thank God I am free. Free. Free
[2:34] from this world of
[2:38] sin. Been washed in the blood of Jesus.
[2:42] I've been born
[2:43] [Applause]
[2:46] again. Hallelujah. I'm saved. Save. Save
[2:51] my wonderful
[2:55] grace. I'm so glad that I found out he
[2:59] would bring me out and show me the way.
[3:05] Oh, I'm so glad that I found out that he
[3:08] would bring me out and show me the
[3:15] way. Amen. Sing. He
[3:22] abides. Oh, I'm rejoicing night and day
[3:26] as I walk away for the hand of God. In
[3:32] all my life I
[3:34] see that the reason of my plans. Yes.
[3:39] The secret
[3:40] alles that the comforter abides with
[3:46] me. He
[3:49] abides. He
[3:53] abides. Halleluah. He abides with me.
[3:59] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[4:04] their way for the comfort of abide with
[4:10] me. Oh, once my heart was full of sin.
[4:15] Once I had no peace within till I heard
[4:19] Jesus died upon the tree.
[4:24] And I fell down at his feet and licked a
[4:28] peace so sweet. Now the comforter abides
[4:33] with
[4:35] me. Oh he
[4:38] abides. He
[4:41] abides. Halleluah. He abides with me.
[4:48] I'm rejoice in night and day as I walk
[4:52] the narrow way for the comforter abides
[4:57] with
[5:00] me. He is with me everywhere and he
[5:04] knows my every care. I'm as happy as a
[5:09] bird and just
[5:12] free. For the spirit has control. Jesus
[5:17] satisfies my soul. He'll comfort abides
[5:22] with
[5:24] me. Oh, he
[5:27] bids. He
[5:30] finds you. Halleluah. He bites with me.
[5:38] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[5:42] the way for the comforter confides with
[5:49] me. Oh, there's no thirsting for the
[5:52] things of the world. They've taken
[5:55] wings. Long ago I gave them up then
[6:01] instantly. And all my night was turned
[6:04] to day. All my burdens rolled away. Now
[6:09] the comforter abides with
[6:14] me. He
[6:16] abides. Oh, he
[6:20] abides. Halleluah. He abides with me.
[6:27] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[6:31] the narrow way for the comfort abides
[6:36] with
[6:40] me. Amen. You guys may be seated. Um
[6:43] let's sing I will bless thee, oh Lord.
[6:45] And then I believe Sister Hope has a
[6:47] song. Sing this one and then you can
[6:49] bring your special after that.
[6:55] I I will bless thee, oh
[7:01] Lord. I will bless thee, oh
[7:06] Lord, with the heart of
[7:12] thanksgiving. I will bless thee, oh
[7:15] Lord. Sing that verse again. I will
[7:18] bless thee, oh Lord.
[7:23] I will bless thee, oh
[7:27] Lord, with a heart of thanksgiving.
[7:33] I will bless thee, oh
[7:37] Lord, with my hands lifted
[7:42] up and my mouth filled with
[7:47] praise. With the heart of
[7:53] thanksgiving, I will bless thee, oh
[7:55] Lord.
[7:59] With my hands lifted
[8:03] up and my mouth filled with
[8:08] praise. With the heart of
[8:13] thanksgiving, I will bless thee, oh
[8:18] Lord. We will bless thee, oh
[8:23] Lord. We will bless thee, oh Lord.
[8:28] With the heart of
[8:32] thanksgiving, we will bless thee, oh
[8:35] Lord.
[8:38] And with my hands lifted
[8:42] up and my mouth filled with
[8:47] praise, with the heart of
[8:52] thanksgiving, I will bless thee, oh
[8:55] Lord.
[9:07] [Music]
[9:29] I
[9:31] drifted on the flight's many days. Okay,
[9:35] Sing it with
[9:37] me. He searched
[9:43] for various
[9:48] ways. Troules he had
[9:53] some but not from
[9:56] [Music]
[9:58] above. God gave him his
[10:03] son on the wings of the
[10:09] dove. On the wings of the
[10:12] snow, white dove, God sends his pure,
[10:18] sweet love, a sign from
[10:24] above on the wings of the earth.
[10:28] [Music]
[10:31] Jesus our
[10:35] savior came to earth one day.
[10:41] He was born in a
[10:42] [Music]
[10:45] stable in a manger of
[10:50] h though he
[10:55] rejected but not from
[11:00] above. God gave us his
[11:05] son. On the wings of the
[11:10] letter, on the wings of the
[11:13] snow, white dove, God sends his pure,
[11:19] sweet love, a sign from
[11:25] above on the wings of the dove.
[11:32] Though I have
[11:35] suffered in many
[11:40] ways, I cried for
[11:45] healing. Both night and day.
[11:51] Faith wasn't
[11:55] forgotten by the father
[12:00] above. He gave me his
[12:05] son. On the wings of the
[12:10] t. On the wings of the
[12:13] snow, white earth, God sends his pure,
[12:19] sweet love, a sign from
[12:25] above on the wings of a dove.
[12:31] Though the prophet has left
[12:35] us, he showed us the
[12:39] way. He said, "Go unto
[12:44] Jesus from day to day."
[12:51] For he has
[12:54] proised from the depths of his
[12:59] love. He'd send down his
[13:02] [Music]
[13:04] sunlight on the wings of the
[13:08] earth. On the wings of the
[13:11] snow white dove, God sends his pure
[13:17] sweet love. A sign from
[13:22] [Music]
[13:23] above on the wings of the
[13:28] [Music]
[13:35] earth. Amen. I was
[13:40] debating and I uh like usual I came to
[13:43] the wrong conclusion. I uh saying,
[13:46] "Lord, do you want me to give this
[13:48] testimony or not?" And uh I decided
[13:52] not. Obviously, I'm going
[13:56] to because Sister Hope sang that
[14:00] song. That song is um special. So I've
[14:04] given the testimony many times about how
[14:07] brother Brandham told my dad that he had
[14:12] there was a popular song on the radio by
[14:15] a country music singer named Ferlin
[14:17] Husky and named On the Wings of a Snow
[14:20] White
[14:21] Dove. And uh he asked my my dad, my
[14:25] grandfather, he said, "Have you ever
[14:27] heard that song on the radio by Ferland
[14:29] Husky called On the Wings of a Snow
[14:31] Whiteeyed Dove?" They said, "Yeah." He
[14:32] said, "I have a message I want to
[14:35] preach." And he said, "I want to title
[14:37] it on the wings of a snow white dove."
[14:39] Now, this happened in
[14:40] 1961 that he told my dad this. He said,
[14:46] "I have a message that I want to preach
[14:48] and I want to name it on the wings of a
[14:50] snow white dove." And when you hear that
[14:55] sermon, you know, you'll know it's my
[14:57] time to
[14:58] go. And as I've said, I've given that
[15:01] testimony be here here a number of
[15:03] times. And um he preached that sermon
[15:07] November the end of November
[15:10] 1965. And within within 30 days, brother
[15:13] Brandham had gone to be with the
[15:15] Lord.
[15:17] Um the testimony I wanted to share was
[15:21] the the verse that sister Hope sang that
[15:24] wasn't in the original song that I
[15:26] believe Brother Brandaman wrote it
[15:28] though. had suffered for many days. Did
[15:31] you sing? I think you sang that
[15:33] verse. He had suffered with a stomach
[15:37] condition and it was with him pretty
[15:40] much his whole
[15:41] life
[15:43] and he had an experience in Sabino
[15:47] Canyon in
[15:49] 1965, the same year that he passed
[15:53] away. And you probably know the story.
[15:56] It was a a vision that he had of this
[16:00] squirrel that many years earlier had
[16:03] gone down into his stomach and and just
[16:06] torn his stomach up and he had suffered
[16:08] with this stomach problem. And this time
[16:12] in
[16:13] 1965 when he was up in Sabino Canyon, he
[16:17] saw that same
[16:18] squirrel and in a vision and it had
[16:22] jumped to hit his mouth like it had done
[16:26] before and it missed and it hit a
[16:29] cactus. I assume it was a choya cactus
[16:32] and killed itself. And brother Ram knew
[16:36] that that was the end of his stomach
[16:39] problem. And he said, 'Lord, he said,
[16:41] and and right there in that sermon,
[16:44] Sister Hope with that same title, he
[16:47] says, why now at the end of my
[16:50] life, me an old man, the end of my life,
[16:53] he was 56 years old. Why did the Lord
[16:56] choose to heal me
[16:58] now and not
[17:01] before? Well, he did. And my testimony
[17:06] that I'd like to share is I gave a
[17:08] testimony of being healed of a stomach
[17:11] problem in uh I don't know it's probably
[17:14] 15 years ago. We were in church and I I
[17:17] told it was either Sunday morning or
[17:18] Sunday night. I told about how the a
[17:21] friend of mine had laid his hands on me
[17:23] and prayed for me and I had suffered
[17:26] with this stomach condition for my whole
[17:28] life and at that very moment the Lord
[17:31] healed me.
[17:33] Well, I think I've given that
[17:35] testimony here in church, I think three
[17:39] times. And I think I've given it uh
[17:42] other places. I think maybe one or two
[17:44] times. Every time I give that
[17:48] testimony, the next day I have worse
[17:54] stomach problems that I've ever had in
[17:56] my whole
[17:57] life. And it hits me and it hit me this
[18:00] week. And
[18:03] oh, and it's back to the handfuls of
[18:06] Tums and and drinking the water.
[18:09] And but you know, it gives me
[18:12] faith because I should know it's coming
[18:16] because that's the only time that it
[18:17] hits me is when I give that testimony.
[18:20] So, you know that just as just as we
[18:23] know that God is real, we know that
[18:26] Satan is real, too. And he hates us and
[18:29] he want he's coming after us and he's
[18:32] got a punch. My I was talking with my
[18:33] brother a couple hours ago. He was
[18:36] giving me a testimony of uh somebody
[18:39] that was in our gym there that had given
[18:41] his life to the his heart heart to the
[18:43] Lord. And right after he gives his heart
[18:46] to the Lord, right after his son
[18:50] drowns and is
[18:53] killed.
[18:54] And my brother um ministered and said
[18:59] that Satan is a counter puncher.
[19:03] He fights, but he fights. We take a
[19:06] swing at him and he's really good at
[19:09] taking a swing back. And that's what
[19:11] he's done to me this week with my
[19:13] stomach. And it's like, you know what,
[19:15] Satan? Because my stomach's so upset and
[19:17] because I have that acid reflux coming
[19:19] up, you know what? It helps my faith
[19:21] because I know you're real, too. But I
[19:25] also know that God healed me. And I know
[19:27] that it's going to be gone and it's
[19:29] going to be gone forever again until I
[19:31] give the testimony again. And you know
[19:33] what? I'll give the testimony again and
[19:35] I'll suffer through it.
[19:37] Satan, friends, Satan hates you.
[19:42] He wants you to go to hell. He wants you
[19:46] to go to the same place that he is
[19:49] going. Jesus loves you
[19:54] and Jesus wants you to go to the same
[19:57] place that he is going, which is the
[20:00] heavenly kingdom, which is eternal
[20:03] life. And you know what? It's up to
[20:07] you where you go. Brother Bram said,
[20:11] "Satan voted against me. Jesus voted for
[20:16] me. And how I cast my vote is what
[20:21] determines my eternal
[20:23] destination." So, it's in our hands. We
[20:26] can choose God or we can choose Satan.
[20:29] We can choose to look at the symptoms or
[20:31] we can choose to look at the promise.
[20:34] Amen. Sister Hope, thank you for the
[20:36] song. It always inspires me to give that
[20:38] same testimony. I know you can quote it
[20:40] by heart. It's okay. You can tell other
[20:43] people, too. It's it's a blessing. But
[20:45] but this one was especially a blessing
[20:48] because my stomach is is just really
[20:50] upset right now. And when you were
[20:53] singing that song, I thought of that
[20:55] squirrel and how that vision how it
[20:58] missed him and it was killed forever.
[21:03] And brother Brandham said, he said, "Why
[21:06] me?" An old man at the end of his
[21:10] life. And he was gone. Brother Jeremy,
[21:14] that was preached, I believe, on
[21:16] Thanksgiving
[21:18] 1965 at Jack Moore's church in
[21:22] Shreveport. And then within a month,
[21:26] Brother Rand with the Lord. Just
[21:29] amazing. God bless you. I uh I didn't
[21:32] mean to take your time. I thought it'd
[21:33] be an encouragement to you. God bless
[21:36] [Music]
[21:42] you. I had this song on my heart on the
[21:45] list, but uh as she started talking, I
[21:49] uh decided to pick above all out of the
[21:52] list and above all powers and above all
[21:55] things. I think
[21:57] it's fitting
[22:04] song. Above all
[22:08] power, above all
[22:13] kings, above all
[22:15] nature and all created
[22:21] things. above all
[22:24] wisdom and all the ways of
[22:31] men. You were here before the world
[22:38] begins. Above all
[22:42] kingoms, above all
[22:46] thrones, above
[22:49] all the world has ever
[22:54] known. Above all
[22:57] wealth and treesures of the
[23:04] earth, there's no way to measure what
[23:08] you're worth.
[23:16] Crucified, laid behind the
[23:20] stone. You
[23:22] live to
[23:24] die, rejected and
[23:27] alone like a
[23:30] road. Trempled on the ground.
[23:36] eternal
[23:40] fall of
[23:44] me above all. Let's go back to verse
[23:49] one. Above all
[23:52] [Music]
[23:54] powers, above all
[23:58] kings, above all nature and all
[24:06] created, above all
[24:09] wisdom and all the ways of
[24:16] man, you were here before the world
[24:23] begins. Above all
[24:27] kingoms, above all
[24:31] thrones, above all wonderers the world
[24:36] has ever known.
[24:41] of all
[24:42] wealth and treasures on the
[24:49] earth. There's no way to measure what
[24:54] you
[24:57] will
[24:59] [Music]
[25:01] crucified. Laid behind the
[25:05] stone. You
[25:07] live to
[25:09] die. Rejected and
[25:13] alone like a
[25:16] rose trampled on the ground.
[25:21] He took the
[25:25] fall on
[25:29] me of our
[25:34] home.
[25:38] Crucified laid behind the
[25:42] stone. He
[25:44] lived to die.
[25:47] Rejected and
[25:49] alone like a
[25:53] rose treble on the
[25:57] ground. He took the
[26:01] fall
[26:06] and
[26:11] [Music]
[26:15] abing. that that line, you live to die.
[26:19] He lived to die so that we might die to
[26:22] live.
[26:24] It's it's just it's just the perfect
[26:26] balance. The reflection. The reflection.
[26:29] I I I love it. I love
[26:34] it. And the last time since we met in
[26:38] our study of David, Jerusalem Day was
[26:42] observed in Israel.
[26:44] the reconquest of the old city in the
[26:46] Temple Mount on the 28th of IR on the
[26:49] Hebrew calendar May 26th this year but
[26:53] was June the 7th
[26:55] 1967 58 years ago. June 7th is this
[26:59] coming
[27:00] Saturday. Last Sunday, June 1st was the
[27:04] first day of Shàuot, the feast of weeks,
[27:07] what we know is Pentecost. That was on
[27:10] the Hebrew calendar. On the Christian
[27:12] calendar, it will be this Sunday, June
[27:16] the 8th, right in between on June 4,
[27:20] sandwiched between the Jewish and
[27:21] Christian observances of
[27:24] Pentecost. And we all think of that
[27:26] Pentecost, the year Jesus rose, when the
[27:29] Holy Spirit came and empowered those in
[27:32] the upper room to boldly declare the
[27:35] gospel message there in Jerusalem.
[27:39] I'm excited tonight about our lesson on
[27:41] David. It will culminate with his
[27:43] conquest of Jerusalem and I can't help
[27:46] but be encouraged by the timing,
[27:48] Jerusalem, Shàuote, and Pentecost and
[27:52] our study of David. If we could stand
[27:56] together and approach the Lord in prayer
[27:58] before we uh before we proceed.
[28:03] Lord
[28:05] Jesus, we're so grateful that we can
[28:07] call upon your
[28:09] name. We know, Lord, that you're here in
[28:12] our midst, Lord, and we just we just
[28:14] long for that those those times, those
[28:17] moments when we can just bask in your
[28:19] presence, just feel your spirit near us.
[28:23] Lord, I pray for our pastor Daniel this
[28:25] evening with his stomach that's still
[28:27] bothering him, Lord, that you just grant
[28:28] him complete relief from that. That we
[28:30] just send it right back to Satan. We
[28:33] don't accept it. We don't want it
[28:35] anymore. Lord, I pray that you would
[28:38] forgive us each one this evening. Lord,
[28:40] wherever any of us have fallen short and
[28:42] especially, Lord, perhaps selfishly, I
[28:45] ask that for myself, Lord, that nothing
[28:47] would be said here that would mislead or
[28:49] discourage or confuse anyone. But Lord,
[28:52] that you might be glorified. Lord, we're
[28:55] just grateful that we can have this
[28:58] opportunity. Continue to be with us.
[29:00] Bless us. Thank you for our musicians,
[29:03] those that lead in worship, Lord, to
[29:05] help us lay aside the cares of this
[29:07] world and draw our focus onto you. May
[29:10] our focus remain on you this evening. We
[29:12] ask in Jesus precious name.
[29:18] Amen. For our opening verse or verses,
[29:22] I'd like to read a portion of a psalm of
[29:24] David. And and of course, it'll be found
[29:27] in Acts chapter 2. It's part of Peter's
[29:31] sermon in Jerusalem on
[29:35] Pentecost. Pentecost is in Jewish
[29:38] tradition the day when Moses received
[29:40] the Torah on Mount
[29:43] Si. Many practitioners of Judaism this
[29:46] weekend will hear the Ten Commandments
[29:48] read in a synagogue and then they'll go
[29:50] home and spend all night studying the
[29:53] Torah.
[29:55] It's also the traditional birth date of
[29:59] King David. It's also the traditional
[30:03] death date of King
[30:05] David. Peter is speaking to a crowd of
[30:08] pilgrims fully aware of these
[30:15] traditions. And he's standing not far
[30:18] from David's tomb.
[30:21] In fact, it's almost certainly visible
[30:22] to him and many in the crowd as he
[30:24] speaks. The traditional site from the
[30:27] 9th century AD is indicated on the
[30:29] satellite image of Jerusalem marked with
[30:32] the Star of
[30:34] David. But I've also put a question mark
[30:37] near the south wall of the old city in
[30:40] the Temple Mount, which is the more
[30:41] likely location based on the biblical
[30:44] texts. Regardless of the uncertainty
[30:47] today, its location was known in Peter's
[30:51] day. Peter is speaking of Jesus and
[30:55] David on Pentecost in Jerusalem. And
[30:59] he's quoting from Psalm 16. We read in
[31:02] Acts 2, for David speaketh concerning
[31:05] him, the Messiah. Psalm 168, I foraw the
[31:10] Lord always before my face, for he is on
[31:13] my right hand that I should not be
[31:16] moved. Psalm 16:9, therefore did my
[31:20] heart rejoice, my tongue was glad.
[31:23] Moreover, also my flesh shall rest in
[31:26] hope. Psalm
[31:32] 16:10. because thou wilt not leave my
[31:35] soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer
[31:37] tholy one to see
[31:39] corruption. Psalm 16:11, "Thou hast made
[31:42] known to me the ways of life. Thou shalt
[31:45] make me full of joy with thy
[31:48] countenance." Peter then begins
[31:50] preaching, "Men and brethren, let me
[31:52] freely speak unto you the patriarch
[31:54] David." He's both dead and buried and
[31:57] undoubtedly gesturing. He says, "And his
[32:00] suppler is with us to this day." You can
[32:03] see it. It's right
[32:05] here. Please be
[32:11] seated. For the past several weeks,
[32:14] we've examined the life of David through
[32:16] narrative and psalms during the years
[32:20] before he became king, the formative
[32:23] years.
[32:25] Tonight we'll look at the life of David
[32:28] through the transition to the royal
[32:30] years when he became
[32:33] king. We're now at a place in David's
[32:36] life where the book of 1 Chronicles
[32:38] contains many of the same events as the
[32:40] end of the book of 1 Samuel and all of
[32:42] the book of 2
[32:44] Samuel. We'll start tonight's lesson of
[32:46] David becoming king by reading from 1
[32:49] Chronicles 10. The same account almost
[32:52] word for word is in 1st Samuel chapter
[32:56] 31. Both accounts, however, leave out a
[32:59] very important detail. And by the way,
[33:01] we'll be reading a lot tonight. And
[33:03] that's a good thing because we want to
[33:05] hear from him, not from this
[33:08] guy. 1 Chronicles
[33:11] 10. Now the Philistines fought against
[33:14] Israel, and the men of Israel fled from
[33:16] before the Philistines and fell down
[33:18] slain in Mount Gilboa. We talked about
[33:20] the setup for this battle last time when
[33:23] David was sent home to Ziglag while the
[33:25] Philistines went up uh to the uh forces
[33:29] of Saul that were in the north. And the
[33:32] Philistines followed hard after Saul and
[33:34] upon his
[33:36] sons. And the Philistines slew. They
[33:39] killed Jonathan and Abinadab and Mushua,
[33:43] the sons of
[33:45] Saul. And the battle went sore against
[33:47] Saul. And the archers hit him, and he
[33:50] was wounded of the archers. For Samuel
[33:52] Count said he was sore wounded of the
[33:55] archers. Then said Saul unto his armor
[33:58] bearer, "Draw thy sword, thrust me
[34:02] through therewith, lest these
[34:03] uncircumcised come and abuse me." But
[34:07] his armor bearer would not. For he was
[34:10] sore afraid. He was very afraid. So Saul
[34:14] took a sword and fell upon it.
[34:19] Both accounts leave out the fact that
[34:22] Saul's attempt at suicide failed,
[34:25] leading you to think that Saul falling
[34:27] on his sword ended his life. But it
[34:29] didn't, as we'll see in a few minutes.
[34:31] But he soon did die. And when his armor
[34:34] bearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell
[34:37] likewise on the sword and
[34:40] died. So Saul died and his three sons
[34:44] and all his house died together. 1
[34:46] Samuel says, "So Saul died and his three
[34:48] sons and his armor bearer and all his
[34:51] men that same day
[34:53] together." Well, both accounts then tell
[34:56] of the rescue and burial of Saul and
[34:58] Jonathan's bodies by the men of Yabesh
[35:00] Gilead. 1 Chronicle then immediately
[35:03] starts
[35:05] 11:1 Then all Israel gathered themselves
[35:09] to David unto Hebron, saying, "Behold,
[35:12] we are thy bone and thy flesh. And
[35:14] moreover, in time past, even when Saul
[35:17] was king, thou was he that led us out
[35:19] and brought in Israel. And the Lord thy
[35:21] God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my
[35:23] people Israel. Thou shalt be ruler over
[35:26] my people
[35:27] Israel. Therefore came all the elders of
[35:30] Israel to the king at Hebbron. And David
[35:34] made a covenant with them in Hebron
[35:36] before the Lord. And they anointed David
[35:38] king over Israel according to the word
[35:41] of the Lord by
[35:44] Samuel. So we have Saul, Jonathan are
[35:48] killed, their bodies are rescued and and
[35:50] and buried and Israel gathers themselves
[35:53] in three verses. We have David made king
[35:56] over
[35:57] Israel. Zero verses from the death of
[36:00] Saul to chapter 11 verse one. Quick and
[36:03] easy, right? What do you think took? few
[36:06] weeks. Doesn't take that long to come
[36:08] from the north down to Hebron and say,
[36:09] "Hey, you're our
[36:12] guy."
[36:14] Wrong. You might remember when we
[36:16] studied in the book of Genesis that
[36:18] there was this white space between the
[36:20] end of chapter 40 and chapter 41. And
[36:23] chapter 41 tells us that this was a gap
[36:25] of of two years. It's between when he
[36:28] interpreted the dreams of the butler and
[36:30] the baker and interpreted the dreams of
[36:33] Pharaoh.
[36:35] The Bible is silent about what happened
[36:37] in those years, but we were able to
[36:38] determine and infer some of the
[36:40] significant events that
[36:42] occurred. Well, there's a similar white
[36:44] space between the end of 1 Chronicles
[36:47] chapter 10 and 1
[36:49] Chronicles 11. I've shown an excerpt
[36:52] from the Hebrew text over on this side
[36:54] because this doesn't have verses and
[36:56] chapters and all that, but there's a
[36:59] space and that space is
[37:03] significant. It's like the white space
[37:05] in Joseph's life and it's also a period
[37:09] of about two years. It's called reading
[37:12] between the lines.
[37:15] In fact, 2 Samuel takes four chapters to
[37:20] get from the death of Saul to 1st
[37:21] Chronicles 11:1, which is the same as 2
[37:25] Samuel 5 verse
[37:29] one. Well, what happens in the first
[37:32] four chapters of 2 Samuel? What
[37:36] happens during those two
[37:39] years? Any
[37:43] guesses? Civil War.
[37:47] There's a civil war. We often think,
[37:49] well, Saul had a United Kingdom and then
[37:50] David had a United Kingdom onto Saul and
[37:52] then it split. Saul had a united
[37:55] kingdom, then it split. David reunited
[37:58] the kingdom with Solomon and then it
[38:00] split again permanently. So, let's read.
[38:03] The text starts by filling in that
[38:05] missing event that I mentioned at the
[38:07] death of Saul on Mount Gilboa.
[38:11] Now it came to pass after the death of
[38:14] Saul when David was returned from the
[38:16] slaughter of the Amalachites and David
[38:19] had abodeed two days in Ziglag. You
[38:21] might recall from last time that
[38:24] uh the Philistines had gathered here at
[38:27] Aphek. They had sent David back to
[38:29] Ziglag while they went up to fight with
[38:31] Saul. The forces were at Jezreel. They
[38:33] met at Mount Gilboa. David gets back to
[38:36] Ziglag, finds the city burned. the
[38:39] people have been stolen. He and 400 of
[38:43] his men cross this uh this little brook
[38:46] down here and they go to the Amalachites
[38:48] and they rescue everybody and they come
[38:50] back to their ruined city. And now
[38:52] they've been back for two
[38:55] days. No internet, no
[38:58] texting. He doesn't know what's happened
[39:00] up in the
[39:01] north. He he'd like to know. It came to
[39:05] pass even on the third day that behold a
[39:09] man came out of the camp from Saul with
[39:12] his clothes torn earth upon his head.
[39:16] And so it was when he came to David that
[39:19] he fell to the earth and did
[39:23] obesence. And David said unto him, "From
[39:27] whence come thou? Where are you from?
[39:29] How'd you get here?" And he said unto
[39:31] him, "Out of the camp of Israel, I am
[39:36] escaped." David said unto him, "How went
[39:39] the matter? I I pray thee, tell me." And
[39:42] he answered that the people are fled
[39:45] from the battle. Many of the people also
[39:48] are fallen and
[39:51] dead. And Saul and Jonathan his son are
[39:56] dead also.
[39:58] And David said unto the young man that
[40:00] told him, "How knowest thou that Saul
[40:03] and Jonathan and his son be dead?"
[40:07] The young man that told him said, "As I
[40:10] happened by chance upon Mount
[40:15] Gilboa, Behold, Saul leaned upon his
[40:18] spear, and lo, the chariots and horsemen
[40:22] followed hard after him. And and when he
[40:25] looked behind him, he saw me and called
[40:29] unto me. And I
[40:31] answered, Here am I."
[40:34] And he said unto me, "Who who are you?"
[40:38] And I answered him, "I am an
[40:42] Amalachite." He said unto me again,
[40:45] "Stand, I pray thee upon me. Slay me.
[40:49] Anguish has come upon me, for my life is
[40:52] yet whole in
[40:54] me." Notice Saul has been badly wounded
[40:57] by the archers. He's tried to end his
[41:00] life by falling on his sword, but he's
[41:03] still alive. He's now leaning on his
[41:05] spear in absolute agony, trying to
[41:08] commit suicide before he's tortured by
[41:11] the
[41:11] Philistines. He calls for the stranger
[41:14] to kill him quickly and his misery
[41:16] quenches fear. A mercy
[41:19] killing. So I stood upon him and slew
[41:24] him because I was sure he could not live
[41:27] after that he was fallen. and I took the
[41:30] crown that was upon his head and the
[41:32] bracelet that was on his arm and have
[41:35] brought them hither to my lord. I I
[41:37] obeyed your king's
[41:45] command. Then David took hold on his own
[41:48] clothes and rent them and likewise all
[41:50] the men that were with him. And they
[41:53] mourned and wept and fasted until
[41:56] evening for Saul and for Jonathan his
[41:59] son and for the people of the Lord and
[42:02] for the house of Israel because they
[42:05] were fallen by the
[42:07] sword. We must keep in mind David has
[42:10] the heart of his shepherd. The
[42:11] descendants of Jacob are his people. He
[42:13] feels responsible for them. He's been
[42:16] selected by God as the king to succeed
[42:18] Saul. Though Saul's a troubled man who
[42:21] hates David personally, he was also
[42:24] selected by God to be king and rule over
[42:27] the nation. And his son, Crown Prince
[42:31] Jonathan, was David's very best friend
[42:34] and most trusted
[42:38] ally.
[42:41] And David said unto the young man that
[42:44] told
[42:45] him, "Where are you from?"
[42:49] And he answered, "I am the son of a
[42:51] stranger and
[42:54] Amalachite." David said unto him, "How
[42:56] was thou not afraid to stretch forth
[42:58] thine hand to destroy the Lord's
[43:01] anointed?" And David called one of the
[43:03] young men and said, "Go near, fall upon
[43:06] him." And he smoteed him that he
[43:09] died. In the
[43:12] future, when David wants to build the
[43:14] Jerusalem temple, the Lord will tell him
[43:17] that he can't because he has shed too
[43:20] much
[43:21] blood. We'll see this trait of David
[43:25] throughout his life. Perhaps a lesson to
[43:29] us to not be quick to condemn others.
[43:34] David said unto him, "Thy blood be upon
[43:36] thy head, for thy mouth hath testified
[43:39] against thee, saying, I have slain the
[43:41] Lord's
[43:42] anointed." Now, I I like to read an
[43:46] associated psalm. And and there is no
[43:48] psalm about this, but David did compose
[43:51] a
[43:52] lament revealing his
[43:55] heart. David lamented with this
[43:58] lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan,
[44:01] his son.
[44:03] And a rather curious verse here in
[44:05] parenthesis also he bade them teach the
[44:07] children of Judah the use of the bow.
[44:10] Behold it is written in the book of
[44:14] Joshua. This verse is generally believed
[44:17] to be a reference to this lament titled
[44:20] the bow. It may have been meant as a
[44:22] warning to not underestimate the danger
[44:24] of the archer. Either way it was part of
[44:27] a collection contained in a scroll
[44:30] titled the book of Jasher. We say
[44:32] jasher. The Hebrew is Yeshua meaning
[44:35] straight or
[44:36] righteous. But that book has not
[44:38] survived. We only have this
[44:41] lament. The beauty of Israel is slain
[44:45] upon thy high places. How are the mighty
[44:49] fallen? This is plural. Are not is. The
[44:55] lament is worth both Saul and Jonathan
[44:58] as well as the people. How are the
[45:01] mighty fallen is a recurring refrain in
[45:03] this
[45:04] lament. Tell it not in Gath, publish it,
[45:07] declare it not in the streets of
[45:09] Ashcolon. Why? These are Philistine
[45:12] cities. Lest the daughters of the
[45:15] Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters
[45:18] of the uncircumcised triumph.
[45:22] Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no
[45:25] dew, neither let there be rain upon you,
[45:27] nor nor fields of offerings. For there
[45:31] the shield of the mighty is vilely cast
[45:33] away. The shield of Saul as though he
[45:37] had not been anointed with
[45:40] oil. From the blood of the slain, from
[45:43] the fat of the mighty, the bow of
[45:46] Jonathan turned not back, and the sword
[45:48] of Saul returned not empty. They were
[45:52] brave and valiant
[45:53] warriors. Saul and Jonathan were lovely
[45:57] and pleasant in their lives. He speaks
[46:00] in this manner of
[46:02] whom?
[46:03] Saul as well as
[46:06] Jonathan. And in their death they were
[46:09] not divided. They were swifter than
[46:12] eagles, stronger than lions.
[46:16] Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,
[46:19] who clothed you in scarlet with other
[46:21] delights, who put on ornaments of gold
[46:23] upon your
[46:25] apparel. How are the mighty fallen in
[46:28] the midst of the battle? Oh Jonathan,
[46:31] thou was slain in thine high places. I'm
[46:34] distressed for thee, my brother
[46:36] Jonathan. Very pleasant hast thou been
[46:39] unto me. Thy love to me was wonderful,
[46:41] passing the love of women.
[46:44] Some isolate this verse and claim that
[46:47] David and Jonathan were homosexually
[46:49] involved. No, it's speaking of the
[46:52] extreme grief that David felt at this
[46:55] news. How much he valued the friendship
[46:58] between himself and
[47:00] Jonathan. He then ends with, "How are
[47:04] the mighty fallen and the weapons of war
[47:08] perished?"
[47:11] Well, it came to pass after this that
[47:13] David in the ruins of Ziglag, at that
[47:16] time still in Philistine territory,
[47:18] David inquired of the Lord, saying,
[47:21] "Shall I go up into any of the cities of
[47:24] Judah? This place is destroyed. Lord,
[47:27] where should I go?" The Lord said unto
[47:30] him, "Go up." David said, "Whi shall I
[47:33] go up? Where?" And he said, "Unto
[47:36] Hebron."
[47:39] So here again we see this map. That's
[47:41] where the battle was. You can see the
[47:43] scale of miles. The distance from Ziklag
[47:45] to Hebron is maybe 25 miles, maybe 30.
[47:48] Hebron's in the midst of
[47:51] Judah. You might recall that that's
[47:53] where Jacob lived when Joseph uh left
[47:57] and went up north and got sold into
[47:59] slavery and sent down to Egypt. It's
[48:01] where Jacob lived when Joseph sent the
[48:04] carts to come and take him to Egypt.
[48:11] So David went up to there and his two
[48:14] wives also, Ahinoam the Jezelitis, and
[48:18] Abigail, formerly Nibal's wife, the
[48:22] Carmelite. And his men that were with
[48:24] him did David bring up every man with
[48:26] his household, and they dwelt in the
[48:28] cities of
[48:29] Hebron. And the men of Israel, no, no,
[48:34] no. The men of Judah came and there in
[48:37] Hebbron they anointed David king over
[48:40] the house of
[48:42] Judah and they told David saying that
[48:45] the men of Yabish Gilead were they that
[48:48] buried Saul.
[48:50] You might remember when Saul became
[48:53] king, not everybody was happy about
[48:56] that, but one of his first acts was to
[48:59] rescue Yabish Gilead from an attack and
[49:01] threatened mutilation by the Ammonites,
[49:04] which you read about in 1st Samuel 11.
[49:07] And this was the act that united the
[49:10] kingdom under Saul.
[49:13] And David sent messengers unto the men
[49:14] of Yabishgilead, and said unto them,
[49:17] "Blessed be ye of the Lord, that you
[49:20] have showed this kindness unto your
[49:21] Lord, even unto Saul, and have buried
[49:24] him." And now the Lord showed kindness
[49:26] and truth unto you, and I also will
[49:29] requite you this kindness, because you
[49:31] have done this thing. Therefore, now let
[49:34] your hands be strengthened. Be ye
[49:36] valiant, for your master Saul is dead,
[49:39] and also the house of Judah have
[49:41] anointed me king over
[49:43] them. David's praising them at the same
[49:47] time trying to draw them into his fold
[49:49] and make him their king to fully replace
[49:52] Saul to again unite the kingdom.
[49:57] But Abner, the son of Nurr, now Abner is
[50:02] a close relative of Saul, either an
[50:04] uncle or a first cousin. The genealogies
[50:06] say that uh that Kish had a brother
[50:10] named. So that would make him his his
[50:14] uncle, but it also talks about children
[50:16] there suggesting he was a first cousin.
[50:19] So we don't really know, but he's a very
[50:20] near relative. Abnner the son of Nurr,
[50:24] captain of Saul's host, took Ishbath,
[50:27] the son of Saul, and brought him over to
[50:31] Mahanim. Remember, Saul and three of his
[50:33] sons were killed in the battle of Mount
[50:34] Bilgoa, but Gilboa, but Saul had a
[50:37] fourth son,
[50:39] Ishbos. Abnner is the military leader of
[50:42] Saul's army, the one whom David insulted
[50:45] when he snuck into Saul's camp and took
[50:47] his spear and water jug, which we
[50:49] covered last time. Regardless, Abnner is
[50:52] intensely loyal to his relative Saul and
[50:54] thus Saul's bloodline, which David had
[50:57] promised to not destroy. So Abnner takes
[51:00] Saul's remaining son, Ishbos, and Abnner
[51:03] made him king over Gilead and over the
[51:05] Asherites and over Jezrael and over
[51:08] Ephraim and over Benjamin, over all
[51:10] Israel.
[51:13] So here on this map, I've drawn in the
[51:15] approximate border of uh his Bosch
[51:18] kingdom in red there with his capital at
[51:20] Mahanim. And David is meanwhile ruling
[51:24] Judah from Hebbran. And as always, I've
[51:27] got the six-pointed star marking the
[51:29] location of
[51:31] Jerusalem. Ishbos, Saul's son, was 40
[51:35] years old when he began to reign over
[51:37] Israel. And he reigned for two years.
[51:40] But the house of Judah followed
[51:42] David. And the time that David was king
[51:45] in Hebron over the house of Judah was
[51:47] seven years and six
[51:49] months. Well, since his Bose only
[51:52] reigned for two years, this tells us
[51:54] that that white space that we saw in 1
[51:56] Chronicles between chapters 10 and 11 is
[51:58] about two years. Well, back to the start
[52:01] of his Bose's reign and the beginning of
[52:04] the civil war.
[52:07] And Abnner the son of Nur and the
[52:10] servants soldiers of his Bose the son of
[52:12] Saul went out from Mahanim to
[52:15] Gibian. And Joab the son of Zariah and
[52:18] the servants soldiers of David went out
[52:21] and met together by the pool of Gibian.
[52:24] They sat down, the one on the one side
[52:26] of the pool, the other on the other side
[52:28] of the pool.
[52:31] This is not sitting side by side in
[52:33] lounge chairs at a resort
[52:35] pool drinking pink lemonade having a
[52:38] friendly
[52:39] chat. They're on opposite sides of a
[52:41] pond. They're each leading an army and
[52:44] they're there to fight.
[52:49] So here we can see that uh David's guys
[52:52] have come up here from Hebron and
[52:56] Abner's guys have come down this way and
[52:59] they're here at
[53:02] Gibian Saul's old headquarters of Gibia
[53:05] right next door to
[53:10] Gibian. Th this is a difficult passage
[53:14] for me to read. Abnner said unto Joab,
[53:18] "Let the young men now rise and play,
[53:21] make sport in this context, fight before
[53:25] us." And Joab said, "Let them arise."
[53:30] Joab agrees to the contest. And there
[53:33] arose and went over by number 12 of
[53:37] Benjamin, which pertained to his Bose,
[53:39] the son of Saul, and 12 of the servants
[53:42] of David.
[53:46] And they caught everyone his fellow by
[53:48] the head and thrust his sword into their
[53:52] side. So they fell down together.
[53:55] Wherefore that place was
[53:58] called Yeah, you can read it. Which is
[54:01] in
[54:02] Gibian. In other words, the 24
[54:05] combatants all
[54:07] died. Let them play. Let the games
[54:11] begin. It's a gruesome spectacle. You're
[54:15] sending these guys there to fight. It's
[54:17] the modern equivalent isn't quite to
[54:19] this level. It's like mixed martial arts
[54:22] cage fighting or something. The intent
[54:24] here is you fight to the death. It
[54:26] reminds us of a millennium later when
[54:28] Roman gladiators will fight in an arena
[54:30] while people sat and
[54:33] watched. There was a very sore, a very
[54:35] fierce battle that day. Abnner was
[54:38] beaten. the men of Israel before the
[54:41] servants of David. So there's now war
[54:45] between Ishbosa's army under Abnner and
[54:47] David's army under
[54:50] Joab. Well, the rest of the chapter
[54:52] describes towards after this battle uh
[54:56] Joab's brother Aahel, which is one of
[54:58] David's mighty men, chased Abnner.
[55:01] Abnner warned Azahel to don't follow me,
[55:04] but he wouldn't stop following. Abnner
[55:06] winds up killing him. Toward the end of
[55:09] the day, Abnner and Joab agreed to stop
[55:12] fighting. Abnner, his men returned to
[55:15] Mahanim. Joab and his troops returned to
[55:18] Hebron after burying Azahel in
[55:20] Bethlehem. We'll see that Joab was then
[55:23] out for
[55:25] vengeance against
[55:27] Abner. That's the end of the first
[55:30] battle, not the end of the war. Chapter
[55:33] three. Now there was long
[55:36] war, two years, between the house of
[55:39] Saul and the house of David. But David
[55:42] grew stronger and stronger, and the
[55:44] house of Saul became weaker and
[55:48] weaker. Meanwhile, unto David were sons
[55:51] born in Hebron. His firstborn was Amnan
[55:54] of Ahenoam, the Jezelitis. The second
[55:57] Helab of Abigail, the former wife of
[55:59] Nabal the Carmelite. The third, Abselum.
[56:03] We'll hear about him later. The son of
[56:05] Maka, the daughter of Talmi, king of
[56:07] Geisher. Geisher is a territory within
[56:09] Manasseh, modernday Golan Heights. And
[56:12] the fourth, Adonijah, the son of
[56:14] Haggith. And the fifth, Shepha, the son
[56:16] of Abatel. And the sixth, Eitham by
[56:19] Eglot, David's wife. So, David got to
[56:21] Hebron with two ladies. Now he's got at
[56:24] least
[56:25] six. These were born to David in Hebron.
[56:29] We'll see later that he also has
[56:31] daughters that were born to him during
[56:32] this time. They're not listed, but we'll
[56:35] find out about them when we discuss a
[56:38] future rebellion under
[56:41] Abselum. And it came to pass while there
[56:44] was war between the house of Saul and
[56:46] the house of David that Abner made
[56:48] himself strong for the house of Saul. So
[56:51] Abner is cementing his leadership within
[56:55] this Israel kingdom of the north. Well,
[56:59] this goes on for a while. Abnner and
[57:01] Ishbos have a big falling out over a
[57:03] concubine of Sauls, and Abnner decides,
[57:06] you know, this isn't going so well. Uh,
[57:09] we're losing. We need to reunite the
[57:11] kingdom. This this just isn't
[57:13] working. Abnner's a power behind his
[57:16] Bible tells us in these verses that
[57:18] Isbos was afraid of Abner. So, we get to
[57:22] verse 12. Abnner sent messengers to
[57:24] David on his behalf. He's apparently fed
[57:27] up with the spoes, seeing the direction
[57:28] of the war, saying, "Who's is the land?"
[57:32] Saying also, "Make thy league." In other
[57:34] words, a covenant, a contract, a treaty,
[57:37] an agreement. Make thy league with me,
[57:39] and behold, my hand shall be with thee
[57:41] to bring about all Israel unto thee.
[57:43] Let's come together. Let's get this
[57:45] thing figured out, and I'll deliver the
[57:48] rest of the kingdom to you. I've got the
[57:51] power to overthrow overthrow Ishbas. I
[57:54] put him up, I can pull him down. He's a
[57:58] figurehead. And David said, "Well, I
[58:02] will make a league with thee. But first,
[58:05] there's one thing I require of thee.
[58:07] That is, thou shalt not see my face,
[58:10] except thou bring first my Saul's
[58:12] daughter when thou comest to see my
[58:14] face." Remember, they were married. They
[58:18] very much loved each other. She saved
[58:20] his life when Saul was trying to
[58:22] surround and kill him from their house.
[58:24] Saul then took her and marry her off to
[58:26] somebody else. David sent messengers to
[58:29] Ishbosh Saul's son, saying, "Deliver me
[58:32] my wife Michael, which I espouseed to me
[58:35] for 100 foreskins of the Philistines.
[58:37] And Ishbosas sent, and took her from her
[58:40] husband, even from Faliel, the son of
[58:42] Leish. And her husband went with her
[58:44] along, weeping behind her to Bahoreim.
[58:48] Then said Abnner unto him, "Go return."
[58:51] And he
[58:53] returned. Meanwhile, Abnner had
[58:55] communication with the elders of Israel,
[58:57] saying, "Ye sought for David in times
[59:00] past to be king over you. Now then, do
[59:03] it. For the Lord hath spoken of David,
[59:06] saying, "By the hand of my servant
[59:07] David, I will save my people Israel out
[59:10] of the hand of the Philistines and out
[59:12] of the hand of all their enemies."
[59:16] Abnner also spake in the ears of the the
[59:19] leaders or elders the tribe of Benjamin.
[59:22] Abnner went also to speak in the ears of
[59:24] David and Hebron all that seemed good to
[59:26] Israel and that seemed good to the whole
[59:28] house of Benjamin. In other words, he's
[59:30] talked to everybody. He's found out what
[59:32] they want in their treaty so that they
[59:35] can stop the war and and and everything
[59:37] will be settled and well, you won't take
[59:39] vengeance on this guy and whatever all
[59:41] these terms are. He's got everybody to
[59:43] agree to this. He's the diplomat now. So
[59:47] Abnner came to David to Hebron and 20
[59:50] men with him. And David made Abner and
[59:53] the men that were with him a
[59:55] feast. And Abnner said unto David, I
[59:59] will arise and go and will gather all
[1:00:01] Israel unto my lord the king, that they
[1:00:04] may make a league, a covenant, an
[1:00:06] agreement with thee, and that thou
[1:00:08] mayest reign over all that thy heart
[1:00:10] desireth.
[1:00:12] Then David sent Abnner away and he went
[1:00:14] in peace. So far so good. Behold, the
[1:00:19] servants of David and Joab came from
[1:00:22] pursuing a troop there. Returned to
[1:00:23] Hebron from from a raid, and they
[1:00:26] brought in a great spoil, a lot of
[1:00:28] plunder with them. Abnner wasn't with
[1:00:30] David and Hebron, for David had sent him
[1:00:32] away. Abnner was gone in peace.
[1:00:35] When Joab and all the hosts that were
[1:00:37] with him were come, they told Joab,
[1:00:41] saying, "Hey,
[1:00:43] Abner, Abnner, the son of Nur came to
[1:00:46] the king." And David sent him away. And
[1:00:50] he let Abnner go in
[1:00:54] peace. Then Abner came to the king and
[1:00:56] said, "What have you done? Behold,
[1:01:00] Abnner came unto thee. Why is it thou
[1:01:02] has sent him away, and he's quite gone?
[1:01:05] Thou knowest Abnner, the son of Nurr. He
[1:01:08] came to deceive thee, to know thy going
[1:01:10] out on thy coming in, to know all that
[1:01:11] thou doest. You can't trust Abnner. He's
[1:01:14] spying to strengthen himself against
[1:01:19] us. And when Joab was come out from
[1:01:22] David, he sent messengers after Abnner,
[1:01:24] which brought him again from the well of
[1:01:26] Sira. But David didn't know anything
[1:01:28] about it. And when Abra was returned to
[1:01:31] Hein, Job took him aside in the gate to
[1:01:34] speak with him quietly and smoteed him
[1:01:36] there under the fifth rib that he died
[1:01:38] for the blood of Azahel, his brother.
[1:01:41] Remember the one that Abner had killed
[1:01:43] after that first battle. This seems to
[1:01:46] be common in the culture. Recall various
[1:01:48] cities of refuge were established under
[1:01:52] Moses and under Joshua throughout the
[1:01:54] land when it was conquered by Joshua and
[1:01:56] the tribal allotments were made. The
[1:01:58] purpose so was so if a person was killed
[1:02:00] the person responsible could escape to
[1:02:02] the city where his case would be heard
[1:02:04] and if it turns out it was accident then
[1:02:06] the as long as a person stayed in the
[1:02:08] city of refuge they were safe. But
[1:02:10] numbers 35:27 says and the revenger of
[1:02:14] blood find him without outside the
[1:02:16] borders of the city of his refuge. The
[1:02:18] revenger of blood shall kill the slayer
[1:02:20] and shall not be guilty of blood. In
[1:02:22] other words, you had permission to do
[1:02:25] this blood vengeance thing. And we're
[1:02:28] clearly told that Joab, rightly or
[1:02:30] wrongly, was acting as a revenger of
[1:02:35] blood. And afterward, when David heard
[1:02:38] it, he said, "I and my kingdom are
[1:02:40] guiltless before the Lord forever from
[1:02:43] the blood of Abnner, the son of
[1:02:45] Nur." He then curses Joab and his
[1:02:48] descendants and relatives.
[1:02:52] Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on
[1:02:54] all his father's house, and let there
[1:02:57] not fail from the house of Joab one that
[1:02:59] has an issue, or or that is a leper, or
[1:03:02] leanth on a staff, or falleth on the
[1:03:04] sword, or that lacketh
[1:03:10] bread. So Joab and Abishe, his brother,
[1:03:14] slew Abner, because he had slain their
[1:03:16] brother Aahel at Gibian in the battle.
[1:03:21] David said to Joab and to all the people
[1:03:23] that were with him, "Rend your clothes,
[1:03:25] gird you with sackcloth, mourn before
[1:03:27] Abnner." And King David himself followed
[1:03:30] the beer, the coffin, part of a funeral
[1:03:34] procession. They buried Abnner and
[1:03:36] Hebrron. The king lifted up his voice,
[1:03:38] wept at the grave of Abnner. All the
[1:03:39] people wept. The king lamented over
[1:03:42] Abner and said, "Dide Abnner as a fool
[1:03:45] dieth. Thy hands were not bound, nor thy
[1:03:48] feet put into feathers. As a man fallth
[1:03:51] before wicked men, so fellowst
[1:03:55] thou. And all the people wept again over
[1:03:57] him. And all the people came to cause
[1:04:00] David to eat meat while it was yet day.
[1:04:02] David's swear, saying, God, do so to me,
[1:04:04] and more also, if I taste bread or ought
[1:04:06] else, till the sun be
[1:04:08] down. All the people took notice of it.
[1:04:11] It pleased them. Whatsoever the king did
[1:04:13] pleased all the people. All the people
[1:04:15] in all Israel
[1:04:17] understood that day that it was not of
[1:04:20] the king to slay Abnner the son of Nur.
[1:04:23] David's honoring Abner in this way sends
[1:04:26] a calculated a deliberate signal to the
[1:04:29] inhabitants of his Bose kingdom that
[1:04:32] David's not responsible for Abnner's
[1:04:34] death. Remember they've just concluded a
[1:04:36] peace treaty. Oh yeah, peace. I'm going
[1:04:38] to kill your head guy. No. So this is a
[1:04:42] very awkward situation diplomatically.
[1:04:44] The king said unto his servants, "Know
[1:04:47] ye not that there is a prince and a
[1:04:49] great man fallen this day in
[1:04:52] Israel?" And I am this day weak, though
[1:04:56] anointed king, and these men, the sons
[1:04:58] of Zariah, be too hard for me. The Lord
[1:05:00] shall reward the doer of evil according
[1:05:03] to his
[1:05:07] wickedness. Chapter 4.
[1:05:10] When Saul's son Ishbos heard that Admir
[1:05:12] was dead in Hebron, his hands were
[1:05:14] feeble and all the Israelites were
[1:05:17] troubled, really worried. Saul's son had
[1:05:20] two men that were captains of bands. The
[1:05:22] name of one was Bana. The name of the
[1:05:24] other Rahab, the sons of Rimman, a
[1:05:26] Barathite of the children of
[1:05:28] Benjamin. So one day about noon, as this
[1:05:32] Boseit lay in his bed taking a nap in
[1:05:34] the heat of the day, these two guys
[1:05:37] entered. They came into the house. is
[1:05:39] supposed to lay in his bed in his bed
[1:05:41] chamber and they smoteed him and slew
[1:05:44] him and beheaded him and took his head
[1:05:48] and gat them away through the plain all
[1:05:50] night. And they brought the head of
[1:05:52] Ishbath unto David to Hebron and said to
[1:05:56] the king, Behold the head of Ishbos, the
[1:05:59] son of Saul, thine enemy, which sought
[1:06:01] thy life. The Lord hath avenged my lord
[1:06:03] the king this day of Saul and of his
[1:06:06] seed. Saul's line is cut off of all of
[1:06:10] his sons.
[1:06:12] Now David answered Raab and Bana his
[1:06:15] brother, the sons of Remma and the
[1:06:16] Barathite, and said unto them, "As the
[1:06:19] Lord liveth, who hath redeemed my soul
[1:06:21] out of all adversity, when one told me,
[1:06:24] saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking
[1:06:26] to have brought good tidings, I took
[1:06:29] hold of him, and slew him in Ziglag, who
[1:06:31] thought I would have given him a reward
[1:06:33] for his tidings. How much more when
[1:06:36] wicked men have slain a righteous person
[1:06:38] in his own house upon his bed? Shall I
[1:06:41] not therefore now require his blood of
[1:06:43] your hand and take you away from the
[1:06:45] earth? David commanded his young men and
[1:06:48] they slew them, cut off their hands and
[1:06:50] their feet and hang them up over the
[1:06:51] pool in
[1:06:52] Hebron. Pretty gruesome stuff. But they
[1:06:55] took the head of Ishbath and buried it
[1:06:57] in the suppler of Abner and
[1:07:00] Hebron probably for convenience. Notice
[1:07:03] the the treaty with Abnner did not
[1:07:05] require his Bose's death, only that
[1:07:08] David would become king. David had
[1:07:10] promised not to cut off Saul's
[1:07:15] line. Well, now we get to 2 Samuel 5:1,
[1:07:18] which is the same as Chronicles 11:1.
[1:07:21] We've just got through the blank space.
[1:07:24] Then came all the tribes of Judah, no,
[1:07:27] Israel, to David unto Hebbran, and
[1:07:30] spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone
[1:07:34] and thy
[1:07:35] flesh. Also in time past, when Saul was
[1:07:38] king over us, thou was he that led us
[1:07:40] out and brought us in Israel. And the
[1:07:42] Lord said to thee, thou shalt feed my
[1:07:44] people Israel, and thou shalt be a
[1:07:46] captain ruler over Israel.
[1:07:49] So all the elders of Israel came to the
[1:07:52] king to Hebron. And King David made a
[1:07:55] league with them in Hebron before the
[1:07:56] Lord. And they anointed David king over
[1:08:01] Israel. It's now a united
[1:08:04] kingdom. David was 30 years old when he
[1:08:08] began to reign. He reigned 40 years in
[1:08:11] Hebbran. He reigned over Judah seven
[1:08:13] years and six months. And in Jerusalem
[1:08:15] he reigned 30 and3 years over all Israel
[1:08:18] and
[1:08:20] Judah. And the king and his men went to
[1:08:22] Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the
[1:08:24] inhabitants of the
[1:08:25] land. Now recall our opening scriptures
[1:08:28] from 1st Chronicles 11. Therefore came
[1:08:30] all the elders of Israel to the king to
[1:08:33] Hebron and made a covenant with them and
[1:08:35] Hebron before the Lord. And they
[1:08:37] anointed David king over Israel
[1:08:39] according to the word of the Lord by
[1:08:41] Samuel. and David and all Israel went to
[1:08:44] Jerusalem which is
[1:08:47] Jebus. You remember our opening sequence
[1:08:50] of scriptures. We saw there was a gap
[1:08:51] between 1 Chronicles 10 and 11 and the
[1:08:54] Hebrew text it was clear we saw it was a
[1:08:56] bit over two years but we just saw in 2
[1:09:00] Samuel 5:5 as well as 2 Samuel 2:1 that
[1:09:04] David ruled from Hebron for a total of
[1:09:06] seven and a half years. Is there another
[1:09:08] gap?
[1:09:11] Yes, there's another gap here. It's
[1:09:14] clear in the Hebrew
[1:09:16] text. This is a much smaller gap on the
[1:09:19] page, but it's five years, not two. So,
[1:09:24] he ruled over the combined kingdom for
[1:09:26] about five years from Hebron before
[1:09:29] going to Jerusalem and making it its
[1:09:32] capital. Okay? Doesn't tell us what
[1:09:35] happened in those five years. So, we're
[1:09:37] not going to go two and a half times
[1:09:38] longer than we just went to cover this
[1:09:41] gap. The king and his men went to
[1:09:44] Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the
[1:09:47] inhabitants of the land, which spake
[1:09:49] unto David, saying, "Except thou take
[1:09:52] away the blind and the lame, thou shalt
[1:09:53] not come in hither." Thinking, David
[1:09:56] cannot come in here. This is a taunt.
[1:09:59] It's an insult. The Jebusites are
[1:10:02] saying, "Even our lame and blind
[1:10:04] inhabitants can prevent your forces from
[1:10:06] taking our city. We're impregnable.
[1:10:10] Don't even bother trying. You're no
[1:10:12] match for
[1:10:13] us."
[1:10:15] Nevertheless, David took the stronghold
[1:10:18] of Zion, the same is the city of David.
[1:10:24] And David said on that
[1:10:27] day, "Whosoever getth up to the
[1:10:31] gutter,"
[1:10:33] gutter, we'll get to that. Getth up to
[1:10:36] the gutter and smiteth the Jebusites and
[1:10:38] the lame and the blind that are hated of
[1:10:40] Dave's David's soul. He shall be chief
[1:10:42] and captain. Wherefore, they said, "The
[1:10:44] blind and the lame shall not come into
[1:10:46] the
[1:10:48] house." The the complete Jewish Bible
[1:10:50] translation's a bit clearer. What David
[1:10:52] said on that day was In order to attack
[1:10:54] the Jebusites, you have to climb up from
[1:10:57] the spring outside the city through the
[1:10:58] water tunnel. Then you can do away with
[1:11:01] those so-called lame and blind whom
[1:11:03] David despises. Hence the expression,
[1:11:06] the blind and lame keep him from
[1:11:07] entering the
[1:11:09] house. And in the King James italicized
[1:11:13] statement, he shall be chief and
[1:11:14] captain. That's really a statement about
[1:11:17] Joab from 1 Chronicles.
[1:11:22] David said, "Whosoever smiteth the
[1:11:24] Jebusites first shall be chief and
[1:11:26] captain." So Joab, the son of Uriah,
[1:11:28] went up first and was
[1:11:31] chief. Well, let's take a closer look at
[1:11:34] all
[1:11:35] this. What's the big deal about the
[1:11:38] Jebusites? And what's the big deal about
[1:11:42] Jerusalem? Until now, it has not played
[1:11:45] a role in our story. In fact, Jabus, the
[1:11:48] city of the Jebusites, which eventually
[1:11:50] was expanded and became Jerusalem, at
[1:11:52] that time was a small walled city. It
[1:11:55] covered about 11
[1:12:00] acres. It's not even a city block. This
[1:12:03] is this is
[1:12:04] nothing. Until now, in Israel's history,
[1:12:07] it had not been conquered. Not by
[1:12:09] Joshua, not even up to the time of Saul.
[1:12:12] It's not to say the people known as the
[1:12:14] Jebusites in general had not been
[1:12:16] weakened or reduced in number and size
[1:12:18] over the years. It's only to say that
[1:12:20] Jebus, the city of the Jebusites, had
[1:12:22] never been
[1:12:25] conquered. Joshua
[1:12:28] 15:63, talking about all the conquests.
[1:12:31] As for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of
[1:12:33] Jerusalem, the children of Judah could
[1:12:35] not drive them out. But the Jebusites
[1:12:38] dwell with the children of Judah at
[1:12:40] Jerusalem unto this day. From the book
[1:12:42] of Joshua, in the book of Judges, we
[1:12:44] read, "The children of Benjamin did not
[1:12:46] drive out the Jebusites that inhabited
[1:12:48] Jerusalem, but the Jebusites dwell with
[1:12:51] the children of Benjamin Jerusalem until
[1:12:53] this day when Judges was written."
[1:12:56] Somehow the city seemed
[1:12:59] unconquerable, 11
[1:13:01] acres. Joshua tried and failed. Judah
[1:13:05] tried and failed. Benjamin tried and
[1:13:07] failed. They apparently weren't causing
[1:13:10] trouble. You never read about raids by
[1:13:12] the Jebusites. It's the Philistines, the
[1:13:14] Ammonites, the Amalachites, and so
[1:13:16] forth. Why the sudden interest and
[1:13:20] trying to take it
[1:13:27] now? Consider the early history of our
[1:13:30] nation. The 13 original states were
[1:13:33] along the Atlantic coast. The southern
[1:13:36] states, Virginia, North and South
[1:13:38] Carolina, Georgia, allowed
[1:13:40] slavery. The seven northern states,
[1:13:43] Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New
[1:13:44] Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode
[1:13:46] Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
[1:13:48] did not. In choosing a location for the
[1:13:51] nation's capital, a compromise was
[1:13:53] reached. a small territory on the border
[1:13:56] between these two regions. The border
[1:13:58] between Virginia and Maryland was set
[1:14:00] aside as being part of neither state,
[1:14:03] part of neither region. And in the
[1:14:06] approximate geographical center of the
[1:14:08] nation at that time, most people lived
[1:14:10] along the
[1:14:11] coast. So even though these territories
[1:14:14] are shown going in, people lived along
[1:14:16] the coast here and along the coast here.
[1:14:18] Washington is pretty much the middle.
[1:14:21] They might have gotten this inspiration
[1:14:23] from
[1:14:26] David. Consider David's situation. Saul
[1:14:29] had his capital at
[1:14:31] Giba in the territory of his tribal
[1:14:33] affiliation, Benjamin. David of Judah
[1:14:37] had his capital deep inside Judah in the
[1:14:40] city of
[1:14:41] Hebron there. And Saul's thing was there
[1:14:45] and this other fellow Mahanim was way up
[1:14:48] here.
[1:14:51] Jabus that is Jerusalem was not part of
[1:14:55] any tribal land. It was unconquered. Yet
[1:14:59] it was on the border between Judah and
[1:15:00] Benjamin. When Joshua describes the
[1:15:02] borders in the book of Joshua, Jebus is
[1:15:06] stated as being part of the border of
[1:15:08] Judah in Joshua 158 and part of the
[1:15:11] border of Benjamin in Joshua
[1:15:14] 18:16. As we just read in Joshua, the
[1:15:16] children of Judah couldn't conquer it.
[1:15:18] Judges tells us the Benjaminites
[1:15:20] couldn't
[1:15:20] either. Centrally located, it's the
[1:15:24] perfect location for a politically
[1:15:27] neutral territory from which to rule the
[1:15:30] united monarchy from Dan to
[1:15:35] Beersa. When we think of ancient
[1:15:38] Jerusalem or the city of David, we
[1:15:40] imagine the old city that we see today.
[1:15:44] the huge temple mount, the Dome of the
[1:15:46] Rock, the Elsa mosque, the Western Wall,
[1:15:49] and so forth. I marked the walls of what
[1:15:51] we called the old city in yellow in this
[1:15:53] satellite view of modern
[1:15:56] Jerusalem. You can see the Temple Mount
[1:15:58] right
[1:16:00] there. We'll zoom in a little bit.
[1:16:03] Here's the old city again with a Temple
[1:16:05] Mount Plaza indicated, but in David's
[1:16:08] time, it was very different.
[1:16:12] Here's the same image of modern
[1:16:14] Jerusalem with the area of the city of
[1:16:16] the Jebusites that David conquered
[1:16:19] outlined in
[1:16:21] pink. The area which will become known
[1:16:24] as the city of David. It still is. That
[1:16:28] district is known as the city of David.
[1:16:30] And you can can't make it up. And
[1:16:32] there's a road that goes right through
[1:16:33] there. And that road is called the city
[1:16:35] of
[1:16:37] David. It's not what you expected, is
[1:16:40] it?
[1:16:42] It barely covered 11 acres. It's not
[1:16:44] even what we call the old
[1:16:47] city. Why was it so resilient to
[1:16:52] conquest? Here's a cutaway view of the
[1:16:55] topography of Jerusalem, the height or
[1:16:57] altitude. The vertical scale is
[1:16:59] exaggerated. You can see the present old
[1:17:02] city
[1:17:02] wall and you can see the temple mount
[1:17:06] area there outlined. The city of the
[1:17:08] Jebusites, which David conquered,
[1:17:11] is on this little ridge in pink, this
[1:17:14] little finger of
[1:17:16] land. Here you can see a a
[1:17:20] valley on your right to the east of the
[1:17:24] city. It's called the Kidrron Valley.
[1:17:26] It's deep and steep. The hill rising on
[1:17:29] your right, marked in green, is the
[1:17:31] Mount of Olives.
[1:17:34] A smaller valley marked here in blue is
[1:17:36] called the Tyropean Valley, which means
[1:17:39] the valley of the cheese makers. Don't
[1:17:40] ask me why. It cuts right through the
[1:17:43] old city in the edge of the Temple
[1:17:44] Mount. It's largely filled in today, but
[1:17:47] in David's time, it was steep and narrow
[1:17:49] in the area of the Jebusites. Again, in
[1:17:51] pink, there was a wall and a steep
[1:17:54] reinforced area to protect from the
[1:17:56] north towards what would become the
[1:17:58] Temple Mount.
[1:18:01] This view shows those two valleys marked
[1:18:03] on a zoomed-in view of the modern city.
[1:18:07] The ancient Jebusite city location
[1:18:09] outlined in pink is today still known as
[1:18:12] the city of
[1:18:14] David. The location has a very important
[1:18:18] strategic water
[1:18:20] source. Water is everything in the
[1:18:22] desert. I think we know something about
[1:18:24] that with that huge flooding.3 of an
[1:18:27] inch of rain we had last week that we
[1:18:29] somehow survived.
[1:18:31] Well, this is the Guihan
[1:18:33] spring. Recent archaeological
[1:18:36] discoveries indicate the Jebusites had
[1:18:38] massive towers and walls to protect the
[1:18:40] water source. And the spring, by the
[1:18:43] way, feeds the pool of
[1:18:45] Salom. And the spring is a gushing
[1:18:47] spring. It's not flowing all the time.
[1:18:49] It
[1:18:51] flows and doesn't. And water gushes and
[1:18:56] stops. So, it'll flow a large amount of
[1:18:59] water, then no flow for a while, then
[1:19:00] another
[1:19:02] gush. This is the approximate path of
[1:19:05] the channel that fed the pool. Again,
[1:19:08] the city is outlined in pink. And you
[1:19:10] say, "Well, that's pretty easy to get
[1:19:12] to." No. No. In ancient times, that
[1:19:15] channel that fed the pool was cut into
[1:19:16] bedrock and then covered over with
[1:19:18] massive stone slabs. Water was all
[1:19:24] important. Ask brother Daniel about how
[1:19:27] important water
[1:19:28] is. This is an illustration of the water
[1:19:31] system based on archaeological findings
[1:19:33] over the past few
[1:19:35] decades. So the Guihan spring protected
[1:19:39] and defended channels this water to the
[1:19:40] Salom pool along that way and what
[1:19:43] amounts to an underground channel or
[1:19:45] tunnel. There's a massive rock cut
[1:19:47] pool. This here has been cut into the
[1:19:50] bedrock.
[1:19:52] So you've got water coming from a spring
[1:19:54] protected with massive towers. It goes
[1:19:56] through this essentially underground
[1:19:58] channel that's been cut into the bedrock
[1:20:00] to go to this pool. And then up here's a
[1:20:03] tunnel that's been dug. And so they get
[1:20:05] water inside the city because you can
[1:20:07] see the ancient wall ruins of the
[1:20:09] ancient walls onto the bedrock. This is
[1:20:11] the modern ground surface here. So they
[1:20:14] get water with buckets or whatever quite
[1:20:16] a ways down and then go through this
[1:20:18] tunnel and bring it into the city.
[1:20:23] Water was drawn, as I say, probably with
[1:20:26] buckets and
[1:20:28] ropes. The intricate system has been
[1:20:32] around since about 1,800
[1:20:35] BC. This is the end of Joseph's life,
[1:20:38] 350 years before the Exodus, 400 years
[1:20:41] before Joshua entered Canaan. This was a
[1:20:44] fortified place and they had plenty of
[1:20:46] water.
[1:20:48] Yeah, the people that are giving you a
[1:20:50] problem have to go get water someplace
[1:20:53] else. That rock cut pool
[1:20:57] here. Here's a a little bit of some of
[1:21:00] the excavation of it. It's pretty deep
[1:21:02] and pretty steep. And a final note on
[1:21:05] this, but the King James version uses
[1:21:08] the word gutter in verse eight. David
[1:21:10] said on that day, whosoever getth up to
[1:21:12] the gutter and smiteth the Jebusites.
[1:21:15] Other translations typically say water
[1:21:17] tunnel or water shaft. The Hebrew word,
[1:21:21] I'm sure you're all wondering what the
[1:21:23] Hebrew word is, right? The Hebrew word
[1:21:25] is senor, translated gutter. That word
[1:21:29] senor only appears two times in the
[1:21:31] entire Bible. Only twice. The other time
[1:21:35] it appears is in Psalm
[1:21:38] 42:7. A verse I think that we're all
[1:21:40] familiar with. Deep calleth unto deep at
[1:21:43] the noise of thy water spouts. All thy
[1:21:46] waves and thy billows are gone over me.
[1:21:48] Here it's translated water spouts. Other
[1:21:51] translations typically say the noise or
[1:21:53] roar of thy
[1:21:55] waterfalls. Jewish publication society
[1:21:57] says the roar of thy
[1:22:00] cataracts. Personally, since this only
[1:22:04] appears twice, I wonder if David in
[1:22:05] writing the psalm is associating the
[1:22:08] noise of the gushing nature of the
[1:22:11] Guehon spring in conjunction with that
[1:22:13] shaft or rock cut pool. The noise of the
[1:22:16] surging water would help to mask any
[1:22:18] noise that Joab and his fellow invaders
[1:22:20] might make as they climb to sneak into
[1:22:22] the city and open the gates to let
[1:22:25] David's army in.
[1:22:29] So David dwelt in the fort and called it
[1:22:31] the city of David. David built
[1:22:33] roundabout from Milo and
[1:22:35] inward. 1 Chronicles tells us that Joab
[1:22:38] repaired the rest of the city. David
[1:22:41] went on and grew great and the Lord of
[1:22:43] hosts was with him. And Hyram, king of
[1:22:45] Ty, sent messengers to David, and cedar
[1:22:48] trees and carpenters and masons. And
[1:22:51] they built David a house.
[1:22:55] David celebrates the dedication of his
[1:22:58] house as recorded in Psalm
[1:23:03] 30. A psalm and song at the dedication
[1:23:07] of the house of
[1:23:08] David. I will extol thee, oh Lord. Thou
[1:23:12] hast lifted me up and has not made my
[1:23:14] foes to rejoice over me. Oh Lord, my
[1:23:18] God, I cried unto thee and thou hast
[1:23:21] healed me. In Hebrew, this is poetry.
[1:23:24] You have two lines that say essentially
[1:23:26] the same thing but in different ways.
[1:23:28] That way you can translate it to other
[1:23:30] languages and it carries through. It
[1:23:32] doesn't upon pentameter and rhyming
[1:23:35] verse and all that sort of thing. Oh
[1:23:37] Lord, thou hast brought up my soul from
[1:23:39] the grave. Thou hast kept me alive that
[1:23:42] I should not go down to the
[1:23:46] pit. Sing unto the Lord, oh ye saints of
[1:23:50] his. Give thanks at the remembrance of
[1:23:54] his
[1:23:55] holiness. His anger endures but a
[1:23:59] moment. In his favor is
[1:24:02] life. Weeping may endure for a night,
[1:24:05] but joy comes in the
[1:24:07] morning. And in my prosperity I said, I
[1:24:10] shall never be
[1:24:12] moved. Lord, by thy favor thou hast made
[1:24:16] my mountain to stand
[1:24:19] strong. Thou hast hide thy face. I was
[1:24:22] troubled. I cried unto thee, oh Lord.
[1:24:24] Unto the Lord I made
[1:24:27] supplication. What profit is there in my
[1:24:29] blood? When I go down to the pit, shall
[1:24:32] the dust praise thee? Shall it declare
[1:24:35] thy
[1:24:35] truth? Hear, oh Lord, and have mercy
[1:24:39] upon me, Lord, be thou my
[1:24:42] helper. Thou hast turned for me my
[1:24:45] mourning and to dancing.
[1:24:48] Thou hast put off my sackcloth and
[1:24:51] girded me with
[1:24:53] gladness. Why? To the end that my glory,
[1:24:57] my voice may sing praise to thee and not
[1:25:01] be
[1:25:02] silent. Oh Lord my God, I will give
[1:25:05] thanks unto thee forever.
[1:25:13] What sort of lessons can we take home
[1:25:16] from this portion of the story of
[1:25:20] David? We see David move from being
[1:25:23] selected to eventually rule Israel to
[1:25:27] its
[1:25:29] fulfillment. A civil war, eventual
[1:25:32] peace, the conquest of Jerusalem, David
[1:25:35] settling there, building a palace from
[1:25:37] which to rule the nation.
[1:25:43] To
[1:25:44] me, those blank spaces are
[1:25:49] significant. They tell us we must be
[1:25:52] patient. God does things in his time,
[1:25:56] not ours. We can depend on his word, but
[1:26:00] not on our own interpretation or
[1:26:02] expectation of its timing.
[1:26:05] David knew he was anointed to be king
[1:26:07] over all of the land of
[1:26:09] promise, but he had to fight for it.
[1:26:13] Fight on the one hand and patiently
[1:26:15] await the Lord's timing on the other
[1:26:18] hand. Remember that opportunities that
[1:26:21] he had to kill Saul and wouldn't do
[1:26:23] it. The outcome, he's going to be king.
[1:26:27] He's going to rule over the nation was
[1:26:29] never in doubt. But the path was not an
[1:26:32] easy one. Nor was it swift. It contained
[1:26:36] pain, anguish,
[1:26:40] rejection,
[1:26:42] danger,
[1:26:43] betrayal, a seemingly unending
[1:26:46] struggle. It also contained times of
[1:26:49] peace, happiness, contentment,
[1:26:53] fulfillment. Does it sound familiar to
[1:26:56] any of you? Both kinds of times are in
[1:26:59] our lives. I
[1:27:01] think in the first gap of two years,
[1:27:04] there was civil
[1:27:05] war. But in the longer gap of five
[1:27:08] years, we're told very little. David
[1:27:10] reigned in Hebron over the reunited
[1:27:12] kingdom until he moved the capital to
[1:27:14] Jerusalem. We're not told what happened
[1:27:16] in those years other than a list of sons
[1:27:18] born to him, and we're not sure which
[1:27:20] were in the first two years and which
[1:27:22] were in the second five. musicians could
[1:27:26] please
[1:27:27] return. At the end of all this, David
[1:27:31] conquered the city of the Jebusites.
[1:27:33] Hyram built a palace for him, supplying
[1:27:36] both the materials and the builders. We
[1:27:40] saw David's rejoicing in Psalm 30. We
[1:27:44] often remember a line from that psalm.
[1:27:47] Sorry. Weeping may endure for a night,
[1:27:51] but joy comes in the morning. We must
[1:27:55] hold on to those things which we believe
[1:27:58] the Lord has promised us. Endure and
[1:28:02] work in the interval between the promise
[1:28:06] and its fulfillment, just as David did
[1:28:09] from the time he was anointed by Samuel
[1:28:12] until he reigned over the entire nation
[1:28:14] of Jacob's descendants.
[1:28:17] When David closed Psalm 30, he
[1:28:21] wrote, "Thou hast turned for me my
[1:28:24] mourning into
[1:28:26] dancing." Sometimes I wonder if we dance
[1:28:29] enough. Thou hast put off my sackloth
[1:28:32] and girded me with
[1:28:34] gladness. Why? Why has the Lord done
[1:28:37] this? To the end that my glory, my
[1:28:39] voice, may sing praise to thee and not
[1:28:43] be silent. Oh Lord my God, I will give
[1:28:46] thanks unto thee
[1:28:48] forever. The Apostle Paul wrote in many
[1:28:51] of his letters admonishments to be
[1:28:55] thankful
[1:28:57] always. Let's close this portion of the
[1:28:59] service and turn it over to our pastor
[1:29:01] while we sing. Give thanks.
[1:29:08] Give
[1:29:10] thanks with a grateful heart. I'm off
[1:29:14] key, aren't I? Help me out, brother.
[1:29:21] Give
[1:29:24] thanks with a grateful heart. Give
[1:29:30] thanks to the holy one.
[1:29:35] in
[1:29:36] faith because he's
[1:29:39] given Jesus
[1:29:43] Christ his
[1:29:46] son. Give
[1:29:49] thanks with a grateful heart. Help us
[1:29:53] everybody. Give
[1:29:56] thanks to the holy one. give
[1:30:02] thanks because he's
[1:30:05] given Jesus
[1:30:09] Christ his
[1:30:12] son. And
[1:30:15] now what the weak say, I am
[1:30:21] strong. Let the poor say I am rich.
[1:30:28] because of what the Lord has
[1:30:34] done for
[1:30:37] us. And
[1:30:39] [Music]
[1:30:40] now what the weak say, I am strong.
[1:30:47] Let our poor say I am
[1:30:52] rich because of what the Lord has
[1:30:59] done for
[1:31:02] us. Give
[1:31:08] thanks. Do you like the blank spaces and
[1:31:12] how Brother Lyle could take the blank
[1:31:14] spaces in one book and fill it in with
[1:31:17] another book? I got I got another short
[1:31:20] story. That's what I do. I was when I
[1:31:24] was a kid, Denise, I was probably your
[1:31:26] boy's age, may maybe a little bit
[1:31:29] younger, and I was uh I was reading my
[1:31:33] Bible and I got to that
[1:31:35] part about
[1:31:37] Abner and um Asahel. Asahel or Heel.
[1:31:43] Aahel. And you know, a boy, you know, I
[1:31:47] was like maybe 12 years old or younger
[1:31:51] and I'm reading this
[1:31:54] story and this whole dialogue is going
[1:31:57] on when they're sprinting and Abner's
[1:31:59] running and he's ahead of um
[1:32:03] Asahel and and he's running and he's
[1:32:06] turning back and he's saying, "Back off,
[1:32:08] man." You know, back off. and and the
[1:32:12] guy just keeps running and and uh is
[1:32:15] Joab's brother and he could run like a
[1:32:18] deer and here's Abner and he's going and
[1:32:20] I'm I'm in my Bible and I'm reading this
[1:32:23] thing and I still remember you know as
[1:32:25] as a kid in parents it's so important to
[1:32:29] get your kids in this Bible because the
[1:32:33] stories in this Bible are far better
[1:32:36] than any Star Wars or any stories that
[1:32:40] you that you ever see. I was into Star
[1:32:42] Wars, too. I had a kind of an overactive
[1:32:44] imagination when I was a
[1:32:46] kid. And anyways, I'm just getting into
[1:32:50] this story and I'm I'm reading and
[1:32:53] they're
[1:32:54] running and and
[1:32:57] Josiah Abner was like he was like, "Bro,
[1:33:01] back
[1:33:02] off. You don't want me to stop."
[1:33:06] And this guy just keeps coming and keeps
[1:33:09] coming. And Abdar stops and he takes his
[1:33:15] spear and he does this like ninja move
[1:33:19] and takes the back of the spear and
[1:33:23] stabs this guy that was chasing him and
[1:33:26] kills him. And I I still remember as a
[1:33:29] kid I was like, I like Abner, you know,
[1:33:33] he's this guy's great and he was honest
[1:33:36] and and and I'm reading
[1:33:38] this and I turn the page like, "Oh man."
[1:33:43] Then Joab goes and just like sneaks
[1:33:48] sneaks him off by himself and takes his
[1:33:50] spear and just murders him. Totally
[1:33:54] unfair fight.
[1:33:56] But when I was reading that, I just
[1:33:58] remember like this is this is an
[1:34:02] amazing story. And the Bible records
[1:34:05] these kind of behind the scenes things.
[1:34:09] And it was just such it was such an
[1:34:11] interesting thing to me. And at like 10
[1:34:14] or 11 years old, I still remember the
[1:34:19] visions I had in my mind of the story
[1:34:23] and how just how great of a man David
[1:34:27] was and kind of just this Joab. He was
[1:34:31] just a I think the Bible I think David
[1:34:34] responds to him as a as a bloody man
[1:34:37] later and he just he didn't have any um
[1:34:42] didn't have a conscience conscience to
[1:34:44] him and uh it was just the story that
[1:34:49] brother Lyall was telling I was just
[1:34:51] like man this is so interesting and it's
[1:34:55] just so deep and then he got to the the
[1:34:57] pool of
[1:34:59] um Saleom
[1:35:03] Huh?
[1:35:06] The G. Yeah. The Guehon. The Guehon
[1:35:08] spring. Yeah. Yes. So, so all all of
[1:35:12] this. Now, I'm going to I want to geek
[1:35:14] out on hydrarology to you, but there was
[1:35:16] a So, I went there in uh I don't know if
[1:35:21] five or six years ago, whatever it was,
[1:35:23] I went to Jerusalem and Hezekiah. So, we
[1:35:27] got we got to know our Bible. So
[1:35:29] Hezekiah, we have Saul's the first king.
[1:35:32] David's the second king kind of. Um
[1:35:34] Saul's son was in there a little bit, so
[1:35:36] he may have been, but we have basically
[1:35:38] Dave Saul David. And all of this is
[1:35:42] happening around this spring of water.
[1:35:44] And there's there's no water. It's about
[1:35:46] the same climate we have here in Tucson.
[1:35:49] And later on, the last great king of
[1:35:54] Israel digs a tunnel from this water
[1:35:59] source, digs it through, I assume it's
[1:36:02] limestone, through the rock into the
[1:36:06] walled city of Jerusalem so that they
[1:36:09] could get the water inside of there. And
[1:36:12] and all of this has its roots right here
[1:36:14] in what brother Lyall was reading to us
[1:36:17] today. I uh I love it, friends. I love
[1:36:20] the Bible. We we got to we got to stay
[1:36:23] in it and we got to teach our kids this
[1:36:26] word. It's the more you teach them, sit
[1:36:28] them down and tell them stories at night
[1:36:31] and and this will stick with them. It
[1:36:34] stuck with me. And I mean, Brother
[1:36:37] Manny, you can be 50 years old and it
[1:36:39] sticks with you, you know. Do you
[1:36:41] appreciate Brother Lyle? I do so much.
[1:36:45] [Applause]
[1:36:51] Let's bow our
[1:36:53] heads.
[1:36:55] Father, we thank you for your
[1:36:59] word. Lord, I
[1:37:01] just Oh, as I go through this
[1:37:04] Bible, I just love it so
[1:37:08] much. And brother Lyall, he goes through
[1:37:11] and reads so much out of this 2 Samuel
[1:37:15] and in Chronicles and and Lord, it's
[1:37:20] just such a wonderful story, but it's
[1:37:23] not just a story, Lord. It's
[1:37:26] true. Then he tells us, "What lessons
[1:37:29] can you get from
[1:37:31] this?" Lord, we thank you for those
[1:37:34] lessons. We thank you
[1:37:36] for the Bible. We thank you for the
[1:37:39] grace of the Lord
[1:37:41] Jesus. Lord, we're just grateful. We're
[1:37:44] grateful that that you love us enough to
[1:37:47] preserve your word and give us an
[1:37:50] opportunity to read it and Lord to even
[1:37:54] place oursel in this word. We thank you,
[1:37:57] Father. Thank you for brother Lyle for
[1:38:00] his love for you, his hard work. Lord,
[1:38:04] these these lessons don't come
[1:38:06] easy. They take a tremendous amount of
[1:38:09] time and research and reading and
[1:38:12] studying. Lord, we thank you for the
[1:38:14] time that he put in. I pray
[1:38:17] that it
[1:38:19] would, Lord, that it would take hold in
[1:38:23] our lives and that it would be well
[1:38:25] worth the time that he's put in that we
[1:38:28] might take it and Lord, we might be
[1:38:30] better people.
[1:38:33] Thank you, Lord. Thank you for this
[1:38:35] church and all the loved ones here and
[1:38:39] the love we have for each
[1:38:41] other. Lord, there just
[1:38:43] there's I could never stop and saying
[1:38:46] thank you. Bless us now as we go.
[1:38:49] Father, guide our
[1:38:52] path. Be with us. Father, protect us
[1:38:56] along this life's journey. We ask in
[1:38:59] Jesus name. Amen.
[1:39:03] [Music]
[1:39:06] Give
[1:39:09] thanks with a grateful heart. Give
[1:39:16] thanks to the holy
[1:39:20] one. Give
[1:39:23] thanks because he's
[1:39:26] given
[1:39:28] Jesus Christ.
[1:39:31] Christ his
[1:39:34] son. Give

[1:39:45] thanks to the holy one. Give
[1:39:51] thanks because he's
[1:39:54] given
[1:39:56] Jesus Christ.
[1:40:00] his
[1:40:02] son. And
[1:40:06] now let the weak say I am
[1:40:12] strong. Let the poor say I am
[1:40:19] rich because of what the Lord has
[1:40:26] done for us.
[1:40:30] And
[1:40:32] now let the weak say I am
[1:40:39] strong. Let the poor say I am
[1:40:45] rich. Because of what the Lord has
[1:40:52] done for us.
[1:40:56] give
[1:41:03] thanks. God bless
[1:41:06] you,
[1:41:08] friends. Please read your
[1:41:11] Bibles. Read it on your own. Sit
[1:41:16] down, sit in a comfortable
[1:41:19] chair, open up the Bible, read it on
[1:41:23] your Bible app, whatever you want to do.
[1:41:26] and just enjoy it because it's good.
[1:41:29] Don't don't feel pressured like, "Oh, I
[1:41:31] gotta do this or I'm gonna just dedicate
[1:41:34] um I'm gonna dedicate an hour or 30
[1:41:38] minutes a day to reading reading my
[1:41:40] Bible." Do it because you want to do it
[1:41:42] because you can sit down and when you
[1:41:44] really get into it, it is great. It it's
[1:41:49] just it I told somebody one time I was
[1:41:53] witnessing to this lady. I said, "The
[1:41:55] more you pray, the more you want to
[1:41:58] pray." And the more you read your Bible,
[1:42:02] the more you're going to want to read
[1:42:03] your Bible because it doesn't
[1:42:06] disappoint. I love our Wednesday night
[1:42:08] Bible studies. I want to keep doing it.
[1:42:10] It just it's it's a blessing to me. And
[1:42:12] I think that we're moving forward as a
[1:42:14] church and we're we're learning these
[1:42:15] things, these foundational beliefs that
[1:42:18] make us a Christian. God bless you,
[1:42:20] brothers and sisters. You're
[1:42:24] dismissed. And
[1:42:27] now let the weak say I am
[1:42:34] strong. Let the poor say I am rich.
[1:42:41] because of what the Lord has
[1:42:47] done for
[1:42:50] us. And
[1:42:53] now let the weak say I am
[1:42:59] strong. Let the poor say I am rich.
[1:43:07] because of what the Lord has
[1:43:12] done for
[1:43:15] us. Give
[1:43:22] thanks. Give thanks.
