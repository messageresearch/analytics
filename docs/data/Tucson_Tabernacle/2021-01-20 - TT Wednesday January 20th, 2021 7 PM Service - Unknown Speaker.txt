standing we have a couple of requests to bring your attention brother jordan sent a text a little while ago they were at home still doing better and lord willing the family would be here on sunday so we're trusting in that and got a text update from sister rachel lopez about sister aggie they had taken her off the ventilator and she was improving and suddenly her lungs filled back up again they had to put her back on a ventilator so it's been a struggle but we still know god still moves so let's remember the lopez family and then my daughter nina sent us a text for a friend of hers they had taken to the hospital and she was not feeling well at all and they found some cysts and some blood clots in her heart and so she asked that we would remember her in prayer today and i told her we would so if you can believe all things are possible amen so let's just just bow our hands as we pray lord you've heard the requests and you see everyone here and you know their hearts lord and their desires and their needs and those that might be listening in today or or streaming or wherever they might be some may be working some may be traveling lord and there may be some lord that are just down in the dumps today disappointed over events or whatever it might be lord but if you'll draw an eye to them like you did those walking on the way to emmaus lord and they were headed back home they thought it was all over lord but you drew nigh to them lord draw an eye to each one tonight lord and encourage every heart lord for your honor and your glory because you still move lord we love you for that in jesus christ's day amen so we have a praise also from my niece eunice needs and her and ava had had been sick and the pediatrician was able to check ava said she was doing well there was nothing wrong that she would be able to return to to school on monday and eunice she had was tested for covet and she's believing that the results will be good so let's believe together we know he's the same yesterday today and while you're standing and they're standing too we have with us today brother john and sister ruthie god from walnut ridge arkansas from brother david morris's church there and for those of you that were here a long time ago and you remember joshua hernandez they're good friends and attend the church there with him and and brother joshua told me he called me and said did they make it they made it last sunday but i didn't get a chance to really talk to them but he told me that we have something in common see he has six daughters too so um i thought if all the girls were here i'd have them sit there so they'd feel at home but you know god bless you brother and sister good to have you god bless thank you musicians and appreciate the grace of god let's read that first scripture there while you're still standing out of second timothy chapter one and we'll be read seven and twelve i was telling brother lyle on sunday there was knowing we'd be speaking tonight lord willing that there were so many thoughts how do you marshal them into one but i felt that after brother matt spoke on sunday it kind of aligned in a certain direction so but for god hath not given us the spirit of fear that tells us there is a spirit of fear but he didn't give it to us but of power and of love and a sound mind it says uh a spirit of timid timidity or cowardness backing away being afraid no he says but a spirit of love a power of love and a sound mind discipline self-control sound judgment and if you'll stay with what god's word says judgment it never fails and then verse 12 he says this in verse 12 he said for this cause which cause i also suffer these things now this is paul saying and we heard that on wednesday night we must suffer it's a promise not the promises we look for but through all the suffering he makes away in how he said nevertheless i am not ashamed for i know whom i have believed he says and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i've committed unto him against that day that which i've entrusted to him and say lord hear i put in your hands amen god bless you the word of god is you may be seated the word of god never fails it'll never return void so just uh a reminder to before i forget brother andrew glover will be here this weekend with us for sunday weekend and so lord willing we'll have a good time you come under expectation god said where two or three are gathered i'll be in their midst you know and sometimes it's it's not because he fails it's because you know we come as humans sometimes and we're weak we're tired we're disappointed we've had a a rough day or maybe got some disappointing information or news and it's heavy on the heart but god said i'll not leave you where two or three are gathered he says so remember that there also and come under expectation believing that so brother peter spoke several wednesdays ago and and there was just one thought and i'd like to just bring that poor part of it where he said the the inoculation and i was at home still under quarantine and i was listening and i made a couple of notes and and i thought about the inoculation of it and and you realize the inoculation is eternal it never fell he's always been there he was a lamb slain from before the foundation of the world already had made provision i said this here when we spoke last time he put a lamb in the garden for a reason he knew what that reason was going to be so but the virus is temporal it has its end it has its finish so you know that inoculation the spirit of god if that same spirit that raised christ from the dead dwells in you it will quicken your mortal body i know a lot of people have said and we we kind of lean this way sometimes oh when i get to heaven all this will be over and that is true but it will quicken your mortal body the body you're in now so there's a promise for today and and we do that so the thought of that there where where the the inoculation is eternal amen it's the benefit plan that brother greene used to say it's it's no nothing like you know amen and then of course we brother lyle when he spoke of of suffering is part of the promises of god but in suffering character is built in suffering we learn our lessons and not only that but because you suffered you have compassion and mercy on somebody else that's going through and you can share with this is how god gave me this is how you know and um i was talking to my brother yesterday and they they're still doing some some testing about the cancer they they say they found in his esophagus and one of the other ones they thought in his lower back they could be cancer they found it was just a scar from an injury and some things but he went and he and he and he went to visit his doctor his regular doctor and he was having a lot of trouble with athena's body and he gave him a simple solution take a half a teaspoon of baking soda every day and and he said these last four days have been the best four days i've had and sometimes somebody has something god has done for them and they can share it with you and of course knowing me i had just i was cleaning out the tub and the drains and the in the sink in the tub and i had just used a huge cup of baking soda and a thing of vinegar and i said it really works it cleaned out the tub and he goes that sounds like you all right you know but god provides for our needs and and we appreciate his grace and his mercy to us so looking at some of those things and then brother matt especially god knows here and god knows here and he knows all the in between two and sometimes an answer even if it's a no and and we you would say lord if you'll just give me an answer i'll know how to proceed i'll know if i need to go this way but you know sometimes in waiting character is built patience is built lord i need patience but give it to me quickly you know the microwave version stick it in and it's done quickly no it's a lifelong experience so god is god has been good to us and he said i will never leave you so taking this thoughts and and we had been speaking of of eternity and there's no way to harness eternity and into our own thoughts and into a couple of services because it takes eternity to do that but god's word is eternal every part of it and so the thought today is why fear why should i fear now fear is real how many can testify the fear is real how many have been paralyzed by a situation where you can't move you can't go you don't know what to do coming home one day driving home my wife and my daughter had gone up to phoenix to pick up some cabinets for the company and i picked them up on the way out and somebody ran an intersection right in front of us and hit somebody and killed the person right in front of us and myself and another lady were the only ones there and we had to attend to it and the 45 minutes hour of that time i just did what i needed to do we got it all they finally let us go the next intersection i came up to i slowed down almost stopped looked both ways all the way home even if there was a stoplight there because suddenly that fear of what had happened what i saw was there but he's not given us a spirit of fear we sometimes let it come upon us i i'm not saying it's not there it's there but we take god's word and we stand on that and sometimes we have to say lord help me i'm struggling through this i'm going through a hard time but john says saint john here first john 3 1-2 behold what manner of love the father has to be bedout upon us not just in word but indeed with action with effectiveness he says that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not uh john puts it in it he says if you're if the people are looking you're thinking your words strange he goes they did that to him so what difference it would be with you and let's look at verse 2. beloved now we are the sons of god and it doth not yet appear what we shall be because you look at this guy and sometimes boy that ain't very godly at times if that's god i'm disappointed but he says but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and when you begin to see these things that god put in his word for us you can take courage and say i don't need to fear god has seen this from this already and he has seen me there brother greene said this one time and brother branham told him that he says now you and billy were friends here and there's going to be this time but you'll be friends again here brother green's talked about the times like this too but a promise over here and that's what we hold on to brother matt used a scripture he said i go to prepare a place for you and if i go he says i'll come back did he go so will he come back and will he take us with him amen what a promise we have let's let's read the the first two quotes that they gave the brothers there to and this part of it if i could call i just want to say this portion of it if if leaves a lot of room for things i'll be going over if this happens if i can get off on time if we can go to out to eat if i got enough money you know what i mean the if it becomes one of the most important words in that sentence if that same spirit that raised christ from the dead dwells in you so this just portion of it is settle that if in your life make sure what does it say make sure of your own salvation look at your own calling not because god doesn't know but you need to settle it god settled it already but sometimes you have to have that assurance you have to look at it and said work out your own salvation with fear and trouble get it settled in your life and brother brahm says romans 8 11 but if there is a problem there's his catch but if the spirit of god of him god the holy spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you now there you are if the bridegroom spirit dwells in the bride they are one it should be adam and eve eve was in adam already you were part of him he knew you from before the foundation of the world you have to see yourself in that position that place when god made his first bridegroom he made the bridegroom first and he was both man and woman in spirit formed him in the dust of the earth to make him material now notice when he made eve okay let's let me get to my place here and notice when he made eve from adam he took not another piece of clay he took from the same piece of clay the same word for adam was a spoken word see he took from him and then taken he had the masculine and feminist spirit he took the feminist spirit away from adam and placed it in eve so it's still part of adam's spirit it's adam's flesh then it was adam's spirit the dynamic dynamic that quicken the mechanics of his body so the bride must also be flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone then how is this mortal flesh going to become his flesh and we'll get to it in a minute see how is it done how what is this great transformation now notice now if the spirit of him god that race of jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you so here we we see that that clue he's saying if and he ties adam and eve together and if you were part of him then it's tied together again we'll go to another quote following along that same line should be the rising of the sun god provide a place of worship okay romans 8 11 it is if the spirit that raised up jesus from the dead be in you it will also quicken your mortal bodies if the spirit that raised up jesus from the dead if it be in you it will also quicken your mortal bodies quicken it what does the word quick mean the greek word means to be brought to life after death hallelujah he says that's a gate of worship worshiping in the spirit and into truth mechanics and dynamics together you see what i mean if the spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you it will quicken make alive your mortal bodies because it's already life it works in this body now sometimes you just have to be willing to yield and surrender to it and let god move he says and when it comes into your body it brings your whole body subject to it subject to what the word of god if it's in you now if it's something in you telling you well the days that was the days pass and mark 16 is not true and the pentecostal idea of the baptism of the holy ghost that ain't the spirit of god in you i don't care how well you're trained you it's not the spirit of god you say well my mother belonged to this and my father through the years of my brother whatever you want to say about your relatives and so forth that might have been all right with them but it ain't for you each individual must have the same experience okay i'm not a speed reader all right see you've got to have you've got to to this day come into christ jesus for this age and the promise that's meant for this age notice we find out that this great quickening power struck enoch at quickem and he went home without dying it struck elijah quickened him till he went home without dying we find out that his success successor was elisha which is a type thereof christ in the church elisha elijah done four miracles and like elisha done eight miracles he had a double portion like was poured upon the church later they had a dead man and we know they his bones were in that and that grave there throated on his bones and he come to life that quickening power was in the grave with him so you don't have to fear islam or south lawn or up here on i mean if they put your body in there that's okay because when he calls it's coming it's already he said it's already quickened in there he says so he says you can't it's always there when you get that quickening power of god being quickened up with him now now remember in christ we are flesh of his flesh bone of his bones when god wounded christ at calvary he was wounded for me and you we are flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone body of his body name of his name bride of him see we are in him we are his flesh and his bones and god has already raised us up potentially the quickening power that raised us up from a life of sin and changed our being it has potentially raises up in christ jesus which the resurrection will bring us forth in the full maturity so you can stand on that and say i don't have to fear i don't have to be afraid because if this body be destroyed i've got another one to step into remember brother branham talked about that and i think brother matt mentioned he was oh he had been afraid of death fear of death because he just thought what kind of body are we going to be we're just going to float around in heaven all the images and god gave him a few moments on the other side and i say this if god would give each one of us just a couple of moments on the other side this world would mean nothing at all anymore the fear of it all but he's given us glimpses when he comes and he ministers to you when he comes and he touches your body and makes it well when he comes and answers a question when a brother gets behind in ministers of god or you're listening to a tape and god begins to minister to you he's given you a glimpse of that quickening power because he's the same yesterday today and forever so make sure that if it's settled in your life and no question about it you know and and i know that some people say well i know i received the holy ghost and that set up but you know what you can walk with him and talk with him and meet with him every single day me and my wife we got married almost 42 years ago and that wasn't the end of it we got married we're done no there's been a life to live i think now sometimes you can ask her and she'll say amen sometimes it's not that fun sometimes it gets rough sometimes it gets hard we've gone through two remodels in our life now at the house the first one lasted about four months when we added the bedroom all and one of the last statements she made to me is if your marriage can last to remodel it can last anything well we're being tried again we're in the middle of another remodel and she's like oh we're both at times like are you gonna do this when i get to it please you know i can't do everything today and then i turn on have you made dinner yet you know so but you know what we love each other we care for each other and even in the hard times and then you say hey i said yes you said yes for better for worse and thank the lord it's been better i don't know if she'd say that but i will but you know it god is with us he'll never leave us he said i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world so as we look at some of these things here and one more scripture in deuteronomy just just building a little bit of a base here deuteronomy 31 6. when joshua is there and he says be strong and have a good courage fear not nor be afraid of them and that them can be anything to joshua he was telling about crosstalk but for you and i that them whatever it is he says for the lord thy god he's your god he's not somebody else's god he's not the minister's god he's not the prophet's god he's not this one's god he's your god he says he he it is that doth go with thee and he will not fail thee nor forsake thee sometimes you just have to remind yourself what god's word says in the midst of the hard times in the midst of the of the troubles that we're going through at times so why should i fear why should i be afraid you know what are the things that that at times oh you just you would say oh my how can i go on what what what could i do what i just don't understand so let's look at psalms and we're going to go through two sections of psalms here psalms 91 verses 1 through 11. a couple of of well-known psalms here and um to think he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high he says shall abide under the shadow of the almighty and i just thought of that it is a personal relationship it's not a a a group gathering in the sense that just because you're part of that group there is a group of people together but it better be personal to each one of you to each one of us to myself he says and he says i will say of the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him will i trust and the thought that came as i was reading these the other night jesus thoughts came to me because by experience i know this by relationship i know this it's not because i read it in the book or because i saw somebody else but because i have experienced that he's been faithful he's never failed surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pencil he will take you out of the bird net and keep you safe from the wasting diseases and you know we look at them we think of cancer we think of that but there's also sometimes just fatigue tired uh emotional stress that wastes you that tires you out i i was talking to a friend of mine of ours that they lost the brother lost his younger sister and younger brother just in the last two months that passed away and had not seen them for quite a while and they were talking about making some arrangements for the memorial service and all and and i said well how's mom doing we hadn't seen her for quite some time either and he said oh she's in a home care now a place where they take care of you and we haven't told her because she's kind of wasted away and so she doesn't know that two of her children have passed away because it would be we don't know how she would react we know what would happen but he said i'll keep you from that though job said though this body be destroyed in the skin i will know that i will see my redeemer there's something about it there's a hope there's something inside of me that says yes amen though it doesn't look that that's a promise of god here he will cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler and this is nothing but the truth i can go to here and open it and say lord your word says your word says lord you keep it thou shall not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day and another where they say thou shalt be kept from secret and open mischief at night and during the day i just like that little the way they put it there during the day and during the night he's still watching over you he doesn't go to bed and say i'm gonna set the alarm for six when you get up i'll get up with you no he's an ever-present help in the time of trouble nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wastes that news invisibly so we can neither foresee nor prevent prevented this was john wesley's words there he says it's invisible he can't but he sees it and he protects you how many times how many testimonies have you heard when god has spoken and called somebody use somebody to call someone to warn brother branham said this it would come it should come into place in the church where the holy spirit is moving and god would move it upon one to call the other one say don't go that way that you're going go this way because i'm come because god is already aware of it does he still do those things is he still the same yesterday today and forever and he says you know so it'll keep you even from the things that you're not aware of nor for oh wait a minute a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right side right hand but it shall not come nigh thee that's a promise of god so why should i fear if he said that and then he says only with thine eyes shalt out behold and see the reward of the wicked now this is david saying and and sometimes i i when i read the psalms and david is lord i do this to the wicked and lord do this and and i i i don't know i i sometimes i have to heart david why did you have such an attitude about some of the people but you know i would i would do it this way as best i could lord have mercy on them as you've had mercy on me so don't let it get into my heart that i want you to do something to him but he said he would let him handle it let him take care of it he says because thou has made the lord which is my refuge even the most time thy habitation you said because you have said i am in the hands of the lord the most high is my safe resting place you know uh when you find a place that that you can um should i say hide maybe a quiet place in the house in the room somewhere um i know when i was out driving especially uh when we were doing stuff up in the foothills there were some quiet places that you could park under a tree nobody out there and eat your lunch and be quiet you know and and it was just a like you felt like a safe place get away from all the commotion for he says in him in christ in his word is that place there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling remember what he told them strike the blood at the lentil at the post and that death angel going by will not enter in there he never said make yourself holy pray all night fast all night meet these needs he said take that blood from the innocent lamb and put it on the door he said in that so that tells us who is our safety and what is our safety place for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways and and when i was reading this i got the daily strength that they brought and there was a portion that i took out of there he says you may look around yourself and wonder how god could encamp angels around about you but they are there and you must believe that you must trust in that god you said so so therefore they are there the scripture promises you the angel of the lord encampeth around them that fear him and he delivereth them from psalms 34 7. there's one thing you must hold on to though you may not feel like he is there christ is always with you even the devil knew this when he tempted jesus and if he knew it and believes it so should you he knew who he was dealing with well but she should stand the same way i said no god slay me yet i'll trust him you come at me like a flood but he'll raise a standard they are watching over you and your family you can avert the danger at the command of god they watch over your home and your families angels are encamped around about you to come alongside you in your time of need you we must always remember this and trust that he is near to fear the lord is to have reference reverential trust in him and keep his ways don't fear but trust that the angel of the lord are encamped around abound you and your household if he said so then he does that now we also have to watch something keeping the atmosphere where he's comfortable to be there where he wants to be there it's his desire to be there working at the atmosphere working how it is making it a place where he's welcome to be you know i've shared this with you but when my insurance agent came over to look at the house and and he walked in and he sat down and he's looking then he stops and he goes my what a peaceful spirit there is in this home sometimes we didn't notice it because we're too busy doing everything else but let somebody else come down and sit and say wow there's such a peace there what is it about you what is it about you give me some insight why do you have peace in a time like this why is there such an assurance how can you walk like that and act like that he said because god said he would be with me and never leave me and he would watch over me so we had that the one more quote from jehovah jiren i want to read that one right now if you would put that up there many times and every time i like that many times and every time that a man ever done anything that's worth anything he walked alone with god it's not in the company of everybody else in your force and it's you and god because it if it was in the company of everybody else which company would it be but we think we have to have some great something around us to secure us the believer has that company of angels the holy spirit accompanied about the angels are encamped they don't move they stay right with them those who fear the lord they watch for every move now one time a prophet was down at dolphin elisha and the syrians had come in compassed the whole walls around and when gehazi got up and looked out he said oh look at the syrians look at all the problems look at all the things come in the bills are due this is this is going on and elijah then turns around or elisha the old prophet rubbed his eyes and looked around and said why there is more with us than there is with them hey yo gehasi looked around and said i don't see nothing maybe many of you didn't last night but that old color lady did i don't i don't know what it is i don't near that part but she saw something he says lord open this boy's eyes and when god opened his eyes all around the old prophet was angels of fire and the mountains was on fire and chariots of fire and he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he's still the same so the angels are about you why should you fear now let's just talk about a situation there the angels are about you remember that watch what you're doing pay attention to what you're looking at pay attention to your language you're speaking you know say hey lord i don't want to be offensive i do not want to offend these angels i don't want them to be ashamed lord i want to please you you know and sometimes uh some of the things that i saw something the other day in the news where the the young girl was saying some words she shouldn't said so the mother mother washed her mouth out with soap so the girl said i swallowed the soap and it took cost my mom and dad five thousand dollars hospital bill to get me fixed haha on them what an attitude would you dare do that to god if we're not careful with our attitude around him we can be offensive he said i won't leave you but let's make him welcome around us let's have an atmosphere about an atmosphere that that would be pleasing to him and you know how we really show that is how we treat one another how we act around one another how we we treat our neighbors that's how it's manifest not our words we say but our actions so brother branham says he opened his eyes says man they're all around us they've always been there so now let's let's just look at at this time the bible says men's hearts would be failing for fear and and especially in our time right now the things that change even today from one way direction to another but i remind you this is satan's eden he's the god of this evil age so in that sense it shouldn't surprise you but you know he's never won a battle against god he's lost every single one when he thought he had fooled god and got to eve before god had already provided a lamb every time satan went to do something he god was there already already made a provision because men's hearts are failing for fear he says and he tells us when you see these things become to come to pass look up and lift up your heads for your redemption draweth now it's closer now than it's ever been because more and more is being fulfilled driving down the road and you're headed let's say you're going to el paso texas and you get out of the end of tucson here and it's about 300 miles the sign says but as you start going the next sign says el paso 269 miles but eventually you get to the sign that says apostles just around the next turn right well that's the way we are in today we're at the point where just around the corner we're just about there the signs of the times are there he's you know he says and you gotta you gotta be be careful because fear fear will paralyze you it'll also drive you to do works fear will get in you and you'll begin to say i've got to do this i've got to do this i've got to come to that i've got to that's the only way i can get to where god wants me and that is fear driven and i ask this question it it it'll drive a person to works and away from faith and how and when can you fulfill all the law when is enough of the law fulfilled to say that's sufficient you realize that you cannot fulfill all the law and as i was thinking about this the scripture that came to me says when they asked jesus what are the greatest commandments so let's go to galatians chapter five and we'll re read verses one through six and then 13-14 and he says stand fast therefore in the liberty which christ has made us free now paul is dealing with something here the circumcision the uncircumcised do we need the law he's dealing with this amongst the the gentiles and and the jewish people then in the beginning because they had just come out from under the law you know i remember when the message first came as a young man and and we were living in california we had a lot of questions because things were changing things were different what do you mean speaking in tongues is not the evidence of the holy ghost that's what i've been raised up that's what i've been looking to do was speak in tongues because then i would have the holy ghost and suddenly things changed what do you mean that baptizing in the name of the father son and holy ghost for some was wrong because it's what they were raised up and paul is now dealing with them things they had been raised with he says he says and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage he called that law a yoke of bondage it you had to do it this way you had to do it this way he said behold i paul said too that if ye be circumcised christ prophet you nothing if you can keep all the law then you don't need christ you don't need the shed blood you don't need the work he did because you're able to keep the law you've perfected yourself he says for i testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a debtor to the whole law all of it from the beginning to the end who can keep it let me just see if you would raise your hand say today i never had an evil thought i never had a wrong intention i didn't get upset anybody no i got to put my hand down too you're a debtor to the whole law he says christ has become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law ye are fallen from grace that's some hard words but it's true i read i've read every message i've heard every message of brother brandon preach in fact i've heard it five times over and or if you're doing that for works crisis is of no effect to you but if you're doing it because you love them that's a whole different reason it's a whole different way he says for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith lord i will stand on your word for what you said you had said if i asked for forgiveness you would forgive me you said if i would confess you would cleanse it and do away with it you said if i and god does that's a faith that you stand on god said so therefore i believe it take him at it he said for in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love now if you want to see how love works just see what jesus christ did for you because he loved you he gave his all and love turns around and works right back to him the same way lord i surrender i give my all to you and then we'll read 13 and 14. for brethren you have been called unto liberty you've been set free from works trying to earn your own salvation only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another now when you realize what god has became watch what motivated him to do what he did everything that he did was motivated by love we had a a family here who had been raising the message and all and they'd left and gone elsewhere and stuff and they came back to the church here one time and they came in and i'm looking i'm going wow they've changed quite a bit the kids are in shorts and cut hair and earrings and and and different things and they told us to our face that we were serving the message by law therefore that's why our sisters dressed like they didn't do that he goes but we're so free in christ he said we're just so free we can do anything and i'm we went out and brother jerry mcfen was was here peter was just a little boy then but brother jerry got him and basically ran him right out the church get over to the am pm over there to get something to drink on the way home and he's in there and i said oh no do i wait till he leaves or do i go in there now i said i'll go in and as soon as i walked in he began to tell me things and i said brother wait to where i said you're causing a commotion here so we stepped outside and he said something to me and i looked at him and i just said here's my answer to you there was a time that people would look at you or your family said there's christians but they look at you and your family right now and you look no different than them they would never suspect you're a christian and about that time i said he's going to hit me because his hand went back like this so i did the best thing my dad said run so i did i always say that my mom told me if they look older than the second greater don't fight when they might beat you up but you know i just took off there was no reason to do that but he says look do not use it for the occasion to the flesh i'm free i can do anything i please no he said be bound and constrained by the love of god in your life he said for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself and it made me go back who better express that than him when he looked at us fallen broken a mess and he said i'm going to go down and redeem them i'm going to go down and save them i'm going to take their place you know what he became he became your kinsmen redeemer he began to look and this this made me i was reading through the message um on the breach and it got to that portion where where john is it is there and and and he says he realizes no one is worthy found worthy to open the book and john realizes if the book is not open and the names are revealed there is no redemption and brother branham really begins to describe it in that portion where he says he begins to look around john begins to look around and there's there's elijah and he's be calling out these prophets he goes not a single one of them is worthy but the law required a kinsmen redeemer it could not be an angel it could not be one that was not born with flesh it had to be a kinsmen redeemer and you know who became your kinsman redeemer he took flesh upon himself he was born like a baby a human baby was born and it says he learned through obedience by the things he suffered he can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities and he became your kinsmen redeemer brother branham is speaking there and he begins to say oh grace amazing grace how sweet the sound has saved a wretch like me you know so so here he is we're looking and john is crying out and he's saying nobody's found worthy and and he says who nobody the angels couldn't do it they were not kinsmen you know gabriel couldn't do it it was not a kinsmen redeemer but this and then he hears that voice weep not john don't cry don't give up and despair don't throw your hands up don't walk away from this john for the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed so what does john do he turns around to look for a lion if i said hey sister shirley there's a ferocious lamb coming after you probably wouldn't catch your attention but if i said hey there's a lion coming you would turn to look and see because there's something that a lion commands so john is turning to see this prevailing line and his mind there's a brother branham describes it this way i'm just kind of paraphrasing the things he said but he turns around and sees a bloody lamb one who had been slain john had not seen him yet he said where did he come he had come down from eternity he said where he had been up there that that bloody lamb so he said he was he was mediating for us his blood was covering for us and john then begins to rejoice because he realizes redemption was going to take his place because god had provided a lamb so why fear again that's my question why fear why be afraid god said so and he's kept it he's kept his word so again i would say if i could let's go to psalms 23. you've probably never heard this psalms before it'll be the first time you hear it but you got to hear it it's good it's real good david says it this way the lord is my shepherd now sometimes we think a shepherd as an owner we might think a shepherd as the boss but no the shepherd is a caretaker he's the one that watches over the lamb he's the one that makes sure they're going to be fed he's the one that takes he might have to break the leg of one because that lamb is not behaving but you know why so he can carry it up close he said the lord is my shepherd i shall not one it says the lord takes care of me as his sheep i will not be without any good thing all that god does is good he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters i lay down in rest with no fear because he leads me away from danger you can rest when your assurance and your rest is in christ you see god he's proven it over and over he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake he bringeth it back from its errors in wandering because at times we have been places and done things we say lord how did i get here maybe just me then i don't know not for any worth in me but for the glory of his justice and faithfulness and his goodness for his name's sake have you ever heard that because i want to keep my good name i'm going to pay your bill because um they co-signed for you and you faulted on the debt and they want to keep their good name so they pay off the debt that's what he's saying right here for his name's sake he paid a debt he did not owe i owed a debt i couldn't pay so here he is for his name's sake he says what verse were we on there for yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death and that says this is kind of where the point goes i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me when i have to go through the valley of the shadow of death there are times that we get news you go to the doctor you get a test you have some pain you have something and you go see and the doctor says well we find this and you and you're walking maybe maybe it's very serious not just something that you can quickly recover a little bit of of exercise maybe the doctor will say get up and walk around a little bit oh that's that's not that hard but he said we find cancer in your body and you're walking through the the valley of the shadow of death you will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me the wrong and the staff their shows but sometimes they say it's the same thing it can be used to to kind of support yourself it can also be used to reach over and get some attention it depends what you were doing with it and he does the same thing sometimes he's walking with you and he might be if i could put it this way he's a shepherd and he's just using the rod but sometimes he's reaching over and getting your attention because he loves you thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies okay we have enemies it's not your brother's not your sister brother braham said it over it's the devil and though he comes like a flood god has raised up a standard a lot of times we want to put the devil in a person and we want to do the other way we want to put god in that person but it's christ in you the hope of glory thou anointest my head with oil my cup runeth over he says you have made provisions every needs applied in openness before all that opposed me god doesn't do it in secret god meets your need out people know god has met your need and you can testify of it too i thought you were dying of cancer no god has healed me he's met my need how did you god met my deed in openness he doesn't do it behind god is a god who if i could say he has pride in his own work because he's faithful he's not afraid i mean he has said that in the scripture there is no other god before me there is none like me because it's true he's the only one that can say that and he says surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever and let me just say something the lord dwells in you this is your house sometimes we put it in a building sometimes we put it in a certain church or a certain location but no you are the temple no you not you are the temple of the holy ghost he says truly blessings and mercy will be with me all the days of my life and i will have a place in the house of the lord all of my days amen i surrender all i yield to you lord here i am but you know what even more than you desire he desires it more brother branham talked about that and he says you want the holy ghost and god wants to give it more than you want because he knows it's what you need he knows it's that seal he knows it's the guaranteed uh as brother brahm talked about the freight inspector he would look through and see how it was packed for the train and he'd make sure it was packed perfectly so it's going to arrive to its destination then he would put a seal on it and brother brown would say quite often dare any man try to mess with it that's a promise of god so why should i fear i take god at his word and say lord your word says so brother branham says tell him go say god he loves to be reminded of his word he's faithful you know the girls would do it but dad you said so and sometimes dad just said it to when they were little to fight him up a bit tomorrow tomorrow knowing that tomorrow wasn't coming but god's not that way at all god keeps his word and you might be in this portion right now but god has seen you here already he says you're mine and i'll never let you go he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever there's probably i could have probably had another 20 pages of notes but not for tonight so the musicians would make their way why should i fear god is faithful and that and again i'll say fear comes every one of us fear will come it'll it'll come at you like a flood but say god you've right up raised up a standard you know you you could you can even sing a song the joy of the lord is my strength because sometimes we get all caught up in the emotions of the and the the the hard part of this and we forget that singing praises to god singing worship to god talking about his goodness changes the whole atmosphere about us sheltered safe in the arms of god have you ever done that when you're feeling down just begin to worship and praise him it works how many would testify that it works all sudden the attitude the mood everything changes and hey i can get up and go again that's why we're here for one another too all part of the body of god you know in the the sickness that i went through when i when i had the the toe um and i lost a toe there and it's not lost it's the same place the hairs are it's coming back and i know i've said this to me and i think i told my wife i said one of these days i'm going to show you this toe back on this foot and we'll know the resurrection has drawn nigh because god said you're going to go back whole but you know that she told me that she said there's about 6 000 things going on in your body at all times communication sounds everything that you don't know about until one of them goes wrong and then oh oh what's going on love one another encourage one another pray for one another stand with one another sing songs say hey lord lord i'm gonna worship you i'm gonna praise you in this situation paul and silas sitting there they're they're down in the dungeon and brother lyle brought that that macedonia call but they're down in the dungeon i've always said silas is sitting there and thinking paul you never told me about this part i've heard about the wonderful things god has done and all these wonderful things in you but you didn't tell us paul says there's an answer to this silas let's just begin to sing praises ain't god good he gives us so many blessings and silas is going like oh that's a tough one to sing in this situation but okay and he began to worship and god comes on the scene every time so why should i fear there is no fear in perfect love and he has given us perfect love and the power of a sound mind so let's bow our heads lord we you're that great kinsman redeemer lord amazing grace how sweet the sound it saved a wretch like me lord in my best behavior and the best i could ever be i was still lost and unsavable nothing good that have i done as they sang the song he knew me yet he loved me knowing that this looking at this vile body and everything that it goes through and all you still loved us lord because you were that kinsmen redeemer you were bringing back that which was part of you lord and we thank you for that lord let faith let it take god said so therefore i'll stand on that and i will praise you and i'll worship you and i'll
