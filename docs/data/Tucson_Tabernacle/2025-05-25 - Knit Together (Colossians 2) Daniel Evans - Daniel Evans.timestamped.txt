[3:56] those. Let's sing another another old

[7:14] Welcome them to church this morning.
[7:20] [Music]
[7:30] Winds of faith. Brother Jeremy
[7:32] [Music]

[7:51] Happy Memorial Day. Happy Memorial Day
[7:54] weekend. It's good to have you at church
[7:55] with us this morning. God bless you.
[7:58] Let's sing this song. Uh, Winds of
[8:00] Faith. There are two roads you may
[8:04] take.
[8:06] Oh, there are two
[8:10] roads you may take.
[8:15] One by
[8:18] side and one by
[8:23] faith. Take the word of
[8:27] God or what you
[8:31] see. What you
[8:35] believe is what will be.
[8:40] Set your
[8:43] wings to the winds of
[8:48] faith. You can
[8:51] fly in a higher
[8:56] place. Do not
[9:00] struggle. It's by grace.
[9:03] [Music]
[9:05] Let your
[9:07] wings to the winds of
[9:10] faith. What's your need and what's your
[9:16] need? And what's your
[9:20] cry? What's your
[9:24] mountain much to high?
[9:29] Speak the word of
[9:32] God by and
[9:37] by. It will
[9:40] move or you will
[9:44] fly. Set your
[9:48] wings to the winds of
[9:52] faith. You can
[9:56] fly in a higher plane.
[10:01] Do not
[10:04] struggle. It's by
[10:08] grace. Set your
[10:12] wings to the winds of faith. Last verse.
[10:15] Watch the eagle. Watch the
[10:20] eagle in the
[10:24] sky. He does not struggle.
[10:29] He does not
[10:32] strive for the
[10:36] power that makes him
[10:41] rise is
[10:44] already in the
[10:47] sky. Oh, set your
[10:51] way to the winds of faith.
[10:57] You can
[10:59] fly in a higher
[11:04] place. Do not
[11:08] struggle. It's by
[11:12] grace. Set your
[11:15] ways to the winds of faith. Let's sing
[11:18] verse two. If you have a need this
[11:19] morning, hold it before the
[11:21] Lord. Oh, what's your need?
[11:26] What's your
[11:29] cry and what's your
[11:33] mountain? Much too
[11:37] high. Just speak the word of
[11:41] God by and
[11:45] by it will
[11:48] move or you will fly.
[11:54] Set your
[11:56] wings to the winds of
[11:59] [Music]
[12:00] [Applause]
[12:01] faith. You can
[12:04] fly in a higher
[12:09] place. Do not
[12:13] struggle. It's by
[12:17] grace. Set your
[12:20] wings to the winds of faith.
[12:25] Brother Lyle and the brothers, if you'd
[12:26] come to open the service in a word of
[12:29] prayer. Let's just sing in the key of
[12:33] C. As they come to open the service in
[12:36] prayer, it is
[12:42] well with my soul.
[12:50] It is
[12:53] well. It is
[12:56] well
[12:58] with my
[13:01] soul. Let's sing that again. Oh, it is
[13:10] well with my soul.
[13:14] [Music]
[13:18] It is
[13:20] well. It is
[13:24] well with my soul. One more time as a
[13:28] confession this
[13:30] morning. Oh, it is
[13:37] well with my soul.
[13:45] It is
[13:48] well. It is
[13:51] well
[13:53] with my
[13:57] soul. Is that your testimony this
[14:00] morning? It's well with your soul. Saved
[14:03] by the blood of Jesus Christ. Not
[14:05] through any good thing we've done, but
[14:08] by accepting his sacrifice for us.
[14:10] That's what unites us. That's what joins
[14:12] us together. and how we just love to
[14:14] feel the presence of his spirit, how we
[14:16] love to be in each other's presence and
[14:18] just to encourage and strengthen each
[14:20] other. Today's a very special day. Of
[14:23] course, we know that tomorrow is
[14:24] Memorial Day. We celebrate it as a as a
[14:27] holiday, but it's a recognition of those
[14:30] who gave their lives that we could have
[14:32] the freedom to gather here this morning,
[14:34] not being prevented and not being
[14:36] forced, but having that choice. My my
[14:39] middle name is Vernon. I was named after
[14:41] my father's youngest brother who was
[14:42] killed in Euoima in World War II. So,
[14:45] it's a it's a very meaningful day within
[14:47] our
[14:48] family. But at sunset this evening in
[14:51] Israel, which is about now begins the
[14:54] 28th day of Ayar. And you say, "Yeah, so
[14:57] well the 28th of AR was June the 7th in
[15:01] 1967. And it was the day that the Jewish
[15:04] forces liberated the city of Jerusalem.
[15:07] And for the first time since 62 BC, for
[15:11] the first time, Israel, a Jewish
[15:14] sovereign state was ruling the city of
[15:18] Jerusalem. So it's celebrated as
[15:20] Jerusalem Day in Israel. That they're
[15:22] celebrating it right now, this this very
[15:24] moment. And and the to me it was just
[15:27] special that that Jerusalem Day and
[15:29] Memorial Day, sacrifice, freedom, joy,
[15:33] praise, all came together at at the same
[15:35] time. and it happens to be in 2025. We
[15:39] have a prayer request this morning.
[15:42] Sister Rebecca Zumbbran requests prayer
[15:44] for traveling uh mercy for safety as
[15:47] they go to Oklahoma City. And I assume
[15:50] that that's a round trip and they're
[15:51] coming back. So, we'll pray for
[15:52] traveling uh mercies and safety to bring
[15:55] her back safe to us as well. We also
[15:57] have a praise. You know, the Bible talks
[15:59] about we're surrounded by such a cloud
[16:01] of witnesses. And it's not just what
[16:04] people did before, but it's what's going
[16:06] on. Jesus moving in our midst today. So,
[16:09] we have a praise here from Brother
[16:11] Heath. He says, "Thank you, Jesus. My
[16:14] daughter-in-law wrecked my truck. But
[16:17] Jesus provided another for us. God is
[16:20] good." So, we're just grateful with our
[16:22] brother Heath that the Lord made a way
[16:24] for him to replace that vehicle. And I
[16:26] presume that your daughter-in-law was
[16:28] not seriously injured in that uh thing.
[16:30] No, he says she's good. Okay. So, let's
[16:32] go to the Lord together now this morning
[16:34] just in prayer and praise, rejoicing
[16:37] gladness. Lord Jesus, we're so glad for
[16:40] the opportunity we have to be together
[16:42] this morning. We're so grateful, Lord,
[16:44] that you've called us by your name in
[16:46] this hour, Lord. Lord, that you've
[16:48] you've made the choice to call us, Lord,
[16:50] that we can make the choice to answer
[16:51] that call. Lord, we pray for our pastor
[16:54] this morning as he brings the word from
[16:56] second Colossians chapter 2, not second
[16:59] Colossians. And Lord, that we just we're
[17:02] just so grateful just like those in
[17:04] Colass. We never saw Paul, but Lord, we
[17:07] believe the word that you sent through
[17:08] him, Lord, that you've manifested and
[17:10] brought forth in our lives today. Lord,
[17:13] continue to anoint the songs, the
[17:15] worship, the music. Lord, I thank you so
[17:18] much for those that are willing to be
[17:19] here and contribute to that gift. Lord,
[17:21] it's not a job no one is paid. Everyone
[17:23] is just doing out of love in their heart
[17:25] for you. We thank you for this
[17:27] opportunity we'll have to have
[17:28] fellowship this afternoon and and just
[17:30] enjoy some of the good things that
[17:32] you've brought forth on this good earth
[17:33] that you've given to us, Lord, to watch
[17:35] over. We pray for the uh offering this
[17:38] morning, Lord, that the whatever is
[17:40] received would be put to the use that
[17:42] you choose and desire for it. And we
[17:44] thank you in Jesus precious name. Amen.
[17:46] God bless you.
[17:52] You can all have your
[17:54] seats. A wonderful Savior is Jesus my
[17:57] Lord. He hideth my soul in the cliff of
[18:00] the
[18:02] [Music]
[18:04] rock. A
[18:07] wonderful
[18:09] Savior is
[18:11] Jesus my Lord.
[18:15] A
[18:17] wonderful
[18:19] Savior to
[18:23] me. He
[18:25] hideth my
[18:28] soul in the
[18:30] cliff of the
[18:32] rock where
[18:35] rivers of
[18:37] pleasure I see.
[18:43] He
[18:44] hideth my
[18:46] soul in the
[18:49] cliff of the
[18:51] rock that
[18:53] shadows a dry thirsty land.
[18:59] [Music]
[19:01] He
[19:02] hideth my
[19:05] life in the
[19:07] depths of his
[19:10] love and covers me there with his
[19:19] hand. And
[19:21] covers me
[19:23] there with his hand. Verse two.
[19:29] A
[19:31] wonderful
[19:33] Savior is
[19:35] Jesus my
[19:38] Lord. He
[19:40] taketh my
[19:43] burdens
[19:44] [Music]
[19:47] away. He's holding me up and I shall not
[19:55] be moved.
[19:58] He giveth me strength day by
[20:05] day. He
[20:07] hideth my
[20:09] soul in the
[20:11] cliff of the
[20:14] rock that
[20:16] shadows a dry
[20:19] thirsty land.
[20:24] He
[20:25] hideth my
[20:27] life in the
[20:30] depths of his
[20:32] love and
[20:34] covers me there with his hand.
[20:42] and
[20:44] covers me
[20:46] there with his hand with numberless
[20:51] blessings. With
[20:54] numberless
[20:56] blessings each moment he
[21:00] crowns and filled with his
[21:05] fullness divine.
[21:10] I sing in my
[21:14] rapture. Oh,
[21:16] gloryy to
[21:19] God for such a
[21:22] [Music]
[21:23] redeemer as mine.
[21:28] He
[21:30] hideth my
[21:32] soul in the
[21:34] cliff of the
[21:36] rock that
[21:39] shadows a dry
[21:42] thirsty land.
[21:46] He
[21:48] hideth my
[21:50] life in the
[21:52] depths of his
[21:55] love and covers me there with his
[22:04] hand and
[22:06] covers me
[22:09] there with his hand. One more one more
[22:12] verse. When clothed, when clothed in his
[22:18] brightness,
[22:20] transported, I
[22:23] rise to meet him in clouds of the sky.
[22:30] What a day. Oh, his
[22:34] perfect
[22:36] salvation, his
[22:39] wonderful love.
[22:42] I'll shout with the
[22:46] millions on
[22:50] high. He
[22:52] hideth my
[22:55] soul in the
[22:57] cliff of the
[22:59] rock that
[23:01] shadows a dry
[23:04] thirsty land.
[23:09] Oh, he
[23:11] hideth my
[23:13] life in the
[23:15] depths of his
[23:18] love and
[23:20] covers me there with his hand.
[23:25] [Music]
[23:28] and
[23:30] covers me
[23:32] there with his
[23:34] [Music]
[23:37] hand. Praise his name. Would you stand
[23:39] with me this
[23:44] morning? It's a very old song written by
[23:48] Fanny Crosby many years
[23:50] ago. We're going to sing an even older
[23:52] song written over over 3,000 years ago.
[23:56] Psalm 23.
[23:59] [Music]
[24:03] As brother Daniel gets ready to come,
[24:05] let's just worship him this morning.
[24:07] This is a song David himself wrote many,
[24:10] many, many years ago, probably before he
[24:11] was even
[24:13] king. And let's just invite the Lord to
[24:15] be with us, make him feel welcome so
[24:18] that Brother Daniel can come out, feel
[24:20] relaxed, feel liberty, and the Lord can
[24:22] move freely. Do you want that this
[24:23] morning? Want the Lord to move? Let's
[24:26] sing this together.
[24:30] The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not
[24:37] [Music]
[24:38] want in green pastures. He makes me lie
[24:46] down. He restores my
[24:51] soul and leads me on for his name.
[24:57] [Music]
[24:59] for his great name. You prepare a
[25:03] table. You prepare a table right before
[25:12] me in the presence of my eneies.
[25:20] Though the arrow
[25:24] flies and the terror of night is at my
[25:31] door. I trust you
[25:37] Lord. Surely
[25:42] goodness, surely
[25:47] mercy right beside me all my
[25:55] days. and I will dwell
[25:59] in your house
[26:03] [Music]
[26:05] forever and
[26:07] bless your
[26:09] holy name. Verse
[26:13] one, the Lord is my shepherd, I shall
[26:19] not want.
[26:23] And in green pastures he makes me lie
[26:30] down. He restores my
[26:34] soul and leads me on for his
[26:41] name. For his great
[26:44] name. You prepare a table.
[26:48] You prepare a table right before
[26:54] me. Yes. In the presence of my
[27:02] eneies. Oh, though the air
[27:06] flies and the terror of night is at my
[27:13] door. I'll trust you, Lord.
[27:19] Oh, surely
[27:22] goodness, surely
[27:27] mercy right beside me all my days.
[27:36] and I will dwell
[27:39] in your house
[27:43] [Music]
[27:44] forever and
[27:46] bless your
[27:48] holy
[27:52] name and
[27:55] bless your
[27:58] holy name.
[28:00] [Music]
[28:05] Amen. God bless you, brothers and
[28:09] sisters. While I have you standing,
[28:12] let's turn to
[28:16] Colossians, first
[28:18] chapter, I mean second chapter, I'm
[28:20] sorry.
[28:25] [Music]
[28:42] Colossians chapter 2, we'll read verse 1
[28:44] and
[28:51] two. It reads like this.
[29:01] For I
[29:02] would that you knew what great conflict
[29:05] I have for you and for them at
[29:07] Leodysia. And for as many as have not
[29:09] seen my face in the flesh, that their
[29:12] hearts might be comforted, being knit
[29:15] together in love, and unto all riches of
[29:19] the full assurance of understanding in
[29:22] the acknowledgment of the mystery of God
[29:25] and of the Father. and of Christ. Amen.
[29:28] Let's bow our
[29:30] heads.
[29:32] Father, pray that you'd be with us in
[29:34] this service, Lord.
[29:36] bless the reading of of your word,
[29:39] Father, and and may the spirit that
[29:45] anointed the Apostle Paul to pen this
[29:48] letter, may it be present with us today
[29:49] as as we read and expound on his word,
[29:54] on your word, Father, in Jesus name.
[29:57] Amen. You can be seated. God bless.
[29:59] Welcome to to join us for a meal. I told
[30:01] the church last I believe it was
[30:04] Wednesday that
[30:06] um the first pollock I know about was
[30:09] when a little boy brought his lunch to a
[30:13] great meeting um with the Lord Jesus
[30:17] there and they didn't have enough food
[30:20] and he brought his lunch and it was
[30:24] enough for all 5,000 people.
[30:29] So, we after that sermon, they had a
[30:32] potluck and after this sermon, we're
[30:34] going to have a potluck,
[30:36] too. I
[30:38] um I want to continue on in our um
[30:45] this Colossians book. It's uh it's it's
[30:49] really a
[30:51] tremendous letter that that Paul wrote
[30:53] to these these saints at Colasse. they
[30:57] were he had never met most of these
[31:00] people. They
[31:02] um it was a letter that he wanted to
[31:05] encourage them and he knew that his
[31:09] words meant a lot to these believers.
[31:11] So, one of the main reasons that he
[31:13] wrote this was for a
[31:15] warning and we're going to get into what
[31:18] that warning is in this second chapter
[31:21] of Colossians. He makes it very, very
[31:23] plain.
[31:24] I'll be reading from a number of
[31:27] different translations this morning.
[31:28] We'll stay with our our foundational um
[31:31] translation of the King James, but some
[31:33] of Paul's writings are hard to
[31:35] understand in the King James. So, I'll
[31:38] be reading from uh the New King James,
[31:40] the English Standard Version, New Living
[31:43] Translation. and u to make them a little
[31:45] bit more readable. Even Peter in his
[31:48] epistle, he said sometimes the things
[31:52] that Paul says, they're they're a bit
[31:54] hard to
[31:55] understand. But he said that and people
[31:59] that are unlearned and they don't
[32:02] understand, they they wrestle with these
[32:04] things that Paul says as they do with
[32:06] other scripture. So even even back way
[32:10] back when that Paul was he was very
[32:13] intellectual and he was a very educated
[32:16] man and very deep man. But even back
[32:20] then some of his writings were hard to
[32:22] understand. So we'll try to make them a
[32:24] little bit more
[32:26] simple in in this service today.
[32:31] We have to have a foundation of who Paul
[32:33] is to really understand what he is
[32:36] meaning in his epistles. Paul was a
[32:42] Pharisee, very
[32:45] welllearned young man, very well
[32:48] educated, educated under some of the
[32:51] greatest of all the teachers in Israel
[32:53] at that time. He understood the
[32:56] scriptures very well and he was very
[32:58] much into um enforcing the doctrine of
[33:04] the
[33:05] Pharisees. And when Paul had an
[33:07] experience with the Lord, he was on his
[33:10] way to this place called Damascus with
[33:14] writings in his hand, permission and
[33:18] orders to basically destroy these new
[33:22] Christians who were preaching heretical
[33:25] things. And he was on his way and the
[33:31] Lord struck him down, struck him blind.
[33:35] And he said these words. He says, "Saul,
[33:38] Saul, why persecutest thou me? It's hard
[33:42] for you to kick against the pricks." And
[33:45] then then Saul said, he says, "Lord, who
[33:48] are you?" And he says, "I am Jesus who
[33:50] you're
[33:51] persecuting."
[33:53] Paul understood then that he was wrong
[33:56] and he was going in the wrong direction.
[33:58] But he was also he was very sincere in
[34:01] in what he was
[34:02] doing. And it created a foundation in
[34:06] Paul that he
[34:08] understood both sides of the of of the
[34:12] fight here. He understood the Pharisees
[34:15] and he understood the the legalist. He
[34:18] understood how they thought and he also
[34:21] understood how these new Christians
[34:23] thought and the the spirit that was upon
[34:26] them. So he had a had a way of looking
[34:29] at things that was very very balanced.
[34:32] And
[34:35] Paul in his letters you can see that one
[34:38] thing that he hated was
[34:40] legalism more and more as as you read
[34:44] these scriptures you will see that he
[34:46] didn't like it. what he saw that as a
[34:49] way to for the enemy to separate
[34:53] people and he saw that it was nothing
[34:55] but a trick from the
[34:57] devil. Let's read that verse again and
[34:59] we'll start with chapter 2 in
[35:02] Colossians. For I would that you knew
[35:06] what great conflict I have for you and
[35:09] for them at Leodysia and for as many as
[35:11] have not seen my face in the flesh.
[35:15] Another translation says, "I want you to
[35:17] know how much I have agonized for you
[35:21] and for the church at Leodysa and for
[35:23] many other believers who have never met
[35:25] me personally." This is a real true
[35:28] heart of a missionary. You see this man,
[35:31] he may have never been to this city, but
[35:33] he had such a desire for these people,
[35:36] number one, to stay strong with the
[35:38] gospel. And number two, don't get off on
[35:42] these little isms and these little
[35:43] things that are going to come into the
[35:45] church. And Paul, it was just his
[35:47] burden. He loved these people. I've seen
[35:50] people with real genuine missionary
[35:53] callings in their life, and they are
[35:56] like that. They they think about those
[35:59] people that they go to. They think about
[36:01] them all the time and they they they
[36:04] would do anything to keep them from
[36:06] suffering or to keep them from going
[36:08] astray. And that's how this man Paul who
[36:10] was really the original one of the
[36:12] original missionaries. That's how he
[36:14] felt. Verse number two, that their
[36:16] hearts might be
[36:18] comforted being knit together in love
[36:22] and to unto all the riches of the full
[36:24] assurance of understanding to the
[36:27] acknowledgment of the mystery of God and
[36:30] of the Father and of
[36:33] Christ. It's beautiful. He's saying that
[36:35] that you you should be knit together in
[36:39] love. As I was contemplating on that
[36:42] this week and and meditating on those
[36:45] things, I I thought about what does it
[36:48] mean to be knit together in love? And
[36:52] Stephanie and I were given this this
[36:54] blanket by a dear friend. And if you
[36:57] look at here, you can see what goes in
[37:01] to this blanket that was knit for us.
[37:04] And you can see these different threads.
[37:06] There's I counted between 40 and 50
[37:08] individual threads. And if you look at
[37:10] them, each piece of yarn here is is
[37:13] basically worthless. It's it doesn't
[37:15] mean anything. But when the master takes
[37:18] this and puts it together
[37:22] and knits it all together, now you can't
[37:25] see a single piece of thread in this
[37:28] whole thing. It was put together by
[37:32] hands that knew what they were doing and
[37:35] knit this together in love. So it
[37:38] becomes one piece. You can't see an
[37:41] individual thread in the whole
[37:44] thing. And that's how a garment is. And
[37:46] that's how the body of Christ is. It's
[37:49] knit together in love. And which one of
[37:53] these threads is any more important than
[37:55] any other one. None of them are. But
[37:59] every one of them is needed. If you
[38:01] start pulling one out, you're going to
[38:03] ruin the whole thing. But when it comes
[38:07] together, it becomes really a
[38:10] masterpiece of God. And that's how Paul
[38:13] is saying that we should be. We should
[38:16] be knit together by the bonds of love,
[38:21] placed placed in this one body to where
[38:25] you can't even
[38:27] identify one from the other. Each one
[38:30] has a different color, each one has a
[38:32] different shape, whatever it is. But we
[38:35] are all we have to be have all of the
[38:38] threads together. And as I was looking
[38:41] at this and thinking about this
[38:43] blanket, I thought of um Marily, I've
[38:47] told the story of you doing puzzles
[38:48] before and and how it it's it's such a
[38:52] beautiful thing, a a puzzle when you put
[38:54] it together. Brothers, if you could put
[38:56] up that picture of
[38:58] Jesus and it's like it's like this that
[39:03] this is the body of Christ and you can
[39:06] see the different puzzle pieces in
[39:08] there. If you look at them, you can
[39:10] notice the separation and each puzzle
[39:12] piece is different than the other one.
[39:15] And one puzzle piece might look at this
[39:16] one and say, "Man, you're all wonk wonky
[39:19] and messed up. You you're not shaped
[39:20] like I am. You have different colors
[39:22] than I do." That's and this other piece
[39:25] would say, "Well, no, you're look bad.
[39:26] You don't look like me either." But when
[39:28] you put them all together, if they all
[39:30] look the same, it would be terrible. But
[39:33] if you put them together, it becomes a
[39:35] masterpiece.
[39:37] And what if and as I was looking at
[39:39] this, I thought, Lord, what if one of
[39:42] those pieces was taken out? If you go to
[39:46] the next picture, and I it ruins
[39:50] it. And that could be the body of Christ
[39:53] if any one of us friends is taken out.
[39:56] It looks like
[39:58] that. All of us have a place. All of us
[40:01] have a work to do. All of us have a gift
[40:04] that we bring into the church. And if we
[40:07] are not operating in that gift, if we
[40:09] don't care, if it's not important to us,
[40:11] this is how the body of Christ looks.
[40:13] It's
[40:15] imperfect. God created us to be in
[40:19] him. And this could be sin. This could
[40:23] be offense. This could be many, many
[40:26] different things that causes this to
[40:28] happen. Paul is saying, "Don't let it
[40:30] happen, friends. Be knit together in
[40:35] love. Be together in this. Love one
[40:39] another. There is strength. If I could
[40:42] take one of these pieces of yarn and I
[40:44] could break it. But you take two or
[40:47] three or or in this case, you take this
[40:49] whole strand, I could almost pull my car
[40:52] with it. It's so strong. That's how the
[40:55] body of Christ is is knit together
[40:58] perfectly in love. And that's what Paul
[41:00] is saying here. Thank you, brothers,
[41:01] that picture. That's what Paul is saying
[41:04] here. He's saying be together.
[41:08] In the previous chapter, he defines the
[41:10] mystery of God. And he says, "The
[41:13] mystery of God that has been kept hidden
[41:15] from ages and generations, but is now
[41:17] disclosed to the Lord's people. To them,
[41:20] God has chosen to make known among the
[41:22] Gentiles the glorious riches of his
[41:25] mystery." That mystery, the body of
[41:28] Christ. And what is that mystery? And he
[41:30] says, "It's Christ in you,
[41:33] the hope of glory."
[41:35] And Paul is writing to this group
[41:37] because he knows he this isn't his first
[41:40] rodeo. He knows what's going to happen
[41:43] because it seems to happen every every
[41:45] time. Verse number
[41:47] three, I'll read verse number two again.
[41:49] That their hearts might be comforted
[41:51] being knit together in love and unto all
[41:54] riches of the full assurance of
[41:56] understanding to the acknowledgment of
[41:58] the mystery of God and of the Father and
[42:00] of Christ. in whom are hid all the
[42:04] treasures of wisdom and
[42:07] knowledge. He told us in the previous
[42:09] chapter as I just said that the mystery
[42:11] of God was Christ in you. And here is
[42:15] where he says that all the treasures and
[42:17] wisdom of knowledge are hidden in
[42:20] Christ. So what is the purpose of this
[42:24] letter? Why is he writing this? Is this
[42:27] just a feel-good letter to be encouraged
[42:29] and keep serving the Lord? The people
[42:32] are already
[42:33] Christians. They have already given
[42:35] their heart to Jesus
[42:37] Christ. Why is he saying things like
[42:40] this in the previous chapter? Why is he
[42:42] saying things like Christ is the image
[42:45] of the invisible God, the firstborn of
[42:47] all creation? For by him were all things
[42:50] created in heaven and earth, visible and
[42:52] invisible, whether thrones or dominions
[42:54] or rulers or authorities. All things
[42:56] were created through him and for him.
[43:00] And he is before all things. He's
[43:03] talking about Jesus. And he is before
[43:05] all
[43:06] things. And all in him all things hold
[43:09] together. It's all knit together in him.
[43:13] And he is the head of the body, the
[43:15] church. He is the beginning, the
[43:17] firstborn from the dead. That in
[43:19] everything he he might be preeminent.
[43:24] For in him all the fullness of God was
[43:26] pleased to dwell. And through him to
[43:29] reconcile to himself, all things,
[43:31] whether on the earth or in heaven,
[43:33] making peace by the blood of his cross.
[43:36] He is laying the foundation. He's saying
[43:38] Christ, Christ, Christ. Look at Jesus.
[43:41] He is everything. He is the fullness of
[43:43] God. It's all about Jesus. So when he's
[43:46] writing this, he says that he is
[43:48] agonizing over this church of Colasse.
[43:50] And why is he constantly saying that
[43:53] Jesus must be the preeminent? Why is he
[43:55] saying that? Verse number four. And this
[43:59] I
[44:01] say, lest any man should beguile you
[44:04] with enticing
[44:06] words. He knew what was coming if it
[44:10] wasn't already there at Colossia.
[44:13] New Living Translation says, "I am
[44:15] telling you this so no one will deceive
[44:18] you with well-crafted arguments, joying
[44:21] and beholding your order and the
[44:23] steadfastness of your faith in Christ.
[44:26] You're doing well. I'm rejoicing over
[44:29] that you believe in this man Jesus. As
[44:32] ye have therefore received Christ Jesus
[44:34] the Lord, so walk ye in
[44:38] him, rooted and built up in him, and
[44:42] established in the faith as you have
[44:45] been taught, abounding therein with
[44:47] thanksgiving. Again, he's bringing the
[44:49] congregation back to Jesus every time.
[44:52] Back to Jesus.
[44:54] The New Living Translation of of that
[44:56] verse 7 says this, "Let your roots grow
[45:00] down into him and let your lives be
[45:04] built on him."
[45:07] Then your faith will grow strong in the
[45:10] truth. You were taught and you will
[45:13] overflow with thankfulness.
[45:16] He's saying, "Let those roots deep go
[45:20] deep down." I love trees and I plant
[45:24] trees in my yard and I just love the I
[45:26] love the way they look. I love the way
[45:28] they
[45:28] grow. And there's a at work sometimes I
[45:33] one of the studies that I've I've done
[45:35] is down on the San Pedro River in near
[45:38] Sierra Vista and they try to save the
[45:42] cottonwood trees that are down there. So
[45:44] they there'll be a fire, there'll be
[45:46] something happen and they will replant
[45:48] these these sapling cottonwood trees and
[45:53] they have to take care of that little
[45:55] sapling tree until those roots are able
[45:59] to go down deep and get to the
[46:03] groundwater that's not too far down
[46:05] there. But they have to be able for
[46:08] those roots to go down and tap that
[46:10] groundwater so they can start sucking
[46:12] that water out of that out of the
[46:14] ground. And if it gets dry and it
[46:17] doesn't and and the tree doesn't have
[46:20] water, that tree is going to die if its
[46:22] roots aren't down there in into the into
[46:24] the
[46:25] groundwater. And it takes time for that
[46:30] to happen. We think boom, just right
[46:33] away, I'm a Christian. Everything's
[46:34] good. Paul's saying, "No, your roots got
[46:36] to go down. They got to have time to get
[46:38] down and and get into that water of
[46:41] Christ, or else you'll just wither up
[46:44] and dry and dry and and go
[46:47] away." I was talking with the the person
[46:50] at the the nursery, the tree nursery the
[46:53] other day, and she was telling me that
[46:56] these trees that I bought that some of
[46:59] them take up to seven years to become
[47:02] established.
[47:04] That word established means that they
[47:06] can live on their own without me having
[47:09] to go and water
[47:11] them. Usually, brother David, you're
[47:13] probably an expert in this. It still
[47:16] takes years, no matter what tree
[47:18] generally, to become established to
[47:20] where it can go out and its roots go out
[47:22] and it can get its own water. It takes
[47:27] time. And what happens when that soil
[47:30] dries up and those roots aren't deep
[47:32] enough? That tree dies. It dies
[47:36] spiritually. Paul is saying let your
[47:40] roots go down to that water of Jesus
[47:43] Christ and start drawing on that. Then
[47:45] whatever drought comes, whatever
[47:47] problems come, you are drawing from
[47:50] Christ and not drawing from someone
[47:52] else.
[47:54] Rooted. Verse number seven again. Rooted
[47:56] and built up in him and established in
[47:59] faith as ye have been taught, abounding
[48:01] therein with thanksgiving as you have
[48:04] been
[48:06] taught. How can you be established in
[48:08] the faith if there is no sound teaching
[48:11] in your life?
[48:14] You just basically count on yourself.
[48:17] It's not what Paul's saying here. There
[48:20] are many many people that say, "Well, I
[48:24] just sit down and and I just get it for
[48:28] myself." That's in contrary to what Paul
[48:30] is saying here. You must have sound
[48:34] teaching so those roots can go down and
[48:37] get into that water. Beautiful story of
[48:42] this is Philillip in the Ethiopian.
[48:46] Philip, the Lord leads him out into the
[48:49] desert. Philip is is a deacon in the
[48:52] church right when the church started up
[48:54] in Jerusalem and he also had the calling
[48:56] in his life as an evangelist and he's
[48:58] going out. That's why friends once, let
[49:02] me go on a side note. A deacon in a
[49:06] church can have a ministry outside of
[49:11] just being a deacon. He doesn't have to
[49:13] be he doesn't have to have that. But a
[49:15] deacon can also be a minister outside in
[49:18] an evangelist and do evangelistic work.
[49:22] Perfectly acceptable in the Bible. And
[49:23] that's what Philillip was. So Philillip,
[49:26] he has this great revival. And then the
[49:30] Lord leads him out into the desert and
[49:33] he he goes out there and he sees this
[49:35] this important Ethiopian man and he's
[49:38] riding on his chariot and he's reading
[49:41] the book of
[49:43] Isaiah out loud. The Lord tells
[49:46] Philillip, "Go up there and go with that
[49:49] man." Philip jumps up onto his chariot.
[49:54] The man's reading the book of Isaiah out
[49:57] loud and Philip says, 'What are you
[50:00] reading? And the unic, the
[50:04] Ethiopian
[50:06] says, he says, "How can I
[50:11] understand unless someone guides
[50:13] me?" And he invited Philillip. He says,
[50:16] "Come up here and sit down on my chariot
[50:19] here." Now, the passage of the scripture
[50:21] was this. It was out of Isaiah. And he
[50:24] was reading he said he said listen to
[50:25] this like a sheep he was led to the
[50:28] slaughter and like a lamb before his
[50:31] sheer is silent so he opens not his
[50:34] mouth in his humiliation justice was
[50:36] denied him. Who can describe his
[50:38] generation? For his life is taken away
[50:42] from the
[50:43] earth. And the unic
[50:46] says who's he talking
[50:49] about? Is he talking about himself? Is
[50:52] the prophet Isaiah saying that I'm going
[50:54] to go through this or that I have I have
[50:56] gone through this or is he talking about
[50:58] someone else? And Philip says funny that
[51:01] you
[51:02] ask and he explains Jesus Christ to him
[51:08] and then that man that Ethiopian gives
[51:10] his heart to Jesus Christ right there
[51:14] with sound teaching. That's how
[51:17] important teaching is. It's not always
[51:20] the emotional um coming to the altar.
[51:23] Some people get it that way and that's
[51:25] good. Other people get it like opening
[51:28] up saying, "I don't understand this."
[51:32] And then the Holy Spirit will send a
[51:35] teacher, someone to explain this word to
[51:37] them.
[51:39] Now
[51:41] Paul, he's going to tell them right now,
[51:45] "Beware, lest any man spoil you, spoil
[51:49] you with philosophy and with vain
[51:50] deceit, after the tradition of men,
[51:53] after the rudiments of the world, and
[51:56] not after
[52:00] Christ." We talked about the religious
[52:02] deceivers.
[52:04] We talked about the these different
[52:06] people that can come in and cause
[52:10] problems.
[52:12] And now he's talking about this this man
[52:15] Paul. He's saying, "Beware lest any man
[52:17] spoil you through philosophy and vain
[52:19] deceit after the tradition of
[52:24] men and after the rudiments of the world
[52:26] and not after Christ." This is what
[52:29] Paul's saying. This is human thinking.
[52:32] He warned them before of of people that
[52:35] were going to come in with with these
[52:37] different doctrines. Now he's saying
[52:39] that after the tradition of men, after
[52:41] the rudiments of the world, and not
[52:42] after Christ. This is human thinking.
[52:44] Solomon said, "Lean not to your own
[52:48] understanding." Many of the things of
[52:51] Christ are taught completely backwards
[52:54] of our way of
[52:56] thinking. Jesus said, "Love your
[52:58] enemies."
[53:00] That doesn't make sense.
[53:02] What really happens is we devise what
[53:05] usually happens with our enemies is we
[53:07] devise a plan a plan in our mind and we
[53:10] say, "Well, if she says this and I'm
[53:11] going to say this," and then we make up
[53:13] this entire conversation in our minds of
[53:16] of how this conflict is going to go. But
[53:19] what we should really be doing is loving
[53:22] that person and saying, "Lord, how can I
[53:25] serve this person that I'm about to get
[53:27] in a fight with?" Amen.
[53:30] And we always win those arguments in our
[53:32] minds and it never comes out the way we
[53:34] think they are. They're they're going to
[53:36] do it. But then somebody that that
[53:39] doesn't really believe would say, "But
[53:41] okay, you're talking about that's how
[53:44] you should do it." But who really does
[53:46] that? Who really when they're about to
[53:49] get into an argument or are thinking
[53:51] about when somebody did them wrong, who
[53:53] really considers, Lord, how can I serve
[53:55] this person and how can I love this
[53:57] person? Who really does that? That's
[54:00] what the world might tell you. A
[54:01] Christian does that.
[54:06] Jesus
[54:08] said that he gave really no limit to
[54:12] forgiveness. Jesus Peter asked asked
[54:15] Jesus, he said, "How many times do I
[54:16] have to have to forgive this guy that's
[54:18] done me wrong? Do I have to forgive him
[54:20] seven times in a day?" And Jesus says,
[54:22] "No, 70 times seven."
[54:26] So this person 70 times seven times. I
[54:30] mean you barely even say that many words
[54:32] to somebody in a day. But 70 times seven
[54:36] somebody does you wrong in a in a day
[54:39] and you have to forgive them every
[54:41] single time. Who really does that? What
[54:44] the devil says? Yeah. But who really
[54:47] does that? That that's just that's just
[54:49] philosophy. That's just in in an ideal
[54:52] world. No. a
[54:54] Christian really does
[54:57] that. People say, "Well, I live my life
[55:00] by the Ten Commandments." I go back to
[55:02] the Old Testament and just just that
[55:04] those ten commandments, I can live my
[55:06] life by that. Jesus said, "You have
[55:08] heard that it was said in the days of
[55:09] old that you shall not
[55:11] murder. And whoever mur murders will be
[55:13] in danger of judgment. But I say to you,
[55:16] whoever is angry with his
[55:18] brother without a cause shall be in
[55:20] danger of judgment. And whoever says to
[55:23] his brother Raqqa that means you stupid
[55:26] person shall be in danger of the
[55:28] council. Whoever says you fool shall be
[55:31] in danger of hellf fire. But who really
[55:35] doesn't? Who really does that? Who
[55:37] really when somebody does something so
[55:39] awful and all? Who really lives up to
[55:43] that? That Jesus said a Christian lives
[55:46] up to
[55:47] that adultery. We know it's wrong to
[55:50] commit adultery. But Jesus said, "You
[55:52] have heard that it was said in those
[55:53] days of old that you shall not commit
[55:55] adultery. But I say to you that whoever
[55:57] looks on a woman to lust for her has
[56:00] already committed adultery with her in
[56:02] his
[56:03] heart. If your right eye causes you to
[56:05] sin, pluck it out and cast it from you.
[56:08] It is more profitable for one of your
[56:10] members to perish than for your entire
[56:12] body to be cast into
[56:13] hell. And if your right hand causes you
[56:16] to sin, cut it
[56:17] off and cast it from you. For it is more
[56:21] profitable for you that one of your
[56:23] members perish than for your whole body
[56:25] to cast be cast into hell. So if you
[56:28] desire to have an affair on your
[56:31] spouse, your husband or your wife and
[56:35] you are entertaining that thought, then
[56:38] you have already done
[56:41] it. You don't throw out the
[56:43] word because the word was made flesh.
[56:47] Friends, these things that Jesus said,
[56:50] he's his teachings are more strict than
[56:53] the Old Testament is. Oh, we think,
[56:55] well, there is grace in the New
[56:57] Testament. That is true, but it doesn't
[57:00] throw out the Old Testament.
[57:02] It's still there. Jesus was the
[57:05] fulfillment of that word. And the
[57:08] mystery that mentioned earlier that
[57:11] Christ in you, that's the mystery of
[57:13] God. That is this same Holy Spirit that
[57:17] is when you die to yourself and are
[57:20] reborn. This spirit is in you. And this
[57:23] spirit tells you what is right and what
[57:26] is wrong. It tells you what is sin and
[57:29] what is not sin. And you don't have to
[57:31] go through your checkbox and saying I'm
[57:32] allowed to do this, I'm not allowed to
[57:34] do that. We're going to get to that in a
[57:36] minute. And when someone tries to tell
[57:38] you that it doesn't matter how you live
[57:41] or that you don't need moral standards
[57:44] or that was the Old Testament and it
[57:46] doesn't matter today, then your roots
[57:50] need to go a little bit deeper and
[57:52] established and be established way down
[57:55] there in Christ and draw from his
[57:59] teaching. Paul said in Romans chapter 6
[58:01] verse one, he said, "What shall we say
[58:04] then? Shall we continue in sin that
[58:06] grace may abound? He said, God
[58:09] forbid. How How shall we that are dead
[58:12] to sin live any longer therein? Know ye
[58:16] not that so many of us as were baptized
[58:19] into Jesus Christ were baptized to his
[58:22] death? Therefore, we are buried with him
[58:25] in by baptism into death. that like as
[58:29] Christ was raised up from the dead by
[58:31] the glory of the father, even so we also
[58:35] should walk in the newness of life.
[58:39] The Bible preaches against sin. It pre
[58:42] preaches against lying. It pre it
[58:44] preaches against holding a
[58:47] grudge. It preaches against drunkenness.
[58:49] It preaches against drugs. It preaches
[58:51] against pornography, against
[58:53] homosexuality, against premarital sex,
[58:57] against gossip, against repeating a
[59:00] lie, no matter who that lie is about. It
[59:04] preaches against those things. It
[59:07] preaches against judging other people.
[59:09] Judge not that ye be not
[59:12] judged. That's one of the most misused,
[59:15] I think, verses in the Bible.
[59:19] You can't judge
[59:20] me. It doesn't say
[59:23] that. It says you don't judge somebody
[59:26] else.
[59:29] The New King James, Matthew 7:7 says,
[59:32] Jesus says, "Judge not that you be not
[59:34] judged. For what judgment you judge, you
[59:37] will be judged."
[59:39] And with the measure you use, it will be
[59:42] measured back to you. And why do you
[59:45] look at the speck in your brother's eye,
[59:47] but do not consider the plank in your
[59:49] own
[59:51] eye? You say, "I go to church and they
[59:54] judge me because the way I dress. I go
[59:57] to church and they judge me because of
[59:59] my tattoos. I go to jud church and they
[1:00:01] judge me because I use the English
[1:00:03] Standard Version rather than King James
[1:00:05] version." Jesus is not saying that no
[1:00:08] one can judge you. He's saying that you
[1:00:12] cannot judge
[1:00:14] them. You are judging them when you say
[1:00:18] those things. You are judging them. You
[1:00:22] are saying they're thinking this about
[1:00:25] me. You're you're judging them because
[1:00:28] you're using a different Bible and you
[1:00:30] want to use that Bible and you're
[1:00:32] thinking that they're looking down on
[1:00:34] you. You're doing what you accuse them
[1:00:37] of doing.
[1:00:39] So when we walk into church, and so many
[1:00:41] people do, I don't go to that church
[1:00:42] because they're judging me. Wait a
[1:00:45] minute. You're the one that judged them.
[1:00:50] So if you want to get past
[1:00:51] that, if I think Manny's judging me, go
[1:00:55] to
[1:00:56] Manny. Hey, brother Manny, God bless
[1:00:58] you. I just come here
[1:01:01] and got a bald
[1:01:05] head. And I know and I know that in the
[1:01:08] Bible, in the Old
[1:01:11] Testament, it says that a man shall not
[1:01:14] cut the back of his
[1:01:17] hair. Deuteronomy chapter 22, I believe
[1:01:20] it
[1:01:21] is. and he and say, you know, I just the
[1:01:25] reason I do
[1:01:27] this is because I just think it looks
[1:01:32] better. And then somebody might might
[1:01:35] say, well, it says, brother, it says
[1:01:36] right here in the Bible. And then we can
[1:01:38] just dig right into the Bible and say,
[1:01:41] okay, why does it say that? Well, the
[1:01:43] reason that it says that is because they
[1:01:45] were going over into the Canaanite land,
[1:01:47] and that was probably the way that they
[1:01:49] looked. It was a very worldly look back
[1:01:52] then. Braided
[1:01:54] hair in the New
[1:01:57] Testament. It meant something different
[1:02:00] back then than it means
[1:02:02] now. But don't accuse someone when you
[1:02:05] walk in. Don't accuse someone of judging
[1:02:09] you
[1:02:10] because they look different than you.
[1:02:14] Judging goes both ways, friends.
[1:02:18] Back to Romans chapter 6 verse
[1:02:21] 5. For we have been planted together in
[1:02:24] the likeness of his death, we shall also
[1:02:27] be in the likeness of his resurrection.
[1:02:29] Knowing this, that our old man is
[1:02:31] crucified with him, that the body of sin
[1:02:34] might be destroyed, that henceforth we
[1:02:36] should not serve
[1:02:38] sin. For he that is dead is freed from
[1:02:42] sin. Now if we be dead with Christ, we
[1:02:45] believe that we shall also live with
[1:02:47] him.
[1:02:50] There is an outward expression of Jesus
[1:02:55] Christ is we will represent him. Baptism
[1:03:00] friends is so important. It is such an
[1:03:03] important concept that not only are we
[1:03:06] making this public confession of God
[1:03:08] doing an inward work, but we are also
[1:03:11] making a commitment to God that we are
[1:03:14] going to be baptized. Lord, when I come
[1:03:16] out of this water, I am doing everything
[1:03:19] that I can to change. I want to
[1:03:22] represent Jesus Christ. I want the old
[1:03:24] Daniel Evans to die in that water and I
[1:03:27] want the new man to come forward.
[1:03:31] Let's go back to Colossians chapter 2
[1:03:33] verse
[1:03:37] 8. Lest any man spoil you spoil you
[1:03:40] through philosophy and vain dece deceit
[1:03:42] after the tradition of men after the
[1:03:44] rudiments of the world and not after
[1:03:46] Christ. He's saying that these logical
[1:03:49] arguments they might make sense but go
[1:03:53] back to what Christ said. Go back to the
[1:03:56] Bible. Go back to what it says. Don't
[1:03:58] just take it because it makes sense in
[1:04:01] your mind. Don't let the let the world
[1:04:04] explain these things
[1:04:08] away. For in him dwelleth all the
[1:04:12] fullness of the godhead
[1:04:14] bodily, the father, the son, the holy
[1:04:18] ghost, every manifestation of God, every
[1:04:22] bit of it dwells in Jesus Christ. He is
[1:04:26] God.
[1:04:28] That's why we're baptized in the name of
[1:04:30] in Jesus name. In the name of Jesus
[1:04:31] Christ. The book of Acts tells us to do
[1:04:34] it. And when we are baptized in that we
[1:04:37] are fulfilling Matthew 28:19 that says
[1:04:40] repent that says go into all the world
[1:04:43] preach the gospel baptizing them in the
[1:04:45] name of the father and of the son and of
[1:04:47] the holy
[1:04:49] spirit. Because in him dwells all the
[1:04:53] fullness in that name. and we take on
[1:04:55] that name in baptism. That name
[1:04:58] encompasses all those
[1:05:02] titles. Verse number 10, brother Josiah
[1:05:05] quoted this to me this
[1:05:07] morning. And you are complete in
[1:05:11] him which is the
[1:05:13] head of all principality and power in
[1:05:17] whom you are also circumcised with the
[1:05:19] circumcision made without hands. in
[1:05:21] putting off the body of sin of the flesh
[1:05:23] by circum the circumcision circumcision
[1:05:26] of Christ. Again, Paul is saying
[1:05:29] that that the anything goes
[1:05:33] doctrine that's just common today. Yeah,
[1:05:35] you can do anything as long as you
[1:05:37] believe Jesus. That philosophy is
[1:05:40] wrong. There are moral standards
[1:05:43] associated with being a Christian.
[1:05:46] Circumcision is cutting off the excess
[1:05:48] flesh. And that's what a Christian is
[1:05:50] constantly doing. They're constantly
[1:05:52] cutting off the sin in their life every
[1:05:55] day. Constantly cutting cutting trying
[1:05:58] to change and constantly improving,
[1:06:00] buried with him in baptism, wherein also
[1:06:03] ye are risen with him through the faith
[1:06:06] of the operation of God, who that ha who
[1:06:09] hath raised him from the dead. Baptism
[1:06:12] represents your commitment to a new
[1:06:14] birth.
[1:06:16] I'm going to change. I'm taking on the
[1:06:18] name of Jesus and becoming a new
[1:06:19] creation.
[1:06:23] And you being dead in your
[1:06:27] sins, and the circumcision of your
[1:06:31] flesh, hath he quickened together with
[1:06:34] him, having forgiven all your
[1:06:39] trespasses, blotting out the handwriting
[1:06:42] of the ordinances that was against us,
[1:06:44] which was contrary to us, and took it
[1:06:47] out of the way, nailing it to the to his
[1:06:51] cross.
[1:06:52] I love that
[1:06:54] part. My sins are nailed to the cross.
[1:06:59] It's a two, it's a really a typical New
[1:07:01] Testament statement. Don't sin. Live
[1:07:04] better. Cut off the things that are
[1:07:06] causing you to sin, but also know that
[1:07:08] Jesus has forgiven you of all your
[1:07:12] trespasses. You have been quickened
[1:07:14] together with him. You've been made
[1:07:16] alive, become alive together with him.
[1:07:19] He blotted out that
[1:07:21] transgression that once condemned us and
[1:07:24] nailed them to the
[1:07:27] cross. People, friends, people struggle
[1:07:30] with different things. All of us are
[1:07:32] created different. Like that puzzle I
[1:07:33] showed up there. Every piece is
[1:07:35] different. Every piece has strengths.
[1:07:38] Every piece has weaknesses. Some people
[1:07:42] don't think they do anything
[1:07:44] wrong. and we
[1:07:47] laugh, but it's hard to get to that
[1:07:50] person where they say, "I'm fine." You
[1:07:52] know, it doesn't condemn me. I remember
[1:07:55] I worked with a
[1:07:56] guy that he was my boss that
[1:08:00] uh was having an affair and his wife
[1:08:04] um with uh this woman at
[1:08:07] work. And I told him one time, I said uh
[1:08:12] his name's Greg. I said, "Greg," I said,
[1:08:16] what are you
[1:08:18] doing? And he said, he said, Dan, he
[1:08:20] says, I don't do anything. I'm not doing
[1:08:22] anything that keeps me up at
[1:08:24] night, man. And it kind of hurt me. How
[1:08:28] do you get to that person when they
[1:08:31] can't see that they're doing anything
[1:08:33] wrong? How do you get to that person
[1:08:35] that feels comfortable in the life that
[1:08:37] they're living? None of us should feel
[1:08:39] comfortable in the life that we're
[1:08:40] living. All of us are sinning and are
[1:08:43] falling short of God every day.
[1:08:47] And then there are
[1:08:48] others, and this is what this is
[1:08:50] speaking to. There are others that can't
[1:08:52] get past their sins. They look back
[1:08:55] years on things that they've done, and
[1:08:57] they can't understand that those sins
[1:09:00] are nailed to the cross with Jesus
[1:09:04] Christ. You've repented of those things.
[1:09:07] You've made those things right. You have
[1:09:09] a promise of God and and you have a new
[1:09:12] way of life. You've done everything that
[1:09:14] you can. Now get rid of those those
[1:09:17] ideas that you have that your sins can't
[1:09:20] be forgiven.
[1:09:22] It's a very I've seen I have known
[1:09:24] people that have committed
[1:09:26] suicide because they didn't they
[1:09:29] couldn't get past their past sins and
[1:09:32] they thought that they had sinned and
[1:09:34] they thought that they had blasphemed
[1:09:36] the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:38] There different people have different
[1:09:42] weaknesses. And you being dead in your
[1:09:45] sins, and the uncircumcision of your
[1:09:48] flesh, hath he quickened together with
[1:09:50] him, having forgiven you, forgiven you
[1:09:54] of all your trespa trespasses, blotting
[1:09:58] out the handwriting of the ordinances
[1:10:00] that was against us, which was contrary
[1:10:03] to us, and took out of the and took it
[1:10:07] out of the way, nailing it to his cross.
[1:10:09] And having spoiled principalities and
[1:10:12] powers, he made a show of them openly,
[1:10:16] triumphing, triumphing over them in it.
[1:10:25] I said that you're not to judge someone
[1:10:28] else, but now we are going to start
[1:10:31] talking about legalism as he as he moves
[1:10:33] into this and the people trying to get
[1:10:36] you to conform to their own
[1:10:40] philosophies. As I was meditating this
[1:10:42] on on Paul and knowing this book of
[1:10:46] Galatians and this book of Colossians
[1:10:48] and knowing Paul's attitude towards this
[1:10:50] and then thinking, Lord, I've always
[1:10:52] heard that Paul was a
[1:10:55] legalist. It's always been taught to me
[1:10:57] that Paul was a
[1:10:59] legalist. And then something said in my
[1:11:02] mind, that's right. Paul was a
[1:11:07] legalist. Was.
[1:11:10] And then when he met Jesus
[1:11:14] Christ, all of that legalism changed and
[1:11:18] now it was all a different
[1:11:22] perspective. One of
[1:11:25] Paul's central doctrines was legalism is
[1:11:30] wrong. Let no man therefore judge you in
[1:11:33] meat. I just said that nobody that that
[1:11:38] you can't judge anymore that anybody but
[1:11:41] now he's going to talk about legalism
[1:11:44] and he's going to say okay now don't let
[1:11:47] anyone judge you in legalism let no man
[1:11:51] therefore judge you in meat the Jewish
[1:11:53] tradition of kosher foods or in drink or
[1:11:56] in respect of a holy day honoring the
[1:11:58] feast days like um like the seventh day
[1:12:00] Adventist with we have to worship on
[1:12:03] Saturday and if you Don't do that.
[1:12:04] You're not a believer. He's saying,
[1:12:06] don't let someone judge you on that. Or
[1:12:08] of a new moon or of the Sabbath days
[1:12:10] which are a shadow of things to come.
[1:12:12] But the body is of
[1:12:15] Christ. You have to look at the meaning
[1:12:17] behind these things. He's saying that
[1:12:19] these things are a shadow that these
[1:12:21] things represented Jesus Christ in the
[1:12:24] Old
[1:12:25] Testament. But now they are manifest in
[1:12:28] this man Christ. Let no man beguile you
[1:12:30] of your reward in a voluntary humility
[1:12:33] and worship of angels, intruding into
[1:12:36] those things which he hath not seen
[1:12:39] vainly puffed up by his flesh, fleshly
[1:12:43] mind. Another warning to be careful what
[1:12:48] you believe and who you believe, no
[1:12:51] matter how humble they may seem.
[1:12:57] I'll stop here for a
[1:12:59] moment, friends. There are
[1:13:03] people, I mean, they're in this room
[1:13:07] now that have been deceived and hurt by
[1:13:13] that legalistic dominating spirit and
[1:13:17] scarred growing up, that controlling
[1:13:20] way.
[1:13:23] And these men, the Bible constantly
[1:13:26] prophesies, hey, they're coming and
[1:13:29] they're are going to try to pull you
[1:13:32] from the the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:13:35] and pull you from these teachings of
[1:13:37] Christ and make you believe something
[1:13:39] that may reference Christ, but it makes
[1:13:42] you believe something that is different
[1:13:44] than Christ taught.
[1:13:47] Every word pretty much in the New
[1:13:50] Testament points to
[1:13:52] Jesus. But they will come and they will
[1:13:55] try to take what this Bible says or or
[1:13:58] what somebody else says and they twist
[1:14:00] it and they make it to where there is
[1:14:02] something other than Christ. Christ plus
[1:14:06] something else or you can't be saved.
[1:14:10] And it is a very deceptive spirit that
[1:14:17] many have dealt with and that are still
[1:14:20] dealing with because it hurts. And when
[1:14:23] you try to come out of that, there's
[1:14:25] such a fear that rests upon you, such a
[1:14:29] weight, and it's terrifying.
[1:14:36] not
[1:14:37] holding the
[1:14:39] head from which all the body by the
[1:14:42] joints and bands have nourishment
[1:14:45] ministered and knit together increasing
[1:14:48] increases with the in increase of God.
[1:14:51] It's all about Christ. Wherefore if you
[1:14:54] be dead with Christ from the rudiments
[1:14:57] of the world, why as though living in
[1:15:00] the world you are subjects to
[1:15:03] ordinances. He's talking about rules and
[1:15:06] regulations
[1:15:07] here. We have to have rules in the
[1:15:09] church. Obviously, we, you know, no
[1:15:12] eating and drinking in the sanctuary.
[1:15:14] Dress appropriately for church out of
[1:15:16] respect. Please, the the brothers don't
[1:15:18] wear hats in church. Um, don't speak out
[1:15:22] during church. Don't cause a
[1:15:24] disturbance. These are to keep the
[1:15:27] sanctity of the sanctuary and keep order
[1:15:30] in the church. Paul is not talking about
[1:15:33] those things right
[1:15:34] here. He's talking about
[1:15:37] legalism. A legalist, when the legalist
[1:15:40] reads the Bible or listens to a sermon
[1:15:45] with his or he reads it or he listens to
[1:15:48] that sermon with his or her doctrines in
[1:15:51] mind and he's trying to find evidence to
[1:15:55] further their doctrines. That's how a
[1:15:58] legalist thinks. So when you you read
[1:16:01] your
[1:16:02] Bible, are you looking for correction
[1:16:05] for yourself or are you looking for
[1:16:06] justification for yourself? Are you
[1:16:09] looking for for something to further
[1:16:12] your own way of thinking or are you
[1:16:14] looking to really get closer to Christ?
[1:16:16] A legalist is looking or listening for
[1:16:20] certain things and then those certain
[1:16:23] things they will use them to deceive
[1:16:27] others. Not
[1:16:28] knowingly but just because that's what
[1:16:31] they do. That's that's a legalist way.
[1:16:35] Many, as I said, or most people really
[1:16:39] in this room have either lived our lives
[1:16:42] that
[1:16:43] way or have battled to overcome this, me
[1:16:47] included in that. And then he goes on,
[1:16:51] he says, "Touch not, taste not, handle
[1:16:53] not, which all things are to perish with
[1:16:56] us with the using after the commandments
[1:16:59] and the doctrines of men." Don't do
[1:17:02] this. Don't do that. He's talking about
[1:17:04] Jewish traditions here, but I'm talking
[1:17:06] about our
[1:17:08] traditions. New Living Translation says,
[1:17:10] "Don't handle, don't touch, don't don't
[1:17:12] taste, don't touch." Such rules are mere
[1:17:15] human teachings about things that
[1:17:17] deteriorate as we use
[1:17:20] them. One of the things that I teach is
[1:17:23] it doesn't m it's it's not what you
[1:17:26] don't do for God that matters.
[1:17:29] It's it's what it's doing the things
[1:17:32] that Jesus taught. We're always looking
[1:17:35] at the sin in our lives and we're always
[1:17:37] trying to get rid of the sin and and and
[1:17:40] it might be drinking. It might be
[1:17:41] smoking. It might be it might be saying
[1:17:44] the wrong words. It might be gossiping.
[1:17:46] But you're not looking at the root of
[1:17:48] the problem when you're looking at the
[1:17:49] sin. The root of a pro of the problem is
[1:17:52] we need a closer walk with the Lord. And
[1:17:55] once we get that closer walk with the
[1:17:57] Lord, as that walk progresses, as those
[1:18:01] roots go down in and get into they tap
[1:18:04] down into that water, then as that water
[1:18:07] comes up and now we start feeding on the
[1:18:09] things of Christ, those sins just start
[1:18:12] dropping off.
[1:18:14] They start going away.
[1:18:18] And it's not looking at the sin. It's
[1:18:21] not looking at the smoking. It's not
[1:18:22] looking at at the the lying. It's not
[1:18:25] looking at that. Now, we're looking at
[1:18:27] Christ and we'll find that it just falls
[1:18:28] off.
[1:18:31] What we need is we need the baptism of
[1:18:33] the Holy Spirit. And people, they look
[1:18:36] back and they say, "Well, I got the
[1:18:37] baptism of the Holy Spirit when I was 12
[1:18:39] years old. Praise the Lord. I went to
[1:18:40] the altar. I spoke in tongues or I had
[1:18:43] this experience." And then I look back
[1:18:45] to that and that is my typos. That's
[1:18:47] good. But have you had the baptism of
[1:18:49] the Holy Spirit today? Have you had it
[1:18:52] this week? Have you had it this year?
[1:18:55] And if we have that way of thinking that
[1:18:57] I got it back then, then it goes against
[1:19:00] what Paul said when Paul says I died
[1:19:02] daily.
[1:19:04] I I am not what I should be. Even the
[1:19:07] apostle Paul says, I have not attained
[1:19:09] it yet. But he is working and he is
[1:19:12] moving towards that. And if we just get
[1:19:15] stuck in the way that we are and we are
[1:19:17] satisfied with the person that we are,
[1:19:20] we are not moving in Christ. We are not,
[1:19:23] our roots are not down into that water
[1:19:26] of Jesus Christ and filling us with that
[1:19:29] strength that comes from him every
[1:19:31] single
[1:19:33] day. We can't be satisfied with the
[1:19:36] person that we are. Don't handle, don't
[1:19:39] taste, don't
[1:19:41] touch. Such rules are human teachings
[1:19:44] about things that deteriorate as we use
[1:19:46] them is what a one of the translations
[1:19:48] of the Bible says.
[1:19:52] Watch things which things we have need,
[1:19:55] which things we have indeed, and show of
[1:19:58] wisdom in will
[1:20:00] worship and humility and neglecting of
[1:20:04] the body, not in any honor to the
[1:20:07] satisfying of the flesh. New Living
[1:20:10] Translation says, "These rules may seem
[1:20:13] wise because they require strong
[1:20:17] devotion, pious
[1:20:21] self-denial, and severe bodily
[1:20:24] discipline. But they provide no help in
[1:20:27] conquering a person's evil
[1:20:31] desires." Wow.
[1:20:34] All of this that we do, all of the rules
[1:20:37] that we keep, I'm gonna stop. I'm going
[1:20:39] to stop doing this, Lord. I'm gonna
[1:20:43] stop whatever it might
[1:20:46] be. But what we need to do is
[1:20:50] start. Stopping is good, but start
[1:20:55] getting closer to God.
[1:20:59] Start seeking that Holy Spirit. I
[1:21:03] received the Holy Spirit when I was 20
[1:21:05] years old. I
[1:21:08] friends. Me
[1:21:10] too. But it doesn't change that we need
[1:21:13] an infilling every day. It doesn't
[1:21:16] change that we need more of the Holy
[1:21:18] Spirit all of the time. There is a time
[1:21:21] when that Holy Spirit comes down and we
[1:21:24] are a changed person. But that is just
[1:21:27] it really is just the beginning.
[1:21:30] More and more and more we need to seek
[1:21:33] God. We need those roots to really go
[1:21:36] down and get into that water and then
[1:21:39] start
[1:21:41] drawing from the Lord Jesus Christ every
[1:21:44] day or we will die and we won't know
[1:21:47] it. We'll get
[1:21:49] stuck. Day will go by.
[1:21:53] Year will go by. Decades will go by and
[1:21:57] we'll find that, wow, I'm the same
[1:21:58] person I was 20, 30 years
[1:22:01] ago. What's
[1:22:03] wrong? Why am I not continually seeking
[1:22:06] him? The musicians can come and we'll
[1:22:08] close. I was talking with some brothers
[1:22:12] yesterday. I ministered in um El Paso at
[1:22:16] a convention yesterday and I was telling
[1:22:19] some brothers
[1:22:21] afterwards, why do such
[1:22:26] miracles follow new
[1:22:30] believers? Why is it why do we see so
[1:22:33] many great things happen to people that
[1:22:36] just give their hearts to the Lord? Like
[1:22:38] we uh Manny's cousin that that gave that
[1:22:40] testimony on Sunday. Why is it a new
[1:22:43] believer that has such a powerful
[1:22:46] testimony and not those of us that are
[1:22:49] just constantly we're doing right, we're
[1:22:50] not doing this, we're not doing that.
[1:22:52] It's because that person is a has a
[1:22:54] humble desire for more of God and that's
[1:22:57] the one that God deals with.
[1:23:00] Why is that? We should be constantly
[1:23:04] feeling the presence of the Lord.
[1:23:06] Constantly being in the work of the
[1:23:08] Lord, constantly doing the works of God,
[1:23:10] both spiritually and and uh
[1:23:15] earthly. We should always be abounding
[1:23:18] in the work of the
[1:23:20] Lord and not be satisfied with the
[1:23:23] person that we are. And Paul in this
[1:23:25] letter he is warning listen these people
[1:23:29] will come in and they will give you good
[1:23:32] arguments. They will give you good
[1:23:34] explanations of the word and how this
[1:23:36] fulfills the word and that fulfills the
[1:23:38] word and and you are the elect and the
[1:23:40] chosen because you believe this way. And
[1:23:42] then the spirit is taken out because it
[1:23:44] takes out that desire to serve God. And
[1:23:47] then the world will do the same thing.
[1:23:49] the world will come in and say, "Oh,
[1:23:50] well, but who really does what Jesus
[1:23:53] taught? Who really loves their enemies?"
[1:23:57] A Christian does.
[1:24:00] And I really, that's why Jesus said,
[1:24:02] "Straight is the gate and narrow is the
[1:24:06] way and few there will be that find it."
[1:24:11] Is because the enemy will teach us so
[1:24:13] often to be satisfied in the person that
[1:24:16] we are. and we won't truly be seeking
[1:24:18] God all of the time. I love this Apostle
[1:24:22] Paul. He said, "I die
[1:24:26] daily." He said, "Those things that I
[1:24:28] hate, that's what I
[1:24:30] do. And the things that I should do, I
[1:24:33] don't do those
[1:24:35] things." And this is really the greatest
[1:24:37] man on earth at the
[1:24:39] time. But do you see the humility in him
[1:24:43] and how he wanted to serve God? And he's
[1:24:46] writing to this church at Colassia, not
[1:24:49] knowing them. They had never met him. He
[1:24:52] was in prison. He couldn't come to them.
[1:24:54] And he's writing and he's saying, "Be
[1:24:57] careful." I see it over and over. I was
[1:25:00] a Pharisee. I know the way that they
[1:25:02] think. They want you to conform to their
[1:25:05] way of thinking. But God has a garment
[1:25:10] that he has knit together as I showed
[1:25:12] earlier. And every strand in that that
[1:25:16] garment is perfect. Every strand in that
[1:25:19] body is perfect. But it has to be knit
[1:25:22] together by the master.
[1:25:24] It has to be him that puts it together.
[1:25:27] Otherwise, you look at here and
[1:25:29] everyone's just a little piece of yarn
[1:25:30] and it doesn't mean anything. the the
[1:25:33] puzzle that I showed up there with the
[1:25:35] missing piece. That's what it becomes
[1:25:37] when it's not perfect in Christ and it
[1:25:41] has to be focusing on that man Jesus.
[1:25:44] And people will come in, brother
[1:25:46] Jonathan, they try to pull you away from
[1:25:48] Christ and pull you to
[1:25:50] themselves and they deceive
[1:25:53] man and it might make sense.
[1:25:57] The legalism might make sense, but it
[1:26:01] draws you away from
[1:26:03] God and it draws you to the teaching of
[1:26:06] man. Paul
[1:26:08] says, "Don't let him do
[1:26:12] it." Crying out, he says, "Oh," he says,
[1:26:15] "I agonize over you. I know what's
[1:26:18] coming. Don't let him do it. Stand
[1:26:21] strong in Jesus Christ. Let those roots
[1:26:24] go down into Christ, into that water,
[1:26:29] and then he knits it together. And you
[1:26:32] can't even, Sister Hope, you can't even
[1:26:33] see a piece of yarn in that in that
[1:26:35] blanket that you knitted for us. It's
[1:26:38] all just
[1:26:39] perfect and that's the way it should be.
[1:26:42] And that puzzle that you see, you can
[1:26:43] see some little pieces and stuff and
[1:26:45] everything is just perfect together, but
[1:26:47] you take one of the pieces out and it
[1:26:49] ruins the whole thing. knit together in
[1:26:53] love. Brother
[1:27:03] [Music]
[1:27:08] Josiah, we bow our
[1:27:12] hearts. We bend our knees.
[1:27:17] Oh spirit come make us
[1:27:22] [Music]
[1:27:25] humble. We turn our
[1:27:29] eyes from evil
[1:27:33] things. Oh Lord, we cast down our idols.
[1:27:38] Let's sing that
[1:27:41] again. We bow our hearts.
[1:27:46] We bend our
[1:27:49] knees. Oh spirit come make us
[1:27:55] [Music]
[1:27:57] humble. We turn our
[1:28:01] eyes from evil
[1:28:05] things. Oh Lord we cast down our
[1:28:10] idols. Give us clean hands.
[1:28:15] Give us pure hearts.
[1:28:18] [Music]
[1:28:20] Let us not lift our souls to Oh, what
[1:28:24] beautiful words. Let us not lift our
[1:28:26] souls to another. Give us clean hands.
[1:28:29] Yes.
[1:28:31] Give us pure hearts.
[1:28:35] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[1:28:41] We're going to sing verse one again.
[1:28:42] Would you stand?
[1:28:46] We bow our hearts. We bow our
[1:28:52] hearts. We bend our
[1:28:56] knees. Oh spirit, come make us
[1:29:02] humble. Oh, we turn our
[1:29:07] eyes from evil things.
[1:29:12] Oh Lord, we cast down our
[1:29:17] idols. Give us clean
[1:29:20] hands. Give us pure
[1:29:25] hearts. Let us not lift our souls to
[1:29:32] another. Give us clean
[1:29:35] hands. Give us pure hearts.
[1:29:41] Let us not lift our souls to
[1:29:46] another. Oh God, let us be a
[1:29:51] generation that
[1:29:54] seeks, seeks your
[1:29:57] face. Oh God of
[1:30:01] Jacob, oh God, let us be a
[1:30:06] generation that seeks.
[1:30:10] seeks your
[1:30:12] face. Oh God of
[1:30:19] Jacob. Friends, let me say
[1:30:22] this. I skipped over it in my notes, but
[1:30:26] Josiah singing that
[1:30:29] song,
[1:30:31] it just brought me back to these
[1:30:34] [Music]
[1:30:36] scriptures. And it
[1:30:40] says verse number seven, rooted and
[1:30:43] built up in
[1:30:45] him,
[1:30:47] established in the faith as you have
[1:30:50] been taught, abounding there with
[1:30:54] thanksgiving. And he had just said in
[1:30:57] verse number four, he said, "This I say,
[1:30:59] lest any man beguile you with enticing
[1:31:02] words."
[1:31:04] These words, they may sound
[1:31:07] right, but they can be deceptive.
[1:31:09] Friends, our roots need to go down, down
[1:31:14] into that love of Jesus Christ, down
[1:31:17] into what Christ taught, the whole
[1:31:20] Bible's about him. And when we
[1:31:24] take someone's
[1:31:27] words and we make them
[1:31:31] infallible, we are worshiping another
[1:31:35] god outside of Jesus Christ. There has
[1:31:40] never been an infallible man other than
[1:31:43] that one man that was born in Bethlehem
[1:31:48] and died at Calvary.
[1:31:51] And if we take someone else's words and
[1:31:54] lift them up to scripture, friends, we
[1:31:58] are borderline idolatry. That doesn't
[1:32:02] mean we don't quote great men of God
[1:32:04] like brother Brandham. That doesn't mean
[1:32:06] that we don't do those things. But don't
[1:32:10] let someone come to you and and bring
[1:32:14] quotes and bring different ideas and
[1:32:18] pull you away from what Jesus Christ
[1:32:21] taught. As I said, every word in this
[1:32:24] Bible is about him because he is God.
[1:32:29] He was in the beginning. All things were
[1:32:32] made by him. All things were made for
[1:32:34] him. He is the almighty God and he is
[1:32:38] the one we
[1:32:39] worship. And Paul is reaching out to
[1:32:42] these Colossians and he's saying, "It's
[1:32:45] coming,
[1:32:46] friends. Don't fall for
[1:32:50] it." I'm looking forward to talking to
[1:32:52] those
[1:32:53] Colossians and saying, "What was the
[1:32:56] story when you read that letter? Was it
[1:32:59] already there or did it come
[1:33:01] later? What was it?" And they might tell
[1:33:05] us, you know, that brother
[1:33:07] Paul, he agonized for us. He loved us so
[1:33:12] much. And his words were our typost to
[1:33:17] stay tied to Jesus Christ. And you know
[1:33:21] what? Our roots went down. And once they
[1:33:23] reached that water, we just kept
[1:33:26] drawing. If it rained, it rained. It was
[1:33:28] good. If it didn't rain, it was fine. We
[1:33:30] had a water source there. and that Holy
[1:33:32] Spirit in Jesus Christ the Messiah.
[1:33:38] Oh, give us clean
[1:33:41] hands and give us pure hearts.
[1:33:47] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[1:33:54] Give us clean hands.
[1:33:58] Give us pure
[1:34:01] hearts. Let us not lift our souls to
