[27:34] [Music]
[27:36] way thank you so much good
[27:42] evening if there were only one book in
[27:46] the Old
[27:47] Testament I suspect it would either be
[27:50] Psalms which we'll sing from later this
[27:53] evening or
[27:55] Genesis everything really does begin in
[27:59] this
[28:00] book and 13 of its 50 chapters fully 1/4
[28:06] of the entire book revolves around a
[28:09] young man named
[28:11] Joseph to start our first Wednesday
[28:14] evening of the new year what could be
[28:15] more appropriate than a study from a
[28:17] main character from the first
[28:19] book so this evening and for several
[28:22] Wednesday nights God willing we'll delve
[28:25] into this portion of Genesis and follow
[28:29] the life of
[28:32] Joseph Joseph whose life is is a type
[28:35] which is another way of saying that his
[28:38] life models that of Christ see what
[28:41] lessons he has for us but first let's
[28:46] approach the author the one who inspired
[28:48] its contents
[28:50] together Lord Jesus once again
[28:53] it's it's an awesome thing it's a
[28:56] fearful thing the responsibility to
[28:59] Stand Here Lord to break your word but
[29:01] we're breaking it together the bread of
[29:03] life Lord that we might partake not just
[29:06] the bread of life but the Water of Life
[29:09] Lord we are looking to you this evening
[29:11] Lord that you would fill our hearts just
[29:14] as we sang Lord that you'd answer
[29:17] questions in our minds Lord just fill
[29:19] those vacancies Lord and draw us ever
[29:22] closer to you and ever greater
[29:23] appreciation for your word for what you
[29:26] have done for us what you continue
[29:28] continue to do for us Lord forgive us
[29:30] Lord each one Lord where we fall short
[29:32] Lord forgive me Lord I know in many ways
[29:36] even today that I've done things that
[29:38] haven't pleased you place those under
[29:41] the blood of Jesus Christ Lord and for
[29:43] the sake of your people tonight Lord
[29:45] please Lord forgive me and let your word
[29:49] come forth and into our hearts and take
[29:51] root and spring forth and bring life we
[29:54] thank you in Jesus precious name amen
[30:00] you may be
[30:01] asking why are we studying not not only
[30:05] the Old Testament but the first book of
[30:08] the Old Testament shouldn't we be
[30:09] digging deeper into the into the New
[30:12] Testament dissecting various doctrines
[30:14] and so forth after all we're Christians
[30:17] we're not practitioners of
[30:20] Judaism well to answer let's turn to our
[30:24] opening verses to the last book written
[30:27] by the Apostle Paul PA a pastoral letter
[30:29] to a young man named Timothy and if you
[30:33] uh I I think you probably got it as you
[30:35] came in but there's a handout that has
[30:37] some of the images that I'll be sharing
[30:39] tonight and a list of all the scriptures
[30:41] in the order in which we'll be
[30:43] presenting them if you have that great
[30:45] if not on the way out get one um how old
[30:48] you need to be to get one if you can
[30:50] read you're old enough if you can enjoy
[30:52] the pictures you're old
[30:55] enough so here we go second Timothy
[30:59] 3 we're told all scripture is given by
[31:04] inspiration notice it doesn't say
[31:07] dictation it says inspiration of God and
[31:11] is profitable for Doctrine for reproof
[31:16] for correction for instruction in
[31:18] righteousness that the man of God may be
[31:20] perfect thoroughly furnished unto all
[31:22] good
[31:24] works what is
[31:26] Doctrine what is men Me by
[31:29] reproof what is instruction in
[31:33] righteousness another translation reads
[31:36] the complete Jewish Bible in this case
[31:38] all scripture is God breathed and is
[31:42] valuable for teaching the truth Doctrine
[31:46] convicting of sin reproof correcting
[31:50] faults correction training in right
[31:54] living righteousness thus anyone the the
[31:57] Greek word translated man in the King
[32:00] James version is not a gender specific
[32:02] word it's like today saying they or them
[32:05] thus anyone who belongs to God may be
[32:09] fully equipped for every good work
[32:13] please be
[32:15] seated Paul is speaking of the Hebrew
[32:18] Bible which we call the Old
[32:20] Testament we've just finished touring
[32:22] that collection of writings over a
[32:24] period of some 15
[32:26] months with Paul's perspective of the
[32:28] Hebrew Bible in mind let's see how we
[32:31] can find and apply these four traits in
[32:34] our lives in the 21st century so we may
[32:39] be better equipped for every good work
[32:41] as we've recently been and are being
[32:43] taught from the Epistle of
[32:46] James why not study a a lesser character
[32:49] like Reuben or Judah it turns out you
[32:53] can't tell the stories of either of
[32:55] these two without Joseph
[32:58] the story of Jacob the third patriarch
[33:00] is also entwined with Joseph so it it
[33:04] seemed better to investigate Joseph and
[33:06] we'll see how Ruben and Levi and Judah
[33:09] and Jacob
[33:11] fit tonight we'll get off to a slow
[33:14] start because there's so much Foundation
[33:16] to lay so much context to absorb don't
[33:21] despair let me start by giving you a
[33:24] very brief synopsis overview of the
[33:27] story of Joseph
[33:29] this this will help give you context as
[33:31] we Flash Forward and Flash backward in
[33:33] time during our study but
[33:36] fact rather than me let's let another
[33:39] Deacon a fellow named Stephen summarize
[33:42] Joseph for us as he defends himself
[33:45] before the Sanhedrin Council in
[33:47] Jerusalem Stevens is the longest sermon
[33:52] in the book of Acts it's about a
[33:54] thousand words the other sermons in the
[33:56] book of Acts don't exceed about 400
[33:59] and in this longest sermon in the book
[34:01] of Acts he includes a succinct overview
[34:04] of the life of Joseph acts 7 starting at
[34:08] verse eight I'll read from the from the
[34:13] ESV and God gave Abraham the Covenant of
[34:17] circumcision and so Abraham became the
[34:19] father of Isaac circumcised him on the
[34:22] eighth day he was the first one to be
[34:24] circumcised on the eighth day and Isaac
[34:26] became the father of Jacob and Jacob of
[34:28] the 12 Patriarchs the TW sons from
[34:31] Reuben on down to Benjamin and the
[34:34] Patriarchs in this case meaning some of
[34:36] Joseph's older brothers jealous of
[34:39] Joseph sold him into Egypt but God was
[34:43] with Joseph and rescued him out of all
[34:46] his afflictions gave him favor and
[34:49] wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt who
[34:52] made him ruler over Egypt and over all
[34:55] Pharaoh's household
[34:57] now there came a famine throughout all
[35:00] Egypt and Canaan and great Affliction
[35:04] and our fathers he's meaning ancestors
[35:07] could find no
[35:08] food but when Jacob heard that there was
[35:11] grain in Egypt he sent our fathers on
[35:15] their first
[35:16] visit and on the second visit Joseph
[35:20] made himself known to his brothers and
[35:23] Joseph's family became known to pharaoh
[35:26] and Joseph sent and summoned Jacob his
[35:28] father and all his Kindred 75 persons in
[35:31] all and Jacob went down into Egypt and
[35:35] and he died he and our
[35:39] fathers and they were carried back to
[35:41] Shaham and laid in the Tomb that Abraham
[35:44] had bought for a sum of silver from the
[35:46] sons of hamor and
[35:48] sheim now in that overview I was going
[35:51] to leave out verse
[35:53] 16 but it brings up something that I
[35:55] think we should talk about it applies to
[35:58] almost every aspect of Bible
[36:01] study and that concerns the
[36:04] reliability of the Bible Steph's
[36:08] statements in verse 16 are incorrect
[36:11] they're wrong Jacob's remains were
[36:13] carried back to heon not sheum we find
[36:15] that out in Genesis 50 and place it into
[36:18] tomb Abraham bought from Ephraim the
[36:19] hittite not the sons of himore that's in
[36:22] Genesis 23 Jacob bought land and shakum
[36:25] from the sons of hore that's Genesis
[36:28] 3 wait a minute if all scripture is
[36:32] inspired of God why is there definite
[36:35] error
[36:37] here does this mean that for example the
[36:40] New Testament shouldn't be considered
[36:41] inspired scripture for the
[36:44] Christian I've read several arguments
[36:47] people trying to interpret this verse of
[36:50] Steven's defense and align it somehow
[36:52] with the accounts in Genesis and
[36:54] exodus to me frankly it's a lot of hand
[36:58] waving it's
[37:01] distraction my take and it's my take it
[37:04] could be incorrect is that Luke is
[37:06] accurately reporting in Acts 7 what
[37:09] Steph said but what Steph said is just
[37:12] that what Stephen said Stephen's not
[37:16] authoring a letter or a book he's in a
[37:19] court which had hired people to lie
[37:21] about him so they could prosecute and
[37:23] execute him Steven's under extreme
[37:26] duress in his defense defense knowing
[37:28] he's almost certainly facing a very
[37:30] unpleasant death and he misstates some
[37:33] history that tells us that Stephen was
[37:37] human just like you certainly like me
[37:41] several times I've said something over
[37:42] this Pulpit from my notes and afterward
[37:44] Heather says uh well you said such and
[37:48] such but didn't you mean thus and
[37:50] so I I'm sure I didn't say that I go
[37:53] back and hear the recording and sure
[37:55] enough under no more duress than I am am
[37:58] now certainly less than Steven was I
[38:01] made a misstatement was completely
[38:02] ignorant of
[38:04] it for me this example of step's error
[38:08] in Act 7
[38:09] reinforces the accuracy the reliability
[38:13] the dependability of the Bible Luke
[38:15] didn't go to some pains to edit what he
[38:17] was told Stephen said oh Stephen
[38:19] couldn't have said that I'll just fix it
[38:20] over here he reported it accurately
[38:23] including its errors just like he
[38:26] reports Peter in up some scriptures in
[38:28] Acts chap 1 when the 11 disciples are
[38:30] going about to a point of replacement
[38:32] for
[38:33] Judas is this discrepancy in Acts 7 with
[38:37] what God recorded in Genesis and exodus
[38:39] an indication the Bible's
[38:41] unreliable or is it instead an
[38:44] indication that we can trust it I think
[38:47] it's all consistent with 2 Timothy 3:16
[38:50] And1 17 that we read for our opening
[38:52] verses the Bible is not about coverups
[38:57] it's about honesty it's about accuracy
[39:01] it's about real people in real
[39:04] situations in real life not comic book
[39:08] superheroes but people like
[39:13] us well back to an overview of
[39:16] Joseph Joseph did not practice Judaism
[39:19] that religion wouldn't exist until Mount
[39:21] Si about 360 years after Joseph's death
[39:25] he knew nothing of its laws rules rules
[39:28] regulations we know that he was a
[39:30] believer in one God but we have no idea
[39:33] how he worshiped there's no record of
[39:36] him offering a sacrifice there's not
[39:38] even a record of him praying it doesn't
[39:42] mean that he didn't do either of these
[39:43] things just that they're not
[39:45] recorded there's no mention of Joseph
[39:48] having a supernatural experience like
[39:50] meeting an angel but but he knew his dad
[39:53] Jacob had wrestled with an angel Joseph
[39:55] was six or seven years old at that that
[39:57] time and he sees his dad go out in the
[40:00] evening and he comes back with a limp
[40:03] after that
[40:04] encounter he knew his dad and his
[40:07] granddad Isaac had seen Visions his
[40:09] great-grandfather Abraham had
[40:11] Supernatural experiences which
[40:12] undoubtedly had been told to Joseph and
[40:14] his siblings by Grandpa Isaac and papa
[40:18] Jacob well with that as an
[40:21] overview let's start now our story at
[40:24] Genesis chapter 37 and the first
[40:29] verse and Jacob dwelt in the land
[40:31] wherein his father Isaac was a stranger
[40:35] and the land of
[40:36] Canaan these are the generations the
[40:39] descendants of Jacob it's a little
[40:42] peculiar Genesis 36 talks about the
[40:44] descendants of Esau and L A whole bunch
[40:45] of people begat so and so and yada y y
[40:48] but here it says we're going to talk
[40:50] about the generations of Jacob Joseph
[40:52] was
[40:54] 17 okay he was feeding the flock with
[40:57] with his Brethren and the lad
[41:00] emphasizing his youth was with the sons
[41:03] of bilha and with the sons of zilpa his
[41:06] father's wives and Joseph brought unto
[41:08] his father their evil
[41:12] report well we have to ask
[41:14] ourself where's
[41:16] Canan who are bilha and
[41:19] zilpa how many wives did Jacob have how
[41:22] many sons and
[41:25] daughters this map shows a general area
[41:28] where Joseph was raised and born the
[41:31] city of Haron is highlighted in the
[41:33] upper right Heron's the town where laan
[41:35] lived Genesis 29:4 and Jacob stayed and
[41:39] worked for him for about 20 years he
[41:41] married had 12 of his 13
[41:45] children it's within the region of
[41:48] padanaram it'll say Jacob went to
[41:50] padanaram you're saying heran haran a
[41:52] city padanaram bu the areas like Tucson
[41:55] and Pima County in the modern world this
[41:59] is the Kurdish area in Northern Syria
[42:02] Southeast turkey near the border with
[42:04] Iraq I've also circled the area of Canan
[42:07] near the center of the screen where
[42:09] Jacob and his family lived after they
[42:11] left heran and it's a setting of our
[42:13] story in Genesis
[42:17] 37 for fun here's the same information
[42:20] plotted on a photo of that entire region
[42:23] from space the same photo I used in the
[42:26] title slide be making more use of this
[42:28] photo as we proceeded with the story of
[42:31] Joseph I'm a space nerd I'd like photos
[42:34] from space I I admit
[42:37] it this slide shows the relationships in
[42:40] Jacob's family Leia and Rachel were his
[42:44] wives zilpa and bilha were his wives
[42:47] slaves sometimes called
[42:49] handmaidens the numbers above the son's
[42:51] names are the order in which they appear
[42:54] in Genesis 30 as they were
[42:56] born the children's names in bold font
[42:58] Ruben Simeon Levi Judah Dina Joseph
[43:03] Benjamin are mentioned by name in
[43:06] Joseph's story there's overlap and
[43:09] intertwining after the first four so the
[43:11] exact order of sons 5 through1 is
[43:13] unclear in other words isachar number
[43:16] nine there may have been born before
[43:18] Asher number eight and Gad number seven
[43:22] there could have been born before nef
[43:23] tally number six we we don't know but we
[43:26] do know the first four and we know that
[43:27] Joseph was definitely the
[43:30] 11th Benjamin is the youngest by perhaps
[43:35] 15
[43:36] years Joseph being 17 in Genesis 372
[43:41] means that Ruben the oldest would have
[43:43] been
[43:44] 24 Dina would have been about Joseph's
[43:47] age 16 or 17 Benjamin somewhere between
[43:51] age one and age three when Joseph was
[43:55] 17 now finally some commentators have
[43:57] said well the the evil report and
[43:59] mentioned to the report was evil it
[44:01] wasn't accurate Joseph was a spoiled
[44:04] brat he was a tattle tale and he made
[44:05] things up and told his dad um I don't
[44:09] think that that really fits too well
[44:10] with the character of Joseph myself I
[44:13] doubtedly he was somewhat spoiled being
[44:15] that he was his father's
[44:19] favorite Genesis 373 we read now Israel
[44:23] and that's the other name for Jacob the
[44:25] name Israel he got when he wrestled with
[44:26] the Angel and started limping Israel
[44:29] loved Joseph more than all his children
[44:32] because he was a son of his old age
[44:34] Jacob was about 91 years old when Joseph
[44:37] was born and he was about 105 when
[44:40] Benjamin was born Joseph being one of
[44:43] his last sons was a reason but probably
[44:45] not the only reason and Jacob made
[44:48] Joseph a coat of many
[44:52] colors a little bit like Laurel's dress
[44:55] many colors
[44:57] well other translations say a long
[45:00] sleeved robe or an ornate or beautiful
[45:03] tunic or robe well oh we don't know the
[45:05] exact nature of the Garment the point is
[45:08] that it was unique within the family and
[45:11] it was a kind of an in yourface
[45:13] Declaration of Joseph's special position
[45:16] with his dad Jacob in fact it may well
[45:20] have been the symbol that Joseph was now
[45:22] the one that would possess the
[45:24] birthright rather than Reuben at Jacob's
[45:26] death death a code of authority if you
[45:30] will recall that Jacob convinced his
[45:33] brother Esau to give up his Birthright
[45:37] and later schemed with his mother
[45:38] Rebecca to steal Esau's blessing from
[45:40] Isaac we'll get to the reason for the
[45:42] transfer the birthright from Reuben to
[45:45] Joseph A little later this evening verse
[45:48] four when his Brethren saw the special
[45:51] coat placed on Joseph that their father
[45:53] loved him more than all his Brethren
[45:55] they hated Joseph
[45:58] could not speak peacefully to him
[45:59] couldn't say
[46:04] shalom some or all of the 10 older
[46:07] brothers hated
[46:10] Joseph and a perhaps the root cause was
[46:13] Jacob's obvious favoritism
[46:17] preference recall when Jacob and his
[46:19] twin Esau were kids their father Isaac
[46:23] always preferred Esau over Jacob no
[46:26] matter what Jacob did Isaac preferred
[46:31] Esau I wonder how that made Jacob feel
[46:34] go
[46:35] Esau I don't think so I think it hurt
[46:38] here we see that Jacob has become what
[46:41] he must have despised a dad playing
[46:44] favorites inflicting upon his 10 older
[46:47] Sons the same pain he felt in his
[46:50] younger years so
[46:54] sad six of Jacob's sons were born of L
[46:57] his first wife a woman he didn't
[47:00] love married to Jacob the deceiver
[47:04] through an act of deception perpetrated
[47:08] on Jacob by Leia's father laan laan was
[47:12] a brother of Jacob's mom Rebecca who
[47:16] perpetrated a deception on her husband
[47:18] Isaac to secure Esau's blessing for
[47:23] Jacob the webs we weave
[47:26] let's flash back about 25 years to Jacob
[47:31] and padanaram he's been there seven
[47:34] years working for laan for seven years
[47:37] to win Rachel's hand in marriage his
[47:40] maternal uncle and now father-in-law
[47:42] laan substituted his older daughter Leia
[47:45] for Rachel on the wedding night and
[47:47] Jacob somehow didn't notice until the
[47:50] following
[47:51] morning Jacob agreed to work another
[47:53] seven years for Rachel but was allowed
[47:55] to marry her only one week after
[47:58] marrying Leia let's look briefly at
[48:00] Genesis 29 again we're building
[48:02] Foundation
[48:03] here and Jacob went in also unto Rachel
[48:07] and he loved also Rachel more than Leia
[48:10] and served with his father-in-law laan
[48:12] yet seven other years to pay for Rachel
[48:15] seems the girls had little choice or
[48:19] voice in the
[48:20] matter and when the Lord saw that Leia
[48:23] was loved less than Rachel no it's not
[48:26] what it says saw that Leia was hated by
[48:32] Jacob not just an absence or a lesser
[48:36] degree of love but the presence of
[48:41] hatred he opened her womb implying she
[48:44] otherwise might have been Barren but
[48:46] Rachel was Barren because the Lord did
[48:49] not intervene for
[48:51] her we read that Leia
[48:55] conceived and Bar
[48:57] son and she called his name Reuben see a
[49:01] son that's what it means for she said
[49:03] surely the Lord has looked upon my
[49:06] Affliction he had now therefore because
[49:09] I bore him a son my husband will love me
[49:12] he
[49:13] didn't she conceived again and bear a
[49:17] son and said because the Lord has heard
[49:19] that I was hated he's therefore given me
[49:22] this son also and she called his name
[49:25] Simeon shimo
[49:27] means
[49:30] hearing she conceived again and bear a
[49:32] son and said now this time will my
[49:35] husband be joined unto me because I have
[49:37] borne him three sons therefore his name
[49:40] was called Levi
[49:44] attached but Jacob still hated
[49:47] her she conceived again and bear a
[49:52] son and she said now will I praise the
[49:57] Lord therefore she called his name Judah
[50:01] means praised or celebrated and left
[50:04] bearing for a short time after all she
[50:07] birs three more children all seven
[50:10] within seven years she's pregnant for 63
[50:12] out of 84
[50:14] months verse
[50:17] 35 is the first time the word praise
[50:21] ures in the
[50:23] Bible associated with Judah
[50:27] Leia was hurting of course she wanted
[50:30] her husband to love her the first three
[50:32] names are in the context of her focus on
[50:35] her personal pain now my husband will
[50:38] love me now God has heard me
[50:40] now but with Judah she overcame her
[50:45] pain maybe she just gave up on Jacob
[50:47] ever loving her and she found her
[50:49] comfort and her hope in the
[50:53] Lord It's a good lesson for us it's a
[50:55] good lesson for this guy right here Paul
[50:59] admonishes husbands over and over again
[51:03] to love their
[51:06] wives did I hear any brother say amen I
[51:08] know I heard some of the ladies say that
[51:11] okay thank you brother back to Jacob and
[51:14] his preference for
[51:16] Joseph when Jacob was coming to meet
[51:18] Esau after fleeing from him 20 years
[51:21] earlier to sojourn in panaram he was
[51:24] afraid look how we arranged es his
[51:27] family as they come into Canaan Genesis
[51:29] 33:1 Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked
[51:32] and behold Esau came and with him
[51:36] 400
[51:38] men Bo so many men this can't be
[51:43] good Jacob divided the children unto
[51:46] Leia andto Rachel and the two handmaids
[51:48] billot and Zila he put his children with
[51:50] their respective mothers and he put the
[51:53] handmaids and their children foremost in
[51:55] the front and Leia and her children
[51:59] after and Rachel and Joseph hindermost
[52:03] oh all go out in front but but if Esau
[52:06] attacks he'll have to kill BHA and Zila
[52:09] and their kids first then fight his way
[52:12] through Leia and her daughter and
[52:14] another six Sons giving Rachel and
[52:17] Joseph the best chance to
[52:19] escape I hope my guys stay in fight but
[52:22] yikes Esau the angry Hunter has an army
[52:25] of 400 100 o o
[52:29] o even then Joseph was the
[52:33] favorite let's go back to our story and
[52:35] heon with 17-year-old Joseph and his
[52:38] special
[52:43] coat Joseph dreamed a dream and he told
[52:47] it his Brethren and as a result they
[52:51] hated him yet the more increased their
[52:56] hatred fed their hatred he Joseph said
[52:59] to them here I pray you this dream which
[53:02] I have dreamed behold we were binding
[53:04] sheaves in the field and lo my my sheath
[53:07] arose and stood upright and behold your
[53:10] sheaves stood
[53:12] round and made obedience to my
[53:17] sheath this seems a little weird they
[53:20] Shepherds not
[53:22] Farmers but as we'll see the time will
[53:25] come when they do Bow Down and it's
[53:26] because they need Joseph's
[53:30] green his Brethren said to him shalt
[53:34] thou indeed Reign Over Us shalt thou
[53:36] indeed have dominion over us and they
[53:40] hated him yet the more for his
[53:42] dreams and for his
[53:45] words you get the picture Joseph was not
[53:48] loved by his older
[53:51] brothers and Joseph dreamed yet another
[53:54] dream and told it his brother Brethren
[53:57] and said behold I've dreamed to dream
[54:00] more and look the Sun and the Moon and
[54:04] 11 stars made obedience to
[54:09] me one wonders why Joseph shared these
[54:11] dreams sharing certainly wouldn't help
[54:13] their
[54:14] relationship but it does help fuel the
[54:17] fires of their
[54:20] hatred and he told it to his father and
[54:23] to his Brethren and his father Jacob
[54:25] scolded Joseph and said unto him oh what
[54:28] is this dream thou H has dreamed shall I
[54:31] and thy mother and thy Brethren indeed
[54:33] come to bow down ourselves to thee to
[54:36] the
[54:37] Earth and his Brethren hated him yet the
[54:40] more no that's not what it says it says
[54:44] his Brethren envied
[54:48] Joseph but his father observed kep in
[54:50] mind pondered the saying after all you
[54:52] can't make yourself dream a particular
[54:54] dream I don't know if any of you can I
[54:56] can't I can't go to bed and say oh I
[54:58] just want to dream tonight about thus
[54:59] and
[55:01] so doesn't work for
[55:03] me so what happened his brothers hated
[55:06] him more and more but after the second
[55:08] dream while they still hated Joseph as
[55:11] we'll see they now envied him they were
[55:17] jealous this is the first mention of
[55:19] Envy regarding Joseph it's immediately
[55:22] after the telling of the second
[55:24] dream there are no comments recorded
[55:26] from their brothers this
[55:28] time what's going
[55:31] on let's Flash Forward 13
[55:35] years Joseph is in Egypt Pharaoh has had
[55:38] two dreams and he's disturbed by them
[55:42] his court dream interpreters are
[55:44] perplexed and can't help him we'll
[55:47] understand that when we get to that part
[55:48] of the story a few lessons from now
[55:51] Joseph is summoned and Pharaoh tells him
[55:54] the dreams we'll skip to dreams for now
[55:57] Joseph said to Pharaoh the dream of
[56:00] pharaoh is one God has showed Pharaoh
[56:03] what he is about to do then he
[56:06] interprets the dreams skipping to verse
[56:08] 32 and for that the dream was doubled
[56:11] unto Pharaoh twice it is because the
[56:13] thing is established by God and God will
[56:16] shortly bring it to pass so the cultural
[56:19] belief at least among Jacob's family is
[56:22] right here two dreams close together the
[56:25] same topic expressed differently were
[56:28] accepted to mean that number one the
[56:30] dreams are from God and second they will
[56:34] be fulfilled soon that's the reason
[56:37] Jacob gave to Pharaoh that's what the
[56:39] brothers had to have been thinking
[56:41] that's why they envied him so the
[56:44] brothers hearing Joseph's dream theme of
[56:46] bowing to them has been repeated would
[56:48] take this to me the dreams are from God
[56:50] would soon be fulfilled they no longer
[56:52] challenge him about the topic shall we
[56:54] indeed bow down to you and instead
[56:56] there's Envy
[56:58] jealousy looks like we will not only
[57:01] does Jacob favor Joseph it seems God
[57:05] does
[57:07] too back to chapter
[57:09] 37:12 and Joseph's Brethren went to feed
[57:13] their father Jacob's flock in
[57:16] sheim the map inset shows heon in the
[57:20] lower Red Box where the family currently
[57:23] lives and shakum in the upper red box a
[57:26] distance of about 50
[57:28] miles shakam has a conflicted history
[57:31] with the family they settled there
[57:34] fairly soon after they arrived in Canaan
[57:36] back in Genesis 33 Jacob purchased a
[57:39] parcel of land they're Shepherds the
[57:42] pastor must have been good in that area
[57:44] around sheam but the family now lives in
[57:48] Hebron if the pastor is good in Sheck
[57:50] why did they relocate to
[57:53] heon well there's a couple of reasons
[57:55] but let's take a look back at sheim a
[57:57] few years earlier things had not gone
[57:59] well for them when they were in sheam
[58:01] let's read Genesis
[58:03] 34 Dina the daughter of Leia which she
[58:06] bear unto Jacob went out to see the
[58:09] daughters of the land she's a teenager
[58:12] Jacob apparently has no qualms for her
[58:14] safety to Let Her Go by herself into
[58:16] town they've lived in the area for years
[58:19] it's unlikely that this is Dina's first
[58:21] time going to see her friends in town by
[58:24] herself but this time
[58:26] when shakam the son of hamor The Hite
[58:29] Prince of the country saw her he took
[58:32] her he seized her and lay with her and
[58:34] defiled
[58:36] her Dina was the seventh child born of
[58:39] Leia in seven years making her about the
[58:41] same age as Rachel's son
[58:43] Joseph this violence against her
[58:46] occurred before Joseph was 17 and before
[58:48] Benjamin was born so it's likely she was
[58:51] 14 or 15 making this some two or three
[58:55] years before Joseph has his dreams and
[58:57] seven or eight years after their arrival
[59:00] in Canaan the attack is wholly
[59:05] unexpected after seizing and forcing
[59:07] himself on her sheam the prince says he
[59:10] wants to marry Dina he asks and her
[59:12] brothers say okay but our culture
[59:16] requires that all the men of the Town
[59:18] must be circumcised first this is our
[59:21] tradition you have to comply with that
[59:23] if you want to marry her
[59:26] verse 24 unto hore and unto sheim his
[59:29] son after they related the demand from
[59:32] Dina's brothers that the men must be
[59:34] circumcised in order for diner to marry
[59:36] the prince they hearkened they they
[59:37] heard and agreed and all that went out
[59:40] the gate of his City every male was
[59:43] circumcised all that went out of the
[59:44] gate of his City in other words the men
[59:47] not not the young
[59:48] boys it came to pass on the third day
[59:53] when they were
[59:54] sore you want to imagine and those
[59:56] knives were overly sharp that two of the
[59:58] sons of Jacob Simeon and
[1:00:01] Levi Dina's Brethren took each man his
[1:00:05] sword Came Upon the city boldly and
[1:00:08] killed all the
[1:00:10] men those that had been
[1:00:13] circumcised Simeon and Levi weaponized
[1:00:17] the symbol of the Covenant God made with
[1:00:20] Abraham that Covenant was that Abraham's
[1:00:23] descendants through Isaac were to be a
[1:00:26] blessing to All
[1:00:29] Nations bad move
[1:00:32] boys they slew hamor and sheam his son
[1:00:35] with the edge of the sword took Dina out
[1:00:36] of sheck's house and went out and the
[1:00:39] sons of
[1:00:42] Jacob some of the other Sons we don't
[1:00:44] know which ones Came Upon This Lane and
[1:00:47] spoiled the city they took stuff they
[1:00:49] robbed because the shechemites had
[1:00:51] defiled their
[1:00:53] sister Jacob's sons took the shechemites
[1:00:56] sheep and their oxen and their asses and
[1:00:59] that which was in the city and that
[1:01:01] which was in the field they they
[1:01:02] stripped the place they took everything
[1:01:04] all their wealth all their little ones
[1:01:06] and their wives they took captive and
[1:01:08] spoiled took robbed even all that was in
[1:01:11] the
[1:01:13] house and
[1:01:15] Jacob said to Simeon and
[1:01:17] Levi you have troubled me to make me
[1:01:23] stink a note here little a little
[1:01:27] sidebar if you
[1:01:28] will often when the Bible says God was
[1:01:31] angry the literal translation of God's
[1:01:34] anger is nose of God off
[1:01:38] Yahweh this is why a stench in that
[1:01:41] culture was synonymous with
[1:01:44] bad we might say oh you make me look bad
[1:01:47] and they would say you make me smell
[1:01:50] bad I don't know how that works in an
[1:01:52] Agricultural Society but but apparently
[1:01:55] it's a really bad smell it's it's why
[1:01:58] our prayers are often compared to
[1:02:01] incense why the burnt sacrifices were
[1:02:04] described as a sweet smelling Savor why
[1:02:08] the mixture of ingredients and various
[1:02:10] oils and bombs were critical to get the
[1:02:12] correct fragrance make the nose
[1:02:16] happy you make me to stink among the
[1:02:19] inhabitants of the land among the
[1:02:21] Canaanites and the perizzites and being
[1:02:24] few in number they'll ga GA themselves
[1:02:26] together against me and and slay me I
[1:02:29] I'll be
[1:02:30] destroyed I am my house you idiots we're
[1:02:34] all going to be
[1:02:37] killed and Simeon and Levi said should
[1:02:40] he deal with our sister as with an
[1:02:43] Harlot and that's the end of chapter 34
[1:02:47] this problem in sheum a couple of
[1:02:49] significant things happen in the family
[1:02:51] that we should cover before returning to
[1:02:54] Joseph Jacob never forgot and apparently
[1:02:57] never forgave Simeon or Levi flashing
[1:03:02] forward some 50 years on his deathbed
[1:03:04] Jacob tells
[1:03:07] him Simeon and Levi are our Brethren
[1:03:11] instruments of Cruelty are in their
[1:03:14] habitations oh my
[1:03:16] soul come not thou into their secret un
[1:03:21] their unto their assembly mine honor be
[1:03:24] thou not United for in their anger they
[1:03:27] slew a man and in their self-will they
[1:03:29] dig down a
[1:03:31] wall dig down a
[1:03:33] wall King James is a really strange
[1:03:36] translation here the complete Jewish
[1:03:38] Bible and others read similarly let me
[1:03:41] not enter their councel let my honor not
[1:03:44] be connected with their people for in
[1:03:47] their anger they killed men and at their
[1:03:50] whim they maimed
[1:03:53] cattle hamstrung disabled crippled oxen
[1:03:57] wantan in
[1:03:59] cruelty cursed be their anger for it was
[1:04:03] fierce and their wrath for it was cruel
[1:04:07] I will divide them in Jacob I'll scatter
[1:04:09] them in
[1:04:10] Israel scatter them in Israel centuries
[1:04:14] later the descendants of Levi became the
[1:04:17] priests and in service to the Tabernacle
[1:04:19] and eventually the Temple of the Lord
[1:04:20] their inheritance after the conquest of
[1:04:23] Canaan some 450 years after Jacob utters
[1:04:26] these words was that they were to be
[1:04:28] scattered in tiny settlements throughout
[1:04:30] the land the tribe of VII didn't have a
[1:04:32] chunk of land they had a town here and a
[1:04:34] town here and a place here and a place
[1:04:37] there scatter them in
[1:04:40] Israel another lesson our actions have
[1:04:46] consequences but but look at the grace
[1:04:49] of God Moses the greatest Prophet until
[1:04:52] Jesus was descended from Levi
[1:04:57] another clue about the reliability of
[1:05:00] the Bible Moses is the guy who wrote
[1:05:03] Genesis he could have easily made Levi
[1:05:05] look good be a hero or had Jacob bless
[1:05:08] him and not mention the specific
[1:05:10] participation in the slaughter at
[1:05:12] Sheck but he
[1:05:14] didn't and in God's grace the descendant
[1:05:17] of Levi became the greatest
[1:05:19] Prophet Levi was a violent cruel man in
[1:05:24] the midst of a family no one would want
[1:05:25] to
[1:05:26] emulate yet this
[1:05:29] family they were God's chosen these
[1:05:33] brothers with hatred in their hearts
[1:05:35] Paul had a general comment that should
[1:05:38] encourage us give us hope when we look
[1:05:40] at ourselves at least it does for me
[1:05:43] when I consider the mess that I am 1
[1:05:45] Corinthians
[1:05:50] 1 there we
[1:05:52] go Paul writes for you see your calling
[1:05:55] Brethren how that not many wise men
[1:05:58] after the flesh not many
[1:06:01] mighty not many noble are
[1:06:04] called but God hath chosen the foolish
[1:06:07] things of the world to confound the wise
[1:06:10] God hath chosen the weak things of the
[1:06:13] world to confound the things which are
[1:06:16] Mighty and base things of the world and
[1:06:20] things which are
[1:06:21] despised hath God
[1:06:24] chosen yay and things which are not to
[1:06:27] bring to not things that are that no
[1:06:31] flesh should glory in his
[1:06:35] presence God chooses us so he can show
[1:06:39] his
[1:06:40] strength his patience his kindness not
[1:06:46] ours It's All About
[1:06:49] Him chapter 34 ended with Jacob in fear
[1:06:53] for his life after the slaughter at
[1:06:55] sheam chapter 35 opens with God telling
[1:06:58] Jacob to go to bethl the family leave
[1:07:00] sheam
[1:07:03] immediately and they
[1:07:05] journeyed and even though they smelled
[1:07:08] bad the terror of God was upon the
[1:07:11] cities that were round about them and
[1:07:13] they did not pursue after the sons of
[1:07:17] Jacob God intervened even after this
[1:07:20] violent cruel act in sheam he protects
[1:07:23] them from the rage surrounding in the
[1:07:25] surrounding towns so Jacob came to L
[1:07:28] which is in the land of Canaan that is
[1:07:30] bethl he and all the people that were
[1:07:32] with him God Appears to him there
[1:07:34] changes his name to Israel they leave
[1:07:37] bethl and as they approach Bethlehem
[1:07:39] Rachel goes into labor and delivers
[1:07:43] Benjamin she dies in child birth and is
[1:07:46] buried there just outside Bethlehem they
[1:07:49] continue a short distance and stay near
[1:07:51] the mcdal D near Bethlehem for a Time
[1:07:56] Israel journeyed we read and spread his
[1:07:59] tent beyond the Tower of
[1:08:01] idir and it came to pass when Israel
[1:08:04] dwelt in that land which wasn't very
[1:08:07] long Reuben went in and lay with bilha
[1:08:10] his father's Kink
[1:08:11] concubine and Israel heard
[1:08:15] it this seems a very stupid thing to
[1:08:19] do what were you thinking
[1:08:22] Reuben like Simeon and Levi Jacob never
[1:08:25] forgave Reuben as Jacob Lay Dying he
[1:08:27] says to reuben reuben you're my
[1:08:30] firstborn my might the beginning of my
[1:08:34] strength the Excellency of
[1:08:36] dignity the Excellency of
[1:08:39] power unstable as water Thou shalt not
[1:08:43] Excel because thou wentest up to thy
[1:08:45] father's bed thou defiles this he went
[1:08:49] up to my
[1:08:53] couch the best explanation I I have
[1:08:55] found for this
[1:08:57] action goes back to Jacob loving Rachel
[1:09:01] and hating
[1:09:03] Leia Rachel would have been the first
[1:09:05] wife and shared Jacob's tent and bed
[1:09:08] when she died it appears that Jacob had
[1:09:12] bilha Rachel's slave move
[1:09:15] in a reminder of Rachel Reuben would
[1:09:19] have been incensed that his father would
[1:09:21] promote a slave over his mother and
[1:09:24] Jacob's first wife
[1:09:27] Leia so he forces himself on bilha
[1:09:30] defiling her and thereby forcing Jacob
[1:09:32] to promote Leia to his tent to her
[1:09:36] rightful
[1:09:37] place Reuben unstable as water did a
[1:09:41] rash and terrible thing with a motive of
[1:09:45] restoring Leia's
[1:09:47] honor this action cost him the
[1:09:52] birthright the opening genealogies of
[1:09:54] first CR Chronicles tell us the sons of
[1:09:57] Ruben the firstborn of Israel for he was
[1:09:59] the firstborn but for as much as he
[1:10:02] defiled his father's bed his Birthright
[1:10:04] was given under the sons of Joseph the
[1:10:07] son of
[1:10:11] Israel apparently Reuben's Ploy worked
[1:10:14] somewhere along the line after this
[1:10:16] jacob grew to truly love Leia to
[1:10:19] recognize what a special woman she was a
[1:10:22] gem oh why did you say that brother l it
[1:10:25] doesn't say that anywhere in
[1:10:29] Genesis let me read one of my favorite
[1:10:31] passages three verses in the entire
[1:10:34] Bible it takes place in Egypt in the
[1:10:38] district of Goan in the Nile
[1:10:41] Delta Jacob is speaking his last
[1:10:44] reported
[1:10:46] words what name is on his
[1:10:53] lips and he Jacob charged his sons and
[1:10:58] said unto them I'm about to be gathered
[1:11:02] unto my
[1:11:03] people bury me with with my
[1:11:07] fathers the the cave that's in the field
[1:11:11] of Ephron the
[1:11:14] hittite the cave it's in the field of
[1:11:16] Mella before mam in the land of Canaan
[1:11:20] which Abraham bought with the field of
[1:11:22] Ephron the hittite for Poss of a burying
[1:11:27] place there they buried Abraham and
[1:11:31] Sarah his wife there they buried Isaac
[1:11:36] and
[1:11:37] Rebecca his wife and the last Nam to
[1:11:41] cross his lips and there I buried
[1:11:46] Leia he will be and wants to be interred
[1:11:51] forever alongside the woman he once
[1:11:54] hated
[1:11:56] how he must have come to love
[1:12:01] her returning to chapter 35 the family
[1:12:04] move on from near Bethlehem to Hebron
[1:12:07] where Isaac Lay Dying Esau and Jacob
[1:12:10] bury Isaac in the cave where Abraham and
[1:12:12] Sarah are buried we have no record of
[1:12:14] when Jacob's mother Rebecca died but she
[1:12:17] was buried in the same cave as we just
[1:12:19] read it's in Hein shortly after Ruben's
[1:12:23] violation of bilha that Jacob makes the
[1:12:26] special coat for
[1:12:29] Joseph not for Simeon the second born to
[1:12:32] become the one that
[1:12:33] inherits Joseph we first learned that
[1:12:36] his brothers hate him when they see that
[1:12:38] their father Jacob loved Joseph more
[1:12:40] than them when they see the
[1:12:43] coat back to our story in chapter
[1:12:50] 37 and Israel again the other name for
[1:12:53] Jacob said unto Joseph
[1:12:55] do not thy Brethren feed the flock in
[1:12:58] sheam Jacob had purchased land there
[1:13:01] pasture for the Sheep come I will send
[1:13:04] thee unto them and Joseph said to him
[1:13:08] here I am and Israel said to him go I
[1:13:14] pray thee see whether it be well with
[1:13:17] thy brothers and well with the flocks
[1:13:19] and and bring me word
[1:13:22] again so Jacob sent Joseph out of out of
[1:13:25] the valley of heon and Joseph came to
[1:13:29] shakum Jacob was perfectly comfortable
[1:13:32] sending Joseph to his brothers yeah they
[1:13:35] didn't like him much but it's just the
[1:13:37] usual sibling stuff right fight in the
[1:13:39] backyard but in the front yard were the
[1:13:42] jacobsons it wasn't the first time he'd
[1:13:45] sent Joseph to check up on
[1:13:47] things little did he suspect it would be
[1:13:51] the last time
[1:13:56] a certain man found him Joseph wandering
[1:14:00] in the family pasture land there
[1:14:01] wondering where his brothers
[1:14:03] are Joseph's wandering in the field
[1:14:06] which the family owned the man asked him
[1:14:08] saying what are you looking for and
[1:14:11] Joseph said looking for my brothers tell
[1:14:14] me I pray thee if you know where they're
[1:14:17] feeding the
[1:14:18] flocks and the man said oh they're not
[1:14:21] here and I'm sure Joseph said yeah I can
[1:14:24] see that they departed hence I heard
[1:14:27] them say let us go to
[1:14:29] Dothan and Joseph went after his
[1:14:32] Brethren and found them and
[1:14:35] Dothan so on the map you see Hein at the
[1:14:38] bottom it's about 50 miles on the path
[1:14:40] that goes along the Judean Hills there
[1:14:43] to sheak
[1:14:45] him then he talks to this fellow and
[1:14:48] goes another 10 miles or
[1:14:51] so to Dothan
[1:14:56] and when his brothers saw Joseph A far
[1:14:59] off probably by the coat he was wearing
[1:15:02] even before he came near unto them they
[1:15:05] conspired against him to kill him to
[1:15:09] slay him their hatred had fueled their
[1:15:14] jealousy and it's now come to action
[1:15:16] like Peter told Simon the Sorcerer in
[1:15:18] Acts 822 I perceive Thou Art in the gall
[1:15:20] of bitterness and in the bond of
[1:15:22] iniquity
[1:15:25] and they the brothers said to one
[1:15:27] another
[1:15:28] behold this dreamer comes come now
[1:15:32] therefore let's slay him let's kill him
[1:15:35] and cast his body into some pit and
[1:15:38] we'll say some evil Beast devoured him
[1:15:41] we'll see what will become of his
[1:15:44] dreams and
[1:15:47] Reuben the one who lost the birthright
[1:15:49] that Joseph would now possess indicated
[1:15:51] by that special code Ruben heard it and
[1:15:55] he delivered Joseph out of their hands
[1:15:57] he said oh let us not kill him Reuben
[1:16:02] said unto them shed no blood but cast
[1:16:05] him into this pit it's actually a
[1:16:07] sistern a holding tank for rainwater
[1:16:10] carved out of rock sometimes plastered a
[1:16:13] small opening a cover over the
[1:16:15] opening cast him into this sistern
[1:16:17] that's in the wilderness lay no hand
[1:16:19] upon him he said this that that Reuben
[1:16:23] might rid Joseph out of their hands and
[1:16:25] deliver him to his father Jacob
[1:16:28] again Reuben The Rescuer he rescued his
[1:16:31] mother from her husband's shameful
[1:16:34] disgraceful treatment sacrificing his
[1:16:36] honor for hers now he's determined to
[1:16:38] rescue his little brother from Death at
[1:16:41] the hands of some of his brothers two of
[1:16:43] whom are known for their anger and
[1:16:46] cruelty Reuben then departs perhaps to
[1:16:49] oversee watching the sheep and so forth
[1:16:52] what they're supposed to be doing there
[1:17:00] and it came to pass when Joseph was come
[1:17:03] unto his Brethren that they stripped
[1:17:06] Joseph out of his coat his coat of many
[1:17:09] colors was on him this is a violent
[1:17:12] term and they took him They seized him
[1:17:15] and cast him they threw him another
[1:17:17] violent term into a pit into a
[1:17:21] sister it's a series of violent acts
[1:17:24] it's completely unexpected by Joseph hi
[1:17:27] guys what are you do what are you
[1:17:30] doing we don't know who led this action
[1:17:33] but Simeon comes to mind as the second
[1:17:36] son he would have been next in line for
[1:17:38] Ruben's lost Birthright but Joseph's
[1:17:40] getting it
[1:17:41] instead Simeon has a history of violence
[1:17:43] and cruelty and we're told the pit was
[1:17:47] empty we know it's a sister because
[1:17:50] there was no water in
[1:17:53] it most Moses the author is emphasizing
[1:17:58] its
[1:17:59] condition the season of the latter rain
[1:18:02] occurs in September or October so a dry
[1:18:05] sistern implies its late summer there
[1:18:08] had been no rain for some time the
[1:18:11] sister was
[1:18:12] dry we're not told how long Joseph was
[1:18:15] in there bleeding hungry thirsty naked
[1:18:20] in the hot day cold at night and Terror
[1:18:25] pleading for his
[1:18:27] life might have been an hour might have
[1:18:29] been a
[1:18:31] day it might have been three days Flash
[1:18:34] Forward 22 years Joseph's brothers don't
[1:18:38] recognize him they've been held in a
[1:18:39] prison in Egypt after three days Joseph
[1:18:43] comes to them and and he overhears what
[1:18:46] they're saying to each other Genesis
[1:18:49] 42 they said one to another we are
[1:18:52] verily guilty concerning our brother
[1:18:55] Joseph and that we saw the anguish of
[1:18:58] his soul when he begged us and we would
[1:19:01] not hear therefore is this distress come
[1:19:04] upon
[1:19:06] us Joseph had been begging them pleading
[1:19:09] they were brutal violent the NIV reads
[1:19:13] surely we are being punished because of
[1:19:15] our brother we saw how distressed he was
[1:19:18] when he pleaded with us for his life but
[1:19:21] we would not listen that's why this dist
[1:19:24] stress has come on
[1:19:28] us regardless of how long it was as
[1:19:32] Joseph is in the sister hungry
[1:19:36] thirsty
[1:19:37] [Music]
[1:19:39] wounded Genesis 37 and they the nine
[1:19:42] older brothers Ruben's not present they
[1:19:45] callously sat down to eat bread H it's
[1:19:49] lunchtime
[1:19:50] guys and they lifted up their eyes and
[1:19:53] looked and behold what's that dust out
[1:19:55] there what who's coming down the road a
[1:19:58] company of
[1:19:59] Israelites coming from Gilead with their
[1:20:02] camels bearing spicery and bomb and myrr
[1:20:07] going to carry it down to
[1:20:10] Egypt and Judah said unto his
[1:20:13] Brethren what profit is it if we stay
[1:20:17] our BR slay our brother and conceal his
[1:20:20] blood come let us sell him to the ish
[1:20:24] whes let not our hand be upon him for
[1:20:28] even though we hate him he is our
[1:20:30] brother and our
[1:20:31] flesh and his Brethren were content they
[1:20:35] agreed then there passed by midianites
[1:20:40] merchantmen and they drew and lifted up
[1:20:43] Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to
[1:20:46] the Israelites for 20 pieces of
[1:20:52] silver oops
[1:20:57] and they the ishmaelite midianites
[1:21:00] brought Joseph into
[1:21:03] Egypt possible route is shown here in in
[1:21:07] purple the Caravan is passing through
[1:21:10] Dothan there's something else to
[1:21:12] consider
[1:21:14] here looking at the
[1:21:16] map considering the treachery of the
[1:21:20] nine can you see
[1:21:22] it well don't worry we'll get to it next
[1:21:27] time back to the brother's camp in
[1:21:31] Dothan Ruben returned unto the pit and
[1:21:34] behold Joseph was not in the pit and and
[1:21:37] Reuben rent his clothes and he returned
[1:21:39] to his brothers and said the child
[1:21:41] Joseph is not and I worther shall I go
[1:21:45] what can I
[1:21:46] do hey Reuben what are you doing at the
[1:21:50] sistern and why are you so distressed
[1:21:52] that the thorn in our flesh is gone
[1:21:56] were you going to try and rescue him
[1:21:58] like you did Leia were you going to
[1:22:00] betray us to achieve this rescue like
[1:22:03] you did
[1:22:05] Billa Joseph is gone he's dead what do
[1:22:09] you care we're finally rid of Daddy's
[1:22:12] favorites now we'll get the attention
[1:22:14] and respect we deserve get with a
[1:22:20] program and they took Joseph's coat and
[1:22:23] killed a kid of the goats
[1:22:25] and Di the coat in the
[1:22:27] blood and they sent the coat of many
[1:22:29] colors and brought it to their father
[1:22:33] and said this we have found no whether
[1:22:36] it be thy son Joseph's Cod or or
[1:22:39] not the brothers are well trained in the
[1:22:42] Arts of
[1:22:43] deception recall their Revenge at sheum
[1:22:46] it's been a staple in their family for
[1:22:48] generations and their dad Jacob was a
[1:22:50] master Deceiver
[1:22:54] and Jacob knew it he recognized the coat
[1:22:58] and he
[1:22:59] said it's my son's
[1:23:02] coat an evil Beast has devoured
[1:23:07] him Joseph in doubt no doubt he's torn
[1:23:12] to
[1:23:13] pieces and Jacob rent his clothes and
[1:23:17] put sackcloth upon his loins and mourn
[1:23:19] for Joseph many
[1:23:22] days and all his son sons and all his
[1:23:26] daughters rose up to comfort him we all
[1:23:30] miss Joe dad but come on you still got
[1:23:37] us get over it we all loved Rachel she
[1:23:40] died and you got over it it's time to
[1:23:44] move on get on with life come on
[1:23:49] dad but their whole deception backfired
[1:23:52] instead of being rid of Joseph Jacob
[1:23:55] refused to be comforted and he said I'll
[1:23:58] go down into the grave unto my son
[1:24:01] mourning I'll mourn for Joseph till the
[1:24:05] day I die leave me alone go take care of
[1:24:08] the sheep Let Me
[1:24:12] Be thus his father went for Joseph a
[1:24:16] constant reminder to the brothers and
[1:24:19] they can't tell Jacob the
[1:24:23] truth and the
[1:24:25] midianites sold
[1:24:27] Joseph unto Egypt unto Piper an officer
[1:24:31] of
[1:24:32] pharaohs captain of the
[1:24:35] Guard there's definitely something going
[1:24:38] on with these
[1:24:41] midianites and with that route through
[1:24:45] Canaan but that's for next time if the
[1:24:49] musicians would would please
[1:24:51] return what lessons
[1:24:54] can we take home from this portion of
[1:24:58] the story of Joseph well one the Bible's
[1:25:03] not about coverups it's about honesty
[1:25:06] accuracy it's about real people and real
[1:25:10] situations and real life not comic book
[1:25:13] superheroes but people just like
[1:25:17] us our actions and our words have
[1:25:22] consequences this was a a very
[1:25:24] dysfunctional family hate jealousy
[1:25:28] favoritism wanting to literally kill one
[1:25:30] of their own violent cruel here we see
[1:25:34] that God chooses and uses broken people
[1:25:37] to show his power and love and care
[1:25:42] people like me people like
[1:25:46] us we're all affected by our heritage
[1:25:49] and our childhood we see and imitate
[1:25:52] characteristics and behaviors of those
[1:25:53] who raised us so we need to live a good
[1:25:59] example don't play favorites with your
[1:26:02] children and Leia all she wanted was for
[1:26:06] her husband to love her she did all she
[1:26:09] could but marriage takes commitment and
[1:26:13] work from both parties to be
[1:26:16] successful those of us that are husbands
[1:26:18] need to be very careful to genuinely
[1:26:21] love our wives to nurture and maintain
[1:26:25] and grow that love to express it in word
[1:26:29] and
[1:26:31] deed don't let hatred or jealousy into
[1:26:35] your
[1:26:36] life if we love the Lord all things good
[1:26:39] and bad work together for our ultimate
[1:26:44] good and the bad the difficult things
[1:26:48] can help build
[1:26:50] character as brother Daniel Comes to
[1:26:53] close the service I I said we'd sing
[1:26:54] from the Psalms let's sing from Psalm
[1:26:58] 19 and excuse me if I'm on the wrong key

[1:29:10] is thy servant
[1:29:14] warn moreover
[1:29:19] my is thy servant one
[1:29:24] and in keeping of them there is great
[1:29:28] reward there is great
[1:29:33] reward and in keeping of
[1:29:38] that there is great
[1:29:44] reward brothers and sisters it's so
[1:29:48] important that we understand what's
[1:29:51] going on in the Bible as we read these
[1:29:55] things
[1:29:57] and as brother L was
[1:29:59] speaking and I was beginning to really
[1:30:02] kind to get an
[1:30:04] understanding with the the story of Dina
[1:30:09] and and Simeon and Levi and and how
[1:30:13] Reuben and and with his F father's
[1:30:15] concubine BHA and then all on down that
[1:30:20] with Ruben's loyalty to his mom and then
[1:30:24] when Jacob had given his son Joseph this
[1:30:28] coat of many colors and the Bible even
[1:30:30] says that that he loved him more than
[1:30:33] the other ones you can see that that the
[1:30:36] whole situation with Joseph and his
[1:30:39] Brethren it was just it was just ready
[1:30:41] to
[1:30:43] snap and it did
[1:30:45] snap and they took their
[1:30:48] brother and they had an
[1:30:50] opportunity but now we see the
[1:30:52] background in why the had happened it
[1:30:55] was some very flawed
[1:30:58] people
[1:30:59] doing trying to do the best that they
[1:31:01] knew how but doing things
[1:31:05] wrong and then making a major major
[1:31:08] mistake but then we know and I'm looking
[1:31:10] forward to hearing the next two chapters
[1:31:13] of this we know that God takes takes
[1:31:15] this major mistake and they were no
[1:31:18] matter how bad that they acted they were
[1:31:21] in fact children of God
[1:31:24] and then God takes all of these mistakes
[1:31:26] that he
[1:31:27] made that that they had all made and
[1:31:30] then turns it
[1:31:31] around and saves an
[1:31:34] entire lineage of people because of the
[1:31:39] mistakes that they made brother Kim is a
[1:31:41] is a great story this story of of Joseph
[1:31:46] I'm looking forward to hearing the rest
[1:31:47] of it let's all stand brother
