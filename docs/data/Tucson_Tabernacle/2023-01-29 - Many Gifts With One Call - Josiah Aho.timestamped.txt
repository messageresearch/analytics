[42:36] and I pray a blessing over this service
[42:38] in Jesus name amen
[42:41] you can all have your seats for a few
[42:43] minutes
[42:45] I'm going to tell a little story that my
[42:47] dad sometimes tells
[42:49] at the beginning I just felt like I
[42:51] should tell it
[42:52] there was a man who went to church one
[42:54] time
[42:55] and he walked in and sat at the very
[42:57] back
[42:58] and the pastor noticed him as he was
[43:01] preaching he had never seen his face
[43:02] before and he noticed he had one of
[43:04] these a notebook
[43:06] and he was writing notes and so the
[43:08] pastor thought oh maybe I'll I'll
[43:11] introduce myself to that man after
[43:14] and so he
[43:16] he got done preaching and then went
[43:18] outside after and never found the man
[43:21] and then next Sunday the man snuck into
[43:23] church again in the back and did the
[43:25] same thing he left before the pastor got
[43:28] a chance to go meet him and he did that
[43:30] a few weeks in a row and finally the
[43:32] pastor thought you know
[43:34] when I call the musicians up I'm going
[43:37] to have somebody sing and I'm going to
[43:38] run outside and catch him before he
[43:40] leaves
[43:41] and so uh the pastor did that he
[43:44] preached his service and the man wrote
[43:46] his notes and he ran outside and caught
[43:49] him in the parking lot and he said hey I
[43:52] notice you've been coming to church for
[43:53] about a month and I haven't got to meet
[43:55] you I'm the pastor blah blah blah and he
[43:57] introduced himself he said uh have you
[43:59] enjoyed the the church he said oh yeah
[44:02] yeah it's been nice
[44:03] it's been good he said well you know
[44:05] I've
[44:06] noticed you've wrote some notes so uh
[44:10] hopefully those are good and he said
[44:12] yeah Pastor you know I just
[44:14] I I make a little chart
[44:16] and I write uh
[44:19] spits and I write seeds
[44:24] and if you say something I like I put it
[44:26] in the seed category and I take it home
[44:29] and I and I you know that's a seed
[44:31] planted at me and if it's something I
[44:33] don't like I write that in the spits and
[44:35] I just I don't worry about it and the
[44:38] the Pastor said well you know that's a
[44:40] pretty good way to handle it
[44:41] could I ask that you add another
[44:45] line and he took the paper from him and
[44:48] he wrote another line and Drew another
[44:50] category and wrote sits
[44:53] he said so whenever you want to write
[44:55] something in the Spitz category just put
[44:57] it in the sits category
[44:59] and just think about it and don't spit
[45:02] it out right away so the man came back
[45:04] to church did his thing and he said okay
[45:05] pastor I'll do that
[45:07] and you know that man after sitting on
[45:10] those things he was spitting out
[45:12] began to dwell on them and realize there
[45:15] was some truth there
[45:17] so maybe I'll say something tonight that
[45:20] doesn't sound quite right I hope you'll
[45:22] understand in my spirit I want to say
[45:24] the right thing but if it sounds like a
[45:27] spit
[45:28] I bet that wasn't my intention and I
[45:30] just wasn't clear enough so
[45:33] pray that the Lord will help me to speak
[45:35] clearly tonight that I can deliver
[45:37] what's on my heart something very dear
[45:40] to me
[45:42] I'm going to read a quote
[45:44] that I came across
[45:47] a few years ago
[45:50] um
[45:51] before I do uh how many people have been
[45:54] going to Tucson Tabernacle for at least
[45:57] five years raise your hands
[45:59] okay keep your hands up how about 10
[46:02] years or more
[46:03] 20 years
[46:04] anybody 20 years or more been coming
[46:06] here
[46:08] yeah
[46:09] well praise God well it's good to see
[46:11] you I got to meet brother Perry green
[46:14] one time
[46:15] Harmony in the desert when I came where
[46:17] I met the Robson family and my future
[46:19] wife
[46:20] and uh
[46:22] he I told him I'd listen to his
[46:24] testimony and he said young man every
[46:28] word of it was true
[46:30] and I believe it with all my heart and
[46:32] so I have this quote I feel it very
[46:34] special it's from what house will you
[46:36] build me
[46:37] paragraph 22.
[46:40] see this young couple
[46:42] a talented young man
[46:44] I ain't saying that because he's sitting
[46:46] here
[46:47] and this young lady with her babies
[46:49] with his family to raise and he's quit
[46:52] his job and everything to move here
[46:55] and I realized that years ago I was
[46:58] called in the ministry
[46:59] I've never made a successful Pastor
[47:01] because I got a roaming rambling spirit
[47:05] I can't be satisfied anywhere just
[47:08] wherever the spirit moves I've got to
[47:10] move with it because I have a message
[47:14] Jesus said I must I must preach this in
[47:18] this other Town also
[47:21] but there are those who are Shepherds
[47:23] that watch the flock
[47:25] I'm so grateful brother Perry followed
[47:28] the leading of the Holy Spirit and today
[47:30] we have a tabernacle it's a small one
[47:33] that's just good enough to start with
[47:36] to see what the Holy Spirit and then he
[47:38] stops
[47:39] not knowing let's just move step by step
[47:42] now I believe if God has spoke to
[47:45] brother and sister green to come up here
[47:48] and has opened up a place where our
[47:50] children
[47:51] instead of on Sunday morning
[47:54] riding their bicycles and on the streets
[47:56] running around brother Bobby would you
[47:58] stand up
[48:00] we had lunch with brother Bobby today he
[48:03] said this was him
[48:04] riding his bicycle on the street with
[48:06] Brother Joseph
[48:07] and he said instead of on the streets
[48:10] thank you brother Bobby instead of on
[48:11] their streets uh riding the bicycles and
[48:14] running around they have a place to
[48:16] worship
[48:18] they have a place to worship and instead
[48:20] of sitting around and listening to
[48:22] something that we've heard on the radio
[48:24] which is all right
[48:26] but we as this group group of people he
[48:30] continues on we have a message for this
[48:32] day
[48:33] amen
[48:35] amen
[48:38] we we believe that God has given us a
[48:41] message and brother green is I don't
[48:43] want to call him my associate because we
[48:45] are well it is my associate we are
[48:48] together in this message brother green
[48:49] preaches the same thing and the message
[48:51] I believe in he has left his home left
[48:54] his people left his church
[48:56] he was I believe the district
[48:57] superintendent or something of some
[48:59] organizations and gave the whole thing
[49:01] up
[49:02] when he heard this he left everything
[49:04] that was dear to him also to come to the
[49:07] desert
[49:09] just to support what God is giving to us
[49:12] now
[49:13] and now I'm going to read the next
[49:15] paragraph and for those of you who
[49:17] attend here in Tucson Tabernacle
[49:20] I want you to think about brother Daniel
[49:23] Evans
[49:24] and how he's left his home
[49:27] his job to move here to the desert
[49:30] he felt led as he was telling me he felt
[49:32] the leading of the Holy Spirit to move
[49:33] out here and it's so wonderful to see
[49:35] what the Lord is doing so I just want
[49:38] you to think about your pastor as we
[49:39] read this next line I know he's talking
[49:41] about brother Perry green
[49:43] but just think about brother Daniel
[49:45] Evans if this is your pastor and this is
[49:47] your home Church
[49:49] I say I believe it should not only be in
[49:52] our hearts
[49:53] it should be in our duty to back him up
[49:57] everything that we can to attend the
[49:59] services to come here to worship and to
[50:03] make this a place where God can reveal
[50:06] to us the things that he has for us to
[50:09] reveal
[50:10] and his word said the message doesn't
[50:13] come to me through the giving of
[50:15] inspiration but it does to maybe some of
[50:18] us but he said I am here to back up what
[50:22] God has given and he says what a
[50:24] statement
[50:25] and I believe if we all cooperate
[50:27] together we put our hearts to it
[50:30] praise God
[50:32] bless you brother Daniel we're very
[50:34] grateful for you
[50:37] I've had the the honor to get to know
[50:39] brother Daniel just for like a year now
[50:41] he took me and a couple Brothers hiking
[50:44] and uh it was a blessing and I got to
[50:49] see the kind of character
[50:51] that I believe I'm going to see on the
[50:53] other side
[50:54] I I don't see Daniel Evans but I see
[50:57] Jesus Christ and I don't just say that
[50:59] because he's sitting here
[51:01] I say that because it's the truth when I
[51:03] see Daniel Evans I see Jesus Christ and
[51:07] that's that's what we all should want we
[51:09] should want when people see us they
[51:11] don't see Josiah Ajo or
[51:14] Daniel Evans or Joe Robson or Kathy but
[51:16] they see Jesus Christ
[51:18] amen
[51:20] well let's turn to the Bible
[51:25] I've got one scripture I want to read
[51:26] you can all stand up
[51:33] in Romans 11.
[51:37] foreign
[51:38] Romans 11
[51:41] verse 29.
[51:47] this is a scripture I'm sure you've
[51:49] heard I know you've heard it
[51:53] and I've always
[51:55] heard it misquoted
[51:57] but we're not going to misquote it we're
[51:59] going to read what it says Romans 11 29.
[52:03] for the gifts and the calling of God or
[52:08] without repentance
[52:11] let's read it together
[52:12] for the gifts and the calling of God are
[52:17] without repentance
[52:19] God bless you can have your seats
[52:24] pray for me that I keep my head straight
[52:25] tonight and I say all that I'm supposed
[52:28] to say
[52:29] and that I leave out the things that I'm
[52:31] not supposed to say
[52:34] so it says
[52:36] for the gifts and the calling of God are
[52:40] without repentance and so we think of
[52:41] someone who's gifted to sing and before
[52:44] they repent they have that gift someone
[52:47] who's A Gifted speaker
[52:49] they have that gift before they repent
[52:51] if they never repent in their in their
[52:53] life they have that gift that's how we
[52:55] often use this scripture and uh
[52:59] the Lord has been
[53:02] using me in a way
[53:04] that I I didn't let him do for many
[53:07] years
[53:09] for uh
[53:10] a huge portion of my life I sang for the
[53:13] wrong reasons
[53:14] and I didn't sing to glorify God I
[53:17] didn't sing songs about God
[53:19] and I was in a musical that my
[53:24] father-in-law and mother-in-law and my
[53:26] wife were at and I remember being I was
[53:28] one I was in I was a character in this
[53:30] musical and I was singing songs in the
[53:33] musical and I remember being backstage
[53:35] and changing my costumes
[53:38] and looking down at the floor
[53:40] and saying Lord
[53:43] this isn't how I'm supposed to use my
[53:44] gift
[53:46] and when brother Daniel asked me to
[53:48] speak
[53:49] I thought the first thing I thought I
[53:51] was walking into a store and I was
[53:53] looking down at the ground and the first
[53:54] thing I thought was
[53:56] I'm So Unworthy
[53:58] and that's the truth
[54:00] I'm probably the most unworthy person
[54:02] here
[54:04] it's only by his amazing grace that any
[54:07] of us are saved
[54:09] but the scripture says the gifts and the
[54:12] calling of God are without the without
[54:14] repentance
[54:15] now
[54:16] I don't have the same gift as brother
[54:18] Daniel he doesn't have the same gift as
[54:20] me
[54:21] but it says the gifts plural and the
[54:25] calling
[54:27] so I guess
[54:29] my title would be we are all called
[54:32] no matter what your gift is how many
[54:35] times do you think we focus too much on
[54:37] the gift and less about the call because
[54:40] we're called to follow the lord Jesus
[54:42] and to follow the truth of the word for
[54:44] today but how often do we do we focus on
[54:47] the gifts
[54:48] you know I like the way my pastor
[54:50] preaches and I don't like the way that
[54:51] one preaches and I do we do things this
[54:53] way and we do things that because you're
[54:55] focusing on the gift and not the call
[54:58] we need to focus on the call we're all
[55:00] called to follow the lord Jesus
[55:02] and I've got a couple scriptures on that
[55:05] and I was just thinking as brother
[55:08] Daniel asked me you know would you like
[55:09] to speak Sunday night the 29th January
[55:13] 29th
[55:14] and I S I looked down at the ground and
[55:16] I thought I'm So Unworthy
[55:20] I'm So Unworthy
[55:22] I've done so much wrong
[55:24] I lived so wrong and as he preached this
[55:27] morning in Luke 11 it goes right along
[55:29] with my testimony as from a young age I
[55:32] wanted to do right I wanted to live
[55:33] right I wanted to live for God and you
[55:36] know I clean I tried to clean out all
[55:38] those things
[55:40] but I didn't replace it with something
[55:43] and then the Lord was able or the devil
[55:45] sorry was able to come in that weakness
[55:47] and find that and I'd always fall always
[55:49] fall trying to do good and fall trying
[55:52] to get better and fall
[55:54] always happened it always has happened
[55:57] and
[55:58] uh I'll get into some of the specifics
[56:01] about what it was that made me continue
[56:06] to fall that I I wouldn't I wouldn't
[56:08] give up
[56:09] um
[56:10] but I just want to say that
[56:13] none of us deserve the blood of Christ
[56:16] and that's what the Lord started to say
[56:18] to me as I was sitting I was sitting
[56:21] there
[56:22] thinking I'm So Unworthy
[56:24] and he began to speak and say but if any
[56:27] of us think
[56:29] that we are worthy
[56:32] we've missed it
[56:33] and if we start to think which I have
[56:36] and I repent and say Lord forgive me
[56:38] start to think you know I'm doing pretty
[56:40] good
[56:41] that thing I used to struggle with I
[56:43] haven't done it in so long that thing I
[56:45] used to do you know you're counting the
[56:46] days off you know I've been going strong
[56:48] for so long and
[56:50] if you get that way you'll fall ask me
[56:53] how I know
[56:55] so that's what Romans 11 that is the
[56:59] context of that scripture
[57:01] Paul is saying Christ did not come
[57:04] because the Jews and the world deserved
[57:07] him
[57:09] and he said they rejected him and
[57:12] because they rejected him you were
[57:14] grafted in
[57:15] they weren't ready for it he didn't say
[57:18] now they're doing everything perfectly
[57:20] they're living according to my word and
[57:22] so now I can come that's not what
[57:24] happened they weren't ready and it
[57:26] proves they weren't ready but Christ
[57:28] came because the gifts and the calling
[57:31] of God are without repentance
[57:34] so
[57:37] continue on
[57:41] so let's turn to Amos 8.
[57:45] we're going to talk about a few of the
[57:47] things
[57:48] that we as the Church of Jesus Christ
[57:51] are called to do that sounded pretty
[57:53] Mormon when I said that because they
[57:55] call themselves The Church of Jesus
[57:57] Christ we as as you know the people who
[58:00] follow Christ do you follow Christ this
[58:03] is what we're called to do
[58:05] so Amos 8
[58:08] Amos 8 11.
[58:12] Daniel Hosea Joel Amos
[58:17] Obadiah Jonah I can name him
[58:20] Amos chapter 8 verse 11.
[58:22] behold
[58:25] don't you love it when a prophet speaks
[58:30] and we have our categories in the Old
[58:31] Testament of Major Prophets and Minor
[58:33] Prophets but they're all the prophets of
[58:36] God the only reason they're called a
[58:38] minor Prophet is because their book is
[58:39] shorter they're still just as gifted as
[58:41] the other ones
[58:43] so I don't know why I said that
[58:48] Amos 8 11.
[58:50] behold
[58:52] the days come saith the Lord God
[58:54] that I will send a famine in the land
[58:57] not a famine of bread
[58:59] nor a thirst for water
[59:02] but of hearing the words of the Lord
[59:08] there is word of the Lord right
[59:10] the word of the Lord isn't gone but
[59:12] there's going to be a famine for hearing
[59:14] it
[59:15] there's going to come a time when people
[59:17] aren't hearing it
[59:19] there's people who have it and there's
[59:22] people who aren't hearing it
[59:24] there's a famine for hearing the word of
[59:27] the Lord
[59:28] the gifts and the calling we are all
[59:30] called let's go to mark
[59:33] 16.
[59:35] pray that pray that this this is clear
[59:38] and understood
[59:40] when when the Lord began to deal with me
[59:42] I was like man this is so good this is
[59:44] so inspiring to my heart then I thought
[59:47] about how I was going to say it I'm like
[59:49] nobody's gonna understand it the whole
[59:51] thing's going to fall flat
[59:53] but that wasn't the Lord telling me that
[59:54] so
[59:56] we're doing our best mark
[1:00:00] 16.
[1:00:01] chapter 16 verse 15 and he said unto
[1:00:05] them Jesus's last words before leaving
[1:00:08] go ye into all the world
[1:00:11] and preach the gospel to every creature
[1:00:15] so there's a command from God to preach
[1:00:18] the gospel to every creature and there's
[1:00:20] a prophecy from a prophet that says
[1:00:22] there's going to be a time when people
[1:00:24] stop hearing the word of the Lord
[1:00:27] he didn't say preachers go into all the
[1:00:31] world and preach the gospel he didn't
[1:00:33] say
[1:00:35] only the brothers
[1:00:37] and now you're thinking well there's
[1:00:40] you're getting into some dicey ground
[1:00:43] but you know what let me just tell you a
[1:00:45] story we were in Flagstaff with Grandma
[1:00:48] Kate and Katie and we walked into
[1:00:50] Starbucks and I walked behind them and
[1:00:53] we walked in and there was a guy over
[1:00:54] here on a computer
[1:00:55] and he saw them in their skirts with
[1:00:59] their long hair
[1:01:00] and he went like this
[1:01:05] that might be the only sermon he ever
[1:01:07] hears
[1:01:08] is the testimony of Grandma and Katie he
[1:01:12] saw he saw two pure lives and that's how
[1:01:15] he reacted that might have been when he
[1:01:18] rejected the gospel I'm not saying it is
[1:01:20] but when you go out and live your life
[1:01:22] you're preaching the gospel
[1:01:26] and if you're not living a good life
[1:01:27] you're preaching something that's not
[1:01:29] the gospel and if it's not the gospel
[1:01:32] it's of the devil
[1:01:35] that's just the truth if it's not
[1:01:37] serving God it's serving the devil
[1:01:40] and if your life is demonstrating
[1:01:41] something that they don't see Jesus
[1:01:43] Christ which I'm guilty
[1:01:47] they're seeing the devil
[1:01:50] and that's why Jesus said in Revelation
[1:01:52] just be hot or cold
[1:01:56] because if you're lukewarm and someone
[1:01:59] out there sees you and you do it in the
[1:02:01] name of Christianity and they see
[1:02:03] someone lukewarm and they say that
[1:02:04] person's professing to be a Christian
[1:02:06] and they see something that's lukewarm
[1:02:08] they'll think that that's all there is
[1:02:09] to Christianity
[1:02:12] come on now
[1:02:15] go into all the world and preach the
[1:02:17] gospel you know I was thinking the Lord
[1:02:20] spoke to me
[1:02:21] I said how am I how am I going to preach
[1:02:24] and the Lord said why are you thinking
[1:02:26] of preaching
[1:02:28] as Something In a Pulpit
[1:02:31] and I want to ask you a question
[1:02:35] and I want you to think about it
[1:02:38] when was the last time
[1:02:40] you told someone about Jesus
[1:02:44] when was the last time you were talking
[1:02:46] to someone and you said you know what
[1:02:47] the most important thing in my life
[1:02:50] because he's the most important thing in
[1:02:51] our lives right
[1:02:53] if he's the most important thing in our
[1:02:55] lives shouldn't people hear about him a
[1:02:57] little more
[1:02:58] think in your heart when was the last
[1:02:59] time you said
[1:03:01] listen sir listen ma'am I used to be
[1:03:04] this way I used to do I was unhappy I
[1:03:07] was depressed I was a sinner but then I
[1:03:10] met the master
[1:03:12] when was the last time you did that
[1:03:14] because I got really convicted
[1:03:17] because I thought about all the people I
[1:03:19] had talked to and about how I'd talk to
[1:03:21] none of them about Jesus
[1:03:23] and there I was fulfilling that prop
[1:03:25] that prophecy in Amos that there would
[1:03:28] be a famine for hearing the word of the
[1:03:30] Lord
[1:03:31] because I hold the word of the Lord in
[1:03:33] my heart and I refuse to speak
[1:03:38] my my
[1:03:42] ye are the light of the world Matthew 5
[1:03:44] 14.
[1:03:46] hope you don't mind I'm going to read a
[1:03:47] lot of scriptures tonight
[1:03:49] that's what I rely on
[1:03:53] Matthew 5 14.
[1:03:57] ye are the light of the world a city
[1:04:00] that is set on a hill cannot be hid
[1:04:05] if you're really a city set on a hill
[1:04:07] which is the metaphor he's using you
[1:04:10] won't be hit even if you want to be
[1:04:12] if you're really a city set on a hill
[1:04:15] but I worry that we get lazy sometimes
[1:04:18] I'm going to read a quote
[1:04:23] right out of that same what house will
[1:04:26] you build me the very next paragraph I
[1:04:28] just stopped and let that sit for a
[1:04:30] while what house will you build me
[1:04:31] paragraph 27
[1:04:33] I know that each one of you if you feel
[1:04:36] like I do
[1:04:38] I am so hungry to see the spirit of God
[1:04:42] moving I can just hardly stand it
[1:04:46] is that in your heart
[1:04:49] is that in your heart to see the spirit
[1:04:51] of God moving now we talk about that
[1:04:53] amongst Believers I go up to brother
[1:04:55] Daniel oh brother Daniel I'm so hungry
[1:04:57] to see the spirit of God moving Amen
[1:04:59] brother you know that's what we want but
[1:05:00] what if I went to a total stranger not a
[1:05:03] Christian and said you know what
[1:05:04] I'm really just hunger hung I have a
[1:05:07] hunger in my heart to see the spirit of
[1:05:08] God moving
[1:05:12] how do you think they'd react
[1:05:16] what do you think that would do to a
[1:05:17] person do you think they they would ever
[1:05:19] hear that again
[1:05:20] maybe they would
[1:05:22] that's going to make it that's going to
[1:05:24] make an impression on somebody
[1:05:26] and continuing in this quote
[1:05:29] some experiences he said uh uh I'm so
[1:05:32] hungry to see the spirit of God moving I
[1:05:34] can just hardly stand it Amen brother
[1:05:38] some experience I've had up in the
[1:05:40] mountain
[1:05:42] just to feel that once again that
[1:05:44] something that
[1:05:45] when I was first Saved was So Glorious
[1:05:48] to my heart
[1:05:50] and we can come into a place
[1:05:53] and we can sit
[1:05:55] and we can see it among us
[1:05:58] that we are drying
[1:06:01] as we sit here in the desert
[1:06:03] I get among my brethren they talk with
[1:06:06] me and I talk with them
[1:06:08] always in a little way of watching
[1:06:11] feeling out there with the spirit as it
[1:06:15] was to see just the condition of that
[1:06:17] brother to see what's wrong I begin to
[1:06:19] feel us all reclining
[1:06:22] oh
[1:06:24] getting away from the spirit
[1:06:27] it's become too natural a thing to us
[1:06:33] help us Lord Jesus
[1:06:36] may this gospel may this truth never
[1:06:39] become something that's just natural to
[1:06:41] us
[1:06:42] something that's just so common
[1:06:45] so happy we're Believers and we just
[1:06:47] live nice little lives and we go to
[1:06:49] church let's not do that
[1:06:52] let's pray if you don't have that hunger
[1:06:55] in your heart the Lord will give it to
[1:06:57] you because I didn't have it and I got
[1:06:59] to a place in my life where I said Lord
[1:07:00] I want that hunger let's pray that the
[1:07:03] Lord will give us that hunger to see an
[1:07:06] outpouring of the spirit of God do you
[1:07:08] want that
[1:07:10] that was what the prophet said here
[1:07:13] I begin to feel us all reclining
[1:07:16] getting away from the spirit it's become
[1:07:19] too natural a thing to us we must
[1:07:22] Worship in the spirit where the spirit
[1:07:24] of God not only our message should be
[1:07:27] the flame of the hour it should be the
[1:07:29] flame of our hearts
[1:07:32] praise God
[1:07:34] praise God
[1:07:35] the gifts and the calling of God are
[1:07:40] without repentance
[1:07:42] and if we think that we deserve this
[1:07:46] we've missed it
[1:07:50] famine for hearing the word of the Lord
[1:07:52] a people with the word of the Lord and
[1:07:54] people not hearing it
[1:07:57] the gifts of God in people's lives
[1:08:00] to spread the gospel and people not
[1:08:02] hearing it
[1:08:03] the calling of God for those who haven't
[1:08:06] repented and a famine for hearing what
[1:08:09] they're even called to
[1:08:11] think about that
[1:08:14] think about that these people out here
[1:08:17] they have gifts in their lives
[1:08:20] and they they're not hearing about what
[1:08:22] what is this gift I have this gift and
[1:08:24] they're using it for something else
[1:08:25] because maybe they haven't heard
[1:08:28] I'm so I'm so guilty of this myself I
[1:08:31] felt on my heart to share it
[1:08:34] just seeing brother branham's heart
[1:08:35] seeing brother Perry's heart for this
[1:08:37] church to see the gospel go out
[1:08:42] and he says
[1:08:45] I begin to feel us all reclining
[1:08:48] getting away from the spirit
[1:08:51] help us Lord Jesus not to recline not to
[1:08:54] get away from the spirit
[1:08:56] but to Worship in spirit and in truth
[1:08:58] and not just to have it as the message
[1:09:00] in the word of the hour and the flame of
[1:09:02] the hour but to have the flame in our
[1:09:05] hearts Amen to have the flame in our
[1:09:09] hearts
[1:09:10] Shine the Light of the World Jesus says
[1:09:13] at the end of of every gospel they all
[1:09:14] record it in their own way you are the
[1:09:17] light of the world he says
[1:09:19] no man would take a light and put it
[1:09:21] under a bushel
[1:09:23] but on a candlestick
[1:09:25] to light
[1:09:27] the whole world
[1:09:34] so
[1:09:36] just to move
[1:09:38] to a different part I'm going to tell
[1:09:39] you a little bit about my personal
[1:09:41] testimony
[1:09:42] and I told you how
[1:09:44] I wanted I had a desire I tried to get
[1:09:47] right
[1:09:48] and uh
[1:09:50] you know I
[1:09:52] I decided I I would stop talking a
[1:09:55] certain way
[1:09:55] stop using words I shouldn't use
[1:09:58] stop talking about things that I
[1:10:01] shouldn't talk about
[1:10:03] stop looking at things that I shouldn't
[1:10:05] look at and those are all good things
[1:10:06] all things that hindered me
[1:10:08] and I prayed Lord what must I do
[1:10:11] and he said one thing to me
[1:10:13] amongst others but the one thing I
[1:10:16] didn't obey and this is my personal
[1:10:18] testimony
[1:10:19] he told me to
[1:10:22] disconnect myself from the things that
[1:10:25] are taking my attention
[1:10:27] and he brought some things to my mind
[1:10:30] Instagram
[1:10:32] Snapchat
[1:10:34] YouTube
[1:10:36] you know what those things are in your
[1:10:38] life
[1:10:39] and there was certain music he brought
[1:10:41] to my attention and I
[1:10:43] I said Lord I give all my my heart to
[1:10:46] you
[1:10:48] but I think I can still have Instagram
[1:10:52] you know what happened
[1:10:54] social media and things that I thought
[1:10:56] were so innocent progressed the devil
[1:10:59] came back seven times stronger as Luke
[1:11:01] 11 says he came back seven times
[1:11:04] stronger before I knew it I was in high
[1:11:07] school
[1:11:08] I was with the wrong people
[1:11:10] I was vaping
[1:11:13] I don't know if you know what that is
[1:11:15] I was I was smoking pot I was drinking
[1:11:19] what started with
[1:11:20] I can keep my Instagram account and
[1:11:23] follow the leading of the the Holy
[1:11:25] Spirit
[1:11:27] and so then I stopped you know I said I
[1:11:29] need to I need to get my life under
[1:11:30] control so I stopped I stopped smoking I
[1:11:33] stopped drinking I stopped doing all
[1:11:35] those things I stopped saying bad things
[1:11:37] I stopped watching Bad Things
[1:11:40] and again I prayed Lord I've cleaned my
[1:11:43] life out
[1:11:45] now what must I do
[1:11:48] how can you use me he said you know you
[1:11:50] still haven't deleted Instagram
[1:11:52] and I disobeyed again and I didn't
[1:11:55] delete it and I said you know what I'll
[1:11:56] just not be on it but I'll keep the
[1:11:58] account and if I want to communicate
[1:12:00] with friends that I have on social media
[1:12:02] I can just hop on
[1:12:04] you know talk to them and then I can hop
[1:12:07] back off and I'll be okay everything
[1:12:08] will be fine we'll be good
[1:12:11] and maybe maybe I would be fine but
[1:12:14] that's not the point the Lord said get
[1:12:16] rid of your Instagram account and I
[1:12:18] didn't
[1:12:20] and so I fell back in again
[1:12:23] what I was I said I'll never go back
[1:12:25] I'll never do those things again
[1:12:27] and before I knew it I was smoking pot
[1:12:28] again
[1:12:30] I was drinking
[1:12:31] I was doing all those things I said I
[1:12:33] would never do again and then you know I
[1:12:36] cleaned my life up again
[1:12:39] and finally I was sitting
[1:12:42] and uh in the driveway and Katie had
[1:12:45] gone inside
[1:12:47] and
[1:12:49] I was praying about something very
[1:12:51] personal
[1:12:52] and
[1:12:54] the Lord kind of
[1:12:55] I won't say he he snapped at me but he
[1:12:58] was firm with me
[1:13:00] he said I've told you
[1:13:04] you need to rid yourself of the things
[1:13:07] that are taking your attention off of
[1:13:08] this
[1:13:11] and right there in the car I just
[1:13:13] thought Lord
[1:13:14] how could I be so foolish
[1:13:17] I tell you what when we do something
[1:13:19] just as simple as obeying
[1:13:22] just one little thing the Lord would
[1:13:24] move on your heart to do when we just do
[1:13:26] that one thing
[1:13:28] it's proving to him that we trust him
[1:13:31] because I stood in church and said I
[1:13:32] Trust You Lord I love you Lord but this
[1:13:35] one simple thing he asked me to do and I
[1:13:37] didn't do it
[1:13:39] and when I finally did that
[1:13:41] I began to see the Lord moving in my
[1:13:44] life in a way I had never seen before
[1:13:48] and using me and I began to realize you
[1:13:50] know it's a whole lot easier to go out
[1:13:52] and tell someone about Jesus
[1:13:54] because there was no longer that spot in
[1:13:57] the house as we heard this morning that
[1:13:59] the devil could come into because I had
[1:14:01] closed it up I had obeyed the Lord and I
[1:14:03] said Lord Jesus forgive me
[1:14:06] I give it to you
[1:14:09] and I just want to say
[1:14:11] I will never be afraid to speak against
[1:14:13] social media
[1:14:16] it is of the
[1:14:22] two of you think that
[1:14:24] I'm going to convince you that it's of
[1:14:25] the devil I have never once gone on
[1:14:28] Instagram
[1:14:30] and not seen an inappropriately dressed
[1:14:33] man or woman
[1:14:34] not once parents listen
[1:14:38] because I I just I'm a kid
[1:14:42] I'm a kid I saw those things
[1:14:46] and to other young people
[1:14:49] you you're not going to go on there and
[1:14:52] see things that are pointing you towards
[1:14:53] this
[1:14:55] and with all that's within my heart I
[1:14:57] speak out against social media
[1:14:59] because I've seen it ruin lives
[1:15:02] and if it wasn't for the grace of God
[1:15:06] I'd be out somewhere tonight
[1:15:08] with the wrong people doing the wrong
[1:15:10] things that I talked about
[1:15:12] I'm never afraid to speak against those
[1:15:14] things
[1:15:16] I believe it's
[1:15:18] it's anti-word
[1:15:20] you know brother Branham said
[1:15:22] we've got the television right in our
[1:15:25] homes
[1:15:26] what do you think he'd say about
[1:15:29] smartphones today
[1:15:31] he'd say you've got it right in your
[1:15:33] pocket
[1:15:34] and so many young people are susceptible
[1:15:36] to this
[1:15:38] let's go to let's go to Romans 1.
[1:15:41] I didn't give the brothers this
[1:15:42] scripture
[1:15:49] again if you hear something that you
[1:15:51] think is a spit just just sit on it
[1:15:54] it's my testimony What the Lord Has Done
[1:15:57] For Me just sit on it
[1:15:59] think about if you if you have social
[1:16:01] media if you spend time on social media
[1:16:03] and your social media account is
[1:16:05] dedicated to spreading the gospel God
[1:16:08] bless you
[1:16:09] I'm not called to do that if you are God
[1:16:12] bless you if it's not think about the
[1:16:14] time that it's taking away from the Lord
[1:16:19] you know usually you hear this from
[1:16:21] someone who's advanced in years who says
[1:16:26] you young kids you know spending too
[1:16:29] much time on your phone
[1:16:31] but I'm in this generation okay I'm only
[1:16:34] 20.
[1:16:36] and I absolutely hate social media I've
[1:16:40] seen what it's done to my friends I've
[1:16:41] seen what it's done to to people I grew
[1:16:43] up with so Romans 1 2 and 3.
[1:16:48] Paul begins to talk about things
[1:16:51] and
[1:16:53] I believe it's Romans 1
[1:16:57] let's start at
[1:17:00] verse 25.
[1:17:02] Romans 1 25.
[1:17:04] he's talking about all the the
[1:17:06] wickedness a lot of which we see today
[1:17:10] they changed the truth of God into a lie
[1:17:13] verse 25 and worshiped and served the
[1:17:17] creature more than the Creator
[1:17:20] who is blessed forever and ever amen for
[1:17:23] this cause God gave them up to vile
[1:17:25] affections
[1:17:26] for even their women
[1:17:29] did did change the natural use
[1:17:32] into that which is against nature
[1:17:35] and likewise also the men leaving the
[1:17:37] natural use of the woman
[1:17:39] burned in their lust one toward another
[1:17:42] men with men working that which is
[1:17:44] unseemly and receiving in themselves
[1:17:47] that recompense of their error which was
[1:17:50] meat
[1:17:51] and even as they did not like to retain
[1:17:54] God in their knowledge God gave them
[1:17:56] over to a reprobate mind and if you read
[1:17:59] the whole chapter I think this is like
[1:18:00] the third or fourth time God gives them
[1:18:02] up to something
[1:18:04] okay you want to obey me I'll give you
[1:18:05] up to this and then they continued okay
[1:18:08] and I'll give you up to this and they
[1:18:10] kept going further and further and
[1:18:11] further let's keep reading God gives
[1:18:13] them up to a reprobate mind to do those
[1:18:15] things which are not convenient being
[1:18:17] filled with all unrighteousness
[1:18:19] fornication wickedness covetousness
[1:18:22] malniciousness full of Envy murder
[1:18:24] debate deceit malignantly whisper
[1:18:27] Whisperers backbiters haters of God
[1:18:31] despiteful proud boasters inventors
[1:18:35] of evil things
[1:18:40] inventors of evil things how do you know
[1:18:42] it's the smartphone well let's just read
[1:18:43] the next verse
[1:18:45] inventors of evil things I lost my place
[1:18:49] haters of God disappearing unmerciful
[1:18:52] uh where were we verse 30 backbiters
[1:18:54] haters of God despiteful proud boasters
[1:18:56] inventors of evil evil things
[1:18:59] disobedient to Parents Without
[1:19:02] understanding
[1:19:04] Covenant Breakers
[1:19:06] without natural affection
[1:19:10] I'm going to say something have you ever
[1:19:13] heard
[1:19:14] a better description
[1:19:16] of pornography than this
[1:19:20] without natural affection
[1:19:24] implacable
[1:19:25] unmerciful who and this was me knowing
[1:19:29] the Judgment of God
[1:19:31] that they which commit such things are
[1:19:33] worthy of death
[1:19:36] not only do the same
[1:19:39] but have pleasure in them that do them
[1:19:48] but then he talks
[1:19:50] to those of us
[1:19:53] who aren't
[1:19:54] in this same road
[1:19:56] continue in verse in chapter two
[1:19:58] therefore thou are inexcusable o man
[1:20:01] whosoever thou art that judges
[1:20:04] don't judge those who are lost
[1:20:08] we were all lost
[1:20:09] I was lost
[1:20:11] without the grace of God we would all be
[1:20:14] lost and like I said if we think we
[1:20:16] deserve it we've missed it
[1:20:20] therefore thou are inexcusable o man
[1:20:23] whosoever thou art that judges for
[1:20:26] wherein thou judgest another thou
[1:20:28] condemn us thyself
[1:20:34] wow
[1:20:35] look at the way they're living
[1:20:38] sure glad I'm not like that and you're
[1:20:41] condemning yourself
[1:20:43] for thou that judges do us the same
[1:20:46] things
[1:20:48] but we are sure
[1:20:50] that the Judgment of God is according to
[1:20:52] truth against them which commit such
[1:20:55] things it's the Judgment of God not our
[1:20:58] judgment and thinketh thou this o man
[1:21:00] that judges them with which do such
[1:21:03] things and do us the same that thou
[1:21:06] shalt escape the Judgment of God or
[1:21:09] despise us thou The Riches of his
[1:21:13] goodness and forbearance and
[1:21:16] long-suffering
[1:21:17] not knowing that the goodness of God
[1:21:21] leadeth thee to repentance
[1:21:24] isn't that beautiful
[1:21:26] he just he lists some of the in our
[1:21:29] minds some of what we think of as the
[1:21:30] worst sins it's all sin to God but we
[1:21:32] think of those things wow murderers
[1:21:34] backbiters haters of God
[1:21:37] not knowing that the goodness of God
[1:21:40] leadeth thee to repentance
[1:21:42] isn't that beautiful
[1:21:44] isn't that beautiful this is a perfect
[1:21:47] description of a wretch
[1:21:49] I was a wretch
[1:21:51] not knowing that the goodness of God
[1:21:53] leadeth souls to repentance
[1:21:56] that's so wonderful
[1:22:00] God is good
[1:22:07] so now
[1:22:08] ing that we shouldn't
[1:22:10] be judgmental
[1:22:12] that we are the light of the world that
[1:22:15] there's a famine for hearing the word of
[1:22:16] the Lord and we have the word of the
[1:22:18] Lord
[1:22:19] let's think about those who do have the
[1:22:21] word of the Lord
[1:22:22] I'm going to read another scripture
[1:22:24] you're probably like man when is this
[1:22:25] guy going to quit with these scriptures
[1:22:27] in Galatians 1.
[1:22:30] we'll praise God
[1:22:34] Galatians 6 actually
[1:22:38] you read this at the dinner table the
[1:22:39] other night and I thought I gotta go
[1:22:40] write that down
[1:22:46] you condemn yourself if you judge As
[1:22:48] Romans said
[1:22:51] but we have a great responsibility we're
[1:22:53] not to judge but we are to help one
[1:22:55] another
[1:22:56] to love one another to pray for one
[1:22:58] another to lift one another up
[1:23:01] that is the truth and so Galatians 6
[1:23:05] Brethren this is chapter one
[1:23:08] Galatians chapter 6 verse 1. brethren if
[1:23:12] a man be overtaken in Fault ye which are
[1:23:16] spiritual restore such and one in the
[1:23:19] spirit of meekness
[1:23:21] considering thyself
[1:23:23] lest thou also be tempted
[1:23:26] so
[1:23:27] we are called to follow Jesus
[1:23:30] we have the truth there's a famine for
[1:23:32] hearing we're the light of the world
[1:23:34] don't judge
[1:23:37] but we still have to do something
[1:23:40] so we got to be careful in what we're
[1:23:41] doing we don't want the world to feel
[1:23:43] judged by us we want them to feel loved
[1:23:46] by us
[1:23:47] that this is not this is not a Salvation
[1:23:50] of a gospel of
[1:23:52] backbiters haters of God lovers of
[1:23:55] pleasure
[1:23:56] but let's deal in meekness
[1:24:00] considering thyself lest thou also be
[1:24:03] tempted
[1:24:04] so if you if you're going to help
[1:24:06] someone
[1:24:07] doing something wrong how embarrassing
[1:24:09] would it be
[1:24:10] if you pulled them out of that ditch
[1:24:13] not being meek
[1:24:14] cutting them down telling them how
[1:24:16] horrible they were and then you fell in
[1:24:18] the same ditch
[1:24:20] guilty as charged
[1:24:23] in meekness
[1:24:26] you are the light of the world and
[1:24:27] meekness
[1:24:29] you're called
[1:24:31] the gifts and the calling we were all
[1:24:35] called before we repented
[1:24:40] I hope this is coming clear
[1:24:42] I'm doing my best
[1:24:45] um
[1:24:46] I have some more things
[1:24:49] I want to share with you
[1:24:56] this is uh from the fundamental
[1:24:58] Foundation 1955.
[1:25:01] paragraph 23.
[1:25:03] ye are the light of the world
[1:25:05] a city that is set on a hill cannot be
[1:25:07] hid
[1:25:08] and we tonight
[1:25:11] don't get mad at me this isn't me
[1:25:12] talking
[1:25:13] and we tonight ought to be ashamed of
[1:25:16] ourselves
[1:25:17] and honestly and humbly confess our
[1:25:20] unbelief before God and ask him to
[1:25:23] forgive us of how we represent him in
[1:25:27] this life
[1:25:28] he's depending on us
[1:25:30] oh
[1:25:32] he's depending on us
[1:25:35] backbiters haters of God who were called
[1:25:38] out out from the world who are guilty of
[1:25:41] so many things not knowing the goodness
[1:25:43] of God he's depending on us
[1:25:45] he redeemed us and then said now go be
[1:25:49] the light of the world
[1:25:50] now go preach the gospel to every
[1:25:52] creature
[1:25:54] wow
[1:25:55] every one of you nobody's exempt from
[1:25:57] this
[1:25:58] nobody's excused nobody can say Lord I
[1:26:01] read that scripture and I just felt it
[1:26:03] wasn't for me I wasn't supposed to share
[1:26:04] the gospel
[1:26:06] no excuse this is for every one of us
[1:26:13] and honestly and humbly confess our
[1:26:15] unbelief before God and ask him to
[1:26:17] forgive us how we represent him in this
[1:26:21] lifetime
[1:26:22] he is depending on us
[1:26:25] and I pray that we would be
[1:26:27] not ashamed as the song we heard
[1:26:30] not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus
[1:26:32] Christ
[1:26:35] I regret to say there's been times I've
[1:26:37] been ashamed
[1:26:39] where the Lord's told me to speak
[1:26:42] he's told me I felt moved on my heart to
[1:26:45] say something or to share something and
[1:26:47] I haven't
[1:26:49] and he says and we tonight ought to be
[1:26:51] ashamed of ourselves and humbly confess
[1:26:54] our unbelief before God and ask him to
[1:26:56] forgive us
[1:26:57] of how we represent him in this lifetime
[1:26:59] he's depending on us
[1:27:03] so just as I wrap this up this patched
[1:27:07] up
[1:27:09] spiderweb of a sermon
[1:27:12] we are all called
[1:27:15] we're all called to share the light of
[1:27:16] the world
[1:27:18] as Matthew 5 14 says you're the light of
[1:27:20] the world don't hide it under a Bushnell
[1:27:23] Shine the Light
[1:27:25] has Mark 16 15 says go into all the
[1:27:28] world and preach the gospel to every
[1:27:30] creature
[1:27:32] and as Galatians 1 says be meek in doing
[1:27:34] it if you see someone in Fault a brother
[1:27:37] in the church or someone out in the
[1:27:38] world be meek
[1:27:40] be humble know that we were there at one
[1:27:42] point too
[1:27:44] we were lost
[1:27:47] many gifts
[1:27:49] One Call
[1:27:51] for the gifts and the calling that's how
[1:27:54] it's misquoted I don't know if I
[1:27:55] explained how that scripture is
[1:27:57] misquoted most people say the gifts and
[1:27:58] the callings are without repentance
[1:28:01] the gifts plural and the callings plural
[1:28:04] but it actually says the gifts and the
[1:28:06] calling
[1:28:08] and I saw that and I thought
[1:28:10] why does it say that and it's weird
[1:28:12] because I actually thought that the way
[1:28:14] I read it was better
[1:28:16] because I had always heard it read the
[1:28:18] gifts and the callings you know the
[1:28:20] gifts and the different callings but
[1:28:22] that isn't what it says and I believe
[1:28:24] there's a reason for that
[1:28:25] and I hope that this burden that the
[1:28:28] Lord laid on my heart can become real to
[1:28:30] you that you realize we're all called
[1:28:32] we're all called to spread this gospel
[1:28:36] and so
[1:28:39] is anyone worthy though
[1:28:42] no none of us are worthy that's what
[1:28:44] makes it so wonderful that he redeemed
[1:28:46] us
[1:28:47] and without repentance he called us
[1:28:51] thank God and and we read tonight in
[1:28:53] Amos 8 11 that there'd be a famine for
[1:28:56] hearing the words of the Lord which is a
[1:28:58] very scary thing
[1:29:00] to think that
[1:29:01] the word of the Lord is here and there's
[1:29:03] going to be a famine for people hearing
[1:29:05] it
[1:29:06] let that not be this church
[1:29:09] yeah amen let that not be this church
[1:29:13] and I'd say that to any church I go to
[1:29:15] let that not be this church
[1:29:17] not the building
[1:29:19] but the body of Believers the body of
[1:29:22] the followers of Jesus Christ One Church
[1:29:25] one Shepherd One Church as brother
[1:29:27] Daniel said
[1:29:29] let us not let the Lord down as the
[1:29:31] prophet was so burdened he said let us
[1:29:34] humbly confess our unbelief
[1:29:36] and ask for forgiveness of how we
[1:29:39] represent him in this life
[1:29:41] let us not
[1:29:43] be what causes this famine
[1:29:47] we have the food let's share it for
[1:29:49] people imagine if there was no natural
[1:29:51] food in the world
[1:29:52] and we had food
[1:29:55] now if you're a good person you wouldn't
[1:29:58] hog it all to yourself right if nobody
[1:30:02] had food and you had food
[1:30:04] you wouldn't just hold it all in
[1:30:07] you'd say how can we help
[1:30:11] you know not every we can't feed
[1:30:13] everybody but how can we how can we get
[1:30:15] it to somebody
[1:30:16] how can we share it with somebody if you
[1:30:19] had a a bunch of food and there were
[1:30:21] people starving if you're a good person
[1:30:23] you would feed them I say that you have
[1:30:26] spiritual food and there's people
[1:30:29] starving
[1:30:31] and there's a famine for hearing it
[1:30:33] because there's a famine of people
[1:30:35] talking about it there's a famine for
[1:30:37] people sharing the food
[1:30:42] let's read one last scripture that
[1:30:45] I don't know why this was on my heart
[1:30:47] but it's part of the call
[1:30:49] that we're all called
[1:30:51] just before we close
[1:30:53] Matthew 6 14. we read in Matthew 5 14
[1:30:57] now Matthew 6 14.
[1:31:00] I've got lots of 14s and lots of 11s in
[1:31:03] my notes Amos 811 Romans 11 something 11
[1:31:07] Matthew 6 14. interesting
[1:31:12] Matthew 6.
[1:31:15] 14.
[1:31:23] the Lord
[1:31:25] teaches how to pray
[1:31:27] Our Father who art in heaven I'm sure
[1:31:30] everyone has it memorized maybe you have
[1:31:32] it hanging up in your kitchen
[1:31:34] and then he says after this manner pray
[1:31:36] ye but in verse 14
[1:31:40] he says
[1:31:42] if ye forgive men their trespasses
[1:31:45] your heavenly father will also forgive
[1:31:48] you
[1:31:49] but if ye forgive not men their
[1:31:51] trespasses
[1:31:54] neither will your father forgive your
[1:31:57] trespasses I don't know why the Lord
[1:31:59] dropped this on my heart but it's part
[1:32:01] of the call there's nobody that's exempt
[1:32:03] from that scripture
[1:32:05] many gifts One Call
[1:32:07] we're all called to forgive and if we
[1:32:09] don't forgive we will not be forgiven
[1:32:12] think of how scary that is now you might
[1:32:14] say I forgive you and then go and say
[1:32:17] you know how nasty that guy is out there
[1:32:19] he did all this stuff that's not
[1:32:20] forgiveness
[1:32:22] that's not forgiveness that's not that's
[1:32:24] not the light we're supposed to be
[1:32:25] shining can you imagine if there was
[1:32:28] someone dying wondering if there's truth
[1:32:30] out there
[1:32:31] hungering and then they came to a church
[1:32:34] that had the light of the world
[1:32:36] the the beauty the Gospel of Jesus
[1:32:38] Christ had the truth of the word
[1:32:40] and then they saw a bunch of people that
[1:32:42] couldn't forgive one another
[1:32:46] I wouldn't want to go to church there if
[1:32:48] I was lost and I said you know the
[1:32:49] gospel is true let's go find a church
[1:32:51] and I found a bunch of people who were
[1:32:54] just
[1:32:55] always holding grudges and always doing
[1:32:57] things we're not called to do that we're
[1:32:59] called to forgive
[1:33:01] especially if you want to be forgiven
[1:33:05] forgive and you shall be forgiven
[1:33:10] so I hope this was okay tonight
[1:33:14] I hope you I hope you understood it I
[1:33:20] I felt very nervous coming out here but
[1:33:23] I felt that these things were heavy on
[1:33:25] my heart and I hope you know
[1:33:29] this did something for you if you want
[1:33:31] to read some scriptures read in Romans
[1:33:32] 11 about how Paul is talking about how
[1:33:35] you know the fall of the Jews
[1:33:39] is how we got in
[1:33:42] so how about when they come back
[1:33:45] how much more Glory I I don't I'm
[1:33:48] butchering that but how much greater
[1:33:50] will it be the redeeming of the Jews is
[1:33:52] what he says
[1:33:53] read about that read about how you know
[1:33:55] think about how we didn't deserve this
[1:33:57] think about how how much of a wonderful
[1:33:59] God we serve and think about those who
[1:34:01] don't have him
[1:34:02] think of it as you have food and others
[1:34:05] don't
[1:34:06] really think about it that way that
[1:34:08] people are starving
[1:34:10] people are starving there's a famine
[1:34:12] and we gotta we gotta share we gotta
[1:34:14] give food
[1:34:16] let's all stand Katie would you come to
[1:34:18] the piano please
[1:34:22] I want to sing
[1:34:24] I want to live the way he wants me to
[1:34:26] live
[1:34:28] I want to give till there's no more to
[1:34:30] give let's bow our heads Katie if you'd
[1:34:32] start playing that let's try the key of
[1:34:35] D
[1:34:39] let's all bow our heads
[1:34:42] you know in your heart
[1:34:45] the things the Lord is
[1:34:48] dealing with you I don't know things
[1:34:52] maybe you
[1:34:54] have failed to forgive someone I've done
[1:34:56] that
[1:34:58] I've failed to forgive people who who
[1:35:00] are actually wrong
[1:35:02] people who actually did wrong things but
[1:35:04] you know
[1:35:05] it's not about justifying yourself it's
[1:35:07] about forgiving
[1:35:09] even if they were wrong to you we need
[1:35:12] to forgive maybe you spend too much time
[1:35:14] on social media I just want to tell you
[1:35:17] it's not good for your walk with the
[1:35:20] Lord if you're spending more time on
[1:35:21] social media than you are in his word
[1:35:25] maybe you
[1:35:27] had a real experience with the Lord
[1:35:29] you've been filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:35:31] maybe it's as simple as telling someone
[1:35:35] telling someone how wonderful our God is
[1:35:38] [Music]
[1:35:39] and telling him how how Paul said the
[1:35:42] goodness of God leadeth souls to
[1:35:43] repentance that no matter what state
[1:35:45] they're in the Lord Jesus can save them
[1:35:48] isn't that wonderful
[1:35:50] let's all pray don't rely on me to pray
[1:35:53] you know what it is in your life
[1:35:56] you know what it is in your heart let's
[1:35:57] all pray together
[1:35:59] Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be
[1:36:02] thy name
[1:36:03] Lord we're praying for your kingdom to
[1:36:05] come in this church for your will to be
[1:36:08] done in this church
[1:36:10] on Earth as it is in heaven Lord Jesus
[1:36:13] you fed us
[1:36:14] not Josiah Ajo not Daniel Evans
[1:36:18] but you fed us from your word
[1:36:21] Lord Jesus I pray that you would help us
[1:36:24] to be a light
[1:36:26] that we would share this gospel with
[1:36:28] others
[1:36:30] Lord that we would preach a sermon with
[1:36:32] our lives
[1:36:34] that some would see a group of young
[1:36:36] people who's not
[1:36:38] their face stuck in a phone some so much
[1:36:41] and maybe he's got their face stuck in a
[1:36:43] Bible
[1:36:45] maybe he's got
[1:36:47] not music that isn't glorifying God in
[1:36:51] their ears but maybe they've got
[1:36:53] what house will you build Me Maybe
