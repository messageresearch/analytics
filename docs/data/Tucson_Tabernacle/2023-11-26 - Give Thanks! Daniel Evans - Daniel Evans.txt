[34:50] there was a very big gap here and

[35:00] and we are thank that the pastor is back
[35:02] we have a family here and this
[35:05] brother I I I I I feel as I'm standing
[35:09] here that this man is a
[35:13] singer yeah the brother is a singer so
[35:16] brother Aon says brother Jonathan the
[35:19] man is a singer I said we want him to

[35:31] um um God bless you my brother maybe
[35:35] just say something to the church and
[35:37] then you sing for us God
[35:51] bless let me greet you first thank
[35:54] you God bless you
[35:58] these are my nieces brother I know so
[36:00] their their mother is my wife's sister
[36:03] so okay okay I haven't met you but I
[36:06] appreciate your enthusiasm I love the
[36:09] colored Saints so look forward to some
[36:12] fellowship so I'm glad you asked me to
[36:15] greet the Saints because I wanted to
[36:17] sing the song I was conscripted not
[36:20] volunteered so I guess I have the
[36:21] Liberty to but uh I wanted to sing the
[36:25] song He leadth me beautiful old hymn but
[36:29] in singing that just the second verse is
[36:31] so so precious the songwriter says
[36:35] sometimes he leadth me through scenes of
[36:37] deepest Gloom and in this Earthly
[36:40] Journey there's a lot of
[36:42] dark days but also he leads me where
[36:46] Eden's flowers
[36:48] bloom over Waters calm sometimes over
[36:51] troubled Seas but still it's is God's
[36:55] hand that leadth me and what a rest we
[36:56] have as Christians to know that whatever
[36:58] comes our way first must pass through
[37:00] the hand of our father and there's such
[37:03] a rest in that but could I just share a
[37:05] little story you may know what I just
[37:07] learned about the monarch butterfly a
[37:08] couple years ago and I'm embarrassed to
[37:10] say that you may all be educated to know
[37:12] all those things but it was such a
[37:14] striking thing to me to hear about the
[37:16] little monarch butterfly that starts in
[37:19] Mexico and every spring it starts a
[37:22] migration to Canada so it's 3,000 miles
[37:25] but they don't make it in one trip it
[37:26] takes three or four generations so that
[37:28] butterfly that starts from Mexico goes a
[37:31] certain distance stops makes a cocoon
[37:33] cocoons up it dies another Butterfly
[37:36] Come lays its eggs and then another but
[37:37] butterfly comes forth but it does that
[37:39] for three or four generations before it
[37:41] gets to Canada does everybody know this
[37:43] am I telling you stuff is anybody is
[37:45] anybody this new to you okay well it was
[37:47] new to me but I'll refresh your memory
[37:49] so that butterfly now the fifth
[37:51] generation is born in Canada never it's
[37:55] it's great great grandfather or
[37:57] grandmother that left Mexico and so that
[38:01] fifth generation now it migrates back to
[38:04] Mexico but doesn't do it in in four
[38:07] stages in one flight that 3,000 miles
[38:10] from Canada to Mexico and it goes back
[38:12] to the same 40 acres and a lot of times
[38:14] the very same tree that his great great
[38:17] grandfather or grandmother came from
[38:19] when it migrated to Canada so it's
[38:22] supernatural there's no way the
[38:23] scripture says the fool hath said in his
[38:25] heart there is no God
[38:27] no way for that little in insect brain
[38:30] to do that it's super totally
[38:31] Supernatural and there's so many things
[38:33] in nature we see that are so
[38:34] Supernatural like that but I like to
[38:36] think so God leads that little butterfly
[38:38] fifth generation from Canada all the way
[38:40] back to that same tree A lot of times
[38:42] and that's the animal kingdom but we're
[38:44] Made In His Image right we're Sons and
[38:47] Daughters of God how much can we have
[38:49] confidence that God will lead us so
[38:53] we'll sing this song He leadth me oh
[38:56] blessed
[38:59] thought well
[39:01] he that's going to be too low what are
[39:03] we on G that's what we said wasn't it he
[39:06] leadth me oh
[39:10] blessed thought oh words with
[39:14] Heavenly Comfort
[39:17] front
[39:19] what I do whereare I be still is God
[39:26] God's hand that
[39:29] leadth me he leadth me he
[39:36] leadth Me by his own hand he
[39:42] leadth me his
[39:46] faithful
[39:47] follower I would be for by his hand he
[39:55] Le
[39:58] me sometimes mid scenes of
[40:03] deepest
[40:05] Gloom sometimes where Eden
[40:09] flowers bloom by Waters C or troubled
[40:17] sea still T God's hand that
[40:23] leadth me he lead
[40:27] leth me he
[40:30] leth well by his own
[40:34] hand he
[40:36] leadth me and his faithful
[40:41] follower I would be for by his hand he
[40:49] leadth
[40:50] me Lord I would clasp my hand in in
[40:56] thine nor ever
[41:00] murmur nor
[41:03] repine
[41:05] content
[41:07] whatever lot I
[41:10] see since T my God that
[41:15] leadth me and when my task on Earth is
[41:22] done when by thy Grace
[41:27] the
[41:28] victories
[41:29] W even death's cold wave I will not
[41:36] flee since God through
[41:40] Jordan

[50:17] things are pure whatsoever things are
[50:19] lovely whatsoever things are of good
[50:20] report if there be any virtue if there
[50:22] be any praise think on these things
[50:26] we think on all the bad things so often
[50:29] but the Apostle Paul right here is
[50:30] saying hey think on the good things be
[50:34] thankful for what you have I want to
[50:38] talk about this morning about the
[50:40] importance of returning thanks to our
[50:43] Lord there's there's so much friends we
[50:47] have to be thankful for I got this
[50:51] um this little flyer in the
[50:54] mail uh uh while we were we were gone
[50:58] and it's from the William brandom I'm
[51:00] sorry the um Billy Graham Evangelistic
[51:04] Association and uh just a really well
[51:08] done
[51:09] flyer and uh they're just advertising
[51:12] some of the things that they're they're
[51:13] doing and and wanting support for it um
[51:17] but it it has some different just some
[51:20] different short statements in there and
[51:25] I turn to this one right
[51:27] here and it said 65 million
[51:32] Americans ages 12 and older Abus or
[51:36] addicted to drugs or alcohol 65 million
[51:41] Americans how many Americans are there
[51:43] 325 330 million
[51:47] 65 million of those are
[51:50] addicted and abusing these substances I
[51:55] think Lord this is this is a there's
[52:00] never been a time think of the
[52:02] percentage there's never been a time
[52:04] like that and I I was thinking uh the
[52:08] the song that you sang and and and the
[52:12] testimony that you gave about these
[52:13] butterflies they're not going to make it
[52:16] that first generation didn't make it and
[52:18] another generation didn't make it
[52:20] generation after generation but there
[52:22] was a generation that made it
[52:25] I want to be in that generation that
[52:29] finally makes it that finally gets
[52:35] there think of what this is what they're
[52:39] doing here this great
[52:42] organization and and how they're
[52:44] spreading the gospel and and they're
[52:46] doing everything that they can and I I I
[52:49] read all that they're doing in different
[52:51] parts of the world and it almost makes
[52:53] me ashamed of myself
[52:57] and saying that if we really
[52:59] believe if we really believe that there
[53:02] was a sign of the end time if we really
[53:07] believe that God had sent a forerunner
[53:11] to his second coming of Christ let me
[53:14] ask you this why don't your neighbors
[53:16] know
[53:19] sure why don't everybody when we walk
[53:21] down the street why doesn't everyone
[53:23] know that God is is that Jesus is
[53:26] returning
[53:27] soon people need
[53:30] him we look 65 million abusing drugs and
[53:38] alcohol 23 million Americans struggle
[53:42] with depression and over
[53:44] 40,000 commit suicide each year 23
[53:48] million Americans struggle with with
[53:51] depression Jesus Christ the hope of
[53:54] Jesus Jesus Christ can take away that
[53:57] depression knowing that Christ can solve
[54:01] all of these problems 40 million people
[54:05] in the United States feel trapped or
[54:09] crippled by fear 40 million there should
[54:12] be no fear what do we have to fear if we
[54:15] have the gospel of
[54:18] Christ I look at those things and I I
[54:21] think if we call ourselves the bride of
[54:24] Christ and we really believe that God
[54:27] sent a forerunner we really be believe
[54:30] that it's coming we should be always
[54:32] about the father's business always about
[54:34] serving him always about doing something
[54:37] for the lost if we really believe it but
[54:41] then there's a denomination over here
[54:42] that says oh we're
[54:44] fine we're good we're the
[54:46] elite we we got it all we got it all put
[54:49] together I'm okay I'm fine I'm
[54:51] good just shows that we're not if we're
[54:55] thinking that if there isn't a deep
[54:58] burning desire to help lost souls within
[55:02] it there is something wrong we point our
[55:04] fingers at somebody else and say they're
[55:05] a sinner we're the
[55:08] Sinners we are the ones that are sinful
[55:11] pointing our fingers at someone else and
[55:13] saying I'm good I'm going to sit on my
[55:15] high mountain and just enjoy my my
[55:19] greatness
[55:22] no we should be out doing working
[55:26] because this is the worst society that
[55:30] has ever been we are the
[55:31] entitled Society I was watching there's
[55:34] a videoos trending on on YouTube don't
[55:38] watch YouTube it's bad not that I was
[55:41] watching but if I was watching there
[55:44] there are some YouTube videos trending
[55:46] of these these young 20s somethings that
[55:50] have just got out of
[55:52] college and now they're going to to
[55:56] work and they're crying on the on the
[55:59] video and they're so sad I have to wake
[56:02] up at 6:30 in the morning and then I
[56:04] have to get ready and I have to drive 30
[56:07] minutes to my job and then I have to
[56:09] work eight hours and by the time I get
[56:11] done it's like almost dark and I have to
[56:14] drive 30 minutes home and when I I when
[56:16] I get home I'm so tired that I don't
[56:18] have time to do what I want to do
[56:21] there's no me
[56:23] Time come on complaining and complaining
[56:26] and complaining and not giving God
[56:30] thanks that you have a job not giving
[56:33] God thing thanks that you have an income
[56:37] oh my when when I take my rent out and
[56:39] when I take my car insurance out and
[56:41] when I when I take all my my utilities
[56:44] out there's barely enough for
[56:47] me welcome to the real
[56:51] world you're living in a in a false
[56:54] world
[56:55] and we're ra this generation coming up
[56:58] and I'm not just dogging on this
[56:59] generation because I believe that the
[57:02] the worst that it is the the the the
[57:05] most bad generation that could rise up
[57:08] that same generation will have the
[57:10] absolute best that will counter that God
[57:14] will raise up a standard and it'll be
[57:16] out of that same
[57:17] generation and they're crying but
[57:20] they're they're they're upset that they
[57:21] have to go to work and they don't have
[57:23] any time for themselves
[57:25] and we're seeing that it's an unth
[57:29] thankful generation it's an Unholy
[57:32] generation that they're not thankful
[57:34] what for what they have they're not
[57:35] thankful that they can go to
[57:37] school they're not thankful brother
[57:41] Jonathan back there my my dear friend
[57:43] you know let me give a little rose right
[57:47] now God took that man from Africa and he
[57:51] placed him right here with us and he's a
[57:54] blessing he's and he's a dear friend of
[57:57] mine and and brother Jonathan I love you
[57:58] so much but brother
[58:00] Jonathan his children are in
[58:03] school and they want to go to school
[58:06] they're not entitled they're trying to
[58:07] find some way that they can pay for for
[58:10] the kids to go to school and they
[58:12] appreciate it but here with us we're
[58:15] entitled oh I get to go to school if Mom
[58:18] and Dad can't pay for it the government
[58:19] some will pay for it I might not get to
[58:21] go to
[58:22] Stanford but I can go to Puma
[58:27] and unth
[58:29] thankful Unholy the Bible
[58:32] says Luke 6:35 these are this is the
[58:35] Lord Jesus talking listen to his words
[58:39] this is the Luke version of the
[58:40] beatitude Matthew Chapter 5 and then
[58:43] Luke
[58:44] 6:35 listen to this Jesus instructing us
[58:49] and he says this but love your
[58:53] enemies amen and do
[58:56] good and
[58:59] lend hoping for nothing
[59:02] again and your reward shall be great and
[59:06] ye shall be the children of the highest
[59:09] for he is kind speaking of God for he is
[59:14] kind to the
[59:16] unthankful and to the
[59:19] evil so what he's saying here Jesus is
[59:21] saying he's saying listen he says you
[59:23] loan some on
[59:26] something with the
[59:28] hope that they don't pay it back well
[59:32] that's
[59:33] strange that's an odd way of thinking
[59:36] and not only that but you loan it to
[59:39] that person who is against you who might
[59:43] hate
[59:44] you you loan it to that person with the
[59:47] hope that he doesn't pay it
[59:51] back
[59:53] especially it's the strangest thing
[59:56] especially if you're lending it to
[59:57] someone who doesn't like you and then
[1:00:00] sentence starts with but love your
[1:00:02] enemies and do good and lend hoping for
[1:00:04] nothing in return and then your reward
[1:00:07] shall be great what Jesus is doing is
[1:00:09] he's trying to get the audience to
[1:00:11] understand the nature of
[1:00:14] God and then for us the audience to take
[1:00:18] on that same
[1:00:21] nature if you love your enemies and
[1:00:25] lend then if you get nothing in return
[1:00:27] for Lending then your reward shall be
[1:00:29] great and you will be the children of
[1:00:31] the highest just you'll be just like
[1:00:34] your father because he gave his own son
[1:00:39] to those that hated
[1:00:45] him for he is kind to the unthankful and
[1:00:50] to the evil you notice he puts the
[1:00:53] unthankful and the evil right next to
[1:00:56] each
[1:00:59] other and you say
[1:01:01] well unthankful that's not that big of a
[1:01:04] deal it's right next to evil he's pretty
[1:01:06] much saying it's the same
[1:01:08] person and I ask us all of us we would
[1:01:13] never put
[1:01:14] ourselves in the evil spot but do we put
[1:01:19] ourselves in unthankful place are we
[1:01:22] there are we not thankful for what God
[1:01:25] has given
[1:01:27] us but today there's almost no
[1:01:30] thankfulness it seems in the heart of
[1:01:31] the people everywhere let's turn to
[1:01:33] Second Timothy chapter
[1:01:36] 3 read this
[1:01:39] scripture Paul in this portion of the
[1:01:42] his letter he's telling us what to watch
[1:01:45] for right before the second coming of
[1:01:47] Christ Christ what to watch for in the
[1:01:48] end times this know also that in the
[1:01:51] last days perilous time shall come this
[1:01:53] is a scripture being quot oted
[1:01:54] throughout the world by ministers saying
[1:01:57] hey we're there and we can spend really
[1:02:00] years every service just going through
[1:02:03] just this these scriptures and and show
[1:02:07] how we are in these
[1:02:09] days know this also that in the last
[1:02:11] days perilous time shall come for men
[1:02:13] should be lovers of their own
[1:02:15] selves Instagram Snapchat
[1:02:19] Facebook people constantly posting
[1:02:22] pictures of themselves changing the
[1:02:24] pictures to make themselves look better
[1:02:26] loving their own image I added that
[1:02:31] part Covetous boasters proud blasphemers
[1:02:36] disob disobedient to parents
[1:02:41] unthankful
[1:02:43] Unholy without natural affection truce
[1:02:45] Breakers false accusers incontinent
[1:02:47] Fierce despisers of those that are good
[1:02:49] traitors hey high-minded lovers of
[1:02:51] pleasure more than lovers of God having
[1:02:53] a form of God godliness but denying the
[1:02:56] power thereof from such turn
[1:03:02] away right here he's speaking to God's
[1:03:05] people and he says hey these unthankful
[1:03:07] people turn away from them and all these
[1:03:11] other sinful
[1:03:12] people the last age described in
[1:03:15] Revelation chapter
[1:03:17] 3 I know it doesn't say ages in our
[1:03:21] Bible doesn't say Church ages
[1:03:25] it says unto the angel of the Church of
[1:03:28] in this whatever City it is leoda in
[1:03:30] this case but we know that these are
[1:03:34] ages they're periods of time and in this
[1:03:37] last age which is the Revelation which
[1:03:40] is the um leoan age it says this
[1:03:44] Revelation 3 chapter
[1:03:47] 15 I Know Thy works that thou art
[1:03:51] neither cold nor hot I would that thou
[1:03:54] were cold or hot so then because Thou
[1:03:57] Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I
[1:04:00] will spew thee out of my mouth what does
[1:04:03] that
[1:04:04] mean I will spew thee out of my mouth
[1:04:07] you know what it means it means it makes
[1:04:09] God want to throw
[1:04:11] up I'll I'll spew you out of my mouth it
[1:04:16] makes me
[1:04:18] sick it so disgusts God this lukewarm
[1:04:23] age that we live in because thou sayest
[1:04:25] I am rich and increased with goods and
[1:04:28] have need of nothing and knowing knowest
[1:04:30] thou not that thou are wretched
[1:04:32] miserable poor blind and naked so you
[1:04:36] don't know with all the self-promotion
[1:04:40] that goes on in the world we with all of
[1:04:42] our riches and all of our popularity we
[1:04:44] don't know that we are truly miserable
[1:04:47] and
[1:04:48] naked poor and blind right out there for
[1:04:51] everyone to see have you seen the I know
[1:04:54] I know probably I don't know maybe if
[1:04:57] the the the young ones there was a fairy
[1:05:01] tale you know the emperor with no
[1:05:02] clothes remember that do you kids know
[1:05:05] what that story is oh brother Dan you
[1:05:07] haven't taught your kids the emperor
[1:05:08] with no
[1:05:10] clothes it's it's a story where where
[1:05:12] this Emperor he gets swindled so he's
[1:05:15] going and and he um goes to this this
[1:05:19] salesman on the street and he says I
[1:05:21] want the KN cuz he's the best he's this
[1:05:24] narcissistic leader guy and he wants
[1:05:26] something better than everybody else so
[1:05:28] he he comes to this this Taylor and he
[1:05:30] says Hey the Taylor says hey I got
[1:05:32] something for you and
[1:05:35] he goes like this and he says look at
[1:05:39] this beautiful garment he
[1:05:43] says only a righteous man I forgot what
[1:05:46] it was only a great man or something
[1:05:50] great people can see this garment do you
[1:05:53] see how beautiful it is and it's sitting
[1:05:55] there and he's not holding up anything
[1:05:57] and the King's like yeah really nice wow
[1:06:02] I need that so he takes it and gives the
[1:06:05] guy the money and so the emperor takes
[1:06:08] off his clothes and then puts on
[1:06:12] nothing and then goes out and parades in
[1:06:14] front of the people and embarrasses
[1:06:17] himself and he gets swindled he pays
[1:06:19] this great amount of money for something
[1:06:21] that doesn't exist and he's out there
[1:06:25] and in front of the people and they're
[1:06:27] laughing at him and that's this Leo to
[1:06:30] see an
[1:06:31] age we think we're great we think we've
[1:06:34] got it we think we're better than
[1:06:36] everybody else and here we are out in
[1:06:38] the world for every with everybody
[1:06:40] seeing all of our faults and all of our
[1:06:42] problems and the Lord says the Lord
[1:06:44] Jesus says right here you're blind and
[1:06:46] miserable and naked and wretched and you
[1:06:47] don't even know it a perfect
[1:06:51] example of the leoan age of this age
[1:06:54] that we live
[1:06:57] in and Jesus says this in verse number
[1:07:00] 19 as many as I love I rebuke and chasen
[1:07:04] be zealous therefore and
[1:07:09] repent behold me stop that word that
[1:07:13] repent I don't think I'll get there
[1:07:16] today but that word repent repent also
[1:07:19] brings
[1:07:21] Thanksgiving when you really see you're
[1:07:23] wrong and you really see you've messed
[1:07:26] up and you've done you you've made a
[1:07:28] mistake you've sinned when you repent
[1:07:31] and you say Lord I'm sorry I I've done
[1:07:33] this wrong and then you see the grace of
[1:07:36] Jesus Christ and the love of Christ and
[1:07:38] the blood that was shed on that cross
[1:07:41] and then you're just grateful Lord thank
[1:07:43] you so
[1:07:44] much thank you that even though I have
[1:07:48] sinned even though I've messed up my
[1:07:49] life I've made all of these mistakes you
[1:07:52] still can make it right and you
[1:07:55] do repentance brings that Thanksgiving
[1:07:58] how thankful we are that even with our
[1:08:01] mistakes that God can make them right
[1:08:05] behold I stand at the door and
[1:08:07] knock If any man if anyone this is how
[1:08:12] bad the situation is not of just the
[1:08:15] best but if
[1:08:19] anyone hear my voice and open the door I
[1:08:24] will come in to him and I will Su with
[1:08:27] him and he with me anyone that opens
[1:08:30] that door for me I'm going to come in
[1:08:32] this is such a bad age this is such a
[1:08:35] rotten age this is there is just no love
[1:08:37] there's no thankfulness there's just
[1:08:40] anyone it's such a sad thought that he's
[1:08:44] there he'll come in to anywhere if
[1:08:47] anyone will accept
[1:08:49] it
[1:08:50] yes to him that overcometh will I grant
[1:08:54] to sit with me in my throne even as I
[1:08:59] also overcame and am set down with my
[1:09:02] father in his
[1:09:04] throne he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:09:06] what the spirit saith in the
[1:09:08] churches I think where is that
[1:09:12] Thanksgiving today where is that lovely
[1:09:17] Spirit about how much I love God and how
[1:09:22] much he's done for me if you want a
[1:09:25] witness if you want to really lead
[1:09:28] someone to
[1:09:29] Christ if you want if you want to go out
[1:09:32] and you want to change someone's life if
[1:09:35] you want to help them you don't go and
[1:09:38] say you're wrong because it says right
[1:09:40] here that that you're um baptizing wrong
[1:09:43] or you're doing this wrong or that wrong
[1:09:45] that's usually not the way to do it what
[1:09:47] you do is you go and say I want to tell
[1:09:50] you what God has done for
[1:09:51] me I was once lost and now I'm
[1:09:56] found I was once a sinner now I loved
[1:10:00] the Lord now I serve him and now just
[1:10:03] happiness is overflowing from me are you
[1:10:05] rich no I can barely make my
[1:10:08] bills are you what's changed in your
[1:10:11] life what's changed in my life is I have
[1:10:13] the hope of Jesus Christ I know that
[1:10:16] whatever place I get to wherever I am
[1:10:18] that Christ is able to deliver me and
[1:10:21] take me out of that but it has to be
[1:10:24] real within us first before we can
[1:10:26] witness to someone else that's how we
[1:10:28] get a convert that's how we bring people
[1:10:30] to the Lord because we're not bringing
[1:10:32] them to church or to a Doctrine we're
[1:10:34] bringing them to
[1:10:36] Christ and how much does he love
[1:10:40] us I want to say Lord I want to tell
[1:10:42] everybody God loves
[1:10:45] me I'm part of him well brother Daniel
[1:10:49] you make this mistake and that mistake
[1:10:51] and that mistake right that's that's the
[1:10:52] best part about about it I make these
[1:10:55] mistakes but God has brought me out of
[1:10:58] that and he's made he's given me such
[1:11:01] joy in my heart that's the whole
[1:11:04] thing once we have that and then we can
[1:11:08] give it to someone else thank God you
[1:11:12] I've just given you Jesus Christ I've
[1:11:16] just introduced you to him now you talk
[1:11:20] to him because I'm GNA fail go to him
[1:11:25] and that is the role of a minister
[1:11:28] brother that's the role of a pastor that
[1:11:30] is the role of an evangelist that's the
[1:11:32] role of a prophet that's the role of an
[1:11:35] apostle it is the role of all of the
[1:11:38] ministry is the point people to Christ
[1:11:40] and not only the ministry but all of us
[1:11:43] every person in this room I want to tell
[1:11:45] you why I'm so happy it's because Jesus
[1:11:48] Christ is
[1:11:49] alive we want such great Mysteries and
[1:11:52] and we have we've we've had these
[1:11:54] wonderful Mysteries revealed to us but
[1:11:56] the prophet himself you know what the
[1:11:58] greatest mystery is all of them there
[1:12:01] they're great there's so many great
[1:12:03] Mysteries that that have been revealed
[1:12:04] to us from baptism to to the Serpent's
[1:12:07] Seed to all of these different things
[1:12:09] you know what the prophet said the title
[1:12:11] of one of his sermons the greatest
[1:12:13] mystery Christ is the mystery of God
[1:12:16] revealed this
[1:12:18] book this mysterious book this Old
[1:12:22] Testament it's all Jesus Christ
[1:12:25] everything that they were looking for
[1:12:27] it's all revealed in a man named
[1:12:33] Christ I
[1:12:35] uh I think about how just how thankful
[1:12:40] how thankful and I I am and I know I
[1:12:42] come back from vacation and I feel good
[1:12:43] I feel rested but every day I wake up in
[1:12:47] the
[1:12:49] morning as I'm laying there I'm thanking
[1:12:51] the lord and and I have this picture in
[1:12:53] my my mind of of the church and I look
[1:12:57] out on the church and I see each one
[1:13:00] sitting there just a memory that that
[1:13:02] that from every service it's just most
[1:13:05] people sit about in the same place and I
[1:13:08] I just go through and I thank the Lord
[1:13:09] for every person and how just Lord I I
[1:13:14] thank you for their walk with the Lord
[1:13:16] and how much they love the Lord and and
[1:13:18] it's just such a strength to me and I
[1:13:21] just Lord I love him so much I'm so
[1:13:22] thankful that we have a church I'm so
[1:13:24] thankful that we have a place to worship
[1:13:26] because there's a chance that it will be
[1:13:28] taken away this is one of the few
[1:13:31] countries in the world that we could
[1:13:33] just go to any church that we want
[1:13:35] to and we see things starting to
[1:13:39] change I mean look at what has happened
[1:13:42] did you
[1:13:43] see just in this past week the
[1:13:48] anti-Semitism there was a
[1:13:51] teacher that went to a
[1:13:54] pro-israel rally and took a picture with
[1:13:58] a sign saying something on the order I'm
[1:13:59] from
[1:14:00] Israel the school
[1:14:04] rioted I think it was a I think it was a
[1:14:07] woman teacher she was locked herself up
[1:14:09] in a room scared to death that they were
[1:14:12] going to rip her out of her room and
[1:14:14] beat her this is in the United States of
[1:14:18] America how fast are things changing we
[1:14:21] think back in back in the 30s and 40s
[1:14:24] the anti-Semitism and and hating of
[1:14:26] Israel and we were they never thought
[1:14:30] that that could
[1:14:31] happen but it happened and it spread
[1:14:33] throughout good people yes and we think
[1:14:37] oh it'll never happen again it's
[1:14:38] happening
[1:14:40] now God brought them back to their
[1:14:43] Homeland and they they get into Israel
[1:14:46] and they say never again this is never
[1:14:49] happening again Jews you can come here
[1:14:52] and you can be sa safe and look at how
[1:14:54] much the world hates that place hates it
[1:14:57] why because they are Jews because they
[1:15:00] are God's
[1:15:02] people hating them wanting to kill them
[1:15:04] in this
[1:15:06] country was it in ger no was
[1:15:09] Russia planes were flying
[1:15:12] in from from what they thought was
[1:15:15] Israel and the people were going
[1:15:18] checking passports on the plane looking
[1:15:20] for
[1:15:22] Jews
[1:15:23] this is
[1:15:25] now things are
[1:15:28] changing and we should say Lord protect
[1:15:32] your people this was prophesied to come
[1:15:35] here we are now come to Christ that is
[1:15:39] your only salvation that is your only
[1:15:41] Refuge is Jesus Christ we're seeing it
[1:15:45] everywhere in fact I'll tell you how
[1:15:48] close it is God s his
[1:15:52] Forerunner do we really
[1:15:55] believe do we really believe
[1:15:57] it I think not I think we get stuck in
[1:16:01] our doctrines and we get stuck in our
[1:16:02] rules and and all of our regulations but
[1:16:04] we do do we look and see what the
[1:16:06] message
[1:16:07] is that Jesus Christ is coming
[1:16:10] soon that's the most important thing and
[1:16:13] we should be shouting it from the
[1:16:15] housetops saying get
[1:16:19] ready there was there's a this
[1:16:22] Thanksgiving holiday had just has just
[1:16:26] passed and Abraham Lincoln the greatest
[1:16:30] president that this country has ever
[1:16:32] seen is the one that signed the order to
[1:16:38] make Thanksgiving a
[1:16:39] holiday and it's just you look at the
[1:16:42] meaning behind
[1:16:45] Thanksgiving and the meaning is to give
[1:16:51] God praise
[1:16:53] and thanks for what he has given all of
[1:16:56] us what a
[1:16:58] holiday I mean
[1:17:02] tremendous holiday that this holiday is
[1:17:05] dedicated to what thanking
[1:17:09] God I love Christmas too it's dedicated
[1:17:12] to Jesus
[1:17:14] Christ wonderful but this Abraham
[1:17:18] Lincoln sign this it shows you that
[1:17:20] things have changed in this
[1:17:22] country abrah Abraham Lincoln signed
[1:17:26] this
[1:17:27] Proclamation that we have this federal
[1:17:33] holiday
[1:17:35] and it was because of what those
[1:17:39] pilgrims what our forefathers had done
[1:17:41] to make it to where we can be in this
[1:17:44] church because they didn't have that the
[1:17:47] ones that came from from Europe they
[1:17:51] didn't have what we have they couldn't
[1:17:53] worship freely like we
[1:17:56] worship there's a quote I'd like to
[1:18:00] read William brandom says
[1:18:04] this sometimes it costs you
[1:18:09] something anything that doesn't cost you
[1:18:12] something isn't worth having that's
[1:18:15] right all great things has to be paid
[1:18:18] for the reason we're worshiping today
[1:18:21] freedom of religion in this thing
[1:18:22] Thanksgiving Day this cost the blood of
[1:18:25] many American millions of them it's
[1:18:28] worth something and if it's worth
[1:18:30] something it's worth dying for and this
[1:18:34] religion that we have this Pentecostal
[1:18:36] Holy Spirit that's fell on us bring back
[1:18:41] to us a resurrected Jesus Christ alive
[1:18:44] after 1900 years it's worth all of our
[1:18:48] time our efforts and everything that we
[1:18:50] do it's worth all to us yes but instead
[1:18:54] we see an unthankful generation rise up
[1:18:57] today and our generation was unth
[1:19:00] thankful too and the generations before
[1:19:02] us were unthankful the more we are
[1:19:05] given the less thankful we are the
[1:19:08] easier we have it the less thanks we
[1:19:12] give to God isn't that strange it's only
[1:19:14] when we get sick and the Lord heals us
[1:19:17] that we give God we give God thanks it's
[1:19:20] only that when we have problems that we
[1:19:22] give God thanks when we're going through
[1:19:24] life like this generation like this leot
[1:19:27] to seea and age that we're in now we
[1:19:29] don't give God thanks because it's too
[1:19:32] easy what a strange
[1:19:35] thing we're not thanking God every day
[1:19:37] for how easy we have
[1:19:40] it
[1:19:44] instead we only thank him when things
[1:19:46] get
[1:19:48] hard
[1:19:50] times that I have been the most
[1:19:52] desperate in my life me personally is
[1:19:56] when God has spoken to me the most it's
[1:19:59] because I've cried out to him with the
[1:20:02] most
[1:20:03] sincerity and that's when I see God
[1:20:05] coming on the scene and taking care of
[1:20:07] me why aren't I crying out like that
[1:20:09] every day just giving him glory just
[1:20:12] saying Lord thank you so much I love you
[1:20:14] so much thank you for that I get to
[1:20:16] breathe thank you that my heart's
[1:20:18] beating thank you that I have children
[1:20:20] thank you that I have a wife thank you
[1:20:21] that I have I have parents my parents
[1:20:23] have gone on but thank you that they
[1:20:25] took care of me thank you that I have
[1:20:27] food on the table thank you that I have
[1:20:29] a job thank you that I have a
[1:20:31] church but instead We
[1:20:34] complain my God my drive my drive to
[1:20:37] work is too far you have a
[1:20:39] job I don't like the way the pastor's
[1:20:41] teaching you have a
[1:20:45] church it's it's the way it's this
[1:20:48] Modern
[1:20:49] Way Romans chapter 5 this is
[1:20:53] tremendous my favorite one of my
[1:20:58] favorites they're all my favorite Romans
[1:21:01] 51 therefore being justified by faith we
[1:21:04] have peace with God through our Lord
[1:21:06] Jesus Christ by whom also we have access
[1:21:09] by faith into the grace wherein we stand
[1:21:11] and rejoice in Hope of the glory of
[1:21:15] God and not only so listen to
[1:21:20] this but we glory in tribul ations
[1:21:24] also another strange statement but we
[1:21:28] glory in tribulations also knowing that
[1:21:30] tribulations worketh patience and
[1:21:33] patience experience and experience hope
[1:21:36] that word experience every other
[1:21:37] translation that I found was a proven
[1:21:43] character it works it makes us it gives
[1:21:47] us character these tribulations and
[1:21:49] trials that we
[1:21:50] have and Hope
[1:21:54] maketh not ashame it doesn't put us to
[1:21:59] shame because the love of God is shed
[1:22:01] abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
[1:22:03] which is given unto us friends when we
[1:22:06] have suffered whether it be by oural
[1:22:09] mistakes or things that that we didn't
[1:22:12] have anything to do with that that just
[1:22:14] happened when we
[1:22:17] suffer it God is using that to build our
[1:22:22] character character to help us because
[1:22:25] there's a there's work to be done in the
[1:22:28] future and we are getting trained and
[1:22:30] we're getting character built within us
[1:22:32] that we
[1:22:33] can survive in the times coming these
[1:22:38] tribulations don't say Lord why am I
[1:22:41] going through this Lord why do I have to
[1:22:44] suffer all of this listen you're not
[1:22:46] suffering anything that anybody else
[1:22:48] isn't
[1:22:49] suffering you're going through these
[1:22:51] things and I go through these things to
[1:22:53] build our character to help us they
[1:22:58] blessings that's why the Apostle here is
[1:23:01] saying these are don't don't shun these
[1:23:05] things these are
[1:23:08] blessings this uh Abraham Lincoln quoted
[1:23:14] in a speech in
[1:23:15] 1859 he quoted a
[1:23:18] um an old per old Persian writing
[1:23:21] Persian literature
[1:23:23] from the 12th century and it says this
[1:23:26] Abraham Lincoln was quoting that and he
[1:23:27] says this and this too shall pass
[1:23:31] away which is from that 12th century
[1:23:34] Persian writing and this too shall pass
[1:23:37] away Abraham Lincoln says how much it
[1:23:39] expresses that saying how chastening in
[1:23:42] the hour of Pride how consoling in the
[1:23:45] depths of Affliction and this too shall
[1:23:49] pass
[1:23:50] away knowing that whatever we're going
[1:23:53] through whether it be good times they're
[1:23:55] going to pass away whether it be hard
[1:23:57] times it's going to pass away don't get
[1:23:59] discouraged it's going to pass away but
[1:24:01] one thing that should never pass away is
[1:24:03] our Thanksgiving to
[1:24:09] God to finish
[1:24:12] up the Thanksgiving holiday comes from a
[1:24:17] a great time in the history of it wasn't
[1:24:20] the United States then what but what
[1:24:22] would become the United States there
[1:24:24] were two ships leaving from northern
[1:24:27] Europe from Europe for this new land
[1:24:30] that was being called
[1:24:32] America it was this was a place of hope
[1:24:34] where they could finally find a place
[1:24:36] that they could attend any church that
[1:24:38] they wanted to and not be forced into a
[1:24:40] certain way of thinking they wanted to
[1:24:42] freely worship God that was the main
[1:24:44] reason they
[1:24:47] left in 1620 two ships were leading
[1:24:51] leaving Europe the speed well and the
[1:24:54] Mayflower before they Departed the ship
[1:24:57] speed well and Del Halen
[1:25:01] Holland Del Haven
[1:25:04] Holland it's a blessing that we have
[1:25:06] brothers from Holland here our roots go
[1:25:09] back to Holland right
[1:25:12] here Pastor John
[1:25:15] Robinson Pastor there in Holland gave
[1:25:18] this address to part of his congregation
[1:25:21] that would be leaving him and going into
[1:25:23] the
[1:25:25] unknown and these are some of the most
[1:25:27] inspired words that I have ever read and
[1:25:30] you can find these in many many history
[1:25:32] books today and how much do they apply
[1:25:36] now to
[1:25:39] us Pastor John Robinson says
[1:25:43] this I charge you before God and His
[1:25:48] blessed
[1:25:49] angels that you follow me no further
[1:25:52] further than you have seen me follow the
[1:25:55] lord Jesus Christ what a
[1:25:58] pastor what a wonderful thing to
[1:26:01] say if God reveals anything to you by
[1:26:05] any other instrument of his be as ready
[1:26:08] to receive it as you were to receive any
[1:26:11] Truth by my Ministry for I am verily
[1:26:14] persuaded the Lord hath more truth Yet
[1:26:17] To Break Forth out of his holy word
[1:26:20] these are people that were suffering
[1:26:23] persecution these are people that
[1:26:24] weren't allowed to to congregate unless
[1:26:27] they believed a certain way and I'm
[1:26:29] going to and what he says right now
[1:26:31] proves it for by for my part I cannot
[1:26:37] sufficiently bewail the condition of
[1:26:39] those reformed churches which are come
[1:26:41] to a period in religion and will go at
[1:26:44] present no further than the instruments
[1:26:46] of their
[1:26:47] Reformation what does that mean the
[1:26:50] lutherans cannot be drawn on to go
[1:26:52] beyond to what Luther
[1:26:56] saw whatever part of his
[1:26:59] will our God has revealed to Calvin
[1:27:03] another great man of God they will
[1:27:06] rather die than to embrace it and the
[1:27:09] Calvinists you see stick fast to where
[1:27:12] they were left by that great man of God
[1:27:16] who yet saw not all
[1:27:19] things this is a misery much to be
[1:27:23] lamented for though they were burning
[1:27:25] and Shining lights in their time yet
[1:27:28] they penetrated not into the whole
[1:27:30] Council of God but were but were they
[1:27:33] now
[1:27:34] living would be as willing to embrace
[1:27:38] further light as that which they first
[1:27:40] received for it is not possible the
[1:27:43] Christian should come so lately out of
[1:27:45] such thick anti-christian Darkness these
[1:27:48] are Christian churches by the
[1:27:51] way and Pastor here is saying they're
[1:27:54] coming out of anti-christian
[1:27:57] darkness and that Perfection of
[1:28:00] knowledge should break forth at
[1:28:03] once how inspired this man's words as he
[1:28:08] addresses his congregation that was
[1:28:09] about to go on this ship the speed well
[1:28:11] into the
[1:28:12] unknown so with tears in their eyes they
[1:28:16] set forth sailing to England they hooked
[1:28:18] up with the Mayflower and they started
[1:28:21] sailing
[1:28:22] West very quickly the speed well sprang
[1:28:25] a
[1:28:26] leak and they had to go back they tried
[1:28:29] to fix it they couldn't fix it so all of
[1:28:31] the I believe it was
[1:28:34] 102 um total passengers they all
[1:28:37] squeezed into one ship and they took off
[1:28:40] headed west in the
[1:28:46] Mayflower they traveled 2700 miles west
[1:28:50] and it was months that they that they
[1:28:53] took it was there was great storms and
[1:28:55] there was the main sail broke and the
[1:28:57] Mayflower they had all kinds of people
[1:28:59] 130 people I believe was total with all
[1:29:01] the crew and everything they're going
[1:29:03] and they're they're traveling west and
[1:29:05] then they finally on they finally make
[1:29:09] ground and then their troubles they made
[1:29:12] it to the promised land they made it to
[1:29:14] the United to not the United States but
[1:29:16] to
[1:29:17] America and on December 25th they leave
[1:29:21] the mayl hour some of them and start
[1:29:24] construction of houses and a
[1:29:31] settlement from that time almost one
[1:29:35] year until the last Thursday of the
[1:29:38] month in
[1:29:40] November
[1:29:42] half half of them
[1:29:45] died their
[1:29:47] children their wives their husbands half
[1:29:51] of them died died from exposure to the
[1:29:53] elements half of them died from
[1:29:55] malnutrition from
[1:29:58] disease and then they meet some
[1:30:01] kind-hearted
[1:30:03] Indians and these Indians helped them
[1:30:05] they they showed them how to plant corn
[1:30:08] they showed them how to to take the sap
[1:30:11] out of maple trees they showed them how
[1:30:13] to fish they taught them how to survive
[1:30:17] all the while people are dying and
[1:30:19] they're struggling and they're they
[1:30:20] they're they're going through all these
[1:30:22] tribulations then on at the end of
[1:30:25] November they have a
[1:30:27] feast they had been taught that hey you
[1:30:30] plant corn take your dead fish and throw
[1:30:33] it in the in the dirt and it'll
[1:30:35] fertilize it it'll help the corn grow
[1:30:37] things like that things that they they
[1:30:38] never knew
[1:30:40] before and then the leader gets
[1:30:45] there invites the natives that were
[1:30:49] there and they have a feast they didn't
[1:30:54] say we've had a hard year and this is
[1:30:57] miserable and that boat ride over here
[1:31:00] was really tough it was bad Stephanie
[1:31:03] and I were complaining because we had a
[1:31:04] five hour
[1:31:06] flight Air Conditioning you know can I
[1:31:09] have another Coke Zero thank
[1:31:13] you it's like I'm
[1:31:16] sore months they were people dying cold
[1:31:22] coming to come to a place of freedom of
[1:31:26] worship where they could build a new
[1:31:28] land they had Thanksgiving and God took
[1:31:31] these
[1:31:32] people and built a country from these
[1:31:36] people not because they complained not
[1:31:39] because they had they they lamented all
[1:31:42] their problems but because they saw hope
[1:31:44] in the
[1:31:46] future that's why we celebrate this this
[1:31:49] great day of Thanksgiving and look
[1:31:52] what's been
[1:31:53] built we here
[1:31:57] now are a result of the sacrifices that
[1:32:00] they made yes in this church thank God
[1:32:05] for them thank God for men and women
[1:32:08] that would stand up to tyranny that
[1:32:10] would say no Calvin was a great
[1:32:14] man but no I don't have to be a
[1:32:19] calvinist John Wesley was a b great man
[1:32:21] I don't have to be a Methodist Martin
[1:32:24] Luther was a great man I don't have to
[1:32:25] be a Lutheran I can believe Jesus Christ
[1:32:28] I can worship him those were great men
[1:32:31] but let me just worship
[1:32:33] God and stop persecuting
[1:32:36] me and it meant so much to them they
[1:32:39] didn't just switch
[1:32:41] churches they couldn't switch churches
[1:32:44] it meant so much to them that they
[1:32:46] risked everything that they had to head
[1:32:49] west across perilous times
[1:32:52] perilous ocean and to build a place that
[1:32:56] was
[1:32:57] free that's why it's the greatest
[1:33:00] country in the world even today even
[1:33:03] with all the problems that we're seeing
[1:33:05] even with the the filth that we see
[1:33:07] coming out of Hollywood and and through

[1:48:09] of the people here in the church and
[1:48:12] each one has their own individual
[1:48:15] character but if we really look deep
[1:48:17] inside somebody we could see the
[1:48:19] character of Jesus Jesus in each one of
[1:48:21] you amen
[1:48:24] and I was taken away in thought and
[1:48:30] thinking as I Envision the faces in my
[1:48:34] mind of each one of
