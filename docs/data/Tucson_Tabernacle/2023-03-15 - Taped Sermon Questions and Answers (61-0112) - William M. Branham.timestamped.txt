[20:28] God bless you brothers and sisters
[20:31] good to be out in the house of the Lord
[20:34] on this rainy Tucson evening
[20:37] it's good it's good to see everyone here
[20:40] before we get started a couple
[20:42] announcements
[20:44] brother Jeremy and sister Angela had it
[20:47] on the heart to do another volleyball
[20:49] Gathering and a potluck that will be on
[20:53] Friday night at the same place it was
[20:55] last time it'll start at 6 30.
[20:59] um and I'll put a link up I didn't put
[21:01] up a link on the announcement to sign up
[21:04] for food but I will do that sister
[21:07] Angela
[21:08] um has given me the link and I just
[21:10] haven't put it up yet and then on
[21:12] Saturday
[21:14] we have uh brother Sammy Marriott
[21:17] his celebration of his life
[21:20] and we'll do that that'll start at three
[21:21] o'clock and we will have another potluck
[21:24] after that so we're gonna have plenty of
[21:26] food
[21:27] this this weekend
[21:29] and then on Sunday I'll be ministering
[21:32] in the morning
[21:33] and um on Sunday evening I wanted to do
[21:36] something a little bit different I've
[21:38] been hearing so many good testimonies
[21:41] from the congregation over the past few
[21:43] weeks
[21:44] I thought it'd probably be time to have
[21:46] a testimony service
[21:48] so we will all say a few words at the
[21:51] beginning of service on Sunday night and
[21:53] then we will start passing the
[21:55] microphone around and uh and hearing
[21:59] some of these wonderful things that have
[22:01] been happenings so please come and maybe
[22:04] jot down some notes and let's make sure
[22:07] that it's not just one testimony so keep
[22:10] your testimonies as brief as you can we
[22:13] don't want to hinder the testimony but
[22:15] we also want to have everyone get a
[22:18] chance to speak that wants to
[22:21] um so we have a we have a big week this
[22:24] week
[22:25] my brother Adam is coming into town
[22:29] tomorrow and I will probably I think I'm
[22:33] going to have him give a testimony I've
[22:35] I've talked about this boxing gym that
[22:37] we started
[22:38] a couple years ago now and how it's just
[22:41] flourished so I'll probably have my
[22:44] brother give um
[22:46] testimony of some things that have
[22:47] happened recently with this ministry
[22:49] that we have with with the youth not so
[22:52] much with the youth but with the inner
[22:53] city folks there in Jeffersonville
[22:57] tonight
[22:59] we have a special blessing
[23:03] and being able to hear this questions
[23:06] and answers tape it's something I've
[23:09] listened to it I listened to it
[23:10] yesterday and then I listened to it
[23:12] again today
[23:14] and
[23:15] I feel that it's it's something that
[23:19] is going to help us as a congregation
[23:22] brother Branham talks about
[23:25] the questions that were on the people's
[23:28] hearts this is this is a men's meeting
[23:31] and um it's it's just mainly the
[23:34] ministers that were in the church back
[23:37] then and it was some of the local
[23:39] pastors brother Junior Jackson's there
[23:41] brother ruddle was there brother Chris
[23:44] was there some of the different ones
[23:46] that had come from Brother branham's
[23:48] Ministry they were together in the
[23:51] Tabernacle and brother Branham was
[23:53] answering some of these questions
[23:56] and
[23:58] the the kind of the main theme at the
[24:01] beginning was about
[24:04] finding your position in the body
[24:08] finding identifying that calling that
[24:11] God has given to you and brother Branham
[24:14] goes through and some of the questions
[24:16] they're just beautiful questions and
[24:18] beautiful answers brother Branham talks
[24:21] about
[24:22] how you need to pray these things
[24:24] through and and sometimes people want to
[24:27] do something that's not their calling
[24:28] and other times people don't want to do
[24:31] something that is their calling and he
[24:34] tells us how to find what that is and I
[24:37] believe he says that watch if if you're
[24:40] moving in this ministry and God blesses
[24:43] it
[24:43] then you know that you're operating
[24:46] within that calling you're going to hear
[24:48] him talk about that
[24:49] and there's one
[24:52] really
[24:53] sweet thing that happened
[24:55] and it was it was something that that
[24:58] you might not identify and as you're
[25:01] listening to the sermon
[25:03] remember that there are ministers there
[25:07] that had left
[25:09] the Branham Tabernacle
[25:12] brother Junior Jackson Brother Don
[25:14] Ruttle and and and the different ones
[25:16] and started their own their own churches
[25:19] and some of these Brethren had
[25:22] differences they were divided in their
[25:25] Doctrine and I've said this before one
[25:28] of those Doctrine was in church order
[25:31] and in worship and in tongues and
[25:36] in in that part of the ministry and
[25:39] brother Branham there's a question on
[25:41] tongues and really loud just listen
[25:45] close as as he's answering this it'll
[25:47] really bless you brother Branham gives
[25:51] the answer
[25:52] about about the tongues and about how
[25:55] when the spirit when the spirit hits you
[25:57] that it's the spirit going forward
[26:02] now watch the pastor
[26:06] which is brother Neville
[26:08] the pastor here's brother branham's
[26:11] answer
[26:13] and he sees that oh this could be
[26:18] misinterpreted
[26:20] and that's where the pastors see the
[26:22] pastors watching over the congregation
[26:24] and he's he's listening to brother
[26:26] branham's answer and he's listening to
[26:29] the question and he says uh brother
[26:32] Branham and then he has a question and
[26:35] as brother Branham says he says well
[26:37] when the spirit takes control and you'll
[26:39] hear it I'm just paraphrasing when the
[26:41] spirit takes control
[26:44] that and brother Branham answered it
[26:47] perfectly as always but it could have
[26:49] been misinterpreted
[26:51] as when the spirit takes control you
[26:53] have no control over yourself so you
[26:56] could just stand up at any time and give
[26:58] a prophecy or speak in tongues or
[27:00] whatever it might be
[27:01] it could be interpreted that way that's
[27:03] not what brother Brahm said
[27:04] but the pastor
[27:07] says brother Branham
[27:09] he says
[27:11] um
[27:13] he he says something on the order of but
[27:17] there's still order right you can still
[27:20] control that
[27:22] and then brother Branham says oh yes you
[27:25] can still control and it must come in
[27:27] order and that but it blessed me so much
[27:29] to see the the operation of the fivefold
[27:32] ministry there you have the leader and
[27:35] he has the authority and he is he is
[27:37] giving the answers he is this messenger
[27:40] and he's giving these answers to set
[27:44] this church body in order and then you
[27:47] have the pastor and he's looking over
[27:50] his local body
[27:52] and he's saying but can we clarify that
[27:55] a little bit because he's seeing that
[27:58] maybe the congregation could take it
[28:00] wrong and then brother Branham goes on
[28:02] and clarifies it it was just such a such
[28:05] a blessing
[28:06] to me in listening to this tape and how
[28:11] important these things are that the
[28:14] prophet's talking about
[28:16] setting us in order and finding our
[28:19] place in the ministry now in this tape
[28:22] there's mainly ministers and Elders
[28:24] there but it applies to all of us
[28:27] every single one of us has a position in
[28:31] God's body it may not be to stand behind
[28:34] this Pulpit but all of us have a
[28:37] position and we need to find that
[28:39] position
[28:39] and seek the place that God wants us in
[28:45] and then once we find that place we will
[28:47] be able to operate I've seen so many
[28:49] mistakes and and brothers that may they
[28:53] may want a position doing doing
[28:56] something here and it's not blessing the
[28:59] congregation and not only is it not
[29:02] blessing the congregation but in wanting
[29:04] a position that they're not called to
[29:05] they are taking themselves out of a
[29:08] position that they are called to
[29:10] and then it hurts the body so if like
[29:14] like if me if I was looking for a
[29:17] position that God didn't call me to
[29:20] I would also be taking myself at a
[29:23] position that he did call me to
[29:26] and I know in my just in my history and
[29:32] growing up and
[29:33] the way I was raised
[29:36] I never wanted to be in this pulpit
[29:41] preacher
[29:43] way I don't like those guys
[29:46] and I saw
[29:48] over the years
[29:50] how and especially over the past few
[29:52] years how God has
[29:56] has not pushed me but
[29:59] nudged me
[30:01] in this direction and me me seeing and
[30:04] me saying I don't want to do that I
[30:06] don't want to do that I just I just I
[30:09] want to just live my life I want to be
[30:11] happy I want to serve the Lord I want to
[30:13] pay my tithes I want to sit in the
[30:14] congregation I want to worship and then
[30:16] I want to go hunting on the weekends on
[30:19] on Friday and Saturday I'll show up for
[30:21] church on Sunday and I want to work in
[30:23] my job and I want to make money and I
[30:25] want to be prosperous and all of that
[30:27] and that wasn't that's not my calling
[30:31] it's my calling to do something that's a
[30:34] little different that maybe I can help
[30:37] other people
[30:39] and I see and especially in the past few
[30:41] days
[30:43] there is such a need
[30:46] there is such a need in the ministry and
[30:50] I'm not just talking about in this
[30:52] pulpit
[30:53] I'm talking about
[30:55] people need love
[30:58] people need to be shown that there's
[31:01] someone that cares
[31:02] sister Rachel always think about you and
[31:04] the blessing that you are to the people
[31:06] that you work with
[31:08] we need that
[31:10] it's it's
[31:12] we can go up and we can preach a great
[31:14] message
[31:15] and how much good does it do but you
[31:18] know what does a do you know what does
[31:20] far more good than anything you could
[31:22] ever do is if you care
[31:25] and if you listen and if you show
[31:28] someone that you actually care and you
[31:30] actually love that person
[31:32] that's what makes the difference I know
[31:36] I've been on the phone
[31:38] pretty much all day yesterday and today
[31:40] with people that that aren't even most
[31:44] of them aren't even from this church and
[31:47] they're just torn up
[31:49] living life and and it just seems like
[31:52] nobody cares
[31:55] and and I'll get off the phone with them
[31:57] and then I'll hear Oh Brother Daniel
[32:01] um bro this this person said that that
[32:03] old brother Daniel he's he's just such a
[32:05] man of God and he he just told me the
[32:08] exact exact right things and you know
[32:10] what I did I didn't even I just listened
[32:13] wasn't any great wisdom that I had
[32:16] I just cared for the person
[32:19] I loved them
[32:21] and and I took my time for them
[32:25] and that's what
[32:28] it's so needed
[32:30] and I just even even just today friends
[32:33] there is a there is a there's a great
[32:37] problem in the world and it's people are
[32:40] falling into sin and people are going
[32:43] away from God because no one cares
[32:48] Jesus cares but he has Representatives
[32:53] on Earth
[32:54] how does he do his work he does his work
[32:57] through us
[32:59] and that's that's what the world needs
[33:02] to see that's what we need to be
[33:05] it's a Wednesday night
[33:07] and many times I've said the Wednesday
[33:10] night crowd
[33:12] is they are the ones that seem to make
[33:16] things happen
[33:17] you know the pillars the pillars in the
[33:20] church
[33:20] and and working hard not that not that
[33:24] the Lord's not using everyone but really
[33:27] making an effort
[33:29] and we can take the lead and really
[33:34] push and work and work for God's people
[33:38] because the time is short
[33:40] and and listening to this sermon
[33:44] today
[33:45] I felt
[33:47] such an anointing
[33:50] even though the the sermon is not an
[33:53] emotional sermon it's it's just you'll
[33:56] sit there and you'll listen to it and
[33:58] you'll just take in the wisdom of a
[34:02] prophet and just enjoy what he's saying
[34:05] but
[34:07] the wisdom in which he says it is is
[34:11] just tremendous and I know that you're
[34:14] going to get as much of a blessing out
[34:16] of it
[34:17] as I have
[34:20] and um
[34:22] I'm excited I'm excited for us to listen
[34:25] to it tonight we're going to start
[34:28] at uh
[34:29] we started about four minutes in start
[34:31] at the beginning of paragraph 11
[34:35] and then we will end
[34:38] at the end of paragraph 139 51 minutes
[34:42] in so we'll start at four minutes and 14
[34:44] seconds in and we'll end just shy of 52
[34:48] minutes in
[34:50] so let's stand
[34:55] let's bow our heads
[35:01] friends
[35:03] have an open heart
[35:06] set aside
[35:09] any doctrines
[35:11] that you have that I have
[35:14] that we've we've learned
[35:18] set aside those doctrines
[35:21] and just
[35:24] take it in wisdom
[35:27] of a prophet of God they don't come
[35:30] along very often
[35:32] like
[35:33] and allow the Holy Spirit to work
[35:36] have an open mind
[35:40] and think on the things that
[35:42] this man says
[35:45] and accept them
[35:46] [Music]
[35:49] speaks
[35:51] on these issues of the body of Christ
[35:54] and on tongues
[35:57] let's bow our heads as
[36:00] as brother Branham prays
[36:09] our heavenly father we have assembled
[36:12] here is a group of man Christian man who
[36:16] love you who believe in you and who's
[36:18] dedicated our lives and services to your
[36:21] service
[36:22] there's ministers you're a young man
[36:24] middle-aged man
[36:26] they got churches they're responsible
[36:29] before God there's deacons here
[36:32] it's responsible in their offices in
[36:36] these different churches there's
[36:37] trustees their responsibilities pastors
[36:41] evangelists whatever Lord we're
[36:44] responsible to you and that's why we
[36:47] come together that we might all speak
[36:49] the same thing as we were said that we
[36:52] must do in the scripture let us all
[36:55] speak alike
[36:56] father we think in this kind of a group
[36:58] that we might find maybe some of our
[37:01] Brethren or some of us would have a
[37:04] little differences up on things and some
[37:06] were just asking for really to find out
[37:08] what is truth about it and we know that
[37:11] we're insufficient each of us
[37:14] if I should ask any of these other
[37:15] brothers to come here to these questions
[37:17] perhaps they'd be just as sufficient or
[37:19] more than I'd be to answer them but
[37:22] together we are depending on your
[37:24] Revelation amen that you might reveal to
[37:27] us through the word and through by your
[37:30] spirit that we might have an answer for
[37:33] every question that our hearts we might
[37:36] be filled with the answers and we could
[37:39] go away feeling it we were better
[37:40] equipped for your service
[37:42] and to serve our office than we are now
[37:45] that's our purpose of being here father
[37:48] Grant it now and answer our questions
[37:51] father as we wait upon you let there be
[37:54] no puzzle in any of our minds but may we
[37:56] stay with that question until it's fully
[37:58] answered and we're Satisfied by the
[38:00] spirit unanimously agreed because of his
[38:04] presence he asked it in Jesus name amen
[38:07] amen you can be seated
[38:09] thank you
[38:15] I just want a quote a scripture to start
[38:17] with is Isaiah said the prophet said O
[38:22] come let us reason together saith the
[38:24] Lord
[38:26] and I think that's why we're here
[38:28] tonight is try to reason get things uh
[38:31] reasoned out
[38:33] and now I would start and got some of
[38:36] the things written down here according
[38:38] to numbers and so forth that I had this
[38:40] brother Woods that caught got this
[38:42] envelope
[38:43] uh with answers in him and now I want
[38:46] each of you my dear Brethren to know
[38:49] that that these answers are are given to
[38:53] the very best of my knowledge the very
[38:56] best that I would know how to understand
[38:59] and these answers are not infallible see
[39:03] because the scriptures is infallible
[39:06] and as far as I know they're aligned
[39:10] with the scriptures I hope that makes it
[39:13] plain
[39:13] and the tape is to be uh kept now and
[39:17] anyone would want it well
[39:20] and it could have it but now I know the
[39:23] scriptures are infallible but my answers
[39:26] are not infallible so I'm sure everyone
[39:29] understands that and if it's not uh if
[39:32] it's not infallible then you have a
[39:34] right maybe to ask me at any time if
[39:38] there's somebody else's question it
[39:40] doesn't have to be your question but if
[39:42] it's somebody else's question maybe you
[39:44] never thought of it but it's something
[39:45] we're here to help we're here to to come
[39:49] together because we're in the last days
[39:52] and the days are evil and and we want to
[39:55] be trained at school brother Stricker
[39:59] the soldier brother gold back there a
[40:01] soldier and perhaps brother ruddle here
[40:03] he was a soldier brother dealer and uh
[40:06] the different ones it's it's been
[40:08] military life you set together you you
[40:11] counsel you you know the battle before
[40:14] you get out there and all the tactics
[40:15] you can of the enemy so that you can
[40:17] meet him on his ground
[40:19] and I used to box they find out my
[40:22] opponent what he was going to be what
[40:24] kind of a lick he used whether it's an
[40:25] uppercut or left jab or chop with his
[40:28] right hand and or his liar left-handed
[40:30] how strong he was and where he switched
[40:33] his feet and how he used his eyes and
[40:34] what color he come from and all the
[40:36] different tactics we could and they'd
[40:38] find out what the trainers had seen that
[40:41] fellow fight before so then they put a
[40:43] man in there with me to train me exactly
[40:45] like that man was fighting to to know
[40:48] what he was going to do that's what
[40:49] we're here for tonight we know the
[40:51] strike of the enemy
[40:53] we know what his tactics are and we're
[40:55] here tonight with scripture to cover him
[40:58] over so he can't move because the
[41:00] enemies on every hand brother Roberson I
[41:02] think back there seeing him he sure he
[41:04] don't know what a soldier is he
[41:06] certainly had a time of how many
[41:07] soldiers is in here let's see it's been
[41:09] soldiers in the Army just look at here a
[41:11] group of You Soldiers all right
[41:14] now you know what it is and that's what
[41:17] you study isn't it brother Roy brother
[41:18] Beeler and you veterans and so forth is
[41:21] study the enemy what's he going to do
[41:23] what's his move and then know how to
[41:25] meet him that's what we're here for
[41:26] study the enemy's move and and knowing
[41:30] how to meeting a thing that'll overcome
[41:32] him and remember
[41:34] let me say this brethren a little church
[41:36] has started here on a line of gifts
[41:38] saying gifts are coming into the church
[41:40] but whether there be gifts or not if
[41:43] there's never a gift I'll tell you the
[41:45] gift won't always defeat the enemy but
[41:47] the word will
[41:49] the word will meet him anywhere and
[41:51] Jesus when he was on Earth proved that
[41:53] he's he was God manifested in flesh but
[41:57] he never used any of his fine gifts to
[42:00] beat the enemy we find in Matthew the uh
[42:03] I believe is the second the third
[42:04] chapter of Matthew he said no second
[42:06] chapter of Matthew when he met the enemy
[42:08] he met him on the grounds of the word it
[42:12] is written and the enemy come back it is
[42:15] written and he said it is also written I
[42:17] can't until he beat the enemy and that's
[42:19] what we're here for is to meet the enemy
[42:21] with the material that God gave us to
[42:24] meet it with now I have about four
[42:27] questions Jared
[42:29] it's on the um it's on one it's on one
[42:32] piece of paper and I numbered him one
[42:34] two three four five six eight ten on
[42:36] down like that as soon as I get through
[42:38] this then I'll jump into those there it
[42:40] says brother Branham if these questions
[42:42] are out of line then just disregard them
[42:46] and I won't feel bad about it for I will
[42:50] know it was not the hand of the Lord
[42:52] question number one brother Branham
[42:55] I have heard you uh
[42:58] that it should should be back in the and
[43:03] I I I have heard you say I should be
[43:06] back in the ministry and I have thought
[43:09] up on it myself but have waited up on
[43:13] some definitely word
[43:16] from him about it
[43:19] up to date it hasn't come now since I
[43:22] know the end is so near
[43:25] should I still wait for the Lord Jesus
[43:29] to to speak to me are would he be
[43:33] pleased to tell you what to tell me
[43:36] since I know you are his spokesman for
[43:40] this day
[43:42] well now a brother
[43:44] I'd I got it wrote down here my answer
[43:48] to it
[43:49] um
[43:51] God calling this brother a call in life
[43:54] now there's one great thing we could
[43:57] just take that as a text and preach all
[43:58] night on it see that one thing a calling
[44:01] make your calling and election sure
[44:04] thing we don't want to be just wondering
[44:07] if we're called
[44:09] you must be called
[44:11] or you'll be defeated
[44:14] we're fighting a battle thing and uh if
[44:17] you are positive sure brother that your
[44:21] calling is of God and you've been called
[44:24] of God to do a work now there's a great
[44:27] trick there that the enemy can play on
[44:29] you he can make you think you're not
[44:31] called when you are a call then you turn
[44:33] right back around make you think you're
[44:35] not called or make you think you're you
[44:37] are called when you're not called vice
[44:39] versa either way
[44:41] and you had to watch it now here's the
[44:43] way to do it
[44:44] find out first but this is advice the
[44:47] only thing I can give on this is
[44:48] advising
[44:49] but make sure that your calling comes
[44:53] from God and then check your mortis and
[44:56] objectives thing now you know what I
[44:58] mean by that what is your emotive for
[45:01] preaching was it just do you think is
[45:03] the easier job and what you have and you
[45:05] better forget it it wasn't a call a call
[45:08] of God Burns so in your heart you can't
[45:10] rest day and night for it you just can't
[45:12] get away from it it's just constantly
[45:13] grinding at you and and if you had to
[45:16] preach and say well now another
[45:18] objective I believe it's a job I've got
[45:20] if I could be a successful evangelist or
[45:22] a pastor have a good set salary have a
[45:25] home and I could go into and so forth
[45:27] and live then uh I believe that would be
[45:30] a good thing much easier than what I'm
[45:31] doing now and really I think it would be
[45:33] I see your objective is wrong to begin
[45:36] with see it's not right think you're
[45:39] wrong here on that and uh you'd say well
[45:42] uh maybe because that I am uh
[45:47] think maybe it'll be more popular
[45:49] amongst the people see you'll find out
[45:51] you're just ready for a big flop
[45:53] really thing but now if your objective
[45:57] is that I don't care if I have to eat
[45:59] salty crackers and drink Branch water
[46:01] I'll preach the gospel anyhow something
[46:04] is tearing into you I'll either preach
[46:06] the gospel or die see then you you go
[46:10] somewhere because
[46:11] it's God dealing with you God is making
[46:14] himself known to you because it is God
[46:17] just won't let you rest and usually a
[46:20] god-called man never wants to do it did
[46:24] you ever think of that any man just
[46:26] recently is asked to me by some very
[46:28] precious brethren
[46:30] that uh so now that we have come into
[46:33] the way brother Branham now that we've
[46:35] found that Lord and received the Holy
[46:37] Ghost shall we uh seek gifts for our
[46:40] ministry that we should do I said don't
[46:42] never do it don't never advise people to
[46:45] do something like that because usually a
[46:47] guy that wants to do it is a guy that
[46:49] that can't do it it's a God is trying to
[46:53] run from it is the one that God uses see
[46:55] if he's trying to get away from it oh
[46:57] brother I tell you I the calling's in me
[47:00] but I man I hate to try that uh there
[47:03] you are I see that that's trying to run
[47:05] if he's if he wants to do it so bad the
[47:07] first thing he know he finds himself a
[47:09] stuffed shirt like you say God you give
[47:11] me power to move mountains I tell you
[47:13] I'll do something for you if you let me
[47:15] move mountains no he wouldn't
[47:16] you can't even move himself to the right
[47:18] attitude see so he had never moved
[47:20] Mountains for God just take for instance
[47:22] like Paul
[47:24] you think Paul could have got away from
[47:25] his calling oh brother he couldn't do it
[47:28] he was just grinding at him day and
[47:30] night till he left his church he left
[47:32] everything and and went out into I
[47:34] believe it was Asia wasn't and stayed
[47:36] three years down there studying the
[47:38] scriptures to find out whether it was
[47:39] right or not see to find out whether God
[47:41] had really called him so if God is
[47:44] calling you brother and he keeps digging
[47:46] at your heart
[47:48] and I'd say a lay aside ever wait and
[47:50] the sin that is easily besetches but if
[47:54] it's not digging at you and then um I I
[47:57] wouldn't think too much about it then
[47:58] just let it come to this paper now I
[48:00] said this brother is sitting here
[48:03] um a brother Branham should um
[48:06] do you think that God would speak to me
[48:09] to tell him
[48:11] I believe God would speak right straight
[48:13] to him
[48:14] because you know God's we're not too big
[48:16] but what he can speak to us he he'll
[48:19] speak to us all right he just he'll
[48:21] speak to us and I'll tell you if he told
[48:23] me
[48:24] then the brother might say well he told
[48:27] Brother Branham so praise God but you
[48:29] see it ain't brother Ram giving you the
[48:31] call it's the Lord Jesus giving you the
[48:33] cause he if it's the Lord Jesus giving a
[48:35] call he'll do the speaking see I can
[48:38] speak to you to your ears but when
[48:40] Christ called you to the ministry it's
[48:41] in your heart see that's where the thing
[48:43] has to Anchor and you can't get away
[48:45] from it now I believe on the second
[48:47] question now if there's any question on
[48:50] that any question to it
[48:52] okay at a man's call has to be in his
[48:56] heart coming from God and another
[49:00] brother oh I know who this is It's wrote
[49:03] this see I know who wrote it precious
[49:06] dear gracious brother that I truly
[49:10] believe has a call of God but I just I
[49:13] wouldn't want him to do it up on mine
[49:14] that's the reason I answered the way I
[49:15] did see up on me saying well yes uh
[49:19] brother so and so hard to go into the
[49:21] ministry see now you say brother Bram
[49:23] told me hard to do that and maybe what
[49:26] if something happened to brother Branham
[49:27] I get killed or die or get away then see
[49:31] your calling is over then but if Jesus
[49:34] calls you brother as long as there's an
[49:36] eternity he'll still be a ringing out
[49:37] scene and then you know where you're
[49:39] standing
[49:41] now on the second or something like this
[49:44] knowing it it is the last day I sure
[49:46] appreciate that for that brother
[49:48] I certainly appreciate that of that
[49:50] brother realizing that we're in the last
[49:52] day and the sincerity of his heart
[49:54] wanting to do something for Christ the
[49:56] next one is
[49:57] now if our
[49:59] precious Lord should let me do
[50:03] a little thing for him should I go back
[50:06] to the communities where I have
[50:09] ministered parsley in the an era of
[50:13] which I am sorry he has that in princes
[50:16] and try to tell them the truth they have
[50:20] been so they have been
[50:23] so upon my hearts
[50:27] no brother I wouldn't think it was
[50:30] necessary for you to go back into the
[50:33] same community and um I believe a
[50:37] brother dear when the Lord called you he
[50:39] may never let you go as you once does in
[50:42] a community and you perhaps taught
[50:45] things or had things that wasn't um that
[50:48] actually you see different on now seeing
[50:51] that you might see different from what
[50:53] you did then now and the Lord when he
[50:57] calls you he may
[50:58] if he makes it Realty he might send you
[51:01] anywhere see you wouldn't have to go to
[51:02] any certain Community or anything when
[51:05] you were there you were sincere I know
[51:07] the brother as I say this wrote these
[51:09] questions with the deepest of
[51:10] sinistering or real genuine Christian
[51:13] you did the best that you could do and
[51:15] with all you know what how to do and
[51:16] that's all God requires now if God
[51:19] should call you back that Community I'll
[51:20] take right back again but if he didn't I
[51:23] believe I just go wherever he sent me to
[51:26] is your question
[51:29] number three
[51:31] how does one know their rightful
[51:34] position in the body of Christ
[51:38] that's a good one very good how does
[51:41] that be kind of question amongst many of
[51:43] us here tonight how do you rightfully
[51:44] know now I'm presuming that this brother
[51:47] wants to know uh what the position what
[51:52] in Christ what part of Christ do I play
[51:56] now for instance I'd say like this
[51:58] brother to give you the best answer I
[51:59] know your position is cry and Christ is
[52:02] revealed to you by the Holy Spirit and
[52:05] then if you want to know whether it's
[52:07] the Holy Spirit or not find out whether
[52:09] He blesses what you're doing or not and
[52:12] if he blesses it then that's him
[52:15] if he doesn't bless like someone said to
[52:17] me not long ago said the Lord called me
[52:19] to preach
[52:20] I said well then preach
[52:22] and uh so he he I really think it's so
[52:26] Satan if he can just get somebody to act
[52:29] like that and then deceive him that's
[52:32] just what he wants to do then the whole
[52:33] world points her finger at that somebody
[52:36] thinks they have a gift of speaking in
[52:37] tongues an interpretation some has a
[52:40] gift of Divine Healing some has these
[52:42] things like sometimes they're mistaken
[52:44] in those things
[52:45] and sometimes they think they haven't
[52:48] got it when they have so it's very
[52:50] tricky so always do this Brethren
[52:53] whenever you feel that you're supposed
[52:56] to do a thing first find out if it's
[52:58] scriptural for you to do it
[53:00] if it's in the scriptures not just wrote
[53:03] in one place but that means completely
[53:04] scriptural Through the Bible for you to
[53:07] do it your position safe just be an
[53:09] evangelist Pastor teacher prophet
[53:12] whatever God might have called you to be
[53:15] you see or if you have a gift of tongues
[53:16] gift interpretation gift of any any kind
[53:19] of the nine spiritual gifts in the
[53:21] church into four spiritual offices of
[53:23] the church any position first see if God
[53:26] called then usually the way I watch it
[53:30] for myself just this is me I watch the
[53:33] nature of the person and see what kind
[53:35] of a gift that they're professing see
[53:37] God will work with his creature the way
[53:39] he's made him see you make a creature if
[53:43] you seem real flighty and going on you
[53:46] and he says the Lord call me for such a
[53:48] such a to be a pastor
[53:51] Pastor can't be a flighty person
[53:54] pastor's solid sound
[53:57] see God called me to be a teacher
[54:01] and watch him how he interprets the
[54:02] order see he gets it all messed up and
[54:04] everything then you can tell see but
[54:07] then the thing to do your position is
[54:10] usually known
[54:11] whether you can do it or not now
[54:15] when God called me to be an evangelist I
[54:18] wanted to be a pastor
[54:20] I thought staying home here would just
[54:22] be fine and the Lord called me and
[54:24] finally all the people got together
[54:25] there's not a one of them left and I
[54:27] didn't hear him that they cried and went
[54:29] out there in the 1717 Spring Street and
[54:31] the lady Mrs Hawkins over here and met
[54:33] me instead of crying during the time of
[54:34] depression when wanted in a neighborhood
[54:36] to cook a mess of beans and we'd all
[54:38] come in and eat from that and she said
[54:40] I'll announce my children at the table
[54:42] if you'll only build a tabernacle
[54:45] and my calling was an evangelist the
[54:48] morning laying right here at this
[54:50] Cornerstone we could burst in every
[54:52] night you'll see your fly leaf off my
[54:53] Bible where he told me to be an
[54:56] evangelist see and I wasn't a successful
[54:58] Pastor never would be because I haven't
[55:02] got the patience and what it takes to be
[55:04] a pastor see so therefore if I tried to
[55:06] Pastor I would just be as far out as the
[55:09] pastor is trying to be an evangelist see
[55:11] what I mean you see the way the Lord
[55:13] calls you what your position is in the
[55:15] body is there a question
[55:19] do all holy ghost Theo people speak with
[55:23] tongues sooner or later that's the first
[55:26] question do all holy ghost that's it's
[55:28] all in one question I got it lauded here
[55:30] for number four question but uh I'll say
[55:34] this first you see do all holy ghost
[55:36] people speak with tongues sooner or
[55:39] later
[55:40] I find where Paul said he spoke with
[55:44] more tongues than them all
[55:47] all right question number four
[55:50] do all speak with tongues when receiving
[55:53] the whole or no said do all speak with
[55:55] tongues
[55:58] no do all the Holy Ghost feel people
[56:01] speak with tongues sooner or later
[56:04] now
[56:06] brother
[56:07] I this is a deep question now you
[56:10] probably I probably have some answers
[56:11] back on this
[56:14] the Holy Spirit
[56:17] part of the holy spirit is justification
[56:22] that's when you first God has to call
[56:25] you
[56:26] or you'll never be called
[56:28] there's nothing you can do in yourself
[56:30] no man can come to me except my father's
[56:32] drawing first is that right
[56:35] so part of justification is the Holy
[56:38] Ghost have you heard me explain to that
[56:41] Lutheran Dean that time about the
[56:43] cornfield see the car and a man went out
[56:46] playing two they're playing this corn
[56:48] field next morning he went out nothing
[56:50] natural while he found two little blades
[56:52] sticking up he said praise God for my
[56:54] cornfield I said did he have a cornfield
[56:57] and the Lutheran Dean said potentially I
[57:00] said that is right potentially he did
[57:02] but I said was you lutherans by and by
[57:06] the shoots grew up and it come to a
[57:08] tassel that was Methodist the second
[57:10] stage of the Corn it's a tussle I think
[57:14] that's right you brother from the farm
[57:15] and then the Apostle looks back down to
[57:18] the leaf and says I'm a tassel you're
[57:21] just a leaf see I don't need you no more
[57:24] and then the tassels the pollen drops in
[57:27] the castle back into the leaf again
[57:30] has to have to leave and then from that
[57:33] brings forth the ear that was Pentecost
[57:35] the restoration of the gifts like went
[57:38] into the first place back to the
[57:40] original
[57:41] then when the ear come out said I don't
[57:44] need you tossle or neither do I need you
[57:46] leaf but after all the same life that
[57:48] was in the
[57:50] the blade of corn
[57:52] made
[57:54] the tassel
[57:55] and what was in the blade and the tassel
[57:58] made the grain
[58:00] so what is the holy spirit speaking in
[58:03] tongues is an advanced justification
[58:07] see what is the Pentecostal Church the
[58:11] advanced Lutheran
[58:13] see
[58:14] but now when the advancing has come the
[58:18] question would be this
[58:19] then shall I just remain
[58:22] no
[58:24] no the corns matured see you start off
[58:27] with the green I start off with the the
[58:30] word the green it'll produce
[58:32] justification
[58:33] and stay in justification until it
[58:36] produces sanctification
[58:37] stay in sanctification till you receive
[58:39] the Holy Ghost now when you receive the
[58:42] Holy Ghost
[58:43] what will it do what is
[58:47] still got a question haven't you all
[58:49] right what is speaking with tongues
[58:52] speaking with tongues is nothing but a
[58:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost that justified
[58:57] you
[58:58] and Sanctified you it's so filled now
[59:01] I've wanted I wanted this question God
[59:04] knows I never knew the name is going to
[59:06] ask answered or asked him I said too if
[59:09] it gets too hot in here open my door if
[59:10] you get sleepy or something I want you
[59:11] to get this
[59:13] time because it it's really a little
[59:16] warm might make you get sleepy now
[59:20] notice notice this
[59:24] justification sanctification the baptism
[59:27] the Holy Ghost I look here here it is
[59:30] let me illustrate
[59:31] now I'm down here in the center I'm
[59:33] walking this way
[59:35] once after a while something speaks to
[59:38] me and nothing can turn me but God is
[59:41] that right
[59:42] I'm turning this away
[59:45] now when I turn around that's my
[59:47] justification is that right now the
[59:49] picture is my object of going
[59:53] now
[59:56] I want you to place where I can feel
[59:58] good around them see I'm justifying I
[1:00:01] come to this stage here where I can talk
[1:00:04] to him because I still ashamed of myself
[1:00:06] I still smoke
[1:00:08] I still lied done a little sneaking
[1:00:11] things that I want to do an all-time ups
[1:00:14] and downs ups and downs but I won't even
[1:00:15] cleanse me from all those things so I
[1:00:17] can really walk up to him and talk to
[1:00:18] him see all right here it is it's stage
[1:00:21] of sanctification what did it do
[1:00:23] straighten me up then now
[1:00:27] I'm going on to the Holy Spirit see and
[1:00:31] when I get into here I'm in the Holy
[1:00:33] Spirit buy a baptism
[1:00:37] is that right
[1:00:38] what does the Holy Spirit do it gives me
[1:00:41] power
[1:00:42] to be a preacher
[1:00:45] power to be a singer
[1:00:47] power to speak with tongues
[1:00:50] power to interpret them
[1:00:52] is full of power for the holy spirit is
[1:00:54] the power of God it was the power of God
[1:00:57] to turn me around
[1:00:58] is the power of God that Sanctified me
[1:01:01] now it's the power of God that's filmed
[1:01:03] now on a certain occasion I'm standing
[1:01:06] here and I'm trying to say something the
[1:01:08] power of God comes up on me in such a
[1:01:10] great way till I just can't speak no
[1:01:11] more
[1:01:16] here it is I'm going to illustrate it
[1:01:19] this way I'm going to talk to you
[1:01:20] Brethren so it should be sure to give
[1:01:24] huh
[1:01:25] I do brother

[1:02:18] this other now I'm gonna this is cleaned
[1:02:20] and set aside for our service this is
[1:02:23] coming into service now we all know that
[1:02:26] the word sanctify is a Greek word a
[1:02:29] compound Greek word it means cleaned and
[1:02:31] set aside far service the vessels was
[1:02:34] cleansed by the altered Sanctified by
[1:02:37] the order instead aside forest service
[1:02:39] but to be in service is to be filled and
[1:02:41] putting service now I go over here
[1:02:45] and now I'm coming in to serve now it
[1:02:48] was God's attorney
[1:02:50] hear me hear me you get what I mean see
[1:02:54] and here yeah yeah
[1:02:57] yeah
[1:03:00] that's it all right
[1:03:04] and I believe this now I do not believe
[1:03:08] that speaking in tongues is any evidence
[1:03:10] of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:12] it isn't because I have seen witches
[1:03:15] Wizards
[1:03:17] snake handlers
[1:03:19] Devils everything else speaking tongues
[1:03:23] and it is not an infallible Act of God
[1:03:26] when you speak in tongues that you've
[1:03:28] got the Holy Ghost but remember the Holy
[1:03:30] Ghost does speak in tongues and the
[1:03:31] devil can impersonate it the the
[1:03:34] evidence that you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:03:36] is the life that you live see by their
[1:03:39] fruits you shall know them in the fruit
[1:03:40] of the spirit is not nowhere in the
[1:03:43] scripture found speaking in town
[1:03:45] the fruit of the spirit is love joy
[1:03:48] Faith long-suffering goodness meekness
[1:03:49] channels patience now that is the fruit
[1:03:53] that's what you find on the tree you
[1:03:54] tell what kind of a tree it is see
[1:03:56] that's what man are looking to you
[1:03:58] preachers and to you deacons and you
[1:04:01] trust thieves you evangelist
[1:04:03] you can speak in tongues out here on
[1:04:05] this street all day long they'll never
[1:04:07] believe you
[1:04:08] but you live what you're talking about
[1:04:11] you show Sweetness in all the roots of
[1:04:13] bitterness is out of you
[1:04:15] then
[1:04:16] man will realize or something it's
[1:04:18] speaking in tongues now I do believe
[1:04:21] this that sometime another that a
[1:04:24] Spirit-filled person
[1:04:27] that lays under the altar of God
[1:04:30] will speak with tongues but I've seen
[1:04:33] many speak with tongues that never know
[1:04:34] nothing about God
[1:04:36] see see know nothing about him at all
[1:04:39] and they still speak with tongues any of
[1:04:41] those gifts can be impersonated see but
[1:04:44] the fruit of the spirit proves what the
[1:04:46] spirit is on the inside you bear the
[1:04:50] witness of the life of Jesus Christ
[1:04:52] because if these peach trees snap in an
[1:04:54] apple tree it'll bear peaches and shoes
[1:04:56] or that's right because it's a life
[1:04:59] that's inside of it now
[1:05:01] that's the same thing it is here but now
[1:05:04] I thought I could get this to you all so
[1:05:07] that we could all know the same thing I
[1:05:09] believe that a Spirit-filled person
[1:05:12] that now he comes into Christ by baptism
[1:05:15] and just
[1:05:17] that is not speaking with tongues is not
[1:05:20] evidence of a baptism
[1:05:22] see
[1:05:23] a baptism you can be baptized into the
[1:05:27] devil's power
[1:05:29] and speak in tongues with the baptism of
[1:05:32] the devil's deceiving Spirit how many
[1:05:34] times have we seen it done how many
[1:05:35] times have I seen it done I even order
[1:05:38] them drinking blood out of a human skull
[1:05:40] and speaking in tongues I've seen the
[1:05:42] snake dancers on the desert when they
[1:05:44] wrap this big snake around them and go
[1:05:46] along speaking the wizard come out like
[1:05:47] that and they speak in tongues and
[1:05:48] interpret it I've entered a witch camps
[1:05:51] where they lay a pencil down like that
[1:05:52] and put a book down like this and a
[1:05:53] pencil run up down a stole pipe play
[1:05:55] shaving a hair cut two bits and right
[1:05:57] now knowing tongues and a wizard
[1:05:58] interpreted and tell exactly what
[1:06:00] happened
[1:06:01] I I know that myself see so I see you
[1:06:04] can't Paul said where there's tongues
[1:06:06] they shall cease where there's
[1:06:08] prophecies it'll fail
[1:06:09] where all these gifts they'll soon be
[1:06:11] done away with we got the question a
[1:06:13] little later
[1:06:14] but when that which is perfect has come
[1:06:15] that which is in part is done away see
[1:06:18] so we want the perfect thing brother and
[1:06:20] see we've seen too many things bogus and
[1:06:23] give the wrong interpretation to it and
[1:06:25] don't never face a person and and
[1:06:28] believe it they got the Holy Ghost
[1:06:29] because they speak in tongues but you
[1:06:31] believe they have the Holy Ghost because
[1:06:33] of the fruits that they bear for Jesus
[1:06:35] said buy their fruits you shall know
[1:06:37] them that's right father fruit now but
[1:06:40] uh now let me just not get away from
[1:06:42] that now because I don't want to
[1:06:44] dishonor a great gift that God has given
[1:06:47] see and I believe that a Spirit-filled
[1:06:50] man or woman or a child that lives under
[1:06:54] the altar of God
[1:06:56] won't live there long until he'll be
[1:06:58] speaking with tongues see I believe that
[1:07:01] he will do it or she now you can receive
[1:07:03] the Holy Ghost and maybe you didn't
[1:07:04] speak with tongues when you get but if
[1:07:07] you constantly lay there before God all
[1:07:08] the time is baptism after baptism
[1:07:10] striking you something's going to take
[1:07:12] place see you'll get so full someday you
[1:07:14] can't talk nothing else do you you try
[1:07:17] to say something you just can't say it
[1:07:18] no more you just can't say it and many
[1:07:20] times if people realize that that was
[1:07:22] the Holy Spirit they go ahead and just
[1:07:24] open their heart up and let God speak to
[1:07:26] them
[1:07:27] the Bible said with stammering lips
[1:07:30] and with other tongues will I speak to
[1:07:33] this people Isaiah 28
[1:07:36] 28 18. now with stammering lips and with
[1:07:39] other tongues will I speak what is a
[1:07:41] stammer somebody who can't talk
[1:07:46] just it's stammer is trying
[1:07:48] to see this so full of spirit he's
[1:07:50] trying to say all right let's go say a
[1:07:52] brother
[1:07:54] to Jack Jackson seat like that you're
[1:07:56] trying to you can't say it see that's so
[1:07:59] filled with the spirit I want to ask you
[1:08:01] brother have you ever felt the Holy
[1:08:03] Ghost shake you so bad that you just
[1:08:04] couldn't hardly say nothing we just said
[1:08:06] quite some time just sat there and cry
[1:08:08] have you did that well that's a Holy
[1:08:10] Ghost
[1:08:11] if you don't the reason people don't
[1:08:13] speak with tongues many times they don't
[1:08:15] know how to yield themselves to the
[1:08:16] spirit and they're looking for something
[1:08:18] way off when it's right on them that's
[1:08:21] reasonable and then some people just get
[1:08:23] yourself worked up any emotion and say a
[1:08:25] bunch of words that has no meaning to it
[1:08:27] and still ain't got the Holy Ghost and
[1:08:29] try to say they have because he spoke in
[1:08:30] him
[1:08:31] ah they're fruits you shall know them
[1:08:33] now is there a question
[1:08:36] yes brother
[1:08:41] No Doubt
[1:08:43] about
[1:08:44] a long time
[1:08:50] thank you brother Jackson
[1:09:01] that's right
[1:09:09] that's about the way I did it too
[1:09:10] brother Jackson I received the baptism
[1:09:12] the Holy Ghost back in my shed see in
[1:09:15] about a year later or something like
[1:09:17] that I was uh
[1:09:20] I was a
[1:09:22] spoken tongues and about
[1:09:24] a year or two ate that I was preaching
[1:09:27] again in a church and I stand up on the
[1:09:29] platform like this night when I was
[1:09:31] young wasn't as stiff and old as I am
[1:09:33] now I could get around a little bit I'd
[1:09:35] very emotionally preaching I stand there
[1:09:37] preaching and I just jumped up on her
[1:09:39] desk it was on a Baptist Church
[1:09:41] Middletown Baptist Church and went right
[1:09:43] down into the aisle preaching this as
[1:09:44] hard as I could preach like that and
[1:09:46] just as a stop preaching something just
[1:09:48] had me all carried away instead
[1:09:50] several words four or five or six words
[1:09:53] and unknown tongues and before I knew
[1:09:55] what I was doing I heard myself calling
[1:09:58] out the rock in a weary land the shelter
[1:10:01] in a time of Storms and then one day
[1:10:03] coming down a railroad track I was
[1:10:05] walking down the railroad track this
[1:10:06] side of Scottsburg coming down the
[1:10:08] railroad track patrolling winds blowing
[1:10:10] hard oh mine ice all over the track and
[1:10:13] I crossed the horse like I walked down
[1:10:15] my thirty three thousand 66 went up the
[1:10:17] other way and kind of went parallel to
[1:10:19] the track and I was coming down the
[1:10:21] track and all of a sudden I was walking
[1:10:23] on there I sang and I always sing I had
[1:10:25] different places where I went to pray
[1:10:26] and I was going along our singing and
[1:10:27] all at once to come to find out I was
[1:10:29] speaking in tongues
[1:10:31] see not knowing what I was doing
[1:10:33] speaking in tongues comes in such a
[1:10:35] combustion that the person hardly knows
[1:10:37] what they're doing or they don't know
[1:10:39] what they're saying and interpretation
[1:10:41] is the same way they know not what
[1:10:42] they're going to say they have no more
[1:10:44] idea they're going to say it because
[1:10:45] it's supernatural so as long as you get
[1:10:48] the natural in it then you don't you you
[1:10:50] got natural you see but if something
[1:10:53] just grabs you and takes a hold of you
[1:10:55] and you're doing it
[1:11:06] would have to be an order in service of
[1:11:09] a man couldn't control it
[1:11:11] because he is a man that has yet
[1:11:13] supposed to be controlled he can control
[1:11:15] himself yes just like
[1:11:19] yeah that's right
[1:11:21] that's right he feels it see I like the
[1:11:23] Bible said if if there be one who speaks
[1:11:26] in tongues and there'll be no
[1:11:27] interpreter then let him hold his peace
[1:11:28] now of course say princess I'm staying
[1:11:32] here or anybody when you're fixing to
[1:11:34] shout
[1:11:35] same thing do you ever feel the power of
[1:11:37] God come on you when you start to shout
[1:11:39] how many ever did that well all of us
[1:11:40] have see you just sit there you feel it
[1:11:43] coming now there's times when you can
[1:11:46] quench that see you hold it see it's not
[1:11:48] right what if you're standing talking to
[1:11:49] the the president in the United States
[1:11:51] are you standing here talking to the
[1:11:53] mayor of the city and you just talk
[1:11:55] about something other right out on the
[1:11:56] street you're talking to a bunch of
[1:11:57] people and all at once you just felt
[1:11:59] like you could jump up and down and
[1:12:00] scream the Lord Glory Hallelujah kick
[1:12:02] against everything right up down the
[1:12:03] street like that they'd say it's crazy
[1:12:05] he didn't say that man's crazy see well
[1:12:08] see you know better than to do that then
[1:12:10] although it's just digging down in you
[1:12:12] you just can't hardly hold it you say
[1:12:13] yes sir
[1:12:14] yes sir
[1:12:16] yeah yes sir boys he's just digging into
[1:12:18] pieces but you know to hold your piece
[1:12:20] right there
[1:12:21] like in a courthouse you're not long ago
[1:12:23] they had some Pentecostals up for for uh
[1:12:27] uh doing something you know they're
[1:12:28] screaming too loud or something which it
[1:12:30] was
[1:12:31] absolutely legitimate she's right but
[1:12:34] every time the judge you go to speak go
[1:12:36] to say something to him they'd talk in
[1:12:37] town see the judge said take them crazy
[1:12:40] people away from here see now if they've
[1:12:42] been an interpretation of that tongues
[1:12:43] and told a judge thus saith the Lord
[1:12:45] certain certain thing that would have
[1:12:47] been true thus saith the Lord judge what
[1:12:49] are you standing here judge me for when
[1:12:51] last night you lived with a prostitute
[1:12:53] her name is Sally Jones she lived down
[1:12:55] 44 some certain place like that why do
[1:12:57] you judge me that's thus saith the Lord
[1:12:59] now deny that you'll drop dead
[1:13:02] ah oh brother there's something
[1:13:05] different there but when you stand to
[1:13:07] speak and he said you're a barbarian to
[1:13:08] him see you know when to hold your peace
[1:13:10] and when not to do it see that's see on
[1:13:13] you get me straight now you know what I
[1:13:15] mean see that is certainly we got that
[1:13:16] question right on down here the reason I
[1:13:18] was holding it like this we got the same
[1:13:19] thing or they're supposed to hold a
[1:13:21] piece that's reason I didn't answer it
[1:13:22] out no more than what she was saying but
[1:13:24] that's the time answer it now and see
[1:13:26] right now we'll get it also on this
[1:13:28] question down here and I'll just refer
[1:13:29] back to it does everybody understand
[1:13:31] that question all right
[1:13:32] that yes brother friend
[1:13:45] certainly
[1:13:46] yes sir Cedar calls the Holy Spirit
[1:13:48] speaks in every language see on day of
[1:13:51] Pentecost every language under Heaven
[1:13:52] Must gather together see speaking in
[1:13:54] English now I always know this uh
[1:13:57] brother Freddie myself that I'm if I
[1:14:01] ever preach a sermon is any anointing to
[1:14:02] it it's the spirit given the utterance
[1:14:04] just see it said see so that would be an
[1:14:06] unknown time
[1:14:08] to a man that didn't understand English
[1:14:10] but yet and it's like the unknown tongue
[1:14:13] is not an unknown tongue it's it's
[1:14:15] somebody there like on the day of
[1:14:17] Pentecost he said all these Sinners and
[1:14:18] said how do we hear every man in our own
[1:14:21] language how do we hear these galileans
[1:14:24] speak in our own language there was no
[1:14:27] Unknown about that at all there's no
[1:14:28] such a thing as unknown tongues at
[1:14:30] Pentecost
[1:14:31] and see that's not scriptural at all see
[1:14:33] it wasn't unknown it wasn't no unknown
[1:14:35] tongue it was a language how here we
[1:14:38] every man
[1:14:40] in our own language wherein we were born
[1:14:42] nothing Unknown about it all see
[1:14:45] is that any question on that now right
[1:14:47] now before we leave it
[1:14:49] how here we ever a man in our own
[1:14:51] language things
[1:14:57] people will will fail to uh accept
[1:15:00] anything or they say I won't believe it
[1:15:03] anyway on that cardiac's people well if
[1:15:06] they had it according to Acts 2 4 they
[1:15:08] certainly wouldn't speak in an unknown
[1:15:09] time
[1:15:11] and the language of the people heard you
[1:15:13] see because every man heard in his own
[1:15:15] language now if I receive the Holy Ghost
[1:15:17] right now according to I say I believe
[1:15:19] there's one brother here seeking the
[1:15:20] Holy Ghost which is is uh as uh brother
[1:15:24] wood is that right brother wood I don't
[1:15:25] mean to call you out but at all we're
[1:15:27] just Brethren here and we're wanting to
[1:15:28] say this and um he's seeking the baptism
[1:15:30] the Holy Ghost
[1:15:31] now
[1:15:33] if brother Banks receive the Holy Ghost
[1:15:34] there the correct way if he received
[1:15:37] according to the Bible he'd rise up
[1:15:38] there speaking he's speaking in English
[1:15:40] and saying Jesus Christ the son of God
[1:15:43] has raised he speak it with fiery
[1:15:46] prophecies that tells it I know that he
[1:15:49] is because he's just come into my heart
[1:15:50] he's a Son of God my sins are gone
[1:15:53] there's nothing happened to me see there
[1:15:55] you are that's speaking in the how here
[1:15:58] are we ever men in our own language
[1:16:00] say what if we Indiana people spoke a
[1:16:03] different language from the Kentucky
[1:16:04] people and brother Banks is a Kentuckian
[1:16:06] they spoke a different language then and
[1:16:09] here we know that he couldn't speak
[1:16:10] Indiana language and then he raised up
[1:16:13] there speaking and in the in Indiana
[1:16:15] language you know what he don't know it
[1:16:17] see and we hear him in Indiana language
[1:16:20] he's thinking he's speaking Kentucky
[1:16:21] language he's just testifying praise God
[1:16:25] Jesus is raised in the dead Hallelujah
[1:16:27] but we're hearing him
[1:16:29] in Indiana language that's what it was
[1:16:32] on a day of Pentecost see how do we hear
[1:16:35] every man see or behold are not all
[1:16:39] these which are speaking galileans
[1:16:42] see kentuckians
[1:16:45] and how do we Indiana Ohio and Illinois
[1:16:48] and Maine and Massachusetts and
[1:16:50] Californians hear him in our language
[1:16:55] wherein we were born get the ID see it's
[1:16:58] inspiration see it's inspiration to them
[1:17:01] to hear its inspiration to them see the
[1:17:03] mess the thing of this is the testimony
[1:17:06] of the resurrection of Jesus Christ see
[1:17:09] that's right now if God doesn't live
[1:17:11] that life in you no matter how much you
[1:17:13] testify of it you still didn't get it
[1:17:15] dude that's right how were you is there
[1:17:18] another question now
[1:17:22] yes very good brother Roy it was at uh
[1:17:25] at the right where I'm going now yeah
[1:17:27] but uh Beaumont was it Beaumont yes sir
[1:17:29] now the prayer line was stopped there's
[1:17:31] a little Spanish girl come up on the
[1:17:33] platform
[1:17:34] well Frank I believe it's going out
[1:17:35] wasn't it Howard was taking me out and
[1:17:38] um and uh this uh I I heard somebody
[1:17:41] crying his little Spanish girl there oh
[1:17:43] about 15 16 years old right just a kid
[1:17:47] and um and I looked and she had been the
[1:17:49] next prayer car if I'd went ahead I had
[1:17:51] a bunch up there should be in the next
[1:17:52] prayer card I shall bring her on
[1:17:54] so they brought her on up I was going
[1:17:56] over to another meeting and um I said
[1:17:59] bring her on up
[1:18:01] so I come to find out I said to her
[1:18:03] something like this
[1:18:05] um now will you believe if Jesus will
[1:18:07] help me to tell you what's wrong with
[1:18:09] you will you believe that uh that uh he
[1:18:12] will heal you and she just kept her head
[1:18:14] down I thought she must be deaf and dumb
[1:18:15] see so when I looked again I said no
[1:18:19] she just can't speak English
[1:18:21] so they got an interpreter come there
[1:18:23] and I said will you believe it she
[1:18:25] motioned back to it then she could
[1:18:26] understand Through The Interpreter of
[1:18:28] course well then I said now look and I
[1:18:31] saw a vision I said I see you setting by
[1:18:33] an old-fashioned fireplace and a big kid
[1:18:34] will swinging Out full of ears of yellow
[1:18:36] corn you remember that brother right I
[1:18:39] said you overeat that car and when you
[1:18:41] did you fell violently ill and your
[1:18:43] mother puts you on the bed and you
[1:18:44] started with epileptic fits and I said
[1:18:46] you've had him ever since and then she
[1:18:48] turns around to The Interpreter and said
[1:18:50] to him through her own language I
[1:18:51] thought he couldn't speak English or
[1:18:53] speak Spanish
[1:18:55] and he turned to me and said you didn't
[1:18:57] speak Spanish did you I said no
[1:18:59] so we looked on the recorder stop the
[1:19:01] recorders is absolutely
[1:19:04] English
[1:19:06] but then The Interpreter said you tell
[1:19:08] me what he said then see he had his
[1:19:10] interpretation he said you tell me what
[1:19:11] he said and she said the very same words
[1:19:13] back to him and you give it out again
[1:19:15] now she heard me in her own language
[1:19:18] wherein she was born I speak in English
[1:19:21] she heard it in Spanish
[1:19:22] how here we ever men in our own tongue
[1:19:25] War when we were born and the child was
[1:19:26] healed see that's it it's a wonderful
[1:19:29] works of God
[1:19:33] spirit
[1:19:35] ah will not will just be a vessel and
[1:19:38] the one who feels it can't go with what
[1:19:40] whatever he desires that's right exactly
[1:19:42] right and then watch what it's filled
[1:19:44] with then you know where you got the
[1:19:45] holy ghost or not and see just watch
[1:19:47] what it's still with if the if the
[1:19:49] vessel is filled with impurities then it
[1:19:51] Ebbs and not God's vessel but it's
[1:19:54] filled with purities then it is God's
[1:19:57] vessel see what I mean
[1:20:04] oh sure
[1:20:08] and there was another man standing by
[1:20:11] and after what I had said I was sorry
[1:20:13] because I felt that I had said the wrong
[1:20:16] thing and the reason why I felt it was
[1:20:18] wrong because the man who was standing
[1:20:20] there listening could have been offended
[1:20:21] by what I said but later the man who I
[1:20:24] thought was offended was not because he
[1:20:26] heard it other than what I had spoken so
[1:20:29] I said God corrected it because he said
[1:20:31] I was sorry that's exactly right sure oh
[1:20:34] we all we see that I've seen that many
[1:20:36] times yes we all we know we're
[1:20:39] acquainted with those things I'll be
[1:20:40] that with number four do all do all holy
[1:20:44] ghost fill people speak with tongues
[1:20:46] sooner or later
[1:20:48] I find where Paul said I speak with more
[1:20:51] tongues than than them all now what I
[1:20:55] think now to finish the brother's
[1:20:56] question Paul speaking before tongues
[1:20:59] and all Paul was a smart man
[1:21:01] he knowed many languages himself see he
[1:21:04] could speak with he remember when he'd
[1:21:06] get in trial he could speak of this kind
[1:21:07] of tongue or that kind of a tongue or
[1:21:09] whatever it was that's unknown tongues
[1:21:11] to the people but that wasn't
[1:21:12] inspirational that was talk languages
[1:21:14] you seen but uh and uh but I do believe
[1:21:17] that a Spirit-filled person that lives
[1:21:20] under the altar of God no doubt sooner
[1:21:23] or later will have an experience of
[1:21:24] speaking in tongue because that's one of
[1:21:26] the lowest and least things there is
[1:21:28] according to Paul's description if you
[1:21:31] put him in order it's the last thing on
[1:21:32] the line of gifts see it's speaking with
[1:21:34] him but now first you're baptized here
[1:21:38] each one of you all are gifts I'm on the
[1:21:41] outside
[1:21:43] Now by one door one Spirit one door
[1:21:47] enters this room is that right I think
[1:21:49] coming that way can't come in this way
[1:21:51] back that way see how do I get easier my
[1:21:53] brother Roberson Nelson
[1:21:57] um
[1:22:04] well how do I get in by one door
[1:22:07] by one spirit the spirit is there all
[1:22:10] the time oh please see by one spirit I
[1:22:15] am baptized into this fight now this is
[1:22:18] Spirit you are a gift
[1:22:21] to say well that's God I'll go over and
[1:22:23] say there's a there's brother Woods he's
[1:22:28] uh Meredith see oh I had a miracle
[1:22:31] performance because I performed America
[1:22:34] not by one Miracle are we already
[1:22:52] all right I'm baptized into this body
[1:22:55] amen I'm into it now the worst father go
[1:22:59] to YouTube
[1:23:01] Seeley over something close to the door
[1:23:03] no doubt
[1:23:04] this would be one of the first things
[1:23:06] that happened but it might not be I
[1:23:09] might be so much richer in the spirit
[1:23:10] that I could go come over here to
[1:23:11] Brother Wolf
[1:23:13] bypass all the rest of it
[1:23:15] you can't tell me I haven't got the Holy
[1:23:17] Ghost because I'm in this body of a
[1:23:18] baptism but God never brought me in here
[1:23:21] to say well that's God just to sit down
[1:23:24] and I'll take her easy I'm going to
[1:23:25] heaven you know what I mean
[1:23:28] but I could go Plumb back for this here
[1:23:30] come back to there
[1:23:32] you know what I mean I could go from one
[1:23:34] extreme to the other
[1:23:36] or am I the one in the middle or
[1:23:38] anywhere but something will happen
[1:23:39] something's got to take place
[1:23:41] and what is it by the spirit baptism
[1:23:43] shows me that I'm in the body by one
[1:23:46] Spirit you get that brother uh here
[1:23:51] I have to uh I have to give a little a
[1:23:54] couple little testimonies about what
[1:23:57] brother random was saying and I was
[1:23:58] jotting them down
[1:24:00] um
[1:24:02] I know
[1:24:03] a very very good friend of mine
[1:24:07] he I've known him from a whole life
[1:24:09] he was um
[1:24:12] they had meetings I don't know if it was
[1:24:14] at North Side uh well I'll say who was
[1:24:17] it was David Phillips how many know
[1:24:19] Brother David Phillips
[1:24:21] he was um I don't know if the meetings
[1:24:23] were at North Side
[1:24:25] or if they were in Canada
[1:24:29] and there was a lot of people there was
[1:24:31] there was a there was actually there was
[1:24:33] one sister in particular at the altar
[1:24:34] there may have been more people
[1:24:37] but Brother David was praying for some
[1:24:41] of the people and this sister is from
[1:24:43] Quebec Canada I know her well also her
[1:24:46] family well
[1:24:47] and she was asking the Lord I don't know
[1:24:50] if she was seeking the Holy Spirit or
[1:24:53] what she was asking for but she didn't
[1:24:55] speak English
[1:24:57] very well
[1:24:59] and when Brother David
[1:25:01] came up and laid his hands on her and
[1:25:04] started praying
[1:25:06] she heard perfect French
[1:25:09] as Brother David was praying and Brother
[1:25:12] David doesn't know any French
[1:25:14] and she came back afterwards and I think
[1:25:17] she told them Brother David I didn't
[1:25:18] know that you spoke French and he said I
[1:25:20] didn't I don't speak French but as
[1:25:23] brother Branham was saying and I think
[1:25:25] it's Acts 2 and 4 that at the day of
[1:25:28] Pentecost they went out and they were
[1:25:30] praying or they were preaching and
[1:25:32] praying for the people and they were
[1:25:35] praying in not unknown tongues but they
[1:25:38] were praying in other languages that
[1:25:40] they didn't know as the spirit gave them
[1:25:42] utterance
[1:25:43] and they said how can these people
[1:25:45] they're they're not Greeks or they're
[1:25:47] not these these other uh races how can
[1:25:50] they be speaking in our language
[1:25:54] and that is as brother Branham was
[1:25:57] talking about that is one of the tongues
[1:26:00] that we very very seldom see but they're
[1:26:03] very useful I think I gave did I give
[1:26:06] the testimony about brother shabangu and
[1:26:09] how he was fasting and he was asking the
[1:26:12] Lord to give to help him to learn the
[1:26:15] pygmy language in Congo
[1:26:18] and and after a seven day fast brother
[1:26:21] Jonathan he sat down at his meal
[1:26:25] and he got hungry
[1:26:27] and he prayed and he began speaking
[1:26:30] fluently in that language and he is
[1:26:33] today on the field witnessing and
[1:26:36] preaching to the people in the jungles
[1:26:39] of Congo
[1:26:40] so we see we see these things they uh
[1:26:43] they happen they they mentioned the
[1:26:45] Milltown for the brand mentioned the
[1:26:47] Milltown Baptist Church
[1:26:49] I was in Milltown witnessing I just go
[1:26:53] out and try to find somebody to listen
[1:26:56] to me I guess and I was in Milltown
[1:26:59] which is about an hour west of
[1:27:02] Jeffersonville
[1:27:03] and I came to the corner
[1:27:06] and um
[1:27:08] I
[1:27:10] I saw this lady come out of the shop she
[1:27:12] owned this like second-handed store
[1:27:14] right in the middle of town
[1:27:16] and um she came out and she was doing
[1:27:19] something and I asked her I I talked to
[1:27:22] her a little about about the Lord she
[1:27:23] said oh I'm a Christian we talked for a
[1:27:24] while I said you ever hear of William
[1:27:25] Branham
[1:27:27] she said when I was a girl
[1:27:30] she said we had a little church over
[1:27:32] here and she said brother Branham would
[1:27:35] come in every so often and she was one
[1:27:37] of the pastors that we had and and he
[1:27:39] would preach there brother I'm talking
[1:27:41] about the Milltown Baptist Church she
[1:27:44] was there
[1:27:46] and she said they had a pot-bellied
[1:27:48] stove a big cast iron stove and she said
[1:27:51] that that they would March around in the
[1:27:54] winter times with that stove going they
[1:27:56] would March around singing Onward
[1:27:58] Christian Soldiers and the whole church
[1:28:00] would March March around the church
[1:28:02] around that stove she said at the
[1:28:04] sawdust floor and uh you know what she
[1:28:07] did we had such a nice conversation she
[1:28:09] gave me she still had the stove she
[1:28:13] brought me down into the basement I
[1:28:14] think it was of her store and she said
[1:28:17] this is it I was like oh wow
[1:28:20] I've put my hand on it and she said you
[1:28:23] know what you can have it
[1:28:25] so she gave it to me and I brought it
[1:28:27] back and they have it at voice of God
[1:28:29] Recordings now
[1:28:30] but really really sweet lady she talked
[1:28:33] about brother Branham and and the great
[1:28:35] times that they had
[1:28:38] um
[1:28:40] I really appreciated I have to uh I
[1:28:45] gotta read the quote
[1:28:46] um
[1:28:47] paragraph 47 let me go back to it
[1:28:58] brother Branham says uh
[1:29:04] I love this this just made me this made
[1:29:06] me feel so good with all my failures
[1:29:09] that happened every day and and every
[1:29:12] time I try to do something and I fail
[1:29:14] brother Branham said this
[1:29:17] he said when you
[1:29:19] when you were there you were sincere he
[1:29:22] was talking about the brother that was
[1:29:24] preaching and he was doing the best that
[1:29:26] he could and he was preaching and then
[1:29:28] brother bran didn't say what it was and
[1:29:30] he didn't say what it was but he got
[1:29:31] enlightened about something
[1:29:34] and then he said brother Graham should I
[1:29:35] go back
[1:29:36] to those people that I preached to my
[1:29:39] brother Pam said no that made oh that
[1:29:42] made me feel so good about all the
[1:29:44] mistakes that I made he said he says
[1:29:46] when you were there you were sincere
[1:29:49] he says I know the brother as I say
[1:29:51] that's wrote these questions with the
[1:29:53] deepest of sincerity and a real genuine
[1:29:57] Christian
[1:29:58] you did the best that you could do with
[1:30:01] all that you know how to do and that's
[1:30:04] all God requires
[1:30:07] does that make you feel good we all the
[1:30:11] mistakes that we made Lord I tried
[1:30:14] I was I was trying I just that that uh
[1:30:19] that really meant a lot to me I hope it
[1:30:21] meant a lot to you let's stand
