because all honor and glory goes to him so lord we thank you this evening as we gather lord with those that have been washed by the blood the shed blood of the lamb lord those that were precious and dear to you lord you desire to fellowship back with him lord tonight they've come to sing praise lord to worship lord with all their heart with their desire to please you lord father may we receive the blessing that you have for us lord it's it's one thing to come it's another thing to partake to participate lord so let us all draw together lord and let you be pleased mayo you have all honor and glory we ask in jesus christ's name amen you may be seated my name is brother aaron we've been helping the tabernacle here after brother green passed away it's good to have you all here i know some of you have been here before some of you this may be the first time brother branham preached in tucson for the first time at this church in 1961 preached sunday morning a sunday evening and i was sharing a little bit with brother jack dove some of the testimonies some of the history of it right in this space right over here it was there was nobody sitting there and the spanish brothers from tucson had heard brother branham was in town and they got here a little bit late so they sat them all down on that side over there and they are the grandpas and the great grandpas of some of the saints that are still serving the lord today so it it's a it's a uh proud to be part of it but it's god's doing so tonight as they sing and as they worship you join in give your praise because it's all to him amen so talking to some of the folks as they were coming in they love the tucson weather because they're from colorado and maine and they asked us do you have all the seasons here and i said yes we do but you're not here one weekend you might miss one of them they're just fleeting but if you're here summer there's about six variations of it but you know that jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever so let's join our hearts together and i worship together and may god bless you amen amen praise the lord uh i want to thank brother aaron and uh all the um uh the the saints here at tucson tabernacle we just really appreciate you hosting this event tonight some of you all that don't know me i am brother jack duff from sunny south florida and we have weather just like this in florida this time of year so uh but we we thank god to be here tonight and um i just wanted to uh open with a couple things first of all a scripture uh that i want to read to you tonight this is from ii chronicles chapter 20 and verse 20. amen it says and they rose early in the morning and went forth into the wilderness of toccoa and as they went forth jehoshaphat stood in and said hear me o judah and ye inhabitants of jerusalem but we believe in the lord your god so shall ye be established believe his prophets so shall you prosper and when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the lord that should praise the beauty of holiness as they went out before the army and to say praise the lord for his mercy endureth forever when they began to sing and to praise the lord praise uh the lord set ambushments against the children of amman moab and mount seiyer which were come out against judah and they were smitten and i was just thinking on that as the worship is going forth tonight we don't know the condition of every heart that might come into this building tonight some may come free some may come bound and need to be delivered and god is able to use the songs to bring deliverance to somebody right and as as as their worship in the lord i believe uh god sets ambushments on the enemy right and and maybe somebody has not been in church for a long time they just began to feel the presence of the lord and ambushments are being set right and freedom is about to be pronounced on somebody so we're trusting that god will just do great things here tonight let's just keep reading here uh in the scripture um see what verse did i stop at 23 okay thank you verse 24 says i start at 23. okay for the children of oman and moab stood up against the inhabitants uh of mount seir utterly to slay and destroy them and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of seer everyone helped to destroy another and when judah came toward the watchtower in the wilderness they looked unto the multitude and behold they were dead bodies falling to the earth and non-escape and when jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies and precious jewels which they stripped off for themselves more than they could carry away and they were three days in gathering of the spoil it was so much and on the fourth day uh uh actually you know that's good right there i can stop right there um but you know when you just look at that you notice they didn't even have to use a weapon it was anointed from the singing that changed the whole condition and we pray that tonight that the singing will be anointed it's not just about gifts that god has given but it needs to be anointed because it's the anointing that destroys the yoke and now tonight um as i mentioned i'm from i'm from south florida but this choir that you're here tonight is a uh not only a national but international choir and this is one of the products of covet you know they didn't want us to get together and have church and things of this nature but but uh what what some of these young people did brother lisa paul right here stand up for the least stand up for the lease uh let's give him a round of applauses [Applause] brother lee's had an inspiration to kind of put this together and you know how some people use zoom for meetings they were using zoom for rehearsal and uh you know and they were just practicing and we got saints from all over i don't know all the states the ones that i i can think of off the top of my head iowa um kentucky texas maine new york florida virginia colorado north carolina michigan new jersey tucson arizona praise the lord so only god could orchestrate a choir like this and uh and i believe tonight that you are going to be absolutely blessed amen by uh the singing and i will also tell you um you know uh i believe everybody gonna have at least one song that they'll be blessed by at least one so find one that you can enjoy it might be another thing i don't know about that but but just you know what it's young people trying to serve the lord somebody told me i want the choir to start making your way up here um uh get ready for your first song uh but someone just told me this today they said um there was you know we're going through a time where a lot of people are leaving the message but believe it's prophets and you'll prosper that's what we just read in scripture and and uh there was a a statement made by um someone that left a message that said it was their job they felt it was their job to try to get every young person to leave this message and actually i think they got a job that they're going to be put out of work they won't be able to do that and and what you have here tonight are some young people that are determined to serve the lord and in the midst of everything that's that's going on they are still holding on and and we thank god for them can we give them a round of applause as they come [Applause] now uh they are i i have to say this uh i mean they've done an excellent job just you know putting all this together but uh please don't just sit and look at them tonight but end to end and uh you know if you don't mind if you find a song that you're familiar with why don't you stand and be part of the choir out there in the audience amen i want to let you know that tonight there is only one person in the audience and his name is jesus he's the audience tonight god bless you so [Music] so [Music] [Music] what a friend we have in jesus [Music]

to just get this this this whole night of worship uh together he had contacted me and it was telling me that you know we want to have a brother just kind of come and just just give a testimony to share and you know just certainly appreciate the singing but i think it's also good to hear what the lord is doing amen and lives of others and and uh they wanted we have brother josiah um that's going to come last night i heard brother josiah sing at the banquet and and i said good god oh mighty uh i was blessed uh him and sister michaela you know i believe i said wow you know but we were we were just thoroughly blessed by that but tonight brother josiah is going to come and he's going to share a man of testimony with us amen god bless let's say praise the lord as he comes [Applause] god bless you it's good to see you all here i'm very thankful for this choir that has come together as brother jack said a product of covid well i guess i could say i am also a product of covid that's when the lord got a hold of my life is when is when i wasn't in church that's when he got a hold of me when i was away from all that he had to i guess pull me to the back side of a desert and here i am in tucson in the desert now after all this i'm very thankful for the choir i haven't been asked to speak many times and i certainly haven't been asked to speak after talent like that that and the lord really using every gift up here i'm so thankful for all of you and the love i've felt this weekend from this group has been so real such christian love it's it's so contagious these it's so wonderful to meet all of you and get to share in worshiping the lord together so you know first john 4 8 says that if you don't love you don't know god it says he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love and that's something we need today i can tell you when god got a hold of my life it wasn't powerful preaching it wasn't the seven seals it wasn't all those things are great it was people showing christian love to me that brought me back from the life i was living back to this this glorious this glorious faith i want to read you a verse of scripture that the lord laid on my heart if you'd like to stand with me comes out of revelation 3. and um before we read that let's bow our heads dear heavenly father i thank you lord jesus that we are all gathered here to worship you lord jesus that's what we want to do with our lives may we live worshiping you and glorifying you may we live a testimony lord jesus i pray that lives will be touched i pray that you would calm my nerves lord jesus and lord may your word come forth i pray lord jesus you'd anoint this this scripture as it goes forth and may may people understand and may your word come in power in jesus name amen revelation 3 20 says behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me you may have your seats now like many of you here i grew up in a message church we call them message churches they preach the message of william branham as you all know i grew up in that church and i tried under my own ability for years and years and years and years to live the right kind of life and i just failed and failed and failed i tried i was there at the camps i was there at the services i worshiped i sang and i did everything i thought i had to do and i still just felt like i was coming up short time after time and i was wondering lord what what do i have to do you know i'm trying to find it for myself all these years and there's one thing wrong about that though all those things i did were good they all started with i and me when the focus needs to be on him you need to let him take control and that's what i didn't do up until cove it happened when i had to give everything to the lord now tonight i can tell you what he did for me and i can't tell you what he's done for you but i can tell you what he can do for you by what he's done for me so if i were to take a title tonight it would be the love of god and we read the scripture god is love the love of god so i was raised in a church and i was raised in a christian school going to devotions every morning and i left that school and i went to public school and began to go the way of the world and go the wrong way be amongst the wrong crowds participate in the wrong things and i have scars today because of it and brother branham says in thirst that if that if that wolf gets a hold of the deer and gets him if he doesn't get to water he's going to die now i can tell you when i was going the wrong way and doing things i shouldn't do i was smoking i was drinking i was doing things to my body that i knew were wrong but i never disbelieved the message and i never disbelieved the bible i couldn't do that in my heart i still believed but what i was doing is i was going the wrong way down the freeway because i was supposed to be in this lane going that way but instead i was in this lane going that way and what happens if you go the wrong way on the freeway you're to get hit and you're going to die because you're doing it your own way and i can tell you i reached a point in my life in in my i'm trying to go fast i've got 15 minutes but i reached a point where i was out one night and i was doing things i shouldn't do and it was almost like an audible voice was in my head saying sinner why would you sin away your day of grace sinner why would you sin away your day of grace over and over and over again and i couldn't it was just like all around me just this voice sinner why would you sin away your day of grace sinner why would you sin away your day of grace i thought it was too late i thought why else would i hear this voice why else would i hear this voice and i can tell you if your life isn't right with the lord and you know the truth if you've been raised in a church like i have what the world will give you if you are lucky and i shared this with brother brooks earlier if you are lucky 10 pleasure and 90 pain and defeat and failure if if you are lucky that's if you are lucky and it ends in suffering and death as the scripture tells us that's the wages of sin and this road that we walk as christians is much harder it is much harder and it may seem every day like you can't do it and you're just a failure and you're so low but the payments are a lot different than the wages of sin amen all of my brothers myself and two other brothers are serving the lord today that's a result of parents who prayed and who believed on god that's the payment of this faith now i'm not a father i may never be a father but or if it's your brother or sister they're not gone there's not there's still hope for them we ought to have faith to believe for our lost loved ones don't give them up because i thought i was i was hopeless and the lord could still do something for me now with this faith and with this blessing that we have you'll forgive me i'm still a little bit nervous but i'm just trying to get this made clear to you with this faith there's victory joy love any the end result of eternal eternal life but we have a much greater responsibility right we have a greater responsibility because we know things that most people do not know and it is not our job to be condescending and to judge others for their state now i told you at the beginning that when the lord got a hold of my life it wasn't because i was in a powerful service i believe in powerful services and powerful preaching people get saved that wasn't my testimony but i still believe in it was people reaching out to me and saying brother how are you doing we should go out to coffee and bringing me back into that atmosphere and i tell you if you know the truth and you're in that atmosphere you can't last long in the world amen people reaching out to me and i had friends who were christians friends who were raised in the message like myself friends who were not christians all the different i guess types of different people i met uh at school and in the world that had all the same struggles who were doing all the same things as me and when the lord got a hold of my life i never went the way of the world again and a lot of those friends are still going that way but i still believe that god can do for them what he can do for me now you might have made a decision in your life to come to this message come to this faith and god will reward you for that by giving you your heart's desire so if you have someone wayward god got a hold of you that righteous seed is in you he can still get a hold of your family he can still get a hold of your friends love god is love we need to have that on display because that's how god got a hold of me is by his love through the believers i want to read another verse of scripture and it's in matthew 5 and it is blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled now we all have a little place in our heart that's thirsting for something and i tried to fill it with something else and i was robbing god of that place in my heart that place belongs to god and the devil would love to come in and take control of that and fill it up so there's no room for god and as jesus said to peter he would love to sift you as wheat and if i would have stayed out there too much longer i believe i wouldn't be here today i might not be on this earth anymore but that thirst you cannot give it to the devil like i said before ten percent pleasure if you're lucky and ninety 90 defeat pain suffering and death so i pray tonight that you would see and you would feel where that place in your heart you'd know to give it to god the talents that he's given you the gifts that he's given you just give them back to god and watch him take over as brother lincoln said last night you it may look like you are sacrificing a lot a lot of friendships a lot of opportunities but he will give back in ways you never imagined amen i sang last night and i always want to sing for god's glory and people from new york and los angeles wanted me to come there and sing and sing in secular songs and in uh i wouldn't do it and it seemed at the moment like it was a big sacrifice and i went around in a time of my life discouraged you know i had this great opportunity but being here this weekend no one out there is talented like you no one out there sings like you because you're anointed for the right purpose and when we worship we're anointed to worship him and that's the greatest thing we could do so let's stand up and uh do i have a piano player that could come we're just going to sing a little my life is a result of amazing grace i was a wretch there's no word lower to describe someone than a wretch i was a wretch but by god's grace i'm here today amen amazing grace grace how sweet the [Music] sound that saved [Music] like me and i wants was but now how i am found oh i was blind [Music] but now i see through many dangers toils and snares [Music] many toys and many snares [Music] his grace [Music] amazing grace [Music] grace how sweet [Music] like me [Music] everybody say praise god praise god praise god praise praise god [Music] hallelujah [Music] give the lord a hand of praise [Music] as the choir makes their way back amen as the choir makes their way back brother josiah we really really appreciate you sharing your heart amen with us tonight and just the grace of god and i just love the the statement that he makes there um and i think this is a warning that all not just the young people but everybody in here need to hear that when satan tricks you to get you to start going in the things of the world uh that statistic that he gave it says ten percent pleasure ninety percent pain and death and suffering and sorrow that's that's that those are not good stats for serving the devil amen but i can tell you this much when you serve the lord jesus is 100 satisfaction guaranteed you'll never go wrong serving the lord amen thank you brother josiah god richly bless you amen uh i wanted to call the choir a man at this at this time i was listening to brothers of cyanide and the song that i saw here on the list amen waymaker miracle worker promise keeper light in the darkness my god that's who you are amen and i believe that's what he was amen to brother josiah man so let's have the choir amen sing that for us on tonight and just stay in your place say man after that song i'll come back and tell you what we'll do next [Music] i worship you i worship you [Music] you are here [Music] working in this place i worship you [Music] i worship you i worship you you are here [Music] working in this place i

cross for your sin and there's a reason why we're here tonight amongst believers because the lord said behold i will send you elijah the prophet and there's a body of believers here tonight because

she's one of the lead singers there in the song and she was singing it one sunday [Music] and um you know one of the other blessings in covet is that there's a lot of people that go to church but not actually at your church when church starts if you get what i'm saying that means they stream they stream so we got a lot more streamers amen during covet than we than we you know ever really had it was a blessing a man and there was a sister who sent a testimony into the church he says you know um i had a son 15 years old he's been dealing with cancer and um you know we've been taking him to get his treatments and things that nature but just believing god that somehow god was going to heal him of this cancer but we just had to go the way of you know just the way the doctors were advising us and she said and while we were under treatment for him all of a sudden i i developed something on the inside of my nose and it just began to get stopped up and i just couldn't understand what was going on and she says i i went to the doctor and the doctor says yeah you got a growth there and we're gonna have to take it out by surgery she said well i just can't have surgery at this moment because i'm going through all this chemotherapy with my son and radiation i just don't want to do surgery on myself at the same time she said i'm going to have to wait until after he finishes before i'll come in for surgery and while she was waiting she was at home and she heard this song your goodness is running after it's running after me your goodness is running that it's running after me she was just singing that and streaming the service while the service was going live and she got out of room and she just began to sweep in her house and just entering into the song while she was sweeping and before you know it she let out a big sneeze then she let out another sneeze and she went and grabbed something she said i don't know something just happened and when she looked down something that

say doc i was at home and i was watching the service and you know and all of a sudden i just sneezed and when i sneezed you know just came out he looked and said look like we don't need to do surgery

idea to put all this together and and um it would be almost impossible if brother elise would have did this without including his pastor amen tonight many of us stand on the shoulders of this precious brother as he has revolutionized music in the message and i heard brother lincoln talking about him last night but you know for myself just at a distance at a at a distance and just watching over the years and all the cds that he put out and just every place he goes and he's singing like just blessed by blessed by him um you know he um became really really good friends with with my auntie some of y'all might not know who she is but she wrote a song to say it's already done it's already done the victory is won the battle is over it's already done and she wrote another song so she said it's gonna take a stronger wind than this to keep me from my promises it's gonna take a stronger way than this [Music] sister brenda lewis was my auntie and the lord has called her her home but before he called her home she had a really nice relationship and friendship with brother isaiah brooks and amen so his ministry his music his ministry is preaching everything has been transformational and we really appreciate him being here tonight and he's going to come and sing amen a song for you tonight let's welcome brother isaiah brooks [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so amazing as our brother

for the young people and for all of those who came and participated we thank you for those who sacrificed their time to be here and most of all the church that opened their doors to the situation maybe they can't see it now or may not understand it now but somebody was touched tonight and we'll see somebody who perhaps would not have been in this rapture or in heaven there because of tonight and we so thank you father god because we've done our best and we give our best to you but father as we come to a place of dismissal we want to thank you father and we pray that you will give us
