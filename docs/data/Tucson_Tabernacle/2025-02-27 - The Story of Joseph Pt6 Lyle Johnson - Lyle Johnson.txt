you what you need and she went to show him that she said look here's how much I have in my account and it was supposed to say zero and it had $30 and and she she said wow now I have enough to get home and I have enough for tonight when we ask God for something it may seem small $30 but you would think well why does she just win the lottery or do something like that God has his own way and he provides what we have need of not not our own desires but he provides what we have need of and he's perfect every single time he wants us to be always dependent on him he wants us always to be drawing from that Fountain of Life all the time lord Lord Lord I need this Lord I Want To Praise you and would you provide this and he likes that constant relationship with his son and with his daughter um

nice to see you um but I was talking about about Sunday morning and I look back and I see brother Lio sister Lonnie and and cleano and what the Lord did for for him and the stand that our brother made in coming to the altar giving his heart to the Lord Jesus and then going to baptism what what a great you can never make a better decision in your life that's the most important decision that you will ever make and it's the greatest decision that you will ever make is to vote your life to the Lord Jesus after you have made that decision then comes baptism and that is is in front of everyone saying I am a changed person I am doing this no so it was it really was Sunday was a sermon or a service like I can't I can't remember it was just it was just so wonderful and then the fellowship afterward it just felt good talking with everybody and the the love that everyone was was showing to each other I was even I sent s out my WhatsApp this morning and was almost ready to cry just thanking the lord for the friends that we have and the church that we have and the love that we have for each other and and how that that people will hold each other up and somebody said one time I remember a while back maybe I heard it maybe 15 years ago that it's it's God's sheep just leaning on each other and holding each other up and I believe that's that's what we are we are doing um for for prayer I want to have uh I want to have special prayer brother Jeremy you mentioned that one of the kids has a has an earache if you could bring her up hadasa can you come up and we'll anoint you with oil and pray over you fine young lady that the Lord placed into the hands of brother Jeremy and sister Angela good Godly Parents I baptized her in the name of the Lord Jesus she gave her heart to the Lord as such a young young [Music] lady egg sweetheart this oil that's in this bottle it represents the holy spirit of God the holy spirit is the what God used uses to speak to us many times it's what God uses to heal us and that's what's represented by by this little vial right here in this olive oil so I'm going to anoint you with this oil that means I'm going to put this oil on you in the name of the Lord Jesus and the Bible says that if I do that that you will be healed do you believe the Bible do you believe that if I put this oil on you like the Bible says that you'll be [Music] healed I anoint you with this oil in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Commandment of the Apostle Jame James I put my hand on you father I pray for your healing power pray for your healing to be upon this young lady father may she be delivered May the year a go the year infection go I pray in Jesus name amen amen bless let's let's all stand that's the only prayer request that I have is anyone

head and say Lord this is my request our heavenly father you know the requests that are represented by these hands we bring them to you in the name of the Son of God the name of Jesus Christ and ask Lord that every hand that is raised that each person would be healed or would receive the request that they have whether it be for themselves or whether it be for someone else father may they receive the desire that's upon their heart and Lord may you be glorified in our service tonight father we pray that your anointing would be upon brother Li and and father as he brings out the life of this man Joseph and he reads the scriptures father May the same anointing that wrote those scriptures by men of God May the same anointing be upon our brother tonight and Lord may we receive the same blessing that so many have over these thousands of years that these scriptures have been written down in Jesus Christ name we pray [Music] amen I wanted to share um I was thinking about this song today um um

amen thank you so much God bless you good evening let me try that again good evening good evening there we go we're awake now thank you tonight we'll continue our investigation into the life of Joseph some of the lessons it holds for us and reminder that in the back of the sanctuary by the AV booth there are copies of lists of the Bible verses we're reading and some relevant images some people didn't pick some up previous time so we've got them for all six parts and I looked at the length of the bench there's only enough room for seven so I don't know if we'll finish it next time or we won't but but uh anyway they're back there for you and by the way if if I were subtitling these lessons tonight's might be subtitled road rage road rage well before we resume our study and hopefully no one here is suffering from road rage let's join together in prayer One More Time Lord Jesus Lord we're just in awe of you Lord we feel the presence of your spirit Lord and Lord we're just so grateful that you would come down to visit us Lord that you would come down to be present with us Lord that Lord that each person that's come here with you within them Lord to join together Lord our hearts our minds Lord help us set aside all the burdens and cares Lord that are upon us as just part of daily life Lord realizing how good we really have it even when we have it bad Lord we just pray now that you'd be that you'd continue to be present in this service this evening Lord May the words that are spoken be words that would help and strengthen and encourage us and draw us closer to you and to one another Lord to Bear to bear fruit Lord like that fig tree that the fellow in the orchard said give it give it one more year Lord we just want to bear fruit for you the fruit that you desire Lord we commit this service now and you Lord completely and wholeheartedly in Jesus precious name amen I I'd like to start by reading a short passage from a book to which I very rarely refer now we're in the middle of the story of Joseph a model of Christ in the first book of the Bible Genesis so let's turn to the middle of the last book The revelation of Jesus Christ chapter 12 and I heard a loud voice in heaven saying now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death tonight we'll see a parallel and perfect though it may be the Christ type Joseph bringing his power to Bear to bring Salvation and Reconciliation brought about through the word of the testimony of one who overcame prepared to sacrifice his own life by that very testimony another verse from the New Testament comes to mind in a letter Paul wrote to the fledgling Church in galatia Galatians chapter 6 and verse 7 he says be not deceived God is Not mocked whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also reap please be seated thank you last time we saw the brothers leave heon go to Egypt to buy food because of the famine they had to see a Stern forbidding and powerful man named Zapf panea he was their brother Joseph but they didn't recognize him he sent them back to Canaan with grain their money and a warning that they would never see him again and th must never buy more food unless they brought their brother Benjamin he kept Simeon in prison as a hostage until they returned during this time Joseph overheard a conversation between Reuben and his brothers That Shook him to his very core when the brothers returned and reported to Jacob he refused to let Benjamin go to Egypt but they ran out of food the famine continued finally Judah persuaded his dad to send Benjamin and that Judah would take full responsibility for Benjamin's safe return we then explored the path that Judah took to confront his own failures as he became what he hated about his dad in a dramatic turn of events on on the brink of committing an horrific murder of his own daughter-in-law and unborn Sons Judah recognized what he had become he publicly confessed repented his Canaanite daughter-in-law Tamar thus became the matriarch of the royal line of Judah we entered with the brothers including Benjamin preparing to journey to Egypt face the Fearsome Zapf panea and seek to buy more grain from this strange Egyptian let's pick up our story as Jacob sends his sons to Egypt all substitute Joseph's Egyptian names afnaf Pano and Joseph is in that role or that perspective hopefully clarified some things a little bit Jacob is speaking to his sons as they prepare to depart from heon God Almighty give you Mercy before the man that that he may send away your other brother Simeon and Benjamin if I be bered of my children I am bereaved and the men took that present honey and nuts bomb spices myrr and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin and and Rose up and went down to Egypt a week or more traversing a hot unusually dry desert talking among themselves as they journeyed what will he say when we return the money how will we explain it how's Simeon doing is he okay is he he been abused starved beaten will the man believe this is our brother what will we do if he doesn't or says we stole the money what will happen if he refuses to release Simeon or detains Benjamin what is God doing to us and they stood before Joseph they were awaiting an audience with Zapf pan uh I recognize this map isn't great but it it shows the direct route from from Hebron where they live this will be the direct route down to arrival in the Goan area of Egypt and on down to where Joseph most likely is there's also a sea route this is the the route that they took him into slavery maybe they came down this way and over we don't really know they had to have water for the animals and it's been a time of famine there has to been a lot of rain the oases maybe not such good shape and carrying water is heavy and it reduces the amount of grain that you can carry back if you've got to carry water so we don't really know the exact route they took but it would probably take a minimum of 10 days or so to travel each way if if there's no delays and and you want the animals to stay healthy and and while we're looking at pictures have you ever wondered how long it was between the journeys how long did the grain last anybody think it lasted six months or or a year or more or or less I used to think well they probably made the trip once a year it's a second year of famine coming up so it's probably the second trip they've made and that all seems to make sense but then I thought or was it so let let's think this through for for just a moment a good siiz donkey weighs about 700 PBS now we have really huge donkeys these days but but a good siiz animals about 700 lb and a donkey can safely carry about a 20% of its weight 140 pounds or so of grain now we're told that we need about 1,800 calories a day a cup of grain is about 600 calories so three cups per day per person but let's assume that they're small people and they can supplement their uh their grain with other things so maybe they only need 1,200 calories a day from grain now a cup weighs about 5 ounces so each person needs about 10 ounces or 58 of a pound now we're later told that Jacob's Clan is approximately 70 people so you need 700 ounces a day or about 44 pounds so a donkey can carry enough food to feed every witer Hein for about three days now if the 10 so that's what one donkey can do if the 10 Brothers each had three donkeys they'd be able to feed the clan for about 90 days 12 weeks three months well they had other food sources sheep cattle crop yields were low but probably not zero on the other hand they had to feed the livestock so the bottom line is it's probably only been about three or four months since the first trip to Egypt when they're again on the road when Joseph saw Benjamin with them as they're arriving uh to see him he said to the ruler of his house bring these men home and slay an animal make ready prepare a suitable banquet for these men shall dine with me at noon the man did as Zapf pan bade and the man brought the man into zafaf Pan's house not just a typical Egyptian house a little mud brick uh Thing by the side of the Nile somewhere this is a mansion it's near the Palace of pharaoh and Joseph is not a a minor Royal functionary he's the vizer the second most powerful person and the mightiest nation of the era and area now this is an artist's uh conception of what a huge Palace might have looked like in Egypt about this time there's no remains of anything that's been dug up out of the desert to know for sure and it's doubtful that Joseph's house was quite this spectacular but Egyptians were Master stone masons and artists Joseph's house was impressive designed to inspire awe at the magnificence of Egypt and intimidation at the power of its occupant and the men were afraid because they were brought into Zapf Pan's palatial and intimidating house and they said among themselves why does he want to see us because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time we were brought in he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us take us for for Bond men and our asses it's clear these guys are afraid they're intimidated hearts are pounding in their chest breaths short brains foggy zafra pan would not need to seek occasion against them his Wills the law he can arbitrarily seize them make them slaves kill them whatever and in the midst of Their Fear I think Moses wrote a line that would have had his audience laughing or at least chuckling not at their plight which produced great anxiety and fear but showing their panic in a humorous way look at the last part of the verse he wants to steal our donkeys that's what he's after he's after our donkeys they came near to the steward of zaa Pena's house and and they spoke with him at the door of the house at the entrance to this Palace and they said oh sir we came indeed down at the first time to buy food and and it came to pass when we came to the end that that we opened our sacks they're very nervous in fact only one sack was opened at the end the the rest were opened in Canaan and behold Every Man's money was in the mouth of his sack or money in full weight full weight to understand these weren't coins you weighed silver and a weight of shekels like grams or ounces or something so it's measured by weight our money in full weight and we brought it again in our hand and the other money the other silver we brought down in our hands to buy food we don't know who put the money in our sacks but it wasn't us and and the steward said Peace be to you fear not relax calm down people you are God and the god of your father hath given you treasure in your sacks have you ever thought about that what was the treasure the grain or the silver it was both the grain representing salvation from starvation and the silver representing Christ who paid our debt of sin and here is Joseph paying the debt for their salvation making it a free gift wow I had your money and he brought Simeon out to them and the man brought the men into zafaf Pan's house and gave them water and they washed their feet and he gave their asses provender he didn't take our donkeys yet they must have had a lot of questions for Simeon trying to understand what's happening and they made ready the present provided by Jacob nuts and honey spices bomb and myrr against Joseph came that is before Zapf Pan's expected arrival at noon for they heard that they should eat bread there and when Zapf pan came came home they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house and he's probably thinking oh honey pistachios almond a reminder of the best of the land of Canaan that he'd enjoyed as a boy and a young man and uhoh spices bomb and myrr GH a reminder of his forced march to Egypt so many years ago these items were precisely the three items the ishmaelites were carrying a reminder of the past what his brothers who were now before him had done to him associated with that particular combination of odors and they bowed themselves to him to the Earth and he asked some of their welfare and said through an interpreter to them he still the strange Egyptian ZF MAF pan is your father well the old man of whom you spake is is he yet alive and they they raised their heads and answered thy servant our father is in good health he is yet alive and they bowed down their heads and made obes they they bowed low they prostrated themselves in homage the rabbis say this was an acknowledgment of his asking about their father so they're bowing on his behalf since Jacob is being called thy servant and since Jacob represents the family as a patriarch this represents the Sun and Moon of Joseph's second dream bowing to him and Joseph lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin his mother's son and said is this your younger brother of whom you spake unto me and he said God be gracious unto thee my son what the brothers think why did he say that to Benjamin and Joseph made haste for his bowels did yearn upon his brother and he sought where to weep and he entered into his chamber and wept there and the brothers are wondering why did he suddenly leave what's going on and what is this does this remind you of remember the last time Joseph was weeping by himself while his brothers were preparing to eat that time his chamber was the sistern and Doan so many reminders of his past mistreatment by his brothers and he washed his face and went out and refrained himself and as Zapf pan said set on bread and they set on for him by himself he's an important person and for them the 11 Hebrew Men by themselves and for the Egyptians which did eat with him by themselves because the Egyptians might not eat bread with at the same table as Hebrews for that is an Abomination unto the Egyptians Hebrews are not their favorite people and these Hebrews had just traveled for days through the desert were hairy and bearded and dirty Hebrew Hillbillies and and the 11 Brothers sat were given seats before him the the first born according to his Birthright and the youngest according to his Youth and and the men marveled one or another other translations make it clear that Joseph dictated the order of the seating you sit there you sit there you you're next you sit there anybody have an idea how many different ways 11 people can be arranged if 11 of you were here and to put them in a certain order how many combinations are there of 11 people 39,9 2016, 800 now of course he knew Benjamin was the youngest so the other 10 leave only 3,628 1800 that's an easy problem to S and it's not like they were very different in age it's not like one of them looked like me and one of them looked like Josiah that that would make it easy no not including Benjamin they were all born within seven years of Jacob marrying Leia and Rachel and the four oldest were born before the next seven which means seven of them were born over a period of less than three and a half years to three different mothers and they're all in their early to mid 40s no wonder they marveled you couldn't just look at them and figure it out and this is part of the set up for the next chapter the concept that zafaf panea is capable of divining and zfn panea took and sent servings unto them from before him but Benjamin's portion was five times so much as any of theirs and they drank and were merry with him the Hebrew word Shahar translated as Mary means Tipsy drunk in other words they were all intoxicated they started at noon they had a long party it's a big party the Egyptians the proper people they won't eat with the Hebrews do you see a parallel here with the gospels what did the proper people say of Jesus the son of man came eating and drinking and they say Behold a man gluttonous a wine Biber a friend of publicans and sinners in chapter 47 not tonight we'll see Joseph is a seriously successful Publican stay tuned now chapter 44 and zaap AF pan commanded the steward of his house saying fill the men's sacks with food as much as they can carry more than they paid for and put every man's money in his sacks mouth and put my cup up the silver cup in the sax mouth of the youngest and his grain money and he did according to the word that zafaf pan had spoken the image here is of silver dishes in a cup from the reign of Amon haet 2 the Pharaoh at the time of Joseph's March into slavery and the father of senu and as soon as the morning was light the men were sent away they and their asses this was an all day and all night party it doesn't say they left and summoned him from the in it says they were sent away they came for lunch at Zapf panas and stayed the night oh they got to keep their donkeys and when they were gone out of the city and not yet far off zafaf pan said to his Steward up quickly follow after the men when thou dust overtake them say unto them wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good is not this it in which my Lord drinketh and whereby indeed he dineth ye have done evil in so doing and the steward overtook them and and spake unto them these same words and they said unto him wherefore saith my Lord these words God forbid that thy servant should do according to this thing behold the money which we found in our sack's mouths we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan how then should we steal out of thy Lord's House silver or gold notice they don't dispute that zap Naf P has amazing powers of divination they just saw him pull off a thing with a one in 40 million chance of success with whomsoever of thy servants should be found both let him die and we also will be my Lord's bondmen they know they're innocent they know they haven't taken this they know it and the steward said now also let it be according unto your words he with whom it is found shall be my servant we won't kill him and you shall be blameless not enslaved then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground and opened every man his sack oops they're quick to prove their innocence they want to be on their way home to feed their families and the steward searched and began at the eldest and left at the youngest it doesn't mean that he did it in birth order but he knew who the oldest was and he knew who the youngest was and he left that youngest one Benjamin for last because he knew that's where the silver cup would be he put it there and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack nobody seems surprised that the money is in the sack but that cup that's a big deal then they the brothers all rent their clothes and laided reloaded the sacks of grain onto every man his ass and returned to the city and Judah notice not not Ruben or Benjamin but but Judah and his Brethren came to ZF Pano's house for he was yet there he's waiting for them and they fell before him on the ground and Zapf panus said unto them what deed is it that you have done didn't you know that such a man as I can certainly Divine speaking through an interpreter of course but look who the spokesman is for the group Judah still wearing his torn clothing said what shall we say unto my Lord what shall we speak how shall shall we clear ourselves God ha found out the iniquity of thy servants Judah is not referring to the iniquity of stealing the cup they didn't do it but past nicity regarding Joseph this whole strange set of circumstances going on he says that God is punishing them for their past sin for behold we are now become my Lord's servants we become your slaves both we and he also with whom the cup is found he he's not guilty of the iniquity that we're guilty of he wasn't part of the sin that God is punishing them for and zath panus said God forbid that I should do so but the man in whose hand the cup is found he shall be my slave as for you get you up in peace under your father I don't want to see you anymore get out of here then Judah remember he's the one whose idea was to sell Joseph to the Israelites in the first place Judah knows it Joseph knows it Judah the one who was transformed as we read last time in chapter 38 that Judah came near unto the man he knew is Zapf pan and said oh my Lord let thy servant I pray thee speak a word in my Lord's ear and let not thine anger burn against thy servant thine anger burn an interesting choice of words from Judah who in Anger was going to burn tomorrow for thou art even as Pharaoh my Lord asked his servants saying have you a father or a brother and we said unto my Lord we have a father an old man and a child of his old age a little one might be better thinking as a small one implying that Benjamin is the youngest of us he's not a kid he's 30 years old and his brother is dead Judah doesn't know if Joseph is dead or not only that he was sent into slavery 23 years earlier but Judah is simply reminding zap pan of the contents of the general conversation from their first visit and he alone meaning Benjamin is left of his mother and his father loves him and thou s unto thy servants you said to us bring him down unto me that I may set mine eyes upon him and we said unto my Lord the lad cannot leave his father if he should leave his father his father would die and thou sayest unto thy servants except your youngest brother come down with you you shall see my face no more and it came to pass when we came up to thy servant my father we told him the words of my Lord and our father said go again and and buy us a little food and we said we cannot go down if our youngest brother be with us then will we go down for we may not see the man's face we may not buy Grain except our youngest brother be with us and thy servant my father said unto us you know that my wife bear me two sons one went out from me and I said surely he's torn in pieces and I saw him not since at this Joseph knows his surmise was correct Jacob thought Joseph had been killed just as Ruben said on their first visit if you take this meaning Benjamin also from me and Mischief befall him you shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave now therefore when I come to thy servant my father and the lad be not with us seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life it shall come to pass when he seeth the lad is not with us that that he will die and thy servant shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the Grave for thy servant I Judah became shity for the lad unto my father saying if I bring him not unto thee that and I shall bear the blame to my father forever now therefore I pray thee let thy servant let me abide instead of the lad AB bondman to my Lord and let the lad go up with his brethren for how shall I go up to my father and the lad be not with me lest per Adventure I see the evil that shall come on my father this is a very different Judah he's been transformed by the conclusion of judah's Supplication Joseph realizes several things first his father truly was led to believe Joseph was killed when he didn't return from Dothan with his brothers his conclusion based on Ruben's statement at the end of their first visit as we discussed last time was in fact correct thus Jacob not coming to rescue Joseph is not born BN of a lack of compassion or love but is instead the fruit of Deceit second that Judah the one who arranged his sail to the ishmaelite spice Traders had truly changed he who was willing to condemn Joseph to slaver in Egypt was now asking that he be made a slave in Egypt to spare Jacob further grief third the he Joseph cannot knowingly be the cause of further grief to his dad he cannot retain Benjamin and send the others back to Canaan all of which means he can no longer be Zapf Pena to his family he must once again be Joseph chapter 45 then Joseph could not refrain himself from before all them that stood by him and he cried in egyp Egyptian cause every man to go out from me there stood no man with him none as afnaf Pan's Egyptian staff guards interpreters while Joseph made himself known unto his brothers here we see one of the most often quoted parallels of the life of Joseph and the life of Jesus the first time the brothers were together with Joseph after the famine began Joseph saved him from starvation we spoke of this last time about Jesus being the bread of life and Joseph providing grain bread to sustain Jacob's family the fact that the money was put back in their sacks showing that his gift of life was without cost it was freely given that they could try to pay for it even be convinced that they had earned it but they couldn't they had to accept it as a free gift and this time which is often used to illustrate Jesus Second Coming his brothers the the Jewish Nation will recognize him paralleling teachings about the second coming of Christ were told that azath Joseph's Egyptian wife was in the palace and not present when his brothers recognize Joseph brother brandham mentions this many times in his various sermons we could end the story here end the series on Joseph but Moses didn't and neither will we and Joseph wept aloud and the Egyptians in the house of pharaoh heard Joseph was overcome with emotion and cried out and Joseph not zafaf pan through an interpreter Joseph said unto his brothers I am Joseph does my father yet live is it really true that Dad is alive you're not just making this up this is the first time that Joseph refers to Jacob as his father and his Brethren could not answer him they were troubled at his presence no surprise there Reuben would be the most shocked if this was true this Egyptian fellow had just told them that he could Divine how could zap Naf panea know the name of the brother who was not they haven't said the name Joseph and how can Joseph convince them that this isn't some witchcraft or divination or other means that it's not some sort of an act Joseph said unto his Brethren come near to me I pray you I pray you the the Hebrew word is n it often means please in the case of a command or an imperative it softens it so he's not commanding them come here or else but he is insisting and they came near they're still troubled at his presence and he Saidi am Joseph your brother whom you sold into Egypt at this Reuben must have looked at his brothers and seen their guilt-filled countenances filled with fear if this guy really is Joseph and has the power he clearly has this might not be good news Joseph goes goes on to reassure them of his good intentions toward them now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that you sold me hither for God did send me before you to preserve life Joseph has understood his role for these two years hath the famine been in the land and yet there are five years in which which there shall neither be earring nor Harvest and God sent me before you he repeats this do you get this guys he repeats it it's God's doing to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great Deliverance they're still silent so now it was not you that sent me here but God this is the third time he's repeated this are you getting it guys and Heath made me a father to Pharaoh we talked about this in part four that senusret 2 who had the dreams died about the time the years of plenty ended and his son senusret three who had been tutored by Joseph for several years was now Pharaoh made me a father to pharaoh and Lord of all his house and and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt Hast she hurry up go up to my father and say unto him thus saith thy son Joseph God hath made me Lord of all Egypt come down unto me T not and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goan Joseph has carefully inspected the entire land during his tenure he knows the best areas in chapter 47 we'll see how he knew the land land would be available for his extended family to settle and thou shalt be near unto me thou and thy children and thy children's children and thy flocks and thy herds and all that thou Hast and there will I nourish thee again a model of Christ come down from heaven can't be bought the bread from Heaven can't be bought but will be a gift for there are yet yet five years of famine to come he repeats this prediction to emphasize it lest thou and thy household and all that thou Hast come to Poverty yeah I'm your brother but in this land I'm also your lord and I will save you in spite of your rejection of me and what I suffered at your hands a perfect parallel to Jesus and behold your eyes see and the eyes of my brother Benjamin that it's my mouth that speaketh unto you and I can see in your eyes you're starting to believe me and now he becomes assertive and ye shall tell my father of all my glory the honor the fame the Splendor in Egypt and of all that ye have seen and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither he's very very old get him down here quickly and he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck and wept and Benjamin wept on his neck moreover he kissed all his Brethren and wept upon them and after that his Brethren who had been dumb struck until now talked with him reminds me a little of Thomas after Jesus resurrection he needed serious convincing and the fame thereof not just Joseph is overcome and his weeping was heard in Pharaoh's house saying Joseph's Brethren are come and it pleased Pharaoh well and his servants and Pharaoh said unto Joseph after summoning him to the Palace say unto thy Brethren this do ye laid your beasts load your donkeys and go get you into the land of Canaan and take your father and your households from Canaan and come unto me and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt and you shall eat the fat of the land again parallels go ye into all the world preach the good news come unto me all ye that labor and heavy laid and I'll give you rest now Thou Art commanded this do ye take you King James says wagon a much better word is carts out of the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives not for your heavy stuff and bring your father and come and also regard not your stuff for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours Pharaoh seems awfully generous we'll get a strong hint about why at the end of chapter 47 not tonight and the children of Israel did so and Joseph gave them carts according to the Commandment of pharaoh and gave them provision for the way many use these verses and specifically the use of the word wagons to dispute the time of Joseph being during the 12th dynasty of the Middle Kingdom they point out that evidence of four-wheeled wagons didn't exist in Egypt until the late second intermediate period or early New Kingdom 1600s or 1500s BC two or 3 hundred years after the 12th Dynasty where we have placed Joseph this is the first record of Egypt having four- wheeled wagons in approximately the 1600s of BC during the 13th Dynasty more than 200 years after these carts are sent to Joseph's family in Hein the image is taken from a stone relief the wheels are tiny discs could even be small logs useless over rough desert Trails but as early as the fifth Dynasty around 400 years years prior to the setting of the story two wheeled scaling ladders were in use and a Siege Tower is Illustrated in a tomb of the 11th Dynasty about 150 years before the time of the 12th Dynasty both these images are from Stone reliefs noticed especially the fifth Dynasty scaling ladder has decent sides solid disc wheels and an axle the Hebrew word translated in the King James Bible as wagon and more accurately cared is agala in modern usage small hand trucks like one we might use to move an appliance are called aala agala is derive from a word that means revolving circular round the carts sent by phero and Joseph were most likely two wielded carts and were not for their goods but for their small children their wives for Jacob light loads hard to put on the back of a donkey and people incapable of walking the distances involved verse 17 showed us that heavy loads were carried directly by donkeys not loaded on carts or wagons we'll see the same in verse 23 now we have no illustrations carved in stone or examples from tombs of what such a cart might have been like remember nearly all the tombs of the Pharaohs and of the wealthy were robbed in Antiquity it's only in the later New Kingdom that there were extensive paintings inside tomb walls illustrating daily life the the wooden models I showed you pictures of uh last time surviving from Joseph times were Agriculture and food making and so it was so that the deceased could eat food in the afterlife they wouldn't starve and the models were apparently of little value to tomb Raiders finally remember that lack of direct evidence of the carts is not the same as evidence of a lack of carts moving on to all of them Joseph gave each man changes of rment why because they torn theirs when the cup was found in Benjamin's sack of grain but to Benjamin he gave 300 pieces of silver and five changes of rment and to his father he sent after this manner 10 asses Laden with the good things of Egypt and 10 she asses Laden with grain and bread and food for his father by the way again note the heavy those are born directly by the pack animals not loaded into carts or wagons further evidence that the wagons were two wheeled carts and not four or more wheeled Vehicles such carts could slowly Traverse unpaved paths in the Rocky desert Wilderness befitting events in Egyptian technology in the time of the 12th dynasty of the Middle Kingdom so Joseph sent his Brethren away and that he parted and he said unto them see that you fall not out by the way what does that mean don't fall off a cliff on a mountain trail don't stop at Disneyland of the sin go directly home don't dottle it's not what he's saying other translations read don't quarrel among yourselves while you're traveling the Hebrew word regaz translated Fallout means tremble Quake rage shake or quiver with violent emotion especially anger or fear today we might say road rage can you imagine Reuben's anger at having been told a lie all these years about Joseph's demise Reuben having unwittingly been pulled into the deception of Dipping Joseph's special coat in goat's blood to convince Jacob their father that Joseph had been killed what did Judah and the other brothers told Ruben when he came back and found the sister and empty and asked the child is not an eye whether shall I go I don't know bro hungry lion or a bear must have smelled him and heard him balling his eyes out and carried him off to devour that's why we're here protecting the flocks right but there's no blood in the sistern the animal didn't want to get trapped in there probably dragged him away to eat him in its den or feed its Cubs in one of the caves around here Joey might have found a way to try and climb out when he was taken who knows but he's obviously dead and good ridd right but now Ruben knows the truth straight from the mouth of Joseph oops or what about Benjamin all these years you've told me my brother Joseph was killed but you sold him into slavery what kind of brothers are you how could you do that that what kind of family is this and both Ruben and Benjamin first and last born accusing how could you do this to our father and all of them what are we going to do how are we going to tell Dad they know Joseph will tell Jacob all the details of his life since he left Hein for sheam those 23 years earlier the brothers have no choice but to finally tell Jacob the truth Judah so far at least is the only one we know that is demonstrated confession and repentance Simeon and Levi admitted killing the men of shakam but Justified their actions no sense of guilt or remorse or repentance and demonstrated want and cruelty hamst stringing the animals and Jacob's response to it how could you do this was you're putting us all in danger you're putting me in danger Jacob was a very self-focused individual and how will Jacob their dad react to having been deceived and not about a missing piece of pie or other triviality but about his favorite son and for 23 years I'll repeat one of our opening verses be not deceived God is Not mocked whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also reap I wonder if Paul was thinking about job when he wrote that even as I have seen they that plow iniquity and so wickedness reap the same Jacob's whole life has been one of practicing deception his sons have been good students a wakeup call for Jacob is coming on the road from Egypt to heon in the form of 11 shocked brothers and as they went up out of Egypt and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father I can imagine and it's just my imagination that Jacob saw them saw them arrive pale now shaking as they lock eyes and notice him looking their way and he happy that he plainly sees Simeon and Benjamin or part of the returning group could have said hey boys welcome home what happened down there in Egypt you all look like You' seen a ghost seriously now tell me all about it and they told him saying Joseph is yet alive and he is Governor over all the land of Egypt whatever the greetings this was the last thing Jacob would have ever expected them or anyone to say and Jacob's heart fainted for he believed them not of course he didn't how could he if Joseph were alive why hadn't he reached out to his family if he was as powerful as they asserted he could have easily done so why would he run away and hide for 13 years cut off all contact how had his special coat been left behind and covered in blood Jacob had mourned the loss of Joseph for years this can't be true but it was and they told him all the words of Joseph which he had said unto them in the course of these Revelations would have come the confession of the brothers selling Joseph and the cover up and when Jacob would have undoubtedly challenged them how could you do this they undoubtedly pointed out Jacob's duplicity all of his life Esau and the birthright deceiving Isaac for the blessing of the firstborn Rachel and Leia the spotted sheep at Uncle laan's dad your life has been one of continual deception and self-focus and you're upset with us for following your example you ignored us dad always put Joseph first we hated him and that hate came from your preferential treatment at our expense we just wanted some of that love and attention Dad we thought with Joseph out of the picture you'd finally see us but no you were more concerned about mourning what you'd lost than caring about what you still had maybe some of the air finally got cleared the brothers were reaping what they had sown and so was their dad Jacob and when Jacob saw the carts which Joseph had sent to carry him the spirit of Jacob their father revived he could see that the carts were Egyptian not Canaanite the people attending them were clearly Egyptian as well and Israel said it is enough Joseph my son is yet alive I'll go and see him before I die chapter 46 and Israel took his journey with all that he had and came to Beva and offered sacrifices unto the god of his father Isaac and God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night and said Jacob Jacob and he said here am I why biva why not Hein is it just because it's on the way if so why stop and offer sacrifices there let's unravel that mystery we're running out of time this evening why b sha it's next time and this part of the story of Joseph's life we find Joseph as a model of Christ revealing himself when he sees genuine repentance the musicians could kindly return and we see that those who were his enemies his brothers who hated him received Grace at his hand they didn't know who he was but he knew who they were and in this part I also see a life reflecting teachings that Jesus will speak some 2,000 years later he might have been thinking of the life of Joseph as he prepared to deliver his most notable sermon Matthew 5:44 I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you or Matthew 6 if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses or in Matthew 7 therefore all things whatsoever you would that men should do to you do so even to them even if they're your enemy for this is the law and the prophets Joseph is not only showing grace and mercy but loving kindness to his brothers let's worship together and celebrate our Lord's loving kindness to us all there's a song that's based on Psalm 63 let's all sing it together and you can sing it in the correct key I'll be struggling to find it here somewhere th thy loving kindness is better than life thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise the thus will I bless Thee I will lift up my hands unto thy name I lift my hands up unto thy name I lift my hands up unto thy name my lips shall praise thee thus will I bless Thee I will lift up my hands unto thy name thy loving kindness is better than life thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee the will I bless Thee I will lift up my hands unto thy name I lift my hands up unto thy name I lift my hands unto thy name my lips shall praise thee thus will I bless Thee I will lift up I lift my hands up unto thy name I lift my hands unto thy name my lips shall praise thus will I bless Thee I will lift up my hands unto thy name did you enjoy it as much as I did did you learn something I'm so [Music] blessed my brother Lyall is just a wonderful teacher and he's he's a wonderfully learned person someone that studies and takes these things in using the very native Lang or learning the very native language of Hebrew so that he can learn these things better and that he can present these things to us so that we might understand the word better one thing that I just have to share with the church and I don't want to try to add to brother Lyle's sermon and he said this believe he read this [Music] scripture Genesis 45:7 and God and this is Joseph speaking God sent me before you to preserve your posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great Deliverance so now it was not you that sent me hither but God and he made me a father to pharaoh and Lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land and brother ly said he your exact words where let me read your exact words he said [Music] it took so many notes brother I'm sorry but the L's words were Joseph understood his role I've heard brother brandom say that if the bride could just realize who she is can you imagine if we really understood who our father is and if we really understood Jesus Christ and we really understood what a son or a daughter of God is can you imagine the different lives that we would live can you imagine the blessings that we don't have because we really don't truly understand who we are Joseph understood who he was and not only did he save all of Egypt but he also saved Israel the sons of Israel later on 400 and something years later 440 years 430 years later a prophecy came forth about these same descendants of this same man Jacob and said oh Israel whatever blesses you will be blessed and whatever curses you will be cursed and we see that same today if we would just realize what God has promised us Jesus Christ himself said ask anything in my name and I will do it imagine if we really understood our role like this man Joseph understood his role well done brother L well done let's all stand and then we will sing there's coming a day when we realize when we do really realize who we are and for eternity we'll sing of the goodness of God there I'm going to do one song great all is well all is well we have heard the message the and all is there is a place of perfect rest behind the inner so rest little Bri rest for all is yes all is well all is well we have heard the message Shalom and all is well there is a place perfect rest behind the in so rest little bright for all if we truly know who we are as Joseph knew then how could we not saying all is well because all is well all is it may seem like things are hard it may seem seem like things are rough just like brother Daniel gave the testimony earlier that lady just needed a just a little bit and God provided and I really believe God provided for her because the true Son of God was praying for [Music] her okay I love you Lord for your mercy never fails
