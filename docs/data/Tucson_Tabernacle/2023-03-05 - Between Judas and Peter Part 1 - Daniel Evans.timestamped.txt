[23:58] in Tucson
[24:00] it's my first time to be
[24:04] in your land America
[24:06] America
[24:07] I come to the message at the age of 20.
[24:13] and the first book that I bumped myself
[24:16] into
[24:18] in the pastor's Library
[24:22] was the man the book
[24:26] that the father ministry here
[24:29] had written
[24:30] or he has written the acts of the
[24:32] prophet
[24:34] I read that book
[24:37] from Cava to Cava
[24:40] [Music]
[24:42] I have read the messages of the prophet
[24:46] and at times I feel touched I cry I whip
[24:49] I read that book
[24:52] and I wept
[24:53] and from then on
[24:56] I developed the
[25:02] [Music]
[25:09] I wanted to meet him
[25:13] I wanted to meet Pastor Green
[25:16] say Lord
[25:19] if I can meet this man
[25:25] [Music]
[25:27] I didn't know that one day I'll get to
[25:29] America
[25:30] [Music]
[25:33] I started following his testimones and
[25:35] his teachings
[25:38] and this opening came that I'm coming to
[25:41] the James show in Tucson
[25:46] I went to the Tabernacle I was alone
[25:50] and I was there for two hours
[25:54] and I prayed I said Lord
[25:58] if I go to Tucson
[26:00] [Music]
[26:01] I'll make Tucson Tabernacle my home
[26:04] Church
[26:07] I didn't know that
[26:09] brother Peterson
[26:12] would meet me
[26:14] welcoming
[26:16] and I didn't know that
[26:18] the man here
[26:21] is now the pastor of this church
[26:24] rather than
[26:26] has worked very closely with my pastor
[26:29] in the country
[26:31] when he was a voice of God our pastor
[26:35] has been the manager for several years
[26:40] he started that library in his house
[26:44] that's where when I started staying with
[26:47] him
[26:48] I was I could be in the library back the
[26:51] books
[26:52] and
[26:55] I told the Lord that when I go to Tucson
[26:59] I want to go to the Tabernacle before I
[27:01] go to sleep
[27:04] and that is exactly how the Lord made it
[27:06] with brother Peterson
[27:08] that I was brought here
[27:10] [Music]
[27:19] he brought me here
[27:21] and I had time to thank the Lord here
[27:25] I thank you pasta for receiving me
[27:29] [Music]
[27:33] I see so much love among you here
[27:37] [Music]
[27:39] I have found a family
[27:43] [Music]
[27:48] when brother Johnson was preaching
[27:53] that testimony
[27:55] the pastor gave here
[27:58] is not a small testimony
[28:01] I saw on a Sunday
[28:03] when he was looking at the quotation
[28:06] how he was troubled in the spirit I'm a
[28:09] minister
[28:09] and I sat there I just said Lord help
[28:12] the pastor
[28:15] I think he left this puppet with that
[28:17] heavy head nice on his art
[28:21] and brother Johnson
[28:23] he goes to pray he picks up everything
[28:27] that the pastor wanted to say
[28:30] just to come in
[28:33] to show that
[28:35] there is God
[28:38] unit of purpose in the church
[28:41] I appreciate of Who You Are
[28:44] I appreciate the elders brother Aaron
[28:49] and all the brothers here
[28:53] that since the going out of your pastor
[28:55] you have remained strong
[28:58] you have kept the faith
[29:00] you have allowed this atmosphere to
[29:03] continue in the church
[29:04] [Music]
[29:05] and I pray that God will bless our
[29:08] pastor
[29:10] and you give him strength
[29:12] my pastor called me
[29:15] after they spoke
[29:17] he called me and he has instructed me
[29:22] I know that man
[29:25] make him your pastor
[29:28] and stay under his ministry in Tucson
[29:33] so I wanted to say to the pastor and to
[29:36] the brothers
[29:38] all the years that God months weeks that
[29:42] you allow me to stay in your country
[29:45] Tucson Tabernacle share remain my home

[42:20] brother Ronnie kapisha he is a precious
[42:24] precious brother I think he's got at
[42:27] least one Church of at least a thousand
[42:29] people I'd say right
[42:30] and he's just always working for the
[42:33] Lord he's doing he's just he's a true
[42:35] man of God he's got a great character
[42:38] and
[42:40] you don't build character like brother
[42:42] Ronnie capisha has without trials
[42:45] without tribulations without Hard Times
[42:47] brother Ronnie's been through it and it
[42:49] is just uh it's good it was good to hear
[42:52] from Brother Ronnie and
[42:54] um like I said my mind's on him and he's
[42:57] just a tremendous brother has done just
[42:59] so much
[43:01] um so anyways uh Brother Sam Marriott's
[43:03] celebration of life will be here March

[43:07] um brother eleazer Castillo we had him

[43:12] have scheduled him to come in on Sunday
[43:14] March the 26th so I really think a lot
[43:18] of also brother Eliezer he's I believe
[43:21] he's a young young man filled with the

[43:24] old but wow is he is he something
[43:27] special
[43:29] um again I'll put that on the Tabernacle
[43:32] website
[43:33] and then for tonight uh
[43:36] for communion there's uh at least one
[43:40] that may not be able to be with us at
[43:42] sister Mercy she's in her 90s and she
[43:46] says she doesn't know if she can hold
[43:47] her balance and that she's going to try
[43:50] to get to service but if she can't get
[43:52] to service we're going to take communion
[43:54] there and sister Angela put you on the
[43:57] job maybe maybe someone else
[43:59] um
[44:00] but uh if you know anybody that's in the
[44:02] hospital or that that by no means can
[44:06] make it we want the people to come
[44:07] because this is where we should take
[44:09] communion but if you simply can't then
[44:12] we'll be taking that
[44:14] um
[44:15] the communion to the people
[44:17] sister Eva it's good to see you my
[44:19] sister God bless you welcome
[44:21] I am
[44:23] I was talking with uh brother Ed
[44:26] yesterday I think it was and
[44:29] he he walked in and he had he had a
[44:31] phone and he says here somebody wants to
[44:33] talk to you and he let me talk to
[44:35] brother Nathaniel his son and uh we just
[44:39] had the best conversation he shared some
[44:41] really really nice testimonies and then
[44:44] I guess they talked a little bit later
[44:46] and brother Ed shared a testimony with
[44:49] me that that brother Nate had he started
[44:53] a Bible study
[44:55] in uh in his prison
[44:57] and it started when I think it was just
[45:01] three or four people is that right
[45:03] brother is that what you said is
[45:06] yeah it was just a very small group and
[45:09] then it started growing
[45:11] and it started growing and brother Nate
[45:15] told me that they get now 40 or 50
[45:17] people
[45:18] in this Bible study but it's not just
[45:20] growing in the inmates it's growing
[45:23] brother Nate was telling me that the um
[45:26] the prison guards
[45:28] have heard about it and they're
[45:30] interested in starting to come
[45:33] and he was uh brother uh Ed was telling
[45:36] me that the chaplains everything things
[45:41] the the ministry was just kind of dead
[45:43] in the prison that they were at in the
[45:45] chaplains they weren't doing anything
[45:47] and and brother Nate got this it started
[45:50] to grow and it it started to spread and
[45:52] the chaplains took notice now there are
[45:54] different denominations
[45:57] and they took notice of how this Bible
[46:00] studying is just studying the Bible is
[46:03] not bringing in anything any outside
[46:04] doctrines or dogmas just concentrating
[46:07] on this holy book and
[46:12] they uh the chaplain said hey we want to
[46:15] get in on this too
[46:18] so they made the commitment now there's
[46:20] a Catholic and there was another one I
[46:22] forgot it was a Baptist or something but
[46:25] it's different denominations and they
[46:27] said we want to get in on this we see
[46:30] what you're doing we want to start just
[46:32] teaching this Bible too
[46:34] so they're starting now can you imagine
[46:37] a minister saying we just want to teach
[46:40] the Bible
[46:48] what were you teaching before
[46:51] there's nothing else to teach but this
[46:54] I I was uh
[46:56] I was blessed blessed to hear hear that
[46:58] testimony yesterday that's how revivals
[47:01] start
[47:02] is it just maybe it's a Bible study and
[47:05] it starts spreading it can start in a
[47:07] prison
[47:08] it can start in Kentucky
[47:10] it can start in Jeffersonville it can
[47:12] start in Tucson
[47:15] anywhere you can start anywhere wherever
[47:17] the Lord's Sovereign he can start it
[47:18] wherever he wants to with whoever he
[47:20] wants to
[47:21] he started a Revival with 12 of the most
[47:25] unqualified people that had probably
[47:28] ever preached the gospel two thousand
[47:31] years ago and we are still we are still
[47:35] reaping the benefits of that Revival
[47:37] here two thousand years later
[47:40] I was thinking
[47:42] on my heart and I was I was thinking
[47:43] about some of these testimonies over the
[47:46] past few days
[47:48] and I was thinking about two men
[47:53] Disciples of Jesus
[47:57] famous men we all know who they were
[48:00] both of them
[48:02] failed miserably in their lives
[48:07] failed had many many failures
[48:10] these two men
[48:13] are Peter
[48:16] and Judas is caring
[48:18] and I look at these two men these two
[48:21] Disciples of Jesus
[48:24] and as I was studying on their lives and
[48:27] on their Ministries I was wondering what
[48:30] separated
[48:32] what was the difference
[48:34] between these two men
[48:36] this man Peter who we Revere
[48:39] as high as anyone in the Bible aside
[48:43] from our Lord
[48:45] and then this man Judas who we do not
[48:50] see a lower form of life
[48:53] in the Bible than him
[48:56] yet both of them disciples
[49:00] both of them
[49:01] were in the boat
[49:03] when the when Jesus was sleeping under
[49:06] the hall and and those storms started
[49:09] raging and the boat started going back
[49:12] and forth and they went and they said
[49:14] Jesus we're gonna die
[49:17] Jesus gets up and stands on the bow of
[49:20] the boat and says peace be still
[49:24] and the winds and the wave caused both
[49:28] of these two men were there and they
[49:30] witnessed that
[49:32] and then when they get to the shore they
[49:34] they come they come to a man that that
[49:36] maybe what we would consider a homeless
[49:38] man today
[49:40] running around is naked yeah no clothes
[49:42] on completely out of his mind running
[49:45] through the tombs and and sleeping in
[49:47] the graveyards and we we would look at
[49:50] them today as somebody that we see it
[49:52] walking around up and down this Stone
[49:55] Avenue
[49:57] and Jesus comes
[50:00] and casts out
[50:03] demons from this man
[50:06] when asked his name he said
[50:09] We Are Legion for we are many
[50:11] maybe schizophrenic
[50:14] terrible
[50:15] terrible person
[50:18] Jesus is there and Jesus casts out these
[50:21] demons from this man so much such a
[50:25] strange thing that happened that the
[50:27] demons cried out to Jesus they said
[50:29] don't send us
[50:31] to the depths
[50:33] don't send us to hell
[50:35] these are demons afraid of going there
[50:39] how much more should we be of that place
[50:43] yet Jesus casts out these demons they
[50:46] come back and there there is this Legion
[50:48] in his right mind
[50:51] talking with the Lord saying Lord I want
[50:54] to follow you
[50:56] Jesus says no you stay here
[50:58] he had a work to do
[51:00] then Legion goes and he witnesses to all
[51:04] the people around in his town
[51:06] introducing them to the Lord
[51:10] and Judas and Peter were there
[51:15] so then they get back
[51:17] and they get word that there's a
[51:20] a a priest's daughter
[51:24] that was dying
[51:26] Lord would you come would you come pray
[51:29] for my daughter Jesus gets up and and
[51:32] the disciples go and all the people are
[51:34] going around and they're walking down
[51:36] and a little lady with the blood issue
[51:38] that was bleeding
[51:41] for many many years
[51:43] she touches the very Hem of His Garment
[51:46] she's made whole
[51:48] and Judas was there
[51:50] Peter was there
[51:51] and then they go and they receive word
[51:54] that this man Jairus that his daughter
[51:57] had died
[51:59] said don't come she's dead already
[52:02] Jesus
[52:04] I'm gonna go anyways
[52:06] so Jesus goes in him he goes in there
[52:09] Judas wasn't in the room
[52:11] but Jesus and Peter was there and John
[52:14] was there and James was there and they
[52:17] prayed for this dead girl
[52:19] and she rose from the dead
[52:22] and Peter was there and Judas also
[52:25] witnessed it he he wasn't in the room
[52:28] but he knew about these things how could
[52:31] we have two people that were so
[52:34] different
[52:36] come from the same place
[52:39] you know I look at
[52:41] I look at Divine Healing and I think
[52:43] about how important this Divine Healing
[52:46] is
[52:47] but
[52:48] they had the understanding that these
[52:52] Miracles that were happening
[52:54] Legion and and the storm and and
[52:57] jairus's daughter and these ones there
[53:00] the people are going to get sick again
[53:02] they're going to die again
[53:05] but they had the Revelation if we can
[53:07] just get people to Christ
[53:10] that their bodies May wither and die
[53:13] eventually
[53:14] but their souls will live forever in
[53:18] eternity
[53:19] they had this revelation of who this man
[53:22] was
[53:24] two men walking side by side
[53:28] and you go all the way back
[53:30] to Genesis
[53:33] we go back to the serpent
[53:35] and now in Genesis 3 it says I will put
[53:38] enmity
[53:40] between these speaking to The Serpent
[53:42] and the woman and between thy seed and
[53:44] her seed and it shall bruise thy head
[53:46] and thou shalt bruise his heel speaking
[53:49] of Jesus and Satan
[53:51] all through these ages and then Jesus
[53:55] comes and then these two men get to be
[53:57] in his ministry
[54:00] Jesus goes to the woman at the well
[54:04] sends the disciples off to give food and
[54:07] he's talking to this this lady
[54:11] who maybe he shouldn't have been talking
[54:13] to as a minister of the Gospel
[54:17] yet they're around this well and he's
[54:19] talking to her and and
[54:21] back and forth
[54:23] he tells her that she's a sinner
[54:26] he tells her what she's done wrong
[54:30] and he says he says I will she says the
[54:33] well is deep she says you don't have
[54:35] anything to draw with it
[54:37] to draw the water
[54:39] and he's Jesus says the water that I
[54:42] give him shall be in him a well of of
[54:45] Living Water springing up to everlasting
[54:48] life
[54:49] and she looks at him and she says
[54:53] forgive me this water that I thirst not
[55:00] that's what this ministry was about
[55:03] it wasn't about
[55:04] just being healed so that we can get
[55:07] sick again we thank God for that
[55:10] and thank God that we are healed but but
[55:13] this Divine Healing and these Miracles
[55:16] they point us to Christ
[55:19] they showed us that Jesus that God is
[55:22] alive
[55:23] that he dwelt on Earth that yes he heals
[55:26] our sin our sicknesses he's saying he he
[55:29] saves those laws he brings them in to
[55:32] the church and we receive everlasting
[55:35] life through him that we will never get
[55:37] sick again
[55:38] I see these two men
[55:41] this Peter
[55:43] and and Judas
[55:45] and as I was studying I was reading the
[55:48] Bible there's so much more negative
[55:51] written about Peter
[55:53] then there is Judas
[55:55] mistake after mistake that Peter made
[55:59] Judas we only see one mistake
[56:02] that he made
[56:04] both of them repented
[56:06] what was the difference
[56:08] between these two
[56:11] there was a very obvious difference
[56:14] between them
[56:15] let's turn
[56:20] to John chapter 12.
[56:28] Peter
[56:29] and Judas
[56:33] coming into this last supper
[56:37] that Jesus was going to have on the
[56:40] Passover
[56:41] they come in
[56:44] but something had happened
[56:49] just
[56:51] before
[56:52] this Passover
[56:54] and this man Jesus
[56:57] now
[56:59] there's two schools of thought on this
[57:01] it's written
[57:02] two different places in the Bible and
[57:04] I'm going to read both of them and it's
[57:06] written slightly different in either one
[57:09] there's there's some schools of thought
[57:12] that say it's the same woman that this
[57:14] happened to and there's other schools of
[57:16] thought that say that it was two
[57:18] different women
[57:20] and then there's other schools of
[57:22] thought that say oh well here's a
[57:23] mistake in the Bible because it's not
[57:25] consistent
[57:26] so I want to read both
[57:29] my
[57:31] thoughts are these are two two different
[57:33] occurrences that happened really close
[57:36] in time to each other
[57:39] John chapter 12 verse 1.
[57:43] then six days before the Passover
[57:48] came to Bethany where Lazarus was then
[57:51] Jesus six days before the Passover came
[57:52] to Bethany where Lazarus was which he
[57:55] had been dead
[57:56] which had been dead whom he raised from
[57:58] the dead
[58:00] there they made him a supper and Martha
[58:03] served but Lazarus was one of them that
[58:04] sat at the table with him
[58:06] then took Mary a pound of ointment of
[58:09] spikenard very costly and anointed the
[58:13] feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with
[58:15] her hair and the house was filled with
[58:17] the odor of the ointment
[58:19] then said one of his disciples judas's
[58:23] carrot Simon's son which should betray
[58:26] him why was not dis ointment sold for
[58:30] 300 Pence and given to the poor
[58:33] this he said now the author of this is
[58:37] John John knew Judas traveled with him
[58:41] slept probably slept in the same tent as
[58:43] he did
[58:44] was around him a lot
[58:46] this said this he said not that he cared
[58:50] for the poor
[58:51] but because he was a thief
[58:54] and had the bag
[58:55] and bear what was put therein
[58:59] another translation says this
[59:02] he said this not because he cared for
[59:04] the poor but because he was a thief and
[59:06] having charge of the money bag he used
[59:08] to help himself
[59:09] to what was put in it
[59:13] and John seems to know this Judas very
[59:15] well
[59:17] and uh
[59:19] you can see Judas he didn't like it
[59:24] what are you doing going and buying this
[59:28] you're a sinner woman anyways why are
[59:31] you even here with us
[59:32] going and buying this expensive ointment
[59:36] and taking it and wasting it
[59:40] on Jesus
[59:42] he could wash his feet and and doing
[59:45] what you're doing
[59:47] and wasting all that money
[59:50] it didn't make sense to Judas he didn't
[59:53] like it
[59:55] and something started to happen
[59:58] as far as I can read the scriptures it
[1:00:01] looks like right there
[1:00:03] something started to happen in Judas and
[1:00:05] he started to justify in his mind
[1:00:08] Maybe
[1:00:10] I can get what I want
[1:00:14] and I can do it at his expense
[1:00:17] next verse
[1:00:22] then said Jesus led her alone
[1:00:26] I love the way Jesus stuck up for this
[1:00:28] young sister he's he I don't care what
[1:00:31] she's done leave her alone
[1:00:33] she's one of mine
[1:00:36] and she has a revelation that you don't
[1:00:39] have Judas
[1:00:41] let her alone against the day of my
[1:00:43] burying has she kept this
[1:00:46] Jesus was prophesying of his death
[1:00:49] that would happen in just a couple days
[1:00:51] for the poor always you have with you
[1:00:54] but me you have not always
[1:00:57] now let's read that very similar story
[1:01:01] that takes place in Matthew chapter 26.
[1:01:10] well we can start with verse 1 again
[1:01:12] and it came to pass when Jesus had
[1:01:14] finished all these sayings he said unto
[1:01:16] his disciples you know
[1:01:18] that after two days is the Feast of the
[1:01:20] Passover and the son of man is betrayed
[1:01:22] to be is betrayed to be crucified
[1:01:25] then assembled together the chief
[1:01:27] priests and the scribes and the elders
[1:01:28] and the people under the Palace of the
[1:01:31] high priest who was called caiaphasis
[1:01:33] and consulted that they might take Jesus
[1:01:36] by subtlety and kill him
[1:01:39] but they said not on the feast day
[1:01:41] unless there being uproar among the
[1:01:42] people
[1:01:43] we're going to wait a day
[1:01:47] now when Jesus was in Bethany same place
[1:01:51] as he was just at
[1:01:52] when Jesus was in Bethany
[1:01:55] in the house of Simon the leper
[1:01:58] there came unto him a woman having an
[1:02:00] alabaster box a very precious ointment
[1:02:03] and poured it on his head as he sat at
[1:02:06] meat
[1:02:07] the previous account was washing his
[1:02:10] feet
[1:02:10] but when his disciples saw it they had
[1:02:12] indignation saying to what purpose is
[1:02:15] this waste
[1:02:17] because of the testimony of John
[1:02:21] I
[1:02:22] I really don't see how
[1:02:25] this could have been anyone else but
[1:02:27] Judas
[1:02:28] saying that
[1:02:30] and he may have been an influence
[1:02:31] started to influence the others
[1:02:37] for this ointment might have been sold
[1:02:39] for much and given to the poor
[1:02:41] when Jesus understood it he said unto
[1:02:44] them why trouble ye the woman for she
[1:02:47] hath wrought a good work upon me
[1:02:49] for ye have the poor always with you but
[1:02:52] me you have not always
[1:02:55] for in that she hath poured this
[1:02:57] ornament on my body she did it for my
[1:02:59] burial
[1:03:00] again prophesy of what was about to
[1:03:04] happen verily I say unto you where
[1:03:06] wheresoever this gospel shall be
[1:03:08] preached in all the world there shall
[1:03:10] also this that this woman hath done be
[1:03:14] told for a memorial to her this day this
[1:03:17] prophecy is fulfilled
[1:03:19] then one of the twelve called Jesus
[1:03:21] carrot went unto the chief priests and
[1:03:24] said unto them
[1:03:25] what will you give me
[1:03:28] and I what will you give me and I will
[1:03:30] deliver him unto you
[1:03:32] and they covenanted with him for 30
[1:03:35] pieces of silver
[1:03:36] and from that time
[1:03:39] he sought the opportunity to betray him
[1:03:45] while Judas saw he could get a benefit
[1:03:49] from this he was thinking of himself
[1:03:52] first
[1:03:54] and how many times do we see people
[1:03:57] joining a church or or going or
[1:04:00] switching from this church to that
[1:04:02] church or going into the ministry or
[1:04:05] whatever it might be so that they can
[1:04:08] get a benefit from it
[1:04:12] might be about money it might be about
[1:04:14] popularity whatever it might be but how
[1:04:18] often do we see people
[1:04:21] going for a purpose to serve themselves
[1:04:25] rather than to serve others and that's
[1:04:28] what judas's Focus was
[1:04:30] Judas was was premeditated in what he
[1:04:34] did
[1:04:35] he had fought all of this out
[1:04:38] time had passed by and he was working
[1:04:42] towards he wanted this money
[1:04:46] and he was going to do anything to get
[1:04:49] it
[1:04:50] there was a
[1:04:51] a friend of mine
[1:04:53] lives in the Bahamas brother Jordan
[1:04:55] knows him
[1:04:57] he calls people on the phone a lot and
[1:05:00] preaches to them whoever number he can
[1:05:02] get
[1:05:03] um
[1:05:04] aggravated me a few times but he's uh
[1:05:09] he's been successful in what he's done
[1:05:12] well he got the phone number of this
[1:05:15] famous evangelist
[1:05:16] I won't name the evangelist's name but
[1:05:18] this is a I don't know eight to ten
[1:05:21] years ago
[1:05:23] he got the name of this famous
[1:05:24] evangelist and he and the phone number
[1:05:26] and he calls him up
[1:05:29] and this man
[1:05:31] says says yeah you know this is so and
[1:05:34] so
[1:05:34] and he says listen he says you're going
[1:05:37] You're not preaching the gospel
[1:05:39] he says you're preaching for money
[1:05:43] he said the only thing you're doing is
[1:05:45] you're pulling on the people you want to
[1:05:47] pad your pocketbooks and you're
[1:05:49] preaching down a watered-down gospel
[1:05:52] and not correcting the people in their
[1:05:55] sins
[1:05:57] just because you're a good singer you're
[1:05:59] a good preacher and you can get a
[1:06:01] following but you're not providing
[1:06:02] correction to the people
[1:06:04] you know what he told them he says if I
[1:06:07] preach what you're saying
[1:06:09] he said I'd lose my Ministry
[1:06:13] that man got on an airplane and it
[1:06:16] crashed and he died that same day
[1:06:21] voila what a thing
[1:06:23] famous man
[1:06:26] he was given the opportunity
[1:06:29] I'm not calling this man as I said I
[1:06:31] don't know I don't know this man I'm not
[1:06:34] judging him
[1:06:35] I'm just going by what the story that
[1:06:38] this brother told me
[1:06:43] no matter how many people are in this
[1:06:45] church
[1:06:46] no matter how many people that we're
[1:06:49] preaching to no matter how many people
[1:06:51] you are ministering to or whatever never
[1:06:53] we could never compromise
[1:06:56] we can never compromise in the world for
[1:06:59] the world and just water it down because
[1:07:01] we're afraid people won't be here
[1:07:04] we can't
[1:07:05] it won't be successful
[1:07:10] hey uh
[1:07:13] I'm gonna skip down here let's uh let's
[1:07:15] go to verse 17.
[1:07:27] before we get there Paul said
[1:07:30] the Apostle Paul said he says I know how
[1:07:32] to be poor
[1:07:35] I know how to be rich
[1:07:37] he says he says I I know how it is he
[1:07:40] says I know how to is to be a beast I
[1:07:42] know how it is to abound
[1:07:45] he says every word in all things I am
[1:07:47] instructed both to be full and to be
[1:07:49] hungry both to abound and to suffer need
[1:07:52] it doesn't matter where we are as long
[1:07:55] as we're in Christ and then he says I
[1:07:57] can do all things through Christ which
[1:07:59] strengtheneth me
[1:08:03] let's skip to verse 20.
[1:08:06] now when the evening was come he sat
[1:08:09] down with the twelve and they did eat he
[1:08:11] said verily I say unto you that one of
[1:08:13] you shall betray me
[1:08:15] and they were exceeding sorrowful
[1:08:18] and began every one of them to say to
[1:08:20] him Lord is it I
[1:08:23] look at a Christian
[1:08:26] they're not pointing the fingers at each
[1:08:28] other
[1:08:30] they're afraid Lord is this me
[1:08:33] am I the one that is sinning
[1:08:36] am I the hindrance
[1:08:39] and he answered and said he that deepeth
[1:08:43] his hand with me in the dish the same
[1:08:45] shall betray me
[1:08:47] the son of man goeth as it is written of
[1:08:49] him but woe unto that man by whom the
[1:08:53] son of man is betrayed
[1:08:55] these things are going to happen
[1:08:57] these things are prophecy he was going
[1:09:00] to go to the Cross but woe unto that man
[1:09:03] by whom
[1:09:04] he went to the cross
[1:09:07] then Judas which betrayed him answered
[1:09:09] and said master
[1:09:11] is it I
[1:09:15] want a foolish question I don't know why
[1:09:16] I asked that
[1:09:19] he said unto him thou has said
[1:09:22] right there
[1:09:24] right there Judas should have repented
[1:09:29] he had an opportunity
[1:09:31] Lord I'm sorry I did this I went to
[1:09:34] these priests we said this I'm sorry
[1:09:37] forgive me
[1:09:39] and he would probably be in glory today
[1:09:42] but he was born for this
[1:09:44] and he's he went on with his
[1:09:47] premeditated plan
[1:09:50] let's go to John
[1:09:52] chapter 13. now we're getting to the
[1:09:54] last supper here and this is this is
[1:09:56] John's take on this
[1:09:59] and they're going into feet washing
[1:10:02] Let's uh let's skip down
[1:10:07] brother to verse 18.
[1:10:14] okay we'll start at 16. that's good
[1:10:16] um barely I say unto you the servant is
[1:10:19] not greater than his Lord neither that
[1:10:21] is sent greater than he that sent him
[1:10:24] for ye know these things for if you know
[1:10:27] these things happy are you if you do
[1:10:29] them
[1:10:30] I speak not of you all
[1:10:33] I know know whom I have chosen but that
[1:10:36] the scripture may be fulfilled he that
[1:10:38] eateth bread with me hath lifted up his
[1:10:40] heel against me
[1:10:41] now I tell you before it come that when
[1:10:45] it has come to pass you may believe that
[1:10:48] I am he
[1:10:49] verily verily I say unto you he that
[1:10:51] receiveth whomsoever I sendeth receiveth
[1:10:54] me
[1:10:56] and he that receiveth
[1:10:58] me receiveth him that sent me
[1:11:03] now right here we should be so careful
[1:11:06] be so careful in saying something
[1:11:09] against one another
[1:11:14] Judas
[1:11:15] he was aggressive he was attacking he
[1:11:19] was the one that was condemning he was
[1:11:22] the one that sought
[1:11:24] to betray Jesus he sought to do it
[1:11:30] when Jesus had thus said he was troubled
[1:11:33] in the spirit and testified and said
[1:11:35] verily verily I say unto you that one of
[1:11:37] you shall betray me
[1:11:41] then the disciples looked one on another
[1:11:43] doubting of whom he spake now there was
[1:11:46] leaning on Jesus's bosom one of his
[1:11:48] disciples whom Jesus loved Simon Peter
[1:11:51] therefore beckoned to him that he should
[1:11:54] ask who it should be of whom he spake
[1:11:57] Peter and John they're friends
[1:11:59] John obviously had a special
[1:12:01] relationship with Jesus they were close
[1:12:03] and he said ask him
[1:12:06] then lying on Jesus then he he that he
[1:12:09] then lying on Jesus's breast said unto
[1:12:12] him Lord who is it
[1:12:13] Jesus answered
[1:12:15] he it is to whom I shall give sop a sop
[1:12:19] when I have dipped it and when he had
[1:12:22] dipped the SOP he gave it to Judas
[1:12:24] Iscariot the son of Simon
[1:12:27] and after the sub Satan entered into him
[1:12:32] then said Jesus unto him thou doest do
[1:12:36] quickly
[1:12:37] right here again Judas has the
[1:12:40] opportunity to repent
[1:12:43] he has the opportunity to stop to not go
[1:12:47] through with this
[1:12:49] he had to know he was doing wrong
[1:12:53] but Satan had a willing vessel
[1:12:58] to enter into and that's this Judas
[1:13:01] Judas sought the money Satan had a
[1:13:04] willing vessel to come into and he comes
[1:13:07] in
[1:13:09] as I said he was born for that purpose
[1:13:12] he was born the Son of Perdition the son
[1:13:14] of Destruction
[1:13:16] to me this is the saddest story in the
[1:13:19] whole book
[1:13:20] is this story of Judas
[1:13:25] no now no man at the table knew for what
[1:13:29] intent he spake this unto him
[1:13:36] they didn't
[1:13:37] we would think that we would pick if we
[1:13:39] were one of the 12 we'd oh it's Judas
[1:13:41] they had no idea
[1:13:43] they're all wondering if it was me Lord
[1:13:46] am I the one that's going to do this for
[1:13:49] some of them thought because Judas had
[1:13:50] the bag that Jesus
[1:13:53] had said unto him by those things which
[1:13:55] we have need against the feast or that
[1:13:58] he should give something to the poor he
[1:14:00] then having received the SOP went
[1:14:03] immediately out and it was night
[1:14:05] his decision was made
[1:14:09] right to the priests he went
[1:14:13] therefore when he was gone out Jesus
[1:14:15] said now is the son of man glorified
[1:14:21] in him and God glorified in him
[1:14:27] so
[1:14:29] Judas leaves
[1:14:32] Jesus gets down and
[1:14:35] and he's he's washing the feet of the
[1:14:39] disciples
[1:14:41] and he's he's talking to them and and
[1:14:44] they're fellowshipping around the table
[1:14:47] and um
[1:14:49] let's go to verse 32.
[1:14:56] I'm sorry let's go to Matthew let's go
[1:14:58] to Matthew 26 32 I'm sorry brother
[1:15:03] there we go
[1:15:05] but after I am risen again I will go
[1:15:07] before you into Galilee Peter answered
[1:15:10] and said unto him though all men shall
[1:15:12] be offended because of thee yet I will
[1:15:15] never be offended
[1:15:18] the modern translation says though all
[1:15:20] men shall fall away because of you I
[1:15:22] will never fall away look at Peter's
[1:15:24] heart
[1:15:25] Lord I want to serve you I want to do
[1:15:26] right
[1:15:28] I'll never betray you I'll never make a
[1:15:31] mistake I'll never do something wrong
[1:15:32] Jesus said in him verily I say unto you
[1:15:34] that this night before the Crow
[1:15:37] Thou shalt deny me three times
[1:15:41] Peter said unto him though I should die
[1:15:44] with ye
[1:15:46] yet will I not deny thee likewise said
[1:15:49] all of the disciples how could I fall
[1:15:52] into sin
[1:15:54] how could how could I Lord how could I
[1:15:57] deny you there is no way
[1:16:01] so then
[1:16:02] as time goes on
[1:16:05] they go down to the Garden of the
[1:16:07] Gethsemane Jesus said will you stay here
[1:16:10] I need to go pray these are hard times
[1:16:13] Peter says yeah the same one I'll never
[1:16:15] deny you
[1:16:16] can you stay up can you watch Peter says
[1:16:20] sure
[1:16:21] he's sitting there and and Jesus is over
[1:16:23] praying and Peter
[1:16:26] he falls asleep
[1:16:27] again he betrays Jesus Jesus said don't
[1:16:30] fall asleep he comes he says Peter oh
[1:16:33] sorry
[1:16:34] I fell asleep
[1:16:37] Jesus goes back to pray again he does it
[1:16:39] again falls asleep
[1:16:41] Jesus comes back he goes back finally
[1:16:44] comes he says
[1:16:45] it's time it's over
[1:16:48] so here it comes
[1:16:50] the Judas and his crew
[1:16:55] they come in with with pit with with the
[1:16:58] Torches and that and Judas walks up to
[1:17:01] the Lord Jesus remember this is the one
[1:17:04] that was in the boat with him when he
[1:17:05] casted away the storm and he kisses him
[1:17:08] on the cheek and they knew from that
[1:17:10] kiss that this was Jesus
[1:17:14] he says you betrayed me with a kiss my
[1:17:16] friend
[1:17:18] Jesus called him his friend
[1:17:20] and there's Peter
[1:17:22] Peter pulls out a sword takes a hack at
[1:17:24] the guy's head
[1:17:26] fortunately he ducked I guess
[1:17:28] and and slices the ear off
[1:17:32] Jesus said Peter what are you doing
[1:17:36] did you not listen to anything that I
[1:17:38] said
[1:17:40] I did I not tell you if somebody Smite
[1:17:42] you on this cheek turn let them hit you
[1:17:43] on the other one
[1:17:45] and you're doing this
[1:17:48] come on Peter
[1:17:50] then all the disciples Peter included
[1:17:54] they get scared they run away
[1:18:01] and he says he tells Peter he says don't
[1:18:04] you know Peter
[1:18:05] I could ask the father he could send 12
[1:18:08] Legions of angels you think I'm that
[1:18:10] weak
[1:18:11] Peter
[1:18:12] come on
[1:18:14] Peter gets afraid and all the other ones
[1:18:17] and they they leave Jesus let's skip to
[1:18:19] verse 69.
[1:18:24] so Peter he's following
[1:18:27] Jesus they they take him and he's scared
[1:18:30] and he's following Jesus far off and
[1:18:32] he's watching where he's going
[1:18:36] and he's watching all of this that's
[1:18:38] happening with Peter and then with Jesus
[1:18:40] and then he finds himself outside the
[1:18:43] palace
[1:18:45] and a damself comes to him saying
[1:18:48] you're with Jesus in Galilee and he
[1:18:50] denied them
[1:18:52] said no I wasn't
[1:18:56] verse 20 verse 71 it says and when he
[1:18:59] was gone out in the porch another made
[1:19:01] Psalm and said unto unto him unto them
[1:19:03] that were there this fellow also with
[1:19:05] was Jesus of Nazareth and again he
[1:19:08] denied with an oath I don't know the man
[1:19:12] I don't know that guy
[1:19:15] this is the one
[1:19:17] that healed his mother-in-law that he
[1:19:19] saw it this is the one he was there when
[1:19:21] Jairus daughter was raised up from the
[1:19:23] dead
[1:19:24] Peter was there when Legion when the
[1:19:27] demons were cast out of Legion this is
[1:19:29] the one that said Thou Art the Christ
[1:19:31] the son of the Living God
[1:19:34] I don't even know him
[1:19:36] wow look at the failure
[1:19:39] from Peter
[1:19:44] verse 73
[1:19:46] and after a while
[1:19:48] came they unto him that stood by and
[1:19:51] said to Peter surely Thou Art also one
[1:19:54] of them Thou Art Thou also are one of
[1:19:57] them for thy speech be right thee
[1:20:00] then began he to curse and to swear
[1:20:04] saying I know not the man
[1:20:07] and immediately
[1:20:09] the crew
[1:20:12] just exactly what Jesus said that you're
[1:20:15] going to deny me three times before this
[1:20:18] rooster crows
[1:20:21] and I look at
[1:20:23] Peter
[1:20:25] and how he felt there and how a true
[1:20:30] Christian feels Peter was a true
[1:20:33] Christian
[1:20:34] and how that that it's it's like oh no I
[1:20:40] did it I did it again
[1:20:42] and how many of us how many of us lose
[1:20:44] our temper
[1:20:46] say something we shouldn't
[1:20:48] to our children to our parents to our
[1:20:50] husbands or our wives
[1:20:52] how many of us make mistakes and do
[1:20:55] things wrong
[1:20:56] just like Peter did
[1:20:59] we're guilty
[1:21:02] I was just
[1:21:03] just
[1:21:05] Friday
[1:21:07] it's with my wife she's thinking
[1:21:10] Dan don't do it don't tell them
[1:21:15] I think I I
[1:21:17] maybe my role is to make all the
[1:21:19] mistakes
[1:21:21] so then you can say I don't want to be
[1:21:23] like that guy up in the pulpit
[1:21:26] I'm gonna get fired
[1:21:30] we're
[1:21:31] Steph and I were driving
[1:21:33] and we pulled in
[1:21:35] to this parking lot
[1:21:38] and this homeless guy on a bike
[1:21:41] was right in front of me
[1:21:46] and I'm going to go around him and then
[1:21:49] he takes the left right in front of me
[1:21:51] and I hit the brakes
[1:21:53] and what did I do Peter
[1:21:59] I honked the horn
[1:22:02] and that guy he turned around he had a
[1:22:05] pile of Coke in his hand and he chucked
[1:22:08] it at the car
[1:22:10] I hit the brakes and I jumped out and he
[1:22:13] wisely took off as fast as he could on
[1:22:16] his bike away
[1:22:20] I got back in the car
[1:22:24] Lord
[1:22:26] I just caused that man to sin
[1:22:30] I did I didn't have to blow the horn
[1:22:34] but I caused him to sit I'm the one that
[1:22:37] did it
[1:22:38] and Stephanie kind of piled it on me she
[1:22:40] said yeah he probably needed those
[1:22:41] calories in that coke
[1:22:45] oh honey
[1:22:48] I felt so bad
[1:22:51] I did it I messed up
[1:22:54] I failed I sinned and I caused that poor
[1:22:57] man to sin
[1:22:59] I was I was upset and we went in the
[1:23:02] store and I was like I just can't handle
[1:23:04] it I was I I was feeling bad about
[1:23:07] myself and I was looking for the guy to
[1:23:09] try to find him you know Stephanie's
[1:23:11] with me I couldn't go into the homeless
[1:23:12] people and and ask but I wanted to get
[1:23:16] to him I want to say I'm sorry man
[1:23:18] forgive me
[1:23:20] I shouldn't have done that
[1:23:22] so I know how Peter felt
[1:23:26] we get we walk up to the car we were in
[1:23:28] the store we walk up the car and the
[1:23:29] tire's flat
[1:23:32] I was like
[1:23:34] Lord I'm sorry
[1:23:37] I hope that that's my punishment
[1:23:41] because I repent
[1:23:43] so we're able to limp to the to the gas
[1:23:45] station and and and and air up the tire
[1:23:48] and
[1:23:49] I said honey let's just pray Lord I'm
[1:23:53] sorry I'm sorry for making that man sin
[1:23:56] I'm sorry for for doing what I what I
[1:23:59] did Lord would you have mercy on him
[1:24:03] would you would you give this man
[1:24:05] eternal life
[1:24:06] that
[1:24:08] mean guy that honked at him
[1:24:11] I I just it just broke my heart but I
[1:24:14] can relate to Peter I did wrong
[1:24:18] and I repented
[1:24:21] and I I look at Judas
[1:24:24] Judas made that decision consciously
[1:24:30] premeditated
[1:24:32] for his own gain
[1:24:34] Peter when he denied the Lord he was
[1:24:37] afraid
[1:24:39] he messed up
[1:24:41] and he repented the very next verse I
[1:24:43] think it is
[1:24:45] um what's the next verse my brother I
[1:24:48] think it's is 75
[1:24:50] yeah right there and Peter remembered
[1:24:52] the word of Jesus which he said unto him
[1:24:54] before the Crow Thou shalt deny me
[1:24:56] Thrice and he went out and wept bitterly
[1:25:02] there's a son of God
[1:25:04] there is that Seed of Abraham there is
[1:25:08] that man
[1:25:09] I'm sorry Lord
[1:25:12] I messed up
[1:25:15] and then Judas
[1:25:17] goes and
[1:25:26] let's read it I think I think it's just
[1:25:29] I think it's just good to read Matthew
[1:25:31] 27
[1:25:33] we'll start with verse 3.
[1:25:35] and Judas which had betrayed him
[1:25:38] when he saw that he was condemned
[1:25:39] speaking of Jesus
[1:25:42] he repented
[1:25:45] and brought again the 30 pieces of
[1:25:47] silver to the pre to the chief priests
[1:25:50] and Elders Judas now
[1:25:53] he is repenting
[1:25:56] he said I have done this wrong
[1:26:01] and you we look at that Spirit Satan had
[1:26:04] entered Judas it was already done
[1:26:07] Jesus was already condemned he already
[1:26:09] did his job
[1:26:10] he takes the bottle the bag of money and
[1:26:13] he throws it down and he he goes out to
[1:26:16] the field
[1:26:18] sets up a noose and hangs himself
[1:26:22] I was I was reading that last night I
[1:26:24] was thinking Lord
[1:26:25] he repented but I thought I wonder if
[1:26:31] if he would have said Lord
[1:26:35] I was wrong
[1:26:37] I'm going to serve that man until the
[1:26:40] day I die
[1:26:43] but no he took the easy way out he goes
[1:26:45] out and he hangs himself you know what
[1:26:46] Satan had entered him Satan was like
[1:26:48] yeah I'm finished with you now I'm done
[1:26:51] with you
[1:26:53] and even Satan forsook him
[1:26:56] and said I'm finished hang yourself
[1:27:00] remember that's Satan's ultimate goal is
[1:27:03] to take our lives
[1:27:06] and he was so upset so sad
[1:27:09] and here he goes
[1:27:12] betrayed the Lord
[1:27:14] and goes and takes the easy way out and
[1:27:17] hangs himself I think brother Branham
[1:27:19] said one time that's the one thing I
[1:27:20] respect him for
[1:27:22] but I I think about that man I think
[1:27:24] about what if
[1:27:26] what if
[1:27:27] he would have followed through with his
[1:27:29] repentance
[1:27:30] and given his life to the Lord as Paul
[1:27:34] did
[1:27:36] Paul said I was wrong he said Lord who
[1:27:38] are you he said I'm Jesus whom you
[1:27:42] persecute
[1:27:43] Paul repented Paul gave his heart to the
[1:27:46] Lord Jesus and look what he did
[1:27:49] Paul was guilty of murdering Christians
[1:27:53] but there's this premeditated Judas and
[1:27:56] he's he's out there and he is looking
[1:27:58] for something to criticize
[1:28:02] that's the spirit of Jesus Peter just
[1:28:05] made a mistake
[1:28:06] but Judas he wanted something and now
[1:28:10] and we see all of the criticism
[1:28:15] of not only
[1:28:17] brother Branham
[1:28:19] we see criticism of ourselves
[1:28:22] we see criticism of this Bible and
[1:28:26] they're going and they're they're going
[1:28:28] and they're finding things like the
[1:28:30] story of Mary and the the two women that
[1:28:33] anointed Jesus look how different they
[1:28:34] are it must be false
[1:28:37] but look at their motives they're
[1:28:39] looking at it to find faults they want
[1:28:44] it and they same thing they go into the
[1:28:46] message that we believe and they're
[1:28:48] looking to try to find fault that is the
[1:28:50] spirit of Judas
[1:28:52] when you go into a church or you go in
[1:28:55] to wherever you go and you're looking
[1:28:58] for fault
[1:28:59] what spirit is that do you think that's
[1:29:01] the spirit of Christ
[1:29:03] that is not the spirit of Christ
[1:29:05] that's the spirit of this one here that
[1:29:08] hung himself
[1:29:10] the spirit of Peter
[1:29:13] was a Christian
[1:29:16] the spirit of Peter was Lord I'm sorry I
[1:29:19] keep messing up I keep doing the same
[1:29:20] thing wrong I'm going to get better I'm
[1:29:22] going to get better and then we look
[1:29:23] even later after Peter had received the
[1:29:25] Holy Spirit
[1:29:27] we see Peter and Paul come together I
[1:29:29] believe is it Antioch
[1:29:31] Peter's there and he's sitting with Paul
[1:29:33] and he's and they're all these Gentiles
[1:29:35] and they're eating and they all receive
[1:29:37] the Lord Jesus and they're so happy then
[1:29:39] two men came from Jerusalem
[1:29:42] down to this Antioch
[1:29:46] the
[1:29:49] the Jews
[1:29:51] they come down there
[1:29:53] first day then the next day Peter's like
[1:29:56] I'm not going to eat with gentiles
[1:29:58] I'm not going to do that
[1:30:01] because the Bible said he was afraid
[1:30:05] it was a weakness in Peter
[1:30:08] and so often we keep making mistakes
[1:30:10] over and over and over Lord why do I do
[1:30:13] it why do I do it because it's a
[1:30:15] weakness
[1:30:17] he forgives us for that
[1:30:20] but when there is a premeditated
[1:30:24] effort to take someone down
[1:30:28] when you go to church or when you are
[1:30:31] looking at people and you are looking
[1:30:33] for things to criticize in their lives
[1:30:36] that's not Peter making mistakes
[1:30:38] that's the spirit of Judas over here
[1:30:42] that is what will get us in trouble
[1:30:45] and it got Judas in trouble until
[1:30:49] he killed himself
[1:30:51] and then Peter
[1:30:54] I got to read this this other one
[1:30:57] I'll be fast Matthew chapter 16
[1:31:01] verse 21.
[1:31:04] look at this rebuke from the Lord Jesus
[1:31:08] upon Peter
[1:31:11] Matthew 16 21 from that time forth began
[1:31:16] Jesus to show unto his disciples how
[1:31:18] that he must go into Jerusalem and
[1:31:21] suffer many things of the elders and the
[1:31:23] chief chief priests and scribes and be
[1:31:25] killed and be raised again on the third
[1:31:27] day
[1:31:28] then Peter took him and began to rebuke
[1:31:31] him saying be it far from thee Lord this
[1:31:34] shall not be done unto thee
[1:31:36] but he turned and he said unto the unto
[1:31:39] Peter get thee behind me Satan
[1:31:43] he said it to Peter
[1:31:47] get thee behind me Satan
[1:31:50] Thou Art an offense unto me
[1:31:53] wow
[1:31:55] how did how did Peter feel
[1:31:58] for thou savior is not the things of God
[1:32:01] but the things that be of men
[1:32:04] look at the rebuke there
[1:32:08] I could find two places brother Jonathan
[1:32:12] that the Lord said get thee behind me
[1:32:15] Satan
[1:32:17] one time
[1:32:18] was when he was tempted in the
[1:32:19] wilderness and it was to Satan and the
[1:32:22] other time was to his
[1:32:24] Guy Peter
[1:32:27] wow
[1:32:28] can you imagine how bad Peter felt
[1:32:32] and how bad that we feel
[1:32:36] look at me that poor guy on the bicycle
[1:32:39] boy I Repent about that I feel so bad
[1:32:43] and I go before the Lord Lord I'm sorry
[1:32:45] I did it again
[1:32:47] and Peter I can see him saying Lord I
[1:32:50] did it again
[1:32:51] I keep doing it over and over again
[1:32:56] but then
[1:32:58] later on
[1:33:01] they had gone through the last supper
[1:33:03] and the musicians can come I'm closing
[1:33:05] they they went to the Last Supper
[1:33:10] Jesus
[1:33:12] serve the communion
[1:33:15] wash the feet
[1:33:19] they went down
[1:33:20] Peter
[1:33:22] Garden of Gethsemane Peter messed up
[1:33:25] fell asleep ran away forsook him three
[1:33:29] times
[1:33:30] and
[1:33:31] all that Peter did
[1:33:36] Jesus dies
[1:33:39] and he's Resurrected
[1:33:41] and Jesus comes
[1:33:44] back to the disciples
[1:33:48] and he's he's talking to them and
[1:33:51] imagine how they felt
[1:33:53] imagine how they felt on that Easter
[1:33:55] morning
[1:33:56] when it's they were so afraid and they
[1:33:59] were so condemned and all that they had
[1:34:00] done bad and here he is
[1:34:03] here I am
[1:34:06] and oh God
[1:34:08] oh thank you
[1:34:11] and Jesus
[1:34:13] pulls Peter off to the side
[1:34:16] oh I love this I love this so much
[1:34:22] Jesus pulls him off to to the side
[1:34:26] and he says
[1:34:28] he says Peter
[1:34:29] he says do you love me
[1:34:35] Peter from Obama's art
[1:34:37] said bless the Lord I love you
[1:34:41] and he said feed my sheep
[1:34:44] how wonderful
[1:34:47] Lord Peter with all of your faults and
[1:34:50] though you kept forsaking me
[1:34:53] you kept making mistakes you kept doing
[1:34:55] things wrong
[1:34:57] Peter
[1:34:59] feed my Lambs
[1:35:02] do you love me yes Lord
[1:35:06] three times
[1:35:07] do you love me Peter
[1:35:09] yes feed my sheep
[1:35:13] and there we see the difference
[1:35:18] between the son of Destruction and Judas
[1:35:22] and a son of God
[1:35:24] in Peter
[1:35:26] there was Godly repentance in Peter
[1:35:30] Peter's mistakes were not to serve
[1:35:33] himself
[1:35:35] Peter was not going to go after someone
[1:35:37] and tear them down
[1:35:39] so that he could be exalted
[1:35:42] so that he could have more money
[1:35:45] that was not Peter
[1:35:47] that's not us I pray it's not us
[1:35:51] [Music]
[1:35:52] there are judas's
[1:35:55] everywhere that same Spirit
[1:35:58] but then there's the same spirit that
[1:36:02] was in Peter also
[1:36:05] both of them
[1:36:06] made horrible mistakes
[1:36:09] over and over mistakes Peter made
[1:36:12] but yet at the end
[1:36:15] the Lord
[1:36:19] yeah
[1:36:22] do you love me
[1:36:23] we have it
[1:36:26] I was standing there and I saw this big
[1:36:28] tractor trailer come in and take out
[1:36:31] this tree and I watched and I laughed
[1:36:35] Lord I messed up right there
[1:36:39] says
[1:36:40] I know he said feed my sheep
[1:36:43] the Lord I was driving and I honked at
[1:36:46] this poor guy and I caused him to say he
[1:36:48] threw his Coke at me and I got mad I
[1:36:51] know
[1:36:52] feed my Lambs
[1:36:55] but Lord I got mad at my my husband or
[1:36:58] my my wife and and we were fighting and
[1:37:01] and I didn't and I just I did so wrong I
[1:37:04] know
[1:37:05] feed my sheep
[1:37:08] serve me
[1:37:10] serve each other
[1:37:11] [Music]
[1:37:13] love the Lord
[1:37:15] don't be a Judas
[1:37:18] that we come and we're looking
[1:37:21] for something
[1:37:23] and we want to talk about them
[1:37:26] we want to tear that person down because
[1:37:29] somehow it makes myself feel better
[1:37:32] that's Judas
[1:37:34] that's the serpent
[1:37:37] all the way to Cain look at all the way
[1:37:39] back Cain saw Abel
[1:37:42] and how God accepted that sacrifice and
[1:37:45] he was jealous
[1:37:47] The Same Spirit that Judas had on him he
[1:37:50] was jealous and he destroyed his brother
[1:37:53] [Music]
[1:37:54] that's the spirit of Judas
[1:37:58] but the spirit of God
[1:38:01] Jesus for so
[1:38:03] Peter forsook Jesus
[1:38:06] I understand but he repented and he he
[1:38:10] said Lord I was wrong
[1:38:12] and that's the same as we that was the
[1:38:14] son of God but we can never forsake
[1:38:18] never hurt a Son of God or a daughter of
[1:38:24] God
[1:38:25] Jesus Christ tore himself
[1:38:29] into pieces
[1:38:31] and placed those pieces called the Holy
[1:38:36] Spirit into his people
[1:38:39] and then those people represent Christ
[1:38:43] in this day
[1:38:46] and that is who we're dealing with
[1:38:50] that's the difference
[1:38:52] between Peter
[1:38:54] and between Judas let's stand
[1:38:57] [Music]
[1:39:10] friends we fail so much
[1:39:12] [Music]
[1:39:16] and how many things have we all done
[1:39:17] wrong
[1:39:19] but is there repentance in our heart
[1:39:23] when we fail is it
[1:39:26] is it to promote ourselves
[1:39:28] is it to benefit ourselves
[1:39:31] or is it just because we messed up
[1:39:35] we have a choice
[1:39:37] are we going to be a Judas are we going
[1:39:39] to be a Peter
[1:39:42] we're going to be all the other
[1:39:43] disciples and we're going to be a son of
[1:39:46] God
[1:39:49] let's think about it today as we prepare
[1:39:51] for tonight's communion
[1:39:55] it'll be at the normal time
[1:39:58] let's bow our heads
[1:40:00] [Music]
