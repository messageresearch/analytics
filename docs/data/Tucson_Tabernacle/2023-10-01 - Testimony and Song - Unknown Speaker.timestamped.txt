[25:46] serve each of you I'm doing my best as I
[25:48] seek the Lord and to preach and and to
[25:52] try to guide us in the right
[25:55] direction and I want to make sure
[25:57] everyone know knows that when I
[26:00] Minister I
[26:02] try to minister on both
[26:05] sides I try to minister on the more
[26:09] conservative side which is the way I
[26:10] live my life in in the way that I
[26:14] believe especially for me Jesus said
[26:17] Lord I sanctify myself for their sake
[26:20] and then I also Minister on the side
[26:23] that we need to be
[26:25] careful of legalism and we need to be
[26:28] careful of the the doctrines that are
[26:30] more like the Pharisees and the
[26:32] Sadducees we need to be careful of that
[26:34] Spirit too there we have to be careful
[26:37] of the spirit the lacad isical spirit
[26:39] over here the sinful Spirit the the
[26:42] spirit that that just doesn't care that
[26:44] wants to live their own lives and
[26:45] doesn't doesn't try to live that life
[26:48] perfect before the Lord and then over
[26:49] here we also need to be careful of the
[26:52] the condescending Spirit the spirit that
[26:55] um points a finger at every at other
[26:58] people and I just want to say I
[27:01] appreciate everyone I love everyone and
[27:05] whether Paul said this and I can't I
[27:08] can't find the scripture I didn't know I
[27:10] was going to say this but the Apostle
[27:12] said whatever you do you do it for the
[27:16] Lord he said if you if you honor the
[27:20] Sabbath you do it for the Lord if you if
[27:24] you worship on Saturday you do it for
[27:25] the Lord if you worship on Sunday
[27:28] and not on Saturday you're doing it for
[27:29] the Lord if you eat meat if if if you're
[27:33] eating you're eating for the Lord if
[27:34] you're fasting you're fasting for the
[27:36] Lord whatever we do we should do for the
[27:39] Lord and if we're trying to live we're
[27:42] TR we should all be trying to walk that
[27:44] straight laced walk and we should be
[27:47] doing it for the Lord everything is for
[27:49] the Lord our testimonies tonight they're

[42:38] Great Is Our
[42:43] God thank you
[42:45] sister God bless you this is definitely
[42:48] for the glory of God so I have this
[42:51] testimony a few weeks ago I had a visit
[42:53] with my new doctor and she was there to
[42:55] read review my options of how I take my
[42:58] dialysis treatments and more
[43:00] specifically to inform and advise me
[43:03] against using a vascular catheter so a
[43:07] quick note on the catheter essentially I
[43:09] have a foreign object in my heart and an
[43:13] open port on my shoulder uh so as I sat
[43:17] listening um as she took several minutes
[43:20] to explain the major risk factors and
[43:23] the statistics regarding the infections
[43:25] the blockages and the blood clots that
[43:27] these catheters are known for um she
[43:30] earnestly told me that it wasn't 100%
[43:34] sure that I would get an infection but
[43:37] 200% the statistics are so high for the
[43:40] rate of infection but that I would
[43:42] certainly get an infection yet as she
[43:45] spoke she suddenly seemed to realize
[43:47] what she was saying to me and she
[43:49] stopped talking because I've never had
[43:52] an infection I've never had a blockage
[43:55] in my heart and I've never had blood
[43:57] clots and I've had catheters for 10
[44:00] years and as we were talking I had this
[44:04] funny moment where she looked at me and
[44:07] she said Sarah you're the
[44:10] exception and then she stopped and you
[44:12] could just see it Dawning in her as she
[44:15] was realizing who she's talking to and
[44:17] she said this is really a miracle and I
[44:22] said yes it
[44:24] is it absolutely is a miracle and I I
[44:29] sometimes forget you know I go in
[44:31] routine and year after year weekend
[44:34] after week and every time I'm it's not
[44:37] something I'm thinking about but every
[44:38] now and again when I have these kind of
[44:41] uh situations with the doctors it's just
[44:43] brought again to me the way that God is
[44:46] the differen maker he's keeping my life
[44:49] and I just wanted to be faithful again
[44:51] in giving God all the praise and all the
[44:53] glory for his Mercy his word that he's
[44:57] keeping and when he said the footsteps
[44:59] of the righteous shall not be moved
[45:01] we've prayed over all of these catheters
[45:03] over all of these things that I go
[45:05] through and I put my foot down and I say
[45:07] Lord you said I don't have to move on
[45:09] this I don't have to slide on this I
[45:11] don't have to take an infection I don't
[45:12] have to take blockages in my heart or my
[45:14] arteries and he's done that and I just
[45:17] want to remind us all he's faithful
[45:19] whatever you ask in his name believing
[45:21] he can do that for you so praise God I'm
[45:24] so grateful I think we all know this

[1:08:18] brandom said if you can't figure out
[1:08:20] what to tell someone when you're
[1:08:21] witnessing to them tell them how your
[1:08:23] candle got lit sister marily you have a
[1:08:26] testimony of how that candle got
[1:08:30] lit well first of all I just want to let
[1:08:34] you all know that I love the Lord with
[1:08:35] all my heart soul and might and I was
[1:08:40] raised in a Godly
[1:08:43] home my father was a
[1:08:46] minister and I went to church all the
[1:08:51] time and my grandparents
[1:08:54] they love love the Lord and serve the
[1:08:57] Lord and my great grandparents so I have
[1:09:00] quite a Heritage that you know I wanted
[1:09:04] to hold up
[1:09:05] to but as you know we sought the Lord to
[1:09:10] give us the holy spirit that was really
[1:09:12] important in our life and I would go up
[1:09:16] I remember being ever so young and we'd
[1:09:19] be at the altar and
[1:09:21] just just seeking God and and the
[1:09:25] Brethren would say you got it you got it
[1:09:28] and I'd say really and I didn't feel
[1:09:32] like I had gotten it and I uh so I went
[1:09:37] a years would go by we'd have services
[1:09:39] like this all the time and I just seemed
[1:09:42] like I couldn't break
[1:09:46] through I tried hard but I couldn't
[1:09:49] break through and it was like I was just
[1:09:52] kind of going through the emotions going
[1:09:55] through I I love the Lord and I I wanted
[1:09:58] to serve him but I was like not
[1:10:01] really really um getting through to him
[1:10:05] as I wanted to and I remember when I was
[1:10:11] 23 years
[1:10:13] old I had just said okay this is it I
[1:10:17] just can't do this anymore it's too hard
[1:10:20] I can't seem to find my away and I
[1:10:25] what's wrong with me and I went into my
[1:10:28] my bedroom and I closed the
[1:10:31] door and I knelt down by my bed and I
[1:10:36] just cried out to God and I said
[1:10:40] Lord I can't do this
[1:10:43] anymore I can't fight this anymore but
[1:10:46] Lord if you're the God that I know you
[1:10:48] are you will do this for me because I
[1:10:52] can't do this anymore more and the
[1:10:54] minute the minute I asked him to do it
[1:10:58] for
[1:10:59] me I felt that Spirit come down and he
[1:11:04] just to I just wept and I wept and I
[1:11:06] wept and I wept my mother thought I was
[1:11:08] having a nervous breakdown she comes in
[1:11:10] and she picks me up and holds me and rs
[1:11:12] me I said mother it's okay it's over I
[1:11:17] have it now and he's going to take care
[1:11:20] of me the rest of my life and I will not
[1:11:22] worry any more because he is there for
[1:11:25] me and he will guide and direct me so I
[1:11:29] just thank the Lord I could share
[1:11:31] [Applause]
[1:11:39] this talking thank you as sister marily
[1:11:42] was talking you got to wonder she says I
[1:11:46] can't do it
[1:11:47] anymore and there's just something that
[1:11:50] she's struggling and it's like Lord I
[1:11:51] can't do it anymore I can't do it
[1:11:52] anymore I can't do what
[1:11:54] anymore that's the Holy Spirit
[1:11:58] pulling drawing us there's a deep
[1:12:03] calling to a
[1:12:05] deep and that's what's pulling it's not
[1:12:08] sin that's pulling on us you think lord
[1:12:10] I can't do it anymore it's because
[1:12:12] that's the spirit of God pulling on us
[1:12:15] it's wanting to fill us the spirit
[1:12:19] brother brandom said that the Lord wants
[1:12:21] to fill us with the Holy Spirit more
[1:12:23] more than we want to have it so that's
[1:12:26] that pull that that you feel that that
[1:12:29] it's like Lord I just can't do it
[1:12:30] anymore I need more I need more I need
[1:12:32] more and that's that's him drawing you
[1:12:35] and you think I can't do it anymore
[1:12:37] that's the spirit and he wants us

[1:13:19] glass ceiling I couldn't get through and
[1:13:21] I would hear different p up up the front
[1:13:24] saying when you know that you know that
[1:13:26] you know and you know they would ask
[1:13:28] several times you know who raise your
[1:13:31] hand if the Lord came today or tonight
[1:13:33] would you be ready I can never raise my
[1:13:35] hand it's not that I didn't want to but
[1:13:37] I just I
[1:13:38] couldn't and fast you know I've been
[1:13:41] baptized and I I also didn't feel like I
[1:13:44] had the Holy Ghost fast forward to
[1:13:47] having children and a
[1:13:48] husband um I would really stress to them
[1:13:52] you need to have have a relationship
[1:13:54] with the Lord Jesus and a lot of that
[1:13:55] stress was turmoil because I felt like I
[1:13:58] don't have that I want that but I just
[1:14:00] I'd be at the altar I I do all these
[1:14:02] things I just there was something that I
[1:14:05] just couldn't break
[1:14:06] through and um
[1:14:10] so some you know in the past you know I
[1:14:14] don't know maybe a couple months or so
[1:14:15] the sermons have been really hitting me
[1:14:17] and and they do you know I always felt
[1:14:19] like yes I believe amen that's it that's
[1:14:21] for me but secretly I want wanted
[1:14:23] somebody from the pulpit to come down
[1:14:25] and say this is what's wrong with you I
[1:14:27] I didn't care if they told everybody
[1:14:28] tell me tell me what it is and I was
[1:14:30] hoping the Lord would just say Unice you
[1:14:32] have to do this this and that or this is
[1:14:33] in your life and he wouldn't um and so
[1:14:38] little things with the sermons were
[1:14:40] slowly Breaking Me Down not not in a bad
[1:14:42] way but they were tugging at my heart
[1:14:45] and I didn't realize that the Lord was
[1:14:47] softening my heart to things that I
[1:14:49] didn't know that I had stones that I
[1:14:51] didn't know were there so it Camp when
[1:14:54] brother thadius was you know talking
[1:14:56] about the stones and the Holy Spirit
[1:14:58] being pushed out because you have these
[1:14:59] Stones I thought yes okay these Stones I
[1:15:02] I want to get rid of
[1:15:03] them and uh a couple last Tuesday I was
[1:15:08] um the girls and I were reading our
[1:15:10] Bible and we were in First Corinthians
[1:15:12] and um you know it says any man who
[1:15:16] loves God is known of him and you know
[1:15:20] we we're reading and reading and I I
[1:15:22] can't I can't understand but the rest of
[1:15:23] what's reading because all I can fixate
[1:15:25] is on that one
[1:15:27] sentence I later throughout the day you
[1:15:30] know it just doesn't leave me so I go
[1:15:31] and I start looking at different um
[1:15:34] translations and there's a lot of them
[1:15:36] but they all say the same thing and I
[1:15:39] thought is it is that it you the Lord
[1:15:41] has been doing things in my life all of
[1:15:44] my life so I knew he was there but I
[1:15:45] just was like I I just need something
[1:15:48] from you I need to know that you're you
[1:15:51] you do love me you could tell me me all
[1:15:53] day long how much the lord loves me but
[1:15:55] it doesn't hit you until it hits you and
[1:15:58] it makes sense to you
[1:16:02] so I I read through these
[1:16:05] translations and they all said this the
[1:16:07] same thing you know in different words
[1:16:10] and I said that's it my little you know
[1:16:13] junky way of loving the Lord because I
[1:16:15] know I could never love him enough
[1:16:18] that's all he wants from me and he'll
[1:16:20] he'll make me love him more he'll make
[1:16:22] me do the things that I I know I should
[1:16:25] or or the things I don't even know about
[1:16:27] he'll do that for me not me trying
[1:16:29] really hard to get
[1:16:30] in and um so I was just really really
[1:16:34] happy and so I was talking to my
[1:16:36] daughter and I told her about these
[1:16:37] translations and then just out of
[1:16:40] nowhere I said now I know that I know
[1:16:43] that I
[1:16:44] know and there was just such a piece
[1:16:47] about it and I said well this
[1:16:49] it that was it like you know the Lord
[1:16:52] didn't have to beat me me over the head
[1:16:53] I did enough of that but he just showed
[1:16:55] me yeah Unice I know
[1:16:59] you so I just want to you know thank the
[1:17:02] Lord if you're on that journey I just
[1:17:03] want you to know that when it's your
[1:17:06] time you know my time was I'm almost 40
[1:17:08] years old but the Lord will if you seek
[1:17:12] him he'll come to you or he'll reveal
[1:17:14] himself to you he will if he can do it
[1:17:16] to someone as low as me he can do it for
[1:17:20] you am amen
[1:17:33] sister sang that
[1:17:35] song he walks with me and he talks with
[1:17:39] me and he tells me I am his own and how
[1:17:44] good does it feel sister Eunice when he
[1:17:47] tells me I am his own there is nothing
[1:17:53] that separate that can separate me from
[1:17:55] the love of God it says neither height
[1:17:59] nor depth nor any creature nothing can
[1:18:04] separate me from the love of God and it
[1:18:06] feels so good when it anchors down in
[1:18:10] your heart and you just know it he's
[1:18:13] always going to be there for
[1:18:18] me um most of you know part of my test
[1:18:23] me um when I was when the lord gave me a
[1:18:25] new birth and all but I left something
[1:18:28] out I my cousin I was about 13 anyway my
[1:18:33] cousin had said she said have you read
[1:18:36] the exposition of the seven Church ages
[1:18:39] and I
[1:18:40] said yes we did years ago because my dad
[1:18:44] had and Mom had bought us all one and we
[1:18:46] read it along with the brother reading
[1:18:48] it and um even down to the baby had one
[1:18:51] it was really neat but
[1:18:53] um so we all had our own and she she
[1:18:57] said well she said it is so precious she
[1:19:01] said I just read it and she was just a
[1:19:03] couple years older than me and I thought
[1:19:05] you know what I better read it
[1:19:07] again so I started reading it and the
[1:19:10] Lord and you know how brother ROM talked
[1:19:12] about I don't know if you who how many
[1:19:14] have read it or not but how he said to
[1:19:18] pray every day for Revelation he prayed
[1:19:21] that whoever read that book book that
[1:19:23] God would reveal what was in it to them
[1:19:27] and I
[1:19:29] desperately wanted the Lord to reveal
[1:19:31] his word to me and so I just cried out
[1:19:34] to God to do so and in that book he
[1:19:37] said if you had the least
[1:19:40] tug to toward God to run toward that
[1:19:44] with all that you have because you are
[1:19:46] one of the most blessed persons on the
[1:19:48] face of this
[1:19:50] Earth that was one of the things that so
[1:19:55] spoke to me because
[1:19:57] I the Lord was talking very much at my
[1:20:00] heart and I knew that I needed to run
[1:20:03] toward that with every fiber of my
[1:20:06] being and so I just want to thank him
[1:20:10] and every that
[1:20:15] book it's so full of the word of God
[1:20:19] it's so beautiful and being a a young
[1:20:23] teenager like that I didn't understand a
[1:20:24] lot of it although I had underst I had
[1:20:26] listened to brother bom all my
[1:20:29] life and so I said Lord I know the
[1:20:32] message of the hour is the truth and the
[1:20:34] Bible is the truth and I said so every
[1:20:37] little part that I couldn't
[1:20:39] comprehend I said Lord I'm laying it on
[1:20:41] the Shelf I know that this is the truth
[1:20:44] I'm asking you to reveal this to me
[1:20:46] because I cannot reveal this to
[1:20:48] myself and you want to know something I
[1:20:51] read through the book I've got through
[1:20:53] the book but now when I go back and read
[1:20:56] it the stimulation of Revelation is the
[1:21:00] most unbelievably glorious thing on the
[1:21:02] face of this Earth Revelation from God
[1:21:05] no one can take
[1:21:12] time one day he called me to
[1:21:16] him and I was so
[1:21:21] thirsty
[1:21:25] I asked for
[1:21:28] water my throat
[1:21:31] was so
[1:21:33] [Music]
[1:21:36] dry he gave me
[1:21:40] water that I had never dreamed
[1:21:45] [Music]
[1:21:47] of but for this
[1:21:51] water my my Lord had to
[1:21:59] die he said I
[1:22:02] thirst yet he made the
[1:22:08] [Music]
[1:22:10] rivers he said I
[1:22:14] thirst yet he
[1:22:16] made the
[1:22:21] sea said I
[1:22:25] thirst the king of the
[1:22:31] [Music]
[1:22:33] ages his great
[1:22:36] thirst he brought
[1:22:38] [Music]
[1:22:39] water to
[1:22:44] me now there's a
[1:22:48] river that
[1:22:50] flows as clear as
[1:22:54] [Music]
[1:22:57] Crystal it flows
[1:22:59] from God's
[1:23:03] throne
[1:23:04] [Music]
[1:23:07] above and like a
[1:23:11] river it Wells up inside
[1:23:19] me bringing
[1:23:21] Mercy
[1:23:24] [Music]
[1:23:26] and sing it with
[1:23:29] me he said I
[1:23:33] thirst yet he made the
[1:23:37] [Music]
[1:23:40] river he said I
[1:23:44] thirst yet he made the
[1:23:51] SE he said I
[1:23:55] thirst the king of the
[1:23:59] [Music]
[1:24:02] ages in his great
[1:24:05] thirst he brought
[1:24:09] water to
[1:24:12] [Music]
[1:24:14] me in his great
[1:24:17] thirst he brought
[1:24:21] water to
[1:24:23] [Music]
[1:24:32] [Applause]
[1:24:41] me let's stand for a moment while we if
[1:24:45] anybody knows about the love of Jesus
[1:24:50] who
[1:24:51] does I
[1:24:55] do I
[1:24:58] do
[1:25:00] oh if anybody knows about the love of
[1:25:07] Jesus I
[1:25:09] do oh yes I
[1:25:14] do oh if anybody knows about the grace
[1:25:20] of
[1:25:21] Jesus
[1:25:23] I
[1:25:26] do I
[1:25:28] do
[1:25:30] oh if anybody knows about the grace of
[1:25:37] Jesus I do oh yes I do do you know about
[1:25:43] his power oh if anybody knows about the
[1:25:49] power of
[1:25:51] Jesus
[1:25:53] I
[1:25:55] do oh yes I
[1:25:59] do oh if anybody knows about the power
[1:26:04] of
[1:26:06] Jesus I do oh yes I
[1:26:13] do oh if anybody knows about the love of
[1:26:20] Jesus I I
[1:26:24] do I
[1:26:27] do oh if anybody knows about the love of
[1:26:35] Jesus I do oh yes I
[1:26:41] do you may be seated as sister hope was
[1:26:45] was talking in the song that she was
[1:26:48] singing about how Jesus thirsted and
[1:26:51] maybe think about that sermon that Jesus
[1:26:54] preached on the mount we call it the
[1:26:57] Beatitudes and he said this he made this
[1:26:59] statement sister Lonnie and brother lion
[1:27:02] I'm gonna I'm gonna bring the microphone
[1:27:03] to you in just a minute he made this
[1:27:06] statement he said blessed are they that
[1:27:11] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[1:27:15] for they shall be filled sister Unice as
[1:27:19] we're
[1:27:20] blessed just to have that
[1:27:24] desire to to get closer with the Lord
[1:27:27] that desire of righteousness we are
[1:27:30] blessed just to have that
[1:27:33] desire I said I've said a few times
[1:27:37] people seeking they're they're seeking
[1:27:40] that that Assurance Lord I just want to
[1:27:43] know I just want to know that that I am
[1:27:47] yours I just want you to reveal that to
[1:27:50] me and I've said many times I wish I had
[1:27:52] a whole congregation I wish everyone in
[1:27:55] that congregation had that desire that
[1:27:58] Lord I want that I want to know I want
[1:28:01] to know you better and I think that even
[1:28:04] once you receive the Holy Spirit once
[1:28:07] you receive that Spirit then it starts
[1:28:08] to even get stronger because you know
[1:28:11] the Lord a little bit better Lord I want
[1:28:13] you I want more of you I want more and
[1:28:15] then there's more desperation and that
[1:28:17] desperation just grows and grows and
[1:28:19] grows and when you finally receive
[1:28:22] receive that
[1:28:24] Assurance then it starts to get stronger
[1:28:28] and you start to seek him more and Lord
[1:28:30] I want you more I want you more the more
[1:28:32] you pray the more that you want to pray
[1:28:34] the more you testify the more you want
[1:28:36] to testify the more you read your Bible
[1:28:38] the the more you want to read your Bible
[1:28:40] and that desire just grows from from
[1:28:43] just it grows from nothing and it just
[1:28:46] gets stronger and stronger and I think
[1:28:49] of that blessed are they that hunger and
[1:28:52] thirst after righteousness for they
[1:28:55] shall be filled what a promise sister
[1:29:02] Lonnie hello
[1:29:04] everyone um I just want to thank
[1:29:07] everybody for helping and and like
[1:29:11] supporting our pastor because a lot of
[1:29:13] the stuff that he's done has helped our
[1:29:20] family
[1:29:22] sorry I've had a really bad pain in my
[1:29:25] in my arm and when we went to Camp um
[1:29:29] before we went to Camp I had a dream my
[1:29:31] husband has a a special gift some of you
[1:29:33] guys know um when he speaks to the Lord
[1:29:36] the Lord gives him guidance and he prays
[1:29:39] for people and people seem to get healed
[1:29:41] um so I had a dream before we went and
[1:29:45] God said well your husband's going to
[1:29:47] pray for you and you're going to be
[1:29:48] you're going to be fine and I'm like I'm
[1:29:50] not going to ask him he's praying for
[1:29:51] all these other people he's too busy
[1:29:53] whatever I got to keep going well with
[1:29:55] being a mother of quite a bit of
[1:29:56] children and having a big family I got
[1:29:58] to keep going but the pain kept getting
[1:30:00] worse and worse to where I couldn't even
[1:30:02] put my watch on the pain was extremely
[1:30:04] bad and I would hint to him man if I
[1:30:08] just get prayed for maybe I'd feel
[1:30:09] better but he didn't get the hint just
[1:30:12] kept going about his day so at the camp
[1:30:15] um we were definitely blessed with
[1:30:17] brother Thaddius his um sermon and I
[1:30:19] went up and I was prayed for well at the
[1:30:21] back of the church I was talking to a
[1:30:23] couple sisters and he came running at me
[1:30:24] like a mad man and he laid hands on me
[1:30:26] and he prayed for me and it's not it's
[1:30:29] not a healing it's a miracle like I this
[1:30:31] is the hand I can hold the microphone
[1:30:33] and and it was definitely a blessing and
[1:30:35] I just give all glory to God and I just
[1:30:37] want to thank him for his mercies and
[1:30:40] guidance and that little small voice
[1:30:42] that told me he's going to pray for you
[1:30:43] oh no no and I just kind of shred it off
[1:30:45] it was the truth and I just thank God
[1:30:47] for everything thank
[1:30:50] you
[1:30:54] yeah I'd like to say greetings to
[1:30:57] everybody God bless you I'm going to
[1:30:59] step out here just so you can kind of
[1:31:00] see me a little better but yeah there
[1:31:02] was so many things that happened at that
[1:31:05] camp that was just amazing um you I got
[1:31:09] a two-part testimony and uh brother
[1:31:11] Daniel don't know it but he's going to
[1:31:13] help me with the second part here uh my
[1:31:15] original testimony that I was going to
[1:31:17] give is uh it uh the both both parts in
[1:31:21] involveed the camp
[1:31:23] but um our daughter capani was with us
[1:31:27] at the camp and um we named her after um
[1:31:32] a queen in Hawaii she was Queen cap
[1:31:35] Alani now this queen she was bound by
[1:31:38] the traditions of the uh old Hawaiian
[1:31:41] culture where they had great fear of the
[1:31:44] volcano and there were certain things
[1:31:46] they had to do to appease the volcanoes
[1:31:48] and namely one volcano was named Pelle
[1:31:52] now the story was that a woman wasn't
[1:31:55] able to go up to Pella and uh eat
[1:31:57] anything in front of the volcano
[1:31:59] anywhere near it without first offering
[1:32:00] it to the volcano or she'd be
[1:32:03] consumed
[1:32:04] so my daughter comes from a line of
[1:32:07] Portuguese missionaries and she doesn't
[1:32:10] know it we'll tell her the story but
[1:32:12] Portuguese missionaries went there and
[1:32:14] when they told the Queen capani the
[1:32:16] story of
[1:32:18] Jesus she heard it and she was so
[1:32:20] touched in her heart she abandon her old
[1:32:23] faith and just to prove to her to the uh
[1:32:27] Elders of her uh of her group she had
[1:32:30] them walk with her up to the uh mouth of
[1:32:33] volcano Pelle and she had some oel
[1:32:36] berries with her and she says look I'm
[1:32:38] going to eat these berries in front of
[1:32:40] this volcano goddess Pelle they call her
[1:32:43] the goddess Pelle nothing's going to
[1:32:45] happen to me or nothing's going to
[1:32:47] happen to you because I believe now that
[1:32:50] the god that created this volcano also
[1:32:53] created me and I was shown to have a
[1:32:57] holy respectful fear of the Creator not
[1:32:59] the creation so she stood there on the
[1:33:02] power of God in Jesus's name and she ate
[1:33:05] the berries she proved to her to the
[1:33:07] tribesmen that nothing happened a lot of
[1:33:10] them converted to Christianity that day
[1:33:13] so our daughter we named her
[1:33:15] capani now when we were at the camp
[1:33:18] capani started getting a little bit
[1:33:20] unruly so we had a bring her to the
[1:33:22] cabin and we had to have our own little
[1:33:24] quiet time with
[1:33:26] her all right now just like kids her age
[1:33:30] she's 11 she's going to be turning
[1:33:32] 12 uh this week on the 5th you know she
[1:33:35] start acting a little bit on rly she
[1:33:37] gets you know they get to that age we
[1:33:39] took her into the cabin we started
[1:33:41] mentioning God you know God doesn't want
[1:33:45] you to act this way you he wants you to
[1:33:47] uh you know to be good you know we got
[1:33:50] to say a prayer she starts lashing out
[1:33:53] and how do I know God's real how do you
[1:33:55] know God's
[1:33:57] real you know and I finally had to sit
[1:34:00] her down on the bed in the cabin I said
[1:34:03] you you want to know how I
[1:34:06] know that God is real yeah tell me how
[1:34:10] you know God's real tell me I said okay
[1:34:13] sit down right
[1:34:14] there I said a little long time ago not
[1:34:17] too long ago a little more than 11 years
[1:34:20] ago
[1:34:23] I said there was a baby girl
[1:34:26] born I said now this baby girl she was
[1:34:29] born a little bit
[1:34:30] premature I think about what two
[1:34:33] months little small baby born
[1:34:37] premature inside the hospital the
[1:34:40] doctors nurses everybody was struggling
[1:34:42] for her to be able to eat on her own she
[1:34:44] wasn't eating she didn't want to latch
[1:34:46] onto the bottle or anything so inside
[1:34:49] the
[1:34:50] hospital they started doing all kinds of
[1:34:52] tests on her they got to a point they
[1:34:54] were putting a bunch of needles in her
[1:34:56] head and doing a bunch of
[1:34:57] things and uh they got her to the point
[1:35:00] where they thought she'd be able to go
[1:35:03] home and I told her this little baby
[1:35:05] girl so she went home with her mother
[1:35:08] and father when she got home she still
[1:35:10] wasn't eating she was getting weaker and
[1:35:14] weaker I said the mother and father had
[1:35:16] to take her back to the hospital and

[1:39:59] happened she's suddenly eaten like
[1:40:02] normal my wife said my husband prayed
[1:40:04] for
[1:40:05] her so now we're in the cabinet Camp I
[1:40:08] told my baby girl I said
[1:40:11] listen I
[1:40:13] said that baby girl's father asked his
[1:40:17] father to let her
[1:40:19] live so you want want to know how I know
[1:40:21] God is real I said that little baby girl
[1:40:25] was
[1:40:27] [Applause]
[1:40:32] you so it was a blessing for us to be
[1:40:34] somewhere at Camp she had never heard
[1:40:36] that story this is the first time I've
[1:40:38] told it anywhere it was a blessing for
[1:40:40] her to be at the camp and for her to for
[1:40:42] her to hear that and now for the second
[1:40:45] part of my
[1:40:47] testimony we were at camp and I learned
[1:40:49] a lot of things um first of all it was
[1:40:52] the first Christian Camp I've ever been
[1:40:54] to in my
[1:40:55] life so it was great I think even the
[1:40:58] brother uh Daniel Jr came up to me one
[1:41:01] evening and I was just sitting by the
[1:41:02] fire by myself and he said you know
[1:41:04] brother Lionel you seem to be enjoying
[1:41:06] this Camp more than
[1:41:08] anybody I said when I was a little boy I
[1:41:11] never came to No Such Camp as this I
[1:41:13] said this is great I said yes I am
[1:41:15] enjoying
[1:41:17] it but anyway we learned about quiet
[1:41:19] time
[1:41:21] and
[1:41:22] uh that's what the brother Daniel
[1:41:24] explained we kind of went off for an
[1:41:25] hour he said hey during Camp the
[1:41:27] greatest thing we can all do is we could
[1:41:30] have quiet time that's when we're going
[1:41:31] to set aside an hour everybody pick a
[1:41:33] place goes be quiet you could pray you
[1:41:35] could read the Bible you could just
[1:41:36] meditate do some things maybe listen to
[1:41:38] something and that's what's called quiet
[1:41:40] time he says I've known in the past when
[1:41:42] I've been involved in camps like this uh
[1:41:44] quiet time is one of the best things I
[1:41:46] was able to take home with me so we
[1:41:48] started uh doing quiet time time and
[1:41:51] then uh quiet time evolved to where the
[1:41:55] Conch Shell was blown so that it could
[1:41:57] signify the beginning of quiet time so
[1:41:59] with a conch shell it's another Hawaiian
[1:42:01] uh like he said it's like the brother
[1:42:04] Daniel said it's like the chofar and
[1:42:05] they blew it in the islands of Hawaii to
[1:42:07] alert make an alert of something going
[1:42:10] on so the con shell was blown during
[1:42:12] quiet time
[1:42:14] um uh brother Daniel pointed out to me
[1:42:17] Three Wooden Crosses that was across the
[1:42:19] grass and he said wow
[1:42:22] it' be great if was sit right in the
[1:42:24] middle of them Three Wooden Crosses
[1:42:26] during quiet time and I looked across
[1:42:29] and I said yeah that'd be
[1:42:31] nice and then I noticed a couple of days
[1:42:34] go by nobody ever sat in between those
[1:42:36] Three Wooden
[1:42:37] Crosses so on the third day I said you
[1:42:41] know what I'm going to go sit
[1:42:42] there so I went and sat in between them
[1:42:45] Three Wooden
[1:42:46] Crosses and I
[1:42:49] thought I'm going to uh I don't have no
[1:42:51] shade here I'm going to be here for an
[1:42:53] hour I need some shade so there was a
[1:42:54] beam of the shadow of the middle cross
[1:42:57] that came across so I lined my chair
[1:42:59] right up with that shadow just so at
[1:43:01] least the sun wouldn't be in my
[1:43:03] eyes and then I started
[1:43:05] thinking about a sun dial you know those
[1:43:08] that been Boy Scouts have been out
[1:43:11] there's a sunnd dial you could put a
[1:43:12] stick in the ground and it castes a
[1:43:14] shadow and you put a rock to mark it and
[1:43:16] you can Mark time so I thought you know
[1:43:20] when the conqu shell blows I'm going to
[1:43:22] put a rock right here on the Shadow and
[1:43:24] I'm going to measure the time of an hour
[1:43:26] and see what happens so I did that the
[1:43:28] con shell
[1:43:30] blew I put the rock there I measured
[1:43:32] time so I sat there thinking about time
[1:43:38] and meditating about time and then I'm
[1:43:40] looking at the Three Wooden
[1:43:41] Crosses and then I'm thinking about
[1:43:43] quiet time I'm thinking about the camp
[1:43:46] I'm thinking about brother Daniel the
[1:43:48] three crosses I'm thinking about about a
[1:43:50] lot of
[1:43:53] things and so
[1:43:55] today let me first tell you that sister
[1:43:58] marily she's the church
[1:44:01] Bulldog she was the one in the back that
[1:44:03] says you better get up and at least tell
[1:44:05] that part and you got to tell this I
[1:44:06] said okay okay I'm going she would if I
[1:44:09] didn't come up here I'm convinced she
[1:44:10] would have drugged me up here to tell
[1:44:11] this part but in the heard events I
[1:44:15] prepared for this
[1:44:16] part and this is where the brother
[1:44:19] Daniel is going to help me out here
[1:44:21] and I find it to
[1:44:23] be the way God works is just absolutely
[1:44:27] amazing because before I came up here
[1:44:30] brother Daniel mentioned the camp he
[1:44:31] mentioned quiet time and he mentioned
[1:44:34] Noah and the Ark and the two boys
[1:44:37] sitting there reading the Bible now all
[1:44:40] of which all of
[1:44:43] which brother Daniel is going to find in
[1:44:45] a
[1:44:46] bag of a gift that I made for him and
[1:44:49] this is my appreciation
[1:44:51] like my wife said for all that you do
[1:44:52] for here at the church and for us now
[1:44:56] I've given God my heart I'm going to
[1:44:59] give brother Daniel a piece of my heart
[1:45:01] and I know the way brother Daniel is
[1:45:02] he's going to want to share it with the
[1:45:03] church So eventually I'm going to make
[1:45:05] this available to the rest of the church
[1:45:07] and I'm going to pass the microphone
[1:45:08] over to him he'll show you what I got
[1:45:10] him and he's going to read it for
[1:45:13] us
[1:45:19] wow
[1:45:24] it's a picture of a
[1:45:26] fire by lyl
[1:45:30] Salazar says
[1:45:33] this what group will gather when the con
[1:45:37] shell doth
[1:45:39] blow neath the vast expanse of Sky even
[1:45:42] us will we
[1:45:44] go our feet tread the
[1:45:47] ground where once we were found found a
[1:45:50] long time ago fashion in your IM
[1:45:54] fashioned in your image and the likeness
[1:45:58] to know your spirit is in
[1:46:01] US you wanted to
[1:46:04] show a
[1:46:06] Creator to save those who were
[1:46:10] lost with no way out death was the
[1:46:14] cost even for
[1:46:17] us you died on the cross amen
[1:46:21] the good path we follow in the Eternal
[1:46:25] length they shall wait upon the Lord
[1:46:29] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:46:31] their
[1:46:34] strength like Noah of
[1:46:38] old who pleaded and told a message of
[1:46:42] warning so mighty and bold from heaven
[1:46:45] above came the piece of a dove for all
[1:46:48] to feed your eternal love
[1:46:51] love you called them to Safety in an ark
[1:46:55] by the ramp now we wait on a whisper
[1:47:00] your voice is our lamp it's quiet
[1:47:05] time at the Tucson Tabernacle
[1:47:11] [Applause]
[1:47:19] camp
[1:47:29] wow there's three crosses here I
[1:47:32] remember I looked over
[1:47:34] at brother Lionel and I I saw him
[1:47:37] sitting sitting under those three
[1:47:39] crosses and it it blessed me brother
[1:47:42] liono beyond
[1:47:45] measure in time hung a man unto death he
[1:47:50] was lost a criminal for sure life's end
[1:47:54] was the cross mockery and blasphemy
[1:47:57] echoed about when the Man's eyes were
[1:47:59] open he found his way out the king hung
[1:48:03] beside
[1:48:06] him the world's sin he did
[1:48:09] Bear they whipped him and cursed him
[1:48:12] death was the
[1:48:14] snare the man proclaimed truly his life
[1:48:18] was unruly for him Jesus hung and was
[1:48:22] treated so
[1:48:24] cruy the Angels did
[1:48:27] sing when he gave to the king a true
[1:48:30] repentant heart his life's Saving start
[1:48:34] the only way out Heaven's Victory
[1:48:37] shout still creation wept at the third
[1:48:41] hour of the day the Creator the king
[1:48:44] with a broken voice he did say for you
[1:48:49] it is
[1:48:50] paid for you is the price verily I say
[1:48:55] unto thee
[1:48:57] today shalt thou be with me in Paradise
[1:49:02] according to Luke chapter 23 in
[1:49:06] time hung a man unto death he was lost
[1:49:10] victory was found beside him on the
[1:49:14] cross amen
[1:49:19] oh
[1:49:23] oh what a wonderful testimony I told my
[1:49:27] wife that the
[1:49:35] um my favorite thing at the
[1:49:40] camp
[1:49:43] was maybe I'll share if we have time
[1:49:46] I'll share a testimony of a couple boys
[1:49:49] um
[1:49:51] I saw people healed I saw people come to
[1:49:54] the altar that should have came to the
[1:49:55] altar I saw people weeping there and
[1:49:58] crying and giving their hearts to the
[1:49:59] Lord and how how blessed the camp was
[1:50:04] how blessed you all were there is just a
[1:50:06] good time is a good time in the Lord and
[1:50:10] to see all of these people just
[1:50:12] consecrating their lives but my
[1:50:14] highlight of the
[1:50:17] camp and this may sound strange
[1:50:20] but my highlight of the camp was when we
[1:50:23] ended quiet
[1:50:26] time and I looked there and I saw the
[1:50:30] LEL up at the foot of the cross there
[1:50:33] was three crosses there and I looked
[1:50:36] around and I saw all the people just
[1:50:38] quiet and and and getting and getting
[1:50:41] just having a time of communion with the
[1:50:44] Lord and and I was just I was just
[1:50:46] thanking the lord I was so happy and I
[1:50:48] got up to go find Hano brother the
[1:50:50] lono's
[1:50:52] son and I wanted him to blow the
[1:50:57] conell and I went and got
[1:51:01] him
[1:51:03] and he uh took his earbuds out of his
[1:51:11] ear and
[1:51:13] uh I said uh asked him I said I said how
[1:51:17] you doing and and I could tell the boy
[1:51:19] was
[1:51:22] touched and this was the highlight for
[1:51:26] me I could tell the boy was touched I
[1:51:29] could F that I could feel that that the
[1:51:31] spirit was on the boy and he he was
[1:51:33] feeling good and his first words were
[1:51:37] took it out and he says I just love
[1:51:40] brother brandom's
[1:51:43] preaching like praise the Lord you
[1:51:47] know I want people to know
[1:51:50] I want them to know that God sent a
[1:51:52] prophet I want them to know that this
[1:51:54] Prophet was a sign of the second coming
[1:51:57] of Christ I want them to know that he
[1:51:59] had a message to turn our hearts back to
[1:52:01] that and to see this young man without
[1:52:03] me saying anything and I doubt with the
[1:52:06] parents saying anything to see this
[1:52:09] young man listening to this
[1:52:13] Prophet just him on his own doing it it
[1:52:18] was to me the whole camp
[1:52:20] was worth just that just just having
[1:52:24] that little bit to to see
[1:52:28] that that it's
[1:52:31] working that that that that we're go
[1:52:34] we're we're moving on we're we're we're
[1:52:36] we're going past those things that were
[1:52:39] behind and we're we're coming forward
[1:52:41] and I pray that we can do what this
[1:52:44] Prophet taught us to do that and that is
[1:52:48] the desire of of my heart so thank you
[1:52:53] for the liono for those beautiful
[1:52:56] beautiful
[1:52:58] words um brother Rome I think he stepped
[1:53:02] out as he
[1:53:04] back we'll uh we'll get to brother
[1:53:06] brother Rome it feels since we're
[1:53:10] talking about Camp it feels good let's
[1:53:13] keep talking about
[1:53:16] it I won't say anything but it's your
[1:53:18] birthday tomorrow
[1:53:21] right it it is okay would you give a
[1:53:24] testimony for
[1:53:26] it
[1:53:29] sister um so I'm just gonna talk about
[1:53:31] how cam changed my life I wrote it down
[1:53:35] so that I would have the right words to
[1:53:41] say my life wasn't perfect it was broken
[1:53:45] so much happening in this world and it's
[1:53:47] scary Not only was I running from those
[1:53:50] things but I found myself running from
[1:53:52] me I was seen as a monster but I made
[1:53:56] that image because I was really holding
[1:53:58] on to myself
[1:53:59] broken and alone and it was hard I
[1:54:03] needed help where I would die mentally
[1:54:06] and eventually
[1:54:09] physically God when no one comes for you
[1:54:13] he's who you should go running to right
[1:54:15] but this time I didn't want to go
[1:54:17] running to him I felt like he was tired
[1:54:20] of it as someone in a relationship whose
[1:54:22] partner keeps cheating on them would
[1:54:25] be so I didn't bother then my mom told
[1:54:29] me about a camp and how it would change
[1:54:32] how it would be fun and I was happy to
[1:54:34] be getting out of the house but at the
[1:54:37] same time I didn't really want to go I
[1:54:39] had nothing to do that weekend and being
[1:54:42] home alone wasn't safe for me
[1:54:45] mentally the camp the way everyone and
[1:54:48] everything was felt peaceful like those
[1:54:51] things I was running from were never
[1:54:54] there being in that environment had me
[1:54:56] pick up my Bible again I always knew his
[1:54:59] word but never felt
[1:55:01] it reading it this time was different
[1:55:04] what he showed me at Camp was what I
[1:55:06] always wanted to feel Joy seeing
[1:55:09] everyone's kindness love and laughter
[1:55:11] felt like I really did have a chance it
[1:55:14] felt like this time God came looking for
[1:55:17] me I repented and decided I want to
[1:55:20] change my life and stick to it this

[1:59:55] I did I told you I'm just kidding I got
[1:59:58] testimony to oh okay well he said to
[2:00:02] tell how you got the candle it and I can
[2:00:04] do
[2:00:05] that I was
[2:00:08] taking two of my neighbors to the
[2:00:10] Tabernacle church on Sunday I got kind
[2:00:12] of talked into it by my neighbor Victor
[2:00:15] paye who was brother Milano's
[2:00:18] brother-in-law
[2:00:20] and on the way there a couple times
[2:00:22] after I've taken them I threw out a
[2:00:25] cigarette I had a habit of smoking most
[2:00:27] of my life in the early days and uh this
[2:00:31] one sister put her hand on my shoulder
[2:00:33] and prayed for me I threw the cigarette
[2:00:36] out and I ain't wanted another one since
[2:00:39] amen so I've seen God working in that
[2:00:41] cuz I had tried several times to quit
[2:00:43] and
[2:00:43] couldn't
[2:00:45] then my wife got baptized and
[2:00:50] then we had a little argument my friend
[2:00:53] gave me an old tape recorder and it
[2:00:55] didn't work very good so I worked on it
[2:00:57] for about an hour and couldn't get it to
[2:00:58] play so I set it up on the end
[2:01:00] table and we started arguing about I
[2:01:02] told her that all the prophets were
[2:01:04] until John there was no profit for these
[2:01:06] days but we argued about two or three
[2:01:09] things all of a sudden that tape
[2:01:11] recorder came on and brother Bram
[2:01:13] answered all the questions we were
[2:01:14] arguing about so that was another
[2:01:17] Supernatural thing
[2:01:24] then I heard a tape and I'll never
[2:01:27] forget it it was my uh the one that
[2:01:29] called me then Jesus came and
[2:01:33] called and went to church the next time
[2:01:37] and brother green
[2:01:39] was preached and he was telling a story
[2:01:42] he had a dreamed the night before that
[2:01:44] he baptized two women and one
[2:01:48] man I never asked him to be baptized uh
[2:01:51] the other two women did but he was
[2:01:53] telling the story while he was in the
[2:01:56] bapst water and he didn't know I was
[2:01:59] getting dressed up in to
[2:02:01] get baptized so uh when I walked out he
[2:02:06] was in
[2:02:08] shop but uh he said he'd been praying
[2:02:10] for me so I got baptized but before I
[2:02:13] got there I tried to hang on to the Pew
[2:02:15] as long as I could and I just couldn't
[2:02:17] hang on any longer I was drawing to the
[2:02:21] water and then
[2:02:24] uh we had
[2:02:26] a two kids at that time Connie and Rome
[2:02:28] Jr Rome Jr fell off of my
[2:02:31] mother-in-law's snack bar and had a
[2:02:34] concussion he walked with his head
[2:02:37] tilted he couldn't ride his bike he had
[2:02:39] no
[2:02:40] balance and we took him to the doctor
[2:02:42] and they said he had a concussion and
[2:02:43] was tax raid and everything they was
[2:02:45] going to do surgery on him so the night
[2:02:47] before these
[2:02:50] this the mother of brother Milano called
[2:02:54] on the phone and her and I and and my
[2:02:56] wife Lois prayed for Rome
[2:02:59] Jr he got up the next morning perfectly
[2:03:03] well
[2:03:09] amen so we continue on believe in the
[2:03:12] message because we believed it was true
[2:03:14] had a lot of meetings in her home and
[2:03:16] then brother ato's home I never received
[2:03:19] the Holy Spirit for two years after I
[2:03:22] accepted the Lord but uh then when I did
[2:03:26] I had all the faith in the world so I
[2:03:29] quit my job and traveled with a minister
[2:03:31] for a month and we had a lot of meetings
[2:03:33] in
[2:03:34] Indiana Michigan Ohio Kansas
[2:03:40] Louisiana and I met brother Prim pu Tim
[2:03:43] puit when he was 16 years old he's a
[2:03:46] young boy preaching down in Louisiana we
[2:03:49] spent about a week down there and went
[2:03:51] to his church a couple times and I
[2:03:55] uh questioned all of them about Malachi
[2:03:58] 45 because I still didn't quite
[2:04:00] understand but later on I heard a tape
[2:04:03] where brother Bram said it had a
[2:04:04] two-fold meeting
[2:04:07] meaning so I kind of accepted what he
[2:04:10] said so we've been following the message
[2:04:13] now no we came in the other day I think
[2:04:15] it was 55 years ago and uh we've never
[2:04:19] went back on what people
[2:04:26] believe the other two hours and 55
[2:04:28] minutes I'll have to
[2:04:30] wait good job good
[2:04:33] job bless
[2:04:35] you appreciate brother Rome
[2:04:41] Johnson I
[2:04:43] remember I remember dad I remember
[2:04:46] listening to brother Rome and dad and
[2:04:49] some other brothers Brother Joseph AES I
[2:04:52] was a little I was a young young man I
[2:04:54] remember listening to them talk talk
[2:04:56] about the Lord and talk about brother
[2:04:58] Brown's message and the excitement that
[2:05:01] they had and the love that they had for
[2:05:03] the word of God made an impression on
[2:05:05] me sister
[2:05:08] Teresa um
[2:05:10] satell she wrote this she wasn't able to
[2:05:13] come tonight but she want she had a

[2:05:39] anointing as I prayed for him when I got
[2:05:42] up this morning he followed me to the
[2:05:44] kitchen which surprised me he also ate
[2:05:46] two pieces of a sight of sliced cheese I
[2:05:50] then let him outside where he again
[2:05:53] played with my other two dogs and it was
[2:05:55] a miracle to watch praise the
[2:06:00] Lord thank you to sister Teresa if if

[2:06:08] porch then he cares about our dogs too

[2:08:42] amen beautiful praise the
[2:08:45] Lord have I
[2:08:47] missed besides sister Jessica and uh the
[2:08:51] group that was practicing have I missed
[2:08:53] anyone that had a testimony or a
[2:09:02] song
[2:09:04] No I know that we all have testimonies
[2:09:07] and I know that we could we could be
[2:09:08] here for a long long time but that's
[2:09:11] what heaven's going to be for we're
[2:09:14] going to be giving our testimonies and I
[2:09:16] don't know if there's an etal ET so I
[2:09:19] think it might take a 100 million years
[2:09:21] for us all to give our testimonies and
[2:09:23] after 100 million years we'll have
[2:09:24] forgot them anyway so we'll have to tell
[2:09:26] them again and then again and then again
[2:09:29] and then again it feels good so if you
[2:09:31] all could make your way forward I'll
[2:09:33] give I'll give one testimony brother
[2:09:35] Rome was talking
[2:09:36] about smoking cigarettes and uh there
[2:09:40] was a lady that called she when I was in
[2:09:43] the ministry in
[2:09:45] Jeffersonville and she had uh she had
[2:09:49] lost her son was strung out on
[2:09:54] drugs her husband had left
[2:09:56] her and she was getting kicked out of
[2:10:00] her house and she was standing on a
[2:10:02] street
[2:10:03] corner and she didn't know what to do
[2:10:05] and she was just crying her eyes out and
[2:10:09] someone walked up to her and gave her a
[2:10:12] little
[2:10:15] card and
[2:10:17] uh I forgot what it said on the front of
[2:10:20] it but on the back it said it had our
[2:10:24] phone number on there and she didn't
[2:10:27] even read what the card said she turned
[2:10:30] it over she dialed the
[2:10:32] number and then the secretary gave the
[2:10:36] the um call to me and she was just
[2:10:40] distraught and crying and we we prayed
[2:10:44] together and uh she and I said well how
[2:10:47] long you you have in your house we we'll
[2:10:49] pray and she says well I've got a a few

[2:10:53] out so we we had prayer and I said can I

[2:11:00] encourage you and I sent her a couple
[2:11:05] sermons and she called back a couple
[2:11:08] weeks later she says she says um she
[2:11:12] says Mr Evans she says I just want you
[2:11:14] to know that

[2:13:44] she said right she said life
[2:13:46] story she said I listen listen to that
[2:13:49] sermon she said and
[2:13:53] as William
[2:13:55] Bram was preaching and giving his
[2:13:58] testimony she said that he was out on a
[2:14:01] date with a
[2:14:02] girl and he said he just loved her and
[2:14:06] and and he called her I think she said
[2:14:07] he called her his little
[2:14:10] Dove and and then she was the she was he
[2:14:13] just thought the world of this girl and
[2:14:16] he said that the girl girl lit up a
[2:14:21] cigarette and she said I could tell how
[2:14:25] much that disgusted brother
[2:14:28] brandom and she said from that moment on
[2:14:33] she said even the smell of cigarettes
[2:14:37] disgusts me and she said I didn't want
[2:14:39] to tell you until the one year
[2:14:42] anniversary is passed but now I want to
[2:14:44] tell you that the Lord delivered me from
[2:14:47] smoking and I have haven't had another
[2:14:49] desire ever and I I talked to her just
[2:14:51] before I left Jeffersonville I said did
[2:14:53] that ever come back she says never so
[2:14:56] the Lord
[2:15:00] delivers God bless you
[2:15:02] [Applause]
[2:15:06] sisters I just want to share a couple of
[2:15:09] hopefully short testimonies um I grew up
[2:15:12] in this church in these pews that you're
[2:15:14] sitting in and I came to the Lord I had
[2:15:18] experience when I was 13 I was baptized
[2:15:20] at the age of 13 but and while I
[2:15:22] remember that experience very well it's
[2:15:24] been over the years uh time and time
[2:15:28] again um where God has been so faithful
[2:15:30] to
[2:15:32] me um just so many so many things that
[2:15:35] he's just been so good but one of the
[2:15:38] more recent times was um as most of you
[2:15:40] know my sister passed away a couple of
[2:15:41] years ago and it was very
[2:15:45] sudden but the Lord was so gentle still
[2:15:48] with me just holding me and loving me
[2:15:53] through the hardest time I've ever had
[2:15:54] in my
[2:15:57] life and I will remember that till he
[2:16:01] comes for me just how precious I felt
[2:16:06] being held by him in such a difficult
[2:16:09] time um and then another recent
[2:16:12] testimony This was um just a few months
[2:16:16] ago um well probably at the start of the
[2:16:19] year but I had been dealing with pretty
[2:16:21] severe pain in my left hip um for more
[2:16:24] than a year it was um debilitating I
[2:16:28] found myself suffering a lot not being
[2:16:30] able to do just regular daily activities
[2:16:32] and i' been to the doctors I'd been to
[2:16:34] the chiropractor I was on had taken
[2:16:35] medications I tried everything and uh
[2:16:38] one service out in Pennsylvania we had a
[2:16:41] brother come and preach for us and I
[2:16:44] went up for prayer and it was and it was
[2:16:47] definitely the Lord I just had this
[2:16:49] decisiveness in my mind that I knew I
[2:16:51] was going up to get prayed for and I was
[2:16:53] going to be delivered from this and I
[2:16:56] went up there I was prayed for and I was
[2:16:58] delivered from that pain so God is
[2:17:02] [Applause]
[2:17:09] [Music]
[2:17:16] good
[2:17:17] [Music]

[2:33:59] would come to
[2:34:01] close as brother Ron's
[2:34:05] [Music]
[2:34:07] coming think about these testimonies
[2:34:09] that we've heard tonight in these songs
[2:34:10] of
[2:34:13] praise made me think of this
[2:34:17] the Apostle Paul I talked about a
[2:34:20] simulator in a fighter pilot the Apostle
[2:34:23] Paul was a true fighter pilot he knew
[2:34:26] how it was to take off and to fly in the
[2:34:29] skies the Apostle Paul says
[2:34:33] this nay in all
[2:34:36] things nay in all these things we are
[2:34:39] more than conquerors through him that
[2:34:41] loved
[2:34:43] us for I am persuaded
[2:34:47] that neither death nor
[2:34:49] life nor angels nor principalities nor
[2:34:52] powers nor things present nor things to
[2:34:56] come nor height nor depth nor any other
[2:35:00] creature shall be able to separate us
[2:35:04] from the love of God which is in Christ
[2:35:08] Jesus our lord amen I promise and we can
[2:35:14] testify sing and I just friends I love
[2:35:17] it thank you so much for
[2:35:20] everyone
[2:35:22] that took courage to take the microphone
[2:35:26] and sing praises to our Lord and give
[2:35:30] testimonies of his goodness let's bow
[2:35:31] our heads brother Ron if You'
[2:35:38] come neither Heights nor depth nor any
[2:35:40] other creature shall be able to separate
[2:35:42] us from the love of God which is incred
[2:35:46] Christ Jesus our
[2:35:48] [Music]
[2:35:53] lord like brother Dan said we all have a
[2:35:57] testimony I I kind of reluctant because
[2:35:59] mine runs long it starts with the day I
[2:36:02] was born I know you don't have 69 years
[2:36:05] to listen to this amen but so many times
[2:36:10] this is for those that that fail and
[2:36:12] Satan pushes you down and tries to keep
[2:36:14] you down
[2:36:17] say well I'm not
[2:36:20] worthy Paul said if we
[2:36:23] suffer we shall also reign with him amen
[2:36:26] if we deny him he also will deny us but
[2:36:31] that's not enough that's not the end of
[2:36:34] it if we believe
[2:36:37] not yet he abideth faithful amen thank
[2:36:42] God he cannot deny
[2:36:44] himself
[2:36:46] am the Revelation is once you realize
[2:36:49] who you are you don't let your failures
[2:36:52] keep you down because he's called you
[2:36:55] and he'll make a way for you amen and
[2:36:59] it's it's it's a hard life it's not easy
[2:37:02] if it was easy anybody could do it I so
[2:37:06] enjoyed these testimonies and each and
[2:37:08] every one
[2:37:10] and the camp wow I wasn't there but I
[2:37:13] did go to another camp
[2:37:16] and up in Mount Lemon and I must say
[2:37:18] that the last
[2:37:21] night the Lord many had left and there
[2:37:24] were some of us left and the Lord came
[2:37:27] down and I have to say for the little
[2:37:30] group that was in a I don't know what
[2:37:32] room it was it was next to the place
[2:37:35] where we ate but we all gathered in
[2:37:37] there there maybe been 15 or 20 of us
[2:37:40] and things started happening you know
[2:37:42] how the Bible talks that wave after wave
[2:37:45] glory after Glory
[2:37:46] glory and I
[2:37:50] experienced the love of
[2:37:54] God it's undescribable yes
[2:37:58] amen and I've had moments since where I
[2:38:01] felt it but it's real
[2:38:05] amen and I was sitting there
[2:38:08] thinking a thought
[2:38:11] that be nice to me because you know I
[2:38:14] just realized my dad dad my father is
[2:38:17] the
[2:38:18] king amen be nice to me and I'll say
[2:38:21] nice things to him about you amen that's
[2:38:24] not all of
[2:38:26] it he said you got
[2:38:28] family I think the same way about them
[2:38:31] as I think about
[2:38:34] you when I Sister
[2:38:38] Sarah if I
[2:38:40] could if I could my heart
[2:38:43] breaks when I hear you s suffer I
[2:38:47] suffer if I could
[2:38:50] sister I would make you well we you
[2:38:53] don't know why we do what we do we don't
[2:38:56] know why God he carries us through but I
[2:38:59] love your attitude sister amen thank you
[2:39:02] for that thank
[2:39:08] you we don't need to feel sorry for
[2:39:10] ourselves or pity ourselves our father
[2:39:13] is the king yes amen
[2:39:16] one
[2:39:17] day one day we'll get these new
[2:39:22] bodies we won't fail ourselves anymore
[2:39:25] of each
[2:39:27] other just for a
[2:39:30] moment this would be a check is there
[2:39:33] anybody in this room that you would not
[2:39:35] want to see on the other
[2:39:38] side if you can't say I want to see
[2:39:41] everybody then you need to be at this
[2:39:44] altar there's no one person here that I
[2:39:47] don't and those were here this morning
[2:39:50] those that I've
[2:39:52] known I think that's how Jesus felt he
[2:39:56] died for the whole world not everybody
[2:39:59] accepted
[2:40:00] him but I believe I'm in the midst of a
[2:40:03] group that
[2:40:05] has and I I thank you for your
[2:40:09] testimonies amen can we pray oh
[2:40:14] god look down upon our hearts Lord Jesus

[2:40:25] enough forgive us for lord your love is
[2:40:29] it is
[2:40:30] unexplainable but Lord you loved us so
[2:40:33] much you provided the circumstance to
[2:40:35] show us by your death on
[2:40:38] Calvary and how Satan is pulled and
[2:40:41] tugged and try to pull us down but Lord
[2:40:45] Lord you
[2:40:46] miraculously you come and remind us of
[2:40:50] who we are and we're so glad that we're
[2:40:54] so happy tonight Lord Jesus that we know

[2:41:11] to believe and and when Lord we we fail
