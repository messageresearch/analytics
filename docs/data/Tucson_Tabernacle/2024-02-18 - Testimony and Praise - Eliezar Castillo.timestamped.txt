[15:08] all the way to the front
[15:10] [Music]
[15:27] man
[15:30] [Music]
[15:35] amen welcome home yes amen welcome
[15:39] home good to see everyone this evening
[15:42] we sure look forward to what the Lord
[15:44] has in store this evening for the church
[15:45] here and heard many great testimonies
[15:48] through the year of what God has done
[15:49] here at the Tabernacle and just
[15:52] to just to say I'm very very very happy
[15:56] to see what God has done and what God
[15:58] has still still doing and what he's yet
[15:59] going to do for this next year through
[16:02] our brother here and through the church
[16:03] so I say let's just put our shoulders to
[16:06] the will and continue to press the
[16:07] battle until the coming of the Lord and
[16:09] realize we're almost home amen amen
[16:12] we're almost home so we just greet you
[16:14] tonight and we're glad to be here happy
[16:17] to be among family among friends and you
[16:19] know the occasion here that we're here
[16:21] for is a sadden occasion but yet as we
[16:24] saw this morning I believe uh Connie
[16:27] gave her heart to the Lord so we we
[16:29] honor that because God can take some
[16:31] things that are tough and make Beauty
[16:33] out of ashes and I believe he's still
[16:35] doing that what may look like a terrible
[16:37] situation yet God can glean a life and a
[16:40] soul from it and you that's what we're
[16:42] trusting we don't know the the mind of
[16:44] God in that aspect but we trust that
[16:46] he's able and he did what he came to do
[16:49] and I just believe God's going to be in
[16:52] in this service for us tonight so we
[16:54] just want to let's just bow before him
[16:55] and pray now
[16:57] father Lord it is an honor to just be

[18:14] church tell
[18:16] you there's been a lot of blessings that
[18:19] I've received from being at this church
[18:23] and uh not the least of those is the
[18:25] friendship that I've developed with that
[18:28] man right there he's been a blessing to
[18:30] me and and now getting to know his
[18:32] family um he's a true minister of the
[18:35] Gospel his heart's in the right place
[18:38] and uh I'm standing shoulder toosh
[18:40] shoulder with you man we're going to get
[18:42] this job
[18:44] done while uh while we're standing let's
[18:47] open up our Bibles to the
[18:49] Psalms and uh let's turn to Psalm
[18:57] 40 asked uh little Elijah which one did
[19:00] he want me to read out of Psalms or
[19:03] Mark and he he said he said Mark so
[19:10] we're we're gonna read out of both is
[19:11] that okay Elijah is that all right with
[19:13] you brother all right Psalm
[19:15] 40
[19:18] um verse 9 says
[19:22] this I have preached righteousness in
[19:25] the great congregation lo I have not
[19:28] refrain my lips oh Lord thou knowest I
[19:30] have not hid thy righteousness within my
[19:33] heart I have declared thy faithfulness
[19:35] and thy salvation I have not concealed
[19:38] thy loving kindness and thy truth from
[19:41] the great
[19:42] congregation amen obviously that
[19:46] scripture is talking about testimony and
[19:49] and let's let's move to uh The Book of
[19:53] Mark and um this is a familiar story
[19:57] let's turn to mark 5: 19 and it says
[20:01] this and I'll give a little explanation
[20:03] of what's going on here after I read
[20:05] this read the Scripture it says
[20:08] this it says how be
[20:11] it Jesus suffered him not but saith unto
[20:15] him go home to thy friends and tell them
[20:18] how great things the Lord hath done for
[20:20] thee and hath had compassion on thee
[20:24] amen you can you can take your
[20:27] seats so Lord Jesus when he said
[20:31] that he was
[20:33] talking to what we call the
[20:37] maniac of gadera or
[20:40] Legion and what happened is Jesus had
[20:43] count casted the spirits out of him they
[20:46] went into the swine the swine went off a
[20:48] cliff and killed themselves and then
[20:51] Jesus was he was in his right mind and
[20:54] he came before the Lord and Jesus
[20:57] instructs him go
[20:59] tell people what happened to you and the
[21:03] greatest testimony the greatest thing
[21:05] the greatest witnessing tool that we
[21:06] have brothers and sisters is our ability
[21:11] to tell what the Lord's done in our
[21:15] lives and um I'd like to give a
[21:17] testimony brother Jordan I'm going to
[21:19] switch to my lapel mic
[21:23] here I'll give a testimony I want to
[21:26] have brother Paul get ready and we're
[21:28] we're going to start this service off
[21:30] with um with a a pretty incredible
[21:33] testimony a pretty
[21:37] um incredible thing that happened to
[21:40] brother Paul and I'll preface it with uh
[21:45] a few Services ago as a Sunday morning I
[21:48] was um I was
[21:50] ministering
[21:52] and I
[21:54] felt to go down and I like to when I
[21:58] pray a lot of times I'll like to go down
[22:01] on this this area right here so I'm a
[22:04] little bit closer with the
[22:06] congregation and as I walked
[22:09] down I got down to a place right about
[22:14] here and I had a very very odd
[22:18] feeling I
[22:20] walked and I felt like there was someone
[22:24] right here and I even looked it startled
[22:27] me and I I looked and there was no one
[22:29] there I didn't have this a great
[22:30] sensation I didn't have didn't feel that
[22:33] there was a lot of power there I just
[22:36] felt like there was someone standing
[22:38] there and I came
[22:41] down and we prayed with the congregation
[22:45] right here brother Paul come on up I we
[22:48] prayed with the
[22:49] congregation um right here and
[22:53] then uh we dismissed
[22:55] service and I went out where I usually
[22:59] go and um was was fellowshipping with
[23:03] the
[23:04] people and brother Paul meets me right
[23:07] over
[23:08] here and he tells me he says um can I
[23:13] can I talk to you for a minute I had
[23:15] something very odd happened to me and I
[23:19] said I said sure So brother Paul and uh
[23:22] and I we we go off by
[23:25] ourselves and uh
[23:28] he
[23:29] said he told me the testimony of
[23:32] something that he
[23:35] saw and I told him I said brother Paul
[23:40] was it when I stepped down the
[23:45] stairs and brother Paul looked at me a
[23:48] little bit startled he said that's
[23:49] exactly when it happened so now I'd like
[23:52] to now that I've laid a foundation did I
[23:54] tell
[23:55] everything right okay so I'd like to
[24:00] turn it over to brother Paul and then he
[24:02] can give the testimony of of what he
[24:05] saw let me get my notes
[24:11] Here can everybody hear me
[24:14] okay
[24:16] um do we have that that video
[24:20] available you want to go ahead and get
[24:23] that ready um so what I told Brother
[24:27] Daniel was that
[24:29] um I I saw when we were all worshiping
[24:32] at that
[24:33] moment and
[24:36] uh after I think it was after this the
[24:39] worship was over I I I opened my eyes
[24:42] and I saw brother Daniel down here on
[24:44] this lower platform and I thought that
[24:46] was odd but prior to that I had seen a
[24:50] man a small man in white robes and
[24:55] shoulder length hair walk up to the
[24:57] middle
[24:58] platform
[25:01] and I didn't I didn't feel I mean it was
[25:04] there was a wonderful presence during
[25:06] that worship but it wasn't in seeing
[25:08] that that I felt some real real powerful
[25:11] anointing con to confirm that it was our
[25:14] Lord but that's what I thought when I
[25:16] saw him so when brother Daniel um and I
[25:20] spoke um I think it was later that day
[25:24] or probably the the day after he sent me
[25:27] the link
[25:28] to to the video um from that service and
[25:32] I just I think we saw as kind of a
[25:34] confirmation as well um that something
[25:38] definitely took place but if you want to
[25:40] go ahead and play that just I wish I
[25:44] wish we could I could say that we're
[25:46] going to see a supernatural image of the
[25:49] Lord but
[25:50] amen do you feel good about what he's
[25:52] done for you let's go ahead and back up
[25:56] family just a little bit
[25:58] done but notice how he he skip the video
[26:02] skips we don't know exactly what
[26:04] happened but he the video there's a skip
[26:07] some some Gap in
[26:11] there and it happened right around the
[26:13] same
[26:15] time I'll add a little bit to it so
[26:19] brother Paul tells me this and I I said
[26:21] you know I said you know what happened
[26:22] is I felt this like there was somebody
[26:25] there so it got me thinking
[26:28] so I said you know I'll go back to the
[26:31] video and look at it and I scrubbed all
[26:34] the way to this point right here and I
[26:38] said okay this is this is when it was
[26:40] happening and I was going to watch my
[26:41] body language because I jerked um I
[26:45] could when when it happened I jerked
[26:47] like there was somebody standing there
[26:49] because it's it kind of startled me so I
[26:52] was looking for
[26:54] that and I really believe that
[26:58] whatever it was there did not want to be
[27:01] photographed it didn't want to um didn't
[27:05] want to be shown but what Watch What
[27:08] Happens and this has never happened
[27:09] brother Jordan I don't know of any time
[27:11] that we've ever had a video that just
[27:13] stopped for a few seconds and then
[27:15] started again but watch
[27:21] [Music]
[27:26] this
[27:29] amen do you feel good about what he's
[27:31] done for you your
[27:36] family what he's done from the beginning
[27:39] of
[27:40] time so I took that as a
[27:44] confirmation um I have never I I've had
[27:49] experiences where I have seen things but
[27:52] I've never seen the Lord like that
[27:54] before um and that was a
[27:58] that was definitely a very um very
[28:01] powerful service for me and I I feel it
[28:04] was a
[28:05] confirmation uh that we were we're all
[28:07] on the WR the right path amen and uh God
[28:13] has been teaching me um through this all
[28:17] uh a lot of patience because I I feel
[28:20] like we all maybe have different
[28:22] expectations and we want to see things
[28:24] happen a little quicker but God is right
[28:27] on time amen and
[28:30] uh anyway so a couple of weeks after
[28:34] this
[28:35] experience um I had something else
[28:39] happen and
[28:42] uh I like I like to write I like to
[28:45] write down um whenever the Lord is
[28:49] showing me
[28:50] stuff
[28:52] and I I felt impressed I had been
[28:55] feeling impressed for about a week last
[28:57] week um or prior to that to just really
[29:01] uh take the time to write this burden
[29:04] out that was on my heart and
[29:07] uh I finally wrote it out and that
[29:12] particular day um that particular
[29:14] weekend um the the enemy was really
[29:17] attacking me and so Sunday I had to to
[29:19] stream in because I was I didn't want to
[29:22] bring any sickness among you all and uh
[29:25] I was so excited after the message was
[29:27] preached because I so I had to call
[29:30] Brother Dan and I said hey I'm going to
[29:32] send you an email um I think I got part
[29:36] two so I sent him the email and
[29:41] uh after he read it he asked me if I
[29:44] wouldn't mind sharing it
[29:46] so um as most of you all know this is
[29:50] not a my favorite spot to be I'd rather
[29:53] be where you're at listening to someone
[29:55] share their testimony but um I don't
[29:57] like to have just like the rest of you
[29:59] we don't like to have the the spotlight
[30:02] but uh so so Lord willing um I'm going
[30:06] to share this with you but uh just ask
[30:10] for your prayers help me to get read
[30:14] this uh in such a way that um it will be
[30:16] anointed because I don't just want to
[30:18] share some notes right I I want it to be
[30:23] um given to you and the spirit was given
[30:25] to me um but I I titled it Discerning
[30:28] the Lord's body and showing
[30:31] you by and by you'll understand why I
[30:34] showed you this stuff the video and the
[30:37] earlier
[30:39] testimony not long ago brother Dan
[30:41] shared a story of Zachariah father of
[30:44] John the Baptist being told by the angel
[30:47] that his prayer had been heard it was an
[30:49] old prayer likely prayed so long ago
[30:52] that had been accepted as a no Zachariah
[30:55] had made a request so long ago ago that
[30:57] he had forgotten all about it but God
[30:59] had not he had a timing that was
[31:02] absolutely perfect and now was time for
[31:04] the greatest Prophet to ever live to be
[31:07] born in that very moment when brother
[31:09] Dan was
[31:11] sharing that story I felt a striking
[31:13] Sensation that put put a fire in my
[31:15] heart as if the Lord was telling me that
[31:18] a prayer that I'd forgotten all about
[31:19] would soon be answered my only question
[31:22] was what prayer so with great anti
[31:26] anticipation I waited
[31:28] a week or so later it happened while in
[31:30] church suddenly I saw the Lord Jesus and
[31:33] his people not anyone specifically but
[31:36] like a blanket that covered all I'm not
[31:38] entirely sure how to describe what I saw
[31:41] but that old prayer from a very long
[31:44] time ago was concerning foot
[31:46] washing over 24 years ago IID earnestly
[31:49] and fervently asked for a deeper
[31:51] understanding in Revelation of what
[31:52] Jesus was asking us to do to one another
[31:55] at the time like most most students of
[31:57] scripture I could give you the right
[31:58] answer but knowing the answer and having
[32:01] it drop 18 in into the holy of holies
[32:04] are to entirely different
[32:07] things um in
[32:11] addition what I saw was sort of also um
[32:15] later on it struck me when the prophet
[32:17] talked about how he had seen the veil of
[32:20] blood that he described it in one one
[32:23] sense as being a rainbow I didn't see I
[32:26] didn't see my brothers and sisters I saw
[32:28] Christ amen and I have to tell you that
[32:31] it has it has really transformed my
[32:33] attitude towards you I I have I have a
[32:36] deeper uh longing to serve you um and
[32:41] not just my fellow brothers but I've
[32:44] always for for the longest time I've had
[32:46] a burden for people outside our four
[32:50] walls I I want I want to to share Christ
[32:53] in this awesome gospel with the world
[32:58] but
[33:00] it's I was amazed and humbled at what I
[33:03] saw it was the Lord Jesus and his people
[33:06] a beautiful spotless pure woman the
[33:08] Bride of Jesus Christ I felt such a
[33:10] mixture of feelings but overall I wanted
[33:12] to honor and serve the Lord and his
[33:14] people the scene comes to mind where
[33:16] Jesus spoke to Saul asking why
[33:18] persecutest thou me prior to that moment
[33:21] I supposed that I wasn't exactly a
[33:23] Critic of the body but I also wasn't a
[33:25] huge fan I hate to say it but I honestly
[33:28] haven't been viewing her through the
[33:29] blood and that's not something you just
[33:31] muster up either you have it or you
[33:33] don't and if I'm totally honest I don't
[33:36] I know that I had to do some repenting
[33:39] for not Discerning the Lord's body I
[33:41] wasn't serving her like I should have
[33:44] not long ago my heart was just longing
[33:46] for a renewal of the joy of my salvation
[33:48] my eagle eyes had been filmed over I
[33:50] wasn't lost but my joy was a week or two
[33:54] after having asked that prayer it
[33:55] happened Joy struck my heart as I saw
[33:57] the amazing grace of our Lord Jesus
[33:59] Christ it suddenly became fresh again
[34:02] the only sin Jesus had was ours and the
[34:05] only righteousness we have is his yes
[34:08] amen a w toer what a beautiful wonderful
[34:12] gift when you see it you don't just see
[34:14] it for yourself you see it for all John
[34:18] was in heaven when he wept with profound
[34:20] sorrow because no man was found worthy
[34:22] to open and read the book neither to
[34:24] look thereon we know where he was but
[34:26] when was did this take place I don't
[34:29] know for certain where this moment fits
[34:31] in time but I have to imagine this is
[34:33] where we were the lamb slain before the
[34:35] foundations of the world before the Plan
[34:38] of Salvation was unveiled we know John
[34:41] wept because none of us were good enough
[34:43] but for the longest time I didn't
[34:45] understand just did John somehow forget
[34:48] the cross the
[34:49] Resurrection the Ascension of our Lord
[34:52] Jesus could it be possible he was there
[34:54] before the foundations of the world
[34:56] seeing the plan unfold seeing that no
[34:58] amount of consecration prayer devotion
[35:01] speaking in tongues dancing in the
[35:02] spirit adherence to dress codes rules
[35:05] dreams Visions Miracles or holy living
[35:07] was acceptable not by a million miles I
[35:11] think John was where we all must come a
[35:14] place of utter Despair and knowledge of
[35:16] being lost you simply must know that you
[35:21] are and to totally and completely lost
[35:23] before you can be
[35:25] saved one of the Elders said unto me
[35:28] weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[35:30] Judah the root of David hath prevailed
[35:33] to open the book and to loose the Seven
[35:34] Seals thereof John and the rest of the
[35:37] Heavenly hosts went went from weeping
[35:39] and despair to the most powerful worship
[35:41] service you ever
[35:43] witnessed Salva salvation produces Joy
[35:46] pure and simple and if Grace isn't
[35:49] amazing if Grace isn't so amazing that
[35:52] you you see hope and salvation is
[35:54] offered to any and all perhaps you've
[35:56] become a modern leodan Pharisee you
[35:59] can't sit in the seat of the scornful
[36:01] and the seat of Grace at the same time
[36:03] it just isn't possible either you're
[36:06] sitting next to the accuser of the
[36:08] Brethren or the Merciful Savior a few
[36:11] days
[36:12] later after this experience Jesus opened
[36:15] my eyes of understanding a little more
[36:18] he let me know that foot washing was
[36:20] also found in scripture in the form of
[36:21] an
[36:22] allegory my mind excitedly raised as I
[36:25] searched my heart for something
[36:26] something I couldn't think of anything
[36:29] as I but I couldn't think of anything I
[36:31] was about to search the scriptures to
[36:33] see what it had to say about feet when
[36:35] suddenly I saw the woman with the
[36:36] alabaster box she washed the feet of our
[36:40] precious Lord Jesus with her tears and
[36:42] anointed him with a very costly ointment
[36:45] and this infuriated the self-righteous
[36:47] Pharisees this man if he were a prophet
[36:50] would have known what manner of woman
[36:52] this is that toucheth him for she is a
[36:54] sinner the Pharisees always very quick
[36:57] to find fault they're expert fruit
[36:59] inspectors but Jesus never told us to be
[37:02] professional spec finders Jesus said
[37:04] Beware of false prophets amen which come
[37:07] to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly
[37:09] they're ra raving
[37:11] wolves you shall know them by their
[37:14] fruits in another place Jesus said take
[37:16] heed and Beware of the leaven of the
[37:18] Pharisees and the Sadducees the
[37:20] disciples thought he was talking about
[37:22] the actual bread until finally they
[37:24] understood that he B them not be wear of
[37:27] the leaven of the bread but of the
[37:29] doctrine of the Pharisees and the
[37:30] Sadducees we are to know the voice of
[37:33] the great Shepherd so well that when
[37:35] that we will not follow after the
[37:40] thief Jesus answering and said to him
[37:42] unto him Simon I have somewhat to say
[37:46] unto thee and he said sayth sayith on
[37:50] Master there was a certain creditor
[37:53] which had two debtors the one owed 500 p
[37:56] and the other 50 and when they had
[37:57] nothing to pay he frankly forgave them
[38:00] both tell me therefore which one of them
[38:02] will love him most Simon answered and
[38:05] said I suppose that he to whom he
[38:07] forgave most he said unto him thou Hast
[38:11] rightly judged and he turned to the
[38:13] woman and said unto Simon seest thou
[38:15] this woman I entered into thine house
[38:18] thou gavest me no food or no water for
[38:20] my feet but thou Hast washed but she
[38:23] hath washed my feet with her tears and
[38:25] wiped them with the hairs of her head
[38:27] thou gavest me no kiss but this woman
[38:29] says the time I came in hath not ceased
[38:31] to kiss my feet my head with oil thou
[38:35] didst not anoint but this woman hath
[38:37] anointed my feet with ointment therefore
[38:40] I say unto thee her sins which are many
[38:42] are
[38:42] forgiven for she loved much but to whom
[38:46] little Is Forgiven the same loveth
[38:49] little and he said unto her thy sins are
[38:52] forgiven for he that eateth and drinketh
[38:55] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[38:57] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[39:00] body taking the wine and the bread is
[39:03] for ourselves but foot washing is for
[39:05] others foot washing is loving and
[39:08] honoring and serving Jesus Christ in the
[39:10] body and we see this beautifully
[39:13] Illustrated in the scene as said so many
[39:16] times before you can't help someone
[39:17] until you help yourself and I have a a
[39:20] picture here of the mask that drops down
[39:23] in the aircraft the so many of us have
[39:27] seen Grace is only amazing if you were
[39:30] First lost but now oh my now you are
[39:33] found notice how Jesus highlights that
[39:36] the volume of your love for Christ the
[39:39] body is a direct reflection of the grace
[39:41] we have receiv received you love and
[39:44] live for others because you have been
[39:46] loved and accepted by Jesus Christ by
[39:49] this shall all men know that you are my
[39:51] disciples if you have love one to
[39:53] another and the story of the woman with
[39:55] the alabaster box we see a sinner the
[39:57] church the body of Christ washing the
[39:59] feet of Jesus the reality of our sinful
[40:02] past and the need for Mercy is vivid but
[40:05] even more so is the reality of his M His
[40:07] Amazing Grace we members of the body of
[40:10] Jesus Christ are not dis delusional or
[40:13] self-righteous we know what a Wretched
[40:15] Man that I am however we also we are
[40:19] also very much aware that this free gift
[40:22] was not merited and it's for all who
[40:24] choose to believe we wash the feet of
[40:27] the Saints in loneliness of Mind as we
[40:29] esteem other better than
[40:32] ourselves do you see it the body of
[40:34] Jesus Christ the church being displayed
[40:37] right before the dead critical scornful
[40:40] Pharisees the one doesn't make Jesus or
[40:43] the woman feel equal accepted or loved
[40:45] zero Hospitality or warmth they had
[40:48] fellowship with their own because they
[40:50] were definitely not going to rub
[40:51] shoulders with that lower class of
[40:53] people we know who they are we know
[40:55] they're fre FR they we we have standards
[40:58] and they don't can you see the Publican
[41:01] who would not lift up so much his eyes
[41:03] unto heaven but smoted his breath saying
[41:06] God be merciful to me a sinner in stark
[41:09] contrast we see the Pharisee in both
[41:10] stories as having a hottie judgy
[41:13] attitude clearly seeing himself is much
[41:15] better than these vile Sinners saying
[41:18] within themselves I am rich and
[41:20] increased with goods and have need of
[41:21] nothing but Jesus had another testimony
[41:24] of them the publican walked away
[41:26] Justified the woman was forgiven but the
[41:29] Pharisee of the Pharisee Jesus says
[41:31] knowest Thou not that thou art wretched
[41:33] miserable poor and blind and naked I
[41:36] counsel thee to be to buy of me gold
[41:39] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[41:40] rich and white rment that thou mayest be
[41:44] clothed and that the shame of thy
[41:46] nakedness do not appear and anoint thy
[41:48] knives with Isa that thou may
[41:52] see when we see this glorious gift of
[41:55] Salvation by Amazing Grace has a
[41:57] tremendous effect on our attitudes
[42:00] towards others when I first got it I was
[42:02] in church filled with the Holy Spirit
[42:04] and at that moment I thought everyone
[42:05] was experiencing what I was experiencing
[42:08] I thought I was surrounded by angels and
[42:10] guess what I
[42:12] was I was surrounded and filled with
[42:15] Amazing Grace but the test comes when
[42:17] the rubber meets the road and we fail
[42:19] and others fail this is where the seed
[42:22] proves what kind of ground it's in and
[42:24] unfortunately many people are a
[42:26] offended and they see a prostitute a
[42:29] dirty low down and worthless failure the
[42:32] joy of their salvation is gone and
[42:35] bitterness has taken root apathy
[42:37] criticism a lack of enthusiasm and
[42:40] appreciation for others sets in they're
[42:43] not going to serve
[42:45] anyone many are not Discerning the
[42:48] Lord's body as many as I love are rebuke
[42:51] and chasen be zealous therefore and
[42:53] repent amen so what what are we
[42:56] repenting of as we have therefore
[42:59] opportunity let us do good unto all men
[43:02] especially them who are the household of
[43:05] faith amazing to see how this is is
[43:08] being written this all came to me in a
[43:10] matter of seconds but writing it seems
[43:13] so archaic and primitive it's taking way
[43:15] too long if only I could put my thought
[43:18] directly into your mind it would save a
[43:20] lot of time but here's the next piece of
[43:22] the picture and it's literally a picture
[43:31] this is uh forgive
[43:33] my artistic crudeness here but
[43:37] originally when I I drew this picture it
[43:39] was intended to I I was I was wanting to
[43:42] do a children's book that would
[43:45] illustrate salvation in a very simple
[43:48] way and I heard my son Elijah talking
[43:52] about a rock star um that obviously had
[43:56] gotten some thoughts or ideas from
[43:59] school and so here in this image you see
[44:02] um that Fountain is a
[44:04] representation uh of the Manifest
[44:07] presence of God in in heaven and this is
[44:10] the moment where
[44:12] [Music]
[44:13] Satan decides that he's more attractive
[44:17] than God is that all the Angels should
[44:20] follow after him so you see the
[44:22] disapproving angels and you see those
[44:25] that are
[44:26] caught up under Satan's anointing and I
[44:29] have to admit that almost every time I
[44:31] see this it has a a really profound
[44:35] impact on me that I can't put into words
[44:39] um I
[44:41] see how terrifying and how horrific it
[44:45] is that in the very presence of God I
[44:47] mean we can't even imagine how awesome
[44:50] it would have been or would be I mean
[44:52] right now there Holy Angels worshiping
[44:55] God
[44:56] um in a presence that we can't even
[44:58] fathom or imagine and yet in that
[45:00] awesome holy presence Satan decided that
[45:04] he was the man of the
[45:07] hour it's not about you if I could title
[45:12] that image that's what it would be t uh
[45:14] titled it's not about you thine heart
[45:17] was lifted up because of thy Beauty th
[45:20] thou Hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason
[45:21] of thy brightness I will cast thee to
[45:24] the ground I will lay thee before kings
[45:26] that they may behold thee a a couple
[45:29] years ago I wanted to try and
[45:31] express I wanted to put together a
[45:33] children's story that would plainly show
[45:35] the path of Salvation I wanted to start
[45:37] by showing the fall in heaven and
[45:39] although the sketch is crued contains a
[45:41] powerful
[45:42] message we see the moment where loose
[45:44] forf the Manifest presence of God is
[45:47] represented as a Fountain of Living
[45:48] Water I apologize for repeating but
[45:52] right there in the Holy
[45:54] sanctuary of the most high Satan takes
[45:56] the attention off of God places it on
[45:58] himself he became the main attraction he
[46:01] robbed God's platform and Satan became
[46:04] the main character in his delusion in
[46:06] his delusional fantasy his Fake Make
[46:08] Believe Hollywood movie everyone else
[46:11] including God became supporting actors
[46:13] or even worse yet extras living props
[46:16] there to just fill the space we can see
[46:19] the angels that are following Satan and
[46:21] those who disapprove but how does this
[46:23] fit into Discerning the Lord's body how
[46:25] does it apply to foot washing regardless
[46:28] of the role or part we play preacher
[46:30] song leader deacons praying or even
[46:34] something is simply greeting one another
[46:35] in the church we are not the celebrity
[46:38] we are not the star or the main
[46:40] attraction Jesus Christ is and if Grace
[46:43] is still amazing you see Christ when you
[46:45] see others it's not about you it's not
[46:48] about me we need to realize that whether
[46:51] we are shy awkward or reserved or
[46:53] extremely confident that's the results
[46:55] of being being
[46:56] self-conscious but but guess what you're
[46:59] not that important it's not about
[47:02] you recognize whose presence you're in
[47:05] and honor love and serve him in his
[47:08] people apply the same Grace over others
[47:10] that you see in yourself without even
[47:12] trying you already are your attitude
[47:15] towards others is your attitude towards
[47:17] Christ evaluate your reflection what do
[47:20] you see if you see if you don't see
[47:22] Amazing Grace you'll see something else
[47:25] and your story will be very similar to
[47:28] Satan's and those miserable religious
[47:29] Pharisees who did not show honor
[47:32] Hospitality or love in the pre to the
[47:34] presence of Jesus Christ what we need
[47:37] and I'm not talk and I'm talking about
[47:38] every single one of us starting with me
[47:41] is a gold oldfashioned heartfelt
[47:43] repentance as many as I love I rebuke
[47:45] and chasen be zealous therefore and
[47:48] repent behold I stand at the door and
[47:50] knock If any man hear my voice and open
[47:53] the door I will come into him and will
[47:56] and will s with him and he with me let's
[47:59] open the door wash his feet and break
[48:01] bread together there's nothing in the
[48:03] world that is greater let Grace become
[48:06] amazing again be surrounded by Angels
[48:09] again we can't work this up or produce
[48:11] it it will take a sovereign move of
[48:14] Jesus Christ that comes from repentance
[48:16] and prayer then going to church won't be
[48:19] a duty worshiping won't be a duty no
[48:21] more than loving your spouse is a duty
[48:23] when this when this first became real to
[48:26] me nobody had to ask bribe or beg me to
[48:28] come to church or raise my hands or
[48:30] worship it was real all we have to do is
[48:33] seek him and you shall seek me and find
[48:36] me and you shall search for me with all
[48:39] your heart when you when you shall
[48:41] search for me with all your
[48:45] heart God bless
[48:50] you amen I think Brother Paul's
[48:54] testimony there can be summed
[48:57] up in this he said he said you must
[49:00] understand that you are completely
[49:02] lost
[49:03] first before you can truly be saved and
[49:08] I know I always say that it's not it's
[49:09] not about you it's not about me and and
[49:13] we are far too important in our own eyes
[49:16] and we should in our own eyes lessen
[49:19] ourself lessen our importance but let me
[49:22] tell you that we are very important to
[49:26] Jesus Christ so much so that he died on
[49:29] the cross for each one of us that's how
[49:32] important we are to him but to us no to
[49:36] ourselves we should lower our importance
[49:41] to ourselves and start serving other
[49:43] people and get people to this Jesus
[49:46] Christ that we
[49:48] preach I uh I did appreciate thank you
[49:51] appreciated that brother Paul um sister
[49:54] hope if you would if you would come
[49:55] forward with a with a testimony and a
[49:58] song
[50:03] um brother Paul was uh we showed that
[50:06] that video and it was it was a I think
[50:08] it was just a it was a confirmation to
[50:11] us that it felt so good we had such a
[50:15] great service and then we I felt the
[50:18] presence up there and then when brother
[50:20] Paul said he saw that Vision or image or
[50:24] or whatever you want to call call it it
[50:27] uh it blessed me but I don't think that
[50:30] that the Lord with social media and the
[50:33] way all things
[50:35] happen I don't think that um he
[50:38] necessarily wants to be photographed
[50:40] like he was in
[50:42] 1950 in a in a picture that couldn't be
[50:46] couldn't be duplicated it couldn't be
[50:48] faked an actual picture of the holy
[50:51] spirit in the pillar of fire over a man
[50:55] and that that picture is the one that we
[51:00] point to and that that picture really
[51:03] happened it was a real thing sister
[51:05] hope um I wanted to share my mom was
[51:08] talking to me yesterday about this
[51:09] brother that the Lord opened his eyes
[51:12] that the Holy Ghost is a
[51:15] person and it struck me
[51:19] because he he came in our hearts when we
[51:23] when he gave us the Holy Ghost
[51:27] but we put him so far away like he's
[51:29] someone we can't
[51:32] see but he's right here in our hearts
[51:35] and if we treat him like he's a person
[51:37] and right here with us we wouldn't
[51:39] believe he wasn't with
[51:41] us but um I
[51:44] just oh my goodness it just really did a
[51:46] lot for me but I was thinking um brother
[51:50] Daniel wanted me to share the testimony
[51:52] of what happened to me when I got snake
[51:53] bit when I was little I was two years
[51:55] old and me and my sister were outside
[51:58] barefoot and by the house and it was up
[52:01] on blocks because my dad built it and we
[52:02] didn't have underpinning and um this a
[52:07] copperhead came out from under the house
[52:10] and bit my foot my sister she was a year
[52:13] older than me and she said o a snake
[52:15] let's move so we scooted back but it
[52:17] came for me anyway and bit my
[52:19] foot and um you know how deadly
[52:22] copperheads can be so my mom was
[52:24] freaking out and and she called my dad
[52:27] at work and had me loaded up in the car
[52:28] but I think it was that Sunday they had
[52:31] listened to perfect
[52:33] faith and my dad Faith Row in his heart
[52:37] and he just knew God was going to heal
[52:38] me so they came home he said we're not
[52:40] going to the hospital we're going to
[52:42] pray for her and so they prayed for me
[52:45] they went and found the snake and killed
[52:46] it and had me watch them bury it so that
[52:48] I knew it was dead and it would never
[52:50] bite me
[52:51] again and like three days later was my
[52:54] oldest sister's fifth birthday party and
[52:56] um they had me
[52:58] like trying to have me sitting down and
[53:01] everything and everyone was saying hope
[53:03] sit down sit down and you know that day
[53:06] I just felt like I had to run I had to
[53:10] run I couldn't help it it was just
[53:14] unbelievable and I ran up and down and
[53:16] up and down the driveway and and finally
[53:18] they got my dad and they said she won't
[53:20] sit down and they were getting upset and
[53:22] he said he noticed it was very unusual
[53:25] so he said he said um let her run so I
[53:30] ran and I ran and I ran and I I don't
[53:33] think I've ever run so much before Ever
[53:37] After but anyway the next morning my
[53:40] store is the craziest my mom said it was
[53:42] just the craziest blue green color and
[53:45] she knew that the Lord had let the
[53:47] poison come out in my stool and I don't
[53:49] even have a scar
[53:51] left our God is the same yesterday today
[53:54] and forever
[54:03] sometimes I think I'm in
[54:08] control and act
[54:12] [Music]
[54:15] soly facing problems on my
[54:21] own I don't know what's best for me

[1:00:37] way that I've been taught you are more
[1:00:39] important than the way that I think
[1:00:41] things should be then you give your
[1:00:45] heart to the Lord and then your battle
[1:00:48] starts and this testimony right here
[1:00:51] brothers and sisters I think that it'll
[1:00:53] be a blessing bling to you our brother
[1:00:56] has had it rough but he's standing
[1:00:59] strong with Jesus
[1:01:06] Christ good good evening everybody
[1:01:09] brothers and sisters
[1:01:11] um yes uh thank you Daniel and I have to
[1:01:16] say brother Daniel brother Paul his
[1:01:20] testimony prepared me for my
[1:01:22] testimony because of course I was you
[1:01:24] know like a little bit nervous and
[1:01:26] everything and I I was going to say of
[1:01:29] course don't look at me look at Jesus he
[1:01:32] is to is the one who who who saved us
[1:01:34] from Eternal damnation from our sins and
[1:01:38] so that helped me so much brother Paul
[1:01:40] when you
[1:01:41] said that it's not about us it's it's
[1:01:43] you know we're not that important I know
[1:01:45] I'm important to Jesus but that helped
[1:01:47] me so um and I don't want to say a few
[1:01:50] words in a in two hours either so I want
[1:01:53] to watch the clock um I talk too much
[1:01:56] sometimes and so but too I have to say
[1:02:01] real quick um I felt the Lord telling me
[1:02:03] to share this this morning and and also
[1:02:06] I wanted to say I'm leaving tonight to
[1:02:07] go home I just don't want to leave
[1:02:09] almost I've been so blessed by this
[1:02:11] Fellowship I'm so glad I came to Tucson
[1:02:13] and stayed here this month and a half
[1:02:16] and so I was reading my Bible this
[1:02:18] morning and I was in I was opening up to
[1:02:23] Psalms I a part of Bible I was reading
[1:02:26] and all at once it was very
[1:02:29] like strange almost like the page I had
[1:02:34] opened the page flipped it was not this
[1:02:35] one was my Bible at home the smaller one
[1:02:37] and it like as a puff of wind and the
[1:02:40] page flipped open to Psalm 122 and I was
[1:02:43] thinking had the door
[1:02:44] open like I do sometimes there at the
[1:02:47] Castro house when it's warm you
[1:02:49] know and because I'm used to the cold up
[1:02:53] home and here here it's warmer and so I
[1:02:57] looked and I was like I was thinking I
[1:02:59] had the door open I didn't so that it I
[1:03:02] felt the wind and I looked at at this
[1:03:05] Psalm and and it was I it was such a
[1:03:07] holy moment I just went on my knees
[1:03:10] because I knew it was God that it was
[1:03:12] Psalm 122 I wanted to read that off
[1:03:14] before I I give my well that's that's
[1:03:18] included in my testimony I guess you
[1:03:20] could say Psalm 122 it
[1:03:23] says
[1:03:25] let us
[1:03:28] go
[1:03:31] here is
[1:03:45] this I guess this is the right
[1:03:50] one yeah I think it would it might be
[1:03:54] brother well I was thinking it was a
[1:03:56] different translation but it's the same
[1:03:57] one the one you told me read it out of
[1:04:00] my book what would that that one is a
[1:04:02] little bit trans a little bit
[1:04:04] different uh there
[1:04:09] something
[1:04:12] okay I guess it's the same but I know it
[1:04:15] was Psalm 122 and now it it says I was
[1:04:18] glad when they said unto me let us go
[1:04:22] into the house of the Lord our feet
[1:04:25] shall stand within thy Gates oh
[1:04:28] Jerusalem Jerusalem is build it as a
[1:04:30] city that is compact together whether
[1:04:33] the tribes go up the tribes of the Lord
[1:04:36] unto the testimony of Israel to give
[1:04:37] thanks unto the name of the Lord for
[1:04:40] there are set the Thrones of judgment
[1:04:42] the Thrones of the House of David pray
[1:04:45] for the Peace of Jerusalem they shall
[1:04:48] prosper that love thee peace be within
[1:04:50] thy walls and prosperity within thy
[1:04:53] palaces for thy brethren
[1:04:55] for my brethren and companion sakes I
[1:04:58] will now say peace be within thee
[1:05:00] because of the house of the Lord Our God
[1:05:04] I will seek thy good and Psalm 121 just
[1:05:07] before that it was that page that it
[1:05:09] opened up and that's also that's very
[1:05:12] beautiful as well I will lift up mine
[1:05:14] eyes unto the hills from whence cometh
[1:05:16] my help my Help Cometh From The Lord
[1:05:20] which made Heaven and Earth he will not
[1:05:22] suffer thy foot to be moved he that keep
[1:05:24] thee will not Slumber behold he that
[1:05:27] keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor
[1:05:30] sleep The Lord Is Thy keeper The Lord Is
[1:05:33] Thy shade upon thy right hand the the
[1:05:35] sun shall not smite thee by day nor the
[1:05:38] Moon by Night the Lord shall preserve
[1:05:40] thee from all evil he shall preserve thy
[1:05:43] Soul the Lord shall preserve thy going
[1:05:45] out and thy coming in from this time
[1:05:46] forth and even forever
[1:05:49] more so yes I I I used to be Amish and
[1:05:53] uh
[1:05:55] I grew up Amish and I remember I was
[1:05:58] searching even when I was
[1:06:00] young I used to read the Bible I that
[1:06:03] the one summer I I
[1:06:05] just uh come out of school I just went
[1:06:08] to e8th grade and I was uh working the
[1:06:11] fields that summer my dad was working
[1:06:13] away from the farm kind of to support to
[1:06:15] make the payments on the farm and I
[1:06:18] remember I also read the martyr's mirror
[1:06:20] that my mom and dad had in their
[1:06:21] bookshelf it was in English and it and
[1:06:23] it and that has the history of all the
[1:06:25] Martyrs from the time of Jesus to now
[1:06:29] and it's it's this thick and it it
[1:06:33] graphically it tells of how they died
[1:06:35] and believe me Hollywood has
[1:06:38] nothing their movies their worst movies
[1:06:41] have nothing over the devil has used all
[1:06:44] means any means you can imagine and more
[1:06:47] to take down the Church of God and he
[1:06:50] has not succeeded right praise God and
[1:06:54] so
[1:06:56] um I read that and I remember the one
[1:06:59] summer I was working in the field with
[1:07:02] the horses and you would let the horses
[1:07:03] rest of course they got tired and then
[1:07:05] you'd go again and I would ask my mom
[1:07:09] for her little bible English Bible and
[1:07:12] the Amish encourage you like read it in
[1:07:14] German the mother language the Amish
[1:07:16] religion is so much like the Catholic
[1:07:19] religion very similar but just like any
[1:07:21] other religion it's it's
[1:07:24] evil like religion is evil and I read
[1:07:27] that Bible but I didn't ask many
[1:07:29] questions because you just don't when
[1:07:30] you're on especially in the community I
[1:07:32] was in it's known to be very dark even
[1:07:36] by some other Amish communities farther
[1:07:39] south in homes County who are a little
[1:07:41] bit more open and so I'd read it and
[1:07:44] then you know five minutes you rest the
[1:07:46] horse five minutes and I went again and
[1:07:47] I remember pondering it was just a new
[1:07:49] testament in English pondering as I
[1:07:53] would
[1:07:54] you know Drive the horses again I think
[1:07:56] like as I went through the gospels and
[1:07:59] especially through the Epistles of Paul
[1:08:01] you know the the Epistles that Paul
[1:08:02] wrote in John and Timothy and I remember
[1:08:04] pondering thinking how what this all
[1:08:07] meant and like this is so amazing I
[1:08:09] meant I remember the the the amazing
[1:08:12] feelings and the emotions and then when
[1:08:14] I read through Revelation I'll never
[1:08:15] forget that um the great fear like
[1:08:20] actually you you know awe and then also
[1:08:24] like just uh just awe of God and then
[1:08:30] real fear too because I I didn't ask
[1:08:33] anybody what you know what some of this
[1:08:36] meant but I and also we got gospel
[1:08:39] tracks into mail so I knew the real
[1:08:42] gospel the Amish have just gospel mixed
[1:08:46] with a lot of church
[1:08:47] rules and
[1:08:50] so I remember going up on my knees up in
[1:08:54] my room when I was like 10 or like 12
[1:08:57] like between 10 and 12 years old many
[1:08:59] time sometimes I'd go up my room and I'd
[1:09:00] just pray I'd said Lord God I believe
[1:09:03] Jesus I believe that you died for my
[1:09:05] sins I believe that you came and died
[1:09:10] for the sins of all mankind and I
[1:09:12] believe you died for my sins and I just
[1:09:14] want to be
[1:09:15] saved and so after that I read the Bible
[1:09:19] out in the fields
[1:09:21] and I remember the struggles I would
[1:09:24] have and the one of the things that I'll
[1:09:28] never
[1:09:29] forget is when the devil now I know it
[1:09:32] was the devil it was not mental illness
[1:09:34] the devil used a
[1:09:37] scripture to control me or try to
[1:09:40] control me for like three years I
[1:09:43] remember where I was standing when I
[1:09:44] read the scripture that
[1:09:47] says all sins can be
[1:09:50] forgiven except the blaspheming
[1:09:54] except blaspheming the Holy Spirit and I
[1:09:56] remembered that great fear that just it
[1:09:59] just shot through me like what if I
[1:10:01] would but I never asked anybody later on
[1:10:05] when I asked even some of the Amish know
[1:10:08] that it's not interpreted like I did but
[1:10:10] the devil knows that too and he knew I
[1:10:12] was searching he knew I was reading the
[1:10:14] Bible that was when I was 13 and I was
[1:10:16] mocked some by my brothers and my cousin
[1:10:17] for reading the Bible and but God God
[1:10:20] saw God saw I was searching he he he
[1:10:22] knows he knows our hearts and oh I
[1:10:26] wanted that oh I wanted the faith that I
[1:10:28] saw those Martyrs who died for Jesus
[1:10:32] amen they died for Jesus gruesome deaths
[1:10:36] and it was for Jesus and so I remember I
[1:10:43] would think you know is it bad words you
[1:10:45] put in your mind like if you mistakenly
[1:10:48] think you know like like a a bad word
[1:10:51] cier word that I heard at you know at
[1:10:53] work or wherever you know I knew what
[1:10:55] bad words were and and I was thinking
[1:10:58] does that mean like if I think some bad
[1:11:01] words and
[1:11:03] then like if I just simply say a bad
[1:11:06] word against the Holy Spirit would that
[1:11:07] mean I have blasphemed Holy Spirit then
[1:11:11] and
[1:11:12] eventually uh later on the doctors
[1:11:15] diagnosed me with
[1:11:17] OCD but I know of course the de that
[1:11:22] Satan comes against us he he he comes
[1:11:25] against he he does that to us he he's
[1:11:28] and today that sermon today helped me
[1:11:31] just showed me
[1:11:33] again he is the accuser of the
[1:11:36] Brethren that's what he is that's what
[1:11:38] he is and so I I'll never forget the
[1:11:43] night when I was 16 I had also fallen
[1:11:47] into sin then and I was so disgusted
[1:11:49] with myself and I couldn't quit and I
[1:11:52] had read some Western
[1:11:54] books and it went from there and I
[1:11:57] remember the one night I thought I had
[1:12:00] gone too
[1:12:01] far and I came down I was pacing the
[1:12:03] floor and I was sure I had blasphemed
[1:12:05] the Holy Spirit now I I was I I was many
[1:12:08] times i' said maybe I had because I some
[1:12:11] bad words came to my mind and then the
[1:12:13] Holy Spirit and and just other things
[1:12:14] like that that I had the devil had
[1:12:17] convinced me that I blasphemed the holy
[1:12:19] spirit that night it was like coming to
[1:12:21] a point the guilt of the the sins the
[1:12:25] sins I was in and the blasphemed Holy
[1:12:29] Spirit finally that night I remember
[1:12:32] I'll never forget that night it was so
[1:12:33] dark and I I was like even my mom said
[1:12:37] no just think about the blood of Jesus
[1:12:40] like pouring over you she was the most
[1:12:42] open of our family always and I wanted
[1:12:44] to believe it that I hadn't blasing the
[1:12:47] holy spirit because I told her I I think
[1:12:48] God Blas the Holy Spirit I had not
[1:12:50] talked to anybody about that before and
[1:12:53] that night was so dark I
[1:12:55] remember I my whole life my whole view
[1:12:59] of Life changed from the night before
[1:13:01] till the next morning and I actually was
[1:13:04] demon possessed I think for a few days
[1:13:06] especially because that night I remember
[1:13:09] that Jaws it felt like the jaws of hell
[1:13:11] were totally open and I this is no lie
[1:13:16] it might seem ridiculous but I actually
[1:13:19] prayed that night that God would put me
[1:13:21] in a part of hell that was not one of
[1:13:25] the worst parts of hell because I
[1:13:26] remember reading the Bible that Jesus
[1:13:29] said the Pharisees will receive the
[1:13:31] greater condemnation I was so sure I was
[1:13:33] going to hell that I prayed for that and
[1:13:38] the next day my brother said I was up in
[1:13:40] the maple tree outside the house and I
[1:13:42] was laughing like a lunatic I don't even
[1:13:44] remember that day I just lost it I was
[1:13:47] there was no almost no doubt I was going
[1:13:49] to but I remember one thing that night I
[1:13:51] said God if there is a chance that I'm
[1:13:55] not going to hell I will do anything for
[1:13:56] you and I will I will do that I don't
[1:13:59] care what it what whatever God asked of
[1:14:01] me I will do I don't it doesn't matter
[1:14:03] if if it comes to the point where I have
[1:14:05] to die for Jesus I'll gladly do it
[1:14:08] because those next few years were like
[1:14:10] almost hell on Earth and I became an
[1:14:13] alcoholic to cover my
[1:14:15] pain and so long story
[1:14:20] short like I said I went with the Amish
[1:14:23] youth where it's accepted you go drink
[1:14:25] and you know be uh as kind of SE your
[1:14:30] Wild Oats what they call it and then you
[1:14:32] decide if you want to stay Amish or go
[1:14:33] out into the world and that's very
[1:14:35] Twisted too that's so it's so evil it's
[1:14:40] religion
[1:14:42] and
[1:14:44] so I was addicted to alcohol I was
[1:14:49] smoking I was
[1:14:51] overweight and all of that was to cover
[1:14:53] up the pain of I thought I was you know
[1:14:57] done for UND this Earth I was going to
[1:14:59] hell anyway and so I actually I became
[1:15:02] Born
[1:15:03] Again In I I I believe in 2009 it was in
[1:15:08] 2009 is
[1:15:09] when I I remember I was up in my room
[1:15:12] and I went on my knees and I said
[1:15:14] uh I prayed and I
[1:15:17] said I remember praying it was it was
[1:15:21] the first time it was not an anxious
[1:15:22] prayer
[1:15:23] it was a prayer and I believed it when I
[1:15:25] said I said Jesus I said I know I said
[1:15:29] oh god oh Jesus I know that you will
[1:15:32] help me that I know you can make so I
[1:15:37] can quit drinking and I believed it and
[1:15:39] I also I prayed I said Jesus I want to
[1:15:42] give my whole heart to you I believe
[1:15:43] that you died for my sins I I want I
[1:15:45] want to be saved I believe you died for
[1:15:49] my sins I give you my whole heart and I
[1:15:51] believed it that he would help me quit
[1:15:53] drinking and in the next month or
[1:15:56] so everything changed for me I I quit I
[1:15:59] uh quit drinking I quit smoking and I
[1:16:02] actually weaned myself off of the
[1:16:04] medication I was on and it was all
[1:16:07] because of Jesus it's all because of
[1:16:08] Jesus it's only him it's only him it's
[1:16:11] it's it's not me it's him doing his work
[1:16:14] in me in us it's it's and
[1:16:19] so
[1:16:21] I that those those were beautiful two
[1:16:24] beautiful years where I was just I had
[1:16:28] no thought of Leaning the Amish
[1:16:30] but it life was totally it it changed
[1:16:35] Jesus Jesus changed my life like he does
[1:16:39] for us he totally transformed my life
[1:16:42] and I quit drinking quit smoking I lost
[1:16:44] weight my health got a lot just
[1:16:48] everything
[1:16:49] and but then to I I want to keep my
[1:16:55] testimony uh down to it's already over
[1:16:57] 10 minutes so
[1:17:02] but it it's for three years I was it was
[1:17:05] so beautiful I'll never forget those
[1:17:07] years it was almost sometimes like
[1:17:09] paradise because I had thought there was
[1:17:11] no way I could like get out of this dark
[1:17:14] hole that life would always be like the
[1:17:15] counselors told me the worldly
[1:17:16] counselors you you just have to live
[1:17:18] with it but no now I see it with Jesus
[1:17:21] and by Amish like my aunt once asked me
[1:17:24] what did you do you're so different
[1:17:26] you're happy you talk and even I
[1:17:30] wasn't like I knew I was saved I was
[1:17:34] pretty sure of that but it's the homage
[1:17:37] religion is so it's so evil it's so deep
[1:17:41] and deeply religious but I knew enough
[1:17:44] that I was saved and so for 10 years um
[1:17:48] for for two or three years I was just it
[1:17:51] was I was walking with the Lord he
[1:17:54] was it it was wonderful and then I
[1:17:58] started believing the lies my own mom
[1:18:00] and dad told me once are you trying to
[1:18:03] be perfect better than us when I was on
[1:18:06] fire and I'll never foret that is why I
[1:18:08] hate religion I know exactly why brother
[1:18:10] brandham said what he did and why Jesus
[1:18:13] talked to the Pharisees like he did
[1:18:14] because it's so evil it is so evil it
[1:18:18] looks good on the outside but it's not
[1:18:20] there is a lot of sin going on and it's
[1:18:23] covered up but for 10 years that was
[1:18:26] three years it was wonderful for 10 but
[1:18:28] then I fell again and I went out the
[1:18:30] devil attacked me and those 10 years
[1:18:32] were I it was it was it
[1:18:36] was the the struggles
[1:18:39] were it it was almost hell on Earth it I
[1:18:42] mean
[1:18:43] I I knew I had lost somehow I had lost
[1:18:48] that joy and that peace I had lost that
[1:18:52] connection I knew Jesus was still there
[1:18:53] but I had lost that beautiful connection
[1:18:57] and and my I tried natural supplements I
[1:19:01] tried medication I tried almost
[1:19:05] everything that you can think about
[1:19:08] and it was up and down and then uh three
[1:19:11] years
[1:19:12] ago I was I said God whatever it takes I
[1:19:16] I only want to glor you to be glorified
[1:19:19] and I have so much pain just heal me
[1:19:21] just I just just want to glorify you I
[1:19:24] only want to follow you totally all the
[1:19:26] way and so something happened that I
[1:19:29] that I left the Amish I I had to leave
[1:19:30] home there and my brother and my sister
[1:19:31] opened up their home to me and they my
[1:19:34] brothers prayed over me and I'll never
[1:19:36] forget
[1:19:37] it I saw then that it was not I was not
[1:19:41] diagnosed with a mental illness I was
[1:19:42] not diagnosed with schizophrenia or
[1:19:45] anything it was the forces of
[1:19:50] Darkness it was the devil that
[1:19:54] was coming against me like he does all
[1:19:57] the children of God the accuser of the
[1:19:58] Brethren my brothers laid hands on me
[1:20:00] the am don't do that they laid hands on
[1:20:03] me and they prayed in the name of
[1:20:05] Jesus the darkness must leave the devil
[1:20:09] must go he is rebuked in the name of
[1:20:13] Jesus the name above all names
[1:20:18] and long story short I healed more in a
[1:20:21] year and a half
[1:20:23] than I ever had in 20 years and that was
[1:20:26] three years ago and then I and and
[1:20:29] people were amazed again how I healed
[1:20:32] and I believe God took me through that
[1:20:34] time I believe he took me through those
[1:20:36] 10 years after I after the devil I don't
[1:20:39] like to say that because I don't like to
[1:20:41] glorify the devil he tried but he did
[1:20:44] not succeed he he did not succeed Jesus
[1:20:47] Christ I like the sign there Jesus
[1:20:49] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:20:50] forever and I like the song only believe
[1:20:53] because truly I can't blame my parents I
[1:20:57] can't blame the people who mock me why
[1:21:02] because I if I would have kept on
[1:21:06] believing that's where the devil has no
[1:21:08] power right and so um so my brothers
[1:21:13] prayed over me and and I I I just saw
[1:21:16] the truth and then I saw that you can't
[1:21:18] read too much in the word you cannot
[1:21:19] read too much in the word the word is
[1:21:21] our answer is it's our life our hope
[1:21:25] it's everything Jesus is
[1:21:28] everything so to uh so that was three
[1:21:32] years ago and
[1:21:34] then I went through so much healing
[1:21:36] Jesus I felt the God showed me things
[1:21:40] that just wonderful but it's all about
[1:21:44] the Lord Jesus Christ and then I said
[1:21:46] God I'm with a fellowship right now
[1:21:50] where uh it was it's beautiful beautiful
[1:21:52] and and I they're they're anointed they
[1:21:54] have they've prayed over me
[1:21:57] they uh I I know the holy spirit is
[1:21:59] there it's n denominational
[1:22:02] Fellowship but I said God if there's
[1:22:04] anything more even if I think this is
[1:22:07] where you want me to stay I don't care
[1:22:09] what it takes show me and that's why I
[1:22:10] believe he show he led me to meet a
[1:22:13] brother this summer who introduced me to
[1:22:17] the message and now I know I believe
[1:22:19] that God sent a message for his bride
[1:22:22] amen the church that Jesus spoke through
[1:22:26] a Spoke through a man and he was same as
[1:22:32] me and you though he was ordained from
[1:22:34] the womb to be a prophet but yet God
[1:22:38] gave his his
[1:22:41] church the Bride of Jesus Christ a
[1:22:44] message and it's so beautiful and I was
[1:22:46] baptized in the name of Jesus this
[1:22:48] summer and all I want is to come to the
[1:22:51] fullness of of
[1:22:54] Christ and there again and that again
[1:22:57] showed me it's only Jesus it's only
[1:23:01] Jesus it's all about Jesus praise God
[1:23:12] so brother Josiah uh sister Katie if you
[1:23:15] would make ready and then after um after
[1:23:19] they sing then uh sister Jessica Adams
[1:23:22] do you have a song
[1:23:23] very very good um before I'd like to
[1:23:25] read a
[1:23:29] scripture our brother was saying I'm
[1:23:33] going to read a scripture and a quote
[1:23:35] our brother was saying about religion
[1:23:37] and and really religion has been a tool
[1:23:41] of the enemy from the beginning there is
[1:23:44] a false but there is a
[1:23:47] true
[1:23:49] James 1: 27 says this and it's this
[1:23:53] simple this simple brothers and sisters
[1:23:56] we want to make it so complicated we
[1:23:58] want to we want to have do you have to
[1:23:59] have these deep understandings and you
[1:24:01] have to have all of this the Apostle
[1:24:04] James pastor of the church in Jerusalem
[1:24:06] said this pure religion and undefiled
[1:24:09] before God and the father is
[1:24:12] this to visit the fatherless and the
[1:24:15] widows in their Affliction and to keep
[1:24:18] him himself unspotted from the
[1:24:21] world it really really is that
[1:24:24] simple serve others stay away from the
[1:24:28] world and as our brother said put Jesus
[1:24:30] Christ first and brother martin has had
[1:24:32] Brother Marlin has had a hard time he's
[1:24:35] been pretty much shunned by his family
[1:24:37] and and by the people he grew up with
[1:24:41] and of course that's a very very
[1:24:43] difficult thing you can imagine us how
[1:24:46] how hard that would be for for us if the
[1:24:49] our people that we love the most would
[1:24:52] shun us would kick us out and and not be
[1:24:54] allowed to even speak to
[1:24:57] us but did you hear what our brother
[1:24:59] said wasn't my parents fault wasn't my
[1:25:03] brother's fault wasn't my friend's fault
[1:25:06] it's my fault so we can we can never
[1:25:09] blame someone else and the enemy one of
[1:25:12] the biggest tools the enemy has is to
[1:25:15] tell you that you have blaspheme the
[1:25:17] Holy Ghost it is it's around it's caused
[1:25:20] people I've seen people myself people
[1:25:22] that I have known have killed themselves
[1:25:24] one person in particular killed himself
[1:25:27] because he could not get past the F the
[1:25:30] thought that he thought he had
[1:25:31] blasphemed the Holy Ghost let me read
[1:25:33] this to you the prophet says
[1:25:40] this questions and answers he says
[1:25:43] someone asked this I have I have lived
[1:25:45] many years in sin until I found the Lord
[1:25:48] please brother brandom I have sinned
[1:25:50] again and am not worthy to come before
[1:25:52] you in this holy place please tell me if
[1:25:55] I can be restored hold whole
[1:25:58] again
[1:26:00] yes you have not sinned my friends so
[1:26:03] far in God but what you could be
[1:26:06] restored if you had sinned so far that
[1:26:09] you could not be restored you'd never
[1:26:11] want to be
[1:26:12] restored see but as long as there is
[1:26:15] something dealing with your heart you
[1:26:17] are still in the line of
[1:26:21] restoration am amen and that's from a
[1:26:24] higher office than I have praise
[1:26:28] God we didn't we didn't plan this song
[1:26:31] knowing what the testimonies were going
[1:26:32] to be about but uh part of the song says

[1:43:03] I was a young
[1:43:04] man uh about 20 years old um I don't
[1:43:08] want to think about how long ago that
[1:43:10] was but but it it was quite a long time
[1:43:12] ago anyway it's a song that uh that
[1:43:17] we've sung here once before and I better
[1:43:19] just be quiet and start singing
[1:43:22] [Music]
[1:43:25] yeah I searched and I search for the
[1:43:30] road that leads to Glory I wondered if
[1:43:34] I'd ever find the
[1:43:37] way I sat down to rest for my feet had
[1:43:42] grown so weary but then I Heard a Voice
[1:43:46] Within Me
[1:43:48] say you've got to
[1:43:51] Keep On Walking just keep right on
[1:43:55] walking walking in the light of the
[1:44:00] Lord you'll get to Heaven someday if you
[1:44:06] walk the right way walking in the light
[1:44:11] of the
[1:44:13] Lord I pray and I pray for the Lord to
[1:44:18] give me mercy wa for him to brighten up
[1:44:23] my
[1:44:25] way I was so afraid for the road became
[1:44:30] so lonely and then I Heard a Voice
[1:44:34] Within Me
[1:44:36] say you've got to keep on walking just
[1:44:42] keep right on walking walking in the
[1:44:46] light of the
[1:44:48] Lord you'll get to Heaven someday if you
[1:44:53] walk the right way walking in the light
[1:44:58] of the
[1:45:01] Lord and after a while I felt something
[1:45:06] going got
[1:45:09] close I stepped back up behind a great
[1:45:12] big column there and I said Heavenly
[1:45:15] Father what would you have your servant
[1:45:18] do it kept going
[1:45:20] [Music]
[1:45:23] was real still a minute and then I heard
[1:45:26] a deep voice say turn go
[1:45:30] back well I I turned and I went walking
[1:45:34] back down the street I walked and I
[1:45:38] walked on past the

[1:47:05] sister
[1:47:12] Elizabeth God bless I just wanted to
[1:47:14] share a testimony about my brother and
[1:47:16] goes along with brother Martin's
[1:47:18] testimony I have to cry cuz my brother
[1:47:22] been Pelin for many many years and a
[1:47:24] severe severe
[1:47:26] alcoholic folks he's gotten so low that
[1:47:29] he was drinking mouthwash perfume
[1:47:33] cologne um just in a desperate desperate
[1:47:37] situation and he had alienated everyone
[1:47:40] from his life everyone he didn't have a
[1:47:42] place to live to
[1:47:44] stay um one day he was intoxicated he
[1:47:47] fell and he scraped his arm and his foot
[1:47:50] in a little other place in his body and
[1:47:53] then within 3 days he got really sick
[1:47:56] his limb started
[1:47:58] swelling and uh he walked to Circle K
[1:48:02] and he nearly collapsed and they called
[1:48:04] 911 and took him to the hospital so then
[1:48:07] they contacted my brother my my other
[1:48:09] brother contacted me and I went there
[1:48:11] and I have not had a relationship with
[1:48:13] my brother for many many years do you
[1:48:16] know he
[1:48:17] just didn't want really to do anything
[1:48:19] with the family family part probably for
[1:48:21] being ashamed and when I got there he
[1:48:24] was in desperate
[1:48:26] need of the Lord and medical attention
[1:48:30] so they took him into surgery and they
[1:48:32] cleaned up his wounds and then within
[1:48:34] hours they told me he had flesh eating
[1:48:37] disease and his limbs started being
[1:48:39] eaten I mean just he went into two
[1:48:43] surgeries they took almost all the flesh
[1:48:46] off his forearm up into his arm his foot
[1:48:50] they thought they were going to have to
[1:48:51] amputate it and you know I I prayed we I
[1:48:55] prayed with him that night and I asked
[1:48:57] him I said do you need to seek the Lord
[1:49:00] and you need to seek salvation for your
[1:49:02] soul first amen and then that the Lord
[1:49:05] will heal you from your alcoholism
[1:49:09] wow and he went my brother is the most
[1:49:12] um positive person I've ever met you
[1:49:14] know so much so that it's just you know
[1:49:18] click click you know you got to have a
[1:49:19] little touch with real so that you can
[1:49:21] really you know have a deep heart
[1:49:24] feeling and uh you know I'm not one to
[1:49:27] minutes words you know no
[1:49:31] never you know so I kind of laid into
[1:49:33] him you know I said you need to put a
[1:49:35] aside that false positivity and seek the
[1:49:37] Lord you know you're going to die you
[1:49:40] are going to die you know and so the
[1:49:43] Lord pretty really put a burden in my
[1:49:45] heart to visit him and I am not the most
[1:49:48] nurturing person no my daughter came
[1:49:51] that is just not my nature that you know
[1:49:53] to coddle people and but the Lord really
[1:49:55] put a burden in my heart to start
[1:49:57] visiting him weekly and you know and
[1:50:00] praying for him and my sister started
[1:50:02] visiting him also and just telling him
[1:50:05] if it wasn't for her and I nobody would
[1:50:07] visit him nobody there was no one to see
[1:50:10] him he just a nobody wanted to do
[1:50:12] anything to do with him so we just
[1:50:14] started praying and asking the Lord and
[1:50:16] and encourag him to seek the Lord and he
[1:50:19] was in the hospital for 30 days and then
[1:50:21] he went to a skill nursing facility and
[1:50:24] he really still didn't have a sense of
[1:50:26] how close he was to losing his life and
[1:50:28] I would just tell him you have this
[1:50:30] false sense of security that you're
[1:50:33] going to be well and you're going to go
[1:50:34] on with your life but you're going to
[1:50:36] continue to be an alcoholic if the Lord
[1:50:38] doesn't do something for you and you
[1:50:41] know I just and then he went to a rehab
[1:50:44] from there for alcoholism and one day I
[1:50:47] went in there and he had his false
[1:50:48] positivity and I said you need the Lord
[1:50:51] today you need to just put away that
[1:50:55] false positivity that you have and just
[1:50:59] dig deep you know and uh he started
[1:51:03] praying and asking the Lord and one day
[1:51:05] he went to the doctor and Doctor some we
[1:51:07] thought you were going to die and in
[1:51:09] that moment it clicked how close he was
[1:51:11] to death and he started really seeking
[1:51:13] the Lord he started reading his Bible
[1:51:15] and my sister took him some books from
[1:51:17] Brother mam sermons I took him some
[1:51:19] books
[1:51:20] U man sent from God and some other ones
[1:51:22] he started reading he started sharing
[1:51:24] with other people testifying of what
[1:51:26] God's been doing for him
[1:51:28] amen and because you never you cannot
[1:51:31] have a one-on-one without a counselor
[1:51:32] being on there and then he says I've
[1:51:34] shared with Amy you know brother Bam's
[1:51:37] life story and I said I encourage her to
[1:51:39] keep reading he called me yesterday he
[1:51:41] goes can you bring me some more message
[1:51:43] books because you know I run out of I've
[1:51:46] read them all and people are asking me
[1:51:48] for more books because if more people
[1:51:51] are reading and requesting and another
[1:51:53] person requested a Bible and you know we
[1:51:55] took another Bible from all the Bibles
[1:51:57] that we had and I believe the Lord is
[1:51:59] going to touch him you know and that and
[1:52:01] that is going to heal him and keep him
[1:52:03] CU right now he's in a very sheltered
[1:52:05] environment for rehab and then he's
[1:52:07] going to go to a step down and get kind
[1:52:08] of back into the society and just and I
[1:52:12] said you have to have the Lord in order
[1:52:13] to maintain your sobriety you can have
[1:52:16] AA all you want but if you don't have
[1:52:19] the Lord you're not GNA so please keep
[1:52:21] them in your prayer the Lord has really
[1:52:23] worked in his life and you know the Lord
[1:52:26] give me
[1:52:27] patience you know cuz you know it takes
[1:52:30] a lot for me to you know to help
[1:52:32] somebody you know and you know just keep
[1:52:35] us all both on my family we have a lot
[1:52:38] of people in our family who have

[1:53:24] willing sister Missy is willing to go
[1:53:28] the extra mile and do whatever it takes
[1:53:30] and I have seen that in her and that's

[1:53:47] another
[1:53:48] testimony
[1:53:55] oh God bless you all I just wanted
[1:53:58] to talk about the Lord's timing and this
[1:54:01] is a testimony that I've had on my heart
[1:54:03] for a really long time and I always say
[1:54:05] oh we have one of those Services I'm
[1:54:06] going to say something that I never do
[1:54:08] because I get really nervous which is
[1:54:10] odd because in my old position I was a
[1:54:12] public speaker but somehow this always
[1:54:15] terrifies me some years
[1:54:17] ago um my husband and I were going to to
[1:54:19] meet family and go camping and a thought
[1:54:23] came to me uh and I asked my husband I
[1:54:26] said we were just looking and touring
[1:54:28] houses not really planning on moving but
[1:54:31] um you know just thinking about it
[1:54:33] talking about it and I I asked him I I
[1:54:35] said what would you think if if we did
[1:54:38] move then my mom moov into our house she
[1:54:41] lived about you know about 40 minutes
[1:54:43] away and we would see her you know a
[1:54:44] couple times a week and it was not a far
[1:54:46] drive but it would have been convenient
[1:54:49] for her to live closer and he said yeah
[1:54:51] absolutely so I called her and I said
[1:54:54] what would you think if you know and I
[1:54:56] start tell she didn't let me finish and
[1:54:58] she said yes yes I would love to move
[1:55:01] and I said okay well let's let's plan
[1:55:04] that with then so it I asked we had like
[1:55:07] a two-year time frame So within that two
[1:55:10] years um Nina my cousin um Nina V you
[1:55:14] might know her Nina Gara she was nanning
[1:55:17] for us uh full time and I was always
[1:55:21] terrified that whenever she moved away
[1:55:23] or decided she didn't want to then what
[1:55:25] would happen with our girls how would
[1:55:27] the Lord take care of them and he always
[1:55:29] had put someone in their place whether
[1:55:31] it's at school or preschool always Place
[1:55:34] someone there to to make me feel better
[1:55:36] and to take care of them so within that
[1:55:39] two years nah met someone and she was
[1:55:42] going to marry him and move away and
[1:55:44] that was so terrifying but the Lord was
[1:55:46] so sweet and so kind that Within in the
[1:55:50] month that she married my mom moved into
[1:55:54] the new house and everything just worked
[1:55:57] out there was the kids started a new
[1:55:59] school and there was someone there that
[1:56:02] um that I didn't know but my cousin my
[1:56:06] other cousin knew and she said she's so
[1:56:08] trusting and so loving and she's going
[1:56:10] to take care of the girls and she did
[1:56:13] and the Lord just placed everything in
[1:56:15] the right spot at the right time God and
[1:56:17] so whenever I think about my husband
[1:56:21] and his salvation I just think Lord how

[2:02:33] booth there of course you know to handle
[2:02:35] all the electronics and everything

[2:02:41] problems just a
[2:02:43] lot like I couldn't I it couldn't seem
[2:02:45] to get anything
[2:02:47] straight and and uh times haven't
[2:02:50] changed much
[2:02:52] but uh I had a key to the north side
[2:02:56] because I used to work on the air
[2:02:58] conditioners
[2:02:59] there so one day I went
[2:03:02] by
[2:03:04] uh the
[2:03:06] church I just wanted to pray you know I
[2:03:08] just wanted
[2:03:10] to you know talk to the
[2:03:13] Lord about our problems and we should
[2:03:17] really really pray for one another
[2:03:19] that's such a wonderful thing that I can
[2:03:22] say Hey Brother Dan
[2:03:25] or uh anybody else while you're talking
[2:03:28] to God could you bring my name
[2:03:31] up I mean what a miraculous thing that
[2:03:34] is but anyways I
[2:03:37] uh I was sitting in there I was
[2:03:40] praying and I was all by myself that
[2:03:43] room's dark when there's no one in there
[2:03:45] the lights are all shut off and
[2:03:47] everything and I just just sitting on a
[2:03:50] Pew and uh just like this one here and I
[2:03:54] looked up and above the vestibule over
[2:03:58] at North Side it says be still and know
[2:04:01] I am
[2:04:02] God but the projection system had came
[2:04:06] on the light it was just like an answer
[2:04:10] to my
[2:04:12] prayer we have it's like the brother
[2:04:14] said it's all about
[2:04:15] Jesus we got to take our burdens and the
[2:04:18] put them there and the problem with it
[2:04:20] is a lot of times is we take our burdens

[2:16:35] of their testimony you have a testimony
[2:16:38] here tonight a testimony that maybe the
[2:16:41] devil tried to stop that seed from
[2:16:43] coming to life but almighty God rich in
[2:16:46] Mercy his goodness father followed you
[2:16:48] right down your Trail and brought that
[2:16:50] seed quickened that seed and now you're
[2:16:52] here today Alive quickened by the power
[2:16:55] of the Holy Ghost to be a child of God I
[2:16:59] like what the prophet of God said he

[2:17:10] you never was out drifting and lowly
[2:17:13] unforgotten by by by God but no you
[2:17:16] always was and that's why he sent you a
[2:17:19] a message that's why he sent you a
[2:17:21] prophet that's why he went to Christ or
[2:17:23] Christ went to Calvary to die for your
[2:17:25] sins cuz he placed the seed
[2:17:28] there his goodness and mercy and his
