[23:52] this is a song that one of our friends
[23:55] in alaska wrote
[23:56] by the name of john davis and there's a
[23:59] little bit of a
[24:00] testimony to his oh uh please be seated
[24:05] i couldn't figure out why brother aaron
[24:07] was waving at me
[24:11] so the testimonies of this our friend
[24:13] john davis
[24:14] he's got quite a life his father passed
[24:16] away at a very young age
[24:19] when john was young and he ended up
[24:21] living on the streets
[24:22] and in with just the wrong crowd and
[24:25] with alcohol and all sorts of
[24:28] all the darkness that you can find on
[24:30] the streets
[24:31] and he his family knew the lord but
[24:36] they just saw him go and then
[24:40] they kept praying for him and they
[24:41] watched his life just turn around
[24:43] they watched him go from just being dark
[24:46] and depressed and bound up with sin
[24:49] to being free and happy
[24:52] and and now he's got a wife and
[24:55] a little boy and another little one on
[24:57] the way and he's preaching and
[24:59] he's just got the joy of the lord in his
[25:00] heart and there's just a sweetness about
[25:02] him
[25:03] and he wrote this song and i really
[25:05] enjoyed it so we're going to try to sing
[25:06] it here for you
[25:16] the mighty hand of god reached down
[25:22] [Music]

[25:37] [Music]
[25:40] last and beaten by the life i
[25:44] lived and captive to
[25:48] the man i'd been
[25:53] soon delivered by the master's hand
[26:00] he guided me to my red sea
[26:07] parted waters and i walked
[26:10] a crawl
[26:13] following my savior's leaves
[26:21] little did i know
[26:28] he'd lead me to battle
[26:31] to fight a fight i could not win alone
[26:34] but with him i'd overcome
[26:38] [Music]
[26:40] the enemy surrounded me
[26:44] threatening defeat i thought i
[26:48] was to lose
[26:52] but i'd win battles with my jesus
[26:56] little did i know
[27:02] a bed of roses wasn't promised
[27:09] when he said take up your cross
[27:15] my yoke is easy and my burdens
[27:23] [Music]
[27:29] though we suffer much and fight on
[27:35] [Music]
[27:45] is already one
[27:49] with jesus fighting on before

[28:07] try to fight i could not win alone
[28:11] but with him i'd overcome
[28:16] the enemy surrounded me
[28:20] threatening defeat i thought i
[28:24] was to lose
[28:27] but i'd win battles with my jesus
[28:31] little did i know
[28:36] little did i know
[28:41] [Music]
[28:42] he'd lead me to battle

[32:16] we've got one prayer request
[32:19] written out this evening from brother
[32:22] guerra senior
[32:23] he says pray for my sister nora she's
[32:26] been having
[32:27] pain in her left hip when she walks
[32:31] and we also have a praise from brother
[32:34] john hall
[32:35] an update on his prayer request i was
[32:38] thinking the other day we had
[32:40] a big number of prayer requests
[32:43] not a big number of praises and i
[32:45] thought is is that the way it is is that
[32:48] do our prayer requests outnumber what we
[32:51] have to give praise for
[32:53] and i'd say no because many are the
[32:56] afflictions of the righteous but the
[32:57] lord delivers
[32:58] him out of them all some of them we have
[33:01] to wait a while for but we know for
[33:02] every prayer request there's
[33:04] there's got to be some praise that comes
[33:06] of it
[33:08] the surgery went well for brother john
[33:10] hall the nerve pain
[33:12] and the numbness and the arms and
[33:14] tingling that he had for
[33:16] most of five years is gone praise the
[33:19] lord he's praying for strength to return
[33:22] to
[33:23] his legs and extremities
[33:27] and another praise we were we were over
[33:30] at the johnson's cooking last night and
[33:33] we were using a smoker
[33:36] uh and it wasn't working quite right and
[33:39] we had a fireball
[33:41] and it could have really been bad it
[33:43] could have
[33:46] hurt brother lyle or it could have hurt
[33:48] jonas was just right there just a little
[33:50] bit before that and
[33:51] he could have been hurt it could have
[33:53] caught the house on fire but
[33:55] the lord just let it all work out fine
[33:57] and it didn't even ruin the food
[33:59] so that was an extra blessing and then
[34:03] at work some things are going on just
[34:04] different things that could have been
[34:06] really bad but
[34:08] by god's grace they're not that bad and
[34:11] just
[34:11] some mistakes that were made and the
[34:13] situation and

[45:58] amen be not entangled again with the
[46:01] yoke of bondage turn to jonah chapter 1
[46:04] and we'll just read one portion and then
[46:06] have you be seated
[46:08] to the book of jonah chapter 1.

[46:15] just find joel daniel then joel then
[46:18] obadiah
[46:19] amos and you'll find jonah right there
[46:22] amen jonah chapter 1.
[46:24] now the word of the lord came to jonah
[46:27] the son of amitai saying now listen to
[46:30] the word of the lord
[46:31] arise get up arise
[46:35] it's always the lord what the lord says
[46:36] arise go
[46:38] to nineveh that great city and cry
[46:41] against it
[46:42] for their wickedness has come up before
[46:45] me but jonah arose to flee to tarshish
[46:48] from the presence of the lord he went
[46:51] down to joppa and found a ship
[46:53] going to tarshish so he paid the fare
[46:56] and he went down into it to go with them
[46:59] to tarshish
[47:00] from the presence of the lord let's just
[47:03] bow our heads if you have a knee just
[47:05] raise your hand to the lord ask god to
[47:06] remember that here tonight

[47:13] you tonight god asking for you know the
[47:15] need upon my heart lord
[47:17] what i've committed to you now lord i

[47:21] life lord that's here
[47:23] god for those that have gathered lord
[47:25] those that father may be at home
[47:27] streaming or wherever they're at lord
[47:29] we just believe that you have you you do
[47:32] all things well
[47:33] you do all things perfect lord and you
[47:35] you predestinated us
[47:37] before there was a foundation of the
[47:40] world lord you had us in your mind
[47:42] lord and our lives have been mapped out
[47:44] and planned out
[47:45] and lord the word is always perfect it
[47:48] always meets the need
[47:49] it always lord is the answer to the
[47:53] problem now lord may you just come
[47:55] tonight lord by your spirit
[47:57] father beyond your word may your spirit
[47:59] anoint the word to
[48:00] the speaker and knowing it to the hearer
[48:03] lord and may you receive the praise
[48:05] and all the glory meet every need in our
[48:07] midst we ask lord in jesus christ's name
[48:10] amen you can be seated
[48:13] we're speaking here tonight on a full
[48:16] surrender
[48:17] full surrender brother branham says here
[48:20] and i just have
[48:21] control here and i'll i'll begin here
[48:24] brother branham says you say you believe
[48:27] and haven't received the holy spirit
[48:29] something's wrong with your faith
[48:31] god circumcises the heart
[48:34] the minute the believer really comes
[48:39] in full surrender
[48:43] amen say that folks
[48:46] surely you must have done something i
[48:47] felt that even come back
[48:49] get it stop she says get it felt that
[48:52] come back
[48:53] uh when the believer here it is now when
[48:55] the believer
[48:56] firmly believes on the lord jesus
[49:00] christ god's under obligation
[49:04] to give him the holy ghost confirmation
[49:07] to his faith
[49:09] now i'm preaching to you here tonight on
[49:10] a full surrender i'm not
[49:12] going to preach on jonah jonah's life
[49:15] per se though we could
[49:17] and teach on it but we're going to use
[49:18] jonah as just an example
[49:20] here tonight and i just want to pause
[49:22] from this but i wanted to
[49:24] just read you the beginning here and
[49:26] we'll go back to this quote here in a
[49:27] moment
[49:28] but i want you to look here with me in
[49:30] jonah chapter one and just hold your
[49:31] place
[49:32] open amen to that because jonah is uh
[49:36] is very the book of jonah is very
[49:38] different than
[49:39] obadiah or amos or on any of the other
[49:42] minor prophets
[49:43] because the book of jonah though i'm
[49:46] sure he prophesied
[49:48] in his life he was a chosen vessel of
[49:50] god
[49:51] but jonah is very different than any
[49:53] other prophet because
[49:55] his book is not full of prophecies but
[49:58] instead the book is about the life of
[50:01] this prophet
[50:03] and the lord takes a lot of time and
[50:04] brother branham preaches a message on
[50:07] a man running from the presence of the
[50:09] lord and he and he says so much they're
[50:11] just
[50:12] uh such a masterpiece of a sermon if you
[50:15] haven't heard it
[50:16] recently i'd advise you to go and listen
[50:18] to it it's just wonderful
[50:20] but the bible begins here in jonah
[50:22] chapter 1 and it says
[50:24] and we're going to read it here again
[50:26] and he says in verse 3 but
[50:28] jonah arose to flee to tarshish
[50:31] from the presence of the lord he went
[50:34] down to
[50:34] joppa and found a ship going to tarshish
[50:37] so he paid
[50:38] and went down into it to go with them
[50:41] to tarshish from the presence
[50:45] of the lord so what is jonah
[50:48] running from in his life again preaching
[50:51] on a full surrender
[50:52] there was jonah was running from
[50:55] something
[50:56] there was there was it wasn't it wasn't
[50:59] his past
[51:00] that he was running from it wasn't the
[51:02] devil that he was running from
[51:04] it wasn't pressure from the enemy that
[51:07] he was running from elijah
[51:08] brother branham says runs from the
[51:10] pressure from jezebel
[51:12] but something very shocking and very
[51:14] amazing is that the bible says that
[51:16] jonah
[51:17] is just running from the presence
[51:20] of the lord can't imagine ever saying
[51:24] that about my life that i ran
[51:27] from the presence of god but within that
[51:30] presence of the lord was the will of the
[51:32] lord can you say amen
[51:34] it was the direction it was the leading
[51:36] of god and jonah's life it was the
[51:38] mission
[51:39] it was the purpose that god said there's
[51:41] something i i want you to the very first
[51:44] word of of jonah 1 is the bible says the
[51:47] word of the lord came up to jonah saying
[51:49] arise
[51:51] get up jonah go to nineveh that's an
[51:53] important word
[51:54] for a jew it's a it's a the jew has
[51:58] this word aaliyah which means simply to
[52:00] go up
[52:01] and a jew goes up it's a it's a going up
[52:04] to the house of god it's a
[52:06] to get up god says you you see this
[52:08] arise
[52:09] repeat it over and over and over again
[52:11] and especially in the old testament
[52:13] he says that to joshua after aiken's
[52:15] defeat get up joshua arise
[52:18] joshua we know the scripture that was
[52:20] prophesied to us
[52:22] in this generation says arise and shine
[52:26] for thy light has come so the message of
[52:29] god the word of the lord in our life has
[52:32] always arise it's always
[52:35] get up joshua why because as a believer
[52:38] your life is never about going
[52:41] down it's always supposed to be going
[52:44] up our life is can you can you follow me
[52:47] here tonight
[52:48] our life is always about go up get up
[52:51] arise it's ascension
[52:54] the life of serving god should be a life
[52:56] of dissension not descension
[53:01] there's no reverse gear there's no going
[53:03] backwards there's no even
[53:05] stopping and standing still a prophet of
[53:08] god says the minute you stop you're back
[53:10] sliding
[53:11] because there's an automatic trend
[53:14] there's an escalator in this world in
[53:16] lady asea and it's not as an ascending
[53:19] escalator
[53:20] it's a descending escalator everything
[53:22] is about going down
[53:23] so jonah's fleeing the bible says to it
[53:26] this word flee means to
[53:28] if you if you if you look up this word
[53:30] this greek word when it's when it says
[53:31] to flee
[53:33] it means to avoid
[53:36] to avoid to keep a distance from
[53:43] now think of the context of what the
[53:45] bible is saying here that
[53:47] jonah was avoiding the presence of the
[53:50] lord
[53:51] jonah was trying to keep a distance
[53:56] so once jonas god gives him a command
[53:58] and says arise and go to tar go to
[54:00] nineveh
[54:01] but what is jonah's reaction to what god
[54:04] told him
[54:05] he didn't say anything the bible doesn't
[54:07] say that jonah tries to
[54:08] give him a story and give him a sob
[54:10] story and
[54:12] and you know jonah doesn't try to
[54:14] negotiate
[54:15] there's no record of jonah negotiating
[54:17] with the lord as abraham negotiates and
[54:19] says if there be ten if there'd be five
[54:21] there's no record of even jonah trying
[54:24] to get clarity
[54:25] now we know i can teach and i got to be
[54:28] careful here because it's so easy to
[54:29] teach on jonah
[54:30] this was the assyrian the capital
[54:33] of nineveh was the capital of the
[54:36] assyrians who were an
[54:38] enemy to the jews they were one of their
[54:40] greatest enemies
[54:41] so god had already pronounced a curse
[54:44] and said i'm going to destroy them
[54:46] i'm going to wipe them off and no doubt
[54:48] to a jew that was the best news they
[54:50] could hear
[54:50] god was going to destroy their greatest
[54:52] enemy that's why jonah is
[54:53] as depressed and ready to take his own
[54:55] life when when they repent
[55:00] because god's saying lord are you going
[55:01] to wipe them out now their repentance
[55:03] not the result he wanted
[55:05] but but the bible says that he didn't
[55:07] say anything
[55:09] i want you to catch this and i got a key
[55:11] i'm going to keep repeating this theme
[55:12] of full surrender
[55:13] that's what the lord displaced so
[55:15] strongly upon my heart
[55:17] a full real full surrender brother
[55:20] branham says you say you have the holy
[55:22] ghost
[55:22] and he says but but he says you say you
[55:24] believe but you don't have the holy
[55:26] spirit said something's wrong with your
[55:27] faith
[55:28] he said because the minute not that a
[55:30] believer just believes mentally
[55:33] but when you really believe you make a
[55:35] full
[55:37] surrender to the lord
[55:40] the bible says that jonah doesn't he
[55:43] doesn't
[55:43] debate he doesn't contemplate he doesn't
[55:46] negotiate
[55:47] he doesn't converse he just runs
[55:50] he just goes the other way he refuses
[55:52] and he runs from the presence of the
[55:54] lord
[55:55] he avoids the presence of god he goes
[55:58] away what is it represented
[56:00] moving away from the path that god has
[56:02] revealed to you moving away from the
[56:04] presence of the lord in your life
[56:05] moving away from what god's called you
[56:07] to do from what god is convicting i
[56:08] don't care on what level of your life
[56:10] as we've been preaching to the voice of
[56:12] the lord is speaking to you
[56:13] the voice of the lord is convicting the
[56:15] voice of the lord is encouraging
[56:17] the voice of the lord is exposing sin
[56:22] and we as a believer have a choice to
[56:24] make to say i'm going to surrender to
[56:26] what god
[56:27] is telling me
[56:31] and notice the route that jonah's
[56:34] life takes notice what it says here
[56:38] jonah rose up
[56:39] follow me here in the scripture from
[56:41] tarshish he says
[56:43] jonah rose up to flee unto tarshish from
[56:46] the presence of the lord
[56:47] and he went down to joppa
[56:50] and he found a ship going to tarshish so
[56:52] he paid the fare and went
[56:53] down into it to go with them unto
[56:56] tarshish from the presence of the lord
[56:58] so he went down to joppa he found a ship
[57:01] going
[57:02] down to tarshish so he went into the
[57:04] boat and he went
[57:05] down and do you see the pattern here
[57:08] when you run from the presence of the
[57:10] lord you go
[57:11] down and you go down and your life goes
[57:13] down
[57:17] and god says to the believer your life
[57:18] isn't about going down it's about going
[57:21] up oh i just say
[57:24] lord jesus keep me going up i don't want
[57:27] to go down lord i want to ascend
[57:32] the bible says a fish comes along and
[57:34] swallows him and then jonah
[57:36] goes down to the bottom of the ocean
[57:40] down down down down god is sending jonah
[57:44] down to the depths the day he calls it
[57:47] in verse 2 the
[57:48] jonah chapter 2 verse 2 to the depths of
[57:51] sheol
[57:52] and this is what it means to jonah the
[57:54] belly of this well
[57:55] and let me say this to you my brother my
[57:57] sister when you are
[57:58] when you are running from a surrendered
[58:01] life from really surrendering everything
[58:03] you're going down
[58:06] you're not ascending you're descending
[58:10] spiritually
[58:15] the bible says then the mariners verse
[58:17] five
[58:18] then the mariners were afraid uh and
[58:21] and every man cried out to his god i may
[58:24] have the the verse
[58:25] here wrong and you're in chapter two
[58:27] sorry brother i messed you up by quoting
[58:29] chapter two verse chapter one
[58:30] it says then the the mariners were
[58:32] afraid and cried out cried
[58:35] every man i i want you to back up sorry
[58:38] to verse 4 so we get the context here
[58:41] the lord sent a great wind into the sea
[58:43] and there was a mighty temptus in the
[58:45] sea so that the ship
[58:46] was like to be broken verse 5 then the
[58:49] mariners were afraid
[58:51] every man cried out to his god and threw
[58:53] the cargo that was in the ship into the
[58:55] sea to lighten the load
[58:56] but jonah had gone down into the lowest
[58:59] part of the ship
[59:00] and laid down and was fallen asleep
[59:02] notice here's a here's a
[59:04] here's a believer the bible says these
[59:07] heathens are sensitive enough
[59:10] they're they're heathens they're not
[59:11] jews these are not worshippers of
[59:13] jehovah they're crying out the bible
[59:14] says every man to his own god
[59:16] but they know something's wrong they've
[59:19] realized something something something's
[59:20] amiss here the
[59:22] the storm's blowing a great wind is
[59:24] going but but
[59:25] but but now the bible says that here's
[59:27] here's the only
[59:28] vessel of the lord here's the only man
[59:31] who had contact with the only real true
[59:34] living god
[59:35] the heathens are crying out to their god
[59:38] they know
[59:39] something's wrong and they're crying out
[59:40] to their false gods while the man of god
[59:44] is asleep
[59:48] he's asleep fast asleep
[59:53] down jonah runs from the presence of the
[59:56] lord and he goes down
[59:57] to joppa he goes down to tarshish he
[1:00:00] goes
[1:00:01] down in the bottom of the boat and here
[1:00:04] these men are crying out to god and
[1:00:06] here's the only
[1:00:07] man here's the only man who could help
[1:00:09] here's the heathens crying out to god
[1:00:11] and here's the servant of the lord
[1:00:13] in the middle of all the calamity and
[1:00:14] the chaos jonah's just
[1:00:17] out he's out he's
[1:00:21] he's just he's there but he's not there
[1:00:25] you know you can be there but not really
[1:00:26] there
[1:00:28] you could be in church and not really
[1:00:30] there
[1:00:32] you could be in the family of god but
[1:00:34] you're not really there
[1:00:38] you could be absent you may your
[1:00:41] presence your person may be here but
[1:00:44] you jonah was absent he was in a stupor
[1:00:48] he's asleep the bible says he's asleep
[1:00:50] god says arise
[1:00:52] anyway and he gets up and he gets up but
[1:00:54] what does he do he only gets up just to
[1:00:55] run from the presence of the lord
[1:00:57] then he goes right back to sleep he goes
[1:00:59] right back to a stupor he goes right
[1:01:01] back to his slumber
[1:01:02] here these men are crying out to god and
[1:01:04] they say and cast the wares that were in
[1:01:07] the ship of the sea
[1:01:07] to lighten it of them but jonah was
[1:01:10] going down into the sides of the ship
[1:01:12] notice they're they're they're they're
[1:01:13] casting everything out they're they're
[1:01:15] throwing all the baggage out but you
[1:01:17] know what the heaviest baggage was
[1:01:22] the heaviest baggage was the man of god
[1:01:27] who was running from the presence of the
[1:01:28] lord you see when you're running from
[1:01:30] the presence of the lord
[1:01:31] you're a heavy burden to everybody else
[1:01:38] yeah a man a christian who runs from the
[1:01:42] presence of the lord
[1:01:43] who's running from the purpose of god
[1:01:45] whether he's a father and god's called
[1:01:47] him to be a godly example and a leader
[1:01:49] to those
[1:01:50] children and he's shirking his
[1:01:51] responsibility he's absent spiritually
[1:01:53] he's there physically he's very
[1:01:55] emotional he's there mentally he's there
[1:01:56] monetarily he's
[1:01:57] paying the bills but he's he's running
[1:02:00] from
[1:02:01] the calling that god has placed in his
[1:02:04] life to be a real
[1:02:05] spiritual leader that man his life
[1:02:08] if god puts a mission in his life and he
[1:02:10] runs from that calling
[1:02:11] you take a mother it doesn't matter what
[1:02:13] capacity we're serving in
[1:02:15] when we're when we when we are out of
[1:02:18] the order of
[1:02:19] god's calling in our life we are a
[1:02:22] burden to the whole situation
[1:02:26] you know i want to be careful how i say
[1:02:28] that because people could feel i just
[1:02:29] feel like i'm a burden to everybody look
[1:02:31] you know you know what then you do then
[1:02:33] arise thou that sleepest
[1:02:35] wake up
[1:02:39] it was the heathens but what's clear is
[1:02:41] that jonah
[1:02:42] jonah's he's in a stupor
[1:02:46] he's asleep he's just out of it he's
[1:02:48] just disconnected
[1:02:49] he's he's in slumber he's asleep you
[1:02:51] know
[1:02:52] we've preached on this one one other
[1:02:54] time before many months ago
[1:02:55] you know that slumber is a
[1:02:59] is a is a a spiritual condition
[1:03:03] that is referred to that would be unique
[1:03:06] to this age
[1:03:11] sleepy late lethargy
[1:03:14] now we're not talking about sleeping
[1:03:16] like some may be sleeping in church
[1:03:19] not talking about kind of sleeping or
[1:03:20] the sleeping that you're going to do
[1:03:21] tonight
[1:03:23] but the bible says there was a condition
[1:03:25] that would come in the last days that
[1:03:26] people be
[1:03:27] because of abounding iniquity
[1:03:30] because sin went about the love of many
[1:03:32] would grow cold it would wax cold
[1:03:35] first thessalonians 5
[1:03:39] 6. first thessalonians 5
[1:03:42] 6 therefore let us not
[1:03:45] sleep as do others who's us
[1:03:49] let us paul's speaking to believers
[1:03:52] therefore let us not sleep as do others
[1:03:56] but let us watch and be sober
[1:03:59] why brother matt why why be sober why do
[1:04:02] i get to be awake because there's a
[1:04:03] purpose
[1:04:04] there's a job to do for the believer
[1:04:07] there's a work to be done and so as we
[1:04:10] preached to you before
[1:04:11] he's saying be clear be sober be be be
[1:04:14] awake
[1:04:15] be there be present remain awake stay
[1:04:18] awake be watchful
[1:04:21] romans chapter 13 verse 11 the same
[1:04:24] exact thing you'll find he says in
[1:04:26] verse 11 of romans 13 and do this
[1:04:28] understanding the occasion the
[1:04:30] hour has come for you to wake up from
[1:04:34] your slumber
[1:04:37] pause that here for a moment brother
[1:04:39] branham says here in the message
[1:04:40] in the thigh tyrant church agent i know
[1:04:42] we've read this
[1:04:43] i want to give a warning right here i
[1:04:46] want to give a warning
[1:04:48] it says concerning the last days that
[1:04:51] because of abounding iniquity
[1:04:53] the love of many would wax cold in the
[1:04:55] lady you see in our last
[1:04:57] age now where that's the age you're in
[1:05:00] that is the age that you're in got many
[1:05:03] people preaching that we're in a bright
[1:05:05] age we are in a bright age
[1:05:07] but a bright age is not part of the
[1:05:08] church ages
[1:05:11] but you say brother matt then where are
[1:05:12] we we're still here in time
[1:05:16] now what's happened in your soul and i
[1:05:19] don't want to get bogged down on this
[1:05:20] but your soul here today you've been if
[1:05:23] you've been born of the spirit of god
[1:05:25] you're seated together in heavenly
[1:05:27] places in christ jesus
[1:05:29] yes you're not in lady asea as far as
[1:05:31] your soul goes but guess what your body
[1:05:33] is still
[1:05:34] here and the ladies in church age has
[1:05:38] not ended don't ever let anybody tell
[1:05:40] you that
[1:05:41] because here's why i know it's not even
[1:05:43] brother branham says that the church
[1:05:45] ages
[1:05:47] he says was the was the was the
[1:05:50] dispensation of the gentiles
[1:05:53] so the fullness of the gentile
[1:05:55] dispensation brother branham says
[1:05:57] happens in the ages
[1:06:00] and let me just tell you the gentile age
[1:06:03] thank god
[1:06:04] is not over yet
[1:06:07] if ladies see is over then the gentile
[1:06:09] age is over because brother adam says
[1:06:10] that's that's the
[1:06:11] the the dispensation of the gentiles
[1:06:13] happens in the latest scene
[1:06:14] brother man says what happens he says
[1:06:16] the rapture happens in the ladies and
[1:06:18] church age
[1:06:19] if if we're not in the latest in church
[1:06:21] age then we're then who's the messenger
[1:06:23] brother brandon was the messenger to the
[1:06:24] last lady seen church age
[1:06:26] i don't want to get bogged down on that
[1:06:27] here for a minute but you understand
[1:06:29] you're still here this is the age that
[1:06:33] we're in
[1:06:34] yes we've been called out of it yes
[1:06:36] christ has been put out of the church
[1:06:38] yes we're in a bright time yes we're in
[1:06:40] seed time yes you're in eagle time token
[1:06:42] time all of the above
[1:06:43] it's happening to the believer but yet
[1:06:45] our bodies our
[1:06:46] flesh that still gets a headache still
[1:06:48] gets sick still gets tired
[1:06:50] still gets angry upset depressed
[1:06:53] troubled and our spirit
[1:06:57] can become affected by the condition of
[1:07:01] this
[1:07:01] last age are you here
[1:07:06] he says he says in the ladies in her
[1:07:09] last age
[1:07:09] self-love the love for material things
[1:07:12] will take the place of the true love of
[1:07:14] god
[1:07:14] and then he says here's the warning we
[1:07:16] need here's what we need to do
[1:07:18] we need to guard against the power of
[1:07:20] sin in these last days
[1:07:23] so many are getting so hardened because
[1:07:26] they haven't
[1:07:26] realized the effect of this last day
[1:07:29] spirit
[1:07:31] and he says it's time to draw nigh to
[1:07:32] god and let him fill our lives
[1:07:34] yes lord with his love or we will fill
[1:07:38] the coldness of this last day church and
[1:07:40] reject the truth of god which alone
[1:07:42] is able to help us slumber was
[1:07:45] prophesied notice what the the scripture
[1:07:47] that you had up there brother in romans
[1:07:48] 13 verse 11
[1:07:50] and do this understanding the occasion
[1:07:54] in other words paul's saying realize
[1:07:56] where you're living
[1:07:58] realize you're in the last church age
[1:08:00] realize that you're at the end of the
[1:08:02] end of the
[1:08:02] end this is the end of the end time
[1:08:06] that's why you'll see the church age
[1:08:08] last days referred to in in the new
[1:08:09] testament
[1:08:10] church the last days has been happening
[1:08:12] for years but let me say something
[1:08:13] brother this is the last of the last
[1:08:15] days
[1:08:16] and knowing that he says know this
[1:08:19] knowing the time
[1:08:20] for that it is high time
[1:08:24] to awake out of sleep for now
[1:08:28] is our salvation nearer than when we
[1:08:30] believed my brother my sister
[1:08:32] it is time to wake up for now your
[1:08:34] salvation is nearer than it's ever been
[1:08:36] before
[1:08:40] another parable put forth this is
[1:08:42] matthew 13
[1:08:44] verse 24. this one just
[1:08:48] just affected me so much today
[1:08:51] when i read it now the parable put he
[1:08:54] forth to them say in the kingdom of
[1:08:56] heaven is liken unto a man who sowed
[1:08:58] good seed
[1:08:59] in his field but while men slept
[1:09:02] his enemy came and sowed tares among the
[1:09:06] wheat went his way but when the grain
[1:09:08] had sprouted and produced a crop
[1:09:11] then the tares also appeared i know the
[1:09:13] meaning of matthew 13
[1:09:15] but i want to just take just a compound
[1:09:17] meaning out of that
[1:09:18] he says he says here let me read it one
[1:09:20] more time verse 24.
[1:09:22] kingdom heaven's like it unto men and
[1:09:23] sowed good seed in this field but
[1:09:25] while men slept there it is slumber
[1:09:28] jonah what are you doing in the bottom
[1:09:30] of the boat you got a mission jonah
[1:09:31] you've got a call you've got an
[1:09:32] anointing there's a job to do jonah and
[1:09:34] you're at the bottom
[1:09:35] of the boat sleeping
[1:09:40] you're spiritually not at your post of
[1:09:42] duty what are you doing
[1:09:44] jonah jesus says
[1:09:47] it's like your kingdom of heaven is like
[1:09:48] an into a a a a
[1:09:50] a a man who sowed good seed in this
[1:09:52] field good seed
[1:09:54] but while men slept his enemy came and
[1:09:57] sowed
[1:09:58] let me just say this to you bad things
[1:10:01] happen when watchmen
[1:10:04] fall asleep
[1:10:10] terrors are sown
[1:10:14] when when when watchmen slumber
[1:10:20] and we finally wake up only to find
[1:10:23] there's tears everywhere in our life
[1:10:26] bad things happen when watchmen but when
[1:10:29] men fell asleep an enemy comes in
[1:10:31] let me just say this to you my brother
[1:10:32] my sister satan's eden is pressing at
[1:10:36] the door
[1:10:37] sodom is pressing at the door knocking
[1:10:40] on the door
[1:10:41] it's always all around us this entire
[1:10:43] condition of this age
[1:10:44] so you got to stay alert you got to stay
[1:10:46] awake you got to stay on guard you got
[1:10:47] to stay sober
[1:10:51] for the minute you fall asleep the
[1:10:52] devil's waiting just to come into your
[1:10:54] life and your family and wreck your home
[1:10:56] and wreck your marriage and
[1:10:58] wreck your children and wreck your mind
[1:11:01] he's waiting just for a moment to have
[1:11:03] access
[1:11:06] tears are sown while we slumber
[1:11:10] i i asked myself this hit me so hard
[1:11:13] today even as
[1:11:14] a as a husband as a father and i just
[1:11:17] i said how many things and i just asked
[1:11:20] myself this question
[1:11:21] in prayer i said lord how many things
[1:11:25] in my life in my children's life in my
[1:11:28] family's life
[1:11:29] how many things do i look at today and i
[1:11:32] and i and i think oh i wish that would
[1:11:34] i wish that wasn't there and then i
[1:11:36] realized they're only a reflection of
[1:11:38] the times when i was spiritually
[1:11:40] slumbering in my life
[1:11:43] are you here can we be honest is it just
[1:11:46] brother matt or is it all you too
[1:11:49] how many things do we look at in our
[1:11:51] life and they're a reflection
[1:11:52] of those times and those seasons when we
[1:11:54] were like jonah in the bottom of the
[1:11:57] boat and then we look around and go how
[1:12:00] did this how did the how whoa whoa
[1:12:02] whoa how do we get here
[1:12:05] and then you look back and you say oh
[1:12:07] just for that one moment just for that
[1:12:09] that time i lost my focus i lost just
[1:12:12] maybe the effect
[1:12:16] a reflection of times in our life
[1:12:20] when we're sleeping ephesians 5 14
[1:12:26] very simple simple instructions
[1:12:29] awake
[1:12:33] thou that sleepest
[1:12:36] and arise from the dead and christ
[1:12:40] shall give the light oh this is exactly
[1:12:43] what jonah says here in verse 10 of
[1:12:45] jonah chapter 1
[1:12:46] then were the men exceedingly afraid and
[1:12:48] said unto him why has thou done this
[1:12:50] for the men knew that they fled from the
[1:12:51] presence of the lord because he had told
[1:12:53] them
[1:12:54] he tells them why why is all this
[1:12:57] happening
[1:12:58] man of god and then he admits it well
[1:13:00] i'm running from the presence of the
[1:13:02] lord
[1:13:04] it shows that even these men the bible
[1:13:07] says then the men were exceedingly
[1:13:08] afraid and said to him
[1:13:10] why hast thou done this
[1:13:14] i just i chuckle when i read it because
[1:13:17] i realized here's these heathens
[1:13:19] and then they're looking they're about
[1:13:20] to die they're about to get
[1:13:23] some little you know storm but a great
[1:13:26] wind
[1:13:27] and they're saying why man why'd you do
[1:13:30] this
[1:13:32] what is it they realize all of this is
[1:13:34] happening because the son of god is out
[1:13:36] of his place
[1:13:37] out of order and they say why have you
[1:13:40] done this
[1:13:41] for the men knew that he fled from the
[1:13:42] presence of the lord because he told
[1:13:44] them
[1:13:46] that shows that the men were amazed that
[1:13:48] jonah would do something like this to
[1:13:50] just
[1:13:50] completely disagree disregard
[1:13:54] to completely disregard the presence of
[1:13:56] the lord
[1:13:57] they spent their life fearing their gods
[1:13:59] they didn't understand why you don't
[1:14:00] obey your god
[1:14:04] brother brandon preached is your life
[1:14:06] worthy of the gospel
[1:14:08] you imagine what what a rebuke that
[1:14:11] hears heathens
[1:14:13] saying hey we got our gods we obey our
[1:14:16] gods
[1:14:17] who's your god you're god's the only
[1:14:19] real god really
[1:14:20] and here you are in the boat
[1:14:28] not a full story in her life i just want
[1:14:29] to catch these quotes here before we
[1:14:31] miss them
[1:14:32] if you have that brother you guys do
[1:14:35] great back there wonderful job
[1:14:37] go back and forth and back and forth
[1:14:39] listen what brother branham says here
[1:14:40] say you haven't received the holy spirit
[1:14:42] something's wrong with your faith god
[1:14:43] circumcises the heart the minute the
[1:14:44] believer really
[1:14:45] comes in full surrender brother and says
[1:14:48] we try to live by this is the approach
[1:14:50] to god
[1:14:51] we try to live by the grace of god like
[1:14:53] christians ought to live the influence
[1:14:54] set before him
[1:14:56] i note if he was lost he'd certainly
[1:14:57] walk over righteous home now he's
[1:14:59] speaking of billy brother billy paul
[1:15:00] this is who brother madam is referring
[1:15:02] to here and he says
[1:15:04] we try to live by the grace of god like
[1:15:06] christians ought to live the influence
[1:15:07] set before him
[1:15:08] i knew if he was lost now this is what
[1:15:10] brother branham's confidence was
[1:15:12] because he's seeing billy paul and he's
[1:15:14] seeing how that billy's going astray
[1:15:16] and he's just a teenage boy at this time
[1:15:18] and he's and he knows he's going to a
[1:15:19] high school
[1:15:20] brother adam tells this story here and
[1:15:22] he's going to a high school and
[1:15:24] and he's praying lord don't let him get
[1:15:25] tangled up and get in the wrong crowd to
[1:15:26] get with the wrong people
[1:15:27] and brother madam's even praying he says
[1:15:29] i'd run to my car and i'd just sit there
[1:15:31] in my car
[1:15:31] take him to school and just pray over
[1:15:33] and say god keep him god protect him oh
[1:15:35] is that not the prayer that parents pray
[1:15:36] for their children
[1:15:39] and he's praying and he says oh he says
[1:15:41] here he says i
[1:15:42] knew if he was lost he'd certainly have
[1:15:45] to walk over a righteous home to be lost
[1:15:47] by
[1:15:48] and i want him to have to walk over my
[1:15:52] life what a prayer
[1:15:56] what a desire brother adam's saying
[1:15:59] he says i want him if he's going to go
[1:16:01] that way
[1:16:02] what was the prophet of god saying he
[1:16:04] said if my child is going to be lost i
[1:16:06] want to make sure that
[1:16:07] i did everything i possibly could
[1:16:11] to set the right example in front of him
[1:16:16] and if you're going to go that way or we
[1:16:18] ought we ought to be able to say that
[1:16:20] of our children if they're going to go
[1:16:22] they better have to come through
[1:16:23] they better have to climb over a cross
[1:16:27] he says he'd have to walk over my life
[1:16:30] and he'd have to walk over the bible
[1:16:32] he'd have to walk over the blood of
[1:16:34] christ because i'll certainly by god's
[1:16:36] grace presented
[1:16:38] in front of him say lord grant that
[1:16:43] granted lord let me present it before my
[1:16:46] family before my children
[1:16:49] he says that he says i'll certainly by
[1:16:51] god's grace present it
[1:16:53] but if his nature isn't changed he will
[1:16:55] go right on just the same
[1:16:57] and how i think of the day that billy
[1:16:59] entered high school how i thought
[1:17:00] oh my and knowing that he yet he had
[1:17:03] he'd been baptized
[1:17:05] certainly but had never made a
[1:17:09] full surrender you see you can be
[1:17:11] baptized and never make a full surrender
[1:17:14] and then brother brendan clarifies
[1:17:15] consecration to christ
[1:17:18] knowing that the nature of a child yet
[1:17:20] was in him how my heart yearned for him
[1:17:23] how i pray go out in my car and ride
[1:17:25] around and say god
[1:17:26] don't let my boy get wrapped up in that
[1:17:28] kind of stuff out there how that i said
[1:17:30] god i hope i pray his mother's dead i've
[1:17:32] been
[1:17:32] both daddy and mother to him so please
[1:17:34] don't let him get wrapped up out there
[1:17:36] and get in trouble some way will you
[1:17:38] just protect him lord
[1:17:43] when you fully this is this is that let
[1:17:45] me let me stop before i
[1:17:46] before i go to the next slide brother
[1:17:48] brandon begins to tell this and he says
[1:17:50] oh
[1:17:51] he says oh if i if i could just take the
[1:17:53] time this afternoon to show he says how
[1:17:54] many times though
[1:17:55] he says how many times the holy ghost
[1:17:57] just protected billy's life
[1:18:00] one was about to take a wrong turn why
[1:18:02] because he had a praying father
[1:18:04] remember what brother what the bible
[1:18:05] says about job but per adventure
[1:18:07] job would make a sacrifice for his
[1:18:08] children and he said per adventure
[1:18:11] they do something and they need
[1:18:12] forgiveness i'm just going to go ahead i
[1:18:14] don't know what's going to i'm just

[1:27:38] full surrender to god
[1:27:42] but you know you know you know who had
[1:27:44] made a full surrender
[1:27:45] daddy had made a full surrender
[1:27:52] we need parents with a full surrender to
[1:27:54] god
[1:27:56] we need a church with a full surrender
[1:27:58] to the holy spirit
[1:28:00] they say lord you know i've let go of
[1:28:02] everything lord i'm completely
[1:28:04] surrendered in the token when you fully
[1:28:06] obey the word of god

[1:28:19] but if you're a true christian
[1:28:22] truly cold like jonah was god had
[1:28:24] already got your fare paid
[1:28:26] get off that ship going to tarshish
[1:28:28] anyhow god predestinated you to this
[1:28:30] life
[1:28:31] yes sir if you're a true cold child of
[1:28:34] god come to christ

[1:28:42] if you came into the fullness of him
[1:28:46] and he says he says your way is paid to
[1:28:48] where it's paid to nineveh not the
[1:28:50] tarshish
[1:28:51] you're predestinated your ship there's a
[1:28:53] ship leaving right now
[1:28:55] on its road there's only one thing to do
[1:28:58] is get on it what is that ship full
[1:29:01] surrender
[1:29:05] you know and we're gonna we're not gonna
[1:29:07] be too much longer but you you think of
[1:29:08] that word surrender
[1:29:10] you you know what what does it even mean
[1:29:13] we raise
[1:29:13] even even when we raise our hands
[1:29:15] brother adam says what is it he says
[1:29:17] it's a sign it's a universal sign of
[1:29:18] surrender
[1:29:20] you know the enemy hey my hands are up
[1:29:22] i'd have nothing i'm you'd walk the
[1:29:24] police officer tells you to put your
[1:29:25] hands up you put them up
[1:29:26] what are you doing you're surrendering
[1:29:28] it's a full surrender
[1:29:30] you don't hold one hand down you don't
[1:29:32] halfway go up it's a full surrender
[1:29:35] you want to let him know i'm completely
[1:29:37] surrendered
[1:29:39] what is i in literally the word
[1:29:42] surrender means to give
[1:29:45] something up your rights
[1:29:49] you may give something up you may
[1:29:50] surrender something to another person
[1:29:52] but it means to relinquish
[1:29:56] something that you have
[1:30:00] right what are you doing when you're
[1:30:03] surrendering
[1:30:04] you're relinquishing something that you
[1:30:06] have
[1:30:07] but you've decided to surrender it
[1:30:11] and so what is a full surrender to god
[1:30:13] brother adam says
[1:30:14] america it's all about people's rights
[1:30:17] and he says but when you're really born
[1:30:18] of the spirit of god you get a lamb
[1:30:20] nature
[1:30:20] and what does a lamb do a sheep he says
[1:30:23] it gives up
[1:30:25] its rights hope you catch that
[1:30:28] he didn't say that the sheep doesn't
[1:30:30] have any rights
[1:30:34] but it surrenders its rights
[1:30:39] are you here are you still awake here
[1:30:40] tonight
[1:30:42] it surrenders its rights it gives it up
[1:30:46] it's giving something it's a surrendered
[1:30:49] life and you say what is a surrendered
[1:30:51] life it's the
[1:30:52] it's when a believer gives something
[1:30:54] they have
[1:30:56] it's when a believer takes something and
[1:30:58] they give it to the lord jesus they
[1:31:00] surrender their life to him

[1:34:03] 6 verse 38 you know this one very well
[1:34:06] he says for i came down from not to do
[1:34:09] my own will
[1:34:10] but the will of him that sent me
[1:34:15] he says in chapter eight he says not to
[1:34:16] have my own glory
[1:34:18] not to seek my own glory so he says in
[1:34:21] in in john chapter 8 verse 28
[1:34:24] i do nothing of myself
[1:34:30] i do nothing of myself
[1:34:33] but as my father hath taught me i speak
[1:34:37] these things look what verse 29 says
[1:34:41] it's emphasized and he that sent me is
[1:34:43] with me the father hath not left me
[1:34:44] alone for i
[1:34:46] do always those things that
[1:34:49] please him you know what you know what
[1:34:52] the lord is
[1:34:53] showing us what a surrendered life looks
[1:34:55] like
[1:34:59] you surrender i do only that which would
[1:35:01] that which pleases the father
[1:35:03] see brother matt do you do that no i
[1:35:04] don't but in the bottom of my heart i
[1:35:06] say lord
[1:35:07] grant it to me let me do only that which
[1:35:10] pleases you lord
[1:35:13] i only do that which pleases the father
[1:35:17] he says he he notice what he says here
[1:35:19] and remember this assumed this is a 100
[1:35:22] human his own humanity brother branham
[1:35:24] says he had to get past his own will his
[1:35:26] own desire what was the death he died
[1:35:28] prophet of god said he really died in
[1:35:30] gethsemane
[1:35:33] think about that just for a moment he
[1:35:34] really died in gethsemane
[1:35:38] the cross was the victory
[1:35:42] you know what the cross was the cross
[1:35:43] was just the victory it was
[1:35:45] it was the celebration of the battle
[1:35:47] that he won in gethsemane
[1:35:51] because the bible says what happened
[1:35:52] that gethsemane the garden
[1:35:54] of gethsemane it means the the olive the
[1:35:57] mount what was it it was the it was the
[1:35:59] crushing
[1:36:00] of what of he didn't he wasn't crucified
[1:36:03] there in in gethsemane his flesh wasn't
[1:36:06] but brother branham says his mind and
[1:36:07] his ambition and his desire he won the
[1:36:10] battle the greatest battle ever fought
[1:36:13] when he won the battle over self-will
[1:36:18] and he says if it be possible lord let
[1:36:22] this cup pass from me
[1:36:23] nevertheless my not
[1:36:26] my will be done but thy will be done
[1:36:29] lord
[1:36:31] i believe that you're catching it here
[1:36:33] tonight
[1:36:34] and john 10 verse 17 therefore doth my
[1:36:37] father love me because i lay down my
[1:36:39] life
[1:36:41] that i might take it again
[1:36:45] therefore doth my father love me because
[1:36:47] i lay down
[1:36:49] my life that i might take it
[1:36:52] again no man
[1:36:56] listen to what lord says no man taketh
[1:36:59] it
[1:37:00] from me but i lay it
[1:37:04] down of myself
[1:37:08] what is a full surrender when you can
[1:37:10] say no one forced me to do this
[1:37:12] no man takes it from me but lord you
[1:37:15] didn't you didn't force me but here's
[1:37:17] what i'm gonna do i'm gonna gladly lay
[1:37:19] it down lord
[1:37:20] i'm going to lay down my ambition i'm
[1:37:22] going to lay down my own life that's a
[1:37:24] full surrender
[1:37:26] when you can say no man taketh it from
[1:37:28] me but i of my own self
[1:37:31] and he says i have power to lay it down
[1:37:32] and i have power to take it again this
[1:37:34] commandment have i received of my father
[1:37:37] and you know who also has the power the
[1:37:39] lord left that power
[1:37:41] in your hands i'm speaking of a
[1:37:44] surrender here
[1:37:46] he says i'm gonna i'm gonna give you
[1:37:48] free moral agency you
[1:37:50] make a choice
[1:37:56] i'm choosing he says i no man taketh it
[1:37:59] from me but i lay it down
[1:38:01] of myself
[1:38:05] even had a choice he had a choice
[1:38:08] at a choice to as brother branham you
[1:38:11] remember the danny henry in the prophecy
[1:38:13] he says
[1:38:13] he says because thou has
[1:38:17] chosen the harder way because
[1:38:20] thou has chosen the harder way and he
[1:38:24] re-emphasizes this was of your own
[1:38:26] choosing you made this choice
[1:38:32] because of that a great portion of
[1:38:33] heaven awaits you because you chose and
[1:38:35] it's my way
[1:38:37] what was the emphasis on it this is your
[1:38:39] decision this is your choice this is not
[1:38:41] it didn't force you and what is the
[1:38:43] surrendered life when god really when
[1:38:45] you really surrender to the lord you
[1:38:47] give away yourself it's
[1:38:50] it's it's it's you relinquishing what is
[1:38:53] a surrender brother man how do i
[1:38:54] surrender to the lord
[1:38:56] you give up you say i lay down
[1:39:00] my life the privilege i have i choose
[1:39:03] a surrendered life no one's forced
[1:39:07] no one's pushed but you yield yourself
[1:39:10] to it you yield yourself to the holy
[1:39:15] spirit you
[1:39:16] yield yourself in prayer you yield
[1:39:18] yourself to the power of god
[1:39:20] you say lord i'm giving it to you i
[1:39:22] don't have to but i want to
[1:39:26] there's something in my heart i want to
[1:39:28] lord
[1:39:31] i want to i i i make this choice
[1:39:35] i i make this choice let me just say
[1:39:38] this to me
[1:39:39] to you my brother my sister you go as
[1:39:41] deep in
[1:39:42] in god as you want to go
[1:39:47] or you'll stay as shallow as you want to
[1:39:49] be
[1:39:53] notice what he says here this was even
[1:39:56] this goes further you say it was just
[1:39:58] jesus well that's not possible you know
[1:40:00] we're not jesus
[1:40:01] that was the you're speaking of well
[1:40:03] there's also a man named saul
[1:40:07] there's a man named saul who persecuted
[1:40:08] the church
[1:40:11] here's here's paul who's persecuting
[1:40:15] christ he
[1:40:16] he hated christians the man who was so
[1:40:20] self-elevated self-educated had such a
[1:40:23] high education
[1:40:25] he was he was he was persecuting the
[1:40:28] church and the bible says
[1:40:31] that he's he's he's a no doubt a learned
[1:40:33] man even paul speaks of that of himself
[1:40:35] i was on
[1:40:36] education ambitious he's he's climbing
[1:40:38] to the top
[1:40:39] you know he was just he was the he was
[1:40:41] the pharisee of what he calls
[1:40:43] of pharisees educated trained
[1:40:48] zealous and he says if any man
[1:40:52] labored he says not not more than me
[1:40:56] paul says no more not more than i it
[1:40:58] says i i was a pharisee of the pharisees
[1:41:03] paul was and paul was going his own
[1:41:05] direction his own
[1:41:07] way his own mission is all
[1:41:10] his own life everything was planned out
[1:41:14] knowing where he was going but yet
[1:41:17] the holy spirit one day
[1:41:21] knocked him off of his high horse
[1:41:26] you know what god has to get to you to
[1:41:27] come to a surrendered life sometimes
[1:41:28] he's got to knock you off your horse
[1:41:32] and paul hits the ground saul hits the
[1:41:34] ground and a light appears
[1:41:36] what is what is god doing god's taking
[1:41:38] this self-willed
[1:41:40] self-independent self-driven
[1:41:46] this man who was who was
[1:41:49] a a self-directed
[1:41:53] and he takes that highly esteemed
[1:41:57] educated man and he and he breaks him
[1:42:01] he breaks him of his human will and and
[1:42:04] he becomes
[1:42:06] one of the greatest examples of a man
[1:42:08] who has a surrendered life to the holy
[1:42:10] spirit
[1:42:13] who's completely surrendered to the
[1:42:14] purpose of god in his life
[1:42:18] he becomes one of the most surrendered
[1:42:21] vessels
[1:42:24] and he goes from independent to
[1:42:26] god-dependent
[1:42:28] he goes from man-filled to god-filled
[1:42:31] he goes from self-willed to god-willed
[1:42:35] he goes from self-led to god-led
[1:42:41] he says in first timothy 1 16 for this
[1:42:43] cause i obtained mercy
[1:42:45] that in me first jesus christ might show
[1:42:48] forth all longsuffering for a pattern
[1:42:50] this is first timothy 1 16 to them which
[1:42:53] should hear after believe own
[1:42:55] him to life everlasting
[1:42:59] god does something so great in his life
[1:43:02] the bible says here he's he's going on
[1:43:04] his own way on the road to damascus
[1:43:06] and then god a blinding light comes from
[1:43:08] heaven and he's knocked to the ground
[1:43:11] it says saul saul why persecute us thou
[1:43:13] me
[1:43:16] the holy spirit has a way only
[1:43:20] a way that only the holy spirit can do
[1:43:22] to humble us
[1:43:24] god has a way to humble us my dad has a
[1:43:27] famous saying it's
[1:43:28] it says you yourself if you're a child
[1:43:31] of god
[1:43:32] you either humble yourself or god will
[1:43:34] humiliate you
[1:43:36] to humble you
[1:43:41] and the bible says the bible says notice
[1:43:44] but here was here's he was such a such a
[1:43:47] a humiliating a humbling
[1:43:50] that paul comes out of it blind can't
[1:43:53] even see now here's a man who's led by
[1:43:54] his own two eyes you
[1:43:55] you imagine this what is it a sign of
[1:43:57] god's going to take all the leadership
[1:43:58] out of his own life
[1:44:00] now he's got to be led
[1:44:03] now he's blind the bible says in verse
[1:44:07] chapter 9 of acts
[1:44:10] verse 6 it says trembling and astonish
[1:44:14] paul said lord what will you have
[1:44:18] me to do no more self will no more self
[1:44:22] ambition no more what i'm gonna do
[1:44:24] he's just a blind man being led and says
[1:44:27] lord you know this is a sign the first
[1:44:29] act of a surrendered life when you can
[1:44:31] lose all your pride
[1:44:33] you could lose all of your all of you
[1:44:34] listen to me friends we've all got pride
[1:44:37] and pride is one of the most it's pride
[1:44:39] we have a all of us have a blind spot
[1:44:43] to pride it's one of the greatest blind
[1:44:46] spots
[1:44:46] brother arne we're fellowshipping about
[1:44:47] it today one of the greatest things
[1:44:49] christians are blind to you can spot
[1:44:51] pride in someone else but boy we're
[1:44:53] blind to it in our own self
[1:44:56] we fail to see it fail to see that
[1:44:59] that that that many of the times notice
[1:45:02] here here was paul in his own pride
[1:45:03] and the bible says god knocks him off of
[1:45:06] his high horse
[1:45:08] takes away all of his pride trembling
[1:45:11] and astonish paul says verse six
[1:45:13] lord what will you have me
[1:45:16] to do the lord said unto him
[1:45:20] arise there's that word get up
[1:45:25] get up and go into the city and shall be
[1:45:27] told thee what
[1:45:29] thou must do here's this highly
[1:45:32] educated pharisee of pharisees and now
[1:45:36] he's dumbstruck he's blind he can't even
[1:45:39] walk
[1:45:40] without being led takes him from here
[1:45:44] and god crushes him you say brother matt
[1:45:47] why would god do that because paul
[1:45:48] god needs to use paul and god's going to
[1:45:51] use him one of the most powerful
[1:45:53] greatest ways when paul
[1:45:54] can come to a surrendered a full
[1:45:58] surrender to god and god brings him to
[1:46:01] such a
[1:46:02] full he's a chosen vessel and god brings
[1:46:06] him to such
[1:46:07] a a low state in his life
[1:46:10] god's leading this high pomp
[1:46:13] high uh prestigious man to a life of
[1:46:17] surrender
[1:46:18] and he says lord what would you have me
[1:46:20] to do sometimes we just need to ask that
[1:46:22] quit trying to figure it out
[1:46:24] quit trying to figure it out and say
[1:46:25] lord what do you what will you have me
[1:46:27] do lord
[1:46:30] here's here's a question you asked to
[1:46:31] the lord how what can i do to please you
[1:46:34] lord
[1:46:39] what can i do to please you today lord
[1:46:45] you know when you ask that you know when
[1:46:47] you can ask that when nothing else
[1:46:49] matters
[1:46:51] that's when you can ask that when
[1:46:53] nothing else to you matters
[1:46:55] in your life of what you wake up in the
[1:46:57] morning and when nothing matters
[1:46:59] about that day except for what is going
[1:47:01] to please the lord that's when you can
[1:47:02] say lord what can i do today to please
[1:47:04] you
[1:47:04] because that's all that matters i just
[1:47:07] want to live a life that's pleasing to
[1:47:08] you
[1:47:10] does your heart say that tonight lord
[1:47:13] i just want to do whatever pleases you
[1:47:16] whatever pleases your holy spirit lord

[1:47:22] 15. brother

[1:47:27] he is a chosen vessel unto me the lord
[1:47:29] said to him go that way phrase a chosen
[1:47:31] vessel unto me to bear my name before

[1:47:35] and the children of israel for i will
[1:47:37] show him how great things he must
[1:47:40] suffer for my name's sake
[1:47:43] you know this is where a real
[1:47:44] surrendered life leads to and this is
[1:47:46] why so many people don't choose it

[1:47:51] and you're going to suffer many things
[1:47:54] oh but be but through your suffering

[1:51:44] jonah
[1:51:47] lord you
[1:51:51] jonah could have looked at it anyway
[1:51:52] jonah could have
[1:51:54] looked at the storm and said why is this
[1:51:56] happening
[1:51:58] i thought the lord loved me why is all
[1:52:00] this storm why all the chaos
[1:52:03] he could have thought when he was
[1:52:05] floating thrown overboard
[1:52:07] and he's his life's a wrecking and chaos
[1:52:09] he could have thought
[1:52:10] oh why am i going to the bottom of the
[1:52:11] sea why do i got to go and he's in the
[1:52:13] belly of a well
[1:52:15] he could have looked at all of the way
[1:52:16] he was so down and out
[1:52:18] lord but what it what it was was
[1:52:23] the grace of god in jonah's life
[1:52:27] that no matter how hard he tried to run
[1:52:29] from the presence of god you wouldn't
[1:52:31] let him get away
[1:52:33] and you won't let us get to tarshish
[1:52:34] lord you're going to turn us around at
[1:52:37] whatever cost that takes

[2:05:51] thing i'm trying to remember what the
[2:05:53] second thing was oh
[2:05:54] i wanted just to make this announcement
[2:05:56] that
[2:05:58] um and i know we we reiterate it we
[2:06:00] reiterate it we reiterate i want to
[2:06:02] just say it again thank you amen for
[2:06:05] your patience
[2:06:07] uh darren covid and the the way we've
[2:06:10] had to do rose and we've had to socially
[2:06:12] distance and the masks and
[2:06:14] all of all of the effort that's been put
[2:06:16] forth there
[2:06:17] and you know i i can just say this i
[2:06:19] just from uh from the
[2:06:21] from the brothers the ushers the deacons
[2:06:23] who's maybe at times especially on
[2:06:25] sunday morning who has to
[2:06:26] have to move us maybe move you around
[2:06:28] move you to a different seat
[2:06:30] i promise you they don't do that to
[2:06:32] upset you
[2:06:33] to move you out of your seat you've sat
[2:06:35] in for so many years or where you're
[2:06:37] comfortable in
[2:06:38] they're trying to do their best to
[2:06:39] accommodate
[2:06:41] the guidelines that we've set forth for
[2:06:43] them to do
[2:06:44] so i just i ask you for your grace
[2:06:48] amen the attitude of a christian if you
[2:06:50] get moved if you're asked to move
[2:06:52] hey no one's perfect except me no i'm
[2:06:56] just kidding none of us are perfect here
[2:06:59] not even the deacons believe it or not
[2:07:01] and sometimes then we may move you and
[2:07:03] move you to a spot and you think well
[2:07:04] they shouldn't then that it wasn't
[2:07:05] better would have been better than this
[2:07:06] well
[2:07:07] you know those brothers are doing their
[2:07:08] best amen and
[2:07:10] and i i just want to say i appreciate
[2:07:12] all of those
[2:07:14] brothers who help to usher and to see
[2:07:16] people try to get it right
[2:07:18] um we want to and and and
[2:07:22] brother ed is going to make an
[2:07:24] announcement concerning this but i just
[2:07:26] want to go ahead and preempt it by
[2:07:27] saying
[2:07:28] we're gonna we're going to do some
[2:07:30] little small changes
[2:07:32] um in the way we're doing seating right
[2:07:35] now
[2:07:36] um with the back few rows
[2:07:39] for mothers with small children and
[2:07:42] we want to reserve those back just the
[2:07:44] back two rows there
[2:07:46] for mothers with small children now you
[2:07:49] may have teenagers
[2:07:50] and then you also have a small child and
[2:07:52] that's perfectly fine that family would
[2:07:54] be perfectly
[2:07:55] fine to sit there in those back couple
[2:07:56] rows but we want to do that because they
[2:07:59] would have to maybe get up
[2:08:01] and go out and to cause the least amount
[2:08:02] of distraction amen we want to do that
[2:08:05] i'd encourage now i wouldn't force this
[2:08:07] force anybody to do it
[2:08:09] i'd encourage the young people
[2:08:10] especially the brothers
[2:08:12] sit up on the first few rows
[2:08:13] [Music]
[2:08:15] no i'm not going to make anybody do that
[2:08:17] i don't want anybody to make anybody do
[2:08:18] that
[2:08:19] but i think you young men you'd receive
[2:08:21] a blessing from that leave your children
[2:08:23] receive a blessing from that stay closer
[2:08:25] brother and even talked about that he
[2:08:26] said the anointing of god comes from the
[2:08:28] pulpit flows down
[2:08:29] and the closer you are the closer you
[2:08:31] are the more you feel it
[2:08:33] i promise you the closer you are the
[2:08:35] less distracted you are
[2:08:38] now i'm not talking about being right up
[2:08:39] here in spitting range but if you're
[2:08:40] back there
[2:08:42] you know in the front couple rows there
[2:08:44] and you're up close
[2:08:46] amen i i believe it does something good
[2:08:48] especially for young people
[2:08:50] so uh you know but if a family feels
[2:08:52] they want their child to sit with them
[2:08:53] maybe on the back row
[2:08:55] and you're there and you have a small
[2:08:56] child i understand that that's perfectly
[2:08:58] fine
[2:08:58] and we're not going to disrupt any of
[2:09:00] that but we would like the last two rows
[2:09:05] to be reserved for mothers with small
[2:09:08] children
[2:09:08] amen and then from there we'll distance
[2:09:11] we also have some other things
[2:09:12] we've got the johnsons here the roberts
[2:09:14] we've got big families
[2:09:16] sometimes it's hard to see an entire
[2:09:17] family on one row so we've got some
[2:09:19] plans for that
[2:09:20] i'm not gonna uh say anything i'll leave
[2:09:22] that for brother ed
[2:09:23] um but who's gonna make an announcement
[2:09:25] concerning that you love the lord
[2:09:27] raise your hand if you do say lord i
[2:09:29] love you amen
[2:09:31] praise the lord brother peter sing for
[2:09:33] us god bless you you're dismissed
