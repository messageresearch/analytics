[29:38] as she made her way
[29:40] to jesus

[29:47] her blind
[29:52] she felt such pain
[29:57] some spoken anger
[30:00] heard folks whisper
[30:02] there's no place here
[30:05] for her
[30:06] kind high
[30:09] still alone she came
[30:13] through the shame that flushed her face
[30:16] until at last
[30:19] she'd knelt before his feet
[30:25] and though she spoke no words
[30:29] everything she said was her
[30:33] as she poured out all for her master
[30:38] from her box of alabaster

[32:12] measure
[32:13] into a little treasure box

[32:22] until the day
[32:25] when jesus came to me he held my soul
[32:30] with the wonder of his touch
[32:35] oh and now i'm giving back to him all
[32:40] the praise

[1:25:37] don't know that i've heard that many
[1:25:39] people clapping that well
[1:25:41] but there must be something about those
[1:25:43] muscles and bones that connect to your
[1:25:45] hands when you clap
[1:25:47] it freed up your voices maybe it freed
[1:25:50] up the man down on the inside
[1:25:54] praising saints
[1:25:56] now you know we've been taught there
[1:25:58] were poets
[1:26:01] now that god has his men who can
[1:26:04] you know and it seems for those of us
[1:26:06] who don't have that ability they just
[1:26:08] reach out into the ether
[1:26:10] and they grab those inspirations that
[1:26:13] father sends by
[1:26:15] and tonight we'd like to acknowledge
[1:26:18] a couple of those men first we like to
[1:26:20] acknowledge brother terry tidwell
[1:26:24] these are going to be some of his songs
[1:26:28] not his songs but the songs that the
[1:26:30] lord
[1:26:31] let just run through those connections
[1:26:34] in his fingers so brother terry if
[1:26:36] you're watching on the stream
[1:26:38] god bless you tonight
[1:26:41] thrill
[1:26:42] in the same way that we're thrilled by
[1:26:45] what those songs spoke to the children
[1:26:47] of god
