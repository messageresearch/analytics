[26:26] service
[26:28] thank
[26:29] you we're we're going to sing a song
[26:33] that I don't think anyone knows I'm not
[26:35] sure we do so it's better that we go
[26:50] Acappella I'll be putting the words up
[26:52] as we sing yeah that's good right there
[26:55] this this song that's for
[26:59] you this song came to my mind when
[27:02] brother Daniel was speaking to us on
[27:05] Sunday morning about uh about the three
[27:08] young men in Babylon that went into the
[27:10] fiery furnace rather than worship and
[27:12] Idol and the first verse talks about
[27:15] that the second verse talks a bit about
[27:17] the people that are in the first part of
[27:19] the book of Acts about Peter and James
[27:22] and John uh James being one of the the
[27:27] first Mars of the church and and Peter
[27:29] and John uh being very involved in the
[27:33] in the early days of the church there
[27:35] the third verse I think identifies a lot
[27:38] with Paul the Paul of Acts chapter 21
[27:42] which we're going to conclude tonight
[27:44] and in the chorus we can see the reason
[27:48] for the persecution of the church so you
[27:52] you pray for us as we as we try to do
[27:56] this three Hebrew children in Babylon
[28:00] back in the long
[28:02] ago they would not worship Idol to the
[28:07] furnace they would go but when the king
[28:11] did look inside he saw the Fourth Man to
[28:16] it was Jesus my Lord and my God he is
[28:21] the Alpha and Omega the beginning and
[28:25] the end he's the Great I am the Prince
[28:29] of Peace God's fullness dwells in him he
[28:33] wonderful the counselor the Mighty God
[28:37] is he he is Jesus my Lord and my
[28:43] God Peter James and John were led to a
[28:47] high mountain
[28:49] apart Moses and Elijah God's glory did
[28:55] impart but when they lifted up their
[28:59] eyes the prophets both were gone they
[29:02] saw Jesus my Lord and my God he is the
[29:07] Alpha and Omega the beginning and the
[29:11] end he's The Great I Am The Prince of
[29:14] Peace God's fullness dwells in him he
[29:18] wonderful the counselor the Mighty God
[29:22] is he he is Jesus my Lord and my God
[29:28] my way had grown so
[29:32] weary My Body all bent and
[29:37] tired I tried to walk as Jesus walked
[29:42] though often I was
[29:45] tried but one day there will be no pain
[29:51] all sorrow will pass away when I see
[29:56] Jesus my Lord and my God he is the Alpha
[30:00] and Omega the beginning and the end he's
[30:05] The Great I Am The Prince of Peace God's
[30:08] fullness dwells in him he wonderful the
[30:13] counselor the Mighty God is he he is
[30:17] Jesus my Lord and my God he is
[30:23] Jesus my Lord and my God
[30:29] [Applause]
[30:38] I got to get back to my
[30:40] script good evening that that's where we
[30:43] start tonight we continue our study the
[30:46] book of Acts this time finishing chapter
[30:49] 21 it covers the events that
[30:52] transpire over Paul's first week or so
[30:54] after having arrived in Jerusalem with
[30:56] the expectation that there would be
[30:59] trouble the Jewish people would put him
[31:02] in the hands of the Gentile
[31:05] authorities before we open our Bibles
[31:08] let's pray together to the
[31:10] author Lord Jesus we're gathered tonight
[31:14] together as a portion of the body of
[31:17] Christ purchased by your blood on
[31:18] Calvary filled with your spirit Lord
[31:21] Lord we desire to hear from you we'll be
[31:23] reading from your word Lord and we pray
[31:26] Lord that these thoughts that are
[31:28] expressed tonight Lord that you'd guard
[31:30] my lips Lord and that you'd guard the
[31:31] ears of the hearers Lord that no one
[31:34] stumble or be misled Lord that I don't
[31:36] misspeak or say something that would be
[31:38] displeasing but Lord that it would just
[31:40] draw us all closer together and help us
[31:42] to realize more and more your grace in
[31:45] our lives Lord and the and the wonderful
[31:48] wonderful thing that you did in the book
[31:50] of Acts to give us a pattern a template
[31:53] a way to know how we're to act in our
[31:55] day we thank you for this this
[31:57] opportunity to be together and we commit
[31:59] the remainder of this service into your
[32:01] hands in Jesus precious name
[32:06] amen you may notice I I closed my eye a
[32:09] little bit yesterday I had cataract
[32:11] surgery and today the uh the I went to
[32:14] the opthalmologist and he put all those
[32:16] drops on my eyes that make my pupils get
[32:18] real big and so it's uh that's a little
[32:21] disconcerting so if I wind up doing this
[32:24] you know that I'm not winking at
[32:26] somebody I'm just uh trying to deal with
[32:29] the the brightness and the
[32:31] glare so if if if we could stand because
[32:35] we're going to read from the
[32:37] word for our topic verse we'll read from
[32:41] acts but we're going to read from
[32:43] chapter 26 where Paul's giving a
[32:46] testimony at his own
[32:48] trial he says I verily thought with
[32:52] myself I I I was convinced that I ought
[32:54] to do many things contrary to in the
[32:57] name of Jesus of Nazareth do do as much
[32:59] as I could to oppose this heretical
[33:04] sect which thing I also did w that's
[33:07] just what I did in Jerusalem and many of
[33:10] the Saints people I now recognize as
[33:12] fellow Believers did I shut up in prison
[33:15] having received Authority from the chief
[33:17] priests and they were put to death I
[33:20] gave my votes my vote I I cast my vote
[33:25] against them cons en senting to Steven's
[33:28] death sentent in Acts 7 meant more than
[33:30] just agreeing he voted for Steven to be
[33:34] put to death standing over the coats of
[33:37] them that stone Steven was not an
[33:38] isolated act Paul was busy imprisoning
[33:43] and assisting in the deaths of many of
[33:45] the early Believers in
[33:47] Christ and I punished them of frequently
[33:52] I was zealous in every synagogue and
[33:54] compelled them to Blas
[33:58] ah what is the blasphemy that they
[34:03] uttered and being exceedingly mad wild
[34:06] with Fury violently opposed against them
[34:09] I persecuted them even unto strange
[34:12] cities foreign cities beyond the borders
[34:15] of the province of
[34:17] Judea please be
[34:20] seated our opening verses from acts
[34:24] record Paul confessing at a trial in
[34:27] this case before King Herod a grippa II
[34:29] some two years after the events of Acts
[34:32] 21 that he's guilty of persecuting the
[34:35] early
[34:36] Believers he admits to testifying
[34:39] against multiple people that were put to
[34:42] death if we were to read slightly
[34:44] further we'd see that he's leading up to
[34:46] recounting his meeting the Lord as he
[34:48] approached the city of Damascus and
[34:50] pursuit of the followers of Jesus now
[34:55] you may be one com to
[34:58] ask brother ly so what is it about these
[35:01] early Believers that so enraged Saul the
[35:05] Pharisee but which he later practiced
[35:08] openly as Paul the Apostle what is the
[35:13] blasphemy is it the same thing that will
[35:15] result in his troubles in Jerusalem in
[35:18] Acts 21 some 25 years after the birth of
[35:21] the Christian faith on that fateful
[35:23] Pentecost of Acts chapter
[35:25] 2
[35:27] whoa thank you those are great questions
[35:30] thank you for
[35:32] asking keep those questions in mind as
[35:35] you read from acts 21 this evening with
[35:37] the Lord's help we'll find the answers
[35:41] in the pages of our
[35:42] Bibles we'll back up just a bit from
[35:45] where we left off last time as we start
[35:48] reading in Acts
[35:49] 21 Paul and Luke and Company have left
[35:52] the home of Philip the Evangelist one of
[35:55] the original 7D deacons and are coming
[35:58] from cesaria to Jerusalem this is near
[36:01] probably just a few days after
[36:03] Pentecost
[36:05] Pentecost the Feast of Weeks the
[36:08] traditional day when Moses received the
[36:10] law in Mount Si the traditional birthday
[36:14] and anniversary of the death of King
[36:17] David and the date that marked the birth
[36:21] of the Christian Church acts
[36:25] 21:17 and one when we were come to
[36:28] Jerusalem the Brethren received us
[36:30] gladly oh they were happy to see us they
[36:33] welcomed us and the day following Paul
[36:38] went in with us unto James and all the
[36:40] elders were
[36:42] present and when Paul had saluted had
[36:45] greeted them he declared particularly he
[36:49] recounted and some detail what things
[36:53] God had wrought among the Gentiles by
[36:57] his
[36:58] ministry and when they heard it Paul's
[37:02] detailed report about the gospel among
[37:05] the Gentiles of galatia Asia Macedonia
[37:10] Greece
[37:11] AA they glorified the Lord up to this
[37:15] point all is well and James and the
[37:19] elders said unto Paul thou seest brother
[37:23] how many thousands of Jews there are
[37:26] which believe
[37:27] we're a large assembly perhaps the
[37:30] largest in the world and we're Jews not
[37:34] Gentiles and they this massive assembly
[37:38] are all zealous of the law we love our
[37:41] rules the law of Moses the laws handed
[37:45] down at SI some 1500 years ago and they
[37:50] this assembly of thousands of Jewish
[37:52] followers of Jesus are informed of Thee
[37:56] they've heard rumors they they saw it on
[37:59] face scroll with with their ey stones or
[38:03] perhaps just through plain old gossip
[38:06] and many are convinced as a result of
[38:08] listening to these tales that thou
[38:10] teachest all the Jews which are among
[38:12] the Gentiles to forsake moses' law
[38:16] saying they ought not to circumcise
[38:18] their children neither to walk after the
[38:23] Customs last week I mentioned I got
[38:27] upset with James and the elders when I
[38:29] read this verse it was the last verse we
[38:31] read last time oops that's my
[38:35] bad I need to learn from it but not to
[38:39] be
[38:40] judgmental these were sincere Brothers
[38:43] they were doing the best they could
[38:45] following the leading of the Lord in
[38:48] their
[38:50] lives I assume that you accepted your
[38:52] mission from last week and read Romans
[38:55] 4: 1- 12 about circumcision what Paul
[38:58] had to say about it and I'm sure you're
[39:01] aware of another strange association
[39:04] with this charge in fact circumcision
[39:08] was instituted with Abraham not Moses
[39:12] about 600 years before The Exodus in
[39:15] Genesis 17 we read and God said unto
[39:20] Moses that's not how you spell Moses no
[39:24] God said unto Abraham Thou shalt keep my
[39:26] Covenant therefore and thy seed your
[39:28] descendants after thee in their
[39:30] generations for all time this is my
[39:33] Covenant which ye shall
[39:36] keep it's not optional shall keep
[39:40] between me and you and thy seed after
[39:42] thee all your descendants every Manch
[39:44] child among you shall be circumcised
[39:47] skipping to verse 14 and just how
[39:50] important is this the uncircumcised
[39:53] Manchild whose flesh of his foreskin is
[39:56] not circumcised that Soul shall be cut
[39:58] off from his people he hath broken my
[40:06] Covenant in the five books of Moses the
[40:09] words circumcise circumcision and
[40:12] circumcised mostly appear in Genesis
[40:15] prior to the giving of the law on Mount
[40:19] Si it occurs two times in Exodus
[40:22] regarding who may eat Passover it occurs
[40:24] once in Leviticus that a male child is
[40:26] to be circumcised on the Eighth Day in
[40:30] Deuteronomy the only mention is in
[40:32] conjunction with circumcising the heart
[40:34] not the
[40:36] Flesh and Moses did not observe or
[40:40] enforce the observance of this
[40:43] commandment nor did Aaron and the rest
[40:45] of the priests for that
[40:47] matter how can you say that brother life
[40:50] how do we know this Joshua chapter 5
[40:52] this is this is at that time it says
[40:54] this is after they had crossed Jordan
[40:56] the the priest had carried the ark the
[40:58] water stood back the whole throng of
[41:01] people that had been wandering for 40
[41:02] years in the desert they came across the
[41:05] Jordan the priest came out the waters
[41:07] were
[41:08] closed and at that time after this
[41:10] miraculous thing the Lord said unto
[41:12] Joshua make the sharp knives and
[41:15] circumcise again the children of Israel
[41:17] the second time and that means this
[41:19] second generation skipping down to verse
[41:22] 6
[41:23] for for the children of Israel walked 40
[41:27] years in the wilderness till all the
[41:29] people that were Men of War which came
[41:31] out of Egypt were consumed except Joshua
[41:34] and Caleb because they obeyed not the
[41:36] voice of the Lord to take the
[41:39] land and their children whom he the Lord
[41:43] raised up in their stead them
[41:47] Moses no them Joshua circumcised for
[41:52] they were uncircumcised because they had
[41:54] not circumcised them by the away for 40
[41:57] years they'd ignored that commandment
[42:00] for 40 years it seems to Jewish
[42:03] Christians in Jerusalem but the time of
[42:05] Acts 21 could have used a better example
[42:07] to illustrate the law of Moses in
[42:09] circumcision or at least attributed it
[42:11] to
[42:13] Abraham but I suspect they were more
[42:16] concerned with Customs Traditions
[42:19] familiar and comfortable to them
[42:21] practices keeping those practices living
[42:24] in Jerusalem in the shadow of of the
[42:26] temple would make their lives a lot less
[42:29] stressful with their fellow Jews who are
[42:31] not followers of Jesus you can sort of
[42:34] hear them hey well we're still Jews we
[42:37] do all 613 Commandments and then some we
[42:40] just happen to believe Jesus was the
[42:42] promised Messiah and we'll prove it soon
[42:44] enough because he's going to come back
[42:47] any day now right through that Eastern
[42:49] Gate right there not only that we've
[42:53] heard he said some of his disciples
[42:54] would still be alive at that that time
[42:57] more rumors you watch and see if we're
[43:00] not right
[43:02] oops well last week we talked about
[43:06] customs and traditions and what Jesus
[43:08] said about them in their relative
[43:10] importance a sort of a one verse
[43:12] summary Mark 7 how be it in vain do they
[43:16] worship me teaching for
[43:19] doctrines the Commandments the Customs
[43:22] the traditions of
[43:24] man today
[43:26] we need to be very careful that we don't
[43:29] confuse our customs what I sometimes
[43:31] call message Orthodoxy with Doctrine or
[43:36] scripture piecing together random verses
[43:39] or various quotes from different sermons
[43:41] to justify some opinion or claimed
[43:45] Revelation and to never judge others
[43:48] either on observance or non-observance
[43:50] of such Customs especially on the basis
[43:53] of rumors or posts on social
[43:57] media I know calm down ly breathe
[44:01] in hold
[44:03] it breathe
[44:06] out okay back to Paul in Jerusalem and
[44:10] moving on to the second half of Acts
[44:14] 21 so these are the elders then talking
[44:18] to Paul oh what is it therefore what are
[44:21] we going to do the multitude of Jewish
[44:23] Believers here in Jerusalem must need
[44:26] needs will undoubtedly come together for
[44:28] they'll hear that you're here it's been
[44:30] all over face scroll and and eventual
[44:34] gram do therefore this that we say to
[44:37] thee here's how we want to deal with
[44:40] this problem of the rumor mill Paul we
[44:42] have four men which have a vow on them
[44:47] in fact this is a Nazarite vow it's
[44:50] according to the law numbers 6 veres 1-
[44:53] 21 it's a vow that requires shaving
[44:56] one's head at the conclusion of it which
[44:58] is how we know that it's a azerite
[45:01] vow he's told take them and purify
[45:05] themsel with them and be at charges with
[45:08] them that they may shave their heads
[45:11] that's a Kind of a Funny expression be
[45:14] at charges with them what they're
[45:16] telling Paul
[45:18] is pay the
[45:20] barber pay the charges pay the priest
[45:22] that's going to shave their heads with
[45:24] this ceremony
[45:27] and all of our assembly may know that
[45:29] those rumors that they've been informed
[45:32] concerning the are are nothing but
[45:34] rumors and that thou thyself also walst
[45:37] orderly and keepest the
[45:39] law Paul here at
[45:42] you reminds me of Peter and Paul in the
[45:45] Church of Antioch and Syria when Peter
[45:47] for fear of the Jewish believers who
[45:49] were coming from Jerusalem mm Jerusalem
[45:53] suddenly stopped eating with the
[45:55] Gentiles and Paul called him out in
[45:56] front of everyone in this case the
[45:59] leaders of the church in Jerusalem are
[46:00] asking Paul to do something that it's
[46:03] okay and Paul will do it in
[46:06] sincerity but it still makes me a little
[46:09] angry that they asked him to do this at
[46:11] all not with bad intent just as an
[46:14] expedient way to help quash rumors
[46:16] passing through the
[46:21] congregation what it say Lyall calm down
[46:24] breathe yeah okay did they really think
[46:27] that the people that didn't like Paul
[46:29] the people that were listening to these
[46:31] rumors and believe them would accept
[46:33] Paul doing this one thing and say oh
[46:36] everything we've heard it must be false
[46:37] look Paul's one of
[46:40] really really
[46:43] well you may recall from last week that
[46:47] Paul had written the epistle to the
[46:49] Romans while in Corinth towards the end
[46:52] of his third missionary journey he was
[46:54] expecting to board a ship for Judea and
[46:56] go to Jerusalem but in order to thwart
[46:59] an ambush remember he was carrying a
[47:01] large collection back to Judea to
[47:03] Jerusalem he changed his plans and
[47:06] traveled Overland to Asia instead where
[47:08] he told the Elders of Ephesus in Acts
[47:12] 20 and now behold I go Bound in the
[47:16] spirit unto Jerusalem not knowing the
[47:19] things that shall befall me there save
[47:23] that the Holy Ghost Witnesses in every
[47:25] city
[47:26] saying that bonds and afflictions abide
[47:30] me so with these warnings in mind Paul
[47:35] had written to the Romans knowing that
[47:37] letter would get there before he got to
[47:38] Jerusalem and he'd asked them he said
[47:41] now I beseech you Brethren I beg you I
[47:44] plead with you for the sake of the Lord
[47:47] Jesus Christ for the love of the spirit
[47:50] that you strive together with me fight
[47:54] on my behalf
[47:56] strive struggle fight in your prayers to
[48:01] God for me not just oh Lord bless our
[48:05] brother Paul as he goes to Jerusalem
[48:07] amen no strive struggle fight in your
[48:11] prayers for him and and by this he
[48:13] doesn't mean you've got to get all
[48:14] emotional you if if you don't cry if you
[48:17] don't have tears your prayers just
[48:19] aren't sincere enough he's not talking
[48:21] about
[48:22] that he's
[48:24] saying earnestly
[48:26] regularly remember him in your prayers
[48:30] don't forget him he'll be facing a very
[48:33] difficult time he needs to know that
[48:36] you're standing with him supporting him
[48:39] in your earnest prayers to God on his
[48:42] behalf why that I may be delivered from
[48:46] them that do not believe in
[48:50] Judea and that my service which I have
[48:53] for Jerusalem this offering that I'm
[48:55] bringing to the churches may be accepted
[48:58] of the
[49:00] Saints Paul remembers the rejection he
[49:03] had when he first came to
[49:06] Jerusalem Barnabas had to intervene for
[49:09] him and as he was involved in the
[49:11] persecution and death of many in
[49:15] Jerusalem there are many deep-seated
[49:17] hostile feelings toward him Jerusalem's
[49:21] not a comfortable place for Paul to be
[49:23] in any case especially in light of All
[49:26] These Warnings as he makes his way
[49:29] there Paul knows very well that it's the
[49:32] spirit of antichrist is opposing him not
[49:34] the Antichrist we think of in Revelation
[49:37] but but Satan and his angels that Spirit
[49:40] he will later write to the church at
[49:42] ephes Ephesus in Ephesians 612 we
[49:45] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[49:49] against principalities against Powers
[49:52] against the rulers of the darkness of
[49:54] this world against
[49:56] spiritual wickedness in high
[50:00] places I was struck by some of the
[50:03] scriptures brother Daniel read Sunday
[50:05] morning from Romans chapter
[50:07] 8 I want to remind you of some of them
[50:10] and expand just a little bit and
[50:12] especially want you to listen to these
[50:14] verses in light of what you know about
[50:17] the context Paul is writing this letter
[50:20] to the Romans from Corinth he's had
[50:23] These Warnings he's preparing to go to
[50:26] Jerusalem where he's consistently told
[50:29] serious persecution awaits him there
[50:33] Romans 8:35 he says who what shall
[50:37] separate us from the love of Christ in
[50:40] other words can anything separate us
[50:43] from Christ's love does it mean he no
[50:46] longer loves us if we experience
[50:48] tribulation or distress or
[50:52] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[50:57] Peril or sword Paul's experienced all of
[51:01] these things as it is written for thy
[51:04] sake we are killed all the day long we
[51:08] are
[51:09] accounted as sheep for the
[51:12] slaughter that's Psalms
[51:16] 44:22 says no in all these things in
[51:20] spite of all of this we are more than
[51:24] conquerors more than conquerors
[51:26] overwhelming Victory Is Ours through
[51:30] Jesus Christ that loved us for I'm
[51:34] persuaded I'm convinced that neither
[51:37] death nor life nor angels nor
[51:41] principalities nor
[51:43] powers nor things
[51:45] present nor things to come the
[51:48] persecution that aits me in Jerusalem
[51:50] nor height the the powers in the heavens
[51:53] above nor depth powers in the Earth
[51:55] Earth beneath or any other created thing
[51:59] shall be able has the power to separate
[52:03] us from the love of God which is in
[52:06] Christ Jesus our
[52:10] lord and if we move back a couple of
[52:12] verses one that we're so familiar with
[52:15] Romans 8:28 the context of when he's
[52:18] writing this we know that all things
[52:21] work together for good to them that love
[52:25] God
[52:25] to them who are the called according to
[52:28] his
[52:30] purpose Paul writes this encouragement
[52:33] to us and light of the dark times that
[52:36] lie ahead for him which he knows he's
[52:40] walking into like Jesus asking his
[52:44] disciples to watch with him in
[52:46] Gethsemane Paul's asking the Romans to
[52:48] pray for him as he heads for the very
[52:52] same
[52:54] Jerusalem
[52:56] back to acts
[52:57] 21 and the elders there speaking to
[53:06] Paul they continue on uh it's touching
[53:09] the Gentiles which believe we have
[53:12] written and concluded that they observe
[53:14] No Such Thing save only that they keep
[53:17] themselves from things offered to Idols
[53:18] from blood from strangled from
[53:22] fornication then Paul agreed to their
[53:25] request he acceded to what they wanted
[53:28] he took the men and the next day
[53:32] purifying himself with them go probably
[53:35] going through a Mikel one of the pools
[53:37] that Herod had constructed outside the
[53:39] temple
[53:40] perhaps he entered into the temple to
[53:43] signify the accomplishment of the days
[53:45] of
[53:46] purification until that an offering
[53:49] should be offered for every one of
[53:52] them and when the seven days of this
[53:55] process were almost
[53:58] ended the Jews which were of
[54:01] Asia this is they're from
[54:05] Ephesus how do we know they recognized
[54:08] Paul Ephesus is the only place that he
[54:11] spent much time in
[54:13] Asia when they saw him when they saw
[54:16] Paul in the
[54:18] temple they were filled with rage
[54:21] against him and they stirred up all the
[54:24] people
[54:26] and laid hands on him not to pray for
[54:29] him not to impart a
[54:31] blessing no remember remember those guys
[54:36] in the synagogue at Ephesus the ones
[54:39] that spoke evil of Paul and hounded him
[54:42] as we studied in Acts 19: 8 and
[54:46] N Paul went into the synagogue at
[54:49] Ephesus spake boldly for the space of
[54:53] three months disput in and persuading
[54:56] the things concerning the kingdom of
[55:00] God but when diverse were hardened when
[55:03] some just wouldn't listen they couldn't
[55:06] defend their
[55:07] interpretations but they were unwilling
[55:10] to change unwilling to be convinced that
[55:13] they were wrong and beli
[55:16] not but spake evil of that way that that
[55:19] way being Christianity that Jesus was
[55:22] not just the Messiah but was God in
[55:25] flesh they speak evil of that way before
[55:27] the multitude Paul departed from them
[55:30] remember he went to a school of tyrannis
[55:32] and was there for three
[55:35] years and now here they are in
[55:44] Jerusalem well let's get a bit more
[55:46] context regarding these worshippers of
[55:49] the Lord practitioners of Judaism living
[55:53] in the diaspora the exile
[55:55] outside the land of
[55:57] promise they're just like Paul when he
[56:01] was known as
[56:03] Saul Jesus told his followers in Matthew
[56:08] 10 and Mark 13 in Luke 12 he said take
[56:13] no thought when you're accused when
[56:16] you're seized in the synagogues well
[56:18] that's what Paul said he did
[56:20] often and other places that the Holy
[56:23] Spirit would give them words to speak
[56:25] speak well if that's true if Jesus said
[56:28] that and if they were being seized and
[56:31] the Holy Spirit gave them words to speak
[56:33] then Paul heard the gospel he heard it
[56:37] over and over again as he was
[56:41] persecuting its
[56:42] followers he heard the scriptures he
[56:44] heard the arguments supporting the claim
[56:47] that Jesus was the Messiah and more than
[56:50] the
[56:51] Messiah how did Paul
[56:53] respond
[56:56] acts
[56:57] 8:3 as for Saul the name of Paul prior
[57:01] to his conversion he made Havoc of the
[57:04] church entering into every house and
[57:07] hailing men and women committed them to
[57:11] prison in Acts nine we read and Saul
[57:16] that's Paul yet breathing out
[57:18] threatenings and Slaughter in other
[57:22] words condemnation and death death
[57:26] against the Disciples of the Lord went
[57:28] unto the high priest and desired of him
[57:31] letters to Damascus to the synagogues
[57:34] that if you found any of this way
[57:37] whether they were men or women he might
[57:40] bring them bound unto Jerusalem for
[57:43] trial
[57:45] execution you'll hear Paul utter these
[57:47] words in the very next chapter of Acts
[57:49] and and when we get to acts 22 and
[57:51] brother Daniel gets to acts 22 next week
[57:53] I presume
[57:55] he's telling the crowd I verily am a man
[57:59] which am a Jew born in Tarsus a city in
[58:03] celissia yet brought up in this city
[58:06] Jerusalem at the feet of
[58:09] Galia and taught according to the
[58:11] perfect manner of the law of the fathers
[58:15] and was zealous toward God as ye all are
[58:19] this day and I persecuted this way the
[58:23] followers of Jesus Christ Christians
[58:25] unto the death binding and delivering
[58:28] into prisons both men and women to await
[58:32] trial and
[58:34] execution as also the high priest ha
[58:36] bear me witness and all the estate of
[58:38] the elders from whom also I received
[58:41] letters unto the Brethren he doesn't
[58:43] mean the brethren in The Fellowship of
[58:44] the church he means the Jewish Brethren
[58:47] that were practicing Judaism there and
[58:50] went to Damascus to bring them which
[58:52] were there bound unto Jerusalem for to
[58:54] be punished to be tried for blasphemy as
[58:58] we read in our in our opening verse in
[59:01] Acts 26 which thing I also did in
[59:03] Jerusalem and many of the Saints did I
[59:05] shut up in prison having received
[59:07] Authority from the chief priests and
[59:10] when they were put to death I gave my
[59:12] voice I cast my vote against
[59:15] them and I punished them of in every
[59:18] synagogue and compelled them to
[59:22] blaspheme and being EX exceedingly mad
[59:25] against them I persecuted them even into
[59:27] strange
[59:29] cities later when he's in prison in Rome
[59:34] Paul writes a letter to
[59:37] Timothy 1 Timothy chapter 1 verse 12 he
[59:42] says and I thank Christ Jesus our lord
[59:45] who hath enabled me for that he counted
[59:49] me faithful putting me into the ministry
[59:53] who was before
[59:55] before I met him on the Damascus Road a
[59:59] blasphemer there's that word again and a
[1:00:02] persecutor and
[1:00:05] injurious but I obtained
[1:00:08] Mercy because I did it
[1:00:11] ignorantly in
[1:00:13] unbelief I'd heard the gospel and
[1:00:16] rejected it yet I obtained
[1:00:19] Mercy because this was
[1:00:22] ignorance remember
[1:00:25] when Jesus was being
[1:00:26] crucified he cried father forgive
[1:00:31] them they don't know what they're doing
[1:00:34] they're doing it
[1:00:36] ignorantly in
[1:00:38] unbelief while we were yet sinners
[1:00:43] unbelievers Christ died for
[1:00:47] us in another place he uses the term
[1:00:50] heresy instead of blasphemy but meaning
[1:00:53] the same thing in Acts 24 he says I
[1:00:56] confess unto thee that after the way
[1:00:58] which they call heresy so worship I the
[1:01:03] god of my
[1:01:04] fathers believing all things which are
[1:01:07] written in the
[1:01:08] law and in the
[1:01:11] prophets what is this
[1:01:15] blasphemy what is this
[1:01:18] heresy it's the
[1:01:21] confession Jesus is Lord
[1:01:25] capital L capital O capital r capital D
[1:01:31] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:01:34] and
[1:01:34] forever that Jesus is not just a man
[1:01:38] he's not just a a Divine being like an
[1:01:41] angel but that Jesus Christ is the
[1:01:44] Divine being God himself veiled and
[1:01:49] living in human
[1:01:52] flesh and our King James Jes Bibles in
[1:01:55] the Old Testament you often see the word
[1:01:57] Lord in all
[1:01:59] capitals that's when the Hebrew word is
[1:02:01] one that we sometimes say Yahweh or
[1:02:04] Jehovah in Judaism it's never
[1:02:07] pronounced they consider it too holy
[1:02:11] Jewish people will say adoni which means
[1:02:13] sir or Hashem which is Hebrew for the
[1:02:18] name in English they'll write capital
[1:02:23] G hyphen D they won't even spell the
[1:02:27] word
[1:02:29] God that's the reverence that they
[1:02:33] have in the Greek somewhat less precise
[1:02:36] or more general term is used curios it's
[1:02:39] usually translated as Lord but only with
[1:02:42] the L
[1:02:43] capitalized if you look at the words and
[1:02:45] cross reference them if you get a a
[1:02:54] that the confession Jesus is Lord is
[1:02:57] really Jesus is
[1:03:01] Jehovah 1 Corinthians
[1:03:04] 12:3 wherefore I give you to understand
[1:03:08] that no man speaking by the spirit of
[1:03:10] God calls Jesus a
[1:03:13] cursed though his body hung on a tree
[1:03:17] and was thus cursed by God according to
[1:03:19] moses' writings in
[1:03:21] Deuteronomy and that no man can say that
[1:03:24] Jesus is the Lord and here I made the
[1:03:27] substitution and capitalized it but by
[1:03:30] the Holy
[1:03:32] Ghost this is what Thomas first
[1:03:35] confessed after he saw the resurrected
[1:03:38] Jesus this is what Peter preached in
[1:03:40] Acts
[1:03:42] 2:36 and this is the blasphemy that led
[1:03:46] to the persecution of the followers of
[1:03:49] Jesus
[1:03:51] Christ claiming a man was not just
[1:03:53] anointed not just
[1:03:55] Christos but
[1:03:57] curios not even that he was a Divine
[1:03:59] being but God himself whose body hung on
[1:04:02] a tree after it had died a condition
[1:04:05] that God himself said meant a cursed
[1:04:09] person so these Jews from
[1:04:12] Ephesus that are laying hands on Paul
[1:04:14] that are grabbing him right
[1:04:17] now they're just like Paul was without
[1:04:20] the benefit of the Damascus Road
[1:04:23] experience
[1:04:25] and and and what what are they doing in
[1:04:28] Jerusalem how come they're not in
[1:04:30] Ephesus why is there such a crowd
[1:04:33] there remember it was around the time of
[1:04:36] Pentecost one of the three feasts the
[1:04:39] Jewish men were commanded to observe in
[1:04:41] the place the Lord would choose
[1:04:43] Deuteronomy 16:16 says three times in a
[1:04:46] year shall all thy men appear before the
[1:04:48] Lord thy God in the place which you
[1:04:50] shall choose which became the temple in
[1:04:53] Jerusalem
[1:04:54] the Feast of unleavened bread that's
[1:04:56] Passover and the week following it and
[1:04:59] the Feast of Weeks Pentecost the time
[1:05:01] that we're dealing with right now in
[1:05:03] this chapter 21 and in the Feast of
[1:05:06] Tabernacles the in gathering the Harvest
[1:05:08] which happens in the
[1:05:10] fall so it's reasonable and predictable
[1:05:14] that some of the men from that synagogue
[1:05:16] where Paul preached in Ephesus for three
[1:05:18] months would be there in
[1:05:21] Jerusalem so back to acts 21 they
[1:05:24] grabbed Paul started a riot by crying
[1:05:27] out men of Israel help this is the man
[1:05:32] that caused so much trouble in our
[1:05:34] synagogue at Ephesus that teaches all
[1:05:36] that everywhere against the Jewish
[1:05:39] people the people of the Covenant with
[1:05:41] God and the law of Moses and this place
[1:05:44] the Holy Temple where God himself has
[1:05:46] put his name and further brought Greeks
[1:05:49] also from the court of the Gentiles into
[1:05:52] the temple and hath thereby not only
[1:05:55] disrespected but in fact has polluted
[1:05:58] this holy
[1:06:01] Place
[1:06:03] polluted why would they say that well
[1:06:07] Luke gives us a little parenthetical
[1:06:10] explanation they had seen before with
[1:06:13] Paul in the city of Jerusalem tropus an
[1:06:17] Ephesian a gentile whom they recognize
[1:06:20] as one of Paul's traveling companions
[1:06:22] listed in Acts 20
[1:06:25] so if they knew that this was a gentile
[1:06:27] from Ephesus probably these guys are
[1:06:30] from Ephesus or how would they even know
[1:06:32] that whom they
[1:06:35] supposed whom they supposed they didn't
[1:06:38] know don't confuse me with the facts my
[1:06:41] mind's made
[1:06:43] up they didn't see tropus in the temple
[1:06:46] because he wasn't there but because they
[1:06:48] had seen him elsewhere in Jerusalem they
[1:06:50] assumed that Paul had brought him into
[1:06:53] the temple
[1:06:55] thus polluting it by bringing a gentile
[1:06:57] beyond the court of the
[1:07:00] Gentiles so we read right there that
[1:07:03] they didn't see tropus in the temple
[1:07:04] area but because they saw him in
[1:07:05] Jerusalem he associated with Paul
[1:07:07] therefore Paul must have brought him
[1:07:09] there even if they can't see
[1:07:11] him they are as
[1:07:13] incensed as Paul once was making a man
[1:07:18] God and in the temple of the priest that
[1:07:21] had authorized Paul to seize Christian
[1:07:24] and bring them to trial and execution
[1:07:26] right
[1:07:27] there they were having a hard time in
[1:07:30] Ephesus they delicate relationship with
[1:07:33] the pagans there having been upset after
[1:07:35] Paul's
[1:07:37] Ministry so these guys cry out and what
[1:07:40] happens all the city was moved agitated
[1:07:44] stirred up
[1:07:47] aroused by these accusations it reminds
[1:07:50] us of the of the riot of the silver
[1:07:52] Smiths that took place in Ephesus says a
[1:07:54] few months prior to
[1:07:56] this and the people ran together and
[1:07:59] they took Paul They seized Paul and Drew
[1:08:03] him out they dragged him out of the
[1:08:07] temple I have to
[1:08:10] ask where were the many thousands of
[1:08:14] Jewish Christians that supposedly were
[1:08:16] going to be seeing Paul do this and
[1:08:18] change all their
[1:08:19] minds where were
[1:08:21] they where were they
[1:08:24] and forth with the doors the gates to
[1:08:27] the temple area were
[1:08:30] shut and as they the mob incited by the
[1:08:34] Pilgrims from Ephesus went about to kill
[1:08:37] him to kill Paul in other words they
[1:08:42] began beating him and who knows what
[1:08:45] else Tidings news of this came to the
[1:08:48] chief captain of the band the senior
[1:08:50] officer in charge of the Roman Garrison
[1:08:53] probably in the Fortress of Antonia
[1:08:55] immediately adjacent to the temple
[1:08:57] grounds that all Jerusalem was in an
[1:09:02] uproar a riot was in
[1:09:06] progress the Roman Garrison was likely
[1:09:09] prepared for some disturbances given
[1:09:12] that the city was filled with pilgrims
[1:09:15] for the Feast of
[1:09:16] Pentecost and keep in mind the entire
[1:09:19] Province this this is taking place in 57
[1:09:22] ad as near as as we can
[1:09:24] tell in less than 10 years this whole
[1:09:28] Province will go up an armed Rebellion
[1:09:31] against Rome you don't have a civil war
[1:09:34] like this everything is peaceful and
[1:09:36] calm and wonderful one day the next day
[1:09:38] you've got armies in the field this has
[1:09:41] been building up over time one of Jesus
[1:09:43] uh disciples was uh Simon the Zealot
[1:09:46] right one of these guys that was all for
[1:09:49] armed Rebellion against Rome this had
[1:09:50] been building up and building up for
[1:09:52] decades
[1:09:56] so this whole place is in an
[1:09:59] uproar so who the officer in charge
[1:10:03] immediately took soldiers and centurions
[1:10:06] so he took a large group of soldiers
[1:10:08] perhaps 200 or more and ran he wasted no
[1:10:11] time ran down unto them Rome feared the
[1:10:17] mob quelling riots punishing those who
[1:10:20] instigated them was a top civil
[1:10:24] priority to maintain civil
[1:10:26] order and when they those who were
[1:10:30] attacking
[1:10:31] Paul saw the chief Captain and the
[1:10:34] soldiers they left they stopped their
[1:10:37] beating of
[1:10:39] Paul then the chief Captain came near
[1:10:42] Paul and took him commanded him to be
[1:10:46] bound with two
[1:10:48] chains now these wouldn't be little
[1:10:50] lightweight chains like you have on a
[1:10:52] kid swing in your backyard these were
[1:10:54] heavy iron made by Hand stout chains and
[1:10:58] demanded of the crowd who Paul was what
[1:11:01] is who is this guy what's he done to
[1:11:04] cause such an
[1:11:06] uproar he assumed the crowd had some
[1:11:09] reason to attack
[1:11:10] Paul they knew Rome does not tolerate
[1:11:15] riots this will not be tolerated and yet
[1:11:18] they were insens enough that they went
[1:11:19] ahead and did it and besides thisy was
[1:11:23] an officer in the Roman army it's a big
[1:11:26] bureaucracy he's probably going to have
[1:11:27] to file a report he wants to get the
[1:11:30] information that he can put in the
[1:11:31] report not necessarily an accurate
[1:11:34] report but at least based somewhat on
[1:11:36] what's going
[1:11:40] on and some cried one thing some another
[1:11:45] among the multitude it reminds us again
[1:11:47] of the riot in Ephesus people saw a big
[1:11:50] crowd running and shouting and carrying
[1:11:52] on and they thought hey
[1:11:54] let's find out what's going on right all
[1:11:56] the traffic slows down when there's an
[1:11:58] accident by the road yeah so when it
[1:12:02] became obvious that he could not know
[1:12:05] the certainty the the the exact events
[1:12:08] that led to the toml he commanded him
[1:12:11] Paul to be carried into the castle it
[1:12:15] may be that Paul couldn't walk for the
[1:12:17] beating he just
[1:12:19] sustained they were trying to kill him
[1:12:22] or perhaps the way to the two changes
[1:12:24] more than he could deal with in his
[1:12:26] weakened
[1:12:28] condition and when Paul Came Upon the
[1:12:32] stairs leading into the castle The
[1:12:35] Fortress so it was that he was born of
[1:12:38] the soldiers he was carried by the
[1:12:40] soldiers for the violence of the
[1:12:43] people he couldn't climb the stairs
[1:12:46] maybe due to the beating maybe it's due
[1:12:48] to the violent Restless crowd for the
[1:12:51] multitude of the people follow followed
[1:12:53] after crying away with
[1:12:57] him so similar to the crowd 25 years
[1:13:01] earlier crying crucify
[1:13:04] him same
[1:13:06] place same place and as Paul was to be
[1:13:11] led into the
[1:13:13] castle he said unto the chief
[1:13:16] Captain may I may I speak unto you who
[1:13:20] in great surprise said you speak
[1:13:25] Greek aren't aren't you that that
[1:13:27] Egyptian guy that that a while back
[1:13:30] before these days made a big
[1:13:32] uproar LED Into the Wilderness about
[1:13:35] 4,000 men that were murderers aren't you
[1:13:38] that Egyptian
[1:13:39] guy he doesn't think Paul's a
[1:13:42] Roman or even that he's a
[1:13:44] Jew he thinks he's an Egyptian Rabel
[1:13:48] Rouser when he writes a letter when we
[1:13:51] get to acts 23 you'll find that he
[1:13:53] changed ches his story a little
[1:13:55] bit but Paul
[1:13:58] said I am a man which am not an Egyptian
[1:14:02] but a Jew of Tarsus a cidian
[1:14:07] celissia hence my presence during this
[1:14:10] pilgrimage for the Feast of
[1:14:12] Pentecost I'm a citizen of no means City
[1:14:16] Paul means Rome but the chief Captain
[1:14:19] thinks he's bragging about Tarsus and
[1:14:21] we'll see that also in chapter 23
[1:14:24] and I beseech you allow me to speak to
[1:14:28] the people suffer me to speak to the
[1:14:30] people I can calm him down there's no
[1:14:33] there no need for this
[1:14:35] uproar Paul ceases earlier self of Saul
[1:14:40] In This
[1:14:42] Crowd and when he the the chief Captain
[1:14:46] had given him license gave Paul
[1:14:48] permission to speak Paul stood on the
[1:14:51] stairs at the entrance to the Fortress
[1:14:54] and beckoned with a hand unto the
[1:14:58] people and when there was made a great
[1:15:01] silence he spoke unto
[1:15:04] them in the Hebrew
[1:15:06] tongue
[1:15:17] said got that you want me to translate
[1:15:20] it okay we'll translate it come back
[1:15:24] next week to hear Brother Daniel tell
[1:15:26] you what I said to the
[1:15:28] crowd but but wait don't go away we're
[1:15:31] not done yet we're not finished what
[1:15:35] what can we
[1:15:36] learn and apply to our lives from the
[1:15:40] events in this second part of Acts
[1:15:46] 21 the takeaway that jumps out at me
[1:15:49] when I was studying
[1:15:51] this is how we judge
[1:15:53] judge how we
[1:15:56] evaluate
[1:15:57] others we've read of at least three
[1:16:00] examples of people judging others this
[1:16:04] evening the first is that of the Jewish
[1:16:06] Christians in
[1:16:08] Jerusalem according to James and the
[1:16:10] elders the people heard rumors about
[1:16:12] Paul and they beli those rumors as a
[1:16:16] result they accused Paul of teaching
[1:16:18] Jews and other locations to forsake the
[1:16:21] practices of Judaism both those
[1:16:23] prescribed in the law and those based on
[1:16:26] tradition customary
[1:16:29] practice the second example we've read
[1:16:32] about is Paul
[1:16:33] himself we read how we persecuted the
[1:16:36] church eagerly seeking out Christians to
[1:16:39] exterminate them to extract their
[1:16:42] confession the blasphemy that Jesus is
[1:16:47] Lord not recognizing that it was in fact
[1:16:49] the truth and that denial of that truth
[1:16:52] was was in fact
[1:16:55] blasphemy as a result he sought the
[1:16:57] conviction and death of many
[1:17:00] people a third example is that of the
[1:17:03] Jews of Ephesus now come to Worship in
[1:17:07] Jerusalem they've heard his words that
[1:17:10] they consider to be
[1:17:11] blasphemy they've had to deal with the
[1:17:13] aftermath of his ministry not just about
[1:17:17] Diana and the silver Smiths but the fact
[1:17:19] that Paul Drew away many Jews in Ephesus
[1:17:22] to Christian Chris ity sucked them into
[1:17:25] this heresy this Jesus
[1:17:27] cult they saw Paul as having caused them
[1:17:31] great damage on many
[1:17:33] levels they saw him as their
[1:17:37] enemy if you ask them they would say
[1:17:40] well we're judging Paul by the word of
[1:17:42] God brought To Us by a Vindicated
[1:17:45] Prophet that's what they tell you my
[1:17:48] brothers and my sisters we must be so
[1:17:53] very
[1:17:54] careful within the ranks of what we
[1:17:57] refer to as the message we hear many
[1:18:00] different
[1:18:01] interpretations observe many different
[1:18:04] practices some groups will totally
[1:18:07] exclude or shun those that differ in
[1:18:10] their understanding or opinion of
[1:18:12] various doctrines and customs and
[1:18:15] interpretation some Elevate certain
[1:18:17] individuals and look down on those who
[1:18:20] don't all claim to have a Revelation as
[1:18:24] justification for their attitudes and
[1:18:27] their behaviors towards
[1:18:30] others Jesus
[1:18:32] said we' be known by our
[1:18:35] fruits not by our
[1:18:37] knowledge not by our
[1:18:40] Revelation not by our ability to quote
[1:18:45] another what should our attitude
[1:18:48] be to those with whom we
[1:18:51] disagree or or even those who reject
[1:18:55] us let me
[1:18:58] answer by reading you some
[1:19:01] quotes some quotes from a son of man
[1:19:04] Ministry from
[1:19:06] from from an early an early
[1:19:11] sermon it's it's from The Sermon on the
[1:19:15] Mount and it's found in the gospel of
[1:19:17] Matthew these
[1:19:20] quotes Matthew 5:7
[1:19:24] Jesus says blessed are the
[1:19:27] merciful for they shall obtain
[1:19:31] Mercy you want God's mercy in your life
[1:19:35] I do how do you get God's Mercy by being
[1:19:40] merciful not harsh or
[1:19:44] judgmental he goes on he says uh in
[1:19:47] verse
[1:19:48] 38 you've
[1:19:50] heard that it has been said
[1:19:53] an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth
[1:19:56] well of course they heard that it's the
[1:19:58] law of Moses you'll find it in Exodus
[1:20:01] 2124 you'll find it in Leviticus
[1:20:04] 24:20 you'll find it in Deuteronomy
[1:20:08] 19:21 this is a firm rule a firm
[1:20:12] practice but I say unto
[1:20:15] you that you resist not evil but
[1:20:19] whosoever shall smite thee on thy right
[1:20:22] cheek
[1:20:23] cheek
[1:20:25] listen I can hear the hiss of the crowd
[1:20:28] sucking in their breath at this
[1:20:30] statement whosoever will smite thee on
[1:20:33] the right
[1:20:36] cheek turn to him the other
[1:20:40] also a little sidebar did you ever
[1:20:43] notice that he specifies the right
[1:20:47] cheek he didn't just say if someone
[1:20:49] smacks you on one side of the face give
[1:20:51] them the other side
[1:20:53] to and the context is about
[1:20:57] evil have you ever dug into this to see
[1:20:59] what's so special what's going on
[1:21:03] here in the Middle East even today in
[1:21:07] Muslim
[1:21:08] countries this would be a huge
[1:21:12] insult this practice dates back at least
[1:21:16] to the early centuries ad and appears to
[1:21:18] be true in jesus' time especially in
[1:21:20] light of this verse and in the year
[1:21:24] 2000 I went to Saudi
[1:21:27] Arabia I was cautioned to never use my
[1:21:31] left hand when
[1:21:32] eating accepting a gift or almost
[1:21:38] anything of course I forgot upon Landing
[1:21:41] in Riyad sitting in an airport lounge
[1:21:43] awaiting the arrival of the prince who
[1:21:45] had invited our group a steward offered
[1:21:48] me a cup of
[1:21:49] tea I reached up with my left hand to to
[1:21:52] to take the cup of tea because I had
[1:21:54] something else in my right hand and he
[1:21:56] withdrew the tray and gave me a
[1:21:59] look I put down what I had in my right
[1:22:02] hand he came with the tray I
[1:22:05] took he moved on to the next
[1:22:09] person he moved on to the next person
[1:22:11] that that was an oops on my part now if
[1:22:15] someone's going to smite
[1:22:17] me on the right
[1:22:19] cheek brother Aaron here's your chance
[1:22:21] take your best shot brother
[1:22:25] which hand are you using my left your
[1:22:27] left hand to hit my right cheek which
[1:22:30] Jesus said you're using your left
[1:22:33] hand thank you
[1:22:38] brother I'm glad you didn't hit me any
[1:22:41] harder so so when Jesus is talking about
[1:22:45] the right cheek he's really talking
[1:22:47] about the left
[1:22:50] hand the left hand is it's
[1:22:54] despicable
[1:22:55] why someone hit you with the left hand
[1:22:59] why well one eats with one's right hand
[1:23:02] but one cleans up after do what my
[1:23:06] grandmother called the the little job no
[1:23:08] one else can do for me with his or her
[1:23:11] left hand and of course there were no
[1:23:13] convenient rolls of bathroom tissue in
[1:23:16] ancient
[1:23:17] times the left hand was unclean it
[1:23:21] symbolized unclean as a result and of
[1:23:24] course this would have resulted in the
[1:23:26] tradition that one must wash one's hands
[1:23:28] before eating before rubbing grain in
[1:23:30] the field and partaking of
[1:23:33] it so Jesus is
[1:23:36] saying to accept that extreme utterly
[1:23:40] degrading insult don't fight back don't
[1:23:44] return the insult
[1:23:46] forgive turn the other
[1:23:49] cheek okay that sidebar was free
[1:23:52] continuing in Matthew's gospel after
[1:23:55] Jesus said what we call the Lord's
[1:23:58] Prayer he continued
[1:24:01] with for if ye forgive men their
[1:24:04] trespasses your heavenly father will
[1:24:07] also forgive
[1:24:08] you anyone here not wanting
[1:24:12] forgiveness then you have to forgive
[1:24:14] those that hurt you and he goes on the
[1:24:18] corollary he says if you don't forgive
[1:24:21] men their trespasses
[1:24:23] neither will your father forgive your
[1:24:28] trespasses the door swings both ways
[1:24:31] forgive you will be forgiven fail to
[1:24:35] forgive you will not be forgiven it's
[1:24:37] not just confession it's forgiveness
[1:24:41] genuine
[1:24:43] heartfelt often hard to
[1:24:46] do moving on to another
[1:24:50] example Matthew 7 seven he says judge
[1:24:54] not that you be not
[1:24:56] judged for with what judgment you judge
[1:25:00] you shall be judged and with what
[1:25:02] measure you meet the the measure the
[1:25:04] standard you use it'll be measured to
[1:25:07] you again measured to you also measured
[1:25:10] back to
[1:25:11] you so here Jesus is saying the same
[1:25:14] thing using different words but the same
[1:25:17] thought that's four times in three
[1:25:20] chapters relating an account of one
[1:25:25] sermon don't judge be
[1:25:28] merciful don't
[1:25:31] retaliate forgive the musicians would
[1:25:34] please
[1:25:36] return He sums it up nicely in Luke's
[1:25:41] gospel with four Commandments ad do do
[1:25:45] don'ts and
[1:25:47] Ado Luke 6 be ye therefore
[1:25:51] merciful as your father is
[1:25:54] merciful while we were yet
[1:25:56] sinners Christ loved us and died for us
[1:26:01] that's the level of Mercy we are asked
[1:26:06] to extend to
[1:26:09] others judge not and you shall not be
[1:26:13] judged condemn not and you shall not be
[1:26:17] condemned forgive and ye shall be
[1:26:21] forgiven
[1:26:24] when you think of what we sometimes call
[1:26:25] the promises of God here's four in just
[1:26:29] two
[1:26:30] verses but they're
[1:26:33] conditional we must do our part before
[1:26:37] we can expect God to do the part he
[1:26:40] listed his is a
[1:26:42] response and in the
[1:26:44] end really we respond to his Love To Us
[1:26:49] by doing what he asks us to do Jesus
[1:26:51] said how can you say you love me if you
[1:26:54] don't do what I
[1:26:56] say that's found in in the 14th chapter
[1:26:59] of St John four different times he says
[1:27:01] it in verse 15 in verse 21 in verse 23
[1:27:04] and verse 24 how can you say you love me
[1:27:08] if you don't do what I
[1:27:10] say but what happens he responds to our
[1:27:13] actions with the further demonstration
[1:27:15] of his love Mercy not judging or
[1:27:19] condemning us forgiving us
[1:27:23] I'm depending on his
[1:27:25] mercy and his
[1:27:27] forgiveness and his
[1:27:29] love aren't
[1:27:32] you and we know then what we must do not
[1:27:36] to earn it but as a response to his
[1:27:40] unconditional love to
[1:27:42] us as we close tonight's
[1:27:45] service let's sing Mercy rewrote my

[1:29:44] statement you ought to be able to
[1:29:47] bitterly
[1:29:48] disagree with each other and still love
[1:29:52] one
[1:29:53] another I think a lot of us hear the
[1:29:55] bitterly part and forget the love
[1:29:59] part but God rich in Mercy while we were

[1:34:10] Simplicity you know he walked with his
[1:34:13] disciples and they saw him
