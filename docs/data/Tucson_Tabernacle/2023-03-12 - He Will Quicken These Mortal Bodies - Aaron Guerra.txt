for it in Jesus Christ amen while you're standing let's just read Romans chapter 8. we'll read verses 11 and 14. and then you may be seated you know we say these these this scriptures so we should know it all we read it often but in reality we should really get to the place where we know this whole book all of it as much as we can we find ourselves reading a lot of things well we could be reading his word but amen but if the Same Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you and then verse 14. for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God Amen you may be seated so the last time we spoke we had heard a brother Minister and at the end of his his ministry and he made that statement what if this would be the day when Jesus comes what if this would be that Resurrection morning and that thought hasn't gone away because every day I wake up thinking could this be that day and and it should be in our heart every day just different things that going in life and I find myself saying oh even so come quickly Lord Jesus and then I stop myself and say why because I just want out of this current trouble I'm in this that's going on what is it and there's going to be that day when this will no longer trouble us it won't we won't be part of this life now some of you are still quite young and I laughed to myself a little bit today when Daniel got used my dad and I thought my girls were thinking it's not us this time because I used my girls quite often but you know we are the children of God and and I don't hear Brother Daniel Evans speaking about his son that way because he's mad at his son or because no because he loves his son see now we are the sons of God and sometimes when he speaks to us it might seem like he's a little upset with us or he's a if I could have put it in our way he's a bit frustrated with if you know how many times am I going to have to tell you this and um maybe we would say when we learn it maybe Lord you could stop we could change the subject but you know he knows how to teach he knows how to get in he knows what gets your attention and and because he knows you well you know um and I appreciate that um I was telling the brothers just a little bit ago Friday this past Friday hit up one of my positions in in work is I do homeowner appointments I go in and do repairs and different things and you never know what you're going to run into I've run into some wonderful people and I've run into some people that are hard to deal with and I've been thrown out of people's houses because I didn't do what they said because they wanted something that's not to be done and I've had others wanting to feed me giving you know it's you never know but on Friday I went into the house and these homeowners had not been there the first three times we went by and so this time I called and I called ahead with and with the one that schedules and they said they're supposed to be home and they were homeless so when I got into the house what was on my notes was not what they needed so I came unprepared with the right stuff because that's not what's on my notes so um the dishwasher needed to be removed in order for me to do the repair and because one of our employees had removed a dishwasher disconnected wrong and flooded the house we no longer remove appliances or have anything if it's not ours we don't touch it that's so I told him if you want me to fix this then you'll need to call the superintendent have them come and remove the dishwasher so they did and he's a young man he's he's doing the best he can and it's Friday afternoon we all want to go home now and it's been a long week and he kind of gives me the look like you know why did you do this to me I said because it needs to be done so he got a little upset he said a few things harshly to me in front of the homeowner then he began to disconnect the dishwasher did it wrong and got water all over the place and we had to dry it and I helped him as best I could in all finally we ended up getting what could be done done and it was probably there half an hour and then I went on to my next job and he left but got home and I told my wife what had happened and else it's a little embarrassing to get treated that way in front of the homeowner but hopefully we've grown up a little bit and learn how to handle those things but around 6 30 I get a text on my phone and it's him and he's saying I'm sorry how he treated you and I'm looking at it and I went back and I told my wife look he said hey I'm sorry and I just I text back and say hey we all have our days no problem it's all right no he says I just need to apologize to you I'm sorry that was on Thursday so yesterday Friday I'm driving through that subdivision at the end of the day he sees me and he Flags me down and I said oh boy now he's going to get it give it to me again but he came and he opened the window and I said yes sir and he goes I didn't again I just want to tell you I'm sorry I was wrong and I said you know and and here's the man I know he's got some problems and things he's a young man he's going through a hard time but that he would be able to do that that he would humble himself to say I'm sorry and it encouraged my heart because sometimes you look at the world and say there's no hope out there anymore but God in his rich in his great Mercy still calls out still reaches out and he says if if you could call on my name if he'll ask me I'll help now we know that he loves his children there's no question about it and he gave his life for us he gave his all for us but he tells his disciples and and you know his disciples around him the whole time and just like the the man and the people that were around brother Branham all the time you get to hear their testimonies but if you're not careful that person that man that Pastor whoever it is becomes your Holy Ghost becomes your answer and if you're not careful with that you know and and that's what began with the disciples were they even arguing amongst themselves who's the greatest and and can I be the one sitting at your right hand and and can I do this but Jesus makes tells them he says there is a better way now how could God do a better way because his ways are perfect but he's he had already he began to talk about this plan I'm not just being with you but in you and and he said and the disciples are not understanding that and even when it comes to that time Peter says I'm going to go with you I'll be with you first he tells them don't let this happen but that was just Satan trying to to interfere and when Jesus turns around get thee behind me saying he wasn't speaking to Peter he was speaking to that spirit and you know so you see those things but he had a way that he wanted to I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world because just being with you wasn't going to be enough brother Branham would say he'd have to go out the back door sometimes because all the people were waiting for him to come out the front door and he needed a little bit of peace and quiet made away but because he was a child of God and he had a heart for the people he would go out the other way to minister to them and he would make statements like I'm so tired it's been a long day but the desire for God's children was there Moses stood in between the breach and he said if you destroy them you're going to have to go through me it's a cry of a man of God He Loves God's children so in these scriptures and he says for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God and as a son your heir to everything that the father has but you you see these things as Jesus is talking to his disciples I'm going away I'm going to prepare a better play I'm going to prepare a place for you there's a better way if I come and dwell in you my goodness I'm going to break this place apart here if I come in dwell in you I just won't be with you I'll dwell in you it's just not when we're walking together it's just not over it's always you know and and what a promise we have and this promise even if you go back and you see him when he speaks to Abraham and he gives them you're going to be the father of Nations through you that this lineage I'm talking is going to come and he tells them when they're old when they can't have children because that's God that's God you know if if it always just happened like that like that we would just be a bunch of spoiled children you know but when God shows that when he comes down to the last moment I always think of of Joseph in the prison if if all of it was recorded all the events all the thoughts going through Joseph's mind but that promise that dream you gave me those things and here it's ten years later and I'm still in prison but if something in his heart said I had a dream I have a promise God said to me and God keeps his word but he didn't say it's going to happen tomorrow he just said hold on you begin to look at some of these things even with Abraham he says I'm going to make you a father of Nations and Abraham it says he's staggered not at the promise of God I'm gonna say something to you child of God the same thing will be said about you he's staggered not at the promise of God because you're going to be on the other side believe it or not you're going to be on the other side he's seen you already you should claim that promise you know and and so you know we we've read these things and brother Brown says quite a few things if you type in the word the power of the Resurrection there's many places where he begins to speak of the power of the Resurrection the evidence of the Resurrection and we should see it in our own life my wife just planted uh the seeds just some flowers and we both get to do part of it it's really fun I do all the digging she does all the planting and she likes it that way best but we both get to reap the benefits of the flowers when they come up we get to see them and it makes me happy when she's happy about it you know and it's the same when when God looks upon his children and he sees him rejoicing in his promises it fills his heart with joy they've taken me at my word they have believed my word they stand for me I might read a few quotes here back in 49 way back in the beginning when the deity of Jesus Christ I believe the brothers have it and he says now friends I know that to be the truth I know people don't realize who you are every person in here can live above sin can live without sin and live in God now watch this you'll make mistakes yeah that's true but the blood of Christ will forgive you father forgive them for they know not what they do is that right the same power of Christ that that was hung on calvary's cross the same God that raised him up on the day of the Resurrection is in you now you that's got the Holy Ghost oh don't you love him oh my hear his voice calling today if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it will Quicken your mortal bodies in 55 proof of his resurrection now what I'm doing to this woman here will not be reading her mind no sir God forbid God knows that that's wrong it won't be God it won't be God in heaven as my judge know that that's not that's wrong see not reading her mind but it'll be through the power of the Resurrection Jesus Christ in his church look at Peter and them when they stood there and looked upon the people how Paul was different and different ones looked upon the people and they perceived that there were certain things that were wrong it was Christ in them operating that way well that was for brother Branham that was for Paul that was for Peter that was for no that's for me and you it's Christ in us the hope of glory from the message the token and watch where he says what made that big tumor disappear in my wife yesterday when just a few days ago she was ready for the operating table and now they can't find a thing it's because the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ The Token of God that he still lives that destroyed it you know what's going to destroy that mortal life in you the Life of Christ it's not going to be your Deeds it's not going to be your goodness it's not going to be your the sacrifice that's that's what many organizations the Catholics are by these great Deeds by these things you can overcome know by The Life of Christ in you more of God and less of me from the message of paradox I just know him that's all I want and to know him is life know these other things I don't know about it might identify as a smart man and he said I don't want to be a smart man I just want to know him I know him as Paul said in the power of his resurrection and we and when he calls all come out from among the dead that's all that's all and I want him I want him I want my name on the right place to know him in the power of his resurrection there's no fear of deaths there's no fear of the other side remember brother Branham talks about how he didn't know what heaven was like and he thought they were all going to be clouds and brother Neville would be one Cloud going by with a harp and this one you wouldn't know who they are but the angel asked him he said would you like to get a glimpse of what's on the other side and he said that would help me a whole lot amen I'd say the same thing yes Lord if I could just get a glimp what a problem what an anchor in our lives you know and then in God's provided place of worship it just kind of took him from the beginning towards the end and now remember in Christ we are flesh of his flesh bone of his bones when God was when God wounded Christ at Calvary he was wounded for me and you we are flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone body of his body name of his name bride of him so we are in him we are the Flesh and his bones and God has already raised us up potentially the quickening power that raises from a life of sin and changed our being has a potentiality raises has potentially raised us up in Christ Jesus which the resurrection will bring us forth in full maturity you know we think about it and some of you are close to that age where brother Branham said somewhere between 19 and 21 years old some of us some of you haven't got anywhere near that age yet and some of us are way down the road from that age but brother Ram talks about around that 19 to 21 years old now and Daniel don't take this personally please I got to be nice to him because he's a big boy they get to between 19 and 21 and they're hard to teach amen I've been there I've been there you get to that age and you you've come a long ways you've come a long ways at that age you've gone through school maybe you've gone through college some of us were married with Children already at that age and you got all and and sometimes we say well we know it all but now looking back from here 63 looking back and I said man there's very little I really do know when my little grandson Asher and and Chloe at seven will tell me things and they'll repeat it just like they know it all but you know today has advanced so much it's so different you know but brother Branham says that between 19 and when you're at the peak of your could you imagine that the energy the strength to run all day and all night and not have to take a nap for two weeks to get up the next day what a day that'll be but I have a promise of today not just necessarily looking down that a time whatever it is up ahead but something in my heart that says yeah that's part of that promise that's part of that Resurrection that's part of that life and I can have I can taste it I can know it today I remember hearing John chapter 11. we read this the last time in the resurrection of Lazarus verses 25 26 and Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live so if the I am is living in you you have life and Resurrection in you it's getting and pushing aside that other part brother Branham says the gift is getting out of the way and letting God and that's our battle getting out of the way our mind begins to think our our actions our reactions to things that are going on and we begin to react to that and we can get nervous we can get afraid we can get upset and get angry over those things but if we would say hey Lord you handle this for me then you can be like David and I was listening to a sermon the other day and her brother was describing the size of Goliath and he might as well have been a tank coming at David but David didn't look at that he looked at the God who had been with him up to that day he said a bear came after me a lion came after me this happened and my God delivered me so this is no difference and he said and I you come at me with a with this I come at you with the great name of God our Jehovah God the god of Israel the god of our fathers and he says you're going down today that wasn't David speaking because David was a big man that was David speaking because he knew the big God that he served and here Jesus says I am the resurrection and the life and he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live I was reading some in the questions and answers I've been going through that in in 64. and some of the questions do make you laugh because even brother Branham Chuckles and people ask him but there were questions that people asked you know and and and they ask over and over and I was reminding brother Daniel when he was ministering this morning they asked brother Branham this question he said so brother Brandon can we visit other churches or should we only go there when you are preaching and he says no no go and visit them they're your brothers they're your sisters fellowship with them and he said if all that you can get is a slice of bread get the slice of bread now that's the right Spirit to approach things that's the way that's what pleases God you know and you hear some of these things and some of the questions people have brother Branham are you God and you know brother Branham says there's two sides to that Christ in me but I'm not God you have to recognize the both you know you and I laugh sometimes at the questions they had but I wonder what we would ask I would been there at that time we've had time to see these things we've had time to learn of these things we've had time to grow in them yeah but he says I am the resurrection and though he were dead yes shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth all this they may lay you down in a grave but you're not in there anymore the body you were in is there but you've been you're going back to that you're crossing over to that other side I saw sister merrily raise her hand I know where brother Rod is today and he's a young man and he's a healthy young man and he's probably the catcher on the baseball team up there maybe not brother Rod love baseball but to think of that and brother random said it sure would help me a lot to see and when he comes by in the sweetness of his presence and when he ministers to you and your heart is just you know he's drawn up close to you or something that says yes it's real and I can live another day I can go forward yes I can Lord we say the same thing brother Lord it would help me a whole lot if you just come down one more time now we know that he's talking to you know Mary and Martha here because Lazarus has passed away and I I like this part as I was thinking about these things and it reminded me of something that Jesus had said in verse 41 and they took away the Stone from the place where the dead was laid didn't say there that Lazarus was sleeping and said the dead was placed because they were still looking as Lazarus as dead but Jesus said he's sleeping is resting is she going to wake up real soon he says and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I thank thee that thou Hast heard me and that spoke to me but then this part and I know that thou herest me always and I believe as a child of God as a Son of God as a daughter of you got to come to that same place I know that you hear me and you have always heard me amen but then we put our part and you heard me but you haven't answered yet God says I've got my time it's got its place it's got its reason and you have to just say Lord then teach me Lord to wait but I like that he says lifted up his eyes and said father I thank thee that thou has heard me and I know that thou herest me always but because of the people which standby said it that they may believe that thou has sent me he didn't have any trouble coming up to going down to meet them knowing what was going to happen he didn't have to stop and have a two-week prayer meeting and fast and prepare he knew who he was and he said you always hear me Lord there was only one time that you'll ever hear him say where are you God when he willingly gave his life on the cross and he said father my father my God why hath Thou forsaken me so that he would know where we were at and how we felt and he could stand in our place and then he laid down his life and when he had thus spoken he crowded cried with a loud voice said Lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bounded out with a napkin Jesus said unto them loose him and let him go I don't think it took Lazarus a couple weeks to remember how to walk again I would say Lazarus came out there fully with life you know and and maybe if we have time we'll hear something about that brother Brandon said in a testimony so we're talking about here you know it will Quicken it'll bring to life your body he says so I looked up the word Quicken and um and and here is quickening is when a a woman that has a child starts to fill the baby's movement in their womb it feels like flutters bubbles or tiny pulses and it just stopped me and I said there is an Evidence that you know that he's alive in you I've been a Christian for 50 years now and nobody knows no it's Christ in you the hope of glory galosh Colossians 1 27 Christ in you the hope of glory but there's a maturing there's a growing there's a way of learning to get yourself out of the way and letting God have the preeminence and that's your biggest battle getting yourself out of the way but I'm tired today I I'm I I've had a long day of work these things happen I'm not feeling well um I'm going to rest for a little while then I'm going to get up and pray and the next thing you know you've been asleep for four hours the desire is right but you battled this flesh you know but but here it is it's a quickening the word Quicken is used in in the King James version of the Bible it's something if something is living it's quick or too quick and something is to be brought to life to restore to a former flourish flourishing condition a former flourishing a life a health you were part of him way back from the beginning I didn't make these words up this is what dictionaries and people have this is the meaning that's why God used these words in the scriptures so we could see that and it says King James quickened Me O Lord for thy name say bring me to life for your name namesake Lord preserve my life for the sake of Your Name Lord revive me and to revive to restore your restoring back to the original what you were already I looked at it this way I said it this way and I'm going to go back to the cars that I remember as a young boy my aunts and my uncles and you know from the early 60s and in the 50s and the big one was the 57 Chevy if I wanted to restore a 57 Chevy I can't start with a 61 Ford I've got to start with a 57 Chevy to restore so you can't start with something that wasn't part of God in the first place you start with if you're restoring back to what you were you had to be part of him in the beginning now I can't explain that I couldn't make you understand it but Christ in you is the hope of glory and that would say yeah that's me so it's a restoring Reviving it and it says the spirit that quickeneth because the flesh profiteth nothing you can take care of it you can give it the best vitamins you could treat one but eventually it's going to die but if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it will Quicken your mortal bodies and you know I was thinking about this as for several days now or maybe a couple of weeks and and just the different scriptures and the things that God allows us to remember and we go to Acts chapter 2. and we'll read verses one through four very common scriptures we read them a lot we hear them a lot and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and I don't think that changes well he can come and get into that same atmosphere that same place this is a promise of God I'll take God at his word and we'll gather under that same attitude under that same spirit there's no telling what God can do what God will do and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and if filled the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as a spirit gave them utterance I'm just wondering who was recording this was that the 121st person in there that sat on the side with the video camera and said this is what happened on the day of Pentecost no I believe God made sure someone had those words recorded because you and I were going to read them when that day was fully come God had set a time and a place and it had come that day and God keeps his word God makes every one of his appointments you know sometimes you you prepare and you plan and you go and then you get a call and saying I'm sorry we're not going to be available that day you made all your plans you've got everything ready and then you have to cancel and you have to but God doesn't work that way God said it he does it and and and if you think you're Desiring it how much more him Desiring to give it to you to share it with you we had the kids over at the house on Friday and Saturday for Chloe's birthday and I was tired my body was hurting and all and they surprised me a little bit and not really the kind of surprises you like to get I knew they were coming Friday but nobody told me they were spending the night all of the my nieces and nephews all of them and I was tired and I was achy and I was a little bit grumpy it was just a little bit right oh she said like that no and and they were going to spend the night and I know they want Papa's attention they want to do stuff with it they want you know and I was like oh my this is going to be a long night yeah but the joy of watching Chloe open her presents get the Happy Birthday song to her it was worth it all the happiness the joy and and I know you've been through some hard times I know you're going through hard times and until we leave this life and get into the other one there will be more hard times but the joy that the father gets when he sees his children when he sees you accepting receiving believing and beginning to display what he's already seen in you you know when Chloe comes up to me and she hugs me and she says I love you Papa it's okay if I'm tired it's okay if I'm hurting it's worth it all when God sees that and his heart just begins to these are mine these are my children now they were filled with the Holy Ghost that resurrection power now is limit because there was a Same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead you know and it's the same spirit that will raise you and me from the dead now we go to Acts chapter 1. verses 3. I mean chapter 3 verses 1 to 6. now this is after the day of Pentecost after the Holy Ghost had come upon them they had already done a lot of Wonder signs Wonder Jesus when he sends them out you know they're healing they're going but there were some times when they said we tried we tried but we couldn't now watch this now in Peter and John went together into the temple at the outer prayer being the ninth hour I find that interesting this is right after they received the Holy Ghost and Peter and them they they preached to them and there are many baptized and all and the next day the church was open they went to church I've heard some people say well now that I've got the Holy Ghost I don't need church I don't no even more so we would be drawing together we should be pulling together we should be encouraging one another we should be uplifting there should be a desire brother Brandon makes that statement and he says there'll come a time he says when you can't hardly stand and you want the doors open you want to come and I don't think it's going to because of the pressure but rather the desire in your heart just to serve him to love him to be in his presence I think some people are waiting to be forced to want to come into church but it should be our desire and a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the gate at the temple which is called Beautiful to ask alms of them that entered into the temple so if Peter and John went to the temple they saw this man quite often because it was he was there all the time now something had changed in Peter and John I know I'm not saying that when they saw him they didn't feel sorry for him maybe they did pray for him one time maybe they had asked God I don't know but something had changed foreign Peter and John about to go into the temple ask hey do you can you give me something ask alms can you know I'm hungry can you help out and Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John said look on us and he gave heed to them expecting to receive something of them now this man probably saw them Peter and John walking through there too because they went to church they gathered they were meeting they were you know and and so he's looking and he's saying um could you guys help me out maybe they had helped him out before we don't know that but there's something that had changed here then Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I Thee what a change in Peter and John's life that they knew they had that same Authority and power that they watched Jesus that they could say in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk it was Christ in them now and you know it's not no different for me and you it's Christ in you the hope of glory it's Christ in you the help to someone else it's Christ in you to give life you know and and brother Branham would get behind the pulpit and because he loved the people he would wear himself down to nothing especially when he was a younger man and he gave his all because of his love for people there was nothing about him making money off of it it was nothing about popularity it was his love for the people that caused him to do that and and here's Peter here's John and we know reading through and and how each one of them gave their lives for this gospel but they had seen a resurrected Jesus Christ and now these very promises that he heard were no longer promises they heard but a belief a revelation something that was living down inside them that they could stand in the face like David that says you're a big man and you have all of this but I got a greater God that's greater than you and I know him I've experienced him he's met with me he's been there with me he's never failed me and you take a look at David later as a king and in his failures and in his faults and his mistakes causing people to die and all these things that have happened but he was still a son of God and it's his throne that the son of a hand Son of God was in the on David's throne don't look at your life as wasted lost no hope I've made a mess you're a child of God and you'll be there because not a one of them will be lost not of one of them all that the father has given me will come now I will say this to you you don't know who they are all so give each one a chance give each one an opportunity because that one could be waiting on you you might be that little bit of water or Sunshine that they need to get that growing sometimes they sure don't look like it but us I know we were all Angels when God saved us no we weren't we needed salvation like anybody else and I like that such as I have I give thee in the name of Jesus Christ o Nazareth rise up and walk and if you read the rest of that testimony he was up and jumping and shouting and praising God in the temple it doesn't change and you know you go back and and I like to do this sometimes and just go through the prayer lines and listen to what God is doing let's know how God's Mercy is reaching out to different ones and sometimes we might get a little critical we might get a little um well we know better you know attitude but I read some of those things I really see how brother Branham handled but it wasn't brother Brandon it was a spirit of Christ working in a man that yielded himself and let himself say Lord you use me you speak you say Sister Sister he says I see you're a Christian in fact you're a minister and he's outside well sister you are wrong and condemn her he says go God bless you you and I might have a little problem with that but no the spirit of Christ is not uh could I say is not held back it's it's not uh hampered by someone who we might think is not right greater than is he that is in me than he that is in the world and I read that sometimes I say Lord what an attitude what a way how we should look at ourselves let let my spirit my attitude say hey that person could know just if they could get to know the Lord themselves or they are a Christian praise God I've had the opportunity with some folks in in going into their homes and and working in their homes you get a little bit of both I've walked into some where there's there's a really harsh spirit in there but I just have to remember greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world and and but let my light shine is there something I could say is there some way I could act that they would say what is that what is it you got sharing a testimony with a young couple they had they had just a little child with him and I was doing some work in there they looked to be in their early 20s with just maybe a two or three year old and we got to talking got to talking to them a little bit and sharing testimonies of of God's hidden power and and how God has has kept us and all and you just see if there's some reception there maybe they will some will turn you off real quick and some will listen and so I began to share some testimonies and I shared the testimony of of the life given back to the little bird when my daughter Sarah was a little girl and and and she was always at Grandpa's house and my father had always taught us that he's a living God he's the same yesterday today he still does Miracles he doesn't change he always emphasized that to us in our lives and and Sarah had brought this little little bird to to Grandpa that had somehow Tangled itself up in some string and it strangled itself and it was dead it was it was hard didn't it and she says Grandpa look at the little birdie so she takes it to to Grandpa my dad and my dad just sits here I want to show you about this God that we serve and he unwrapped the string and he said little birdie in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I give you back your life and that little bird Sarah will tell you jumped up tweeted and flew up to the tree so you can't tell her that God doesn't do those things because she's seen it you've come a little too late to tell me that God doesn't do that because I've seen him move so I shared this with him now she had big wide eyes like but he stopped and he goes sure he said quietly in Poland he goes I just can't believe that that can't beat you through and it hurt because I know it's true and I said Lord don't let them turn you away but I just kept sharing with them what I could to get them I we shared my me and Stephen were in a house and and the way she was dressed I just said where do you guys go to church we go to this Pentecostal Church down there and we begin talking about the testimonies of the goodness of God and and and and she they were both recovering from a drug addictions and they had just gotten their children back praise God for that we gave glory to the Lord he still got that works it's an attitude it's it's something that's hey there's life in me and I can give it and different things that have happened in our lives that we just know that God is the same yesterday today and forever he changes not and you know when you have a product you like I get asked quite often by the the ladies of the home mostly because they're the ones that do the cleaning what do I do how do I keep my cabinets clean and then I have to say I don't know I asked my wife no I don't say that I I know some products that are good products good tested products they work well and I know some of the ones you shouldn't use because I've seen their failures so we'll share with them these products are good this is what oh my grandma used yeah well that product's been around that long time because it's a good product it hasn't failed um you know don't wax your cabinets because it builds up wax and then it flakes off and then they call me and say my mother finish on my cabinet is falling off and I have to tell them no it's that layer of wax you put on them now you have to take it off yourself but there's some really good products and you can share those things how to take care of how to and that's just in the natural but I was talking to this it was an older couple and we were working in their house and um she said some to me and I said yes I'm a Christian and she said well there's something about your spirit that's sweet she was probably in her 70s maybe or so so we got to talk and she goes well me and my husband Minister and it was for victory Assemblies of God which has changed its name now I think Zion or something like that changed the name she says we have we have apartment Ministries so I was in there for about an hour replacing some broken parts everything and we had just a wonderful time of Fellowship and sharing the gospel I didn't tell him they were going to hell because they didn't believe it the way I believed it I didn't tell him that I told him Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I began to share with them the goodness of God in my life and as I got ready to leave she said can we pray for you she's a lady a sister no thank you no I said please Alex why not it's better than you cursing me out the house pray for me that'll be good her and her husband came up they took some oil and she said I really feel like I should pray for your eyes and my eyes have been given me a lot of problems and she said that to me she laid her hands on me and she prayed there was such a sweetness about it God takes care of his own I had I've had some that oh Lord help us but that's okay be a light around him share your testimony you know and then you can say because I've got a king I've got someone who's coming to take me home back with him there's something in me that calls out from that which I'm from I have a representation there I I don't remember it in this body but there are sometimes that he comes by and there's something that he stirs up that He blesses that he anoints that he comes and ministers to and something says yeah that's that part calling back to that which he knew from before the foundation everywhere so we're going to play a portion of this this message from the paradox and it's there where brother Branham is going out hunting and he re runs into the the uh the man there that owns the property and and brother Brandon says sends a brother Woods in just in case because he's the pastor and says I'll stay back so if they'll play that it's it's maybe 10 minutes long or somewhere around that I could read it to you for 10 minutes or we could just hear it so we could get that he had just come up to their property wanting a squirrel hunt there with brother Woods you know how it is back the country they just have one another and they look too bad we don't do that around the big cities so they um they said we and it was going to die and said well I thought well that's her I said well it's late we can't get her body out the morning said I'll get my wagon I'll go up there and get her and haul her out so we can take her to the over to Campbellsville Kentucky about 40 miles from there to the Undertaker so the Undertaker had come to the main road which is about eight miles ten miles out that he can pick her body up from there so no need to go over there at night there'll just be crying say we'll just wait till daylight said you know the next morning when I went up there that woman had cooked some fried apple pies and her husband set the table eating and she was living on barley water I thought oh I said oh no now wait a minute I said that you don't believe that he said and you don't believe it and I said well you was the one who said it I thought oh boy you go preach to me now he said you don't believe it I said man do you mean to tell me such a thing as that could happen in all these scientific age where we have the best doctor he said if you don't believe it I'll take your parent prove it to you now the Infidel 3 said to me about God I said well you uh you mean that he said yes I said well what was it he said I want to do if I ever meet that man I'm going to ask him what in the world it was that told him about that and how he know that woman but be well see so I'm going to ask him about that I said well that'd be a good thing and I said um see you mind if I have one in apples and it's laying on the ground fall of the year you know second week in August and the leaves have dropped off the tree and the apples are there and just die samples I picked it up and rubbed it on these little dirty pants and went to eat as you like them he said yeah help yourself the yellow jackets so he said the yellow jackets eat them up and you help yourself so I said all right so I went to eat I said boy it's a fine apple he said oh yes I planted that tree there myself 50 years ago that's strange I said um hey you know we're going to have an early fall I said you look there I said I wonder why them leaves are dropping off that tree before we even have a cool night August the hottest oh he said the life lifted what was that what it does say he said yes the attorney yelling drop it off I said where'd the life go he said it went down into the root I said well uh how what did it do that for see he said well it's because if you don't if it don't go down in the root he said the winner will kill the tree The Germ of life is in the in the the sap it's in the tree it goes down at the roof they bought a beautiful testimony there to see if death burial and Resurrection I said then uh what happens then does it stay down there I said no no as it comes back the next spring and brings you a bunch of apples and then you say you never seen God he said well that's just nature I said is that right that's true I said I want to ask you something about just nature tell me what intelligence of orange that tree that sap in the free it has no intelligence of its own but what intelligence runs that sap Down's Roots they get down here and hide in the depths of the earth now until All the Troubles passed that'll bring you back up again tell me the life that was in the leaf just the body to die the leaf dropped off the life itself went down coming back with the news I said the life hit went out in the ground Joel was I said like that all high me in the green he's seen the tribulation coming of course they Noah said hide he said well that's just nature and I said mister I said if I put a bucket of water out here on the post and then every August that water runs out the bottom of the post and then it's spring the year it'll come back up in a bucket again he said oh no you don't have any life I said very hard it's life I said see that's God he said you know I never thought of that I said tell me you what does that he said I don't know I don't know what does it I said it's Nation I said well who controls nature is nature an intelligence he said well I never had thought of it just like that I said I'll tell you I'm going out here squirrel hunting it's all right I said help yourself and I said when I come back when I come back you've studied real hard now and when I come back you tell me what intelligence that tells that life in that tree to go down in the root and come back next spring and I'll tell you what the same thing that told me that woman was going to live up there that had the cancer except told you I

Acton Kentucky if I remember right there and there was a man that was in New Albany Indiana and he had suffered with stomach problems for most of his life and he heard about this man William Branham that had this gift of healing and he said if I could just get to that man then I know I will be healed so he found out that this man William Branham was going to be down and acting Kentucky at the Acton Campground he drove all the way down from New Albany Indiana and he got into the prayer line the same I believe the same prayer line that this lady that brother Aaron was talking about was there that was dying he comes up to the platform and brother Branham tells him his name says your name is wheeler he said you're suffering from colitis he says go and be healed in the name of the Lord Jesus the same same um meetings I believe as this testimony that brother Aaron just gave that man was my grandfather Carl wheeler [Applause] those testimonies they are true and we wonder what a God has sent
