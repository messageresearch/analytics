him by grace [Music] amen that i might become him by grace amen let's try that song he knows my name every step that i take every move that i make [Music] and you know let's start against the verse i mean [Music] he counts the stars one and all he knows how much sand is on the shores he sees every sparrow that falls he made the mountains and the seas he's in control of everything of all creatures great and small he knows my name every step that i take every move that i make every tear that i cry oh he knows my name when i'm overwhelmed by the pain i can see the light of day i know i'll just be just fine cause he knows my name i don't know what tomorrow may bring i can't tell you what's in store i don't know a lot of things i don't have all the answers to the questions of my life [Music] he knows my name i take every move that i make every tear that i cry he knows my name when i'm overwhelmed by the pain i can't see the light of day i know i'll just be just fine cause he knows my name and he knows i thought i knew it better than that amen but he knows our name amen amen let's stand as we turn the service over to brother robert figaro he's come to minister for us this evening this thing welcome welcome holy spirit as he comes this evening [Music] legos [Music] this very [Music] we will come thee [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] this [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we will come thee we were taught by the prophet that that the holy spirit is a very sensitive nature and he won't come unless he's invited even though we can invite him with our lips but we need to invite him with our heart whereas satan he'll come whether he's invited or not if you just give him an opportunity he'll come in he won't ask permission he'll take control he'll try to destroy you just you'll try to destroy me but the holy spirit so so different from that brother brahmana said that that when we when we grieve the holy ghost he's like a dove and he takes his flight is that right he doesn't he doesn't go very far but he waits he sits there and waits until we make it right he cannot live in an unclean vessel that vessel's got to be clean so as we invite him this evening one more time if there's anything in your life right now just ask god say lord would you take this from me lord would you clean me cleanse me and wash me in your blood forgive me my mistakes my maybe something we've done in ignorance maybe sometimes we can grieve the holy ghost and as we do this this evening then we'll we'll sing that as you sing it ask god to forgive you and to cleanse you and say holy ghost we make you welcome let's sing that one more time this this evening amen [Music] can you put that on thank you welcome [Music] we will come thee come [Music] in power this very [Music] just came to my mind right now a little story that brother larry guerra told me years ago they were living in california and and uh he was in a certain room there in the house and i believe his sister was watching something on tv it was something about a witch or something and she saw something that brother right brother larry she saw something come out of that out of that screen and she felt it come into her and below there was another room the people the other family members were in the rooms and and he's and according to testimony she began to scream like a crazy woman and everybody ran into the room what's going on what what is this and she and she entered through her screams and her her her her terror she said something had come out of that tv into her and they had to pray over her she was delivered with that see satan don't ask permission just open just open the way for him he'll come in he'll come in uninvited and he'll tear your life apart that's what he is but the holy spirit if we can just cleanse the vessel long enough and open our heart to him and say lord would you come into my heart would you come and live in me lord he'll come he'll come every time he's invited there in the scriptures we know there was a there was a pharisee that invited him and whenever he's invited he'll come we may not make him welcome we could be in this sanctuary this this evening and we could be saying welcome welcome holy spirit but our heart is closed and that's that's what the pharisees simon believe his name was he invited him and they didn't greet him they didn't kiss him at the door they didn't anoint him they didn't wash his feet but he came anyway that's our lord [Music] so different amen it's good for us to have an understanding of the nature of god and also the nature of the enemy that we will be on guard amen amen if you have your bibles this evening like to turn to the scriptures i'd like to thank brother aaron for inviting me coming kind of by surprise this morning on short notice but i already i had a message ready in case he did call me and uh because he's getting shorter and shorter in the times that he gives me he might call me one of these eight to six o'clock and say brother can you be here at seven and we always need to be ready amen and i believe that uh when god calls you he'll he'll equip you he doesn't call the equipped he equips the co he he equips those he calls and is by his grace and it's a learning thing i can remember many years ago standing in this very pulpit and preaching to about four or 500 people in this church on a sunday morning and brother greene sitting behind me and i'd be just a rack of nerves and just fumbling my words and you saw how brother jordan kind of messed up a little bit up here but the ones that are doing something for god are the ones that are going to mess up you know just get up here let's do mistakes go play the piano make a mistake amen be a deacon or do something serve some other people and then make a mistake it's okay you're doing something for god because we're imperfect every one of us amen this turns to luke chapter 13 verses 22 and 24 luke 13 22-24 my message this evening is titled god's called and chosen god's called and chosen and he went through the cities and villages teaching and journeying toward jerusalem then said one unto him lord are there few that be saved and he said unto them strive to enter in at the straight gate for many i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able and that's really something that's quite a statement for the lord to make that there will be many they're going to want to enter in but they're not going to be able this evening if you feel god's called you you're blessed you're blessed because there's many out there would want to be called but if god has not elected you or anyone they can strive all they want but this evening i believe you're here this evening because god has called you there's there's something in your heart amen that this is holding you something in your heart just pulling you even when you can't even take another step when it's hard to even face another day as a song said when i'm overwhelmed yet there's something on the inside we can't explain it we can't take it out and show it to someone but it's there nonetheless and we can't get away from it you can't run from it amen maybe some of you have tried to run from it and you found you can't get away from him because he's called you amen let us pray father this evening as we attempt to open up these scriptures lord in in in this teaching lord i pray that you'll anoint my heart my lips my spirit all that i am lord in anoint every heart that's here those that are through the the media and the phones or whatever lord that they'll that there'll be a blessing come from this father maybe a greater and a better and deeper understanding of your word lord we just commit ourselves into your hands these few minutes will be here lord may it be a blessing to us lord may not just be another wednesday father but lord we we've gathered this evening lord and and you said father that you said that where two or three are gathered i'm gonna be there and lord if we could believe that then lord and we're so blessed that you've called us lord and then that you would even come and when we even invite you we have invited you lord and we've invited you into our hearts this evening lord and we're so thankful to you lord god that that you're so so gracious and so full of mercy and so tender we bless your name tonight lord be with us now that we do we ask it in jesus name and the church said god bless you may be seated this evening in matthew chapter 20 verse 16 the bible says and so the last shall be first and the first last for many be called but few chosen think about that many called but few chosen in john 3 16 i read one time where john 3 16 is the most known scripture in the bible and it it actually i preached on it here some years ago many years ago and i explained that that john 3 16 if there's a is there's a verse of scripture in the bible that tells the whole story in just a few words it's john 3 16. think about it and that's that's what the bible is all about that's what the scriptures are all about it's about god coming down and dying for us and saving us for god's soul loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever there there's that many are called whosoever amen believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life there is that whosoever many are called but few are chosen as preachers i i've been many times as an evangelist for well many years with from this church and i got to preach in places like peru and and in venezuela and brazil and and even later on in trinidad and all through mexico with brother larry and i we visited a lot of places a lot of towns and cities and i've even preached in mexico city in some meetings over there that was held by brother francisco olgin and probably about there must have been at least 1500 people there and so we through my in my little ministry that i have uh you know you you take the gospel is like a net you just cast it out and and you know it's like a fisherman to cast that net out and he brings it in well he brings in turtles he brings in sea snakes and and who knows what else comes in there but there's fish in there the net was put out for the fish but all these other things got in there but there's actual fish and that's what the gospel net is we throw the gospel in it saying whosoever if he will come if you will believe but when it comes right down to it many are called with fear chosen in matthew 7 13 and 14 again this is another uh of the same thing we just read this this evening on luke he says enter ye in at the straight gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in there you think of a way like something like a broad highway just vast and people of breasts are going and they're going down that way and they're going to destruction and then there's another place another way that he speaks about he says because straight is a gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and feuder be defined it i'm going to read that read that again because straight is the gate and narrow is the way the masses are not going down uh are not going up that that way it leadeth unto life and few there be defined it because that man asked him will there be few he said yeah there's going to be a few brother brahms said there were very few and you know but if you put in a world population i don't know the map they might there's they say there's what 3 million or so believers in this message or worldwide and of those 3 million how many are true seed i don't know but there might be several hundred thousand but worldwide so just make sure you're one of them amen the bible says that the kingdom of heaven until the days of john the baptist the kingdom of heaven suffered violence and the violent take it by force god's looking for violent people people that have backbone that are they they see the promise and they take it like jacob did he grabbed a hold of that angel he says i'm not gonna let you go see that's what god that's what god wants in this we want to have that kind of determination to have a backbone oh brother aaron didn't even shake my hand i'm not going back so backbone than that amen is that all it takes you to to stop coming to church someone just rubbed you wrong a little bit no no guys looking for people with backbone people there they have experience people that that that are full of the holy ghost amen amen hallelujah good preaching brother robert so straight is the gate there's a little uh where i live over here we we moved out of our home in benson and it was just too big for my wife and i now that we're alone and and uh elizabeth she's got a 10-acre parcel over off sonoya highway and they've got a a little apartment there and and uh so we live in a little apartment my wife in a little studio apartment for time being until our house gets sold and uh there's a little uh trail that leads it to their house and it goes down into like a royal not really on the road but yeah it is an arroyo it is but they got it covered over and then up so you go down and i found that when you go down it's easy now if you've ever been on a trail go through the hike you ever been to up in mount lammon or maybe grand canyon you like that you know what i'm talking about going down is easy that's the easy way you see and i believe that that highway with all those masses it's going down that's the easy way and then there's another little trail that once i get to the other side i get down to the bottom and i just have to go go up and that's hard by the time i get to the top i'm out of breath and the back of my legs are hurting but it's hard to go up you know when jesus left he ascended amen he didn't descend he ascended i want you to keep that in your mind and keep that picture in your mind of this this highway just full of people the majority and they're all going down that that road and then there's this way it's hard straight as a gate and there was a way and few there be defined it if we're going up that way i think we're going one we're going in single file i don't think there's even enough room to stand abreast with somebody each one we're all it's as individuals amen we're going to all meet god as individuals we're all going to be judged as individuals you're not going to be judged because daddy was a saint her mama was a scene amen you're going to stand paul said we will all stand before his tribunal we're being judged right now i believe in romans 9 16 so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runeth but of god that show with mercy wow we're here tonight as god showed us mercy we're here tonight because we were foreordained hallelujah we are the church of the predestinated far ordained amen before there was brother madam says before there was a world before there was an angel before there was an adam we were in his thoughts and he already knew us he knew the life that we would live the choices we would make in life and how we would choose him and god through that through his foreknowledge he elected us lest it be his name and so it's not anyone could say well i'm going to be a christian well it doesn't work that way you could try because jesus said many will strive to enter in amen but they're not going to make it and it's not of him that willeth nor of him that runeth but of him that of whom god showeth mercy romans 9 and 6 thank you for the water appreciate that not as though the word of god hath taken none effect for they are not all israel which are of israel neither because they are the seed of abraham are they all children in isaac shall thy seed be called remember now abraham had other children other than isaac he had ishmael but it was through isaac that the election came and jacob had no choice he never had a choice ishmael never had a choice you know it was it was through jacob excuse me or isaac and isaac never had a choice against still but isaac never had a choice and jacob never had a choice he was born through isaac amen and those that came out of ishmael they didn't have a choice that is they verse 8 which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of god but the children of the promise are counted for the seed so ishmael went off with his line and they were not the children of god they were the children of abraham to this day they call themselves the children of abraham and they are but they're not the seed there was a separation there was a separation there that is it says verse 9 for this is the word of promise at this time will i come and sarah shall have a son not only this but when rebecca also had conceived by one even by our father isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election you see the election there is a purpose of god according to election god has a purpose in that not of works not he that willeth not he that runeth not of works but of him that calleth there it is there's a key there's the election but of him to calleth it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger as it is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated there was a war in that room you know that don't you they fought each other and and and it looked like jacob was going to come and all of a sudden he got pulled back and here comes esau and when esau came out jacob had a hold of his of his foot i believe it was they were fighting in there for that for that promise of to be a firstborn what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with god god forbid because you got to remember that that election and that foreign knowledge comes through his knowledge of what we would choose because there is there is there is a choice in that a free moral agency is is what i want to say we're all free moral agents we have that ability to choose and and because of that god knew what our choosing would be and god chose us the elected and called us from that for he saith to moses verse 15 i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion don't though so then it is not of him that willeth nor him that runeth but of god to show of mercy for the scripture saith unto pharaoh even for this same purpose have i raised thee up that i might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth you see he didn't raise pharaoh up to save him he didn't raise pharaoh up to make him a child of god he raised pharaoh up to show his power because he knew pharaoh was going to withstand him he knew pharaoh would stand against moses he knew pharaoh would stand against the people of israel the jewish people and and so pharaoh came at that time there was an appointed time for him to be upon the earth that he might show forth what he was therefore have he mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth he hardeneth remember he hardened his heart it wasn't for that heart was not made to receive the word of god it was made to be hardened but yet there is there's warnings in the scriptures for us they're in hebrews paul says take heed lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief a hardened heart in departing for the living god amen we got to be careful because our heart can be hardened read that scripture take it there in hebrews somewhere you'll find it and there he talks about the hearting of the heart we have to be careful of the heart that we that god has given us the heart when it's we're talking about the heart we're not talking about this organ it's pumping blood it is the essence of who you are the heart the the heart of man is is is used interchangeably with soul and heart soul and heart it's the same thing it's who you are and on the inside the real you jesus said a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things and he goes out and he says but i say to you that every idle word that man shall speak they she shall give her the count thereof for by thy word thou shall be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned jesus said that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh so what comes out of our mouth is coming out of our heart so you want to know where you stand watch what you say i always say be careful of what you say i would say get the heart changed take a change of heart be born again by the spirit of god that that heart will be changed amen so when when you do speak you'll speak good things you'll speak blessings you'll speak the positive things of god the yea and the amen of god verse 19 thou will say unthen unto me why does he yet find fault for who has resisted his will nay but o man who art thou that replies against god shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why has all made me thus hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor i can remember many years ago by the larry in guadalajara that brother brother took also with that that place and they when they made the pottery and the man was pit with the little petals and and he was forming that thing and well if you if he didn't like it you just take it throw it aside or or remake it and that and you know we sing the song about where it's a potter i am the clay mold me and make me but sometimes it hurts the trials we go through the things that come our way we say oh lord please no don't let this sit oh god please no but he what does he do he's the potter trust in him whatever the trial trusts in him hold on amen no matter what hold on i can remember some time ago that my son was telling me and i didn't realize is that we had done this but he said he we were after my our daughter passed away while we them after the memorial we we came down with kobe really bad my wife and i and and he brought us he had taken us to the hospital he gave us a treatment and brought us back i was so weak i could hardly take a few steps and and he said he brought it they brought us back to our home and i sat down on the sofa my wife sat down with another in the love seat and we're just sitting there and just really not just sick real sick and he put some music on and he just thought well i'll just put this certain music i'm not giving this testimony before i don't know if i did it or not but um when when my daughter when we had the memorial one of the songs we sang is uh and and and uh like i said i might have given it here before i don't know if i did or not but uh that had a special meaning for us and i lifted my hands lord even though i have no strength in me i lift up my hands lord though i have many problems you know and it's a beautiful song and levanto mismano [Music] i lift up my hands so i have many problems when i lift up my hands my problems disappear amen and it's a beautiful song and and he put he put something on and the unbeknownst to him the first song was levanto mismanus and we started start playing that in there in the room and he turned around he looked at us and there was me and my wife with our hands up in the air you know all the pain that we were suffering everything is just it was just natural it was just a thing that we do as christians there's things that just we just do it amen i i told the church one time we come to church because that's what we're about on sunday we're at church amen the bible says and and forsaken not the assembling of ourselves together amen as a matter of sum is but so much more as you see that they approaching as we and we're seeing it friends there's never been a day like this day if god would just open our eyes and we could see the day we're living in right now we see this right now there's a there's a potential uh uh uh thing of a world war taking place right now we have russia standing up right there and he is threatening the world with nuclear warfare and the and the nations are still pumping all these arms into ukraine even then and everybody's fearing you you could see the news that we're going to get dragged into a war we're at the end friend we don't know how it's going to come but with it when they shall say say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman and they shall not escape we're living in a hard time right now but he is a potter and we are the clay have not the powder power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto water and another unto this honor what if god's willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction hath not the potter power over the clay i was praying this morning and and as i began to pray for you for ukraine and even for those russian soldiers that if you've been reading the news they don't want to be there they're deserting they're they they're these young men they adam said that they caught prisoners that they weren't even even told what was going on that they were going into a war and these are young men 18 years old 20 years old and i don't know some there might be some of our brothers over there in that war in russia we have brethren in russia we have brethren in ukraine i heard a testimony that there was a family i believe it was a message family that were they were in their home and a missile a missile those things are big but besides the piano came crashing into their backyard i heard another story there was a family of eight or nine and they were praying in the living room and a missile came crashing through the through the uh the roof into the kitchen and there's a picture of that thing right there where the stove or whatever this thing and that big old missile right and didn't explode the one that fell in that backyard did not explode it would have taken the whole block let alone the house but i believe god is going to protect his people pray for them we don't know who you know the suffering that's going on over there it's unbelievable and i was praying i was saying lord and i thought about this evil man putin i thought lord why don't you destroy that man he's evil and if you ever read anything of the things he's done he's had people poisoned he's had people assassinated anybody they're afraid of they're so afraid of him that's why he's in power and he sends out he lets him know you you buck me and i'll kill you i'll have you killed he's had people shot in the streets he's had people poisoned he's a murderer and and he's a liar and he's he's holding on to power by fear and he's evil and i said lord take that man out destroy that evil in that nation but we know that in all of this god's his purpose is going to be fulfilled what if god willing to show his wrath to make his power known endured with much long suffering suffering the vessels of wrath putin is one of them fitted to destruction we know what his eternal destination is hath not the powder power of the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor what if god's willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction in isaiah 35 and 8 it says in a highway shall there be and away a highway there shall be and away and it shall be called the way of holiness not the highway of holiness but the way of holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the wayfaring men thou fools shall not error therein so we're walking up this of this way of holiness sometimes we can be a fool we can do stupid things but we're still not going to err god chose us the only reason we're on this way because god elected us otherwise we'd be on the other one we're going up it is hard it's not easy it's a struggle we have to strive what does thrive mean you fight you give it all you got you you you you push you you battle amen you put on the armor of god and you face that devil every day brother that was our in our church i don't think he knew brother dana thornhill but he he's in jail now and he's been writing to me ever since he went to jail and and we help him out with a monthly help of money to help him with his his needs but he's serving god in there and he's in his letters are coming to me just a life of he spends four or five hours in prayer reading his bible witnessing to everybody there just living for god and he believes that this is where this is where he needed to be and it was hard but that's where god has him he had a young man come to him tell and said and and argued with him because about about being holy before the lord is no i said we're god we're sinners we're going to sin just get used to it god's going to forgive you anyhow but it's not that way friends there's a holiness without holiness no man shall see god and this way the unclean shall not pass over it so we gotta fight that if we stop fighting them you know what this flesh is going to do it's going to backslide you realize we're always when it comes to the lord we're in continual motion at all times there's no standing still you're either moving forward or you're backing up you're backsliding either you're moving forward with god and hopefully in the way not in that one but walking up that that way fighting the battle every day fighting this whole flesh as i said before maybe i've said it here in all flesh don't want to serve god old flesh don't want to read his bible old flesh don't want to pray you know what you got to do you guys say flesh you're going to pray flesh you're going to church it's sunday morning you're going to church flesh don't want to go you know paul said i i i he talked about taking this flesh and putting it and subjecting it to the word of god i believe that's where he says lest i after after having preached the gospel i myself become a caster we we take this flesh and we subject it by the power of the holy spirit amen first we need the holy ghost but you can have the holy ghost and still be backsliding the holy ghost will take his flight you've got to get the holy ghost in you you got to start pressing the battle amen it's not an easy it's not an easy thing the lord spoke to me some time ago and i was thinking about all that as god's transpired the last few months in our life and where we're at right now my wife and i and what she's been through seven operations already in the last three years it's been a hard time for us it's been very hard and the lord spoke to my heart and he said son i never said it would be easy and that stayed with me it strengthened me when you realize when you realize friend that you're on this way you're you're ascending you're not descending you're ascending you're fighting the battle god's saying it's not going to be easy son it's not a better roses it's not a picnic in the park it's a battle it's a fight a highway and a way jesus in john 14 6 said i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me hallelujah i am the way hey i am the true ooh i am the life the lord jesus christ and no man coming if unto the father but by me so come and drink from the waters of life hallelujah i am the way i am the way hallelujah psalms 118 19 open to me the gates of righteousness i will go into them and i will praise the lord this gate of the lord into which the righteous shall enter hallelujah job 17 9 the righteous also shall hold on his way and he that have clean hands shall be stronger and stronger can you believe that this evening god's going to strengthen you when you think you can't even take another step god is right there i'll never leave you nor forsake you but i'll be with you until the end of the age stronger and stronger psalms 24 3-5 who shall ascend into the hill of the lord i like that because we're ascending we're not we're not descending in the highway where the millions and millions and millions are going down the easy way to destruction but we're ascending and away hallelujah who shall ascend into the hill of the lord or who shall stand in his holy place he that have clean hands and a pure heart who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully he shall receive the blessing of the lord how many want the blessing of the lord amen to hear those words welcome oh good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the lord amen he shall receive the blessing from the lord and righteousness from the god of his salvation jesus when he left he ascended into heaven we're ascending the hill hallelujah and let me tell you when you go walk up a hill if you ever go out and you'll find yourself remember this that's hard it's not easy to ascend the hill your muscles are aching and you're maybe you're out of breath and you're so tired you want to stop and rest you want to go back down because it's easier going down no no keep ascending keep walking keep going forward with god that is the hard way not the easy way the highway is the easy way and many they're going to destruction as jesus said many bear be which go in there at why is it hard jesus never never told us it would be easy in luke 6 22 he said blessed are ye when men shall hate you and when men shall separate you from their company and shall reproach you and cast out your name as evil for the son of man's sake if you live your life wherever if you live this life at work at school wherever you go they're going to separate you they will they don't they they won't want nothing to do with you they're going to hate you blessed are you women shall revile you hate you persecute you for for my sake he said hallelujah first john 3 13 marvel not my brethren if the world hates you sometimes people will hate you and you don't even know why john 15 17 if the world hate you you know that it hated me before it hated you glory to god proverbs 2 8 he keepeth the paths of judgment and preserveth the way of his saints what's god doing he's preserving our way you know he made a way already he's a way maker is that right jesus is a waymaker he made a way he made a way for me amen we're walking on the footsteps in the footprints the bloody footprints of our lord who goes before us amen leaving as a song says leading in the fight with a tender handout stretch to the valley low guiding me i can see as i outward go glory to god matthew 7 21-23 not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven remember many will seek to enter in jesus said many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in your name you know prophesied brother says means preach have we not prophesied in your name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you there was a man named todd something or other some years back came out out of canada tattoos all over him and this is evangelist and he hits people that come and he supposedly he prays for people and get healed he and i don't know if you've ever heard of this man but he'll he'll punch him in the in the gut or kick them or something like that something's wrong with that fella but you know people are being healed give god the glory not that man and i heard that he had had some revivals in florida and been going on for weeks have been many many many healed there was there was reports of the dead being raised i don't know about that but that's what they say and during that time that he he was having those revivals he was living in adultery with another woman many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils remember judas what did he do the son of perdition that the bible says it would have been better better had he not ever been born cast out devils and done many wonderful works and then when i professed it to them i never knew you depart for me he didn't work in equity in the messenger seal of god in 54 brother brown says and they were given power to go out and preach the gospel and cast out devils and to heal the sick judas iscariot in matthew 10 was mentioned among them and they went out and cast out devils and preached the gospel in such a way till sinners repented and devils left and they come back rejoicing and shouting and having a big time like a little holiness camp meeting and judas was right there with him that's exactly right right along there with him isaiah 41 8 to 13. but thou israel are my servant jacob whom i had chosen the seed of abraham my friend thou whom i have taken from the ends of the earth and called thee from the chief man among and said unto thee thou art my servant i have chosen thee and not cast away it's always god's choosing fear thou not for i am thee with thee be be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen the yea i will help thee yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness my wife when she went to the first operations of her legs she had no she had no blood flow to her foot and her and her foot had turned black and the doctor looked at it and he said this gangrene and so she went into an operation they had to they did a bypass for oh they first say the first thing they did put a stent he did did that on a monday i believe and and or tuesday it was a tuesday and during the day and that night at st joseph i went to visit her and and the next morning they saw the stent didn't work so they did a uh angioplasty as well and that didn't work and it came down to where he had to do a bypass where they take a vein out of the an artery out of the other leg and put it in this this leg on the on the leg that's bad to get that blood flow going again and that night that we were waiting that we were at the saint joseph's when they dismissed the it was before before covet they dismissed the the the visitors on the pa there was a lady got on because it's a catholic hospital they gave a scripture and they gave this scripture right here fear not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee yea i will help the yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness and and then that next mor that not that same day cam on my daughter-in-law to you know to encourage us had given us that scripture and i heard it on the pa at st joseph's that night the next morning when she when the doctors called it they were going to do an operation and do the bypass that's a six hour operation and it was very serious and and so i went into the that little room where they prepare her and it's just me and her and i had my i don't have it today but i had my little uh my little pad and i got all my sermons in there and i was looking for something for a scripture to encourage me and just going through some sermons and i found the sermon i forget which one it was and and i started looking i always have a scripture at the at the front of that sermon and the beginning of the sermon and and and i found one that randomly and i looked at it and that scripture was isaiah again fear not for i am with thee be done this made for i am thy god hallelujah i will strengthen thee yea i will help thee yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness god speaks through his word friends let me tell you when you need that that will strengthen you it will encourage you and i encourage you this evening read the bible read the word whenever you get a chance to hear a tape hear the here brother branham talk about the especially the old ones where where he's praying for the sick and all the tremendous things that are taking place people being healed of cancers and all these things happening it'll encourage you form that atmosphere around you of encouragement of the positive word of god amen and i was i was walking i take a little walk out there between the homes and every every morning and every after evening to walk our little dog and i have uh i had my phone i got the message and i was playing it and he's talking about john ryan and i'm going to close in a few minutes and he's talking about john ryan and how the john ryan had come he was blind he was a catholic and uh and brother brahms uh asked him if he believed he said yes i believe he'd seen he'd seen some other miracles or heard that he was there miracles taking place and he took faith and believed in that he said and and so he said yes i believe he says okay he says just go on you're healed in the name of jesus go on he walked out he went sat down and he's still blind so he gets back up and he gets back in the line again he's fighting the ushers and brother bass well that didn't come through he said well brother brahm you said i was healed he said you are healed but i can't see it has nothing to do with it it has nothing to do with it but we said well if i can't see that how am i healed is you just believe god don't look at the circumstance just believe that you're healed begin what do i do brother branham well he said he said first you said i'm healed and brother i said well you said you believed well what do i do go praising god go thanking god for your healing and so the next few services after that he'd be up on the balcony and brother brown said he'd be preaching the sermon and just in the middle of all that he's jump up and say praise god i'm healed hallelujah i'm healed i can see and the ushers came to brother brown and says we should we take him out he's no no no leave him alone i told him to do that let him do it amen so he continued to do that out in the street selling the papers amen extra x-ray here hear all about it praise the lord i can see praise the lord i'm healed blind as he could be just people thought he was crazy you know the story there at that barber shop got to open his eyes amen so when you get prayed for don't look at the circumstance no more god is your god is my healer amen and just believe it and say lord thank you you might have you might have a stomachache so bad say thank you lord for healing me thank you lord and just go out praising him and every chance you get give him thanks and tell people don't be ashamed tell people i'm healed but you're not yes i am i'm healed praise god i'm healed you watch your faith line up your faith will line up with that and it'll take place amen just as sure amen i told my wife she they they found that her is that your right your right eye that she can't see nothing and the left eye is probably about 60 percent and and they they checked her yesterday i said honey i don't care what they say you're healed praise god she's healed amen my wife can see she's healed that that i that i will come open again he did for john ryan what he did for him he'll do for her amen we you know what what's happening with us we conform too much we conform to our sickness we get used to it and that's just the way it's going to be oh well you know i got this gout or i got this problem or i got that bro i got diabetes no no don't conform to it fight the battle fight that thing believe god we're fighting about that's the devil putting that on you god didn't put that on you amen he didn't he didn't give you that blindness he didn't give you the diabetes the devil put that on you fight don't conform to this believe say i'm gonna believe i've been prayed for i've been anointed by with oil and i'm gonna believe god he's my healer and i will be healed fight the battle don't conform be not conformed to this world but being transformed by the renewing of your mind you might prove it is that good and perfect will of god hallelujah amen we find that abraham was not cast away and i'm going to quote close with this quote from brother branham and in the seven church ages he says the lord god almighty says i know there he is walking in the midst of his people you know the the seven golden candlesticks and he there he was walking among them as the son of god as as the whole brother mother man says it was the holy spirit throughout the ages as he walked even now we're with us because we're still this is still a lady you see in church age he said there he is a chief shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he stem the tribulation no he does not he simply says i know and i'm so happy brother jordan sang that song he knows my name every step that i take every tear that he knows he knows what you're going every detail in your he knows hallelujah is i am not at all unmindful of your suffering what a stumbling block this is to so many people like israel they they wondered if god really loves him how can god be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer see our thinking why would god why would god want me to suffer why would god not take this thorn in my flesh why would not god take this away from me right now no he he's trying to bring you through he's a potter you're the clay he's forming you he's making you and sometimes it hurts because but there is a purpose in your suffering there is a purpose if it wasn't for that where would you be if everything was well you're healthy everybody's healthy you got money in the bank you got a new car a new home you got this and everything is going your way will you ever think to even stop and pray and thought and thank god for anything we will get away from god we forget him but the problems of these things it keeps us just praying and seeking the lord amen it does something to our heart it changes us how can god be justified if he stands by and watches his people suffer what is that is what they ask in malachi 1 1-3 the burden of the word of the lord to israel by malachi i have loved you saith the lord yet you say where it is thou love does they're telling god this where have you loved us was not esau jacob's brother saith the lord yet i loved jacob and hated esau and laid his mountains in his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness you see they could not figure out god's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that meant love love meant a baby with parental care have you ever watched a parent with a baby man they don't want to fly the land on his forehead that's parental care they're going to go out they're going to take them out and it's maybe 60 degree or they wrap him up more blankets and probably suffocate the kid more than anything else because they don't want they don't want him to suffer any cold at all that's parental care but god doesn't do that with us he wants to see men and women with backbone they'll face the the rugged sea amen they'll stand up for god they won't be ashamed of the gospel they will proclaim the gospel and believe with all their heart no matter what comes their way whether a thousand fall to the right ten thousand it doesn't matter the believer he hangs on amen parental care but god said that his love was elective love hallelujah back to that election again he elected you that's why he loves you lord but lord why am i so god do you love me lord are you done satan will come say he don't love you look at you look what you know what you did look how you act look how you say look looks temper flared up again he'll he don't care about you look what he did to you he took this away from you this one died and this happened this other happened he don't care for you no no no you don't don't fall back on that you fall back and wait a minute i know he loved me because he chose me amen i am a son of god for his many years are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for god has not given us a spirit of bondage again to fear but he's given us a spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father we cry daddy hallelujah you're my heavenly father and i believe you lord i'm gonna hang on no matter what no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation amen because god hath chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief in the truth he may commit you to death as he did paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is sovereign but it is all with a purpose you know the unbeliever his house burns down and the believer his house burns down the believer his child dies the unbeliever his child dies so what's the difference the difference is that we as believers god is making us informing us and we stand there we're the only thing we're gonna take with us we're not taking our bank account if we have one we're not taking our beautiful car or our beautiful home no we're only taking our character that's what's with the essence of who you are that character that love that god has placed in your heart without perfect love you're not going to make it we've got to have that perfect love amen and that's the only thing that's going to go out of here with us is the character that he made in us while we were here upon the earth that came through manifold temptations and sufferings amen the things that you've suffered the the the tears that you've cried by yourself that nobody even knows the hurt that's in your heart god's taking that say you say you pray say lord take these sufferings lord and these things and mold my heart into a heart lord where you can write your word in me and i can believe every word with with my heart he may commit you as he did job that is his prerogative he is sovereign if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect amen be established strengthened and settled as job said he put strength in us you see he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered hebrews 5 8 to dine though he was a son yet he learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him in plain language the very character of jesus was perfected by suffering that character to be like jesus to be like jesus on earth i long to be like him well are you ready to suffer amen when it comes your way just hang on to god let the holy spirit take that and it'll form you it'll bring that it's like brother brahma said god takes that flower and he crushes it like he did brother branham's life when he's lost his wife his little baby and all he went through many of his family members died he took that flower and he crushed it till the fragrance come out god will take you as a flower and sometimes he's got to crush you a little bit to bring out that fragrance amen that the holy ghost is doing something inside your life your heart's being formed your heart's being changed hallelujah your character is taking on the character of jesus christ you have to suffer he says unless we suffer we cannot reign with him we have to suffer to reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory what what what statements tremendous statements are made here character is a victory not a gift hallelujah a man without character cannot reign because power of power apart from character is what satanic that's that vladimir putin no character he's got power he's got no character that's satanic that was hitler that was stalin all these men that are ruled saddam hussein were men with much power but they had no character and they were instruments of satan but we god wants to put power in our hands he's placed power in our hands i've given you power over over scorpions and serpents and over all the power of the enemy we are the sons of god this morning i've got a message on that maybe i'll preach that one day here we are the sons of god now are we the sons of god now we're gonna be the sons of god brother passes we are now the sons of god the power is there now but it takes character to wield that power but power without characters is it but power with character is fit to rule and says he wants us to share even his throne his throne on the same basis that he overcame and he sat down in his father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes amen oh what treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation remember it's ascending on that hard way not the easy way it's a way that we we need to put on the armor of god and if you read those little scriptures at the end it says praying always how do we armor up in our prayer that's where we armor up when you pray and you ask god you ask god for that strength you start asking god lord and give me that that strength to fight the devil give me the strength for the day give me the help me for this day help me bring me through this day lord don't worry about tomorrow get through this day get through this day tomorrow jesus said has evils of his own sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof amen get through this day one day at a time sweet jesus and pray and say lord put the arm around me let me armor up father it's the armor is a is a is a spiritual armor that we put on he said think about strange concerning the fury of fiery trials that are to try you that is what peter said it is is it strange that god wants us to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering no sir we all have trials we have all we are all tried and is chasing the sons not one but goes through that the church is not is not suff that is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of god wow you see what you've been through with the church do you see that he says the church is not suffering is not of god hebrews 12 6 through 8 for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourges every son who he whom he receiveth but he if he be without chastisement we're of all are partakers then you are bastards and not sons now this special condition of smyrna must be applied to every age there is no age free from it there is no true believer free from it what suffering this is of god this is the will of god it is needful we need the lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be christ-light in doing it love suffereth long and his kind matthew 5 11-12 blessed are ye when men shall revile you can persecute you and shall say o man or evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you the cloudy skies almost done and storms of life listen to this the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of god's disapproval neither are bright skies and still waters signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world hallelujah amen does he love us ah yes yes does he love you does do you think do you believe he loves you amen but how shall we know he asks a question how shall we know how can i know lord that you love me look what i'm going through lord look all of suffering oh god how can i know we shall know because he said so hallelujah he said it i believe it amen and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit placing us as sons and how shall i prove my love to him by believing what he said and conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass amen that's what god's it's his will amen it was in his life he didn't even spare himself and he look what he look what he went through he was despised he was rejected of gol reads isaiah and they're in the psalms where he talks how he was despised and rejected and hated of all men he suffered like no human being had ever suffered because he had that love amen that such love that he even when they were hammering nails into his flesh he could say father forgive them oh he not he didn't revile back when he spit in his face and yanked the beard out of his face when he smote him with that with that with that whip and yanked the flesh off his back and the blood just flew bled out of him i believe there was more blood god had to produce blood in his body so he could bleed more i believe there was something going on supernaturalness in his body that was producing more blood just so it could bleed out he bled when they struck him with a whip tore all the flesh off his back they pulled the beard just put the crown of thorns on his forehead and smashed it down into the bone of his skull and the blood just came down his face they smote him with a rod they struck him and then they hung him on a cross and they put a spear in the side where did all that blood come from blood all over everything my mind and that's what the life he lived god help us to stand up and be strong christians lord strengthen us you'll stand with me this evening hallelujah let's sing that song again he knows my name how many love the lord tonight amen [Music] hallelujah he counts the stars one and all he knows how much sand is on the shores he sees every sparrow that falls he made the mountains and the seas he's in control of everything of all creatures great and small amen he knows my name every step that i take every move that i make every tear that i cry oh he knows my name when i'm overwhelmed by the pain i can't see the light of day oh i know i'll be just fine cause he knows my name hallelujah i don't know what tomorrow may bring i can't tell you what's in store i don't know a lot of things [Applause] oh i don't have the answers to the questions of life but i know in whom i have believed hallelujah and he knows my name every step that i take every move that i make every tear that i cry and he knows my name when i'm overwhelmed by the pain i can't see the light of day i know i'll be just fine cause he knows my name [Music] father tonight lord as we leave this place lord may we not forget lord we're ascending and it's a struggle and it's hard you even told your prophet he had chosen the hard way hallelujah hallelujah but it was a great portion of heaven awaited him because he had chosen that way and each one of us as individuals we have to make a choice lord and this evening i choose the hard way lord i choose the way of holiness i ascend the hill to come into the presence of almighty god lord it's the hard way you never said it would be easy lord god but you said you'd be with us you said that lord that you had overcome and because you overcame we can also overcome we bless your name tonight lord hallelujah bless your people tonight lord i pray that something was said lord would bless someone encourage someone not to give up not to give up but hang on hang on hallelujah the anchor holds hallelujah though the the ship is battered lord and though the way has been hard and it's been a hard struggle and maybe by myself you're by yourself but this evening we know that you're with us lord blessed be thy name worship you this in jesus name amen the anchor holds i was telling brother aaron that last december when we right after our daughter passed away we we made our plans to go to pennsylvania to be with our daughter jessica and we were at the airport in cleveland and we're coming down a short escalator and i should have taken the the elevator because of my wife but she'd been doing okay on the escalators so we're coming down to go get our baggage claim it was a short one and she and i got on and then she got on she put one foot on and the other foot wasn't quick enough and that thing just made her do a split there on the and she fell on the escalator so i hear i'm going back up while the thing is coming down to help her and i had a backpack on my back i'm trying to pull her up and she's pulling on me and also the weight of the backpack it made me fall back on the escalator itself and so here we are we hit the bottom and the escalator is moving underneath us and i can't get up that backpack is holding me and i can't i couldn't grab anything but i think a lot
