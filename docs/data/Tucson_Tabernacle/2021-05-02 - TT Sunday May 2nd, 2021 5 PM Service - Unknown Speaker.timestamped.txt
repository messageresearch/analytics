[24:58] lord and
[24:58] bless this service we ask in jesus name
[25:01] amen praise the lord if you have your
[25:04] bibles let's go back to luke chapter 17.
[25:09] i want to just launch from this area i
[25:11] don't know where we'll land
[25:13] but we got to launch from somewhere
[25:16] luke chapter 17.
[25:19] amen we read this verse this morning but
[25:21] i just want to come back to luke 17
[25:23] verse 20.
[25:29] and when he was demanded of the
[25:30] pharisees when the kingdom of god should
[25:32] come he answered them and
[25:34] said the kingdom of god cometh not with
[25:36] observation
[25:38] neither shall they say lo here or lo
[25:40] there for behold
[25:42] the kingdom of god is within you the
[25:45] kingdom of god is within you and i just
[25:47] want to
[25:47] kind of talk a little bit more about
[25:49] that tonight you can have your seats
[25:51] keep your bibles close to you
[25:53] we're going to need our bibles amen if
[25:56] there ever
[25:56] was a time that we needed our bibles we
[25:59] need it now
[26:00] amen we sing a little song in times like
[26:03] these you need a savior it's a real old
[26:05] hymn sister yarborough
[26:06] my father in them used to sing it and it
[26:08] says end times like these we need an
[26:10] anchor
[26:11] everybody needs an anchor if you ever
[26:13] been on a boat and the winds start
[26:15] uh blowing and if you know anything
[26:17] about boating when the winds come they
[26:19] roll
[26:20] like this and if you get your boat
[26:22] sideways in the roll
[26:24] your boat will roll over but if you
[26:26] throw an anchor out that's why it's
[26:27] impossible for a boat with an anchor to
[26:29] ever sink because when you throw your
[26:31] anchor out
[26:32] it goes and the winds blow the boat and
[26:34] so rather than the waves going this way
[26:36] you throw an anchor out and then the
[26:37] boat always turns towards anchor and
[26:39] then it pierces the waves
[26:41] and breaks the waves it's amazing if you
[26:44] have an
[26:45] anchor when times of trouble you will
[26:47] always face your anchor
[26:49] amen in times of trouble in times of
[26:52] trouble you will always
[26:53] face face your anchor it's it's a kind
[26:56] of an interesting thing i told
[26:57] somebody they said well i don't believe
[26:59] in preachers and doctrines and you know
[27:01] the saying goes like that i said you
[27:02] know how to figure out who your pastor
[27:04] is
[27:05] i said when your child gets hit by a car
[27:07] the person that you call is your pastor
[27:08] your spiritual anchor that you're
[27:10] looking to
[27:11] all of us need an anchor in jesus christ
[27:14] when troubling time
[27:15] come amen we need to look to the word of
[27:17] god amen that's what david said
[27:19] david had an anchor it was jesus christ
[27:21] he said when my heart is overwhelmed
[27:23] lead me to the rock that is higher than
[27:25] i i've been overwhelmed many times in my
[27:27] life
[27:28] amen david said i cried unto the lord
[27:30] and he heard me and delivered me out of
[27:32] all of my fears i'm so thankful as a
[27:35] christian we have a place to go brother
[27:36] lyle
[27:37] amen it's not a we don't serve a dead
[27:39] god a god of wood and stone we serve a
[27:41] god that's living
[27:42] amen he lived in the bible and they
[27:44] wrote a story about him but that god of
[27:46] the bible still lives today
[27:48] can you say amen to that it should be
[27:49] something you've experienced in your
[27:51] life that god's changed your life and
[27:53] amen we had some this morning that made
[27:55] a decision for christ and
[27:57] and decided that they wanted to follow
[27:58] christ and give their heart solely to
[28:00] christ and that's a great place to start
[28:02] and a place to repentance
[28:03] but that's just a place to start amen
[28:06] that's when you get up and you start
[28:07] growing in grace and the knowledge of
[28:09] jesus christ
[28:11] you know we were talking this morning
[28:12] about the kingdom of god and i wanted to
[28:14] talk
[28:15] also about the kingdom of the devil but
[28:16] we never got to that
[28:18] because the kingdom of god is so big
[28:20] it's so wonderful
[28:21] amen in this kingdom there's healing
[28:24] there's deliverance there's power
[28:26] there's life there's hope there's no
[28:28] depression there's no anxiety it's just
[28:30] joy unpeaceable
[28:32] unspeakable and it's full of glory in
[28:34] the kingdom of god
[28:35] amen the spirit of god is a kingdom
[28:37] jesus they were looking for a physical
[28:39] kingdom but jesus was talking about a
[28:41] spiritual kingdom that would be inside
[28:43] of them
[28:44] i was thinking about the angels when
[28:45] they came all of us loved christmas
[28:47] story and
[28:48] the angels come and they sing and the
[28:50] angel came to mary and said
[28:51] his kingdom shall be great i believe it
[28:54] says in the book of daniel of his
[28:55] kingdom there shall be no
[28:56] end brother aaron there will be no end
[28:58] to this kingdom
[29:00] we live in a world now and the kingdoms
[29:02] of this world and the presidents and the
[29:04] nations are all great but there's coming
[29:05] a day
[29:06] daniel saw the prophecy that there would
[29:08] be a stone cut out of the mountains
[29:10] it would roll down it would destroy all
[29:12] the kingdoms of the world
[29:14] and we have a promise that jesus is
[29:15] coming to set up his kingdom
[29:17] amen a natural kingdom and of that
[29:19] kingdom there will be no end
[29:21] and then it all starts with the
[29:22] spiritual kingdom we read this morning
[29:24] how they came to take jesus by force
[29:27] and uh pilate came to him and said look
[29:29] uh look uh
[29:31] why aren't you why don't you answer me
[29:32] jesus said if my kingdom were of this
[29:34] world my servants they would fight
[29:36] they would all get swords remember peter
[29:38] got that
[29:39] people i think john my brother went
[29:41] through that at easter time he said he
[29:42] was going through
[29:43] remember it's friday sunday is coming
[29:45] remember that message some of you all
[29:46] remember that
[29:47] and then he preached saturday it's
[29:49] saturday but sunday is coming
[29:51] i think he left here and preached
[29:52] another message it's pentecost how did
[29:55] he say it
[29:55] no it's resurrection but pentecost is
[29:57] coming
[29:58] amen the pentecost is coming and so we
[30:01] know the disciples there when they were
[30:02] there and peter pulls out his sword when
[30:04] they come to get jesus he pulls his
[30:05] sword out
[30:06] and he goes to cut the man's head off he
[30:08] wasn't aiming for his ear jonah
[30:10] but the guy must have moved and had just
[30:11] cut his ear off but jesus reached and
[30:14] picked up the
[30:14] his the man's ear and he told peter what
[30:17] he said put away your sword put your
[30:20] sword away i'm not trying to build a
[30:22] natural kingdom
[30:23] i'm building a spiritual kingdom and
[30:25] this kingdom is inside of you
[30:27] as i began to think about this subject a
[30:29] little bit more
[30:30] i i was thinking about god the bible
[30:33] says in saint john chapter 4
[30:36] verse 24 that god is a spirit the bible
[30:39] says in a no pla another place no man
[30:41] has seen god at any time god is a spirit
[30:43] but this god wanted to become flesh he
[30:46] wanted to be
[30:47] something that people could touch and he
[30:48] could be handled he was
[30:50] the great creator we could go back in
[30:52] genesis in the beginning god created the
[30:54] heavens and the earth
[30:55] we don't believe there was a big bang
[30:57] and all of this happened
[30:58] how the one man said if you believe in
[31:00] evolution he said it takes greater faith
[31:02] to believe in evolution
[31:04] than it does the bible said if you can
[31:06] believe in evolution then you can
[31:07] believe a man can walk past the print
[31:09] shop
[31:10] light a stick of dynamite throw it
[31:11] inside the print shop and there's a big
[31:13] bang and out comes webster's
[31:15] dictionary with all the definitions and
[31:18] the problem
[31:18] the the adverbs and the adjectives and
[31:21] the nouns and the pronouns all of it and
[31:23] the definitions
[31:24] it takes more faith to believe that and
[31:26] that would happen than it does to
[31:28] believe in the beginning god
[31:30] created the heavens and the earth and so
[31:32] we believe that as christians we believe
[31:34] god created the heavens and the earth
[31:36] then we come to the new testament saint
[31:38] john chapter one i gave some of these
[31:39] verses to the brothers
[31:41] i'm learning how to work together with
[31:42] some of this technology thing so you
[31:44] bear with me if i make mistakes
[31:47] but i was thinking there in saint john
[31:49] chapter one verse one the bible says in
[31:50] the beginning was the word
[31:52] the word was with god and the word was
[31:54] god
[31:55] now this bible wasn't written in the
[31:57] beginning
[31:59] somebody wrote the book of genesis does
[32:01] anybody know who wrote the book of
[32:02] genesis
[32:03] moses right in the beginning god created
[32:06] the heavens and the earth and moses
[32:08] wasn't standing there
[32:09] but the word of the lord comes to the
[32:11] prophet and moses begins to write down
[32:13] by vision what happened in the very
[32:15] beginning the word of the lord comes to
[32:17] the prophet
[32:17] now we come to the new testament and the
[32:19] bible says in the book of john in the
[32:21] beginning was the word the word was with
[32:23] god and the word was goss the word
[32:25] the word there is logos it's the
[32:27] concepts of god it was god himself
[32:30] but god wanted to be with the people so
[32:32] he was god above the people in the old
[32:34] testament
[32:34] little theology here so father son and
[32:36] holy spirit in the old testament he was
[32:38] the father above the people
[32:40] and the new testament he was the son
[32:42] that god took on flesh and he was the
[32:44] son
[32:44] then he said i must i i come from god i
[32:46] go back to god and he went back up to
[32:48] god
[32:49] you remember um was it saint paul when
[32:51] he was going to the road to damascus and
[32:52] a light strikes him down
[32:54] and he struck down and he looks up and
[32:56] he said who are you lord and what'd the
[32:57] voice say
[32:59] i am jesus there was jesus in that law
[33:02] ghost that
[33:03] pillar of fire that was with moses back
[33:05] there now it's
[33:06] jesus had to send it back up to that
[33:08] lagos so we see here in verse 14 first
[33:11] john chapter
[33:12] 1 saint john 1 verse 14 and the bible
[33:16] says and the word was made flesh
[33:18] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[33:21] glory the glory as of the only begotten
[33:24] father full of grace and truth i was
[33:27] reading this verse and it really struck
[33:28] out to me because it said it was the
[33:30] only begotten
[33:31] of the father there was only one
[33:33] virgin-born person that was jesus christ
[33:36] what was it john 3 16 we were reading
[33:38] that this morning or quoting it
[33:40] for god so loved the world that he gave
[33:41] his only begotten son that whosoever
[33:44] believeth in him should not perish but
[33:46] have everlasting life
[33:47] so there again in that verse it says he
[33:49] was the only begotten son he was only
[33:51] the
[33:52] the only virgin born son is that what
[33:54] your bible says
[33:55] this don't let this be too deep this is
[33:57] just the scripture we're reading here
[33:59] now adam was the only created son god
[34:01] created
[34:02] adam out of the dust of the earth but i
[34:04] thought about this verse it struck
[34:06] it struck me this afternoon as i was
[34:07] studying it and so the bible says he
[34:09] became flesh
[34:10] and he was full of grace and truth
[34:15] full of grace and full of truth i think
[34:18] we read that this morning pilate said
[34:19] what is
[34:20] truth in another place the bible says
[34:22] that the word of god
[34:23] is the truth he said my word is the
[34:26] truth god's word is the truth but i like
[34:28] the other part here it says he's full of
[34:30] grace
[34:31] full of grace oh jesus christ is full of
[34:34] grace tonight
[34:36] what is grace it's the unmerited favor
[34:39] of god
[34:40] the unmerited favor of god you know
[34:44] sometimes in the bible like john
[34:48] the disciple he was called the disciple
[34:50] of love
[34:51] so saint john and then first john and
[34:53] his whole book is about
[34:54] love and so he we call him john the
[34:56] beloved he was the
[34:58] but there's others people friends that i
[35:02] know that they're like the
[35:03] personification of grace
[35:05] so god has this attribute that he wants
[35:07] to be graceful he wants to show
[35:09] unmerited favor to somebody so sometimes
[35:12] god will just reach out into the world
[35:14] maybe somebody's not even a christian
[35:16] does it doesn't come from a christian
[35:17] family and god will just pick them up
[35:20] and pick them up and say you're one of
[35:21] mine
[35:23] and god that's what the bible says here
[35:25] he became flesh and he was full of grace
[35:28] full of unmerited favor with god
[35:32] i was thinking about saint paul and it's
[35:34] i got a whole sermon i'd like to preach
[35:36] on that but if you go through paul he
[35:37] wrote most of the new testament
[35:39] moses wrote the old man what is it
[35:42] genesis x
[35:43] leviticus and numbers in deuteronomy
[35:44] moses wrote those most of the old
[35:46] testament the others are the prophets
[35:48] most of the new testament was written by
[35:50] saint paul
[35:51] if you go back and look at this at the
[35:53] gospels of saint paul most of his
[35:55] writings be
[35:56] begin with grace be unto you grace be
[35:59] unto you you go through it we
[36:01] ephesians go through corinthians go
[36:03] through galatians grace be unto you
[36:05] grace be unto you
[36:06] and he closes almost every one of his
[36:08] letters out with
[36:09] the grace of our lord jesus christ be
[36:11] with you
[36:13] i'm so glad to be associated with the
[36:15] bible that's full of grace and truth
[36:18] that the messenger to the first church
[36:20] age messenger he said
[36:21] grace be unto you oh i wish we'd get a
[36:23] revelation like saint paul had
[36:25] when we meet somebody we say grace be
[36:27] unto you david
[36:28] amen when we leave one and say god's
[36:30] grace be with you god's grace be
[36:32] god's unmerited favor go with you
[36:36] i was reading there in colossians
[36:37] chapter 4
[36:39] verse 6 i don't know if i put that one
[36:41] in there brothers i can't remember
[36:42] if i did or not but colossians verse 4
[36:46] chapter 4 verse 6. you know this is the
[36:49] god is somewhat of a chef
[36:50] you know when he multiplied the bread he
[36:53] didn't multiply
[36:54] just raw bread and make some flour and
[36:57] said you all work on this
[36:58] no he he created it remember he
[37:00] multiplied five loaves of two fishes he
[37:02] made
[37:03] cooked bread and he multiplied it and
[37:05] then he fed another one he fed 4 000 so
[37:07] he is somewhat of a chef
[37:11] people got their cooking shows i
[37:12] originally just get back in their bible
[37:14] and read their bible
[37:16] but i was thinking about this how this
[37:18] verse stood out to me a little bit
[37:20] paul was talking about he said let your
[37:22] speech be always with grace
[37:25] seasoned with salt the other day my wife
[37:29] and i were eating
[37:30] and she just reached over and got the
[37:32] salt and just shook it on everything i'm
[37:34] like
[37:35] how do you know that even needs salt it
[37:37] needs salt
[37:39] need salt but paul is saying here when
[37:42] you talk
[37:43] let it always be with grace
[37:46] how do they say they talk about this
[37:48] high fructose
[37:50] corn syrup or whatever it is and they're
[37:52] talking about
[37:53] it's a ingredient you go into the
[37:55] grocery store and it's in ketchup and i
[37:57] don't know
[37:58] all that stuff but high fructose cone
[37:59] stuff most of the drinks have
[38:01] and you know they put that stuff in
[38:03] there and but i was thinking about this
[38:06] paul is saying let your speech be always
[38:08] with grace
[38:11] sometimes we have our speech with
[38:12] legalism and we like
[38:15] this god said and god said and god said
[38:18] and that's true but there also is a
[38:20] place of grace
[38:22] and paul says let your speech be with
[38:24] grace seasoned with salt
[38:27] put a little salt in there as i said
[38:29] that's the way to make people's taste
[38:30] buds come up you just make it salty and
[38:32] you
[38:33] put the chips and salt and you put salsa
[38:35] and you put salt on it makes people
[38:37] thirsty
[38:38] as i said we said it the other day you
[38:40] can lead a horse to water but you can't
[38:42] make that horse drink
[38:44] you're just like ain't drinking but you
[38:45] can put enough salt in its oats
[38:48] and when it's eaten out he's like yeah
[38:49] i'm thirsty i'm thirsty
[38:51] and that's what we as christians ought
[38:53] to be so full of the lord and full of
[38:55] the love of god and the inspiration of
[38:57] god i mean
[38:58] people get around us say i don't know
[38:59] what you're all about but i want what
[39:01] you have
[39:03] i mean that would do us all good as
[39:05] christians to lay aside anything we all
[39:07] you know how they say troubles all of us
[39:09] have troubles
[39:11] but we sang the song this morning i cast
[39:13] all my cares upon the lord jesus
[39:15] jesus said that he said come unto me all
[39:17] ye that are weary
[39:18] and heavy laden and i'll give you rest
[39:21] amen you know the world is a very
[39:23] complex world there's a lot of
[39:25] uncertainty and everything that people
[39:26] thought were certain amen we had a
[39:28] pandemic come by and now
[39:30] a lot of that is uncertain people's jobs
[39:32] and their 401ks and
[39:34] and even how you go to church or how you
[39:36] go to the store or
[39:37] you know it's all uncertainty and so it
[39:39] creates a lot of anxiety a lot of mental
[39:41] problems brother jordan was talking
[39:43] about some
[39:43] people that he knew going through mental
[39:45] things but jesus said come unto me
[39:47] all ye that are weary and heavy laden
[39:50] and i'll give you rest
[39:51] and i don't know about you but i'm weary
[39:53] of this whole pandemic thing i'm just
[39:55] done with it and i just bring it to
[39:58] jesus say lord you know all about this
[40:00] father
[40:00] lord you know all about it we're just
[40:02] trying to do the best that we can
[40:03] you know when it comes down to it you
[40:05] know all of us were born one day and
[40:07] every one of us are going to die one day
[40:09] brother daniel don't talk about that in
[40:11] church well i'm sorry
[40:12] we come to the church to find out the
[40:14] word of god and the truth and the bible
[40:16] says it is appointed unto man once to
[40:18] die
[40:19] so we all start here at zero over here
[40:22] and then we start through life and we're
[40:24] all coming through life and every one of
[40:26] us if you're breathing you're somewhere
[40:28] in this course of life and the bible
[40:29] says
[40:29] three score and ten god allotted which
[40:32] is 70 years and by reason of strength if
[40:34] you have really good genes you make it
[40:36] to 80
[40:36] and after that they're just bonus years
[40:38] they're just like god is just giving you
[40:39] these
[40:40] bonus years all the way out there but i
[40:43] don't think anybody's lived to be 200
[40:44] years old so
[40:45] there again the scripture is true it's
[40:47] appointed unto man once to die
[40:50] so that's an appointment that every one
[40:51] of us had and we come to this earth to
[40:54] make a decision for jesus christ
[40:57] that's why you were born into the world
[40:58] that you might have an opportunity
[41:00] to be a christian how was it was it we
[41:03] read there in saint john
[41:05] john 3 16 he said for god sent not his
[41:08] son into the world to condemn the world
[41:10] but that the world through him might be
[41:13] saved
[41:14] remember the disciples one day they were
[41:16] they went out and they come back to
[41:17] jesus said jesus
[41:19] there were some people over there that
[41:20] were casting out devils in your name but
[41:22] they didn't follow us
[41:24] they didn't come to our church and we
[41:26] should we call fire down out of heaven
[41:28] and jesus said oh my goodness he said
[41:31] the son of man came not to destroy life
[41:33] but to give life
[41:36] and so that's what jesus said here in
[41:37] john 3 16 we all know 16 but 17 says he
[41:41] he sent not his son into the world to
[41:42] condemn the world but that the world
[41:44] through him
[41:44] might be saved i believe it says in
[41:46] another place it's not god's will that
[41:48] any should perish
[41:50] amen the the hell was not created for
[41:53] god's children
[41:54] the bible says that the hell was created
[41:55] for the devil and his angels
[41:57] they weren't created for god's children
[41:59] god doesn't want anybody to go to hell
[42:01] and he's made a propitiation
[42:03] through the cross of jesus christ that
[42:05] we could not go to a devil's hell
[42:08] and that's why verse 18 saint john 3 18
[42:11] says
[42:12] he that believeth on him is not
[42:14] condemned that he that believeth not is
[42:16] condemned already because he hath not
[42:18] believed in the name of the only
[42:20] begotten son of god
[42:22] and he said this is the condemnation
[42:26] now we'll read these verses and one day
[42:27] these verses will come back to us i
[42:30] trust
[42:30] when god brings you life that we all
[42:32] accept life
[42:34] if you don't accept life then one day it
[42:35] comes back to you
[42:38] and so this is the next verse so this is
[42:40] the condemnation
[42:41] that light has come into the world and
[42:44] men love
[42:44] darkness rather than light because their
[42:47] deeds were evil
[42:49] everyone that doeth evil hateth the
[42:51] light neither cometh to the light lest
[42:53] this deed should be reproved
[42:55] i think we talked about that a couple
[42:56] weeks ago remember in psalms
[42:58] the first chapter the ungodly and the
[43:00] center will not stand in the
[43:01] congregation of the righteous this is
[43:03] the
[43:03] this is what it says right here everyone
[43:05] that doeth evil hateth the light
[43:07] neither cometh to the light lest his
[43:09] deeds should be reproved lest they
[43:11] would be made manifest but he that doeth
[43:14] truth cometh to the light
[43:15] that his the deeds may be made manifest
[43:17] that they are
[43:18] wrought in god so i was thinking about
[43:21] that how that our
[43:22] our conversation should always be with
[43:25] grace seasoned with salt
[43:27] amen may god help us to always have that
[43:30] attribute about us and maybe we've not
[43:32] done the right thing in the past i've
[43:34] made mistakes
[43:35] is there any perfect people here any
[43:37] perfect people
[43:39] okay good it's good we're all in the
[43:41] same boat there's no perfect
[43:43] people as we said the last perfect man
[43:46] we hung him on a cross
[43:48] and that was jesus christ so the bible
[43:50] says all have sinned and come
[43:52] short of the glory of god we've all made
[43:55] mistakes i
[43:56] believe it says in isaiah that all we
[43:58] like sheep have gone astray we've turned
[44:00] everyone our own way and then the bible
[44:02] says and the lord hath laid on him jesus
[44:04] christ the iniquity of us all
[44:07] so i'm so glad one day that i found the
[44:09] lord jesus
[44:10] i was just a sinner boy doing the wrong
[44:13] thing
[44:14] raised in a christian home i was sitting
[44:16] about where brother dan was we were at a
[44:17] camp meeting
[44:19] and i said lord it was the lord was just
[44:21] dealing with me you know because god
[44:23] deals with a person he never calls a
[44:25] person the judgment
[44:27] without first warning that person look
[44:29] there's there the end is coming
[44:31] you need to check your life the end is
[44:33] coming and it might be tonight we never
[44:35] know when we're going to have our last
[44:36] service
[44:37] we don't know when we'll ever have our
[44:39] last opportunity so that's why
[44:40] christians are the most secure people
[44:43] that know they don't gamble they don't
[44:44] take
[44:45] chances they want to be secure they
[44:47] realize they have something that's more
[44:49] precious than gold which is their soul
[44:52] so they don't gamble with it we come we
[44:53] realize i'm born into this world
[44:55] to make a decision for jesus christ and
[44:58] i was thinking about this because
[45:00] god the spirit of god wanted to manifest
[45:02] himself so he created a body that he
[45:05] might
[45:05] live in it he might die and go to you
[45:08] know die
[45:09] for your sins and my sins and then he
[45:11] ascended up on high
[45:12] but he had attributes inside of him and
[45:15] that was you and me
[45:17] just like i one time was a young man and
[45:19] we got married at
[45:20] 19 years old and we were 20 we had our
[45:22] little boy isaac
[45:24] and there was attributes i had an
[45:26] attribute to be a father and those were
[45:28] expressed
[45:29] and god had an attribute to be a father
[45:31] as well
[45:33] he wanted to be a father of daughters of
[45:35] god and sons of god
[45:37] i was thinking about this in saint john
[45:39] the first chapter
[45:41] verse number 11 the bible says he which
[45:45] is this one jesus christ came into his
[45:47] own and his own received him not
[45:50] saint john 1 11 but as many as received
[45:54] him to them gave he power to become
[45:56] sons of god even to them that believe on
[46:00] his name which were born not of blood
[46:02] nor
[46:02] the will of the flesh nor of the will of
[46:04] man but of god
[46:06] so the bible says as many as received
[46:08] him
[46:09] to them gave he power to be a son of god
[46:13] he said brother 10 i could never be a
[46:15] son of god i could
[46:16] never be like brother jordan standing
[46:19] here with sister martha and the
[46:20] two little children singing there and i
[46:22] don't know where if kenneth was up there
[46:24] hiding behind the piano but
[46:26] see their family say i could never but
[46:28] the bible says as many as received him
[46:30] to them gave he power
[46:31] to be a son of god to be a daughter of
[46:34] god
[46:35] so you say brother daniel i can't do it
[46:36] you're right we can't do it but the
[46:38] bible says if we receive him
[46:40] jesus christ he'll give you power to be
[46:42] a son of god is that what your bible
[46:44] says
[46:44] i'm so glad that our faith does not rest
[46:47] in what brother daniel says it rests in
[46:48] the word of god
[46:50] and brother daniel is just here as a
[46:51] signpost pointing you to the word of god
[46:53] to say
[46:54] go back and read the scripture it
[46:55] doesn't matter what the devil brings
[46:57] against your mind the bible says as many
[46:58] as received him
[46:59] to them gave he power to be sons and
[47:02] daughters of god
[47:03] it's just like the burden the new birth
[47:04] it's a it's a mystery of god and
[47:06] maybe this morning we're preaching it's
[47:08] like oh my brother daniel i don't
[47:09] you know i know that god's changed my
[47:11] nature but let me just you say
[47:12] i know brother daniel i'm not a pig i
[47:14] once had a pig nature i'd go live in a
[47:16] pig and you can clean a pig up and take
[47:17] him to church and give him to sunday
[47:19] school make him learn verses but that
[47:20] doesn't change his nature he's still a
[47:21] pig
[47:22] you turn him loose and he goes right
[47:23] back to the lust of the flesh and the
[47:25] pride and
[47:26] and envy and strife and pornography and
[47:28] he just sees a pig
[47:30] he just needs to be born again amen so
[47:32] we come in and we're washed by the water
[47:34] the word and god begins to clean us
[47:36] and we're born not only of the water but
[47:38] also of the spirit of god convicts us
[47:40] and you say brother daniel i know god
[47:42] has done something supernatural in my
[47:43] life
[47:44] but that doesn't mean when you walk
[47:45] through the walmart or the barnyard that
[47:47] you don't get mud on you
[47:50] how do you know what i'm talking about
[47:52] and they said no you
[47:53] you're i didn't make you mean you're a
[47:54] pig again it just means you need to go
[47:56] to church and get the washing of the
[47:58] water the word
[47:59] and clean all that off of us and spray
[48:01] that little lamb down and get all that
[48:04] manure off of him and because we go
[48:06] through those things they attack our
[48:07] mind
[48:09] you know how's the one man said you
[48:10] can't control your thoughts
[48:12] like oh no i can control my thoughts all
[48:14] right don't think
[48:16] of a pink hippopotamus ah you already
[48:19] did
[48:21] so i have the ability to put thoughts
[48:23] into your mind i have
[48:24] the the your ears and your eyes are a
[48:27] gateway to the soul and so they come in
[48:29] but you have the ability to let it go
[48:31] from your head down to your heart
[48:33] so i could say oh there's no christians
[48:36] and then you would say
[48:37] i hear that and you put a thought in my
[48:39] mind but i don't believe it because i am
[48:41] a christian
[48:43] so i can and that's what the world is
[48:44] they put all these thoughts oh there's
[48:46] no true christians
[48:47] god doesn't love me but the bible says
[48:50] don't let that go from your head down to
[48:51] your heart say no i'm going to reject
[48:53] that it's called a thinking man's filter
[48:55] and you have the word of god you say
[48:56] okay i got a filter on here do you
[48:58] we just stop right here you know why you
[49:00] have filters like air filters
[49:02] because it's protecting something
[49:04] precious
[49:05] some of us may work in hvac or something
[49:07] like that and you have a
[49:08] a fan motor and you have coils and you
[49:11] say look we can't let all that
[49:13] contamination into this precious thing
[49:15] so we put a filter in there and god has
[49:18] a filter for every one of our souls and
[49:20] it's the word of god
[49:22] and if we would just put that i could
[49:23] put that somewhere so it doesn't get
[49:25] from our head down to our heart we have
[49:27] a filter a thinking man's filter it's
[49:29] the word of god
[49:31] and whenever something comes in you say
[49:32] oh you can't be forgiven or that
[49:35] now if you let that drop down in your
[49:36] heart and you start believing it the
[49:38] bible says as the man thinketh in his
[49:39] heart so is he
[49:41] so pretty soon the devil says look you
[49:43] can't be saved you did wrong
[49:45] and you can't be saved and that comes to
[49:47] your head now if you start believing
[49:48] that as a man thinks in his heart so is
[49:50] he's like you're right
[49:52] i can't be saved there's no way i can be
[49:54] saved and you are
[49:55] what you think as a man thinks in his
[49:57] heart that's what he is and pretty soon
[49:59] you think
[49:59] there's no hope how many friends have i
[50:02] seen that maybe even made a start for
[50:03] christ
[50:04] and then they maybe make a mistake and
[50:06] the devil says see if you're a christian
[50:08] if you're a child of god you'd have
[50:09] never done that
[50:10] and then they start believing that
[50:11] there's no hope
[50:14] and so when it drops down in the heart
[50:16] then they become that as a man thinks in
[50:18] his heart
[50:18] so is he not his mind but as the bible
[50:21] says as he thinks in his heart because
[50:23] any
[50:23] buddy i can tell you hey you're a
[50:24] millionaire and you're like i don't
[50:26] believe that
[50:27] you know but if you believe it let it
[50:30] drop in your heart you could become that
[50:31] and as you think in your heart
[50:33] so so are you and so i say that because
[50:35] so many people they believe there's no
[50:36] hope i can't there's
[50:37] i can't i'll never be saved i've gone
[50:40] too far i've done too many bad things
[50:42] you don't have to raise your hand but i
[50:44] bet the devil's come to you and told you
[50:45] that
[50:47] he has me said look you've gone too far
[50:49] there's no hope for you
[50:51] but the bible says
[50:54] the thinking men's filter said no man
[50:56] can come except the father draws him
[51:00] you can't come to god unless god draws
[51:02] you
[51:03] and if god is drawing you tonight to him
[51:06] that means there's still hope for you
[51:08] god's not an indian giver he doesn't
[51:10] play like
[51:11] hey you need your drowning hey here's a
[51:12] life raft and then he pulls it like ah
[51:15] you drown ha ha god doesn't do that we
[51:18] just read it's not his desire that any
[51:20] should perish
[51:21] so how's the bible says the son of man
[51:23] came to seek and to save that which was
[51:25] lost so when the devil says look you've
[51:26] gone too far
[51:27] then you need to take the thinking man's
[51:29] filter the bible says if we confess our
[51:31] sins he's faithful and just to forgive
[51:33] us of our sins
[51:34] that's what the thinking men's filter
[51:35] and you don't let it go from your head
[51:37] down to your heart you
[51:38] push that thing out and you take the
[51:40] filter and you clean the filter say stop
[51:42] all the contaminants from going down and
[51:44] into my soul
[51:46] there's a scripture that says what would
[51:47] a man give in exchange for his soul it's
[51:50] very precious
[51:52] you have something that's very precious
[51:53] every one of you i guess you drove her
[51:54] in a car whether it's a great car or not
[51:56] a great car
[51:57] especially in arizona you have a air
[51:59] filter
[52:00] and maybe you go get your oil change
[52:01] like hey do you want to change your
[52:02] filter
[52:03] and sometimes they rip people off they
[52:06] tried to do that to me the other day i'm
[52:07] like
[52:08] no i can it doesn't need that i know
[52:10] what a bad filter looks like and
[52:12] so you have something precious and
[52:13] that's your soul and you shouldn't let
[52:15] contaminants come into that
[52:18] you shouldn't let just thoughts come
[52:19] into that you should protect that
[52:21] and that's what the word of god is you
[52:23] come to the house of god and god has a
[52:25] filter that filters all the bads keeps
[52:27] the bad stuff out and lets only the good
[52:29] things
[52:29] in god loves me god cares about me
[52:33] he has a plan for my life he's watched
[52:36] out for me every day of my life
[52:37] it's not his will that i perish we just
[52:39] read it john 3 16 17 and 18.
[52:42] oh isn't that good doesn't that just
[52:45] kind of lift you up when the devil tries
[52:46] to push you down
[52:50] amen and the bible says as many as
[52:53] received him to them gave he power to be
[52:55] sons of god
[52:57] we read it this morning and i won't read
[52:58] it again but jesus said i have
[53:00] you've not chosen me but i've chose you
[53:02] and ordained you that you go and bring
[53:03] forth fruit
[53:04] it should bring you so much happiness
[53:06] when the world maybe hates christians
[53:08] jesus said if the world hates me it'll
[53:10] hate you also
[53:11] but jesus said i chose you hattie god
[53:13] chose you
[53:16] and ordained you that you would go and
[53:17] bring forth fruit
[53:19] brother rome god chose you that we would
[53:22] go and we would bring forth fruit as
[53:24] christians matt god chose you
[53:26] that you'd be a christian you'd use his
[53:28] talents to sing and play and
[53:30] use whatever we can remember arnold van
[53:32] winkler and it tells the whole story
[53:34] about they were in switzerland they were
[53:35] being captured and
[53:36] and they were coming against their
[53:38] country and they were being defeated and
[53:40] he looked they were just plows men and
[53:41] he looked at him he said today i give my
[53:43] life for switzerland i said what do you
[53:45] do
[53:45] he said today we go and we give our life
[53:48] for our country he said
[53:50] get your plow get your shovel and follow
[53:52] me and fight with everything that you've
[53:53] got
[53:54] we're living in a day when the devil is
[53:56] coming against our mind we're fighting
[53:57] the greatest battle ever fought it's
[53:59] fought in your mind
[54:00] i say get whatever you've got and let's
[54:02] fight the devil
[54:03] let's stand shoulder to shoulder our
[54:05] enemy is not your enemy is not sitting
[54:07] on the pew with you
[54:08] they're not sitting across the aisle
[54:10] amen these are our brothers and sisters
[54:12] now the devil will come to you and say
[54:13] no
[54:14] that's this ruler she's just my enemy
[54:16] and every time you drive up in church
[54:17] you're thinking about that situation
[54:19] that happened five years ago
[54:20] that's the devil just throw that thing
[54:22] away say that's my sister that's my
[54:24] brother it's the devil would try to
[54:25] divide us
[54:27] god's chosen us that we might bring
[54:28] forth fruit i was thinking about this a
[54:31] great man said
[54:32] brother random said i must not go around
[54:34] daily with my head hanging down as if
[54:36] something
[54:37] was terrible when i look at the world
[54:39] and see all the darkness
[54:40] and all they're carrying on i just raise
[54:42] my head and walk with my head among the
[54:45] eagles knowing this
[54:46] that i know him in the power of
[54:48] resurrection because he lived we live
[54:50] also
[54:51] because he raised up from the dead i
[54:52] shall raise also
[54:54] amen ye shall raise also i believe that
[54:56] jesus said because i live you can live
[54:58] also
[54:59] i'm so glad that i'm alive today as a
[55:02] christian i've had a new birth i've had
[55:03] a change of heart can you say amen to
[55:05] that
[55:06] and you wouldn't you know it's just not
[55:07] you're not called into a new
[55:09] reformation you read a book and i become
[55:12] a better person no
[55:13] god changed my life he changed my
[55:16] desires
[55:16] does that mean i'm perfect no but
[55:18] there's no more desire there's no more
[55:20] conscience of sin
[55:22] we make mistakes say lord forgive me of
[55:23] my sins and we get up and we move on as
[55:25] a christian
[55:26] amen we were talking about that where
[55:28] were you talking about friday night
[55:29] we're talking about the
[55:30] little fellowship we're talking about
[55:32] how many time a child falls down when
[55:34] it's learning to walk
[55:35] that child just said like i think i'm
[55:37] going to walk and it stands up just walk
[55:39] no it gets up and it falls down it gets
[55:41] up and it falls down
[55:42] it gets and sometimes as christians we
[55:44] we aren't perfect anthony
[55:46] when we get baptized we take on the name
[55:48] of jesus christ we don't me we're not
[55:50] going to be perfect people we're going
[55:51] to make mistakes
[55:52] but the blood of jesus christ cleanses
[55:54] us from all of our sins can you say amen
[55:56] to that
[55:57] aren't you thankful for a father that
[55:58] doesn't expect you to get up and walk
[56:00] perfectly he knows you're going to make
[56:02] a mistake
[56:02] and 2 000 years ago he died on calvary
[56:05] for your iniquities and for your
[56:06] transgressions
[56:07] i got to make you love your father oh
[56:10] blessed be the name of the lord
[56:12] some of us made mistakes and the devil
[56:13] said look you fell down and there's no
[56:15] hope for you
[56:16] that's not what my father said he said i
[56:18] already paid for your transgressions i
[56:20] already paid for your iniquities
[56:22] oh blessed be the name of jesus makes
[56:25] you love him
[56:26] not out of the law when you got somebody
[56:28] who loves you like that you just
[56:30] it's not a do's and don'ts it's lord i
[56:32] love you we sing the song i love him
[56:33] because he first loved me
[56:36] not when we're sitting in church and we
[56:38] got our ties and our brother david
[56:40] sitting on the front row
[56:41] thank you for coming up closer to the
[56:42] front getting warmer and wrong
[56:56] are we talking about john was it last
[56:58] week we were talking about john he got
[57:00] away
[57:00] he got him in prison you ever been in a
[57:02] prison in your mind
[57:04] all of us get in prison circumstances
[57:06] and were taken captive and they said
[57:08] go ask jesus and if he's the one or we
[57:11] look for another that was his whole
[57:12] commission in life to be the forerunner
[57:14] and he said go ask
[57:15] if i've made a mistake with my whole
[57:17] life oh
[57:18] blessed be the name of jesus sometimes
[57:20] we get in that some
[57:22] same place that's when you come to the
[57:24] church of god and maybe the sisters
[57:26] start playing a little song
[57:27] brother matt comes out and and starts
[57:29] leading a little song
[57:30] you begin to feel that presence of the
[57:32] lord begin to speak to you again
[57:34] i'm here to tell you god has a voice god
[57:37] is a spirit
[57:38] and he speaks to us and you can hear now
[57:41] i have a voice but
[57:42] it's not so important that you hear my
[57:43] phonetic as the scientists hear the
[57:46] sound waves that follow
[57:47] come from my vocal cords to the anvil
[57:49] and the stirrup on your ear that's one
[57:50] kind of sound but there's another sound
[57:52] when the voice of god speaks
[57:54] to your heart and you know that god is
[57:57] warming your heart something is moving
[58:00] down deep inside of you
[58:02] how's the bible say let us lay aside the
[58:05] sin and the weights that so easily beset
[58:07] us
[58:08] and let's run with patience this race
[58:10] that's set before us
[58:12] looking to the author and the finish of
[58:14] our faith
[58:16] all right what time did we start gotta
[58:18] watch that clock back there
[58:21] amen i'll skip over a few notes i was
[58:24] thinking of this
[58:25] mark chapter eight matthew mark
[58:29] luke and john i was talking to anthony
[58:32] the other day and he said i don't know a
[58:34] whole lot about the bible we got him
[58:36] a new little bible but that's okay my
[58:39] little boy didn't know anything about
[58:40] this big world when he came into the
[58:42] world but
[58:42] he's got a father that teaches him amen
[58:46] when you're born of god you have a
[58:47] father it's a tutor
[58:49] jesus said i'll never leave you and i'll
[58:51] never forsake you i'm going to be with
[58:52] you all the time
[58:53] i'm going to walk beside you i'm going
[58:54] to hold your hand he's not a physical
[58:56] thing that you see right now we know
[58:58] he's gone up to heaven but he's a spirit
[58:59] god is a spirit
[59:01] so when you get close to something you
[59:02] get close to it the holy spirit will
[59:03] speak to you and say don't do that
[59:06] and you just keep walking and maybe you
[59:07] do it in the holy spirit how does it say
[59:09] in ephesians
[59:11] 4 30 grieve not the holy spirit
[59:14] whereby you're sealed unto the day of
[59:16] your redemption how many's ever grieved
[59:17] the holy spirit be honest like yeah i've
[59:19] grieved him i've done wrong and then
[59:20] daddy takes you in the back room
[59:22] shuts the door doesn't beat you in child
[59:23] abuse we don't believe in that but he
[59:25] takes and gives you a little spanking
[59:26] like hey
[59:27] you don't do that anymore you don't do
[59:30] that like oh okay daddy i won't and then
[59:32] he wraps his great big arms around you
[59:34] in love
[59:35] you see how jesus said as many as i love
[59:37] i chasten and rebuke
[59:39] but it's not abuse where he beats you
[59:41] down that's what the devil does he
[59:43] condemns you
[59:44] how's the one man said he tempts you to
[59:45] rob the bank and then as soon as you rob
[59:47] the bank he calls and
[59:49] calls the police on you that's where the
[59:51] devil does he tempts you like why don't
[59:52] you do that why don't you do that and
[59:53] then you do it
[59:54] look there's no hope for you you're lost
[59:56] you're not a christian if you're a
[59:57] really christian son of god you'd have
[59:58] never done that
[59:59] like man that's just the devil i
[1:00:01] remember my father
[1:00:03] i had the privilege of being raised in a
[1:00:05] christian home and every day
[1:00:07] i'm a beneficiary of that heritage
[1:00:10] but my dad come to me one time and he
[1:00:11] said do you know the difference between
[1:00:14] condemnation and conviction because the
[1:00:17] devil is full of condemnation
[1:00:19] jesus said the son of man came not in
[1:00:21] the world to condemn the world but that
[1:00:23] the world through him they might be
[1:00:24] saved
[1:00:25] so condemnation is of the devil
[1:00:28] conviction is of god
[1:00:30] so brother daniel how do you know the
[1:00:31] difference between condemnation and
[1:00:33] conviction
[1:00:35] condemnation is there's no more hope for
[1:00:37] you
[1:00:38] you've fallen down you've made a mistake
[1:00:39] you'll never get back up that's
[1:00:41] condemnation that's the devil
[1:00:43] but conviction is the holy spirit saying
[1:00:45] hey you did wrong
[1:00:47] you can't live like that and be my son
[1:00:49] my children don't live like that
[1:00:51] you need to make that right you need to
[1:00:53] repent
[1:00:54] and then you go back and say look maybe
[1:00:56] you've done your fellow brother or
[1:00:58] sister you might say
[1:00:58] brother sister forgive me and if we
[1:01:01] confess our sins jesus christ is
[1:01:03] faithful and just
[1:01:04] to forgive us of our sins and cleanse us
[1:01:06] from all unrighteousness
[1:01:07] those are verses that need to be
[1:01:09] underlined in your bible
[1:01:11] we call them go-to verses you have these
[1:01:14] go-to verses when the devil comes
[1:01:16] remember we called it um saint first
[1:01:18] john
[1:01:19] 1 9. this is the this is a good one for
[1:01:21] you anthony you're going to need this
[1:01:23] one so it's in back in the old
[1:01:25] back by the book of revelation right
[1:01:27] close to the end we teach sunday school
[1:01:29] so we teach this is our go-to verse
[1:01:32] it's our 9-1-1 call and i've told you
[1:01:33] all this a couple weeks ago but
[1:01:36] repetition is the best teacher
[1:01:39] so christians when they get in trouble
[1:01:42] if you're in your house
[1:01:43] and somebody starts beating on the
[1:01:45] window like we're gonna kill everybody
[1:01:46] in the house
[1:01:48] you get your cell phone out and you call
[1:01:49] 9-1-1 right you hope that somebody there
[1:01:52] is going to come i got news for you the
[1:01:54] average time for a police officer to get
[1:01:56] to your house is 10 minutes
[1:01:58] so if you're really waiting on the
[1:01:59] policeman to do that you need to come up
[1:02:01] with plan b
[1:02:02] and probably plan b needs to be your
[1:02:04] plan a
[1:02:06] and not depend because there's only so
[1:02:08] many policemen in the city
[1:02:10] and if a certain number of people come
[1:02:12] in and say hey we're just gonna
[1:02:13] rob all of the people in this city
[1:02:15] there's only so many policemen and
[1:02:16] they're probably not coming to my house
[1:02:18] first
[1:02:20] but that's not the way it is with the
[1:02:21] lord jesus christ because he's got
[1:02:23] someone that watches over you
[1:02:25] and we have first john
[1:02:28] the the chapter 1 verse 9
[1:02:31] and if you do that backwards first john
[1:02:33] 1 9 backwards is 9-1-1
[1:02:37] and so this is the christians 9-1-1 call
[1:02:39] if we confess our sins he is faithful
[1:02:42] and just to forgive us of our sins
[1:02:44] and cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[1:02:48] isn't that a good verse that should be a
[1:02:50] go-to verse for every christian when the
[1:02:52] devil comes to your head and says look
[1:02:54] there is no hope for you
[1:02:55] then you have god's word as a filter
[1:02:57] your 9-1-1 call it doesn't let it go in
[1:02:59] your heart
[1:03:00] it keeps it out says no i don't believe
[1:03:02] that because i know if i start believing
[1:03:04] it in my heart as a man thinketh in his
[1:03:05] heart so is he but i'm not going to let
[1:03:07] that become part of me i'm going to
[1:03:08] throw that let my filter throw that out
[1:03:10] because the bible says if i confess my
[1:03:12] sins he is faithful and just to forgive
[1:03:14] us of our sins and cleanse us from all
[1:03:17] unrighteousness
[1:03:18] now i know this is really really basic
[1:03:20] but sometimes in our christian walk
[1:03:22] it's good to go back to the basics i
[1:03:25] have some friends that were in the
[1:03:26] military
[1:03:27] they were military police like brother
[1:03:28] matt he told me the other day he was
[1:03:29] military police
[1:03:30] so they had a lot of things that
[1:03:32] happened on the barracks but they go
[1:03:34] back to their training
[1:03:35] and they would train you as you go in
[1:03:36] boot camp or whatever it is and i said
[1:03:38] when the bombs are falling and the
[1:03:40] people are shooting and your buddies
[1:03:41] dying and there's blood everywhere and
[1:03:43] you're in the foxhole and they're
[1:03:44] shooting your buddy just died in your
[1:03:45] arms
[1:03:46] you start going back to the basics and
[1:03:48] you start going back to your training
[1:03:51] and there's never been a day that we
[1:03:52] don't see people dying spiritually
[1:03:54] around us and people
[1:03:55] being dismembered they're losing their
[1:03:57] faith in god and their
[1:03:59] walk with god and when all that happens
[1:04:01] and you see it's not the time to just
[1:04:02] commit suicide commit spiritual suicide
[1:04:05] it's the time to go back to your basic
[1:04:07] training
[1:04:08] and these are the basic training that's
[1:04:09] what church is about we call it sunday
[1:04:11] school
[1:04:12] we'll call it yeah sunday school we're
[1:04:13] in the house of the lord we're being
[1:04:15] schooled when the devil comes tomorrow
[1:04:17] and said look you've sent away your day
[1:04:18] of grace you're saying no i'm going to
[1:04:20] go back to the basics my 9-1-1
[1:04:22] is if i confess my sins he's faithful
[1:04:23] and just to forgive us of our sins
[1:04:26] that's just really basic but i love
[1:04:27] let's go to chapter two verse one
[1:04:29] because you can't hardly read the one
[1:04:30] without the other
[1:04:31] and besides all that i have a big arrow
[1:04:32] drawn in my bible to it
[1:04:35] so sometimes as a christian when you're
[1:04:37] in this battle and you go through trials
[1:04:39] and heartaches and pains
[1:04:40] and the scripture will come and set you
[1:04:42] free so sometimes
[1:04:44] you're on this road of life we talked
[1:04:45] about the path of life from
[1:04:47] cradle to the grave we're on this path
[1:04:49] and sometimes you'll
[1:04:51] fall into little pitfalls along the way
[1:04:53] and then the word of god
[1:04:54] is like a chain and your soul hangs over
[1:04:58] hell by
[1:04:58] every verse in this bible and wherever
[1:05:01] you break that chain is where you fall
[1:05:04] you remember eve she was in the garden
[1:05:05] man perfect world perfect atmosphere
[1:05:08] everything was perfect and she just had
[1:05:10] god had one word don't partake of that
[1:05:11] tree and when she broke that
[1:05:13] then her her soul fell
[1:05:17] and so that's why you get in places in
[1:05:19] your life you get in the
[1:05:20] you know get along you all don't have
[1:05:21] snow storms here but i guess you have
[1:05:23] mud
[1:05:24] tsunamis or tsunamis monsoons and so
[1:05:27] you've had people get stuck in the mud
[1:05:29] and you have this chain and you stick it
[1:05:31] down there if you're before
[1:05:32] if your big four wheel drive goes off
[1:05:34] the road it doesn't mean you're not a
[1:05:35] truck right
[1:05:36] doesn't mean you're not a human it just
[1:05:38] means you got off the path
[1:05:40] and some of us get off the path of life
[1:05:43] things happen to us maybe
[1:05:46] maybe we get washed off maybe we said i
[1:05:48] think i can cross that and maybe we get
[1:05:50] washed off the road but that's not the
[1:05:52] end that's why you come to god's house
[1:05:53] and god will have a
[1:05:54] man of god there throw a chain out to
[1:05:56] you throw the word i got out say hey
[1:05:58] just hook this on your soul
[1:05:59] and we'll reel you back in we'll get you
[1:06:02] back on the road and all of us have kind
[1:06:04] of got off the road somewhere in our
[1:06:06] life but that's not the end we just need
[1:06:07] amen the word of god to come to us hook
[1:06:10] onto our soul and pull us back up and
[1:06:12] get us back on the road again
[1:06:15] amen saint mark chapter 34 just a couple
[1:06:18] more verses and then we'll close
[1:06:21] saint mark chapter 34.
[1:06:26] now this message is for somebody
[1:06:30] amen we don't believe that things just
[1:06:31] happen by chance we believe that
[1:06:33] everything
[1:06:34] is ordained by god everything that
[1:06:36] happens in your life
[1:06:37] is just not chance it's all for a reason
[1:06:41] mark chapter 8 verse 34
[1:06:44] and when he had called the people unto
[1:06:45] him with his disciples also he said unto
[1:06:47] them
[1:06:48] who whosoever will come after me let him
[1:06:51] deny himself
[1:06:53] and take up his cross and follow me
[1:06:56] now you all have done that today because
[1:06:58] you all aren't at walmart
[1:07:00] you're not out walking in the mountains
[1:07:01] today looking at the pretty sunset
[1:07:03] seeing god in nature you've denied
[1:07:05] yourself and your own desires
[1:07:07] and you've come to the house of god
[1:07:08] because the bible says forsake not the
[1:07:10] assembling of yourselves together can
[1:07:12] you see yourself in the scripture
[1:07:14] we can see jesus in the scripture but
[1:07:16] can you see you can you see yourself
[1:07:18] fulfilling scripture
[1:07:19] you've denied yourself and take up his
[1:07:21] cross and follow me and whosoever will
[1:07:24] save his life shall lose it
[1:07:26] but whosoever will lose his life for the
[1:07:28] for my sake and the gospel is the same
[1:07:30] shall save it
[1:07:31] for what shall it profit a man if he
[1:07:33] shall gain the whole world
[1:07:35] and lose his own soul so if you would
[1:07:38] gain the whole world
[1:07:40] and lose your soul jesus said what would
[1:07:42] it profit you or what can a man give in
[1:07:43] exchange for a soul that's a great
[1:07:45] question
[1:07:46] what would a man give in exchange for
[1:07:48] his soul
[1:07:49] elvis presley was raised in a
[1:07:50] pentecostal church and
[1:07:52] brother bram said that he learned his
[1:07:54] moves in the pentecostal
[1:07:56] church and he sold his soul for a fleet
[1:07:58] of cadillacs
[1:08:00] i wish i had time to i wanted to do that
[1:08:02] this morning to go through the kingdom
[1:08:04] of the devil and how he tries to merge
[1:08:05] those two kingdoms together
[1:08:07] and a lot of people that start out in
[1:08:08] the kingdom of god and the devil
[1:08:10] perverts them and gets them over on his
[1:08:12] side
[1:08:12] because he he's not original he can only
[1:08:14] pervert what god did
[1:08:15] he can't create a beautiful woman he
[1:08:17] only perverts a beautiful woman that god
[1:08:19] made
[1:08:20] he can't make a man into his image he
[1:08:22] can only take a good man that's made in
[1:08:23] god
[1:08:24] image and then pervert that man how many
[1:08:26] can see that
[1:08:27] and so you see a lot of these singers
[1:08:28] that are out here in the world they
[1:08:29] started in
[1:08:30] in a christian home elvis presley was
[1:08:32] raised in a pentecostal church
[1:08:33] was that lady gaga was a catholic and
[1:08:36] has gone over to
[1:08:37] a different side i think britney spears
[1:08:39] was raised baptist
[1:08:40] uh all of the jacksons i think they were
[1:08:42] baptists trying to think uh katy perry
[1:08:45] both her parents were traveling
[1:08:46] ministers and she put out an album said
[1:08:48] i want to be the next amy grant of
[1:08:50] christian music and
[1:08:51] and it was a total fail and so she told
[1:08:53] you look it up on the unearthed the
[1:08:54] devil she told the devil look if you'll
[1:08:56] make me successful make me popular i'll
[1:08:58] sell my soul to you and she sold her
[1:08:59] soul to the devil
[1:09:00] and you see how the devil can't create
[1:09:02] he only takes these great gifts and
[1:09:04] talents of god and perverts them and
[1:09:06] puts them over on this side
[1:09:07] it's the kingdom of the devil and so the
[1:09:10] jesus asked this question what would you
[1:09:11] give in exchange for your soul
[1:09:14] whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of
[1:09:16] me in my words in this adulterous and
[1:09:18] sinful
[1:09:19] generation of him also so the son of man
[1:09:21] be ashamed
[1:09:22] when he cometh in the glory of his
[1:09:25] father with his holy angels
[1:09:27] may god help us to deny ourselves and
[1:09:29] take up our cross and follow him
[1:09:32] because the devil is right there to get
[1:09:34] you hooked and addicted on every little
[1:09:36] thing of the world
[1:09:37] it's just social media that's the
[1:09:39] craziest things that people get addicted
[1:09:41] to sometimes and
[1:09:42] somebody was telling me the other day
[1:09:43] they just got addicted to some i don't
[1:09:45] know if it's instagram or twitter they
[1:09:47] had some little reel and little funny
[1:09:48] things and they got in that and they got
[1:09:50] was just so hooked and addicted to that
[1:09:51] thing i have to realize they was
[1:09:53] stealing all of the
[1:09:54] their time and and and not getting
[1:09:56] things done of life
[1:09:58] and we see these little addictions of
[1:10:00] the devil that would
[1:10:01] steal our and so you know may god help
[1:10:04] us today the bible says to redeem the
[1:10:06] time
[1:10:08] amen
[1:10:12] just before we close i was thinking this
[1:10:15] noon i wrote the name esther down i was
[1:10:18] thinking about the kingdom of god and
[1:10:19] like the kingdom of
[1:10:21] hazarus his he wanted a wife and so he
[1:10:24] went and sent
[1:10:25] you know the story of esther and sent
[1:10:26] out a
[1:10:29] thing for all the beautiful women to
[1:10:30] come and there was one lady called
[1:10:32] esther
[1:10:33] the bible says she went into the king
[1:10:35] but she took nothing with her
[1:10:37] she didn't need anything because she was
[1:10:39] naturally beautiful
[1:10:41] and you know god is looking for he's
[1:10:43] building a spiritual
[1:10:44] kingdom and he's looking for a bride and
[1:10:47] he doesn't need a lot of stuff attached
[1:10:49] to you he just wants you
[1:10:51] he just wants you he doesn't need
[1:10:52] anything but just you
[1:10:54] just like esther was there he just needs
[1:10:56] you he needs your life
[1:10:58] it doesn't need maybe all the other
[1:10:59] women if you look at the thing of esther
[1:11:01] there maybe they said well hey we got to
[1:11:03] do this like the world and the world
[1:11:04] says i need this and i need this
[1:11:06] but esther didn't need that she just
[1:11:08] need herself to come to the king
[1:11:10] and that's the way we are we just need
[1:11:12] to come to the king jesus christ
[1:11:14] i was thinking of that great call song
[1:11:18] just as i am without one plea but that
[1:11:21] thy blood was shed for me
[1:11:23] and that thou bids me come to thee o
[1:11:25] lamb of god
[1:11:26] i come just as i am
[1:11:30] my friend he had a little saying he said
[1:11:32] i've never caught a fish he's a great
[1:11:33] fisherman
[1:11:34] he said i never caught a fish that i
[1:11:36] didn't have to clean
[1:11:38] never caught a fish it i didn't have to
[1:11:40] clean a lot of bad stuff out before ever
[1:11:42] served it before i ever used it for its
[1:11:44] intended use
[1:11:45] and that's how we way we are like esther
[1:11:48] god
[1:11:48] just needs us he doesn't need all of our
[1:11:51] ideas and all of what we think he just
[1:11:53] wants us to come
[1:11:54] to jesus christ maybe another verse here
[1:11:56] before we close first timothy
[1:11:59] maybe two verses second timothy chapter
[1:12:02] three
[1:12:03] this verse was on my heart this
[1:12:04] afternoon as i was just studying
[1:12:06] second timothy chapter three
[1:12:13] verse number let's go back to ten so
[1:12:16] this is paul
[1:12:17] telling about talking to timothy about
[1:12:19] how the world and the evils of the world
[1:12:21] but in verse 10 he said but thou has
[1:12:23] fully known my doctrine
[1:12:25] so that's the way a minister is people
[1:12:27] should know that know their lives he
[1:12:28] said you've known my doctrine
[1:12:30] you know my manner of life you know my
[1:12:32] purpose you know my faith you know my
[1:12:34] long suffering
[1:12:35] you know my charity you know my patience
[1:12:37] the bible says you should know them that
[1:12:39] labor among you should know their life
[1:12:41] no and so paul goes on to say he said
[1:12:44] persecutions and afflictions which came
[1:12:46] unto me at antioch and iconium and
[1:12:49] lystria and so paul is saying look you
[1:12:50] know me
[1:12:51] you know i went to this city and there
[1:12:53] was i believe one place they stoned him
[1:12:55] another place they
[1:12:56] they they let him over the side of the
[1:12:57] wall and another place
[1:12:59] my wife and i are going through the book
[1:13:00] of acts and how he suffered great
[1:13:02] persecutions and afflictions
[1:13:04] and he said what persecutions i endure
[1:13:06] but out of them all the lord delivers me
[1:13:08] yea
[1:13:08] and all can you say all all
[1:13:13] that will live godly in christ jesus are
[1:13:15] going to suffer persecution
[1:13:18] so if you think you're going to give
[1:13:19] your heart to god you're just going to
[1:13:20] coast through life
[1:13:21] you got in the wrong wrong club this
[1:13:24] isn't the club for you
[1:13:25] but you're going to suffer persecution
[1:13:29] and he said but evil men and seducers
[1:13:31] shall wax worse and worse this is a
[1:13:33] prophecy
[1:13:33] the world's not going to get better the
[1:13:35] bible's prophesied they're going to get
[1:13:37] worse and worse the internet's not going
[1:13:39] to get cleaned up
[1:13:40] and all be a pure holy uh internet
[1:13:43] virtual highway because that's what the
[1:13:45] internet is it's just a road
[1:13:47] and there's a lot of junk along the road
[1:13:49] and there's some good things along the
[1:13:50] road we're streaming the service out to
[1:13:51] different people may god bless our
[1:13:53] our our audience that's streaming but
[1:13:55] the bible says that men are going to gra
[1:13:57] wax worse and worse deceiving him being
[1:13:59] deceived
[1:14:00] but continue thou he's talking to
[1:14:02] timothy but continue thou in the things
[1:14:04] which thou has learned
[1:14:05] and has been assured of knowing of whom
[1:14:07] now has learned them
[1:14:08] and that from a child so even when
[1:14:11] you're
[1:14:11] young timothy even from a child thou
[1:14:14] hast
[1:14:15] known the holy scriptures makes me think
[1:14:18] of brother yarborough again
[1:14:19] even as a child you've known the holy
[1:14:21] scriptures and what are these scriptures
[1:14:23] going to do
[1:14:24] which are able to make thee wise unto
[1:14:26] salvation
[1:14:28] salvation comes from the scriptures as
[1:14:31] we were talking before
[1:14:32] you know somebody could say hey if you
[1:14:34] beat your head on this organ you can be
[1:14:35] saved
[1:14:38] i can't hardly believe that no because
[1:14:42] your faith doesn't rest in the shifting
[1:14:44] sands of man's theology at rest in the
[1:14:46] word of god
[1:14:48] and that's what paul is telling timothy
[1:14:49] right here you'll know the scriptures
[1:14:51] which are able to make thee wise unto
[1:14:53] salvation
[1:14:54] through faith which is in christ jesus
[1:14:57] so today we're going to baptize anthony
[1:14:59] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:15:02] there's many churches that baptize in
[1:15:04] the titles of father son and holy spirit
[1:15:06] but if you go back and study in the book
[1:15:08] of acts there's no place in the bible
[1:15:09] that
[1:15:10] anyone was ever baptized in the titles
[1:15:12] of father son and holy spirit
[1:15:14] so that's why the bible paul is telling
[1:15:16] timothy even as a young child you've
[1:15:17] known the scriptures which are able to
[1:15:19] save thee
[1:15:20] so we're saved by our knowledge and
[1:15:22] adherence to the word of god
[1:15:24] verse 16 all scripture is given by
[1:15:26] inspiration of god
[1:15:28] and is profitable for doctrine for
[1:15:30] reproof for correction for instruction
[1:15:32] and righteousness
[1:15:33] that the man of god may be perfect
[1:15:37] thoroughly furnished unto all good works
[1:15:40] that's why you hear brother daniel talk
[1:15:42] so much about the scriptures
[1:15:43] because they're able to save us matthew
[1:15:46] chapter six
[1:15:47] this is maybe the last one before we
[1:15:50] turn to our baptismal service matthew
[1:15:52] chapter 6.
[1:15:55] very simple
[1:16:00] you know somebody said the other day say
[1:16:01] i don't even know how to pray
[1:16:04] and i was thinking about that because i
[1:16:06] think it's luke 11 the disciples came to
[1:16:09] jesus and they said
[1:16:10] teach us to pray they didn't know how to
[1:16:12] pray
[1:16:13] and i was thinking about the little boy
[1:16:15] that went to church he was just a young
[1:16:16] boy and he went to church and he'd come
[1:16:18] up to the altar and he just said a
[1:16:20] b c d
[1:16:24] e f g and they
[1:16:27] asked the boy said boy you've been
[1:16:28] coming to church why do you go to the
[1:16:30] altar and you say your abcs
[1:16:32] he said well i never had a dad and mom
[1:16:35] to teach me the ways of god
[1:16:37] so i don't know how to pray but i just
[1:16:40] say my abcs
[1:16:42] and jesus will take all the letters and
[1:16:44] he'll put them together and make the
[1:16:45] right words
[1:16:46] and he knows my heart sometimes it's
[1:16:49] good for us just to go back and say our
[1:16:51] abc's
[1:16:53] to god and just say lord this is how i
[1:16:55] feel
[1:16:56] because prayer is not telling god
[1:16:58] something it's talking to god just like
[1:17:01] we would talk this and we would talk and
[1:17:03] say hey how you feeling today well i
[1:17:04] don't feel very good i feel alone or i
[1:17:06] feel
[1:17:07] lonely that's the same way you pray i
[1:17:09] pray a lot just driving down the road in
[1:17:11] my car or get up early and
[1:17:13] kneel and say lord i don't know what to
[1:17:14] do about this i was praying this morning
[1:17:16] i woke up
[1:17:17] really early and i was just got down and
[1:17:19] pray and said lord i don't know how to
[1:17:20] do
[1:17:21] i just kept praying and praying and
[1:17:23] directly the holy spirit said well this
[1:17:24] is how you do it like this and i just
[1:17:26] was there and i just wrote it down and
[1:17:29] that's what that's what i need to do to
[1:17:30] fix that
[1:17:31] sometimes we don't wait enough in prayer
[1:17:34] we need to spend time in prayer
[1:17:36] sometimes we make decisions we do things
[1:17:38] quick
[1:17:38] and we got cell phones so many times
[1:17:40] people text us and we real quick and
[1:17:41] they'll text
[1:17:42] right back and that's not the time to
[1:17:44] just how my dad's told me this too he
[1:17:46] said just because it can be done
[1:17:48] doesn't mean it should be done just
[1:17:51] because you can text that back
[1:17:53] doesn't mean you should text that back
[1:17:55] sometimes it's good to just wait a
[1:17:57] little bit and pray
[1:17:58] spend a little time in prayer and so
[1:18:00] they came here in matthew chapter six
[1:18:03] the gospel of luke tells the story and
[1:18:05] they had come to him and said teach us
[1:18:06] to pray and he goes through a different
[1:18:08] version but we call this the lord's
[1:18:09] prayer in
[1:18:10] matthew chapter 6 verse 9 after this
[1:18:13] manner therefore pray ye
[1:18:15] our father which art in heaven
[1:18:18] you know the very first word in the
[1:18:21] lord's prayer is
[1:18:22] our it takes the me out of this
[1:18:26] it's just me no it's our father it's
[1:18:29] we're us
[1:18:29] together there's somebody with you in
[1:18:32] this we're not fighting this battle
[1:18:33] alone
[1:18:34] it's our father which art in heaven
[1:18:37] hallowed be thy
[1:18:38] name what is the name of our father
[1:18:40] jesus christ
[1:18:42] amen let everything house the bible say
[1:18:44] whatsoever you do in word
[1:18:45] everything you do indeed do it all in
[1:18:48] the name of jesus
[1:18:50] and if you can't do it in the name of
[1:18:51] jesus you probably shouldn't be doing it
[1:18:54] so i have the right to go down to the
[1:18:55] alcohol store and go in there and buy me
[1:18:57] a
[1:18:58] a big old bottle of bourbon because
[1:19:01] bourbon country's back in kentucky if
[1:19:03] you go through and fly into louisville
[1:19:04] the whole thing is bourbon man bourbon
[1:19:05] this and bourbon that how their
[1:19:07] governor said 95 of the bourbon original
[1:19:09] is
[1:19:10] made in in in kentucky and all the rest
[1:19:13] is imported five percent and that's
[1:19:14] their big thing is
[1:19:15] bourbon and alcohol and i have the right
[1:19:17] to go do that
[1:19:18] but i can't do it in the name of jesus
[1:19:20] christ
[1:19:21] the bible says shun the very appearance
[1:19:23] of evil so if i walk in
[1:19:25] and i've got a big brown paper bag and
[1:19:27] it's all wrapped up in there and i say
[1:19:28] just a coke just a coke
[1:19:30] like but you're shunning daniel shutting
[1:19:32] the very appearance of evil
[1:19:36] hallowed be the name of jesus christ
[1:19:39] we're going to baptize our
[1:19:41] brother in the name of jesus christ the
[1:19:43] bible says the whole family in heaven is
[1:19:45] named jesus
[1:19:47] amen you're baptized in and it's amazing
[1:19:50] and you go to other churches and they'll
[1:19:51] do everything
[1:19:52] in the name i'll do this in jesus jesus
[1:19:54] name but they refuse to be baptized in
[1:19:56] the name of jesus christ
[1:19:58] isn't that amazing he goes on to say thy
[1:20:01] kingdom come
[1:20:02] thy will be done is that your desire
[1:20:05] lord let your kingdom come
[1:20:07] lord let the spiritual we know there's
[1:20:09] two kingdoms one is a spiritual kingdom
[1:20:11] that's inside of you we know in
[1:20:12] revelation chapter 21 john saw
[1:20:14] i saw a great city the new jerusalem
[1:20:16] coming down there's going to be
[1:20:17] a physical kingdom but right now there's
[1:20:19] a spiritual kingdom
[1:20:20] and jesus said this is how you should
[1:20:22] pray lord let your kingdom come
[1:20:24] let it come inside of me let christ be
[1:20:26] the ruler of my life
[1:20:28] and this this next part of verse 10 is
[1:20:30] so amazing if you
[1:20:32] if you this this will help you so much
[1:20:34] in your life jesus said this is the way
[1:20:35] you pray
[1:20:36] thy will be done in earth as it's done
[1:20:40] in heaven
[1:20:41] sometimes we want to say lord i want
[1:20:43] this to happen i want this to happen i
[1:20:45] want this to happen
[1:20:46] rather than wait god taught us to pray
[1:20:48] let thy will be done on
[1:20:50] earth as it's done in heaven so the main
[1:20:53] thing is say
[1:20:53] lord what is your will in heaven lord
[1:20:56] what is your will that's where as a lot
[1:20:58] of times
[1:20:59] critical or just most of us if we had
[1:21:01] our way and we'd date
[1:21:02] like christianity like a one like
[1:21:04] trouble's gone
[1:21:06] my sickness is gone this problem's gone
[1:21:08] and this problem and my neighbor's gone
[1:21:10] and my kids are gone and
[1:21:15] but jesus said pray let thy world be as
[1:21:18] thy will is done in heaven
[1:21:20] so let it be done on the earth maybe
[1:21:22] god's got a little thorn in the flesh to
[1:21:24] make you humble
[1:21:25] remember paul said i sought the lord
[1:21:27] thrice and he come and told me he said
[1:21:29] my grace is sufficient for you that
[1:21:31] little handicap that you have
[1:21:33] is there for a reason paul to keep you
[1:21:34] humble
[1:21:36] it goes on to say give us this day our
[1:21:38] daily bread and forgive us our debts as
[1:21:41] we forgive our debtors
[1:21:42] and lead us not into temptation but
[1:21:44] deliver us from evil
[1:21:46] for thine is the kingdom and the power
[1:21:48] and the glory forever
[1:21:50] amen and most people stop the lord's
[1:21:53] prayer there but the next two verses are
[1:21:54] so powerful it's hard
[1:21:56] to just say amen there without reading
[1:21:58] the next verses
[1:22:00] for if you forgive men their trespasses
[1:22:02] your heavenly father will also forgive
[1:22:03] you oh that's so wonderful
[1:22:05] if i forgive my brothers then god will
[1:22:07] forgive me our trespasses and a lot of
[1:22:09] us say amen
[1:22:10] right there but that's there's another
[1:22:11] verse that comes after that one
[1:22:13] he goes on to say but if he forgive not
[1:22:15] men their trespasses
[1:22:17] neither will your father forgive you
[1:22:19] your trespasses
[1:22:21] so i got news for you none of us are
[1:22:23] going to go to heaven with sin in our
[1:22:25] lives
[1:22:26] and so if we don't forgive our brother
[1:22:28] or his trespasses then our father won't
[1:22:30] forgive us
[1:22:30] our trespasses so you can't go to heaven
[1:22:33] if you're not forgiving your brother or
[1:22:34] sister
[1:22:36] and sometimes there's bitterness and
[1:22:38] hatred and sometimes we go through
[1:22:39] things in our life
[1:22:40] and we don't forgive people and it just
[1:22:43] really
[1:22:44] how do they say bitterness
[1:22:48] only contaminates the vessel that holds
[1:22:50] it
[1:22:51] you might have the most beautiful bowl
[1:22:53] say this is just lined this is a copper
[1:22:55] bowl and it's so beautiful
[1:22:57] but then you put the acids of hatred and
[1:23:00] bitterness and malice and unforgiveness
[1:23:03] it doesn't hurt the bitterness it's just
[1:23:04] in the bowl but it starts corrupting its
[1:23:07] acids it starts corrupting and
[1:23:08] etching that nice bowl and each one of
[1:23:11] us are made in the image of god
[1:23:13] it says in the book of acts that we come
[1:23:14] to church and there's times of
[1:23:15] refreshing god refreshes us
[1:23:17] he makes us over anew says there be not
[1:23:20] conformed to this world we be
[1:23:21] transformed and we're transformed into a
[1:23:22] new creature
[1:23:23] and then sometimes these bitter acids
[1:23:26] come in and try to
[1:23:27] to taint our personalities and our
[1:23:30] our spirits and we get bitter
[1:23:33] i say it's time to just say lord forgive
[1:23:35] us lord forget
[1:23:37] and lord let me forgive my brother even
[1:23:39] if it's for a selfish reason lord i
[1:23:40] don't want my vessel to be contamin
[1:23:42] contaminated and my spirit to be
[1:23:44] contaminated so lord i'm going to
[1:23:45] forgive my dad
[1:23:46] i'm going to forgive my mom i'm going to
[1:23:48] forgive my brother forgive my sister
[1:23:50] forgive my neighbor
[1:23:51] so that god you will forgive me blessed
[1:23:54] be the name of the lord
[1:23:55] amen if the musicians comes let's just
[1:23:57] bow our heads i'm just going to close
[1:23:58] right there
[1:24:01] heavenly father you know this little
[1:24:02] thought that we've had tonight
[1:24:05] we've spoke many words about an hour
[1:24:08] father
[1:24:09] and i know one day lord that we'll meet
[1:24:11] these words back they'll come back to us
[1:24:15] and i pray lord in your presence that
[1:24:16] you would help each one of us father
[1:24:19] i pray that you would forgive us of our
[1:24:20] sins and shortcomings lord i've tried to
[1:24:22] show from your scripture
[1:24:24] that you do desire to forgive us you
[1:24:27] came into the world to die for sinners
[1:24:29] lord
[1:24:30] we make mistakes and you died on the
[1:24:32] cross for our sins
[1:24:34] and i pray that you would forgive us
[1:24:35] today lord and you'd help us everyone
[1:24:37] under the sound of my voice
[1:24:39] and while every head's bowed and every
[1:24:41] eyes closed i wonder if god's speaking
[1:24:43] you to you today and you've got sin in
[1:24:45] your life and you just
[1:24:46] not to me but you just like to raise
[1:24:48] your hand to jesus christ and say
[1:24:50] lord jesus forgive me god bless you god
[1:24:53] bless you
[1:24:53] god bless you god bless you yes god
[1:24:56] bless you don't be ashamed jesus said if
[1:24:58] you're ashamed of me i'll be ashamed of
[1:24:59] you
[1:25:00] god bless you god bless you god bless
[1:25:02] you my look at the honest hands god
[1:25:04] bless you
[1:25:05] now we've read the scripture if we
[1:25:07] confess our sins he's faithful and just
[1:25:09] to forgive us of our sins
[1:25:10] you don't have to confess it to me the
[1:25:12] bible says there's one mediator between
[1:25:14] god and man and that's the man christ
[1:25:16] jesus
[1:25:17] so you just confess it to him now say
[1:25:19] lord forgive me of this lord jesus i
[1:25:21] i made a mistake god bless you lord i
[1:25:24] thought this lord i've held this grudge
[1:25:26] against this person lord but i
[1:25:27] i want you to forgive me today lord we
[1:25:30] don't come under emotion we come just
[1:25:32] with the word of god lord forgive me i'm
[1:25:34] confessing my sins and
[1:25:36] maybe you've never been baptized in the
[1:25:38] name of jesus christ the bible says
[1:25:40] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:25:42] be saved
[1:25:43] amen say lord i want to be saved lord
[1:25:45] i'm going to confess my sins i want to
[1:25:47] go into water baptism
[1:25:49] this evening amen maybe there's somebody
[1:25:51] else that just wants to draw closer to
[1:25:52] the lord and you'd like to raise your
[1:25:54] hand
[1:25:54] to the lord god bless you yes god bless
[1:25:57] you god bless you
[1:25:58] god sees the hands yes amen the bible
[1:26:01] says no man can come except the father
[1:26:03] draws him and god's drawing you to him
[1:26:05] the bible says draw nigh unto god and he
[1:26:07] will draw an i unto you resist the devil
[1:26:10] and he will flee from you heavenly
[1:26:12] father you see the hands that have been
[1:26:14] raised
[1:26:15] lord their hands have hung down most of
[1:26:17] the service gravity
[1:26:18] holds their hands down but when the word
[1:26:21] of god
[1:26:22] was gone forth lord something inside of
[1:26:24] them responding and say
[1:26:26] i want my sins to be forgiven and it
[1:26:28] responded to the word of god and they
[1:26:30] raised their hand and said lord jesus
[1:26:32] forgive me
[1:26:33] even now they're confessing their faults
[1:26:35] and their sins to you
[1:26:37] lord i believe you're the son of god
[1:26:38] that came into the world to die for my
[1:26:40] sins
[1:26:41] lord forgive me today lord you promised
[1:26:44] in your word that thou art sends me a
[1:26:46] scarlet they'd be white as snow
[1:26:48] i pray lord you take these confessions
[1:26:50] these prayers that are being
[1:26:51] lifted up to you and you'd forgive us of
[1:26:53] our sins and trespasses lord we want to
[1:26:55] thank you for your word lord

[1:26:59] that we might know the path

[1:27:12] i am persuaded that he's able to keep
[1:27:14] those things that i committed unto him

[1:27:17] commit our hearts to you today we commit
[1:27:19] our sins to you and

[1:28:25] of the lord
[1:28:29] there's joy in the presence
[1:28:33] of joy in the presence
[1:28:37] of joy in the presence
[1:28:41] of the lord
[1:28:45] there's joy in the presence
[1:28:48] of joy in the presence
[1:28:53] there's joy in the presence
[1:28:56] of the lord can we sing there's
[1:28:58] forgiveness in the presence
[1:29:00] there's forgiveness in the presence
[1:29:08] forgiveness in the presence
[1:29:12] of the lord
[1:29:17] forgiveness in the presence
[1:29:21] given this in the presence
[1:29:25] if it's in the presence
[1:29:28] of the lord i'm changed in his presence
[1:29:31] i'm changed in his presence
[1:29:35] i'm changing the presence
[1:29:39] i'm changed in the presence
[1:29:43] of the lord
[1:29:47] i'm changed in his presence
[1:29:51] i'm changed in his presence
[1:29:55] i'm changed in the presence
[1:29:58] of the lord
[1:29:59] [Music]
[1:30:01] amen there's something about the
[1:30:03] presence of the lord that changes every
[1:30:04] situation
[1:30:06] amen we're going to change the order of
[1:30:08] the service and just read some verses
[1:30:10] here about water baptism
[1:30:12] we're going to baptize brother anthony
[1:30:14] in just a moment i'm going to read these
[1:30:15] out of corinthians
[1:30:16] i'm sorry romans chapter 6. just a few
[1:30:19] verses that talk about the
[1:30:22] what we believe we do don't believe that
[1:30:24] water saves you
[1:30:25] we believe that water this that we're
[1:30:28] doing is an outward sign of something
[1:30:30] that's happened on the inside
[1:30:32] so the other night anthony and i were
[1:30:34] sitting on the bench the other day and
[1:30:36] we were just talking about jesus christ
[1:30:38] john 3 16 jesus christ came into the
[1:30:41] world to die for sinners
[1:30:43] amen if we would confess our sins he's
[1:30:45] faithful and just to forgive us of our
[1:30:47] sins we're going to baptize him in a
[1:30:49] minute he believes that jesus christ is
[1:30:50] the son of god that came into the world
[1:30:52] to take
[1:30:52] anthony's sins we take our sins and by
[1:30:55] faith we place them on jesus christ
[1:30:58] and that saves us we're saved by faith
[1:31:00] in jesus christ but the bible goes on to
[1:31:02] say he that believeth and is baptized
[1:31:04] shall be saved it's not just believing
[1:31:06] and a lot of people go to the thief on
[1:31:08] the cross say well i don't have to be
[1:31:09] baptized because the thief died
[1:31:11] and and he didn't get baptized but you
[1:31:13] must remember that there was no
[1:31:14] commandment to be baptized
[1:31:16] it wasn't until after jesus rose from
[1:31:18] the dead he told them
[1:31:20] to go into all the world baptizing in
[1:31:22] the name of the father
[1:31:23] the the name of the father son and holy
[1:31:25] spirit which is the lord jesus christ so
[1:31:26] there was no commandment prior to that
[1:31:28] how many understand that and that'll
[1:31:30] take away that thought well i don't have
[1:31:31] to get baptized because after jesus rose
[1:31:33] he gave them the commandment
[1:31:34] you've got to be baptized so we find in
[1:31:38] romans chapter 6 i just want to read
[1:31:40] some
[1:31:40] verses here just take a minute again
[1:31:43] what we do
[1:31:44] comes from the scripture what shall we
[1:31:47] say then shall we continue in sin that
[1:31:49] grace shall abound god forbid how shall
[1:31:51] we
[1:31:52] that are dead to sin live any longer
[1:31:53] therein know ye not that so many of
[1:31:56] us as were baptized into jesus christ
[1:31:59] were baptized into his death
[1:32:02] so the same as jesus lived and he died
[1:32:04] and was buried and then he rose again he
[1:32:06] received a glorified body
[1:32:08] we believe that we're all born in sin
[1:32:10] we're sinners
[1:32:11] we confess our sins to jesus christ and
[1:32:14] as an outward sign of what has happened
[1:32:16] on the inside we're going to take
[1:32:18] we're going to bury brother anthony in
[1:32:20] the water and we're going to go down
[1:32:21] into a water of grave
[1:32:23] and when he comes up he's going to raise
[1:32:25] in a newness of life as a new anthony
[1:32:27] he goes on to say verse 4 therefore we
[1:32:30] are buried with him
[1:32:31] by baptism into death that like as
[1:32:33] christ was raised up from the dead by
[1:32:35] the glory of the father even so
[1:32:37] we also should walk in newness of life
[1:32:39] verse number five
[1:32:41] for if we have been planted together in
[1:32:43] the likeness of his death
[1:32:44] we shall be also in the likeness of his
[1:32:46] resurrection i'd like to preach that
[1:32:48] right behind wednesday's service
[1:32:50] about the righteous man is planted by
[1:32:52] the rivers of water
[1:32:53] and that's what's happening here we're
[1:32:54] getting ready to plant him according to
[1:32:56] the scripture we're going to bury him
[1:32:58] and plant him under the water
[1:33:00] that he might rise in newness of life
[1:33:02] and from this day forward he'll always
[1:33:04] remember the day that he was baptized
[1:33:06] how many of you remember the day you
[1:33:07] were baptized yes i remember the day
[1:33:09] that i went down i got baptized and was
[1:33:11] planted
[1:33:12] according to the scripture and i laid my
[1:33:14] life down and i raised in a newness of
[1:33:16] life
[1:33:17] verse number six knowing this that our
[1:33:19] old man is crucified with him and that
[1:33:21] the body
[1:33:22] of sin might be destroyed that
[1:33:24] henceforth we should not serve
[1:33:26] sin for he that is dead is freed from
[1:33:28] sin
[1:33:30] now if we be dead with christ we believe
[1:33:32] that we shall also be
[1:33:33] live with him knowing that christ being
[1:33:36] raised from the dead
[1:33:37] diet to no more death hath no more
[1:33:40] dominion over him
[1:33:41] for in that he died he died unto sin
[1:33:43] once
[1:33:44] but in that he liveth he liveth unto god
[1:33:47] that's hard to stop there and not read
[1:33:48] the next three verses likewise reckon ye
[1:33:51] also yourselves to be undead indeed unto
[1:33:53] sin but alive unto god through
[1:33:56] jesus christ our lord let not sin
[1:33:59] therefore reign in your mortal body that
[1:34:01] ye should obey it
[1:34:03] in the lust thereof neither yield
[1:34:05] yourselves members as
[1:34:06] instruments of unrighteousness and
[1:34:08] descent but yield yourselves unto god as
[1:34:10] those that are alive from the dead
[1:34:12] and your members as instruments of
[1:34:14] righteousness and to god so when we
[1:34:17] raise the newness
[1:34:18] of life we say lord here's my life as an
[1:34:20] instrument we've got a
[1:34:21] little instrument or sister's plan there
[1:34:24] or a
[1:34:25] might have a guitar it's an instrument
[1:34:27] to be used for righteousness
[1:34:29] and each one of us we die and we're
[1:34:30] planted we raise again as an
[1:34:32] instrument that god we want god to use
[1:34:35] us as an instrument of righteousness
[1:34:37] amen so we're at this time let's just
[1:34:39] have a word of prayer and then we'll
[1:34:40] take brother anthony up and we'll change
[1:34:42] our clothes and we'll be baptized
[1:34:44] heavenly father we just lord pray to you
[1:34:47] you told us to pray without ceasing and
[1:34:49] we're just praying lord as we come to
[1:34:50] this time of the service
[1:34:52] that this young man anthony is 18 years
[1:34:54] old has made a decision to follow you
[1:34:57] lord to follow your word and to be
[1:34:59] baptized
[1:35:00] we pray lord as your scripture says go
[1:35:02] ye into all the world

[1:35:06] son and holy spirit which is the lord
[1:35:07] jesus christ
[1:35:09] lord we're praying as we do this as an
[1:35:11] outward sign of an inward work we pray
[1:35:13] that you would do a work in anthony's
[1:35:14] life lord may the holy spirit come to
[1:35:16] him
[1:35:17] may it lead him and guide him may it
[1:35:18] fill his life lord to overflow him make
[1:35:20] him a witness
[1:35:21] make him a testimony lord for you and
[1:35:24] we'll know lord that something has
[1:35:25] happened because you said by their
[1:35:27] fruits

[1:42:13] he said the christ thing you got to do
[1:42:14] is repent of your sins
[1:42:16] all of us are born with their own nature
[1:42:18] so you've got to repent of your sins
[1:42:20] and then be baptized in the name of
[1:42:22] jesus christ
[1:42:24] for the remission for the washing away
[1:42:26] of your sins
[1:42:27] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:42:28] holy ghost yes
[1:42:30] brother anthony and i anthony and i were
[1:42:32] on the bench the other night talking
[1:42:33] about the gospels what the gospel
[1:42:35] is
[1:42:38] so many people make so many things with
[1:42:40] it but it's not taking away
[1:42:42] wafer going to a priest and saying your
[1:42:45] sins to the priest
[1:42:46] there's one mediator between god and man
[1:42:49] and that's the man
[1:42:50] christ jesus amen and so each one of us
[1:42:52] is an individual we go to jesus christ
[1:42:55] him as the son of god
[1:42:56] and then place our sins upon him and
[1:42:58] then be baptized for the remission of
[1:43:00] our sin
[1:43:01] then we have a promise that the holy
[1:43:02] spirit will come and live in our lives
[1:43:05] so many people do they they get baptized
[1:43:07] but they never go on to receive the
[1:43:09] power
[1:43:10] of god in their life their lives cause
[1:43:12] them to live in overcoming life
[1:43:14] man we believe we're going to baptize
[1:43:15] anthony and the holy spirit will just
[1:43:17] overshadow it and fill his life and make
[1:43:19] him a witness

[1:43:33] grandparents will see such a change in
[1:43:35] his life since he accepted jesus christ

[1:43:43] bow our heads to you lord with great joy
[1:43:45] in my heart
[1:43:46] stand with this young man that desires
