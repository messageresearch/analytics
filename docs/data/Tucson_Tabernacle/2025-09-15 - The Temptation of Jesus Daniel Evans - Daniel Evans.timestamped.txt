[17:05] [Music]
[17:07] Good morning.
[17:09] &gt;&gt; It is so good to be with you. It is so
[17:14] good to be in the house of the Lord. You
[17:16] know, the Lord inhabits his house. Not
[17:19] this building, but each one of you, each
[17:23] one of us. That's the temple of the
[17:25] Lord. That's the house of the Lord.
[17:28] That's where God lives. In old times,
[17:30] they built a temple literally as a house
[17:32] of God. And that's where we get that
[17:34] term house of God. But God dwells in the
[17:38] hearts of men. He dwells in living
[17:41] tabernacles of flesh. And as we come
[17:43] together, each one bringing that portion
[17:45] of the spirit of God that we have,
[17:47] coming together, coming together in
[17:49] unity, coming together in love, coming
[17:51] together to worship. Yes, sir.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; To worship. One heart, one mind, one
[17:56] accord. setting aside differences,
[17:58] setting aside opinions, setting aside
[18:02] stuff so that we can focus on the one
[18:05] who created all the stuff which is the
[18:07] Lord Jesus. I'm just so happy to be
[18:11] home. Heather and I have been gone for
[18:13] five weeks.
[18:15] And for five weeks and and a day, so for
[18:20] 36 days, we missed your fellowship. For
[18:23] 36 days, we missed your presence. For 36
[18:25] days, we were unable to gather together
[18:28] with you. We were with family. We had a
[18:30] wonderful time. The Lord was with us.
[18:32] His hand was there. It was it was a
[18:35] wonderful time. But we missed you and
[18:38] we're so so glad to be back. And we have
[18:43] a couple of prayer requests here and
[18:45] couple of others. A sister Erica Morales
[18:48] says that tomorrow she's going to court
[18:50] to file for joint custody with the
[18:53] father of her daughter. She prays that
[18:55] all goes well. Let's join with our
[18:57] sister that all will go well, that
[18:58] she'll be able to to to have time with
[19:01] her daughter to see how God's worked in
[19:02] our life. Um, it's been a year since the
[19:06] quarter approved her to to see her. And
[19:09] by coming here, uh, she says it was just
[19:11] it was just a dream. It was just a year
[19:13] ago that she started coming. She was
[19:15] baptized and she's with us and we're
[19:18] just so glad and we're we're with our
[19:21] sister as she faces this court time to
[19:24] to show the change in her life to her
[19:27] daughter and to the court and to ever
[19:30] how that works out that I'm I'm not a
[19:32] lawyer. We have a a request here from
[19:35] Sister Corey Brady. Many of you may not
[19:38] know her. Sister Cordy came down from
[19:40] Canada roughly 1971 or two. She was just
[19:44] a teenager then. She married Frank Brady
[19:47] and uh and been uh here in the Tucson
[19:50] area for many many years now. Please
[19:53] pray for my grandson, David Bowman. He
[19:56] spent last year fighting colon cancer.
[19:59] He spent his 19th birthday in the
[20:02] hospital. He's now at Banner Hospital
[20:04] with stage four cancer. The doctors are
[20:06] hoping the blockage will move on its own
[20:08] without surgery. Surgery be dangerous
[20:10] due to the present cancer. He'll start
[20:12] on chemo as soon as possible. Please
[20:14] pray for him. And she says her
[20:17] testimony, her witness. There's nothing
[20:19] too hard for our Lord.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; I also want to bring a couple of uh
[20:25] notes that this reminded me. I I have a
[20:27] niece uh that also uh has been diagnosed
[20:31] with cancer and is starting a pretty
[20:32] aggressive uh treatment regimen starting
[20:36] in a couple of weeks. and a
[20:38] daughter-in-law uh who also has just
[20:40] been diagnosed with cancer and they're
[20:42] starting to figure out what they might
[20:44] want to do in that case. But we know
[20:46] that our Lord is able cancer just cells
[20:49] that are gone crazy. They're just
[20:51] multiplying and and doing bad things and
[20:53] it's self-destructive because if the
[20:55] cancer kills the host, the cancer dies,
[20:57] too. So, we know that that's not
[20:59] something that the Lord says, but it's
[21:01] something that the Lord can use. So we
[21:03] just pray that the Lord through whatever
[21:06] path that that these people are going
[21:08] through that he gets glory and that we
[21:10] see his hand at work. Let's just join
[21:13] our hearts together now if we would.
[21:16] Lord Jesus, again, it's just such a
[21:18] relief and such an honor and such a
[21:20] privilege and such a praise in our
[21:22] heart. Lord, we just want to worship
[21:23] you. We're so grateful, Lord, not just
[21:26] for what you do, but for who you are.
[21:29] Lord, we just pray that that presence,
[21:32] Lord, of who you are would just dwell
[21:34] within us and flow out from us, Lord.
[21:38] Lord, that others can see not us, but
[21:41] see you. Others can be drawn, Lord, not
[21:43] to us, but to you, Lord. And others can
[21:46] see the hand of you working in their
[21:49] lives, Lord. Meet these needs, Lord.
[21:51] these medical conditions that have been
[21:53] brought our bodies, these these very
[21:55] temples, Lord, that you choose to
[21:57] inhabit as your as your house, Lord. And
[22:00] Lord, we just are again so grateful that
[22:02] we can be joined together here and now
[22:04] as the offering is about to be taken,
[22:06] Lord. We we pray, we know and we trust,
[22:08] but we pray, Lord, that it would be used
[22:10] for the purposes that you intend and
[22:12] that you desire, Lord, in order to bring
[22:14] honor and glory to you. And Lord Jesus,
[22:17] we just again want to say thank you and
[22:20] thank you and thank you again in Jesus
[22:22] precious name. Amen. God bless you all.
[22:32] You may be seated.

[32:38] louder than the unbelief.
[32:45] I'll raise a hallelu.
[32:48] [Music]
[32:53] My weapon is a melody.
[32:57] [Music]
[33:00] I'll raise a hallelujah.
[33:06] [Music]
[33:08] And heaven comes to fight for me.
[33:15] And I'm going to sing
[33:19] in the middle of the storm.
[33:23] Louder and louder
[33:26] you're going to hear my praises roar.
[33:30] And up from the ashes
[33:34] hope will arise.
[33:37] And death is defeated.
[33:40] The king is alive.
[33:47] I'll raise a hallelujah
[33:54] with everything inside of me.
[34:01] I'll raise a hallelujah
[34:08] and I will watch the darkness sweet.
[34:15] I'll raise a hallelu
[34:18] [Music]
[34:22] in the middle of the mystery.
[34:29] I'll raise a hallelujah
[34:36] in fear. You lost your hold on me.
[34:41] [Music]
[34:43] And I'm going to sing
[34:46] in the middle of the storm.
[34:49] And louder and louder.
[34:52] You got to hear my praises roar. And up
[34:57] from the ashes,
[35:00] hope will arise
[35:03] and death is defeated.
[35:06] The king is alive.
[35:10] [Music]
[35:13] I'll raise a hallelujah
[35:16] [Music]
[35:20] in the presence of my enemies.
[35:27] I'll raise a hallelu
[35:32] [Music]
[35:36] unbelie.
[35:39] [Music]
[35:41] I'll raise a hallelu.
[35:46] [Music]
[35:48] My weapon is a melody.
[35:55] I'll raise a hallelu
[35:59] [Music]
[36:02] and heaven comes to fight for me.
[36:08] And I'm going to sing
[36:11] in the middle of the storm.
[36:15] Louder and louder. You're going to hear
[36:19] my praises roar. And up from the ashes,
[36:25] hope will arise
[36:28] &gt;&gt; and death is defeated.
[36:32] The king is alive.
[36:37] Yes, he is.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:40] [Applause]
[36:41] [Music]
[36:46] &gt;&gt; I stand here as a witness and I know
[36:48] many of you do too, that he is alive.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; He is alive and he is at the right hand
[36:53] of the majesty on high. And you know
[36:55] what else? He lives right inside of me.
[36:59] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Our father, we are
[37:01] grateful,
[37:03] Lord, that we can pray to a king that is
[37:07] alive.
[37:09] Father, we pray that you would come down
[37:11] and go through the audience today.
[37:16] May every person that came here
[37:17] searching for something, Lord, may they
[37:19] receive what they are searching for.
[37:22] Father, most of all, would you be
[37:24] pleased with our gathering,
[37:28] with our worship, and what is being
[37:30] said, we pray. We love you, Lord. In
[37:33] Jesus name, a name above all names we
[37:37] pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. You can be
[37:40] seated. God bless you. Thank you.

[37:47] good. It's good to see

[39:08] that I don't recognize or that uh that I
[39:11] didn't recognize here, welcome. We
[39:13] appreciate our visitors.
[39:15] Um, somebody special to me is here is
[39:19] young man that I witnessed to one day
[39:22] out in front of the the church here and
[39:25] I mentioned him a couple times a long
[39:26] time ago and he just had a had a good
[39:30] spirit. There was there was two of them
[39:31] out there and I I went up and and I uh
[39:35] started talking about the Lord and one
[39:36] of them
[39:38] started listening to me very very
[39:40] closely.
[39:42] when I was talking about Johnny, I don't
[39:44] remember what the subject was, but I I
[39:48] felt a presence and I felt a pull that
[39:51] there was something about this young man
[39:54] that was special. And he came to church
[39:57] a little while and he left and he
[40:00] contacted me a couple days ago and he
[40:03] said, "Hey, pastor, it's Johnny Walker."
[40:06] He he said, "You remember me?" "Of
[40:08] course I do." And he said, "I believe
[40:11] that
[40:13] the Lord has uh Let me read. Let me I
[40:17] hope it's okay because I'm going to do
[40:18] it.
[40:20] Never done that before."
[40:28] He said this.
[40:31] He said, "When I was loitering outside
[40:33] the church, we met." He says, 'I'm back
[40:36] in Tucson and I've quickly come to terms
[40:38] with my faith. What time is the sermon
[40:40] on Sunday?
[40:42] And then he says, 'I know it's late.'
[40:44] And and we texted back and forth. He
[40:45] says, 'I know it's late. Just got home
[40:47] from work. And he says, I'm very
[40:50] interested in being baptized. Is that
[40:52] something that I should seek out from
[40:54] the Tucson Tabernacle? And I said,
[40:56] "Most, most certainly,
[41:03] John. Johnny, raise your hand back
[41:04] there. We haven't seen you in a while.
[41:05] Raise your hand, Johnny. God bless you.
[41:08] It's good to have you in service.
[41:15] Erica, I heard that that prayer request
[41:17] that you put in. Another one. Erica told
[41:19] me right here. She told me that one day
[41:22] she was destitute that there was there
[41:26] was really no hope in life. And I
[41:28] believe you're homeless. You didn't have
[41:30] a place to go. and and she was standing
[41:32] out in front of at the bus stop out here
[41:34] in front of the church and something
[41:36] told her that one day that she would be
[41:38] a part of this congregation and here she
[41:41] is. Welcome Eric. God bless you.
[41:50] I'm honored friends. We're gonna I I
[41:52] sent out a a WhatsApp notification that
[41:54] we're going to rededicate the church.
[41:55] It's been 60 years since brother
[41:58] Brandham and brother Green dedicated
[42:00] this church and we are we're honored
[42:04] that uh we're going to be able to done
[42:06] our renovations soon. We'll be done. I
[42:08] appreciate the patience with the
[42:10] construction that's going to be done
[42:11] soon and uh the days are November 21st,
[42:14] 22nd, 23rd.
[42:16] brother um a friend of mine Steve
[42:18] Brouson from Quebec will be ministering
[42:22] on Saturday and I'm looking forward to
[42:25] hearing him. He's a wonderful minister
[42:28] and this is going to be an evangelical
[42:30] theme like our Tucson Tabernacle is
[42:33] because of the people that are sitting
[42:35] in the chairs right now and the gifts
[42:38] that you all have and the gifts that you
[42:41] have proh projected to the outside and
[42:44] bringing people into church. We're going
[42:46] to continue on with that. I believe that
[42:48] is our role as a church is to reach out
[42:52] to those that may not have a church,
[42:53] that may not have a community, and bring
[42:55] those people in, get them to come in.
[42:58] And uh that's going to be the theme. And
[43:00] and friends, I see that as being the
[43:03] theme as long as I'm standing in this
[43:04] pulpit.
[43:06] Zyra, I like his shirt. Says, "Start
[43:09] with Jesus."
[43:11] And if we start with Jesus, then you
[43:14] know what? We'll finish with Jesus
[43:18] &gt;&gt; and then we'll have Jesus all through
[43:20] the middle.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; It's all about the Lord Jesus.
[43:25] I I I want to mention I mentioned this
[43:26] on Wednesday night that uh this man
[43:32] uh was was murdered and one of the most
[43:35] influential voices in the world today
[43:39] pointing youth to Jesus Christ and away
[43:42] from just hatefilled
[43:45] agendas.
[43:46] And that's this man named Charlie Kirk.
[43:49] And in his legacy, I've been blessed to
[43:52] notice that the memorials, the
[43:54] gatherings that have been in on his
[43:56] behalf have been very peaceful, very
[43:58] welcoming, and they're still willing to
[44:02] extend a hand of fellowship across
[44:04] political and religious lines, and I
[44:06] appreciated that with him. Um, Brother
[44:10] Aaron,
[44:12] could you turn the air down a little
[44:13] bit? I think I see some fans going on
[44:16] and if you could if you could turn that
[44:19] down. But I I believe that this man
[44:23] Charlie Kirk, I believe he was a great
[44:24] man and he did a whole lot and he was
[44:28] very respectful to everyone he was
[44:30] talking to and and everyone he was
[44:32] debating with. He at 18 years old, he
[44:34] started this organization called Turning
[44:37] Point. And he would go to college
[44:41] campuses. Remember at 18 years old, we
[44:44] we at 18 years old, he would go to
[44:47] college campuses and he would sit down
[44:50] at a table and he would say
[44:53] um I think it was education is stupid.
[44:56] prove me wrong.
[44:59] And he was so smart. And he would talk
[45:02] about how the educational system and he
[45:06] would of course not categorically
[45:09] that there is a place for education.
[45:10] There's a place to um to move forward in
[45:13] that way. But just going to school for
[45:15] no reason. Charlie was very against and
[45:18] he did a good job and and he brought in
[45:21] Jesus Christ into many of his talks and
[45:24] many of his debates. And I think that he
[45:26] was at his best not when he was talking
[45:28] about political things, but when he was
[45:31] arguing the point of Christ. And I I
[45:35] really appreciate him and and uh this
[45:39] young man that that killed him. It looks
[45:42] like he was
[45:45] uh radicalized by the internet, what he
[45:48] was reading there, and also um from
[45:51] gaming, the games that he would play,
[45:54] the the violence that was surrounding
[45:56] him. And I'm about to probably
[46:02] disagree with 90% of the people in this
[46:05] building. So, don't throw anything at
[46:08] me. Don't get up and leave. Um, lock the
[46:11] doors.
[46:13] You're going to hear it, friends. I'm
[46:16] against I am I am against the death
[46:19] penalty.
[46:20] And I say that
[46:23] not because we don't someone that would
[46:25] commit such a heinous crime wouldn't be
[46:28] deserving of that.
[46:30] But I believe every sinner needs the
[46:34] opportunity to repent. No matter what
[46:36] the crime is.
[46:38] this this young man is confused and I
[46:40] believe he's possessed with an evil
[46:42] spirit and he should spend the rest of
[46:44] his life in prison for his crimes. He
[46:46] should answer for these things where he
[46:47] can reflect on these things and even
[46:49] possibly consider that Jesus Christ died
[46:51] for his sins. Also
[46:54] remember Christ died on the cross next
[46:58] to two vile criminals.
[47:02] And he also took the place of a murderer
[47:06] when he went to the cross. This man
[47:08] named Barabus. Barabbus was freed and
[47:13] Jesus answered for his crimes.
[47:17] He was
[47:19] punished the way that a criminal should
[47:22] be punished or or was punished. And and
[47:26] he died according to the death penalty.
[47:29] Jesus did, which in my mind says that he
[47:34] died
[47:36] even for those who deserve the death
[47:39] penalty.
[47:40] So I
[47:42] I look at this young man and he did a a
[47:45] horrible thing, but
[47:48] I pray that he would turn his ways.
[47:52] We've heard, I quote it many times,
[47:54] brother Random said, one soul is worth
[47:56] 10,000 worlds. That means that man's
[48:00] soul, too.
[48:01] I pray that of course he should spend
[48:04] the rest of his life in prison, but I
[48:05] pray that he will find the Lord and that
[48:08] soul would would repent. You know, we
[48:11] hear so much before I get into my sermon
[48:13] today. We hear so much about the
[48:15] unpardonable sin. And I think, did this
[48:18] young man commit the unpardonable sin by
[48:20] killing one of the kindest, kindest, and
[48:23] most dedicated people in the world
[48:24] today? I don't think he did.
[48:28] Is the unpardonable pardonable sin maybe
[48:31] suicide as some people say? I don't
[48:33] think it is. Is the unpardonable sin
[48:36] disrespecting God through our words and
[48:39] blasphemy? I don't think it is either.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; In my opinion,
[48:44] the unpardonable sin,
[48:47] the things that you cannot be forgiven
[48:49] for are the things that you refuse to
[48:52] ask for forgiveness of.
[48:55] If you think that you're justified in
[48:57] committing a sin and you don't need
[48:59] forgiveness, then how can you be
[49:01] forgiven for that?
[49:04] &gt;&gt; The secret sins
[49:06] are the dangerous sins.
[49:09] The self-righteous maybe church member
[49:13] who is always condemning others by the
[49:16] way that maybe they look or maybe their
[49:18] past sins and yet the sin is kept inside
[49:23] in this person. Imagine the willingness
[49:26] to lie, maybe to get your own way.
[49:30] Willing to to lie to protect maybe
[49:33] inward sins, the gossip maybe that will
[49:37] destroy someone's character because they
[49:40] don't agree with you. And yet you don't
[49:43] repent of these things.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus himself was condemned to die on
[49:48] the cross because of a lie. Remember
[49:54] the ninth commandment.
[49:56] We all think most people say it says
[49:59] thou shalt not lie. It's not the ninth
[50:01] commandment. The ninth commandment is
[50:04] thou shalt not bear false witness
[50:09] which is far far worse.
[50:12] We we shouldn't bear false witness
[50:15] against anyone. And friends, really, how
[50:19] can you be pardoned for a sin where you
[50:22] will not repent of that sin?
[50:26] That's why a sinner coming to the Lord,
[50:29] I think, is one of the most blessed
[50:31] things in the world.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; No matter who you are, no matter no
[50:34] matter what you've done, it could be
[50:36] something as vile as this person did to
[50:39] Charlie Kirk. Or it could be just
[50:41] someone that has a problem with lying or
[50:44] gossiping about other others or even
[50:46] just getting their own way. That sinner
[50:49] that comes to Christ is a blessed thing.
[50:52] The angels rejoice in heaven. When this
[50:55] happens,
[50:57] I
[50:59] the I've had many that are in this
[51:03] congregation, a few that have come to me
[51:07] over the past couple years since I've
[51:09] been pastor, and they've told me that
[51:12] they are very ashamed of their past
[51:15] life, and they bear the scars of it.
[51:17] They're embarrassed of what they used to
[51:19] be. And and
[51:22] I want you to know friends, if you are
[51:24] one of those people that that are really
[51:26] struggling with the things that you've
[51:28] done and you've repented of these things
[51:31] and and you you you
[51:34] have to understand that that's who
[51:38] that's the exact person that accepted
[51:40] Jesus Christ.
[51:42] Those are the exact people, the ones
[51:44] that had sin, outward sin, that people
[51:47] knew their sin. Those are the ones that
[51:49] came to the Lord Jesus for mercy.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; It was those people. It was Mary
[51:55] Magdalene.
[51:56] It was Matthew, a crooked businessman.
[52:00] It was Zakius, a crooked businessman. It
[52:02] was these people that had these outward
[52:04] sins. They are the ones that came to
[52:07] Jesus and bowed down at his feet and
[52:09] repented. And it was the ones that were
[52:12] the holy so-called holy people, the ones
[52:15] that didn't think that they had any
[52:17] sins, that thought that they were better
[52:18] than someone else that not only didn't
[52:20] repent of their sins, but they crucified
[52:22] Jesus.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; It was those people.
[52:27] And I and and friends, you that that
[52:31] beat yourself up
[52:34] about things that you have done,
[52:37] do you think that God will require two
[52:40] penalties for you? You've repented.
[52:44] You've made it right. God God doesn't
[52:47] require God doesn't require anymore.
[52:51] That's you've laid it at his feet. It's
[52:54] over. It's done. You still have to live
[52:57] with it, but you don't have to. You
[53:00] won't go to heaven with it. It's gone.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; But it's those ones that hold on to it.
[53:09] It's those ones that will not repent,
[53:12] that are judgmental of others. Those are
[53:15] the ones that I truly worry about.
[53:18] Those are the ones that, as I said, they
[53:19] crucified Jesus. There won't be two
[53:22] penalties, friends. Don't worry.
[53:25] You've changed as the people in the
[53:27] Bible has changed. And you can say, "I
[53:30] am one
[53:32] who was like these people in the Bible
[53:34] that truly accepted Jesus and didn't
[53:36] point any fingers at anyone else." This
[53:40] young man that killed Charlie Kirk, I do
[53:42] I pray that he he repents and I pray
[53:43] that he sees the evilness of of his ways
[53:47] and I pray that he sees how he gave in
[53:50] to the temptations of the devil. And
[53:53] then on the day of judgment,
[53:55] I do pray that the blood of Jesus Christ
[53:57] would cover his sins as they cover mine.
[54:01] I uh I ministered last week on uh the
[54:04] title of the sermon was let it cook and
[54:08] it was basically don't do anything just
[54:11] quickly or halfhazardly. And some of
[54:14] these scriptures that that I read, I was
[54:16] saying listen, let these things cook for
[54:19] a while. think about these scriptures
[54:21] that I'm reading and don't just go on to
[54:24] the next one, but think about them. And
[54:26] one of the things that's been cooking in
[54:28] me all week that I just I just can't get
[54:31] past it is I read in Luke where where
[54:35] Luke said that Jesus increases in wisdom
[54:40] and stature and in favor with God and
[54:43] men. Now he was 12 years old and he was
[54:46] asking he went to the temple. He was
[54:48] asking questions to the priests and and
[54:51] and the and they were he was he was
[54:54] listening to the teachers and then it
[54:57] started where he started teaching the
[54:59] teachers and these priests were like wow
[55:01] this kid is sharp. There is something
[55:04] special about this kid. It's when he was
[55:06] 12 years old. And then there is a period
[55:09] of silence only filled in by what Luke
[55:12] said that Jesus increased in wisdom and
[55:15] in stature and in favor with God and
[55:18] men.
[55:20] And as I've been cooking on that all
[55:22] week, I think he's God in flesh. The
[55:25] Bible says,
[55:28] why did the son of God increase in favor
[55:30] with God?
[55:32] He obviously
[55:34] studied the scriptures during this time
[55:36] from 12 to 30 years old. And I'll read
[55:40] in a few moments. I know that because
[55:42] I'll read in a few moments that Jesus
[55:45] quoted the scripture. He quoted Moses's
[55:49] books.
[55:50] And you need to know the scriptures,
[55:52] friends, to quote the scriptures. You
[55:55] can't just all of a sudden show up and
[55:59] quote the scriptures. You got to have
[56:01] read them first. You got to have studied
[56:03] them. It takes time. It takes time to
[56:07] get knowledgeable in the word. And then
[56:11] we know that we see that any more than
[56:14] anyone else, Jesus, the son of God,
[56:17] prayed.
[56:19] He prayed. He prayed all night. One
[56:21] night, he prayed constantly. Always
[56:24] getting away and praying. So you you
[56:26] think, how could he grow
[56:29] with God? Well, he grew from reading the
[56:31] scriptures and he grew from praying. And
[56:34] then it also says, and I don't want to
[56:36] forget this, he grew in favor with man.
[56:42] How do you grow in favor with man? You
[56:45] do things right. I had a friend um well
[56:50] he was a colleague in uh in one of our
[56:52] offices and I I went and talked to him
[56:54] and he he uh when I was there in the
[56:56] office he got me and uh his immediate
[57:00] supervisor and he says hey can I talk to
[57:02] you all for a second and uh whenever
[57:04] somebody does that it's like uh oh you
[57:06] know what's what's going on so we go
[57:08] into the office in private and he says
[57:12] he said this he said uh I think I'm
[57:14] going to take uh retirement
[57:16] He says, "But I'm torn."
[57:19] He said, "I want to do what's right for
[57:22] me."
[57:24] And he says, "I want to do what's right
[57:26] for my family." And he says, "But I also
[57:28] don't want to leave my office um because
[57:31] I know that you can't hire to replace
[57:32] me. I also want to do what's right for
[57:34] my office." He said, he said, "I don't
[57:36] want to leave all of my friends to where
[57:38] they have to do all of my work while I
[57:40] retire." And he he says, he says, "But
[57:42] you know, I have to do what's right with
[57:43] my family." And I said, "Wait a minute,
[57:44] Shannon." And I said, I said, ' Let me
[57:46] stop you for a minute. You don't do
[57:48] what's right for you.
[57:51] And I said, and neither do you do what's
[57:53] right for your family. And I said,
[57:56] neither do you do what's right for your
[57:59] office colleagues. I said, what you need
[58:02] to do is you need to do what is right.
[58:06] Period.
[58:08] There's an answer to what is right. And
[58:11] if we're always thinking, I want to do
[58:13] what's right for this person. and I want
[58:14] to do what's right for me. I want to do
[58:16] what's right for my family. We might
[58:17] very well miss the mind of God. And I
[58:20] said, "You need to do what's right. You
[58:22] need to go home. You need to pray about
[58:24] this. And then you need to make the
[58:26] decision. Not what's right for you, but
[58:28] what's right. Period."
[58:31] And the guy, he's this giant guy. He got
[58:34] up and man, he gave me the biggest hug.
[58:38] And he said, "Dan, I've known you since
[58:40] we were kids when we worked together a
[58:42] long time ago." And he says, "You always
[58:45] have wisdom." And that's wisdom. And
[58:48] it's easy for me to say you need to do
[58:50] what's right. Now, it's what's right for
[58:52] you or your family. But how do you do
[58:54] that?
[58:56] It's easy to say it, but how do you
[58:58] actually do what's right? And what you
[59:00] do is you pray about this. You ask God,
[59:06] Lord, what is your will? Not my will,
[59:07] but Lord, what is your will? So Jesus,
[59:11] this man, he grew up, as I said, from 12
[59:15] to 30, and he grew in favor with men. He
[59:21] gained the favor of those that knew him.
[59:24] He must have been honest. He must have
[59:27] been always on the level. He must have
[59:29] always done what was right. We know he
[59:32] was. We know he did because he was the
[59:33] son of God and he was the sinless son of
[59:35] God. He always did that which was right.
[59:38] Dwight Moody said this. Out of a hundred
[59:40] men, one will read the Bible and the
[59:44] other 99 will read the Christian.
[59:49] Out of a 100 men, one will read the
[59:51] Bible and the other 99 out of a hundred
[59:53] will read the Christian. I assume
[59:55] Brother Brandham was quoting Dwight
[59:57] Moody when he said this. We are known by
[59:59] the life that we live and it's been said
[1:00:02] your life speaks so loud that I can't
[1:00:04] hear your testimony.
[1:00:06] So therefore to live a sermon which be
[1:00:09] would be much better than to preach one.
[1:00:14] So during these 18 years of silence from
[1:00:16] 12 to 30 Jesus gained the respect of of
[1:00:19] those who knew him. And in everything I
[1:00:22] teach I quote Jesus more than I quote
[1:00:25] anyone else in the Bible. And really
[1:00:28] Jesus was one that he actually lived
[1:00:32] what he taught. He was the one person
[1:00:34] that did it. And when we get to the
[1:00:36] sermon on the mount in the in the coming
[1:00:38] weeks, Jesus is going to say things and
[1:00:42] I I really wanted to start ministering
[1:00:46] on really the greatest sermon that was
[1:00:49] ever preached.
[1:00:51] This was, I think, the highlight of any
[1:00:57] sermon anyone had ever preached to that
[1:00:59] time or since that time. And that is
[1:01:02] this sermon that Jesus stands and all of
[1:01:05] these thousands of people are around and
[1:01:08] he preaches something that had never
[1:01:11] been preached before. The greatest in my
[1:01:16] opinion of all of the sermons was this
[1:01:20] sermon on the mount.
[1:01:22] And Jesus
[1:01:25] says things like to prefer your brother
[1:01:28] over yourself.
[1:01:30] He says, "I didn't come to destroy the
[1:01:32] law, the teachings of Moses. I came to
[1:01:36] fulfill it." And he says, "You don't you
[1:01:39] don't throw away." And he's saying that
[1:01:41] he's saying you don't throw away the Old
[1:01:43] Testament. Jesus was the fulfillment of
[1:01:45] the Old Testament. And then he raises
[1:01:47] the level of the Old Testament. And he
[1:01:51] says if you just desire to have an
[1:01:56] affair with someone other than your
[1:01:57] wife, you've committed adultery. Not if
[1:02:00] you do it, but if you want to do it,
[1:02:03] you've committed adultery. If you call
[1:02:06] someone worthless,
[1:02:08] then you're in danger of hell.
[1:02:10] is what Jesus said in this sermon on the
[1:02:13] mount. It's really the most amazing
[1:02:16] sermon. And the most amazing thing is
[1:02:18] that Jesus proved that he he lived every
[1:02:23] word that he preached and he had already
[1:02:27] lived it. It wasn't like a a fallible
[1:02:30] man like me coming up here and opening
[1:02:33] this Bible and preaching the word and
[1:02:35] saying that you should live the word and
[1:02:37] then I have failed in many ways and any
[1:02:40] other minister has. But Jesus when he
[1:02:43] preached it, he had actually done it. He
[1:02:46] had accomplished what he was preaching.
[1:02:48] Hebrews chapter 2 verse 17.
[1:02:54] We're going to talk about the temptation
[1:02:55] of Jesus today. Hebrews chapter 2 verse
[1:02:58] 17. I'll read the New King James
[1:03:00] Version. It says this, "Therefore, in
[1:03:04] all things
[1:03:06] he had to be made like his brethren,
[1:03:13] that he might be a merciful
[1:03:15] and faithful high priest in things
[1:03:18] pertaining to God to make propitiation
[1:03:22] for the sins of the people. For in that
[1:03:24] he himself has suffered being tempted.
[1:03:27] He is able to aid those who are tempted.
[1:03:31] He's able to help those that are
[1:03:33] tempted. So the author of Hebrews is
[1:03:35] saying here that he was like us so he
[1:03:38] would understand how we are tempted. You
[1:03:41] can never truly understand someone's
[1:03:43] trials unless you have been there. If
[1:03:46] someone loses a baby, if someone is
[1:03:49] trying to overcome addiction or was hurt
[1:03:52] in church, you cannot truly empathize
[1:03:54] with that person unless you've been
[1:03:55] there yourself. And that is what the
[1:03:58] scripture means. Jesus was made like us
[1:04:01] so he would understand our temptations.
[1:04:04] He was great. He had been through it.
[1:04:08] Hebrews chapter 4:1 15 says this, "For
[1:04:12] we have not a high priest which cannot
[1:04:14] be touched with the feeling of our
[1:04:15] infirmities, but was in all points
[1:04:17] tempted like as we are, yet without
[1:04:19] sin."
[1:04:21] The New King James says, "For we do not
[1:04:23] have a high priest who cannot sympathize
[1:04:25] with our weaknesses, but was in all
[1:04:27] points tempted as we are, yet without
[1:04:30] sin."
[1:04:32] Without sin is the key. He knows how it
[1:04:35] feels when an alcoholic desires a drink.
[1:04:38] He knows how it feels when a liar wants
[1:04:40] to lie. He knows how it feels when a
[1:04:42] temper raises up. But he overcame those
[1:04:45] temptations his entire life. He was a
[1:04:48] carpenter. He knew how it was to not get
[1:04:50] paid for your work. He knew how it was
[1:04:53] to get cheated.
[1:04:55] And he handled things the right way in
[1:04:57] every way, gaining favor with men.
[1:05:03] So with what brother Brandham said, he
[1:05:05] says, 'We are known by the life that we
[1:05:07] live and it's been said that your life
[1:05:09] speaks so loud I can't hear your
[1:05:11] testimony. So therefore to live a sermon
[1:05:14] which be would be which would be much
[1:05:17] better than to preach one.
[1:05:22] We um and that's how it is. It's it's in
[1:05:24] business. It's witnessing to someone.
[1:05:27] It's inviting someone to church.
[1:05:29] whatever it might be. If you live that
[1:05:32] life, if you live that sermon, if you
[1:05:34] live the way Jesus lived, it's a whole
[1:05:36] lot better than just the preacher up
[1:05:38] here telling you, "Here's what the Bible
[1:05:40] says, now you should do it." But when
[1:05:42] you take what the Bible says and then
[1:05:44] you actually do it, now we have
[1:05:47] something. Now we have something
[1:05:49] powerful.
[1:05:51] Now,
[1:05:52] when Jesus was walking through, I was
[1:05:54] talking with Stephanie about this with
[1:05:56] this the other day.
[1:05:59] Jesus had this respect among the
[1:06:02] community. So when he walked up to the
[1:06:04] boat
[1:06:06] with Peter and James and John and Andrew
[1:06:10] and he said, "Come follow me." He
[1:06:12] already had a reputation. They dropped
[1:06:14] their nets and they went right after
[1:06:16] him. The same thing with Matthew. When
[1:06:20] Matthew saw him going by and he looked
[1:06:22] down at Matthew, he said, "Come follow
[1:06:23] me." Matthew dropped all of his stuff
[1:06:26] and he went and followed Jesus because
[1:06:28] Jesus had already gained favor with men.
[1:06:32] He was living a testimony. He was doing
[1:06:36] it right. The Bible says that a pastor
[1:06:40] must have a good reputation
[1:06:43] with those that are outside the church.
[1:06:46] You can't just be a good preacher and
[1:06:48] walk into the role of a leader. You've
[1:06:50] got to earn a reputation outside the
[1:06:52] church in the world. You have to have a
[1:06:55] good reputation. It says that in the
[1:06:56] book of First Timothy. It also says that
[1:06:58] in Titus.
[1:07:01] It commands that. And I look at this
[1:07:03] Charlie Kirk. This man had earned
[1:07:06] respect. He wasn't just given it. He
[1:07:09] started turning point. I said at 18
[1:07:12] years old and he earned that respect. He
[1:07:17] did it right with Jesus. Every time he
[1:07:20] was given the opportunity to make a
[1:07:22] decision, he made the right one. But
[1:07:24] don't think he wasn't tempted to make
[1:07:27] the wrong decision. He was. The Bible
[1:07:29] says he was. He was tempted in every
[1:07:31] manner yet without sin. And the wrong
[1:07:34] decisions, friends, they are so easy to
[1:07:37] make.
[1:07:40] I say all this because people so often
[1:07:43] look at Jesus as this untouchable God.
[1:07:46] You know, you think, well, he's he's
[1:07:48] God. He's perfect. And he was perfect.
[1:07:50] But he also understands what we go
[1:07:53] through. The very touchable nature of
[1:07:55] God is Jesus Christ. He is the one that
[1:07:59] we can touch. He is the one that
[1:08:01] understands. God is a spirit. But he had
[1:08:04] to come down in the form of a human
[1:08:06] being to feel what we feel, to go
[1:08:09] through what we go through. That's what
[1:08:11] makes him so great, that we can reach
[1:08:14] out and we can touch it. And he says,
[1:08:15] "You know what, son? I know what you're
[1:08:18] going through. I know how you feel."
[1:08:24] Is it? So Jesus goes through and we he
[1:08:27] spends these 18 years in silence.
[1:08:30] And
[1:08:32] this is the beginning now of his
[1:08:34] ministry. And we'll eventually get to
[1:08:36] the masterpiece of all sermons. Like I
[1:08:38] said before, we won't today.
[1:08:42] But
[1:08:43] what led up to this sermon on the mount?
[1:08:47] Let's go to Matthew chapter 3
[1:08:49] verse 16.
[1:08:52] I'm sorry for the heat. I'm feeling it
[1:08:55] up here, too.
[1:08:57] Matthew chapter 3.
[1:09:00] No, I'm not letting you out early.
[1:09:04] I'll just take off my tie.
[1:09:07] I'm always looking for an excuse to do
[1:09:09] that. Matthew ch Matthew 3:1 16 says
[1:09:12] this. And Jesus when he was baptized
[1:09:14] went up straightway out of the water and
[1:09:16] lo, the heavens were opened unto him and
[1:09:18] he saw the spirit of God descending like
[1:09:20] a dove and lighting upon him. And lo, a
[1:09:23] voice from heaven saying, this is my
[1:09:24] beloved son in whom I'm well pleased.
[1:09:29] And then in Luke chapter 4, it says
[1:09:32] this. And Jesus being full of the Holy
[1:09:34] Ghost returned from Jordan and was led
[1:09:37] by the spirit into the wilderness.
[1:09:42] So now even with all the temptations
[1:09:44] Jesus had experienced as a young man and
[1:09:47] all the temptations that he overcame and
[1:09:49] the good reputation he developed, it was
[1:09:52] time that Jesus faced a temptation that
[1:09:55] was higher than he had ever faced.
[1:09:59] Matthew chapter 4 verse one. I'll go
[1:10:01] back and forth from Matthew and Luke
[1:10:04] probably here. They're telling the same
[1:10:05] story, different perspectives. Let's
[1:10:08] keep uh Matthew up on the screen if I go
[1:10:10] into Luke. Let's just keep Matthew
[1:10:12] there. Matthew chapter 4 verse one. Then
[1:10:15] was Jesus led up of the spirit into the
[1:10:17] wilderness to be tempted of the devil.
[1:10:19] And when he had fasted 40 days and 40
[1:10:21] nights, he was afterward a hunger. He
[1:10:24] was hungry. So 40 days he was without
[1:10:27] food. He was emaciated. He didn't have
[1:10:29] any energy. He was weak and he's hungry.
[1:10:32] Now Jesus is at the weakest point and
[1:10:36] now the enemy steps in. Now I want to
[1:10:39] point out this is very important. The
[1:10:41] scripture says that Jesus was led into
[1:10:44] the wilderness to be tempted of the
[1:10:46] devil. This was not Jesus's choice.
[1:10:51] The spirit led him to be tempted. And
[1:10:55] and friends, when we go into temptation,
[1:10:58] let's make sure that we are not walking
[1:11:01] into the temptation ourselves. If you
[1:11:03] have a problem with drinking, don't go
[1:11:07] to the liquor store. Don't hang around
[1:11:09] with people that drink. If you have a
[1:11:11] problem with with with sleeping around
[1:11:14] or you're weak there, stay away from
[1:11:16] that that young man or that young woman
[1:11:18] or that that boy or girl, stay away from
[1:11:20] that person. Don't allow yourself to be
[1:11:23] in a in a situation where you get
[1:11:24] tempted.
[1:11:26] Stay away from the temptation even. But
[1:11:30] Jesus, this was not his choice. It was
[1:11:32] God that led him to this place to be
[1:11:35] tempted.
[1:11:37] And he's in the wilderness now in 1
[1:11:39] Corinthians chapter 10. Let's talk about
[1:11:40] this temptation for a moment. 1
[1:11:42] Corinthians chapter chapter 10 says
[1:11:44] this. No temptation has overtaken you.
[1:11:47] I'll read the New King James Version. 1
[1:11:49] Corinthians 10:13. No temptation has
[1:11:52] overtaken you except such as is common
[1:11:55] to man. But God is faithful who will not
[1:11:58] allow you to be tempted beyond what you
[1:12:01] are able, but with the temptation will
[1:12:05] also make a way of escape that you may
[1:12:09] bear it.
[1:12:11] So Jesus, he's already experienced most
[1:12:13] of the temptations that all of us have
[1:12:14] experienced. sexual desires, lying,
[1:12:17] gossip, money, problems, hatred,
[1:12:20] resentment, pride.
[1:12:23] By the time that he was 30 years old,
[1:12:26] he had experienced all of those. But God
[1:12:28] is requiring more of Christ here. He's
[1:12:31] sending him out into the wilderness to
[1:12:33] be tempted. And here the first
[1:12:35] Corinthians says, "No temptation has
[1:12:37] overtaken you except that is common to
[1:12:39] man." So when you are tempted, don't
[1:12:42] think that you're weird.
[1:12:46] If you have strange thoughts,
[1:12:50] those thoughts that you might be feeling
[1:12:52] that you think, "Well, I'm the only
[1:12:53] one." The Bible says right here, "No,
[1:12:56] those thoughts that you're experiencing
[1:12:57] are common." And another thing,
[1:13:01] he will not lay a temptation on you that
[1:13:04] you are not able to overcome. So, anyone
[1:13:08] that tells me, "I just couldn't overcome
[1:13:10] it." That's not true. The Bible says
[1:13:11] something different. You could have
[1:13:12] overcame it. You gave in. You did it
[1:13:15] yourself.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; You made the conscious choice to sin. 1
[1:13:20] Corinthians 10 says it right here. You
[1:13:23] did it yourself. You could have overcome
[1:13:25] it. So then Jesus goes out into the
[1:13:28] wilderness to battle with Satan himself.
[1:13:32] Now when we get into I just have a 15
[1:13:35] minutes left. When we get into this,
[1:13:39] you'll notice that as Jesus is talking
[1:13:42] with Satan,
[1:13:44] you wonder what the situation is. Was he
[1:13:47] talking to a man?
[1:13:49] Was there a man there
[1:13:52] talking with him that looked like Satan?
[1:13:55] Whatever Satan looks like. I I don't
[1:13:57] think that he probably had horns and a
[1:13:59] fork tail. That wouldn't deceive
[1:14:01] anybody.
[1:14:03] But was he a was he maybe a nicel
[1:14:05] looking man? Maybe was he a minister?
[1:14:08] Maybe. Or
[1:14:11] was much of this just happening inside
[1:14:13] of Jesus's head?
[1:14:16] I'll tell you, you can probably attest
[1:14:19] that most of the deception that we go
[1:14:22] through is right here. It's not
[1:14:24] necessarily someone telling you
[1:14:26] something that's wrong. It's you
[1:14:29] entertaining thoughts that are in your
[1:14:31] mind. allowing them to stay
[1:14:35] and then acting out on those thoughts
[1:14:39] that you have. There is the greatest
[1:14:42] battle ever fought as we've we know is
[1:14:44] right in our minds.
[1:14:47] And here is Jesus. Much of this
[1:14:50] temptation is going on in his mind.
[1:14:54] He's tired. Bible says he's hungry.
[1:14:58] 40 days since he's eaten. And when the
[1:15:02] tempter came to him,
[1:15:04] verse number three, Matthew chapter 4,
[1:15:06] verse number three, and when the tempter
[1:15:08] came to him, he said, "If thou be the
[1:15:11] son of God, command that these stones be
[1:15:14] made to bread, be made bread."
[1:15:17] I believe this is in Jesus's mind here.
[1:15:19] I believe it was Satan, very much Satan.
[1:15:23] But if it would have been a man there, I
[1:15:24] don't know if it is as deceiving as
[1:15:27] Satan getting into our minds. It could.
[1:15:30] We don't know what it was. No one knows.
[1:15:31] And I don't claim to know.
[1:15:34] But the devil in a physical body is not
[1:15:37] nearly as powerful as the devil in this
[1:15:40] form.
[1:15:42] We can't help the thoughts that come
[1:15:43] into our minds, friends. We can't help
[1:15:45] those. But we can keep them from staying
[1:15:47] there. You have control over what you
[1:15:50] think about. You can't have you can't
[1:15:52] control it when it pops in, but you can
[1:15:54] sure pop it out.
[1:15:57] And I told him, "We'll make up a whole
[1:15:58] story in our minds."
[1:16:01] When she says this, I'm gonna say that.
[1:16:06] I know he's gonna come to work and he's
[1:16:08] going to say this. And and when he tells
[1:16:10] me that I have to go clean that organ,
[1:16:12] I'm going to I'm going to let him have
[1:16:14] it. I'm going to say, "Well, the other
[1:16:15] guys are supposed to do that." And you
[1:16:16] go through this whole thing in your your
[1:16:18] mind. And guess what? It never happens.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; And how come you always win those
[1:16:24] arguments in your mind?
[1:16:29] It's because the the enemy, he's getting
[1:16:31] in there and he's taking your joy away
[1:16:33] and he's causing all this anxiety and
[1:16:35] he's trying to ruin your life. You can
[1:16:37] never count on the devil. Never. And
[1:16:40] here is Jesus and he says, "If you be
[1:16:43] the son of God," let's read it again.
[1:16:46] And when the tempter came to him, he
[1:16:47] said, "If thou be the son of God,
[1:16:49] command that these stones be made to
[1:16:51] bread."
[1:16:52] The only thing I can do here is I can
[1:16:54] apply this to my own life. And the
[1:16:56] deception that comes into my own life
[1:16:59] has been the result most of the time of
[1:17:01] the thoughts that have entered my mind
[1:17:03] and then me entertaining those thoughts.
[1:17:07] But we do know that Jesus in this
[1:17:10] situation is there alone just him,
[1:17:15] Satan, and his thoughts.
[1:17:19] And he says, "If you're the son of God,"
[1:17:20] so the devil doesn't really believe he's
[1:17:22] the son of God. He says, "If you're the
[1:17:24] son of God,"
[1:17:26] we might in our minds, us, we might say,
[1:17:31] "If I be a son of God, or if I be a
[1:17:34] daughter of God, then maybe I wouldn't
[1:17:36] do these things. So, how can I be a son
[1:17:38] of go a son of God? How can I be a
[1:17:39] daughter of God because I've done these
[1:17:41] things?" And here and then Satan starts
[1:17:44] to starts to go around and he's starting
[1:17:46] to test Jesus and he's like, "Oh, if
[1:17:48] you're the son of God, prove it."
[1:17:52] And then
[1:17:55] Jesus answers him
[1:17:58] and he says,
[1:18:01] "It is written that man shall not live
[1:18:02] by bread alone, but by every word that
[1:18:05] proceedth out of the mouth of God." So
[1:18:06] he's quoting the book of Deuteronomy
[1:18:08] here from Deuteronomy chapter 8. And
[1:18:11] he's basically saying, "Satan, I don't
[1:18:12] need to bow to you. I may not have as
[1:18:15] much as I want, but I live by faith in
[1:18:18] the word of God." And then later on in
[1:18:21] the next chapter, he's going to go or in
[1:18:22] two chapters, he's going to go and talk
[1:18:24] about on the sermon on the mountain, and
[1:18:26] he's going to say that you don't need to
[1:18:27] worry about these worldly things. You
[1:18:29] don't have to worry that God is going to
[1:18:31] provide for you because he loves you.
[1:18:33] And here is Jesus. Satan is there and
[1:18:36] he's saying if you're the son of God or
[1:18:37] we could say if I am a son of God or a
[1:18:39] daughter of God then make these stones
[1:18:42] into bread. And Jesus is is like listen
[1:18:45] my God will provide. I don't have to bow
[1:18:46] to you. And he's hungry.
[1:18:50] He's starving to death.
[1:18:53] I mean
[1:18:55] think about us.
[1:18:57] If he'd asked me
[1:19:00] and I knew I had the power, I might be
[1:19:03] like, "Well, bread and a steak."
[1:19:07] But no, Jesus says, "No.
[1:19:10] I'm not bowing to you, Satan. My God's
[1:19:13] going to provide." And he lived what he
[1:19:15] was talking about.
[1:19:18] And there is Jesus. He's as poor as he
[1:19:20] can be in the desert. He hasn't eaten
[1:19:22] for 40 days. No way to get food. No way
[1:19:24] to buy food at the market. dying of
[1:19:26] starvation, no one to help him. And yet,
[1:19:28] he quotes the Bible, and he doesn't
[1:19:30] complain.
[1:19:32] He knew he was going to eat again.
[1:19:35] He knew God was going to provide. He
[1:19:37] trusted God. Then the devil taketh him
[1:19:40] up to the holy city, and setth them on
[1:19:42] the pinnacle of the temple, and saith
[1:19:44] unto him, "If thou be the son of God,
[1:19:46] cast thyself down. For it is written, he
[1:19:49] shall give angels charge concerning
[1:19:51] thee, and their and in their hands they
[1:19:53] shall bear thee up, lest at any time
[1:19:55] thou dash thy foot against a stone. The
[1:19:59] devil's quoting the Bible and he's
[1:20:01] misinterpreting the scriptures. He's
[1:20:03] quoting Psalm 91
[1:20:05] verbatim, but he's misplacing those
[1:20:08] scriptures. And we need to be careful,
[1:20:10] friends. We need to be careful
[1:20:11] misquoting scriptures, misplacing
[1:20:15] scriptures to back up what we think.
[1:20:18] It's exactly what Satan did.
[1:20:21] The same devil that was there with Jesus
[1:20:24] on that day is the same devil that's
[1:20:26] trying to get people to make bad
[1:20:27] decisions today
[1:20:30] with the justification that God
[1:20:33] is going to come to your rescue.
[1:20:38] There was no need for Jesus to jump off
[1:20:41] the temple. There was no need for any of
[1:20:44] that except for what? Why would he have
[1:20:47] jumped off the temple and the angels
[1:20:48] grabbed him? It would have been to
[1:20:50] glorify himself.
[1:20:52] It would have been to show some big
[1:20:53] thing that I am the son of God. So, I am
[1:20:57] going to do this and I'm going to show
[1:21:00] everyone what a Christian I am. I'm
[1:21:02] going to show everyone what a leader I
[1:21:03] am. I'm going to show everyone what a
[1:21:04] minister I am. I'm going to show
[1:21:06] everyone how much faith I have. How many
[1:21:08] fall into that trap?
[1:21:12] But just that humble way. I was I
[1:21:14] watched this u this video somebody sent
[1:21:16] me on on YouTube where there was this
[1:21:19] bodybuilder and he was working out and
[1:21:21] he had a he had his camera set up there
[1:21:22] and he's videoing himself. They love
[1:21:24] themselves, man. You know, they're they
[1:21:26] got video camera. and they got their
[1:21:28] phone around and I don't know what he's
[1:21:29] going to do with it. But he's he's
[1:21:31] sitting there and he's he's doing this
[1:21:32] and this little dude comes up and sits
[1:21:35] between him and the camera on this bench
[1:21:37] and he starts doing this thing and
[1:21:40] here's the big bodybuilder and he has
[1:21:41] his dumbbells and he says something,
[1:21:43] throws his dumbbells down and he knocks
[1:21:46] the guy's hat off and he he starts
[1:21:48] telling him he's like, "Can't you see
[1:21:50] the camera over there?" And the guy was
[1:21:52] a master judo guy, the little dude. And
[1:21:56] all of a sudden, this guy's legs are
[1:22:00] wrapped around this bodybuilder's neck
[1:22:04] up in the air and they cut fall to the
[1:22:07] ground and he's got the guy in an
[1:22:09] armbar.
[1:22:11] The judo guy was humble.
[1:22:14] But it came time that he had to use it.
[1:22:17] Here Jesus doesn't have to use it. He is
[1:22:20] he is just saying, "Satan, you can't
[1:22:22] tempt me." And Jesus said unto him, it
[1:22:25] is written that thou shalt not tempt the
[1:22:26] Lord thy God. And again the devil taketh
[1:22:29] them up to an exceeding high mountain,
[1:22:31] and showing him and shows him all the
[1:22:33] kingdoms of the world, and the glory of
[1:22:35] them, and saith unto him, all these
[1:22:39] things will I give thee if thou will
[1:22:40] fall down and worship me.
[1:22:43] Let that cook for a minute. This happens
[1:22:46] in our minds every day.
[1:22:51] None of us are going to outwardly
[1:22:54] worship Satan. Nobody in this room is.
[1:22:57] But we follow Satan's commandments.
[1:23:02] The guy
[1:23:05] maybe didn't charge you for something at
[1:23:08] the store that's in your cart and you
[1:23:11] just let it go
[1:23:13] because you got something for free and
[1:23:15] you just pushed the card out knowing
[1:23:16] that he didn't charge you.
[1:23:19] you give in to Satan. A business owner
[1:23:23] charges maybe an old lady a little bit
[1:23:24] more because she's an easy target.
[1:23:27] Dishonest people, friends, almost never
[1:23:29] have money.
[1:23:31] Satan never comes through for you. He
[1:23:33] will never He might give you the
[1:23:35] opportunity to sin, to say take
[1:23:38] something that's not yours,
[1:23:41] but you will never prosper for it. He
[1:23:44] hates you. You might get something for
[1:23:47] free. You might be one of those people
[1:23:49] that sues everybody or that the the am
[1:23:52] with the ambulance chasing lawyers, but
[1:23:54] you'll notice those people never
[1:23:56] prosper.
[1:23:58] They never have anything. Dishonest
[1:24:00] people almost never have money and Satan
[1:24:03] never comes through for them. And here
[1:24:04] Jesus is and he's saying, "Listen, I
[1:24:07] will give you whatever." He's telling
[1:24:10] Jesus, "I will give you whatever you
[1:24:12] want. I'll give you more money. I'll
[1:24:15] give you this. I'll give you that.
[1:24:18] if you will just bow down to me. And how
[1:24:21] do we bow down to Satan? As I said,
[1:24:23] nobody in their right mind is going to
[1:24:24] worship Satan, but you bow down and do
[1:24:27] what he says. You follow his
[1:24:29] commandments rather than the
[1:24:30] commandments of God. This happens all
[1:24:33] the time.
[1:24:34] And here Jesus says, then Jesus saith
[1:24:37] unto him, get thee hence, Satan, for it
[1:24:39] is written, thou shalt worship the Lord
[1:24:41] God, and and him only shalt thou serve.
[1:24:44] Jesus is again quoting Deuteronomy
[1:24:46] chapter 6.
[1:24:48] Then verse number verse number 11. Then
[1:24:52] the devil leaveth leaveth him and behold
[1:24:55] the angels came and ministered to him.
[1:24:58] The NIV in the English Standard Version
[1:25:01] say in Luke chapter 4 say this. When the
[1:25:04] devil had finished all of this tempting,
[1:25:07] he left him until an opportune time.
[1:25:11] So, you may overcome Satan as Jesus did
[1:25:14] here, but Satan doesn't go too far.
[1:25:19] He's looking for another time to get
[1:25:22] you. He's looking for another weakness
[1:25:25] he can exploit in you. And here he is
[1:25:27] with Jesus. And Jesus had conquered him.
[1:25:30] Jesus had won. He He didn't He didn't
[1:25:33] create the bread. He didn't jump off the
[1:25:34] temple. He didn't. And he also didn't
[1:25:37] give in and worship and give in to Satan
[1:25:39] with with the world, but then Satan just
[1:25:43] backs off for a little while. Don't
[1:25:46] think when you overcome it, when you win
[1:25:49] a battle, that he's not there to fight
[1:25:52] you again. And he was with Jesus. You
[1:25:55] think he wasn't there when Jesus was on
[1:25:56] the cross? You think he wasn't there
[1:25:59] fighting Jesus and all of these crazy
[1:26:01] things that went on during his ministry?
[1:26:03] He was there. He's just looking for an
[1:26:06] opportune time. So to recap this, when
[1:26:10] Jesus was in the wilderness,
[1:26:15] he was fighting Satan.
[1:26:18] Satan brought him up to the top of the
[1:26:22] temple and he says, "Cast yourself
[1:26:24] down." Maybe Satan wanted him to commit
[1:26:26] suicide.
[1:26:28] Maybe Satan wanted him to exalt himself.
[1:26:32] He brings him up to the top of the
[1:26:34] mountain and he says, "Look at all this.
[1:26:36] I'll give you all of this if you'll just
[1:26:38] worship me." And it's easy
[1:26:41] just to worship Satan by doing what he
[1:26:43] says by following his commandments
[1:26:46] rather than God's commandments. And here
[1:26:49] Jesus overcomes this and he wins this
[1:26:54] battle. And as I said, Jesus is the one
[1:26:57] that did it. And when we get to the
[1:26:59] sermon on the mount in the next couple
[1:27:00] weeks,
[1:27:02] he he didn't just preach it. He had
[1:27:05] already lived it.
[1:27:07] That was the beginning of his ministry.
[1:27:09] Now, as we move into the baptismal
[1:27:10] service, I want to I want to tell you
[1:27:12] what Jesus said at the end of his
[1:27:14] ministry, and the worship team can come.
[1:27:17] So, we have at the beginning of his
[1:27:18] ministry, we see he was baptized, and he
[1:27:21] fought with Satan, and then he's going
[1:27:23] to go and he's going to start preaching.
[1:27:25] Now Jesus goes through his three and a
[1:27:28] half years of ministry. He gets
[1:27:30] crucified. He dies. He's in the tomb and
[1:27:33] he's resurrected
[1:27:35] and he comes in and he gives this
[1:27:37] commandment
[1:27:39] to the people.
[1:27:41] After he's resurrected, this is the
[1:27:44] thing that he says. Matthew 28 verse
[1:27:46] number 19.
[1:27:48] Now listen to this Johnny. This is Jesus
[1:27:51] talking.
[1:27:52] This is the glorifi. This is the
[1:27:54] resurrected Jesus Christ. This is the
[1:27:57] one that came out of the tomb. He says
[1:28:00] this, "And Jesus came and spoke to them,
[1:28:04] saying, all authority has been given to
[1:28:06] me in heaven and in earth.
[1:28:10] Go therefore
[1:28:13] and make disciples of all nations." What
[1:28:16] does that mean? Go therefore and make
[1:28:19] disciples of all nations. He's not
[1:28:21] saying go therefore and try to get
[1:28:23] members of your church. He's not saying
[1:28:25] go therefore and try to get members of
[1:28:27] your denomination. He is saying go
[1:28:29] therefore and make disciples. Disciples
[1:28:32] to who?
[1:28:34] To Christ.
[1:28:36] That's what we stand for.
[1:28:39] His disciples to Jesus Christ. This man
[1:28:42] that actually did it.
[1:28:45] Now, how do we know? You throw out the
[1:28:48] net. You live the life. You preach the
[1:28:50] gospel. You do everything that you can.
[1:28:52] And then you say now here it is. You
[1:28:56] become a disciple like I have become a
[1:28:59] disciple. And then what happens? It goes
[1:29:01] from witnessing to that person to
[1:29:03] preaching to that person to giving that
[1:29:06] person the word of God. And now that
[1:29:08] person has something to do.
[1:29:15] Baptizing them in the name of the father
[1:29:17] and of the son and of the holy spirit.
[1:29:20] Now that person takes wants to take on
[1:29:24] that name of Jesus Christ. That person
[1:29:27] wants now to be associated with God. And
[1:29:29] that's what baptism is. It is going out
[1:29:32] in front of the people and saying my
[1:29:35] life has changed. Now I want to be a
[1:29:38] Christian. I want to be a disciple of
[1:29:40] Jesus Christ. I want to be that man.
[1:29:44] I want my name
[1:29:48] associated with him.
[1:29:52] And when the disciples
[1:29:54] when they baptized,
[1:29:58] they baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:30:00] Christ.
[1:30:02] What does that mean?
[1:30:04] Making disciples.
[1:30:06] The greatest thing I believe the first
[1:30:09] time they were ever called this was was
[1:30:11] at this place called Antioch.
[1:30:13] They were called a Christian.
[1:30:17] Christ.
[1:30:18] Followers of Christ. Christian. I want
[1:30:21] to take on that name in baptism.
[1:30:25] Teaching them to observe all things that
[1:30:28] I have commanded you. Jesus speaking
[1:30:32] that I have commanded you. And then he
[1:30:34] says this. Listen to this Johnny. This
[1:30:37] is the best thing in the world right
[1:30:39] here that I'm about to read.
[1:30:43] He says,
[1:30:45] "Teaching them." Let's put up Matthew
[1:30:46] 28:19 if you could.
[1:30:50] 2020. Yes. 28:20. Thank you. Teaching
[1:30:53] them to observe all things that I have
[1:30:55] commanded you. Now listen to this. And
[1:30:58] lo,
[1:30:59] I am with you always,
[1:31:05] even to the end of the age.
[1:31:08] Only a resurrected son of God could say
[1:31:11] that.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Only God in flesh could say that. That
[1:31:17] lo I am with you always. And that is a
[1:31:23] promise to anyone who wants to be
[1:31:26] baptized in this name of Jesus Christ,
[1:31:29] who wants to take on this name, who
[1:31:31] wants to be part of Jesus. He made a
[1:31:34] promise. Lo, I am with you always. In
[1:31:36] Acts chapter 2, the disciples were where
[1:31:39] where Peter was preaching. He says,
[1:31:41] "Repent every one of you. Go back from
[1:31:44] your sins. Change." As I was saying at
[1:31:48] the beginning, you can repent. You can
[1:31:50] change. And then let it go. Let your
[1:31:53] sins go. They're done. They're finished.
[1:31:55] They're over. God's not going to make
[1:31:56] you answer for those sins twice. You
[1:31:58] have changed.
[1:32:02] Repent every one of you and be baptized
[1:32:04] in the name of Jesus Christ. Put up Acts
[1:32:06] 2:38 if you could. Repent every one of
[1:32:08] you and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:32:11] Christ for
[1:32:14] the taking away, for the remission of
[1:32:17] your sins.
[1:32:18] If you take on this name of Jesus, your
[1:32:22] sins are forgiven and they are gone. The
[1:32:25] devil will bring them back. He'll keep
[1:32:26] throwing them at you. That's that's what
[1:32:27] he does. Leave him there.
[1:32:30] But you accept Jesus Christ and you are
[1:32:35] baptized for the remission of your sins,
[1:32:39] for the taking away of your sins. And
[1:32:42] then remember the promise that Jesus
[1:32:43] said, I said, "I will be with you
[1:32:45] always." Watch how Peter says it. Acts,
[1:32:49] go back to 238.
[1:32:51] Watch how Peter says it. And you shall
[1:32:56] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[1:32:59] Jesus said, "Lo, I am with you always."
[1:33:02] Peter says, "You'll receive the gift of
[1:33:04] the Holy Ghost." There it is. Jesus
[1:33:06] Christ, a promise dwelling within that
[1:33:09] person.
[1:33:10] How important is baptism?
[1:33:13] How important is taking on that name of
[1:33:15] the Lord? It's vital. It's vital. Amen.
[1:33:20] Brother Johnny, you still want to be
[1:33:22] baptized? Praise God. Go back and see
[1:33:25] see the deacons back there. and anyone
[1:33:28] else. You're welcome. Yes, my brother.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Justin.
[1:33:34] Um, so here's one of the things with
[1:33:36] Johnny Justin.
[1:33:41] He gave me the wrong name at first and
[1:33:44] then he told me, "Pastor, I just want
[1:33:46] you to know my name is really Justin."
[1:33:48] Justin's a good name.
[1:33:51] Justice. It's a soul that's coming to
[1:33:53] the Lord. God bless you, brothers and
[1:33:55] sisters. Anyone else want to be
[1:33:58] baptized? It's a good time to do it.
[1:34:01] Take on that name of the Lord. Jesus
[1:34:04] commanded to be baptized
[1:34:08] in that name. And then he says, "I'll be
[1:34:11] with you always." And he will. Then
[1:34:14] Peter said, "Who's going to be with us
[1:34:15] always? You'll receive the gift of the
[1:34:18] Holy Ghost." And then I didn't read the
[1:34:20] next one that they put up, Acts 2:39,
[1:34:22] that says, "And this promise is to you
[1:34:25] and to your children and to them that
[1:34:28] are far off, even as many as the Lord
[1:34:29] our God shall call." Amen. God bless
[1:34:32] you, Daniel.
[1:34:37] All throughout my history,
[1:34:44] your faithfulness
[1:34:47] has walked beside me.
[1:34:53] The winter storms make way for spring.

[1:41:25] can forone.

[1:41:44] God bless you everyone.
[1:41:46] Brother Justin
[1:41:49] wanted to read this scripture before
[1:41:50] he's baptized.
[1:41:59] Um, hi, I'm Justin Galino. Yesterday, I
[1:42:01] prayed to God that I would hear about
[1:42:04] Jesus's temptation and
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; wow.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Forgive me if I uh if I cry.
[1:42:20] Um this is a ro Romans 14:8. For if we
[1:42:24] live for the Lord
[1:42:26] for if we live, we live to for the Lord.
[1:42:29] And if we die, we die for the Lord. So
[1:42:32] then whether we live or die, we belong
[1:42:35] to the Lord.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:39] Praise the Lord. What a scripture. And
[1:42:42] let me tell you, there's been a change
[1:42:45] in this young man,
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; an incredible change.
[1:42:50] And the Lord,
[1:42:52] he is a mighty God.
[1:42:55] And one thing about God, we know that
[1:42:57] he's mighty. We know he's up there, but
[1:42:59] he's also very, very kind, very loving,
[1:43:03] and very caring. And he's been had his
[1:43:06] hand on Justin
[1:43:10] for a while. I remember witnessing to
[1:43:11] him out here. And there was something
[1:43:14] about him. This young man wanted to hear
[1:43:17] more about the word.
[1:43:19] And I don't know what's happened. Well,
[1:43:21] I do want I know what's happened.
[1:43:23] Something's happened. And it's been
[1:43:25] good. And to see now that I'm baptizing
[1:43:29] him in the name of the Lord is just it's
[1:43:32] amazing. And then that testimony that he
[1:43:34] was praying that the Lord would would
[1:43:36] allow
[1:43:37] him to hear something about the
[1:43:39] temptation of Jesus. Of course, he had
[1:43:43] God had a plan, but we didn't have a
[1:43:44] plan.
[1:44:02] put the old
[1:44:04] and come back up
[1:44:07] there.
[1:44:13] By your own confession, I baptize you in
[1:44:17] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:44:20] [Applause]
[1:44:40] two,
[1:44:42] another young lady, her mother has been
[1:44:46] a real blessing to us. And I know that
[1:44:49] many of you know Zyra.
[1:44:52] And this is her precious little girl.
[1:44:56] And Zyra comes to our She's back here.
[1:45:00] Zyra comes to our Bible studies and she
[1:45:02] attends church here. And your mama,
[1:45:06] sweetheart, has the sweetest spirit. And
[1:45:08] I can tell that you take after your mom.
[1:45:10] What's your name?
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Naomi.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Say it louder.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Naomi.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Her name is Naomi. And when I said,
[1:45:17] "Does anyone else want to be baptized?"
[1:45:19] This little girl jumped up and started
[1:45:21] waving her hand.
[1:45:23] [Applause]
[1:45:38] Naomi
[1:45:41] confession
[1:45:43] by your own confession I baptize you in
[1:45:46] the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:45:50] [Applause]
[1:46:00] Let's all stand
[1:46:05] friends. Let's bow our heads.
[1:46:10] Our great and mighty God.
[1:46:14] Lord, to think of the temptations
[1:46:18] that Jesus Christ went through,
[1:46:22] Father, how he was led
[1:46:25] out into the wilderness to go through
[1:46:27] this this horrible time.
[1:46:30] But, Father, you had something in store.
[1:46:35] And then
[1:46:38] Lord, the ministry that followed after
[1:46:40] that temptation
[1:46:42] and we are a witness today of the
[1:46:44] ministry
[1:46:46] that Jesus gave to the world.
[1:46:50] And Lord, I stand in this water
[1:46:54] that represents the grave.
[1:46:58] Lord, to think that
[1:47:03] Lord, you went to the grave for us.
[1:47:08] That Christ suffered on the cross for
[1:47:10] us.
[1:47:13] That Barabbus, the murderer, and the
[1:47:14] thief
[1:47:17] was released
[1:47:20] because of the love of Jesus Christ.
[1:47:23] Lord, to think that you did this for us.
[1:47:27] Now Lord, as these two souls that came
[1:47:29] for baptism, I also want to dedicate my
[1:47:32] life to say that Lord, thank you for
[1:47:35] what you've done.
[1:47:37] Thank you for the temptation
[1:47:40] that you went through. Thank you for all
[1:47:42] that, Father, that you endured for me,
[1:47:45] for my sins. Lord, I will never forget
[1:47:48] the sins that that put you on the cross.
[1:47:50] And I will always remember them as a
[1:47:52] thanksgiving offering to you that Lord I
[1:47:56] was once dead but now I am alive because
[1:47:59] of Jesus Christ.
[1:48:01] We thank you Lord.
[1:48:04] We love you
[1:48:06] and Father we give you our lives aresh
[1:48:10] in that name above all names of Jesus
[1:48:13] Christ.
[1:48:15] Amen and amen. God bless you brothers
[1:48:18] and sisters. Let's sing a song of
[1:48:20] worship and then Daniel if you could
