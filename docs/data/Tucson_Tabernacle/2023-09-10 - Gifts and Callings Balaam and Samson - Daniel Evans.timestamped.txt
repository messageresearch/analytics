[44:41] our father that each soul that is here
[44:45] we pray Lord that you would deal with
[44:47] each one
[44:49] and Lord God that if there would be a
[44:51] question on the heart of someone
[44:54] Lord something that someone needs a
[44:56] request that they would have father I
[44:58] pray that you would granted
[45:00] father May the peace of Jesus Christ
[45:03] rest upon each one present here
[45:07] in Jesus name
[45:09] amen
[45:10] before I have you seated I'd like to
[45:12] read from Romans the 11th chapter
[45:24] may seem
[45:26] like a familiar verse
[45:32] but I believe it's going to
[45:35] this service is going to mean a lot to
[45:37] us
[45:38] Romans chapter 11 verse 25.
[45:43] it says this
[45:45] for I would not brethren
[45:50] that ye should be ignorant of this
[45:52] mystery
[45:55] lest you should be wise in your own
[45:57] conceits that the blindness in part has
[45:59] happened to Israel unto the fullness of
[46:01] the Gentiles become in
[46:04] the Apostle Paul right here is talking
[46:05] about the Gentile dispensation that
[46:07] started two thousand years ago and it is
[46:10] ending
[46:11] very soon
[46:15] and so all Israel shall be saved that is
[46:17] is written there shall come out of Zion
[46:20] out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn
[46:23] away ungodliness from Jacob
[46:26] for this is my Covenant unto them
[46:29] when I shall take away their sins
[46:32] as concerning the gospel
[46:35] they are enemies for your sakes but as
[46:37] touching the election they are beloved
[46:39] for the father's sakes
[46:41] he's speaking of the Jewish people
[46:45] now listen to this for the gifts and
[46:48] calling of God are without repentance
[46:51] what that means is almost every other
[46:54] translation says for the gifts and

[48:00] last Sunday
[48:02] I talked about
[48:03] this man Samson and I I gave a uh just a
[48:08] whirlwind overview of this man Samson's
[48:10] life
[48:12] and I'd like to go back
[48:16] to Samson
[48:18] and thinking about these this scripture
[48:21] that these gifts and callings are
[48:23] irrevocable and think about these gifts
[48:25] that Samson had in his life and I want
[48:27] to compare them to another man
[48:29] that's in the Bible and his name is
[48:31] Balaam
[48:32] so Samson
[48:34] I'll review a little bit from last
[48:37] week's Samson
[48:39] had this gift in his life he had made a
[48:42] vow in his his vow was never to cut his
[48:44] hair
[48:45] and he knew that from the prophecy of
[48:48] the angel that his strength was was in
[48:51] his long hair and if he was to cut this
[48:54] hair he would break that Covenant with
[48:56] God and he would lose his strength and
[48:59] we went through last week about how
[49:01] powerful this man Samson was and how he
[49:03] sought an occasion to fight against this
[49:06] evil empire that was controlling Israel
[49:09] at that time called the Philistines
[49:11] very evil people idolaters very
[49:14] heavy-handed as far as their
[49:16] treatment of Israel and Samson God
[49:20] raised up this man Samson to judge we
[49:24] the Bible says judge it or Israel but
[49:27] it's actually to be a leader to be a
[49:29] protector of Israel of this country and
[49:33] to fight off
[49:34] these Philistines and to keep them from
[49:37] hurting God's people Israel so Samson
[49:41] was successful in many of his battles he
[49:44] was never unsuccessful and
[49:46] then
[49:49] the Philistines are upset they make a
[49:51] deal
[49:52] with the people that they are ruling
[49:54] over with the with the people of Israel
[49:57] and they say Deliver Us Samson and we're
[50:00] going to come in and we're going to make
[50:02] your life very very difficult
[50:04] so the people of Israel were afraid so
[50:08] they came to Samson
[50:10] now remember Samson's gift wasn't
[50:13] against his own people
[50:14] it was against the Philistines
[50:17] so when they came to Samson Samson
[50:21] says listen he says but just make sure
[50:23] you don't kill me
[50:26] because his gift as I said he it wasn't
[50:28] powerful against his own people he's
[50:30] powerful against these other people they
[50:32] said no that's fine so they bound him
[50:34] his hands and they they took him and
[50:36] they delivered him to the Philistines
[50:38] out in this field
[50:40] and the they they leave him there and
[50:43] then Samson sees out in the distance he
[50:47] sees just hundreds and hundreds of
[50:51] philistine Warriors coming to get him
[50:54] Samson the spirit of the Lord Came Upon
[50:57] Samson salmon Sampson breaks his binds
[51:00] he looks down and there's the skeleton
[51:03] of a donkey out in the field
[51:05] he picks up the Jawbone
[51:08] from this donkey and he starts wailing
[51:12] on these Philistines and ends up killing
[51:15] a thousand of them every one
[51:18] anointed of the Lord a powerful anointed
[51:22] anointing that was on this man Samson
[51:25] so as all the Philistines they're all
[51:27] laying around he piles them all up up in
[51:29] a in a heap and and he ends up naming
[51:32] the mountain Jawbone Hill
[51:36] it's a great name I wonder if it's still
[51:38] named that
[51:39] so then
[51:42] he's tired the anointing leaves him
[51:45] and
[51:46] he gets thirsty and it shows you how
[51:51] fragile our lives are
[51:52] no matter how much anointing we have no
[51:54] matter how much of power we'll have when
[51:56] we operate outside of that anointing
[51:59] then we are completely just dependent on
[52:02] the Lord
[52:03] so Samson sits down he's dying of thirst
[52:06] and and he he says Lord you made this
[52:09] great Victory he said he says I'm dying
[52:11] of thirst and then God opens up
[52:14] spring
[52:15] and then Samson drinks from the spring
[52:18] the the a miracle another miracle of God
[52:21] so we see that this man Samson when he's
[52:24] operating in this anointing how powerful
[52:27] that Samson was so then Samson the Bible
[52:31] says
[52:32] that Samson judges Israel for the space
[52:35] of about 20 years so he's Israel's
[52:37] protector for this 20 years
[52:40] then
[52:43] in judges
[52:44] 16. and I'm just I'm just going to read
[52:47] it
[52:49] um
[52:51] this is the Bible
[52:53] judges 16 chapter 1 says this
[52:56] then went Samson to Gaza
[52:59] and saw there a harlot and went in unto
[53:02] her
[53:03] remember Samson's weakness
[53:05] was worldly what we would call not
[53:09] Christian girls
[53:11] and it was told the Gazette saying
[53:14] Samson has come hither and they
[53:16] compassed him in and laid weight for him
[53:19] all night in the gate of the city
[53:21] and require it all the nights saying in
[53:23] the morning when it is day we shall kill
[53:26] him
[53:28] and Samson lay until midnight
[53:31] and arose at midnight and took the doors
[53:34] of the gate of the city
[53:36] and the two posts and went away with
[53:40] them bar and all and picked them up on
[53:43] his shoulders and carried them up to the
[53:46] top of the hill
[53:47] that is before Hebron
[53:49] and it came to pass afterwards that he
[53:52] loved a woman in the valley of sork
[53:54] whose name was Delilah
[53:57] you know this the story there
[53:59] and what happened was Samson had the
[54:03] anointing again Came Upon Samson
[54:05] remember it was it was his gift was
[54:06] against the Philistines he came to this
[54:08] gate they were going to trap him in the
[54:09] city and he picked up this gate
[54:12] superhuman strength throws it on his
[54:14] shoulders walks up to the top of a hill
[54:16] near another city and sits down
[54:21] and as I was pondering on that scripture
[54:27] I was
[54:28] thinking Lord
[54:30] Samson
[54:32] what did he do the night before
[54:35] what I just read
[54:38] and yet you honored him
[54:42] in such a way
[54:44] that he would be able to pick up this
[54:47] gate and Escape these these assassins
[54:50] that were coming to kill him
[54:52] and he had just spent the whole night in
[54:55] sin
[54:57] I thought
[54:58] Lord
[54:59] Lord how how could how could that be and
[55:03] then that scripture that I ca that I
[55:06] just read came to mind that the gifts
[55:08] and the calling of God are irrevocable
[55:13] so if you have a gift that God has given
[55:16] you
[55:18] that gift you can use it for the Lord
[55:22] as Samson did with his gift with his
[55:24] hair and destroying Philistines or you
[55:28] can use it for yourself
[55:30] or you can use it for Satan to serve the
[55:33] enemy
[55:35] so Samson here it didn't matter what he
[55:38] was doing he was sinning he was he was
[55:40] doing all had all these problems but yet
[55:42] he still had that gift
[55:44] by the promise of God he didn't take it
[55:47] away from him
[55:49] Samson was
[55:51] lived his whole life
[55:54] with that gift and you'll notice at the
[55:57] end of his life when he meets this this
[56:01] girl that's gonna eventually lead him to
[56:04] his death named Delilah
[56:07] when he meets this girl he didn't want
[56:11] to cut his hair
[56:13] he still wanted to keep that vow between
[56:16] him and the Lord
[56:17] he was tricked into doing it
[56:21] so then Samson's hairs cut
[56:23] he goes the the uh he's he's gets bound
[56:27] they take a prisoner they gouge out his
[56:30] eyes
[56:32] and he's blind and they're they're
[56:34] rejoicing over this great warrior that's
[56:36] killed so many of the Philistines and
[56:38] all these idolaters they're thinking oh
[56:39] great we have killed this man we've
[56:42] taken this man's Samson
[56:44] um captive and we we have triumphed over
[56:47] to him and then they want to bring
[56:49] Samson out and they want to show
[56:51] everybody how powerful we are
[56:54] and they bring Samson he's bound
[56:57] they take him to the stadium
[57:00] they put them between the two pillars
[57:03] and in Samson's death
[57:07] that gift
[57:09] he lost his hair
[57:11] his hair the gift began to come back
[57:15] he put his hands
[57:17] on the two pillars he bowed himself he
[57:20] pushed the pillars apart the whole
[57:23] stadium that they were in came down upon
[57:26] Samson killed him and 3 000 Philistines
[57:30] remember his commission his commission
[57:32] was to kill Philistines
[57:35] three thousand of them he killed in his
[57:37] death so in his death
[57:39] he killed more than in all of his life
[57:43] but you notice that gift never that
[57:45] Covenant never left Samson that gift
[57:47] never left Samson unless he did the one
[57:51] thing that prevented him from using that
[57:53] gift which was cut his hair
[57:57] and his weakness
[57:59] was with
[58:01] women
[58:02] and I and I see that
[58:05] oh a big part of the problem
[58:08] that is in our youth and in people today
[58:12] is they get yoked up with the wrong man
[58:15] or the wrong woman
[58:17] and it causes problems it causes it'll
[58:22] ruin your life
[58:23] and I talked about that last week and I
[58:25] want to just reiterate that to be
[58:27] careful
[58:29] of who you marry of who you date because
[58:31] when you open that door you may never be
[58:35] able to recover
[58:38] you may forsake that happiness that the
[58:41] Lord promised you because you made you
[58:43] made this choice in life
[58:46] so Samson went through and eventually
[58:49] his demise was caused from
[58:53] this girl
[58:54] that he met
[58:56] and uh that betrayed him
[59:00] and
[59:01] as I was reading that I thought that
[59:03] there was another man
[59:05] hundreds of years earlier
[59:08] that also had a gift probably a gift
[59:10] greater than Samson's
[59:13] and it ended up in the same way
[59:16] and that's this man
[59:19] Balaam
[59:21] now
[59:22] who Balaam was
[59:25] he was a very one of the most gifted
[59:29] people that I have read about in this
[59:33] book
[59:34] it was just an incredible man
[59:37] So what had happened is
[59:40] Moses now let's go back hundreds of
[59:43] years from Samson and now we're going to
[59:45] get into Moses Moses had come out of
[59:47] Egypt they were wandering around in the
[59:49] desert for about 40 years and they get
[59:51] to this place
[59:53] that's full of these people called the
[59:55] amorites they get to this country so
[59:58] Moses and and the people of Israel they
[1:00:00] send a message to the king of the
[1:00:01] amorites and they say Hey listen we want
[1:00:04] to just walk through your country
[1:00:06] we won't eat your food
[1:00:09] we won't take anything we just want to
[1:00:12] walk along the highway we won't even
[1:00:14] drink your water
[1:00:16] just let us go now there was
[1:00:18] between one and two million of these
[1:00:21] people
[1:00:22] so the the king of the amorites his name
[1:00:25] I believe was cyhon he looks down and he
[1:00:27] sees all of these people he's like
[1:00:29] you're not coming through my country no
[1:00:31] way you'll eat all my food and do all
[1:00:33] this and even though they said no no
[1:00:34] we're not going to do that we just want
[1:00:36] to walk through
[1:00:37] so what saihan does is he said okay he
[1:00:40] sends an army down
[1:00:42] to kill Israel
[1:00:44] so
[1:00:46] Israel is
[1:00:48] they defend themselves and they laid
[1:00:52] waste to this entire country these
[1:00:56] people came down to attack Israel God
[1:00:59] was with Israel it was Battle after
[1:01:01] battle win after win after win they
[1:01:03] started killing them taking cities
[1:01:05] burning the cities everything everything
[1:01:07] just went Moses's way
[1:01:10] conquered the whole country
[1:01:14] so then there's this other guy
[1:01:17] there's this other king and they're
[1:01:19] headed north or they're headed this way
[1:01:23] and that is Moab
[1:01:25] so this king of Moab
[1:01:28] he's looking down maybe he gets up on a
[1:01:31] mountain and he sees all the
[1:01:33] City's burning in his neighboring
[1:01:35] country
[1:01:36] and he's like oh
[1:01:38] and here the spies come
[1:01:41] into Moab
[1:01:43] and their Moab is going to be the next
[1:01:46] place that these people of Israel go
[1:01:48] through
[1:01:50] so this King his name is balak balak
[1:01:53] looks down and he sees and he sees wow
[1:01:55] he says God is with these people
[1:01:58] now he's got his own God he's like wow
[1:02:01] my God doesn't even do anything
[1:02:03] but they're God's real their God
[1:02:05] actually he actually does stuff he
[1:02:06] actually fights for them my God is uh
[1:02:09] well he's just a statue basically
[1:02:12] when I pray to him nothing really
[1:02:14] happens he's just it's a piece of wood
[1:02:16] there and that's what they were
[1:02:19] worshiping but he sees this God
[1:02:21] they call them Jehovah
[1:02:24] wow he actually does stuff
[1:02:29] and he must have seen he must have
[1:02:30] looked down and maybe saw that Pillar of
[1:02:33] Fire at night
[1:02:34] leading these Hebrews maybe that pillar
[1:02:37] of cloud in the day down there like I
[1:02:42] can't I can't compete with this God so
[1:02:44] what I need to do is I need to get this
[1:02:47] God that's leading those people I need
[1:02:49] to get them on my side
[1:02:52] and then he can curse them
[1:02:56] so how do you do that if you're a
[1:02:58] heathen
[1:03:00] what's the best way to do it huh
[1:03:04] you know pay him off
[1:03:06] because that's that's the way that's the
[1:03:08] way you think that's the way you get
[1:03:09] your way as a king
[1:03:11] so
[1:03:12] he starts looking and he says well
[1:03:14] there's this prophet of God that
[1:03:17] actually knows that Hebrew God this
[1:03:19] Jehovah
[1:03:21] and this man is a very Gifted Man I'll
[1:03:24] get a hold of him and then he can
[1:03:26] convince this God to curse these people
[1:03:29] of Israel
[1:03:31] because whatever this man blesses
[1:03:36] is blessed and whatever this man curses
[1:03:39] is cursed that man's name was Balaam
[1:03:42] great powerful prophet of God
[1:03:47] so he knew he had he had heard all this
[1:03:49] about this man Balaam
[1:03:51] so he gets he sends people
[1:03:55] over
[1:03:57] to Balaam
[1:03:59] and
[1:04:01] they have their money
[1:04:04] let's go to uh
[1:04:08] numbers
[1:04:09] chapter 22 we'll start with verse 7.
[1:04:13] sorry Brothers I've messed you up twice
[1:04:14] on my scriptures
[1:04:16] Numbers 22 7.
[1:04:19] so what he does is he sends these people
[1:04:21] over to this man named Balaam on behalf
[1:04:24] of balak so balak sends his people over
[1:04:26] there
[1:04:27] we're on the same page and it says this
[1:04:31] and the Elders of Moab and the Elders of
[1:04:33] Midian departed with the rewards of
[1:04:35] Divination in their hand
[1:04:38] some some
[1:04:40] translations call it sooth saying
[1:04:43] others call it uh
[1:04:46] um it was it was like witchcraft
[1:04:48] so basically
[1:04:50] this man Balaam also had the reputation
[1:04:54] of practicing
[1:04:58] idolatry type stuff
[1:05:02] so the elements of Moab and the Elders
[1:05:04] of Midian departed with the rewards of
[1:05:06] Divination in their hand and they came
[1:05:08] unto Balaam and spake unto him the words
[1:05:10] of balak
[1:05:13] and he said unto them
[1:05:15] Lodge here this night and I will bring
[1:05:18] you word again as the Lord shall speak
[1:05:20] unto me and the princes of Moab Abode
[1:05:23] with Balaam
[1:05:26] now Balaam had faith
[1:05:28] that Jehovah was going to speak back to
[1:05:31] him when he went before God remember he
[1:05:34] was A Gifted Man no matter how many
[1:05:36] problems that he had God had still given
[1:05:39] him that gift honest or not
[1:05:41] a lover of filthy money or not Balaam
[1:05:44] was still a very gifted prophet
[1:05:47] and God came unto Balaam and said what
[1:05:50] men are these with thee
[1:05:53] right there and God came unto Balaam
[1:06:00] imagine
[1:06:02] you got over here who knows how many 50
[1:06:05] miles maybe or less you have this group
[1:06:07] of a couple million people and God would
[1:06:10] just come to Moses and a little bit to
[1:06:13] Aaron
[1:06:14] and it was such a rare thing that God
[1:06:16] would show himself this man Balaam was
[1:06:19] so gifted God just came down and spoke
[1:06:21] to him
[1:06:24] God came to Balaam and said what men are
[1:06:26] these with thee and Balaam said unto God
[1:06:29] balach the son of zippor King of Moab
[1:06:31] hath sent unto me saying behold there is
[1:06:35] a people come out of Egypt with which
[1:06:37] covereth the face of the earth now come
[1:06:39] curse me them pair adventure adventure I
[1:06:43] shall be able to overcome them and drive
[1:06:45] them out
[1:06:46] and God said unto Balaam
[1:06:49] Thou shalt not go with them remember
[1:06:53] that
[1:06:54] and God said unto Balaam Thou shalt not
[1:06:57] go with them Thou shalt not curse the
[1:06:59] people for they are blessed
[1:07:01] and then Balaam goes back to the
[1:07:03] messengers and tells them what God told
[1:07:04] them and he refers refuses to curse
[1:07:07] Israel The Messengers go back to balak
[1:07:12] so the king sends more respected
[1:07:14] Messengers now
[1:07:16] to Balaam
[1:07:18] Balaam had a weakness
[1:07:20] so now the king he sends these princes
[1:07:23] with a lot more money and a lot more
[1:07:25] power and they come to Balaam and they
[1:07:28] made Balaam a much better offer
[1:07:31] basically they came to Balaam and said
[1:07:33] hey you can have whatever you want
[1:07:35] just curse this People Israel
[1:07:38] Balaam had already been told no by God
[1:07:41] remember what I said before God said
[1:07:43] don't do it
[1:07:44] so Balaam sees the money and you see
[1:07:46] right now you see his weakness
[1:07:49] and he's like wow I can have that
[1:07:52] uh I would like um maybe I'll ask God
[1:07:55] again
[1:07:56] because I I really want it I really and
[1:07:59] he's thinking in his mind he's making
[1:08:00] excuses he's justifying himself and how
[1:08:03] many times have we been in that position
[1:08:05] where we will maybe feel a leading of
[1:08:08] God but we are get we have over here the
[1:08:11] hope of something that we really want
[1:08:14] and you've all seen it I've seen it
[1:08:17] we've probably all done it we make an
[1:08:18] excuse to why we can have what we want
[1:08:22] skip to verse 18.
[1:08:26] and Bala answered and said well first of
[1:08:28] all Balaam goes back and he goes before
[1:08:30] the Lord
[1:08:31] and Balaam answered and said unto the
[1:08:33] Servants of balak if balak would give me
[1:08:35] his house full of silver and gold I
[1:08:38] cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my
[1:08:40] God to do less or more
[1:08:42] sounds pretty good doesn't he
[1:08:44] man this Balaam sounds like an all right
[1:08:46] type of guy he sounds like a real real
[1:08:49] prophet in the Old Testament way
[1:08:52] but let me tell you he was an absolutely
[1:08:55] evil man which we will get to in a
[1:08:58] little bit
[1:08:59] God had already told him no
[1:09:02] Balaam came back and asked again do you
[1:09:04] think God changed his mind
[1:09:07] well Balaam yeah I guess since they're
[1:09:09] going to double your money yeah that's a
[1:09:11] good idea
[1:09:13] maybe I was wrong about that no God is
[1:09:15] right every time he's Sovereign he was
[1:09:17] right he said don't go the first time so
[1:09:19] here's Balaam he says well
[1:09:22] are you sure
[1:09:25] I'll skip to verse 22.
[1:09:29] now Balaam
[1:09:31] God tells Balaam
[1:09:34] he says okay
[1:09:35] go
[1:09:36] but only do what I tell you
[1:09:40] so then Balaam says okay good so he he
[1:09:42] gets on his donkey and he goes
[1:09:45] and God's anger was kindled against
[1:09:48] Balaam because he went
[1:09:50] God had just told him go ahead
[1:09:53] and then God's God's anger is kindled
[1:09:56] against Balaam because he went
[1:09:58] but he should have known he God had
[1:10:00] already told him don't go
[1:10:02] so he's riding this donkey
[1:10:06] thank you
[1:10:07] and God's anger was kindled against him
[1:10:10] because he went and the angel of the
[1:10:11] Lord stood in the way for an adversary
[1:10:13] against him now he was riding upon his
[1:10:16] ass and his two servants were with him
[1:10:18] so he's writing on this donkey
[1:10:22] and this donkey
[1:10:25] you know I love the Bible
[1:10:27] the the Bible is just it's it's a
[1:10:30] tremendous book and there's some things
[1:10:33] in the Bible that when you read him
[1:10:35] you're like
[1:10:36] well I never thought that was going to
[1:10:37] happen
[1:10:39] so what's happening is balaam's riding
[1:10:42] this donkey
[1:10:43] and this donkey sees they're in a little
[1:10:47] tight Corridor maybe like between these
[1:10:49] two rows of pews here and they're riding
[1:10:52] along the donkey sees the angel of the
[1:10:54] Lord there standing with the sword
[1:10:57] and he the donkey's like oh
[1:11:00] and Balaam doesn't see it probably
[1:11:02] because he was thinking about the money
[1:11:04] maybe thinking about what he was getting
[1:11:05] so balaam's kicking the donkey and the
[1:11:07] poor little guy he's he's like no way if
[1:11:09] I go there I'm gonna die so he's he's
[1:11:12] trying to he's trying to protect himself
[1:11:14] and he's trying to protect the guy
[1:11:15] that's riding on him and he like leans
[1:11:17] up against the wall and smashes balon's
[1:11:21] foot and Balaam is upset so he starts
[1:11:23] beating the Donkey
[1:11:28] and then the donkey talks
[1:11:33] he did
[1:11:37] it's the oddest thing
[1:11:40] and the donkey is basically like
[1:11:43] hey haven't I been a good donkey to you
[1:11:46] I've served you I've I've I've I've I've
[1:11:49] been a I've been a good I've been a good
[1:11:51] servant I've taken you I've carried you
[1:11:54] and balaam's like if I had a sword I'd
[1:11:56] kill you right now you won't do what I
[1:11:59] say
[1:12:00] it makes me think
[1:12:03] more about my pets
[1:12:07] you know I remember my dog one time I
[1:12:10] was riding my mower
[1:12:12] and
[1:12:14] this is back in Jeffersonville it's
[1:12:15] where we mow grass and I was riding the
[1:12:17] mower
[1:12:19] and this little rabbit
[1:12:22] runs out of this hole
[1:12:25] and I see the rabbit take off and we had
[1:12:29] this dog that was 150 pounds which is
[1:12:32] what's called a greater Swiss mountain
[1:12:33] dog she looks like a Saint Bernard and
[1:12:35] we had a vinyl fence you know with the
[1:12:37] pickets
[1:12:38] and the the fence was was more of a
[1:12:42] deterrence to the dog and not a barrier
[1:12:45] so this rabbit comes running out
[1:12:48] and my dog plows through the fence runs
[1:12:52] and grabs the rabbit
[1:12:55] and I jumped off the mower and I started
[1:12:58] chasing her name is Lady
[1:13:00] um
[1:13:00] she didn't live up to her to her name
[1:13:03] so she's running with the rabbit in her
[1:13:06] mouth and I'm chasing her I'm yelling at
[1:13:07] her and if I could have caught her I'd
[1:13:08] have beat her to death and and she's got
[1:13:11] these two t these two legs sticking out
[1:13:13] her mouth
[1:13:14] and she's running and I'm chasing her
[1:13:16] and she got the thing down
[1:13:18] before I could catch her
[1:13:21] oh you stupid dog and upset and I was as
[1:13:25] I was reading this story even this
[1:13:27] morning I was like
[1:13:29] that donkey talked to Balaam I'd like to
[1:13:32] have a conversation with my dog
[1:13:36] later on when we get to heaven and and
[1:13:39] then we understand more
[1:13:41] but here this donkey is
[1:13:43] and
[1:13:46] finally
[1:13:49] God opens the eyes
[1:13:51] of this man and he sees the angel of the
[1:13:55] Lord there and the angel of the Lord
[1:13:57] says listen basically the only reason
[1:13:58] you're alive is because of that donkey
[1:14:01] so Balaam repents
[1:14:04] the angel of the Lord says keep going do
[1:14:06] what you're going to do
[1:14:08] but
[1:14:11] only do what I tell you to do
[1:14:15] so we go to chapter 23
[1:14:20] verse 1 and Balaam said so Balaam gets
[1:14:23] to the king and Balaam said
[1:14:26] under balak build me here seven altars
[1:14:29] and prepare me hear seven oxen and seven
[1:14:32] Rams and Balaam did as Balaam had spoken
[1:14:34] and balak and Balaam offered on every
[1:14:37] altar of Bullock and a ram exactly the
[1:14:42] same
[1:14:43] as the Israelites would offer unto
[1:14:47] Jehovah
[1:14:48] you see the gift
[1:14:50] coming out in Bala
[1:14:52] verse number five and the Lord put a
[1:14:55] word in balaam's mouth
[1:14:57] and said return unto balach and thus
[1:15:00] shall thou thus Thou shalt speak
[1:15:04] and he returned unto him and lo he stood
[1:15:06] by his burnt sacrifice he and all the
[1:15:08] princes of Moab and he took up his
[1:15:10] Parable and said balak the king of Moab
[1:15:13] hath brought me from amram out of the
[1:15:16] mountains of the East saying come curse
[1:15:19] me Jacob Jacob is Israel
[1:15:22] and come and defy Israel
[1:15:26] how shall I curse whom God has not
[1:15:29] cursed or how shall I defy whom whom the
[1:15:32] Lord hath not defied from the top of the
[1:15:34] Rocks I see him and from the hills I
[1:15:36] Behold Him and lo the people shall dwell
[1:15:38] alone and shall not be reckoned among
[1:15:40] the Nations who can count the dust of
[1:15:43] Jacob and the number of the fourth part
[1:15:45] of Israel let me die
[1:15:48] the death of righteousness and let my
[1:15:51] last in be like his
[1:15:54] so here's Balaam saying his his prayer
[1:15:57] is is I want to be like Israel
[1:16:02] on and on
[1:16:06] balak
[1:16:07] ass Balaam
[1:16:10] to curse Israel
[1:16:12] two more times he goes and he offers a
[1:16:15] burnt offering the same thing he keeps
[1:16:17] blessing him even towards Balaam even
[1:16:20] prophesied of the coming Messiah
[1:16:24] amazing this man Balaam
[1:16:28] and he keeps asking God and God keeps
[1:16:31] giving him the answer and he keeps
[1:16:32] coming back to balak and he keeps saying
[1:16:34] no he keeps blessing Israel and Bale
[1:16:37] acts like I'm getting so sick and tired
[1:16:39] of this
[1:16:40] he says here one more time let's do this
[1:16:43] again
[1:16:45] just don't bless him
[1:16:49] and then He blesses them again
[1:16:53] so
[1:16:54] we go through these few chapters
[1:16:59] of
[1:17:00] balak the king of Moab and Balaam this
[1:17:05] prophet and every time he's offering him
[1:17:07] money and every time balaam's operating
[1:17:10] within his gift
[1:17:12] his prophetic gift and he goes and he
[1:17:15] sets up an altar he does exactly what
[1:17:16] God requires and he comes back God
[1:17:18] speaks to him and he comes back and he
[1:17:20] says no don't do it God will bless
[1:17:24] Israel
[1:17:26] and balak
[1:17:29] is he gets upset balen gets upset and
[1:17:33] they go their way
[1:17:35] separate
[1:17:37] now
[1:17:39] something happens
[1:17:42] between the end of chapter 24
[1:17:46] and chapter 25
[1:17:48] here in the Book of Numbers that's not
[1:17:51] recorded in numbers
[1:17:53] but it is recorded elsewhere in the New
[1:17:56] Testament
[1:17:57] it's amazing to me
[1:17:59] sometime how
[1:18:01] these these brothers that wrote the New
[1:18:03] Testament
[1:18:04] how they knew these details
[1:18:07] that aren't recorded in the Bible that
[1:18:10] we have I don't know if it's a holy
[1:18:12] spirit that told them
[1:18:13] if it was the the oral tradition that
[1:18:16] come that came down but they knew
[1:18:21] and so something happens in here between
[1:18:23] 24 and 25 Balaam would not curse Israel
[1:18:29] balac needed it
[1:18:36] and things go south
[1:18:39] and
[1:18:41] I have to admit
[1:18:43] the hardest thing as a minister
[1:18:46] the hardest thing for me
[1:18:50] that as as I've been in the ministry is
[1:18:54] to see that the people won't change
[1:18:57] that the people won't change their lives
[1:18:59] no matter how much you get up here and
[1:19:01] you preach and you do your best you see
[1:19:04] the people and they're raising their
[1:19:06] children to make the same mistakes that
[1:19:08] they made
[1:19:10] they go in and they continue to make the
[1:19:12] same mistakes people gossiping and
[1:19:14] losing their tempers not making
[1:19:16] sacrifices for anyone other than
[1:19:18] themselves
[1:19:19] always putting themselves above everyone
[1:19:21] else
[1:19:23] not being generous
[1:19:27] sleeping around before they're married
[1:19:28] getting offended at every little thing
[1:19:31] you should never be offended
[1:19:33] we should never be offended at anything
[1:19:37] we should walk in the spirit of God but
[1:19:40] it continues to happen we should never
[1:19:43] criticize
[1:19:44] other people yet we continue to
[1:19:46] criticize
[1:19:49] and it's
[1:19:51] the same thing with this man Balaam he
[1:19:55] was gonna do what he was going to do
[1:19:59] and I see that spirit so much in US
[1:20:01] I'm gonna do it
[1:20:03] it doesn't matter if I know that it's
[1:20:05] right I'm going to come up with an
[1:20:07] excuse I am going to get my way
[1:20:13] and that was this man Balaam
[1:20:16] so what did he do between chapter 24 and
[1:20:18] chapter 25.
[1:20:23] let's go to Second Peter let's go over
[1:20:24] the New Testament let's go to Second
[1:20:26] Peter chapter 2.
[1:20:30] it's a mystery what happens between
[1:20:33] these two chapters
[1:20:36] Peter
[1:20:38] speaking second Peter chapter 2 verse
[1:20:41] 12.
[1:20:42] Peter speaking he says this
[1:20:45] but these
[1:20:48] As Natural brute beasts
[1:20:57] but these As Natural brute beasts made
[1:20:59] to be taken and destroyed speak evil of
[1:21:01] the things that they understand not and
[1:21:04] shall utterly perish in their own
[1:21:05] corruption and shall receive the reward
[1:21:07] of unrighteousness as they counted
[1:21:09] pleasure to Riot in the daytime spots
[1:21:12] they are in blemishes sporting
[1:21:13] themselves with their own deceivings
[1:21:15] while they Feast with you having eyes
[1:21:17] full of adultery
[1:21:22] and cannot cease from sin beguiling
[1:21:25] unstable Souls
[1:21:29] listen closely
[1:21:31] beguiling unstable Souls a heart they
[1:21:35] have exercised with Covetous practices
[1:21:37] cursed children which have forsaken the
[1:21:41] right way
[1:21:42] and are gone astray following the way of
[1:21:45] Balaam
[1:21:47] the son of bosor who loved the wages of
[1:21:52] unrighteousness
[1:21:54] but was rebuked for his iniquity the
[1:21:57] dumb ass speaking with a man's voice
[1:21:58] forbade The Madness of the Prophet these
[1:22:01] are wells without water clouds that are
[1:22:04] carried with a tempest To Whom The Mist
[1:22:06] Of Darkness is reserved forever Balaam
[1:22:09] did something really bad here
[1:22:12] Jude
[1:22:14] verse 10.
[1:22:16] says this
[1:22:18] but these
[1:22:20] Jude 10. these but these speak evil of
[1:22:24] those things which they know not
[1:22:28] but what they know naturally as brute
[1:22:31] beasts in those things they corrupt
[1:22:33] themselves woe unto them for they have
[1:22:36] gone in the way of Cain and ran greedily
[1:22:39] after the era of Balaam for reward and
[1:22:41] perished in the gang saying gang sayings
[1:22:43] of Korra
[1:22:45] the Bible rarely speaks so strongly
[1:22:48] against an individual but it is speaking
[1:22:51] very strongly against this man Balaam
[1:22:53] what did he do was it because he did
[1:22:56] something that God told him not to do
[1:22:58] was it because he loved money
[1:23:01] the answer is in the Book of Revelation
[1:23:04] chapter 2.
[1:23:07] now listen to this
[1:23:08] here's what happened between these two
[1:23:11] chapters in numbers
[1:23:13] Revelation chapter 2 verse 14.
[1:23:18] but I have a few things against thee
[1:23:22] because thou Hast
[1:23:23] there them that hold the doctrine of
[1:23:26] Balaam
[1:23:28] who taught balak the king who taught
[1:23:32] balak to cast a stumbling block before
[1:23:34] the children of Israel to eat things
[1:23:37] sacrificed to idols and to commit
[1:23:39] fornication so hast thou also them that
[1:23:42] hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans
[1:23:44] which thing I hate
[1:23:49] we see it over and over
[1:23:51] when the answer is no they keep trying
[1:23:54] to come back and get what they want
[1:23:57] they want money they want popularity
[1:23:58] they want respect they want a position
[1:24:00] when God's answer is no and it remains
[1:24:03] no but then God will allow it to happen
[1:24:06] people are going to get their way
[1:24:12] but as a Christian friends we need to
[1:24:16] surrender ourselves to God surrender our
[1:24:18] desires and say Lord I want to put you
[1:24:21] first and not make a excuse why I can
[1:24:24] have what I want
[1:24:27] if the word says don't do it then don't
[1:24:31] do it
[1:24:33] but we want our way
[1:24:35] so you know what Balaam did
[1:24:38] according to Revelation chapter 2
[1:24:41] so Balaam goes his way
[1:24:43] as was as we saw in numbers and then
[1:24:48] he says well if God won't curse them
[1:24:51] I know a way to bring a curse upon them
[1:24:55] so he teaches them to start he teaches
[1:24:58] the young people to start sleeping
[1:25:01] around with these Moab people and start
[1:25:05] mixing and start and start
[1:25:07] having problems so they come in they
[1:25:10] start having these problems then they
[1:25:12] mess up their lives and then brings
[1:25:14] God's curses down upon them
[1:25:18] Balaam knew
[1:25:20] he was gonna get his way and he got it
[1:25:22] and he will go down in history as being
[1:25:25] one of the worst people that's written
[1:25:27] in the book because
[1:25:29] as gifted as he was
[1:25:32] because he wanted his way
[1:25:37] look at the difference between him and
[1:25:39] Samson
[1:25:40] Samson
[1:25:42] was given a gift and he used that gift
[1:25:46] for the Lord Balaam was given a gift and
[1:25:48] he used that for himself
[1:25:51] he used it for Satan Numbers chapter 25
[1:25:54] verse 1.
[1:25:58] in Israel Abode and shoot him
[1:26:00] and the people began to commit whoredom
[1:26:02] with the daughters of Moab
[1:26:04] there it is between the two chapters
[1:26:07] and they called the people into
[1:26:09] Sacrament under the sacrifices of their
[1:26:11] gods and the people did eat and bowed
[1:26:13] down to their gods and Israel joined
[1:26:15] himself to bail pior
[1:26:17] and the anger of the Lord was kindled
[1:26:20] against Israel
[1:26:24] so what does this have to do with us
[1:26:27] obviously the most obvious thing is be
[1:26:30] careful
[1:26:30] be careful who you yoke yourself up with
[1:26:33] but also be careful who you are
[1:26:36] following
[1:26:38] be careful who you are listening to
[1:26:41] because if you start if you if we
[1:26:44] followed Balaam Balaam would have
[1:26:46] brought us to destruction
[1:26:49] there was a prophet there Moses that
[1:26:51] said follow What God Says and then
[1:26:53] here's his Prophet Balaam that keeps
[1:26:55] coming back to God and saying as gifted
[1:26:57] as he was saying I want more I want this
[1:27:01] money I want to serve myself and yet he
[1:27:04] operated in that gift powerfully as
[1:27:06] powerfully as any Prophet almost in the
[1:27:08] Bible
[1:27:10] operating that because God those gifts
[1:27:13] and the callings they're irrevocable God
[1:27:15] didn't take them away
[1:27:17] he was born with those gifts
[1:27:21] listen to this listen to what brother
[1:27:23] Branham says here
[1:27:27] spiritual food in due season brother
[1:27:28] Branham says this
[1:27:30] he says we find that when a man comes
[1:27:33] sent from God ordained of God with the
[1:27:37] truth thus saith the Lord the messenger
[1:27:40] the message and the messenger are one
[1:27:43] and the same
[1:27:44] because he is sent to represent thus
[1:27:47] saith the Lord word by word
[1:27:50] so he and his message
[1:27:52] are the same
[1:27:54] a denominational man under
[1:27:55] denominational auspices he and the
[1:27:58] church is one
[1:28:00] a Theo Theologian under theology made by
[1:28:02] the same
[1:28:04] made some denomination he and his
[1:28:06] message are won Church of theology a
[1:28:08] theologian
[1:28:11] so
[1:28:12] what brother Branham is saying here is
[1:28:14] you can't separate
[1:28:16] a man
[1:28:18] from his message
[1:28:20] because that's always going to be
[1:28:22] influenced so if you if you look at me
[1:28:23] and you look at the way I preach if I'm
[1:28:26] living a filthy life behind this pulpit
[1:28:29] it's going to come out
[1:28:33] you can't separate me from my life
[1:28:36] you can't separate me from the message
[1:28:38] that I preach
[1:28:40] even as gifted as some people are
[1:28:43] and they may bring they may prophesy in
[1:28:45] God's name they may show discernment
[1:28:47] they may show Power like Balaam did they
[1:28:50] won't be as great as Balaam he was he
[1:28:52] was awesomely powerful but they may show
[1:28:55] that they may tell you what you're
[1:28:56] thinking they may they may uh give a
[1:28:59] prophecy over you and yet live a filthy
[1:29:01] life behind that
[1:29:03] you think that that's not going to come
[1:29:05] out in their Ministry
[1:29:06] it will
[1:29:08] we have to judge those things we have to
[1:29:11] be careful who we are listening to and
[1:29:14] who we are following no matter how
[1:29:15] gifted the man is
[1:29:17] there's a man that I used to listen to I
[1:29:20] was just a big fan
[1:29:22] of this guy
[1:29:24] on YouTube he was one of the best
[1:29:26] theologians
[1:29:28] that um I won't say his name because I
[1:29:30] don't want to I don't want to disrespect
[1:29:32] him
[1:29:34] um but uh he's dead now
[1:29:37] but one of the best theologians I've
[1:29:39] ever heard one of the most powerful men
[1:29:41] in answering questions he would have
[1:29:43] groups of thousands of people atheists
[1:29:46] or whatever and they would ask him
[1:29:48] questions and he would answer and right
[1:29:52] off the top of his head he had always
[1:29:53] had the scriptures and he was so kind
[1:29:55] and it just had such a gift one of the
[1:29:58] greatest gifts I have ever seen in a man
[1:30:00] in his command his handling of the
[1:30:03] scriptures was this man
[1:30:07] and
[1:30:09] I would I would watch him and I thought
[1:30:11] wow he is really really good
[1:30:15] gifted
[1:30:17] incredibly gifted
[1:30:20] and then
[1:30:22] find out not too long ago maybe a couple
[1:30:25] years ago maybe one year or two years
[1:30:26] ago
[1:30:28] that he was using his authority
[1:30:33] he was using his popularity to seduce
[1:30:37] young women
[1:30:40] and have relations with them behind the
[1:30:43] scenes
[1:30:44] as gifted as he was
[1:30:48] what an awful person
[1:30:50] but yet you watch him wow
[1:30:54] he was amazing in his ministry
[1:30:58] the reason I am saying that is to warn
[1:31:01] all of us
[1:31:03] be careful who you are listening to even
[1:31:07] though they may have a great gift in
[1:31:09] their lives
[1:31:10] watch their lives
[1:31:13] Watch What Happens and don't get caught
[1:31:15] up into that because that Ministry
[1:31:18] behind the scenes it will eventually
[1:31:22] come out right here
[1:31:25] you may never see it
[1:31:28] but it comes out you live a dirty life
[1:31:32] behind the scenes you're going to have a
[1:31:35] dirty message here in front of the
[1:31:36] pulpit
[1:31:38] no matter how gifted you are just like
[1:31:40] this man Balaam
[1:31:43] and how much problems he caused Israel
[1:31:50] Israel Israel hundreds of them died
[1:31:53] there's plagues that came down because
[1:31:55] they followed this man balaam's teaching
[1:31:58] as gifted as he was
[1:32:01] that's what I want to get across to the
[1:32:04] people today
[1:32:06] be careful
[1:32:09] always be careful who you are listening
[1:32:12] to judge all things I know everybody
[1:32:15] else says or you can't judge me well
[1:32:17] that's usually because you want to sin
[1:32:18] and and and you know you don't want
[1:32:21] anybody saying what that's that's that
[1:32:23] but let me tell you you judge this
[1:32:25] pulpit
[1:32:27] First Corinthians First Corinthians
[1:32:29] First Corinthians says a righteous man
[1:32:32] judges all things
[1:32:34] so judge you don't judge someone's
[1:32:38] salvation but but what is coming forth
[1:32:41] from the pulpit judge those things
[1:32:44] and the people that are bringing them
[1:32:47] be careful no matter how gifted a man or
[1:32:51] a woman might be
[1:32:53] careful because these examples are
[1:32:57] warnings that's why Balaam has mentioned
[1:32:59] so many times in the scriptures is a
[1:33:02] warning don't follow somebody like that
[1:33:07] and I hope that I the scriptures that I
[1:33:09] read show you how powerful and how
[1:33:12] gifted he was
[1:33:13] probably more gifted than anybody that
[1:33:16] you meet
[1:33:17] and yet
[1:33:19] still anointed by the enemy to lead
[1:33:22] Souls away
[1:33:24] if the
[1:33:26] musicians would come to close
[1:33:31] imagine
[1:33:34] this Gifted Man Balaam
[1:33:38] bringing these amazing messages
[1:33:43] that were that came from God
[1:33:45] and yet being anointed by the enemy yet
[1:33:49] wanting to serve himself
[1:33:51] gifts and callings are without
[1:33:53] repentance gifts and callings are
[1:33:55] irrevocable and for you each one of you
[1:33:58] if God gave you a gift
[1:34:01] maybe it's to sing maybe it's a musician
[1:34:04] maybe it's with business maybe whatever
[1:34:06] it is what are you using that gift for
[1:34:10] are you using it to serve God
[1:34:14] are you using to serve God's people
[1:34:17] are you using it
[1:34:20] to Serve Yourself
[1:34:22] that's a that's a bold question
[1:34:26] and I hope that everyone's thinking Lord
[1:34:28] Am I who am I like am I like this man
[1:34:31] Balaam
[1:34:33] that will take whatever gifts God has
[1:34:35] given me and I want to draw attention to
[1:34:37] myself I want to be something or I want
[1:34:40] to be a a rich or some successful person
[1:34:44] or some successful singer or whatever it
[1:34:47] is or Lord do I want to give my gift
[1:34:50] like Samson did do I want to give my
[1:34:53] gift to you
[1:34:56] I want to give my gift if I have any
[1:34:59] and all of us do I want to give it to
[1:35:01] God
[1:35:04] the best thing
[1:35:06] that I can do
[1:35:09] as a minister as a pastor the best thing
[1:35:13] that I can do is not to point you to
[1:35:17] what I say
[1:35:20] the best thing that I can do is to point
[1:35:22] you to Jesus Christ
[1:35:25] I can't lead anyone
[1:35:28] to Salvation
[1:35:29] neither can you
[1:35:31] but I can lead you to Christ
[1:35:34] and he can get you to Salvation
[1:35:37] that is everything that is the role of
[1:35:40] the ministry
[1:35:41] to get the people to the Lord Jesus
[1:35:45] Christ not to do to some gift
[1:35:48] not to some man
[1:35:50] not to some fleshly sinful person
[1:35:55] but to Christ who didn't sin it all
[1:35:58] the story of Jesus
[1:36:02] Jesus
[1:36:04] came to Earth as a man
[1:36:07] because God made flesh
[1:36:09] he came to Earth as a man
[1:36:13] so that God
[1:36:16] could
[1:36:18] save his people before it was a it was
[1:36:21] it was a sacrificing a lamb or whatever
[1:36:24] whatever kind of animal now he had to
[1:36:27] have something perfect that could take
[1:36:28] the sins of the world away so Jesus
[1:36:31] Christ comes down and he says I will
[1:36:34] take your sins upon myself
[1:36:38] I'll do it
[1:36:40] the one person that has never sinned
[1:36:44] he said I'll take the sins
[1:36:46] so he became sounds bad he became a
[1:36:49] thief
[1:36:50] for us because other people did it
[1:36:53] and their sins came on him he became
[1:36:56] someone that cheats on their husband or
[1:36:57] cheats on their wife
[1:36:59] Jesus lowered himself to that at the
[1:37:03] cross he never did it
[1:37:06] but he took on that sin
[1:37:08] for himself everything I have ever done
[1:37:10] brother Jeremy every sin I've ever
[1:37:12] committed I just dumped right on Jesus
[1:37:15] and he says I'll take it
[1:37:17] it's mine
[1:37:17] [Music]
[1:37:19] how dare me
[1:37:21] ever
[1:37:23] think that I'm worth anything
[1:37:26] or that I'm important or whatever
[1:37:28] whatever it might be
[1:37:30] the man that died on that cross is
[1:37:32] important
[1:37:33] not us
[1:37:35] everything goes back to him
[1:37:39] but there this world
[1:37:41] it wouldn't be
[1:37:43] in this book if it wasn't important and
[1:37:46] it wouldn't have made such a prominent
[1:37:50] part of the Bible the story of Balaam if
[1:37:53] we weren't to know it and we weren't to
[1:37:56] be aware
[1:37:57] and these apostles were
[1:38:01] Jesus speaking to
[1:38:04] John the Revelator on the Isle of Patmos
[1:38:08] Peter
[1:38:09] recording the Deeds of Balaam
[1:38:13] telling us be careful watch these
[1:38:15] deceivers
[1:38:18] but if we can come to Christ
[1:38:21] God Made A Way
[1:38:23] for us to come to the Lord Jesus and I
[1:38:25] would I would encourage you if you there
[1:38:28] is something on your heart that wants to
[1:38:30] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:38:32] Jesus
[1:38:33] Peter commanded he they said Lord they
[1:38:36] said how can we be saved
[1:38:40] they were touched in their heart by what
[1:38:42] the minister said
[1:38:44] Peter said repent
[1:38:47] go back from your sins
[1:38:50] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:38:52] Christ
[1:38:55] for the remission the taking away of
[1:38:58] your sins
[1:39:00] that's it
[1:39:02] another place it says be baptized and
[1:39:05] wash your sins away
[1:39:07] not that going down in the water washes
[1:39:10] them away
[1:39:11] but the blood of Jesus Christ does and
[1:39:13] you make that commitment I serve you
[1:39:16] know we have one to be baptized am I
[1:39:18] right brother
[1:39:19] we have one is there anyone else
[1:39:22] that would like to be baptized

[1:39:26] um brother if you can if you want to
[1:39:28] take take them back here
[1:39:30] brother Lyle if you could show show

[2:00:28] glory to God Amen
[2:00:32] just maybe sit in few seconds
[2:00:39] nothing is done by
[2:00:41] it's not a chance that we come to church
[2:00:44] today
[2:00:45] it's not a chance that we are living
[2:00:47] today
[2:00:49] um
[2:00:50] we are living in the end time
[2:00:53] I'm so glad that God is doing I see that
[2:00:56] a lot of people are coming to be
[2:00:58] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:01:00] Christ
[2:01:01] I'm so glad of that thank God for that
[2:01:07] but my brothers and sisters
[2:01:10] um when we come to baptize
[2:01:13] we come to take a stand for Christ
[2:01:16] as Israel they were in Egypt they were
[2:01:19] not the Church of God
[2:01:22] until they come out of Egypt
[2:01:24] they were the people of God they are the
[2:01:27] promise of God but they were not the
[2:01:29] Church of God until they separated
[2:01:32] themselves from Egypt it's the same way
[2:01:36] we are by the grace of God justification
[2:01:40] the Lord Jesus Christ that died for all
[2:01:42] of us for all human beings
[2:01:45] every human beings who are living is a
[2:01:48] is a potential Sons and Daughters of God
[2:01:50] until they accept Jesus Christ that's
[2:01:54] the way of salvation
[2:01:56] they are in the world the lord died for
[2:01:58] them
[2:01:59] but when they come and accept him as a
[2:02:02] savior
[2:02:03] is the Lord calls us for his total
[2:02:06] separation from sin from all unbelief
[2:02:10] so it's great that we are baptized in
[2:02:13] his name but if we not take any sin we
[2:02:15] are not called his church
[2:02:17] so we are his church when we take a
[2:02:20] stand for Christ we separate ourselves
[2:02:22] from all our unbeliefs all the all the
[2:02:25] ungodly ways we have to that God called
[2:02:29] for a total separation from unbelief
[2:02:33] so it's great that we take a stand we
[2:02:36] accept the Lord what he done for us but
[2:02:40] what are we doing with our lives
[2:02:42] what kind of stand are we taking in this
[2:02:44] end time
[2:02:45] that's the question
[2:02:48] so this is my that's what the Lord has
[2:02:51] put on my heart and I was amazed that
[2:02:54] the body called me to pray because I
[2:02:56] said Lord if you put I will not be
[2:02:58] ashamed to testify of what
[2:03:00] you've put in my heart
[2:03:02] so brothers and sisters we need we need
[2:03:06] to stay up with ourselves from sin and
[2:03:08] we are not the Church of the Living God
[2:03:11] until we still take a step to step with
[2:03:15] ourselves from all unbelief we cannot be
[2:03:18] living the way we used to live
[2:03:21] that's why we come to the course we take
[2:03:24] the course before me the World Behind Me
[2:03:27] we have to take a total separation from
[2:03:29] unbelief that's my that is my
[2:03:31] exhortation to your church this morning
[2:03:35] let us stand to pray
[2:03:40] God we thank you
[2:03:42] for what you are doing in this end time
[2:03:45] you died for us
[2:03:47] oh Lord there's that you have given us
[2:03:51] Grace
[2:03:52] us human beings oh God especially
[2:03:56] Gentiles we're totally we're we are
[2:03:59] walking in darkness worshiping idols but
[2:04:02] by the cause dear God you have blinded
[2:04:06] Israel the Jews so that we can enter
[2:04:09] beware because before we were dogs we
[2:04:13] were not considered we didn't have any
[2:04:15] part of salvation but by the blood of
[2:04:18] Jesus Christ because they rejected you
[2:04:21] so that we can come in Heavenly Father
[2:04:23] help us not to take it lightly God help
[2:04:26] us not to to just take the blood and and
[2:04:31] say that we are named Christians but our
[2:04:33] lives is different or from being a
[2:04:36] Christian or God help us to take our
[2:04:38] course because you say take up your
[2:04:40] course and follow me oh it was to take
[2:04:43] our course the sacrifice oh as your

[2:05:06] remission of our sins would you have
[2:05:08] done it for all you don't have to do
[2:05:10] anything there's no works that can save
[2:05:12] us oh but what you have done for us on
[2:05:15] Calvary and also you have called for a
[2:05:18] Sanctified life dear God you cannot be
[2:05:21] using us you can we cannot be a a
