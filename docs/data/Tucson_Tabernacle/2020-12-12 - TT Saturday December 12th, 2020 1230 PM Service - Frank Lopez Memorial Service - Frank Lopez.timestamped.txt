[26:32] here with family with friends
[26:36] and sometimes we never think we would
[26:38] see a day like this
[26:41] but the day comes for each one of us so
[26:42] our hearts must be ready
[26:45] so before we get started let me just go
[26:47] over a couple of things
[26:49] due to the the covid issue and we're
[26:52] going to ask
[26:52] that you be as careful as possible
[26:56] in everything you do and once the
[26:57] service is over
[26:59] we want to exit the church and go
[27:01] outside as quickly as possible
[27:03] and not spend a lot of time inside the
[27:06] house
[27:07] uh of the church of god here uh we've
[27:10] seen it happen for a few families and
[27:12] and people have come down ill with that
[27:13] so
[27:14] let's not do that and um please honor
[27:17] that we don't do it you know
[27:18] in any way to restrict you but just just
[27:20] for safety so
[27:23] if we'll stand and let's open this
[27:25] service in prayer
[27:29] just as we start lord as we start this
[27:32] this afternoon in memory of of one who
[27:36] loved you and you loved our brother
[27:37] frank lopez and his family and friends
[27:39] here
[27:40] talk about the good things the grace of
[27:42] god in the mercy of god lord
[27:44] share our experiences share our hearts
[27:47] lord
[27:48] may you be pleased and honored in all
[27:50] things lord may your comfort
[27:53] cover and take care of each one we ask
[27:55] in jesus name
[27:56] amen you may be seated
[28:01] as we we thought about this and
[28:06] and heard he had passed away a couple
[28:08] days before he passed away
[28:11] the lopez family got a hold of me and
[28:13] asked if
[28:14] me and my dad could go visit them at the
[28:16] house
[28:17] on wednesday and it brought back a lot
[28:20] of memories
[28:22] used to go to the house there brother
[28:25] frank would tell me and my brother be
[28:26] here at six o'clock in the morning
[28:29] so we can get started work bright and
[28:31] early
[28:33] and after a couple of weeks i realized i
[28:35] didn't have to get there till about
[28:36] seven
[28:38] but we came at six anyways and brother
[28:41] frank would say i gotta go wake up
[28:42] frankie and johnny
[28:45] and he said if you don't mind go ahead
[28:46] and load the tools on the truck and get
[28:48] the trailer hooked up
[28:50] and so if it was good we got about 7 30.
[28:54] that became the work day of the week
[28:59] and then it was go go go go go
[29:02] i was 16 years old when we first came
[29:05] and they were
[29:06] he was my first employer brother frank
[29:09] and one of the last things that we did
[29:11] together him and
[29:12] his son frankie came and they put a new
[29:14] roof on our house
[29:16] he went up the ladder carried all the
[29:18] tools right up had no problems with it
[29:21] and i said lord i hope when i get that
[29:23] age i can still do that too
[29:26] but you know he was a child of god first
[29:29] and above all i saw him be a man
[29:33] i saw him be tried by his two boys
[29:36] pretty hard
[29:38] they would stay far enough away from dad
[29:40] where he couldn't reach them
[29:42] and they would stand there holding the
[29:43] broom not wanting to move too much but
[29:46] that's okay
[29:47] he loved him anyways johnny reminded me
[29:50] of a time
[29:53] that brother frank was chasing one of
[29:55] them with the broom
[29:57] and somebody stopped and he saw it and
[29:59] he and he rolled down the window and he
[30:01] said to them him he says
[30:03] you know that's child abuse and frank
[30:05] picked up the
[30:06] room he said if you don't get going
[30:07] you're going to get it next
[30:09] so the man drove away but you know
[30:14] i'm glad that god had mercy on us when i
[30:16] didn't behave
[30:18] he might have tweaked my ears some but
[30:19] his love and his mercy and
[30:21] he loved his children he loved his
[30:23] family and you know it's
[30:25] it's the grace of god if you'll stand
[30:28] let's sing that song
[30:29] amazing grace how sweet this sound
[30:33] when somebody tells you when you've done
[30:35] wrong and you failed and they say i
[30:36] forgive you
[30:38] and they mean it with all their heart
[30:40] that is grace
[30:41] undeserving but they forgive you anyways
[30:52] [Music]
[31:02] like me
[31:07] i once was lost
[31:12] but now i am
[31:15] found i was blind but
[31:20] now i see
[31:24] [Music]
[31:27] twas grace
[31:32] my heart to
[31:35] fear and embrace
[31:40] my fears
[31:47] how precious did
[31:52] that grace
[32:00] [Music]
[32:18] i have already
[32:29] grace that brought
[32:32] me safe
[32:38] and grace will be
[32:42] me now here's hope for every one of us
[32:45] here
[32:47] when we've been there
[32:52] ten thousand
[32:57] [Music]
[33:02] the sun
[33:07] we know
[33:12] to sing god's grace
[33:17] and when we first
[33:26] you may be seated i just want to share a
[33:28] couple of scriptures
[33:31] and then after that the eulogy by frank
[33:34] lopez the third here so
[33:36] psalms 116. we'll read a few scriptures
[33:40] out of there
[33:41] the word of god is true it is faithful
[33:45] and it accomplishes what it says so
[33:48] starting with verse
[33:51] i love the lord because he has heard my
[33:54] voice and my supplications
[33:57] because he has inclined his ear unto me
[33:59] wherefore i will call upon him
[34:01] as long as i live and
[34:04] as i thought about brother frank and
[34:06] knowing the family and all for some time
[34:10] you guys would have a different view
[34:11] than i would have because you were with
[34:13] him all the time
[34:14] saw him all the time but as i was
[34:16] thinking about some scriptures this came
[34:18] to my mind
[34:20] because he has inclined his ear unto me
[34:22] therefore will i call upon him as long
[34:24] as i live
[34:26] the sorrows of death compassed me and
[34:29] the pains of hell get upon me
[34:31] and i found trouble and sorrow and as a
[34:34] human
[34:34] you have those times in life those times
[34:37] and
[34:37] but god has a promise then i called upon
[34:40] the name of the lord i said oh lord
[34:43] i beseech thee deliver my soul
[34:46] gracious is lord and righteous yea
[34:49] our god is merciful
[34:52] and i like this translation the lord is
[34:55] full of grace
[34:56] and righteousness truly he is a god of
[34:59] mercy
[35:01] return unto thy rest o my soul
[35:04] for the lord hath dealt bountiful with
[35:07] thee
[35:08] or come back to your rest o my soul for
[35:10] the lord has given you
[35:12] your reward for thou has delivered my
[35:15] soul from
[35:16] death mine eyes from tears and my feet
[35:18] from falling
[35:20] you have taken my soul from the power of
[35:22] death keeping my eyes from weeping
[35:24] and my free feet from failing if you
[35:27] could see dad right now
[35:28] and husband and uncle and a dear brother
[35:32] the young man that he would be about 21
[35:34] years old
[35:35] he would tell you it's worth every bit
[35:38] of it amen
[35:38] there's no question about that
[35:42] what shall i render unto the lord for
[35:44] all his benefits
[35:45] towards me what may i give to the lord
[35:48] for all the good things which he has
[35:49] done for me
[35:51] if if brother frank could recount some
[35:53] of those
[35:54] they would far outweigh the sorrows and
[35:57] the hard times
[35:58] it's worth it all i will take the cup of
[36:01] salvation and call upon the name of the
[36:03] lord
[36:04] i will pay my vows unto the lord now in
[36:06] the presence
[36:07] of his people and today
[36:11] we would talk of his memory but i think
[36:14] if he would say
[36:15] one thing to all of you it's been worth
[36:18] serving god
[36:19] my life giving him my life as a young
[36:21] man
[36:22] and then this was a scripture that it
[36:24] spoke to me precious in the sight of the
[36:26] lord
[36:27] is the death of his saints as they come
[36:30] back home to be with him
[36:32] my dad met brother frank he told me in
[36:34] 1952.
[36:36] dad was about 16 and brother frank would
[36:39] have been about 20
[36:40] 21 years old back in california and the
[36:42] pentecostal church
[36:44] both young christians and
[36:47] and and he grew up that way part of the
[36:51] the when brother branham preached behind
[36:52] this pulpit in 1960
[36:55] sitting on that side of the church there
[36:56] was the sotelo family
[36:58] the lopez family the duron family
[37:02] who was the other the figaro family it
[37:05] was all part of that
[37:06] group there and and brother branham told
[37:10] brother stromey who was a good friend of
[37:12] his that while he was ministering the
[37:15] angel of the lord stood there and
[37:16] pointed to that group and said now this
[37:18] message
[37:19] is for them folks they will receive the
[37:22] grace of god
[37:23] we might have not understood and people
[37:25] may have not understood
[37:27] but god had you and his family in mind
[37:30] and he's never forsaken you he's never
[37:32] left you
[37:33] and in the time of of remembrance and
[37:36] the time of
[37:36] when things get hard and where's grandpa
[37:39] where's dad where's
[37:40] where's my husband remember god has it
[37:43] in his control
[37:45] and soon and very soon as a whole family
[37:49] will get to be together again so now is
[37:52] if
[37:52] um frankie jr or frankie iii
[37:56] would come up and do the eulogy and then
[38:00] followed by
[38:02] uh healing prayer from
[38:05] benjamin lopez's grandson thank you
[38:21] good morning and thank you for joining
[38:24] us today
[38:25] um my name is frank lopez iii and would
[38:28] like to say it is an honor to be up here
[38:30] to share to me and glimpse of an amazing
[38:33] person's story
[38:36] i would like to say everyone looks
[38:38] amazing
[38:40] so we are here to remember and celebrate
[38:41] the life of frank flores lopez senior
[38:44] an irreplaceable person that had a huge
[38:47] impact on so many people's lives
[38:52] so last week i've been thinking how do i
[38:54] sum up the life
[38:57] of someone who i thought so highly of
[38:58] and held in such high regard
[39:01] and let me tell you when you work for
[39:02] the post office you have a lot of time
[39:04] by yourself to think
[39:08] and i came to the conclusion i can stand
[39:10] up here for hours
[39:11] and just keep talking so i figure i just
[39:15] um show you what i came down to
[39:18] in the bible the book of genesis on the
[39:20] sixth day when god created a man
[39:22] verse 28 says god blessed them and said
[39:25] to them be fruitful and multiply a
[39:27] number
[39:28] fill the earth and subdue it rule over
[39:30] the fish and the sea
[39:31] and the birds in the sky
[39:34] and over every living creature that
[39:36] moves on this ground
[39:38] my nana and thought that did an amazing
[39:39] job at this by having
[39:41] 24 grandkids and 47
[39:44] great-grandkids how beautiful is that
[39:51] even though the grieving process is
[39:53] different for everyone and affects
[39:54] everyone differently
[39:56] i would like to say it's okay to cry
[39:58] it's okay to be sad
[40:00] upset or even a little angry but if you
[40:03] knew my thought that you would know that
[40:04] he had us to the kingdom of heaven a
[40:07] long time ago
[40:08] right and that this life was only
[40:10] temporary
[40:12] he would always say that his flesh was
[40:14] of this world
[40:15] but his soul would be in the kingdom of
[40:17] heaven with god
[40:24] but to the lopez family remember the
[40:26] same blood that goes through your veins
[40:27] is the same that went through our
[40:29] arthathos
[40:35] to some he was known as brother frank to
[40:37] some it was
[40:38] theo frank to my brothers sisters
[40:42] cousins nephews and nieces he was known
[40:44] as thothem
[40:47] and to select few they had been blessed
[40:49] with calling him dad
[40:51] regardless of what you may have called
[40:52] him or known him by you pretty much got
[40:55] the same true person
[40:56] every time he lived a long
[40:59] and humble and beautiful life so bear
[41:01] with me
[41:04] as i stand from up here to look out it's
[41:06] truly beautiful to see how many people's
[41:08] whose lives was touched in some way by
[41:10] him
[41:12] where there was that church praising god
[41:15] or he was helping him landscape a soon
[41:16] to be a beautiful yard
[41:19] or even learning to ride a bike drive a
[41:21] car motorcycle
[41:22] you would hear his sturdy soft and
[41:25] understanding voice
[41:26] which never could be replaced on the
[41:29] morning of november 14th
[41:32] frank flores lopez senior was called to
[41:33] join god in heaven
[41:36] my thought that was born on august 12th
[41:37] 1931
[41:39] to thomas and josephine in riverside
[41:42] california
[41:43] he came from a very big family and from
[41:46] a young age he learned the meaning of
[41:48] hard work
[41:50] i'm always talking about picking cotton
[41:53] and fruits off trees as a kid and even
[41:56] working at a movie theater running film
[41:59] and driving the owner's nice cars to
[42:00] resupply
[42:03] the snacks
[42:09] he married my nana aggie and had five
[42:11] beautiful kids
[42:13] once moving to tucson he would embark on
[42:15] a landscaping career
[42:17] which he was very proud of he was an
[42:19] extremely hard worker
[42:21] great provider a family man and a great
[42:23] role model
[42:25] he taught us the meaning of hard work
[42:28] we'll always remember spending the
[42:29] summers
[42:30] and most weekends over at his house
[42:34] going to work countless hours doing
[42:37] landscaping at houses
[42:39] throughout the day and even watching you
[42:42] make boxes in the living room
[42:44] out of cardboard duct tape and nylons
[42:47] which i would say was very impressive
[42:51] to say the least it definitely gave us
[42:54] an
[42:54] appreciation for for him
[42:58] and how hard he worked to provide for
[42:59] his family and i'm glad we could be part
[43:02] of that
[43:04] he showed us the importance or important
[43:07] family is
[43:08] to love one another and always be there
[43:10] for each other no matter what
[43:14] most importantly he brought god into our
[43:15] lives
[43:17] and i can still remember sitting in his
[43:19] room
[43:22] as well as my cousins and brothers
[43:24] reading the bible and listening
[43:25] to cassette tapes and telling us what
[43:28] each pass has meant
[43:29] and will cherish those times forever
[43:34] words can't express how much he will be
[43:36] missed and i'm so thankful that the lord
[43:38] blessed my family with his presence for
[43:40] nearly 90 years
[43:42] he truly will be missed and my prayers
[43:45] are with everyone's whose lives he's
[43:47] touched
[43:48] he truly was the best thought in the
[43:50] world and my family knows he's already
[43:52] in heaven watching over us
[43:57] there is like some kind of comfort in
[43:59] this
[44:00] not only knowing that he's with god
[44:02] jesus christ
[44:04] but knowing he will be joining his baby
[44:06] girl esther
[44:07] his dad tomas josephine and his brother
[44:10] joe
[44:10] and jesse and his sisters eleanor and
[44:13] ramona in heaven
[44:15] and i know the bar of life has been set
[44:17] very high by my tata
[44:19] and i think with the help of god love
[44:21] hard work and dedication
[44:24] we too can continue his legacy and make
[44:27] sure
[44:28] his name will never be forgotten amen
[44:32] i just want to say thank you for
[44:34] everyone that's came out here and
[44:36] it's definitely it's nice seeing
[44:38] everyone here and
[44:41] we love you guys a lot
[44:45] that's all i have thank you
[44:52] if he'll please stand and
[44:56] have the prayer spoken
[45:01] by benjamin lopez
[45:28] a healing prayer
[45:35] healing is of god alone
[45:39] god alone has purchased for us
[45:42] our healing it's up to us to do
[45:45] everything we can
[45:48] in our life and in every way
[45:51] that god has given us for our healing
[45:56] but god but it's god that heals
[45:59] if god calls you to go home tonight
[46:02] there isn't enough medicine in the world
[46:10] that will keep you here and if he
[46:13] determines you're to stay on earth
[46:16] no matter how many physicians say you're
[46:19] going tonight
[46:20] you're not going so it's all up to god
[46:25] thank everybody for coming and we love
[46:27] you all
[46:28] thank you yes
[46:33] it's not an easy thing to stand here and
[46:35] speak of your
[46:37] your family but the hope and the
[46:39] insurance that we have our sister and
[46:41] iran has a
[46:42] song peace in the valley if you
[46:46] you may be seated if she would prepare
[46:49] do then
[46:51] i was thinking of not getting to know
[46:55] the sotelo
[46:56] families the two youngest boys tim and
[46:58] sam
[46:59] went to high school together and
[47:03] i remember sitting there at the in the
[47:06] cafeteria
[47:08] and you had to guard your food with your
[47:11] fork
[47:13] if tim was close by because he'd reach
[47:16] over and take it
[47:18] but they're good memories part of that
[47:21] thank you

[55:34] and we'll read it and i promise not to
[55:36] keep you too long
[55:38] chapter 9 verse 23 i want to thank the
[55:40] lopez family for asking me to do this
[55:42] it's a real honor
[55:43] and i really appreciate it amen and also
[55:46] want to
[55:47] extend my gratitude to the pastor and
[55:48] the assistant pastor here may god bless
[55:50] them
[55:50] may god bless you all it's always good
[55:52] to be back together uh
[55:54] one time i i did a funeral for uh some
[55:57] folks at the church and then
[55:58] a little bit a couple weeks later had to
[56:00] do another one same family
[56:02] and then a few weeks after that did
[56:03] another one and so i didn't know how to
[56:06] handle the third one so i got up and i
[56:07] just said
[56:08] before i get started i wanted to let you
[56:10] know i also do weddings
[56:16] right all right brother green says we
[56:19] always want to all get together but
[56:20] nobody wants to die
[56:21] right but it's an opportunity to get
[56:24] together
[56:25] and to mend old wounds and to get over
[56:28] things
[56:29] and remember that most of our disagree
[56:31] disagreements are petty
[56:34] and nothing's worth nothing's not
[56:36] nothing is worth
[56:37] losing a relationship with one another
[56:39] is that all right to say amen
[56:41] all right luke chapter nine if you would
[56:43] and verse 23
[56:44] we'll read it together 23 uh brother in
[56:47] the back there through 27
[56:49] and he said to them all if any man will
[56:51] come after me
[56:53] let him deny himself and take up his
[56:55] cross daily
[56:56] and follow me for whosoever will save
[56:59] his life
[57:00] shall lose it but whosoever will lose
[57:02] his life for my sake
[57:04] the same shall save it for what is a man
[57:07] advantage if he gain the whole world
[57:10] and lose himself or be cast away
[57:13] for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and
[57:16] of my words now i want you to hang on to
[57:18] that word ashamed okay
[57:20] for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and
[57:22] my words of him
[57:23] shall the son of man be ashamed when he
[57:26] shall come in his own glory and in his
[57:27] fathers and of the holy angels
[57:31] but i tell you of a truth there be some
[57:34] standing here
[57:35] which shall not taste of death till they
[57:37] see the kingdom of god
[57:38] how many can believe that may god had a
[57:40] blessing to the reading of his word
[57:42] let's pray for a moment father
[57:45] lord if it wasn't for you i wouldn't be
[57:47] standing here
[57:49] if it wasn't for your presence or for
[57:51] your invitation
[57:53] none of us would be standing here there
[57:55] would be no celebration of life
[57:58] there would be no good memories to have
[58:00] we would simply be a heathen people a
[58:02] gentile people that knew
[58:04] no god but because of your grace and
[58:07] mercy you sent
[58:08] down your son jesus christ who died for
[58:11] us that
[58:11] we gentiles may know the glory of
[58:14] almighty god
[58:15] and so father we thank you for the
[58:17] opportunity to be together together here
[58:19] to know who you are and to remind each
[58:21] other of these great truths
[58:23] like the young brothers both got up and
[58:25] said we know where he
[58:26] is so i will only i can only assume that
[58:30] they all know
[58:31] that he is coming back again in the name
[58:34] of the lord jesus christ i pray father
[58:36] that you would comfort each heart
[58:37] would you be with each one that's
[58:38] hurting in each one that that has a tear
[58:41] to shed will you do as you have said
[58:43] that you would bless those that mourn
[58:45] for they shall be comforted
[58:47] this is the hour of comfort this is when
[58:49] we need that part of you lord
[58:51] but i pray father this will not be the
[58:53] only part of you that we
[58:54] continue to need for we still need a
[58:56] savior can you say amen
[58:58] we'll still need a deliverer can you say
[59:00] amen
[59:01] we still need a healer can you say amen
[59:04] and father we still need you
[59:05] in every facet of our life we're still
[59:08] looking towards you
[59:09] thank you we pray in jesus christ's name
[59:11] for there is none greater
[59:12] amen god bless you may be seated
[59:16] kind of a strange uh uh scripture
[59:19] here that to read at a funeral you
[59:22] normally people want to take the thought
[59:24] of uh you know i am the resurrection and
[59:26] the life how many have ever heard that
[59:28] one
[59:29] right we've gone to funerals and and we
[59:31] talk about how he raised lazarus from
[59:32] the dead
[59:33] and so forth but i think we should
[59:35] understand that
[59:36] brother frank was raised from the dead a
[59:38] long time ago
[59:39] does anybody understand that i'll help
[59:42] you see when he gave his life to jesus
[59:44] christ he died
[59:46] his old the old frank passed away at
[59:48] that moment
[59:49] we see we're here grieving a a death of
[59:52] the flesh but
[59:53] long ago when he was born again he gave
[59:56] up himself
[59:57] at that time when he accepted the lord
[59:59] jesus christ as his savior when he
[1:00:01] decided to to uh to be baptized in
[1:00:05] christian baptism it was at that time
[1:00:07] that the old frank
[1:00:08] died how many understand that we say
[1:00:09] amen so then
[1:00:11] we understand that in the resurrection
[1:00:13] we don't have to worry
[1:00:15] about whether or not he'll come back
[1:00:17] because we know that he'll raise up with
[1:00:19] christ in the resurrection
[1:00:21] you know there are different religions
[1:00:22] that that believe and give us the
[1:00:25] opportunity that if we want to
[1:00:27] we can go and get baptized for those
[1:00:29] that have died already
[1:00:30] how many understands that and the idea
[1:00:32] behind it is just in case they didn't
[1:00:34] make it
[1:00:34] i'll go and get baptized so that they
[1:00:36] that way they can have a chance
[1:00:38] well i think the theory is sound but it
[1:00:40] just doesn't work that way
[1:00:42] how many understands we need to make
[1:00:44] sure that our calling in election
[1:00:46] is is is on point it's made positive at
[1:00:50] this hour
[1:00:50] well i don't want to get to a death bed
[1:00:52] and figure out that my whole entire life
[1:00:55] has been a liar where my whole entire
[1:00:57] life has been frivolous or
[1:00:58] based on monetary gain because the bible
[1:01:01] clearly said here jesus said
[1:01:02] what does the man profit if he gains the
[1:01:04] whole world but he loses his soul
[1:01:07] as i went to talk to the family the
[1:01:10] other night
[1:01:10] i heard different things and i i like to
[1:01:13] hear the stories of the old timers
[1:01:14] because
[1:01:15] let's be honest brother charlie they
[1:01:17] don't make them like that anymore now do
[1:01:18] they
[1:01:20] can anybody say amen you see brother uh
[1:01:23] i saw johnny johnny lopez where you okay
[1:01:25] right there you are
[1:01:26] in hiding behind a mask i was talking
[1:01:29] about
[1:01:29] how his how brother frank had just quit
[1:01:31] working two years ago
[1:01:33] i was like how old was he when he passed
[1:01:34] away
[1:01:36] 89. two years ago he was working he told
[1:01:39] me about how he was up on
[1:01:40] a plank and two palm trees at 70 years
[1:01:43] old
[1:01:43] and he's using that belt and when he got
[1:01:45] up there he said when he got down
[1:01:47] he said my knee is starting to hurt and
[1:01:48] then he pulled the belt and it snapped
[1:01:50] and he goes well i guess that's my sign
[1:01:52] i'm going to stop working now
[1:01:54] no more climbing trees but i said you
[1:01:56] know brother johnny they just don't make
[1:01:57] them like that anymore
[1:01:58] their generation is strong but not as
[1:02:00] strong our generation is strong but not
[1:02:02] as strong and not as strong and then as
[1:02:04] they keep on going we we get weaker and
[1:02:06] weaker but the idea behind it is
[1:02:08] it's because we need to learn how to
[1:02:10] depend on jesus christ our lord and
[1:02:12] savior
[1:02:12] who needs to be our strength and our
[1:02:14] ever-present help at any time can you
[1:02:16] say amen
[1:02:17] brother frank was an individual who
[1:02:19] believed in jesus christ
[1:02:21] and when i sat there and heard the
[1:02:22] different stories i thought it was
[1:02:24] nice to hear what his wife had to tell
[1:02:26] him she said brother
[1:02:28] he read his bible every single day how
[1:02:31] many knew that
[1:02:33] she said but i told him one time you
[1:02:35] can't just read it
[1:02:36] frankie you need to live it
[1:02:41] yeah she said that don't get mad
[1:02:45] and i i had to come back around to that
[1:02:47] you remember sister rachel turn around i
[1:02:48] go
[1:02:49] hey hang on a second who told him that
[1:02:50] she said i told him brother
[1:02:53] she goes i don't know if he got offended
[1:02:55] but it didn't matter
[1:02:57] i said thank god for a good wife
[1:03:00] because it's true you can't just read it
[1:03:02] you need to apply it
[1:03:04] all the stories that they told that he
[1:03:06] was gather the children around and they
[1:03:08] would
[1:03:08] up he would play tapes i remember i grew
[1:03:10] up in such atmosphere
[1:03:12] but even playing tapes it's not where it
[1:03:14] stops
[1:03:15] if you take the words and leave the
[1:03:17] words on well who listens to tapes
[1:03:18] anymore right it's
[1:03:20] mp3s or or ipods or or even on your
[1:03:23] phone
[1:03:23] but if you just leave the words of the
[1:03:26] prophet on
[1:03:27] that mechanism or if you just leave the
[1:03:28] words of jesus
[1:03:30] on the pages it does us no good we have
[1:03:33] got to find out that we're not ashamed
[1:03:35] of the gospel
[1:03:36] is anybody in here ashamed somebody put
[1:03:38] up their hands i'm ashamed of the lord
[1:03:39] nobody will do it
[1:03:40] right no one will do it because you
[1:03:43] don't want to be identified as such
[1:03:46] but yet in our daily walk and i'm not
[1:03:48] here to scold you
[1:03:49] i'm here to encourage you because i
[1:03:50] would like to see every one of you make
[1:03:53] it to heaven how many would like to go
[1:03:54] to heaven let's see your hands go up now
[1:03:57] you know the prophet of god said one
[1:03:58] time i want all my family to make it
[1:04:01] he said i even want my friends to go
[1:04:04] now here's the catch he said i even want
[1:04:07] my enemies to go
[1:04:09] now you don't have to put up your hand
[1:04:11] but if you want to be honest
[1:04:13] how many of you got trouble with the
[1:04:15] last one
[1:04:17] i'm the only one really i said don't put
[1:04:20] up your hands then okay let's be honest
[1:04:21] how many has got trouble with that one
[1:04:23] thank you one or two people see but how
[1:04:26] can we be ashamed of the gospel
[1:04:27] well i'm a christian do you do you act
[1:04:30] like one
[1:04:31] so we we find out a lot of times when we
[1:04:33] come to churches especially in message
[1:04:35] congregations it's always about how you
[1:04:36] dress and how you look
[1:04:38] well let me just tell you i don't think
[1:04:39] that's right at all
[1:04:41] if you'll get the holy ghost he'll
[1:04:42] settle how you dress and how you look
[1:04:44] and how you behave
[1:04:46] i thought it was interesting that
[1:04:47] brother johnny told me he said when he
[1:04:49] would or maybe his sister rachel or
[1:04:51] becky that sister becky there was
[1:04:52] telling me all these different stories
[1:04:54] and they said if you were dating
[1:04:55] somebody
[1:04:55] he'd come in he said if you can't fit a
[1:04:58] large bible between you then you're
[1:04:59] sitting too close
[1:05:02] what was he doing he was taking sides
[1:05:04] with jesus
[1:05:06] he's trying to make sure that we didn't
[1:05:07] have any problems you understand
[1:05:10] johnny told me brother johnny he told me
[1:05:12] he said well we would go out you know
[1:05:14] until
[1:05:14] he'd go like this one thirty two o'clock
[1:05:16] three o'clock in the morning
[1:05:17] and i was looking at him i said what
[1:05:18] time johnny he said you know two three
[1:05:20] thirty nine what were you doing out
[1:05:21] there so that doesn't matter you know
[1:05:23] he said but my dad would stay awake
[1:05:26] praying reading his bible and listening
[1:05:28] to a tape
[1:05:28] until we got home
[1:05:32] now i thought i wonder what happened
[1:05:33] after they got home
[1:05:36] don't want to talk about that now huh
[1:05:38] let's talk about good things
[1:05:40] but that was a good thing see what was
[1:05:43] it
[1:05:43] taking sides with jesus standing in a
[1:05:46] gap or being in a position to where
[1:05:48] if my children are not quite to the
[1:05:50] place where i am i'll stay awake like
[1:05:52] job did
[1:05:53] job would make sacrifices and he would
[1:05:55] make sure that just
[1:05:56] in case watch read the bible now he said
[1:05:59] just in case
[1:06:00] my children have sinned just in case
[1:06:02] they've made a mistake
[1:06:03] here's a sacrifice so that god would
[1:06:05] cover their sin come on somebody right
[1:06:08] so then you have a modern day job in
[1:06:10] your family
[1:06:11] and he was staying awake just in case
[1:06:13] johnny's out doing
[1:06:15] just in case becky's out i'll tell you
[1:06:17] what i'll stay awake
[1:06:18] and i'll pray and i'll listen to a tape
[1:06:21] until they get home
[1:06:22] so that god will protect them and bring
[1:06:24] them home
[1:06:27] does anybody understand what i'm saying
[1:06:28] now it's time to take
[1:06:30] ties with jesus to stop being ashamed of
[1:06:34] your lineage who you are you were raised
[1:06:37] by frank lopez and his wife
[1:06:39] to not just be a a listener of the word
[1:06:42] but to be a doer and a partaker of such
[1:06:45] to not just have a guarantee that we
[1:06:47] know tata is in heaven and that's fine
[1:06:50] but do we know that we're going to be in
[1:06:52] heaven
[1:06:54] well you all got quiet on me now don't
[1:06:55] get hurt
[1:06:57] you see that's what the whole point of a
[1:06:58] funeral is isn't it to make your calling
[1:07:01] in election sure
[1:07:03] to find out that you know what when i
[1:07:05] when i get there am i going to have any
[1:07:07] trouble at the gate
[1:07:09] i know my grandmother is there i know a
[1:07:12] lot of people that have gone on
[1:07:13] but i just want to be there when he
[1:07:15] comes is that all right to say
[1:07:17] how many is mad at me you can raise your
[1:07:18] hand go ahead be honest
[1:07:20] you don't want to be honest all right
[1:07:22] we're trying to find out
[1:07:24] if i may share this with you being
[1:07:26] ashamed means to feel shamed
[1:07:29] or embarrassed or or disgraced
[1:07:32] i mean who would ever have the nerve
[1:07:34] brother larry who would ever have the
[1:07:36] nerve to turn around and say
[1:07:37] i don't want to be disgraced by jesus
[1:07:39] christ
[1:07:40] could you imagine how how many would
[1:07:42] ever send him say i'm ashamed of the
[1:07:44] lord jesus
[1:07:46] well i'll show you his disciples did it
[1:07:47] when they were crucifying them
[1:07:49] it was a disgraceful act one of the most
[1:07:51] shameful things that that a person could
[1:07:53] be put through
[1:07:54] and they wanted nothing to do with it
[1:07:55] but i wonder i wonder
[1:07:57] i just wonder are his disciples acting
[1:08:00] the same way even today
[1:08:02] i'm not ashamed of the gospel are you
[1:08:05] i need some answers hello we're not
[1:08:08] ashamed of jesus christ amen
[1:08:10] we identify with jesus if it wasn't for
[1:08:13] jesus
[1:08:13] where would any of us be what kind of a
[1:08:16] lifestyle would we have
[1:08:17] what kind of a a childhood would we have
[1:08:20] been raised by
[1:08:21] if it had not been for jesus so then our
[1:08:24] brother frank
[1:08:24] took it a step further i got this story
[1:08:26] and i thought it was fun
[1:08:28] his apostolic pastor brother larry you
[1:08:30] may remember these things
[1:08:32] took him to uh hear a man named william
[1:08:35] branham that's how he said it
[1:08:37] he said but we're just going because
[1:08:39] they say that that that he can heal
[1:08:41] people and he prays and people come to
[1:08:42] life
[1:08:43] let's just go see what he can do see
[1:08:45] what he can do
[1:08:46] but don't listen too much to what he
[1:08:48] says or pay
[1:08:49] the words were watch everything he says
[1:08:54] and so your grandfather your uncle your
[1:08:57] tata
[1:08:58] did exactly that he took his bible and
[1:09:01] he opened it up and he said every time
[1:09:02] brother brennan said something he looked
[1:09:03] for it
[1:09:04] because he was going to get him is that
[1:09:05] what he said he said i'm going to get
[1:09:07] him i'm going to find out where he's
[1:09:08] wrong i'm going to tell this guy
[1:09:10] and then something strange happened he
[1:09:12] couldn't find where brother branham was
[1:09:13] wrong
[1:09:15] isn't that odd who they get back and
[1:09:18] then after that
[1:09:19] brother branham started calling people
[1:09:20] out your name is so-and-so
[1:09:22] your name is so-and-so you're from here
[1:09:24] you live over there you're here for this
[1:09:26] and and frank brother frank lopez saw
[1:09:28] god
[1:09:29] updated have you anybody ever heard that
[1:09:31] before
[1:09:32] updated out of the pages of history and
[1:09:35] he could see the reality of what god was
[1:09:38] it wasn't a man it was god in a man can
[1:09:40] somebody say amen
[1:09:42] and then what took place with this they
[1:09:44] go back home and
[1:09:46] the apostolic pastor says now the the
[1:09:48] healing was fine and all that but just
[1:09:50] disregard everything he said
[1:09:52] well your grandfather stood up for him
[1:09:54] and said well i looked i couldn't find
[1:09:56] where he was wrong
[1:09:57] and after about 30 minutes of of tussle
[1:10:00] he says
[1:10:01] uh frank you can turn in your keys he
[1:10:02] said here they are
[1:10:04] and that's what started this whole
[1:10:07] revolution
[1:10:08] of message believing with your family
[1:10:11] he saw god on display and realized that
[1:10:15] jesus christ
[1:10:17] of the uh jehovah god of the old
[1:10:19] testament was indeed
[1:10:20] jesus christ of the new testament how
[1:10:22] many understand that say amen
[1:10:24] he also realized that he was jesus
[1:10:26] christ the same yesterday
[1:10:28] and today and forever and then brought
[1:10:30] his family out
[1:10:31] so that you all could learn and know the
[1:10:33] same thing amen
[1:10:35] i asked you did you still want me to
[1:10:37] preach
[1:10:39] this is because i love you because i
[1:10:41] came from a similar
[1:10:42] heritage my grandfather and
[1:10:45] your father is that right brother
[1:10:46] charlie brother manuel sotelo
[1:10:49] went up now what this is not about a man
[1:10:51] so just listen carefully okay don't get
[1:10:53] upset yet
[1:10:55] give it a chance and then you can decide
[1:10:57] what you want to believe
[1:10:59] but they went up to where the den was
[1:11:00] being built
[1:11:02] and they uh ran into a man named
[1:11:04] bankswood brother bankswood
[1:11:05] and they were there kind of just being
[1:11:07] nosy that's what i understood
[1:11:09] and he comes out and he says i've been
[1:11:10] waiting for you two brothers and they
[1:11:12] said no we don't work here they were
[1:11:13] dressed
[1:11:14] in work clothes and so forth they said
[1:11:16] we're just kind of snooping around
[1:11:17] he said you don't understand he said you
[1:11:19] see i asked brother branham when i was
[1:11:21] to come back home and he said you're
[1:11:22] going to wait there there's going to be
[1:11:23] two hispanic brothers driving a green
[1:11:25] van
[1:11:25] wearing white overalls that are gonna go
[1:11:28] to the den to ask questions about this
[1:11:29] message and when you answer their
[1:11:31] questions you can come home
[1:11:33] so you see i've been waiting for you
[1:11:36] well that settled it for my grandfather
[1:11:38] and for the sotelo grandfather
[1:11:40] so what does where does that put us not
[1:11:43] to just
[1:11:44] directly believe in a man but believe in
[1:11:46] the god that was
[1:11:47] in that man and believe in the god that
[1:11:51] was in your grandfather's that had
[1:11:53] enough holy spirit
[1:11:54] to knew to know when it was time to get
[1:11:56] out and
[1:11:57] follow the pillar of fire how many
[1:11:59] understands so then where does it leave
[1:12:01] us
[1:12:02] it puts us in a position as this is that
[1:12:04] we would have enough of the holy ghost
[1:12:07] to realize that we're not trying to hold
[1:12:09] on to buildings or hold on to memories
[1:12:11] or
[1:12:11] hold on to people we're trying to hold
[1:12:14] on to jesus christ
[1:12:15] who is the same yesterday and today and
[1:12:18] forever if you can sort of believe it
[1:12:20] just say amen where are you at today
[1:12:25] are you ashamed of the gospel would you
[1:12:28] tell anybody what your grandfather
[1:12:29] really believed
[1:12:31] would you be able to say my grandfather
[1:12:33] followed
[1:12:34] jesus christ and saul prophet live et
[1:12:36] cetera or do we bury that and say well
[1:12:38] we don't want to talk about that people
[1:12:39] won't understand
[1:12:41] we don't need them to listen to
[1:12:42] understand we need them to see a life
[1:12:44] lived
[1:12:45] what this generation and what this world
[1:12:47] is dying to see
[1:12:48] is jesus and somebody else where
[1:12:52] the young people are tired of hearing
[1:12:53] the stories they're tired of listening
[1:12:55] to tapes
[1:12:56] they want to see it happen in their day
[1:12:59] is god still alive
[1:13:01] yes or no is he still able to heal
[1:13:04] yes or no can he still save yes or no
[1:13:08] yes i know that he took people away with
[1:13:10] covet but he's also
[1:13:11] able to protect you from covet how many
[1:13:14] knows that's true
[1:13:15] that young brother was up here last i
[1:13:17] think or the healing prayer who did that
[1:13:19] that was you brother you're right it
[1:13:21] doesn't matter how many physicians will
[1:13:23] tell you you're going to die
[1:13:24] if god's not done with you you ain't
[1:13:26] going nowhere yes
[1:13:30] but if it's your time to go you're going
[1:13:31] to go
[1:13:34] but here's how it works just be ready to
[1:13:36] go when he comes for you
[1:13:38] when he hears you when he calls you are
[1:13:40] you going to hear his name
[1:13:42] if you let me just wrap it up with this
[1:13:44] you y'all seem kind of angry are you
[1:13:46] okay
[1:13:48] you know what it is it's the mask i
[1:13:50] can't tell if you're smiling or
[1:13:52] saying that or nothing you know what's
[1:13:55] strange about mass i realize you can see
[1:13:57] mischief
[1:13:58] a whole lot better
[1:14:01] it's just the truth you look in
[1:14:03] somebody's eyes you're like you're not a
[1:14:04] nice person
[1:14:06] right could you imagine brother aaron
[1:14:08] with a marriage you're smarter you'd
[1:14:10] never think he was a bad guy would you
[1:14:15] how could somebody be ashamed of jesus
[1:14:17] well i'll simply tell you like this if
[1:14:19] you're not born again
[1:14:20] it's very easy to be ashamed of god
[1:14:23] because that's your flesh
[1:14:24] you understand but when you're born
[1:14:26] again of the spirit of god
[1:14:28] and you're baptized and you accept the
[1:14:30] lord your savior and you're baptized
[1:14:32] in the in the name of the lord jesus
[1:14:33] christ and you receive the holy ghost
[1:14:35] well that means that god's life is
[1:14:36] inside of you
[1:14:37] as it was inside of brother frank here
[1:14:39] and i just want to ask you then how can
[1:14:41] god
[1:14:42] be ashamed of god if the life of god is
[1:14:45] in you how can the life of god be
[1:14:47] ashamed of god you understand what i
[1:14:48] mean
[1:14:49] there's no reproach at that point
[1:14:51] there's no well i'm embarrassed i know
[1:14:53] i'm proud that my
[1:14:54] grandfather was frank lopez i'm proud
[1:14:56] that my grandfather was joe duran senior
[1:14:58] i'm glad i'm proud that my grandfather
[1:15:00] was emanuel hotel
[1:15:01] and on and on we go what is it it's
[1:15:04] because they believe the true report and
[1:15:06] i'm going to believe the same is that
[1:15:08] right
[1:15:09] if you'll turn with me just quickly now
[1:15:10] first john chapter 2
[1:15:12] and then we'll stop being abusive
[1:15:20] first john chapter 2 verse 15.
[1:15:24] love not the world neither the things
[1:15:28] that are in the world if any man love
[1:15:31] the world
[1:15:31] the love of the father is not in him for
[1:15:35] all that is in the world
[1:15:37] the lust of the flesh and the lust of
[1:15:39] the eyes and the pride of life is not
[1:15:41] of the father but is of the world and
[1:15:44] the world
[1:15:45] passes away and the lusts thereof but he
[1:15:48] that doeth the will of god
[1:15:49] abideth forever now brother caleb what
[1:15:52] does this mean and what are you trying
[1:15:53] to get at because we're here to
[1:15:54] talk about my grandfather well i am
[1:15:56] talking about your grandfather
[1:15:58] for the entire time he didn't look at
[1:16:01] the world
[1:16:02] how many of you oh i saw where he lived
[1:16:04] but how many of you understand your
[1:16:06] grandfather wasn't into material stuff
[1:16:07] was he
[1:16:08] let me see your hands go up you believe
[1:16:09] that your dad your father whoever
[1:16:12] he wasn't into that stuff but he made
[1:16:13] sure our brother johnny said but he
[1:16:15] always made sure we had things
[1:16:16] he made sure we had shoes he goes he
[1:16:18] goes you know we didn't have the best
[1:16:19] shoes he said but all our neighbors
[1:16:20] always came over to our house for food
[1:16:24] they knew where to find the grub right
[1:16:26] because those things were not important
[1:16:28] to him
[1:16:29] what was important was will my children
[1:16:31] see jesus
[1:16:33] well my grandchildren see the lord and i
[1:16:35] know that he prayed for all of you
[1:16:37] i know he did or else you wouldn't be
[1:16:39] sitting here
[1:16:40] honoring his memory how can you best
[1:16:43] honor somebody when they go
[1:16:46] to just have a funeral service memorial
[1:16:48] service
[1:16:49] to say some nice things and and talk
[1:16:51] about dear old dad every now and then
[1:16:54] or is it better to live what they taught
[1:16:55] you at least one person say you know
[1:16:58] from now on
[1:16:58] i'm gonna do the right thing i'm not
[1:17:01] ashamed of jesus and i'm not afraid
[1:17:03] i'm not ashamed of what my grandfather
[1:17:05] lived not ashamed of what my father
[1:17:07] lived
[1:17:08] what he lived was right he lived to be a
[1:17:10] nice ripe old age
[1:17:12] and i could just imagine the reunion it
[1:17:14] must have been him walking in and seeing
[1:17:16] all those that had
[1:17:17] walked on before because he believed the
[1:17:20] true report
[1:17:21] in this day and age was talking to
[1:17:23] brother matt in the back there and he
[1:17:24] said the hypocrisy this whole
[1:17:26] covert thing stands six feet apart but
[1:17:28] but then you're all
[1:17:29] uh uh smothered into a what they call a
[1:17:31] plane anyway a cylinder or whatever
[1:17:33] and he goes you're breathing the same
[1:17:34] air they approved it and i said of
[1:17:36] course

[1:17:39] somebody faked the
[1:17:41] election somebody stole it somebody this
[1:17:43] somebody that who do you believe
[1:17:45] everything is swayed by opinion covert
[1:17:47] will kill you covet won't this will kill
[1:17:48] you that won't take this don't take this
[1:17:50] wear a mask don't wear a mask
[1:17:51] anybody confused yet this building is
[1:17:55] big enough you all probably don't have
[1:17:56] to wear them but you're doing it anyhow
[1:17:57] and it's okay
[1:18:01] standing right in front of them the
[1:18:03] truth of the matter is
[1:18:04] outside of jesus none of us in here
[1:18:06] stand a chance

[1:39:39] amen
[1:39:45] redeemed how i love to proclaim it amen
[1:39:50] to know that at once one time satan had
[1:39:53] taken
[1:39:54] and put you in the pawn shop but but him
[1:39:58] shedding his blood for you
[1:39:59] you're redeemed back as a child and the
[1:40:02] son of god amen
[1:40:04] so just a couple more memories
[1:40:08] i'd like to share with you going back to
[1:40:11] first meeting brother frank and the
[1:40:14] family and
[1:40:15] getting to know the boys as they grew up
[1:40:19] and
[1:40:20] rachel was quite young there but
[1:40:24] becky and my wife were good friends and
[1:40:26] esther was
[1:40:28] their older sister that had passed away
[1:40:30] was alive but
[1:40:32] we'd go out and sister aggie and
[1:40:36] sometimes becky and rachel would be
[1:40:37] going ahead and watering all the plants
[1:40:40] to make sure that we didn't have to stop
[1:40:43] and could go from house to house
[1:40:45] and get it done and i thought that was
[1:40:47] different
[1:40:50] i never saw that before and i used to
[1:40:51] wonder how did brother frank get them to
[1:40:53] do that
[1:40:55] but you know when when a husband and
[1:40:57] wife and a family love one another and
[1:40:58] they get along
[1:40:59] they're willing to share it it was
[1:41:02] different to me
[1:41:03] you know i always enjoyed it a couple
[1:41:05] years that we got to spend together
[1:41:08] working with him and treated us fair and
[1:41:11] treated us right and one of the ones
[1:41:13] that
[1:41:13] stood out to me was we were doing a
[1:41:16] cleanup job and
[1:41:18] this man came up and he he asked brother
[1:41:21] frank
[1:41:21] if brother frank would consider doing
[1:41:23] the job because it was right there in
[1:41:24] the neighborhood
[1:41:26] so brother frank gave him a quote and
[1:41:28] the man said
[1:41:29] that's a lot of money
[1:41:32] and brother frank goes it's a lot of
[1:41:35] work
[1:41:37] and the man just walked away and said
[1:41:38] okay because i'd worked for another man
[1:41:41] and
[1:41:41] somebody would tell him that then he
[1:41:42] would cut the price down was all said
[1:41:44] and done the man would charge 25
[1:41:46] dollars and me and the labor would say
[1:41:48] well that's five dollars for me and five
[1:41:50] dollars for you
[1:41:50] for a full day of work but brother frank
[1:41:54] charged and then he said let's go to
[1:41:55] work so
[1:41:57] learn that life you'll learn that young
[1:41:58] if we'll stand
[1:42:01] as a congregational song when we all get
[1:42:04] to heaven
[1:42:06] what a day of rejoicing that'll be
[1:42:10] you know some of the grandchildren don't
[1:42:13] remember grandpa's a young
[1:42:15] man about 19 to 21 years old
[1:42:19] in fact you boys and daughters don't
[1:42:21] remember dad that much either
[1:42:25] but we'll all be around the same age
[1:42:26] there won't be no old people in heaven
[1:42:28] stooped over and be young people
[1:42:31] and what a day that'll be amen
[1:42:49] he'll prepare for us a place when we all
[1:42:57] get to have what a day of rejoicing that
[1:43:03] will be
[1:43:06] when we all see
[1:43:10] jesus we will sing
[1:43:13] and shout the victory
[1:43:18] and while we want them
[1:43:24] clouds will overspread
[1:43:28] the sky but when
[1:43:31] traveling days are over
[1:43:35] not a shadow not a sun
[1:43:40] when we all get to
[1:43:44] have what a day of rejoicing that will
[1:43:50] be
[1:43:52] when we all see
[1:43:56] jesus we'll sing and
[1:44:00] shout the victory
[1:44:03] oh let
[1:44:05] [Music]
[1:44:15] just one glimpse of him
[1:44:20] [Music]
[1:44:31] what a day of rejoicing that will be
[1:44:37] when we all see
[1:44:41] jesus we'll sing and
[1:44:44] shout the victory

[1:45:05] to enter into the joys of the lord with
[1:45:07] dad

[1:45:12] two two folk two older brothers that i
[1:45:14] knew
[1:45:15] and both have passed on one of them was
[1:45:18] a landscaper and
[1:45:19] enjoyed just the
[1:45:22] the beauty of keeping everything nice
[1:45:24] and clean and neat
[1:45:26] and the other one liked to grow flowers
[1:45:28] and
[1:45:30] brother bill wiggins had passed away and
[1:45:32] some of the folks were making a comment
[1:45:33] saying
[1:45:34] we'll never get to see his beautiful
[1:45:35] flowers again
[1:45:37] but someone had a dream and brother bill
[1:45:39] came to him
[1:45:40] in the dream and he said if you think
[1:45:41] the flowers are beautiful on this side
[1:45:44] wait till you get to the other side if
[1:45:46] you think it's all beautiful just
[1:45:47] wait until you get to the other side and
[1:45:50] my brother-in-law's father passed away
[1:45:52] recently and that was his joy
[1:45:54] the last couple years of his life when
[1:45:56] he was able to he couldn't walk but he'd
[1:45:58] get on his hands and knees and clean the
[1:46:00] yard
[1:46:00] and do the landscaping on his hands and
[1:46:02] knees because he loved it so much
[1:46:05] so he's talking to to my sister and
[1:46:08] brother-in-law and he said but on the
[1:46:09] other side
[1:46:10] it'll all be done for him he'll get to
[1:46:13] enjoy every bit
[1:46:14] so there won't be no climbing up no palm
[1:46:16] trees no more there won't be no
