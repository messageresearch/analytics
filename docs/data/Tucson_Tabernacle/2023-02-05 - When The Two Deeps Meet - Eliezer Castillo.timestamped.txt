[33:20] excited about this young man right here
[33:23] but Eli Castillo is somebody that
[33:26] I've been wanting to introduce to the
[33:29] church
[33:30] he's
[33:32] I first heard him I don't know three
[33:34] four five years ago at brother Poe's
[33:36] church and
[33:37] I still remember he took his text out of
[33:39] Jeremiah I believe it was
[33:41] and he talked about
[33:45] that
[33:47] if you are wearied
[33:50] in walking
[33:52] running with the footman
[33:55] how can you run with the horses
[33:58] and he took that text out of that and it
[34:00] really impressed me that the brother had
[34:02] such a deep and solid understanding of
[34:05] this word and he's been on my heart now
[34:09] for a while
[34:10] and I know that our brother is going to
[34:14] be a blessing to all of us so brother

[38:21] scriptures and and as I was a child I
[38:25] would go to sleep with the tape on and

[38:32] Deep which in reality is a very simple
[38:36] message
[38:37] it's a very simple message how brother
[38:39] Branham brought it out he said if
[38:42] there's a deep calling there is a deep
[38:44] to respond to that calling and um it was
[38:47] just such a blessing that we're able to
[38:51] hear a prophet preach that beautiful
[38:52] message
[38:54] in First John 3 2 it says
[38:58] beloved now
[39:00] are we the sons of God
[39:03] now we are the sons of God
[39:06] and it doeth not appear what we shall be
[39:10] but we know that when he shall appear we
[39:15] shall be like him
[39:17] for we shall see him as he is
[39:22] so for me I I attached myself to that
[39:27] scripture
[39:28] and I realized down throughout the whole
[39:31] ages there was a deep calling to a deep
[39:35] and brother Branham he would say how how
[39:38] a little child he would eat the bicycle
[39:40] petals and he said because there was
[39:43] something calling in his body for
[39:45] something
[39:46] and and
[39:48] um God throughout the whole ages has
[39:50] been calling
[39:51] calling the people calling and
[39:54] throughout the years and throughout the
[39:55] ages people have been responding to that
[39:58] call
[39:59] there has been a call to the Bride of
[40:02] Jesus Christ but there was a response
[40:05] from the bride saying yes Lord here we
[40:08] are here we are here we are
[40:10] and and as simple as the prophet brought
[40:13] it to us it's such a profound thought
[40:17] that God from heaven we just heard that
[40:20] song down from his glory
[40:22] he came down from his glory he came down
[40:25] from eternity so that Earth and Eternity
[40:29] can touch ground and touch places
[40:32] so that we can know that we are not from
[40:35] this place
[40:37] and um so I wanted to take that little
[40:40] thought of deep calleth to the deep and
[40:44] thinking about throughout the seven
[40:46] Church ages that there was a deep
[40:48] calling to a deep there was prophets
[40:50] there was Apostles there was people
[40:53] Messengers calling out
[40:55] saying God is here God is preparing a
[40:58] bride God and they they cried out to the
[41:02] people
[41:03] and throughout the ages we've seen that
[41:06] deep calling to the Deep
[41:09] but today you think about it
[41:12] there's not another age left
[41:15] we're not waiting for another messenger
[41:18] we're not waiting for another age we're
[41:20] not waiting for another time we're
[41:22] waiting for those two deeps to meet
[41:25] that's what we're waiting for
[41:28] throughout our years we've been
[41:30] listening to deep call it to the deep
[41:32] but it's at that moment
[41:34] where those two deeps finally meet we've
[41:38] been responding to the Lord
[41:40] but now it's time to meet that other
[41:42] deep
[41:44] meet that desire that we've had the
[41:46] desire of of not wanting to live in the
[41:49] world
[41:50] brother brother Arnie if
[41:52] um you know I'm sorry if I say too much
[41:54] but he was talking to me about a person
[41:57] that was crying out he was crying
[41:58] because the life he was living
[42:01] he was living a a bad life and he was
[42:04] crying to brother Arnie because
[42:06] something inside of him he's crying out
[42:09] for something
[42:11] and and I could see we all had that cry
[42:15] that deep Lord Save Me Lord
[42:18] Lord take this habit From Me Lord
[42:21] Lord make me more like you father
[42:24] Lord make me a better Christian
[42:27] and these these might seem very simple
[42:30] things that are going on in our lives
[42:33] Lord make me a better Christian
[42:35] Lord make me make me to walk in in your
[42:38] way father
[42:40] take this habit off of me
[42:43] but but not knowing
[42:46] that that the Bible says and brother
[42:48] Branham declares that we were in the
[42:50] thinking of God
[42:52] that we were part of God
[42:56] that we were a piece of him
[42:59] so it's just not God saved me but Lord
[43:02] we're trying to go back to God
[43:06] and and that is the cry that we have
[43:09] and I thought of that child
[43:11] um brother Branham sometimes called him
[43:13] a baby but he and he would call him a
[43:15] child but this little child that began
[43:17] to eat bicycle petals and he would eat
[43:19] erasers
[43:21] and how the parents thought it was very
[43:24] very strange
[43:25] the way he was acting
[43:27] now remember when there's a deep calling
[43:30] to a deep we begin to act strange
[43:33] you know if you're in the world you
[43:35] begin to act strange
[43:37] you know if if you're still out doing
[43:40] what you're doing maybe nobody knows but
[43:43] yet it's hard to stay away from that
[43:46] word
[43:47] it's hard to stop talking about church
[43:49] stop talking about the Lord and people
[43:52] say man I'm not trying to have a good
[43:53] time why are you still talking to me
[43:55] about the Lord here
[43:57] there's a deep calling to a deep
[43:59] we we feel like we're still insufficient
[44:03] and we say Lord I still need more of you
[44:06] maybe somebody else might say man that
[44:09] that sister she she's an example to us
[44:12] that brother that brother he's such an
[44:15] example
[44:16] but to that brother might say I'm still
[44:19] insufficient
[44:21] you know Paul that's what he said
[44:24] he said I'm still reaching
[44:27] I'm leaving those things behind and I'm
[44:30] still reaching for things Beyond me now
[44:33] you're talking about the Apostle the
[44:35] prophet of the age
[44:37] yet he was still reaching out why there
[44:40] was something calling out
[44:43] and for this child he was his body was
[44:46] calling out for something
[44:48] and it made me think of of Genesis 3 19
[44:52] how it said dust Thou Art and dust you
[44:56] shall return
[44:58] we were all made of dust we were all
[45:00] made of these these uh brother Branham
[45:03] City 16 elements I looked it up and they
[45:05] said we are made up 99 of our body is
[45:08] made up of six elements and then the
[45:10] rest is is is different things like
[45:13] sulfur and everything like that but we
[45:15] are made up of six elements
[45:18] of sulfur carbon or not not sulfur
[45:22] carbon hydrogen
[45:24] uh I don't know it's six of them I I've
[45:27] got it here but I won't bore you with it
[45:29] this is not a science class here but six
[45:32] elements
[45:34] that are in us that we are made up of
[45:36] oxygen
[45:37] all of these things we are made up of
[45:40] the ground so we are made up of the dust
[45:43] and one of these days this body has to
[45:46] return to that dust
[45:47] one of these days so our body begins to
[45:50] cry out to the dust our body is
[45:54] um once more of the dust and that's why
[45:56] that child began to eat that bicycle
[45:59] pedal because he was deficient of sulfur
[46:03] he needed sulfur
[46:05] so he began to eat the bicycle pedal and
[46:08] people said man that's a very strange
[46:10] kid
[46:12] eating bicycle petals something's wrong
[46:14] with him eating he races off pencils but
[46:18] they didn't know there was a deep call
[46:22] in his body and he didn't even know
[46:25] and that's why I'm saying sometimes you
[46:27] feel like man for some reason I need to
[46:29] go to church
[46:32] sometimes I feel like I need to sing a
[46:34] special for the Lord and I don't know
[46:35] why
[46:37] I need to do something for the Lord and
[46:39] you think it's simple and you think it's
[46:41] it's on the outward but you don't know
[46:44] that there's a deficient
[46:47] there's a deficiency inside of you
[46:50] asking for a part of God
[46:54] asking for something deeper
[46:57] but in our life we're just we're just
[47:00] chewing on the bicycle pedal
[47:03] we're just saying wait I need to go to
[47:05] church not knowing that you were from
[47:07] God and you're trying to go back to God
[47:10] but when we go to church we're chewing
[47:13] on that eraser
[47:15] where we begin to testify at work and
[47:18] people say man this guy is acting crazy
[47:21] man this this lady why is she dressed
[47:23] that way
[47:24] why there's a deep calling to a deep
[47:27] there's something going on
[47:29] and that boy's body was calling for
[47:31] sulfur because he was deficient in him
[47:35] brother Branham says in um in hearing
[47:39] recognizing and acting is it okay if I
[47:40] read some quotes amen
[47:43] um like the little boy
[47:45] that I always speak of eating erasers
[47:48] off pencils and The Petal off the
[47:51] bicycle he needed sulfur and as long as
[47:54] there was something to Crave for sulfur
[47:57] there had to be sulfur some were first
[48:00] made
[48:01] there had to be sulfur before he had the
[48:04] Crave and it the sulfur projected him
[48:09] and he went back to the sulfur
[48:12] see the dust is calling for the Dust
[48:16] you know brother Branham says we were
[48:19] born with the cocoa burn nature
[48:22] sin is connected to sin
[48:25] we we can't help when we're born in this
[48:29] world we're born in sin we're shaped in
[48:31] iniquity
[48:33] so when we come we come already fallen
[48:37] we already come with the body Desiring
[48:40] the Dust
[48:42] you know I thought about it in the
[48:44] beginning brother how God he he cursed
[48:48] the serpent he cursed the woman
[48:51] and I'm like man Adam he he got he got
[48:54] away
[48:55] he didn't curse at him
[48:57] but I realized God did
[49:02] the most hardest thing when he cursed
[49:05] the ground
[49:09] who was made out of the ground
[49:11] we all are
[49:13] we all are so everything is made up of
[49:17] these
[49:18] six elements
[49:19] there's I believe four essential
[49:22] elements
[49:23] that are made up of the universe
[49:26] those same elements those same that same
[49:30] matter that you have inside you is
[49:32] consisted the same consistency of the
[49:35] star you see out there
[49:37] You're Made Of that Stardust
[49:40] You're Made Of that ground so when God
[49:43] said curse it be the ground the whole
[49:45] world the whole universe
[49:48] went into bondage
[49:51] every element went into sin
[49:55] so when he said curse it be the Dust We
[49:58] are crying out for that curse
[50:00] because we're made of that dust
[50:03] we're made of that curse
[50:06] so it's natural for a young man or a
[50:09] young woman to cry out to the world see
[50:11] brother Branham says you can raise him
[50:13] as best as you can but once that music
[50:15] hits their ears
[50:17] they they're attached to it that we have
[50:19] a cocoa berm nature
[50:21] that that attaches to sin
[50:25] and um you know I never knew it was
[50:27] called a cocober and I looked it up and
[50:29] I'm like oh my goodness those things
[50:32] those things they have little barbs in
[50:34] it you know I you have the goat heads
[50:36] you have other ones but these ones have
[50:38] barbs and you're trying to take it off
[50:40] your pants and and then they get stuck
[50:43] on your finger and you just it's a mess
[50:47] that's what our nature is
[50:49] we we are crying out for sin we're
[50:52] brother Bradham says sin is connected to
[50:56] sin
[50:57] and and these six elements are crying
[51:00] out
[51:02] for the Dust
[51:04] if you're anemic you're crying out for
[51:06] iron
[51:08] if you need magnesium you're crying out
[51:10] for the dust you're crying out for life
[51:13] so so it's strange that the dust has to
[51:16] go back to the Dust
[51:19] though that's the only way we can get uh
[51:22] strengthened is by the dust that we were
[51:24] created from
[51:26] and it's the same thing with the sin we
[51:28] are crying out for the sin
[51:30] these bodies
[51:32] this nature this Fallen nature that we
[51:34] had we're crying out but Brothers we
[51:36] have a seventh element here
[51:39] there's a seventh element if I would
[51:42] like to say it you know it's just my
[51:43] thoughts but we have a peace of God in
[51:47] each and every predestinated seed
[51:50] and brother that's brother Arnie that's
[51:52] why sometimes people cry out even though
[51:54] they're in these bad conditions
[51:57] they're maybe in these drugs maybe
[51:59] they're in these things they're crying
[52:02] out for life
[52:04] I remember when I was going to those
[52:06] things people said man
[52:08] this guy is a lost cause
[52:11] this guy is a lost cause
[52:15] not knowing there was a seed inside of
[52:18] me
[52:19] what what about that woman at the well
[52:22] all the people turned her down
[52:26] all the people said she is a lost cause
[52:29] but brother Branham he said that there
[52:31] was a light there was a seed inside of
[52:34] her a germ of life
[52:36] and all she needed to do was get in
[52:39] contact
[52:41] she was calling there was a deep calling
[52:44] to the Deep she needed something from
[52:46] God and when it she was encountered with
[52:48] the word she came to herself
[52:51] she realized who she was she realized
[52:54] who Jesus Christ was she realized that
[52:57] she wasn't that person she was
[52:58] portraying
[53:01] because she had an element inside of her
[53:05] she had a seed of God in her that was
[53:08] crying out for life
[53:11] what a beautiful thing amen
[53:14] brother Branham
[53:16] he says or or no in in First Corinthians
[53:19] it says 1550
[53:22] um
[53:23] it says
[53:26] now I say Brethren that flesh and blood
[53:29] cannot inherit the kingdom of God
[53:33] so so this culcober nature we're part of
[53:37] these six elements brother Branham said
[53:39] these it's made up of 16 elements
[53:42] it's always going to want to cry out for
[53:46] the world
[53:47] our flesh and blood cannot please the
[53:50] Lord
[53:51] it cannot save itself
[53:54] flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[53:57] kingdom of God
[53:59] we cannot
[54:01] it has to be something inside of us
[54:03] there has to be a cry for a body change
[54:06] there has to be a cry for something
[54:09] eternal
[54:10] it says that neither doth corruption
[54:13] inherit incorruption
[54:16] so so there's something inside of us a
[54:20] different element that needs to cry out
[54:22] for eternal life not her flesh we can
[54:25] come to church all we want but if
[54:27] there's no cry if there's nothing there
[54:29] then there's nothing to respond
[54:33] all we're doing is is fulfilling a
[54:35] religious fulfillment and that same
[54:38] thing as fulfilling the dust we're going
[54:41] back to the dust there
[54:43] but there has to be a deep calling to a
[54:46] deep
[54:47] there has to be a connection you have to
[54:49] hear the voice and you cry back out that
[54:52] at that voice
[54:53] and then it goes beyond Church even
[54:55] though your heart is saying I need to go
[54:57] to church there's it's
[54:59] that's what you're doing you're eating
[55:01] the bicycle pedal but there's something
[55:03] deeper
[55:06] then church becomes more
[55:09] then when when the brother comes up to
[55:12] preach you're seeking for life
[55:16] you're not looking at the brother
[55:18] anymore you're looking at God and you're
[55:20] saying Lord I need a piece of you today
[55:23] Lord I I need more of you I need more of
[55:26] this element of Jesus Christ
[55:28] I need more of your spirit
[55:30] and we cry out to that
[55:33] brother Branham says he said now notice
[55:36] we cannot deny or that word cannot deny
[55:39] itself then it is satisfied or it's the
[55:42] desire of the
[55:44] um or it's the desire it's a desire of
[55:47] what
[55:47] what made you desire it in the first
[55:50] place because down in your soul was a
[55:54] predestinated seed which was eternal and
[55:57] always was laying there
[55:59] always was laying in there and all the
[56:02] father has given me will come to me
[56:04] there isn't any of them that are going
[56:06] to be lost this isn't thinking man's
[56:08] filter
[56:10] so there's oh there's always been a seed
[56:12] in you
[56:13] there's always been something
[56:16] inside of you well brother I don't feel
[56:18] like I have the Holy Ghost that has
[56:19] nothing to do with it if you have a seat
[56:22] in you a part of God
[56:24] you're bound for the Holy Ghost
[56:27] you're bound for eternal life
[56:31] because there's something crying out
[56:33] don't look at your cocoa Burr condition
[56:37] don't look at that just look at the
[56:38] promises look at what God has ordained
[56:42] for us said brother Branham he would say
[56:44] that that seed has everything inside of
[56:47] it
[56:48] it has the transforming power inside of
[56:51] that sea already
[56:54] and he took us all the way to the
[56:55] beginning how it said every seed it
[56:58] already had every tree inside of that
[57:00] seed
[57:01] every fruit that you're going to see in
[57:03] that tree was inside of that seed
[57:06] everything you need for the journey your
[57:09] healing your salvation your deliverance
[57:12] your family everything is inside of that
[57:15] seed
[57:17] and all we're doing is now crying out
[57:20] crying out for Life projecting ourselves
[57:23] to eternal life so that that seed can
[57:25] manifest
[57:26] so there's that deep calling to the Deep
[57:29] brother Branham he also says in God
[57:31] who's in rich in Mercy he said
[57:33] for when God had you in his thinking in
[57:36] the beginning you have to be some part
[57:40] um you have you have to be some part of
[57:42] you your life that is in you had to be
[57:45] with God there before
[57:47] so that is the connection well he says
[57:50] well when he before even become material
[57:54] on Earth before there was anything but
[57:57] God you were there in one of his
[58:00] attributes he knows you he knowed your
[58:03] name what would it be he knowed what
[58:05] color of hair you would have he knowed
[58:07] all about you so what is that deep
[58:10] calling for the Deep it's God calling
[58:12] from eternity
[58:14] is God calling you back to himself
[58:17] and every time we answer that deep gets
[58:20] closer
[58:21] that's the thing
[58:24] see we've heard many times the Deep
[58:26] calleth to the Deep the Deep callers to
[58:27] the deep but this is the day the day
[58:30] that we're living when those two deeps
[58:32] meet
[58:35] that we are living in such a a day that
[58:38] we're so privileged
[58:41] because nobody else in all these Ages
[58:43] were able to connect
[58:46] to that other deep
[58:48] and and one of these days You're Gonna
[58:52] come to yourself
[58:54] what did it say now we are the sons of
[58:56] God but one of these days it doesn't
[58:59] appear yet what we shall be but one of
[59:01] these days we shall see him and we will
[59:04] be just like him
[59:06] isn't that strange when we see him we'll
[59:09] be just like him
[59:12] that's such a strange
[59:14] scripture to me but it's so real
[59:18] so the the more I see him the more I
[59:21] become
[59:22] him
[59:23] what who is he now he's God in print
[59:26] form
[59:28] every time I open my bible every time I
[59:31] I feed myself with these elements these
[59:34] the nutrition of the word I might the
[59:37] body of Christ or Christ in me is formed
[59:41] more and more and more and more and more
[59:43] and more until one of these days I step
[59:46] into that body
[59:48] and we will be scared like John was in
[59:51] Revelations but we will be just like him
[59:54] and when we see him we will be afraid we
[59:57] will be part of that bride
[1:00:00] we will be just like him
[1:00:03] it's that deep calling to the Deep the
[1:00:05] mate calling for her mate
[1:00:09] saying Lord I need you more
[1:00:12] so it puts our body into subjection when
[1:00:15] we hear the word when we begin to cry
[1:00:18] what did it say that that the sulfur
[1:00:20] projected that little boy
[1:00:22] it projected him back to the sulfur
[1:00:26] and and that deficiency in us because
[1:00:29] brother Bradham said that we bypassed
[1:00:32] our theophany
[1:00:34] so we're calling for something we were
[1:00:36] born with the deficiency of God
[1:00:39] we were born with something that that
[1:00:42] first brother Brandon said God put a
[1:00:44] thirst in each and every person
[1:00:48] so we cry out and you see these people
[1:00:50] at the in the bars you see these people
[1:00:52] committing adultery you see all these
[1:00:55] sins in the world
[1:00:57] and people say oh what a shame
[1:01:00] what is it it's a thirst that they're
[1:01:02] trying to fulfill
[1:01:04] when you see people drink it's a Godly
[1:01:06] thirst
[1:01:08] that they're trying to fulfill
[1:01:11] but but there's a people
[1:01:13] that are going to
[1:01:16] get in contact with that word
[1:01:18] that's what brother Branham was here for
[1:01:22] that was that's what happened whenever
[1:01:24] God revealed the word to us
[1:01:27] it projected us to him it changed us
[1:01:31] from from justification sanctification
[1:01:34] from Luther Wesley Pentecost into this
[1:01:37] day
[1:01:38] it projected us because why because the
[1:01:41] word was revealed more Jesus revealed
[1:01:43] himself a little more
[1:01:46] it actually said he the seventh angel
[1:01:49] was going to reveal all the Mysteries
[1:01:52] so what does that mean
[1:01:54] brother Brown said in in the unveiling
[1:01:57] of God he was God in full View
[1:02:00] did he say that he's in full View today
[1:02:04] now I'm jumping myself but but
[1:02:07] when Moses
[1:02:10] when Moses was there in Mount Sinai he
[1:02:12] said Lord let me see your glory glory
[1:02:15] means his Splendor His image
[1:02:19] he said let me see you and at that same
[1:02:22] time God was going to reveal the word at
[1:02:24] that time what was it the Ten
[1:02:26] Commandments
[1:02:28] so he said Lord let me see your word let
[1:02:31] me see your glory he said okay but
[1:02:33] you're not going to be able to see all
[1:02:34] of it because nobody has seen me and
[1:02:36] lived
[1:02:37] you cannot see me and live so you're
[1:02:40] only going to see part of my glory
[1:02:43] and whenever he began to see him
[1:02:45] he began to worship
[1:02:48] and when he went down he then went down
[1:02:50] with the word
[1:02:52] and when he walked he said oh praise God
[1:02:54] for that Glory people began to say Moses
[1:02:57] Moses Veil yourself
[1:03:00] why because the very Glory that he
[1:03:03] beheld became him
[1:03:06] that same Glory that he saw it jumped on
[1:03:09] him
[1:03:10] and he became that very same Glory
[1:03:13] no wonder the Bible says when we see him
[1:03:16] we shall be like him
[1:03:18] why because when we see that Glory when
[1:03:21] we see that word we're carrying that
[1:03:23] word today that revealed word when
[1:03:26] everybody is carousing and everybody's
[1:03:28] down in the mountain building idols and
[1:03:31] and all these things we're here with the
[1:03:33] word
[1:03:35] looking at that Glory
[1:03:38] and as we look at that Glory you become
[1:03:41] That Glory
[1:03:43] so the more you feed on the word
[1:03:45] the more you feed on on this revelation
[1:03:48] of the word
[1:03:50] the more you become
[1:03:52] what is it a deep calling to the Deep
[1:03:54] Lord give me more of your vitamins
[1:03:58] Lord I don't want to be deficient
[1:04:00] and then you try to be healed trying to
[1:04:03] be safe not knowing you're stepping into
[1:04:05] your theophany every time
[1:04:08] brother Branham says every time we feed
[1:04:10] on the word we're forming
[1:04:12] that other body
[1:04:14] I don't know what that means but
[1:04:17] that's what's happening
[1:04:19] I can't explain it but it's happening
[1:04:23] what a beautiful thing amen
[1:04:27] amen he says now brother Branham says in
[1:04:31] the Great Commission 1958 he says you
[1:04:33] know David said when the Deep calls to
[1:04:35] the Deep
[1:04:36] the Deep begin to call to the deep and I
[1:04:38] heard that old uh bull elk bugle
[1:04:42] the storm separated them
[1:04:45] there was a separation between us and
[1:04:47] God
[1:04:48] the storm separated them through the
[1:04:51] mass of the blowing the timber falling
[1:04:54] and the herd got broke up and there was
[1:04:57] a bugling to one another to come back to
[1:05:00] one another
[1:05:03] remember when brother bran would give
[1:05:04] that testimony and and he said I acted
[1:05:07] like a crazy person
[1:05:09] he said if anybody would have saw me
[1:05:10] they would have thought I was a crazy
[1:05:11] person he was jumping her jumping around
[1:05:14] running around the tree
[1:05:16] praising the Lord
[1:05:18] and every once in a while when he would
[1:05:20] rest God would reveal something else the
[1:05:22] the rainbow
[1:05:24] he would reveal the the howling from one
[1:05:27] mate to another
[1:05:29] and then he would hear the bull owl
[1:05:31] calling to its mate
[1:05:34] what a beautiful thing
[1:05:36] I thought to myself I said Lord
[1:05:38] eventually they got together
[1:05:41] and how how did they get together by the
[1:05:44] call
[1:05:46] so every time the male act said come
[1:05:49] come with me come back together she
[1:05:53] would say okay I gotta go this way
[1:05:55] I gotta turn over here I gotta Stop This
[1:05:58] I Gotta stop this habit I gotta do this
[1:06:01] I gotta do that and she began to
[1:06:03] maneuver her her way around the timber
[1:06:06] the Fallen Timber the winds everything
[1:06:10] every time she'd hear that bugle she
[1:06:13] would get a little closer
[1:06:15] every time she would hear the voice or
[1:06:17] the word
[1:06:18] of her mate she'd get a little closer
[1:06:22] she'd get a little closer
[1:06:24] and eventually there was a day when
[1:06:26] those two mates they finally met again
[1:06:31] where are we at today
[1:06:33] what day are we living
[1:06:37] how close are we where the word is so
[1:06:40] close to us
[1:06:41] God says come up hither
[1:06:44] I gotta get a little closer
[1:06:46] I'm a little closer I hear him he's
[1:06:48] closer my life is improving I'm changing
[1:06:53] I used to do this now it just fell off
[1:06:55] of me I didn't have to try I didn't have
[1:06:57] to be this I didn't have to do anything
[1:06:59] it just fell off of me
[1:07:01] why you're getting closer and closer to
[1:07:04] your mate
[1:07:05] brother Branham he says he says the mate
[1:07:07] of the wolf calling let's come back
[1:07:10] together the eye was calling to the
[1:07:12] rainbow let's come back together he says
[1:07:15] the spirit calling to the church let's
[1:07:18] come back together let's unite God was
[1:07:22] there he says what a beautiful thing and
[1:07:25] just like I said that sulfur projected
[1:07:27] that child
[1:07:29] it projected him to do something he
[1:07:32] didn't know he he's he doesn't know
[1:07:34] about science he doesn't know what his
[1:07:36] deficiency is all he knew was to start
[1:07:38] gnawing on a pedal
[1:07:40] and maybe it starts acting strange maybe
[1:07:42] you start acting strange in your work
[1:07:44] maybe something starts happening in your
[1:07:46] life maybe you become irritable and you
[1:07:48] don't know what are you doing you're
[1:07:50] gnawing on the pedal Lord I don't know
[1:07:52] what's going on I need more of you I'm
[1:07:54] not comfortable in my own skin anymore
[1:07:58] what are we doing we're acting strange
[1:08:00] people say well I don't know what's
[1:08:02] going on but it took a physician
[1:08:05] it took a physician to say That boy is
[1:08:07] not strange that boy there's nothing
[1:08:09] wrong with him he's crying out for
[1:08:11] sulfur
[1:08:12] he's crying out for something that's
[1:08:14] deeper than that pedal
[1:08:17] deeper than just coming to church deeper
[1:08:19] than than stop acting and stop cussing
[1:08:22] the way you do
[1:08:24] deeper than dropping your habits there's
[1:08:27] something deeper it's just projecting
[1:08:29] you to do those things
[1:08:32] it's God calling back to God
[1:08:35] why because we were a piece of him
[1:08:38] we were a part of him and he's calling
[1:08:40] back to himself
[1:08:43] he divided himself in the beginning
[1:08:45] that's how True Fellowship is
[1:08:48] God dividing himself one person divides
[1:08:52] himself
[1:08:54] he that's that's been his his uh agenda
[1:08:58] this whole time
[1:09:00] God said I'm lonely he didn't get
[1:09:02] somebody some other entity he pulled out
[1:09:04] of himself
[1:09:06] and he said let us make man in my image
[1:09:08] in our image
[1:09:10] and then when he said man Adam looks a
[1:09:12] little lonely he didn't say let me make
[1:09:14] another piece of dirt he said no out of
[1:09:16] him
[1:09:18] what was it a dividing of himself to
[1:09:21] create a Unity
[1:09:23] and then whenever in the in the day of
[1:09:25] Pentecost what did God do
[1:09:27] he divided the pillar of fire and
[1:09:30] created the greatest Unity ever built
[1:09:34] I could be in Phoenix you guys can be
[1:09:36] here and somehow brother we are united
[1:09:39] why because by one Spirit we are all
[1:09:42] baptized into one body and I am your
[1:09:44] brother you are my sister you are my
[1:09:46] brother
[1:09:47] we are united together
[1:09:50] in one Spirit God dividing himself and
[1:09:54] bringing back himself I remember brother
[1:09:57] Brown says I love my wife so much I just
[1:09:59] wander inside me
[1:10:02] wow well he was that's Revelation there
[1:10:05] why because that's where she came out of
[1:10:08] that's where Eve came out of she came
[1:10:10] out of Adam
[1:10:13] and in order for them to have proper
[1:10:15] Unity she had to come out of him
[1:10:18] because she was he was she was in him
[1:10:20] yet he was alone
[1:10:23] he was there packing her everywhere and
[1:10:25] when God gave him the the uh commission
[1:10:28] said multiply replenish the Earth have
[1:10:30] dominion he was talking to him and her
[1:10:33] because they were all in one
[1:10:35] but in order to fulfill that unity in
[1:10:38] order to fulfill that they had to divide
[1:10:42] God had to divide and separate himself
[1:10:44] so that he can bring us back together
[1:10:47] what up man God is something else this
[1:10:51] goes beyond church this goes beyond me
[1:10:54] me wearing suits this goes my
[1:10:56] relationship with the Lord is more
[1:10:59] is more greater than anything
[1:11:02] more greater than anything is when you
[1:11:05] find out that God is calling you
[1:11:07] personally
[1:11:09] the Deep call it to the Deep
[1:11:11] why are you acting this way because God
[1:11:13] is calling you personally
[1:11:16] what a beautiful thing amen
[1:11:18] amen he said
[1:11:21] how much there's something and he says
[1:11:23] this in the things that are to be and
[1:11:25] that message things that are to be man
[1:11:27] it is something else
[1:11:29] because there he he talks about how we
[1:11:32] were with him in the beginning
[1:11:34] it's strange because his message is
[1:11:36] things that are to be but he goes back
[1:11:38] to the beginning
[1:11:40] he says if you want to see what's going
[1:11:41] to happen over there you got to see what
[1:11:43] happened over here
[1:11:45] in order to know where we're going back
[1:11:47] to
[1:11:49] he says there's something in US calls us
[1:11:52] to live
[1:11:53] and there's something in us to do right
[1:11:55] and God will call somebody on the
[1:11:58] platform of their pulpit and will preach
[1:12:00] the absolute truth why see it shows you
[1:12:04] then if you are a real child of God you
[1:12:07] begin to cry out God take this away from
[1:12:10] me circumcise me from this take these
[1:12:13] things away from me why it's needed
[1:12:17] that boy needed sulfur it's needed for
[1:12:21] your heavenly home that you're going to
[1:12:24] when he's gone to prepare gone on to
[1:12:27] prepare you've got to be a real word
[1:12:29] bride of Christ
[1:12:31] that cry is a need
[1:12:34] of life
[1:12:35] it's a need well God take this this
[1:12:38] thing away from me and you're not
[1:12:39] knowing that that it's needed for your
[1:12:41] heavenly home it's needed for your
[1:12:43] theophany it's needed to go back to God
[1:12:45] Amen
[1:12:46] amen so you begin to do strange things
[1:12:49] you know every time we progress as
[1:12:53] Christians something begins to happen in
[1:12:55] heaven
[1:12:56] that's that's just the way it's always
[1:12:58] been heaven and earth begin to cry out
[1:13:00] to one another there's a deep calling to
[1:13:02] the deep and in the whole Bible there's
[1:13:05] God's revelation of his word that cry
[1:13:08] would come out in every age and Noah's
[1:13:11] time in Abraham's time in Jacobs and
[1:13:14] Isaacs in everybody's time God would
[1:13:17] reveal himself in one way or another
[1:13:20] or if I could say in a certain form he
[1:13:23] would reveal himself
[1:13:25] right he revealed to Moses as the pillar
[1:13:28] of Fire
[1:13:30] as as the fire on Mount Sinai in the in
[1:13:33] the burning bush also he revealed
[1:13:36] himself to Abraham as Melchizedek he
[1:13:38] revealed himself to Joshua as the
[1:13:40] captain of the lord of the host he
[1:13:42] revealed himself in a certain way he
[1:13:46] shows himself to people and every time
[1:13:49] he would go and he would show his glory
[1:13:51] or he would reveal his word to them it
[1:13:53] would project them and it would take
[1:13:56] them from the their condition to another
[1:13:59] condition
[1:14:00] every time God would reveal himself to
[1:14:03] them it would change him from one place
[1:14:06] to another
[1:14:07] and that's God's agenda every time God
[1:14:10] has to reveal himself God has to show
[1:14:13] himself in order so that we can be
[1:14:14] tooken out of the condition that we that
[1:14:16] we are in
[1:14:17] and and if you notice
[1:14:20] that
[1:14:22] that in the seven Church ages that's
[1:14:24] what God did
[1:14:26] and those last three ages that's when
[1:14:28] the birth of Jesus Christ begin to
[1:14:30] happen
[1:14:31] with Luther's age it was justification
[1:14:34] water
[1:14:36] right then it was blood with
[1:14:38] sanctification then it was the Holy
[1:14:39] Ghost
[1:14:41] and every time that word was revealed it
[1:14:44] changed them
[1:14:46] from this this um time of Catholicism
[1:14:49] and nickelodeonism and all of this stuff
[1:14:52] where it changed them and showed no you
[1:14:54] are justified by faith and IT project a
[1:14:58] people a bride in that little age
[1:15:01] to be justified and it projected them to
[1:15:04] be justified
[1:15:06] because that's what God revealed just a
[1:15:09] little portion of his glory
[1:15:11] then in in sanctification he revealed
[1:15:15] more
[1:15:16] he said no you know what there's more to
[1:15:18] this
[1:15:19] you have to be Sanctified you just just
[1:15:22] not justified but now you have to be
[1:15:24] clean
[1:15:25] so what happened in that justified State
[1:15:28] God revealed his word a little bit more
[1:15:31] and said you need a little bit more and
[1:15:34] what did it do it changed the people
[1:15:35] that were ready to receive it and it
[1:15:38] changed them into that Sanctified state
[1:15:41] and whenever that time of Pentecost came
[1:15:43] God says I'm going to reveal myself a
[1:15:45] little more
[1:15:47] and it projected them to Pentecost to
[1:15:49] the Holy Ghost
[1:15:51] and it continues and continues until
[1:15:53] this day
[1:15:55] this day God isn't going to reveal
[1:15:58] himself in portion but it's the mystery
[1:16:01] of all things it says
[1:16:03] so where are we supposed to be at
[1:16:06] where is the Christian supposed to be at
[1:16:08] then
[1:16:09] we're stepping into that body change
[1:16:13] it has to
[1:16:14] because there's not another message
[1:16:16] there's not another word anymore
[1:16:19] God has to show himself in full view in
[1:16:23] full Glory
[1:16:24] so that whenever we see that Glory we
[1:16:27] become That Glory
[1:16:29] and we'll become just like Jesus Christ
[1:16:32] amen
[1:16:34] I don't want to hold you guys too long
[1:16:35] but um IT projects us so when Heaven and
[1:16:40] Earth
[1:16:41] they begin to cry out that's why the
[1:16:43] Bible says whenever a person is saved
[1:16:46] what does it what happens
[1:16:48] Heavens begin to throw a party
[1:16:51] what was it it was a deep calling to the
[1:16:53] Deep you you don't know but you're in
[1:16:55] your bedside or you're in the couch and
[1:16:57] you said Lord I'm tired of my life you
[1:17:00] don't know that all of eternity all of
[1:17:02] angels saying praise the Lord
[1:17:05] Little John he already finally came up
[1:17:08] he was before the foundation of the
[1:17:10] world and finally the light has touched
[1:17:13] him
[1:17:13] finally he's coming back to us coming
[1:17:16] back to Eternity
[1:17:18] imagine that
[1:17:20] whenever you give your heart to the Lord
[1:17:22] Brother Branham says when people begin
[1:17:24] to have face to face with God he comes
[1:17:28] to himself
[1:17:29] he realizes who he is
[1:17:32] praise God
[1:17:34] amen um
[1:17:38] brother Branham also says which is a
[1:17:40] very
[1:17:41] man I cannot wrap my head around it and
[1:17:43] I wouldn't never try but he says that
[1:17:46] when we recognize the very word this is
[1:17:48] on who is this Melchizedek he said after
[1:17:50] you recognize the very word was Eagle
[1:17:52] food then you've left the other thing
[1:17:54] you have been formed
[1:17:56] what is going on you're being formed
[1:17:59] when you eat that word
[1:18:01] you're formed into that Living Image he
[1:18:04] says of the Living God you heard from
[1:18:07] your theophany
[1:18:08] wow
[1:18:10] what an amazing thing
[1:18:13] that that something to me
[1:18:16] don't be discouraged by
[1:18:18] getting yourself into this word
[1:18:21] there's so much
[1:18:23] there's so much more
[1:18:26] there's so much more in this word than
[1:18:28] we ever know
[1:18:31] I'm telling you
[1:18:33] I haven't even scratched the surface
[1:18:37] there's so much in there
[1:18:39] in this word and the more word you get
[1:18:42] the you begins to form you
[1:18:44] into what that Living Image
[1:18:47] why just like as a as a mother whenever
[1:18:50] she's uh about to have a child what
[1:18:53] happens she begins to eat the uh things
[1:18:57] that she needs in order to form the baby
[1:19:01] she eats things maybe
[1:19:04] um things that have more iron things
[1:19:06] that have more magnesium things that
[1:19:07] have more potassium whatever it is she
[1:19:09] begins to feed herself what is she doing
[1:19:12] she's forming that child Out of the Dust
[1:19:14] of the ground
[1:19:16] all of the elements that are of the
[1:19:18] ground she begins to feed herself of
[1:19:21] I've even heard stories of women eating
[1:19:24] clay
[1:19:26] because they needed that for that baby
[1:19:29] so so they begin to eat these strange
[1:19:32] things and people might say wow that is
[1:19:34] eating ice cream or ketchup or whatever
[1:19:37] it might be but they begin to eat
[1:19:40] certain things why because the baby
[1:19:42] needs it
[1:19:43] and every time she she feeds herself
[1:19:46] that baby begins to be formed in her
[1:19:48] belly
[1:19:49] every time we feed on that word
[1:19:52] every time you feed on that revealed
[1:19:54] word of God that Christ in you begins to
[1:19:57] be formed
[1:19:58] and you're formed forming him and
[1:20:01] forming and informing until you see him
[1:20:04] and you become just like him
[1:20:06] what a beautiful thing amen
[1:20:09] amen Heaven and Earth will will meet
[1:20:12] let us stand to our feet I I have so
[1:20:15] much more but I feel
[1:20:16] that this is okay
[1:20:19] um
[1:20:20] you know the whole earth is groaning it
[1:20:24] says for the manifestations of the sons
[1:20:25] of God
[1:20:27] so so nature
[1:20:30] because remember God cursed the ground
[1:20:33] so and we are linked to the ground and
[1:20:37] we have that element that is linked to
[1:20:39] God
[1:20:40] so the Earth is looking at you
[1:20:43] the the creature the trees everything is
[1:20:47] looking at you
[1:20:49] because you are that link
[1:20:53] to Eternity and they say when they
[1:20:55] change we know will change too
[1:20:58] we'll know everything will be all right
[1:21:00] when we see the sons of God be manifest
[1:21:05] so we have we have it says we are
[1:21:08] compassed about a cloud of witnesses
[1:21:12] we are compassed about and that's
[1:21:15] that always was strange to me
[1:21:18] because sometimes we do what we're
[1:21:21] supposed to do
[1:21:23] we do what we have to do in our daily
[1:21:25] lives
[1:21:27] father he goes to work
[1:21:29] he does what he has to do he puts in his
[1:21:32] eight hours his 12 hours whatever it is
[1:21:34] he does over time just so that he can
[1:21:36] help then he comes to church maybe he
[1:21:39] picks up the offering
[1:21:41] he goes back to his life
[1:21:44] mother she takes care of the children
[1:21:47] and she does the laundry she she cooks
[1:21:51] she does what she has to do and they do
[1:21:54] the best they can I know we do the best
[1:21:56] we can
[1:21:58] and sometimes we ask ourselves Lord is
[1:22:01] this enough
[1:22:03] my little portion my little my little
[1:22:06] thing that I'm doing here in church
[1:22:09] maybe nobody cares maybe they do
[1:22:13] but maybe we feel like nobody cares Lord
[1:22:16] I'm just I'm just hearing I'm a nobody
[1:22:19] father and I'm just here to fulfill my
[1:22:21] little portion and sometimes maybe it
[1:22:23] feels like like nobody cares
[1:22:28] you know in Hebrews I believe it was
[1:22:30] Hebrews 10 or was it was the Hall of
[1:22:33] Faith right
[1:22:34] it's said by faith Abraham did this
[1:22:37] by faith Gideon Barack
[1:22:40] all of these people they did these
[1:22:43] things by faith but it said that that
[1:22:47] they were what did it say you know what
[1:22:50] I'm going to go to it real quick if you
[1:22:51] don't mind
[1:22:54] it was chapter 11 right brother okay
[1:22:57] [Music]
[1:23:02] in the end of the chapter this is what
[1:23:05] it says
[1:23:07] all these having obtained a good report
[1:23:10] through faith received what not the
[1:23:14] promise
[1:23:16] having provided some better thing for us
[1:23:21] that without us they without um they
[1:23:25] without us should not be made perfect
[1:23:29] my little insignificant insignificant
[1:23:32] job
[1:23:34] my little work
[1:23:36] my little thing that I'm doing for the
[1:23:38] Lord
[1:23:40] they're not made perfect without me
[1:23:44] then in chapter 12 it starts off strange
[1:23:48] because it starts with a therefore
[1:23:51] or aware for
[1:23:53] now we don't start sentences that way
[1:23:56] so we know that there's a continuation
[1:23:59] of the last chapter
[1:24:02] so it said that they without us are not
[1:24:05] made perfect
[1:24:07] therefore
[1:24:09] seeing that we are also compassed about
[1:24:12] a cloud of witnesses
[1:24:14] when you feel like you're alone folding
[1:24:16] those those clothes when you feel like
[1:24:18] Lord am I in my post of Duty am I doing
[1:24:21] this Lord does this matter
[1:24:24] there's people in the edge of Heaven
[1:24:28] saying we will not be paid perfect if
[1:24:31] you don't do what you do
[1:24:33] you're compassed about a cloud of
[1:24:36] witnesses saying come on get up keep
[1:24:38] going son keep going daughter
[1:24:41] Abraham Isaac Jacob David Solomon all of
[1:24:45] them are in the edge of Heaven saying we
[1:24:47] will not be made perfect without you
[1:24:51] think about it all of the Heaven and
[1:24:54] Earth are in anticipation of what you're
[1:24:57] going to do
[1:24:58] what is it a deep calling to a deep
[1:25:02] there's groanings in the world there's
[1:25:04] earthquakes there's things going on
[1:25:05] crying out for your manifestation
[1:25:09] calling for you to become
[1:25:12] what you're always meant to be
[1:25:16] let's bow our heads

[1:25:46] the one seeking so if they have a desire
[1:25:48] to have more to be more to to have more

[1:27:16] creation
