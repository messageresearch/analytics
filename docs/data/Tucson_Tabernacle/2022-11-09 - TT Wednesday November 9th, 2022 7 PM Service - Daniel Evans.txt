him just now he is just absolutely precious young man loves the Lord filled with the Holy Spirit and moving in the right direction greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we have a special blessing tonight the greatest blessing is going to be when I open this book and and read the Bible but I think that we're going to have a the Lord's going to give us a nice foundation for the word brother Nathan you have a testimony for us and brother Nathan Roberts asked to give a testimony before and I thought it was a perfect time right now God bless you God bless you all tonight so I just I had quite the day today and I figured that I needed to share it just felt like a good night but um brother Peter said I was quoting Psalms 23 in between songs there though I walked through the valley of the shadow of death of fear no evil right he's with us but I woke up this morning and uh I just looked on my phone and saw a bunch of my investments all crashed down lost a bunch of money on that and I'm like oh well that's okay he gives any taketh away that's okay going through the day I'm getting my stuff done I'm doing my homework I go get I got a new motorcycle a couple of weeks ago they get home and then riding it put a whole I put 1600 miles on it already it's been two weeks it's been riding it having so much fun went on Mount Lemmon uh so I take it and I was washing it this afternoon and I washed it and I set it there and I go take a shower and get ready for church and go out and I get on my bike and I put on my helmet and I'm wearing what I was or I was wearing what I'm wearing now I go out in front of my house onto my street and I'm going about 15 forward and uh then I accelerate to about 25 and as I'm going through the middle of the road where they have it tarred over for where they fixed the road there was uh something slick uh and when I when I gave it a little more gas my back tire flew out from under me and the bike just went skirting down the road at about 20 miles an hour uh and I just was sitting there and in the middle of the road and I was holding the brake handle and my hand is it because it fell off and uh the only scratch I had on me was right here and that that's it and just it's good to see that uh he's here with me he's keeping me safe and I just like to be reminded of that and I wanted to share a verse and I know it's going to be new to you you've never heard it before uh brother Peter if you could put it up it's uh Romans 8 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose and I just know that everything works out for the good and so even though I lost some money this morning and I'm just messed up my brand new bike and uh it's okay and I the only I'm wearing slacks right now and there's about two holes this big on them and no scratches on my legs so that's it and uh about 15 minutes later I got in my car to drive here and I got a call uh and it was an acceptance uh for an offer I put out and the guy was calling me and said I got the con track and I'm gonna be setting up his weather station and a bunch of other electronic stuff for him and so even though I lost stuff it's like oh well that just fixed everything it's like now I fixed the bike now I got my stuff back and I just thought that it was uh it was pretty amazing where it could have been anywhere I I was driving here and I see it you know probably 10 cops out and it's raining and uh there was two times where someone came about this close from hitting me on the freeway in my car and it's like well I went down and I was just sitting there in the middle of the road right 20 feet from my house and maybe if I was to drive it here to church today then I would have been in the middle of the freeway so just gotta really give it to him and appreciate him that he's just there with us so uh no I just I just uh want to share that and I appreciate it so if I could just say a quick prayer real quick but dear Lord Jesus thank you for being with us Lord we really appreciate you and that you're able to carry us through the day and even when things might seem like they're out of place and might seem like it's unfortunate lord well we just know that you're right there and we wouldn't have anything to lose if you didn't give it to us in the first place and we keep your promises and our cup runneth over so I just wanna say how much I appreciate that it really blessed me every day and I just like to be reminded of it in Jesus Christ's name amen thank you you know what means the most to me about that testimony the Lord protected our brother he had his hands on him but the thing that means the most to me is a young man of that age will stand up in front of this church and give glory to the Lord Jesus even though it was a hard day even though he he um had a couple losses he put the Lord first and gave glory for the good thing that happened today that makes me God bless you my brother I wish we had a lot more young people like you and Daniel don't even think about getting a motorcycle [Laughter] I'm glad that my boy he's uh he's here from Jeffersonville and and he's here permanent now as at least as permanent as I can keep him here let's all stand let's read the scripture I want to speak this morning on what Legacy will you leave James chapter 4 verse 14. it says this James 4 14 whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow for what is your life it is even a vapor that appeareth for a little time and then vanish away father we thank you for this good day thank you for the testimony for my dear brother and Lord we thank you for your word that I just read and may your blessings be added to it tonight in Jesus Christ's name amen you can take your seats again God bless you all it's good it's good to be here tonight brother Joe who is this kid right here my brother God bless you welcome home this is your church I hope you feel welcome it's an honor to have you praise the Lord good wonderful I I got my wife out of this church a long time ago a lot a lot of special things have happened here it's good to have you back I want to see you like to see more of your face here um I was uh I've been traveling been ministering in different parts of the country and um Ben I got back and I was tired and I was kind of just didn't have much left in me brother Aaron sent me a text and he said can you um can you Minister Wednesday night and I said uh let me tell you tomorrow let me let me sleep on it and tell you the truth I wanted I just wanted a little bit of time to relax and really well you know how it is you spend a lot of time in putting these these sermons together and and I was just tired and and teachers I didn't have anything to bring to the church whatsoever I I just it's like Lord I don't know I don't I don't know about anything how can I how can I bring something to the church I just I just don't have it and I woke up the next morning and I said my call brother Aaron I'm going to tell him you know over there and I can't I don't uh I just don't have anything I'd like to like to rest and and um I made a commitment some time ago that I put the Tabernacle first that if I would if I would have an invitation to speak here that I would take this invitation and if I didn't have an invitation then I would I would speak in other places so brother why I didn't want to I made that commitment to myself and I just didn't want to break it you know so I I drive to work and I park in the in the parking garage and I'm walking to my office and this it's kind of it's still dark the sun's just starting to come up and I'm I'm going and I'm saying I can't I don't I don't have anything I'm going to call brother Aaron and I'm just going to relax and and just go and hear hear a tape or hear one of the brothers preach and and as I was walking along the sidewalks something said and and friends I don't say it was the Lord that's a big statement to say the Lord told me so I'm not it's it's if you if I say Lord told you the Lord the Lord told me the Lord really did tell me but this I I had this thought that came to my mind as I was walking and it said what about absalom's tomb and I said I said yeah I said um that was a really bad deal this absalom's pillar and kept walking and I said I said but Lord I uh I'm just tired and it's Wednesday night and and there won't be there won't be very many people there and something said will there be one I said yeah yeah they'll be one okay okay so I get I get back up to my my office and I started praying about what to speak on tonight and I wanted to speak on what Legacy we will leave and you know one of my weaknesses and I got a lot of kind of wear my weaknesses out of my out of my shirt sleeves everybody can see them one of the weaknesses I have is is I'll start thinking about something and and it immediately I can't do it I can't put this sermon together and it's just like I can't do it I can't do it and and I'll keep trying and and it's just always there that you can't do it and I remember when I was in the ministry in Jeffersonville I um I wrote All The Catch the vision magazines I wrote them from cover to cover and I remember sitting at my desk and saying I can't do it there's no way there's I can't even think of one word to put together how can I put together a whole magazine and I just sit down brother Joe and I just start writing and it would just it would just start start coming and and the Lord would provide and I think so often why do I get so uptight I can sit down in my chair and open this book and wherever I turn there's a sermon there and it will happen every single time it doesn't matter if I'm in second Kings or Leviticus or second Samuel there is a sermon everywhere in this Bible from Genesis to revelation and I thought I've heard it's said before that we can't understand this Bible without someone to interpret it to us I do not believe that this Bible says this it says in in second Timothy 3 16 it says that all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness now if you don't have the Holy Spirit then I can understand that but the prophet said that God is his own interpreter did he say that have you heard him say that so why cannot God interpret this scripture to me but Joe he can't and I was thinking and why do I why do I get so so worried and so upset about this all I have to do is just open up this word but Jeremy and it just flows you know how it is it just feels good in in reading this word and thinking on these things and uh I I love that the prophet taught us that we can go to this Bible and that we are not Catholic the Catholics teach they have always taught throughout history that the common man cannot understand this book in fact they took all of the original manuscripts which were written in Hebrew and in Greek most of them and they translated them into Latin why did they translate them into Latin because nobody spoke Latin that's why they translated them into that only the highest educated priests spoke Latin and then you know what they did with the manuscript they burned them they got rid of them because us common people couldn't understand this word we had to have a priest explain it to us that is a lie and let me tell you that's everywhere you can open this Bible each one of us you don't need me or a priest or anybody else to have this Bible to understand this you get it yourself that's why you spend the time in doing this don't just sit in the in the Pew and listen to the preacher three times a week no you get into it you understand it you have that relationship with Christ now God does send gifts into the church and to help us to understand these things to help us to teach these things he sends teachers and pastors to help us to understand what's in this Bible but ultimately all of us have to have that relationship all of us have to understand it and uh the gifts that God places in the church are to promote a relationship with Christ not develop a relationship between us or not to bring a dependence on this Pulpit right here but to get a dependence on God himself I think of some of these great men in the past that have left incredible Legacies I think of John Wycliffe John Wycliffe took this Latin Vulgate and he translated it in English took the bible translated into English and he said I want everybody to be able to read this and you know what the Catholic Church did they burned him they killed him and then we have other people we have John Huss took the mantle one of the people to have it we see we see Martin Luther we all have heard of Martin Luther Martin Luther took the original Greek in Hebrew and he translated into German at the same time there's another man named William Tyndale he translated the Bible into English so we could have it they left this Legacy so that people could themselves read this book and understand it they killed Tyndale too they they hated it and that's spirit's here today you gotta have you got to have this guy in the Pulpit or you can't understand it that's a lie you get it for yourself or this guy's a failure all right you with me I'm a success brother while we are a success if we can get the people to read this book and and to understand it I was as I was going over and asking Lord what do you want me do you want me to minister what what do you want me to minister on and I've been thinking about this last sermon that I preached here on the talents in Matthew 25 and how these talents are a sum of money that they had the one guy with one Talent the other two the other guy with five talents and um they uh these talents are worth about a million bucks a piece that have great value and I was thinking about the one man he buried this these talents this talent in the ground and how he was just an ultimate failure he ended up in hell this man these other two men they they doubled what God had given them they worked hard for the Lord I was thinking thinking on on these things and and wondering Lord in leaving these talents what good do they do well there is a legacy that needs to be left from each one of us I was just talking with brother Peter in the back and we were talking about what are we going to leave our children if God tarries what is this world going to look like in 10 years 20 years with the thing the way things are going on right now what are we going to do and what are we going to leave for our children and our children's children it's not looking good as far as the world goes and I was I was thinking about this man named Absalom Absalom was I believe David's third son and he was a man that was young man full of charisma I mean he knew how to speak and he was the best looking guy in the whole country the Bible says this Rachel he didn't have a blemish from the bottom of his foot to the top of his head good looking dude stay away from that kind of guy though but he was he was just he was perfect and and what he did is is his brother committed a sin against his sister and he waited two years and he ends up getting his servants to kill his brother murder him whether his brother deserved it or not that wasn't for him to decide or anybody else so he ends up killing his brother and he got exiled for doing it so he he has to leave and then David kind of gets tricked into allowing this young man to come back in the area of the city and so Absalom stayed by the gate as people would come in and Absalom was a very wise young man and when these people would come in they knew that his name well he was David's son so he automatically had a lot of respect so as the people would come in AB someone would say hey I can judge your problems for you because you're going to be waiting in line forever for the king so why don't you just let me handle these things he had a lot of wisdom so he was successful in doing this and he started to get the support of the people right so Absalom started to get puffed up and let me tell you this young man was a spoiled brat he was not a good person did not have the character anywhere close to the character that his dad had so he starts he starts judging he starts gaining power and then he decides he wants the whole Kingdom so Absalom makes his move the people get behind him David ends up leaving his own City in Exile sad it would take I think he had 600 men with him so he goes and he leaves and uh they end up David was a wise man and a warrior and David ends up winning this battle that ultimately comes from his battle with his son he um if you want to read it what I've been talking about is in second Samuel 13. through 18 those chapters so I'd encourage you to read this story about this man Absalom but let's turn to second Samuel chapter 18. so what happened I think it's kind of a it's probably a kind of a famous story most people probably know what happened they were in battle Absalom who had all of this hair he's he's writing in battle and he gets his hair stuck in the oak tree and he gets knocked off his horse and he's hanging there in the oak tree and joab David's General comes up and he kills Absalom and it devastated David this was the man that had taken David's Kingdom this is the man that had done that had double-crossed and lied and cheated and took his kingdom and look at the Spirit of Christ in David verse number 33 says this and the King was much moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept and as he went thus he said oh my son Absalom my son my son Absalom I would God I had died for thee o Absalom my son my son look at Jesus Christ right there in the King David my son and look at of all of our sins that we commit and yet in all the sins we've committed against the king and yet our lord Jesus says my son my son I would die for you the difference between David and Jesus is Jesus actually did he took he took the cross so that we might live and we look at the different Legacy between these two men this Bible says and David was a man after God's Own Heart and Jesus himself is called the son of David how great of a man is this King David this man who killed he killed this giant Philistine he won thousands of battles for the Lord and he left a legacy as great as anyone in the book To Where Christians even Muslims and Jews they admire this man David this Legacy that this David developed goes until this day some 3000 years later but what I want to talk about first is this man absalom's Legacy it says here in second Samuel 18 18. now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar which is in the Kingsdale for he said I have no son to keep my name in remembrance and he called the pillar after his own name and it is called unto this day absalom's place now I preached about a few weeks ago when I was here I preached about the talents and I talked about Jesus coming down from the mount from the Temple Mount he walked down into this Kidron I think it's a Kidron Valley right he walked down into Kidron Valley came up the other side and they looked back up at all of these beautiful buildings up there well I was there in that place a few years ago and their in this Kidron Valley there is this absolutely beautiful Monument brother Jordan if you'd show that first picture this Monument is called absalom's pillar and you say there you see right there this is what represents this place that Absalom built up to himself now I know brother Lyle that that brother Lyle was going to say well actually brother Daniel that is from the second temple period because of of the architecture there and it's only probably 2 000 years old rather than three thousand years old but when it was excavated and brother Lyle you would be right not to put not to put words in your mouth but it represents to this day when they first found it they thought that this was absalom's pillar that he built and over the years this place women and fathers mothers and fathers would take their children to this pillar and they would throw stones at the pillar and they would disrespect it because and they would tell their children this is what happens to a disobedient child and when I was there when I when I went to this place everything in Jerusalem is is clean when I went to this place behind there I saw trash I saw it smelled bad there the place was a place of disrespect was not clean it was it was it was a bad it was a bad place and and I was as I was reading about I said oh that's because this is absalom's legacy right here that this man built this thing up for himself so that I can have this Legacy and thank you brother Jordan that's that's good till we go to the next picture that's that's good so I was thinking about this as I was walking down the sidewalk and I was thinking and I was thinking about my experience there and the filth that was part of that monument and I was like Lord that was bad that that that Legacy to that man was bad and I then brother Kurt I started thinking about this election that was coming up that we had yesterday and I was thinking what are these politicians that are running on these things what Legacy are they going to create for this United States of America they're running on things like legalizing drugs they're running on things like entitlements for the people so that they don't have to work then just stay home and collect a paycheck they're running on these these things just to buy a vote when this book says here in first Timothy Chapter 5 that if someone doesn't provide for his own especially his own his own family he has denied the faith in his worse than an unbeliever and yet they're running on these pretenses that oh you don't have to work you can just collect a check there's for second Thessalonians says this is a that if a man If any man would not work neither should he eat let me tell you there'd be a lot less homelessness if we'd enforce that today but these are what these politicians are running on and imagine and even today they're saying well even our president and I I've said don't speak against dignities and don't don't speak against the president you know don't complain about these things but it's sin what they are running on they're running on transgender rights they're running on these horrible these horrible things and what are we leaving what will they leave for the Next Generation in this country what would this country look like in 10 years electing the people that we are electing and voting on the things that we are voting on if if a boy doesn't want to be a boy you can just switch over and be a girl now same thing with a girl wanting to be a boy how messed up are these things and they're running on these tickets and getting votes for them you know we think about we think about brother Branham and he got a lot of criticism for for preaching about about uh women having long hair and about a man being a man but do you think that maybe God knew that in 60 years that this would be happening and he wanted to warn us we get legalistic about it and we say oh you have to have this cut hair and this this type of skirt but we missed the whole point God was warning us that this time here now today is coming who would have merely who would have ever saw 30 20 30 40 years ago what we see today it's awful and we have Paul running on these things running on these terrible formats and pushing this stuff down our throats and getting votes and getting elected and we're voting them in where do you think this country is going to be in 10 years let me tell you what the prophet said he said this the last and seventh vision was wherein I heard a most terrible explosion and as I turned to look I saw nothing but debris craters and smoke all over the land of America the seventh vision that he had in 1933 we're there we it is right around the corner and it you know I hear people sometimes they're like oh great there's going to be an earthquake and all these people are going to die and all this this is gonna California is gonna sink and there's gonna be a an earthquake in Los Angeles and and all of this I don't want to see it happen I don't want to see people die I don't want to see all of this apostasy and this filth and all of this in this country brother Joe I love this country this country has been good to me it's allowed it to where I can make a living and I can prosper and I can preach the gospel in the pulpit and not worry about the government coming in the door like it does in other places I have a friend I have a friend in Iran Youssef Narda Connie he's been in prison in and out for preaching this same gospel they'll come right in the door and arrest him he spent half three quarters of his life in prison for the past 10 15 years because he preaches this gospel right here I thank God that I don't have to worry about that in this country it breaks my heart brother Kurt that that this is happening to this country you know brother Branham said he always liking Luke 17. Luke 17 says as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man so shall it be in the second coming of Christ what happened in the days of lot what was going on it was Sodom and who had the power we see lot he was in his house and these these two angels came these two young men came and lot was afraid of the mob that came it's because they had the political power he was the mayor of the city and he was afraid and look where we are now we we have to suck it down and they they force it down our throats and there's nothing left but what the prophet said that this place is going to burn behold the day cometh I shall burn us in oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly so shall be stubble but it also says that the righteous shall walk out on the ashes of the wicked it is a terrible day and it makes me sad I don't ever say yay this is wonderful no this is terrible and I have a burden for these people that are going through it and they're deceived but thank God that we have this word that I can go and I can turn to Luke chapter 17. and I could say wow this looks amazingly like today and it does I uh think about absalom's Legacy you know we're destroying our economy we're destroying our morals and I think about a man like Absalom his legacy is nothing but destruction it's all about me and how I can promote myself and if nothing but destruction follows and look at the world today it's all about this I work on campus at the U of A I don't know how these people walk around how they don't run into the wall all the time with all the pictures they're taken of themselves it's all the time you know so selfies and and and posting on on all the social media and all that it's like good night that has never been the case well obviously they didn't have these things before but but it's never the Vanity's never been the case like it is today and we see it it's a warning we're there we have arrived and it's a sad day no matter it's terrible to look around and see what's going on in our world I think of absalom's Legacy 20 000 people David's own people died because of this Insurrection because he wanted to be somebody he was the King's son he was the most qualified he'd have probably been king after David but no he wanted his own thing he wanted it now if you'd have prayed about it you would have saw what kind of a great man his dad was things would have been different but there's another tomb that's next to that one for the wild that that pillar and this tomb is from the prophet Zechariah again it's probably not the same one um but they still call it Zacharias too I've walked down if you want to show up brother Jordan I walk down from absalom's tomb down the valley a little ways just a few hundred feet and you see this tomb carved out of the rock there and that represents the Tomb of the Prophet Zechariah this man also has a legacy do you see all of these great do you see all of those stone that stone work behind it those are Graves those are tombs those tombs are about this wide about this long and about this wide and that is where these Jews are buried and there's like a hundred thousand of those tombs and many of those people are buried there because of the Prophet Zachariah and something that he said let's turn to Zechariah Chapter 14 if you could put it up brother Jordan I mean uh uh brother Peter brother Jordan um Zechariah 14 verse 1 says this behold the day of the Lord cometh and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee for I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle and the city shall be taken and the house is rifled and the women ravished and half of the city shall go forth into captivity and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city then shall the Lord go forth and fight against those Nations as when he fought in the day of battle and his feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives which is before Jerusalem on the East if you put that picture back up that all of those graves are spread across the Mount of Olives and many or most of those people that are buried there are referred to this scripture they say I want to be there when that sun rises over the Mount of Olives and Shines on the Temple Mount and the Messiah comes down I want to be buried there look at look at the Legacy of the Prophet Zechariah even Jesus himself spoke about Zechariah in Matthew 23 he says this Matthew 23 35 . Jesus as I preached last time I was talking about him being in the temple and and the last sermons that he preached in public and he jumped all over the priests and he says this he said that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the Earth from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of barakayas whom you slew between the temple and the altar speaking of this man that has the tomb right there that I showed a legacy a great legacy of a great man of God and I think about us the Legacy that we need to leave to those that are behind us and it's not too late the wrath of God can be stayed there needs to be more people come in to the Gospel of Jesus Christ but we have to be a man like Zechariah we have to be someone that is willing to put ourselves second and to put God first I want to mention I want to mention a a sister and we talk about the brothers sometimes we get up here and we preach we're talking about David and Goliath and we want to talk about Moses and we're going to talk about all these great prophets of God but there are some great women of God too and I want to talk about a couple women that nobody I've ever really heard talk about these are special ladies that were so special that they were recorded in this book by the Apostle Paul let's go to Second Timothy chapter one verse 5. this is the Apostle Paul speaking to his Protege Timothy who became the Pastor Paul is training this young man and he says this he says when I call to remember it's the faith the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois and thy mother Eunice I am persuaded that in the in thee also look at the Legacy that Lois and her daughter Eunice left there's also there was obviously something special about these two sisters they had this great amount of faith and and they they the lowest they were taught her daughter and then her daughter taught their son Timothy and I always wonder what about Timothy's dad it doesn't even mention Timothy's dad it says that you are this great man you're this Legacy because of your mama and your grandma how wonderful how important it is that we live a life worthy of this gospel that I raise my son and my daughter to love this word because who knows what they are going to do in the future who knows what Legacy what is going to happen from this Legacy and we look at Timothy Timothy's one in my opinion from what Paul wrote in his instructions and how Paul when he wrote him two letters and he he laid out the church he said this is how you do it everything from pastors to deacons to to prayer to all of these things he laid this out and he knew how great Timothy was because he knew his mama and his grandma great women of God creating a legacy in children sister look at those kids they're giving testimonies you know these Rob Roberts kids God bless them here at church on Wednesday night and all the all the miles that they drive just to be here praise the Lord building a legacy for a day to come if there is one I feel so bad about what we're leaving our children I feel so bad about this country I feel like the brother Branham said that the back was broke broken when we took Mama out of the family and and we didn't have love in raising our kids anymore because mom was gone and I look at it and I as I've said before I work on campus at the University oh it just Grieves me I think oh Lord but their souls you know and I love them and I want to I want to represent the Lord Jesus to them you know anybody that ever says you know if if they go to to Walmart or or wherever and they say oh it just Grieves me so bad all these people well what are you doing about it you're just going to let them die in their sins no I believe it was Ezekiel that said that that there was a Watchman that God said a Watchman on the hill and he tells that Watchman he says if you don't warn the people you will be guilty of their blood and you'll answer for it but if you do warn them then you'll be free if they still sin friends we need to warn people in a loving way in a right way to win these people for the Lord because the Legacy that we leave is going to last either for eternity or it's going to be like this pillar erected by this man David's son who was nothing but a disgrace to this day and like I said if you ever go to Israel and you go to that Monument it's just different it's a different feeling there it took me back when I was there I thought why is all this you don't see trash anywhere there's even graffiti back in there you never see anything like that and I looked it's like this this dirty and the people disrespecting that that I read the stories about how the children throw rocks at the monument because they disrespect this is what happens to a disobedient child this is where they end up I want my legacy I want it to mean something I want I want this church I want this church to be a monument to Jesus Christ in this day what what friends if the Lord goes on 20 years what were the Tucson Tabernacle be where are we going to be we have to work we have to leave a legacy for our children or is it our Legacy is just going to be well it just kind of faded away everybody got old and they left no this has to be a legacy for a generation to come we have to be that Legacy we have to build and move forward because look at this world coming down around us as I said we have arrived we've arrived to Luke chapter 17. as it was in the days of lot these days of Sodom were there we've arrived I am I'm going to close I got about halfway through my notes and and I had in my notes I wanted to talk about brother branham's Legacy and and I wanted to talk about um how we see these Skeptics attacking and trying to destroy his legacy we see the so-called count can cancel culture how you just erase history and you change it and then I see we have these over here trying to attack him and to lie about him and then we see this side over here doing just as much damage to his ministry by saying he's infallible and he's perfect and he never made a mistake and doing this damage over here trying to hold him to a a standard that nobody could live up to all it does is hurt his ministry it throws doubt on it that's a that's one of the worst things you could do to him leave him alone don't attack him like that from either side I wanted I wanted to talk about that I wanted to talk about I want to go under the cloud and and how the the bridge and and I have in my notes a lot of those things but I just I feel like we should uh sister if you want to come to the piano I feel like um maybe we should close a little early tonight and I want to sister Rachel did you say Amen I'm just kidding I was kidding then sister Rachel closing a little early no you just thought it no no I uh I wanted to I wanted to ask the church um a favor I uh and it's a personal favor I've got I've got a friend that um I've mentioned her before and she's got a child that has chronic kidney disease and I prayed for and I really felt like like the Lord heard me but it's gotten worse and I was with Daniel Dan was with me when when we were talking with the the lady and um she's upset that her daughter's in relapse I was thinking Lord where is the god of William Branham that was that was here that people would come and and he would lay his hands on them and they would be healed Lord I want to see that in this young lady and I thought that if we could just get the church together and if we could just have Unity just for a little bit just just maybe for the night for a while if we could just be in one mind and one Accord Jesus prayed in Matthew chapter 17 he was before the Lord he was burdened he was about to go to the cross and he said Lord may they be one As We Are One and he said Lord May the world see your son because of their love one for another to see that we could show that Jesus is the Messiah by our unity and our love one for another and friends I I just believe I just need some help and praying for this this little girl she's seven years old her name's Olivia wanted to be healed so bad I see the pain on the parents and and their searching for the Lord the dad he uh he's open to the gospel and the mom wants to serve the Lord she she wants to go to church but then but then she's she's got the ties and home with with the kid and they're just good they're just good people so friends can we pray together and I also a friend of mine a dear friend as I was driving home from from work I try to call some of
