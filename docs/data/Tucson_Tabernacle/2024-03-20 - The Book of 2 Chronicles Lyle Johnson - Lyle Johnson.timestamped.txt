[32:07] much good evening it's good to see you
[32:10] it's good to see each
[32:12] one
[32:14] tonight oh we have an overview of the
[32:16] book of 2
[32:17] Chronicles as you noticed with First
[32:19] Chronicles a perspective of Chronicles
[32:21] is very different than that of Kings
[32:23] Kings tells a lot about Elijah and
[32:25] Elisha and other prophets it's full of
[32:28] details about the various Kings of
[32:29] Israel as well as Judah Chronicles
[32:33] concerns itself with Kings primarily of
[32:35] Judah their genealogies and only briefly
[32:38] mentions various prophets Elijah for
[32:40] example is mentioned exactly once Elisha
[32:44] not at all in the Jewish Bible called
[32:47] the Tanakh which is an acronym combining
[32:50] the Torah the prophets and what they
[32:52] call the writings Chronicles is the last
[32:55] book not Malachi is in our old Testament
[32:58] ordering Chronicles was perhaps the last
[33:00] book written or edited in the Old
[33:02] Testament prior to its canonization and
[33:04] by that we mean it being accepted as
[33:07] holy writ from God to be read to be
[33:09] studied but not to be edited and not to
[33:12] be
[33:13] altered before we open our Bibles
[33:15] tonight let's speak with the author One
[33:17] More
[33:19] Time Lord Jesus it's a humbling
[33:22] experience to be here Lord to stand
[33:26] before the people that you purchase
[33:28] at an awful price but yet a price you
[33:31] gladly paid for each one Lord we pray
[33:35] that you accept our worship this evening
[33:37] and that Lord you would speak to us
[33:39] through your word Lord tonight it will
[33:41] be mostly your word not very many
[33:44] comments and it's from you Lord that we
[33:47] draw our strength we draw our guidance
[33:49] Lord forgive us where we have fallen
[33:51] short forgive me Lord help my sins help
[33:54] my shortcomings everything about me to
[33:58] just be out of the way Lord that you can
[34:00] speak that you can move Lord Jesus we
[34:03] thank you for your for your love and
[34:05] your grace and Lord we're aware of
[34:07] someone here in the audience who's lost
[34:09] a very dear friend Lord I pray that you
[34:12] would comfort their heart Comfort the
[34:13] hearts of those families Lord just draw
[34:16] Us close to yourself we thank you for
[34:18] each moment that you give us in this
[34:20] life that we can draw breath and serve
[34:22] you we thank you in Jesus precious name
[34:26] amen
[34:29] it's a book of 2 Chronicles so we'll
[34:31] start with a few verses from Hebrews
[34:35] chapter n Paul's writing about the
[34:38] Tabernacle and the Ark which was later
[34:40] placed in the first temple which we'll
[34:42] hear about this evening Hebrews 9 ver1
[34:44] Paul says then verily the first Covenant
[34:47] also had ordinances of divine service
[34:50] and a worldly Sanctuary for there was a
[34:53] tabernacle made the first wherein was
[34:55] the Candlestick and the table and the
[34:57] shoe bread which is called The Sanctuary
[34:59] that's where only priests could go and
[35:01] Minister and after the second Veil The
[35:04] Tabernacle which is called the holiest
[35:06] of
[35:07] all which had the golden sensor and the
[35:11] Ark of the Covenant overlaid round about
[35:13] with gold wherein was the golden pot
[35:16] that had mana and aon's Rod that budded
[35:18] and tables of the
[35:22] Covenant and over it the cherubim of
[35:25] Glory shadowing The Mercy Seat of which
[35:28] we cannot now speak
[35:30] particularly please be
[35:33] seated when we studied the book of Kings
[35:37] we discussed Saul David Solomon in some
[35:40] detail after the nation split we
[35:43] discussed rabam king of Judah and three
[35:46] the Kings of Israel jeroboam Ahab and
[35:51] jahu jeroboam out of fear rejected the
[35:55] Lord's promise and established amazing
[35:57] made up religion something he invented
[35:59] himself with madeup gods and madeup
[36:03] holidays and Idols in the form of Cales
[36:05] and place them in Dan in the north and
[36:08] bethl at the southern part of his
[36:10] territory near Jerusalem we learned of
[36:12] Ahab and his dominant wife Jezebel we
[36:14] saw jahu execute judgment on Ahab
[36:17] Jezebel and ahab's male offspring we
[36:20] touched on the ministries of prophets
[36:22] like Elijah and
[36:24] Elisha First Chronicles provided
[36:26] genealogical information for the first
[36:28] several chapters about various Kings and
[36:30] so forth and and then it focused on King
[36:33] David we learned that David brought the
[36:35] Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem and
[36:37] placed it in a tent it had always been
[36:40] in a tent but this was a new tent that
[36:42] he made for it he then Drew up the plans
[36:44] and started importing the materials
[36:46] needed to build a temple to house it and
[36:48] after a bit of Palace Intrigue he named
[36:51] Solomon as his
[36:54] successor what will we find in second
[36:56] chronicles
[37:02] there it is seems like I located a
[37:04] special Sabbath supplement to the Daily
[37:06] parchment we see some 71
[37:10] headlines 16 of them deal with Solomon
[37:14] almost a quarter of the total apart from
[37:16] Mostly passing references to the
[37:18] Northern Kingdom of Israel this entire
[37:20] book focuses on the kings of the
[37:21] Southern kingdom known as Judah they're
[37:24] not limited to descendants of Jacob's
[37:26] son of that name his clan or tribe 2
[37:29] Chronicles covers a period of just under
[37:32] 400 years from Solomon's Reign starting
[37:35] in 970 BC through the conquest of Israel
[37:38] in 723 BC to the destruction of the
[37:41] temple in
[37:42] 587 uh this evening we'll focus first on
[37:46] Solomon and the temple is that a little
[37:49] hard to
[37:50] see ah no
[37:53] binoculars sitting too far back uh is
[37:57] that
[37:59] better okay so first Solomon there'll be
[38:03] a lot of reading but this is after all a
[38:06] Bible
[38:07] study 2 Chronicles opens on a hope
[38:11] hopeful note we'll see that it closes on
[38:14] a hopeful note as well 2 Chronicles 1
[38:19] and Solomon the son of David was
[38:22] strengthened in his kingdom and the Lord
[38:24] his God was with him and the Lord
[38:26] magnified him
[38:27] exceedingly then Solomon spoke unto all
[38:31] Israel to the captains of thousands and
[38:33] of hundreds to the judges to every
[38:36] governor in all Israel the chief of the
[38:38] fathers he gathered them together so
[38:41] Solomon and all the congregation with
[38:43] him went to the high place that was at
[38:45] gibian for there was the Tabernacle of
[38:48] the congregation of God which Moses the
[38:51] servant of the Lord had made in the
[38:52] wilderness some 450 years prior to this
[38:58] but the Ark of God had David brought up
[39:00] from curiot urum to the place which
[39:03] David had prepared for it for he had
[39:05] pitched a different tent for it at
[39:08] Jerusalem well we read that they gather
[39:10] and they worship with numerous
[39:11] sacrifices and going on to verse 7 and
[39:14] that night did God appear into Solomon
[39:17] God speaks to Solomon twice in his life
[39:20] and said unto him ask what I shall give
[39:23] thee and Solomon said unto God thou Hast
[39:27] showed great Mercy unto David my father
[39:30] and has made me to reign in his stead
[39:32] now oh Lord God let thy promise unto
[39:35] David thy my father be established for
[39:38] thou Hast made me King over a people
[39:40] like the dust of the earth and multitude
[39:42] give me now wisdom knowledge that I may
[39:46] go out and come in before this people
[39:49] for who can judge who can govern who can
[39:51] rule over this thy people that is so
[39:55] great and God said to s man because this
[39:58] was in thine heart and thou Hast not
[40:01] asked riches wealth or honor nor the
[40:04] life of thine enemies neither yet H has
[40:07] asked for long life but has asked wisdom
[40:10] and knowledge for thyself that thou
[40:12] mayest judge my people over whom I have
[40:15] made thee King wisdom and knowledge is
[40:18] granted unto thee that was the good part
[40:22] and I will give thee riches and wealth
[40:24] and honor such as none of the Kings have
[40:27] had that have been before thee neither
[40:29] shall there any after thee have the
[40:31] like that sounds really good Solomon
[40:35] eventually became spiritually
[40:37] impoverished in the midst of
[40:39] extraordinary wealth and
[40:42] Grandeur then Solomon came from his
[40:44] journey to the high place that was at
[40:46] Gideon to Jerusalem from before the
[40:49] Tabernacle of the congregation and
[40:51] reigned over
[40:54] Israel in Chapter 2 Solomon begins
[40:57] construction of the temple which David
[40:59] had designed as we learned in 1
[41:01] Chronicles we find out in chapter 3 that
[41:03] construction began in the second month
[41:06] of his fourth
[41:08] year but there's something in chapter
[41:10] two that I had not noticed before that I
[41:13] thought I'd bring to your attention this
[41:14] evening about the people that built and
[41:16] decorated the temple it says Solomon
[41:19] told out that means he counted out or
[41:21] assigned or conscripted 3 score and
[41:24] 10,000 70,000 men to bear birth burdens
[41:27] carry stuff
[41:29] around and four score th000 80,000 to
[41:32] heue in the mountain to be Stone Cutters
[41:34] to quarry stone this is all hard work
[41:37] and 3,600 to oversee to supervise them
[41:41] that's
[41:42] 153,00 in total we'll get back to that
[41:45] number in a moment and Solomon sent to
[41:47] ham the king of tyer saying as thou did
[41:50] deal with David my father and just send
[41:53] him Cedars to build him and house to
[41:55] dwell therein even so deal with me
[41:58] behold I I build a house to the name of
[42:00] the Lord my God to dedicate it to him
[42:02] and to burn before him sweet incense for
[42:05] the continual showbread for the burnt
[42:07] offerings morning and evening on the
[42:09] sabbaths on the new moons on the solemn
[42:11] Feast of the Lord Our God this is an
[42:13] ordinance forever to Israel to my
[42:17] people and the house which I build is
[42:19] great for Great Is Our God above all
[42:22] gods but who's able to build him and
[42:25] house seeing the heaven and Heaven of
[42:28] Heavens cannot contain him who am I then
[42:31] that that I should build a house save
[42:33] only to burn sacrifice before him send
[42:37] me now therefore a man cunning skilled
[42:40] to work in gold and silver and brass and
[42:42] iron and purple and crimson and blue and
[42:45] that can skill to grave with in other
[42:47] words teach and supervise the cunning
[42:49] men the skillful workers and Craftsmen
[42:52] that are with me in Judah and in
[42:53] Jerusalem whom David my father did
[42:56] provide skipping down to verse 14 part
[42:59] of Hon's
[43:00] reply uh the son of a woman of the
[43:03] daughters of Dan and his father was a
[43:05] man of Tire uh skillful to work in gold
[43:08] and silver brass Iron Stone and Timber
[43:10] and purple and blue and fine linen and
[43:11] in Crimson also to grave any manner of
[43:14] graving any kind of Engraving to find
[43:17] out every device which shall be put to
[43:18] him in other words he can execute any
[43:21] design any task that's given to him this
[43:23] guy can do it and with thy cunning men
[43:27] skillful work skilled workers or
[43:29] craftsmen and with the cunning men of my
[43:31] Lord David thy
[43:33] father the list goes on for cedar wood
[43:36] and so forth the lead Artisans of the
[43:38] temple are from hyram they're
[43:41] Gentiles they will direct the skilled
[43:44] workers of Israel and at the very end of
[43:47] this chapter we read Solomon numbered
[43:50] all the strangers all the foreigners the
[43:52] the temporary residents that were in the
[43:55] land of Israel after number ing
[43:57] wherewith David his father had numbered
[43:58] them and they were found to be
[44:03] 153,00 there's that number again and he
[44:06] set he assigned 70,000 of them to be
[44:10] bearers of burdens and 80,000 to be
[44:12] hewers in the mountain to be Stone
[44:14] Cutters and 3,600 overseers to set the
[44:17] people to work to make the people
[44:20] work Solomon was requiring The Strangers
[44:23] to do the heavy lifting and the Quarry
[44:26] work Gentiles Gentiles provided the
[44:29] materials and Gentiles
[44:31] led the skilled people in the building
[44:34] and the decorating of the
[44:39] temple I'm sorry I can't move a
[44:41] magnifying glass around that for you but
[44:43] chapters three and four detailed
[44:44] dimensions of the temple the the holy of
[44:47] holies which is this area right here was
[44:51] a 30 foot Cube 30 feet wide 30 feet deep
[44:54] 30 feet tall they talk about 20 cubits
[44:59] uh it's while it was taller than our
[45:02] church is about the same length of our
[45:05] building not quite as wide in fact if
[45:06] you I I overlaid but the drawing got to
[45:09] be way too cumbersome the U the little
[45:12] drawing up here and I overlaid that over
[45:15] an aerial photograph set to the same
[45:17] scale of the church the whole Temple
[45:19] would fit within the walls of our
[45:21] building not not including the old
[45:23] school building the the upper room and
[45:25] so forth the entire Temple the store
[45:27] rooms everything would fit in this space
[45:30] it's a little bit
[45:32] taller the construction of the temple
[45:35] took seven
[45:37] years 2 Chronicles 5:1 tells us thus all
[45:40] the work that Solomon made for the house
[45:42] of the Lord was finished and Solomon
[45:44] brought in all the things that David his
[45:46] father had dedicated the silver and the
[45:48] gold all the instruments put he among
[45:50] the Treasures of the house of
[45:53] God then Solomon assembled the Elders of
[45:56] Israel and all the heads of the tribes
[45:59] the chief of the fathers of the children
[46:01] of Israel into Jerusalem to bring up the
[46:03] Ark of the Covenant of the Lord out of
[46:06] the city of David which is Zion from the
[46:09] tent that David had prepared for it just
[46:11] a few hundred yards
[46:12] away wherefore all the men of Israel
[46:15] assembled themselves unto the king in
[46:17] the feast which was in the seventh month
[46:21] the seventh month there's three feasts
[46:23] trumpets atonement and Tabernacles all
[46:25] occur during that month but we'll learn
[46:27] from chapter 7 that this is in fact
[46:30] during the Feast of Tabernacles going on
[46:32] to verse 7 the priests brought in the
[46:36] Ark of the Covenant of the Lord unto his
[46:38] place to the Oracle of the house that's
[46:40] the holy of holies the inner chamber
[46:42] into the most holy place even under the
[46:44] wings of the cherubim for the Cherub
[46:47] beam spread forth their wings over the
[46:49] place of the Ark and the Cherub beam
[46:51] covered the ark and the staves thereof
[46:54] above I I just have to say this I'm
[46:58] sorry the King James version talks about
[47:00] cherub booms no no no no one is a cherub
[47:03] not a cherub multiple are cherubim not
[47:07] cherubims it's just sorry that's your
[47:10] Hebrew lesson for this evening now I can
[47:13] take off that hat put on this other one
[47:16] okay and they drew out the staves of the
[47:19] Ark that's the poles that They carried
[47:20] it
[47:22] on that the ends of the staves were seen
[47:25] from the ark before the oracle but they
[47:27] were not seen without outside of it you
[47:29] couldn't see that and there it is unto
[47:31] this day so we know when you'll find
[47:34] certain references to unto this day that
[47:37] this book is being written not all at
[47:38] one sitting but this is a Chronicle
[47:41] historians record keepers are writing
[47:43] these things down and at the point that
[47:45] this was written he says and at the day
[47:47] that I'm writing this that stuff is
[47:49] still there you'll see that as we go
[47:51] along there are changes of things that
[47:54] are no longer there so so don't get when
[47:57] I was a kid I said I want to go there
[47:59] and see that cuz the Bible says it's
[48:01] there to this day well um it was there
[48:04] to this day then it's not there to this
[48:06] day now that that's a different this day
[48:09] there's never been a day like this day
[48:11] we sing sometimes there was nothing in
[48:13] the ark save the two tables which Moses
[48:16] put there and at horb when the Lord made
[48:18] a covenant with the children of Israel
[48:21] when they came out of Egypt recall in
[48:23] our opening scripture Paul says that
[48:25] there was not only that but there was
[48:26] aob of mana and Aaron's Rod that bued
[48:29] those had disappeared at some point
[48:31] probably in the account in 1 Samuel
[48:33] where the the the children of Israel
[48:35] bring the ark before this battle of the
[48:37] Philistines because they're losing they
[48:39] figure well if we carry this thing if we
[48:40] treat it like an idol if we carry this
[48:42] out in front of us and wave Our God in
[48:44] front of them this Ark that we're going
[48:46] to win no the Philistines captured the
[48:48] ark they eventually sent it back after
[48:50] they had a lot of problems and where
[48:53] they dropped it off there says it's
[48:55] several thousand people were killed
[48:56] because they dared to look inside the
[48:58] box so it could be that that's when
[49:00] these things were lost but we don't
[49:01] really know it came to pass when the
[49:05] priests were come out of the Holy place
[49:08] for all the priests that were present
[49:09] were Sanctified and did not then wait by
[49:11] course later on there's so many priests
[49:14] that they set them up in divisions this
[49:16] is your week you go the second week of
[49:18] the month you go the fourth week of the
[49:20] month that sort of thing at this point
[49:22] they're all gathered there also the
[49:24] Levites which were the sing singers all
[49:27] of them of Asaf this fellow Asaf is
[49:30] called a Seer later in this book and
[49:32] there's at least 12 Psalms that
[49:34] introduce themselves as a Psalm of Asaf
[49:37] we heard about Asaf under First
[49:38] Chronicles of Asaf of hon of jedin and
[49:41] their sons and their Brethren being
[49:43] arrayed in white
[49:46] linen having symbols and sues and
[49:51] harps stood at the East End of the altar
[49:54] that's a picture of a of a salt from
[49:57] about that period of time from a from a
[49:59] statue and a fellow that's plucking at a
[50:02] at a harp um after they had invented
[50:05] photography so it's not so old and with
[50:08] them 120 priests sounding with
[50:11] trumpets and it came even to pass as the
[50:16] trumpeters and singers were as
[50:19] one to make one sound to be heard in
[50:23] praising and thanking the lord speaking
[50:27] of unity here and when they lifted up
[50:30] their voice with the trumpets and
[50:32] symbols and instruments of music and
[50:35] when they lifted up their voice with the
[50:38] trumpets and symbols and instruments of
[50:40] music and praised the Lord
[50:45] saying what is it they said for he is
[50:48] good for his mercy endureth
[50:52] forever all the people said that for he
[50:55] is good
[50:57] for his mercy endureth
[50:59] forever let's try it again for he is
[51:03] good for his mercy endureth forever amen
[51:07] hallelujah that when all these
[51:10] conditions music celebration Praise of
[51:14] the heart one mind and one Accord then
[51:18] the house was filled with a
[51:21] cloud even the house of the Lord so that
[51:25] the priests
[51:27] could not stand to minister by reason of
[51:30] the cloud for the glory of the Lord had
[51:33] filled the house of God notice it wasn't
[51:36] because Solomon was there it was When
[51:40] Praise in unity was offered not the
[51:44] sacrifices on the altar but in their
[51:47] praise do we want the presence of the
[51:50] Lord in our
[51:52] midst time is short we have a lot to
[51:54] cover so read some more
[51:57] excerpts about this uh dedication but in
[52:01] your devotions read these chapters about
[52:03] the dedication it's a marvelous moment
[52:06] in the history of Israel beautiful
[52:09] beautiful words and things that happened
[52:11] Solomon prays at the dedication and
[52:15] we'll go here to Chronicles 6 verse1
[52:17] Solomon's
[52:18] praying the Lord therefore hath
[52:21] performed his word that he has spoken
[52:23] for I am risen up in the room of David
[52:25] my father and have set on the throne of
[52:28] Israel as the Lord promised and have
[52:30] built the house for the name of the Lord
[52:33] God of Israel for his name not for his
[52:35] dwelling place and in it have I put the
[52:38] ark wherein is the Covenant of the Lord
[52:41] that he made with the children of Israel
[52:44] it's like a safe deposit box it contains
[52:46] a
[52:47] contract that's what a covenant is it's
[52:49] a contract you do this I'll do that down
[52:53] to verse 18 but the will of God in very
[52:56] deed but will God in very deed dwell
[52:59] with men on Earth behold Heaven and the
[53:04] heaven of Heavens cannot contain thee
[53:06] how much less this house which I have
[53:09] built have respect therefore to the
[53:12] prayer of thy servant and to his
[53:14] supplication oh Lord my God to hearken
[53:17] unto the cry and the prayer which thy
[53:19] servant prayeth before thee that thine
[53:21] eyes may be open Upon This House day and
[53:25] night upon the place where of thou Hast
[53:27] said thou wouldest put thy name there to
[53:30] hearken unto the prayer which thy
[53:32] servant prayeth toward this place
[53:34] hearken therefore under the
[53:36] supplications of thy servant and of thy
[53:39] People Israel which they shall make
[53:42] toward this place hear thou from thy
[53:46] Dwelling Place even from heaven and when
[53:49] thou
[53:49] hearest
[53:52] forgive read this chapter your devotions
[53:55] it is just beautiful skip to chapter
[53:57] 7 now when Solomon had made an end of
[54:00] praying fire came down from heaven and
[54:04] consumed the burnt offering and the
[54:07] sacrifices and the glory of the Lord
[54:10] filled the house and the priest could
[54:11] not minister no no at this point they
[54:15] could not even enter into the house of
[54:17] the Lord because the glory of the Lord
[54:20] had filled the Lord's
[54:23] House and when all the children of
[54:25] Israel
[54:27] saw how the fire came down and the glory
[54:30] of the Lord upon the house they bowed
[54:33] themselves with their faces to the
[54:36] ground upon the pavement and worshiped
[54:40] and praised the Lord saying for he is
[54:42] good for his mercy endureth
[54:46] forever skipping to verse 11 thus
[54:49] Solomon finished the house of the Lord
[54:52] and the King's house which took another
[54:54] 13 years and was much larger than the
[54:57] temple and all that came into Solomon's
[55:00] heart to make in the house of the Lord
[55:01] and in his own house he prosperously
[55:05] affected and going back down to the time
[55:08] of the dedication of the temple the Lord
[55:11] appeared unto Solomon By Night the
[55:13] second time and said unto him I have
[55:17] heard thy prayer and have chosen this
[55:20] place to myself for an House of
[55:22] sacrifice if I shut up Heaven that there
[55:25] be no rain rain or if I command the
[55:28] locusts to Devour the land or if I send
[55:31] pestilence among my people if my people
[55:36] which are called by my name shall humble
[55:40] themselves and pray and seek my face and
[55:47] turn from their Wicked Ways
[55:50] repent then will I hear from heaven and
[55:54] will forgive their sin and will heal
[55:58] their land now mine eyes shall be open
[56:01] and mine ears attent unto the prayer
[56:04] that is made in this place for now have
[56:08] I Chosen and Sanctified this house that
[56:11] my name may be there forever and mine
[56:14] eyes and Mine Heart shall be there
[56:17] perpetually but be careful Solomon be
[56:20] very
[56:22] careful because as for thee if
[56:28] there are three
[56:30] conditions first thou wil walk before me
[56:34] as David thy father walked and second do
[56:39] according to all that I have commanded
[56:42] thee and third shalt observe my statutes
[56:46] and my judgments then will I establish
[56:50] the Throne of thy kingdom according as I
[56:52] have covenanted with David thy father
[56:55] saying there shall not fail a man shall
[56:58] fail thee a man to be ruler in
[57:00] Israel but
[57:03] Solomon if you don't do these things the
[57:07] consequences are far far worse than you
[57:09] can
[57:10] imagine pay attention
[57:13] son but if ye turn away and forsake my
[57:17] statutes and my Commandments which I
[57:19] have set before you and not only that
[57:22] but if you in egyan shall go and serve
[57:25] other gods gods and worship
[57:28] them then I will pluck them the gods no
[57:34] the People Israel I will pluck them up
[57:37] by the roots out of their land no the
[57:41] Lord says out of my land which I have
[57:44] given them and this house that you just
[57:47] built and dedicated that I filled with
[57:51] my presence which I have Sanctified for
[57:54] my name will I cast out of my sight
[57:57] and will make it to be a proverb and a
[58:00] byword among all
[58:02] nations this is about a whole lot more
[58:05] than your descendants ruling my people
[58:07] Solomon are you listening and this house
[58:11] which is high shall be an astonishment
[58:13] to everyone that passes by it so that
[58:16] he'll say why has the Lord done this
[58:20] unto this land and unto this
[58:23] house and it shall be answered because
[58:27] they forsook the Lord God of their
[58:29] fathers which brought them forth out of
[58:32] the land of Egypt and laid hold on other
[58:35] gods and worshiped them and served them
[58:40] therefore hath he brought all this evil
[58:44] upon
[58:45] them it's about humility it's about
[58:53] obedience the next few chapters tell of
[58:55] his well the visit of the Queen of Sheba
[58:57] Chronicles doesn't tell of the way he
[59:00] turned from the Lord in his latter years
[59:02] we we learned about that in
[59:07] Kings some more lines here from the
[59:10] daily parchment his son rabam was 41
[59:14] when he took the throne and had
[59:16] witnessed the Splendor of his dad's
[59:18] Kingdom and his dad falling farther and
[59:21] farther away from the Lord chapter 10
[59:25] lays the blank for the kingdom splitting
[59:27] on ryab bomes following bad advice which
[59:29] is
[59:30] true but as we just read that happened
[59:33] because Solomon turned away forsook the
[59:36] Lord's statutes and Commandments and
[59:38] worshiped other gods
[59:40] rehoboam is following in his Father's
[59:44] Footsteps dads are you
[59:47] listening followed his Father's
[59:51] Footsteps the chapter ends and Israel
[59:55] rebelled against the House of David unto
[59:58] this day when this part of Chronicles
[1:00:01] was written the two kingdoms Israel and
[1:00:03] Juda
[1:00:05] existed it's often confusing to hear the
[1:00:07] words Israel and Judah Israel is a name
[1:00:10] given to Jacob it's a name used to
[1:00:12] describe the people descended from Jacob
[1:00:14] in the Bible up until the time the
[1:00:15] kingdom is split it's also the name of
[1:00:18] the Modern Nation in the Middle East
[1:00:20] shown to the left on the screen once the
[1:00:22] ancient Kingdom split the northern part
[1:00:24] continued to be called Israel this is
[1:00:27] the area shaded in light green on the
[1:00:29] right side of this green the southern
[1:00:30] part takes on the name of Judah one of
[1:00:33] Jacob's sons this is shaded in lavender
[1:00:35] on the lower part of the screen I've
[1:00:37] circled Jerusalem on each map for
[1:00:39] reference to help you link things
[1:00:42] together well after Solomon's Reign the
[1:00:45] United Kingdom of Israel was divided
[1:00:47] into these two Nations these two
[1:00:49] kingdoms Israel and Judah Israel is
[1:00:53] ruled first by jeroboam Judah by
[1:00:57] rehoboam both forsake the Lord and
[1:00:59] worship idols and lead the people
[1:01:01] further into sin and Disobedience
[1:01:03] arranging them from the Lord but chapter
[1:01:06] 11 tells us that in spite of the hard
[1:01:09] rule of rehoboam over Judah we read the
[1:01:12] priests and the Levites that were in all
[1:01:16] Israel resorted to him to rabam they
[1:01:19] came to him out of all their coasts out
[1:01:21] of all their borders throughout
[1:01:23] jeroboam's Kingdom of Israel they fled
[1:01:25] to RAB booms Kingdom of Judah for the
[1:01:28] Levites left their suburbs and their
[1:01:30] possessions remember under Joshua the
[1:01:34] tribe of Levi had cities scattered all
[1:01:36] throughout the territory but they had no
[1:01:38] contiguous parcel of land of their
[1:01:41] own so they left those places and came
[1:01:45] to Judah and Jerusalem for jeroboam and
[1:01:48] his sons had cast them off from
[1:01:49] executing the priest's office unto the
[1:01:52] Lord and He jeroboam ordained for
[1:01:55] himself self priest for the high places
[1:01:57] and for the devils and for the calves
[1:02:00] which he had made and installed as you
[1:02:02] recall in Dan and bethl and after them
[1:02:06] out of all the tribes of Israel such as
[1:02:08] set their hearts to seek the Lord God of
[1:02:10] Israel came to Jerusalem to sacrifice
[1:02:13] unto the Lord God of their fathers so
[1:02:17] they the priests Levites those who
[1:02:20] desired to worship and follow the lord
[1:02:22] they strengthened the kingdom of Judah
[1:02:24] made rabam the son of Solomon strong for
[1:02:27] three years for three years they walked
[1:02:30] in the way of David and
[1:02:34] Solomon rabo ruled for 17 years though
[1:02:38] the first three were harsh he walked in
[1:02:40] the way of the Lord sadly by the fifth
[1:02:44] year he had forsaken the law of the Lord
[1:02:48] and the people with
[1:02:49] him shishak of Egypt came and spoiled
[1:02:53] ransacked Jerusalem only only 34 years
[1:02:57] after the temples dedicated its
[1:02:59] plundered while Judah forsakes the Lord
[1:03:03] 12 years later rehoboam is dead and is
[1:03:05] followed by his son
[1:03:08] abijah 2 Chronicles tells of a huge
[1:03:11] battle between Israel and Judah this is
[1:03:13] a nation broken into two kingdoms
[1:03:15] killing each other not all that
[1:03:18] different I suppose than America of 170
[1:03:21] odd years
[1:03:23] ago the lord gave abijah a great victory
[1:03:26] over jeroboam's forces a Slaughter of
[1:03:29] Israel's Army by
[1:03:32] Judas First Kings fills in other parts
[1:03:35] of the story we learn that abijah quote
[1:03:37] walked in all the sins of his father
[1:03:40] rabam abijah lasted three years and
[1:03:46] died it's now been 20 years since
[1:03:48] Solomon died aija son ASA takes the
[1:03:51] throne and rules for 41
[1:03:54] years who's
[1:03:57] ASA we read in 2 Chronicles 14 so abijah
[1:04:01] slept with his fathers they buried him
[1:04:03] in the city of David and ASA his son
[1:04:05] reigned in his dead in his days the land
[1:04:08] was quiet 10 years no war no
[1:04:12] fighting and ASA did that which was good
[1:04:16] and right in the eyes of the Lord his
[1:04:19] God for he took away the altars of the
[1:04:22] strange gods and the high places and
[1:04:25] broke down down the images and cut down
[1:04:27] the Groves the engraved things the idols
[1:04:30] and ASA commanded Judah to seek the Lord
[1:04:34] God of their fathers and to do the law
[1:04:37] and the
[1:04:38] Commandment in chapter 15 we read the
[1:04:41] spirit of God Came Upon Azariah the son
[1:04:44] of
[1:04:45] ODed he's a prophet he went out to meet
[1:04:48] ASA and he said unto him hear you me ASA
[1:04:52] and all Judah and Benjamin the Lord is
[1:04:55] with you while you be with him if you
[1:04:57] seek Him He will be found of you but if
[1:05:00] you forsake Him He will forsake you
[1:05:04] skipping to verse 7 be strong therefore
[1:05:06] let not your hands be weak for your work
[1:05:09] shall be
[1:05:11] rewarded and when ASA heard these words
[1:05:13] and the prophecy of odad the prophet he
[1:05:15] took courage and he put away the
[1:05:18] Abominable Idols out of all the land of
[1:05:20] Judah and Benjamin and out of the Cities
[1:05:22] which he had taken from Mount ephra and
[1:05:25] renewed the altar of the Lord that was
[1:05:26] before the porch of the Lord in in front
[1:05:29] of the temple and he gathered all Judah
[1:05:31] and Benjamin and the strangers with them
[1:05:33] out of ephriam and Manasseh and out of
[1:05:36] Simeon for they fell to him out of
[1:05:38] Israel in abundance when they saw that
[1:05:41] the Lord his God was with him skipping
[1:05:44] to verse
[1:05:45] 12 they entered into a covenant to seek
[1:05:48] the Lord God of their fathers with all
[1:05:51] their heart and with all their soul
[1:05:54] verse 15 all Judah rejoiced at the oath
[1:05:58] for they had sworn with all their heart
[1:06:01] and sought him with their whole
[1:06:06] desire what happens when we truly
[1:06:10] wholeheartedly seek the Lord he was
[1:06:13] found of them and the lord gave them
[1:06:16] rest round about verse 17 the high
[1:06:21] places were not taken away out of Israel
[1:06:24] nevertheless the heart of Asa was
[1:06:27] perfect all his
[1:06:32] days wow after 20 more years about 875
[1:06:37] BC ASA is at war with
[1:06:39] Israel ASA emptied the treasury of the
[1:06:42] temple whatever silver and gold remained
[1:06:44] and sent it to the king of Syria the
[1:06:46] king of Syria was with Israel fighting
[1:06:49] against Judah so he said huh I'll pay
[1:06:51] you more than Israel's pay and be my guy
[1:06:53] and fight them so that mercenaries and
[1:06:56] that's what they did he bought the king
[1:06:58] of Syria so he turned on his now former
[1:07:00] Ally
[1:07:01] Israel he got scolded for that rather
[1:07:04] than depending on the Lord he raided the
[1:07:06] temple to depend upon Syria the last few
[1:07:10] years of Ace's life were not very happy
[1:07:12] he didn't worship other gods but we're
[1:07:15] told he failed to consult the
[1:07:18] Lord he died six years
[1:07:23] later his son Jehoshaphat became King
[1:07:28] around 872 BC 58 years after Solomon's
[1:07:31] death 87 years after the temple was
[1:07:33] dedicated and it had already been raid
[1:07:36] twice stripped of its wealth exactly
[1:07:40] what God told Solomon what happened if
[1:07:42] he disobeyed God Jehosaphat reigned for
[1:07:46] 25 years 2 Chronicles 17 we read the
[1:07:50] Lord was with Jehoshaphat because he
[1:07:52] walked in the first ways of his father
[1:07:54] David and sought not unto balim we
[1:07:58] sometimes say balum and think that
[1:07:59] that's an idol but it's Bim it's it's
[1:08:01] Gods it's a
[1:08:03] plural but sought the Lord God of his
[1:08:06] father and walked in his Commandments
[1:08:09] not after the doings of Israel therefore
[1:08:12] the Lord established the kingdom in his
[1:08:13] hand and all Judah brought to
[1:08:15] Jehoshaphat presence and he had riches
[1:08:18] and honor in abundance and his heart was
[1:08:22] lifted up in the ways of the Lord
[1:08:25] moreover he took away the high places
[1:08:27] and Groves out of Judah also in the
[1:08:31] third year of jehoshaphat's Reign he
[1:08:35] sent to his princes to teach in the
[1:08:38] cities of Judah with them he sent
[1:08:40] Levites and with them elishama and
[1:08:43] jehoram
[1:08:44] Priests and the third year what is he
[1:08:46] doing sending these people out they
[1:08:49] taught in Judah and had the book of The
[1:08:52] Law of the Lord with them and went about
[1:08:54] throughout all the cities of Judah and
[1:08:57] taught the
[1:08:58] people they taught the people from the
[1:09:01] book of The Law of the Lord they were
[1:09:04] having a kingdom wide Wednesday night
[1:09:06] bible
[1:09:07] study his big mistake was allying
[1:09:09] himself with Ahab and Israel's battle
[1:09:12] against
[1:09:13] Syria after being scolded about that he
[1:09:16] continued to do good
[1:09:20] things his son jehoram took over and was
[1:09:24] evil he started by killing his siblings
[1:09:27] to be sure they wouldn't
[1:09:28] revolt and followed the sins of Israel
[1:09:31] we're told he reigned for eight years
[1:09:33] the only mention of Elijah is during his
[1:09:35] Reign when Elijah issues a prophecy
[1:09:38] against
[1:09:40] jehoram his son aesia Reigns for one
[1:09:44] year and is killed by juu when he's
[1:09:47] destroying ahab's descendants in Israel
[1:09:49] we read this in Second Kings a couple of
[1:09:51] weeks
[1:09:52] ago aia's mother atalia takes over she
[1:09:56] kills the remaining what they call the
[1:09:58] seed Royal the the sons of aesia who had
[1:10:01] killed all of his own Brothers she's
[1:10:04] wicked she Reigns for six years it's now
[1:10:08] about
[1:10:09] 835
[1:10:11] BC 124 years since the dedication of the
[1:10:14] Temple 40 years since the table Temple
[1:10:18] was last
[1:10:23] raided there's a priest by the name of
[1:10:27] yoad and he sneaks Yash an infant son of
[1:10:30] aazah out of the royal Nursery before
[1:10:33] atalia can kill him and yahho protects
[1:10:37] him when joash is seven years old yoa
[1:10:41] anoints him King at Alia is killed and
[1:10:45] joash Reigns for 40 years there are
[1:10:49] great reforms in Judah while yah HOA is
[1:10:52] alive in the 23rd year of Jo ases rain
[1:10:55] about 8810 BC the temple repairs
[1:10:58] begin shortly after yah hoedad dies and
[1:11:03] joash in chapter 24 we
[1:11:06] find takes the wrong turn he goes even
[1:11:10] to the point when one of YH hoad's Sons
[1:11:13] tries to explain something to him and
[1:11:15] tell him something from the Lord he has
[1:11:17] him
[1:11:18] killed the the son of the counselor that
[1:11:20] had done so much good he raised the
[1:11:23] temple treasury to buy off the king of
[1:11:25] Syria Syria seems to like getting the
[1:11:28] temple Treasury and he's assassinated in
[1:11:30] Revenge for killing YH hoad's
[1:11:34] son and it's curious that the Bible says
[1:11:38] that the the two people the two men that
[1:11:40] assassinated him were Sons one one of
[1:11:43] his one of the mothers the no the mother
[1:11:46] of one of the men was from Ammon the
[1:11:49] mother of the other man was from
[1:11:52] Moab strange how the ammonite and the
[1:11:55] Lites keep popping up
[1:11:59] here well yash's
[1:12:02] son amiah begins well in in 2 Chronicles
[1:12:06] 25:2 it says he did that which was right
[1:12:08] in the sight of the Lord but not with a
[1:12:10] perfect heart he rules for 29 years and
[1:12:14] Midway in his Reign Rebels and worships
[1:12:17] the gods of
[1:12:19] seir you might remember Mount seer in
[1:12:22] some relationship with uh one of the
[1:12:25] other lineages that came down from
[1:12:27] Abraham that wasn't through Jacob the
[1:12:29] temple is rated again perhaps around 775
[1:12:32] BC it seems to be a
[1:12:34] pattern people start off well then they
[1:12:37] get distracted they start worshiping
[1:12:41] Idols they go from good to bad but
[1:12:45] there's one who breaks this pattern
[1:12:46] we'll we'll we'll see towards the end of
[1:12:48] the
[1:12:50] book the next king is Uzziah he's
[1:12:53] mentioned frequently in the book of
[1:12:55] Isaiah we read of Uzziah in 2 Chronicles
[1:12:58] 26:4 it says heed that which was right
[1:13:00] in the sight of the Lord near the end of
[1:13:03] his life his pride gets to him he
[1:13:06] decides to go to the temple and burn
[1:13:09] incense I'm the king I can I can do this
[1:13:12] the priests warn him don't go in there
[1:13:14] don't do that this is a duty of Levites
[1:13:17] of descendants of levite don't do this
[1:13:19] don't please don't do this he I'm going
[1:13:22] to do it anyway I'm the king well he's
[1:13:25] determined and while he's there arguing
[1:13:26] with the priests he breaks out head to
[1:13:29] toe covered in
[1:13:31] leprosy so he has to now go into a
[1:13:34] separate place he can't even sit on his
[1:13:36] throne or be in his
[1:13:39] Palace he succeeded by his son yatham
[1:13:43] who rules for 16 years and we read in 2
[1:13:46] Chronicles 272 he did that which was
[1:13:48] right in the sight of the Lord according
[1:13:50] to all that his father the Uzziah did
[1:13:52] how be it he entered not into the Temple
[1:13:54] of the Lord Lord in other words he
[1:13:56] didn't make the mistake his dad did he
[1:13:59] was a good King he did good things but
[1:14:01] the verse goes on and says and the
[1:14:04] people did yet corruptly so while he was
[1:14:08] going the right way everybody else was
[1:14:10] going somewhere else I don't know if it
[1:14:12] was a leadership issue or if it's just
[1:14:15] the Lord's judgment proceeding because
[1:14:17] of the Disobedience of Solomon it
[1:14:19] doesn't tell us but the people don't
[1:14:21] follow his
[1:14:22] leadership well Ahab is
[1:14:27] next 2 Chronicles
[1:14:29] 28 ahaz was 20 years old when he began
[1:14:33] to Reign and he reigned 16 years in
[1:14:36] Jerusalem but he did not that which was
[1:14:38] right in the sight of the Lord like
[1:14:40] David his father for he walked in the
[1:14:42] ways of the Kings of Israel and made
[1:14:45] also moled images for
[1:14:49] balim if you think that's bad I hope
[1:14:53] you're sitting down the next verse
[1:14:57] moreover he burnt incense in the Valley
[1:14:59] of the son of hinam and burnt his
[1:15:01] children in the
[1:15:04] fire after the Abominations of the
[1:15:06] Heathen whom the Lord had cast out
[1:15:08] before the children of Israel yeah the
[1:15:12] king of Judah went so far as to
[1:15:14] sacrifice some of his children to
[1:15:19] Idols there's yet another civil war and
[1:15:23] during this war many people from Judah
[1:15:25] are captured by Israel but a prophet
[1:15:29] arises in Israel and says no this bad
[1:15:33] you send these folks from Judah you send
[1:15:35] them back home you don't keep them here
[1:15:36] we're in enough trouble as it is we
[1:15:38] don't need this trouble too about two
[1:15:40] years later 723 BC after these guys had
[1:15:44] been returned Assyria conquered Israel
[1:15:47] carried the inhabitants away the 10 lost
[1:15:49] tribes as they're commonly referred to
[1:15:52] so a number of people of Judah had it
[1:15:54] not been for that Prophet would have
[1:15:56] been carried off by the Assyrians as
[1:15:58] well verse 22 in the time of his
[1:16:02] distress he did trespass yet more
[1:16:05] against the Lord this is that King ahaz
[1:16:09] you can tell the writer this portion of
[1:16:11] the book is completely disgusted with
[1:16:13] ahaz he can't help himself yeah yeah
[1:16:15] that
[1:16:16] ahaz he sacrificed unto the gods of
[1:16:20] Damascus which smote him and he said
[1:16:23] because the gods of the Kings of Syria
[1:16:25] help them therefore will I sacrifice to
[1:16:28] them and maybe they'll help
[1:16:30] me has no clue no
[1:16:33] concept but they were the ruin of him
[1:16:37] and of all Israel and it has gathered
[1:16:40] together the vessels of the house of God
[1:16:43] and cut in pieces the vessels of the
[1:16:45] house of God and shut up the doors of
[1:16:47] the house of the Lord and made him
[1:16:49] altars in every corner of
[1:16:53] Jerusalem ahaz dies he has a son
[1:16:57] Hezekiah who becomes
[1:17:02] king so this is about 728
[1:17:09] BC 2 Chronicles 29 begins Hezekiah began
[1:17:14] to
[1:17:16] Reign when he was 5 and 20 years old and
[1:17:19] he reigned 29 years in Jerusalem his
[1:17:22] mother's name was abijah the daughter of
[1:17:24] Zachariah
[1:17:25] and he did that which was right in the
[1:17:28] sight of the Lord according to all that
[1:17:31] David his father had
[1:17:33] done and what's his first order of
[1:17:36] business he in the first year of his
[1:17:38] Reign and the first month opened the
[1:17:40] doors of the house of the Lord and
[1:17:42] repaired them he brought in the priests
[1:17:44] and the Levites and gathered them
[1:17:46] together into the East Street and said
[1:17:48] unto them hear me ye Levites sanctify
[1:17:51] now yourselves and sanctify the house of
[1:17:55] the Lord God of your fathers and carry
[1:17:57] forth the filthiness of my father Ahab
[1:18:00] out of the Holy
[1:18:02] Place skipping to verse 17 now they
[1:18:05] began on the first day of the first
[1:18:07] month to sanctify what does it mean
[1:18:09] sanctify cleanse and set aside for
[1:18:12] service right part of our process of
[1:18:15] Christianity justification
[1:18:17] sanctification then the infilling of the
[1:18:19] holy
[1:18:20] spirit so he wants them to sanctify to
[1:18:23] clean this place and on the eighth day
[1:18:25] of the month came they to the porch of
[1:18:27] the
[1:18:29] Lord so they Sanctified the house of the
[1:18:32] Lord in 8 days and in the 16th day of
[1:18:34] the first month they made an
[1:18:37] end now what's supposed to happen on the
[1:18:39] 15th day of the first
[1:18:41] month Passover right so this is this is
[1:18:46] a day late then they went into Hezekiah
[1:18:48] the king and said we have cleansed all
[1:18:50] the house of the Lord the altar of burnt
[1:18:53] offering with all the vessels thereof of
[1:18:55] and the showbread table and all the
[1:18:57] vessels thereof moreover all the vessels
[1:18:59] which king ahaz and his Reign did Cast
[1:19:01] Away in his transgression have we
[1:19:03] prepared and Sanctified and behold they
[1:19:05] are before the altar of the
[1:19:08] Lord after the temple restored it's too
[1:19:11] late in the first month to observe
[1:19:13] Passover but Hezekiah decides that it's
[1:19:15] just too important to not do so he says
[1:19:18] well we'll observe it in the second
[1:19:20] month not in Rebellion but in Zeal and
[1:19:23] in humility
[1:19:27] so chapter 30:2 also in Judah the hand
[1:19:31] of God was to give them one heart the
[1:19:34] hand of God was to give them one heart
[1:19:36] to do the Commandment of King Uzziah and
[1:19:39] of the princes by the word of the lord
[1:19:42] and there assembled at Jerusalem much
[1:19:44] people to keep the Feast of unleavened
[1:19:46] bread in the second month a very great
[1:19:49] congregation verse 25 all the
[1:19:52] congregation of Judah with the priests
[1:19:54] and the Levites and all the congregation
[1:19:56] that came out of Israel and the
[1:19:58] strangers that came out of the land of
[1:19:59] Israel and that dwelt in Judah
[1:20:03] rejoiced so there was great joy in
[1:20:06] Jerusalem for since the time of Solomon
[1:20:10] the son of David king of Israel there
[1:20:13] was not the like in
[1:20:15] Jerusalem then the priests the Levites
[1:20:18] arose and blessed the people and their
[1:20:21] voice was heard and their prayer came up
[1:20:23] to his holy Dwelling Place even un
[1:20:29] Heaven hezekiah's Reign is summed up
[1:20:33] chapter 32 now the rest of the acts of
[1:20:36] Hezekiah and his goodness behold they
[1:20:39] are written in the vision of Isaiah the
[1:20:41] prophet the son of Amos and in the book
[1:20:44] of the kings of Judah and
[1:20:46] Israel and Hezekiah slept with his
[1:20:49] fathers and they buried him in the
[1:20:51] chiefest of the supplers of of the sons
[1:20:55] of
[1:20:59] David
[1:21:00] manasse hezekiah's Son succeeds him to
[1:21:03] the throne he was a terrible evil person
[1:21:08] first part of his life he was a bit like
[1:21:12] me he was 12 when he ascended to the
[1:21:17] throne and ruled for 55 years might be
[1:21:21] the longest
[1:21:23] Reign what's this bad
[1:21:25] guy 2 Chronicles
[1:21:28] 33 he caused his children to pass
[1:21:32] through the fire in the Valley of the
[1:21:33] son of henm also he observed times and
[1:21:37] used enchantments and used Witchcraft
[1:21:41] and dealt with a familiar spirit and
[1:21:43] with Wizards he wrought much evil in the
[1:21:46] sight of the Lord to provoke him to
[1:21:49] provoke the Lord to anger who is this
[1:21:53] guy verse
[1:21:55] so manasse made Judah and the
[1:21:59] inhabitants of Jerusalem to Heir and to
[1:22:02] do worse than the Heathen whom the Lord
[1:22:04] had destroyed before the children of
[1:22:09] Israel he put Idols in the temple
[1:22:12] including and the holy of
[1:22:16] holies why are you talking about this
[1:22:19] guy brother L he was eventually carried
[1:22:21] off in Chains to Babylon
[1:22:25] and guess
[1:22:27] what there he
[1:22:30] repented and sought the
[1:22:32] Lord and what did the Lord
[1:22:35] do delivered him and brought him back to
[1:22:41] Jerusalem verse 15 and he Manasseh took
[1:22:46] away the strange gods and the idol out
[1:22:48] of the house of the Lord and all the
[1:22:50] altars that who his fathers before him
[1:22:54] no
[1:22:54] that he had built in the Mount of the
[1:22:57] house of the Lord and in Jerusalem and
[1:22:59] cast them out of the city he repaired
[1:23:01] the altar of the Lord and sacrificed
[1:23:04] there on peace offerings and thank
[1:23:07] offerings and commanded Judah to serve
[1:23:09] the Lord God of
[1:23:11] Israel
[1:23:12] notice these weren't Idols someone else
[1:23:15] put up he put them up this is
[1:23:19] testimony this is humility that's what I
[1:23:23] was but I'm not that that now this is
[1:23:26] confession this is an
[1:23:29] example a sinner saved by grace thank
[1:23:34] the Lord nevertheless the people did
[1:23:37] sacrifice still in the high places yet
[1:23:39] unto the Lord the God
[1:23:41] only now the rest of the acts of
[1:23:44] Manasseh and his prayer unto his God and
[1:23:46] the words of the seers that spake unto
[1:23:48] him in the name of the Lord God of
[1:23:49] Israel behold they're written in the
[1:23:52] book of The Kings of Israel
[1:23:57] I I I can't help but think how God must
[1:24:01] have loved his arant son
[1:24:04] manasse to warn him time and again and
[1:24:07] finally to patiently put him in a place
[1:24:11] where he could see what he was and come
[1:24:14] to the realization that he though a king
[1:24:17] and of the davidic line was a vile
[1:24:20] person whose only hope was the grace of
[1:24:23] God
[1:24:25] that's
[1:24:26] me the story of manasse gives me hope if
[1:24:31] we are truly cognizant of our sin and
[1:24:35] sincerely repent God is ready to
[1:24:39] forgive not some incantation or some
[1:24:43] Indulgence not reciting words we think
[1:24:46] he expects of us but truly turning
[1:24:50] around and like
[1:24:53] manasse will see it in the actions that
[1:24:56] play out in our
[1:24:58] lives brother Fred Barker wrote that
[1:25:01] song that we sometimes saying it's the
[1:25:03] life behind the name that makes the
[1:25:06] proud heart
[1:25:09] humble so Manasseh slept with his
[1:25:12] fathers and they buried him in his own
[1:25:14] house and Ammon his son reigned in his
[1:25:18] dead alond lasted two years he was an
[1:25:22] evil guy he he was
[1:25:26] murdered Almond's 8-year-old son then
[1:25:30] becomes
[1:25:31] king about
[1:25:33] 640
[1:25:35] BC 2 Chronicles
[1:25:38] 34
[1:25:40] Josiah was eight years old when he began
[1:25:43] to Reign and he reigned in Jerusalem 31
[1:25:47] years he did that which was right in the
[1:25:50] sight of the Lord and walked in the ways
[1:25:52] of David his father and declined neither
[1:25:55] to the right hand nor to the
[1:25:58] left we're not told who his advisers
[1:26:01] were this eight-year-old boy but they
[1:26:04] must have been wise men no doubt
[1:26:06] influenced by the transformation that
[1:26:09] they saw and manasse just a few years
[1:26:14] earlier for in the eighth year of his
[1:26:17] Reign while he was yet young at age 16
[1:26:23] he began to seek after to the god of
[1:26:25] David his father and in the 12th year at
[1:26:28] age 20 he began to purge Judah and
[1:26:32] Jerusalem from the high places and the
[1:26:33] Groves and the carved images and the
[1:26:35] molten
[1:26:38] images verse eight now in the 18th year
[1:26:42] of his Reign age
[1:26:44] 26 we read hilaya the priest found a
[1:26:49] book of the law of the Lord given by
[1:26:53] Moses
[1:26:55] and heaya answered instead to shaon the
[1:26:58] Scribe I I found the book of the law in
[1:27:01] the house of the Lord and hilaya
[1:27:04] delivered the book to shaon and chafon
[1:27:06] the Scribe told the King Josiah saying
[1:27:08] hilaya the priest has given me a
[1:27:12] book and jefon read it before the king
[1:27:16] and it came to pass when the king had
[1:27:18] heard the words of the
[1:27:21] law he rent his clothes
[1:27:24] the king commanded hkah and ahum the son
[1:27:27] of chafon and abdom the son of Micah and
[1:27:30] shaon the Scribe and asiah a servant of
[1:27:32] the Kings saying
[1:27:36] go inquire of the Lord for me and for
[1:27:40] them that are left in Israel and in
[1:27:42] Judah concerning the words of the book
[1:27:45] that is
[1:27:46] found great is the Wrath of the Lord
[1:27:49] that is poured out upon us because our
[1:27:52] fathers have not not kept the word of
[1:27:55] the Lord to do all that is written in
[1:27:59] this
[1:28:01] book they go to the prophet as holda who
[1:28:05] tells them that Judah will be destroyed
[1:28:08] but because of Josiah's tender heart and
[1:28:10] humility he would not see that
[1:28:16] destruction we read and the King Josiah
[1:28:20] went up into the house of the Lord and
[1:28:22] all the men of Judah and the inhabitants
[1:28:23] of Jerusalem and the priests and the
[1:28:25] Levites and all the people Great and
[1:28:28] Small they were getting together for
[1:28:31] this purpose he Josiah read in their
[1:28:35] ears all the words of the book of the
[1:28:38] Covenant that was found in the house of
[1:28:41] the
[1:28:44] Lord spoiler alert I I think in a couple
[1:28:47] of weeks we'll hear another Josiah tell
[1:28:49] us of one who stood and read the book to
[1:28:51] the people with great effect
[1:28:55] the
[1:28:56] king stood in his place and made a
[1:29:00] covenant before the Lord to walk after
[1:29:02] the Lord and to keep his
[1:29:07] Commandments testimonies
[1:29:10] statues with all his heart and with all
[1:29:13] his soul to perform the words of the
[1:29:16] Covenant which are written in this book
[1:29:20] and Josiah caused all that were present
[1:29:22] in Jerusalem and Ben Benjamin to stand
[1:29:25] to it and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
[1:29:28] did according to the Covenant of God the
[1:29:31] god of their fathers and Josiah took
[1:29:34] away all the Abominations out of all the
[1:29:36] countries that pertained to the children
[1:29:37] of Israel and made all that were present
[1:29:39] in Israel to serve the Lord their God
[1:29:43] and all his days they departed not from
[1:29:47] following the Lord the god of their
[1:29:53] fathers
[1:29:56] chapter
[1:29:57] 35 moreover Josiah kept a Passover unto
[1:30:02] the Lord in Jerusalem and they killed
[1:30:03] the Passover on the 14th day of the
[1:30:05] first month skipping down to verse 18 we
[1:30:09] read there was no Passover like that to
[1:30:12] be kept in Israel from the days of
[1:30:15] Samuel the
[1:30:18] prophet neither did all the kings of
[1:30:21] Israel keep such a Passover as Josiah
[1:30:24] kept and the priests and the Levites and
[1:30:27] all Judah and Israel that were present
[1:30:30] and the inhabitants of
[1:30:32] Jerusalem in the 18th year of the reign
[1:30:36] of
[1:30:38] Josiah age 26 was this Passover
[1:30:43] kept 13 years later at age 39 jiah is
[1:30:48] killed in battle
[1:30:51] 609
[1:30:52] BC
[1:30:58] recall the
[1:30:59] propheus indicated to Josiah's
[1:31:01] emissaries that the nation was past
[1:31:05] saving we've seen individuals including
[1:31:08] those of great influence can be
[1:31:10] saved but the nation was
[1:31:13] doomed yahwe Josiah's son is King for
[1:31:16] three months the king of Egypt comes and
[1:31:19] dethrones him putting yah's brother in
[1:31:20] his King 11 years later Nebuchadnezzar
[1:31:23] comes puts that King in Chains and
[1:31:25] Carries him off to Babylon along with
[1:31:27] raiding the Temple of its Treasures
[1:31:30] there's a rapid succession of puppet
[1:31:31] Kings the people not serving the lord at
[1:31:35] all 586 BC just 20 years after Josiah's
[1:31:42] death Jerusalem and the temple are
[1:31:46] destroyed and
[1:31:48] burned another 47 years pass and Cyrus
[1:31:53] becomes king of Persia musicians please
[1:31:58] come 2 Chronicles 36 we read now the
[1:32:02] first year of Cyrus King of Persia it's
[1:32:06] about 539 BC that the word of the Lord
[1:32:10] spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be
[1:32:13] accomplished the Lord stirred up the
[1:32:16] spirit of Cyrus King of Persia and he
[1:32:20] made a proclamation throughout all his
[1:32:22] kingdom and put it also in writing
[1:32:27] saying thus sayith Cyrus King of Persia
[1:32:31] all the kingdoms of the earth hath the
[1:32:34] Lord God Of Heaven given me and he hath
[1:32:37] charged me to build him an house in
[1:32:39] Jerusalem which is in Judah who is there
[1:32:42] among you of all his people the Lord his
[1:32:46] God be with him and let him go
[1:32:50] up those are the closing words of 2
[1:32:54] Chronicles and in the Jewish ordering of
[1:32:57] the books of what we call the Old
[1:32:58] Testament it's the closing words of
[1:33:01] their
[1:33:04] Bible let's take a closer look lessons
[1:33:07] that we can get from second
[1:33:11] chronicles two lessons jumped out at me
[1:33:13] from this book the first regards
[1:33:17] entitlement and
[1:33:19] pride royalty thought they were special
[1:33:21] because of who their parents were we saw
[1:33:24] that in the various Kings with rabam
[1:33:26] being a prime example in our
[1:33:29] time we often hear of the bride and the
[1:33:33] church there's often an attitude
[1:33:35] expressed that if we're part of the
[1:33:37] Bride we're somehow better than other
[1:33:40] Christians we sometimes speak of nominal
[1:33:44] Christians my brothers and my sisters we
[1:33:47] must be very very careful our standard
[1:33:50] is not the other person it's Christ
[1:33:54] don't be distracted from pursuing
[1:33:57] him look at Jesus who was more
[1:34:01] entitled than him he said to be like
[1:34:06] him to serve others not to be served by
[1:34:12] others and
[1:34:14] finally look at the lesson of
[1:34:17] manasse true
[1:34:19] repentance brings true forgiveness and
[1:34:22] restoration
[1:34:25] salvation as we turn this service to our
[1:34:28] pastor let's sing to be like
[1:34:39] Jesus to be to be like
[1:34:45] Jesus to be like
[1:34:48] [Music]
[1:34:50] Jesus on Earth I I
[1:34:56] long to be like
[1:35:01] him all through life's
[1:35:07] journey from Earth to
[1:35:12] Glory I only

[1:35:22] bit to be like
[1:35:28] Jesus to be like
[1:35:33] Jesus on Earth th
[1:35:38] love to be like
[1:35:43] him all through life
[1:35:49] Jour from Earth to
[1:35:52] Glory

[1:36:30] journey from Earth to
[1:36:35] Glory I only
[1:36:40] ask to be like him brother Jeremy bagot
[1:36:46] if you come and close brothers and
[1:36:50] sisters there is no
[1:36:52] story
[1:36:54] there's no book that has ever been
[1:36:57] written there's no movie that's ever
[1:36:59] been
[1:37:00] made there is nothing in the world that
[1:37:03] can
[1:37:04] compare to this
[1:37:07] book How The testimonies in this book
[1:37:11] and how the teaching in this book though
[1:37:13] it be thousands of years old can be
[1:37:15] applied to our lives every
[1:37:18] day I so
[1:37:21] blessed to hear about manasse and his
[1:37:27] testimony looks like we'll get to see
[1:37:30] him one day and shake his
[1:37:32] hand and say
[1:37:34] brother that repentance was a blessing
[1:37:38] to many many people and it was a
[1:37:40] blessing to me on one Wednesday night at
[1:37:43] the Tucson
[1:37:46] Tabernacle then
[1:37:48] [Music]
[1:37:51] um with these Kings
[1:37:54] and with these
[1:37:56] testimonies and how
[1:37:58] important just every word in this book
[1:38:02] of 2 Chronicles
[1:38:03] is how how it just it really
[1:38:07] illuminates much of the Old
[1:38:10] Testament I think brother Lyall will you
[1:38:13] agree with me that say to say brother

[1:41:36] in our minds so that we can remember the
[1:41:39] successes and we can remember the
[1:41:41] failures we can remember that Temple
[1:41:44] that was built up so beautiful and it
[1:41:46] didn't last
[1:41:47] long and then the enemy got in and he
[1:41:49] tore it down and that's what the enemy
[1:41:51] wants to do to these temples yeah
[1:41:53] the Lord May build us
[1:41:55] up but don't think that just because
[1:41:57] we're built up and we're Christians and
[1:42:00] and we Believers don't think that that
[1:42:02] Temple can't
[1:42:04] fallah if we allow the enemy to come in
