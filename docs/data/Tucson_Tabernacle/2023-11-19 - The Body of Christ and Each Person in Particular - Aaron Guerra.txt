you while we're standing let's just just bow our heads Lord this song song as brother Jonathan asked me what song I would want to come out and I saw his list and I said this one would be just the song that would fit right in and to hear him singing the other song in his language Lord just there's not a language you don't understand Lord father when any one of your children cry out to you when when when they look towards you Lord You're attentive you're drawn to their call Lord it's part of you Lord we are children of our father today Lord so we appreciate that Lord now help us Lord to minister that which you've placed within our heart Lord and may each one receive what they have need of today Lord we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen thank you you may be seated it's good to be in the house of the Lord again this evening around 3 o00 this afternoon there were four souls baptized brother ory had the privilege to baptize two young ladies and and two young boys all part of the same family their mom and father had been baptized here in 1999 by Brother green they knew uh the linards sister Olivia and brother Paul when they were still good they were friends of theirs and they wanted to be baptized so they came here to be baptized and we're able to have part of that and the joy of the grandparents and the parents to see their children baptized it was it was worth it just to to see somebody the the joy of that and they were talking about this is what we had we had the opportunity for this and now for them so he's working in in um Scottdale but they live up in Montana the grand the parents and stuff so but they were down here so said let's go to Tucson and let's get baptized so the angels in heaven Rejoice you know when one of the one of his children even if it was a wayward one as we were hearding the other day brother Dan was speaking of that prodigal son but the father when he was out looking down he said could this be the day he's coming back and it's just what a what a wonderful thing and and this morning brother Eli sharing his heart and he said let's open into the book of Ephesians and I said oh my he's going to preach my message it just seems to to be that how often that happens you go along the same line but I thought the spirit of the Lord moved and and it just it was a wonderful time this this this morning and I appreciate him that that he would come and and visit with us not only visit but be part of us and be at home with us and we would make him welcome and he said we're two or three are gathering in his name he'll be there in in the midst of them and without him it's just another gathering it's just it's could I say it's just noise it's just you know those but when he's here it's lifegiving lifechanging God working show appreciate that and I went I was talking to brother Daniel about this before before he uh he left on his trip and I was talking to Daniel and I said said you know and sister marily I said brother Daniel said on his WhatsApp message he said oh I sure wish you all were here and I said oh I'd like to see what sister Stephanie had to say about that one and sister marily said she probably would have said yes bring them all and it's it's good to to have fellowship with one another and and to want to be around one another you know when when a person has to be by themselves all the time and maybe you get used to it and you learn to do but you know when there's another one to help you along then there's another one to encourage you when there's somebody else to pick up the slack and kind of like to go in that direction and I told Brother Daniel I would something been in my heart for a while and just kind of looking at some things about the body of Christ and each member in particular and and each part that each person plays and you know some parts of the body some parts that are not evident things that are hidden you don't know much about them until they don't work until something goes wrong with that part then you're suddenly aware of it and so as Paul really addresses this this in the book of Ephesians and also in Corinthians but today just just a base to lay down what Paul says starting in in Ephesians and we we'll go with that direction but also some things that brother brandham said concerning that from the message the voice of the sign preached in 64 and I believe the brothers have that to put that up you can read it along it says Moses no one else could take his place no one else could do the job he was ordained to do it and Brethren sister if you've got eternal life you were ordained to do a certain thing now watch what he says maybe a good housewife maybe something else but nobody can take your place God has made you a place don't try to take somebody else's place that's carnal impersonations see shows that the there's something wrong with you so what you are just be what you are just exactly don't be nothing else and uh I I was thinking about that and I was talking a little bit we're talking with my wife and I said you know just some things are not noticed some some people come in they just seem to be so quiet but if none of the musicians showed up today nobody to play the piano nobody to song Lead everybody's like where are they but there's some folks that come in and out you don't hardly see them you don't you don't hear much about them but they're still part of the body of Christ they still have a point you know if you look at I was talking to uh um someone who knew a little bit I said and and they said I said you know you see the the fuselage of an airplane or maybe the body of the boat especially the older man they were all riveted now they can do some stuff differently today but back then it was all rivets and every rivet was necessary to maintain the full the full value the full structure the strength of that of that whatever it was and yeah you can fly without missing one here and missing one there but eventually as more and more begin to miss that's when you begin to have problems situations of things not not coming you know working together and and so some things may seem more important the others more noticeable but what is going on behind the scene usually is what's keeping that one that's noticeable going brother Brandon makes a statement and he says do you know what keeps me going do you know what the success of my my meetings are is those that are behind the curtain praying those who were praying last night those who spent time on their knees nobody knew it but God did and then the the what would began to take place it was that which those that had asked God to come and he began to minister and and you know there was a prophet in this age in this time who God said this is hear ye him now the brother brandom said the gift is not for me he said the gift is for you he would be standing there and the prayer pray line weak and tired and and struggling and the people would be going through being healed but he said the gift is not for me the gift is for you and again like some gifts are very evident and other things you don't know until they're not there in the message why brother B says I want to get on that this week if I could how that one Tri to impersonate another you can never do that God never made two people alike you just got you just go the way the Holy Spirit leads you we might take the millions that's in the world and not two of them got the same thumb print that's right God made them different he's a god of variety he made them different and don't try to impersonate the next fellow you do what God tells you to do and stay with it because there because there's no one in heaven or in Earth can take your place God Made You for a purpose stay with that but sometimes we look at what somebody else is doing and it just seems to be more glorious more out front more but God made you the way you are to do what he wants you to do yesterday or my wife went to see sister Mercy somano she had wanted her maybe she could do some some clothes fix some clothes for her so when she came home she said sister Mercy sent you this which was some homemade good Mexican food and um so went to eat it last night and and when we opened it up there was some homemade Mexican food there was some apples in there and there was a box of french fries you know and I thought well I'm going to eat I said no she sent she sent it also for the first time ever I've eaten two um what are they called we call them gorditas it's like a thicken chilada full of chili and all and a box of french fries with it that's what sister Mercy sent and I said she would be happy to hear that I ate it now if I went to the restaurant I probably wouldn't order that but we were kind of laughing about it but you know in her heart she s that and you know what I enjoyed it and brother Jonathan singing in his language and as I was sitting back there and I saying God understands it fully he knows everyone maybe if if brother Jonathan had sung a song that we didn't know didn't know the words too we would be listening to him singing We really wouldn't know but he sang a song we knew we could follow but God knows every language what he's done what he's created then in the message I identification he came as a redeemer and to redeem anything is to bring it back amen bring it back it was God's thought you think little you little me no one in the world could take my place nobody can take yours you being a Christian filled with a spirit God and before the foundation of the world seen you and knowed every feature that you got see and Jesus came come to bring bring you back I'm part of the family the family of God and it's a whole family you know I I've shared this with you when we had the had to have the my toe amputated and and all that we went through and and the doctors and and them helping you out you know change your diet do this do that and they're doing it for for a reason but the the case manager sat down me and my wife and she's explaining thing to us you know and she says there about 6,000 things going on in your body at all times she said that you're not even aware of until one of them doesn't go right and something happens you go to the doctor and the doctor begins to listen to your symptoms they take X-rays or or however they do it now you know and and scan you and all and they say oh they start looking for certain things that are not supposed to be that way you know this this blood count is too high or this blood count is too low this because God made a perfect body but sin got in there and change things but you understand you're part of the body of Christ acknowledge that say I am part of the body of Christ amen and every part is necessary he saw each each one of us not one greater than the other because every part is needed I'm I'm going to read this I didn't give it to the brothers it's just uh from daily strength and I really thought this would go well with tonight and then we're going to get into the book of Ephesians the scripture this is out of Acts 8: 26-31 and the angel of the Lord spake unto Phillip saying arise and go towards the South unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem un to Gaza which is the desert and he arose and went and behold a man of Ethiopia a unic of great Authority Under Candice Queen of the Ethiopians who had the charge of her treasure and had come to Jerusalem for to worship was returning and sitting in his Chariot read Isaiah the prophet then the spirit said unto Phillip go near and join thyself to this Chariot and Philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet Isaiah and said understandeth what thou readest and this was his answer and he said how can I except some man should guide me and he desired Phillip that You' come up and sit with him he says unless there's somebody here to help me how can I understand but God had already sent Phillip said go that way you're going to be needed down that way a normal Ethiopian unic was led to Christ simply because one man followed an abnormal leading from the Lord this is in the the story of book Vex tells us that we must always follow the leading of the Holy Spirit however crazy or contrary it may seem we we can know from experience and the scriptures that the Lord's ways are not our ways regardless of the situation or the circumstances we should always rely on his leading someone's salvation might depend on how much you do respond to the Holy Spirit what if it was that one opportunity that you this person was going to have and you were sent that way and you you said I don't want to do it now we know that God ordains these things but we have to be willing to say yes Lord I will Charles Spurgeon wrote about this particular Ethiopian he said he had followed the light he had and though he had not yet come to the full Glory of Christianity it was more than probable that he would do so because he was evidently prepared to follow truth wherever her flaming torch should lead the way if there's a desire there there's something to respond to it we see the lives working we see the Lord working in the lives of two individuals even though they didn't know what what was going to happen the Holy Spirit was in control that Ethiopian didn't know that what he was reading and the Holy Spirit provided him a teacher he used Phillip to teach him the truth Phillip a man with the Holy Ghost you a child of God with the Holy Ghost are in that same position to be used by God God will will use you if you stay focused on the Holy Spirit God will teach you through someone else if you are the in the right attitude this is how the Holy Spirit Works in his people by placing a thirst in one and placing a burden on another the two come together perfectly led by Christ what would it be if we laid our side aside our differences and simply relied on the leading of the Holy Spirit brother brandom said that's what the the Ian said to Phillip how can I know this lest some man Teach me the Holy Spirit was sent for a teacher let him come into your heart he will teach you that Jesus is the same he said when the Holy Ghost has come he will testify me and we know that's true Philip said the the angel told him go so Philip went he made himself available Hebrews 13:21 make you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ to whom be glory forever and ever amen many of us Wonder so often what is it exactly that the Lord wants me to do some might think on a daily basis and what must I do for the Lord and how do I do it it is right to think that way when we G gave our hearts to the Lord we submitted ourselves to a life of service to the king going about regular business then might seem like nothing is being accomplished toward the towards a king's business even Jesus as a young boy was about his father's business and and sometimes we compare ourselves to others compare ourselves to this and it looks greater it looks better it looks more effective but if you could see the whole structure you would realize that every every part is needed you must realize one thing that God will use however much of yourself you give him in whatever capacity he created you for to some he gave the ability to sing others to preach others to organize and manage and some to encourage God had God has made you perfect for the work he needs you to do and it is he who will develop that skill and and gift in his own time frame it is up to you simply to surrender your gift back to his service for him to use what whenever and however he chooses and that's the hard part I have a gift I know I have this Lord and this is how I think you should use it this is how I think it should be applied I'm ready now I'm ready today and God says no it's not time just wait the Lord could prepare you 50 years for 5 minutes of service for him someone else he might just prepare for 5 minutes for 50 years of service and you say that's not fair but God knows what he's doing your job is to just be usable living live pleasing to him wait on the Lord and He will use you you are precious to the kingdom of God because you were fearfully and wonderfully made just let him use you in his way in his time and the message what went ye out to see brother bam says when I think of that it it wakes me to something what must we do I said to the wife the other day honey I'm 50 years old and I can't be here much longer then I walked out I stood there in the woods I went out hunting I stood there in the woods a little bit I thought of that 50 years old what's the matter then something said and and said to me God could train you for 50 years to do 50 minutes of work whatever the training's been God knows what he's doing he's TR he trained Moses 80 years to get 40 years of service from him God's training his people God's training his church if we only if we're only willing to let God have his way to do that thing which is right if we're only willing to submit ourselves unto him that's a thing to do God takes the simple things you know this water has been sitting every service there's a bottle of water up here or a cup of water and I never drink it and then after I said why didn't I drink any water it's the problem with the water isn't it no it's just me not taking a drink of water sometimes when we look at things we look at them under our own perspective and it's not always right so we're going to get into some scriptures here in Ephesians and Paul when he's speaking we know to Ephesians he's speaking to a mature Church a group you know when he talks to the Corinthians with it's always been about a church that was still going through a lot of growing up and but to the Ephesian but he writes the same thing to both he doesn't change the scripture for the Ephesian for the Ephesians or or the Corinthians he just ministered to them in the level where they need it so we're going to go through the first four chapters of Ephesians just picking out some scriptures here where you'll realize it's God who's plac the gift in you it's not you choosing the gift you want because most of us would choose this over here and very little of this is needed would be getting done but every part is needed so Ephesians chap 1 verse one we'll start with that Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus he addresses you as a saint and as a faithful one that's how God looks at you one of his one of his his own and and I like this Paul an apostle of Christ Jesus by the purpose of God or for the purpose of God now we're we're reading where Paul is saying this but it's your name in there you've got to apply yourself in the scripture and sisters this means you too sometimes well that's for that position for a brother and that no there's a place for every one of us by the will of God not by any Merit of my own if anything if you look at the first portion of Paul's life if anything he was contrary to everything what God was doing and he was self-righteous in what he was doing these people are going against the law that it was established by Moses and we we've just had all this teaching through the through the book of Acts and now getting into the old how the law and the law and the law in one sense it's easier to live by the law I can do this and I can't do this I can go this fast and I can't go this fast but when God gives you Grace and says I will lead you I will guide you sometimes it's just be it's easier just to be told what to do in the in working in in in the uh countertop shop I'd have some guys that just tell me what to do and I'll do it and others would say teach me how to do it and then I can do it myself and God wants folks that would say Lord I want to be led directed get Guided by you you teach me what my place and part is and then in verse four of chapter 1 according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love that's how he chose us he says he choses chap verse 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will we were designed before by him for the positions of sons to himself Sons and Daughters part of his thing it was his children in his doing verse six to to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved so Paul establishes it right in the beginning it's God's choosing it's God's desire it's what he wanted to do and you were included in what he desired to do and then if we go over to verse n having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself you know and if it was that if it was me telling you that hey this is what I want for you and this because you know I would say um maybe you should go find somebody a little better somebody can better keep their word but we're talking about the Eternal Creator we're talking the one that understands it all and knows it all and he chose to do it this way because he's able to do so and I like it this way having made clear to us the secret of his purpose in agreement with the design which he had in mind to put into his hands now I I uh was having a conversation with with brother Lyall when we first got to to meet him and get to know some of the things that he's done same thing with brother Mike yarro and and um and their work and all but God gave them that ability put those things in their mind that to me it's just a whole another language it's foreign is Chinese would be to me what they were talking and one day they were both standing outside here talking and I got up close and listened to their conversation and might as well have been another language I didn't understand half of what they were saying so I stopped them and I said Brothers I could not re recommend your brain to anybody I said but mine would be worth a lot of money well that caught their attention they both look I brother Lyle didn't know me very well then he was relatively new and had he hadn't been here for a while and brother Mike yes so they gave me a strange look I said look at you your brains millions and millions and millions of miles of usage in those brains they've been put to work work they've been they they've extracted everything you could mine is brand new hardly even touched yet probably still in the original package I said that's why it would be worth so much a 1959 brain that hasn't even been hardly used brother Mike just looked at me says get out of here but to listen to them talk and see some of the things that brother L the Lord has allowed him to design to develop that and go it's amazing but that's what God chose to do with life brother Mike Aro was listed in the top 10 uh doctors or or um scientist I guess at the University of Arizona hospital I was talking to his boys after after to John and them after the the memorial service they didn't even know that about their dad because he said nothing about it he just went and did it it's the one that stands on the Mountaintop and says hear me hear me hear me that you got to be a little more leery about sometimes but God has done this and when you realize it's God has done it for you then give him the glory and let him use you the way he wants to be doing in verse 11 in whom also we have OB obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will and his will is perfect then we'll jump to verse 22 through and 23 and has put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all the things of the church and if you ever wanted a headship that's the perfect headship because he knows all things he has control of it all and he has the best intention for you and he has given him to be the head over all things to the church a head both of guidance and government and likewise of life and influence to the whole and every member of it she said I'm just a little part yet he's still concerned which is his body the fullness of him that filth all and all I'm so glad I'm a part part of the family of God join HS part of it every part of it will be there go to Ephesians chapter 2 veres 8-10 for by Grace ye are saved through faith and that not of yourself it is a gift of God by Grace God's choosing he chose to have mercy on you he desired it you know why because there is Mercy mer in him there is Grace in him he is giving out what he is you know uh uh that stream that that little U fountain that brother brand said he he used to go drink out of he said if I if I could talk to it if it could talk back to me and I would ask it he said what makes you so happy why are you bubbling all the time is it because the animals come and drink it would say no is it because the birds come by is it because I say no what is it's just something in inside me that's bubbling and I can't help it it's Christ in me the hope of glory he says it is a gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast and this is where it gets a little bit hard for us because we want to do works because we feel and honestly believe that's what pleases God that's what's evident for us when you see somebody doing something somebody cleaning uh brother Ben comes here opens up the door turns the air conditioner on cleans out the front and all and sometimes brother Ben's not here and we get here and everything's still off and our first question is where's brother Ben because you're used to it taking care of it you know but it's it's it's he says not of Works lest any man should boast brother Ben has never said haha you can't do this without me in fact he'll call and say I can't be here tonight he's one of the kindest men I've met and and most people and and I'll just be honest with it look at that as a starting job but it's his desire to do it I want to be a doctor I want to be the head of this I want to be this because everybody's going to notice me but somebody has to do the other part and if if that's what he wants me to do Lord help me to have the attitud to do that not of Works lest any man should boast and then verse 10 for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them so there is no fear in them because God has already ordained it Lord you know what you want me to do you know what it is help me just to trust in you and do what you want workmanship workmanship refers to more than the product of creation it also refers to the degree of skill which with which a product is made that degree of skill imparts value to the thing made for example we could say that vase is of excellent workmanship the vase itself is lovely but its value is derived from the talents of the one who designed and produced it with that definition in mind workmanship may be a more fitting term than either Masterpiece or handiwork because of the emphasis it places on the Creator rather than the creation it's his workmanship and he doesn't do anything wrong or failure he doesn't have to go back and try it again he doesn't have to go back and read the book and see where did I miss it where did I get it when when I would lay out the countertops and and we would draw them out we were working with acrylics and and you would lay it all out template before it cut I used to tell the the guys as I was training them and I was doing a lot of training then and I would say take the templates take the measurement double check everything I laid out I may have read 89 but I went 98 or I may have taken the the measure measuring tape and burned an inch hold it at the one inch Mark go out to that but forget to add the other inch on the end so now you're an inch short and if they took 10 or 15 minutes before we actually took a blade and started cutting they could catch those airs and it was a whole lot easier to erase that Mark and do another Mark than it was to have to rebuild it after it been cut too short and God's workmanship is perfect it's without flaw is without failure he said so we are his workmanship you but it gives emphasis to the Creator rather than the creation because you are doing your part because you are letting God work through you you know who's getting glory god is getting glory and he deserves it all it's when we try to get the glory and we try then that we begin to to cause trouble verse 20 and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone it starts from him and it ends with him in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an Holy Temple of the lord it's not this building I appreciate everything we have in this building how many folks come and they say oh that we could have this oh that we could have it like you oh that we you know I I know Sister L and sister Grace enough if they could have somebody else play they would have somebody else play am I right you've said it enough times because they're not here to say hey you got to listen to me they're doing and others would say you guys are so privileged to have them mo sometimes it gets uh what's the word we just get used to it and we forget to appre appreciate what we got we got brother Daniel now in the guitar up there and it does make a difference sometimes brother Daniel may not feel that way but sometimes just listening to that strumming that beat and it's a blessing every part whatever it is of whom all the building fitly framed the whole fabric of The Universal Church Rises up like a great p of living materials unto an Holy Temple in the Lord living materials you and me in whom ye also are building together for an habitation of God through the spirit why because we're God is wanting someone some place to dwell and to walk on this Earth again to manifest himself and he's chosen me and you and every one of his Ephesians chapter 3 and we're just going to take verse 6 that the Gentiles should be fellow Heirs of the same body and partakers of the promise in Christ by the gospel and I find myself included right there the Gentiles a lot of this the first part of the Old Testament was speaking of the to Israel to Abraham and all his but if you saw brother bam said you've got to see Jesus Christ in every scripture if you didn't you go back and read it again and there in Hosea as our brother spoke today of that perfect type of Christ marrying a bride having a bride and she goes away yet he goes back to redeem her and pays the price for her full Redemption I was included in that that my name was there I've gone wrong off him I failed him I've turned my back on him I've done what I should but he went back to bring me back to him that's what Paul says here he says through though that the Gentiles should be fellow Heirs of all the promises of all the things receiving the same and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel now we'll get into Ephesians chapter 4 and this is more where Paul really begins to speak here breaking if you could say starting to show how this body is begin to be formed Ephesians 41 and Paul says I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech beg implore recommend and just just desire that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called what God has called you to do walk worthy of it you do not make yourself worthy he makes you worthy he saw you already doing it he puts a nature in you to do it he gives you the desire to do it and and I could call some of you by name here and see what you all do I I've been in here with and I'm not going to call them by name but I've seen some of the sisters just walking up and down the benches and straightening all the books and making everything look nice and neat because the books don't do it by themselves at least I've never seen it happen that way I've seen the sisters doing it and I've done it myself sometimes walking through and picking up you know after the kids of somebody didn't clean up after the kids were eating cookies in the back rows or something like that and cleaned it up it's part of the nature of doing those things nobody nobody tells me nobody has told me so I'll just ask don't start doing it please do this go pick up that go after that you got to you no no I I when he used to sit there in the back where brother Lyle is now I did for many years kind of you know watching that door and all brother green stood there one day and he's just looking at me and sometimes you're not too sure what he's thinking but you're you kind of feel like you were about to hear something from him so I said brother green I never put myself in this position because I wanted to be here just it needed to be done so I came and started doing it and he looks at me he says brother Aaron God put that in you so that's why you're doing it he said and he just walked away and that's how God works uh he doesn't call you know one of you or or brother Merl over and say brother Merl do I have your permission to let brother son he puts it in that brother's heart and in brother Merl's heart he put brother Mer's heart to pray for the brother that's doing it that's how God works so Paul maybe in another way I then the prisoner in the Lord make this request from my heart that you will see that your behavior is a credit to the position which God purpose God's purpose has given you sometimes reading it in another translation just opens it up a little bit the purpose that God placed you therefore with all loneliness and weekness and longsuffering forbearing one another in love loneliness not you trying to exalt yourself meekness keeping a sweet humble spirit and with longsuffering because sometimes people judge you wrong they miss you know your intention your heart but somebody didn't see that that way forbearing one another in love love covers them multitude of sins the scripture says and I'm glad because I need his love to cover me through his blood with all gentle and quiet behavior taking whatever comes uh putting up with one another in love and uh you know I I shared this morning what we both looked at and Sh said I'm sorry you had to put up with this and she turned around looked at no you had to put up with me and we just smile to each other there's a you get to know each other and we knew we both meant hey it's okay it's all right endeavoring making an effort to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace there's only one spirit of God and that's his Spirit to keeping and and his Spirit has a peace that comes with it us an assurance that comes with it a blessing that comes with it he says endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit that Mutual Union and Harmony which is a fruit of the spirit the bond of peace is love when you love someone you honestly love someone you can accept their failures you can accept their wrongdoings because the greatest one that loved you accepted yours and took it upon himself when I wasn't worthy when I couldn't save myself he said I'll go take your place and do it for you he said I'll put my shoulder and help bury the care of the burden verse 7 but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ to every one of us now now sometimes it takes some growing into that gift understanding that what it is that you don't you just don't lay and sit there I'm going to wait till the gift comes upon me and then I'll begin to manifest the gift no there's a working of the gift there's a learning how to surrender to yield and being a part of growing up as a young child and growing up to being a little bit bit older I remember Asher about 3 years old and he got this tool belt with with plastic tools in it and he was he was getting to talking quite a bit make himself understood and we were putting up a a a uh ceiling fan and it had one of those sensors in it and I wired It reversed the wiring and it didn't want to work and he's looking at it and he goes Papa if I had my tools I could fix that for you and my thought is when you're 16 years old I'm going to ask you and see if you'll come over and still want to do that no papa I'm with my friends no papa I'm with my girlfriend you know something else going but he said and then Abby told me yeah we were over she was over at the in-laws and he's walking around looking at his grandpa's house over there and he said Mom if I had my tools I could fix right there where it's not fixing Grandpa's rough and if they gave him a lad and Tool he probably would have went up there you know but he's not at that place where he can do it that comes with time and learning and experience God places you in a position for you to learn what God wants you to do by experience to comfort someone because you've been through that already to help someone because you've Beed that burden before according to Christ as Christ is pleased to give to each the measure of the gift of Christ wherein he saith when he ascended on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men and then probably one of the most used scriptures and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and some teachers five we call it the five full ministry and I guess nobody else has anything but them that's how some of the five full min Ministry acts at times you got to listen to me you got to do it my way I'm no because he says for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ that is their work because that portion of the body needs to help the rest of the body you know when when you feed yourself and you especially eat the things you should be eating doing the healthy type eating um whether it's good for you or bad for you most of it goes through the mouth first right because that's how most of us eat I think now I know if you're there's some conditions where they have to feed you through IVM but I'm talking the natural you know it it is in other words for the edifying of the body of Christ God chose to use men to speak to minister it's how God chose to do that but that man that God has chosen to do has to understand like Phillip God sends me to do this God tells me to do this God is working through me it's God in Me Not me telling God how to handle this and some of the one of the things that you you know the the thing that's going on in today's message that we don't need the fful ministry anymore we need this God took it in the scripture he'll take it out when he's done every part of the body is needed for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ that's me and you the body of Christ for the equipping of the Saints for the work of service to the building up of the body of Christ and I appreciate brother Lyall and brother Dan what they just did here going through the book of Acts and neither one of them ever stood up and said you got to listen to me it's got to be this way they stayed with the scripture and they encourage each one of us to receive what God has for us till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man a whole man a complete man a builtup adult yes that's what he's talking about there unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ the same way he learned and the same way he grew till he heard his father say this is my beloved Son hear ye him he was tested he was tried he was proved he can be touched by The Filling of their in of our infirmities he can understand where we say I I don't understand this I can't he went through that he even cried out father if it be thy will let's do this differently but he said I yield to your will Lord I'm so glad he did till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect a whole complete unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and as Paul said Christ in you the hope of glory so if it's Christ in you the hope of glory you know what you share Christ to others and you know what he becomes their hope of glory also as we saw that the two young lady and the two young men getting bapt today baptized today and they have that same opportunity and and ability to receive the Holy Spirit the hope of glory in them oh but brother they didn't come to our church they didn't come our way they didn't do this leave that to God you pray for them you be a Christian before them you be an example to them you be a help to them to get to that same place where by the grace of God you've been able to get to and then Paul says in 14 that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine that we henceforth be no more children now all of us to the best of my knowledge looking at all of you we all started the same as a newborn to whatever age we are and we all had to grow and learn is there anybody that just came out perfect you're willing to raise your hand no probably not no we all went through a process say that children growing so Paul says this he says that we be no more children tossed to and fro but we've grown up beyond that point to understand those things to have experienced them not just by head knowledge and hearing but by application by learning and put into use brother Daniel you're you're going through some medical training and stuff like that are you anybody need surgery brother Daniel's a I noticed nobody volunteered not quite ready there yet are you but you're willing to go to whatever you're going to right that's that training that learning and having a right attitude a right motive a right and you can be be taught you can be trained and maybe one of these days brother Daniel is going to be able to help one of us we had a brother in the Spanish Church who was a doctor and and he had actually got his his Doctrine in Mexico but it didn't cross over so he just became a a physician's assistant here but he he because they really appreciate him where he worked at SEL mind they would let him bring some of the stuff home and he did some minor surgery on me at my house at no cost but we knew about it and I had full confidence in him because he knew what he was doing but had it been brother Daniel H he might said let's not this time you know but Lord will over time it would be the same with you because you've learned you've grown the same thing with handling this word you give it to a novice they have a lot of desire and want to but who knows what could happen but when you give it to someone who has met Christ and has experienced Christ and has walk with Christ and knows him he can take this word and said look what it's done to me let my life be an Evidence of what this word of God does it says henceforth we be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive and I I I pray that that wouldn't be true but it does happen because it's happened to me where they've come to me there was a I didn't know them we went to to visit at a uh a family was coming to church they had their their um daughter son had a birthday and our our children about the same size they invited us all and we come walking into the house and there's a couple of Brothers there that I didn't know but they were brothers they were there so greeted them all and one of the brothers says where do you go to church oh we're at susson Tabernacle I might as well have said I go to a Catholic church because you could see it in his face like oh my have all the places to go why there so they sat down and we we and he began to preach to me and preach to me and tell me and tell me this that and the other the other two brothers knew it so they just walked around they never stopped that I walked in with because they already knew well after a while I I'd heard enough he was he had his eyes closed and just preaching I got up and walked away he kept preaching to the wall he didn't even know I had left the other brother tapped him on the shoulder and said brother the brother has left already and he looked up and I wasn't there anymore I was watching from over there you know what I've run into him before still my brother I have no reason to look down on him and hate him and still my brother because that was me at one time but God rich in Mercy reached down and got a hold of my life and now by the grace of God maybe we can be a help to someone else but speaking the truth in love what did we hear this morning love is God's motive love is what God is who he is and sometimes when he is correcting he's correcting because he loves you because if he didn't care he would say whatever go do what you ever want whatever makes you happy but he knows the end result on that speaking the truth and love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ speaking the truth in love truth is never to give way to false Doctrine but it must be spoken in love some cling to the truth tenaciously but forget to speak it in love and as a dad and his mom especially when the young ones are first growing up and you get impatient you get tired I don't know how much love is being expressed around that time you know I I I some of my girls and said how come she got away with it and I didn't because you happen to be the last one born in the family and you got away a whole lot more ask your older sister she'll tell you I couldn't do that I got in trouble for that they they they learned how to work that uh Abby Rachel and nah were in the same bedroom before we got the the extra bedroom and they would get quite loud at night and dad was trying to go to sleep and I would politely yell out down from the from the hallway go to sleep you know and they wouldn't so they would hear me coming and I would open their door and one would be kneeling praying the other one would be under the covers and I don't know where the third one was until they told me she would slide in behind the door once I opened it and I didn't know she was behind the door but I would say boy these angels one is praying one is sleeping but just a minute ago they were making all this noise and I'd go back to my bedroom and then later on life they told me what they were doing if they tried it now I'd be worried did did we not do a job a good job in growing them up but you know we all learned that way we all had to grow up by the lessons we learn the things don't do that again that hurts don't touch that again that burns now but it must be done in love love motive behind the correction needs to be love for your benefit for your growth for you to be more Christlike for you to get to know him more to you to be able to be effective to help with a motive of love then he says from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself and again Paul says in love so looking at that whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth every part is needed every cell every whatever it is I I was listening to a brother one day and he was talking about how he had gone to the dentist because one of the MERS was cracked and it was hurting so the dentist gave him two options he said I can do a crown or I can pull it out so he asked and he said what's the difference 2,000 for the crown and 50 for the pull so he said pull it for $50 and he said but later on I'm eating something hard and crunchy and it pokes me and I thought to myself oh that I had paid for the crown and sometimes if we're not careful we find ourselves saying oh my Lord had I not done that had I done what you said had I had let you work through me maybe I wouldn't be going through this today from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth but I'm just a little nobody but you're needed you're part of the body of Christ according to the effectual working in the measure of every part no we can't I can't run on my pinky I run using my legs but when I take a grip of something my pinky is involved with that it's what it's supposed to do there's a uh you may have seen it in Snoopy it's he's he's jogging Snoopy from peenuts and all these thoughts it's all his body parts talking the eyes saying no you really need me because you need to see where you're going the hands are saying no you need me the arm because you need that momentum they're going on the heart's talking I'm pumping finally the feet say would you be quiet I'm carrying all of you every part is needed and you each one of you are a part of the body of Christ so this is just that part just to establish that each one of us is part of the body of Christ and each one of us has a part to play and each one is necessary even if you're young or maybe you're getting to the other side now and and and and you're looking back but you still have a part to play until God says we're done it's time to go home I enjoy it when uh um some of the young people come up here and I say the young people some of the the younger ones was Sister Angela brought the young children to sing it's a joy to to see that in all that they're being taught they're being brought up that way cuz they're going to learn something from somewhere my daughter and now works in a school with little children three-year-olds and things like that and little children like that when they can talk they will tell you everything that's going on Rachel my old my youngest daughter worked at a preschool for I think 7 years and little little one would come in Oh Daddy was hitting Mama again today oh this they just spoke what it was because it was happening in the home I don't think very often did they have one come in do you know what Mom and Daddy did with me before I came to school what they prayed with me they read the Bible and they asked God to go with me to church to school I don't think you hear very much of that in in school today but oh what a blessing that would be for the children what a blessing that is for all of us when we're lifting one another up and helping for the body of Christ to grow every part and one of the things is don't compare yourself to another part compare yourself to what the word of God says about you and say Lord am I fitting to have the musicians would come up am I fitting to that part am I if not hone me some more work with me some more until I can be part of that body where you say she's whole some complete she's she's complete let's go home together maybe if the Lord allows another time we'll get into dealing with more how all that works together what some of those were me every joint supplieth how does that work not so much in a a medical way although a lot of it has referred to that but rather how we help one another I know the other day my my wife went with a friend of hers to have lunch and she lives up on the hill Foothills over there and she said oh you should have seen the birds they were just all over that place and there were deer in the backyard and all of this and she came so happy because she loves those things she loves she still sit on our window and look at the birds I saw a bird with a you know the orange it just pleases her makes her happy somebody else may be looking at something totally different different God knows each part of the body to each one is given as a spirit gives it and you would say yes Lord I surrender to that just bow our heads father your word is is true and it's unfailing when you cried out on the cross it is finished every need had been met and supplied now we were just watching it come into its maturity and its fullness Lord we are part of the body of Christ not by our own choosing but because you chose us you called us as we heard there when brother Eli was ministering about Peter at the end of you're talking to Peter and asking him do you love me do you love me Peter is thinking and answering yes I love you but probably thinking of what had just happened and how he had denied you but you saw past that and saw that what you had placed in Peter and you said feed my sheep give unto them share with what you have Lord let each one of us be willing to do that no matter where we're at maybe just a simple smile just a good morning or even a God bless you something that would be a help to somebody that day Lord a a a cool drink of water Lord maybe
