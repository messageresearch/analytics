that change my heart oh god make it ever true you say you know lord if if my heart was changed i'd never have a problem no you still got this flesh but god looks down into the heart and he sees the

prayer for traveling mercy says to indiana um and i praise my aunt lisa she got a job starting on monday so amen god is able and then the prayer for malachi murray he's home with an upset stomach so sister loves requesting that and then on facebook was posted from brother david sotelo to remember brother charlie sotelo that's his older brother brother charlie had had a knee surgery about five years ago and it's been a lot of pain and he uses one of the the motorized carts to get around and it's getting difficult to get on and get off so the sotelo family has been part of the tucson tabernacle for from way back towards the beginning so they've been let's remember brother charlie in the family this time so my wife lord willing will be coming home tomorrow afternoon from indiana and i just she asked me if i missed her and i said oh that's what's happened we kind of play with each other that way and she'll send something and i'll return it but it's been a blessing for nina and for steven and it's something that you know to have mama there and through what they went through so thank the lord that he's he's met the need there and and god is able more than able to do that so if you'll stand and you have a need you say lord i have an idiot acknowledge that brother ronnie gladwell would you you come up and and address that with a prayer request you'd always say well you know i come and and every time i do have a need well he's an unfailing god in this life paul said there will be these things but he's faithful and and he never misses an appointment so let's believe together as brother ronnie who prays with us you know these traveling mercies i i don't take them frivolously when they ask for them we really need to sincerely ask i drive a truck for a living i've seen lives changed in a moment one person looks down and cars turn around and they go over and they're laying dead in the median you know i do this for a living i've seen so many and i know that traveling mercies when you ask for our brothers i don't mean to scare you because god's always taking care of his people but you know we ask and he he does this for us but we don't want to take it frequently where else can you be that your life can change forever and those around you in a car going down the road at 75 miles an hour think about it wow so when they said that i go oh if he calls me i'm going to take it serious but you know our brother charlie i've known the sotelos for years and years you know he suffered for a long time with this you know and he just wants some relief you know and i believe the lord wants good things for us amen so can we pray yes heavenly father first of all we come before you through the shed blood of the lord jesus christ with faith believing that we ask you to forgive us our sins there be nothing between us and you for these prayer requests lord i know each and every one of myself we take them very seriously father these people are in need and they trust us and you that we will do what we need to do father because we cannot do things for ourselves but lord we know you can and we know lord as brothers and sisters in christ we we depend upon each other to care for each other and to ask for each other i know lord when i've had my mother a different one say we've been praying for you i know what a it just makes me warm all inside knowing someone cares enough to bring my name up in prayer and lord we bring these that that are traveling father that have special needs that that whatever their destination and their agenda might be where they're going that would be a positive and a one that lord that there would be no no sorrow and a in an accident or anything and lord if there was a near miss we know your angels are their father but we go before you in the precious name of the lord jesus just asking that you would be merciful to our brothers and sisters and each and every hand that went up lord we know that each one of us as long as we are in these bodies we are needful every moment that we live every breath that we take father we need you and we know lord that you will by your mercy you will show us how much that we are dependent upon you and then we will thank you then you will bless us it's all about a relationship between us and you and you and us lord that adam lost but because of the shed blood we have access to the very throne of god and lord we know you'd love us and we love you lord just help us to love you more forgive us for not loving you enough but oh god we know you you you've shown your love father now it's up to us lord to do what you say and obey your word and to trust you i ask all these things in the wonderful lovely name of the lord jesus amen amen we do do take things for granted sometimes we just you know we might get in our vehicle and drive off and and just expect to get there do what we need to do and come back but for some life change completely but every day everything we do our attitude our actions let's always remember the lord first because he's never left us alone this morning the johnson family has a song special is as you're seated and they make their way up we'll sing

and so we thank the lord that we can come and and receive from his word today and worship him and give him the honor and the praise that he is worthy of this morning amen we just bring you greetings this morning in the name of the lord jesus christ greet you from the church back in north carolina our pastor brother josh bennett and the believers there and uh thank the lord for the wonderful things that the lord is doing here in this body of believers and we're grateful to just be able to come this morning and yield ourselves so the lord can speak to our hearts amen is that what you come for this morning to hear from him we'll just invite you to turn if you'd like to turn with me in your bibles to isaiah chapter 55. i want to take a few verses of scripture there appreciate brother matt inviting us to come this way and be with you this weekend appreciate the music and the worship this morning these different ones lending their talents to the lord to be a blessing to him and to each of you we thank the lord for that amen just before we read in these verses of scripture this morning let's go to the lord once more in prayer if you have a need in your life you just like to lift your hand to the lord say lord jesus remember me lord and speak to my heart today heavenly father lord we're so grateful this morning lord that we can call you our father and realize that we are your children your sons lord and your daughters we are your subjects lord and we are your bride and father we know that even the least lord of our needs or our concerns lord is in your care this morning lord and you are concerned for them father we believe lord that we don't gather in vain today or that even our meeting today is a coincidence lord or just by chance father we believe that before there was a world that you knew this service would be today you knew everyone who would be present everyone who would be in attendance lord and we believe you have provided something lord you have placed lord a provision for us even in this great hour we're living in lord and things are coming upon the earth and upon humanity lord upon our nation and our world lord that our unprecedented father and scientists and doctors leaders are scrambling father how to respond and how to react but lord we're serving a god this morning father we're thankful to know that you have already given us lord you've already provided lord all that we have need of and we believe the revealed word of the hour lord holds father god even rapturing faith everything that we need lord to be taken from this earth lord we want to feed upon that this morning lord and we pray that your voice will speak to us in this service today lord we could read the words from the pages but it will take the holy spirit father lord to bring it to life lord and to open our understanding to it lord and to to use the word lord to speak to the very condition of our lives at this moment lord to transform our lives lord to change the circumstances to lord to to to rebuke lord the the afflictions lord and the symptoms lord or even the struggles we're going through physically spiritually whatever it may be lord we yield to you that today father god we we speak the name of jesus lord we we plead the blood of jesus lord over our lives and over this service today and we pray that you will have your way lord in the service move me aside lord and every one of us today father help us to enter a channel father where you can speak to us by your spirit lord and by your word we thank you for it and we ask lord that you'll grant it in jesus name we pray amen amen we'll read uh what i'm certain is a very familiar portion of scripture from isaiah chapter 55 and uh we will read verses 10 and 11. for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sore and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto i sin it amen i believe that this morning may the lord add his blessings to the reading of his word and you can be seated today amen we just read these verses from the scripture and and the the lord god is likening his word to the rain and the snow which which falls to the earth and that rain comes with a purpose amen that rain comes to quicken something that is already already in place already present though buried beneath the surface of the earth there there's a life there there's a seed there and when the rain falls upon it and the sun shines upon it when the conditions amen are are are such that it's conducive to life then the potentials that were hidden beneath the earth's surface bloom forth into life amen and so uh that that life that hidden life there is actually the glory of the earth waiting to be revealed and waiting to be expressed so when the when the rain falls upon it it reveals a hidden glory amen it brings forth something that otherwise would remain dormant or or would remain in a mystery form so god god sends his word to express his glory within his creation amen i know that the devil has done a lot uh to pervert the earth and to pervert even the the atmospheres of the earth to try to twist uh the earth into some other uh death and corruption and all of the the agenda of satan but i want to say this morning amen his purpose is defeated and god's purpose will prevail amen even though it seemed like he achieved a victory there in eden he really didn't win a victory all he did was made possible for god's great plan of redemption to unfold and for god's desires as a father as a healer as a savior and as a redeemer to be manifested and that that's one of the things i love every time it seems like the devil gets a punch in all it does is just give a greater opportunity for god's glory to be revealed amen and so we we serve a mighty god this morning amen and so i want to just begin by by looking back in eden this morning and and the great mystery that god was revealing there not only in the creation of the earth and the uh how he divided the the land from the seas and and the the heavens above the firmament above the firmament below and all of those things but yet even in the creation of the the botany life the animal life the birds and the fish and the the beasts of the earth amen there was a there was a higher expression that god was desiring to reveal and that was to to ex to to play something or to create something on the earth in his own image and that was man amen and man was created in the image of god and then he was formed into a body of flesh to exercise dominion over the earth and to be a god over this earth in its creation but even when that man was created there was a mystery within him waiting to be revealed and something that would be even more glorious in its expression amen was waiting to be separated from adam and revealed and and uh to become the further expression of himself and to even become an agency which would enable him to reproduce himself and to to uh for life to be multiplied upon the earth and so the bible tells us if we read in genesis chapter 2 and and beginning at verse 21 the bible says and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and if you look at the last phrase there of verse 23 22 he says and brought her unto the man now i like to i like to focus on that phrase just for a moment here and think about what must that have been like for god to place adam into a deep sleep to remove something from his side and perhaps to to take that portion of adam over into another area of the garden and form form that into the the the feminine expression of who adam was into mrs adam into uh adam in a bride form and and so to to be a beautiful creature adam wasn't so beautiful to look upon but here was a a beautiful revelation of himself amen and so then to to wake her to consciousness and maybe to lead her back through that garden until she reached the place where she started from oh my a journey of realization amen a journey of identification to be able to be taken back to the place where she came from and then you know no matter what else she saw in that garden all of the flowers all of the trees all of the other living creatures all of the birds all the the lakes and the forests and the mountains everything she saw there was only one thing amen that could truly reveal to her her identity i mean there was only one creature that she could truly bond with there there was only hallelujah there was only one thing she matched amen she was a matching piece to the masterpiece amen and only when she reached adam amen could she begin to realize or truly understand her purpose amen and and and the reason she had been formed and so the bible tells us in verse 23 that when adam looked upon his wife he said this is now born of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man so when adam made that great declaration amen this is now bone of my bones and and flesh of my flesh it confirmed to her that she had arrived back at her place of origin amen it confirmed to her that her search was over amen there was there was no need to look any further she had found her companion and then she had found the one that she would complete and the one that would complete her amen that was a true union that was taking place there and so we realized that prior to the fall she was co-equal with him whatever power she could watch him exercise she could realize i also have that same power hallelujah whatever whatever characteristics she observed in adam she could realize i too have these same characteristics oh my friend oh my my mind is is fast forwarding 2 000 years later after this was forfeited by the transgression and jesus said the works that i do shall you do also oh my what is well here was a second adam and he was speaking amen to his feminine expression to his church to his disciples and he said the works that i do shall you do also and greater than these amen he was he what he was trying to do amen was was was help them to understand i i i tell you this morning and this this may sound like i'm venturing out there just a bit but i'm not jesus didn't come amen to display his life simply or only for us to look upon him and admire him but by looking upon him we could come to the understanding of the realization of who we are amen when when peter recognized who christ was he said whom do men say that i have well he got all kinds of answers but then he said who do you say that i am and when peter said thou art the christ the son of the living god when peter recognized who christ was then christ immediately turns around and says and thou art peter amen he was placing peter positionally amen he was recognizing who he was and he says upon this rock i'll build my church and he wasn't talking about peter because peter was a failure he could hardly say or do anything right but jesus knew amen there was there was representation on the inside of peter amen the same qualities were there amen he was he was he was part of the same life amen and he knew the baptism of the holy ghost would quicken those potentials with him amen he said peter he didn't say if you're converted he said when you're converted strengthen the brethren amen so here uh i've got to get back to eden just for a moment but when god formed the the feminine part of adam he brings her he brings her back to adam and then adam makes this great declaration bone of my bones flesh of my flesh amen you have arrived oh my adam was a product of the spoken word he was a manifested son of god he was an extension of god's character and god's power on the earth and she was an extension of who adam was it means she wasn't just a bone or she was much more than than a bone or a part of him that that part of him that was removed i i i believe in many ways a bone was was a was a was figurative amen of something god removed from adam's side she she really wasn't just just a piece of bone but she was a part of his heart and she was the she was the very essence the very substance of who he was amen something that could could not be expressed from him in the in the male form oh my been in the feminine expression it could even express something perhaps amen even more glorious than the male expression but she wasn't just a ball and and she wasn't just a woman either she wasn't she wasn't anyone's wife she was adam's wife amen she was the fulfillment of what he had been longing for and she could give him the fellowship that he desired i mean she could truly be been be joined in union you know the the world is full of men and women today but only only one of those women is my wife amen only one of those men is your husband amen there's only one that you can truly bond with and and understand and share even the most heartfelt or the most the the most intimate things amen are shared between the two of you that's what makes you husband and wife oh i want to say there's a lot of churches across the world today but there's one bride amen even within those churches there's a mixed multitude of people but there's also individuals who make up that bride and they've been joined to jesus christ through spiritual union and through the baptism of the holy ghost and they're becoming the very expression of his life upon the earth amen i i didn't i didn't give my my title this morning but i i want to title this uh this thought or this message the power of prophecy the power of prophecy or of the spoken word and so adam when he when he made that declaration when he spoke those words even god god had made adam as a spoken word creation adam was a product of the spoken word and so now eve is being identified as she is being given her identity by the spoken word of adam oh my amen the the serpent had a voice and the serpent could communicate but he could not say you're born in my bone and flesh of my flesh amen he could pervert the womb amen he could introduce his life into the womb of eve amen but he could not redeem her amen only one could pull her back to him amen in redemption and be joined to her amen and that was her husband adam oh my friend amen if you if you just think about it it's glorious when you see christ and the bride being typed out here amen so the word of the word of god amen i believe adam speaking was the very thoughts of god speaking when adam amen exercised dominion of the earth what he was actually doing was taking what was in god's mind and he was expressing it on the behalf of god on the earth adam had the same creative power as god amen but he would never exercise anything upon the earth but what god's desires were amen and that is true also in the life of every born-again believer every son and daughter of god your life becomes the expression of god's desires amen when you're fully surrendered and you come to full maturity and full adoption amen your life here on the earth is the expression of god's desires so in so much that even the spoken word can speak through you amen and you can speak the desires of god and you can impart salvation and healing amen by becoming the mind of christ expressing itself through you amen we believe this morning amen you are the only jesus this world will ever see i mean you are actually the family of god in expression here upon the earth faith in god's word makes that word live in you oh my doubt is a very powerful tool of the enemy i believe sometimes we underestimate the power of doubt but faith is even more powerful faith in the word of god amen can make the word of god actually live and express itself through your being amen when something comes in to afflict your body a sickness or a disease or an infirmity of some sort amen faith in the word of god will dismiss that perversion from your body dismiss that sickness dismiss that disease amen by faith in the word of god amen because no doubt we we experience we encounter sickness and disease many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivereth them out of them all amen so faith in the word of god is what makes it what's what gives the word expression in you you know i i for some reason this just comes to my mind just at this moment jesus was invited to a feast hosted by a man by the name of simeon one time he walked into that house he was he was not greeted at the door he was not given a robe he was not kissed by the host he was not anointed with oil his feet were not washed he was he slipped in unrecognized unnoticed and unwelcomed to the feast but there was a woman walking by on the outside amen who saw the lord jesus in that in that place in that home amen and saw amen an opportunity to go and worship him and she ran she got her her alabaster box she returned and somehow she made her way into the place and she knelt at the feet of jesus and began worshiping him now when she began to worship him it began to release something from him to her and then it began to release forgiveness it began to release healing amen she was pouring out her heart in worship and jesus amen it opened up the very fountain of god the very heart of god was open amen to that one woman oh my friend you know a self-righteous spirit won't do that a simeon a man simeon never received that amen but she received it amen because there was something in her that had the ability to believe he was the messiah amen she couldn't get that from the priest she couldn't get that from the religious leaders she couldn't get that from the religious orders of that day but she got it from the person of jesus christ by faith in who he was oh my it released the power amen to transform her from who she was amen unto a daughter of god isn't that glorious this morning so the right approach oh my let me say this this morning the right approach to the revealed word of the hour will release the power of the word to transform your life and others will look at that same word and see a scandal they'll see a falsehood they'll see a man or they'll see the mistakes of man or they'll even call it a deception but to the believer it's life it's healing it's forgiveness it's rapture amen it's all the potentials of the word released why because faith in your heart is what unleashes the potentials of the word to become a reality in your life amen so faith in god's word makes that word living to you just like mary it took an angel's visitation but that well really if you think about it all that angel was doing was making the word personal to mary was making prophecy personal to mary was connecting her as an individual to a promise of god's word saying mary now is the time and you are the individual you are the person this is this was prophesied hundreds possibly thousands of years ago amen but it's for your time and it's not only for this this era or for this time but it's for you as a person mary and when the angel connected mary to the prophecy even faith in her heart said be it unto me according to your word behold the handmaid of the lord immediately amen life was conceived within a room and she bore the life of jesus christ she bore the very manifestation of god's own life amen in a human body here upon the earth as a child amen now i want to say this too just moving into the thought a little bit god uses the agency of a prophetic ministry to visit the earth at the appointed time of the fulfillment of the promise to an appointed people to receive the manifestation of the promise to raise the faith to raise their faith that they are god's chosen and that god's word is speaking of them and since the time of moses god has used the agency of prophetic ministry to achieve this amen uh god spoke to abraham and said thy seed shall sojourn in a strange land for four hundred years and afterwards i'll deliver them out with the mighty hand that was prophecy but in order for that prophecy to be fulfilled amen even though the people were there now in egypt's bondage and had been there for 400 years it was going to take a prophetic ministry to come on the seat amen to awaken them that they were the people it wasn't another generation amen it wasn't something off in the future and that the promise that god had made to abraham was now ready to be realized in their lives did moses ever make a believer out of pharaoh did moses ever convert one egyptian to his message none that i know of but to the seed of abraham to the children of the promise there was something about his life oh my something about his message that resonated it captured their hearts so when they heard that man with the criminal record he had already killed an egyptian it was it was indisputable the man was a murderer but he was also an instrument in the hand of god amen to uh to be a catalyst for the promise of god amen for a people of god to be fulfilled at that time and so even though it brought more pressures it brought more hardship it brought more uh toil and struggle on them yet it was preparing them for exodus it was preparing them to be expelled even from egypt amen and preparing them to believe god to take them back to their land of promise or back to their their true heritage amen that god had given to their father abraham their place of dwelling amen so moses ministry amen was there to awaken people can you just imagine we've hardly been a nation i guess for 400 years and here are people that dwelled in egypt under its bondage for 400 years it had become slavery had become a way of life for them being servants be being the lowest of society had become a way of life for the the israelites there in egypt's bondage but it took the ministry of a prophet amen to help to to to awaken their realization you're not slaves you you you're in your true origin amen where you really came from you're not slaves i mean you have you have a possession you have uh you have land you have an established place in the earth you you have wells you have vineyards you have gardens you have dwelling places you you have homes amen oh my you you will be a feared nation of other nations of the earth amen so they had their faith had had to be lifted to this place amen to to enable them to journey out of egypt and and follow the pillar of fire back across the jordan amen into the canaan land so god used this prophetic ministry of moses amen to reveal his promise oh my and and it for that to become a reality now think about this for a moment it was it was actually more of a reality for joshua and for caleb than it even was for moses because moses would never dwell in canaan moses would never live to see canaan and occupy and establish but his message oh my his message quickened a joshua and a caleb and a generation of overcomers to believe his message amen and to walk even into a greater realization of what that promise meant than for the messenger himself to experience oh my so see it's not so much about the ministry or the the the vessel that god uses god wants to get your attention on his word god wants to lock your faith into his word god wants you to hear his voice god wants you to realize it's him performing the work amen in faith in god's word amen will bring you into the complete fulfillment of the promise amen and you you look at this this is something that's remarkable to me as israel made their journey there then we see they were they were feared people and and balak and the moabites became fearful that they would be swallowed up by israel and and balak hired balaam to curse israel they thought as a as a hireling prophet they could somehow convince him to pronounce a curse upon god's people but every time balaam went to curse when god spoke he blessed amen oh my if they can only realize god is the source of their success amen and you cannot defeat that but so you you watch this and you if you see what was happening there with balak and balaam you will see exactly what is happening in the day we're living balak thought he could manipulate that gift and so he took balaam you know when balaam first gave his prophecy of blessing over israel then balak said well well well come over here and let me show you these same people from this perspective let me show you another angle of them and this happened two or three more times where each time he thought if he showed balaam a different viewpoint or a different perspective if he could see their theirs their faults or their blemishes or their shortcomings or any of those things the natural side of things that somehow that would alter the prophecy but but what he didn't realize was balaam wasn't giving his opinion balaam was only speaking the mind of god as god saw these people and they although they were as full of faults as the moabites were they were no more perfect the people there were no better of people as far as uh of their constitution as as as men and women there was no difference but they were under god's provided plan they were under a bleeding lamb amen they were under a token message and they were following amen a ministry that was leading them to god's plan and god's purpose for their lives and so every time he spoke he spoke blessing and so finally in his last parable he looks upon the children of israel and he's and he says this i shall see him but not now i shall behold him but not nigh there shall come a star out of jacob and the scepter shall rise out of israel and shall smite the corners of moab and destroy all the children of sheth he actually looked upon the people of god and prophesied christ he prophesied jesus christ the coming of the lord jesus christ he could look upon broken pieces israel and prophesy a masterpiece oh my how wonderful the lord is amen we we look at our broken lives this morning we look at our broken families we look at our broken past amen and we see failure but if you can see yourself through the word of god you can see yourself through the eyes of god and through the bleeding atonement amen god sees perfection amen god sees the end result god sees what he's bringing you to and here balaam looks at a people a man full of faults full of mistakes and full of failures and prophesies the lord jesus christ amen the power of prophecy brother brennan makes a statement this is in the revelation of jesus christ he says the book of revelation has more symbols in it than all the rest of the books in the bible it has more symbols because it is a book of prophecy it's a prophetic book therefore it has to be understood by a prophetic class this book is not meant for everybody there's nobody can understand it hardly this book is made for a certain class of people on over in deuteronomy it says the hidden things belong to the lord that is right and he reveals to us his children the hidden things the carnal mind cannot comprehend them great things of the scripture because it's foolish to them but to the ones who are lovers of the word of god that's who the book was written to the church amen so if you are part of of of the you know just as i was saying uh adam was a spoken word product of the almighty god and eve was made of the same material he was mrs adam was made of the same material he was so he being a spoken word creation amen he speaks the word over her speaks the word to her this is now bone in my bones flesh of my flesh amen so because of of the substance amen that you are constructed of is what gives you a special ear amen it gives you a a you you're very keen may i say it this morning you've got a receiver that is built inside of you amen to to uh to resonate amen to the the the bible to the scriptures to the word of god and to the voice of god there's something about it that captures your attention amen it's a prophetic book and it is written to a prophetic class of people i like i like to look at the illustration of how when jesus told his disciples now they had cast out devils they had healed the sick they had exercised amen the the supernatural power of jesus christ they were an extension of his own ministry but yet even after all that they had experienced and after all the the damage they had done he still tells them terry ye in jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high there was even a greater uh manifestation or a greater expression of his life that was waiting to be fulfilled amen at the outpouring of the holy spirit and so when peter and those 120 believers came out of the upper room now after being filled with the holy spirit the world looked on and those who watched said what means this what meaneth this and a man who could barely say anything right prior to this time you know he was always speaking up oh lord it's good for us to be here let's build three tabernacles and he said all uh uh jesus told him said uh i'm gonna go to i'm gonna go and the son of man must go and be crucified and we'll rise again on the third day and peter said not so lord and jesus said get thee behind me satan for thou savers not the things of god but the things of man peter there there was only two things that i know of that peter ever said right prior to receiving the holy ghost and that was this to whom shall we go lord for thou alone has the words of eternal life and thou art the christ the son of the living god that's the only two things that peter ever said right but when he came staggering out of the upper room filled with the life of god the spirit of god the world said what meaneth this peter said these men aren't drunk as you suppose seeing it's but the third hour of the day now i like to say this peter didn't deny that they were drunk he just said they're not drunk the way you think they are they were definitely intoxicated but it was the stimulation of revelation amen it was not a natural stimulation from a natural substance but it was a spiritual stimulation from a spiritual source and peter said these men are not drunk as you suppose seeing it's about the third hour of the day but he said this is that that was spoken by the prophet joel now the holy spirit has filled peter and 119 other believers and it has given them the unique ability to identify to see their identification in prophecy in the word of god amen what might have once made peter ashamed to be acting and conducting himself that way might have once made peter apologize well i don't know why we're acting this way i'm sorry we'll we'll try to straighten up we'll try to go somewhere in it and pray through or get you know read church order or something like that but no peter wasn't apologizing now he wasn't ashamed now only days before he was ashamed to be to even be identified as a disciple of jesus christ but here he is now boldly proclaiming this is that amen the the baptism of the holy spirit amen was now empowering them with the ability to see themselves positionally placed within the word of god and to connect them to prophecy to make them unapologetic amen for what god was now performing in their lives oh my brother sister and to be filled with the holy spirit in the day and hour which we're living and be ashamed of god's prophet i don't think so to be ashamed of the message i don't think so amen to to put it all back in a man or a ministry and waiting for his return i don't think so the holy spirit amen joins you to your identification in the word of god and it says this is the present present-day expression of the word amen i forgive me if i'm saying like i'm throwing off on other beliefs or other movements but the holy spirit will direct you right to the center of the target brother madam said man is always putting god looking at what god has done or looking forward to what he will do and failing to recognize what he's doing right now but when peter was filled with the holy spirit amen he was able to identify what was happening right now amen i thank god for what he's doing right now in the bride of jesus christ amen uh sure there's some falling by the wayside sure there's an apostasy taking place but there's also a bride a man who's being wrapped in a secret chamber amen she's being in the time of trouble he shall set me upon a rock amen in a secret place there's a bride who's becoming enshrouded in her identification in the word of god amen she's becoming a mystic to the world and one day she's going to disappear amen why because of her identification in the word this is that that was spoken by the prophet joel oh my i'd like to i'd like to look at at your life this morning look at my life this morning this is that that was spoken amen by paul he'll have a church without blemish without spot without wrinkle glorious amen this is that this is that that was spoken i mean through through the through the church ages this is that that was spoken even by the seventh angel messenger oh my it's not just a prophecy it's not just something off in the future but now amen of fulfillment is living itself out through the very bride of jesus christ amen elisha could say this is that amen they they the sons of the prophets were looking for where where's your master going where's elijah but but elisha smote the waters of the jordan river amen with the mantle of elijah and said where is the god of elijah amen it wasn't so much a question as it was a statement because god was identifying the same god of elijah was now identifying himself as the god of elisha and he was performing the same works and the same signs and wonders and the same expression of the supernatural even in a two-fold manner a two-fold manager through elisha's ministry amen you believe that this morning prophet of god says all that spiritual union of christ and his church now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested and vindicated just what the bible said would happen in this day it's happening day by day amen now look at the word for just a moment the word redemption redemption means it means to restore back that which was lost or it could mean that which was forfeited something that was lost or forfeited is restored back and so then restoration means to bring something back to its original state or condition with all of its original qualities now i uh i'm 42 years old and so lo i like to see classic cars i i really didn't live in the time i didn't live in the era when the when the muscle cars and these classic cars were being built and driven but i still like to look at them to me that it's just um you know to see how that could be formed and and all the things those cars could do but but so just look taking the car for an example if you have a restored uh let's just say a 1970 mustang mach 1 or whatever model it would be if you have a restored car and it's been completely restored back to its original form it is not only restored in its appearance you don't just have you know the the body of the vehicle the paint the doors and the hinges and the wheels and the tires you don't just have the original appearance of the vehicle that's part of it but you also have the performance amen if that car has truly been restored it has the same horsepower that it had when it rolled off the showroom floor or roll off the assembly line it'll still do zero to 60 in the same amount of time and then it'll still it'll do everything that original car did because it has been completely restored and i want to say this morning we're living in the hour of restoration we're living in the hour when the original faith amen has been restored back to the church the original identity has been restored back to the church not only in appearances but in performance as well amen what the original church did amen the true church of the living god is still doing today hell hallelujah because she has the same power and that power is being exercised amen through the same body through the same members amen oh my friends and it can still meet the road amen the power is making it through the tires and it's pushing it down the road and the church is being propelled today by the power of god that is invincible everything satan has ever thrown against it has failed everything he's ever tried has been defeated amen he's used principalities he's used kingdoms he's used all the might of the political powers the economical powers the financial powers of this world but there's no power that can prevail against the people of god because they are the very word of god they're the very expression of his thoughts made manifest in the earth amen every time i i've been listening to the seals and every time the enemy rode out on on a horse white horse red horse black horse pale horse every time the enemy a man joined himself to a power to go forth to conquer the holy spirit amen release a special anointing for the people of that age not only to combat that enemy but to conquer that enemy amen the lion anointing the ox anointing the man anointing and then the flying eagle was the last anointing of see see oh my friend catch this the anointing is not only for the messenger or the messengers but the anointing is for the overcomer you are anointed with the same anointing as your messenger amen an eagle anointing is not just for the prophet but the bride herself is under an eagle anointing also a man which means she cannot remain an earthbound creature amen an eagle when he's earthbound he's actually a prey but when he's in the skies he becomes a predator amen he achieves a dominion over everything that's below him amen everything that's beneath him so the same anointing that anointed the prophet of god is still present today to anoint the people of god and to bring you into the complete fulfillment amen a lot could be said here i've i've i've noticed years ago i ministered on when god sends a prophetic ministry to a people of the earth the life of that prophet is not just there uh you know to do certain things and even peculiar things but the the the mannerisms the conduct and even the peculiarities of that prophet are saying something about the people when isaiah was it isaiah who i forget which prophet it was now laid on his side for so many days it showed a spiritual condition of the nation of the people of god one i believe was jeremiah married a harlot or prostitute showing that the church had gone into a prostitution or spiritual idolatry see those prophets lives said something about the people they were sent to oh my i'm thinking about a prophet of god that was sin in this hour and his life and and his experiences weren't for us just to look and admire what god did in him but it says something about the people amen if he was taken beyond the curtain of time it says something about the people amen it says something about what you and i are going to experience amen as the followers of that message and of that ministry amen so restoration and redemption restoration brings us back to the original state or the original condition with all of the original qualities you say brother tim is the is the same power that was released on pentecost sufficient to overcome today it's more than a match for the devil amen there it was falling on a church in its infancy now that same power is falling upon a church amen who's been built up in the oracles of god who's had the the seals revealed the mysteries of god unfolded oh my friends look where we are today as a body of believers amen and that same power is present amen to anoint us to be overcomers in this hour amen we should we should take courage this morning our faith should be lifted amen oh my and so here as a type of the bride john brother man and one place i believe it is brother brethren says john was a type of the overcomer in every age and he was especially a type of the bride of jesus christ he was that beloved disciple that leaned on the lord's bosom he was right there with christ at even at calvary when others had forsaken him and fled and so he was the only disciple that did not die death as a martyr prematurely but he lived to be uh he lived to be up in years and he even took the word of god and put it putting it into book form amen and so john was taken to the aisle that is called patnas for the testimony of jesus christ and so he was there and we we we watched john as he has taken up his call up he said he heard a voice behind him speaking to him and john turned to see the voice and he said i'm the alpha and omega and write the things that thou seest in a book and send it to the churches that are in asia and so he brings him through those seven church ages and christ in every age is revealing himself in the midst of that church amen seven golden candle sticks seven lamb stands there's christ right in the center of it he's revealing himself amen when balaam looked at israel he prophesied christ when john looked at the church ages he saw christ standing in the midst of them amen when the king looked into the fiery furnace he didn't just see three hebrews he saw the fourth man the like unto the son of man standing there with him amen so even in laodicea amen christ is still dwelling with his church and in his church amen his his eternal presence with his body he's being identified with his bride amen we should be thankful for that this morning oh my i'm rejoicing night and day as i walk the narrow way for the hand of god in all my life i see the reason of my bliss yes the secret all is this for the comforter abides with me amen jesus told his disciples he said i must go away he said it's expedient for you that i go away it's to your benefit how could jesus as a mortal man that could be seen that could be heard that could be touched and declared by the natural senses how could him leaving them in that form be to their benefit but he said it's exceeded for you then i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come but if i go away i will send the comforter and he will be with you even in you even to the end of the world amen we have think about this this morning we have something that is greater than the physical presence of jesus christ we have his indwelling abiding presence and his life and his spirit to point us to the revealed word for our day and to make that word to make the power of that prophecy live in us and make it a reality to us now here is john he's been taken to patmos he's seen the church ages unfolded and christ's presence in the midst of every age and the people of that age the predestinated of that age and then a voice speaks to john and says john come up higher i've got something else to reveal to you and john has taken in a type of the rapture and he's called up and there he sees in revelations chapter 5 he sees one seated on the throne and he hears a voice crying who is worthy to come and take the book and open it to loose the seals thereof and to reveal it i'm paraphrasing it and john said no man in heaven no man in earth was found worthy to take the book and to loose the seals thereof and i wept much because no man was worthy so john is here in this in this broken weeping despondent a despair this condition amen he said i wept much why because he realized the uh the implications of what this meant if this book were to remain sealed and no one was worthy to open it or to loose the seals thereof now if you look here and i didn't appreciate the brothers bringing it up so quickly there but look here no man in verse 4 no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on now in my way of looking at this or my way of seeing this if i understand this verse of scripture correctly it requires the same level of worthiness to look on the book as it does to open the book and to read the book because it says no man was found worthy to open the book neither to look thereon so to me those require both the same level of worthiness now this leads to something in this condition john began weeping and now john wasn't commissioned to weep john was commissioned to watch john was commissioned to keep his eyes on the unfolding or the development of this vision because he was supposed to write this and send it back to the church so in his weeping condition he was missing the next phase and then an elder an elder catches his attention and says weep not john behold the lion of the tribe of judah hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and so john looked and and then when the lamb came he stepped forth he took the book out of the right hand then we see the the uh the um the four and four beasts four and twenty elders they fell down they poured out their vials of odors the prayers of the saints and they sing a new song if you'll notice before they only say thou art worthy thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they were created but now they sing thou hast redeemed us unto our god oh my you have restored us to our original identity you have replaced us you have taken us back to our place of origin to redeem you could never be redeemed back if you hadn't fallen from that place originally or in the first place oh my but when the book is open when the seals are revealed amen when when the lamb takes that book their worship changes thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and hast redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation it just took down every barrier it doesn't matter what race what culture what creed what religion what denomination doesn't matter your skin color doesn't matter if you were slave or free bond whatever amen the blood takes care of all of that redemption takes care of all of that brings us all back into one great family of god amen and has made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth when the lamb took that book and loose the seals thereof he revealed the names of that book and made john to realize his name was in the book also for john to be able to look upon that book and to see his name there meant that the lamb had imparted his same righteousness and his same worthiness to john amen showing listen the bible says jesus thought it not robbery to be equal with god he realized he was a son of god he was the manifested life of god he was a spoken word product of god and every son and daughter of god comes to this same realization amen by the lamb he took your sins amen placed them beneath the bleach of his blood and restored you back to your original state your original quality oh my your original position as sons and daughters of god you talk about something to make you worship you talk about something that make you just bubble over with praise amen oh my the one who did this for my behalf and has redeemed us back to this great estate that was fallen from think about it friend amen the same and has imparted his own worthiness his own righteousness his own holiness has imparted that to his people whose names were written on that book before the before the foundation of the world written there in the lamb's book of life and he's come to reveal that to call those names from that book amen and when john you know here's the thing now think about this john was a disciple of jesus christ knew him as a man walked with him on the earth saw the supernatural saw the miracles performed and was there as i said he was there at calvary he was standing at the foot of the cross when he was crucified and he was a witness of the resurrection but only after this experience on patmos does john begin to fully understand what all of that meant for him as an individual think about that is revelation important oh my friend we can't uh we underestimate the power of revelation amen but it's the power of revelation that gives us victory it's the power of revelation that enables us to prevail over every attack of satan what's what is what is really the attack of satan to give you a lesser identity that is really all the devil is working to achieve is to reduce in your sight and in your vision in your in your self-perception he wants to pervert the way you realize who you are because if he can lower you then he can alter and pervert your life and and hinder you from coming to the full potential that god has called you to be but god just as hard as satan is working to try to undermine or try to reduce your identity god is working even more so to restore your identity to reveal your identity to you and to make you to know that angel stayed right there with mary until she finally accepted it and said be it unto me because the bible says she cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be amen but the angel stayed right there with her until it locked in her heart and she said be it unto me according to thy word behold the handmaid of the lord then the angel realized it's a sealed deal now amen it's already done nothing can stop the life from coming forth and so friends i'm going to tell you something this morning only the revealed word of the hour can give you your identification there's no other creature amen there's no other species there's no other form of life in all the earth amen that can tell you who you are and where you came from but the word can and the word will and the word has been sent to reveal to you and i who we are as sons and daughters of god and when that revelation strikes our heart and it really anchors in there we are amen there will be nothing the devil can do with you amen it will make you invincible so the experience of seeing his name in the book that's what identified to john what all of those other experiences in his life the true meaning the true essence of them why he why christ lived and died and was raised and ascended why pentecost took place if john's name hadn't been on the book pentecost amen he would have been a bystander oh my he would have been an onlooker but i want to tell you when your name is on the book you won't be a spectator you'll be a participant and that holy spirit will be expressing itself through your life as well amen how many would say this morning lord i don't want to be a spectator amen i want to be a participant i want the life of the word i want the life of the message expressing itself through me be it unto me lord be it unto me according to thy word lord i know i'm a failure i know i have shortcomings i know i have faults but i'm looking to your word i'm depending on your word my confidence lord is not in the clay but it's in the potter it's in the maker it's in the creator it's in the one who ordained me to be who i am amen what was it that caused you to be attracted to the message you ever thought about that why did it attract your interest why did it draw you from whatever denomination whatever belief you know if you knew my testimony some of the churches i've come through in movements and doctrines my i i was never in in a a recognized denomination but there's a lot of denominational spirits even within the ranks of the message that have gone off of uh you know off out into fanaticism and and defaults doctrine and all of these things and perverted the lives of of hundreds or thousands of people but yet the message somehow amen held me and the message drew me the truth of the word of god pulled me amen even through those things amen it kept me and here i am today amen because of the truth because of the message someone um lord help me not to say something wrong here but i i saw some time ago an interview and they'd asked a person said what do you think about the people leaving the ministry of brother bradham and the message and and he said well you know they've been perhaps they've been hurt they've been wounded and and and they've been exposed to fanaticism and a lack of balance and all these things and maybe that's contributed to it but you know i looked in my own life i thought i've come through all sorts of things but i knew that wasn't the message i knew that wasn't the message i knew that wasn't what brother bradham taught i knew that wasn't balanced and so i never conflated the two i never i never accused brother branham of polygamy doctrine and all these other things amen i knew the message didn't teach that but you see amen if if it's not if there's not some predestinated representation that on the inside of you something will come to make you offended something will come to make the truth and jesus christ and reveal in the form of the word making an offense to you you say brother tim i not me brother i'm exempt from that let me tell you something john the baptist got his eagle eyes filmed over and was down there in prison saying art thou the cry art thou he or should we look for another he almost in a sense almost denied the advent of the very purpose of his own ministry to introduce that ministry and here he is questioning that oh my but when he questioned jesus christ reaffirmed amen he might have he might have lost his realization of who christ was but jesus didn't lose his recollection of who john was because john was one of his amen he said you go tell that fox amen go tell them the the the dead are raised the blinded eyes are open and the gosp the poor have the gospel preached to them amen so don't don't think you're beyond uh temptation or you're immune from the devil's attack but the the truth will hold you i believe that this morning amen and and the power of of the power of god's love will restore you amen but we're living we know we're living in a in a great shaking hour but i thank god that to me the message means more to me now than it's ever meant to be the prophecies are more pertinent and more relevant now than they were when they were spoken perhaps amen and not only do i see that but i see what it is doing in my life and in the lives of the believers and i know god sent an eliezer to select the bride and lead her to isaac amen and that personal experience in my life is what makes me know he's a true servant of christ amen so what caused you to be attracted to the message like mrs adam who was made of the same material he was you are mrs jesus christ and you are drawn by the power of the spoken word just as adam's voice in genesis confirmed to her that she had reached the place where she originated from god has spoken to the bride again in this hour amen oh my you you look at the the you say brother tim are you winding up i am winding up i'm i'm wrapping up just hold on just a moment but in god's threefold purpose the brother brethren describes and christ is the mystery of god reveal to reveal himself in christ to gain preeminences in his church and to restore back to eden and then he comes and he preaches in the message it is the rising of the son and in that message he says and i'm just jumping right into the middle of the paragraph and he says because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him the prophet of god is identifying the bride amen as having the same qualities the same characteristics the same life the same nature and as the very same product as the groom was jesus christ oh my friends to me this is essentially the same thing that was taking place when adam said this is now flesh of my flesh and bone in my bone amen your searching is over your journeying is over there's no more wandering through the garden you have arrived amen no more no more hidden truth no more shadows no more darkness no more partial realization you have arrived at the full realization of who you are and the holy spirit is speaking to identify you oh my you know friends it's not what we say of ourselves it's what the holy spirit says even jesus took his disciples on the mount of transfiguration and a voice spoke from heaven this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye him amen notice the harmony of the father and the son jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father john 5 19 this harmony is now to exist between the groom and the bride he shows her his word of life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in mary the bride has the mind of christ for she knows what he wants done with the word you know something now this is not a good a real good analogy because i can try to express myself my thoughts in words and i sometimes can't find the words to express what's in my mind now that's not so with god but even his word is misunderstood by those who don't have his mind so for the prophet to have said she has the word of god would have been one thing but he didn't say she has the word of god he says she the bride has the mind of christ for she knows what he wants done with the word to have the word of god without the mind of god you can still go astray you can still misapply it you can still misinterpret it but with the mind of god present to reveal to you how amen to handle and what he wants done with his word oh my friends it brings us into the same qualities the same power the same life of god himself god has no greater amen no greater method or means of expressing himself than the spoken word the spoken word is what brought order to the creation is what brought life forth the spoken word is what brought lazarus from the tomb amen oh my the spoken word is is is the very expression of eternal life itself and the bride has that amen she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the lord you actually become the voice of the word because you're giving expression to the life of the word in action oh my she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted in water it comes to full harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the lord or they keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time you believe that this morning you know my prayer is lord send the holy spirit to fill my heart and to fill my life the same way you did peter and the same way you did those 120 in the upper room so that i can go forth from this service from this place and that word can so live itself through me that i can identify the actions of my life and the conduct of my life as being the fulfillment of this word and there will be nothing you will have to back away from there will be no no challenge there will be no tests there will be no obstacle there will be no hurdle that you face that the word cannot overcome and it will prevail through its power in our lives amen i believe this morning we are the chosen people and we are living in the appointed time we have a prophetic message amen and i believe the rapture amen is already working in our very mortal beings amen our lives are being transformed by the power of this word and it's going to take us from this earth we have no need to fear we have no need to worry rest in your identity as sons and daughters of god you love the lord this morning amen would you like to stand and musicians come back and i tell you time really flies when you are preparing or studying and you think my lord how's this all going to come out and all of these things but i so appreciate the reception this morning the pull on the word of god i certainly would never come to share any of my own thoughts or ideas or uh introduce a doctrine or something like that but i want to point your eyes amen toward i want to point your attention to jesus christ the revealed word of the hour and i'm praying lord make this word a greater reality in my heart and my life amen and perform it through me amen they were singing the little song earlier created me a clean heart oh god i wonder if we could just sing that in worship this morning we'll turn the service back over to brother erima amen how many would just say like mary this morning lord be it unto me according to thy word create lord in me perfect lord in me mold in me shape in me all that you would have me to be amen [Music] within me creating me a clean heart god and renew a right spirit within me oh and cast me not away from thy presence [Music] take not thine holy spirit from me you believe for restoration restore unto me the joy of thy salvation let's sing that verse again as a prayer [Music] and renew a right spirit within me o created me a new [Music] and renew a right spirit within me o cast me not away from thy presence alone oh take not thy holy spirit from me [Applause] [Music] the joy of thyself [Music] and renew a right spirit within me as they continue to play that softly how many times has has your spirit changed hasn't gotten a little hard come it'll rough a little bit but quickly as you can just say restore lord a right spirit within me change my attitude change let me go back to see what your word says because we we get sidetracked we get we get pulled this way sometimes we make a mistake we fail and we get down on ourselves you know and to think about that that i i never looked at it that way that he was was set aside from adam taken down over here on the side maybe the lord brought her back through the whole garden and she saw the animals and she saw the birds and she saw the beauty of it and it had to be something to her to see it actually is to actually see wow look at that the amazing of it all and she's going but god had a purpose where he was taking her and where he was going to take her to adam probably didn't really realize what happened yet but maybe adam said something's missing but there was going to come that that that meeting place that place were gone and he would look upon her and she would look about him and realize they were one they were part of each other now your life has gone through a journey for some of you your journey has been much longer than others some have just started and god has allowed you to go through that journey to come to the place the difference was he knows and he's waiting there for you he knows who you are he's just waiting for you to come to that realization hey that's me when that little boy looked in the mirror and said hey that's me that's part of who i am to think when you're restoring something you have to start with the original product i've said it this way and you could tell i'm just a little bit older than brother tim here because he went to a 1974 then i go to a 1957 chevy so just a little bit of difference in age there but if i'm going to restore a 1957 chevy i can't start with a 1957 ford i've got to start with the original product god didn't take you from something you weren't to something you are he's brought you from where you were for you to realize who you are and coming to the fulfillment of that and that should give you hope that should encourage your heart and say yes that's me that's the response that's what i have and i appreciate to hear the word of god again today to tell me that's who i am amen i received a text and i should have shared it of a testimony because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever about a month ago my sister-in-law elizabeth prayed about the vertigo and the ringing in the ears about a month ago and since then she has not had it we prayed he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen whatever it is whatever it is and to look upon the life of peter and some of us can identify ourselves with peter real easy man i failed there boy i was wrong boy i spoke out of turn boy i tried to stop what god was doing because i thought i had it right we've all been there but remember he said after that resurrection morning he says tell my disciples that all meet them over here and peter too that's right some of you were looking i never thought i would hear that but hey i'm so glad i'm a part of the family of god amen you appreciate the word of god today amen praise god for that so we'll gather again together this afternoon at five o'clock and come expecting come believing shame lord speak to me one more time amen could we just continue singing that as a request to the lord now remember you're not asking him something he doesn't know he's just saying now you're understanding what i want to do with you oh created me oh god [Music] and renew a right spirit within me [Music] oh and renew a right spirit within me maybe raise your hands ask him or restore [Music] oh take note [Music] [Applause] [Music] me the joy of thy salvation and renew the right spirit within amen god bless you let's let's just pray lord we thank you for your word it it to us sometimes we look at ourselves as mere mortals as as just we we forget who we are lord like that young man that had gone off to war and he had gotten some amnesia and he couldn't couldn't really remember he couldn't recall who he was he still was who he was it's just in his thought and his process his mother and father never disowned him he was never cast out of the family his name never changed it's just he lost the sight of who he was and today you've come by to remind us lord who we are where we stand maybe maybe our vision has dim like like john did john kind of forgot who he was that messenger behold the lamb that taketh away the sins of the world and then here's he's asking are you the one or should we wait for another lord thank you for reminding us bringing us back to where we were been walked us by where we were raised walked us by where life came from us to remind us who we were today lord we thank you for that we want to appreciate and we love you for it lord we bless your name now lord go with your people as they as they go home the lord and let us gather again together this afternoon with expectation and believing lord that you'll never leave us as you said lord in jesus christ's name amen amen as you go sweep over my soul sweep over my soul sweep over my soul sweep over
