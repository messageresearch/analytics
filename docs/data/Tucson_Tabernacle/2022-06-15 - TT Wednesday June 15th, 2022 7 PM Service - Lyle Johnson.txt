into your hands and again we thank you for your love your mercy your grace and your kindness in jesus precious name amen okay we're gonna if you remain standing while we read from our bibles three brief texts they're from paul's epistles the first two are from ii timothy this is thought to be the very last epistle from paul during his execution paul wanted to share these final thoughts with his fellow minister a young man with great promise a person whom paul loved deeply he loved him enough that he directed his final written words to him and we have them today second timothy 3 starting at verse 15 is very familiar to all of us paul says and that from a child timothy you've known the holy scriptures he's referring to the tanakh what we call the old testament the earlier covenant between god and israel the holy writings which are able to make thee wise not just knowledge but wisdom how to apply that knowledge unto salvation through memorization and drilling continually no through bible-based faith which is and must be in christ jesus all scripture every word of that tanakh is given by inspiration of god other translations read is god breathed and is profitable that means you receive more than you invest this is not a losing proposition the more you invest the more profit you derive is profitable for doctrine knowledge of god his ways his nature for reproof conviction evidence for correction the word there literally means straightening up again for instruction education teaching and righteousness right relationship to god why to what end to serve what purpose that the man of god the believer may be perfect whole complete mature thoroughly furnished completely equipped unto all knowledge to debate and argue no no the purpose is good works now paul wrote this not james a bit earlier in this letter paul gives timothy instruction about the holy scriptures that timothy has known since childhood second timothy 2 beginning at verse 14 another familiar passage of these things now paul has just written about patience suffering endurance drawing on comparisons to being a soldier or a farmer dying to oneself he says of these things put them who is talking about faithful men to carry to others in later times in various places put them in remembrance tell them more than once remind them charging testifying witnessing to them before the lord this is serious timothy before the lord that they strive or dispute or argue not about words to no prophet such things lead to the subverting overthrowing overturning of the hearers that's a very strong admonition he says study timothy immerse yourself in the scriptures to show to display to stand to prove thyself approved properly acceptable unto others so they can admire you no study to show yourselves approved unto god this is how you meet god's approval timothy study learn until you become a workman now's not the time to rest get up and get busy that needeth not to be ashamed embarrassed rightly dividing it means to make a straight cut or to dissect the word of truth finally we'll read from second corinthians 3 to shed some light on what paul might have meant when he said to study or rightly divide or be a minister ii corinthians 3 verses 5 and 6. paul says not that we are sufficient we're not competent or qualified of ourselves to think anything is of ourselves but our competence our qualifications our sufficiency is of god who also who god also hath made us able ministers of the new testament this new covenant this new contract not of the letter in other words we use words but we're not ministering words but of the spirit we're using words to minister the spirit why because the letter kills but the spirit gives life and that's what we're supposed to be ministering is life satan knows the letter knows it well but lacks the life please be seated this evening probably is no surprise we'll do something a little different i want to start with a brief story from the babylonian talmud now the talmud is a collection of writings from those that judaism called sages after the tanakh was compiled we call the old testament no person in judaism was ever again called a prophet those held in high regard whose wisdom was well respected were called sages the babylonian talmud was begun during the exile after the destruction of jerusalem was compiled over a period of several centuries there was a sage whose name was hillel he was highly respected within judaism but you might call a sage's sage he was born in babylon in the first century bc we're told he was from a very poor family but was a brilliant student he made his way to jerusalem to study eventually hillel became the president of the sanhedrin josephus tells us that hillel died in 10 a.d at the approximate age of 120 100 1920 somewhere in there well at that time jesus would have been a teenager he may have still been the head of that council when shortly after his birth jesus was brought to the temple by joseph and mary for her right of purification we're all familiar with the story in luke's gospel of anna and simeon seeing the infant jesus there hello was an old man when jesus was born but he was a contemporary he may have even been one of those that marveled at jesus wisdom when he stayed behind at the temple after the passover feast and mary and joseph went looking for him if josephus is correct and the dates claimed for the life of hillel then he certainly would have been in jerusalem at that time around 6 or 7 a.d although a very very old man even older than me both of these events are related in luke chapter 2. hillel had a grandson his name was gamalia and he's the very same gamalia that intervened at the council and advised the sanhedrin to not be hasty in judging peter and the apostles we read about this in acts 5 34-40 and he's almost certainly the same gamalia under whom paul studied torah related in acts 22 3. hello we're told was a gentle and humble person interpreted jewish law in a somewhat tolerant some say lenient fashion a colleague of his on the council named shamai followed a very strict interpretation of the law shamai and hillel were often in disagreement the story i want to share is found in the babylonian talmud it's a section called shabbat 31a in case you want to look it up it says there was another incident involving the gentile who came before shammai and said to shamai convert me to judaism on condition that you teach me the entire torah while i stand on one foot shamai pushed him away with his builder's cubit a common measuring thing his his trade was that of a builder so what happens is the same gentile came before hillel he again said convert me on condition that you teach me the entire torah while i stand on one foot hillel converted him he said to him that which is hateful to you do not do to another that is the entire torah the rest is its interpretation now go study as we'll see in a moment jesus said the same thing the scripture on which hillel based this interpretation is leviticus 19 18. thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself i am the lord well let's read how jesus said it this is part of the sermon on the mount matthew 7 12 jesus said therefore all things whatsoever you would that men should do to you even so to them this is the law and the prophets it's of course what we often call the golden rule notice that both hillel and jesus interpreted the admonition in leviticus of loving one's neighbor as being active not passive hillel said to never subject others to what you yourself hate then he said the rest of the torah the pentateuch the five books of moses is commentary on this all of it from genesis 1 1 through deuteronomy 34 12. jesus said to treat men as you desire them to treat you his use of the word men means humankind not just males of our species for both hillel and jesus this is a huge expansion of the word neighbor later jesus would tell the story the good samaritan to underscore this point when asked well who is my neighbor but here jesus said the law and the prophets he goes beyond the torah beyond the five books of moses to incorporate the entire old testament that it all had this foundation these are both prescriptions about what we do how we act toward others not just on what we think or claim our attitude to be not just our words but our actions our faith is expressed in our works our deeds our interactions with others not just the letter of the written word but the spirit the life veiled within it for the jews not just their fellow jews for us not just to other believers jesus references to love and all the new testament writers for that matter regardless of the distinctions between the greek words of agapo and filio all these references are active hands-on expressions not just feelings or emotions or attitudes later in the temple during his final week priority his crucifixion jesus expounded a bit on this commandment we read in mark 12 28 and one of the scribes came and having heard jesus and the pharisees reasoning together and perceiving that jesus had answered them well asked him which is the first the greatest the most important commandment of all and jesus answered the scribe he said the first of all the commandments the greatest the most important thing is hear o israel the lord our god is one lord this is generally known within judaism as the shema listen with intelligence and understanding pay close attention oh chosen of god the lord our god the lord is one we'll talk a little bit about the sheman in a moment and thou shalt love thou shalt have agapo affection for the lord thy god with all thy heart thoughts feelings with all thy soul life literally breath and with all thy mind understanding and with all thy strength forcefulness forcefulness might ability this is the first commandment this is the greatest this is the most important commandment this is from deuteronomy 6 4 and 5. it's not even part of the ten commandments and this this phrase all by mind was added by jesus it's not in deuteronomy he goes on he says the second is like it's similar it's the same it's a kin namely this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself there's none other commandment none other commandment greater than these and as we just read that in leviticus it's not part of the ten commandments either in matthew's account of this moment we read that jesus further stated on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets so we say the ten commandments are built on this foundation all the 613 commandments in the pentateuch have this at their heart all the prophecies about the coming messiah our savior are built on these all of them the entire bible jesus says is derived from these everything that's what he said right and if the message we hold so dear is based on the bible which it must be then the entire message brought by brother branham hangs on these two commandments as well and just as hillel told the gentile to then go study paul told timothy study to show thyself approved just as paul did going into arabia after his road to damascus experience his encounter with the lord we're told to read our bible and pray daily not just oh i've read this verse no read it go study brother daniel evans emphasized that to us this last sunday morning now about that shema is a hebrew word and it means here it means listen but it's a it's a it's a an emphatic form of it it isn't like well listen it's listen listen up pay attention the the complete jewish bible does a kind of a transliteration israel and in judaism whenever the the four letters that tetragrammatron the yhwh we sometimes say is yahweh or jehovah they never pronounce that if they're reading the scripture they never say it the only time that word is was ever pronounced was when the high priest on yom kippur went into the holy of holies and had the rope tied around his foot so that if the bell stopped jingling they'd pull them back out that was the only time that word was ever expressed so when they say the term adonai adonai means lord and it's derived from sovereignty so it's really saying sovereign lord sometimes in hebrew they'll say hashem which simply means the name but in our king james old testament it's always capital l capital o capital r capital d well in the mid 70s as i'm sure all of you know by now and may be tired of hearing it heather and i lived in israel i rode the bus from our apartment in netanya to downtown netanya then changed buses to take a bus to tel aviv and then got out of the bus and got into an ll worker bus to go to the airport so this trek started about 5 30 every morning six days a week the only day off was saturday shabbat at that time so we at church on saturday on the highway from netanya to tel aviv the bus driver always had the radio on and tuned to cole israel which means voice of israel it's the national radio network station at that time and every morning as that station came on the air they weren't on the air 24 hours a day i'd hear deuteronomy 6 4 the shma and the form of the song is [Music] [Music] god they repeat that several times and they had music and it sounded a lot better than i do but i would hear that every morning and so did everyone in israel that turned on their radio whether they were an arab whether they were a jew a christian or or none of the above that's how the day started in israel every day it's the core tenet of judaism and as we just read jesus proclaimed it is the most important thing one could know as he conversed with his scribe at the very end of his earthly ministry well bringing this to our day imagine a person comes to you seeking the lord wanting to know god or more about god having heard you will follow with a message he or she then says teach me the message of william branham while i stand on one foot the response most of us might give might be a bit like shamai i don't know but it would probably be such length that the seeker would soon tire and fall down walk away too complicated too much jargon don't understand the context so the challenge is simply this how to tell what we mean by the message while the listener is standing on one foot and that's the title of tonight's lesson on one foot and i want to thank kenneth for being such a good model for us well in algebra we'd be reducing an equation or an expression to its simplest terms oh this isn't algebra it's okay these are what brandon would call the abcs so let me illustrate this literally using art this is a very famous work of art some of you may recognize it most of us would probably scratch our heads and ask what it is and why is this so famous any guesses as to what this is a deathly hush descends no okay well let's step back until we can see the entire picture it's claude monet's bridge over a pond it was painted in 1899. monet was a french artist who started what is known as the impressionist school or impressionism you can see what the objects are but they're not realistic like a snapshot from a camera you're left with an impression of how the original scene looked that he was painting but he was trying to capture something of the essence the impression the actual scene left on him well here's a close-up of a portion of the painting it's enough detail to get a sense of the water lilies and grasses the shrubs the water the footbridge on a fine spring day to clearly see the brush strokes and yet still understand how they fit into the overall picture the big picture if you will without being all of the image or the painting now this particular canvas was painted in oils and scholars and critics of art have studied monet's methods and brush strokes pigments and bases other aspects of his technique there's a lot to learn a lot to discuss if this is your passion but as you look and get closer and closer to study the technique you can easily lose the picture of what is being presented in favor of examining how it's constructed well brother lyle why are you showing us a 123 year old painting by a french impressionist was he a christian is this a scene from the bible no no it's a scene from part of his garden that he planted in france it's not from the bible i can't tell if he was a christian or not because that's not really the point let's think about this for a moment monet had to apply each brushstroke each was done by him individually carefully deliberately with intent but each was to contribute to creation of the overall painting by itself each brush stroke is a glob of pigment and suspension in a liquid applied on a canvas none is very special the specific purpose of any particular one by itself is unclear now imagine monet is starting with a blank canvas he applies the very first brush stroke to that canvas if you were to observe her in his studio at that moment would you have any idea what he was doing what he was painting it's unlikely that you'd be able to visualize the finished work in your mind's eye after all almost anyone can dip a brush into some paint and slap it on some canvas but not many can create a master work of art by doing so yet this is how the masterwork is created one brushstroke at a time the artist's palette will contain various colors they'll be changed over time as the work progresses he'll thin some and not others the artist will typically use silver brushes some thin and narrow others more broad he or she might even use a sort of trowel to get a certain effect pressing and smearing the paint till it's just what he wants it to be many brush strokes will overlap others some may be several layers as the artist seeks to create exactly the image or impression he desires in the completed work the artist sees the completed work in his mind's eye even if the observer seeing only the first brushstroke or two cannot or even if looking too closely to work that's well along or completed just as you now see projected on the screen it takes time to paint that canvas paints must be applied in the correct sequence with sufficient time between strokes in the same area the colors will smear and run together otherwise spoil the final work as the painting progresses the artist may need to adjust something tweak modify so the completed work will be exactly what he saw in his mind's eye before he applied the first bit of paint to canvas or even to his palette and when completed the art must be viewed in the correct light anyone beholding the art must also view it from the proper perspective if you stood to the side of this painting or behind it you wouldn't see it and so it is with the bible and what what we refer to as the message god patiently over multiple millennia used various brushes moses david isaiah jeremiah multiple scribes recording israel's history peter paul luke and so forth and these brushes applied paints of varying color and texture and depth psalms prophecies promises requirements history fulfillments parables biographic vignettes some short like shamgar in the book of judges others quite lengthy like joseph and genesis or david and samuel and kings and chronicles all to create a unified hole a big picture one picture on a recent road trip heather and i listened to a series of lectures relating the history of the bible how the collection of scrolls and other writings came to be combined into the hebrew or jewish bible the tanakh and later the writings that comprise the new testament some of this history is speculation because there are no surviving records about how most of this came about and there are no surviving what we call autographed manuscripts original documents we don't have moses writings except copies of copies of copies of copies the earliest being among the dead sea scrolls of the oldest of these were written some thirteen hundred years after moses death similarly the most ancient new testament manuscripts are from two or three centuries after the originals were written most of the materials from the fourth century earlier writings are often just fragments of papyrus or parchment with as little as a verse or two or even just a fraction of a single verse many are from an early church father writing a letter to someone and quoting something from one of the earlier gospels or earlier writings and we all know when you trying to quote somebody that it's sometimes easy to not get it exactly right the earliest manuscripts do not completely agree with each other but there are variations sometimes in missing or added words sometimes spelling sometimes sections of writing mark 16 for example has two different endings in the oldest known manuscripts brother branham tells this story about a a mother her son just graduated from a seminary coming home from college and about conflicting original new testament manuscripts from believing god 1952. he says the doctor couldn't do nothing for her so the young man came up there the pastor and prayed for the elderly woman and laid his hands on her according to james or according to mark 16 they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover he come up and laid his hands upon the woman a few days she was up and going about her work as well when her son returned home from college why he was so happy you know he sees his mother so happy and said how you've been getting along mother said just fine said oh son i forgot to tell you something said why he was away these four years said i got sick and you know mrs over here belongs to that full gospel church said her pastor come up and laid hands on me according to mark 16 and i got well said the doctors couldn't do nothing for me when i had that sick spell said that's how i got well he said well mother i want to inform you something said of course away to college we learned this said the last nine verses of mark 16 isn't inspired said that was put there by the vatican said there's no history that says that that word in there was inspired and the little woman said praise god praise god he said what's the matter with you mother she said if god could heal me with words that isn't inspired what could he do with them that is inspired there you are if he could do that with uninspired words what would he do with that that is inspired we know that language evolves words and their meanings change over time cultural context changes we we often read the king james version and then need a translation from that jacobian prose to modern english and sometimes even then it's not clear because of the context not just the definition of the word but the cultural context of the word at the time that it was used in translating from a greek or hebrew or aramaic manuscript why are you sharing this brother lyle well let me explain we've seen especially over the last 60 years all sorts of so-called revelations crop up within the context of our faith and what we refer to as the message many of these are built on unconnected phrases or out of context expressions paul warns about this sort of thing in his letters to titus and timothy now some of you old-timers any old-timers here uh there's a there's a couple of you yeah i look in the mirror in the morning and wonder where did that guy come from heather who led him in the house but then i realized it's me well anyway we old timers remember before the advent of having sermon transcriptions available on personal computers or on handheld devices we'd be listening to a tape an actual physical seven inch real real tape maybe some of you may not have seen an antique like this these had the pre-service worship and so forth not the truncated digital recordings we have today so we could get the context the service that brother branham was speaking in well sometimes a person would hear that and they'd hear something striking they'd call it a nugget the image was of a person panning for gold and finding a small bit of gold in their pan sadly many times the person would leave the gold field to carry the analogy and be convinced they had found not just a nugget but the nugget and build a doctrine around it and gather a following and skew their future listening and reading to hear and see only those snippets that seem to reinforce their interpretation or revelation and misignore or explain away statements that it appeared to be in conflict with their view we saw many examples of this back in the late 60s i saw brothers restoring the large old aircraft they told me it was for brother branham to use might have been a douglas dc four or six or an early lockheed constellation i've forgotten why were they restoring this old airplane well they were going to fly brother branham around after he rose from the grave for what they called the return ministry two souls you could live any kind of life because the soul that sinned would die but the predestinated seed had a soul that would live forever so you could just do any old thing or thinking that we're presently in the millennium back in the mid 60s when my parents moved us to tucson to attend the tabernacle i remember being in the presence of some brothers that are mentioned many times in brother branham's ministry i was in awe of some of these guys one of them had a sign on the wall said eagles don't flock you have to find them one at a time this of course explained why they refused to attend church some of these distortions became quite elaborate seven thunder's seventh seal splitting the laodicean church agent to two ages the pentecostal age and the bright age therefore needing an eighth day messenger which of course was the person making the most noise about this or declaring brother brandon to be infallible that everything that he said that was recorded was thus saith the lord because or in the days of the voice of the seventh angel worshiping brother branham or some member of his family the ministry of the word limited only to listening to recordings of brother branham america turned from god in 1956 so it's too late to evangelize her to reach out to the lost never mind brother branham continued doing this until his death in 1965. people claiming to be pastors who insist the congregation follow their so-called revelations claiming they somehow have exclusive insight into the truth and shun anyone who disagrees blasting people because love is corrective while having none of the attributes of love that paul describes in first corinthians 13 or that jesus displayed throughout his ministry or that brother branham displayed what's going on with all this confusion and contradiction after all there are many of our precious brothers and sisters with whom we will spend eternity caught up in some of this it would appear that those that lead in these ways and many of those that follow such leadership have lost sight of the big picture they've lost the context promoted their theories or so-called revelations as being what is important let's take a look for the moment at the bible as a document a collection of writings just just for a moment and the world of biblical scholarship those who study the texts and seek to put them in context or to search for original text or try to reconstruct the elusive source documents there are new testament bibles written in greek that incorporate all of the known texts from the various codices the page projected here is uh matthew 1 23-2-7 and it's in greek and it's very hard for you to see but it doesn't matter because i can't read it either but you'll find on these things that there'll be a passage and then there's footnotes to include all the known variations in that passage with letters indicating which ancient codex contains which variation some will be marked as all ancient documents say this exactly this way it can be relied upon some will be marked at the majority of the text read this way but a small number read this other way some sections say every one of them is a little bit different here and there's not much agreement on which one might be right so take your pick so i've tried to show the big picture with the body of text and focusing on the brush strokes is all of these footnotes here it's easy to get into a discussion about these things but such discussions often devolve into arguments and people can build doctrines that's a code word sometimes for fences around a particular variant and that's when you have to step back and stop focusing on a particular brush stroke or pigment choice or greek letter or word or message quote and look at the big picture for example there are variations in these manuscripts of the words ascribed to jesus in the sermon on the mount now all of these are written in greek and jesus didn't speak greek but the language of the text but jesus spoke aramaic a kind of a common man's hebrew but the point the big picture view is that none of the texts say blessed are the warmongers for they shall be called the sons of god they all say blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god it's the big picture in the transcripts of brother branham sermons i can show you where he said moses wife was named sarah conference with god 1960 paragraph 22. from the context we know he meant abraham the whole thing is about abraham but he used he said moses now it's recorded and the holy spirit didn't interrupt him and say oh go back i said that wrong i should have said abraham i'm sorry no that didn't happen no so if one holds it brother branham was somehow infallible in the recorded messages we have then you're stuck with creating a doctrine and claimed that moses had two wives or zipporah was a wound with a spirit of sarah or some other way to explain around this to hold on to this concept of infallibility and completely i'm sorry we must allow william branham to be a prophet as well as a human a human who plainly declared my words will fail not to instead try to make him more than a prophet or more than a man some go to the extreme of making him a god and worship him and pray to him and baptize in his name completely losing sight of the big picture the whole purpose of his ministry was to point us back to jesus and the faith of the spirit-filled early church not to replace either one any revelation or teaching or doctrine we're told has to track from genesis 1 1 to revelation 22 21 not from faith is a substance 1947 to communion 1965. the bible is a standard we must use to measure and judge all things spiritual while depending on the holy spirit to correctly interpret it to us giving us wisdom how to apply it in every circumstance and the message is a guide into that malachi 4 5 tells us the mission of the elijah ministry in our day was to turn us back to the faith of the fathers the early church not to replace it or its teachings was something new brother greene used to tell us he liked the german translation to correct those things that have gone off into error which clearly implies that not everything went off into error the mission was not to replace the bible with a church age book or a book of mormon or a collection of quotes it was not to replace a pope with a prophet or the ministry with recordings or the bible with quotes or the holy spirit with a computer here's a quote from a prophet about the ministry and the days of the tape recorder 1950 prodigal i'm so thankful for the tape recorders no i'm so thankful for the ministers here and them that sing that kind of inspired or help them help them along that's the purpose of being here is trying to help others brother branham's purpose in holding this meeting was to help not replace the local ministry and the local people and bring the loss to salvation to share the gift of healing he was commissioned to bring he says we i could never take the message to all the world myself the message he was commissioned to bring it's going to take thousands of tape recorders and books computers iphones no it will take thousands of us ministers of the gospel together to do this and together when we can unite ourselves it takes work that must be done by ministers in unity forgetting about listen closely what he says forgetting about our churches forgetting about our doctrines fences walls that separate and so forth to just know this one thing the message just to know this one thing christ and him crucified and know that among us the living christ and i think that god will fix him to do a marvelous work right away i believe we're going to see the moving of the spirit like we've never seen in all the ages the holy spirit the spirit of christ and of course we're always hearing about this term this phrase the word in the context of what we call the message people use that phrase often referring to recorded sermons the word of the hour it's not a bad thing not at all it's a very good thing but we must be really really careful too often we're encouraged by some that the moving of the spirit was in the 20th century pentecost or that it was only in brother branham that we've moved on we're beyond the outpouring of the spirit living in the body of christ we're in the bright age or the word age here's testimony from brother branham my commission 1951 so then later on it would come to me he's talking about these experiences that he had would speak to me tell me things that were going to happen well i stayed away from it after my conversion my own church in the baptist church i took it up with some of the ministers and so forth and they advised me to stay away from it never have nothing to do that it's wrong if anything comes to you said we them days of the supernatural that's on the other side said we live by the word how similar that sounds to what we often hear today the supernatural wizard brother branham's ministry we've moved beyond it it was for the pentecostal age we're living in the bright age phrases often times for saying the days of miracles are passed it was it ended in 1965. well brother branham goes on to say and i read one day where the letter kills but the spirit gives life we read that scripture during our opening this evening so i tried to push away i recognized it sat down tried to consider it just in the best way that i could we speak sometimes of the mechanics meaning the word knowledge wisdom understanding and the dynamics the spirit the life and they need to come together we need both the message was to show jesus christ the signs on the back of the building here the same yesterday and today and forever not just in the life and ministry of our precious brother william branham in each of us we each need that same jesus christ that same spirit in our lives and that the god mentioned in genesis 1 that created our universe is the same as a persian mentioned in saint john 1. there's another lesson about our christian walk we can learn from studying monet's masterpiece the big picture individual brush strokes i'm sure you've already seen it and that's that we are one body one masterpiece yet many members many brush strokes and pigments and so forth each of which is essential only work together in harmony to achieve our common goal can we find the meaning and fulfill god's purpose for our lives individually and as a church well in light of all this how would you answer this question teach me the message brought by brother william branham while i stand on one foot could be as simple as jesus is lord but that could lack context in our present time a possible response love god with all your heart soul mind and strength while treating others as you wish to be treated jesus christ is lord and is the same yesterday and today and forever the rest is commentary so go study read your bible pray listen with understanding there are other valid responses of course and you can probably condense it better than this poor example musicians would please come back i'd like to close tonight rereading mark 12 30. thou shalt love have agapo affection for the lord thy god with all thy heart thoughts feelings with all thy soul life breath with all thy mind understanding and with all thy strength forcefulness might ability this is the first the most important the greatest commandment the words of jesus but you know what we can read that but let's sing it we can sing it together there's a song based on this verse as part of our standing on one foot response as brother aaron comes to close the service it's called i give you my heart this is my desire i'm sorry i'm i'm between the keys again this is my desire to honor [Music] lord with all my heart i worship you all i have within me i give you praise [Music] is in you lord i give you my heart i give you my soul i live for you alone every breath that i take every moment i'm awake lord have your way in me this is my desire to honor you lord with all my heart i worship you all i have within me i give you praise all that i adore is in you lord i give you my heart i give you my soul i live for you alone every breath that i take every moment i'm awake lord have your way in me for his lord he is lord he has risen from the dead and he is lord [Music] knee shall bow every tongue confess that jesus christ is lord one more time [Music] oh he is lord he is lonely he has risen from the dead and he is lord every knee shall bow every tongue confess that jesus christ is lord [Music] see he was the one that rose from the dead and and every tongue has to confess that i want to be willing to say he's my lord and and if you catch and that's the holy spirit that's christ himself dwell in you and he is the interpreter of the word he's the one that wrote the book he's the one that shows you what it is i as brother i was speaking i just remembered some experiences in life of how how i reacted to certain things that happened i was asking two brothers fine brothers and i made this question to whom i asked him i said if god be with us then where are the miracles and they both answered me and said brother we are so far in the word today we don't need those things and it always puzzled me how could you say that if jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever i always pondered that another time talking with a brother and [Music] he was just talking he had his hands raised up in the air his eyes up and he was saying things that just didn't make a whole lot of sense and he turned around and looked at me and he said what do you think of that brother and i just said the first thing that came to mind i said personally i think you're nuts and i walked away i i i feel bad about that i never should have said that but it's just how it struck me but it's christ in us who can take this word and this message that we do believe and make it live in us we can be an example of jesus christ to others the same one that said woman where are they in accusers and she said they are gone he said neither do i condemn thee neither do i accuse thee the same one that looked at peter when peter said what he said and he said satan get behind me see he wasn't looking at peter he was looking at the motive in the spirit and he's the one that checks our hearts for us i said this is what if you would have sat down with monet and and watched and paid and asked him questions he might be able to tell you this is what i'm trying to express this is what i'm trying to do and that's what the spirit of christ does in us and that same mercy and grace has been extended to me i want it extended to each and every one of us today let's stand just thinking of their words but they didn't remember all the song because if he is not lord of everything then he's not loaded lord at all so lord i surrender all let's pray lord jesus we've been we've been here many years now and there's just a few left there were were still that were born around the time or were still living when brother branham was here on earth lord but you took your servant home because you were done with him lord but you gave us a promise that you would fill us with the holy spirit you would fill us with the holy ghost lord and that would be our keeper that would be our guide that would teach us how to love one another how to encourage one another lord and that's christ in us the hope of glory lord today right even in our own city sometimes lord there's not a lot of fellowship and not a lot of harmony just simply because of the different beliefs lord but we all claim to believe the same lord jesus christ lord let god be manifested in us let others say truly there's a christian which means they are christ-like lord that's our desire today lord and may we spend time with you may we read your word may we talk with you may we bathe in your presence lord so we could we could catch the full essence the full mealing of what you desire today lord is our prayer in jesus christ's name amen let the brother tell me that we were in the millennium now and that when jesus said if you open up the your heart and i enter in that's communion so that we don't take communion anymore and he gave me this long thing about where we are at today and just asked him a question i thought there would be a body change though i said and he goes he looked at me i said because you're getting up in age and if we're in the millennium now how old are you going to be in the millennium i said 100 200 300 400 years old he just put his head down he says well i guess eventually there has to be a body change and i said yes that's what we're all looking for and i say even so come quickly lord jesus amen amen yes he [Music] is lord he has risen from the dead and he is [Music] knee shall bow every tongue confess that jesus christ is lord lord willing we'll be here sunday morning and see what the lord has for us come expecting say lord i have a need minister to me today and god will show as you go amen take the name of jesus with you [Music] take the name of jesus with you child of sorrow and avoid it will joy and come forgive you take it then wherever you go precious oh how sweet hope of earth and joy of heaven precious name oh how sweet hope of earth and joy of heaven take the name of jesus ever as a shield from every sin if temptation round you gather breathe that holy name and prayer preciously oh how sweet hope of earth and joy of heaven precious name oh how sweet hope of earth and joy of him hold the precious name of jesus high with our souls with joy when his loving arms receive us and his songs are tongues employed precious man oh how sweet hope of earth and joy of
