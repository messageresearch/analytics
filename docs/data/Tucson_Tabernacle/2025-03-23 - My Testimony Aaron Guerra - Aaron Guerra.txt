scripture 1 Peter chapter 3 verse 15 1 Peter chapter 3:1 15 it says this but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks your reason for the hope that is within you with meekness and fear having a good conscience that whereas they speak evil of you as evil evildoers they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ as I said we're GNA have our dear brother Aaron tonight give his personal testimony and I've been looking forward to this all week brother Aaron's a special brother to me and I know he's a special brother to everyone here that's been part of this church let's ask the Lord to join us in prayer our heavenly father first Lord we lift up these prayer requests before you in the name of your son Jesus Christ

answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear having a good conscience that whereas they speak evil of you as evildoers that they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ brother Aaron he's always ready to give a testimony and as I've thought of brother Aaron and I haven't known him that long when I was in Jeffersonville I talked to him on the phone I think one time and then when Stephanie and I moved here um I looked to brother Aaron and I thought I'd like to know what's below the surface of brother Aaron and as I got to know him what you see on the surface with brother Aaron goes all the way to the bone that is him he is a just a genuinely good man and I look forward brother Aaron to hearing your testimony tonight very much forward brother Michael do we have one more song we could sing [Music] when he moves among us all that he does all of his mercy and all of his love if a pin of a writer can write every day even this world it could never contain just how I've been blessed warmth in the winter and flowers in Spring laugh of Summer the changing of leaves the food on my table and a good place to

[Music] blessed amen I had asked brother Mike if he would sing that song Especially of a mother and a father and I have been blessed appreciate that thank you God bless you appreciate the musicians being here and helping I do the work that goes to be able to do those things uh some people have a natural gift and some of us struggle all the way through it but either way we give God all honor and Glory so let's just bow our heads here Lord this evening I I want to give you honor and Glory I know the things you've done in my life but I'm not the only one you've done so many precious things for all of us Lord and if we would sit down and and just think about it sometimes Lord all we could do is thank you and Praise You Lord even the hard times even the rough times there was a reason for them Lord you were wounded for our transgressions you were bruised for our iniquities the chastisement for our peace was laid upon you and by your stripes we were healed Lord so when I ask you Lord do you understand you understand Lord and we just want to love you for that today in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated I uh got to thinking about my life and the goodness of God I was one to be privileged to raised in a Christian home and it is a privilege it doesn't make us any better than anybody else we still need needed God to save us we still needed him to become real to us but we didn't suffer some of the things that others had suffered and you know it's it's there were those in the Bible like Samuel who was raised as a child in church and there were those like Peter who ran from the very one he promised that he would never turn his back on but God still loved him both so so I just like to share this and I'll try to keep it under how long honey okay you don't have to be embarrassed the rest of the night I've made many mistakes in my life the one decision I'll never regret is giving my life to Jesus I know there's no regret for that you know it's so I've shared this before our neighbor down the street they had a TV at home and we didn't and we wanted so much to go over the house and watch cartoons with them and they always wanted to be at our house and one day I convinced them we could go to their house we did and uh we're watching ing the cartoons and all of a sudden his little brother comes running out and says let's get out of here Mom and Dad are at it again and then we started hearing the fighting the banging and they were actually fighting and they ran out the door and we followed them we ran back to our house and these were his words to me he said that's why I'd rather be at your house this never happens at your house prise God that's a blessing you might not know it when you're growing up but when you look back you realize God has been so good so good to us Isaiah 2612 thou will ordain peace for us for thou has also wrought all our works in us it's not the goodness that we have it's not the goodness of what we done but it's Christ in us the hope of glory and then Jeremiah 29:11 he says for I know the thoughts that I think toward you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end you know I I've looked at that sometimes and I said Lord you know what you expected of us and where we would end even though we didn't and you gave it to us am nothing we deserved and then I was I was going through the message the unveiling of God and I just paragraphed 85 I don't know if they have it but it's like a man building Chimes or making Chimes the molder each Bell has got to ring different from the other the same materials but so much iron so much steel so much brass to make it give The Ting and I don't know if you can hear but I can hear the Ting but you have your Ting and I have my Ting and together we produce what God wanted to hear if we all sounded the same he would have just made robots that's good but he made you who you are he's brought you through what your life has been to produce and to bring forth what he wants to hear am so as I look at this and I just I don't know where I got this but it just spoke to me never be a prisoner of the things that happened in your past God wanted you to learn a lesson and not serve a life sentence we learned the lesson and sometimes some of us don't learn so quick might have to learn it a few times but when you learn the lesson you get to go on you know so I had the privilege again of being born and raised in a Christian home my mother and my father gave their their hearts to the Lord at a young when they were young mom was believe she told me she was about 17 16 16 years old when she gave her heart to the Lord and she received the Holy Ghost my father was 1617 also my dad gave a testimony on how he would come home and my grandmother would be sitting by the door with a Bible in her hand and tell him son don't do those things don't go and he said I gave my heart to the Lord but I went back he said I never went drinking nothing but I like to go to the dances he said and I was on my way to the dance when the hand of the Lord reached over and took me by the shoulder and for one year I was one sick young man until I repented and gave my heart back to him and he filled me with the Holy Ghost so we have a testimony we have a a part of my family my brothers and sisters of seeing having a Christian home and I thank God for that it's still troubl it's still hard because you have to know God for yourself but to have a good example before you Dad was born in in Los Angeles because grandma was pregnant with him and she went to visit family and she had him there but he was raised in Texas they were a Catholic Family and I asked my dad I said how did you come what we would call Christians or Pentecostal Christians my grandmother my dad's mother had breast cancer and she was Catholic and one of her one of the relatives I'm not sure who was an uncle had become a Christian Pentecostal Christian and she told her told my grandmother he said I'm going to take you to this church and they're going to pray for you and God is going to heal you but you have to promise to give your life to him so she took him to service they prayed for him and the cancer fell off her breast and she gave her heart to the Lord and the family Then followed so when we grew up we grew up in a Christian home and I they they the whole family ended up moving to California and that's where I was born Southern California uh in 1959 yes that's a long time ago but uh God has kept us you know and and so we were raised in a Pentecostal Church mom had had been they were from Central California up in the Fresno area and I asked her a little bit about her background and she said her dad my grandfather gave his heart to the Lord he was the first one in the 40s and then they followed along and all began to attend attend a Pentecostal Christian home or church I asked her her about receiving the Holy Spirit now she's listening I know but I remember she told us many times that when she had received the Holy Spirit she was enveloped in just a ball of fire when God and if you look back in the history of the Pentecost Pentecost there were amazing things that happened then my dad would tell me about one of the one of the ministers that he was brought up under they would have prayer meetings and they'd call the fire department because the church was on fire and then the fire department would get there and the church wasn't on fire it was a pillar of fire going up and down the church because he's still God he never changes and that's one thing my dad taught us Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Lessons Learned my older brother he he he kind of went a little sideways and uh one thing we learned that if my dad prayed things happened and I'm glad they did but at the same time sometimes it it made you a little nervous and a little afraid daddy don't pray like that for me but my brother got a got off a little bit off to the side and my dad prayed Lord break his arm if you have to get his attention and we heard about it me and my younger brother and my brother came home from work with a broken arm show me and my younger brother learned our lesson you know it just listen to what Dad tells you be respectful be honest one of the things that in the church that we we grew a Pentecostal Church they believe that speaking in tongues was the evidence of the Holy Ghost so that was what they everybody strived for was to speak in tongues and they the way they brought it they brought it in a way that you were going to hell if you didn't speak in tongues so they were try to scare you into try to drive you into it they would bring ministers that were well known for getting people to speak in tongues and we were raised that way we thought it was right but I remember as a young man young boy maybe between 10 and 12 years old wondering about these young men the young people there that were speaking in tongues but were living a totally different Life Church would start all the young people sat up in the front two rows that that's just the way it was and as soon as the music started all of them were dancing shouting praising God the music stopped they sat down when the music Started they got up and J Jump and shouted and I wondered is it just a button you push is that what it is and then as I began to grow and began to be around them I said that's not a life a Christian should be living now you ask me did I understand no I wondered so that that's how we were raised we were raised to love the Lord we were raised to go to church we are raised to read our Bibles and and I appreciate the fact that my grandmother my grandfather my parents my they were all Christians they lived a life so it was a good testimony around us but I was troubled for a long time because I did not speak in tongues because that was the Holy Ghost and then got into junior high and we went to a little bit of High School in California before we moved here and um my mom I uh she was just and she still is just a wonderful mother a good Christian uh she stayed home she raised us my dad worked in construction run a construction company my dad was a little more rough so Mom had the go Holy Ghost and so did Dad but I would go to mom because she was easier to work with I'm just just going to be honest with you and if I would come home and Mom wasn't home home I had to find her to make sure the Rapture hadn't taken place never did that with my dad but with my mother I would call everybody where is Mom that's the life my mom my dad we saw the Rough Side of him running he he was not a mean man but he was rough okay it's just being a young boy but I always question God if you're real where are you I always wondered so we were raised in a Pentecostal church and uh good influences kept us away from things we we never drank in my life never smoked in my life never did drugs I never kissed a girl until I married my wife and we I kissed her at the altar God now the funny story was that we were sharing that testimony with our neighbor when we were testifying to him and I told him the first time I kissed a girl was my my wife in church and he goes of all the places to kiss a girl you kissed your wife in church and then I explained to him after we were married at the altar and they laugh that was so strange to them to us it was a way of a Christian LIF you but the honest truth is you can live like a Christian but until you have an experience with God that's all you're doing is living like a Christian and so we were raised that way it doesn't make me a better person it's just how God allowed us to be Mom and Dad both gave their lives as as young people they were married in 1955 and they stayed together till dad passed away they were just a couple M months short of 70 years married and I never saw them thank you I never saw them I never saw my mom disrespect my father and my dad did what he could for my mother my mother lost her eyesight and we got here from uh California she had a a disease that's very rare and I've never found something to help her but if you saw my mom she has her glasses on and people would wonder why we walk her in she's blind but she doesn't want to act like it she says no and I know that God is going to touch her if not in this life and the other life and then she's going to look at me and she's going to say Maya you don't you don't look like I remember you but she loved us she cared for us when the message we first heard the message we're still in California my dad was questioning the Pentecostal beliefs we had gone to a concert of all the all the choirs in that area they did it on outside and I was 13 14 years old and every choir came up and sang a song or two and I said to myself this is nothing but a competition who's better and I'm just going to be honest with you Mo mostly it was Hispanic his Spanish speaking churches but one of the the ministers invited a black choir from Los Angeles now if I was going to rate the best one nobody else was close to that black choir they were good so the next that was on a Saturday evening we go to church on Sunday morning we went to church Sunday morning Sunday evening and Wednesday and any special meetings we were raised that way and I don't regret it because you give a young man alone time you know he'll get into trouble but if you keep God before him and you reach your arm around them and you take them with you and you live a life of a Christian it'll have an effect on them so my uncle my dad's brother was a pastor and he began to talk about a what a wonderful celebration we had and if my dad felt a certain way or had the leading of the Lord he was not afraid to speak it till the day he passed away and he stood up and he said I will show you the vision that the lord gave me of what he saw he said to the Lord it looked like a bunch of people walking around in a sessle throwing it at each other how would you like to hear that right in the middle of a service but I knew that I had thought the same thing I said this is not worship to God this is performance I didn't know that God was working in my life I just wondered why so the message came our way my dad was still working and we began to con congregate with a brother who had pulled out of the Pentecostal church and he told my dad you can congregate with us but you can't say nothing about what you're believing so we started going over and congregating with them and then my dad dad began to tell him about it so he said told my dad you can preach it but you can't mention that man's name off the pulpit okay you know what don't let that stop you just keep being a Christian just keep telling them keep living a life and let go to work so that brother then took a trip this would have been in 75 out to Tucson and he visited the message churches and he came back he said that it's nothing but the truth let's let's believe it let's begin to preach it so we we that's where we first started believing the message listening to the tapes and doing that we didn't know everything we still don't but we knew we had found something that I said hey this comes down to the heart and this sounds real so we moved we moved to Tucson my mom's family had had actually received the message up in the Fresno area and they passed it on to us a lot of them were living in Tucson we came here we attended the Spanish Tabernacle IM Tabernacle in Manuel where brother Isaac Nora still the pastor and we began to attend church there and there's reasons why and you've heard it before I came in like we're coming in the service this way me and my two brothers came in and we walked this way and this young lady that my wife sitting here was walking that way and I happened to turn and look sideways and I looked and I said she walked a little bit like this and I said to myself I wonder if that girl knows if it rains she'll drown and then I asked her to marry me not that same day but down the road and I have been blessed we're going on 46 years married now what God puts together that no man put under that means you and her don't do that love one another stand for one another as much as you can so we we went to church there and we came to the Tabernacle for the meetings the first time we ever went to any meetings with message meetings was in the summer of 75 in Flagstaff and December of 75 here at the Tabernacle before we moved and we began to see what I said now these are Christians I found out that they were human too but I found a different Spirit amongst them that they love the Lord so we move here Dad is um we sold everything we had in California paid cash for everything due to Dad's injury and the union and all it took a couple years to resolve all of that so we went to work and went to school together so it was a quick growing up and um I thought of joining the military and I was kind of dissuaded not to do that so instead I got married and had children and I thank God for that it's it's been a I I have to say it's been a nothing but a blessing for me God gave me daughters he knows why I don't but he does so after the sixth one was born and Rachel was born here when we were attending the Tabernacle my wife told me if you want to have a boy you're going to have to have them yourself and I said I've seen what it takes to have children and no thank you but God gave me two good son-in-laws so and a and a a grandson and boy those those are the fun ones yeah but God has been good to us like I said we started in the message at the Spanish Church they're my brothers and they're my sisters amen I've asked this to the Lord over and over if on that day you ask me and I see this person whoever it is from wherever they are if it's okay if they come to Heaven don't ever let me even hesitate to think otherwise and say say Lord let them in because why am I any better that I could come in it's his Amazing Grace it's his Bloodshed for me it's his goodness for me right I want to be able to say let them in Lord let them in he went out Jesus went out looking everywhere for that one he says he goes she goes and she looks he goes and he looks when he gives his parables Heaven won't be heaven without them now I had a brother from the church over there who told me that if we didn't believe it a certain way we couldn't go to heaven so I felt the lord gave me an answer and I'll share it with you I said and he my uncle he was my uncle he's the one that got me working in the Cabinetry business and I said Uncle I said what of these people are there when you get to heaven what are you g to do and he looks at me kind of funny are you're going to go up to the Lord and say if those people are here I don't want to be here I said what choice do you have where do you if you're not going to be in heaven where are you going to be and he stops and he just looks at me for a moment and he goes I hadn't thought of that I said I know you haven't you're sending them to hell but you're giving yourself Heaven I said you better the only way you're going to make it is you better have your heart where all like Jesus said all I wish all that would come I've given my all for all and no I've you I've shared this one before young man gets up to to heaven and as they say Peter's at the door and Peter's showing him around and he comes to the corner over us side and there's the Baptist Church over here he opens the door he said these are the good Baptists that were saved they're having a wonderful Baptist service and these are the methodists and these are the Pentecostals and he goes sh come here and they peek open the door and he goes these are the message people but be quiet because they think they're the only ones here no we're all going to make it by the grace of God and I'm not here to choose who is and who isn't I just have to be sure I'm ready to go so we are raised a certain way you've heard What's Happening Now what's coming out out of there and any way that Satan could cause confusion distractions he'll do it but until that day they're my brothers they're my sisters and I love them you know so there was going back to a little bit this is one of the the things that really struck me where we're still part of the Pentecostal Church my father was asked to be a pastor of one of the churches but he told him I can't because I don't believe speaking in tongues is the evidence of the Holy Ghost they said well if you'll just not say nothing you can be the pastor so my dad's brother young brother was and he's the one that we just went to his funeral service back in December prayed because it was a lady that had walked off the streets and and they knew him they lived in that area and he he he said Lord if she speaks in tongues I'll know that speaking in tongues is the evidence of the Holy Ghost and she spoke in tongues so he said my brother is wrong and I'm right two weeks later she was back out in the world living the life of a prostitute that she was and my Dad tried to explain to my uncle is that all the power of the Holy Ghost could do and he shared that with us and so I began to look in my own life what is happening in my life not what's happening in yours what's happening in mine and that's where we need to be sure it's in ours you can only let the light shine in your life if the light is there so when we get here of course we come out of a Pentecostal background a lot of the Spanish people had come out there and and so you know family was there that's what we were part of but things went on things happened and just the details and and we felt that maybe it was time for us to move and we came made a decision as a family to come to the Tabernacle even though we had been told a lot of things about what happened here and that's okay wherever there's people there's things that happen and so we came in the church and and we walked in would always call the back but it's the front really because you walk in from that side is you walking from the front door well not this church but I came in and I'm looking around and I'm I'll just be honest I was judging the people how did they look how did they dress how were they acting and I found a sweet spirit and I said my that's a different spirit so we come we're here a short time the girls were all young Rachel my youngest was born right after that and after about being here about a month maybe two my father had been here for several years he had started doing some missionary work brother green asked myself and my wife to go sit with him in the office and we did and um he began to just talk with us and my wife shared something with him they used to call her little Tears like which means she cried all the time and they all say you're just a crybaby you're just a cry baby that's all and she would feel terrible so she shared that with brother green and brother green goes sister the reason you cry is You Can Be Touched by others Fe others feelings and it took that spirit and just turned it around and after that she could reach out to others sometimes it's us that needs a little bit of change and not everybody else so this is kind of where maybe I I began to be to do more things after we left the Spanish church we were ra raising our children we were quite busy um we we came we were here for a short time and those of you have been quite here some time remember brother Paul Nora he had the the musicians up here they fill this whole area to a three violin a saxophone some flutes there was there was quite a bit and brother Paul came up he says you play saxophone don't you and I said yeah he says why don't you come and join the musicians and I just want to show you that I never asked for any of this brother Paul came up and we became part of the music around 1990 91 we got here in ' 8891 or so there was a couple of things that went through was there were some people that were starting to say the message wasn't true and and a group group of people left another brother came through here and he took a group of people and brother Al Peterson brother arie's father grandpa to the the Petersons there and he asked myself and brother Jerry mcfaden to start helping just ushering and doing things like that so we did and brother Jerry had a young family I we had the young girls and brother Jerry went back a couple months later and asked him if he could come back and sit with his family help raise the kids and brother Al says you go sit down you go do that and I told Brother Al I heard it I was standing there and I said brother Al I have more children than he has let me go back and help and brother Al said no you stay back here with me and one of the greatest mentors that I have worked with was brother El Peterson a good spirit a good man and and he he showed me how to be around people I saw his human side too and he just said I'm sorry you you saw the human side of me and I said yeah and that makes me love you more because you're not trying to be something you're not you're being a Christian so so we began to work and eventually uh there where brother uh Lyle is sitting that's where I sat and I became a deacon and old brother Dan they didn't vote back then brother green just people did the job and people did it and I was standing there and brother green walks and he's standing by the door and I turned to him and I've been doing that work for some time and I looked at him and I said brother green I didn't put myself here I was asked to do this and he just looked at me he said brother brandom told me that the people that are going to do the work are just going to come and do it brother and you just stay there again we didn't we didn't look for it but my heart was was to serve my heart was to be part of whatever I could do and we didn't have any boys and God knows why I probably would have got too involved in baseball and football and everything else and I'm not saying it's wrong but I probably would have gotten involved but there were some young men that came to the church because Mom and Dad had separated and they started attending the church and I took those boys and I befriended them I'd take him shooting we'd go play ball I became a big brother to them it helped me and it helped them and some of you may know them Josh Hernandez Nathaniel Grant two that I that I took on and we spent a lot of time together we did a lot of things I played football once with brother Lyall Johnson's voice that was a mistake one of the boys not his sons but one of the other boys was going into the military and they had something for him so we played football and they had played for Sabino and I could hardly walk after the game but I got I got to be around some of the young men out here after church have been here a long time ago there would always be the young people playing ball and stuff like that so we got to do things like that with them and I always wondered did I do any good did I help them did I ra not raise them but did I give Nathaniel's mom sister Grant come came back a few years ago and she said this to my wife she said the Nathaniel had told her brother Aaron will never know what he did for me no I won't but just that said Thank You Lord John is now an associate pastor of a church in um not Louisiana right around there somewhere and he calls me every once in a while just to tell me thank you for helping me out when I was a young man if you knew me way back then I wore a full mustache I shaved it off when this part started growing and it looked kind of funny so he used to call me panova so he still does he'll call me up he goes hey brother panova how are you doing God knows how and what you're capable of and what he wants you to do even though you might think you should be doing something else so that was part of my my growing up being being um part of the Tabernacle in I never asked for any of this and I still don't know why God allowed it to be but he wanted it some of the things that that happened we were out here after after service kind of like we do but all the kids would play basketball and everything and the little ones and the big ones and there'd be a full basketball game going and kids running between it and all and so you just kind of stand out there and watch for the ones that are going to get knocked over or what and there was the anthon family here and little Julia she was only about what four or five years old maybe she was just little and uh I was standing by the main main fence the one that the big one pulled open and um sister Carolyn miles comes running up to me holding Julia and Julia is kind of flopped over like this I I and her eyes completely rolled back in white she runs up to me and she says brother Aaron sister Julia little Julia and I look down and they're just white no sign of life I don't know I just reached my hands over at church and I said little Julia in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I give you back your life she pops straight up and said put me down and ran off God now it happened it happened I know God answers prayer and let me tell you you don't have to be the perfect righteous man or righteous sister call on God and he will answer those are the things that God allowed in my life uh uh I I just I was trying to remember some more of them just things that God we we we were able to go with my dad down into Mexico we helped out down there I interpreted some Services we we a little bit here a little bit there a little bit here to learn I haven't learned it all I ask God to let me be still willing to learn not too old to learn but it's just how God began to bring me up to a place where he knew that he would have me help otherwise and in the military a good um what would you call it a a good Lieutenant someone that has been through the school to get that that um I'm trying to think of the word I was going to say degree not AE but get that position in the military an officer will take a a a sergeant that has been in the military and has learned and has good experience and he'll work with that sergeant and says you've been here and they'll work together even though he's a high ranked officer he'll lean on them and that's what we do with one another you've experienced things that I haven't I've experienced and we lean on one another and say I've been through that God is able to and that's how we help one another you know so we raised the girls here we were part of the church here we played the music and and uh whatever we could do help and one day I was some of us take a long time to learn some of you learn quickly I was almost 50 years old brother green came up to me at the door there and he goes could have talked to you for a little while and we went over to his office and he said do you feel like you could be an associate Minister for the Tabernacle well I said if I could help I would but I don't know if I'm called I've never had any that came from Heaven said you're called to be you know kind of how you want it a big sign somebody to speak in tongues somebody to interpret for you that's it's easier that way than taking God by faith and standing on his word and he said I've I've watched you I've listened to you I've we've had you help us out and I would like you to be part of the ministry here I still scratch my head sometimes and wonder how did all this come to pass I don't have a degree and I know you don't need it I don't have the education I know you don't need it but it sure would help in some places you know and he asked me to become part of the ministry here and you know I accepted it having no idea that at one time at coming up in the future what was going to take place brother green was going to be around for another 50 years or so you know just kind of looked at it that way so we began to work that way uh brother Nathaniel Johnson brother Vern Harris brothers that took me under their wing brother Nathaniel took me out to meet folks to pray with him you know go out and encourage them brother Harris after brother El Peterson went up with his son-in-law brother Mark brother inh hared back there and they mentored me they they were they were just sharing their experiences uh how to deal with people how to work with people till the day came that we thought would never happen and that was brother green passing away we we knew it was going to happen but you just didn't think it was going to happen remember the morning when the news came out that brother green had passed away but what brother Dan didn't know then nor any of us that God was working on that end already because God doesn't get surprised by anything now he's like oh man I got to run back and I got to fix this now he didn't go with Jonah in a whale what do I do now no he knew exactly what was happening amen now you may have messed up he knew you were going to messed up you're going to learn your lesson Len as a child you're raising your old children raised six daughters and and you know the oldest one got treated one way the youngest one got treated a little different the oldest one thinks the youngest one got away with everything yeah Naomi or no she raised her hand but you know but you learned your lessons you know now now that they're all I can't say older um they have all grown up they get along well they encourage one another they stand with one another they help one another but it's a processing growing it's a process in learning so we we began to do that we began to you know learning that and brother green passing away and this is a part that I I don't I just always wondered why and some of you know what happened some of you don't know and in the passing away of brother green and and all of that um we were going to lose the church the portion of the family and and it turned into to be quite a quite a quite a battle and if it wasn't for the Peterson family uh brother Dan has mentioned it they had come and changed out all the locks so we couldn't get in but they missed one and the Peterson family got and they came and unlocked all the doors and we began to work with that this is God's house it's not brother Dan's house it's not my house it's not your house this is God's house you understand you understand what I mean God calls and we come but this is God's house and we always remember that this is God's house we come to worship him we come to praise him we come to lift him up but the greatest evidence that you're worshiping God is known and how you're treating others because the greatest in all gave his life for you he was willing to take your place on the cross he was willing to be scorned and turned against and and and and run down in your place I was was praying here this happened twice and I've shared this before praying up here in the Altar and I ask the Lord and and don't be afraid to talk to God talk to him don't get on your knees and beg him talk with him one of the hard one of the things that I would trouble me was when the girls were coming dad will you please please please I would say no ask me what you want because every time you say please I'm going closer to a no get on your knees and talk to him like he's your father and he cares for you he understands he knows but he wants to hear that from you father I trust you father I believe you I know that you're more than able and and and you're encouraging yourself I asked him if he understood the feeling of being abandoned separated that and the words just rung out of me did not I cry out my God my God why has Thou forsaken me well what are you going to say oh Lord I'm sorry you do when I had the foot surgery I asked him and I'll talk to my God that way I'm his son I I respect him and I R but I want to talk with him I want to fellowship with him and I asked him if he understood foot pain because I had the toe amputated from diabetes and all and right there at the same spot he said were that was that not my bloody Footprints going up to Calvary he says I understand I know I know what you're going through you know and when my wife was having the children uh I was in the room for all of them but she had them you know what I did I tried to encourage her I try to that's all I could do just be there sayia come on you've already had one you've had two you've had three you had four you've had five you've had six now H and we you know and he does the same thing I've been where you're at he says and he tries to encourage you we uh you can talk to God and he'll answer you if you're listening if you're willing to I shared this one we went El hunting six five six years ago up in the White Mountains my two of my supervisors we work together me and Tony work together from 84 and me and Jim from 95 we've known each other for many years working in the Cabinetry business and we were out hunting using Jim's cabin Jim killed his on Friday we packed it out and found out how how much fun that isn't climbing through the mountains so Saturday we we're hunting and you have to know how God talks to you because he doesn't talk to everybody the same way my six daughters on some of them I could just look at him and they would stop some of them I had to talk and someone had to talk to them a little harder but they all got the attention it was how how you deal with them okay okay and I heard that voice not a literal voice but the voice that speaks to me in my mind it says what are you here for and I said I answered it this way that was for brother brandom and a few minutes later he goes what are you here for and again I said that was for brother brandom Lord aren't you listening to me that's the action that we're taking Lord don't you understand and the third time he asked me what are you here for we're sitting on a ridge I'm looking up at the hill there's a game Trail coming down I said I want him to come down that game Trail come right down the middle here turn around and go out that way and I spoke it I sat there and I look up in the very top of the Grain Trail I can see two elk but I could not see the head just the belly I didn't know if they were Bulls or cows and we're bull hunting and my boss had killed his the day before so he's spotting for me and he goes don't shoot the first one shoot the second one I said I have a gut a heart shot of the first one but a gut shot I wait till they move the first one is a small bull the second one steps out 6 by6 knocked him down right there 180 yards and that other bull ran down came down came right in front of me turned around and ran back up exactly like I had asked that's just God telling me I'm aware of you I'm care for you that's not cuz I'm special that's cuz God cares now he blessed me beyond that we had backpacked U Jim's elk the day before and let the young guys do that it took us it wasn't a long look but it was 14° out and there was snow on the ground saw some Mountain Lion tracks I'm glad that's all we saw just the tracks they were pretty big and we get his out it was quite a job while we go and get mine Jim says I'm going to go get the packs and this guy drives up in a quad and stops right below us and we said how do you get in here and he said drive your truck around come this road parked the truck right under there we hiked him down 40 yards and put him in the back a truck and drove him out God hey thank you Lord amen God answers prayer I asked him do you know my name I'd got home I don't remember what happened but my wife just said go to the room I'll handle it I sat down I grabbed my Bible and I said Lord do you know my name and I opened the Bible and it FS on Psalms 115 verses 9 10 11 and 12 and it says oh House of Aaron I have blessed you and kept you it says it three times he didn't say I know you he said oh House of Aaron and I was just asking me if he knew where I lived and in my name yes he does and the blessing the greater blessing in that is my daughter Elizabeth I shared it with my girls she comes one day and she knocks on the door and she says Dad can I talk to you and she she I said come on in and she says you know how the Lord showed you your name in the Bible I asked asked him the other day can you show me my name do you know like you did for my father and she opens it into Luke and it says and her name was Elizabeth and she was of the House of Aaron it was already in the scripture you didn't have to add it it was there God is knows all things he's he's in control of it all but you know when I wake up tomorrow I may ask him again Lord are you aware of this he knows he understands those are things that God will do in your life if you let him do it when brother green passed away and kind of laugh about this but we got quite a few calls and self invites of ministers who said God called them to be our pastor and I thought well they serve a different God than I served them because my God's not confused as who should be the pastor because all tenim and the Lord told them that they should be the pastor and I wondered here in Tucson everybody knows Tucson Tabernacle but out in Mississippi and some there's churches that have been I heard from different ones we've been looking for the last 10 years to find of a person a pastor but nobody wants to come out this way nobody wants to do this little church and you know I said Lord you know who the pastor is to be and and he did because when we were in the meeting with the family the brother that we thought would take the pastorship said no and he said I'll have nothing to do with this I'll attend the Tabernacle but I won't he turned in all his keys and everything and then the family turned around and said who will then take the the responsibility and brother Jordan was there brother Arie was there brother Dale Knight and a couple other brothers were sitting there with the family right out here I believe that meeting was here and I said I will the words came out without me thinking but then after that I was why did I say that but God had a reason God had a reason somebody was going to to help to hold this place until God sent the man who he had already seen but he knew it was going to be about 10 years down the road you didn't know that and I didn't know that but God was working on that already he also know who would be here and who wouldn't and that's that's got and we can't get we we can't question him in the sense like why did you do that like you didn't ask me he says that's right because you would have just confused it more but the congregation voted me to be the the pastor for that first year and I I thank brother Al Peterson brother edgal brother Jordan and myself four brothers who kept the church together for a year and then the boat was taken again to continue to look for a pastor and I said I'll help you as long as I can we went through a couple of different Brothers a lot of you were here then but because of where brother Daniel's background had been been we would have never thought it would have come that way but I will say this sister Stephanie we met them when they were young they were still part of the church here but I will say this anytime he saw me or talked to me he treated me well I never got anything like oh you are not tapes only or you're not no he treated me like a brother he asked me today why I treated him that way and I'm say why not give me a reason not to treat you like a brother but that's no reason I should still treat you like a brother because I gave him every reason to not treat me like one of his own but he gave his life for me that's how much he cared now in that process we're going to getting to where brother diam becomes the pastor brother Lyall and he has become one of the finest men I've gotten to know I didn't really know of I knew of him but we really didn't know him before that time because they had moved away and I encouraged him when he started coming itd be willing to help us out and I'm amazed what he does and how he does it I didn't know all those things how he brings them out lays them out and everything it's amazing but God now I'm going to share this and I'm I'm not embarrassing you brother Lyall you know that I love brother ly sister Heather wonderful people when brother Lyall retired I knew I knew his family but really didn't know we knew who they were hardy hardy spend any time with them they had a retirement party and they had it at one of the boys houses and his boys and sister Heather came up to me and said this thank you for giving us our dad back to us and I scratched my head I never took him away from you I didn't know and and he told us later he had gotten so involved with work and everything was going on but inviting him to be it it he began to work here and the boy said you gave us our father back to us and getting to know brother Lyle I wouldn't mind at all being called one of his sons he'd have a difficult explanation if they saw me but he has turned out you're one of the finest Brothers I've gotten to know and I appreciate that I [Applause] do I don't know why God allowed it to be that way but God knew what he was doing to get to work with brother Arie now brother Jordan our new trustees these young people never thought I'd say those words but yeah it's been a blessing no I never spoke in tongues yeah over there but God has been in my life over and over and over he's shown me I still care for you I still watch for you you're mine you're my son it's not my ability I I graduated from high school with a good grade but I didn't take any hard classes either basic math I did English because hey I knew English I took Spanish because I knew Spanish guaranteed a you know but God knows how to bring someone up and what to do and my heart now is how can I help yes amen what can I do I wish I had the energy and the strength of a young man but most of the time you haven't had enough experience as a young man to when you finally learn it you don't have the energy to do it we uh one of the things that I did is I when I was called up to minister and we would do I would going a minister on Sunday I would take Saturday evening and I'd go for a long walk turn everything else off and not be dist distracted by anything walked down it's about a quarter of a mile walk from my house to the out of our street and then turn East and when I would get East I would shut everything else out and when everything else should shut out I could hear God speak to me not in an audible voice but he would begin to bring things in he would begin to show things that at home I was too busy at work I was too busy there was too many other dist distractions get some quiet time with the Lord Brother Dan goes up to a place wherever it is and get some quiet time away from it and you just start turning everything else off you can live without a tv nobody has died because of lack of TV right brother Dan there's nothing in in in the hospital where you're being trained about how to deal with that is there no nobody's died that way way they've died from the lack of God I don't have I Love You Lord but I just don't have a time for you now so last night I went out and took a walk I hadn't done that for a while I had injured my knee and walking hasn't been the easiest but I went out and I walked about two miles in the quiet and I told my wife when I got home I got to start doing this more again CU I left just left everything at home and just said Lord I'm here for you make some quiet time for him however it is you can he'll talk to you he'll speak to you four times and I've shared this I'm going to finish with this four times God has spoken to me audibly in my life first time when I was about 16 years old I had my eyes on a man my eyes were on him if he said amen I said amen I was sitting about where sister Martha sister Lily sitting right about there and he was sitting where about Sister Crystal is right there and I could see him and if he said amen in the church service I said amen in the service if he shook his head I shook my head if he didn't do nothing I didn't do nothing and I had a voice speak to me so it would be on my left ear by the aisle there and it said loudly is that man your Holy Ghost and I turned to look and nobody was standing there I didn't didn't get it at first I just wondered but then I realized I was just following what he was doing the next time God spoke to me in an audible voice I I I asked him and again let me say you can talk to him he'll talk back to you he'll answer you in a way you'll understand and I asked him verbally I asked him there the the two times I asked him when I was here he just gave me the thoughts I said Lord what does a pastor need to understand that was at the time that we were looking for a pastor and this one said Lord call me and this one said the Lord call me and he said with a voice a loud voice made the van that I was driving just go like this he said the Pastor needs to understand that the Sheep are mine they're not his you're Gods brother Dan was put here to care for God's sheep we love that we respect that but you're Gods yes that one has kept me in L these are God's people these are God's sheep I need to treat them that way you need to treat one another that way when we were looking at one of the brothers that was being considered to be the pastor and the musicians could make their way up now it's about done here the Lord spoke to me and said something to me audibly I'm not going to say what it was but it was just for us brothers who were looking to see and exactly what the Lord said came to pass if you'll listen he'll speak if you'll make yourself available he'll speak get to know that in your life how he deals with you and how he speaks with you just like a husband in wife honey is everything okay and she says yes but she's got a different look so then you go what's going on or she'll ask me is everything all right say yes and she goes okay tell me what happened today where that's the way the Lord would Sayes Lord everything is fine but he says okay talk with me tell me what you're going through tell me the battle you're battling with he knows but he wants you to share it with him and he'll answer you amen if you'll sing that again song I have been blessed I thought about singing it then I thought get brother Mike to do it let's do that fifth verse father the verse of mother and father a mother and father nurtured and raised sisters and brother memories made our pastor to lead us the altar to pray Stripes that can heal the blood that still sa I have been blessed oh I have been blessed God so good to me precious are his is thoughts of you and me no way I can count them there's not enough time so I'll just thank him for being so kind God has been good so good I have been blessed he's my shoulder to lean on when I am down the rock where he hides me when I'm overwhelm the place where he hides me under his wings he's not just a song oh he's the reason I sing for I have been blessed let's all stand oh I have been blessed God so good to me precious are his thoughts of you and me no way I can count them there's not enough time so I just thank him for being so kind oh God has been good so good I have been blessed I don't believe it was a coincidence that I preached this morning on the parable of the laborers in the vineyard and how there was the laborers that went out at 6:00 in the morning and they worked all day they labored and after the third hour more came and after the sixth hour more came the ninth hour more came and then the 11th Hour even more came but there were those that labored all day sure their hands were worn their bodies were tired and beat down and I believe that on that glorious day when we go to meet the Lord and he says enter in thou good and faithful servant there will be men like Aaron Gara battle scarred veterans who didn't come in at the 11th Hour battle scarred veterans who have been here from the beginning working in God's Vineyard and doing everything that they can and not complaining just working and brother Aaron is one unlike the ones in the parable this morning brother Aaron is one that he saw others like me come in a little bit later and he's not one that would ever complain and he just has that attitude I want to do something Lord let me continue to serve your people in your Vineyard do you appreciate our brother Aron Gara brother Joe come on up and close brother Joe I have been blessed yes just so one more thing I meant to say it I have officially turned in my retirement
