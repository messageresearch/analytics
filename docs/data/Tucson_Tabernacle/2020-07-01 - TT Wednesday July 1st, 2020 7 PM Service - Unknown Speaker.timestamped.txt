[26:16] am persuaded that he is able to keep
[26:20] that which I've committed to him and by

[26:26] his hands you take your hands off of it
[26:28] Lord I'm gonna help you fix this no no

[33:42] right season to come the monsoons are
[33:46] starting to sound I thank the Lord for
[33:48] that one scripture before we're Cena
[33:52] let's look at 1st Samuel chapter 30
[33:55] verse 6 Thank You musicians god bless
[33:58] you and we've recently heard two
[34:04] different ministers use this scripture
[34:06] but just let me just share it one time
[34:09] and David was greatly distressed for the
[34:12] people speak of stoning him because the
[34:15] soul of the people are grieved every man
[34:18] for his sons and for his daughters but
[34:20] David encouraged himself in the Lord his
[34:24] God so amen David encouraged himself in
[34:28] the Lord that you may be seated
[34:31] just that was not the thought that I had
[34:37] last Saturday it was looking at been
[34:41] listening to the rapture message and
[34:42] thinking about faith and all but today
[34:46] or actually Monday and Tuesday we were
[34:49] up in Phoenix and Queen Creek area
[34:52] working helping up up there and the last
[34:57] three days we drove about 550 miles for
[35:02] approximately eleven jobs I can do that
[35:05] in town at about 50 miles for 11 jobs so
[35:08] I was a little what say no frustrated a
[35:12] little bit and it's a lot of miles for
[35:14] 11 jobs and but today as I was I was
[35:18] driving here in town working in town and
[35:21] I was headed down to the east side of
[35:23] town and felt God just beginning to
[35:26] speak to me and just saying but you
[35:28] don't have a reason to be discouraged
[35:30] you have reason to be encouraged and and
[35:34] he reminded me through all that David
[35:36] went there he encouraged himself in God
[35:40] in the Lord his God now at a god far
[35:44] away a God he heard about someone else
[35:48] told him but a god that he knew and I
[35:51] began to look at then I say Lord you
[35:53] know and I had been looking at brother
[35:56] Branham says faith and faith is a
[35:58] revelation and my heart had leaned
[36:01] towards revelation comes not just
[36:03] because you heard it but because you've
[36:05] experienced it a become God becomes real
[36:09] to you it becomes personal to you not
[36:12] because somebody else told you about him
[36:13] because you've met him yourself
[36:16] so this my heart was come a little bit
[36:18] that way but I just began to encourage
[36:19] myself and the Lord began to encourage
[36:22] me and just say you have no reason to be
[36:24] discouraged um I promised to be with you
[36:28] never leave you I am here I've kept you
[36:30] you know you just you drove 550 miles
[36:33] ago nothing going wrong you know you
[36:35] have other people to suffered this past
[36:38] week or you know but God has been good
[36:40] to us and my wife had her eye surgery on
[36:42] Monday and got a very good report
[36:44] yesterday and
[36:46] and no blood shot in her eyes and all
[36:48] and and you have just she said make sure
[36:49] you thanked the congregation for their
[36:51] prayers I talking to another brother
[36:53] today and they had lost a important
[36:56] document and they were looking to
[36:58] somewhere they never thought they'd find
[37:00] it there it was
[37:01] they were both rejoicing in the Lord God
[37:04] is mindful of us so you know I was
[37:07] encouraging that and I so I got home and
[37:09] I I remembered this scripture and I
[37:11] looked up but David encouraged himself
[37:13] in the Lord his God because you can
[37:16] begin to look around and hear the the
[37:19] complaints or the criticisms or the
[37:21] moaning and groaning or whatever it is
[37:23] of others and it can drag you down you
[37:27] know it can weigh on you and sometimes
[37:29] you see the suffering of others and and
[37:32] you know in whom you have believed in
[37:33] and he's able because he's shown it to
[37:37] you over and over and over but you look
[37:39] at them sometimes and say they have
[37:41] nothing to turn to and sometimes if
[37:45] you're not careful you can stand up in a
[37:47] little self-righteousness and say huh
[37:49] but I have God and you don't but if your
[37:52] heart is right you would say oh that
[37:54] they would know this same God that I've
[37:57] gotten to know oh that they could
[37:58] experience him you know you've heard it
[38:01] many a times and here in the rapture
[38:03] message brother Branham brings that
[38:04] there where he's speaking of the the
[38:06] mother Eagle that had lost that one one
[38:09] egg and she said I knew there was two so
[38:11] she went out searching and this this
[38:13] eagle had been born in the chicken yard
[38:15] and and brother Graham really tells how
[38:18] the eagle was never comfortable there
[38:20] and didn't understand the language and
[38:22] was trying to eat the food and it just
[38:24] wasn't good at all and and mothers is
[38:28] flying around looking for that that
[38:30] other that other eaglet of hers and when
[38:33] she spots him she cries out and
[38:34] something responds oh that sounds right
[38:39] and I don't know how many I have heard
[38:42] say huh I'm an eagle and they're not was
[38:46] such a haughty attitude and today I
[38:49] heard it again and I just said Lord I am
[38:52] an eagle but there was no haughtiness
[38:55] with it just a creep
[38:57] I've been going to thank the Lord that I
[38:59] can't answer to that that I can respond
[39:02] to that then my heart was glad to hear
[39:04] that scream but then my heart began to
[39:07] think of others Lord how about them how
[39:10] about my brother my sister how about my
[39:12] neighbor
[39:13] how about others Lord I don't know if
[39:15] they are not but could they hear it
[39:17] could they respond to it and and so he
[39:20] just began to encourage me and then I I
[39:22] went to Isaiah chapter 41 verses 4
[39:25] through 7 I looked up the word
[39:26] encouraged and it was only used like
[39:29] four times in the scriptures the actual
[39:32] word and Harry says in Isaiah 41 we'll
[39:35] we'll go who hath wrought and done it
[39:39] calling the generations from the
[39:41] beginning his question asking a question
[39:43] he said I the Lord the first and with
[39:46] the last I am he who has who has
[39:49] performed all of this who has done all
[39:51] he says I have he's the only one they
[39:54] can talk like that and be honest about
[39:57] it and not be boasting and being wrong
[40:00] because he is more than able he's proved
[40:03] it the isle saw it and feared the ends
[40:06] of the earth were afraid junior and came
[40:08] all of it realized who he was
[40:13] pennies are there and then he says they
[40:16] helped everyone his neighbor and
[40:19] everyone said to his brother be of good
[40:23] courage now I wasn't looking at the one
[40:26] that David said he encouraged himself
[40:29] but I didn't really didn't know this
[40:32] scripture was there and he says so the
[40:33] carpenter encouraged the Goldsmith and
[40:36] he that smooth it with a hammer him that
[40:39] smote with the anvil and he says saying
[40:42] it is ready for the soldering and he
[40:44] fastened it with nails that it should
[40:46] not be moved he began to say look this
[40:49] one encouraged that one and this one
[40:50] said you're doing your part I'm doing my
[40:52] part we're in this together
[40:54] and they encourage one another so we all
[40:59] kind of have a good idea of what it is
[41:01] to encourage someone hey brother
[41:05] you're almost making it but I'm ahead of
[41:07] you boy that's encouraging in it
[41:10] hey brother I'm faster than you that's
[41:13] why you're back there no I wouldn't call
[41:17] that encouragement you know but but
[41:20] encouragement says to talk and remember
[41:24] our conversation is not just words it's
[41:26] a life you live to talk or behave in a
[41:31] way that gives someone confidence to do
[41:35] something if someone would look at your
[41:40] life your conversation hear the words
[41:43] you speak and say yes I can if God has
[41:47] done it through them he can do it
[41:49] through me and then someone who has met
[41:52] God can say Lord if you've done it for
[41:53] me you can do it for them to encourage
[41:57] to hearten to cheer to buoy up to uplift
[42:01] to inspire to motivate to invigorate to
[42:05] spur on to stir to stir up fire up
[42:09] stimulate revitalize and Boldin fortify
[42:12] to rally there's a lot of ways there to
[42:16] encourage someone you know there's
[42:19] there's light at the end of the tunnel
[42:20] I've been through this tunnel you're
[42:22] going through I've been through this
[42:24] portion of life but there was light and
[42:27] there's light for you too
[42:28] you know now the opposite of that is to
[42:32] discourage to dishearten to dispirit to
[42:38] stand there and say you know I don't
[42:41] know God seems you know the scripture
[42:45] told us that they came to a place where
[42:47] they said he delayeth his coming and
[42:49] they began to live away that was
[42:52] disheartening that was discouraging and
[42:55] sometimes we can if we're not careful we
[42:58] can discourage somebody with our actions
[42:59] and our words but there is so much to be
[43:03] encouraged about to look and say Amen
[43:05] God never fails he said if the Sun rises
[43:11] every morning like it does he said so
[43:14] will I keep my promises and he says you
[43:17] know brother Matt brought it very well
[43:19] and he's talking about when he spoke to
[43:21] us at the beginning
[43:22] and just encouraged us to to to be
[43:25] careful in all and people that said it
[43:28] can't the sickness can't get to us and
[43:30] in this and the other then why would he
[43:32] say I am the lord that healeth all thy
[43:34] diseases because he knew they would come
[43:38] but he had already made a provision for
[43:41] it so you don't have to live in fear you
[43:45] don't have to be afraid you could be
[43:47] like job they say though God slay me yet
[43:49] I'll trust him anyways brother Branham
[43:51] says if I pray for 500 today and all
[43:55] $500 I'm gonna pray for 500 more
[43:57] tomorrow why because God's Word doesn't
[43:59] fail now sometimes we need to encourage
[44:03] ourselves also we need to remind
[44:06] ourselves brother Branham said he's
[44:08] driving down the road on his car and
[44:09] Satan would come and sit in the seat
[44:11] next to him and began to question him
[44:13] what about that and what about this and
[44:16] what about that and if you began to
[44:18] listen to it you'll begin to question it
[44:20] yourself - did he really say that was
[44:24] that really true did know then brother
[44:26] Brown would say ok but then what about
[44:27] this and what about this what about this
[44:30] time what about this instance and Satan
[44:32] would have to give up meleave when he
[44:34] sees he's not going to discourage you
[44:35] but you're gonna turn and just put it
[44:37] right back and he says I'm gonna go find
[44:38] somebody else I can discourage the
[44:41] conversation the life we live the words
[44:43] we speak can encourage and discourage
[44:45] both but he says he encouraged himself
[44:49] in the Lord his God and he's your God
[44:52] he's my god
[44:54] he says they helped everyone his
[44:56] neighbor and everyone said to his
[44:59] brother be of good courage don't look at
[45:05] the symptoms but look at the one and the
[45:08] promise that he gave look at what God
[45:11] said and and I asked you how many know
[45:13] him because you've experienced him
[45:15] how many willing to raise our hand and
[45:17] say yes I've experienced it's not it's
[45:19] not because daddy told me it's not
[45:21] because because the pastor said it's not
[45:24] even because brother but because I've
[45:25] met God myself in my time of trouble and
[45:28] in when I least expected it maybe he
[45:31] came by and he met me you know so
[45:34] look at that and then so so I was
[45:37] looking at and I was encouraging myself
[45:39] and I'd got home early today I was home
[45:44] by about 1:00 o'clock this afternoon so
[45:46] it gave me time to to finish some other
[45:48] work that I had to do and then do a
[45:50] little more studying and and I began to
[45:54] look at some more things here a little
[45:56] bit more of the rapture tape and you
[45:58] know but I did because I got home late
[46:02] yesterday and and I was tired and I told
[46:04] my wife I said I'm a lay down and take a
[46:06] little nap
[46:07] well little can be to somebody this big
[46:11] little could be this big to somebody
[46:12] might it was this big this time fell
[46:15] asleep around 6:30 and I didn't wake up
[46:18] till 4:00 in the morning but it was just
[46:20] a little nap and and so I didn't read
[46:23] the daily strength till this afternoon
[46:28] and I I try to read it every night and
[46:31] just see what is so daily strengthened I
[46:34] don't know how many of you get that but
[46:35] it's he quoted the scripture Philippians
[46:37] 4 9 so if we could pull up I didn't give
[46:40] you this one but if we could pull up
[46:42] Felipa philippians 4 9 and this is paul
[46:47] speaking in it if it's so perfect with
[46:50] what what would have been my heart those
[46:52] things which he have both learned and
[46:54] received and heard and seen in me do and
[46:58] the God of peace shall be with you now
[47:02] that's not speaking of me that's Paul
[47:05] speaking here as the first age messenger
[47:07] he's telling those things which you have
[47:09] both learned and how do you learn by
[47:11] experience in it by being around it we
[47:14] can all have a teacher in the school and
[47:16] in class that we did some book learning
[47:17] but the best experience is when you
[47:19] start doing it yourself that's how you
[47:21] really learn how to do it Jesus and
[47:23] received you have to receive it you have
[47:26] to say Amen to it and you've heard with
[47:29] the years going down to your heart
[47:31] becoming a revelation and you've also
[47:32] seen it in those around you whether it's
[47:36] your husband your wife your mother your
[47:38] father a minister a friend whatever
[47:40] you've seen God work you've seen it in
[47:44] yourself do
[47:47] he says put it into practice all right
[47:51] so let's just read how he put it all all
[47:54] the disciples had a courage about them
[47:57] to do the work they were called to do
[47:59] they had all sense of urgency because
[48:01] they had witnessed with their eyes the
[48:05] Savior and had been in my heart not just
[48:07] seeing somebody but being part of it
[48:10] experiencing it yourself Paul was one
[48:14] although he'd never been with Jesus as a
[48:16] disciples till he had witnessed many
[48:18] events that were going on at the time he
[48:21] had an anointing to do the things which
[48:23] had to be done to live for the Lord to
[48:26] preach to pray to spread the good news
[48:28] and to endure hardships so that comes
[48:32] with the package that comes as brother
[48:34] grain used to say with the benefits
[48:36] package you will endure hardships
[48:39] because the other way if there's nothing
[48:41] hard you will never grow you will never
[48:43] mature you know so you go through some
[48:46] testing but when he writes when he
[48:49] writes to the Philip it Philippians he
[48:50] says sure I do all these things but make
[48:54] sure that you do them also a teacher is
[48:58] teaching you so that you can participate
[49:00] so that you can that you can go out and
[49:03] do it you know why go to class if you're
[49:06] not going to if you're going to become
[49:08] go to school for a specific sister Holly
[49:11] there in medical go to whatever amount
[49:14] of time it was but with no plans to go
[49:16] on to medical field then why go to class
[49:18] but you go with that intention to learn
[49:21] but to put what you've learned into
[49:23] practice you know and so he says do them
[49:27] also when he writes the word do which in
[49:30] the Greek is I think you say press it
[49:32] which is where we get our English to
[49:35] practice it literally means just do to
[49:38] go out and practice put it into use how
[49:42] do you learn by doing it and doing it
[49:45] doing it those that those of you that
[49:47] have done whatever your trade is brother
[49:50] Merle and them with the sight of the
[49:54] family there that did all the sheetrock
[49:55] and the finishing I watched some of
[49:58] those guys in the house and they make it
[49:59] look so easy
[50:00] and then I go try to do it and it
[50:03] doesn't come out the same because that's
[50:05] not what I do but they do them watching
[50:08] them the boys if they come in and have
[50:09] to do a repair on a patch job and they
[50:11] blend it right in to look like it was
[50:13] part of the job in the first place but
[50:16] they have years of practice doing it and
[50:18] that's a as a Christian you might see
[50:20] somebody saying boy they seem to well
[50:22] they've done it a time or two or ten or
[50:24] 100 and the same with you you put these
[50:27] things that you have learned into
[50:29] practice into daily doing he's telling
[50:31] us here thus we have the old phrase
[50:34] practice makes perfect when you practice
[50:36] you have to have two things an
[50:39] understanding of what you are practicing
[50:41] and a goal practice practice practice to
[50:45] achieve nothing
[50:46] no you practice because you have an
[50:49] expectation a place you want to get to
[50:52] you want to get to that place where you
[50:54] hear well done thou good and faithful
[50:56] servant so what do you you put those
[51:00] things you have learned into practice
[51:01] you begin to do those things he says our
[51:06] understanding should be the image of
[51:09] Christ that should be our goal not to
[51:13] make our name known well known in the
[51:15] message not to make our name well known
[51:17] in this world but to be like Christ
[51:19] that's it that is our the image before
[51:23] us we see we see that very clearly we
[51:26] should press towards that what we see
[51:29] the mark of your high calling our goal
[51:31] should be to attain perfection now we
[51:35] heard last Sunday perfection being
[51:37] perfect the most frustrating part we
[51:40] have is the this part that we wear that
[51:43] we inhabit because that's the one we
[51:45] want to see perfect I'm waiting for this
[51:49] outer man to become perfect have no
[51:52] flaws no faults never get upset never
[51:56] get mad
[51:57] always smiling never it hasn't happened
[52:01] yet it hasn't happened to any single
[52:03] human Adam and Eve were creative God and
[52:07] they fell now we know God caused it
[52:09] allowed that to express but therefore
[52:12] each after I said you shall die
[52:15] so this outer man and brother Matt laid
[52:18] it out very well he's looking for a
[52:21] heart an attitude of a person they would
[52:25] say like David a man after God's own
[52:28] heart so but does that mean while I
[52:32] could care less what the flesh looks
[52:33] like no we want to bring it into
[52:35] subjection we want to harness it under
[52:38] as much as we can - what - God's will is
[52:41] he tells us how we should act he tells
[52:44] us what spirit we should be if he tells
[52:46] us what attitude we should take he tells
[52:49] us how to dress he tells us men how to
[52:51] act and and sisters how to act in
[52:53] everything and and that's what we strive
[52:57] for
[52:58] you know it if we would look just like
[53:01] everybody else in the world nobody would
[53:03] know we're a Christian there is a mark
[53:05] of a Christian there there is a way a
[53:08] Christian carries himself and God himmat
[53:12] but he knows that you can't do it by
[53:13] herself but he can do it through you and
[53:17] that is where you you're learning to
[53:20] walk this life with him guiding you with
[53:23] him leading you so he says we look we
[53:26] put Christ as our goal and when you put
[53:28] that before you that's what you're
[53:30] walking towards that's what your aim is
[53:32] not I remember back as a young man
[53:37] probably 14 or 15 years old right before
[53:40] the message game or right about that
[53:42] time the church we had gone till had
[53:46] believed that you had to speak in
[53:47] tongues in order to a to - received the
[53:51] Holy Spirit that was the evidence of the
[53:52] Holy Ghost speaking in tongues and and
[53:56] it was one of those things that they did
[53:58] it they put fear in you
[53:59] if you didn't speak in tongues you're
[54:01] going to help you know and so they had a
[54:06] minister come through through the church
[54:08] and and he was well known as a brother
[54:11] who could help you speak in tongues so I
[54:14] went up to the altar because I had not
[54:17] spoken in tongues so I listened to the
[54:20] man as he's praying over me and he's
[54:22] teaching you how to speak in tongues
[54:25] he's China so I learned
[54:27] quickly that if I just did that I'd have
[54:31] the tongue I'd have the Holy Ghost so I
[54:34] just mutter to feel those words and he
[54:36] said he's got it he's got it yet I knew
[54:38] I didn't get anything but to to say he
[54:43] got it so they everybody would be happy
[54:44] about it I did it now it's nothing to
[54:50] brag about but it's what happened I
[54:53] remember coming home from school
[54:57] and-and-and wondering if I don't find
[54:59] mom at home now I knew dad was working
[55:01] but mom was always home if I didn't find
[55:05] mom at home did the rapture take place
[55:07] already I don't know if anybody else
[55:10] went through that but I went through a
[55:11] stage in my life if mom wasn't home the
[55:15] rapture might have taken place I better
[55:17] find out because dad was working okay
[55:20] it's funny now but it wasn't funny when
[55:23] you're 12 14 years old and you believe
[55:26] there's going to be a rapture and you
[55:27] know you're not ready to go so you're
[55:31] looking for it you're pressing for it
[55:34] you're trying to find it everything but
[55:37] Paul tells us stay with what the Word of
[55:39] God says and that's what you press
[55:41] towards that's what you keep you keep
[55:43] Christ in front of you the st. church
[55:46] that we belong to then later on they
[55:49] were they were and I was just before we
[55:51] came the message was coming just before
[55:53] we came one of the the young men he was
[55:56] president of the the youth of that
[55:58] section of the California we lived in
[56:01] and they were going around and they had
[56:03] these SOS packages stood for save one
[56:06] soul and he was trying to get my
[56:09] brothers four years older so there was
[56:11] more addressed to him trying to get him
[56:13] to buy one I don't remember what the
[56:14] cost was and it came with some tracks
[56:17] and a little bit so my I remember my
[56:19] brother asked him do I really have to
[56:21] have one of these to save us all and
[56:24] finally goes no but if I sell the most I
[56:27] get to go on a trip to Hawaii
[56:31] me as a young man said oh my god really
[56:34] is this what we have come to selling
[56:37] salvation putting a different picture up
[56:43] front I'm not looking for a trip to
[56:46] Hawaii I'm looking to go home I'm
[56:48] looking for a change of this mortal to
[56:50] immortality where I don't have to deal
[56:53] with this guy anymore he's the one that
[56:55] gives me most of my problems if not all
[56:57] of them but here we have a goal set and
[57:00] we're going to practice or we're going
[57:02] to continue to do or we're going to what
[57:05] do they say practice makes perfect
[57:07] well you got a practice right you can
[57:09] practice the wrong thing but you can
[57:11] practice that which is right he says our
[57:13] understanding is the image of Christ we
[57:16] see very clearly that what we should
[57:18] press toward the mark of the high
[57:20] calling our goal should not to be to
[57:23] attain perfection but our goal should be
[57:26] complete surrender so he can perform the
[57:31] work because you can't do it on your own
[57:34] okay we had we must put these things we
[57:38] have learned seen and heard into
[57:41] practice part of our daily living and
[57:44] sometimes I find myself and like like
[57:46] today the Lord is just speaking to my
[57:48] heart and I was rejoicing driving down
[57:51] the road and I'm saying Lord how come I
[57:53] just can't be like this all the time and
[57:56] I think he said well I it can be like
[57:59] that with me all the time what about you
[58:01] it's not him it's it's me you know so
[58:07] later on and in the evening or late
[58:08] afternoon I was I was getting had gotten
[58:11] everything and I sent the brothers the
[58:12] the information so that they they could
[58:14] post it and all and and I was just kind
[58:17] of laid back and again he just began to
[58:19] encourage my heart laying there in the
[58:21] bed and I was trying to rest and I'm
[58:23] saying man I just feel like jumping up
[58:25] and shouting her right now so I I put on
[58:28] more of the rapture tape and even more
[58:30] and I got up and I took my wife goes are
[58:32] you gonna get ready to go to church now
[58:34] I said no it's a little early is about
[58:35] three hours still but I just can't slow
[58:37] down it's burning in my heart you know
[58:40] just I want that Lord and and so he's
[58:44] just I'm put
[58:45] things into practice when someone sets
[58:47] out to play an instrument regardless how
[58:49] talented they may be or gifted they
[58:52] don't have a mastery level the first
[58:54] time they play it it takes some learning
[58:57] it takes some repetition it takes a lot
[59:01] of wednesdays in a lot of Sunday's and
[59:03] it just for the musicians to work you
[59:06] know sometimes it seemed like musicians
[59:07] can come up just sit down and everybody
[59:08] play but you don't know the hours spent
[59:10] behind it sometimes to get to that point
[59:13] you know there's a the potential is
[59:16] there but they simply have not practiced
[59:18] to bring out the potential it's the same
[59:20] way with a Christian walk we must put
[59:22] what we hear what we see what we know
[59:25] into practice you you know who you want
[59:27] to be like so practicing and surrender
[59:30] constantly and constantly watch the
[59:35] potential already inside of you come out
[59:38] and that's the best part it's in you
[59:41] already brother branham in the rapture
[59:44] tape as his ministering he begins
[59:46] talking about the seed and he says Billy
[59:49] Paul was in me already but I didn't know
[59:52] that and Billy Paul didn't know that but
[59:54] God did and he begins that time for
[59:58] Billy Paul became to be born and you're
[1:00:01] typing that to a spiritual life you were
[1:00:04] part of God you had to be part of God
[1:00:07] for eternal life it's it's Scripture you
[1:00:12] know that God has made it clear to us
[1:00:14] you know some people talk about it being
[1:00:16] on the back part of back side of God's
[1:00:18] mind wherever it is that's okay you were
[1:00:20] there he knew you by name already who
[1:00:23] knew who you were just like that mother
[1:00:27] Eagles saying there's one more I've got
[1:00:28] to go call that one I don't know when
[1:00:31] that last one's coming in but God has
[1:00:33] every one of his children so here we are
[1:00:35] where we want to be like Jesus there's a
[1:00:40] lot of work that goes to be there it's a
[1:00:43] lot of yielding a lot of surrendering a
[1:00:46] lot of times to say not my will but
[1:00:50] because a lot of times our will is what
[1:00:53] gets us in trouble
[1:00:54] lord help me to say you lord you first
[1:00:57] in all things yeah so then practice
[1:01:01] makes perfect but make sure you're
[1:01:03] practicing that which you you wanta with
[1:01:06] that target you know if you practice the
[1:01:10] song wrong the whole time well you're
[1:01:12] gonna do it wrong sister good speed was
[1:01:16] probably probably the only piano player
[1:01:18] that I ever played with who would stop
[1:01:20] in the middle of the song and tell me it
[1:01:22] doesn't go that way nobody else ever did
[1:01:26] that to me but she played it by note and
[1:01:28] she played it the way it went and if I
[1:01:30] very hated she would stop or very just
[1:01:32] change it she'd go it doesn't go that
[1:01:34] way when we went to Indiana and got to
[1:01:37] spend some time with Loras and Karen
[1:01:39] Ralph why I took my saxophone he had
[1:01:41] asked me and he had and he wrote up the
[1:01:43] music we were going to play a duet and
[1:01:46] it been years since I read read music
[1:01:48] and after about four tries he said
[1:01:51] forget it you pick a song and I'll play
[1:01:53] the piano and you just play it because
[1:01:55] he had it all laid out and I couldn't do
[1:01:57] it I hadn't done it for years I'm glad
[1:02:00] that he has mercy on us and he'll say
[1:02:04] I'll help you live it all live in you to
[1:02:06] do it brother Branham says that don't
[1:02:10] mean perfection in yourself you can't be
[1:02:13] then but you see even our people are
[1:02:15] getting away from the practice of
[1:02:17] holiness there's something you can
[1:02:19] practice Lord is this is this righteous
[1:02:22] before you is this holy before you is
[1:02:25] this something that would cause you to
[1:02:27] flee to to have that brother bounce that
[1:02:30] Holy Spirit just light off a little bit
[1:02:31] on the branch up there he's telling us
[1:02:34] you know practice to make yourself oh no
[1:02:37] holy no practicing what got us so that
[1:02:39] he can do that in you the the Pharisees
[1:02:43] and the Sadducees had practiced sit down
[1:02:44] to a tee how many steps to take what to
[1:02:48] wear what not to her but God looked at
[1:02:49] their heart and said your heart is a
[1:02:50] long ways from what you're doing do this
[1:02:54] part Lord and then this
[1:02:56] becoming into subjection to what God
[1:02:58] isn't and you know a husband and wife
[1:03:01] for us it'll be 41 years come in in the
[1:03:06] sixth I think next Monday there's a lot
[1:03:09] of learning there's a lot of work that
[1:03:11] goes in there's a lot of times when I
[1:03:12] say yes dear a lot of times when she
[1:03:16] says whatever you want and sometimes we
[1:03:18] don't like it because neither one will
[1:03:20] make the decision but you're both trying
[1:03:22] to yeah but there's a lot of work that
[1:03:24] goes into it why because that that's how
[1:03:28] you learn that's how you bring it didn't
[1:03:31] take God five minutes to get the whole
[1:03:34] plan done this plan has been working on
[1:03:37] in our time time and time all the way to
[1:03:42] Calvary from when he spoke it from
[1:03:45] before the foundation of the world he
[1:03:47] said he was bruised he was wounded he
[1:03:49] was slain God had a time God had a plane
[1:03:54] when he said a plan when he said this is
[1:03:57] my beloved son hear ye him there was a
[1:04:01] testing a probing time for Jesus to get
[1:04:03] to you and I the same way brother
[1:04:07] Branham says to practice holiness we
[1:04:10] began to let down so many bars see and
[1:04:14] and we get to come to that place we got
[1:04:17] to come to that place of our profession
[1:04:19] he is our example and he is our sin
[1:04:23] bearer and then if we profess that he is
[1:04:26] our peacemaker
[1:04:27] he is our propitiation then if we
[1:04:30] profess that then that is supposed to
[1:04:33] reflect him back in us I'm a Christian
[1:04:38] any more Christians here who are you
[1:04:42] saying you're reflecting Christ that's
[1:04:46] who's the wish to be reflected in us Oh
[1:04:48] Dave the Saint doesn't like that you're
[1:04:51] not going to be well loved and liked by
[1:04:53] everybody but it's who we are
[1:04:58] and we are a written epistle a
[1:05:01] lookingglass that people can see Christ
[1:05:05] in us and now if they don't then we're
[1:05:09] looking at something else we've got the
[1:05:12] wrong reflection and we're looking we're
[1:05:16] not looking to him look to him all the
[1:05:19] ends of the world and I said lord I
[1:05:23] don't probably don't even have to preach
[1:05:24] I think that all just about do it well I
[1:05:28] know what God was speaking in my heart
[1:05:30] what do you tell him you know just he
[1:05:32] was just encouraging me especially after
[1:05:34] brother man that was Joe something they
[1:05:35] helped me because I want this guy to be
[1:05:37] perfect I want him not to cause any
[1:05:40] troubles anymore I want him not to be
[1:05:42] drawn away at times but he's flesh man
[1:05:45] on the outside but I want the heart more
[1:05:49] than this guy I want the heart like
[1:05:51] David had a man after God's own heart
[1:05:54] willing to say I'm sorry when I'm wrong
[1:05:57] willing to repent willing to have some
[1:06:00] mercy and grace on others like Jesus
[1:06:04] when he walked and they brought that
[1:06:05] woman that woman that had been caught in
[1:06:08] adultery and they brought her and cast
[1:06:10] him at his feet here there some that
[1:06:14] righteous holy son of God is standing
[1:06:17] there no sin nothing about him and they
[1:06:19] throw an ill-favored woman
[1:06:22] and he looks at her he looks down to
[1:06:25] sand and he's writing and the
[1:06:27] self-righteous men that brought him are
[1:06:29] standing there say the law says to stone
[1:06:32] her to death and I don't know what he
[1:06:37] was writing different people have said
[1:06:39] he probably was writing this heap I
[1:06:40] don't know I don't profess to know but
[1:06:43] whatever he wrote had a meaning I don't
[1:06:46] think he was drawing cartoons on the
[1:06:48] ground or just whatever something was
[1:06:50] written there and then he just turns out
[1:06:53] he looks at with a simple answer okay
[1:06:55] they knew that our perfect cast the
[1:06:57] first stone
[1:07:00] because that's how they brought her the
[1:07:04] word has to be obeyed perfectly you've
[1:07:07] got to be just like this you got to be
[1:07:10] just like that and who can do it so he
[1:07:13] says you're judging that way cast the
[1:07:16] first stone they begin to look at
[1:07:18] themselves and they begin to turn and
[1:07:21] walk away because not a one of them was
[1:07:24] perfect and God looks at her and says
[1:07:28] are thine accusers and I know maybe at
[1:07:33] that point she hadn't turned and looked
[1:07:34] around yet she turns around and it goes
[1:07:36] they're gone
[1:07:37] and he says neither do i condemn thee
[1:07:41] but then he tells her go and sin no more
[1:07:47] he didn't condemn her but he didn't tell
[1:07:49] her go back and live that same life he
[1:07:51] said go and send more go and disbelieve
[1:07:54] God's word no more God is more than able
[1:07:59] encourage yourself in the Word of God
[1:08:03] because it's true its faithful by the
[1:08:07] Word of God these world the world was
[1:08:08] created and it's exactly like you said
[1:08:12] the Sun will rise and the Sun will set
[1:08:14] brother Lyle you know you I don't know
[1:08:17] how much you were involved but I know
[1:08:18] some of the things you did went up in
[1:08:19] some of the Rockets everything is
[1:08:21] precise right you couldn't be off by and
[1:08:24] that's close enough and to be very
[1:08:26] precise they know when the sun's going
[1:08:29] to rise when it's going to was gonna set
[1:08:30] why because God's laws are perfect not
[1:08:34] because the scientists figured out would
[1:08:35] they begin to study and say hey it comes
[1:08:38] up and in the rotating because God said
[1:08:40] it in motion I've always said if you're
[1:08:44] having trouble in school you're in
[1:08:46] school and you're having trouble with
[1:08:47] the subject he's really good at
[1:08:50] languages he knows them all he's really
[1:08:54] good at math because he said all the
[1:08:56] laws in order he knows all about history
[1:08:59] he laid it all out why not ask him you
[1:09:04] have not because you ask not well why
[1:09:07] would God be interested in that little
[1:09:08] boy he's interested in all for his
[1:09:11] children
[1:09:11] Abraham I mean Adam how was your day
[1:09:14] today oh it was wonderful it was this it
[1:09:17] goes how do was this he's talking with
[1:09:19] his children
[1:09:20] you know what we'd have a little bit
[1:09:22] about it when the girls were young and
[1:09:23] all the girls played violin and stringed
[1:09:27] instruments and in elementary school and
[1:09:29] they all started with the same songs
[1:09:32] can-can and mary had a little lamb and
[1:09:34] all the ones they start you with so
[1:09:37] every year the you know Naomi first and
[1:09:40] then Elizabeth and then Sarah and we
[1:09:44] would go to the concert and we knew what
[1:09:45] songs we were gonna hear same ones we
[1:09:48] heard last year the same ones we heard
[1:09:50] the year before they didn't change and
[1:09:53] as a dad and mom you had to be just as
[1:09:55] thrilled and just exciting just as happy
[1:09:57] for him even though it was a sixth one
[1:09:59] oh boy
[1:10:02] you learned how to play mary had a
[1:10:03] little lamb play it for me I've never
[1:10:05] heard it before and I were the big
[1:10:07] cheesy smile on your face that was part
[1:10:10] of it when I don't want this come around
[1:10:16] but God likes that justice really he
[1:10:22] knows all about it but he wants to hear
[1:10:25] from you he wants to know what your
[1:10:28] heart he wants you to verbalize he want
[1:10:30] you to say lord I trust you lord i love
[1:10:32] you lord i want to know you personally

[1:10:42] part of that rapture experience i want
[1:10:45] that to be part of my life i want to
[1:10:47] encourage myself with the word of god
[1:10:50] you know an aim and today i was i was as

[1:11:39] us and a good loud Amen might wake me up

[1:12:10] let's just get into a little bit we got
[1:12:12] a little bit of time do we brother Mauro
[1:12:17] just you know I don't even know what
[1:12:19] time it is yeah we got a little bit time
[1:12:22] let's go to Hebrews chapter 11 and verse
[1:12:29] verse 1 I believe it is now faith is the
[1:12:35] substance of things hoped for the
[1:12:38] evidence of things not seen
[1:12:40] faith it's a substance it's got a
[1:12:44] reality it's it's tangible I know I have
[1:12:48] felt his presence I know he is real I
[1:12:51] know that when he is here you know he's
[1:12:54] easier he has spoken to me in an audible
[1:12:58] voice he's gotten my attention by
[1:13:01] reaching out and getting my attention I
[1:13:03] know he's real he's the same yesterday
[1:13:06] today and forever I laid in my bed one
[1:13:09] day getting ready to minister some years
[1:13:11] back and I was laying in bed resting
[1:13:14] maybe around 4 o'clock the after and
[1:13:16] just just laying there getting off after
[1:13:17] work just resting before service that
[1:13:19] night and his presence came down and
[1:13:21] physically began to bless me I know he's
[1:13:25] real I watched a healing sitting right
[1:13:29] back in that corner i watch a young lady
[1:13:30] and receiver Healy
[1:13:33] should happen God he's the same
[1:13:36] yesterday today and forever
[1:13:38] it's it's a something it's not an
[1:13:41] imagination something far away it's
[1:13:43] something you can have realize and and
[1:13:46] taste-off participate in Hebrews 11:6
[1:13:52] both without faith it's impossible to
[1:13:56] please them that's the thing without
[1:14:01] faith brother Lord I've dressed to the T
[1:14:04] Lord I've never missed a service Lord
[1:14:07] I've paid my tithe all the time Lord
[1:14:10] I've done all this and he says but
[1:14:12] where's your faith is he going to find
[1:14:17] faith it's what he said when he comes is
[1:14:21] there gonna be a people that are gonna
[1:14:23] take him at his word and stand on it are
[1:14:25] there is there gonna be a people they're
[1:14:26] gonna believe is enough as word to
[1:14:28] become the Living Word taking them by
[1:14:31] faith without faith it's impossible to
[1:14:33] please him for he that cometh to God
[1:14:36] must believe that he is he must believe
[1:14:38] that there is a God that he's real that
[1:14:42] he changes not that he hears an answers
[1:14:45] prayer that he'll walk with you he'll go
[1:14:48] with you he'll sit in the car with you
[1:14:51] and talk to you because he's done it has
[1:14:55] anybody ever experienced where he's
[1:14:56] sitting in the corn talking to you he
[1:14:59] has to me in an audible voice because I
[1:15:02] especially know because he chose to talk
[1:15:04] to me and I appreciate it very much when
[1:15:08] he does that but you know sometimes
[1:15:10] he'll use your brother and your sisters
[1:15:11] voice and it's God too
[1:15:15] we just got to be willing to listen you
[1:15:19] must believe that he is he's not a
[1:15:21] figment of somebody's about to hear is a
[1:15:30] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:15:33] Him they're here on Sunday morning in
[1:15:36] service and the rest of the week I'm not
[1:15:40] sure where they're at I think that's
[1:15:42] what diligently means
[1:15:45] did I miss the interpretation there may
[1:15:47] be diligence somebody is seeking
[1:15:50] somebody's looking somebody's spending a
[1:15:52] lot of time come back to that I still
[1:15:58] World War two history really I really
[1:16:02] liked World War two history I don't know
[1:16:04] why but he did and and I would read some
[1:16:06] of the story some of the things the time
[1:16:08] spent and the amount of time spent to
[1:16:11] develop the things that today we would
[1:16:14] look back and say wow that's so ancient
[1:16:16] but at that time it was right up front
[1:16:19] it was the latest it was the the best
[1:16:21] and they could the men could spend hours
[1:16:24] staring at a chalkboard because one
[1:16:26] thing was wrong in there they knew
[1:16:28] because the equation wasn't working when
[1:16:32] when they were developing the atomic
[1:16:33] bomb and the chalkboards were as big as
[1:16:36] each one of those and just full of all
[1:16:38] the equations and he's standing there
[1:16:40] and I don't remember which which man it
[1:16:43] was but he stand there looking because
[1:16:44] something was wrong
[1:16:46] took him three days to find it if I
[1:16:48] remember right he walks and he said up
[1:16:50] switches it and then there it worked
[1:16:54] diligent not giving up the time when
[1:16:59] there's time you're there and sometimes
[1:17:00] you got to work but that doesn't mean
[1:17:02] that what you're working he can't be
[1:17:03] around you you can keep a good spirit a
[1:17:06] good attitude you can have a praise in
[1:17:08] your lips you can be singing a song you
[1:17:10] can be thinking about him and that's
[1:17:13] part of it you must you must be and
[1:17:16] believe that he is a rewarder that in
[1:17:17] other words in this you're going to get
[1:17:19] to spend time with him you're going to
[1:17:21] get to know him you're going to get to
[1:17:22] fellowship with him he's going to speak
[1:17:24] to you and you're going to be able to
[1:17:26] answer back and then in in Hebrews 12:2
[1:17:33] looking unto Jesus the author and
[1:17:35] finisher of our faith he gave it to you
[1:17:40] he will also help you finish it up he
[1:17:42] says who for the joy that was set before
[1:17:45] him endured the cross despising the
[1:17:48] shame and is set down at the right hand
[1:17:50] of the
[1:17:51] throne of God he's the author and the
[1:17:54] finisher he started he finish or he who
[1:17:57] began the good work in you will perform
[1:17:59] it you must believe it when things don't
[1:18:04] look like they're going that way when
[1:18:05] things seem to be spinning backwards
[1:18:06] when you seem to be sliding back down
[1:18:08] the hill instead of climbing he says no
[1:18:10] you are good I have seen you already on
[1:18:12] this side lord help my vision to look
[1:18:16] that way
[1:18:17] lord have you seen me then I know that I
[1:18:20] will be there my job said though God
[1:18:23] slay me yet all trust romans 1:16 and 17
[1:18:32] for i am not ashamed of the gospel of
[1:18:35] Christ for it is the power of God unto
[1:18:38] salvation to every one that believeth to
[1:18:41] the Jew first and then to the Greek for
[1:18:46] therein is the righteousness of God
[1:18:48] revealed from faith to faith as it is
[1:18:50] written the just shall live by faith
[1:18:55] because everything that we're doing
[1:18:58] we're not fighting against flesh and
[1:18:59] blood yes and you're not against your
[1:19:02] brother again you're not against your
[1:19:03] neighbour you're not against the
[1:19:04] Methodists or that church or this church
[1:19:06] or whatever we get we're against
[1:19:09] something that is deceptive something
[1:19:12] that you can't see with the physical eye
[1:19:14] he said but you got to live by faith and
[1:19:18] faith brother Graham said is a
[1:19:20] revelation the simplest explanation to
[1:19:25] me is revelation is something being made
[1:19:27] now something revealing you know if I
[1:19:32] had maybe something to show with a put a
[1:19:35] put something over that speaker and I'm
[1:19:37] gonna reveal it I'm just gonna remove
[1:19:38] the cover the speaker was there because
[1:19:42] I removed the cover didn't make a
[1:19:44] speaker the speaker was there it was
[1:19:46] covered God's Word is eternal it has
[1:19:52] always been there brother Bram talked
[1:19:55] about it in the heavens he talked about
[1:19:57] it written he talked about a Living Word
[1:20:00] okay but not all of it had been
[1:20:04] no and it had its time and he says you
[1:20:07] will live if I could say this by faith
[1:20:08] you will live by revelation God begins
[1:20:12] to unveil it to you God begins to make
[1:20:14] it real to you when you begin to walk in
[1:20:16] that will walk in the light what is
[1:20:19] light do it unveils it reveals it shows
[1:20:22] turn off all the lights completely right
[1:20:25] here and how many would jump out of the
[1:20:26] out of your chair and just take off
[1:20:28] running down the center aisle here
[1:20:30] hey this you know the center aisle is
[1:20:32] there right it's not going anywhere but
[1:20:35] most of us would not get up out of a
[1:20:37] chair take I've run into foot it just
[1:20:38] got pitch dark in here but turn the
[1:20:42] lights on and reveal Center wait have no
[1:20:44] problem walking down the middle of it
[1:20:46] when God begins to reveal it unveil it
[1:20:49] to show you can walk right down in it
[1:20:52] it's not a hidden mystery anymore it's
[1:20:55] not a guess at it but it's God making it
[1:20:57] richer
[1:20:58] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:20:59] and forever amen
[1:21:02] he's the one that heals all my diseases
[1:21:04] amen how because I've experienced it
[1:21:06] because I know it to be I tell you that
[1:21:10] the our old landlord when we first
[1:21:12] bought the mobile home and on a piece of
[1:21:14] property and and any saw my girls
[1:21:16] dressed as young girls with her dress
[1:21:18] and their hair combed it all and in
[1:21:20] living on the other half of the land was
[1:21:23] another family and they were living in a
[1:21:26] little RV that they put together and
[1:21:28] their kids looked a little different
[1:21:29] than my kids they were usually running
[1:21:31] around in their diapers outside and
[1:21:33] Thanks so he questioned and he asked me
[1:21:35] said where do you go to church why would
[1:21:40] he think we went to church because we
[1:21:43] look like Christians maybe kind of
[1:21:46] stranger that he would get that idea but
[1:21:49] he said what church you go to
[1:21:50] I told him the name of the church attend
[1:21:52] we are attending the Spanish Tabernacle
[1:21:54] then and he said really what do you
[1:21:56] believe I said that Jesus Christ is the
[1:21:58] same yesterday today and forever gives
[1:21:59] me a little strange look like what do
[1:22:00] you mean by that he's still a healer
[1:22:03] he's still oh no no no no no just
[1:22:07] literally stopped me right there I say I
[1:22:10] don't know how old he was he's probably
[1:22:11] in 60s or so no sir no sir
[1:22:13] all that ended with the apostle's
[1:22:16] that was the end of that and I said no
[1:22:18] sir he still Hills he and then began to
[1:22:20] share thinking he goes no no you've been
[1:22:22] deceived I'm thinking no I think it
[1:22:26] might be the other way around
[1:22:27] you know and so being and what's the
[1:22:29] name of your church so I told him oh no
[1:22:31] no there's a courtney of the scripture
[1:22:33] your church can only be doing this and
[1:22:35] they brought a scripture first and he
[1:22:36] began tell me how deceived i was and i
[1:22:39] finally all i could answer him was sir
[1:22:41] you've come a little too late to tell me
[1:22:43] that he's not the same yesterday today
[1:22:46] and forever because i've met him myself
[1:22:52] we must believe that he is and a
[1:22:55] rewarder of those and he says from faith
[1:22:59] to faith from revelation to revelation
[1:23:03] as God begins to unveil himself more and
[1:23:06] more to you he's not only my provider
[1:23:09] he's not only my healer he's also my
[1:23:12] friend he's also my comforter he's the
[1:23:17] one that supplies my every need
[1:23:19] he's my peace when there's distress on
[1:23:21] him he's my water when I'm thirsty he's
[1:23:23] my food when I'm hungry he begins to
[1:23:25] unveil all brother Brown says word upon
[1:23:28] word upon word and he begins to make
[1:23:31] himself known and I like this as we
[1:23:38] would go to Matthew chapter 8 in a this
[1:23:42] was the one that I thought of because
[1:23:45] here's a man who's a Roman a Roman
[1:23:49] centurion
[1:23:49] and there's nothing there that says that
[1:23:52] he was a Christian a believer but
[1:23:56] obviously he knew enough about Jesus had
[1:23:59] heard enough or seen enough and when
[1:24:02] Jesus was entered into Capernaum there
[1:24:04] came unto him a centurion beseech him
[1:24:06] that's a Roman soldier who was ahead of
[1:24:09] a hundred men i capped him a hundred men
[1:24:11] and asking him saying Lord my servant
[1:24:14] life at home sick of the palsy and he's
[1:24:16] grievously tormented and Jesus said I
[1:24:20] will come and heal him
[1:24:21] God was no respecter of persons he said
[1:24:25] and say now wait a minute wait a minute
[1:24:26] let me give you a test do you believe
[1:24:29] all of this do you
[1:24:30] no he just okay I'll come the Centurion
[1:24:35] sir said lord I am not worthy that thou
[1:24:37] should has come under my roof but Speak
[1:24:40] the word only and my servant shall be
[1:24:42] healed
[1:24:43] something tells me that this soldier had
[1:24:46] heard something or seen something
[1:24:47] already somebody had told him or he saw
[1:24:51] it himself I don't know for I am a man
[1:24:54] under Authority and then having soldiers
[1:24:57] under me I say unto this man go and he
[1:25:00] goeth and to another come and he cometh
[1:25:02] and to my servant do this and he does it
[1:25:04] first of all he says I'm a man in
[1:25:06] authority and I know what Authority is I
[1:25:08] have to answer to somebody - like these
[1:25:10] have to answer to me I'm told by my
[1:25:13] superior to do this and then I'm told
[1:25:15] those under me to do that he recognized
[1:25:19] God's position and when Jesus heard it
[1:25:25] he marvelled and said to them that
[1:25:27] followed verily I say unto you I have
[1:25:30] not found so great a faith no not in
[1:25:34] Israel it caught his attention I said
[1:25:40] this faith he understands my authority
[1:25:44] over that spirit he Anders my
[1:25:47] understands my position I'm over at the
[1:25:50] top of that I tell it to go and where it
[1:25:52] should and who do come in and he said
[1:25:55] just like that it works just say and it
[1:25:57] caught God's attention it stopped him on
[1:26:01] his tracks I could say and said Wow
[1:26:03] I have not found faith like this he says
[1:26:07] no not even amongst the Jewish my
[1:26:09] brother he's the same yesterday today
[1:26:11] and forever your faith can reach out and
[1:26:14] stop him on his tracks if I could say it
[1:26:17] that way in turn and he says Amen I'm
[1:26:19] responding here's one that knows and he
[1:26:22] knows that I'm a reward of them that
[1:26:24] call upon me he was marveled at it he it
[1:26:27] was amazing he had come looking for that
[1:26:31] mark 11 22 and 23 and Jesus answering
[1:26:37] saith unto them have faith in God and
[1:26:40] another translation says have the faith
[1:26:42] of God
[1:26:44] if it's God in you you should be able to
[1:26:48] have that faith because it's him and you
[1:26:50] take God at His Word and stand on it
[1:26:52] just the same way he did for verily I
[1:26:54] sent to you that whosoever shall say
[1:26:57] unto this mountain be thou removed and
[1:26:59] be thou cast into the sea and shall not
[1:27:01] doubt in his heart but believe that
[1:27:03] those things which he said shall come to
[1:27:05] pass he shall have whatever he says Amen
[1:27:12] or oh me he's saying you he's speaking
[1:27:18] to you but your name in there I can ask
[1:27:22] but Lord I need that miracle now I'll
[1:27:27] believe it if I see that mountain jump
[1:27:29] up and run off immediately
[1:27:31] Abraham twenty-five years said God said
[1:27:34] so therefore I'm gonna stand on it so
[1:27:38] Abraham was perfect never failed never
[1:27:41] made a mistake he was flawless for 25
[1:27:44] years that's another version of another
[1:27:47] Bible God in the history shows that
[1:27:50] Abraham had his problems because it's
[1:27:54] not the perfecting of the flesh it's in
[1:27:56] the inner man it's the man inside that
[1:27:59] brother Graham said in the control room
[1:28:01] God's Word is true I don't care what
[1:28:04] this flesh says God's Word is true and
[1:28:07] like David said Lord I failed you that
[1:28:10] man should have his life taken the
[1:28:12] Prophet Nathan says David that was you
[1:28:14] and David says Oh God have mercy on me
[1:28:17] let me repent let me say I'm sorry let
[1:28:20] me fix that now not blaming his brother
[1:28:23] now turn around and throwing the fault
[1:28:25] on somebody up and saying lord have
[1:28:26] mercy on me st. John 11 41 and 42 I
[1:28:34] finished with this here and maybe a
[1:28:38] quote or two here st. John chapter 11
[1:28:42] verses 41 and 42 this is where Jesus is
[1:28:47] coming there with Lazarus
[1:28:50] and and you know they you know the story
[1:28:53] there what how it's written where they
[1:28:56] called him and said let your friend
[1:28:57] Lazarus is sick and and generally if
[1:29:01] someone says your friend you know we
[1:29:02] respond quickly as quick as we can as
[1:29:04] soon as we can
[1:29:05] pray for them at all and and he didn't
[1:29:07] hurry and they began to wonder oh well
[1:29:11] maybe he really wasn't his friend Jesus
[1:29:15] had a reason to do what he's going to so
[1:29:17] we come to this place now when he has
[1:29:19] told him and he says let's take me to
[1:29:22] the place race then they took away the
[1:29:23] stone from the place where the dead was
[1:29:25] laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and
[1:29:29] said father I thank thee that thou hast
[1:29:32] heard me have you ever prayed that
[1:29:36] father I thank you that you hear me have
[1:29:42] you ever been his old brother that was
[1:29:43] Jesus it's you you need to come to that
[1:29:47] same place thank you Father for hearing
[1:29:49] me
[1:29:50] and I knew that thou hearest me always
[1:29:55] that's where I was going to he's never
[1:29:58] not listened to you he's never not heard
[1:30:01] you he's never turned his back on you
[1:30:03] and this is what he says I knew that
[1:30:07] thou hearest me always I've learned that
[1:30:11] I've worked with that I've come doing
[1:30:13] that and learned that in my life you've
[1:30:14] never forsaken me you've never turned
[1:30:16] your back on me you've never left me
[1:30:18] alone you've been there all along but
[1:30:21] because of the people which stand by I
[1:30:24] said it that they may believe that thou
[1:30:27] has sent me and you know what when you
[1:30:32] stand there and believe that others will
[1:30:33] take notice why is it that when they
[1:30:37] call out to God God answers but when I
[1:30:40] call out to God there seems to be no
[1:30:42] answer and they might come and ask you
[1:30:44] what is the secret how is it that you
[1:30:48] can talk to God and he answers and you
[1:30:50] can begin to share this living real God
[1:30:53] with others because who what are we here
[1:30:59] for
[1:31:00] to let others know that Jesus Christ is
[1:31:02] the same yesterday today and forever to
[1:31:05] let others know that they can have the
[1:31:07] same joy and hope that we have because I
[1:31:09] don't know who is a new ism therefore to
[1:31:11] me everyone is because I want to be
[1:31:15] included in that number also I want God
[1:31:17] to have mercy on me I know that thou
[1:31:20] hearest me always there's never a time
[1:31:24] even in my despair and even in my
[1:31:26] failures that he's ever turned his back
[1:31:29] on me and said I can't listen to you
[1:31:31] you're too ugly you're - you're too down
[1:31:35] sod you're - this year - that when that
[1:31:38] prodigal son that he talks about and
[1:31:40] he's looking at he said when he came to
[1:31:42] in that Pigpen in that mess that he had
[1:31:45] made and he said I will go back to my
[1:31:47] father's house and he says the father is
[1:31:51] here looking for that returning son he's
[1:31:54] done God is back and say boy when he
[1:31:56] gets back over here I'm gonna let him
[1:31:58] have it with both barrels know he's his
[1:32:00] heart is yearning for the fellowship
[1:32:02] that he had with his son this is no
[1:32:05] different than you and him today because
[1:32:09] she's a couple of quotes here and then
[1:32:10] we'll finish him for tonight
[1:32:12] in fact the musicians could probably go
[1:32:14] ahead and come up the first quote there
[1:32:21] from the message called Joe if a man
[1:32:26] once under the blood feels afraid that
[1:32:28] God won't keep his word it's an insult
[1:32:31] to him to God you're insulting God when
[1:32:36] you're questioning whether he keeps his
[1:32:37] word is something you're saying you're
[1:32:39] just like us God because I can't always
[1:32:41] keep my word you bring into him down to
[1:32:44] a level that he's not he says say
[1:32:48] Jehovah perhaps this is your word but I
[1:32:50] don't know whether it's right or not Oh
[1:32:52] shame on you why once under the blood he
[1:32:55] said I am the lord that he lathy I
[1:32:57] believe it that's all don't insult him
[1:33:01] take God his word and stand on it he
[1:33:04] says he said he that cometh unto me I
[1:33:08] will in no wise cast out I believed it
[1:33:11] once coming under the
[1:33:13] take his word for anything he says and
[1:33:16] every believer here it is get it every
[1:33:19] man or woman that has once been brought
[1:33:22] under the blood of Christ all fear and
[1:33:24] condemnation has gone out then he will
[1:33:27] believe every word that gods write in
[1:33:30] the Bible to be truth he will not say
[1:33:33] it's not inspired and that's not
[1:33:36] inspired
[1:33:37] but he'll believe every word of it and
[1:33:40] punctuated with punctuate it with a Amen
[1:33:45] Beulah than I'm longing for you the
[1:33:52] message perseverant that was the next
[1:33:55] one the whole arm of God is supernatural
[1:33:57] and this one caught my attention the
[1:34:00] whole armour of God is supernatural
[1:34:02] what is the armor of God love I don't
[1:34:06] know that I'd ever read that or cut that
[1:34:08] before love what is love scientifically
[1:34:11] proved to me that there's such a thing
[1:34:13] as love where is it at you know how many
[1:34:17] loves raise your hand how many loves
[1:34:20] raise your hand okay
[1:34:22] loves your wife loves your brother loves
[1:34:25] your friends well I want somebody some
[1:34:27] science to prove to me what part of you
[1:34:30] is love how can we go in and have them
[1:34:34] remove love well they can do that they
[1:34:36] could remove hatred - then he says where
[1:34:40] do you buy it and what drugstore I want
[1:34:42] a bunch of it Lovejoy you got joy peace
[1:34:44] longsuffering gentleness patience what
[1:34:47] is it it's all supernatural God is
[1:34:50] supernatural you don't scientifically
[1:34:53] prove God you believe God you believe it
[1:34:55] if you don't believe it then a man says
[1:34:57] everything that is not scientifically
[1:35:00] his unorthodox not right then that man
[1:35:03] can never be a Christian - he says he
[1:35:06] has to believe by faith we believe God
[1:35:09] not by education not by theology but by
[1:35:12] faith you are saved
[1:35:14] when brother Brown says the whole armour
[1:35:17] of God is love that stopped me because
[1:35:20] when you get into the scriptures he's
[1:35:22] speaking of the armour the faith and all
[1:35:24] and I was speaking to brother Matt for a
[1:35:26] little while on on Monday we were
[1:35:27] sharing a couple of things I said you
[1:35:29] know you can dress yourself in the whole
[1:35:31] armor of God but if the love of God is
[1:35:33] not in there you will use your armor to
[1:35:36] beat up people you'll take the shield of
[1:35:40] faith and bash people in the head
[1:35:41] because they don't have the same faith
[1:35:42] you have but if you have that full armor
[1:35:45] of God with the love of God you'll be a
[1:35:47] soldier for Christ that's why he would
[1:35:50] say something like that it's base
[1:35:51] because God is love that's his old
[1:35:54] motive the rapture let's go to the last
[1:35:58] quote the rapture there but to the
[1:36:01] church the bride the rapture is a
[1:36:03] revelation to her it's an unveiling to
