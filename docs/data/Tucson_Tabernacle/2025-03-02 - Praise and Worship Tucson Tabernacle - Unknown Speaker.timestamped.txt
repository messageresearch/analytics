[10:02] seated I want
[10:04] to instead of remaining remaining
[10:07] standing I'm going to read a little bit
[10:08] longer scripture this evening and I
[10:12] um I want
[10:15] to read the whole Parable that we went
[10:18] through this morning and then after I
[10:21] read this Parable I mentioned that it's
[10:25] um there's a beautiful story that
[10:27] brother brandom tells about
[10:30] uh this young lady who's an orphan and
[10:35] how she finds the love of her life and
[10:37] it's just a very very sweet story and I
[10:40] thought it goes really good with this
[10:43] Matthew chapter 12 this parable of the
[10:46] 10
[10:47] virgins um but first brother Stephen
[10:51] good to see you Stephen Miller here Joe
[10:53] Miller's son God bless you it's good to
[10:56] have you in service sister Margie of
[10:57] course bless you good to see you and I
[11:00] didn't recognize him this morning I
[11:01] forgot my friend Brother Sam baggot it's
[11:05] good to good to see you again so joury
[11:07] with us here a little bit longer want to
[11:09] keep you as long as we can Brother
[11:11] Sam God God bless you let's turn to
[11:14] Matthew chapter 25 and I'll read the
[11:17] parable we read this morning and then uh
[11:21] we'll play that quote uh that story from
[11:23] brother
[11:25] Brandon Matthew chapter 25 verse1 it
[11:28] says this
[11:30] then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be
[11:33] likened under 10 virgins which took
[11:35] their lamps and went forth to meet the
[11:38] bridegroom and five of them were wise
[11:40] and five were
[11:42] foolish they that were foolish took
[11:44] their lamps and took no oil with
[11:47] them but the wise took oil in their
[11:51] vessels with their
[11:53] lamps while the bridegroom carried they
[11:56] all slumbered and slept and at midnight
[11:59] there was a cry made behold the
[12:01] bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him
[12:04] then all those virgins arose and trimmed
[12:07] their lamps and the foolish said unto
[12:09] the wise G give us of your oil for our
[12:13] lamps are gone out but the wise answered
[12:16] saying not so lest there be not enough
[12:19] for us and you but go ye rather to them
[12:23] that sell and buy for
[12:25] yourselves and while they went to buy
[12:28] the bridegroom came
[12:29] and they that were ready went in with
[12:32] him to the marriage and the door was
[12:36] shut afterward came also the other
[12:39] virgins saying Lord Lord open to us but
[12:43] he answered and said verily I say unto
[12:45] you I know you not watch therefore for
[12:50] ye know neither the day nor the hour
[12:54] wherein the son of man
[12:56] cometh we don't know
[13:00] when our lord Jesus will
[13:04] return the Lord talked a lot during his
[13:07] ministry about his second coming and the
[13:11] promises that are associated with his
[13:13] second
[13:15] coming and it'll be a a great day for
[13:19] those that have given their heart to the
[13:21] Lord and and have accepted him as a
[13:24] personal savior remember I said this
[13:27] morning not
[13:30] as joining a church not as joining a
[13:34] denomination or a group of people but as
[13:37] a one onone relationship between the
[13:42] bridegroom and the
[13:44] bride there's a one-on-one relationship
[13:47] between Stephanie and
[13:49] me and I love her and and I I love our
[13:52] fellowship together and I love to talk
[13:55] with her we are just we're one we are
[13:58] perfectly one as the Bible says and that
[14:01] is how the bride will be with the B
[14:06] bridegroom we've been asked for
[14:11] marriage and the question is do we
[14:13] accept the
[14:15] invitation from this
[14:17] bridegroom to be married for all of
[14:19] eternity to the Lord Jesus or do we
[14:23] reject
[14:25] him and that's the question that's the
[14:27] question that's presented to the world
[14:29] brother brandom tells this story I think
[14:31] that you enjoy it it's 10 minutes long
[14:34] and he tells this story about this Rich
[14:36] cattle
[14:38] rancher and he was about time for him to
[14:41] get married so he goes out looking and
[14:44] he goes down to the ranch and and
[14:46] there's the these these sisters and
[14:49] they're all getting prettied up and
[14:50] doled up and they're going to marry this
[14:53] Cattle Baron and he just didn't see much
[14:56] in these girls but he saw something very
[14:59] very special in this barefooted little
[15:01] poor little girl that had a whole lot of
[15:04] character and many times I think that's
[15:07] this bride of Christ we may not have a
[15:10] lot of money we may not be rich we may
[15:14] be orphaned we may not have what the
[15:18] world would call importance or
[15:22] wealth but our bridegroom loves us our
[15:27] Jesus loves us
[15:30] let's go forward with that quote as I
[15:32] said it's um about 10 minutes and I
[15:38] believe it is
[15:41] revelation look it up here Revelation
[15:44] chapter
[15:46] 4
[15:49] and preached on December 31st
[15:55] 1960 and we'll start with paragraph 6 63
[16:00] God bless you the bride has made herself
[16:06] ready reminds me of a little story I
[16:09] just must say it before we go on out
[16:13] west here sometime ago many years there
[16:17] was a this great armor and Swift Packing
[16:21] Company how they do they come out there
[16:23] and buy cattle and buy ranches and
[16:25] they're worth a lot of money and buy up
[16:26] all the small ranchers and have millions
[16:29] of Acres of ranch like that run these
[16:31] big fine Herford cattle and in sections
[16:35] R own their own railroads and things
[16:36] that bring them cattle from one pasture
[16:39] to another armor and Swifts had a big
[16:42] Ranch and one day they had a foreman
[16:47] there the superintendent it was of the
[16:50] ranch he had about four or five
[16:54] daughters and they found out that one of
[16:57] the big Aral
[16:59] Brothers was uh or not Brothers but Sons
[17:03] were going to visit the ranch and he was
[17:05] a a young single
[17:08] man and all these girls sure was going
[17:11] to Vamp this boy as soon as he he come
[17:15] and so they all was getting ready and
[17:17] making everything ready to come when he
[17:21] got there this going to meet him and put
[17:22] on an old Frontier day with their little
[17:25] dresses on with the Fringe on it and 44s
[17:28] on each chip and them uh hats on the
[17:31] back of their head you know there's
[17:32] going to be regular westerners and each
[17:34] one of the girls was going to get one of
[17:36] them was going to get this
[17:38] boy and they had a a little cousin there
[17:43] that her mother was dead her father was
[17:47] dead she was a cousin and she almost was
[17:51] the slave to all that was there all the
[17:54] dirty work she had to do it washing the
[17:56] dishes and everything and she had no
[17:59] clothes she had to take handy downs and
[18:02] so when the time come that the boy was
[18:05] to arrive they all got in their Buck
[18:07] boards and way down to the station they
[18:09] went to receive him and they were
[18:12] shooting the guns and the horses
[18:14] nickering and everything they brought
[18:16] him out to the ranch and that night they
[18:18] had a big Shin dig and they got out
[18:19] there on the H stacks and the crow fence
[18:22] and they they sang and they danced and
[18:24] all through the night he was there for
[18:27] two or three days
[18:29] this little cousin now I'm going to
[18:32] liken this to something now our cousins
[18:36] that's all dressed up big spires and
[18:40] fine churches and looks like there's any
[18:42] dirty name that has to be given to the
[18:44] Pentecostal something is wrong they do
[18:46] the wrong thing too but they they heard
[18:49] about you see they're kind of classical
[18:51] so they you don't hear about that but
[18:53] let some Pentecostal Minister make a
[18:55] mistake one time brother I'm telling you
[18:57] they all Packer across the country
[18:59] newspaper yes sir let some Pentecostal
[19:02] brother pray for a child and it dies
[19:05] every newspaper in a country will
[19:07] pack uh Divine Healing is
[19:10] fanaticism well then how not put every
[19:13] case in the paper that the doctor loses
[19:16] sauce for the goose is sauce for the
[19:18] ganders so if uh they do that you
[19:21] wouldn't have enough room in the columns
[19:23] and the papers to write all the de if I
[19:26] go out here in the graveyard and say
[19:28] everybody that ever died under Divine
[19:29] Healing stand
[19:31] up then say everybody ever died under
[19:34] medical treatment stand up that without
[19:36] number a million to one that's exactly
[19:39] right so if they going to criticize one
[19:40] criticize the other that's right but
[19:43] they kill millions of a year with
[19:45] medicines and operations you never hear
[19:47] a word about it so this little girl she
[19:51] had all the rough work to do so when all
[19:53] at once the boy one night when supper
[19:57] was over and they had d and each one of
[19:59] these girls is pretty all up you know
[20:01] and this poor little girl had to have a
[20:03] little ragged dress on and one night she
[20:07] sitting in the mess hall after supper
[20:09] was over and she washed the dishes and
[20:11] she R out through the backyard to throw
[20:14] the dishwater out she when she turned
[20:16] around the cray fence there he stood
[20:19] leaning at the CR fence he said hello
[20:23] she was so ashamed because that was the
[20:27] superintendent's boy
[20:29] the son of the owner of the ring she
[20:33] help the dish down pan down so he
[20:35] wouldn't notice her s raged started
[20:37] backing off with the bare feet looking
[20:39] back like this and he walked up here
[20:41] said don't be afraid of me I want to
[20:44] tell you something he said I come out
[20:47] year for one
[20:49] purpose I come out to find a
[20:53] wife and said I've been looking
[20:55] everywhere said I didn't want to marry
[20:57] any of the girls back there in the city
[20:58] I want to get what I thought was a real
[21:01] wife instead of all that I've seen I've
[21:04] been noticing you around here and I
[21:06] found out through some of the hands that
[21:08] you're a cousin said that's right sir
[21:11] but I want to ask you something will you
[21:13] marry
[21:14] me why she didn't know what to do she
[21:17] was
[21:18] so beset she didn't she didn't know how
[21:20] to answer the man oh I just about
[21:24] imagine how she felt don't you when me a
[21:26] sinner once no good for nothing
[21:30] drunkard's Child Jesus Christ said I
[21:33] want you for mine how could he ever come
[21:37] to somebody like
[21:39] me how could he ever say I'll give you a
[21:42] home in heaven how could he ever say
[21:44] I'll save you such a wretch as
[21:47] me how could it ever be but he did it
[21:51] she said sir I'm not I'm not worthy I
[21:54] couldn't make a wife to a man like you
[21:58] said because you are used to great
[22:00] things and I know nothing about them I'm
[22:03] poor he said but you are my
[22:08] sh and wasn't it nice when Jesus told
[22:10] you that you know you wasn't worthy to
[22:13] be a Christian you it wasn't nothing you
[22:15] could ever do but it's nothing he just
[22:17] chose you it was his goodness his Mercy
[22:21] that he chose you you didn't choose him
[22:23] you know he chose you that's
[22:27] right she said said I don't she said
[22:30] don't look at your clothes I don't look
[22:32] at your clothes I look at what you are
[22:35] he said would you marry me and finally
[22:38] the agreement was made he said one year
[22:41] from this day I will return you be
[22:45] ready have the wedding garment on for I
[22:49] will return and marry you right here on
[22:51] these
[22:52] grounds I'll take you to Chicago to
[22:55] Outer Drive there where you'll have a
[22:57] castle to live in
[22:59] all this dishwashing will be over and
[23:01] things
[23:03] down when the sisters of the cousins
[23:06] heard about that they said you poor
[23:08] little ignorant fool why you know that
[23:11] man didn't mean that and isn't that just
[23:13] exactly what they say today how could a
[23:16] bunch of Holy Rollers a bunch of people
[23:18] who hardly can write their own name how
[23:20] would they ever be the church how would
[23:22] a group like that ever be but that's
[23:24] just all right when we got engaged and
[23:27] felt that bet kiss of Jesus Christ on
[23:30] our heart to take away our sins
[23:31] something tells us that he's coming back
[23:35] again thank someday he'll come
[23:38] back all years she worked slaving saving
[23:43] her little 75 cents they give her for
[23:46] her wages a day and she was saving up
[23:49] her money to buy her wedding gown to
[23:52] make everything ready oh that was all of
[23:55] her thought making ready and he had has
[23:58] she has made herself ready she got her
[24:02] clothes her wedding clothes while her
[24:03] cousins laughed at her and made fun of
[24:05] her finally come to the finally the days
[24:09] she dressed herself in her wedding
[24:13] Garden got all ready and cleaned up and
[24:17] her little cousins come around and Bow
[24:19] by her and said you silly little thing
[24:21] why you know he didn't mean that he
[24:23] wouldn't speak to a a mar a girl like
[24:26] you but she made herself ready anyhow so
[24:30] come along late in the evening and they
[24:32] begin to Mock and make fun of her she
[24:34] stood right at the door waiting
[24:36] anyhow and so she he said what time did
[24:39] he say it be here he said he didn't say
[24:42] but said she told he told me the night
[24:43] that he Mar he gave me the engagement
[24:45] ring he said he told me it would be
[24:48] about one year from now therefore I've
[24:50] got an hour left amen just kept waiting
[24:54] I got one hour left 30 minutes left 10
[24:58] minutes left and they laughed and made
[25:01] fun of her and called her everything but
[25:03] finally right at that crucial hour they
[25:06] heard the sand turning under the wheels
[25:09] they horses are
[25:10] coming what a thing it was to see that
[25:13] little bride and made herself ready jump
[25:16] out of the door and round through the
[25:17] roast covered TRS out there to fly into
[25:20] the arms of the man that she loved is to
[25:23] be her husband to pick her up in like
[25:25] that and be married and ride away
[25:43] and he knew what it was to be
[25:47] poor we listen to his tapes and he he
[25:51] tells a story of his life story and
[25:53] that I I met a um a man
[25:58] old man
[26:01] named Don
[26:03] Weber Don
[26:05] Weber believe it was
[26:08] his mother or his
[26:12] grandmother that brother Bram tells the
[26:14] story about he couldn't make ends meet
[26:17] in his church they didn't have very many
[26:19] people back then he probably had I can't
[26:23] even guess how many people had but I'd
[26:24] say between 20 and 50
[26:26] people and he could make in meet and he
[26:30] said that he was going to go up and he
[26:33] was going to take an offering now
[26:35] usually they pass the
[26:36] plate and uh it wouldn't be brother
[26:39] brandom that would do it it would be the
[26:42] um the Deacon or or the song leader
[26:44] whatever it was but he decided he was
[26:47] going to take an offering and he was
[26:48] going to go up and he was going to
[26:49] announce it and he goes up there and he
[26:52] says now we're going to take an offering
[26:55] and we're short on
[26:56] money and we're going to we going to
[26:58] pass the plate we need this much money
[27:01] and he looked down in the front row and
[27:02] there was a little lady her name was
[27:04] Sister
[27:05] Weber and she opened up her purse and
[27:09] brother brandom saw that little lady
[27:11] open her purse and he said no I was just
[27:14] kidding he said we're not We're not
[27:16] gonna we're not going to take an
[27:17] offering so brother somebody gave
[27:18] brother brandom a
[27:20] bicycle uh
[27:22] either right before that or right after
[27:24] that brother brandom cleaned it up
[27:26] painted it and sold it and paid the
[27:28] bills for the church so he he didn't
[27:30] have to ask the church for money I I was
[27:33] talking with this Don Weber and he
[27:37] introduced me to his sister and both of
[27:39] them
[27:41] knew brother brandom dawn was there when
[27:47] they um he was a little kid when they
[27:49] laid the foundation the Cornerstone for
[27:53] the random
[27:54] Tabernacle and his sister
[27:58] told me she said you know those
[28:02] brandom she said they were rough they
[28:05] were uh she said they were drinkers he
[28:07] heard brother brandom in this quote he
[28:09] said he said I'm the son of a drunkard
[28:12] he really
[28:14] was and uh this this Mrs Weber told me
[28:18] she said they were she said they uh she
[28:21] lived across the street from a couple of
[28:22] Brams a couple brother brandom's
[28:24] brothers they were she said they were
[28:26] always drunk and she says so I don't
[28:29] have a lot of respect for that brandom
[28:31] family and I said I said 'yes ma'am I I
[28:34] knew I knew that and she said but let me
[28:38] tell you she said I went to school with
[28:41] the
[28:41] Broms and she said this is during the
[28:44] Depression she said everybody was poor
[28:48] she said but those
[28:49] Broms they were the poorest of all of us
[28:53] they were the poorest of the poor so
[28:56] when brother brandom tells a story like
[28:57] that that he was there he experienced
[29:02] poverty he experienced hard times and
[29:05] you know I think it I really believe it
[29:06] built his character I don't think it
[29:08] hurt him one bit I think that is why so
[29:11] many people loved him is because he
[29:13] related to the common person it wasn't
[29:16] he didn't hang around all the the big
[29:18] preachers and all the important people
[29:20] and the politicians he could have
[29:22] brother Brandon was pretty the pretty
[29:23] much the biggest name in um biggest
[29:27] evangelist in the whole world in the
[29:30] 1950s he was big but he didn't want to
[29:33] hang around the important people he
[29:36] wanted to hang around people like my
[29:37] grandpa who was nothing more than a
[29:40] service station owner poor man that
[29:43] would save up all his money during the
[29:46] week and drive from tiffon Georgia to
[29:49] Jeffersonville to go to the meetings
[29:52] they didn't have YouTube back then they
[29:54] didn't have what we have and uh then he
[29:58] do it again for years and years so when
[30:01] brother brandom was telling the story
[30:02] you can tell it meant something to him
[30:04] because he related to that young
[30:07] lady and this Parable that we
[30:10] heard of this
[30:13] bride this this virgin it it's perfect
[30:18] with this story even as I was
[30:21] researching over the past couple days
[30:24] even the Hebrew weddings they're not
[30:26] like our weddings a tral an engagement
[30:30] was a marriage basically and
[30:34] then from what I read it was about a
[30:38] year's time from the betrothal that's
[30:42] when brother L you can probably correct
[30:44] me but I think that's about the betral
[30:46] is when they paid the dowy and that's
[30:48] when the the family of the the groom
[30:51] paid the family of the Bride a certain
[30:54] amount of money and
[30:58] they uh then there was a a time there
[31:02] where they were married but they weren't
[31:05] legally married to live together as
[31:09] husband and wife and then the bridegroom
[31:14] after that period of Engagement which I
[31:16] think it was a year then that bridegroom
[31:19] would come and there was a lot of Pomp
[31:21] and a lot of excitement and uh and a lot
[31:24] of as we heard as we read in the in the
[31:27] um Parable there's lamps and and and
[31:32] these just a lot of lights and a lot of
[31:34] just a really neat thing and the
[31:37] bridegroom would come and take his bride
[31:40] and take his bride
[31:42] home this story I don't know if brother
[31:45] brandham ever knew that when he told
[31:47] when he told the story but it is really
[31:49] really perfect with that parable of
[31:53] Matthew chapter
[31:54] 25 brother Daniel who's first and Sarah
[31:59] brother Aon Sister Sarah if you could
[32:01] you could make ready to
[32:03] sing I
[32:05] um I do this as they're coming up um
[32:10] this Don Don Weber it was really it's
[32:13] neat getting to know him he had so many
[32:16] stories of just the old times and and
[32:19] the
[32:20] depression and um I
[32:24] think I videoed him I think it's on
[32:26] voice of God Recordings we site if I
[32:28] remember right under the video section
[32:29] if you want to see him but just a
[32:31] wonderful person he was good friends
[32:33] with Billy Paul brandham and you know
[32:36] they were you know kind of grew up
[32:39] together and just to see the
[32:43] firsthand um testimony of all these
[32:46] things that had happened building the
[32:48] random Tabernacle he said that that he
[32:50] was there when they they brought the
[32:52] trusses down from the quadrangle which
[32:54] is just a few blocks up on on wagons and
[32:58] he said that they they came across both
[33:00] sides of the road and they they brought
[33:02] them down and and then brought the the
[33:05] trusses and set them up on the on the
[33:08] blocks on the masonry and he's the one
[33:10] he told me about um um Mr Ingram who was
[33:15] a wealthy businessman that he is the one
[33:18] that funded the brandom Tabernacle and
[33:21] getting it started and loaning brother
[33:23] brandom the money and um I believe it
[33:25] was in 1933 and then of course they
[33:28] finished it just shortly after that I
[33:30] could go on and on tell them those those
[33:32] stories God bless you brother and sister
[33:34] sir this morning brother Daniel
[33:37] ministering and he talked that about
[33:40] having the oil and make sure it was
[33:44] full it reminded me of something we
[33:46] happened as as a young group of PE of
[33:49] boys young men we went hunting out the
[33:52] Sita
[33:54] mountains and we were out there from
[33:56] Thursday to
[33:58] Saturday come Saturday at the end of the
[34:00] hunt we all got back to the vehicles and
[34:02] the camp tents and we all began to ask
[34:05] each other if we had
[34:07] water and everybody had run out of water
[34:10] there was no water in the camp there was
[34:13] no water in our canteens there was no
[34:15] bottle of water
[34:16] anywhere we were only 45 minutes away
[34:19] from the from where we could get water
[34:22] but it was a desperate
[34:24] feeling so the next time we went camping
[34:27] we had enough water to put out a forest
[34:30] fire you just make sure and I thought
[34:34] just reminded me be sure your lamp is
[34:37] burning so this song I asked Sarah if we
[34:40] could sing it together what will it be
[34:43] when we get over

[1:04:19] you
[1:04:30] I talked this morning about a Rapture
[1:04:33] that's going to happen the Bible says
[1:04:37] that the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:04:42] first and the reason that the dead in
[1:04:44] Christ rise
[1:04:45] first is because we're going to get all
[1:04:48] of our hugs and all of our kisses and
[1:04:51] and all of our praising and and all of
[1:04:53] our happiness we're going to get that
[1:04:55] all done with each other first because
[1:04:58] when Jesus comes down he wants all eyes
[1:05:00] on him so you're going to see him and
[1:05:04] you're you're going to see him just
[1:05:05] before you see the Lord Jesus really
[1:05:08] nice job amen
[1:05:13] nice sister Angela I believe your kids
[1:05:16] have a song right awesome we're gonna

[1:05:26] and he answered
[1:05:29] me and delivered
[1:05:34] me from every
[1:05:38] fear and those that look on
[1:05:42] him are ready
[1:05:50] end they'll never be ashamed this poor
[1:05:54] man
[1:05:56] this poor man
[1:05:59] cried and the Lord heard
[1:06:03] me and save me
[1:06:07] from my
[1:06:11] enemy the Son of
[1:06:15] God surrounds his
[1:06:19] s he will deliver
[1:06:23] them he will Del
[1:06:28] them oh
[1:06:31] magnify the
[1:06:33] Lord with
[1:06:36] me and come
