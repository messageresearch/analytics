keep your life or you can give it away to the Lord I recommend that you give it away to the Lord when I think about that song think about someone that really did um sister Lily Blessed Assurance I think about the one who wrote that song that we sang earlier Blessed Assurance is there's a lady named Fanny Crosby she lived the turn of the century early 1900s and Daniel was telling me the story of her life yesterday I knew the story of her life but he was telling me the story of that song but would you mind I think you could do it better than me absolutely um so if you don't know whose sister Fanny Crosby was she was a songwriter she wrote a bunch of hymns but her story was whenever she was a kid she had like an infection with her eye and she had a doctor who put this iav on it that actually burnt her eyes and caused her to be blind for the rest of her life and so knowing that story I was I was reading through the songs and I was reading through that third verse um can we put the third verse on for Blessed Assurance please and I was reading through this verse and I just looked at it and it says perfect submission all is at rest I am My Savior am happy and blessed and I looked at that I'm like man this woman was blind but she said I in my savior am happy and blessed she was happy being blind because she knew who the one was who had her life in his hands and it was just amazing it just it just blessed me and I just I loved that story amen perfect submission amen Perfect [Music] submiss all is at rest I in my sa and happy and blessed I'm watching and waiting looking above I'm filled with his [Music] goodness his love Blessed Assurance oh BL is my story this is my song praising my S [Music] avior all the day long this is my story this is my [Music] song oh I'm praising myor all the day let's all bow our heads think about that song how blessed we are I thank Lord how much you've given me how Great and Mighty heavenly father thank you for the testimony of this blind sister that wrote that many other songs Lord thank you for the inspiration you placed upon her and the song leading to that I Give Myself Away Lord we want to give ourselves away to you and ask Lord that you would accept our meager offering of Our Lives Lord take us into your bosom and father just just accept our praise from now through eternity how grateful we are for you in Jesus name amen amen God bless you emotional on that you can be seated it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning that's a good spirit Happy Spirit as I was back there hearing everybody singing the songs of worship just appreciating how much the Lord has done for us and how much he continues to do for us we never want to neglect to thank him for what he does I um for uh I do to announce I

God bless you who who is this her name is Lulu Lulu Lulu welcome God bless you I have a sister that we call Lulu God bless you it's good to have you in the service say it again Dario Dario God bless you welcome it's good to have you any other visitors that I might have missed welcome we're we're honored to have people brothers and sisters come and join us we hope that you feel welcome when you come I um I I've been traveling this past week and I was we're at a uh kind of a conference type of thing where there was um the um kind of the there there was a lot of influential people in this area in the scientific Community especially in the earth science community and I was um during during the day there um there there would have some vendors out and there there's a lot of us there so the vendors were allowed to set up in the big Auditorium and they would sell some of the they would be pitching some of their top scien ific um instruments that they had you know The Cutting Edge stuff and you know we'd go through and look at it and some of the just the coolest things that you can imagine that that they're doing with with research and and data collection and there was one guy there and this guy he had his little booth set up and I felt bad for him because he had all of these old instruments and these instruments were the same things that that we've been using for the past hundred years and just in the past just 10 years or so technology has increased so much that it really made these other things Obsolete and he was there and he was trying to trying to pitch his his stuff that we had we were coming by like oh yeah I remember those things that that's what we used to use in this and this and he was trying to sell these things as something well you still need it this is still really really important but what he didn't understand is the whole point of of technology and the whole point of moving forward was there is a better way to do these things now and it's not that our equations are different it's not that physics has changed it's not that God's God's laws have changed of what we do but now technology has moved up and moved forward to where it takes the old way of doing things and makes those things obsolete so the the what had happened was this man he he kind of leveled with me and he says well here's what happened is I bought this company and all this inventory and he says I thought I could really make some good money on it and I was like bro this is some out ofate stuff we we used to use this stuff and it still works it's still good but there is a better better way now to do it and it made me think of this book of Hebrews that we've been studying for our visitors we've been going through every chapter in the book of Hebrews now we're on chapter8 and each chapter has has specific things that are really for all of us but the general theme of the book of Hebrews it was it was written by an unknown author most people think and I I agree that it was the Apostle Paul that wrote it and it has a has a theme of of the audience you have to understand the audience is are Jews that had given their hearts and their lives over to the Lord Jesus and they had accepted Jesus as the Messiah and they began to slip back into their old way of thinking and this book of Hebrews is meant to address those people and say hey don't slip back these this this Messiah that you've accepted he is far greater than you could ever imagine and what and place by place by place and aspect and aspect and and parts of this man's life and the book of Hebrews goes to all these different parts of Jesus's life and how great they are and his main theme is this is better than the way that you used to think this is better than the way that you used to do it and as I was talking with this guy in in this in this show in this conference he didn't get the point that these things are not as useful anymore they're still right we still f as I said physics hasn't changed our equations H haven't changed God's laws don't change but this book of Hebrews is saying but there is a more excellent way than what what you have learned before before this man Jesus it reminds me of 1 Corinthians chapter 12 it says now you are the body of Christ and members in individually and God has appointed these in the church first apostles second prophets third teachers after that Miracles then Gifts of healing helps administrations varieties of tongues are all Apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of Miracles he's he's putting the whole body of Christ together do all have gifts of healings do all speak with tongues do all interpret but earnestly desire the best gifts and then he says this but yet I will show you a more excellent way I'm going to show you a better way than all of these gifts those things are good pastors are good Apostles are good prophets are good these things are all working toward the with the body of Christ but there is something greater than all of these things and he he just goes right into though I speak with tongue of men and angels and have not love I've become a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy and I understand all the Mysteries and knowledge through all Faith so that I could remove mountains but I have not love I have nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned but have not love it profits me nothing love suffers long love is kind amen love doesn't Envy love does not parade itself it's not puffed up it doesn't behave rudely it doesn't seek its own it's not provoked it doesn't think evil doesn't rejoice in iniquity but it rejoices in the truth amen it Bears all things believes all things hopes all things and endures all things Love Never Fails but whether there are prophecies they will fail whether there are tongues they will cease whether there is knowledge it will vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but then that which is when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part will be done away with and that Perfection author is talking about is love it's beautiful the Apostle John said these three words very simply he said God is love it is the most perfect way it doesn't do away with all Min ministrations it doesn't do away with a pastor I'm standing here pastoring a church ministering the gospel but I'm trying to point you to the infallible thing the perfect thing this is not the perfect thing but if I can point you to that which is perfect then that which is in part those things that are weak in our lives it'll be done away with my I was talking with my brother a couple days ago we always call each other um on he calls me just before service on Wednesday night Wednesday evening and it's it's the same day that he has his Bible study at the boxing gym and he had a young lady that came um that she's been coming and they had their Bible study there and there's 50 or 60 of these Fighters around men and boys and girls men and women there their parents and and um Adam teaches them about the word and one one of the one of the young ladies she says I I would like to share something she said I got baptized today and Adam is like really well well tell us your story so what happened is this this young lady she had a rough life he could tell that there were probably drugs and and and and and probably worst things that were in her life but she had turned things around and she said what had happened was how all of this changed is I had a seizure she said I never had one before and I've never had one since she said I had a seizure they brought me to the Hospital Jeffersonville Indiana and she said there was a nice nurse there and she was so kind to me she treated me with such love her name was Stephanie not my Stephanie but Ace nurse in Jeffersonville named Stephanie um but she said this lady was so nice and she started talking about the scriptures with me she started talking about God and how much God loves me and she said I had never heard things like this and she started listening and and she started taking this in and you see that this seed that may have laid dormant for 20 years started to Spring to life and she started she started reaching out to the Lord Jesus she started praying and from that moment her life started changing there was a point in that nurse's testimony that brought this young lady to the Lord and she was proud to give that testimony and and as my brother was telling me that I was thinking that we've gone through the book of Hebrews and it says in in there that the word of God is quick means it's alive and it's powerful and it's sharper than any two-edged sword it is if you present the word in the right way to someone it's not a dead word or a dead works it is powerful and it will change something someone it'll it'll completely change their lives and you can go from heartache and and sorrow and drug abuse and all of that all the way till joy happiness family and good things I was I got a call uh when I was in Ministry in Jeffersonville uh from from a lady and she had just her son was strung out on drugs she was getting evicted from her house she was standing on a street corner and just weeping and somebody walked up to her saw her weeping and said here gave her a business card call that number she looked at it was a little track she turned it over and she called um where we where I was receptionist sent it to me and she just started weeping on the phone and I started talking with her and we prayed together and and it it was just nice and and then she would call more often I sent her some some material some recorded sermons and she she just started getting better and getting happier and then she reconciled with her son and her son started doing better and her just her whole life she came down and she got baptized and I said sister I said you need a place to go to church and she lived I don't know it was like four hours away so I started sending her to these different churches and and she would call me back I sent her remember I sent her to the first one and she calls me back and she says um brother Daniel um she says uh yeah I I went to that church um what are the seven Thunders and I said um well it's just how they believe it's here's here's a uh you know kind of an explanation of it and she says well I would like to go to a different church do you have another place I said sure So I I sent her another church that I knew of that was a little bit further away and she comes back and she says she says brother Daniel she says um I you know I'm I'm trying to I guess I'm supposed to change the way I look and I'm I guess I'm supposed to change the way I dress she said but she says what what's the fivefold ministry and I said well sister it's it's this it's it's a Ministry she said well I'd like to do you have another place and I said yeah sure and and she called back and she said so so we're not supposed to have preachers anymore I was like sister Tammy I said that's not the point so now you got that's that's not the point with all of this and she told me and she was just weeping she says I just want somebody that cares and she said those sermons that you sent me she said the man on the other side of those sermons he cares about me she said I want to meet him and I said no he passed away like like 60 years ago and and she says well she says I can tell he cares she she says I just I just need something and a year ago goes by and corresponding back and forth and and she gives me a testimony and she says I just want you to know that do you remember when you sent me those those recorded sermons I said yes she said do you remember which ones I said probably she said do you remember the testimony that the man gave about his life story and how he was he was um meeting a uh a young lady and she lit up a cigarette and he just hated smoking so much and he said he said um it just it just disgusted him and and she said I wanted to wait one year to tell you this she said but I've been trying to quit smoking she said I've been smoking since I was 14 years old and she said I've been trying to quit smoking for for re for like 20 years now and I've never had anything that was successful and she said when I heard that story she said cigarettes from that point on disgusted me and she said I wanted to wait a year before I told you because I've tried before and she said I am today I have no desire at all to smoke cigarettes it was it was it was a testimony it was something Supernatural to show her that God cares for her it wasn't The Narrative of this church or The Narrative of that church Church there was a point in everything that that is in this Bible there is a point and that point is not to make converts to a certain way of thinking that point is to get people to Christ because he is great and this book of Hebrews as I look over the the the words here it's all about that there is a better way these these ways of of of how you dress and how you talk and and and what you say in the church and and all of that they're they're good but there is something better there's a point in all of it and that point is to get to Christ and we have to understand that point did you ever see um I'm going to show my age 1984 The Karate Kid there's a there's this old story way before most of you were born um but anyways so this kid he gets bullied and he goes and he has this great karate instructor this um this little Chinese man and and and he says I want to learn I want to learn how to how to fight you know so I don't get beat up anymore and I can't remember all of it I just Googled it last night or or youtubed it and and saw the little clip of what I'm about to say but he uh so what he did is the the the the the great Guru says okay well I'll teach you and he says now he says you come over here and he says and he gets his can of paint and his paintbrush and he says now you paint the fence and he's like in in the man's backyard he says well okay and he's no no no no no no no no no no no not like that he says you do it like this perfect like this and then the the kid's like okay he's like he's like yeah good he's like okay I got it he says now the whole fence and it was this huge long fence and he says um okay so then he gets done with a fence and he says now he says now and he has this all this decking he says now you send the floor and he's like s the floor and he says yeah he says like this and like this and like this and he says okay so he Sands the floor and then they go to the car he he goes he gets done with that and he's so sore and he says now you wax the cars and he has all these cars in his backyard he says now you wax all the cars and he says okay no no no no no he says like this he or he says like this and like this and like this so the kid is just like I was thought I was going to learn to fight and punch and all this stuff how come how come I'm doing all this so he's mad he he's hopping mad and and the the guru says okay you know and it's night he's his shoulders out of out of whack and and he says the guru he he starts he gets mad loses his temper and he says now the guru says he says you've died me do all this stuff and he says I thought I was here to learn how to fight and the g says no no no no no he says watch and and his arm was I can't even move so he takes his hands and he rubs them together and and he does this movie thing well I know you know what I'm talking about he does he he does it like this and he puts it on his shoulder and his shoulder immediately gets better so he shows him a sign something that he couldn't explain and he got his attention he got his confidence and then he says okay and he's standing in front of him he says now show me paint the fence and he goes he said no no no no no like you're supposed to and he raises his hand like this and then the guru punches and he blocks and he punches low and he blocks like this he was having he was learning that muscle memory he says okay now she me sand the floor and he's he's he's he's doing this and then the gurus kicks and he blocks his kick with this so he's learning all of this stuff and he didn't understand until the the guru says here Mr Miagi was his name this is how you do it this is why I'm doing this so he learns how to fight but he didn't understand what it was all about and that's like many times the Old Testament or many times the Bible is we're learning these things but we need to be able to apply them to our lives and the point of all the rituals and all the formality surely people asked in the Old Testament what is the point in all of this why do we have to do all this like like the young man in the movie did why why in the world do we have do I have to sand the floor and paint the fence and do all this well there was a purpose in all of it and that purpose was God's will says in the beginning of Hebrews it says God who at Sund drry times and diverse manners God who in old times and in various ways spoke in times passed by the fathers hath in these last days spoken by his son whom heed heir of all things and through him also he made the world who being in the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down at the right hand of the majesty and eye having become so much better than the angels He has by inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than they he's saying you've learned this this Jesus is greater he's different than the prophets and there was always a constant warning as we've gone through the book of Hebrews that there therefore in in chapter two therefore we must give the more Earnest heed to those things which we have learned lest at any time we let them slip and we drift away for if the word spoken through Angels was steadfast and every transgression and Disobedience received a reward not a good reward a punishment how shall we escape if we neglect so great a Salvation which first was spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard them heard him so he's warning Us in this book that these Stakes are very high and and God gets the attention with the people he gets the attention through signs and wonders and miracles but there is a point to the Miracles there is a point to the healings there's a point to the science because brothers and sisters everybody who has lived with the exception of two has died since Adam until now so if we are healed we're going to get sick again but there is a purpose of God showing Miracles there is a point to it and it's not the short fix it's a long term so long it's Eternal that God is showing it and then he talks about the high priest and he he sets this high priest in order it's important to the author that he that we know what this high priest is because he he says that he says therefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our confession Christ Jesus he is saying right here now this Jesus Christ not only his he God which he said at the beginning but he's also a high priest and I know we've gone through all this I'm I'm reviewing it but it's very very important because the author keeps reiterating it chapter after chapter he keeps talking about the high priest and and he says that he this high priest was the one with Aaron who went into this Tabernacle in the wilderness remember Moses brought the people out of Egypt they go across the Red Sea the the the waters part they they start wandering in the wilderness they kept failing and failing and failing but they built this Tabernacle in the wilderness and in that Tabernacle was this little area in the back where the Ark of the Covenant sat The Mercy Seat was there and this is where the high priest went in once a year to make sacrifices for the people the and the glory of the Lord came down and he said that that this Jesus is like that high priest he is an intercessor he's the one that makes a sacrifice for us and he he goes on and on saying that but this one didn't die like the high priest died Aaron died Aaron's son died and all the way down they all died but this one he made this sacrifice once and for all and he's he's laying a foundation here and we look in the Old Testament and the change but from the Old Testament to the New Testament is is very marked God was a god of pure Justice he still is but he was a god of justce Justice which means if you sinned he required blood he required a death for sin he made that promise in the Garden of Eden and his promise once is for all time and he made that promise he said if you eat of this fruit you will die and they did not only that but God stayed his wrath by making a sacrifice of an animal but it was not it wasn't a human so he goes on and he he's talking about he he's moving the people he's saying that there is a point in all of this Old Testament teaching that and and you look at the Old Testament there is no emphasis on a personal relationship with God the emphasis is on ritual the emphasis is on um it's it's it's on obedience but then we get to the New Testament and it changes from ritual there's almost no um emphasis in the New Testament on ritual now it's all on a personal relationship the Old Testament the the the Sabbath the the book of Hebrews talks about the Sabbath and and and how that we were supposed to rest one day of the week and the author here he says but then if you get into Christ it is an always you always rest because you are eternally sealed there and he talks about all of these different things that come in the Old Testament he says basically there's a point to all of this you just been going and you've been doing all these things but all of these come to that point and it's that one that Messiah that you have accepted now I think all of us should ask the same question that this sister asked me when she started hearing all this stuff about these different churches and they they were telling her to do this and do that what is the point what is the point in it all there has to be a reason there has to be a reason that they took the scapegoat they took two goats one was killed and one was sent out into the Wilderness in the Old Testament there has to be a reason for that and we need to understand those Reas reasons there has to be a reason for for the way that we live our lives do we think that we do things because God's going to bless us for it do we think that I'm doing this I want to live this way because I want reward or I want to make money or I'm I'm going to prosper because of my religion is that why we do things because that's the wrong thoughts that's that's not it we do these things we try to live for the Lord because he died for my sins he he's wonderful and I want to spend my eternity with him he's so great I grew up thinking in my thought I wasn't taught this but I grew up thinking the more that I could give to the church the better my life would be and it went monetarily and I would give give everything that I could every dollar that I could get together I would I would give that because I thought that I that would bring me closer to God but I wasn't getting the point then I started as as um when I was really young when I I was about 20 years old I started giving things up in my life I started giving giving up partying with my friends and and and then I separated myself even from my good friends because they didn't see things exactly like I did then I started giving up gave up movies and I gave up television and and then I got married and we had children and Stephanie and I we wouldn't even read fairy tales to Daniel and meline it was only Bible stories and I'm I'm glad we did it but there was a point and there should be a point and we should understand what that point would be moved our family across the country I thought I was I was doing right and and I believe that I was led of the Lord but I didn't understand that there is an ultimate there is a pinnacle there's a top of the mountain in all of this and it's not just just living right that's part of it and if someone says let me back up a little bit if someone says that they believe in the Lord Jesus and they're not willing to make changes in their life then I question that testimony am they um they had a I gave a testimony last week about a young man or I think it was last week about a young man that I saw this young man I saw the Holy Spirit come down and enter that young man I saw it because I saw it on his face I felt the feeling of it I I didn't see anything come down but I I I just I saw this man give his heart to the Lord and I saw the change in him and then I talked about how this young man as time went on he started slipping back and then his life started getting worse and worse and worse until this day that he doesn't have a career he doesn't he doesn't have a have a good life he doesn't have happiness he he goes from girl to girl and and there's there's really there's no foundation in his life and and the answer to me really came on that sermon that we heard on Wednesday night if you heard that there was a brother Ramsay and um the um he was he was a minister of the Gospel way back brother brandham knew him he was a friend of brother brandham and the two would get together and they'd talk about the Lord and and he was a uh I believe a Church of God Minister just really a good man and brother brandom was overseas and he comes back and he works and this brother Ramsey Works in a mechanic shop and he says he says brother Ramsey says um how you doing I'd like for you to go overseas with me sometime brother Ramsey said I don't serve God anymore Billy he didn't see the point in all of it and it really hurt brother brandham and brother brandham thought did I hear him right he goes out to the car he's with his wife there and he says wait a minute he goes back in he says what did you say he says I don't serve God anymore I don't want to talk about it I don't want to talk about it so then one one of the the employees that worked there goes to brother brandom he says he says listen he says things are bad he says he says what happened the other day he said this brother Ramsey he said he told me he said the the bars weren't open on the on the Indiana side so he had to go over to Louisville he said he told me to go over and get him a case of beer and come back and he said brother Ramsey I've been guilty of a lot of things in my life but buying a servant of God a case of beer ain't one of them and it's not going to be so he took the young man's car and he goes over and he gets tanked up comes back with his with his beer and then the man got sick and died young man this this preacher and brother brandom's opinion on this was that this man must have been saved because when he turned from the Lord his life started falling apart and he ended up getting sick he ended up dying but it didn't change his salvation and I look at the same in my own experience with this young man and how with him I see I would love to see him come back because his life will change but there are others that just Prosper they just seem to prosper in their sins they live wrong things just seem to get better they they they they start living worldly they start sinning they start doing all of these things but then they continue to prosper and and everything is good in life and I wonder and we are not a judge and I'm not a judge but are these people truly Sons and Daughters of God that are prospering in sin I can't judge neither can you but I know that my Bible says that more are the children of Darkness than the children of the light so there are many people that they are not called of God they're not chosen of God Hebrews 6 says it is impossible for those who have once been enlightened who have tasted of the Heavenly gift who have shared in the Holy Spirit have tasted of the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age and who have fallen away to be brought back to repentance to their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and putting him to an open shame we need to look at ourselves I was I was uh on a flight and I was not happy we were delayed and delayed and delayed so finally I get on my flight to head from St Louis to Phoenix and I land and I'm late and I'm thinking okay I got 15 minutes to get to my next flight I get all my stuff I I I I get out of the plane and I'm taking and I'm running and I go I'm going about a quarter mile down down the uh the Phoenix Airport and I'm cruising I'm looking and I look down and my shoes untied and I'm like oh no I don't have time to tie it just please don't let me step on it and fall in front of all these people so so I'm running and I get on the on the the the moving walkway and I'm going there and I'm thinking I'm really cruising now I'm making up time I get there and I and I turn the corner and I get to the gate and there's this lady and I said I'm on this flight she said the doors are closed and I was faced with a decision did I do what my flesh was wanting me to do and let her have it and I paused and uh for once I did the right thing I'm sure my face was red I I know I was red because I was running um but and sweating um and I said uh and she says oh why were you [Music] late I was in the air on your airline and she says well there's no more flights to Tucson I'm in Phoenix middle of the night there's no more flights to Tucson you're going to have to wait till tomorrow morning and I said okay um thanks what do I need to do now but I wanted to I wanted to my flesh wanted to let her let her have it do you remember when I brought Moses fryo up here and I had him stand and I said what kind of a tree is he I said he's this and he's that but then I put an apple in his hand now what kind he said oh he's an apple tree it was because of the fruit that Moses had and it's the same with all of us I can say I'm a Christian I can I can I can get up here and preach and I can do all these things but what fruit am I bearing what is me talking to that lady I I did I was upset but let it go there's nothing she could have done the door is closed she can't reopen it I understood that wouldn't have been her her fault but the fruit so then I got to go I went to the hotel and and stayed it was middle of the night I was like 1 12 it was like no it wasn't 12 yet because I went there and and there was a young lady I was in the hotel and she had a birthday balloon there and I said uh I said whose birthday is it and she says well it's mine she says well actually in like 20 minutes 30 minutes It'll be my birthday and I said oh it's mine too and she oh so we were born on the same day and and and I got to talk to her about the Lord so so the Lord honored it then in chapter 7 we we heard about this mzc and how there are things going on in other dimensions that we don't understand and this man MDC he actually the Bible says he resembled he looked like the Son of God he looked like Jesus and we go back to to Moses and how he desired to see the glory of God and God put him in in a CFT of a rock and then he walked by and it was a man that walked by and then we see in the Book of Daniel and how they went to the fiery furnace and the Nebuchadnezzar the king looks in there and they have Shadrach mesach and Abednego and there was a fourth one in there and he says oh it looks like the Son of God so who was this and MDC was that priesthood and he was this I believe this man Jesus before he became flesh in the Child Jesus it was another manifestation I gave some testimonies about how that can happen now Hebrews chapter 8 now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum most modern translations say this is the main point of what we are saying so everything that I just went to went through all of my way too long preamble to this it all has a point now the main point of what we are saying is this we have such a high priest who is set at the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty in Heavens in the heavens a minister of the sanctuary and of the Tabernacle which the Lord pitched and not man so Moses was in the wilderness I talked about the the tent that they they built and and he's saying saying here he says no but but this tent Moses built and he followed the instructions of God but this is a tabernacle that's built without hands what does he mean by that for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices whereof it is of a necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer for we for he for if he were on Earth he should not be a a priest seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law who serve under the example in the shadow of the Heavenly things as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the Tabernacle for see saith he that thou make all things according to the pattern shown to thee on the mount so Moses so God gave Moses the directions he's the blueprints he said here's how you build the Tabernacle but now hath he obtained a more excellent Ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better Covenant which was established upon better promises this is a very strange statement we are talking about the word of God here the Old Testament is just as much the word of God as the New Testament so how could this author I believe is Paul of the book of Hebrews how could he say that there is something there is a better Covenant than the word of God for if that first Covenant had been faultless then should no place have been sought for the second the author is talking about the law he's talking about Exodus um Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy he's talking about the law that was brought to Moses with all the rules and the regulations of of of learning all these things and doing all these things according to God's word so what was the fault brother Ed was there fault in God's word God's word was eternal so how could there be fault in the word of God some of it like the Ten Commandments God wrote with his own finger so how could it be wrong how could there be fault in that for finding fault with them he saith behold the days come sayeth the Lord when I will make a New Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah so he doesn't he's not finding fault with the law he's not finding fault with God's word he's saying that there's fault in the people that they're the ones that messed up now the author is going to quote a beautiful wonderful prophecy that I would I would like to finish on and he says this he says he's quoting Jeremiah 31 he says not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt we're talking about when he brought them across the Red Sea because they continued not in my Covenant and I regarded them not sayeth the Lord so the first Covenant when on Mount Sinai when when Moses brought the law the Commandments of God they immediately sinned the people did so he's still he has the Ten Commandments and he hadn't even got to the bottom of the mountain yet and they were already sinning and they just continued on they continued on failing you I was thinking and I was I was reading this and I was thinking of of all the rules and regulations and I was thinking could anyone have lived according to this law and I think they could have I really do I think that they could have lived the letter of the law but no one did so it wasn't that God's law was weak or that it somehow wasn't good enough the problem was in unbelief verse number 10 for this is the Covenant that I will make it's quoting Jeremiah for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days sayeth the Lord I will put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts and I will be to them a God and they shall be to me a people and they shall not teach every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying no the Lord for All Shall know me from the least to the greatest for I will be merciful under their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities while I remember no more this was not the case in the Old Testament God was constantly reminding the people you did this at Kadesh barnea you did this at Mount Si you did this in the Book of Judges you did all of this but now somehow he won't remember those sins anymore more everything is turned from failure in the Old Testament not God's word God's word was perfect but the people's failure it went from failure into the Old Testament to success in the New Testament it's amazing how the things change and in that he saith a New Covenant he hath made the first and a new Co a New Covenant he hath made the first the first old the first one he made old now that which decayeth and waxist old is ready to vanish away English Standard Version says obsolete the New Covenant was made obsolete does that mean that God's word is obsolete no but it wasn't a success in the people because they didn't believe it and they sinned and I'll finish with this so how could we have a very plain set of rules and regulations to live in the Old Testament and then we go over to the New Testament and there are no rules and no regulations anymore like I mentioned Tammy the the lady I just said her name the lady that I that I knew that was going to all these churches and she said well this one says I have to do this and this and I do that I just want somebody who cares about me and now we see that we have a high priest who does care for us who is able to intercede in there so we see that that Jesus came and he says they were like you did away with the law Jesus is like I didn't do away with the law he says I fulfilled the law Jesus Christ all of this Old Testament became this Old Testament became flesh in the man Jesus Christ so God looked down and he says this Bible that was written with all these different prophets here is the manif estation of what that was a perfect human being so then we go on and we see that that there is rest in this man Jesus and and there is this this wonderful success of that we can overcome and how much do we love him and how much does he love us and there's all of this love and there's there's all of this this this evangelism going out and the gospel is spreading there was none of that in the Old Testament either it was just one race of people and then it exploded and went all over so what was the difference what happened was this man Jesus who was a personification of the law he died for our sins Rose from the grave it's an amazing thing he said I can lay down my life and I can take it up again Jesus Christ himself he was dead he was dead in the grave Jesus Christ himself said I'll take it back up and here comes life back into that body for his none of us could do that nobody's ever been able to do that but Jesus could do it and then that life Jesus goes up and ascends as it says here to the right hand of God and then that same life it comes down and it dwells in this Tabernacle of Flesh that was not made with hands me you I wasn't made with hands God made me I it wasn't there's no blueprint to me there's no there's no poles and and and sides and all that I am that so he comes in and like the shikina of Glory that we come down in the holy of holies Here Comes This Spirit of Jesus Christ and it comes into a human being the same spirit that Jesus had now the law is obsolete because the the law now is in me and I don't have to look up well now what sacrifice do I make here the law becomes flesh in me and now I know and it tells me every answer to every question that I need for the Sisters is it okay to wear this is it okay to wear that what does the Holy Spirit tell you you shouldn't need a preacher to tell you those things what you need is a preacher like this book of Hebrews to say here's where it is here's what Jesus does and when he comes into you when he comes into your your flesh and you are filled with that Holy Spirit you will be able to answer those questions because it's God answering them and it's everything from what do I eat to to what job how do I act on the in in in the in the airport when I'm running my shoes tie untied and I'm mad and I get there and I said I'm ready for my plane oh here comes the Holy Spirit out don't say it don't do it there was the law manifested in the flesh and I didn't and it's not always a Meek and contrite spirit Jesus walked in up to the temple and he turned over the tables and he was aggressive in that way and sometimes the Holy Spirit requires that but it's every single SLE thing every single question that you have if you have that Spirit it will be answered I can help in pointing you to the word I can help in showing you what the Bible says as this book of Hebrews does but the main thing is that God promised that I will write those laws upon the heart let me read it again oh it's beautiful listen to this for this is a covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days sayeth the Lord I will put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts and will be to them a God and they shall be to me a people and they shall not teach every man his neighbor I don't have to tell you everything I don't have to show you here's this Rule and that rule and this is how long your skirt should be or you shouldn't wear this or you or or or your hair should be like this that's the Holy Spirit job I can show you where it is in the Bible but then that spirit that is within you it will answer those questions it's beautiful and it's a promise right here that's not only written in Jeremiah but here it is in Hebrew showing that this is alive today now I will put my laws into their minds oh and then my spirit will interpret to them what they need to know the musicians can come for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness when I sin and I do God will forgive me he'll take care of it for me and their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more how wonderful is that statement and it's a promise from God my sins I look back there's plenty of them I sin every day I mess up every day because I put my in front of God's word I put myself in front of that spirit I don't listen to that still Small Voice that speaks to me but then God knows that I'm human and he comes in but there is repentance in me as Hebrews 6 I believe it says that if there's no repentance then there's no hope but there's repentance in me because I feel bad and I want to make things right and if I say say something wrong to somebody I'm going to come on I'm going to say I'm sorry and then God no matter how bad I feel no matter how dumb I feel no matter what what I've done God goes up and he says no I don't know anything that you've done all I see is my son Jesus Christ because that is the spirit that dwells in this Tabernacle not made with hands it is the spirit of Jesus Christ that is leading us from everything to church renovations to what car we drive to how to how we dress to when we go to church to to how I pray there is a point in all of it in Hebrews 7 I mean I'm sorry Hebrews 8:1 it says now the things which we have spoken this is the sum this is the point of all those things and it is that Jesus Christ dwells in this Tabernacle of Flesh do you believe it brothers and sisters it's a promise how we should I mean how we should think about how we should just Rejoice that this is not the Old Testament that there is a spirit of God it's called the holy spirit that came down and promised that if I will just believe if I will repent if if I will be baptized if I will do these things in the name of Jesus Christ that that same Jesus Christ will come down and dwell within me and then I can have my questions answered it's not easy we have to desire God but I'll tell you I would rather have God answering my questions than anyone else on this Earth because he is perfect he never made a mistake I'm so grateful I'm so grateful for that prophecy of Jeremiah I will write my word on their hearts and in their minds words we're always thinking about that and then like with this lady that I witnessed to or that that um that called out one day that the Lord delivered from smoking I can say what does the Holy Spirit tell you and how you act where you go to church where you how you dress what you look like what does the Holy Spirit tell you about this scripture because we have the same spirit I have the spirit of Jesus Christ in me and it's the same Spirit that's in you and as I read in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 before he he has different works for all of us and he gives us each different gifts but the one thing that it it comes to the peak is that it is all capped in love love is the Capstone love is the greatest how could he say I show you a more excellent way though I speak with tongue of men and angels and have not love I am nothing it all is Capp there amen don't you want to have that Spirit don't you want the spirit of Jesus Christ to dwell within you then there's no questions then you don't have to worry there's always hope there if things go bad say Lord I know it's it's you it's okay I know that you're working this out for my good I may have caused this I may have made a mistake but I know it's you everything's going to be all right because you know me and you've got your hand on me and this Spirit that's within me it communicates with that Spirit that's in heaven and I just know everything's going to be all right everything will be fine Dani Falling In Love With Jesus Falling in Love with jus
