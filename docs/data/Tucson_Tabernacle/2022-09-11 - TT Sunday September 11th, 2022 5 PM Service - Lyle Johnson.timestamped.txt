[31:48] everyone for his
[31:50] prayers
[31:51] safe traveling mercies i think he said
[31:53] over 3000 miles so sound like they were
[31:56] really enjoying themselves i was
[31:58] starting to think of their kind of home
[32:00] bodies they might get up there and
[32:01] realize they didn't want to be traveling
[32:03] too much and it was wore them out but
[32:05] nina said they were really enjoying it
[32:07] so that's
[32:08] really good to hear and
[32:10] glad they were able to see some
[32:12] wonderful things in god's creation and
[32:14] so forth
[32:15] amen let's just stand this evening
[32:18] this thing jesus breaks every fetter

[32:31] feather
[32:35] brother peter mcfadden jesus breaks

[33:06] i will never doubt my
[33:08] savior i will never
[33:13] doubt
[33:15] my
[33:16] savior
[33:20] i will never
[33:22] ever
[33:34] [Music]
[33:50] amen it's good to be here in the house
[33:52] of the lord
[33:54] i think of that one that said lord i
[33:55] believe help thou my unbelief
[33:57] so i can't in myself
[34:00] promise this
[34:02] but by his grace i believe that he'll
[34:04] take care of us and help us just a
[34:06] little praise that we're thinking about
[34:09] today there was a someone on the counter
[34:11] left a bottle of lotion
[34:13] and it was the kind of lotion that we
[34:15] used to put on abel when he was young
[34:16] because he had really
[34:18] really dried up skin and it was really
[34:22] just something that
[34:24] was a big burden for us when he was
[34:26] young was he had really bad skin we had
[34:28] to put this lotion on and we we just
[34:30] asked the lord
[34:32] to heal him
[34:33] and we've forgotten
[34:36] that this isn't a part of our lives to
[34:38] to deal with that dry skin he has good
[34:40] skin
[34:41] the lord answered that prayer and you
[34:43] know
[34:44] we're so quick to forget sometimes all
[34:46] the things that the lord's done for us
[34:48] but
[34:49] the only reason we're here the only
[34:51] reason we're
[34:52] here with the right mind
[34:55] is by his grace this this world is crazy
[34:58] and we always say that we focus on that
[35:00] but
[35:01] here's a people that are
[35:02] in their right mind that have the mind
[35:04] of christ that love the lord jesus that
[35:06] loving one another
[35:08] what a blessing
[35:10] what a thing to thank the lord for to
[35:12] say my brother my sister is still
[35:14] standing

[35:17] and through his blood let's just thank
[35:19] him

[41:29] amen thank you so much
[41:32] good evening
[41:34] so good
[41:35] to be back in the presence of my
[41:37] brothers and sisters the family of jesus
[41:39] christ
[41:42] it's a privilege to be assembled
[41:43] together
[41:44] it's an honor
[41:46] it's an honor you know we know that
[41:48] today marks the 21st anniversary of a
[41:51] brutal attack on our nation
[41:54] by some people that hated us
[41:57] hated what we stood for as a nation
[41:59] despised those of us who were christians
[42:03] people whose interpretation of their
[42:05] religion taught them to kill those that
[42:07] don't believe the way that they do is
[42:08] doing god a service
[42:10] a service for which they will receive
[42:12] eternal life
[42:13] offsetting the penalties of their sins
[42:16] earning salvation
[42:17] through violence
[42:19] against others
[42:21] the attack was a wake-up call from
[42:22] complacency
[42:24] living in a society with a false
[42:26] sense of safety
[42:28] yet today we see increasing violence on
[42:30] our streets our schools our
[42:32] neighborhoods
[42:33] a deterioration of respect for life
[42:37] the loss of respect for others we heard
[42:39] the sermon this morning about respect
[42:41] for god
[42:43] a nation deeply divided being bombarded
[42:45] with a constant stream
[42:47] of commentary masquerading as truth
[42:50] by peddlers of influence
[42:53] it's a sad time
[42:54] it's a dark time
[42:56] it's an increasingly dangerous time
[43:00] but tonight
[43:02] i want to speak not of the attack in
[43:04] 2001 but of another day
[43:06] i want to speak of a day that's the
[43:08] greatest day
[43:09] in the history
[43:11] of our planet
[43:12] a day of hope
[43:15] i trust it will be an encouragement to
[43:17] you but before we approach the word
[43:20] let's approach the author together
[43:22] lord jesus
[43:24] it is such a humbling experience
[43:27] to be standing before those that you
[43:29] have purchased with your blood
[43:31] not because i'm anyone because you've
[43:33] purchased me
[43:34] by that same blood
[43:37] but lord jesus says we're here together
[43:39] to worship you to hear from you lord we
[43:41] pray that you would speak to us lord i
[43:43] ask that you set me aside forgive me
[43:46] lord of the sin the unbelief in my life
[43:49] the weakness the timidity the the the
[43:53] the cowardice lord
[43:55] and just help me lord to
[43:57] share what you've placed i believe in my
[44:00] heart and help those that are here that
[44:02] hear to hear through the ears that you
[44:05] want them to hear to hear what you want
[44:08] said lord we commit the remainder of
[44:10] this service to you and we thank you so
[44:12] much for the privilege we have to be
[44:14] together
[44:15] we ask these things
[44:17] in the name of our lord and our savior
[44:20] jesus christ that name above all names
[44:23] amen
[44:26] tonight
[44:27] we're going to be sharing about faith
[44:29] about hope
[44:31] about knowledge and revelation
[44:33] about the cross
[44:35] and the tomb
[44:36] and about an obscure participant
[44:39] who made one of the most profound
[44:41] statements of faith in the gospels
[44:44] if not in the entire bible
[44:46] one whom we don't often think of and
[44:48] generally don't think much of
[44:51] but our first topic versus while we're
[44:53] standing in respect of the word are
[44:55] found in the gospel of saint luke the
[44:57] 24th chapter
[44:59] the context is on the afternoon of that
[45:01] first easter sunday two were walking
[45:05] from jerusalem
[45:07] to emmaus
[45:09] emmaus let's join them for for a few
[45:12] minutes as they as they walk along we
[45:14] read in luke 24 starting at verse 13 and
[45:16] behold two of them
[45:18] who
[45:19] followers of jesus
[45:21] went that same day
[45:23] the first easter
[45:25] the day of the resurrection of jesus
[45:28] to a village
[45:29] called emmaus which was from jerusalem
[45:31] about three score furlongs you don't
[45:34] have to look at your apple watch to see
[45:35] how much that is that's about seven
[45:38] miles approximately so it's a two or
[45:40] three hour walk over hilly terrain
[45:44] and they talk together of all those
[45:46] things that had happened the events of
[45:48] the past few days during the passover
[45:50] commemoration in jerusalem
[45:53] and it came to pass
[45:55] that while they communed together while
[45:56] they discussed while they talked and
[45:58] reasoned
[45:59] jesus himself
[46:01] drew near
[46:03] and went with them
[46:05] so we see two people walking along
[46:08] they're discussing what they saw what
[46:10] they heard a third person a stranger to
[46:13] them they think joins them on the path
[46:15] and starts walking with them
[46:18] uh those of you that have been to
[46:20] heather's in my house you've probably
[46:22] seen this picture hanging on the wall
[46:23] that was painted by a good friend of
[46:25] ours from a photograph but this is what
[46:28] we believe to be the site of emmaus you
[46:30] can see the ruins in the foreground of a
[46:32] fourth century church there was a a
[46:34] baptistery and a and a mosaic there and
[46:37] brother arne you may recall that it was
[46:39] in an upper room there that we had
[46:40] communion in 1976 with brother greene
[46:43] and the and the tour that came through
[46:45] my my brother paul lived in the
[46:47] sub-basement of this building for a few
[46:49] years and we went there trying to fix
[46:51] this place up
[46:52] uh it's in the valley of iolan you may
[46:54] recall joshua 10 12 when the sun stood
[46:58] still and the moon stood still over iowa
[47:00] this is that location
[47:02] emmaus
[47:06] their eyes were holden
[47:07] that they should not know him in other
[47:10] words they didn't recognize him
[47:12] jesus is so often throughout the bible
[47:15] was now in a different theophany
[47:19] and jesus said unto them
[47:20] what manner of communications are those
[47:23] that you have one to another as you walk
[47:26] and are sad
[47:28] the niv reads he asked them what are you
[47:31] discussing together as you walk along
[47:33] and they stood still their faces
[47:36] downcast i want you to take a good look
[47:39] here in your mind's eye
[47:42] these two people are downcast
[47:44] they're sad
[47:46] jesus is walking next to them on the
[47:48] most triumphant day of his ministry
[47:52] and they're sad
[47:54] and one of them
[47:55] whose name was cleopas
[47:57] answering said unto him
[48:00] are you only a stranger in jerusalem and
[48:03] haven't known the things which have come
[48:04] to pass here in these days
[48:07] cleopas seems a bit taken aback that
[48:10] anyone coming on the road from jerusalem
[48:14] could be ignorant of the events that
[48:16] this stranger must have overheard them
[48:18] discussing
[48:20] reading on and jesus said to them
[48:23] what things
[48:24] and they said unto him concerning jesus
[48:27] of nazareth which was a prophet mighty
[48:30] in deed and word before god and all the
[48:33] people and and how the chief priests and
[48:35] our rulers delivered him to be condemned
[48:38] to death
[48:39] and have crucified him
[48:41] but we trusted
[48:43] other translations read
[48:45] had hoped
[48:47] that it had been he which should have
[48:49] redeemed israel and beside all this
[48:52] today is the third day
[48:54] since these things were done
[48:57] trusted
[48:59] had hoped
[49:01] had been
[49:02] it's all past tense
[49:05] now they're without that hope they're
[49:07] sad
[49:09] they're downcast
[49:10] they saw jesus as a prophet
[49:13] now deceased
[49:15] read more of this encounter in a bit
[49:17] read another couple of places before
[49:19] we're seated this time from a letter
[49:20] that paul wrote hebrews chapter 11 the
[49:22] first couple of verses it's very
[49:23] familiar to us now faith is what
[49:27] foolishness or ignorant or silly people
[49:30] karl marx's opiate of the people to help
[49:32] them live their miserable lives
[49:35] no
[49:36] faith is a substance it's real
[49:39] of things hoped for
[49:42] so it starts with hope no hope
[49:45] no faith we had hoped
[49:47] the evidence of things not seen
[49:50] for by it by faith by that substance of
[49:53] hope the elders obtained a good report
[49:56] and through faith rather than our
[49:58] physical eyesight and natural intellect
[50:01] we understand the worlds were framed
[50:03] by the word
[50:05] of god
[50:06] so that things which are seen the
[50:08] physical universe around us
[50:10] were not made of things which do appear
[50:14] and finally the gospel of john the first
[50:16] chapter what paul's epistle is referring
[50:19] to regarding the creation
[50:22] we read in the beginning was the word
[50:26] and the word was with god
[50:30] no no not only that the word was god
[50:33] the same was in the beginning with god
[50:35] and all things were made by him that's
[50:37] exactly what we just read in hebrews
[50:40] without him was not anything made that
[50:42] was made
[50:43] skipping down to 14 the word that is to
[50:47] say god
[50:48] jehovah the invisible creator that paul
[50:51] wrote of was made flesh
[50:54] and dwelt among us
[50:56] and we beheld his glory the glory as of
[50:59] the only begotten or
[51:01] could be interpreted uniquely begotten
[51:04] of the father
[51:05] full of grace
[51:07] and truth
[51:08] speaking we know of jesus
[51:11] please be seated
[51:15] to help provide some context for this
[51:18] for the next few minutes
[51:20] i'd like us to try and imagine a world
[51:24] without cars
[51:26] without electricity
[51:28] no indoor plumbing
[51:30] microwave ovens
[51:32] no internet no computers
[51:34] not even telephones
[51:36] no radio
[51:37] television movies no documentaries
[51:41] no hollywood no books
[51:44] no advertising
[51:46] no walmart no costco no amazon no trains
[51:49] no planes
[51:51] a world where almost everyone worked
[51:53] hard
[51:54] talking physical labor
[51:57] every day just to scrape by
[51:59] to get enough to eat
[52:01] your home is probably made of mud brick
[52:04] or perhaps if you're fortunate it might
[52:06] be made of stone there's no heating in
[52:08] the winter there's certainly no air
[52:10] conditioning or evaporative cooling in
[52:12] the summer
[52:13] this is a hot place where you live
[52:16] simple clothing it's usually homemade
[52:18] there's no brand names or labels
[52:22] straightforward sandals no enclosed
[52:24] shoes no heels
[52:26] no socks
[52:29] if you are what we think of his school
[52:30] age if you're a child
[52:32] there's no school
[52:34] as soon as you're old enough you go out
[52:35] there and work in the fields to help
[52:37] grow the food to feed your family
[52:40] dawn to dusk
[52:42] rain or shine
[52:43] hot or cold
[52:45] and every so often
[52:47] a soldier comes by
[52:49] not one of your countrymen but an
[52:50] invader a foreigner who's conquered your
[52:53] territory he's got his weapons with him
[52:55] and he demands and takes what he wants
[52:57] from your meager provisions whatever he
[53:00] wants he takes
[53:03] and if you don't want to give it to him
[53:06] you risk injury
[53:08] captivity
[53:09] or even death
[53:12] welcome to judea
[53:14] you've been told all your life god is
[53:16] merciful he'll deliver you and your
[53:18] neighbors from these invaders he's
[53:20] stronger than they are but every day you
[53:22] see the invaders are still there
[53:25] on your sabbath day
[53:27] one day a week you're able to go to a
[53:30] we'd think of it as a church a synagogue
[53:32] and hear someone read from a scroll
[53:35] you're told to memorize these words
[53:38] meditate on them
[53:40] you can't read or write and even if you
[53:42] could you couldn't afford a scroll
[53:45] for generations
[53:47] you and your ancestors have been told to
[53:49] meditate on these writings beginning
[53:51] with words that came through a prophet
[53:53] named moshe moses some 15 centuries
[53:57] before
[53:59] the parts you find easiest to remember
[54:02] are called psalms
[54:03] they're poetry
[54:05] there's music melody rhythm to them that
[54:07] you can hear in your mind it helps you
[54:10] remember
[54:12] a famous king named david wrote many of
[54:15] them
[54:16] but that was about a thousand years ago
[54:19] and his kingdom that was promised to be
[54:20] everlasting was split by a civil war 40
[54:23] years after his death
[54:25] its territory was completely overrun and
[54:27] conquered by assyrians and babylonians
[54:30] within 400 years
[54:32] the holy temple was utterly destroyed
[54:35] lay in ruins for almost a century before
[54:38] your ancestors were allowed to repair it
[54:41] allowed
[54:42] by a foreign conqueror
[54:45] yours have been a conquered people for
[54:48] some 600 years a number too big and a
[54:51] time too long to have much meaning to
[54:52] you
[54:53] an uprising a century or two ago led by
[54:56] a fellow called you to maccabee resulted
[54:58] in a brief period of self-rule but it
[55:00] quickly turned into a fractious power
[55:02] struggle
[55:04] and a few decades the romans swept it
[55:06] all up and installed a puppet ruler a
[55:08] collaborator named herod
[55:10] some 70 years prior
[55:13] but recently
[55:15] there's been a young preacher named
[55:17] yeshua
[55:18] wandering about the region of galilee
[55:20] and speaking about hope
[55:22] and peace
[55:23] and love
[55:25] he's gathered a following there are many
[55:27] reports of miracles especially of
[55:29] healings
[55:30] even some stories if you can believe
[55:33] them of dead people rising up from their
[55:35] death beds or even in a funeral
[55:37] procession
[55:39] his students his disciples
[55:41] include simple folk
[55:43] like fishermen
[55:45] not rabbinical students not priests not
[55:47] levites
[55:49] none of the elite pay much attention to
[55:51] this fellow
[55:52] at least one of his group is a member of
[55:54] the zealot party advocating violent
[55:57] overthrow of the government
[55:59] another
[56:00] disgustingly as a collaborator with the
[56:02] hated roman occupiers a publican no less
[56:06] one who steals money from everyone under
[56:08] the guise of taxes
[56:11] the worst kind of trader to his own
[56:13] people
[56:15] yeshua this fellow we know is jesus
[56:18] seems to get much of his financial
[56:20] support from a group of women of means
[56:24] what's up with that
[56:26] well let's turn now
[56:28] to an event fairly early in jesus
[56:30] ministry
[56:31] as recorded
[56:33] in mark chapter 4
[56:35] matthew
[56:36] chapter 8.
[56:44] jesus is taught by the seaside it's the
[56:46] lake side really of the canarit
[56:50] this picture to your left is a is a view
[56:52] of the canary what we read as being the
[56:54] sea of galilee
[56:57] it's mostly a shallow lake the deepest
[56:59] part is 144 feet but the surface of this
[57:02] lake is 600 feet below sea level the
[57:04] lowest place we have in america is about
[57:05] 120 feet below sea level this is 600
[57:08] feet below sea level
[57:10] it gets hot there
[57:13] it's in a deep valley that runs
[57:14] basically north to south you can see in
[57:16] this photograph from space there's the
[57:18] sea of galilee there's the dead sea
[57:20] jerusalem would be about there
[57:24] but what happens here is there's often a
[57:26] confluence of winds you have cold air
[57:28] coming from mount hormone the
[57:29] snow-covered slopes to the north hot air
[57:32] coming up from 1200 feet below sea level
[57:35] to 600 coming up from the dead sea you
[57:37] get winds coming off the mediterranean
[57:39] that's only 30 miles away and really hot
[57:42] winds home seem we called them when we
[57:44] lived in israel coming from the deserts
[57:47] of saudi arabia and so forth to the east
[57:51] and this confluence of winds often leads
[57:54] to sudden storms
[57:56] the lake can have waves over 10 feet
[57:58] high
[57:59] that appear
[58:00] without warning
[58:02] there's no weather wrap on your
[58:03] smartphone to warn you there's no
[58:07] eas tones to give you a national weather
[58:10] service advisory
[58:12] well let's let's join them now we've
[58:13] we've got the setting here
[58:16] mark 4 verse 35. the same day
[58:19] when evening was come jesus said unto
[58:22] them his small group of students his
[58:24] disciples let's pass over to the other
[58:26] side
[58:27] let's cross the lake
[58:30] jesus has been sitting in a boat near
[58:32] the edge of the lake
[58:33] teaching the people when jesus stands up
[58:36] he might be reading or preaching but
[58:37] when he sits down he's teaching
[58:40] and when they had sent away the
[58:42] multitude the large crowd that had
[58:43] gathered to hear him speak over the
[58:45] sound of the breaking waves on the
[58:46] lakeshore without the benefit of an av
[58:48] system
[58:50] they took him even as he was in the ship
[58:53] the small boat from which he had been
[58:55] addressing the crowd
[58:56] and there were also with them other
[58:58] little ships you think ships what do we
[59:01] think of as a ship we think of something
[59:02] that crosses the ocean now these this is
[59:05] what they mean by ships you can see it's
[59:07] relatively small maybe 20 feet long
[59:10] three or four people can manage the
[59:12] whole thing
[59:13] there's no keel it has very shallow
[59:14] draft this is a first century ship that
[59:16] was recovered from the sea of galilee
[59:18] and it's in a museum people standing by
[59:20] you can get an idea of the size
[59:23] so jesus is in a small lake boat there's
[59:26] other small watercraft as well it's a
[59:29] fishing village
[59:30] area so
[59:32] with that
[59:33] that picture in your mind let's read on
[59:35] let's see what happened it says there
[59:37] arose a great storm of wind
[59:41] later in the bible we hear of a rushing
[59:44] mighty wind and the waves beat into the
[59:47] ship
[59:48] so that it was now full
[59:50] it's going to capsize
[59:53] remember
[59:54] some of these disciples made their
[59:55] living on this very lake
[59:58] so this is one of those storms that
[1:00:00] comes up very quickly it's violent it's
[1:00:02] especially dangerous in a small craft
[1:00:04] like this with shallow draft
[1:00:07] these men of the lake didn't see it
[1:00:08] coming they didn't say whoa lord we see
[1:00:10] a cloud rising let's wait until tomorrow
[1:00:12] to cross the lake no they were crossing
[1:00:14] the lake
[1:00:16] the waves were high enough that even
[1:00:18] these experienced boat men turning the
[1:00:20] craft to face the waves to minimize the
[1:00:21] amount of water that would come in or to
[1:00:23] prevent the thing from flipping over
[1:00:26] they're dealing with water that's filled
[1:00:28] the interior of the boat
[1:00:32] and jesus
[1:00:34] was in the back of the ship the hinder
[1:00:35] part
[1:00:36] asleep
[1:00:39] asleep
[1:00:40] he must have been weary
[1:00:43] completely exhausted
[1:00:45] drained remember how brother branham
[1:00:48] said sometimes they had to virtually
[1:00:49] carry him off the platform after a
[1:00:51] healing service
[1:00:53] we have no record of this day having
[1:00:55] been one of healings but whatever the
[1:00:56] cause
[1:00:58] jesus is exhausted
[1:01:00] he's sleeping resting on some sort of a
[1:01:02] cushion or a pillow
[1:01:04] and they awake him
[1:01:07] that must have taken some doing
[1:01:09] the boat's being tossed about the wind
[1:01:12] is howling the waves are crashing
[1:01:15] there's cries of fear
[1:01:17] people are in danger of losing their
[1:01:19] lives on a wickedly violent sea and
[1:01:23] is asleep
[1:01:25] but somehow they're able to rouse him
[1:01:28] and they say to him
[1:01:29] master
[1:01:31] rabbi teacher is the meaning of the word
[1:01:33] carest thou not that we perish
[1:01:35] how can you sleep we need help don't you
[1:01:38] realize we're in danger of losing our
[1:01:40] lives including you
[1:01:42] wake up lend a hand help us keep this
[1:01:44] boat afloat
[1:01:46] there's great fear here
[1:01:50] and
[1:01:51] what happens
[1:01:53] and and jesus arose oh
[1:01:56] it was a deep sleep it wasn't like he
[1:01:58] was instantly
[1:01:59] awake
[1:02:00] he's not a magic guy he's a human being
[1:02:04] oh oh
[1:02:05] so taking a moment to see then he
[1:02:08] rebuked the wind
[1:02:10] and he said
[1:02:11] unto the sea
[1:02:13] peace
[1:02:14] be still
[1:02:16] and the wind ceased
[1:02:19] and there was a great calm
[1:02:24] and jesus
[1:02:26] said to his small student group
[1:02:29] why are ye so fearful
[1:02:33] is it
[1:02:34] that you have no faith
[1:02:38] now jesus is clearly aware of their
[1:02:40] extremity he names it fear
[1:02:43] but he says a very curious thing how is
[1:02:46] it you have no faith
[1:02:48] why is there no evidence of your hope
[1:02:50] your confidence in god
[1:02:53] again we note they were fearful
[1:02:56] but now they've been delivered
[1:02:59] they should be rejoicing
[1:03:01] right
[1:03:02] they should be happy i i remember that
[1:03:04] time i've told you the story when we
[1:03:06] were coming from israel and the plane
[1:03:08] lost compression to 747 at 40 000 feet
[1:03:11] we went to a steep dive into the
[1:03:13] mountains of what was in yugoslavia
[1:03:16] people were screaming and fearful when
[1:03:18] the plane leveled out
[1:03:21] people stopped screaming they stopped
[1:03:23] being fearful they were really quite
[1:03:24] happy
[1:03:26] okay so these guys should be happy
[1:03:28] they've just been rescued
[1:03:31] so let's read the next verse we'll see
[1:03:33] what happens after the calming of the
[1:03:35] storm they were fearful and now they
[1:03:38] feared a little
[1:03:41] their fear ceased
[1:03:42] no
[1:03:43] now they feared exceedingly
[1:03:48] their fear increased
[1:03:51] they said one to another
[1:03:53] what
[1:03:54] manner of man is this
[1:03:58] who is this guy in the boat with us
[1:04:00] that even the wind and the sea obey him
[1:04:06] it's a good question
[1:04:09] but why the extreme heightened fear
[1:04:12] after miraculous rescue by a person that
[1:04:15] they've seen perform miracles on a
[1:04:16] regular basis
[1:04:19] maybe
[1:04:20] perhaps they recalled a passage from the
[1:04:23] tanakh
[1:04:24] the bible of jesus day
[1:04:27] a section of scripture perhaps
[1:04:29] that raised an alarm within them
[1:04:36] remember
[1:04:37] these people could not read nor write
[1:04:40] the knowledge of the scriptures that
[1:04:41] they possess is what they memorized
[1:04:44] what they recalled
[1:04:46] so why moses told them to meditate day
[1:04:48] and night recite the words of the law in
[1:04:51] the morning at noon at night repeat
[1:04:53] repeat repeat repetition drive it into
[1:04:56] your mind drive it into your heart don't
[1:04:58] forget so that you don't sin against god
[1:05:02] david writes in the 119th psalm starting
[1:05:06] at verse 9.
[1:05:07] he says wherewithal or how shall a young
[1:05:10] man cleanse his way how shall a young
[1:05:12] man live a clean life
[1:05:15] by taking heed
[1:05:17] according to thy word
[1:05:20] david writes with my whole heart have i
[1:05:22] sought thee let me not wander from thy
[1:05:24] commandments
[1:05:26] how
[1:05:27] thy word
[1:05:29] have i hid in mine heart
[1:05:32] not in my cell phone
[1:05:34] that i might not sin against thee
[1:05:37] blessed art thou o lord teach me thy
[1:05:41] statutes he goes on with my lips have i
[1:05:44] declared all the judgments of thy mouth
[1:05:47] he's talking about meditation he's
[1:05:49] talking about recitation
[1:05:51] a memory aid
[1:05:53] i have rejoiced in the way of thy
[1:05:55] testimonies as much as in all riches
[1:05:58] i will meditate in i will remember i
[1:06:00] will recite i will recall thy precepts
[1:06:03] and have respect
[1:06:05] unto thy ways i will delight myself in
[1:06:08] thy statutes i will not forget thy word
[1:06:14] memory
[1:06:15] is enhanced
[1:06:17] through repetition
[1:06:19] i recall learning the gettysburg address
[1:06:21] when i was in grade school
[1:06:23] i would read it
[1:06:25] recite it
[1:06:26] go back and reread then recite with my
[1:06:29] brothers or my parents listening to
[1:06:31] correct me and repeat until i knew it
[1:06:34] all
[1:06:35] 272 words
[1:06:37] years later
[1:06:38] i still knew it
[1:06:40] today
[1:06:42] no
[1:06:42] not so much
[1:06:44] i haven't meditated on it to remember it
[1:06:47] to rehearse it in my mind for many years
[1:06:51] well as i mentioned earlier
[1:06:53] in jesus day the people knew the
[1:06:55] scriptures
[1:06:56] by memory
[1:06:58] paul tells us faith comes by hearing the
[1:07:00] word people couldn't read that's how
[1:07:02] you're going to expose yourself to the
[1:07:04] word is by hearing it
[1:07:06] and frankly
[1:07:08] it seems to me sometimes our ability to
[1:07:10] read has lessened our ability to
[1:07:11] remember because we can grab the book we
[1:07:14] can refer to it
[1:07:17] okay
[1:07:19] so what happens
[1:07:21] let's get back to that just calmed storm
[1:07:24] on the lake
[1:07:26] why did the level of fear
[1:07:28] increase with these men
[1:07:31] why weren't they rejoicing in their
[1:07:33] salvation from that storm
[1:07:35] i think they recalled a psalm
[1:07:38] psalm 89
[1:07:40] verse 6 says for who in heaven
[1:07:44] can be compared
[1:07:46] unto the lord who among the sons of the
[1:07:48] mighty can be likened
[1:07:50] unto the lord as you know the psalms are
[1:07:52] poetry is the kind of poetry that's a
[1:07:54] doublet
[1:07:55] a phrase is made and another phrase with
[1:07:57] the same meaning repeats it to reinforce
[1:07:59] it its couplets its pairs
[1:08:02] god is greatly to be fair feared in the
[1:08:04] assembly of the saints and to be had in
[1:08:07] reverence of all them that are about him
[1:08:11] o lord of hosts
[1:08:12] who is a strong lord like unto thee or
[1:08:16] to thy faithfulness round about thee
[1:08:19] thou
[1:08:20] rulest the raging of the sea
[1:08:23] when the waves thereof arise
[1:08:26] thou
[1:08:27] stillest them
[1:08:30] they sang this probably pretty much like
[1:08:32] we sing he is the master of the wind
[1:08:36] thou rulest the raging of the sea
[1:08:40] they had just witnessed a fulfillment of
[1:08:43] psalm 89 9.
[1:08:46] they knew that only god the lord jehovah
[1:08:49] the one they worshiped could speak to a
[1:08:51] storm on the sea and still it
[1:08:55] but they also knew
[1:08:56] god is a spirit
[1:08:58] but this was a man
[1:09:00] that spoke
[1:09:02] fear
[1:09:04] confusion
[1:09:06] what
[1:09:06] manner of man
[1:09:08] is this
[1:09:10] they confess the shema here o israel the
[1:09:13] lord our god
[1:09:15] the lord is one
[1:09:18] how could this guy in the boat
[1:09:20] somehow be god himself it just doesn't
[1:09:23] make sense
[1:09:25] so they feared greatly after that storm
[1:09:28] was calmed what manner of men is this oh
[1:09:30] we know from the psalms only god himself
[1:09:32] can do this this man was just napping in
[1:09:34] the boat with us and asked us about our
[1:09:36] faith and then ruled over the raging sea
[1:09:39] and still
[1:09:42] what's going on
[1:09:45] confused
[1:09:46] fearful well let's move on
[1:09:50] a few months later in jesus ministry the
[1:09:52] scene here jesus is walking down the
[1:09:54] road with his disciples and they're
[1:09:56] talking
[1:09:57] right passing the time as you walk
[1:09:59] together
[1:10:00] among friends right this is a very
[1:10:02] familiar passage to us it's recorded in
[1:10:05] three of the gospels matthew's account
[1:10:07] is the most complete so let's listen in
[1:10:09] now on matthew 16 beginning at verse 13.
[1:10:13] when jesus came into the coasts of
[1:10:15] caesarea philippi
[1:10:17] coast is again king james it just means
[1:10:19] the borders it got to the city limit
[1:10:21] sign that said entering caesarea
[1:10:23] philippi elevation so and so founded
[1:10:25] such and such a time he asked his
[1:10:27] disciples saying whom do men say that i
[1:10:30] the son of man am
[1:10:32] and they said oh some say you're john
[1:10:34] the baptist
[1:10:36] some elias some jeremias or one of the
[1:10:40] prophets
[1:10:42] he said unto them well whom say ye that
[1:10:46] i am
[1:10:48] and simon peter answered and said
[1:10:50] thou art the christ you're the anointed
[1:10:53] the son of the living god
[1:10:55] and only matthew records this next part
[1:10:58] jesus answered and said unto him
[1:11:00] blessed art thou
[1:11:02] simon bar jonah flesh and blood have not
[1:11:04] revealed it unto thee but my father
[1:11:06] which is in heaven
[1:11:08] i say also unto thee that thou art peter
[1:11:10] and upon this rock
[1:11:12] i will build my church the gates of hell
[1:11:14] shall not prevail against it
[1:11:16] we've heard this many times the rock the
[1:11:18] revelation of who jesus is
[1:11:22] but a revelation to be revealed if you
[1:11:24] think of a statue and you pull the cloth
[1:11:26] off and it's revealed but do you still
[1:11:28] really understand the statue
[1:11:30] you can see it
[1:11:32] it's been revealed it's been exposed
[1:11:35] did peter really grasp at that time
[1:11:39] that revelation
[1:11:40] he did later
[1:11:42] but if he or any of the others
[1:11:45] really understood
[1:11:47] would they have abandoned him in
[1:11:48] gethsemane
[1:11:50] did they really understand that he was
[1:11:52] not simply the anointed one the christ
[1:11:56] that he wasn't just a specially selected
[1:11:59] human
[1:12:00] when he later said i and my father are
[1:12:03] one if you've seen me you've seen the
[1:12:05] father he said to philip have i been so
[1:12:07] long with you
[1:12:09] did they really understand
[1:12:13] now we know on the day of pentecost
[1:12:15] peter really had the revelation
[1:12:17] and the understanding of what was
[1:12:19] revealed to him of who jesus was
[1:12:23] i love peter's first sermon
[1:12:25] we'll take just one line of it the the
[1:12:27] punch line the climatic statement that
[1:12:29] led to the conversion of three thousand
[1:12:34] we could spend considerable time on just
[1:12:36] this one verse and i put fresh batteries
[1:12:38] in the in the microphone here but but
[1:12:40] i'll try not to run them down so we'll
[1:12:42] just read this one verse from acts 2 36
[1:12:44] therefore let all the house of israel
[1:12:47] know what sure ridley
[1:12:48] based on the things that i just told you
[1:12:52] there can be zero doubt
[1:12:54] that god hath made that same jesus
[1:12:58] whom ye have crucified
[1:13:00] both lord and christ
[1:13:05] lord if this were in hebrew and said to
[1:13:07] greek it would be in all capitals not
[1:13:09] just one anointed by god but the god who
[1:13:12] anointed
[1:13:13] god himself
[1:13:15] in human flesh
[1:13:17] so human that that body could
[1:13:19] and did die
[1:13:23] but
[1:13:26] we could spend all night on just a
[1:13:28] little couple verses of acts too but i
[1:13:30] no lie don't do that we spoke here one
[1:13:32] evening a few months ago
[1:13:34] about confession
[1:13:36] that paul had people imprisoned
[1:13:38] and even killed for the simple statement
[1:13:42] jesus is lord
[1:13:44] because the claim was capital l o
[1:13:48] r d
[1:13:49] the claim was that jesus was jehovah
[1:13:54] that was what the religious leaders of
[1:13:56] his day were upset with jesus about to
[1:13:58] the point they had him killed in a most
[1:14:00] brutal fashion we read in john 10. jesus
[1:14:03] is speaking to these folks and he says i
[1:14:05] and my father are one
[1:14:08] well they knew exactly who he meant when
[1:14:10] he said father
[1:14:12] then the jews took up stones again
[1:14:15] to stone him
[1:14:16] to kill him by throwing rocks at him
[1:14:20] smashing his body breaking his bones
[1:14:23] jesus answered them many good works have
[1:14:25] i showed you from my father
[1:14:28] for which of those works
[1:14:31] do you stone me
[1:14:33] the jews answered him saying for a good
[1:14:35] work we stone thee not
[1:14:38] but for blasphemy
[1:14:40] because of thou being a man
[1:14:43] maketh thyself
[1:14:45] god
[1:14:48] you
[1:14:49] being a man
[1:14:50] make yourself god
[1:14:52] the ultimate blasphemy
[1:14:55] unless of course it's the truth
[1:14:58] the fulfillment of isaiah's prophecy
[1:15:00] that they knew very well
[1:15:02] isaiah 9 verse 6 reads
[1:15:05] unto us
[1:15:07] the jewish people yes a child is born
[1:15:12] a human baby
[1:15:14] a man a person
[1:15:16] unto us a son is given the government
[1:15:18] shall be upon his shoulder and his name
[1:15:19] shall be called wonderful
[1:15:22] counselor
[1:15:23] the mighty
[1:15:25] god
[1:15:27] the everlasting
[1:15:29] father
[1:15:31] the prince of peace
[1:15:34] of the increase of his government and
[1:15:35] peace there shall be no end
[1:15:39] upon the throne of david and upon his
[1:15:42] kingdom to order it and to establish it
[1:15:44] with judgment and with justice from
[1:15:46] henceforth even forever it's not talking
[1:15:49] about kicking the romans out
[1:15:51] how is this going to be done
[1:15:53] the zeal
[1:15:55] of the lord of hosts will perform this
[1:15:59] there was great certainty in isaiah's
[1:16:02] prophecy
[1:16:03] it's one thing to study something
[1:16:05] centuries old
[1:16:10] think well someday this is going to
[1:16:11] happen discuss it ponder it interpret it
[1:16:14] teach that interpretation keep it at
[1:16:17] some distance
[1:16:18] it's quite another
[1:16:20] to witness it
[1:16:21] realize that if you are witnessing as
[1:16:24] true
[1:16:25] then all that theology
[1:16:27] understanding
[1:16:29] and teaching
[1:16:30] was wrong
[1:16:32] if what you're seeing is really it
[1:16:35] after all
[1:16:36] we saw in acts 2 36 peter by then
[1:16:39] realized it and risked his life to tell
[1:16:41] it
[1:16:42] to preach it to a crowd
[1:16:46] and instead of retribution
[1:16:48] instead of a riot bringing the roman
[1:16:50] soldiers to restore peace
[1:16:53] there was instead a revival
[1:16:55] 3 000 were added
[1:16:58] the church in jerusalem was suddenly 20
[1:17:01] times larger than it had been that
[1:17:03] morning
[1:17:05] why was that sermon so powerful
[1:17:10] no
[1:17:11] i'll be here all night if i talk about
[1:17:13] that as much as we focus on peter there
[1:17:16] was another disciple that had that
[1:17:18] realization
[1:17:20] the understanding
[1:17:22] of peter's revelation
[1:17:24] perhaps before peter did
[1:17:26] he was certainly the first to
[1:17:28] unequivocally state it in the gospels
[1:17:32] go back with me to that first easter
[1:17:34] we were with those gentlemen walking
[1:17:37] down the road to emmaus let's go earlier
[1:17:39] in the day
[1:17:40] before sunrise
[1:17:43] there was a disciple
[1:17:45] confused
[1:17:47] not understanding but determined to go
[1:17:50] and see jesus prophecy fulfilled
[1:17:53] on that third day
[1:17:54] that he would rise from the dead
[1:17:57] and went to the tomb and who was it it
[1:17:58] wasn't peter
[1:18:00] it wasn't john it wasn't james
[1:18:03] it wasn't jesus mother
[1:18:05] it was mary magdalene
[1:18:08] on this most glorious of mornings it has
[1:18:10] ever been on the crowning day of jesus
[1:18:14] ministry and life
[1:18:16] the proof and confirmation of it all
[1:18:19] that the work of the cross
[1:18:21] really had meaning
[1:18:23] was there a crowd of those who had
[1:18:24] followed him sat at his feet that had
[1:18:28] then gone out and preached the gospel to
[1:18:30] the surrounding towns and villages
[1:18:32] those who had hung on his words and
[1:18:34] believed him when he said he'd be killed
[1:18:36] but rise from the dead on the third day
[1:18:39] no
[1:18:40] they were hiding
[1:18:42] just mary
[1:18:43] a vulnerable woman
[1:18:45] one who deeply loved jesus
[1:18:48] would do anything
[1:18:50] for jesus
[1:18:52] we find her
[1:18:53] walking alone
[1:18:55] in the pre-dawn darkness
[1:18:57] an arrested city
[1:18:59] crowded with pilgrims
[1:19:01] you can be sure there were plenty of
[1:19:03] opportunists to take advantage of the
[1:19:05] crowds
[1:19:06] just mary
[1:19:08] alone
[1:19:10] out the city gates
[1:19:12] down a dark path illuminated only by the
[1:19:14] moon
[1:19:15] into a cemetery
[1:19:17] to a tomb
[1:19:19] a crypt
[1:19:21] sealed with a massive stone
[1:19:24] guarded by soldiers
[1:19:26] let's go to john 20 verse 1.
[1:19:29] the first day of the week cometh mary
[1:19:31] magdalene early when it was yet dark
[1:19:34] under the sepulcher and see if the stone
[1:19:37] taken away from the sepulchre we talked
[1:19:39] about that before this particular
[1:19:41] phrasing means that it was tilted it was
[1:19:43] out of place it hadn't been rolled away
[1:19:47] and she runs and comes to simon peter
[1:19:49] into other disciples we know is john
[1:19:52] and said to them they've taken away the
[1:19:54] lord
[1:19:55] master
[1:19:57] out of the sepulcher
[1:19:58] and we know not where they have laid him
[1:20:02] we know peter and john hurried to the
[1:20:04] tomb they went inside they saw the grave
[1:20:06] clothes
[1:20:07] no body
[1:20:09] no jesus
[1:20:11] no angels
[1:20:12] no earthquake
[1:20:14] nothing
[1:20:16] they left the site returned to the group
[1:20:18] of mourners
[1:20:20] in hiding
[1:20:21] fearful
[1:20:22] skipping now to verse 11. but mary
[1:20:25] remained she stood without it means
[1:20:27] outside of the sepulcher
[1:20:29] she'd stoop she looked it
[1:20:31] she was weeping
[1:20:33] she didn't hurry away with peter and
[1:20:34] john with the safety of being
[1:20:36] accompanied by these two men returning
[1:20:38] back into the city
[1:20:39] she was alone she was in great sorrow
[1:20:42] more sorrow than we've seen in these
[1:20:44] past few days at the passing of queen
[1:20:46] elizabeth
[1:20:47] and as she wept
[1:20:49] she stooped down
[1:20:51] and looked into the sepulcher
[1:20:55] and saw two angels peter and john didn't
[1:20:57] see them
[1:20:58] two angels in white sitting the one at
[1:21:00] the head and the other at the feet were
[1:21:02] the body of jesus at lane
[1:21:04] remember
[1:21:06] when jesus went to the home of jairus
[1:21:08] his daughter had died people were
[1:21:11] mourning jesus said she's asleep they
[1:21:13] laughed he said get everybody out of
[1:21:15] here i don't want any unbelief around me
[1:21:18] and raised her from the dead here we
[1:21:21] have peter and john and they had to
[1:21:23] leave
[1:21:25] mary was still there
[1:21:28] and we see
[1:21:30] what they say to her woman
[1:21:34] why weepest now
[1:21:36] she said unto them they've taken away my
[1:21:38] lord
[1:21:39] i don't know where they've laid him
[1:21:42] and when she had thus said she turned
[1:21:44] herself back she couldn't continue the
[1:21:45] conversation she was overcome
[1:21:48] and she saw this guy standing it was
[1:21:50] jesus but she didn't know that
[1:21:53] and jesus said to her exactly the same
[1:21:55] thing the angels had said
[1:21:57] woman
[1:21:58] why weepesta
[1:22:00] whom seek us thou
[1:22:02] lady
[1:22:02] you're so sad why are you crying
[1:22:05] are you looking for someone
[1:22:08] she supposing him to be the gardener
[1:22:11] i love that the second adam was thought
[1:22:13] to be a gardener and the first adam's
[1:22:15] job was to be a gardener but she's this
[1:22:18] this person she thought was the gardener
[1:22:19] turns to him and said sir
[1:22:21] if you've taken his body from here tell
[1:22:24] me where you've laid him and i'll take
[1:22:26] him away
[1:22:28] jesus said to her
[1:22:31] mary
[1:22:33] she turned herself and said to him
[1:22:36] rabboni which is to say master robonai
[1:22:38] is a very personal thing it's not rabbi
[1:22:41] it's rabona my master my teacher
[1:22:45] she saw him knew he was jesus
[1:22:49] but didn't really understand who he was
[1:22:53] not yet
[1:22:54] my teacher
[1:22:56] jesus said to her touch me not i'm not
[1:22:59] yet ascended to my father but go to my
[1:23:01] brethren and say unto them that i ascend
[1:23:03] to my father and your father to my god
[1:23:06] and your god
[1:23:09] mary magdalene
[1:23:11] came and told the disciples
[1:23:14] that she had seen the lord the master
[1:23:16] the teacher and that he had spoken these
[1:23:18] things unto her
[1:23:20] but they didn't believe her
[1:23:22] mark confirms that mary magdalene was
[1:23:24] the first to see him in mark 16 verse 9
[1:23:26] we read now when jesus was risen early
[1:23:29] on the first day of the week he appeared
[1:23:31] first to mary magdalene out of whom he
[1:23:34] had cast seven devils
[1:23:36] and she went and told them that had been
[1:23:38] with him as they mourned and wept
[1:23:41] and they when they had heard that he was
[1:23:43] alive and had deceit of her
[1:23:45] believe not
[1:23:46] rejected her testimony they're in
[1:23:48] mourning they're sad
[1:23:50] they're downcast
[1:23:52] not recalling
[1:23:53] or perhaps choosing not to believe what
[1:23:55] he'd told them several times that he'd
[1:23:58] lay down his life and take it up again
[1:24:00] he'd be killed even to the specific
[1:24:02] death of crucifixion and he would rise
[1:24:04] from the dead on the third day after his
[1:24:06] death
[1:24:09] such a thing had never happened
[1:24:11] we read that peter and john went to the
[1:24:13] tomb they didn't see jesus
[1:24:15] or even any angels
[1:24:17] mary magdalene returned to the tomb with
[1:24:19] the other mary another gospel says and
[1:24:21] jesus appeared to the two of them and
[1:24:23] they were allowed to touch him at that
[1:24:25] time
[1:24:26] another group of women joanna with
[1:24:28] others with the anointing spices came to
[1:24:30] the tomb and saw angels but
[1:24:32] didn't see jesus
[1:24:35] it was only
[1:24:37] mary magdalene
[1:24:39] or ones that were accompanying mary
[1:24:42] magdalene that saw jesus that morning
[1:24:46] if you were not with mary magdalene that
[1:24:48] morning you did not see the risen lord
[1:24:51] jesus
[1:24:53] what an honor
[1:24:55] what a recognition of faith and how
[1:24:57] hurtful
[1:24:59] to be disbelieved by those you'd walked
[1:25:01] with for so many months
[1:25:03] across so many miles
[1:25:06] those who knew you
[1:25:08] how could they doubt you about something
[1:25:10] so momentous
[1:25:12] what rejection
[1:25:14] isolation
[1:25:16] humiliation
[1:25:19] you're just distraught deer
[1:25:21] none of the brothers saw him
[1:25:24] here have a cup of tea it'll soothe you
[1:25:28] well let's move on to that afternoon
[1:25:29] again back to emmaus the road where we
[1:25:31] started this evening
[1:25:33] luke 24 we'll we'll start again at verse
[1:25:35] 19. jesus said unto them
[1:25:37] what things
[1:25:39] they said unto him concerning jesus of
[1:25:42] nazareth which was a prophet mighty
[1:25:44] indeed in word before god and all the
[1:25:46] people and how the chief priests and our
[1:25:48] rulers delivered him to be condemned to
[1:25:50] death and have crucified him
[1:25:58] but we trusted that had been he which
[1:26:00] should have redeemed israel
[1:26:03] and beside all this today is the third
[1:26:05] day since these things were done
[1:26:09] and then they continued the narrative
[1:26:12] and yeah and certain women also of our
[1:26:14] company made us astonish which were
[1:26:16] early at the sepulcher we've moved up
[1:26:18] from three days ago the events that have
[1:26:20] made them sad
[1:26:22] to that very morning
[1:26:24] and when they found nada's body they
[1:26:26] came saying that they had seen a vision
[1:26:28] of angels which said that he was alive
[1:26:32] as you can see the story has changed
[1:26:34] just a little bit here that's how it
[1:26:35] happens and you repeat things to people
[1:26:37] and repeat things
[1:26:39] and certain of them which were with us
[1:26:40] which we know were peter and john went
[1:26:42] to the sepulcher and found that even as
[1:26:44] the women had said but they didn't see
[1:26:46] him
[1:26:50] this point
[1:26:51] jesus has had quite enough
[1:26:53] he said unto them o fools
[1:26:56] slow of heart to believe all that the
[1:26:58] prophets have spoken
[1:27:00] ought not christ who have suffered these
[1:27:02] things and to enter into his glory
[1:27:07] and beginning at moses and all the
[1:27:09] prophets he expounded unto them and all
[1:27:11] the scriptures the things concerning
[1:27:13] himself
[1:27:16] don't you find it striking
[1:27:18] what the two
[1:27:19] were telling jesus
[1:27:21] he asked them what happened why are you
[1:27:23] so sad
[1:27:24] and they talked about the arrest and the
[1:27:26] crucifixion and the death of this
[1:27:29] prophet
[1:27:30] who they thought was the messiah
[1:27:33] but
[1:27:34] sadly
[1:27:35] apparently he wasn't
[1:27:37] he was dead
[1:27:39] you see they were sad because they were
[1:27:41] looking at the cross and not accepting
[1:27:43] not realizing
[1:27:45] what the cross meant
[1:27:47] because they didn't really understand
[1:27:49] who jesus was
[1:27:51] they didn't understand
[1:27:54] who jesus is
[1:27:56] so on that day of days
[1:27:59] they were reflecting on his death
[1:28:02] not his life
[1:28:04] and then what then they told him the
[1:28:06] testimony of the women regarding the
[1:28:08] empty tomb that some of the brothers had
[1:28:10] gone to verify and saw the empty tomb
[1:28:12] but didn't see jesus if jesus were
[1:28:14] really risen he would have appeared to
[1:28:16] peter and john when they went with mary
[1:28:18] she must have been distraught emotional
[1:28:20] it's all just too much for her poor mary
[1:28:24] so they discounted the testimony of the
[1:28:27] women even though they heard testimony
[1:28:29] from reliable witnesses of his
[1:28:31] resurrection they refused to believe it
[1:28:34] not too surprising i guess such a thing
[1:28:36] had never happened
[1:28:38] but if they only held jesus to be a
[1:28:40] prophet just a guy with a special gift
[1:28:42] they could discount the reports
[1:28:44] that they said
[1:28:46] left them astonished
[1:28:49] but as i said at this point jesus had
[1:28:52] had quite enough
[1:28:54] so he upgraded them he scolded them for
[1:28:57] rejecting both the testimony of the
[1:28:59] women and thus of his own foretelling of
[1:29:02] the very thing that the women's
[1:29:03] testimony confirmed
[1:29:05] when they rejected their lady's
[1:29:07] testimony they were rejecting jesus own
[1:29:10] testimony about himself
[1:29:13] he then led them through the scriptures
[1:29:15] patiently instructing and teaching
[1:29:18] not holding a king james bible and going
[1:29:21] from page to page not reaching into
[1:29:23] somebody's backpack and pulling out a
[1:29:25] scroll and reading it
[1:29:27] not doing a search on the internet
[1:29:30] but reciting
[1:29:32] from memory
[1:29:33] that's how they knew the scriptures in
[1:29:35] that day
[1:29:37] he led them through it all
[1:29:39] reminded them of things written of the
[1:29:40] messiah
[1:29:42] he could do this with them because they
[1:29:44] were devout jews they had committed many
[1:29:46] portions of the bible of their day to
[1:29:48] memory they were familiar with the word
[1:29:51] they might not have understood it
[1:29:54] after they realized who we was we know
[1:29:56] the story they ran back several miles to
[1:30:00] jerusalem
[1:30:02] and knew exactly where to find the
[1:30:03] disciples who were hiding
[1:30:06] referred to as the eleven
[1:30:09] as they were exchanging these stories
[1:30:10] thomas apparently left the assembly
[1:30:12] because we're told elsewhere that when
[1:30:14] jesus appeared thomas was absent
[1:30:17] let's read carefully what happened next
[1:30:20] luke 24
[1:30:22] verse 36
[1:30:26] and as they cleophus and his companion
[1:30:29] thus spake jesus himself stood in the
[1:30:31] midst of them and said unto them
[1:30:33] peace
[1:30:34] be unto you hebrew shalom
[1:30:38] they were terrified and affrighted
[1:30:41] supposedly they had seen a spirit
[1:30:44] it wasn't wow
[1:30:46] jesus it's true you're alive
[1:30:48] it's ah
[1:30:50] what's happening
[1:30:52] he said unto them why are you troubled
[1:30:55] why do thoughts arise in your hand and
[1:30:58] your hearts
[1:30:59] and he said
[1:31:00] behold my hands
[1:31:03] my feet
[1:31:05] it's i myself handle me and see touch me
[1:31:09] a spirit doesn't have flesh and bones as
[1:31:11] you see me have
[1:31:13] and when he had thus spoken he showed
[1:31:15] them his hands and his feet
[1:31:17] and while they yet believed not for joy
[1:31:20] and wondered
[1:31:22] this isn't the modern i wonder if that's
[1:31:24] really true but this is the wonder as in
[1:31:26] awe amazement astonishment
[1:31:29] in other words they're so overcome with
[1:31:31] joy that they can hardly believe their
[1:31:33] senses they're just amazed in john 20 20
[1:31:36] it says they were glad
[1:31:39] notice they didn't believe it was him
[1:31:41] until he showed them his wounds
[1:31:45] he said unto them have you hear any meat
[1:31:48] they gave him a piece of broiled fish
[1:31:50] honeycomb he took it he ate it he said
[1:31:53] these are the words that i spake unto
[1:31:55] you i told you about this beforehand
[1:31:57] don't you remember while i was yet with
[1:31:59] you that all things must be fulfilled
[1:32:01] which were written in the law of moses
[1:32:03] and the prophets and the psalms
[1:32:05] concerning me
[1:32:07] then opened he their understanding that
[1:32:10] they might understand the scriptures
[1:32:12] i suspect for cleopas and his
[1:32:15] and his partner who i originally thought
[1:32:17] might have been named eor but i don't
[1:32:18] think so anymore that the two of those
[1:32:20] that had just come from emmaus it must
[1:32:22] have seemed like a replay
[1:32:25] jesus said i am the way
[1:32:28] the truth
[1:32:29] and the life
[1:32:31] no man comes to the father
[1:32:33] but by me
[1:32:35] why
[1:32:37] because he is the father we just read
[1:32:39] that in isaiah
[1:32:41] and according to his own testimony to
[1:32:43] the jewish leaders
[1:32:45] i and my father are one
[1:32:48] but they they still didn't understand
[1:32:50] that
[1:32:51] at least we have no record of any of
[1:32:53] them saying they did
[1:32:56] they would make such a declaration on
[1:32:57] the day of pentecost some 50 days later
[1:33:01] but not then
[1:33:03] john's account starts out the same
[1:33:07] john 20 verse 19
[1:33:10] then the same day and evening
[1:33:12] being the first day of the week when the
[1:33:14] doors were shut where the disciples were
[1:33:16] assembled for fear of the jews came
[1:33:19] jesus and stood in the midst and saith
[1:33:20] unto them peace be unto you shalom allah
[1:33:25] and when he had so said he showed unto
[1:33:28] them his hands and his side
[1:33:31] then were the disciples glad
[1:33:33] a bit of an understatement after what we
[1:33:35] just read in luke
[1:33:37] when they were glad when they saw the
[1:33:39] lord
[1:33:40] and again this
[1:33:41] version of the word lord does not
[1:33:42] necessarily imply deity
[1:33:46] so here again we're told they're glad
[1:33:48] they're full of joy when they see him
[1:33:51] but there's no declaration of the
[1:33:53] revelation of who he really was
[1:33:55] that they really understood
[1:33:58] in fact in the first chapter of acts
[1:33:59] they're asking him if he's going to
[1:34:01] restore israel at that time you're going
[1:34:02] to kick the romans out now
[1:34:04] the then current perspective they still
[1:34:06] had in their head about what the messiah
[1:34:08] would do
[1:34:09] but let's let's read on let's get down
[1:34:11] to verse 24.
[1:34:15] we read but thomas
[1:34:17] one of the twelve
[1:34:18] called didymus did he miss means twin we
[1:34:21] don't know if he had a twin sibling or
[1:34:23] maybe he was a lookalike to one of the
[1:34:24] disciples maybe he was a look-alike to
[1:34:27] jesus we don't know but thomas was not
[1:34:29] with them when jesus came
[1:34:32] the other disciples therefore said unto
[1:34:34] him we have seen the lord the same
[1:34:35] testimony that they had rejected of the
[1:34:37] women they are now giving to jesus
[1:34:40] or giving to thomas but but he said to
[1:34:42] them
[1:34:43] except i shall see in his hands are
[1:34:45] printed the nails and put my finger in
[1:34:46] the front of the nails and thus my hand
[1:34:48] into his side i will not believe i want
[1:34:50] the same experience you had
[1:34:53] he was still skeptical
[1:34:54] for whatever reasons and he's asking for
[1:34:57] the same thing that jesus had offered
[1:34:59] okay after eight days
[1:35:02] again his disciples were within
[1:35:05] and thomas was with them
[1:35:08] then came jesus the doors being shut and
[1:35:10] stood in the midst and said peace be
[1:35:12] unto you shalom allah this is exactly
[1:35:15] the same set up as it happened eight
[1:35:17] days earlier
[1:35:19] then saith he to thomas because he had
[1:35:21] already said it to the others
[1:35:23] reach hither thy finger behold my hands
[1:35:26] reach hither thy hand thrust into my
[1:35:28] side be not faithless but believing the
[1:35:30] same thing that he had said to the
[1:35:32] others eight days earlier
[1:35:34] and look at thomas's response
[1:35:38] thomas answered and said unto him
[1:35:41] my lord
[1:35:42] and my god
[1:35:45] and my god
[1:35:48] deity
[1:35:49] thomas had a revelation and understood
[1:35:52] at that moment who jesus really was
[1:35:56] not just a messiah an anointed prophet
[1:35:59] but god himself
[1:36:02] no record that he touched jesus maybe he
[1:36:05] did only that he proclaimed that jesus
[1:36:07] was more than a teacher a prophet or
[1:36:09] god's unique son that he was in fact god
[1:36:13] himself thomas was a jew he had been
[1:36:16] taught from birth that there is but one
[1:36:19] god and this is the first time
[1:36:22] in the gospel accounts that any of the
[1:36:25] disciples
[1:36:26] called jesus god
[1:36:28] the first time that any disciple called
[1:36:31] jesus deity
[1:36:34] jesus said unto him thomas because
[1:36:36] you've seen me you've believed
[1:36:39] blessed are they that have not seen and
[1:36:41] yet have believed blessed are they that
[1:36:43] will accept the word of the testimony
[1:36:46] it seems that thomas
[1:36:48] one of the disciples we hear almost
[1:36:50] nothing about other than his name
[1:36:52] was likely the first to realize and
[1:36:55] actually comprehend who jesus was
[1:36:59] he's mostly known for his doubt we speak
[1:37:01] of doubting thomas
[1:37:03] and not his declaration
[1:37:06] brother branham used him as an example
[1:37:08] of a person who needs a sign or
[1:37:10] something other than the word to believe
[1:37:12] and have faith
[1:37:14] this was eight days after the
[1:37:15] resurrection it was 42 days
[1:37:18] before pentecost
[1:37:20] my lord
[1:37:22] and my god
[1:37:23] it was personal
[1:37:25] my
[1:37:26] lord and my god
[1:37:29] making it very clear that when thomas
[1:37:31] saw the risen lord jesus
[1:37:33] he realized
[1:37:35] he was in the presence of jehovah
[1:37:38] peter would later preach it
[1:37:40] paul would later persecute anyone making
[1:37:43] that very declaration
[1:37:44] then go on to declare it himself
[1:37:46] preaching with the same zeal that he had
[1:37:48] previously persecuted with
[1:37:50] now you may argue and say no no no peter
[1:37:53] really had the full understanding of his
[1:37:55] resolution revelation of who jesus was
[1:37:57] before thomas
[1:37:58] or that all the other nine did after
[1:38:00] jesus taught them the first time that he
[1:38:02] appeared and you may be correct
[1:38:05] but the real point
[1:38:08] the really important thing
[1:38:11] is if you
[1:38:12] individually
[1:38:13] like peter
[1:38:14] and like thomas have not just a
[1:38:17] revelation but the revelation and
[1:38:19] understanding of the revelation of who
[1:38:23] jesus is
[1:38:26] and that you have entered into a right
[1:38:28] relationship with jesus christ
[1:38:31] the very god that created all things
[1:38:35] very few people even among christians
[1:38:38] recognized that jesus was god in flesh
[1:38:41] not one-third of a committee of three
[1:38:43] beings
[1:38:44] the same one who walked in the garden
[1:38:46] with adam and eve who wrestled with
[1:38:48] jacob spoke with moses met with abraham
[1:38:52] time and again appeared in the old
[1:38:53] testament in forms we call theophanies
[1:38:57] the musicians would please come at this
[1:38:59] time thank you
[1:39:00] hebrews 13 8
[1:39:02] tells us that jesus christ is the same
[1:39:06] we're told elsewhere that god does not
[1:39:08] change
[1:39:09] that jehovah of the old testament is
[1:39:12] jesus of the new
[1:39:14] that the holy spirit is the indwelling
[1:39:16] christ in us as temples his body on
[1:39:19] earth
[1:39:20] do we really
[1:39:22] understand that
[1:39:23] not just to repeat it or say it or claim
[1:39:26] it as a revelation
[1:39:27] but do we really grasp
[1:39:29] christ in us
[1:39:31] the hope of glory
[1:39:33] is a portion of the god that created
[1:39:37] this universe
[1:39:39] that he loved us
[1:39:41] as a tiny portion of his vast creation
[1:39:44] to the point that he demonstrated that
[1:39:46] love to us
[1:39:47] by sacrificing himself as a human
[1:39:50] to remove
[1:39:52] not cover but obliterate our sin
[1:39:56] and restore fellowship
[1:39:58] relationship with him
[1:40:01] we read some this evening about mary
[1:40:03] magdalene how her testimony was rejected
[1:40:06] how it must have hurt her having taken
[1:40:09] such a personal risk to go to the tomb
[1:40:11] that morning
[1:40:12] how must jesus feel
[1:40:15] if we reject his testimony
[1:40:17] his gift to us provided at such personal
[1:40:20] cost i'd like us to to pray together one
[1:40:24] more time
[1:40:26] lord jesus
[1:40:27] we thank you for your word
[1:40:30] lord and i pray that each of us
[1:40:33] myself included
[1:40:34] would have a true grasp a true
[1:40:36] understanding
[1:40:38] of the revelation of who you
[1:40:41] are
[1:40:42] and lord that we all would have such a
[1:40:45] relationship with you that we can walk
[1:40:47] with you
[1:40:48] and talk with you that you will guide us
[1:40:50] that you will lead us we can depend on
[1:40:52] it not be fearful like the disciples
[1:40:54] what manner of man is this but we know
[1:40:57] what manner of man this is
[1:40:59] lord i thank you for this time that we
[1:41:01] could share together
[1:41:03] lord i just pray that you'd help your
[1:41:04] word to sink deep in our hearts to take
[1:41:06] root and to grow
[1:41:08] we love you lord jesus we love you and
[1:41:11] we thank you

[1:41:39] compassion for our sister you're welcome
