[7:06] thank you
[7:27] thank you
[7:54] I read this story I put myself in that
[7:57] armor Bears position
[7:59] and so he's going with Jonathan
[8:02] and he tells Jonathan brother he says
[8:05] whatever you have in your heart I'm with
[8:07] you
[8:08] so Jonathan says okay well here's the
[8:10] deal if they tell us to come up then
[8:13] we'll see it as a sign from God
[8:16] and then if they say we'll come down
[8:18] then we'll stand our ground I remember I
[8:20] wonder what that armor bear thought well
[8:22] what if they come down
[8:25] there's a bunch of those guys and
[8:27] they're big
[8:28] those guys are remember Goliath 10 feet
[8:31] tall these were big men Warriors
[8:35] and I could think the armor bear
[8:36] thinking uh
[8:39] yeah what if they come down
[8:41] Jonathan said we'll hold our ground
[8:44] we'll stay here
[8:45] so they they go up and there's two big
[8:48] rock out croppings they they go up there
[8:51] to that place and they stand up
[8:55] and they say here we are
[8:58] the Philistines looked down and they say
[9:01] oh you finally come out of your holes
[9:02] now
[9:04] why don't you come up
[9:06] and fight us you know that armor bear
[9:08] was like yes
[9:10] I was wondering what was going to happen
[9:13] so all right Jonathan let's go so
[9:16] Jonathan goes up and in a place about it
[9:19] less than an acre of land
[9:21] they killed 20 of these Warriors just
[9:25] Jonathan and his armor Bearer great
[9:29] victory
[9:30] I can imagine what they did they had to
[9:32] climb up the Bible says that they had to
[9:35] climb hand over a hand up this mountain
[9:38] to this Garrison
[9:40] come up and start finding that I love
[9:43] Bible so much you know I just love
[9:46] reading it this isn't Jedis and
[9:49] Stormtroopers this is real
[9:52] this really happened these things in
[9:55] this book
[9:56] so they go up there they beat these 20
[9:59] men down
[10:01] and
[10:02] then
[10:04] this happens
[10:06] verse number 11.
[10:08] I'm sorry let's go to uh let's go to
[10:10] verse 13.
[10:12] and Jonathan climbed up on his hands and
[10:14] feet and his armor Bearer after him and
[10:15] they fell before Jonathan and his armor
[10:18] bear slew after him
[10:20] and then that first Slaughter which
[10:22] Jonathan and his armor Bearer made was
[10:25] about 20 men within it
[10:27] within as it were a half acre of land
[10:31] which a yoke of oxen might plow
[10:35] and there was trembling
[10:37] this is the scripture I want you to look
[10:38] at
[10:40] and there was trembling in the host in
[10:41] the field and among all the people The
[10:43] Garrison and the spoilers they also
[10:46] trembled and the earthquaked so it was a
[10:49] very great trembling
[10:52] look at the fear that swept through
[10:55] these men remember Philistines they
[10:57] weren't animals
[10:58] they were men and women like you and I
[11:00] are they had feelings
[11:03] they um then what happened is they
[11:06] started losing their mind
[11:09] fear hit these men
[11:13] they started to panic they started to
[11:15] get scared
[11:18] and they started to turn on each other
[11:23] so they're they're up there they they
[11:25] know that this these 20 people there are
[11:28] 20 of their comrades had been conquered
[11:30] by these two guys
[11:33] and they started to panic and you know
[11:36] what they did pointed I will return unto
[11:37] thee according to the time of life and
[11:39] Sarah shall have a son
[11:43] then Sarah denied
[11:46] saying I laugh not
[11:48] for she was afraid
[11:51] and he said nay but thou dids laugh
[11:55] look at what this produced in Sarah Look
[11:57] What Fear now Sarah was a very prominent
[12:02] fine lady
[12:05] upstanding she was I mean if you read to
[12:09] the Bible she was a very respected lady
[12:12] Abraham I mean if you read to the Bible
[12:14] she was a very respected lady Abraham
[12:17] obviously was a respected man but look
[12:20] what fear produced in this very special
[12:23] lady
[12:25] she made a mistake
[12:27] and she lied to cover it up
[12:31] because she feared
[12:33] how many times
[12:36] does something threaten us
[12:39] threaten our way or maybe there's a
[12:43] chance that we're going to be
[12:44] embarrassed about something
[12:47] so we get put in this position and all
[12:49] of a sudden we will lie to get our way
[12:51] out of it or lie so we don't get
[12:53] embarrassed
[12:55] you don't have to raise your hand
[12:59] but it happens
[13:02] and that's what fear produces
[13:05] fear comes in and it builds that it
[13:08] makes us lie as we know with the
[13:09] Philistines it makes us fight one
[13:11] another
[13:14] and there is no fear friends there's no
[13:17] fear in God
[13:18] so whenever we have fear we're afraid of
[13:21] what's going to happen we're afraid of
[13:23] maybe changes in the church maybe
[13:26] changes in our lives
[13:28] maybe moving or staying or whatever it
[13:32] might be when you feel that fear that is
[13:35] not God
[13:36] there's concern but put it before him
[13:39] ask him what to do
[13:43] time went on you know we we see that
[13:46] throughout the Bible you can see
[13:48] throughout this Bible
[13:50] God says something very consistent
[13:53] many many times when God is speaking
[13:57] he says fear not
[14:01] don't be afraid
[14:02] until he tells Joshua he tells Moses he
[14:05] tells he tells he tells all of these
[14:07] people
[14:09] don't be afraid
[14:11] fear is not from God
[14:14] and then we fear the lord
[14:18] but that's all that we fear that's the
[14:20] beginning of wisdom because he is the
[14:22] one that can change things you know God
[14:24] he even says it even says in another
[14:27] place it says Don't Fear the ones that
[14:30] can take your life
[14:31] you know we think about I was just I've
[14:34] been watching that
[14:35] um
[14:36] deal with those college students
[14:38] and that murder
[14:40] and all that happened there is an awful
[14:43] thing that that happened in Idaho
[14:46] and I got to I got to thinking and you
[14:49] know as you know the DNA and all the
[14:51] stuff going on and you know they keep
[14:52] feeding you information so you keep
[14:54] going to the website but
[14:57] I thought did these people know the Lord
[15:01] did those three young ladies and that
[15:03] young man
[15:04] did they know God
[15:06] because that's the one that was
[15:09] important it wasn't it wasn't this evil
[15:11] man that took their lives
[15:14] it was the one that kept them away from
[15:17] Christ
[15:18] that's the big fear there
[15:22] you know and we lord the we want to be
[15:26] with you we always want to be close to
[15:29] you we want to know you and Satan is
[15:32] always throwing things that in front of
[15:34] us and making us afraid making us not
[15:38] want to come
[15:40] but I look at these girls
[15:42] and that young man
[15:44] did they know God
[15:46] I pray that they did
[15:48] they they met there in there with a very
[15:51] evil person but the Bible teaches us
[15:53] don't even fear that guy
[15:55] if you're the one
[15:57] that is able to keep us out of Out of
[16:00] Heaven
[16:02] Matthew chapter 21.
[16:06] we
[16:07] we have that these these group of men
[16:10] called the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[16:14] the herodians brother Lyle mentioned the
[16:16] essenes these different
[16:19] these different different groups
[16:22] of Judaism
[16:25] and they were afraid of anything coming
[16:29] against what they believed
[16:31] they were afraid of any type of change
[16:34] because they had their positions they
[16:36] were the ministers they were the
[16:37] preachers they had the respect among the
[16:40] people they had the money
[16:42] they were it and they didn't want to say
[16:46] any see anything come in to change what
[16:49] their quality of life was
[16:51] they were afraid of it
[16:55] Matthew chapter 21.
[16:58] verse 24 says this
[17:01] and Jesus answered and said unto them I
[17:03] also will ask you one thing he's talking
[17:05] to these people
[17:07] they asked him a question he says if you
[17:10] will tell me I and likewise will tell
[17:12] you by what Authority I do these things
[17:15] Jesus says this the baptism of John
[17:18] whence was it from heaven or from Men
[17:23] and they're reasoned with themselves
[17:25] saying if we shall say from heaven
[17:28] he will say unto us why did you not
[17:30] believe him
[17:32] but if we shall say of Men We Fear the
[17:36] people
[17:38] for all whole John as a prophet
[17:41] and listen to this cowardly answer
[17:45] because they were afraid
[17:48] they should have known
[17:50] this Jesus Christ
[17:53] was actually the Messiah that was
[17:55] promised to come
[17:57] but they didn't care what they cared
[17:59] about is their own way they cared about
[18:00] their own religion they cared about
[18:02] their own thoughts they cared about
[18:04] keeping their own positions what they
[18:07] didn't care enough about was their souls
[18:09] and they didn't care enough about The
[18:11] Souls of the people that were in their
[18:13] congregations
[18:16] and they answered Jesus and said we
[18:19] cannot tell
[18:21] and he said unto them neither tell I by
[18:23] what no to tell I you by what Authority
[18:25] I do these things
[18:27] hypocrites
[18:29] is what they were Jesus called them that
[18:34] if they had respect
[18:38] they did have the respect they had the
[18:40] power
[18:41] they had the money
[18:43] and they were going to do anything to
[18:45] keep it because that was what was
[18:46] important to them
[18:48] including threatening and killing not
[18:51] only Jesus
[18:52] but also his disciples
[18:55] they
[18:58] feared
[19:00] they feared the people they feared
[19:03] they're losing their positions fear had
[19:06] consumed these people there's fear all
[19:09] over the place today there's fear in
[19:11] these pulpits there's fear that maybe
[19:14] what I'm preaching or maybe what I've
[19:17] always preached is wrong
[19:20] there's that fear
[19:21] there's fear that
[19:24] that somebody's going to come in and
[19:27] take some of the people from this church
[19:28] and they'll go to that church
[19:30] not caring about the people
[19:33] and I'm not saying just in message
[19:35] churches are I'm not saying that I'm
[19:36] saying all over the place
[19:39] it's fear
[19:41] brother Branham said this
[19:44] Church age Book quote
[19:48] he said have you ever noticed
[19:51] how the people who lead others astray
[19:53] bind them closely to themselves by fear
[19:58] they say that if the people don't do
[20:00] what they say or if they leave then
[20:02] destruction will follow
[20:04] there are false prophets
[20:06] for a true Prophet will always lead one
[20:10] to the word and bind the people to Jesus
[20:14] Christ and he won't tell the people to
[20:16] fear Him or what he says but to fear
[20:19] what the word says
[20:22] they spread rumors
[20:25] they spread they throw out little lies
[20:29] just to keep their own Doctrine just to
[20:33] keep their own ways
[20:35] and they ignore they ignore what the
[20:38] word says
[20:42] they're they're and it's fear friends
[20:44] it's dominated by fear that's why that's
[20:48] why people do things
[20:50] you know that's that's why they lash out
[20:52] that's why you'll see a lot of times
[20:54] you'll see the different churches
[20:55] fighting with each other
[20:57] it's their fear maybe maybe I'm not
[20:59] right of course you don't say that but
[21:02] there is an inward feeling many times
[21:05] maybe I'm not right
[21:08] and you'll see like that rattlesnake
[21:10] many times they'll lash out and they'll
[21:13] bite
[21:14] but
[21:15] that's not the spirit of Christ but
[21:17] there is a way
[21:18] there is something that will overcome
[21:20] that let me get before we get there let
[21:23] me get to Matthew chapter 26.
[21:27] verse 73.
[21:33] this is Peter
[21:35] Jesus
[21:36] is going to the cross
[21:39] all the disciples were afraid
[21:42] they were terrified of what was going to
[21:44] happen they saw their leader
[21:46] just plucked up being beaten
[21:50] they feared wait a minute were we wrong
[21:52] on this
[21:54] and now they're fearing for their own
[21:56] skin and here's Peter fearing for his
[21:57] own skin it says this Matthew chapter 26
[22:01] verse 73 and after a while
[22:03] came unto him they that stood by and
[22:06] said to Peter surely Thou Art one of
[22:09] them for thy speech be writhe
[22:12] then began he to curse and swear this is
[22:17] Peter
[22:19] saying I know not the man and
[22:21] immediately the crew Peter was
[22:23] afraid and he wanted to separate himself
[22:26] from Jesus
[22:28] and the way that he did that was to
[22:31] change his way of speaking
[22:34] now we go to work go to school go to
[22:37] these different places
[22:39] what is a good way that people won't
[22:41] think I'm weird
[22:44] people won't think I'm religious
[22:47] throw a little swear word in there
[22:50] it'll separate us
[22:52] from God
[22:54] and it'll separate us God because from
[22:56] God because maybe we're afraid we're
[22:57] ashamed
[22:59] we don't want to be associated with that
[23:02] because it brings a lot of reproach
[23:05] so we'll change our way of speaking like
[23:08] Peter did
[23:11] because we're afraid
[23:13] and it causes us to sin
[23:17] you know I see
[23:20] when when our youth and all of us as we
[23:22] go to work and we want to fit in
[23:25] you know we want to be part you know
[23:28] everybody does it's natural
[23:29] and we should be we should be able to
[23:31] talk to people and and they should see
[23:34] us in a in a in a point of strength you
[23:38] know I look at uh sister Naomi they're
[23:40] telling telling the story about some of
[23:41] the work that you do and some of the
[23:43] people that you witnessed to
[23:45] and the ministry that the Lord's given
[23:47] you and talking to these people
[23:49] and I think what if Naomi what if she
[23:53] said you know what I'm going to change
[23:54] the way I look to look more like these
[23:56] people I'm going to change the way I
[23:58] talk to to talk more like this people
[24:01] that's not love for those people what
[24:04] that is is that fear of me being cast
[24:07] out
[24:08] and it's not love for the ones who might
[24:12] need it
[24:14] and now Sister Naomi's been living this
[24:17] this testimony before these people that
[24:20] she works with and she talks to and then
[24:22] when things go bad Naomi who do they
[24:24] call
[24:25] they call that pillar they call that
[24:28] point of strength if you wouldn't have
[24:31] act that way if you would have tried to
[24:32] fit in with them they would not hold you
[24:35] in that regard neither would they hold
[24:37] me in that guard or any of you in that
[24:39] regard
[24:40] because we just fit in we're just like
[24:43] everybody else
[24:45] which I'm not saying whatever
[24:49] but then you take that gift away from
[24:52] that person
[24:53] that might be in need one day
[24:57] you take that gift that they can't
[24:59] contact you and have confidence in this
[25:02] person that has lived this life of Jesus
[25:05] Christ before them
[25:08] and they don't know anybody else
[25:10] and then they contact you to pray for
[25:12] them and they have faith in your prayers
[25:15] you take that you take that away
[25:18] from the people
[25:22] they're the way
[25:25] to overcome fear
[25:28] friends there's one way to do it
[25:31] remember the little dog
[25:34] you know it was love
[25:36] when that dog saw that I loved it
[25:40] was and when I proved it
[25:42] I wasn't going to hurt it
[25:44] then it started trusting me
[25:48] it started It Started Loving Me and it's
[25:51] the same thing as we go out and we are
[25:53] among all the world
[25:57] if we treat people the same way the
[25:59] world treats each other
[26:01] how are we going to help anybody
[26:04] but if we really love the people
[26:08] then we would live this message before
[26:10] them
[26:12] we will live the life of Christ before
[26:14] these people
[26:16] and do our best to bring them together I
[26:18] think brother Bobby that back there and
[26:20] he's he's he's wanting his heart's
[26:22] desires to bring everybody together and
[26:25] Bobby's this rough tough guy if you
[26:27] don't get together I'm going to beat you
[26:28] over the head
[26:29] not really yeah you will
[26:34] but he loves them
[26:36] he loves the people you young people you
[26:39] ever talk with Bobby Wertz
[26:41] you know there's something about him he
[26:43] loves you
[26:44] and that's the way that we need to
[26:46] present ourselves all the time
[26:48] all the time to people so they can have
[26:51] confidence in US
[26:54] that when this man or when this woman
[26:56] and this boy or girl prays I have
[26:59] confidence in their prayer
[27:02] I I think about
[27:04] the scripture
[27:07] in first John
[27:09] for the Lyle I think that you may have
[27:12] preached this last Sunday
[27:15] but I think it'd be good to hear us
[27:16] again hear this again
[27:21] first John chapter 4.
[27:24] let me go back to something Paul said
[27:26] Paul said that God has not given us the
[27:29] spirit of peer of fear but of power and
[27:32] of love and of a sound mind be not
[27:35] therefore ashamed of the testimony of
[27:38] Our Lord nor the nor of me his prisoner
[27:40] but be thou partakers of the afflictions
[27:43] of The Gospel According to the power of
[27:45] God
[27:47] first John chapter 4 says this
[27:50] verse 11. beloved
[27:54] if God so loved us
[27:57] we ought to love one another
[28:00] don't fear one another
[28:02] love one another if you think somebody
[28:04] is trying to take something from you
[28:05] take a position in the church take a
[28:08] friend that you have
[28:10] or you fear that they're against them
[28:13] the Bible teaches us let them have it
[28:17] give it to them
[28:18] brother Brown preached this message
[28:20] called teaching on Moses how many have
[28:22] heard it all the youth have heard it I'm
[28:24] sure it's something that that Daniel and
[28:27] Madeline used to they listened to it
[28:29] over and over and over it's it's a it's
[28:31] a message that brother Brown preached to
[28:33] young people and
[28:35] brother Branham says this he says
[28:38] if you try to keep it
[28:40] you'll lose it
[28:41] but if you give it away then you'll keep
[28:45] it
[28:46] and it's the same with these when when
[28:48] somebody tries to take something from us
[28:50] or somebody comes against us let them
[28:53] have it
[28:54] and you'll find that you'll come out a
[28:57] lot better in the end I know and and uh
[29:00] at work I've been successful over the
[29:03] years in management because the way that
[29:07] I do things is is I might have an idea
[29:09] or might be working towards something or
[29:12] get a job or get it going we'll get it
[29:14] we'll we'll get it going on the right
[29:16] direction get it successful and then
[29:20] I'll give it to somebody else
[29:22] and then they can take it maybe to a
[29:25] place that I couldn't have taken it
[29:27] before
[29:28] and that's the way that we do with
[29:30] everything don't ever be afraid to give
[29:32] something up
[29:34] because God might have something better
[29:36] for you or more important for you I've
[29:39] seen people fail and then for the young
[29:42] people when as you as you move through
[29:43] life I've seen people fail so much
[29:45] there's this thing called job security
[29:49] don't get ever caught up in that
[29:53] because you know what if you're gonna
[29:54] have job security you know where you'll
[29:55] stay right there in that job
[29:58] and you won't do any better you'll never
[29:59] get better
[30:01] but if you can help somebody else
[30:04] to maybe do that job and if somebody's
[30:06] trying to take it from you
[30:09] let them have it and you'll find that
[30:11] that's the kind of person that the
[30:13] supervisors and the bosses want and that
[30:16] person will move up
[30:19] and that's
[30:21] how I've had some successes in life and
[30:24] that's really
[30:26] and it's not rocket science
[30:29] it's done that get it going give to
[30:33] somebody that can really do a good job
[30:36] verse 12.
[30:38] no man has seen God at any time if we
[30:41] love one another God dwelleth in us and
[30:43] his love is perfected in US
[30:45] hereby we know that we dwell in him and
[30:48] he and us because he have given us of
[30:50] his spirit and we have seen and do
[30:52] testify that the father sent the son
[30:55] to be the savior of the world whosoever
[30:58] shall confess that Jesus is the son of
[31:00] God God dwelleth in him
[31:03] and he and God
[31:08] that's a powerful statement
[31:11] now where do we get off
[31:14] thinking because we believe a certain
[31:17] Doctrine
[31:18] or a certain way that we're better than
[31:20] anybody else
[31:22] let me read it again
[31:24] whosoever shall confess that Jesus is
[31:27] the son of God God dwelleth in him and
[31:30] he in God
[31:32] so be careful how we talk about one
[31:34] another
[31:35] do they believe in Jesus Christ
[31:38] then that scripture pertains to them I
[31:40] don't care if they're Baptist I mean I
[31:42] could quote brother Branham all day on
[31:43] this Baptist Catholic whatever you are
[31:47] Do You Believe In Christ I don't care
[31:49] what brand you have I was witnessing to
[31:52] the lady across the street
[31:54] um
[31:55] on the mechanics shop there yesterday
[31:58] and I asked her I said
[32:00] I said are you Christian she said no I'm
[32:03] a Catholic I said why do Catholics
[32:06] always say that
[32:08] I said Do You Believe In Jesus she said
[32:11] yes I said why are you not a Christian
[32:13] she's because I'm Catholic
[32:18] I didn't get it
[32:20] to this day I don't get it
[32:23] do we believe in Jesus Christ or not
[32:28] I asked her I said Do You Believe In
[32:29] Jesus she said yes
[32:31] so all right I don't care what brand you
[32:34] put on yourself we're Christians
[32:36] together
[32:38] that's the same I don't care if your
[32:39] tapes only are five-fold or whatever you
[32:42] are brother Bobby do you believe in
[32:44] Jesus Christ or not if you do then you
[32:47] are my brother you are my sister he is
[32:50] the one that we lift up
[32:53] and we know and we have known and
[32:55] believe the love of God that the love
[32:58] that God hath to us
[33:01] I like this part right here
[33:03] God is love
[33:06] it is it brother Wilson God is love
[33:11] maybe if you just had three words in
[33:13] this Bible
[33:15] I think you could get it just from that
[33:18] and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in
[33:20] God and God in him herein is our love
[33:23] made perfect
[33:24] that we may have boldness in the way of
[33:27] judgment because as he is so are we in
[33:31] this world
[33:32] there is no fear in love
[33:38] but perfect love casteth out fear
[33:42] because fear hath torment
[33:45] he that feareth is not made perfect in
[33:48] love never fear
[33:51] we love him because he first love us
[33:54] loved us does that sound familiar
[33:57] it's a good song that we sing all the
[33:59] time
[34:00] if a man say I love God and hateth his
[34:03] brother he is a liar for he that loveth
[34:05] not his brother whom he has seen how can
[34:08] he love God whom he hath not seen
[34:10] in this commandment we have from him
[34:13] that he who loveth God
[34:16] love his brother also
[34:22] don't ever fear
[34:24] the bravest man
[34:27] that had ever
[34:29] as has ever been mentioned in the
[34:32] history of the world
[34:33] the bravest person the one the warrior
[34:37] that conquered the most in this book
[34:41] the greatest man that has ever walked
[34:44] this Earth
[34:46] feared nothing
[34:48] why did he fear nothing
[34:51] because he had a greater love than
[34:54] anything this world has ever seen
[34:57] he had a love that he would lay down his
[35:01] life
[35:03] for all of humanity
[35:09] but the Lyle if it would have just been
[35:11] me
[35:12] he had laid his life down
[35:16] why did he not fear anything how could
[35:20] he stand in the face of these Pharisees
[35:22] and Sadducees knowing what his end would
[35:24] be
[35:25] and yet loving them
[35:27] and those same ones
[35:30] that I talked about earlier that were
[35:32] scheming against him and wouldn't answer
[35:34] the questions and wanted to keep their
[35:35] positions and all that and he gets up
[35:37] they nail him to the cross
[35:41] he goes up on this cross he's he's
[35:43] lifted up before the people and what
[35:45] does he say
[35:47] brother Ron what does he say
[35:50] he said father forgive him
[35:52] Lord forgive him
[35:54] they don't know what they do
[35:56] look at the love
[35:57] that Christ had and then we see the love
[36:00] later on we see the Same Love
[36:03] in that man named Stephen
[36:05] he said the same thing
[36:08] he was there he was kneeling down and
[36:10] they had the stones and they were they
[36:12] were hitting them with these stones and
[36:13] he's like he says he's the Lord forgive
[36:15] him
[36:17] I don't know what they're doing
[36:18] there's that same Spirit of Christ
[36:21] no fear
[36:24] and Stephen because he had that love
[36:28] wherever we go whatever we do
[36:32] going to work going to school going to
[36:35] church
[36:37] if there is any type of hatred
[36:40] if there is any jealousy
[36:43] if there is any type of feeling think
[36:45] about where is this feeling coming from
[36:46] could it be maybe because I'm not going
[36:49] to get my way
[36:50] could it be a fear of that
[36:52] could it be maybe the fear that I'm
[36:55] wrong and something could it be the fear
[36:57] of
[36:59] I'm not going to get a position or I'm
[37:00] not going to get a job I'm not going to
[37:02] get a promotion could it be that and
[37:03] then we slip in a little bit
[37:05] of a negative
[37:07] word
[37:08] and I've seen it with the young people a
[37:10] lot of times
[37:11] this boy I like this girl you know they
[37:14] do and and
[37:17] the girl might say something to the boy
[37:19] about
[37:21] boy number two oh yeah he's
[37:24] you know he's
[37:27] not going to be successful he doesn't
[37:29] get good grades or he's not a good
[37:31] Christian or whatever just throw it in
[37:33] there
[37:34] just to turn him off the path because he
[37:37] fears that he might like this girl
[37:40] but he fears that she might like him
[37:43] but if he really loved
[37:45] if he really had that love
[37:48] he'd say he's a good man he's a good
[37:50] brother don't worry
[37:51] you know just like you
[37:54] especially if you're positive
[37:58] yeah yeah
[38:01] maybe uh sisters if you could come
[38:04] to close
[38:08] I I think about
[38:12] how
[38:13] that we have been taught through the
[38:16] word
[38:18] to never extend God
[38:21] and I was
[38:22] there was a time a couple years ago I'll
[38:24] give a little testimony
[38:25] that
[38:27] it was almost three years ago
[38:30] and I knew in my heart
[38:32] I knew that
[38:35] I had to make a move in my life
[38:38] I knew that I had to I had to move on
[38:41] and I was scared
[38:44] I was like 48 years old
[38:47] I might have to find another job
[38:50] I'm gonna have to find I'm gonna have to
[38:52] support my family and I remember
[38:54] [Music]
[38:57] a heartache
[39:01] is but a stepping stone
[39:08] all along the train
[39:11] that winding always
[39:16] upward
[39:18] this troubled world
[39:23] [Music]
[39:29] on until then
[39:33] my heart will go on scene but
[39:40] but until then
[39:44] with joy I'll carry on
[39:49] [Music]
[39:51] until the day
[39:54] my eyes behold the
[39:58] city
[40:01] until the day
[40:05] God
[40:06] calls me home verse two
[40:12] the things I've heard
[40:16] will dim and lose their value
[40:22] if we hear me
[40:26] they're borrowed for a while
[40:31] [Music]
[40:33] and things of Earth
[40:37] that's caused the heart to tremble
[40:44] remember
[40:46] there
[40:47] will more we bring a smile
[40:54] but until then
[40:58] my heart will go on seeing foreign
[41:05] [Music]
[41:09] with joy I'll carry on
[41:15] until the day
[41:19] my eyes
[41:24] [Music]
[41:35] to all his turn to Romans chapter 6.
[41:39] it reads like this
[41:41] know ye not that so many of us as we're
[41:44] baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized
[41:47] into his death
[41:49] therefore we are buried with them by the
[41:51] baptism into death
[41:53] that like as Christ was raised up from
[41:56] the dead by the glory of the father even
[41:58] so we also should walk in newness of
[42:01] life
[42:03] for we for if we have been planted
[42:06] together in the likeness of his death we
[42:10] shall be also in the likeness of his
[42:14] resurrection
[42:16] knowing this that all old man is
[42:19] crucified
[42:21] that old Jonah is crucified
[42:25] that old man
[42:27] is crucified with him
[42:31] that the body of sin might be destroyed
[42:34] that henceforth we henceforth we should
[42:38] not serve
[42:40] and that is the meaning friends
[42:43] baptism
[42:46] water's cold
[42:48] and as as I baptize our brother
[42:52] that he will go down into the water
[42:55] symbolizing going down into the grave
[42:57] and then I will bring him back up
[43:01] see symbolizing the resurrection of
[43:04] Jesus Christ a new man
[43:06] our dear brother has made this Choice
[43:09] himself
[43:11] he says he's been thinking about and
[43:13] praying about it for a year now
[43:15] now it's time to go into these Waters
[43:18] and be baptized in Jesus
[43:22] no you feel good
[43:24] raise your hand to the people saying I
[43:26] want to be baptized and I accept Jesus
[43:28] Christ as my savior I want to be
[43:30] baptized today instead of Jesus Christ
[43:32] is my savior
[43:34] oh my put your hands together
[43:38] and uh hold my hand
[43:42] foot tight and I'm gonna promise I'll
[43:43] bring you back up
[43:49] according to your own confession
[43:52] baptize you in the name of the Lord
[43:54] Jesus Christ
