Joshua chapter 24 verse [Music] 26 and Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law in the book of in the book of The Law of God and took a great Stone and set it up there under an oak that was by the sanctuary of the Lord and Joshua said unto all the people behold this Stone shall be a witness unto us for it hath heard all the words of the Lord which he spake unto us it shall be therefore a witness unto you lest you deny your God so Joshua let the people depart every man unto his inheritance and it came to pass pass after these things that Joshua the son of nun the servant of the Lord died being 110 years old and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in timnas which is in the Mount of Ephraim on the north side of the hill of gash and Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders that outli over lived Joshua and which had known all the works of the Lord that he had done for Israel let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for another opportunity Lord to gather together to read your word and now father we pray that you would join us here this evening as we pay respect to a dear friend and father that our service tonight would be pleasing to you that you would guide every word that said in Jesus name amen God bless you you can take your seats I read that scripture in Joshua chapter 24 to say that that last verse 31 it says this and Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders that out overlive Joshua and which had known all the works of the Lord that he had done for Israel it's a profound statement that's made in in the Book of Joshua there brothers and sisters from Brother osario church God bless you all welcome they're good friends of ours let's let's I'm sorry I should have greeted them earlier let's give them a a hand they're a they're a blessing to all of us brother orario is a good friend brother Rosario was a good friend of brother Billy Paul Brams also I um I I wrote down this scripture because I wanted to point out that it says here in the end of Joshua that that Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua and all of those days of those Elders that had witnessed everything that had happened from Moses all the way to the end of Joshua great Miracles had happened during those times we'd seen they had seen the the Lord come down in a mighty way and lay plagues upon Egypt when they were in bondage they saw the Flies and and they saw the hail come down and they saw the Nile River turn to blood in A great miracle and then they saw the hand of the Lord come down and the Death Angel come in to the city in Egypt and strike all of the firstborn dead and they remembered the lamp or the the blood that was on the doorpost and on the L and how that the the fathers would put that on the doorpost and the Death Angel when all of the deaths came came by when all the Egyptians were dying the isra Israelites didn't die because they had followed the word of the Lord these Elders remembered these things and then they saw coming out of Egypt they saw in a mighty hand they came out and they saw them go into the Red Sea and the water on both sides part up and they saw the Israelites walk through on dry ground and then the greatest army in the world came after them they turned they saw the waters come down in the on the ocean and destroy the greatest army in the whole world they saw these things they saw after Moses died they saw that Joshua came over part of the water on the Jordan River they saw that that Moses or that Joshua came over and then they sieged the city and they saw the armies come around the city seven times and then the greatest walls of the greatest the greatest city in the whole area fell down and they came in and they conquered without losing a man amazing they saw these things happen but when those brothers passed away and those sisters and those stories that they would tell and the witness when they passed away the faith of the people left God and then we turn into the Book of Judges and it says that the men and the women they started to do what was right in their own eyes and they forgot they forgot the Lord and I think that this man Billy Paul brandham brother bram's son what did this man see the power of of the Holy Spirit in these meetings that brother that brother Billy Paul saw just as a young man he saw 20,000 people smash their Idols in the name of the Lord Jesus in South Africa saw the dust coming up and them giving their hearts to the Lord he sat there in Durban and he saw the trucks coming by that were filled with wheelchairs and stretchers and and crutches and all these things this man saw those things he saw the Miracles and he saw the the power in Mexico and in India and all of these things that happened he was a witness and he saw it and that's who we're talking about tonight is this brother Billy Paul he saw the prophet of God stand in the pulpit and discern the very thoughts and intents of the heart as the people came by and he was never wrong never one time was there a mistake and thank God we have the tapes we have them recorded you can listen coming through the the aisle the line brother brandom every single one never from 1947 to 1965 not one mistake how could that ever how could ever that be amen it couldn't be unless God was there he saw the prophet of God in operation and he saw the man he saw him weak he saw him get tired he saw him after he would take he would take him from from the pulpit beat down and tired and he' drive him around and he saw the carnality of the man he saw that that he he would he would get weak and and he saw that he liked a fish and he saw that he liked to hunt and he saw the man behind the prophet and then he also saw the dad he saw his own dad forsake his family for the people he saw this man leave his wife leave his little children to go throughout the country go around the world and and and preach and get weak and be criticized and do all this thing brother Billy saw saw that he saw the dad he saw that this man he saw every aspect of the man named William brandham and brother Billy stood by him every moment of the way I want to play something that we heard last week this is from Brother Brown's life story and we listen to life story on Sunday morning and Sunday evening I'm sure you remember this but I want to play this for everyone right now I took the little baby when it died and put it on the arms of the mother and we taken it out to the cemetery and I stood there to hear Brother Smith the Methodist preacher that preached the funeral ashes to ashes and dust to dust now thought Heart to Heart there she went not long after that I took a little Billy there one morning he just a little bitty fell he was that's the reason he sticks with me and I stick with him I had to be both Papa and Mama both to him I'd take his little bottle we couldn't afford to have a far at night to keep his milk warm I lay it under my back like this and keep warm by the heat of my body we've stuck together like buddies and one of these days when I go off the field I want to hand him the word say go on Billy you stay with it some people wonder why I got him with me all the time I can't give him up he's even married but I still remember she told me to stay with him we stuck together like buddies remember walking around town the bottle under my arm he get to cry and one night he was was walking out in the backyard where just when she was fixing to have him she's smother not just a girl you know and i' walk back and forth from the old oak tree in the back of the yard and he was crying for his mama I didn't have any Mama to take him to and I pack my little honey I said he said daddy where's my mama did you put her into that ground I said no honey she's all she's up to heaven he said something there like to kill me one afternoon he was crying his long late in the evening and I was packing him on my back P pack him on my shoulder patting him like this he said Daddy please go get Mama and bring your here and I said honey I can't get Mama Jesus said well tell Jesus the Same my mama I want her I said well honey I mean you going to go see her sometime and he stop said Daddy I said yeah said I se mama up there on that cloud like to kill me I thought M see Mama up there on that cloud I just almost fed I hug the little fell up to my bosom I just help my head down in that's brother Billy Paul brother Billy Paul brandom same one that many of us knew he was probably most of you maybe never met him but he was somebody that brother Billy dedicated his life just like brother brandom said I want to hand it to brother Billy he dedicated his life to his dad and his dad's Ministry even after brother Brandon passed away brother Billy Paul dedicated his life to having other people hear that same gospel he was a he was a tremendous tremendous friend he was a tremendous brother and a selfless person never drawing attention to himself he hated the spotlight he he didn't like to get up and testify he he just all all he wanted to do was be with his dad and share this gospel with other people that's the man that passed away recently he was he was a good friend to me just an absolute ever since I was as younger than you boys I mean when I mean I've been friends our families have been friends for my whole life my grandpa wheeler was close with brother Billy Paul my my dad was about the same age they grew up together they um used to Fellowship when they were younger he was he was an integral part of my life growing up and and I have to say that he was a positive influence in every aspect of his life on me I appreciate him he um one thing with brother Billy Paul is he loved the youth the the young people he had a great burden for them and he he he just thought the world for him and he was of him and he was always there if you needed him he was always there for me when I was when I was a young man and um so I felt in my heart to play it's about 45 minutes um to play brother Billy Paul giving his testimony up at uh in Saskatchewan Canada and I think that uh I think that you're gonna love it I I started it where brother Billy talks about that he was able to see the same Angel of the Lord that we hear brother brandom talk about so much if it's just one man saying it saying that this Angel is he comes to me and he speaks to me but then when you put another man in the mix and that other man sees the same angel now you've got a witness and now you see that this brother Billy Paul he got to see that same angel that we hear so much about brother Jeremy if you could go ahead and start the video as I said it's about 45 minutes long it's brother Billy Paul's testimony and if you haven't seen it I uh I know it's going to be a blessing and if you have seen it I also know it's going to be a blessing to you go ahead brother Jeremy thank you as I began the travel my dad would tell me just like you hear the tapes and you hear your mother and dad tell you different things but until you have until you have a personal experience with Jesus Christ is just words yes you've got to be borned again when I was 12 years old how old are you Luke eight eight I was a little bit older than Luke probably not as big but I was but anyway my dad I'd hear him talk about the angel and I love to tell this part of my testimony and I know everyone of you heard it but I'm just going to tell it to you again I'd hear my dat talk about the angel and brother BR not only preached your a message but he lived your a message did he was a poor man he wasn't a rich man no he wasn't a rich man at all and he'd stay in the cheapest of Hotel he'd eat less food and have us to so it wouldn't be hard on you for the expenses of the meetings he not only preached your message but he lived your message we stay in this little hotel in velia Illinois and I was about 12 years old and he woke me up one morning and I I wasn't giving out prayer cards in I was just a little bit long bigger than Luke there but I was selling three little books one was called I was not disobedient to heavenly vision Divine Healing in the brandom campaigns Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I had a little nail apron I'd have it around me had nichels dines and quarters in there I thought I was something and I'd go go down and I'd give you you sell you books before the meeting start and the tent meetings when I come home that night my dad was sleeping in a bed right here I was next to my dad and my uncle Donnie was in the bed next to me was all in the same bed never even had a bathroom in the hotel room we had to go down the hall to use a bathroom and over on the corner in the back by the window there was a table and I don't know if you know what I'm talking about it it had Lo what you call them things you pour the picture you know picture of water and things that's where we wash Daddy he said he had a pillow across my face and he said Paul I said yes sir he said you know the angel that Daddy talks about I said yes he said he's here he he's in the room right now and he said he visited me tonight and told me about the meetings what to do he said I asked him if I could wake you and my uncle up Donnie and he said you can wake up Billy that don't make me no more than you or anybody else but it was just what the grace of God to me he said you can wake up Billy he said I want him to see you he said when Daddy takes takes the pillow from your eyes he said you look over where that war spacing is and there stands the angel that I told you about well I thought it'd be something you know that you see pictures of you know flying it was a man dressed in a white Rob had hair down to his shoulders 200 100 lbs or so he had his arms folded like that and all he do would just move his head back and forth and keep his eye on Daddy it scared me to death you say it wouldn't scare me you just haven't seen you there was a reverence I can't tell you about but he says he sent from the presence of God and I grabbed my daddy I was scared to death he said Paul he won't harm you he said I asked him if he could see you he never spoke a word to me or to Daddy but I'll never forget his eyes just looking back and forth at Daddy back and forth and I held on to my daddy and he clutched me up and he went from that being like a man in that room out that window before he went he just went into like a Mist like a vapor and he disappeared out the window and when he left a rainbow at 3:00 in the morning come and stood in that room from that day to this day I can tell you when he's there I might have been in Africa India anywhere I'd be Daddy had call the prayer line and I'd be working the prayer line down there getting the people lined up and I could tell you exactly when he was near before brother Brandon would even say you know what I'm waiting on you've heard him say on the table I'm waiting for him I could tell that he wasn't there and just as soon as he' come I knew it I could feel it that he said he's here now amen I've been a blessed man not only am I a child of God but I'm a son of a prophet and I'm a brother of a prophet how much greater could a man ask for so young people when you feel that when you feel that little nudge that's him yield to it what he says you do you never question one thing on that tape lady come to me one time and she says brother Billy no I'm sorry she wrote me a letter she saysi heard you give a testimony about Boo devil I said yeah she says the devil come to me and said he' scare me to death said he' talk to me you don't believe that the devil can talk he lies all the time you know when he lies when he opens his mouth but he said he would scare me to death that nervousness and said finally one day I just bucked up against him she says devil she says you frightened me all of my life and she says I want to ask you a question said did you ever hear of the Prophet William Brandon and said that devil didn't say a thing she said answer me the devil wouldn't say a thing she said in the name name of Jesus Christ answer me he said that thing spoke and said he's cast me into hell many times and she said I want to tell you something I'm a Believer in every word he said and you leave me and never bother me again she said boo devil and said he's never come back [Applause] again so just when he comes at you right po devil yeah he's not your conqueror you're his conqueror through Jesus Christ just don't be scared to know who you are I seen my daddy like I said he was a poor man and I'm gonna get into my testimony now I'm GNA be done here shortly but he got into when he went out to started meetings right here he come through Canada in the early 40s brother cook just talked about his father-in-law the different ones he never even had a suit that's right honey he borrowed a suit from his brother to go out and he had a hole here in his pocket on the side of my mom my mom went down and I don't know what you call them but it's an iron iron on thing that you do and he hop so he could hide that pocket and he'd hold his hand like this and he'd go up and shake hands with the preachers they all had dressed nice and he said I I'll shake you with my left hand he said because it's closer to my heart he had his right hand hand hid in that patch but I'm a witness to you this morning I seen seen him walking into the auditoriums thousands of people tens of thousands of people remember I'm not a like I am now not old man I was a kid and I seen people like you on stretchers wheelchairs CS everything just to get a glimpse of it he was a Jesus man they saw Jesus in Brother Brad and they knew if they could just touch that raged coat they'd be healed so who are we who are we the greatest of all give his all that we might have what we have today eternal life don't never let it become common to you I love you but like I said I may never get to see again but it's true I seen people I've seen people just when he walked in just walked in the auditorium and I'd have him by the arm leading him in I seen people just stand up out of the wheelchairs push the wheelchairs back I seen them come off of Cs I've seen mother s pass their babies down through hundreds and thousands of people just to get him to touch that baby not even knowing if they'd get that baby back but they knew that God was in that man so do you know that God was in that man I saw the Redeemer living in a redeemed one I don't worship him but I glorify the God that was in I may not understand it but I believe it and I don't compromise on I'm not want to be no smile like but I don't compromise on nothing to do that my job was to pass out prayer cards to get him in and out of the meeting what a privilege you say oh I we start no you don't want that job no it was a wonderful job I don't mean that I see him in a prayer line he'd always bring the people from this side and I'd bring the people up and said I'm in a chair and he say watch me watch me and I see him he go like this you seen him on the film and I knew then he was getting numb he didn't know what he was where he was at and I'd have the prayer line well I'd stop the prayer line because I knew it was time to go get him and I'll tell you some test that I saw but I'm talking about my job now okay my job was to get him in and out to get you up there to be prayed for just to stand before him and I've seen him I see him start doing this be getting a little weak and I'd stop the prayer line and he knew when he didn't see no one in that chair he might not even see me but when no one was in that chair then he knew it was time to to quit because sometimes didn't know worri is at and I'd leave and come over and I'd touch him on his side put my arms around him what a privilege that anointing was so strong it didn't make any difference if I had a headache a toothache in that presence everything left amen and I touch him on his side like this brother Paul and if he was talking to you maybe calling people out in the audience and I touch him like that if he didn't answer me back I'd pick him up and take him off the platform but he'd sometimes he'd touch me back the people didn't know but he'd be saying Paul leave me alone I know what I'm doing then he'd make an ALT to call whatever you say well that's no it's not because one time I take him out too early I thought it was time to take him I thought I was doing my job right and I take him too quick and he'd say Paul if you just left me a little longer I could have prayed for some more oh I a kid 14 years old so I took him too quick then maybe the next night I take him too early next night I take let him stay too long then he said Paul you let me stay too long he said don't give my prayer cards tomorrow night because I don't have strength to pray for the people don't feel sorry for me but it was a hard life but it was a wonderful life I said Daddy why why did the Lord let me see that angel he said because you were called to work with me son I heard a tape the other day not to brother Billy CU I don't even deserve to stand before you I'm not trying to be humble I'm just pouring my heart out to you he said he said if it hadn't been for Billy he said I would have been an insane institution long many years ago so whatever God let me do I'm thankful for it but he told you the truth yes and God Vindicated that it was the truth like I said he was a Jesus man God loved him so much I'm getting ready to start am that he spoke of him right here in this word if you believe it say Amen if you don't want to quit he spoke of him in his word and at his birth like on the trivia yesterday the light came down and hung on a man sent from God he spoke of him at his birth and when he was baptized in his 17th person on the trivia yesterday Eddie C the light come down and said as John the Baptist was sent to forun the first coming of Christ you will for my second coming he loved him so much that in Greensville in the cave he said you're I'm he said if you get the people to believe you and be sincere when you pray nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer not even cancer he loved him so much that he had his picture taken with him the only supernatural being that was ever photographed don't let it become common to you brother brandham said a man looked at that picture and laughed and he said it was nothing less than to blaspheme the Holy Ghost that's what brother brand said he loved him so much that he put his name on a mountain he loved him so much that he took him be on the curtain of time yes and he's seen every one of you over there he said all that you loved come on now church all that you loved and all that loved you God has given to you recognize who you are don't be ashamed amen all that you love God has given to you you see well I don't believe that part then your mights will not even be baptized cuz you haven't even started right all that the prophet said you loved him so much men loved him so much that picture a lady was laying in the hospital can I take a little more time lady was laying in the hospital she was dying in Jeffersonville Indiana she said Lord God I know that that's your prophet and she said if he was here and he'd pray for me brother ol I'd be well she said but he's not here but I know the one I'm speaking to that you in that picture with him her testimony was that light come out of that picture come over and touched her on a body and she was made perfectly well Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I seen him walk in I've seen people with legs that much shorter than the other one is any these mics work y I've seen people walk in they have legs that much Shar I'd see him go over to him remember now it's not no 77 year old man just a little bit older than him walk over P one leg up this leg would be that much shter and he' say do you believe said he do he said in the name of Jesus Jesus Christ let this leg come forth and that leg would grow the Lord that leg would grow as he pulled it out what a blessed people we are I seen him go in Little Rock Arkansas a deaf and dumb School the kids the kids could not hear they were in a special school and when he left town there there wasn't one that couldn't [Applause] hear I saw God in a man there was a little sister in our church after Daddy had gone to be with the Lord her name was Sister M Mirad her husband drank all of his life she he wasn't mean to her but he let her come to the special meetings that we had the tape Services when you as a little boy and he was just drink all the time

give me those braces he took them off of her she put them shoes on and down through there she went perfectly well Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever what witness our brother is brother Billy Paul imagine if you would have seen all of that imagine how much faith that you would have if that that scripture in Joshua that said that when these people left that that they the Israel stopped serving the lord and you can see telling stories like this it just builds our faith Lord you can do anything you're just you're an amazing God and and to see what brother Billy Paul saw in his dad's Ministry and for him to be able to give us those testimonies and now they're recorded on YouTube and all these other places so what a what a blessing brother Billy Paul as I said he stayed he stayed in the as you know the stayed in the ministry after brother Brandon passed away they started spoken word Publications then um Brother Joseph brandham started um voice of God Recordings brother Billy Paul stayed in working in the work of the Lord Brother Billy's job at voice of God was he would listen to the sermons and he would put in what's called The Gap so you Spanish-speaking Brethren you um there's a gap where brother brandom would speak and then the translator would be would be inserted in there so brother Billy as he was listening he didn't want to hurt the spirit as brother brandom's speaking as a translator can so he would let it go a couple sentences and he'd say okay that's the right place and he would put a gap in there then the translators could come in and put the translation in so and then they would do the whole sermon like that and hundreds of sermons were done like that brother Billy Paul got to listen to all of them and put in those gaps in the right place so the translator could speak and that people that don't speak English could could could hear these things he was and then of course brother Billy Paul was brother Billy Paul everybody knew him he was um he would call me sometimes and ask ask me for help and uh where's brother Jonathan so brother Jonathan we got a group from Congo that came in and um brother Billy said uh he'd call me up and it was always Dan can you come down yes sir so I came came down and it was the funniest thing they were all excited these these Africans from Congo and they were all excited about brother brandom and they were all excited about meeting his son and there was brother Billy standing there and they were all kneeled around him and he was trying to get them to get up and they wouldn't get up and he looked at me and he said Dan come here so I came down he says help you know fix this so I talked to I talked to all the African Brothers brothers and sisters I got them up and but you can imagine something someone that means so much to the people and brother Billy Paul just made it real I uh brother Glenn right there brother Glenn McHugh back there ra raise your hands so everybody can look at you we know who you are but brother Glenn um you've heard of brother Doug McHugh that's brother Glenn's brother brother Doug was brother brand or brother Billy Paul's best friend in the whole world so brother Glenn it's it's good to have you thank thank you for coming but brother Billy Paul so I got to work with him a lot and and one of the benefits in working with brother Billy Paul is I got to hear all of these testimonies that that you heard right there I got to hear them firsthand brother Billy Paul told told me a story one time he said uh he goes you know he said we were down in Florida and have you heard of FF Bosworth brother Bosworth was a great man of God he was he was there in the 1906 of zza Street Revival and uh when when the when really the the tongue started going forth and the Pentecostal Revival happened to went around the world then brother Bosworth left there and he actually was one of the founders of the Assemblies of God denomination so then after the assembly of Assemblies of God denomination started brother Bosworth said you know what you're saying that speaking in tongues is the initial evidence of the Holy Spirit he said it's not in the Bible that and it was a big rift and brother Bosworth said and he wrote a letter open letter to everyone he says I am resigning from the Assembly of God denomination because that you are putting something that is not God's word and you're taking it as God's word saying that you have to do it a certain way or the Lord won't fill you with the Holy Spirit or that this is the only evidence he said it is an Evidence but it's wrong so he left and he saw remember I said the isua Street Revival brother Bosworth saw some of the greatest Miracles and a one of the greatest revivals really that the world's ever had was theusa stre so he then they they started the Assemblies of God he left and he was still he said there was just something not fulfilled and then brother Bosworth met William brandom and he said this is what I've been looking for my whole life so brother Billy Paul knew brother Bosworth so one time brother Bosworth as I said brother Bosworth was part of all of these healings and he himself had a great gift of healing and he got old and brother Bosworth was he would he would travel with brother brandham and many times brother Bosworth or brother Brandon would pray for the sick and the other one would rest well this was brother Bosworth was praying brother brandham was going to preach the next the next service the next morning brother Bosworth as I said was an old man and he was hard a hearing and they had the prayer line coming up and brother Bosworth had the man come and and and they said the man's deaf and brother Bosworth says okay he says okay turn around and face the audience and he put his hands on the the deaf man's ears and he said now brother Billy Paul was here brother Brandon was back in the hotel room and brother Billy Paul was standing there on the platform and he was watching all this come to come about brother Bosworth put his hands on the man's ears and he prays for him and he says now brother receive your hearing and he said can you hear me the brother said I can hear you and he said brother you're going to have to believe more he says you're not having you're not having enough Faith remember brother Bosworth was hard of hear him and he put his hands on his ears again and he said Lord Heal this man he said he said give this man the faith and he said he said can you hear me and the brother said I can hear you and he said brother you're going to have to you're going to have to have more faith and he prayed for him again and the brother turned around and he said brother I can hear but it looks like you're going to have to be prayed for now so brother Billy Paul watched this whole thing and he told me that story he says I went back to the hotel and he said Daddy was crying he was laughing so hard that at that at that testimony so the it was all brother brandom had a good sense of humor brother Billy Paul had a good sense of humor he um brother Billy Paul loved the fish I remember Salem Noble road is um by voice of God Recordings is on is on Salem Noble brother Billy Paul doesn't live too far from there and I was Salem Noble's a a really narrow road and I was driving down Salem Noble and here comes this guy in this truck and he is all over the road pulling a boat and I'm coming this way and he's coming this way and runs me Salem Noble doesn't have a shoulder so it runs me all all the way almost off the road over here and he comes by and I was like what is that and it was brother Billy Paul he all over he was um still driving at 80s something years old um brother Billy told me well he told a lot of us a testimony one time the power I've told this testimony before but for our visitors the power went out a voice of God and um we were uh so we all kind of went down into the mail room it was the biggest room that was in the building and we all were sitting on the tables and just talking because everybody's computers were down and and nothing was working lights were out so brother Billy Paul and Brother Joseph brandham were sitting on the table kind of in the corner and all of us were around them probably 50 people and Brother Joseph said brother Billy he said he said he called him bub he said' buub he said tell us a story about Dad brother Billy says this he said I was the closest man to brother Brandon he says I was the closest person he said I traveled the world with him he said I was always with him he said he would tell me secrets and he would tell me about about the different things and and he said he says we were so close as you heard the quote that I played he said but even me he said even me the closest person in the world to brother brandom he said even I didn't know his friends from his enemies he said he never said a bad word about anyone to me it shows the character in brother branam and brother Billy Paul as a witness to this man's character I'm G brother Arie where are you at brother Arie if you would come up um while brother arie's coming brother Arie has a testimony he'd like to share about brother Billy Paul as brother AR's coming brother Billy Paul called me one day is I was upstairs and he was down below and uh he called me he says Dan can I see you my office please I said yeah sure so I come down and he um brother Billy could see that I was really struggling with some things I was really struggling with how that that we were maybe interpreting brother brandom's message and and how that it was it became about something that that I was having trouble standing and brother Billy Paul he says uh he goes come in Dan he says sit down I want to tell you something out of the blue I never told Brother Billy Paul anything I never let him know any any of my secrets I didn't I didn't I didn't talk outside of myself and brother Billy Paul he sets me down and he says he says I want to tell you he says Daddy and I he saysi went to pick up Daddy for church a Sunday morning he says and I got him and and we were driving and he said um Daddy I got to stop by and I got to get some gas and he said brother brandom told him he said Billy he says you can get gas on Saturday he says you don't have to go and and get gas on Sunday it's the Lord's Day brother Billy said he said and you could see his nature very tenderhearted brother Billy Paul was just tender and his dad could just crush him with a word and he he said it just crushed me he said Daddy I'm sorry he says I got enough he said we'll be fine I can get it tomorrow he said no Billy he said stop by go to the gas station get the gas he says but just try not to do that so then he said and another time he said' we were driving home from church and he said mom sister brandom said she needed to get some milk she said she called brother brandom Billy she said Billy can you stop I need to get some I need to get some milk and he said he said uh to Sister brandom he said honey he said we've got seven or six days in the week that you can go shopping he says you don't have to go to the grocery to get milk on Sunday brother and sister brandom said oh she says she says I'm sorry she says I can get it tomorrow it'll be okay we can we can get it at the at the grocery store tomorrow he said no he said it's okay so he drives and and he pulls in and he gets out and he goes and picks up the milk brings it back he said let's just try why not to do that brother Billy told me those two stories and he looked me in the eye and he said Dan he said Daddy was not a legalist telling me that I was right in in some of the things that I was feeling he said daddy wasn't like that but do you see he still honored the Lord's day he still did his best to serve God but he's brother Billy wanted to point out to me no that he wasn't like that and then he told me as we talked he said he started telling me about my own Ministry and he started talking to me about some things that he thought maybe were going to happen in the future and it was just when I left that office I was just on top of the world and it struck me that number one brother Billy knew that I was feeling down brother brandham said that he had a gift of discernment and then number two that he would take all of that time for me to sit me in his office across from him and just tell me these things just to encourage me and that's the kind of man that our brother was brother Billy Paul brother Arie thank you for coming and I remember brother Billy Paul gave his testimony here years ago and the place was really packed I mean they had the chapel with the screen and the fellowship hall with screens and sound so it was it's it's amazing to me what you get on YouTube I just looked at the YouTube 100,000 200,000 Maybe in 8 years for a man of God you know telling a testimony and I've seen patterns like that but anyway I've been thinking about God our Father and I'm thinking about you now that you each one of you are his child even when job was uh going through his trial it said when the sons of God Satan went up there and he was talking to God and and so you know it's not our job to really put people in our out this you know what I mean that's I'm getting off on but in 55 I was only two years in a month old and my mom had wanted to have brother BR pray for teeth in Chicago we went to about 75 to 100 meetings my dad said and my mom sister was put in the hospital for a heart trouble called romatic fever her heart was damaged the rest of her life the doctor said she wouldn't live to 25 be 25 so I I told Jeremy where this is and the reason I tied it in is because God your father he sees each one of you and and I I thought you know when you patter an elk you or deer anything you you kind of get to see where they're at and you want to know their habit or pattern well I thought about God his pattern is that he's paternal I just say that so you won't forget because he's your father each one of you and if he's answered prayers I've seen prayers answered for people that do not deserve an answer to prayer I mean I know that for a fact but he did answer prayers and when they forgot about it he still would answer prayers so he's got his own program we just need to get with it okay so he I'm going to let him play but brother brandom missed brother Billy Paul and this is in memory of brother Billy Paul which I've met a few times and and um and even ate with him a few times but I wanted you to see where brother Bram was tight with him and then the other thing I wanted you to see was my mom wanted brother Brown to pray for her teeth but she' forgot about it totally forgot because of her sister and she but God did not forget that's the part I wanted you to when you pray a prayer and there's a man that came I would like to have prayer for him is his name is Christopher he's so sweet he's on fit and all and he came up here today after this morning service and then Carlos came by at the same time you know he's got a new phone but he it's just I don't know why I just think God if he can put that bird why is it there if it's not you know brother uh Daniel's been very patient with me and understanding it and I just can't help if you just meet this BR boy the brother and he's just in such pain you know oh God so okay now well let's go back to 1955 I'm two years in a month old I'm the sick boy you might think I'm still sick all right Jeremy this someone I'm missing this Billy Paul I don't know where he went but I I'm an know his spirit I know what's wrong with him and I I miss his Spirit um is this the patient lady I'm a stranger to you you don't know me and I don't know you but Jesus Christ knows us both is that right you believe you're here stand for someone it's a a sister or a half sister he's not a full sister a half sister she's just been stricken ill recently it's uh I believe he said I didn't understand I believe he said rheumatic fever right doctor you also got a daughter that's sick she has a fever also you got a sick son you want me to pray through your teeth don't you come here dear God who made heavens and earth send th blessings upon this woman who I bless in Jesus Christ's name [Applause] amen well my okay now my aunt she used to live right here on hent when I moved here her husband was a preacher too he was he's a black man preacher my aunt now this is part of it too she lived a very rough life she had a husband if he was her husband killed two of her infant children so just because you have these Supernatural things happen doesn't mean you're immune even him yeah brother Billy Paul wasn't doing right then if you you if you know a little more his testimony he didn't quite cover all that in this I talked to him a little bit about this morning yeah and so you've got a nice overview of everything from your experience with your family and everything but you know one time I thought of this I thought you know let's just say you you were working for Elon Musk nobody liked you but Elon Musk did like you it' make a big difference wouldn't it yeah if you were working for him so you each one of you can be just that close to God as close as you want to be isn't that b beautiful and Powerful amen amen amen did you notice did you notice that brother Billy Paul's presence struck brother brandom he wanted him there that was that was amazing and then there's brother arie's Mother forgot to put it on the prayer card forgot to mention her teeth and there was brother brandom showing that gift of God talking about this lady's teeth and her being healed amen um does anyone have a testimony they'd like to share about brother Billy Paul anyone else I can either bring the microphone down or I can uh we can come here anyone brother Billy Paul was as I said he was uh he was precious to me and especially when I was a young man to see someone as important as brother Billy Paul take the time to speak to a nobody like me being 18 19 20 years old or whatever I was brother Billy taking his time and talking to me about the Lord talking to me about brother brandom he called me on the phone a couple times at home just wanting to talk to me and and just show his love and I think if that was me how many other people did this man do that to it's just he was he was a tremendous gift to the body of Christ and he uh he was he was a wonderful gift to me I'll sh I'll share one more testimony and then I'll quit this one might not this isn't a miracle but it might it might show a little bit about brother brandom and his prophetic gift brother Billy Paul and brother Brandon were in South Africa and if you know if you listen to the tapes brother um Billy was with it was uh Gordon Lindsay and FF Bosworth and a number of the other ones and they were pressuring brother branam to have meetings in in certain cities brother brandham had prayed about it and the Lord forbade him to go to these cities and instead the Lord said no go over here and go on this hunting trip so brother brother brandom said Brethren he says I believe the Lord doesn't want this to happen brother Billy Paul is the one person in all of that group brother Billy Paul stood up for his dad and he said Daddy needs to go on the hunting trip all of the other ones brother Bosworth who I mentioned Who Loved brother Bram Gordon Lindsay loved brother brandham all the other Brethren said no you need to preach at these meetings there's going to be tens of thousands of people there you need to be there brother brandom said okay I'll go and he takes a branch of a eucalyptus tree and he breaks it off and he comes over to the men and brother Billy Paul was standing there there he takes the branch and he starts waving the branch dusting the branch on The Minister's feet and he started saying thus sayeth the Lord thus sayeth the Lord thus sayeth the Lord thus sayeth the Lord didn't do brother billies left the branch came back they had the meetings every single person in that group of people including brother branam got what's called an amoeba parasite and almost died except brother Billy Paul brandham brother brandham said the reason that Billy Paul didn't get it is because he stood up for the Holy Spirit and he stood up for what I said and that was that was that young man that we just heard preach right here we listen to as I said life story the other day and I was in my hotel room and going through the hurricane as you all were listening and the thing that struck me so much and if the musicians could come the thing that struck me so much was there is brother branam and he has this vision and he goes beyond the curtain of time and he sees different people that he knew and he sees one special young lady and this young lady was his daughter Sharon rose that had died about the same time within a couple days of her mother and this young lady she was 18 years old he said a real pretty girl and he said she came to him and and she says hello Dad he says dad he says how could this be and he and he finds out that this is Sharon Rose now listen to this and you all that heard the tape listen to this he starts going this way Sharon Rose his little baby says no I'm going to just stand here and wait for Billy and you think brother Andy you think maybe 10 days ago or whatever it was do you think maybe that they met that they met up beyond that curtain of time that he met his baby sister he met her in real life I bet you they she they gave each other a big hug and they started greeting people I don't know if she was first in line or second next to his dad brother brandham but they were right there she said it struck me I think I'll just wait right here for Billy and she waited I don't know 85 years for him and then there Then There came brother Billy Paul and they had a little family family reunion with sister brandom and sister hope and and brother brandom and all of them let's let's all stand if I could sum up brother Billy Paul in words he gave his life to brother brandom and then something that I saw in my own life he equally gave his life to Brother Joseph brandom his brother as Brother Joseph had it in his heart to spread brother brandom's gospel around the world and I just I always respected brother Billy Paul for that he was always willing to just serve and do what he could I always respected his loyalty also to Brother Joseph and and all those of voice of God and how they they just put this message around the world and he was selfless he loved the Lord he loved God's people he loved his dad and I'm looking forward to seeing him one day also God bless you brother Jonathan if you could sing Swing Swing

amongst Believers we were invited here and I just want to thank you all for having us here but um on behalf of my church I didn't like the brother said I didn't want the opportunity to pass by because at my own church we had a little kind of memorial service for brother Billy Paul and I wasn't able to say something but I saw this as my opportunity and the brother Daniel invited uh he invited us he invited anyone to say words and I was really nervous to do so but I just wanted to say to you know the young people and everyone I got to meet him I got to meet brother Bly Paul and in 2018 our church went to Jeffersonville in June I believe it was and I just want to tell you it's all real he really was as loving as they say he was he was as kind as he was and there was a presence about him I was only 12 years old but and I didn't recognize the I I wish I could have met him now or seen him again but I didn't recognize or I couldn't see I couldn't fully grasp in just how special that was I wish I could see him again but like our brother say I will see him again amen and there's this I I looked at uh a testimony that brother B uh spoke on he was in Canada in I think it was the 1980s and there's this video on YouTube and there's these words that he says in the beginning that's stuck with me and I can't I I kind of can't get them out my head and I'd like to say it just as an encouragement to everyone and Billy Paul he says this the prophet of God said there's only one way that you'll make it that's by his Amazing Grace it's nothing that you done or I done but what he done for us on Calvary amen and I'm resting on that and I just wanted to share that on behalf of my church and thank you for having us here it's a privilege to be here to be where probibly Paul was and to be where brother Benham was and thank you very much God bless you I'm going to get I'm going to get the most out of brother Glenn brother Glenn if you could would you close in prayer my brother let's
