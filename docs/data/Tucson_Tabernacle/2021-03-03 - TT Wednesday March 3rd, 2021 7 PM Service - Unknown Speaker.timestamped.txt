[53:16] he will deliver you from the snare of
[53:18] the fowler
[53:19] and that comes from the hunter brother
[53:21] aaron somebody is a fowler and they hunt
[53:23] foul and so
[53:24] the bible is saying here he shall
[53:26] deliver thee
[53:27] from the snare of the fowler isn't that
[53:29] a great promise of god
[53:30] my goodness there's traps all around us
[53:32] i've been in my share of my life but the
[53:34] bible says god would deliver us from the
[53:36] snares
[53:37] of the hunter that's good isn't it
[53:39] brother johnson back there you know why
[53:40] it's good because it's out of the bible
[53:42] that's where inspiration come people get
[53:44] inspiration out here and over here and
[53:46] that's okay
[53:47] but if we get our inspiration ever
[53:48] opened our bibles up
[53:50] the word of god is quick and it's
[53:52] powerful and it's inspiring
[53:54] amen he goes on to say and from the
[53:56] noise and pestilence he shall cover thee
[53:59] with his feathers
[54:00] and under his wings shalt thou trust his
[54:02] truth shall be thy shield and thy
[54:04] buckler
[54:04] thou shall not be afraid with me thou
[54:07] shall not be afraid
[54:09] thou shall not be afraid i say we take
[54:11] the word of god and say lord
[54:12] i'm tired of being afraid and i'm not
[54:14] going to be afraid anymore because the
[54:16] word says thou
[54:17] shall not be afraid amen for the terror
[54:20] by night nor for the arrow that flyeth
[54:22] by day north
[54:23] for the pestilence that walketh in
[54:25] darkness nor for the destruction that
[54:27] wastes
[54:28] at noon day a thousand shall fall at thy
[54:30] sad and ten thousand at thy right hand
[54:32] but it shall not
[54:33] come nigh unto thee only with thine eyes
[54:37] shall thou behold and see the reward of
[54:39] the wicked because thou has made the
[54:41] lord
[54:41] which is my refuge even the most high
[54:44] thy habitation
[54:46] there shall no evil befall thee neither
[54:48] shall any plague came nigh thy dwelling
[54:51] and he shall give his angels charge over
[54:53] thee to keep thee
[54:54] in all thy ways amen may god add his
[54:57] blessing to the word you may be seated
[55:00] i was just thinking about this subject
[55:02] and it came back to me i was with some
[55:04] of the young people and i thought you
[55:05] know that's
[55:06] i want to just speak a little bit about
[55:08] traps and snares and
[55:10] i was looking up the definition it's
[55:13] good to see these young men on the front
[55:15] row
[55:16] amen god bless you young men amen i'd
[55:18] like to see all the young people
[55:20] up on the front row close to me are you
[55:22] matthew
[55:23] god bless you matthew i had breakfast
[55:25] with your dad this morning
[55:26] amen he's a good man amen
[55:30] and so i was thinking about this a trap
[55:32] is listen to me really close here
[55:35] a trap is a device or an enclosure
[55:38] designed to catch and retain animals
[55:42] a trap is a device or an enclosure
[55:45] designed
[55:46] i want you to notice it's designed to
[55:48] catch and retain
[55:49] animals and boy hasn't the devil
[55:52] designed some
[55:53] some devices to capture the souls of
[55:56] men's and women can you say amen to that
[55:58] the devil's got some devices he's
[56:00] designed a snare is a
[56:03] trap for catching birds and animals it's
[56:06] a little bit too loud
[56:07] right there back at me a trap for
[56:09] catching birds and animals typically
[56:11] a noose or a wire or a cord and i
[56:14] thought about that boy how many
[56:16] people have got their neck in a noose
[56:19] when i wear an old tucson out here it
[56:20] wasn't just the cowboys but the devils
[56:22] built some nooses and got people's necks
[56:24] and those
[56:25] nooses and my we see it all around us
[56:28] people that can't move
[56:29] from those traps and i was i was i
[56:32] pulled up
[56:33] and did a little research on some of the
[56:34] traps and i just want to go through a
[56:36] few of these and maybe
[56:38] there's many many traps but i just
[56:39] thought we'd go through a couple of them
[56:40] is that okay
[56:41] is everybody with me so i was thinking
[56:44] of
[56:44] one trap is called they call it the leg
[56:46] trap
[56:48] a leg trap uh is uh they also call it a
[56:51] foot trap
[56:52] and it's uh it's uh
[56:56] by proponents they use it in the fur
[56:57] trade and it's a leg hold and comprised
[57:00] of
[57:00] a a metal foot plate and and
[57:04] and and curved jaws powered by hefty
[57:07] spring and i
[57:07] i haven't worked with our audio video
[57:09] enough team enough to get our pictures
[57:11] and things like that but
[57:12] you how many have ever seen a foot trap
[57:14] it's one that's got a little thing and
[57:16] it
[57:16] closes and it holds it kind of right in
[57:19] there
[57:20] and it's it's powered by hefty springs
[57:22] and i was thinking about this and while
[57:23] i was thinking about the holy spirit was
[57:25] dealing with me
[57:26] it said it usually is anchored into the
[57:29] ground
[57:31] by a short chain and a metal spike and
[57:34] it is secured to a tree
[57:36] and a large branch and i thought about
[57:39] this how these traps you don't just
[57:41] get caught in a trap brother aaron and
[57:43] then run off with the trap but usually
[57:45] the trap is
[57:46] it's anchored to the ground and
[57:49] somewhere you just you get uh instead of
[57:51] being mobile you become
[57:52] immobile we're talking about your
[57:55] journey from earth to glory and
[57:57] you get caught in that trap and somehow
[57:59] that trap that traps you
[58:01] it traps you and usually it's not the
[58:03] trap that kills you
[58:05] but the trap is attached to the ground
[58:07] to where you can't move on in your
[58:09] journey in your life oh blessed be the
[58:11] name of the lord
[58:12] amen it's a trap to the ground so you
[58:14] can't go in a rapture you become an
[58:17] earth-bound creature and it traps you to
[58:19] the ground i thought
[58:20] boy how many people are are just
[58:22] anchored maybe to their job
[58:24] so deeply they can't move on with a god
[58:26] some people are anchored to a boyfriend
[58:28] or a girlfriend and they can't move on
[58:31] with god when god's saying hey you need
[58:32] to
[58:33] move on closer to me and they're so
[58:35] anchored to the ground and the
[58:36] the world and the earth and and those
[58:39] things and they can't move on
[58:40] some people are they're they're uh how
[58:42] could i say they're in a trap and
[58:44] they're
[58:44] they're bound to hatred maybe bitterness
[58:48] and it's got them all held and for years
[58:50] and years
[58:50] and you come back and talk to them their
[58:52] testimony is the same and bitterness and
[58:54] hatred it's a it's a trap i was thinking
[58:58] about that it's a it's a trap and
[59:00] it's a leg trap it holds on to your leg
[59:02] and and it holds you and
[59:04] i was thinking about this because the
[59:06] the little definition says once
[59:08] triggered a trap immortal immobilizes
[59:10] the animal and prevents them from eating
[59:13] oh this is really amazing it is that
[59:15] people stop reading their bible and
[59:17] praying and a
[59:19] church and they stopped caring for their
[59:21] babies and
[59:22] staying hydrated and fending off
[59:24] predators and sheltering themselves from
[59:27] the from the elements
[59:28] now we can see a little uh maybe a
[59:30] coyote or a little prairie dog in that
[59:32] stage but what about
[59:33] people who get in that and they they
[59:36] they get caught in a trap it prevents
[59:38] them from eating spiritually
[59:40] they stop reading their bible they stop
[59:42] praying they stop
[59:43] listening to the voice of god's prophet
[59:45] which is spiritual food and due season
[59:48] stored up for this day we get caught in
[59:51] a trap it might be a trap of world in us
[59:53] and we just don't have time to listen to
[59:55] god's problem if you don't
[59:56] if you don't have time to listen to
[59:57] god's prophets you're too busy
[1:00:00] you're just too busy you might be in a
[1:00:03] trap somewhere and
[1:00:04] i was thinking about that how many
[1:00:06] mothers we see get caught in a trap of
[1:00:08] worldliness or
[1:00:09] social media or the the the movement of
[1:00:12] the modern woman and seeing them abandon
[1:00:14] their
[1:00:15] their children their own need natural
[1:00:17] affection for their children and they'll
[1:00:18] abandon it
[1:00:19] to run off there and chase some
[1:00:21] fictitious mirage in the world can you
[1:00:23] say amen to that you probably know
[1:00:25] people like that maybe abandon their
[1:00:26] husband
[1:00:27] abandon their their children and just
[1:00:29] run off somewhere they're in a trap in
[1:00:31] their mind the devil has
[1:00:32] trapped them somewhere i thought about
[1:00:35] leg traps are designed to hold a wild
[1:00:37] animal
[1:00:38] who does not want to be caught as such
[1:00:41] and what many animals become so
[1:00:43] desperate they resort to chewing
[1:00:45] or ringing off their own trapped limb in
[1:00:48] order to escape
[1:00:50] and breaking their teeth and bones in
[1:00:52] the process and i
[1:00:53] there really has to come a desperation
[1:00:55] to live
[1:00:58] it takes the desperation say i'm going
[1:00:59] to live
[1:01:01] i thought jesus in matthew 18 9 said if
[1:01:04] thine eye offend thee pluck it out
[1:01:07] cast it from thee it is better for thee
[1:01:09] to enter into life with
[1:01:10] one eye rather than with two eyes to be
[1:01:13] cast into
[1:01:14] hell fire so jesus is telling us a
[1:01:16] priority
[1:01:17] the priority we've got to be free we've
[1:01:19] got to be journeying on with the lord
[1:01:22] we've got to get away from these traps
[1:01:24] i was thinking about an animal endures a
[1:01:27] painful and panic-filled
[1:01:29] weight oh listen can you just see people
[1:01:31] spiritually
[1:01:32] they're caught in a trap brother aaron
[1:01:34] and they're in this pitiful
[1:01:37] and they're waiting for because it's not
[1:01:39] the trap that closes on your leg that
[1:01:41] kills you
[1:01:42] it just holds you it just keeps you from
[1:01:45] going on with the lord
[1:01:47] it just keeps you from being able to go
[1:01:48] and eat
[1:01:52] the the animal endures a painful panic
[1:01:55] field weight until they're either die
[1:01:58] from exhaustion
[1:02:00] blood loss dehydration or hyperthermia
[1:02:03] or a clubbed or choked or stomped by the
[1:02:06] trapper
[1:02:08] so as not to damage the pelt because
[1:02:10] remember the devil
[1:02:11] he what the predator is doing he's
[1:02:13] trying to trap you
[1:02:15] because he wants your life he wants to
[1:02:18] take your life
[1:02:20] remember job i'd like to preach job
[1:02:21] right here remember the devil come to
[1:02:23] him said yeah you got a hedge around him
[1:02:25] so god said take the hedge around but
[1:02:27] you can't have his life
[1:02:29] there's something about the life of a
[1:02:31] christian and i thought about that
[1:02:33] because the devil wants to take every
[1:02:35] one of us and make us a trophy
[1:02:37] on his wall some of the brothers i don't
[1:02:40] know if you all hunt or whatever
[1:02:41] you go and you shoot the game and then
[1:02:42] you bring it back and you and you put it
[1:02:44] up on your wall and you say hey this was
[1:02:46] this
[1:02:46] and then you usually always have a story
[1:02:48] that you tell behind that
[1:02:51] and how the devil would love amen to
[1:02:54] take your soul and take your testimony
[1:02:56] and all that god's done for you
[1:02:58] like samson they brought him out to make
[1:03:00] sport and put him up on the wall and say
[1:03:02] hey this is a great
[1:03:03] trophy remember brother brandt said
[1:03:06] usually
[1:03:06] it's money women are popularity they're
[1:03:08] able to trap these people
[1:03:10] well i got this one this way and i got
[1:03:12] this one this way and i got
[1:03:14] and he sits there with his little imps
[1:03:16] in hell and tells them
[1:03:17] these little stories is everybody you've
[1:03:19] probably got people that are going
[1:03:20] through your mind right now
[1:03:23] traps the devil threw a trap out there
[1:03:26] and and trapped them into it
[1:03:29] i was thinking about this brother random
[1:03:31] says this in the
[1:03:32] message mark of the beast in 1956 he
[1:03:34] said you know
[1:03:35] yonder in hell the tag is hanging on the
[1:03:38] door
[1:03:39] expecting you there one of these
[1:03:41] mornings
[1:03:42] the devil is so confident in his trap
[1:03:45] the prophet of god tells us that he's
[1:03:47] already got a tag in hell
[1:03:49] with every one of your names on it
[1:03:52] you see how confident he is in lady
[1:03:55] josiah
[1:03:55] and satan's eden he says well oh i know
[1:03:58] they went up to the altar now they made
[1:03:59] a start for god but i've got
[1:04:01] traps for them i'm re you know it's a
[1:04:03] lot of times the devil doesn't mind
[1:04:05] he'll stay outside the door say hey go
[1:04:06] have a good service i'll be here for you
[1:04:07] when you get out
[1:04:09] we need a power of the holy ghost that
[1:04:10] doesn't just keep us in church
[1:04:12] but he keeps us when we go outside of
[1:04:14] the church amen something begins to move
[1:04:16] and that's the god i need
[1:04:18] i mean it's all right when we're in here
[1:04:20] we're all brothers and sisters and
[1:04:21] man if the devil comes in brother the
[1:04:23] deacons will get him brother aaron will
[1:04:24] get him her brother arnie back there
[1:04:26] we'll get but when we go outside man
[1:04:28] sometimes we get alone it's just you and
[1:04:29] the devil in the car and
[1:04:31] say lord i need you to be with me i'm no
[1:04:33] match for the traps of the devil
[1:04:35] can you say amen to that i'm no match
[1:04:37] for the mental traps of the devil i'm no
[1:04:39] match for the fiery darts
[1:04:41] oh but hallelujah he said greater is he
[1:04:43] that is in you
[1:04:44] than he that is in the world so my
[1:04:47] confidence is in christ
[1:04:49] brother rahm said you go to you better
[1:04:50] go let somebody who can go there and
[1:04:52] take it from you take
[1:04:54] it off there's only one that can do that
[1:04:56] that's the son of god
[1:04:57] i have overcome death and hell and i'm
[1:04:59] he that was dead
[1:05:00] and alive forevermore all other grounds
[1:05:03] are sinking sand
[1:05:04] that's good advice from a prophet when
[1:05:06] he i don't know if he took a journey to
[1:05:08] hell and saw the name tags there but he
[1:05:10] said there's one
[1:05:11] that's ordained to go and take that name
[1:05:12] take off and said not that one
[1:05:15] not that one i've got their name in the
[1:05:17] lamb's book of life
[1:05:18] or do you believe it today amen we
[1:05:21] should believe the
[1:05:22] word of god revelations 13 8 revelation
[1:05:24] 17 8 we all remember hebrews 13
[1:05:26] 8 or hebrews yeah hebrews 13 8 jesus
[1:05:29] christ the same yesterday
[1:05:30] and forever it's up there on the back
[1:05:31] but what can we remember revelations 13
[1:05:34] 8 and revelation
[1:05:35] 17 8 their names were written in the
[1:05:37] lamb's book of life before
[1:05:39] the foundation of the world that was
[1:05:42] going to be a little bit just
[1:05:43] you know surprised when christ comes and
[1:05:45] takes my name off i want him to take
[1:05:47] your name off today
[1:05:48] amen if you haven't dedicated your heart
[1:05:50] to god amen
[1:05:51] give with the program amen because we're
[1:05:55] not going to
[1:05:56] everyone whose names are on the lamb's
[1:05:57] book of life amen have been redeemed
[1:05:59] brother brahm said that
[1:06:00] i believe it was the breach he said
[1:06:02] every one of those redeemable sons and
[1:06:04] daughters of god have to be dipped in
[1:06:05] that clorox
[1:06:07] amen that washes away our sins i'm so
[1:06:09] glad for clarks
[1:06:11] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:06:13] lord
[1:06:14] i was thinking about this and i made
[1:06:16] some notes here and i was thinking about
[1:06:17] it
[1:06:18] and some of you all may be hunters and
[1:06:20] trappers but traps are placed where
[1:06:22] animals
[1:06:24] are passing through they're just not out
[1:06:27] in the desert somewhere they
[1:06:28] they hunters they pattern those
[1:06:32] animals my my boys you know we just go
[1:06:34] out and just sit in the woods and now
[1:06:35] they got trail cameras they put out
[1:06:37] there my boy
[1:06:38] i think he went about 20 of them put
[1:06:40] them everywhere
[1:06:41] out there and then he had to go back and
[1:06:43] drive and collect them all and
[1:06:44] it's got an app that shows right where
[1:06:46] they all are and then they got this
[1:06:48] other technology with the radio ones
[1:06:50] where you don't even have to go out and
[1:06:51] check it man you're sitting at your
[1:06:52] office man and boom hey
[1:06:54] there's a deer and and wow that's the
[1:06:57] way the devil is he's patterning you
[1:07:00] he knows you better than yourself
[1:07:03] hey man the devil watches you even when
[1:07:05] you're sleeping he's steady and they're
[1:07:06] back in hell like ah what do you think
[1:07:08] what do you think
[1:07:09] i don't know he's watching us and and
[1:07:11] where the animals pass through and where
[1:07:14] the souls pass through you know he's had
[1:07:16] six thousand years to perfect his
[1:07:17] techniques
[1:07:19] you know you're not the first young
[1:07:21] brother or young sister to come through
[1:07:22] here he's had six thousand years to
[1:07:24] to perfect his techniques and i i gotta
[1:07:26] say we got a worthy adversary
[1:07:29] amen it's like an atomic bomb you know
[1:07:31] you know
[1:07:32] you you you know that the damage and the
[1:07:34] destruction that can come from it
[1:07:37] i don't fear the devil but i acknowledge
[1:07:40] his power i acknowledge that if i get
[1:07:43] away from the greater my big brother
[1:07:45] christ i'm no match for him
[1:07:48] i mean let that settle in somewhere
[1:07:50] because a lot of times people become
[1:07:51] christian like oh i got this
[1:07:53] and god's going to say no you don't have
[1:07:54] this i've got this you don't
[1:07:56] and then he allows you to fall down so
[1:07:58] he can prove to you you don't have this
[1:08:01] without me you can do nothing and i was
[1:08:04] thinking about that because there's a
[1:08:05] season of trapping
[1:08:08] there's a season it just doesn't and so
[1:08:10] a lot of times with the souls it's like
[1:08:12] friday night or
[1:08:13] saturday and the devil realized there's
[1:08:15] a season
[1:08:16] and work's over and there's a lot of
[1:08:18] times i found with people and
[1:08:20] even young people i know when i was
[1:08:21] going to school you're in the grind you
[1:08:22] got to get to school and there's
[1:08:23] deadlines
[1:08:24] but it's in between that when that and
[1:08:26] then you got that little
[1:08:27] time in there that you can have that
[1:08:28] time and then the devil reaches to your
[1:08:30] through your friends or through this or
[1:08:32] that can you say amen to that
[1:08:34] you watch on friday night those spirits
[1:08:36] of loneliness and
[1:08:37] depression and things start out through
[1:08:39] there and amen the bible says we're not
[1:08:41] ignorant of his devices by this time we
[1:08:43] should understand
[1:08:44] hey that's where the predator that's
[1:08:45] where i got caught in that trap before
[1:08:48] i've said it before i say it again you
[1:08:49] go around the corner and you fall down
[1:08:52] and then you go around that same corner
[1:08:53] again and you fall down you know what
[1:08:54] you do you stop going around that corner
[1:08:58] you stop going around that corner the
[1:09:01] devil got you that remember brother
[1:09:03] around says that i think it's greatest
[1:09:04] battle ever fought
[1:09:05] little nelly sanders remember god
[1:09:06] deliverer of the music and things like
[1:09:08] that
[1:09:09] she got up there and and she said well
[1:09:11] that really doesn't bother me anymore
[1:09:13] brother graham said that right there is
[1:09:14] where the devil's got you he said if it
[1:09:16] got you the first time it'll get you the
[1:09:17] second time
[1:09:19] and every one of us have a weakness and
[1:09:20] we need to know where that weakness is
[1:09:22] and if you're a christian
[1:09:23] for very long you know where that
[1:09:24] weakness is and brother man says cover
[1:09:26] that weakness with prayer
[1:09:28] pray amen you might have a temper you
[1:09:31] got from your great great grandfather
[1:09:33] brother ram says sweeten that temper
[1:09:34] with prayer
[1:09:36] amen i was thinking about that a lot of
[1:09:39] times it happens in a change of life
[1:09:42] and we were talking to young people last
[1:09:43] night about the change of life and
[1:09:45] you see these deer hunting and they
[1:09:47] always do the elk hunts and the deer
[1:09:49] hunts right in the rut
[1:09:50] time amen because uh they there's
[1:09:53] chemicals changing in the
[1:09:55] and so what that animal wouldn't do
[1:09:56] under are you listening to me
[1:09:59] what that animal wouldn't do under
[1:10:00] certain circumstances chemicals have
[1:10:02] changed in their body
[1:10:04] and now they're going and doing things
[1:10:06] and they're they're how could i say it
[1:10:07] they're
[1:10:08] they're oblivious to the to the danger
[1:10:10] that's around them
[1:10:12] i wish every young person in tucson is
[1:10:14] in this room right now
[1:10:16] when those chemicals come into their
[1:10:17] body and pretty soon they become
[1:10:19] oblivious
[1:10:20] to the danger around them as they were
[1:10:22] talking about drinking alcohol they know
[1:10:24] that the
[1:10:25] the alcohol diminishes your ability to
[1:10:28] reason and that's where the devil comes
[1:10:31] he comes through that little
[1:10:32] depression a little bit and a little bit
[1:10:34] of blues and somebody's taking their
[1:10:36] some alcohol and then it diminishes
[1:10:37] their their ability to reason and their
[1:10:40] cognitive skills and then pretty soon
[1:10:42] the devil
[1:10:42] has pretty got him in another trap and
[1:10:44] another trap he's got a lot of traps out
[1:10:46] there
[1:10:47] i was thinking about that if you have
[1:10:48] your bibles i want to go to a couple
[1:10:50] scriptures first corinthians chapter 12
[1:10:52] chapter 6. you can put those up i'm
[1:10:56] sorry i i
[1:10:58] some of this women helping with the
[1:11:01] babies they said well we can't turn our
[1:11:02] bibles so
[1:11:03] if it'll help them if you all understand
[1:11:05] that for women
[1:11:07] children holding they're holding the
[1:11:08] babies it's not for we young men that
[1:11:10] need to know where our sword
[1:11:12] some of us don't have our sword sharp we
[1:11:14] need to sharpen them up so
[1:11:16] we'll let them have that and they can
[1:11:18] the brothers want to put those up first
[1:11:19] corinthians chapter 6
[1:11:21] verse 18. we're going to talk some of
[1:11:23] the traps
[1:11:24] so the bible says flee fornication
[1:11:28] talking about traps tonight the bible
[1:11:30] tells us look there's a trap right there
[1:11:31] you need to flee that
[1:11:33] for every sin that a man doeth is
[1:11:35] without the body
[1:11:36] but he that committeth fornication
[1:11:38] sinneth against his own body
[1:11:40] what know ye not that your body is the
[1:11:43] temple of the holy ghost
[1:11:44] which is in you which you have of god
[1:11:47] you are not your own
[1:11:49] you don't have the uh you're not your
[1:11:51] own i probably said this if i
[1:11:53] i preached here before but you you don't
[1:11:55] you you can't tattoo your own body
[1:11:57] you don't have the right to pierce your
[1:11:59] own body because it's not your body
[1:12:02] the bible says you are the temple of the
[1:12:04] holy ghost how many understand what i'm
[1:12:05] saying today
[1:12:06] yeah so the devil will tempt you and get
[1:12:08] you down a thing and
[1:12:10] i've probably said you've heard me say
[1:12:11] before and people go out and they get
[1:12:12] under an illusion get in a trap
[1:12:14] and they tattoo mama on their shoulder
[1:12:17] and then they wish i wish i hadn't
[1:12:19] tattooed mama on that when i was
[1:12:20] inebriated and
[1:12:22] they come back and so the devil has all
[1:12:24] kinds of traps that he traps people in
[1:12:26] that's why we see these markings it
[1:12:28] actually comes from an insecurity
[1:12:30] someone is not securing themselves so
[1:12:32] they have to get an identity that proves
[1:12:34] they are somebody because they're
[1:12:35] identifying with a higher power
[1:12:37] that's why you see all these sports
[1:12:38] figures and all this and they're just
[1:12:40] totally tatted up and down their arms
[1:12:41] and tattooed and
[1:12:43] it's just like you know those are gods
[1:12:44] and whatever those gods do that's what
[1:12:46] their followers start doing
[1:12:48] way way back you probably use somebody
[1:12:50] remember that mr t the guy had an
[1:12:52] earring in his ear and
[1:12:53] way way back there and then you see
[1:12:55] those waves and they come
[1:12:56] and it's just worldliness whatever the
[1:12:59] world does we want to get away from it
[1:13:01] we see those
[1:13:02] trends you know that come through and
[1:13:05] and i was thinking about this
[1:13:06] you know you're not you're bought with a
[1:13:08] price verse 20.
[1:13:10] therefore glorify god in your body
[1:13:12] sometimes that's where we stop but the
[1:13:14] bible says also glorify him in your
[1:13:15] spirit
[1:13:17] i don't feel like smiling today guess
[1:13:20] what you don't have the right to
[1:13:21] make that choice you're not your own
[1:13:23] you're bought with the price and you
[1:13:24] went up here and got baptized some of
[1:13:26] you in that own pool up there
[1:13:27] and you took on the name of jesus christ
[1:13:29] which is hey you watch me i'm a
[1:13:31] christian christ isn't here but i'm
[1:13:33] hearing instead
[1:13:34] you don't have the right to go around
[1:13:35] with a frown in your face
[1:13:38] but some of us get trapped thinking like
[1:13:39] i got the right to do this and we're
[1:13:41] caught in this
[1:13:41] gloom and doom no you need to smile a
[1:13:44] little bit people are looking at you
[1:13:45] when you got baptized they're looking at
[1:13:47] you
[1:13:49] lord help us as christians amen we're
[1:13:52] for the cause of christ
[1:13:54] i was thinking about while we're here
[1:13:55] we'll just go to the next chapter verse
[1:13:57] one now therefore concerning the things
[1:13:59] you
[1:13:59] wrote under me so paul was doing
[1:14:01] questions and answers and they were
[1:14:02] writing hey paul what about this what
[1:14:03] about this what about this
[1:14:05] he said it is good thing for a man not
[1:14:07] to touch a woman
[1:14:10] nevertheless to avoid fornication let
[1:14:12] every man have his own wife and let
[1:14:14] every woman have her own husband
[1:14:16] are we all can we think like adults
[1:14:18] tonight is that okay
[1:14:19] is it okay just to look at the scripture
[1:14:21] so they're writing him about
[1:14:23] things that are happening previous to
[1:14:24] this he says hey look you need to flee
[1:14:26] fornication
[1:14:27] and his next part is hey you wrote me
[1:14:28] about a couple things and it's good for
[1:14:30] a man not to touch a woman
[1:14:32] oh well no but the next verse says
[1:14:36] nevertheless to avoid fornication which
[1:14:37] is unclean living before marriage let
[1:14:39] every man have his own wife
[1:14:41] and be married so there's a time and
[1:14:43] place for those things
[1:14:44] i think we ought to be a bible-believing
[1:14:46] church don't you
[1:14:48] and i think it's good among our young
[1:14:49] people that there's not a lot of that
[1:14:51] going on
[1:14:53] because it's the bible amen because i
[1:14:56] was thinking about how the devil
[1:14:57] he sets a lot of traps for people my
[1:15:00] mother told me one time she said i trust
[1:15:02] you but i don't trust the devil
[1:15:04] he's got a lot of traps out there a lot
[1:15:07] of traps i was thinking we were reading
[1:15:09] so there's 31 proverbs and we read a
[1:15:11] proverb
[1:15:12] there's for every day whatever the day
[1:15:14] of the month is we try to read that
[1:15:16] proverb in the day so
[1:15:17] i was reading that yesterday if you want
[1:15:19] to turn back with me
[1:15:20] proverbs chapter 2 is this just good old
[1:15:23] home cooking
[1:15:25] it's something you can take home and
[1:15:26] chew on tomorrow
[1:15:28] something that'll help you when the
[1:15:29] devil comes when that trap gets there
[1:15:31] you say oh but our brother daniel he
[1:15:33] came from indiana was screaming
[1:15:35] about traps proverbs
[1:15:38] chapter 2 verse number 11. the bible's
[1:15:40] talking about discretion
[1:15:42] shall preserve the understanding shall
[1:15:45] keep thee
[1:15:45] i believe in another problem that says
[1:15:47] with all thy getting get understanding
[1:15:50] that's why i was so slow in school
[1:15:51] because they just wanted you to get it
[1:15:53] and do a
[1:15:54] score and i'm like no i want to
[1:15:55] understand this i have to understand
[1:15:57] because the bible says with all that
[1:15:58] getting
[1:15:59] get understanding if you're a young
[1:16:01] person you want to
[1:16:02] go somewhere in life just try to
[1:16:04] understand i don't understand that some
[1:16:06] things you don't understand it's just
[1:16:07] the way it is
[1:16:09] i can't understand why god uh told us to
[1:16:11] have foot washing
[1:16:13] he's like wait a minute we all got
[1:16:14] showers we all do this
[1:16:16] but jesus said if you don't do it peter
[1:16:18] you have no part with me so after i was
[1:16:19] like i don't care if you understand or
[1:16:20] not that's the word of god
[1:16:22] i don't know why the bible says it's a
[1:16:24] shame for a woman to cut her hair
[1:16:26] but that's what the bible says i don't
[1:16:28] have to understand it i just believe it
[1:16:29] and i just obey it
[1:16:32] but as far as life is the bible says get
[1:16:34] understanding why because understanding
[1:16:36] shall keep thee
[1:16:37] i was thinking about this go down to
[1:16:38] verse 15 understanding
[1:16:41] he goes on to say in 16 to deliver thee
[1:16:44] from the strange woman
[1:16:46] even from the stranger with flatterist
[1:16:48] with her words
[1:16:50] who forsaketh the guide of her youth and
[1:16:52] forgetteth the covenant of her god
[1:16:54] for her house inclineth unto death and
[1:16:57] her paths
[1:16:59] unto the dead none that go unto her
[1:17:02] return again neither take they hold
[1:17:04] of the paths of life so now the bible is
[1:17:08] talking about some of these traps that
[1:17:10] can get a hold
[1:17:11] and we were talking to some of the young
[1:17:12] people how the devil puts
[1:17:14] perverted thoughts in your minds and it
[1:17:16] used to be and i used to say this years
[1:17:18] ago
[1:17:18] there'll be a time that you'll be
[1:17:20] thankful that your boy likes a girl
[1:17:22] there'll come a time to be thankful that
[1:17:23] your girl likes a boy
[1:17:25] because the world has brought all kinds
[1:17:26] of perversion they come and says i don't
[1:17:28] know if i'm
[1:17:29] i'm straight or i'm bisexual transgender
[1:17:31] i don't know
[1:17:32] and so you see all this experimentation
[1:17:34] we were talking last night to the young
[1:17:35] people
[1:17:36] how the suicide rate among the
[1:17:37] transgender is twice what the normal
[1:17:40] suicide rate is
[1:17:42] so people go out and the devil says look
[1:17:44] i know you got the plumbing and the
[1:17:45] hardware for a man but you're really a
[1:17:47] woman
[1:17:48] and so he puts those thoughts and those
[1:17:49] traps in their mind they get caught in
[1:17:51] this trap and they go and they have come
[1:17:53] is this okay i know this is just kind of
[1:17:54] really plain but you know what the devil
[1:17:56] is really playing
[1:17:57] and so if the devil's going to be how
[1:17:58] they say fight fire with fire
[1:18:00] if he's going to be playing let the word
[1:18:02] of god teach us i learned more about
[1:18:03] the things of life in the house of god
[1:18:05] listening to the prophet of god
[1:18:07] preached serpent seed and and marriage
[1:18:09] and divorce and understanding life
[1:18:11] and i was thinking about that how that
[1:18:13] he sets all these traps and will keep us
[1:18:15] from the evil woman
[1:18:16] amen and god help us to have a sound
[1:18:18] mind i don't want to be caught in those
[1:18:20] traps i've seen my friends get caught in
[1:18:21] those traps and
[1:18:22] i've got a couple hear how the lord
[1:18:24] delivered me out of i thought about
[1:18:26] last night let me go back to that other
[1:18:28] because those people they train they
[1:18:29] they go across
[1:18:31] and maybe they have the surgery and then
[1:18:33] they can't get back to the other side
[1:18:35] where they were they're trapped over
[1:18:37] here in some type of perverted
[1:18:38] and the suicide rate those people are
[1:18:40] twice as high as the normal suicide rate
[1:18:43] hey let's just not go there there's one
[1:18:46] thing better than learning from your
[1:18:48] mistake is learn from somebody else's
[1:18:50] mistake and say i'm not going down a
[1:18:52] path
[1:18:52] that i don't know if i'm a man or a
[1:18:54] woman god made me what i am and i am
[1:18:56] what i am
[1:18:57] amen the devil comes in those people's
[1:18:59] minds they puts this
[1:19:01] experimentation thoughts in their mind
[1:19:03] and i've said it before but i'll say it
[1:19:05] again for the sake of our young people
[1:19:06] there
[1:19:07] maybe before they go through a change
[1:19:08] and those chemicals come in a girl
[1:19:10] they're like oh
[1:19:11] boy's got cooties and they come in like
[1:19:12] oh yeah yeah yeah see you don't like
[1:19:14] boys so see you like girls and you like
[1:19:15] to hang around the girls so see you're a
[1:19:17] lesbian
[1:19:18] or a young boy say see you don't like
[1:19:19] girls like that see you're homosexual
[1:19:21] you you just need to love boys and
[1:19:23] and they come in those people's minds
[1:19:25] and my friend john sanger is talking
[1:19:26] about
[1:19:27] i think your cousins are they were
[1:19:28] talking about how they give them those
[1:19:29] injections that don't allow them to go
[1:19:31] into those changes of life so
[1:19:33] so they can get older and then they can
[1:19:35] decide what they are can you imagine the
[1:19:37] insanity that
[1:19:38] to me it's the utmost form of rebellion
[1:19:40] when god says you're this and you say i
[1:19:42] don't want to be that i want to be
[1:19:43] something else
[1:19:44] but they tell me that you can do
[1:19:45] whatever you want to do to change what
[1:19:47] you are but they take one
[1:19:49] extraction of your dna and it tells the
[1:19:51] whole story you are
[1:19:53] what you are what god made you there's
[1:19:56] all kinds of traps there's music traps
[1:19:58] we had a did a little survey at camp one
[1:20:01] time about music and
[1:20:02] i think it was about 80 percent or
[1:20:04] higher of the young people struggled
[1:20:05] with music and
[1:20:07] and bad music and had such an influence
[1:20:09] on them and
[1:20:10] even some of this contemporary music
[1:20:12] that i'm not big on we were talking
[1:20:13] about
[1:20:14] the other day the contemporary music
[1:20:15] they can sing to their boyfriend or
[1:20:17] their girlfriend and then bring the same
[1:20:18] song into church and sing it and there's
[1:20:20] nothing about
[1:20:21] jesus christ or calvary or the blood of
[1:20:23] jesus christ
[1:20:24] i tell you what i like to know who i'm
[1:20:25] singing to i like to know it's jesus
[1:20:28] christ i like to hear
[1:20:29] the blood of jesus christ and what can
[1:20:31] wash away my sins
[1:20:33] nothing but the blood of jesus i love
[1:20:35] him well i don't know
[1:20:36] i love him because he first loved me and
[1:20:38] died on calvary's tree
[1:20:40] there's no question what that song's
[1:20:41] about
[1:20:43] i was telling him the other day i got
[1:20:45] had a cd and somebody said you know
[1:20:46] those that cd or that singer
[1:20:48] uh he did a whole cd and jesus isn't
[1:20:50] even on there i'm like no way
[1:20:52] i went back and listened to cd and twice
[1:20:54] in the whole album
[1:20:55] two times they mentioned the name jesus
[1:20:57] yeah i don't know if they're singing to
[1:20:58] jesus or lucifer and that
[1:21:00] i get a sermon called called the kingdom
[1:21:03] of god and how there's two kingdoms of
[1:21:04] god and the kingdom of the devil and the
[1:21:06] devil's
[1:21:06] wanting to blend them together the bible
[1:21:09] says
[1:21:09] god of this evil age he sits in the
[1:21:11] temple of god worshiped as god and
[1:21:13] people think they're worshiping jesus
[1:21:14] christ and they might be giving glory to
[1:21:16] another
[1:21:17] another venue there so i pray god will
[1:21:20] help us to not
[1:21:21] get like the world and the things of the
[1:21:23] world and it all yeah i tell you you can
[1:21:24] hear a little bit of that stuff and then
[1:21:26] you hear the christian stuff and it's
[1:21:27] it's funny how the christian people are
[1:21:28] listening to the worldly people
[1:21:31] to get their saying and they sound like
[1:21:34] everybody's about to
[1:21:34] die and die of a fixation and you know
[1:21:37] and
[1:21:39] and you know it's just really funny and
[1:21:41] it's all sad and
[1:21:43] it's like wait why don't you just sing
[1:21:45] your song
[1:21:48] you know it's really amazing though when
[1:21:49] you hear the christian people and it
[1:21:51] matches the worldly people we shouldn't
[1:21:52] be going to the world to get our
[1:21:53] inspiration
[1:21:55] amen our inspiration comes from christ
[1:21:58] i'll tell you another trap is a time

[1:22:03] other day said hey i got this mower i'll
[1:22:05] give to you i said i don't want your

[1:22:09] gotta winterize it i gotta sharpen the
[1:22:11] blades and i gotta do all that stuff
[1:22:12] it's a time trap
[1:22:14] we need to realize what our priorities
[1:22:16] in life and the things that you can shed
[1:22:17] away from here
[1:22:18] just get rid of it i ask you man hey
[1:22:21] i'll give you a 66
[1:22:23] mustang a 1966 mustang okay what are you

[1:22:29] you have to grind that and sand it all
[1:22:30] down and buy a new upholstery and get on
[1:22:32] the internet and get this and get a
[1:22:33] paint booth and get all this stuff and
[1:22:34] this and this
[1:22:35] pretty soon you're not going to church
[1:22:36] because you got this may god help us to
[1:22:38] realize where the time traps off say hey
[1:22:40] get rid of this stuff and pretty soon
[1:22:42] you can't read your bible can't pray
[1:22:43] can't go to church where you're trapped
[1:22:45] in a trap of time
[1:22:46] how many say amen to that right now the
[1:22:48] holy spirit may be dealing with you you
[1:22:49] need to get rid of all implants
[1:22:54] brother daniel are you preaching against
[1:22:55] plants no i'm not preaching against
[1:22:56] plants
[1:22:57] i'm talking about traps that trap you
[1:23:00] away from god
[1:23:02] blessed be the name of the lord i sat on
[1:23:04] an airplane it's good to laugh once a
[1:23:06] while like we said sunday it's like a
[1:23:07] medicine
[1:23:08] sat on an airplane lady had her tablet
[1:23:11] and she's playing this game matching the
[1:23:13] donuts and
[1:23:14] donuts and danishes and dude she's doing
[1:23:15] like lady
[1:23:17] what in the world why don't you do
[1:23:20] something productive
[1:23:21] i'm sitting there with my headphones on
[1:23:23] you know writing my sermon down
[1:23:25] on a thing and you know she's playing
[1:23:27] the donut thing and it's like
[1:23:29] lady and you see these video games you
[1:23:33] see
[1:23:34] growing men with careers trapped in a
[1:23:36] video game
[1:23:37] and it's totally waste of time and
[1:23:39] they're trapped in hours and hours into
[1:23:41] the night
[1:23:42] and you get all done and shut it down
[1:23:43] like hey what have you accomplished
[1:23:45] well i feel better and you know what it
[1:23:47] is a lot of times those videos games
[1:23:49] men cannot achieve something in the real
[1:23:51] world so they go to the virtual world
[1:23:53] and try to become
[1:23:54] great and they feel like they're
[1:23:55] empowered i say we need to get back into
[1:23:58] the real world jesus said go into all
[1:24:00] the world and preach the gospel and
[1:24:01] accomplish something for the kingdom of
[1:24:03] god
[1:24:03] there's a couple verses i want to talk
[1:24:05] about maybe i don't want to get ahead of
[1:24:06] myself here but
[1:24:07] another trap is a body trap
[1:24:10] body trap it's it's something that
[1:24:12] instantly comes and it just crushes your
[1:24:14] whole body
[1:24:15] it's an instant like the and so it just
[1:24:18] crushes you and how many people you see
[1:24:19] get caught in a trap maybe a situation
[1:24:21] at church and it just crushes their
[1:24:23] spiritual life i've seen sometimes
[1:24:25] things that happen to a minister and the
[1:24:27] minister
[1:24:27] maybe take a a bad road and it just
[1:24:29] crushes and the church just all goes to
[1:24:31] the world like
[1:24:32] hey wait a minute were you tied to
[1:24:34] christ and the cross of christ or were
[1:24:36] you tied to a man
[1:24:39] my goal is to tie people to jesus christ
[1:24:41] so tight
[1:24:42] that something would happen to brother
[1:24:43] daniel they'd just walk right on with
[1:24:45] christ say
[1:24:46] he's not my salvation he was nothing but
[1:24:48] a sign pointing me to the rapture and
[1:24:50] trying to keep me on the path
[1:24:52] blessed be the name of the lord people
[1:24:54] lose their job and they
[1:24:56] you know and or maybe they they uh um
[1:24:58] they
[1:24:59] go through a divorce and it just crushes
[1:25:01] their desire for god
[1:25:02] may god help us to run from those traps
[1:25:06] amen i'm watching the time back there
[1:25:08] let's go through a couple more one is a
[1:25:10] i'm going to call them a live trap you
[1:25:12] know the devil loves this live trap
[1:25:15] probably some of you all have them i
[1:25:16] don't know if you boys have them but
[1:25:18] they're little square
[1:25:19] traps about this square and they're
[1:25:21] they're metal wire and they're about
[1:25:23] that maybe that longer they have the big
[1:25:24] one
[1:25:24] my nephew got one it was a coyote one
[1:25:26] about that big and
[1:25:28] you go pull the door up have you anybody
[1:25:30] ever seen those and you
[1:25:32] pull the door up it has a little tray
[1:25:33] going or you put some food in there cat
[1:25:35] food
[1:25:36] and this little animal sniffs all around
[1:25:38] it then they go in the door and the door
[1:25:40] falls down
[1:25:41] on them and he's still alive
[1:25:44] the animal is very much alive inside
[1:25:48] but they're trapped
[1:25:51] they're trapped they're no more free
[1:25:55] and it's just a matter of time till they
[1:25:57] die of starvation
[1:26:00] because they can't eat and then they
[1:26:03] they die
[1:26:03] of they don't have any water so they
[1:26:05] become dehydrated
[1:26:07] this is more than just a sermon how many
[1:26:09] people you see that are just dying out
[1:26:11] there and they don't have the spirit of
[1:26:12] god remember brother em talks about
[1:26:14] arizona those little
[1:26:15] leaves that twist up and they become
[1:26:17] prickly and they just like
[1:26:18] criticize this and this and this and and
[1:26:21] this is wrong that's wrong
[1:26:22] that's wrong and that's wrong like are
[1:26:25] you in a trap somewhere
[1:26:26] you just need a good old dose of the
[1:26:28] holy ghost you need to
[1:26:30] water the holy ghost just to come down
[1:26:32] on you you become
[1:26:33] soft and pliable and we see people like
[1:26:36] that there they're dying of starvation
[1:26:38] maybe they've got all the books and the
[1:26:39] tapes and and they can they they have it
[1:26:41] all right there but they're in a trap
[1:26:43] somewhere and they start eating they
[1:26:44] start
[1:26:45] getting that water of the holy ghost
[1:26:48] oh blessed be the name of the lord i
[1:26:50] want to stay hydrated in god's spirit
[1:26:54] it's important you know here a couple
[1:26:57] months ago i don't know how long ago i
[1:26:59] had a trouble i couldn't read
[1:27:01] i was like why can't i and i have
[1:27:03] contacts
[1:27:05] i don't know if it's just my age and i
[1:27:07] realize i'm not drinking enough water
[1:27:09] to keep my body hydrated so when my eyes
[1:27:11] blink i'm not putting moisture on my
[1:27:13] eyes
[1:27:14] and because i are you listening to me
[1:27:16] because i wasn't getting
[1:27:18] enough water and in the spirit you're
[1:27:20] not getting enough water
[1:27:21] you see things a little blurry
[1:27:25] so you know what i did about it i fixed
[1:27:26] the problem i have a daytime every day i
[1:27:28] go into work and i have this day timer
[1:27:30] the first thing on it i do is drink 20
[1:27:32] ounces of water so i have a cup of water
[1:27:34] get a water
[1:27:35] a gallon jug dump in 20 ounces chug it
[1:27:38] down set it down
[1:27:39] boom done with that mark it off my day
[1:27:40] time and it'd do us all good for
[1:27:43] us to have a little spiritual thing of
[1:27:45] hydration when i wake up this morning i
[1:27:47] need to spend some time with jesus
[1:27:49] christ and
[1:27:50] read my bible and get down and pray and
[1:27:52] say lord i need you today lord
[1:27:54] i need the holy ghost i need the love of
[1:27:56] god like we
[1:27:57] had lunch with sister heather yesterday
[1:27:59] and she said you know i was
[1:28:00] growing up as a nominal christian i just
[1:28:02] said lord i love you so much if there's
[1:28:03] anything else you want me to do i'll do
[1:28:05] it lord
[1:28:06] and then god began to reveal more to her
[1:28:08] and more to her
[1:28:10] and just we sing that little song let me
[1:28:11] fall in love with you all over again
[1:28:14] we fall in love and just become hydrated
[1:28:16] and we get out of those traps
[1:28:18] if you have your bibles luke chapter 21
[1:28:22] talking about the trap so these are some
[1:28:23] good ones here and they're written in
[1:28:24] the bible so i'm just going to preach
[1:28:26] through this one
[1:28:28] luke chapter 21 verse 34.
[1:28:32] the bible says take heed to yourselves
[1:28:34] or take attention now this is really
[1:28:36] good we're going to get the internet
[1:28:37] here in the bible
[1:28:39] lest at any time your heart should be
[1:28:42] overwhelmed
[1:28:43] with surfing
[1:28:46] ah that's good right there brother
[1:28:48] daniel it says surfing yeah i know i
[1:28:50] looked it up surfing
[1:28:51] an excess of amount of something
[1:28:54] an excessive amount of something might
[1:28:57] as well put surfing in there right
[1:28:59] brother ram talks about these young
[1:29:01] people being caught in the devil's web
[1:29:03] and they can't get out of the devil's
[1:29:05] web years before the
[1:29:07] www i don't know if any of you all
[1:29:09] google anything or put anything on the
[1:29:10] internet but it's always it used to be
[1:29:12] www
[1:29:13] they've made the browser smarter now so
[1:29:15] you don't have to put www
[1:29:17] in there the browser puts it in and you
[1:29:18] don't even see it but it's called the
[1:29:20] world wide
[1:29:21] web that people are entangled in and
[1:29:24] they can't
[1:29:26] he said lest your heart be overcharged
[1:29:28] with surfeiting
[1:29:30] an excessive amount of something and
[1:29:33] drunkenness what is drunkenness it's an
[1:29:35] intoxication
[1:29:36] and we see people are being become
[1:29:38] intoxicated with the things of the world
[1:29:40] hobbies and sports and they become so
[1:29:42] intoxicated with their
[1:29:44] the things of the world they don't even
[1:29:45] care about the thing that's why that's
[1:29:47] how you can tell somebody that's
[1:29:48] intoxicated
[1:29:49] they they're not they're distant from
[1:29:51] reality the things that should mean
[1:29:53] something don't mean anything
[1:29:55] they get really drunk and they're
[1:29:56] driving down the road and they don't
[1:29:57] even care that they've crossed the
[1:29:59] center line how many people can you look
[1:30:01] at today and say
[1:30:02] that person is drunk they're drunk on
[1:30:04] lady osea and the intoxication of our
[1:30:06] world
[1:30:07] whether it's the pleasures of world and
[1:30:09] the love of the world and the things of
[1:30:10] the world jesus said the love of god's
[1:30:12] name
[1:30:12] not even in you lord help us today
[1:30:15] he goes on to say and the cares of this
[1:30:20] life so that that day come upon you
[1:30:22] unawares
[1:30:24] for as a snare there it is again as a
[1:30:26] trap jesus is saying it's going to come
[1:30:28] like a trap
[1:30:30] it's just going to bite you as a trap as
[1:30:34] a snare shall
[1:30:34] it come upon all them that dwell on the
[1:30:37] face of the earth so he tells us the
[1:30:39] the way to uh to to get out of this trap
[1:30:41] of missing the rapture
[1:30:43] he said watch ye therefore and pray
[1:30:45] always
[1:30:46] it's so important that you pray i don't
[1:30:48] know i'm what do they call it a
[1:30:50] compulsive ex thing whatever that is you
[1:30:52] know when i was young they never had a
[1:30:54] name for all those disorders
[1:30:57] because if i had got tested for them i'd
[1:30:58] probably had a bunch of them and so
[1:31:02] you know you just live your life and
[1:31:04] that what is it attention deficit
[1:31:06] disorder and some of those and
[1:31:07] i've got friends that they diagnose them
[1:31:09] with that and they're running million
[1:31:10] dollar companies today
[1:31:12] the devil wants you to give a little
[1:31:13] something there maybe you're not like
[1:31:15] everybody else he wants to give you a
[1:31:16] little tag and you sit in the corner and
[1:31:18] do
[1:31:18] don't do anything i say i don't i don't
[1:31:21] know i was born and
[1:31:22] lord here i am on the earth and i might
[1:31:24] have a handicap here i got a lot of
[1:31:25] handicaps but i'm doing my best
[1:31:28] that i can with my handicaps for the
[1:31:29] lord jesus christ
[1:31:31] i want to do all that i can when i get
[1:31:33] there and he said i know daniel i gave
[1:31:34] you this handicap
[1:31:35] and this handicap and this handicap but
[1:31:37] my look what you did for god's kingdom
[1:31:38] with all those handicapped
[1:31:40] there was paul he's sitting there he
[1:31:41] said lord i've asked you to take away
[1:31:43] this blinded i could write better
[1:31:45] letters and be a better messengers and
[1:31:47] god said
[1:31:48] my grace is sufficient for you because
[1:31:50] my strength is made perfect in the fact
[1:31:52] that you have a handicap paul
[1:31:55] oh my god help us to release ourselves
[1:31:57] from the trap
[1:31:58] your trap the devil might tell you hey
[1:32:00] you're getting old you're not useless
[1:32:02] you're not useful in the kingdom oh it's
[1:32:04] a trap of the devil
[1:32:06] i mean you become more powerful in your
[1:32:08] ministry i think i said this here before
[1:32:09] but i'll say it again i was on that
[1:32:11] plane and that lady
[1:32:12] said hey merry christmas to you all and
[1:32:14] i'm too old to care if i
[1:32:16] offend anybody and she realized she had
[1:32:19] a mission
[1:32:20] to proclaim christmas or or whatever
[1:32:22] christ's birth in her way
[1:32:24] but you also have it to say whatever
[1:32:26] there comes an age i'll just say this
[1:32:27] there comes an age
[1:32:28] i don't know what that age is where you
[1:32:30] can say anything and people can't do
[1:32:31] anything about it
[1:32:33] and i say as i get older i don't know
[1:32:36] what that is
[1:32:37] i know it'll come but you say i believe
[1:32:39] jesus christ is the son of god that died
[1:32:40] on the cross to take away my sins
[1:32:42] and you're sitting in the doctor's
[1:32:43] office what are they going to do to you
[1:32:47] just say it praise god
[1:32:50] hallelujah jesus is my savior there's
[1:32:53] only one true god
[1:32:54] his name is jesus christ what are they
[1:32:57] going to do to you
[1:32:59] i say we start each one of us go into
[1:33:01] our world and preach the gospel of jesus
[1:33:03] christ
[1:33:04] you can go do things that i could never
[1:33:06] ever do william branham could never go
[1:33:07] into your world but you have an
[1:33:09] opportunity
[1:33:11] only god releases from the traps that
[1:33:13] the devil's got us in
[1:33:15] so many other ones i was thinking about
[1:33:16] the parable matthew 13 we don't have
[1:33:18] time to
[1:33:18] to to to the bible says that the word of
[1:33:20] god was sown and the persecution the
[1:33:22] cares of this life
[1:33:24] oh here's one the deceitfulness of
[1:33:26] riches
[1:33:28] and people get trapped i gotta have so
[1:33:30] much money i've got to have so
[1:33:32] and pretty soon they start laying aside
[1:33:33] the things of god to get this money
[1:33:36] and the bible says there's a
[1:33:37] deceitfulness with riches
[1:33:39] i tell you when it starts taking you out
[1:33:41] of church and getting your priorities
[1:33:43] wrong
[1:33:43] i say it's time to lay aside those
[1:33:46] things
[1:33:46] i've got another i you know i don't know
[1:33:49] it's there's somewhere in these notes
[1:33:50] but
[1:33:51] i was thinking about that because the
[1:33:52] devil will put you in a trap i
[1:33:54] almost got trapped in that one time i
[1:33:56] somebody came to me i'm gonna find it in
[1:33:57] these things if i have to it's the last
[1:33:59] thing i do
[1:34:00] oh it's it's a it's a free trap
[1:34:03] here's one called a free trap some of
[1:34:04] you all really get caught in these free
[1:34:06] traps
[1:34:06] i got news for you nothing's free
[1:34:11] you gotta love my wife but
[1:34:14] i give her an email address and with
[1:34:16] just a little bit of time it's just
[1:34:18] overflowing with all this stuff
[1:34:21] well i signed up for this and signed up
[1:34:23] for this since i all said
[1:34:24] you know they have the devil has an
[1:34:26] agenda what you thought was free
[1:34:28] and they're data mining all your
[1:34:29] demographics and your age and
[1:34:31] your your all that stuff so they can
[1:34:33] send you the right kind of advertisement
[1:34:34] from this place and i don't even know
[1:34:36] all the places she gets their emails and
[1:34:37] stuff from
[1:34:38] and you thought it was free and the
[1:34:40] devil's got a i remember when we were
[1:34:42] young
[1:34:42] we just got married we were poor's job's
[1:34:44] turkey we were
[1:34:46] really poor and somebody came along and
[1:34:48] said look hey we'll offer you free rent
[1:34:50] in this house
[1:34:51] okay great great what's the catch oh you
[1:34:54] just have to work off the
[1:34:55] the rent you got to work it off on the
[1:34:58] weekends
[1:34:59] every day you got to work when you come
[1:35:00] home from work you got to go work and
[1:35:01] then i realized you know what
[1:35:02] that ain't free that ain't free it's
[1:35:05] going to cost me a lot probably cost my
[1:35:07] marriage
[1:35:07] cost my walk with the lord i can't go to
[1:35:09] church because i'm trying to
[1:35:10] you know get this free house you know
[1:35:13] and i tell you what the bible says
[1:35:14] you'll know the truth and the truth will
[1:35:16] make you free
[1:35:18] and i learned there was a verse in the
[1:35:20] bible it was over in matthew chapter 6
[1:35:22] verse 33 it said seek ye
[1:35:24] first the kingdom of god and all these
[1:35:27] things will be added unto you
[1:35:30] and i took the the escape and you'll
[1:35:33] know the truth that will set you free
[1:35:34] and it set me free hey i don't need your
[1:35:36] free house
[1:35:37] because it's really going to put me in
[1:35:38] bondage as a trap
[1:35:41] oh i could have more money in this world
[1:35:43] but what about my soul what would a
[1:35:44] prosperous man if he gained the whole
[1:35:46] world and he lost his soul
[1:35:49] what about our children hey we'll make
[1:35:50] our children they'll be a way of that
[1:35:52] but what if they lose their soul
[1:35:53] we need to get our priorities right is
[1:35:55] jesus christ
[1:35:57] amen our number one priority is a parent
[1:35:59] to lead our children to jesus christ
[1:36:02] i was thinking about those traps i heard
[1:36:03] the story about these wild boars and
[1:36:05] you know they were wild they run around
[1:36:07] they just wanted food and it was free
[1:36:08] food and so what the people did is they
[1:36:10] put a trap they put
[1:36:11] a bucket of food down and then they put
[1:36:12] up one fence right here
[1:36:14] and the boars all come in at night and
[1:36:16] ate it and they ran off and
[1:36:17] next day they brought more food and put
[1:36:18] it up there and they put a gate here
[1:36:20] and every day they did that and they put
[1:36:22] another gate and they never even noticed
[1:36:23] the gates because they were getting free
[1:36:25] food
[1:36:25] oh listen to me now they put another
[1:36:27] gate up and they put another gate up and
[1:36:29] put the food out then they had another
[1:36:30] one they went up and they all went in
[1:36:31] and they dropped it
[1:36:33] and they're trapped and you know what
[1:36:35] they didn't even care because they
[1:36:36] started getting free food
[1:36:38] and they weren't free anymore oh my
[1:36:40] goodness i'd rather be free in the holy
[1:36:42] ghost
[1:36:43] amen where the spirit of the lord is
[1:36:45] there's liberty lord i want to be free
[1:36:47] in the holy spirit blessed be the name
[1:36:49] of the lord
[1:36:50] i want to be free to love him you know
[1:36:53] we got some experience with these traps
[1:36:55] my boys
[1:36:56] they homeschooled and one day they
[1:36:57] caught a skunk
[1:36:59] one of these live traps and they had
[1:37:02] this bright idea and skunk's got to
[1:37:04] raise his tail to spray brother matt and
[1:37:06] they said well
[1:37:06] i don't think he can raise his tail well
[1:37:08] he could raise his tail
[1:37:10] and i sprayed my boy william they
[1:37:12] sprayed it all over and they actually
[1:37:13] were homeschooling the top of our
[1:37:14] business they come in and the whole
[1:37:15] place just stunk
[1:37:17] and my son you know he's brilliant he's
[1:37:18] like oh i think i can mask this he had
[1:37:21] to go to work a little after i think
[1:37:22] so he goes in the bathroom and gets his
[1:37:23] febreze spray sprays it all over like
[1:37:27] and we laugh oh that's funny but
[1:37:29] sometimes we do that with sin
[1:37:30] and we get the skunk of the devil all
[1:37:32] over us and we try to get this spray and
[1:37:34] try to mask it
[1:37:35] i mean it's like a leopard trying to
[1:37:37] lick his spots off he just wipes
[1:37:39] everything off so that those spots are
[1:37:40] more blatant
[1:37:42] amen and we just need the blood of jesus
[1:37:44] christ to cleanse us from our sins and
[1:37:46] cleanse us from all the effects of that
[1:37:48] old skunk of the devil if i ever knew a
[1:37:49] skunk it was the devil
[1:37:51] sometimes we don't think he's going to
[1:37:52] get us but he gets us
[1:37:54] may we come to the cross of christ and
[1:37:57] let god cleanse us
[1:38:00] i don't know how to preach but
[1:38:03] sometimes the devil comes and say well
[1:38:05] god's children don't get in traps
[1:38:07] well i think brother branham was
[1:38:08] probably a child of god he got caught in
[1:38:10] a trap
[1:38:12] he went over to africa over there his
[1:38:14] missionary trip to africa brother
[1:38:15] billy's with him 16 year old to get in
[1:38:17] the car and they
[1:38:18] said the angel of the lord told me to go
[1:38:19] to here and they they had this agenda
[1:38:20] said well you're going here you're going
[1:38:21] here and you're going here
[1:38:23] billy paul if you listen he said he said
[1:38:25] that's not what the angel lord he said
[1:38:26] well that's what you're doing he didn't
[1:38:28] have a cell phone he gave didn't
[1:38:29] car he didn't have any money he had
[1:38:31] nothing so he went with the brothers and
[1:38:33] he stopped the car he got them all out
[1:38:34] he lined them all up on the road brother
[1:38:35] billy said he took dirt and threw it all
[1:38:37] up on their feet
[1:38:38] he said i'm going with you because i
[1:38:40] don't have any choice but god's going to
[1:38:41] make us all pay for it he was caught in
[1:38:42] a trap
[1:38:44] you come back home you've probably read
[1:38:45] it and brother ram tells it on tape he
[1:38:47] said i was sick for a month had the
[1:38:48] amoebas in my stomach
[1:38:50] and he said he was just thought he was
[1:38:51] going to die he said i learned a lesson
[1:38:53] he said i'll never listen to
[1:38:55] ministers or anything that takes me away
[1:38:57] from the
[1:38:58] angel the lord and the word of god
[1:39:00] there's something better than learning
[1:39:02] from our own mistakes that's learning
[1:39:03] from somebody else's mistakes a trap
[1:39:05] that the prophet said i'm not going to
[1:39:06] get in that trap
[1:39:07] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:39:09] sometimes ministers get caught in traps
[1:39:12] you know i was thinking about that how
[1:39:13] that you know as this coronavirus it's
[1:39:15] it's
[1:39:16] it's it's real it's not a it's a real
[1:39:19] virus
[1:39:21] and and you know it's many of you maybe
[1:39:23] had it and god's healed you and
[1:39:25] the bible didn't say we'd get sick he
[1:39:27] said many are the afflictions of the
[1:39:28] righteous
[1:39:29] but the lord will deliver them out of
[1:39:31] them all so many of us have had it and
[1:39:33] god's healed i think the
[1:39:35] recovery rate is 99.7 recovery rate
[1:39:39] so we were talking about it as a
[1:39:40] minister because we're not running a
[1:39:41] medical institution we're running a sin
[1:39:43] institution and so i was thinking about
[1:39:46] there's a
[1:39:46] coronavirus but there's a sin virus that
[1:39:49] is much more deadly than the coronavirus
[1:39:52] listen to me now
[1:39:53] jesus said fear not him that is able to
[1:39:55] destroy the body
[1:39:56] but him that is able to destroy the soul
[1:39:59] and the body
[1:40:00] and listen to me because jesus said this
[1:40:03] thing is
[1:40:04] highly contagious it's just not contact
[1:40:07] and we're in a mass
[1:40:08] jesus said whosoever looketh
[1:40:12] upon a woman that's committed you mean
[1:40:14] you can get this virus by just
[1:40:16] look yes and you know what the fatality
[1:40:19] rate is
[1:40:20] a hundred percent of people that don't
[1:40:22] get the vaccine
[1:40:25] people that get the sin virus 100
[1:40:28] fatality rate
[1:40:29] i was reading over there thinking about
[1:40:30] the scripture over in in romans the
[1:40:32] wages of sin
[1:40:34] the end of sin is death eternal
[1:40:37] separation from god
[1:40:38] oh but thanks be to god that he created
[1:40:40] a virus amen
[1:40:42] uh uh uh how did brother ham say an
[1:40:44] inoculation from the virus
[1:40:46] amen and not just didn't pick a human
[1:40:48] himself
[1:40:49] amen jesus christ took the inoculation
[1:40:51] he said i no man takes my life from me i
[1:40:54] lay my life down and i'll take it up
[1:40:56] again
[1:40:57] and see if this inoculation that's in me
[1:40:59] amen will bring me
[1:41:00] out of the death bring it bring me out
[1:41:02] of the grave oh blessed be the name of
[1:41:05] the lord
[1:41:05] how does it say it over in romans amen
[1:41:07] how jesus say in revelation he said i am
[1:41:09] he that was alive
[1:41:10] was dead and i am alive forevermore and
[1:41:13] have the keys of death hell in the grave
[1:41:15] romans 80 said
[1:41:16] and if the same spirit that raised me
[1:41:18] from the dead
[1:41:19] dwell in you oh blessed be the name of
[1:41:22] the lord
[1:41:23] it will quicken your mortal body oh i'm
[1:41:26] so thankful
[1:41:27] if you're talking about death and you
[1:41:28] know age is kind of creeping up on me a
[1:41:30] little bit there i see
[1:41:31] i see it out there i want to know in
[1:41:33] whom i have believed
[1:41:34] and be persuaded that he's able to keep
[1:41:36] that which i've committed unto him
[1:41:38] against that day
[1:41:39] i want somebody that has some experience
[1:41:40] with maybe will write books and like
[1:41:42] life after death live
[1:41:43] are they like oh i ain't seen a big
[1:41:44] break light oh my goodness i want to
[1:41:46] talk to the man that created life
[1:41:48] the man that is life who died and rose
[1:41:50] again and said daniel if my spirit
[1:41:52] dwells in you it'll quicken your body
[1:41:55] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:41:58] hallelujah
[1:41:59] i was thinking about that my i've got
[1:42:02] something here but i'm
[1:42:03] i'm just going to skip that we'll skip
[1:42:04] that trap how's that sound
[1:42:07] but i was thinking about that sometimes
[1:42:09] people they get caught in traps and they
[1:42:10] take detours
[1:42:12] i just get take detours i was thinking
[1:42:15] about that we call them back home we
[1:42:16] call them one man denominations
[1:42:18] and somebody will come in and say look
[1:42:21] that thing's wrong right there
[1:42:22] i take a little detour and they don't
[1:42:24] just go themselves they take their whole
[1:42:25] family with them and they go on
[1:42:26] a detour and it's just really it's sad
[1:42:31] and i was dealing with situation here
[1:42:32] some time back and actually somebody
[1:42:34] used to go to this church 20
[1:42:35] 25 years ago and they just got something
[1:42:38] in the church and boom they went off and
[1:42:40] then i'd
[1:42:40] end up with their family way off later
[1:42:42] and the mother sits down with me and
[1:42:43] said man we took a 20-year detour
[1:42:46] 20 you dear in their family motorcycles
[1:42:49] and leather and all kinds of bars and
[1:42:51] drinking all
[1:42:52] and you know what i was thinking we
[1:42:53] don't have 20 years to go on a detour
[1:42:56] we don't have 20 years on it to go on a
[1:42:58] detour i say lord don't let me get
[1:43:00] caught in a trap
[1:43:01] i'll say this when you see traps and you
[1:43:03] know you're in treacherous time you walk
[1:43:04] slower
[1:43:06] you walk really slow and you move start
[1:43:08] moving slow you don't
[1:43:10] rush and because somebody maybe somebody
[1:43:12] were in the military and they had minds
[1:43:13] and you start walking really slow in a
[1:43:15] minefield and you start
[1:43:16] and we start praying more we don't make
[1:43:19] rash decisions we say lord let me pray
[1:43:21] let me be
[1:43:22] you know i'm going to skip over some
[1:43:24] more of this stuff but we need to pray
[1:43:26] more i'm big on prayer
[1:43:27] if you're around me we're going to be
[1:43:29] praying
[1:43:31] because that's the way jesus said pray
[1:43:33] pray watch and pray
[1:43:35] i'm going to talk about another trap
[1:43:36] just a couple more and then we're going
[1:43:37] to close
[1:43:39] another trap is not a box it's a poison
[1:43:42] trap
[1:43:45] and maybe you have rats somewhere and
[1:43:47] you put out that decon and it poison
[1:43:48] that
[1:43:49] rat in just the poison it doesn't kill
[1:43:51] him
[1:43:52] it just slows him down listen to me that
[1:43:55] he doesn't perform like he used to
[1:43:57] before
[1:43:59] it just slows in and how many people
[1:44:01] have allowed the devil
[1:44:02] something to be added to their to their
[1:44:05] spiritual person and they don't function
[1:44:07] like a real son of god
[1:44:08] should or a real daughter of god and
[1:44:10] they've become poisoned
[1:44:13] i was reading something you know i don't
[1:44:15] like i don't
[1:44:16] like go hey i'm gonna study this and
[1:44:18] then go search everywhere brother ram
[1:44:20] said traps and just come back with a
[1:44:21] whole list of quotes that's just not me
[1:44:22] i get down and pray and
[1:44:24] spend hours in that room today down on
[1:44:26] my knees pray and say lord what do you
[1:44:27] want to say
[1:44:28] the holy spirit says what about this and
[1:44:30] what about this and what about this
[1:44:32] and i was thinking about this and i when
[1:44:35] i was just thinking about this poisoning
[1:44:37] how that those are traps we see so many
[1:44:38] people
[1:44:39] they're not dead maybe even still come
[1:44:41] to church but they're poisoned in their
[1:44:42] spirit and they just don't function they
[1:44:44] can't raise their hands they can't
[1:44:45] worship god
[1:44:46] they don't have a testimony and they've
[1:44:47] just got poison in their system
[1:44:50] and i was thinking about this brother
[1:44:51] man says listen god's provided way in
[1:44:53] 1965 he said and now we've come
[1:44:55] right straight back again here we sit
[1:44:58] this afternoon on the west coast
[1:45:01] he said where the sin barrier of all the
[1:45:03] powers of darkness heaps in here and
[1:45:05] and these movies listen to me we're
[1:45:06] talking about poison in a christian's
[1:45:08] life
[1:45:09] and these movies and television cast and
[1:45:12] these men kissing women on there
[1:45:14] and poisoning the minds of little girls
[1:45:18] and now the prophet is saying yeah
[1:45:20] there's these traps and there's this
[1:45:22] poison you put in your mind how's it get
[1:45:24] in there through your eyes
[1:45:25] the eyes are the gate to the soul and
[1:45:27] the prophet god said you're looking at
[1:45:28] that and it's putting poison down in
[1:45:30] your soul
[1:45:32] he said did you know that a man that
[1:45:33] potentially he's all right if i just
[1:45:35] read it
[1:45:35] you know if i read it it's not me it's
[1:45:37] him that was my friend the other day
[1:45:39] they were talking about
[1:45:40] him being a racist he said hey i was
[1:45:42] just quoting the prophet you know if you
[1:45:43] want to
[1:45:44] call the prophet a racist you know i was
[1:45:47] just reading him
[1:45:48] he said did you know any man that kisses
[1:45:50] a woman is morally obligated to marry
[1:45:52] her
[1:45:53] potentially it's a sex sex act sure it
[1:45:55] is yes it is what is it it's male glands
[1:45:58] and a in a man's lip and a female glands
[1:46:01] when a male and female glands comes
[1:46:03] together it's sex
[1:46:04] he said look on hollywood and look at
[1:46:05] these little girls laying out here in
[1:46:07] the parks and
[1:46:08] boys wallering around over here and
[1:46:09] these girls and things like that and
[1:46:11] even singing in the choirs
[1:46:13] now the problem of god is talking about
[1:46:14] the kissing and all this wallering
[1:46:15] around and then they want to get up on
[1:46:17] the stage and they want to sing
[1:46:19] oh my we can't let that happen the
[1:46:21] prophet of god is condemning that
[1:46:23] but then you can't let that happen
[1:46:25] that's right we can't let that happen we
[1:46:26] gotta
[1:46:26] hey man let right be right and let wrong
[1:46:28] be wrong is that okay
[1:46:30] i'm just reading it right here out and
[1:46:31] he said and look at hollywood and these
[1:46:33] little girls laying out here in the
[1:46:34] parks and boys walking around looking
[1:46:36] like
[1:46:36] and these elvis presleys and so far that
[1:46:38] we have today it's a disgrace to the
[1:46:40] name of
[1:46:40] of america to what our forefathers
[1:46:43] fought and bled and died for
[1:46:45] and so i say that to say now the prophet
[1:46:47] is talking about poisoning
[1:46:48] social media wasn't even around facebook
[1:46:51] and twitter and instagram and all the
[1:46:53] other
[1:46:54] uh things you know it's like they were
[1:46:55] talking about the jebusites and the
[1:46:57] hittites and the
[1:46:58] amorites and all those when they forgot
[1:47:00] one more that's real big in our day is
[1:47:01] the websites
[1:47:03] the websites those are some giants
[1:47:07] are probably greater than the hittites
[1:47:08] and the amorites and the jebusites is
[1:47:10] the websites
[1:47:11] amen we need to take the word of god and
[1:47:13] destroy those enemies before they
[1:47:15] destroy us
[1:47:17] destroy our family brother ram said the
[1:47:19] television sent our women to the dogs
[1:47:21] and
[1:47:22] men go off to work and then they let
[1:47:23] their wife sit home and just watch all
[1:47:25] these things where
[1:47:26] they minimize the man make him nothing
[1:47:27] but a mouse and he's a no good thing
[1:47:29] you know and hey you're the rule of the
[1:47:31] house and like what man would let his
[1:47:32] wife sit home with that nonsense knowing
[1:47:34] that that could
[1:47:34] tear the very heart of his marriage out
[1:47:37] may god help us to apply the token
[1:47:39] and we see those poisons and sports and
[1:47:41] gossip and
[1:47:43] and shooting and killing one another and
[1:47:45] and hollywood and music
[1:47:47] and poisoning the minds and we've dealt
[1:47:49] with with young people like hey
[1:47:50] brother dan you need to get a grip you
[1:47:53] know brother ramsay i know he said the
[1:47:54] kisses at the first kisses at the altar
[1:47:56] but hey man this is
[1:47:57] 20 21 that doesn't happen well you're
[1:48:00] right in your world it maybe doesn't
[1:48:02] happen when you're poisoning your mind
[1:48:04] listen to the love songs and the music
[1:48:05] and i remember the one day i was
[1:48:07] in a bathroom and they were playing i
[1:48:08] heard that song come over i kissed the
[1:48:09] girl and i liked it it was a girl said i
[1:48:11] kissed a girl and i liked it i thought
[1:48:13] yeah what filth no you'll never
[1:48:16] attain to what the prophet of god said
[1:48:18] when we're living in that poison in our
[1:48:19] mind
[1:48:20] but i tell you what we need to get in
[1:48:21] with the holy ghost because there's
[1:48:22] something about poison
[1:48:23] if you take poison if you ingest enough
[1:48:26] good things
[1:48:27] are you listening to me it pushes all
[1:48:29] the bad things out
[1:48:31] and how paul say let the mind that was
[1:48:33] in christ let it be inside of you
[1:48:34] say brother daniel i've gone down that
[1:48:36] road the devil's got me trapped and i
[1:48:37] went over that's okay
[1:48:39] now let the mind that was in christ let
[1:48:40] it be in you say lord i want your mind
[1:48:42] i want true holiness i want
[1:48:44] righteousness blessed be the name of the
[1:48:46] lord
[1:48:48] amen brother ram got in a trap with his
[1:48:50] mother-in-law that's a good trap family
[1:48:51] trap
[1:48:53] remember he went up to mishawaka and he
[1:48:54] heard him and they had him preach and he
[1:48:56] went back got all these invitations
[1:48:57] here's malachi 4 and the pentecostals
[1:48:59] goes back to his mother and you know
[1:49:01] mother-in-law says look billy
[1:49:02] i'm just paraphrasing so he said look
[1:49:04] billy you need to get back down there
[1:49:06] and get some sense and pastor your
[1:49:09] church so you can get enough money to
[1:49:10] get a parsonage for my daughter
[1:49:12] brother graham said i listened to her
[1:49:13] and i went back down and went back to
[1:49:15] work and it was god calling him
[1:49:16] to start his ministry because and you
[1:49:19] know in 1933 the angel of the lord
[1:49:20] appeared on the river and said it's john
[1:49:22] the baptist for when my first coming you
[1:49:23] will forerun my
[1:49:24] second coming so now here's this great
[1:49:26] gateway and now his mother-in-law says
[1:49:28] don't do it
[1:49:29] and she traps him how many of us are
[1:49:32] trapped a family member
[1:49:34] put you in the trap why it was her
[1:49:35] mother-in-law's expectations
[1:49:37] oh i wanted this my point grandma i
[1:49:39] don't want to just i tell you what
[1:49:41] there's one we gotta
[1:49:42] please and that's the lord jesus christ
[1:49:44] i have my office at work and i got a
[1:49:46] little office beside it and i got a
[1:49:47] little thing that's on the wall it says
[1:49:48] there's one man that i got to please and
[1:49:50] that's jesus christ
[1:49:52] i want to hear those words enter thou
[1:49:55] into the joy faith you've been faithful
[1:49:57] over a few things i'll make you a ruler
[1:49:59] over many things
[1:50:01] i want to hear that from my savior i was
[1:50:04] just thinking today
[1:50:05] we were listening a little story on the
[1:50:07] tape of brother branham
[1:50:09] brother random when he went to
[1:50:10] cincinnati and he went to the zoo
[1:50:12] and he saw that eagle in there he loved
[1:50:14] eagles and he saw that eagle who was
[1:50:16] trapped in that cage a man-made cage and
[1:50:19] somebody had trapped this eagle and they
[1:50:20] put him in there
[1:50:21] brother rams looking at it and it's
[1:50:22] running and hitting the bars and
[1:50:25] falling down and he said all the
[1:50:27] feathers were gone off its head and he
[1:50:28] was
[1:50:29] rolling its big eyes up to the heavens
[1:50:31] like this looking around
[1:50:32] i was listening to it tonight brother
[1:50:33] and i said if i had a hacksaw i'd hack
[1:50:35] sawed all the bars off that thing and
[1:50:37] let the eagle out
[1:50:38] and he said there was that eagle that
[1:50:40] once flew in the heavens and now he's in
[1:50:41] this trap and he's beating his brains
[1:50:43] out trying to get back to where he was
[1:50:47] brother ham said the holy spirit began
[1:50:48] to deal with him and said well that was
[1:50:50] a very pitiful sight but what about sons
[1:50:52] and daughters of god that were made in
[1:50:54] the image of god once
[1:50:56] roamed the heavenly and come to church
[1:50:58] and raised their wings and loved god and
[1:50:59] the tears run down their cheeks and they
[1:51:01] were
[1:51:01] free to love god and the devil somewhere
[1:51:04] trapped them in a trap and got them
[1:51:06] bound somewhere maybe some people are
[1:51:07] bound by
[1:51:08] cigarettes or drugs or alcohol see a man
[1:51:11] made in the image of god to
[1:51:12] to be a son of god to have dominion god
[1:51:15] created man that have dominion over the
[1:51:16] earth and now they're bound by some
[1:51:17] little habit they can't even
[1:51:19] couldn't get away from it it's like
[1:51:20] sometimes even we get addicted to
[1:51:22] different things like
[1:51:23] i'm not addicted i just can't live
[1:51:25] without it you're addicted to it
[1:51:28] if it takes you away from your real
[1:51:30] purpose then get away from that thing
[1:51:31] move away from that say lord let me be a
[1:51:32] real christian and love
[1:51:34] you and serve you with all of my heart
[1:51:35] and see people that and you know them
[1:51:37] and i know them and
[1:51:38] here they are their life once had a
[1:51:39] testimony for the lord sing a special
[1:51:41] and
[1:51:41] had a testimony like our sisters up
[1:51:43] there and testify tonight about the
[1:51:45] grace of god and now they're
[1:51:46] wallowing out somewhere in the world
[1:51:48] it's a shame isn't it
[1:51:49] that god never wanted us to be like that
[1:51:51] he wanted us to be free
[1:51:53] i was thinking about the story of johnny
[1:51:55] crow and that little crow and they had
[1:51:58] somewhere they caught this crow and they
[1:52:00] put a little tether on his leg
[1:52:02] so every year the crows would fly south
[1:52:05] in the winter they'd fly and he said
[1:52:06] johnny crow come with us
[1:52:08] come with us he tried to fly and his leg
[1:52:10] was tethered to the thing he said i
[1:52:12] can't come i'm tethered up tell her
[1:52:14] every year same thing johnny crow come
[1:52:15] on we're flying south no i can't go
[1:52:18] i'm tethered to this one day there was a
[1:52:20] farmer came by
[1:52:21] and he clipped the tether off of him
[1:52:24] johnny crow just sit there for a little
[1:52:25] bit
[1:52:26] all the crows go johnny crow come on
[1:52:28] come on let's fly south let's fly so i
[1:52:30] said no no i'm tethered i'm tyler
[1:52:33] he was loose but in his mind he was
[1:52:34] always bound he couldn't get past his
[1:52:36] bondage
[1:52:38] and i tell you that's what's happened to
[1:52:39] a lot of people i was thinking about the
[1:52:41] verses john 8 36
[1:52:42] that he that the son sets free he's free
[1:52:46] when christ cried it is finished on
[1:52:47] calvary he paid for every one of the
[1:52:49] freedoms of your soul
[1:52:51] you could no longer didn't have to be
[1:52:53] bound by the the devil and his
[1:52:55] his hold on your life you don't i
[1:52:57] remember as a young boy going to bed and
[1:52:58] just laying
[1:52:59] and filling my pillow up with tears
[1:53:00] because i was so lost and i wanted to be
[1:53:02] saved there was something inside of me
[1:53:04] brother aaron i wanted to love god i
[1:53:06] wanted to serve god but the devil had me
[1:53:07] in a trap
[1:53:09] i think brother bam said that i don't
[1:53:10] know what messages it is he said when i
[1:53:11] was a 12 year old boy he said the reason
[1:53:13] i didn't receive the holy spirit there
[1:53:15] was a little devil that hung over me a
[1:53:16] little dark cloud that said don't do it
[1:53:18] now
[1:53:18] just wait a little longer he talks about
[1:53:21] the preaching of the gospel it casts
[1:53:22] that little dark cloud away from you
[1:53:24] maybe you've never been baptized in
[1:53:26] jesus name the devil said i'll just wave
[1:53:28] that's a bunch of hocus pocus but
[1:53:29] tonight when a preaching gospel
[1:53:31] it casts that little cloud away from you
[1:53:33] go back and read
[1:53:34] matthew or mark chapter 16 the bible
[1:53:36] says he that believeth and is baptized
[1:53:38] will be saved and he that believeth not
[1:53:41] will be damned and then you sit there
[1:53:42] and we stop being kids and we start
[1:53:43] growing up and being adults and realize
[1:53:45] you know if i'm baptized the bible says
[1:53:47] and i believe i'm going to be saved
[1:53:49] but if i don't he that believeth not is
[1:53:52] damned and there's only one place for
[1:53:53] the damned and that's to go to the
[1:53:54] devil's hell
[1:53:55] what's john 3 16 for god so loved the
[1:53:57] world that he gave his only begotten son
[1:53:59] that whosoever believeth on him would
[1:54:00] not perish but had
[1:54:02] everlasting life for the son of man came
[1:54:04] not into the world to condemn the world
[1:54:06] but that the world through him
[1:54:08] might be saved and this is the
[1:54:10] condemnation good verses isn't it
[1:54:11] brother john
[1:54:12] johnson amen this is the condemnation
[1:54:15] that men love darkness rather than light
[1:54:17] because their
[1:54:17] deeds are evil they're evil in their
[1:54:20] heart
[1:54:21] but i'm so thankful that he came to save
[1:54:24] i'm one i want to be saved how do you
[1:54:26] tell timothy he said you
[1:54:28] how'd he say you you'll know the
[1:54:29] scriptures which are able to
[1:54:31] bring salvation to you somewhere we've
[1:54:34] got to have the gospel of jesus christ
[1:54:35] in every sermon that we preach we've got
[1:54:37] to have the death
[1:54:38] burial and resurrection jesus walked
[1:54:40] that road to calvary and every one of us
[1:54:42] every young boy
[1:54:43] every adult we have to have that day on
[1:54:44] calvary we realize we're a sinner
[1:54:46] lord i don't want to be a sinner i got
[1:54:48] my sins lord jesus forgive me
[1:54:50] and christ comes and forgives us of our
[1:54:51] sin and not just a profession
[1:54:53] but a quickening of the holy spirit that
[1:54:55] gives you power to live a life above sin
[1:54:58] that's what's lacking around our message
[1:54:59] we've got too many people that are
[1:55:00] professing i was listening to brother
[1:55:02] branham because i listen to him in the
[1:55:03] morning when i'm getting ready
[1:55:04] getting getting up and before i fill my
[1:55:06] mind with all the garbage of the world
[1:55:07] and just stuff of the world in business
[1:55:09] fill your mind with the prophet he's
[1:55:10] speaking he said billy graham and oral
[1:55:12] roberts they come to our
[1:55:13] city specifically he's talking about
[1:55:16] billy graham he said he has his
[1:55:17] conversion he said only 10
[1:55:19] of them last only 10
[1:55:22] because it's just a confession he said
[1:55:24] every confession is a stone he said but
[1:55:26] it takes a real stone mason to cut that
[1:55:28] confession out and say
[1:55:29] this is what you should be confessing
[1:55:31] jesus christ and the power of the holy
[1:55:33] spirit of the word to make you
[1:55:34] live and overcoming life that's what's
[1:55:36] lacking around our message it's the holy
[1:55:38] spirit
[1:55:38] to fill our lives that somebody have a
[1:55:40] real experience with god
[1:55:42] some of you know what i'm talking about
[1:55:43] say i've had an experience with god i
[1:55:44] know it's held me through the years
[1:55:46] obviously
[1:55:46] i don't know i'm just pushed from this
[1:55:48] way and i go from this trap to this trap
[1:55:50] amen how do what jesus said when he the
[1:55:52] holy spirit has come he'll lead
[1:55:53] and guide you into all truth say lord i
[1:55:56] don't want to get caught in traps
[1:55:58] i tell you we sit with young people we
[1:56:00] sat with him last night man beautiful
[1:56:01] young people eyes crystal clear and
[1:56:04] talents and abilities and i know sister
[1:56:06] heather's worked with young people
[1:56:08] through the years and
[1:56:09] and helping and sister elizabeth help
[1:56:11] him at the sunday school and
[1:56:12] and you know you sit with them and and
[1:56:14] then the devil comes and he throws these
[1:56:16] traps and pretty soon
[1:56:17] the devil throws his trap and makes
[1:56:19] someone less than the intended
[1:56:21] position that god has for that young
[1:56:23] lady
[1:56:24] god help us john 8 32 you shall know the
[1:56:28] truth and the truth shall make you free
[1:56:30] and one of my favorite verses john 10 10
[1:56:32] you know we always rate things by
[1:56:34] 10 i was about a 2 but you remember this
[1:56:37] when jesus rates it like 10
[1:56:38] 10 john 10 10 that's a 10 and that's a
[1:56:41] 10.
[1:56:42] and he said the thief cometh not but for
[1:56:44] to steal
[1:56:46] kill and destroy and jesus said but i
[1:56:49] have come that you might have life
[1:56:52] and that you might have it more
[1:56:54] abundantly and that's what i believe
[1:56:56] john 10 10 it's abundant life it's just
[1:56:58] not
[1:56:58] i got eternal life and it's a terrible
[1:57:01] thing i ever wish i'd never even dropped
[1:57:02] in that church
[1:57:03] it's terrible but i get to go to that's
[1:57:05] not what jesus wanted you to have
[1:57:07] he said i come that you might have life
[1:57:09] and you can have it more abundantly it's
[1:57:11] better than any life the world can give
[1:57:13] you out there
[1:57:15] blessed be the name of the lord it's
[1:57:16] life and you know i was thinking about
[1:57:19] that with those traps
[1:57:21] if you're in a trap and you want to be
[1:57:22] free the first thing you got to have a
[1:57:24] desire and want to be free
[1:57:28] brother talks about that people having
[1:57:29] cigarettes and smoking cigarettes
[1:57:31] and say they oh they want to be but they
[1:57:32] don't have a they really don't want to
[1:57:34] be free i find that without
[1:57:35] like a pity spirit sometimes you see
[1:57:38] people they're going through deep things
[1:57:39] in their life and they really
[1:57:40] but they really don't want to be
[1:57:41] delivered because their pity spirit is
[1:57:43] what gives them value
[1:57:45] and they can tell that story and then
[1:57:47] everybody rather than just saying hey
[1:57:49] god deliver me and look at the power of
[1:57:50] god and the testimony that i have where
[1:57:52] he's brought me from the pithy
[1:57:53] and hallelujah look at me today loving
[1:57:55] god and laying my hands on the sick and
[1:57:57] recovering and
[1:57:58] ministering to anybody but they want to
[1:58:00] stay back and in 20 years you meet them
[1:58:02] later and they're back at that i say god
[1:58:03] let us move out of that trap and let god
[1:58:05] fill us with the holy ghost and let's
[1:58:06] grow
[1:58:07] i want to grow i want to move on with
[1:58:09] god from wherever i am today
[1:58:11] as i said the other day i'm not the man
[1:58:12] i used to be i made some mistakes
[1:58:14] yesterday but i'm not that man
[1:58:17] can you say amen to that or maybe you
[1:58:19] need to say lord forgive me i'm not that
[1:58:21] woman that i used to be i made mistakes
[1:58:22] back there
[1:58:24] blessed be the name of the lord amen a
[1:58:27] few musicians will come
[1:58:29] jesus had the solution he said watch and
[1:58:32] pray
[1:58:33] that you may be counted worthy to escape
[1:58:35] all these things
[1:58:38] i say all these traps are trying to get
[1:58:40] you off that off that path to the
[1:58:42] rapture we were talking about the other
[1:58:43] day
[1:58:45] and i want to go back to our original
[1:58:46] text because in psalms 91 it says
[1:58:49] and he shall deliver thee from the snare
[1:58:51] of the fowler
[1:58:53] oh it's such an anchor brother aaron and
[1:58:56] i know i've been in traps in my life but
[1:58:58] i have a promise psalms 91 that he said
[1:59:00] he would deliver me from the snare of
[1:59:03] the hunter
[1:59:04] there's something about a son and
[1:59:06] daughter of god and say lord i'm going
[1:59:07] through this life i'm doing the best
[1:59:09] that i can if the devil traps me in a
[1:59:10] snare
[1:59:11] god you'll send that screaming preacher
[1:59:13] from indiana you'll go up there and
[1:59:15] scream and holler and scream
[1:59:17] and i'll realize yes i'm in a trap but
[1:59:19] the bible says there's a promise that he
[1:59:21] would deliver us from the hunter
[1:59:23] say brother daniel i haven't moved in a
[1:59:25] long time but i want to move tonight
[1:59:27] maybe it's just something in your mind
[1:59:29] you say you know i'm just i love
[1:59:31] comedy said and lord all those
[1:59:35] little knots up in those people's minds
[1:59:37] i pray that you would just
[1:59:38] unravel them sometimes we get those
[1:59:42] little
[1:59:42] knots in our mind i do and you start
[1:59:46] and you get well that maybe somebody
[1:59:48] tells you about somebody and you just
[1:59:49] like
[1:59:49] it destroys their character you know you
[1:59:51] can murder somebody without shooting
[1:59:53] them with the gun
[1:59:54] brother ram said you just destroy their
[1:59:55] character well hey yeah i know them but
[1:59:58] i
[1:59:58] i don't you know back they they did this
[2:00:00] way back and you destroy
[2:00:02] you murdered that person's character
[2:00:03] they can't help you
[2:00:05] and we get these little knots in our
[2:00:07] mind say lord just unravel that knot
[2:00:09] just pull it pull it right out lord and
[2:00:11] let it be straight
[2:00:14] we need that in our minds i remember one
[2:00:17] time i was praying
[2:00:18] just really going through a lot of
[2:00:19] ministries and this brother and this
[2:00:20] brother and his brother
[2:00:22] i was kneeling down and praying
[2:00:25] and i thought about peter when peter he
[2:00:27] said to jesus about johnny said
[2:00:29] what about this man and i was asking the
[2:00:33] lord lord what about this ministry what
[2:00:34] about this man i don't understand this
[2:00:36] lord
[2:00:37] and the lord spoke to me the same thing
[2:00:39] he spoke to peter
[2:00:40] he said what is that to you
[2:00:43] follow thou me maybe that's the only
[2:00:47] thing you get out of this message
[2:00:48] tonight the holy spirit would speak to
[2:00:49] you like you spoken to
[2:00:51] peter said what is that to you follow
[2:00:53] thou me
[2:00:55] i tell you what i was a changed man i
[2:00:56] got up from that chair
[2:00:58] i said lord i can't explain that i can't
[2:01:00] explain that but what is that to me i'm
[2:01:02] gonna
