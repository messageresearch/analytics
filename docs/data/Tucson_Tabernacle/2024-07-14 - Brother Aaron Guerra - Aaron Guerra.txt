the family of God but Lord what we really desire is for you to come and minister to us today Lord and to fill that pool that draw Close to You Lord Jesus we commit the rest of this service Lord to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated here thank you before I forget brother Ed asked me to make this announcement they're going to start working on the putting in the flooring here in the fellowship hall so this Wednesday please come around they're going to keep this locked because they will be working on the floor it may be ready by Sunday if the do is unlocked on Sunday then you can come in that way we're not tracking any of the what they're working on and every every week in the past and we have to do that something else is getting accomplished and I know sometimes it seems like a long time and if it seems like it's a long time for you can imagine how long has been for brother Ed dealing with this but thank you brother Ed for for doing that all of you that have helped appreciate that and uh so it's good to be in the house of the Lord and uh where did Brother Daniel go he walked out but I believe some of the folks here said they're brother Daniel's friends so welcome good to have you with us so appreciate that now we know that brother Daniel has friends how do you like that it's good young man but when brother our pastor brother Dan had it asked me to cover tonight as he was going out going to be out of town for a few days I had um I was listening to a brother Minister I don't know the brother personally he was online but he shared some things that really spoke to my heart and sometimes they're practical things to help us daily um sometimes God is good to us and he he reveals himself to us he He makes himself known but sometimes we just need some daily help how do how do work through something how to deal with something um you know as as uh as parents usually the first child gets a lot of attention um you maybe they're the the last ones to learn to walk because you hold them all the time in our case there were six daughters and basically the last ones got taught by their older sisters you know it's just how it how it goes and by the grace of God last week and my wife and myself celebrated our 45th anniversary and she said you're a keeper which I'm glad but then I asked her why and she said because I don't want to train another one but you know life is constant training life is constant learning um as time go on somebody May specialize in something that you have some difficulty with but there's things that you do that you can help others with with it's part of the family it's part of the body just like looking at your body you don't see through your ears but you see through your eyes but your eyes can't hear your ears do that so it's all part of the body and as as I was listening to this brother Minister I it just really spoke to me I shared it some with brother Daniel this past week and he said be sure you give the testimony along with this so just going to share some things with you but we know that God said and and we'll take that first scripture and I believe and I believe you believe that God's word is is true and it accomplishes what he says it'll do he said heavens and earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away and and God's word are faithful it's true and and it doesn't it's not something is going to be there tomorrow it's still here you know and then in Proverbs 2511 a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver and if you just look at that sometimes you go what do they really mean and I I just like this more modern translation a word of counsel or proof rightly spoken rightly spoken is especially beautiful as the fruit becomes still more beautiful in silver baskets and I could see that picture of the basket holding the fruit and the basket itself is beautiful you're not eating the basket you want the fruit but the presentation if if that same fruit was laying on the floor you probably wouldn't want it to eat it at least pick it up and wash it but it's how sometimes it's presented so it it was the thought but I don't know how how each Minister gets their their thoughts and all but it seems like when you when I catch a thought everything just seems to come this ties to that this T and this came up somebody posted this and I'll read it it says in ancient Greece Socrates had a great reputation for wisdom one day someone came to find the great philosopher and said to him do you know what I heard about your friend and Socrates said a moment please he says before you tell me I would like to test it with these three seves the three seves he said yes before you speak about others it's important to take time to filter what you mean I call it the test test of three sees the first test of seeve is truth have you checked if what you're going to tell me is true well sometimes that stops the whole conversation right then and we're all guilty of that and he says no I just heard it well very well so you don't know if it's true let's move on to the second and that's of kindness is what you want to tell me about my friend something good good he says oh no on the contrary so question Socrates you want to tell me something negative about him and you're not even sure it's true perhaps you can still pass the test of the third seeve he say and it's called utility is it useful for me to know what you're going to tell me about this friend no not really he said therefore concluded Socrates what you're going to tell me is neither true nor good nor useful why then did you want to tell me this that's pretty plain English there gossip is a Bad Thing initially it may seem enjoyable and fun but ultimately it fills our hearts with bitterness and poisons and you would think a Christian doesn't suffer with those things but we all do there are things that that hurt us hurt us all even the word may be a good word but the tone and the attitude it's done with has a different effect in the in the message and and this was right out of one we just heard 57 Hebrews chapter 6 number two and and I was on this thought when we got here and I believe they have the quote there but I'll read it to you one time I was walking out the door there and there was a lady come by and she said brother brandom oh how I enjoyed that message and I said Thank you made me feel good somebody else came by and said brother brandom I enjoyed that message and I said Thank you there was a little preacher there from up here in the north part of the country in in the state he said bless God I don't want people to brag on me like that and I said I do and then he said there's one difference between me and you I'm honest about it he said that's right we all like to hear nice words said about us and I think it's it's nice to say nice words about it if you want somebody to say nice words about you say some nice words about somebody else that's a way we do that then you'll always say nicest things when you can about everybody and that makes the wheel roll better and when you say something nice about somebody and it's true you don't have to worry about it you don't have to take it back you know it's like a pebble being thrown in a lake and it's in a pebble and that thing it just travels and travels and travels and travels hit the shore travels back and usually by the time it comes around the third or fourth time it don't sound nothing like what it started like and there you are trying to make so and and I I say this because I've done that by experience you learn that way you know in the message when love is projected I'm just going to take that last little part and and he says it it's that baby that that it's that part that her she wanted her son who who who was sick and he says I Dreamed a Dream she said I seen a man come walking down the street wearing a light tan suit and a tan hat and said the Lord said I'll send him and she said I've been standing here ever since daylight that's just the way and and brother bam says that's just the way I was dressed when love is projected with the right motive behind it div Divine Grace has to step in with the right motive love is love God is love I mean the scripture teaches that God is love okay there's no failure in that but what is the motive behind what you're doing and then uh from the message to the loudest in church he says I am kindly thinking this that many times a church in its looseness gets to doing things and thinking things and taking things just as they are when we ought to weigh what we do and say we ought to think it over before we speak it my old southern mommy used to tell me think twice and speak once it's a little thing sometimes that we leave undone that means so much to us we get in such a hurry to race over to the things in this neurotic age that we live in it would behoove us as a Church of God tonight to stop and wait a minute and see where we're at how many times have you stopped and looked and said oh had I taken one more step what trouble I would have gotten into you know it's it's it's it's part of life part of Being Human so if if I would title this message I would say your words the words you use to create an atmosphere because your words do have an effect uh you know you can say nice things about people and it doesn't make let me say this right you say nice things about people no matter how they accept them you're doing what you should be doing you can't control the way things are accepted by others but you have control about your your attitude on how you do that in Proverbs also chapter 18 verse 21 death and life are in the power of the tongue I think a lot of times we would just be quiet wouldn't we before before watching what we're saying we would just stop for a moment is this going to help somebody or is just because I want them to hear what I have to say you and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof the power of of the tongue it's if if you're giving life you're encouraging somebody you're uplifting somebody you're helping somebody that is that is something they can partake of and as I was looking through and and you know you type into your your search word search in Bible apps and how many times the word word is used or words God chose to use language to speak for us to be able to communicate with each other now we can also communicate with how we're acting uh sometimes somebody says something and they say it nicely but their face looks mean it looks you now my daughter my son your father loves you I really really love you they're not getting any love out of how I'm coming across you know but it can be the other way too sometimes you have to be straight and direct brother brandom uses this example if your child is out in the middle of say right out here on Stone my little nephew Liam going out in the middle of the stone and the cars are going up and down Liam please Liam don't don't don't play in the street come on Liam no you would probably yell and scream and run out there to get him and save his life that has its place and its part so what brought this on I was listening to a testimony or or a sermon of brother I don't know the brother it was um I like I said I God has answered questions for me I'm I'm seeking him and I feel to just to listen to and and he'll answer something I I was questioning once uh the call of a Ministry some people who will travel all over the world spend their life out there but I don't have that call and I wondered I said Lord am I just lazy am I just not wanting to and I I it was troubling me for a time my my father did many many trips into Mexico Central and South America brother green 138 different countries but that was a calling in their lives and they went they wanted to and and I was listening to a brother and he's speaking and suddenly he stops and he says now you know the call in your life is not the same for everybody call that catches my attention because I was just asking the Lord about that and he says the call in your life to some they travel everywhere they they they minister they go out they do this they do that others God has you just stay home it didn't mean at your house but staying where you were to help those around you and then he went onto his subject and and that was brother Donnie Reagan we were in in a in a service this when I was at the service brother Baker had the the meetings down here and those of you have ever seen brother Donnie Reagan live or watch him brother gets excited and he's all over the place and just it's amazing you wonder how how can they could still walk after it's done that'd be done wore out and I was sitting there and I'm watching I'm sitting up higher up looking down and I just started thinking to myself that's how I need to minister that's how I need to be and I'm just thinking thinking I've got to you know and he comes across at the end and it looks like he's looking straight up at me and he goes now he says you got to be who like who you are you can't be like me you've got to make be exactly and then he stops and keeps right on going God will answer we'll talk to you we'll show you if you're willing to listen willing to hear but if we put a box around God and say this is how you have to speak to me this is the only way I'll listen by by his grace he'll break that box and then he'll talk to you and I I've always said break this box if it needs to be broken so this brother as I was listening listening to him and it just something pulled me to it I listened to it and um let me I wrote some notes down here so I could get it right and and again creating an atmosphere with your words the expectation or the faith of the hearer so that makes each one of you responsible today you're as much part of this service as I am you're going to get as much as you're willing to receive and pull sometimes we sit there and say minister to me to Ministry but we're not we're not drawing we're not pulling it's just the expectation or the faith of the hearer brings the anointing or the vision division to the ministering servant and the servant what he does is just yield himself could even be a sister talking to a sister a brother talking to a brother a wife talking to a husband if one will yield to I need some help and let God speak so again you put God in a box and you say this is God this is how it works this is how it has to be and God will break that box if you're one of his because he wants to get to you and talk to you and and make it personal with you he knows your name he knows who you are I know that I've shared that experience I asked him one day in in in frustration I said God do you know my name do you know
