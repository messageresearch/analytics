[30:39] recommend that you give it away to the
[30:40] Lord when I think about that
[30:43] song think about someone that really
[30:46] did um sister Lily Blessed Assurance I
[30:51] think
[30:51] about the one who wrote that song that
[30:54] we sang earlier Blessed
[30:56] Assurance is there's a lady named Fanny
[30:58] Crosby she lived the turn of the century
[31:02] early
[31:03] 1900s and Daniel was telling me the
[31:06] story of her life yesterday I knew the
[31:09] story of her life but he was telling me
[31:11] the story of that song but would you
[31:14] mind I think you could do it better than
[31:15] me
[31:16] absolutely um so if you don't know whose
[31:19] sister Fanny Crosby was she was a
[31:22] songwriter she wrote a bunch of hymns
[31:24] but her story was whenever she was a kid
[31:27] she had like an infection with her eye
[31:30] and she had a doctor who put this iav on
[31:32] it that actually burnt her eyes and
[31:34] caused her to be blind for the rest of
[31:36] her life and so knowing that story I was
[31:38] I was reading through the songs and I
[31:40] was reading through that third verse um
[31:42] can we put the third verse on for
[31:45] Blessed Assurance
[31:46] please and I was reading through this
[31:48] verse and I just looked at it and it
[31:50] says perfect submission all is at rest I
[31:54] am My Savior am happy and blessed and I
[31:57] looked at that I'm like man this woman
[31:59] was blind but she said I in my savior am
[32:04] happy and blessed she was happy being
[32:06] blind because she knew who the one was
[32:10] who had her life in his hands and it was
[32:13] just amazing it just it just blessed me
[32:14] and I just I loved that story amen
[32:16] perfect submission
[32:18] amen Perfect
[32:23] [Music]
[32:25] submiss all is at
[32:32] rest I in my
[32:38] sa and happy and
[32:44] blessed I'm watching and
[32:51] waiting
[32:53] looking above
[32:58] I'm filled with his
[33:03] [Music]

[37:46] join us we hope that you feel welcome
[37:49] when you come I
[37:52] um I I've been traveling this past week
[37:55] and I was we're at a uh kind of a
[37:57] conference type of thing where there was
[38:00] um the um kind of the there there was a
[38:03] lot of influential people in this area
[38:06] in the scientific Community especially
[38:07] in the earth science community and I was
[38:11] um during during the
[38:13] day there um there there would have some
[38:16] vendors out and there there's a lot of
[38:18] us there so the vendors were allowed to
[38:20] set up in the big Auditorium and they
[38:23] would sell some of the they would be
[38:25] pitching some of their top scien ific um
[38:28] instruments that they had you know The
[38:30] Cutting Edge
[38:31] stuff and you know we'd go through and
[38:33] look at it and some of the just the
[38:35] coolest things that you can imagine that
[38:37] that they're doing with with research
[38:39] and and data collection and there was
[38:42] one guy there and this guy he had his
[38:45] little booth set up and I felt bad for
[38:48] him because he had all of these old
[38:53] instruments and these instruments were
[38:56] the same things that that we've been
[38:58] using for the past hundred years and
[39:01] just in the past just 10 years or so
[39:04] technology has increased so much that it
[39:07] really made these other things Obsolete
[39:10] and he was there and he was trying to
[39:11] trying to pitch his his stuff that we
[39:13] had we were coming by like oh yeah I
[39:15] remember those things that that's what
[39:17] we used to use in this and this and he
[39:19] was trying to sell these things as
[39:21] something well you still need it this is
[39:23] still really really important but what
[39:27] he didn't understand is the whole point
[39:31] of of technology and the whole point of
[39:34] moving forward was there is a better way
[39:37] to do these things now and it's not that
[39:42] our equations are different it's not
[39:45] that physics has changed it's not that
[39:47] God's God's laws have changed of what we
[39:50] do but now technology has moved up and
[39:55] moved forward to where it takes the old
[39:57] way of doing things and makes those
[40:00] things
[40:01] obsolete so the the what had happened
[40:05] was this man he he kind of leveled with
[40:07] me and he says well here's what happened
[40:08] is I bought this company and all this
[40:11] inventory and he says I thought I could
[40:13] really make some good money on it and I
[40:16] was like bro this is some out ofate
[40:20] stuff we we used to use this stuff and
[40:22] it still works it's still good but there
[40:26] is a better better way now to do it and
[40:31] it made me think of this book of Hebrews
[40:33] that we've been studying for our
[40:34] visitors we've been going through every
[40:37] chapter in the book of Hebrews now we're
[40:39] on
[40:40] chapter8 and each chapter has has
[40:43] specific things that are really for all
[40:45] of us but the general theme of the book
[40:49] of Hebrews it was it was written by an
[40:52] unknown author most people think and I I
[40:54] agree that it was the Apostle Paul that
[40:57] wrote it and it has a has a theme of
[41:02] of the audience you have to understand
[41:04] the audience is are Jews that had given
[41:08] their hearts and their lives over to the
[41:10] Lord Jesus and they had accepted Jesus
[41:13] as the
[41:14] Messiah and they began to slip back into
[41:20] their old way of thinking and this book
[41:23] of Hebrews is meant to address those
[41:25] people and say hey don't slip
[41:27] back these this this Messiah that you've
[41:31] accepted he is far greater than you
[41:32] could ever imagine and what and place by
[41:37] place by place and aspect and aspect and
[41:39] and parts of this man's life and the
[41:41] book of Hebrews goes to all these
[41:43] different parts of Jesus's life and how
[41:46] great they are and his main theme is
[41:49] this is better than the way that you
[41:51] used to
[41:53] think this is better than the way that
[41:55] you used to do it and as I was talking
[41:57] with this guy in in this in this show in
[42:01] this conference he didn't get the
[42:04] point that these things are not as
[42:08] useful anymore they're still right we
[42:11] still f as I said physics hasn't changed
[42:14] our equations H haven't changed God's
[42:17] laws don't
[42:18] change but this book of Hebrews is
[42:21] saying but there is a more excellent way
[42:24] than what what you have learned before
[42:27] before this man
[42:28] Jesus it reminds me of 1 Corinthians
[42:32] chapter 12 it says now you are the body
[42:36] of Christ and members in individually
[42:38] and God has appointed these in the
[42:40] church first apostles second prophets
[42:42] third teachers after that Miracles then
[42:45] Gifts of healing helps administrations
[42:47] varieties of tongues are all
[42:50] Apostles are all prophets are all
[42:53] teachers are all workers of Miracles
[42:55] he's he's putting the whole body of
[42:57] Christ together do all have gifts of
[43:00] healings do all speak with tongues do
[43:01] all interpret but earnestly desire the
[43:03] best gifts and then he says this but yet
[43:06] I will show you a more excellent way I'm
[43:10] going to show you a better way than all
[43:12] of these gifts those things are good
[43:15] pastors are good Apostles are good
[43:17] prophets are good these things are all
[43:19] working toward the with the body of
[43:22] Christ but there is something greater
[43:24] than all of these things and he he just
[43:27] goes right into though I speak with
[43:29] tongue of men and angels and have not
[43:31] love I've become a sounding brass and a
[43:34] tinkling symbol and though I have the
[43:36] gift of Prophecy and I understand all
[43:37] the Mysteries and knowledge through all
[43:39] Faith so that I could remove mountains
[43:41] but I have not love I have
[43:43] nothing and though I bestow all my goods
[43:46] to feed the poor and though I give my
[43:48] body to be burned but have not love it
[43:50] profits me nothing love suffers
[43:53] long love is kind amen
[43:58] love doesn't Envy love does not parade
[44:00] itself it's not puffed up it doesn't
[44:01] behave
[44:03] rudely it doesn't seek its own it's not
[44:07] provoked it doesn't think evil doesn't
[44:10] rejoice in iniquity but it rejoices in
[44:12] the truth amen it Bears all things
[44:16] believes all things hopes all things and
[44:18] endures all things Love Never Fails but
[44:23] whether there are prophecies they will
[44:25] fail whether there are tongues they will
[44:27] cease whether there is knowledge it will
[44:29] vanish away for we know in part and we
[44:32] prophesy in part but then that which is
[44:34] when that which is perfect is come then
[44:37] that which is in part will be done away
[44:39] with and that
[44:42] Perfection author is talking about is
[44:44] love it's
[44:46] beautiful the Apostle John said these
[44:49] three words very simply he said God is
[44:51] love it is the most perfect way it
[44:54] doesn't do away with all Min
[44:57] ministrations it doesn't do away with a
[44:59] pastor I'm standing here pastoring a
[45:01] church ministering the
[45:03] gospel but I'm trying to point you to
[45:07] the infallible thing the perfect thing
[45:10] this is not the perfect thing but if I
[45:12] can point you to that which is perfect
[45:15] then that which is in part those things
[45:17] that are weak in our lives it'll be done
[45:19] away with my I was talking with my
[45:22] brother a couple days ago we always call
[45:25] each other um on he calls me just before
[45:29] service on Wednesday night Wednesday
[45:32] evening and it's it's the same day that
[45:34] he has his Bible study at the boxing gym
[45:37] and he had a young lady that came um
[45:40] that she's been coming and they had
[45:43] their Bible study there and there's 50
[45:45] or 60 of these Fighters around men and
[45:48] boys and girls men and women there their
[45:50] parents and and um Adam teaches them
[45:53] about the
[45:54] word and one one of the one of the young
[45:58] ladies she says I I would like to share
[46:01] something she said I got baptized
[46:05] today and Adam is like really well well
[46:08] tell us your
[46:09] story so what happened is this this
[46:12] young lady she had a rough
[46:14] life he could tell that there were
[46:17] probably drugs and and and and and
[46:21] probably worst things that were in her
[46:23] life but she had turned things around
[46:28] and she said what had happened was how
[46:31] all of this changed is I had a seizure
[46:34] she said I never had one before and I've
[46:37] never had one since she said I had a
[46:40] seizure they brought me to the Hospital
[46:43] Jeffersonville
[46:45] Indiana and she said there was a nice
[46:49] nurse there and she was so kind to me
[46:53] she treated me with such love her name
[46:56] was Stephanie
[46:57] not my Stephanie but Ace nurse in
[47:01] Jeffersonville named
[47:02] Stephanie um
[47:05] but she said this lady was so nice and
[47:08] she started talking about the scriptures
[47:13] with me she started talking about God
[47:16] and how much God loves me and she said I
[47:19] had never heard things like this and she
[47:23] started listening and and she started
[47:25] taking this in and you see that this
[47:28] seed that may have laid dormant for 20
[47:31] years started to Spring to life and she
[47:36] started she started reaching out to the
[47:39] Lord Jesus she started praying and from
[47:42] that moment her life started changing
[47:47] there was a point in that nurse's
[47:51] testimony that brought this young lady
[47:55] to the Lord
[47:57] and she was proud to give that testimony
[48:00] and and as my brother was telling me
[48:02] that I was thinking that we've gone
[48:04] through the book of Hebrews and it says
[48:06] in in there that the word of God is
[48:08] quick means it's
[48:09] alive and it's powerful and it's sharper
[48:13] than any two-edged sword it is if you
[48:16] present the word in the right way to
[48:18] someone it's not a dead word or a dead
[48:22] works it is
[48:24] powerful and it will change something
[48:27] someone it'll it'll completely change
[48:30] their lives and you can go from
[48:32] heartache and and sorrow and drug abuse
[48:35] and all of that all the way till
[48:39] joy happiness family and good things I
[48:45] was I got a call uh when I was in
[48:48] Ministry in
[48:49] Jeffersonville uh from from a lady and
[48:52] she had
[48:54] just her son was strung out on drugs she
[48:59] was getting evicted from her
[49:01] house she was standing on a street
[49:03] corner and just
[49:06] weeping and somebody walked up to
[49:09] her saw her weeping and said here gave
[49:14] her a business
[49:15] card call that number she looked at it
[49:18] was a little track she turned it over
[49:21] and she
[49:23] called um where we where I was
[49:27] receptionist sent it to
[49:29] me and she just started weeping on the
[49:32] phone and I started talking with her and
[49:35] we prayed together and and it it was
[49:38] just nice and and then she would call
[49:40] more often I sent her some some material
[49:43] some recorded sermons and she she just
[49:45] started getting better and getting
[49:47] happier and then she reconciled with her
[49:50] son and her son started doing better and
[49:53] her just her whole life she came down
[49:56] and she got
[49:58] baptized and I said sister I said you

[50:03] hours away so I started sending her to
[50:06] these different churches and and she
[50:09] would call me back I sent her remember I

[50:23] Thunders and I said um
[50:27] well it's just how they believe it's
[50:28] here's here's a uh you know kind of an
[50:31] explanation of it and she says well I
[50:32] would like to go to a different church
[50:33] do you have another place I said sure So
[50:36] I I sent her another church that I knew
[50:39] of that was a little bit further away
[50:41] and she comes back and she says she says
[50:43] brother Daniel she says um I you know
[50:46] I'm I'm trying to I guess I'm supposed
[50:48] to change the way I look and I'm I guess
[50:49] I'm supposed to change the way I dress
[50:51] she said but she says what what's the
[50:54] fivefold
[50:55] ministry and I said well sister it's
[50:59] it's this it's it's a Ministry she said
[51:00] well I'd like to do you have another
[51:02] place and I said yeah sure
[51:06] and and she called back and she said so
[51:11] so we're not supposed to have preachers
[51:14] anymore I was like sister
[51:18] Tammy I said that's not the point so now
[51:22] you got that's that's not the point with
[51:24] all of this and she told me and she was
[51:27] just weeping she says I just want
[51:29] somebody that
[51:32] cares and she said those sermons that
[51:34] you sent me she said the man on the
[51:36] other side of those sermons he cares
[51:39] about
[51:40] me she said I want to meet him and I
[51:42] said no he passed away like like 60
[51:45] years ago and and she says well she says
[51:48] I can tell he cares she she says I just
[51:50] I just need
[51:52] something
[51:54] and a year ago goes by and corresponding
[51:59] back and forth and and she gives me a
[52:03] testimony and she
[52:04] says I just want you to know that do you
[52:07] remember when you sent me those those
[52:09] recorded sermons I said yes she said do
[52:11] you remember which ones I said probably
[52:13] she said do you remember the testimony
[52:15] that the man gave about his life story
[52:19] and how he was he was um meeting a uh a
[52:23] young
[52:24] lady and she lit up a cigarette and he
[52:28] just hated smoking so much and he said
[52:31] he said um it just it just disgusted him
[52:35] and and she said I wanted to wait one
[52:36] year to tell you this she said but I've
[52:41] been trying to quit smoking she said
[52:43] I've been smoking since I was 14 years
[52:45] old and she said I've been trying to
[52:47] quit smoking for for re for like 20
[52:50] years now and I've never had anything
[52:52] that was successful and she said when I
[52:55] heard that
[52:57] story she said cigarettes from that
[53:00] point on disgusted me and she said I
[53:03] wanted to wait a year before I told you
[53:05] because I've tried before and she said I
[53:07] am today I have no desire at all to
[53:10] smoke cigarettes it
[53:15] was it was it was a testimony it was
[53:18] something Supernatural to show her that
[53:20] God cares for her it wasn't The
[53:23] Narrative of this church or The
[53:25] Narrative of that church Church there
[53:27] was a point in everything that that is
[53:31] in this Bible there is a point and that
[53:34] point is not to make converts to a
[53:36] certain way of thinking that point is to
[53:40] get people to
[53:42] Christ because he is great and this book
[53:46] of Hebrews as I look over the the the
[53:48] words here it's all about that there is
[53:52] a better
[53:53] way these these ways of of of how you
[53:57] dress and how you talk and and and what
[53:59] you say in the church and and all of
[54:01] that they're they're good but there is
[54:04] something better there's a point in all
[54:06] of it and that point is to get to Christ
[54:11] and we have to understand that point did
[54:14] you ever
[54:15] see um I'm going to show my age 1984 The
[54:19] Karate
[54:21] Kid there's a there's this old story way
[54:24] before most of you were born um but
[54:27] anyways so this kid he gets bullied and
[54:29] he goes and he has this great karate
[54:32] instructor this um this little Chinese
[54:34] man and and and he says I want to learn
[54:37] I want to learn how to how to fight you
[54:40] know so I don't get beat up anymore and
[54:42] I can't remember all of it I just
[54:44] Googled it last night or or youtubed it
[54:47] and and saw the little clip of what I'm
[54:48] about to say but he uh so what he did is

[55:27] like okay I got it he says now the whole
[55:29] fence and it was this huge long fence
[55:33] and he
[55:34] says um okay so then he gets done with a
[55:37] fence and he says now he says now and he
[55:40] has this all this decking he says now

[55:42] floor and he's like s the floor and he
[55:45] says yeah he says like this and like

[57:21] fence and he goes he said no no no no no
[57:25] like you're supposed to and he raises
[57:27] his hand like this and then the guru
[57:29] punches and he blocks and he punches low

[57:38] he's he's he's doing this and then the
[57:40] gurus kicks and he blocks his kick with
[57:42] this so he's learning all of this stuff
[57:45] and he didn't understand until the the
[57:48] guru says here Mr Miagi was his name
[57:51] this is how you do it this is why I'm
[57:53] doing this so he learns how to fight but
[57:56] he didn't understand what it was all
[57:59] about and that's like many times the Old
[58:03] Testament or many times the
[58:06] Bible is we're learning these things but
[58:09] we need to be able to apply them to our
[58:14] lives and the point of all the rituals
[58:18] and all the formality surely people
[58:21] asked in the Old Testament what is the
[58:24] point in all of this why do we have to
[58:27] do all this like like the young man in
[58:28] the movie did why why in the world do we
[58:30] have do I have to sand the floor and
[58:32] paint the fence and do all this well
[58:34] there was a purpose in all of it and
[58:36] that purpose was God's
[58:41] will says in the beginning of Hebrews it
[58:44] says God who at Sund drry times and
[58:46] diverse manners God who in old times and
[58:48] in various ways spoke in times passed by
[58:51] the fathers hath in these last days
[58:53] spoken by his son whom heed heir of all
[58:56] things and through him also he made the
[58:58] world who being in the brightness of his
[59:00] glory and the express image of his
[59:02] person and upholding All Things by the
[59:04] word of his power when he had by himself
[59:06] purged our sins sat down at the right
[59:08] hand of the majesty and eye having
[59:11] become so much better than the angels He
[59:15] has by inheritance obtained a more
[59:17] excellent Name than
[59:19] they he's saying you've learned this
[59:23] this Jesus is greater he's different
[59:27] than the
[59:28] prophets and there was always a constant
[59:31] warning as we've gone through the book
[59:32] of Hebrews that there therefore in in
[59:35] chapter two therefore we must give the
[59:37] more Earnest heed to those things which
[59:39] we have learned lest at any time we let
[59:41] them slip and we drift
[59:44] away for if the word spoken through
[59:47] Angels was steadfast and every
[59:48] transgression and Disobedience received
[59:50] a
[59:51] reward not a good reward a punishment
[59:56] how shall we escape if we neglect so
[1:00:00] great a
[1:00:02] Salvation which first was spoken by the
[1:00:07] Lord and was confirmed unto us by them
[1:00:09] that heard them heard him so he's
[1:00:11] warning Us in this book that these
[1:00:14] Stakes are very high and and God gets
[1:00:17] the attention with the people he gets
[1:00:19] the attention through signs and wonders
[1:00:21] and miracles but there is a point to the
[1:00:24] Miracles there is a point to the
[1:00:26] healings there's a point to the science
[1:00:27] because brothers and sisters everybody
[1:00:30] who has lived with the exception of two
[1:00:34] has died since Adam until
[1:00:38] now so if we are healed we're going to
[1:00:40] get sick again but there is a purpose of
[1:00:44] God showing Miracles there is a point to
[1:00:46] it and it's not the short
[1:00:50] fix it's a long term so long it's
[1:00:53] Eternal that God is showing it
[1:00:57] and then he talks about the high priest
[1:00:59] and he he sets this high priest in order
[1:01:01] it's important to the author that he
[1:01:03] that we know what this high priest is
[1:01:05] because he he says that he says
[1:01:07] therefore holy Brethren partakers of the
[1:01:09] Heavenly calling consider the Apostle
[1:01:11] and high priest of our
[1:01:13] confession Christ Jesus he is saying
[1:01:17] right here now this Jesus Christ not
[1:01:19] only his he God which he said at the
[1:01:22] beginning but he's also a high priest
[1:01:25] and I know we've gone through all this
[1:01:27] I'm I'm reviewing it but it's very very
[1:01:30] important because the author keeps
[1:01:31] reiterating it chapter after chapter he
[1:01:34] keeps talking about the high priest and
[1:01:36] and he says that he this high priest was
[1:01:38] the one with Aaron who went into this
[1:01:42] Tabernacle in the wilderness remember
[1:01:43] Moses brought the people out of Egypt
[1:01:45] they go across the Red Sea the the the
[1:01:47] waters part they they start wandering in
[1:01:50] the wilderness they kept failing and
[1:01:51] failing and failing but they built this
[1:01:54] Tabernacle in the wilderness and in that
[1:01:56] Tabernacle was this little area in the
[1:01:59] back where the Ark of the Covenant sat
[1:02:02] The Mercy Seat was there and this is
[1:02:04] where the high priest went in once a
[1:02:06] year to make sacrifices for the people
[1:02:09] the and the glory of the Lord came down
[1:02:11] and he said that that this Jesus is like
[1:02:14] that high priest he is an intercessor
[1:02:17] he's the one that makes a sacrifice for
[1:02:19] us and he he goes on and on saying that
[1:02:21] but this one didn't die like the high
[1:02:24] priest died Aaron died Aaron's son died
[1:02:27] and all the way down they all died but
[1:02:29] this one he made this sacrifice once and
[1:02:32] for
[1:02:32] all and he's he's laying a foundation
[1:02:37] here and we look in the Old
[1:02:40] Testament and the change but from the
[1:02:43] Old Testament to the New Testament is is
[1:02:45] very marked God was a god of pure
[1:02:50] Justice he still is but he was a
[1:02:54] god of justce Justice which means if you
[1:02:58] sinned he required blood he required a
[1:03:03] death for sin he made that promise in
[1:03:05] the Garden of
[1:03:06] Eden and his promise once is for all
[1:03:10] time and he made that promise he said if
[1:03:14] you eat of this fruit you will
[1:03:18] die and they did not only that but God
[1:03:22] stayed his wrath by making a sacrifice
[1:03:25] of an animal but it was not it wasn't a
[1:03:29] human
[1:03:31] so he goes on and he he's talking
[1:03:35] about he he's moving the people he's
[1:03:38] saying that there is a point in all of
[1:03:40] this Old Testament teaching that and and
[1:03:43] you look at the Old Testament there is
[1:03:45] no emphasis on a personal relationship
[1:03:48] with God the emphasis is on ritual the
[1:03:54] emphasis is on
[1:03:57] um it's it's it's on obedience but then
[1:04:00] we get to the New Testament and it
[1:04:02] changes from ritual there's almost no um
[1:04:07] emphasis in the New Testament on ritual
[1:04:10] now it's all on a personal
[1:04:12] relationship the Old Testament the the
[1:04:15] the Sabbath the the book of Hebrews
[1:04:17] talks about the Sabbath and and and how
[1:04:20] that we were supposed to rest one day of
[1:04:21] the week and the author here he says but
[1:04:24] then if you get into Christ it is an
[1:04:27] always you always rest because you are
[1:04:30] eternally sealed there and he talks
[1:04:33] about all of these different things that
[1:04:35] come in the Old Testament he says
[1:04:37] basically there's a point to all of this
[1:04:39] you just been going and you've been
[1:04:40] doing all these things but all of these
[1:04:42] come to that point and it's that one
[1:04:44] that Messiah that you have accepted
[1:04:47] now I think all of us should ask the
[1:04:50] same question that this sister asked me
[1:04:56] when she started hearing all this stuff
[1:04:59] about these different churches and they
[1:05:00] they were telling her to do this and do
[1:05:02] that what is the
[1:05:05] point what is the point in it all there
[1:05:08] has to be a
[1:05:10] reason there has to be a reason that
[1:05:13] they took the
[1:05:14] scapegoat they took two goats one was
[1:05:17] killed and one was sent out into the
[1:05:19] Wilderness in the Old Testament there
[1:05:22] has to be a reason for that and we need
[1:05:24] to understand those Reas reasons there
[1:05:27] has to be a reason for for the way that
[1:05:30] we live our lives do we think that we do
[1:05:34] things because God's going to bless us
[1:05:35] for it do we think that I'm doing this I
[1:05:38] want to live this way because I want
[1:05:40] reward or I want to make money or I'm
[1:05:43] I'm going to prosper because of my
[1:05:44] religion is that why we do things
[1:05:46] because that's the wrong
[1:05:49] thoughts that's that's not it we do
[1:05:51] these things we try to live for the Lord
[1:05:53] because he died for my sins he he's
[1:05:55] wonderful and I want to spend my
[1:05:57] eternity with him he's so
[1:06:01] great I grew up
[1:06:04] thinking in my thought I wasn't taught
[1:06:06] this but I grew up thinking the more
[1:06:09] that I could give to the
[1:06:11] church the better my life would be and
[1:06:15] it went monetarily and I would give give
[1:06:17] everything that I could every dollar
[1:06:18] that I could get together I would I
[1:06:19] would give that because I thought that I
[1:06:22] that would bring me closer to God
[1:06:26] but I wasn't getting the
[1:06:28] point then I started as as um when I was
[1:06:32] really young when I I was about 20 years
[1:06:34] old I started giving things up in my
[1:06:37] life I started giving giving up partying
[1:06:39] with my friends and and and then I
[1:06:41] separated myself even from my good
[1:06:43] friends because they didn't see things
[1:06:45] exactly like I did then I started giving
[1:06:48] up gave up movies and I gave up
[1:06:49] television and and then I got married
[1:06:51] and we had children and Stephanie and I
[1:06:53] we wouldn't even read fairy tales to
[1:06:55] Daniel and meline it was only Bible
[1:06:58] stories and I'm I'm glad we did it but
[1:07:02] there was a
[1:07:03] point and there should be a point and we
[1:07:06] should understand what that point would
[1:07:08] be moved our family across the
[1:07:12] country I thought I was I was doing
[1:07:14] right and and I believe that I was led
[1:07:16] of the Lord but I didn't understand that
[1:07:18] there is an ultimate there is a pinnacle
[1:07:21] there's a top of the mountain in all of
[1:07:23] this and it's not just just living right
[1:07:28] that's part of it and if someone says
[1:07:31] let me back up a little bit if someone
[1:07:34] says that they believe in the Lord
[1:07:38] Jesus and they're not willing to make
[1:07:40] changes in their life then I question
[1:07:43] that
[1:07:44] testimony am they
[1:07:47] um they had a I gave a testimony last
[1:07:50] week about a young man or I think it was
[1:07:52] last week about a young man that I
[1:07:56] saw this young man I saw the Holy Spirit
[1:07:59] come down and enter that young man I saw
[1:08:04] it because I saw it on his face I felt
[1:08:05] the feeling of it I I didn't see
[1:08:07] anything come down but I I I just I saw
[1:08:10] this man give his heart to the Lord and
[1:08:12] I saw the change in him and then I
[1:08:14] talked about how this young man as time
[1:08:17] went on he started slipping back and
[1:08:22] then his life started getting worse and
[1:08:25] worse and worse until this day that he
[1:08:30] doesn't have a career he doesn't he
[1:08:31] doesn't have a have a good life he
[1:08:33] doesn't have happiness he he goes from
[1:08:34] girl to girl and and there's there's
[1:08:36] really there's no foundation in his life
[1:08:40] and and the answer to me really came on
[1:08:43] that sermon that we heard on Wednesday
[1:08:46] night if you heard that there was a
[1:08:50] brother
[1:08:52] Ramsay and um the um he was he was a
[1:08:55] minister of the Gospel way back brother
[1:08:57] brandham knew him he was a friend of
[1:08:59] brother brandham and the two would get
[1:09:01] together and they'd talk about the Lord
[1:09:03] and and he was a uh I believe a Church
[1:09:05] of God Minister just really a good
[1:09:09] man and brother brandom was overseas and
[1:09:12] he comes back and he works and this
[1:09:15] brother Ramsey Works in a mechanic shop
[1:09:17] and he says he says brother Ramsey says
[1:09:20] um how you doing I'd like for you to go
[1:09:22] overseas with me sometime brother Ramsey
[1:09:24] said I don't serve God anymore
[1:09:28] Billy he didn't see the point in all of
[1:09:31] it and it really hurt brother brandham
[1:09:34] and brother brandham
[1:09:35] thought did I hear him right he goes out
[1:09:38] to the car he's with his wife there and
[1:09:41] he says wait a minute he goes back in he
[1:09:43] says what did you
[1:09:45] say he says I don't serve God anymore I
[1:09:47] don't want to talk about it I don't want
[1:09:48] to talk about
[1:09:50] it so
[1:09:52] then one one of the the employees that
[1:09:54] worked there goes to brother brandom he
[1:09:56] says he says listen he says things are
[1:09:59] bad he says he says what happened the
[1:10:01] other day he said this brother Ramsey he
[1:10:04] said he told me he said the the bars
[1:10:06] weren't open on the on the Indiana side
[1:10:08] so he had to go over to Louisville he
[1:10:09] said he told me to go over and get him a
[1:10:12] case of beer and come back and he said
[1:10:14] brother Ramsey I've been guilty of a lot
[1:10:16] of things in my life but buying a
[1:10:18] servant of God a case of beer ain't one
[1:10:20] of them and it's not going to
[1:10:22] be so he took the young man's car and he
[1:10:25] goes over and he gets tanked up comes
[1:10:27] back with his with his
[1:10:30] beer and then the man got
[1:10:33] sick and died young
[1:10:36] man this this
[1:10:39] preacher and brother brandom's opinion
[1:10:42] on this was that this man must have been
[1:10:46] saved because when he turned from the
[1:10:49] Lord his life started falling apart and
[1:10:54] he ended up getting sick he ended up
[1:10:56] dying but it didn't change his salvation
[1:10:59] and I look at the same in my own
[1:11:02] experience with this young man and how
[1:11:05] with
[1:11:06] him I see I would love to see him come
[1:11:09] back because his life will
[1:11:14] change but there are others that just
[1:11:16] Prosper they just seem to prosper in
[1:11:18] their
[1:11:19] sins they live wrong things just seem to
[1:11:22] get better they they they they start
[1:11:25] living worldly they start sinning they
[1:11:28] start doing all of these things but then
[1:11:30] they continue to prosper and and
[1:11:32] everything is good in life and I wonder
[1:11:33] and we are not a judge and I'm not a
[1:11:36] judge but are these people
[1:11:40] truly Sons and Daughters of God that are
[1:11:43] prospering in sin I can't judge neither
[1:11:46] can you but I know that my Bible says
[1:11:50] that more are the children of Darkness
[1:11:52] than the children of the light so there
[1:11:54] are many people
[1:11:56] that they are not called of God they're
[1:11:58] not chosen of God Hebrews 6 says it is
[1:12:02] impossible for those who have once been
[1:12:04] enlightened who have tasted of the
[1:12:05] Heavenly gift who have shared in the
[1:12:07] Holy Spirit have tasted of the goodness
[1:12:09] of the word of God and the powers of the
[1:12:10] coming
[1:12:11] age and who have fallen
[1:12:14] away to be brought back to
[1:12:17] repentance to their loss they are
[1:12:19] crucifying the Son of God all over
[1:12:22] again and putting him to an open shame
[1:12:27] we need to look at ourselves I was I was
[1:12:31] uh on a
[1:12:33] flight and I was not happy we were
[1:12:37] delayed and delayed and delayed so
[1:12:40] finally I get on my flight to head from
[1:12:43] St Louis to Phoenix and I land and I'm
[1:12:46] late and I'm thinking okay I got 15
[1:12:49] minutes to get to my next flight I get
[1:12:53] all my stuff I I I I get out of the
[1:12:55] plane and I'm taking and I'm running and
[1:12:57] I go I'm going about a quarter mile down
[1:13:00] down the uh the Phoenix Airport and I'm
[1:13:02] cruising I'm looking and I look down and
[1:13:04] my shoes untied and I'm like oh no I
[1:13:07] don't have time to tie it just please
[1:13:09] don't let me step on it and fall in
[1:13:11] front of all these people so so I'm
[1:13:12] running and I get on the on the the the
[1:13:15] moving walkway and I'm going there and
[1:13:16] I'm thinking I'm really cruising now I'm
[1:13:18] making up time I get there and I and I
[1:13:20] turn the corner and I get to the gate
[1:13:22] and there's this lady and I said I'm on
[1:13:24] this flight she said the doors are
[1:13:31] closed and I was faced with a
[1:13:37] decision did I do what my flesh was
[1:13:39] wanting me to do and let her have
[1:13:44] it and I
[1:13:46] paused and uh for once I did the right
[1:13:51] thing I'm sure my face was red I I know
[1:13:55] I was red because I was running um but
[1:13:57] and sweating um and I said
[1:14:02] uh and she says oh why were you
[1:14:07] [Music]
[1:14:11] late I was in the air on your
[1:14:16] airline and she says well there's no
[1:14:19] more flights to Tucson I'm in
[1:14:21] Phoenix middle of the night there's no
[1:14:23] more flights to Tucson you're going to
[1:14:24] have to wait till tomorrow
[1:14:26] morning and I said okay um thanks what
[1:14:31] do I need to do now but I wanted to I
[1:14:35] wanted to my flesh wanted to let her let
[1:14:37] her have it do you remember when I
[1:14:38] brought Moses fryo up here and I had him
[1:14:42] stand and I said what kind of a tree is
[1:14:45] he I said he's this and he's that but
[1:14:47] then I put an apple in his
[1:14:49] hand now what kind he said oh he's an
[1:14:51] apple tree it was because of the fruit
[1:14:53] that Moses had
[1:14:56] and it's the same with all of us I can
[1:14:59] say I'm a Christian I can I can I can
[1:15:02] get up here and preach and I can do all
[1:15:04] these things but what fruit am I
[1:15:07] bearing what is
[1:15:11] me talking to that
[1:15:14] lady I I did I was upset but let it go
[1:15:19] there's nothing she could have done the
[1:15:20] door is closed she can't reopen it I
[1:15:23] understood that wouldn't have been her
[1:15:25] her fault but the fruit so then I got to
[1:15:28] go I went to the hotel and and stayed it
[1:15:31] was middle of the night I was like 1 12
[1:15:34] it was like no it wasn't 12 yet because
[1:15:36] I went there and and there was a young
[1:15:37] lady I was in the hotel and she had a
[1:15:40] birthday balloon there and I said uh I
[1:15:44] said whose birthday is it and she says
[1:15:46] well it's mine she says well actually in
[1:15:47] like 20 minutes 30 minutes It'll be my
[1:15:51] birthday and I said oh it's mine
[1:15:53] too and she oh so we were born on the
[1:15:55] same day and and and I got to talk to
[1:15:58] her about the Lord so so the Lord
[1:16:01] honored it then in chapter 7 we we heard
[1:16:05] about this mzc and how there are things
[1:16:08] going on in other dimensions that we
[1:16:10] don't understand and this man MDC he
[1:16:14] actually the Bible says he resembled he
[1:16:16] looked like the Son of God he looked
[1:16:19] like Jesus and we go back to to Moses
[1:16:22] and how he desired to see the glory of
[1:16:24] God and God put him in in a CFT of a
[1:16:27] rock and then he walked by and it was a
[1:16:29] man that walked
[1:16:31] by and then we see in the Book of Daniel
[1:16:34] and how they went to the fiery furnace
[1:16:36] and the Nebuchadnezzar the king looks in
[1:16:38] there and they have Shadrach mesach and
[1:16:41] Abednego and there was a fourth one in
[1:16:42] there and he says oh it looks like the
[1:16:44] Son of God so who was
[1:16:48] this and
[1:16:50] MDC was that priesthood and he was this
[1:16:54] I believe this man
[1:16:57] Jesus before he became flesh in the
[1:17:01] Child Jesus it was another manifestation
[1:17:04] I gave some testimonies about how that
[1:17:06] can
[1:17:07] happen now Hebrews chapter
[1:17:10] 8 now of the things which we have spoken
[1:17:15] this is the sum most modern translations
[1:17:17] say this is the main point of what we
[1:17:21] are saying so everything that I just
[1:17:23] went to went through all of
[1:17:26] my way too
[1:17:28] long preamble to this it all has a
[1:17:33] point now the main point of what we are
[1:17:36] saying is this we have such a high
[1:17:38] priest who is set at the right hand of
[1:17:40] the Throne of the Majesty in Heavens in
[1:17:42] the heavens a minister of the sanctuary
[1:17:45] and of the Tabernacle which the Lord
[1:17:47] pitched and not man so Moses was in the
[1:17:50] wilderness I talked about the the tent
[1:17:52] that they they built and and he's saying
[1:17:54] saying here he says no but but this tent
[1:17:57] Moses built and he followed the
[1:17:58] instructions of God but this is a
[1:18:00] tabernacle that's built without
[1:18:03] hands what does he mean by
[1:18:08] that for every high priest is ordained
[1:18:11] to offer gifts and sacrifices whereof it
[1:18:13] is of a necessity that this man have
[1:18:17] somewhat also to offer for we for he for
[1:18:22] if he were on Earth he should not be a a
[1:18:25] priest seeing that there are priests
[1:18:28] that offer gifts according to the law
[1:18:31] who serve under the example in the
[1:18:33] shadow of the Heavenly things as Moses
[1:18:35] was admonished of God when he was about
[1:18:37] to make the Tabernacle for see saith he
[1:18:43] that thou make all things according to
[1:18:45] the pattern shown to thee on the mount
[1:18:47] so Moses so God gave Moses the
[1:18:49] directions he's the blueprints he said
[1:18:51] here's how you build the Tabernacle but
[1:18:53] now
[1:18:55] hath he obtained a more excellent
[1:18:57] Ministry by how much also he is the
[1:19:01] mediator of a better Covenant which was
[1:19:04] established upon better
[1:19:08] promises this is a very strange
[1:19:10] statement we are talking about the word
[1:19:12] of God here the Old Testament is just as
[1:19:15] much the word of God as the New
[1:19:17] Testament so how could this author I
[1:19:21] believe is Paul of the book of Hebrews
[1:19:23] how could he say
[1:19:26] that there is something there is a
[1:19:28] better Covenant than the word of
[1:19:32] God for if that first Covenant had been
[1:19:35] faultless then should no place have been
[1:19:37] sought for the second the author is
[1:19:40] talking about the law he's talking about
[1:19:42] Exodus um Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy
[1:19:45] he's talking about the law that was
[1:19:46] brought to Moses with all the rules and
[1:19:48] the regulations of of of learning all
[1:19:51] these things and doing all these things
[1:19:52] according to God's word so what was the
[1:19:55] fault brother Ed was there fault in
[1:19:57] God's
[1:19:59] word God's word was eternal so how could
[1:20:03] there be fault in the word of God some
[1:20:06] of it like the Ten Commandments God
[1:20:09] wrote with his own
[1:20:11] finger so how could it be wrong how
[1:20:14] could there be fault in that for finding
[1:20:17] fault with
[1:20:18] them he saith behold the days come
[1:20:21] sayeth the Lord when I will make a New
[1:20:23] Covenant with the house of Israel and
[1:20:25] with the house of Judah so he doesn't
[1:20:27] he's not finding fault with the law he's
[1:20:29] not finding fault with God's word he's
[1:20:31] saying that there's fault in the
[1:20:33] people that they're the ones that messed
[1:20:37] up now the author is going to quote a
[1:20:40] beautiful wonderful prophecy that I
[1:20:44] would I would like to finish on and he
[1:20:46] says
[1:20:47] this he says he's quoting Jeremiah 31 he
[1:20:51] says not according to the Covenant that
[1:20:53] I made with their fathers in the day
[1:20:55] when I took them by the hand to lead
[1:20:57] them out of the land of Egypt we're
[1:20:59] talking about when he brought them
[1:21:01] across the Red Sea because they
[1:21:03] continued not in my Covenant and I
[1:21:06] regarded them not sayeth the Lord so the
[1:21:09] first Covenant when on Mount Sinai when
[1:21:11] when Moses brought the law the
[1:21:12] Commandments of God they immediately
[1:21:14] sinned the people did so he's still he
[1:21:17] has the Ten Commandments and he hadn't
[1:21:19] even got to the bottom of the mountain
[1:21:21] yet and they were already sinning and
[1:21:23] they just continued on they continued on
[1:21:26] failing you I was thinking and I was I
[1:21:28] was reading this and I was thinking of
[1:21:30] of all the rules and regulations and I
[1:21:32] was thinking could anyone have lived
[1:21:34] according to this law and I think they
[1:21:36] could
[1:21:37] have I really do I think that they could
[1:21:40] have lived the letter of the law but no
[1:21:42] one
[1:21:46] did so it wasn't that God's law was weak
[1:21:51] or that it somehow wasn't good enough
[1:21:53] the problem was in
[1:21:58] unbelief verse number 10 for this is the
[1:22:01] Covenant that I will make it's quoting
[1:22:03] Jeremiah for this is the Covenant that I
[1:22:05] will make with the house of Israel after
[1:22:07] those days sayeth the Lord I will put my
[1:22:10] laws into their mind and write them in
[1:22:12] their hearts and I will be to them a God
[1:22:15] and they shall be to me a
[1:22:17] people and they shall not teach every
[1:22:20] man his neighbor and every man his
[1:22:22] brother saying no the Lord for All Shall
[1:22:25] know me from the least to the
[1:22:28] greatest for I will be merciful under
[1:22:31] their unrighteousness and their sins and
[1:22:34] their iniquities while I remember no
[1:22:36] more this was not the case in the Old
[1:22:38] Testament God was constantly reminding
[1:22:41] the people you did this at Kadesh barnea
[1:22:44] you did this at Mount Si you did this in
[1:22:47] the Book of Judges you did all of this
[1:22:49] but now somehow he won't remember those
[1:22:53] sins anymore
[1:22:56] more everything is turned from failure
[1:23:00] in the Old Testament not God's word
[1:23:03] God's word was perfect but the people's
[1:23:06] failure it went from failure into the
[1:23:09] Old Testament to
[1:23:11] success in the New
[1:23:14] Testament it's amazing how the things
[1:23:17] change and in that he saith a New
[1:23:20] Covenant he hath made the first and a
[1:23:24] new Co a New Covenant he hath made the
[1:23:26] first the first old the first one he
[1:23:28] made old now that which decayeth and
[1:23:32] waxist old is ready to vanish away
[1:23:35] English Standard Version says
[1:23:37] obsolete the New Covenant was made
[1:23:40] obsolete does that mean that God's word
[1:23:42] is obsolete no but it wasn't a success
[1:23:47] in the people because they didn't
[1:23:48] believe it and they
[1:23:51] sinned and I'll finish with this
[1:23:55] so how could we have a very plain set of
[1:23:59] rules and regulations to live in the Old
[1:24:01] Testament and then we go over to the New
[1:24:04] Testament and there are no rules and no
[1:24:06] regulations anymore like I mentioned
[1:24:09] Tammy the the lady I just said her name
[1:24:11] the lady that I that I knew that was
[1:24:13] going to all these churches and she said
[1:24:15] well this one says I have to do this and
[1:24:16] this and I do that I just want somebody
[1:24:18] who cares about me and now we
[1:24:22] see that we have a high priest who does
[1:24:26] care for us who is able to intercede in
[1:24:28] there so we see that that Jesus came and
[1:24:32] he says they were like you did away with
[1:24:34] the law Jesus is like I didn't do away
[1:24:36] with the law he says I fulfilled the law
[1:24:39] Jesus Christ all of this Old Testament
[1:24:42] became this Old Testament became flesh
[1:24:44] in the man Jesus Christ so God looked
[1:24:46] down and he says this Bible that was
[1:24:50] written with all these different
[1:24:51] prophets here is the manif estation of
[1:24:56] what that was a perfect human
[1:25:00] being so then we go
[1:25:02] on and we see that that there is rest in
[1:25:07] this man Jesus and and there is this
[1:25:10] this wonderful
[1:25:13] success of that we can overcome and how
[1:25:16] much do we love him and how much does he
[1:25:18] love us and there's all of this love and
[1:25:20] there's there's all of this this this
[1:25:23] evangelism going out and the gospel is
[1:25:25] spreading there was none of that in the
[1:25:27] Old Testament
[1:25:28] either it was just one race of people
[1:25:32] and then it exploded and went all over
[1:25:34] so what was the
[1:25:36] difference what happened was this man
[1:25:38] Jesus who was a personification of the
[1:25:41] law he died for our sins Rose from the
[1:25:44] grave it's an amazing thing he said I
[1:25:46] can lay down my life and I can take it
[1:25:48] up again Jesus Christ himself he was
[1:25:52] dead he was dead in the grave Jesus
[1:25:55] Christ himself said I'll take it back up
[1:25:58] and here comes life back into that body
[1:26:01] for his none of us could do that
[1:26:03] nobody's ever been able to do that but
[1:26:05] Jesus could do it and then that life
[1:26:08] Jesus goes up and ascends as it says
[1:26:10] here to the right hand of God and then
[1:26:12] that same life it comes down and it
[1:26:15] dwells in this Tabernacle of Flesh that
[1:26:18] was not made with hands
[1:26:20] me
[1:26:22] you I wasn't made with hands God made me
[1:26:26] I it wasn't there's no blueprint to me
[1:26:28] there's no there's no poles and and and
[1:26:31] sides and all that I am that so he comes
[1:26:36] in and like the shikina of Glory that we
[1:26:38] come down in the holy of holies Here
[1:26:40] Comes This Spirit of Jesus Christ and it
[1:26:43] comes into a human
[1:26:45] being the same spirit that Jesus had now
[1:26:49] the
[1:26:50] law is
[1:26:52] obsolete because the the law now is in
[1:26:55] me and I don't have to look up well now
[1:26:58] what sacrifice do I make
[1:27:01] here the law becomes flesh in me and now
[1:27:05] I
[1:27:06] know and it tells me every answer to
[1:27:09] every question that I need for the
[1:27:12] Sisters is it okay to wear this is it
[1:27:14] okay to wear that what does the Holy
[1:27:15] Spirit tell
[1:27:17] you you shouldn't need a preacher to
[1:27:19] tell you those things what you need is a
[1:27:22] preacher like this book of Hebrews to
[1:27:23] say here's where it is here's what Jesus
[1:27:27] does and when he comes into you when he
[1:27:29] comes into your your flesh and you are
[1:27:31] filled with that Holy Spirit you will be
[1:27:33] able to answer those questions because
[1:27:36] it's God answering them and it's
[1:27:38] everything from what do I eat to to what
[1:27:42] job how do I act on the in in in the in
[1:27:45] the
[1:27:46] airport when I'm running my shoes tie
[1:27:49] untied and I'm mad and I get there and I
[1:27:52] said I'm ready for my plane
[1:27:56] oh here comes the Holy Spirit out don't
[1:27:59] say
[1:28:00] it don't do it there was the law
[1:28:04] manifested in the flesh and I didn't and
[1:28:07] it's not always a Meek and contrite
[1:28:10] spirit Jesus walked in up to the temple
[1:28:13] and he turned over the tables and he was
[1:28:16] aggressive in that way and sometimes the
[1:28:19] Holy Spirit requires that but it's every
[1:28:23] single SLE thing every single question
[1:28:27] that you have if you have that Spirit it
[1:28:31] will be answered I can help in pointing
[1:28:34] you to the word I can help in showing
[1:28:37] you what the Bible says as this book of
[1:28:39] Hebrews does but the main
[1:28:42] thing is that God promised that I will
[1:28:46] write those laws upon the heart let me
[1:28:49] read it again oh it's beautiful listen
[1:28:52] to this for this is a covenant that I
[1:28:55] will make with the house of Israel after
[1:28:56] those days sayeth the Lord I will put my
[1:28:59] laws into their
[1:29:00] mind and write them in their hearts and
[1:29:03] will be to them a God and they shall be
[1:29:06] to me a
[1:29:08] people and they shall not teach every
[1:29:10] man his
[1:29:11] neighbor I don't have to tell you
[1:29:14] everything I don't have to show you
[1:29:16] here's this Rule and that rule and this
[1:29:17] is how long your skirt should be or you
[1:29:20] shouldn't wear this or you or or or your
[1:29:21] hair should be like this that's the Holy
[1:29:23] Spirit job I can show you where it is in
[1:29:25] the Bible but then that spirit that is
[1:29:28] within you it will answer those
[1:29:31] questions it's beautiful and it's a
[1:29:34] promise right here that's not only
[1:29:35] written in Jeremiah but here it is in
[1:29:37] Hebrew showing that this is alive today
[1:29:39] now I will put my laws into their
[1:29:43] minds oh and then my spirit will
[1:29:48] interpret to
[1:29:50] them what they need to know the
[1:29:53] musicians can come
[1:29:55] for I will be merciful to their
[1:29:58] unrighteousness when I sin and I do God
[1:30:01] will forgive me he'll take care of it
[1:30:03] for
[1:30:05] me and their sins and their iniquities I
[1:30:08] will remember no
[1:30:10] more how wonderful is that statement and
[1:30:15] it's a promise from
[1:30:16] God my sins I look back there's plenty
[1:30:19] of them I sin every day I mess up every
[1:30:22] day because I put my in front of God's
[1:30:25] word I put myself in front of that
[1:30:27] spirit I don't listen to that still
[1:30:29] Small Voice that speaks to
[1:30:31] me but then God knows that I'm human and
[1:30:35] he comes in but there is repentance in
[1:30:37] me as Hebrews 6 I believe it
[1:30:40] says that if there's no
[1:30:42] repentance then there's no hope but
[1:30:45] there's repentance in me because I feel
[1:30:47] bad and I want to make things right and
[1:30:50] if I say say something wrong to somebody
[1:30:51] I'm going to come on I'm going to say
[1:30:52] I'm sorry
[1:30:54] and then
[1:30:55] God no matter how bad I feel no matter
[1:30:58] how dumb I feel no matter what what I've
[1:31:01] done God goes
[1:31:03] up and he says no I don't know anything
[1:31:07] that you've done all I see is my son
[1:31:10] Jesus Christ because that is the spirit
[1:31:13] that dwells in this Tabernacle not made
[1:31:15] with
[1:31:16] hands it is the spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:31:20] that is leading us from everything to
[1:31:25] church renovations to what car we drive
[1:31:27] to how to how we dress to when we go to
[1:31:30] church to to how I
[1:31:34] pray there is a point in all of it in
[1:31:38] Hebrews 7 I mean I'm sorry Hebrews 8:1
[1:31:42] it says now the things which we have
[1:31:44] spoken this is the sum this is the point
[1:31:48] of all those things and it is that Jesus
[1:31:51] Christ dwells in this Tabernacle of
[1:31:56] Flesh do you believe it brothers and
[1:31:58] sisters it's a promise how we should I
[1:32:01] mean how we should think about how we
[1:32:02] should just
[1:32:04] Rejoice that this is not the Old
[1:32:07] Testament that there is a spirit of God
[1:32:10] it's called the holy
[1:32:13] spirit that came
[1:32:16] down and promised that if I will just
[1:32:21] believe if I will repent if if I will be
[1:32:24] baptized if I will do these things in
[1:32:27] the name of Jesus Christ that that same
[1:32:29] Jesus Christ will come down and dwell
[1:32:31] within me and then I can have my
[1:32:34] questions answered it's not easy we have
[1:32:37] to desire
[1:32:39] God but I'll tell you I would rather
[1:32:44] have God answering my questions than
[1:32:47] anyone else on this
[1:32:49] Earth because he is perfect he never
[1:32:52] made a mistake
[1:32:55] I'm so grateful I'm so grateful for that
[1:32:58] prophecy of Jeremiah I will write my
[1:33:02] word on their hearts and in their minds
[1:33:06] words we're always thinking about that
[1:33:10] and
[1:33:11] then like with this lady that I
[1:33:14] witnessed to or that that um that called
[1:33:16] out one day that the Lord delivered from
[1:33:19] smoking I can say what does the Holy
[1:33:21] Spirit tell
[1:33:22] you and how you act where you go to
[1:33:26] church where you how you dress what you
[1:33:29] look like what does the Holy Spirit tell
[1:33:31] you about this
[1:33:33] scripture because we have the same
[1:33:37] spirit I have the spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:33:40] in me and it's the same Spirit that's in
[1:33:42] you and as I read in 1 Corinthians
[1:33:44] chapter 12 before he he has different
[1:33:46] works for all of us and he gives us each
[1:33:49] different gifts but the one thing that
[1:33:51] it it comes to the peak is that it is
[1:33:54] all capped in
[1:33:57] love love is the Capstone love is the
[1:34:00] greatest how could he say I show you a
[1:34:03] more excellent way though I speak with
[1:34:06] tongue of men and angels and have not
[1:34:08] love I am nothing it all is Capp there
[1:34:12] amen don't you want to have that Spirit
[1:34:16] don't you want the spirit of Jesus
[1:34:17] Christ to dwell within you then there's
[1:34:20] no questions then you don't have to
[1:34:21] worry there's always hope there
[1:34:24] if things go bad say Lord I know it's
[1:34:26] it's you it's okay I know that you're
[1:34:30] working this out for my good I may have
[1:34:32] caused this I may have made a mistake
[1:34:33] but I know it's you everything's going
[1:34:35] to be all right because you know me and
[1:34:38] you've got your hand on me and this
[1:34:40] Spirit that's within me it communicates
[1:34:43] with that Spirit that's in heaven and I
[1:34:46] just know everything's going to be all
[1:34:48] right everything will be fine Dani

[1:37:18] feel
[1:37:20] protected there's no place I'd r
[1:37:24] ra one more time falling in love with
[1:37:29] Jesus Falling In

[1:37:50] Jesus there's nothing I've ever
[1:37:54] ever done I have fallen in love with
[1:37:58] Jesus the Manny how could I not fall in
[1:38:01] love with him he is
[1:38:04] wonderful and his Spirit abides in
[1:38:08] me and if I would just listen to
[1:38:12] him
[1:38:14] then my life would be a lot
[1:38:18] better we get ourselves in the way and
[1:38:21] brothers and sisters when I when I was
[1:38:23] ministering on this I hope that you
[1:38:26] understand that when Jesus came he did
[1:38:29] not do a away with the law he fulfilled
[1:38:32] the law and he magnified the law and if
[1:38:35] you truly accept Jesus Christ as your
[1:38:39] savior and you have that relationship
[1:38:41] with him and that Spirit comes down into
[1:38:45] you you will be a more holy
[1:38:49] person you won't sin
[1:38:54] like legalism and you know I'm against
[1:38:57] legalism legalism brings in
[1:38:59] sin legalism encourages that because you
[1:39:03] have a set of rules and there's always a
[1:39:04] way around the rules now when that law
[1:39:06] comes into your heart there's no way
[1:39:08] around it it's all Holiness it's all
[1:39:12] love it's all
[1:39:13] God it's Jesus Christ in
[1:39:16] people and you can look at
[1:39:19] yourself and you can say what would
[1:39:22] Jesus Jesus have done in this situation
[1:39:25] that I am in and then that spirit will
[1:39:28] come forth and it'll do the same thing
[1:39:30] for he was holy he is Holy he's God
