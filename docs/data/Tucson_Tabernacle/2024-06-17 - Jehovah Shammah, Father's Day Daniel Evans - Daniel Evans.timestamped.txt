[23:01] testimony I'd like to share uh when I
[23:04] think about the
[23:06] Lord um the former church I go to the
[23:09] pastor at this church uh was over in in
[23:14] on Vancouver Island with some friends
[23:17] and one of one one of these friends was
[23:19] a man who was a pastor's son who had
[23:22] grown up in church all his life and had
[23:25] seen the spirit of God move he had seen
[23:27] people healed had seen people saved but
[23:30] they were walking down this street in uh
[23:33] in Victoria British
[23:35] Columbia and he turned and he said you
[23:37] know what I don't know that I've ever
[23:40] met
[23:42] him and his brother Tom he said you can

[23:54] down right there and that man received
[23:56] the baptism of the Holy Ghost on that

[32:33] um I uh I said so you know what do you
[32:35] do is this is your job he says yeah he
[32:37] says uh he says well he says um I said
[32:41] do you have a pool because they were
[32:42] building the pool in my house I said do
[32:44] you have a pool and he said he says no
[32:46] he says um I moved out uh a little while
[32:49] ago he says I got started and he said
[32:51] then I ran into some problems and the
[32:54] girl I was with we split up and he said
[32:59] um he said but then he says you know he
[33:02] says it was good I moov back at home
[33:03] with Mom and
[33:04] Dad and first of all I told him it's
[33:07] good that you have a mom and dad to move
[33:08] back in with he should be thankful for
[33:11] that and he says yeah he says I was I
[33:13] moved back in with Mom and Dad and he
[33:14] says you know he says I just I I needed
[33:17] it and he says you know I just started
[33:20] praying and uh I said wow you I thought
[33:23] in my heart wow that's not common for
[33:25] somebody to say something like that' and
[33:28] he says ' yeah and he says ' then he
[33:29] says I started going back to church and
[33:30] he said 'you know it was it was all best
[33:32] I said I responded so so you go to
[33:35] church huh and he said he says yeah he
[33:38] says I do um and uh I said uh well I
[33:43] said I'm a
[33:44] pastor and he said I knew
[33:49] it he said there was something about you
[33:53] he said it was just you can he says you
[33:56] can feel that presence when you when you
[33:58] come into contact with someone else that
[34:01] believes the Lord Jesus and I must admit
[34:03] I felt the same about him he was he was
[34:07] just you know he's out there working and
[34:09] I I said there's just something special
[34:11] about this young man and I wanted to go
[34:14] out and I wanted to talk to him so he
[34:16] was he was out there and we we just had
[34:18] a really nice conversation and and his
[34:21] colleagues were getting mad at him
[34:22] because he wasn't working I was like hey
[34:24] man I'm the boss I'm paying the bills
[34:27] kid can do what I tell him to so anyways
[34:30] it was it was a really it was a nice
[34:33] time but it's important brothers and
[34:36] sisters we recognize that there is a
[34:40] spirit about a Christian and it's not
[34:43] our spirit all of us have our own
[34:45] individual Spirits we all have flaws and
[34:48] and things with our personalities but
[34:50] when we actually receive God's spirit it
[34:53] has nothing to do with us it's not by
[34:56] our own Merit it's not because we're
[34:58] special it has nothing to do with us
[35:00] it's all him and if we can just portray
[35:04] that Spirit to the world then we will be
[35:08] successful I was uh talking with a
[35:11] friend of mine I I go to Yuma every once
[35:13] in a while and uh a friend of mine who
[35:15] is he's listening in now he's considers
[35:18] himself part of this church him and his
[35:20] wife they and they as I said they live
[35:22] in the Yuma area and we had dinner and
[35:27] he was is telling me that this testimony
[35:30] of this man that he had met he's a
[35:33] Catholic man and uh the man had a
[35:36] stroke and he said that he frustrates
[35:41] people because
[35:42] he he has a tough time getting words out
[35:47] and he he can't like have a normal
[35:49] commun communication you have to be
[35:51] patient with him and he says you know he
[35:54] says he comes by and he comes by all the
[35:56] time now he he rides his bike and he
[35:59] he'll be like hey James and and then um
[36:03] James will say hey come on in and and
[36:05] they'll come in and they'll have this
[36:06] nice conversation and he says he says
[36:10] he's really found the Lord since he has
[36:13] had this stroke his wife left him
[36:16] because now there's no use for him
[36:19] really he can't make a living he can't
[36:21] he can't provide for the family so she
[36:23] went on to uh what she probably
[36:25] considers better things well this man
[36:28] went to
[36:30] God and he as I said he rides by and his
[36:35] bike so he comes in and visits brother
[36:38] James and brother James says that we
[36:40] have the nicest conversations and and
[36:42] the man apologizes I know I take a a
[36:45] long time to get stuff out and brother
[36:47] James's attitude is like hey I'm retired
[36:49] I got all day
[36:50] long just keep talking and he said he
[36:54] told me and tears came to his eyes
[36:58] eyes and he says you know he says I
[37:01] can't remember things brother Daniel he
[37:05] says that I can't remember the
[37:08] scriptures like you can remember them
[37:11] and he says I guess it's just that I'm
[37:12] not very smart or something and he says
[37:17] but I wish that I could be a good
[37:19] influence on this man I wish I I wish I
[37:21] could be a a witness to him I wish I
[37:23] could just take the Bible and and just
[37:26] open it up and go from scripture to
[37:27] scripture like you can and and present
[37:29] it to this this man he says I just but I
[37:31] just fail and big tears were in his eyes
[37:34] and I said brother James what are you
[37:35] talking
[37:37] about I said how do you think it would
[37:40] go with this man if I walked up with my
[37:43] Bible and I said now listen I want to
[37:45] show you some scriptures and how you are
[37:47] wrong and explain to you about what
[37:51] you're believing and how and how that it
[37:53] is flawed I said how would that go with
[37:56] this man
[37:58] and he says well I don't know I said God
[38:02] has placed you
[38:05] there because you have something that is
[38:08] beyond any type of Theologian how
[38:11] somebody could dig into the Bible and
[38:13] explain these things I said what you
[38:15] have presented to this man and why he
[38:17] loves you so much is because you are
[38:19] showing love to him and love is so rare
[38:24] today and this man just loves brother
[38:27] James
[38:27] he's always coming by and brother James
[38:30] says well yeah I mean he he goes to
[38:31] church every single day and and I said
[38:34] brother James let me ask you this okay
[38:36] he's Catholic okay do you want to change
[38:39] him he goes to church every
[38:42] day he loves the Lord that much he's
[38:46] that serious about it and you want to
[38:49] get this man to maybe stop doing that
[38:52] and he says
[38:54] no I said that's what you're asking for
[38:58] no you need to just show him love and be
[39:02] a witness to him and you are both
[39:05] brothers you are Christians you love the
[39:09] Lord Jesus and that's why you are
[39:11] successful and if I went to the same man
[39:14] I wouldn't be successful God placed you
[39:17] there my
[39:19] friend and you are you are doing it
[39:23] you're helping this man
[39:27] but do you see how the enemy attacks
[39:31] them have compassion on them love them
[39:36] you understand remember we've been going
[39:38] through the book of
[39:40] Hebrews he is a high priest that can be
[39:43] touched by the feelings of our
[39:45] infirmities he has been tempted in every
[39:48] way the Bible says yet without sin so he
[39:52] has felt all of these problems that we
[39:54] feel he's felt all of these Temptations
[39:56] all of these angers everything the enemy
[39:59] hit him with everything that the enemy
[40:02] has and yet he didn't sin but he did it
[40:06] he chose to do it so he would understand
[40:09] what we go through what a wonderful
[40:12] wonderful father if I I never want to go
[40:15] through those things because they make
[40:17] you miserable I remember one time I was
[40:20] living in Jeffersonville I um I was
[40:22] doing some landscaping and I picked up
[40:23] this big rock and man I hurt my back and
[40:27] I've always had a good strong back and
[40:29] it torqued it and I couldn't breathe for
[40:32] days it was just hurting really bad and
[40:35] and I remember laying there in such pain
[40:39] and I couldn't
[40:40] move I remember thinking that this is
[40:44] how people with chronic back pain feel
[40:46] every day and the Lord allowed me to
[40:50] experience that now we may not
[40:54] understand how things are we we might
[40:57] not understand when people have
[40:59] different weaknesses that are are ours
[41:02] but God does understand it a loving
[41:05] father really understands what his
[41:08] children go through and he could not
[41:10] have done it he was the he was the all
[41:13] knowing all he was the Eternal God he
[41:16] created the heavens and the Earth he did
[41:18] all of these things but then he lowered
[41:20] himself to a man and not just a man he
[41:25] lowered himself to a flesh and blood man
[41:29] that got
[41:31] old that had back pain that had all of
[41:35] these different feelings attacking him
[41:40] so he would understand what he what we
[41:43] all go through and yet he did it without
[41:46] sin showing us that we can
[41:50] overcome I
[41:53] um uh a friend of mine um when I was in
[41:57] Yuma um a brother that I work with um
[42:01] down there he's I spent the day with him
[42:04] and he's leaving so um I wanted to get
[42:07] some get some time with him and he was
[42:09] telling me of a camp that his wife and
[42:13] his daughter went to and it was kind of
[42:17] a Coming of Age camp for the young
[42:20] ladies
[42:22] and he told me that they were teaching
[42:24] them about living right and about how to
[42:28] how to just how to just be a good
[42:29] Christian and and one of the things was
[42:33] the fathers would write a letter to the
[42:35] daughters and warn
[42:38] them about some of the
[42:41] perils mainly was Immortal living and
[42:44] that was kind of the focus and the
[42:46] daughters or the the dads would wrote
[42:48] the daughters a letter for them to open
[42:50] up when they were at the camp and he
[42:53] said he goes he goes Dan he goes man
[42:55] this is this is rough write my daughter
[42:58] about this stuff and and he said what I
[43:01] wrote to her was that young
[43:07] men they they will deceive
[43:12] you many times to get what they
[43:15] want and you know what I'm speaking
[43:17] about and I said I said bro I said you
[43:21] know isn't that sad I said isn't it sad
[43:24] that you have to write your daughter a
[43:26] letter warning her about these things
[43:29] when it should be the young
[43:33] man that is stronger when it should be
[43:36] the young man that has a closer walk
[43:38] with the Lord when it should be that
[43:40] young man who is worshiping more because
[43:43] the Bible very plainly teaches that the
[43:46] man is the stronger
[43:49] vessel it should be the young man that
[43:53] leads but instead we live in a society
[43:56] right now that teach teaches us
[43:58] weakness and it teaches us immorality
[44:01] and it it teaches us that no you don't
[44:03] have to live a moral
[44:06] life and it's just what it is is it's
[44:10] the lack of
[44:12] dads in the world
[44:15] today and it's even going
[44:18] farther where the the the fathers are
[44:20] pulled out of the
[44:22] family and they don't have that
[44:24] influence that they should on the
[44:26] children children sister Amilia um I
[44:29] Heard the the testimony that brother
[44:31] Josiah read that um so sister Amelia
[44:36] called me and she needed some help with
[44:37] her car yesterday so I um I drove out
[44:42] there and I I looked at the car and the
[44:46] battery was dead so I put the jumper
[44:49] cables on it which she told me that
[44:51] somebody else a kind soul had stopped
[44:53] and helped her and the car started and I
[44:56] put the jumper cables on it started
[44:58] running then I took the jumper cables
[45:01] off and the car
[45:04] stopped and and I told sister amilio
[45:06] it's your
[45:07] alternator um because the um the car
[45:10] should should be generating power even
[45:13] if the battery's dead when uh when that
[45:16] alternator is running so your alternator
[45:18] is bad and and after we got sister milia
[45:21] um back up and going I was driving home
[45:24] last night and I was thinking about
[45:26] Father's Day and I was thinking Lord the
[45:28] reason I know that is because my
[45:31] dad my dad taught me these things my dad
[45:35] helped me work in my my cars my dad was
[45:37] always in my life and he uh he taught me
[45:41] how to fix things he taught me from
[45:43] everything from vehicles
[45:45] to I mean how I know how to
[45:48] drive a
[45:50] scraper and a back
[45:52] ho you know the big giant Earth movers
[45:56] my dad taught me how a drive on how many
[45:57] people can say that how many pastors
[45:58] know how to drive a
[46:00] scraper put that on my my resume um but
[46:04] I know how to do it because my dad
[46:06] taught me and the most important thing
[46:08] my dad taught me he taught me a good
[46:10] work ethic and I do I just appreciate
[46:12] him so much he wasn't my dad wasn't
[46:15] someone that that had a real deep
[46:20] understanding maybe of the Bible he
[46:22] didn't read his Bible very much but what
[46:24] he did do is he listened to tape sermon
[46:27] all the
[46:28] time
[46:29] and he he just he loved those sermons
[46:34] and then he just love to talk with me
[46:36] about it talk with me about brother
[46:39] brandom would say this or or that and he
[46:41] wanted to discuss these things and then
[46:45] and With Me growing
[46:48] up I
[46:49] heard all the time these
[46:53] stories my my dad my my dad's family in
[46:59] 1950 they were listening to the radio in
[47:02] south
[47:03] Georgia and this man was preaching on
[47:05] the radio broadcast and my grandpa Welch
[47:10] Evans he's listening he's like man I
[47:13] like what this guy's saying so he got
[47:15] all the kids together after it was over
[47:17] they said he's gonna they're going to be
[47:19] up in I believe it was Cleveland
[47:21] Tennessee and so that night so my
[47:24] grandpa got all the kids together and
[47:27] took the car and they took off North
[47:30] about five or six hours to Southern
[47:34] Tennessee to hear this
[47:36] man so they started listening to him and
[47:40] following him around the country and the
[47:42] first time they went to William bram's
[47:45] home base which was in Jeffersonville
[47:48] they drive up there they hear that he's
[47:50] going to be in
[47:52] Jeffersonville they drive up there and
[47:54] they get to the town and that's all that
[47:56] they knew they didn't have
[47:58] Google Apple
[48:01] Maps they didn't have any of that it's
[48:03] so strange today but they didn't have it
[48:04] they arrived in this good siiz town and
[48:07] they're like okay well uh where do we go
[48:10] now because we're going to go to these
[48:13] meetings so they see this
[48:16] lady going
[48:19] into this grocery store and remember
[48:23] what I said about the pool guy the uh
[48:26] the construction guy in my backyard my
[48:28] grandpa said he says she looks like a
[48:32] Christian he said my grandma's name is
[48:35] Cle he said CLE go talk to her and see
[48:36] if she's ever heard of William
[48:39] Brandon so my grandma gets out of the
[48:42] car and she goes over and she sees this
[48:45] this um older sister and she says older
[48:49] lady and she says um ma'am she says uh
[48:51] we're here from down south Georgia she
[48:54] said would you know a man named William
[48:58] brandom and she says uh yeah um he's
[49:02] he's a preacher oh she says oh yeah
[49:05] she's well I I think so um my son's name
[49:07] is Bill
[49:08] brandom and he's a
[49:13] minister and she says my grandma says
[49:17] good she invited our family over she
[49:21] made my family a meal they stayed with
[49:25] her and then they went to to those
[49:27] meetings that night they went to that
[49:28] service that night my dad and all the
[49:32] family they had seen the Holy Spirit
[49:35] moving around in the audiences and
[49:38] people coming up to the platform and
[49:41] they would be healed of diseases like
[49:43] cancer or or deformities in wheelchairs
[49:47] coming up and they had seen these things
[49:49] in the short time that they had been
[49:50] following this man and there was a
[49:53] problem in my dad's family and that was
[49:56] his little brother named Jimmy had cross
[49:58] eyed cross eyes couldn't see the eyes
[50:02] were were were locked
[50:05] crossed my dad was
[50:09] sitting in the front in in
[50:11] Jeffersonville sitting in one of the
[50:13] chairs in Jeffersonville and he was
[50:17] praying towards the end of the service
[50:20] the pastor the the
[50:22] minister Prophet had people bow their
[50:24] heads
[50:27] and he and my my
[50:29] dad bowed his head and he was praying
[50:32] for his little
[50:35] brother saying Lord healed Jimmy's
[50:40] eyes had a burden for his brother but
[50:43] what he didn't know is the man in the
[50:46] Pulpit had an experience decades earlier
[50:51] where his daughter his little infant
[50:54] daughter was dying and was in so so much
[50:57] pain as the father would look over her
[50:59] his his wife had just died and now he's
[51:02] looking at his daughter and she is in so
[51:04] much pain that her little eyes would
[51:08] cross from the pain and it just ripped
[51:11] his heart out of
[51:13] him and he looked down and and seeing
[51:16] his his little baby in so much pain and
[51:19] shaking and then she ended up dying and
[51:22] it made an impression such an impression
[51:24] on this Minister that anytime time
[51:26] someone would come to the platform with
[51:28] crossed
[51:30] eyes that same thought would come to
[51:33] this man and it be gave so much
[51:36] compassion that God honored it and every
[51:40] single time that that person would be
[51:43] healed of those crossed eyes my dad
[51:46] didn't know that but there he is in in
[51:48] the audience and he's praying Lord
[51:51] please heal my brother of his crossed
[51:55] eyes
[51:57] at the end of the
[51:59] prayer the
[52:01] Minister William
[52:04] Brandon says amen my dad's eyes were
[52:08] still closed praying for his
[52:12] brother he looked
[52:15] up the minister was looking at
[52:18] him and he said
[52:20] Son God has heard your prayers for your
[52:23] brother he's going to be fine amen and
[52:27] he was healed that
[52:29] moment that young man was healed of his
[52:32] cross eyes they went
[52:35] back well now God doesn't we always
[52:39] think well I've heard this saying before
[52:41] saying God doesn't do do things halfway
[52:44] God does things his way the young man
[52:47] his eyes weren't crossed anymore but he
[52:49] still wore
[52:50] glasses you know for for the rest of the
[52:53] time that he lived he ended up dying in
[52:54] a auto accident
[52:57] but he was healed right then and it was
[53:00] because of the
[53:03] burden of his brother my dad praying for
[53:07] him and just loving him and that's the
[53:10] burden brothers and sisters we think of
[53:11] that love we think of a little baby
[53:13] dying and what if it was my baby let me
[53:16] tell you something the father Our Father
[53:18] the one that brother Lyall recognized
[53:20] earlier and said Happy Father's Day He
[53:22] has more of a burden for us than we do
[53:25] for that baby maybe even if it's ours we
[53:29] don't understand how much God the Father
[53:31] how much his love is for us and we on
[53:36] Earth us men and you young men please
[53:40] listen to me
[53:42] closely we have a great
[53:46] responsibility in raising our
[53:49] children we
[53:51] represent the Father
[53:54] Figure to not only our children but our
[53:58] wives we must represent
[54:03] God in that same loving compassion that
[54:07] the same God that healed the young man
[54:08] of his
[54:09] eyes would be in
[54:13] us I read these statistics last year and
[54:17] I added a couple I think I'm going to
[54:18] read them again because Unfortunately
[54:19] they haven't
[54:22] changed Father's Day is the lowest
[54:25] attended church day of the year
[54:29] Mother's Day is the third highest next
[54:32] to Easter and
[54:34] Christmas um Sean McConnell director of
[54:37] LifeWay research says this clearly
[54:39] mothers want to be present for the
[54:41] affirmation that is typically offered in
[54:43] most churches but families also are
[54:45] present knowing their attendance will
[54:47] honor their mother the attendance
[54:49] difference between Mother's Day and
[54:51] Father's Day is telling either churches
[54:52] are less effective in affirming fathers
[54:55] or families believe Christ Christian
[54:56] fathers don't value their participation
[54:59] in worship
[55:02] services for new converts a survey found
[55:05] that if a child is the first person in
[55:07] the household to become a Christian
[55:09] there is a three and a half% probability
[55:12] that everyone else in the household will
[55:15] follow if the mother is the first to
[55:17] become a Christian there's a
[55:20] 177% probability that everyone in else
[55:23] in the household will follow however
[55:25] when the father is first there is a
[55:28] 93% possibility probability that
[55:31] everyone else in the household will
[55:33] father follow wow so if Dad gives his
[55:37] heart to the Lord Jesus look what
[55:40] happens to the family 177% for the
[55:43] mother
[55:44] 93% for the father a father who
[55:47] regularly attends service even if the
[55:49] mother does not 66% of the children will
[55:53] attend church when they become adults
[55:56] that's a good stat you're building
[56:00] something in your family when both
[56:02] parents attend church 75% of children
[56:06] will become regular worshiper
[56:07] worshippers so if Mom and Dad both are
[56:09] attending church 75% of our children
[56:13] will continue on after they are on their
[56:17] own what's the first thing I thought of
[56:19] when I read
[56:20] that what about the other
[56:24] 25% that's what made me feel that it's
[56:26] like wow that's supposed to be a good
[56:29] thing but we lost 25% even in the best
[56:33] best case
[56:34] scenario the following is true from a
[56:36] fatherless home
[56:38] 63% of suicides come from fatherless
[56:42] homes 71% of high school dropouts come
[56:45] from fatherless homes
[56:47] 75% of Youth in chemical abuse centers
[56:51] come from fatherless homes
[56:54] 80% of rapists
[56:56] come from fatherless homes
[56:59] 85% of all children with behavior
[57:02] disorders come from fatherless homes
[57:05] this one hits hard this next one because
[57:09] we see it a lot here 90% of homeless and
[57:12] runaway
[57:13] children come from fatherless
[57:16] homes I can say that I've seen that how
[57:19] many times have I witnessed to people in
[57:22] this neighborhood and homeless people
[57:23] all around and many of these homeless
[57:26] people I always say how did you get here
[57:29] and where is your family and many of
[57:31] them say well my mom is in prison or or
[57:34] yeah yeah my mom's worried about me or I
[57:35] talk with my mom but they almost never
[57:37] mention their dad it's because Dad's
[57:40] almost never
[57:42] there most of them that I talk to don't
[57:45] even know who don't even know their
[57:47] dad have no idea where he's
[57:49] at if you don't have a father in your
[57:52] life you are four times more likely to
[57:55] go into
[57:56] poverty you're twice as likely to suffer
[58:00] obesity girls are seven
[58:05] times seven times more likely to get
[58:09] pregnant out of
[58:11] woodlock as a te I'm sorry as a
[58:14] teen without a father in their
[58:20] home focus on the family I found this
[58:23] stat that positive father care this is
[58:27] this is in a book by Dr puit positive
[58:29] father care is associated with more
[58:32] pro-social and positive moral behavior
[58:34] in boys and
[58:36] girls this comes from research from the
[58:39] University of Pennsylvania which
[58:41] indicates that children who feel a
[58:43] closeness and warmth with their father
[58:45] are twice as likely to enter
[58:48] College
[58:51] 75% less likely to have children while
[58:54] they're in their teens as I just mened
[58:56] mentioned 80% less likely to be
[58:59] incarcerated and half is likely to show
[59:02] signs of
[59:03] depression just if there's a dad at
[59:08] home in the 26 year yearlong study
[59:11] researchers found that the number one
[59:13] factor in developing empathy in children
[59:16] was father involvement number
[59:18] one father spending regular time alone
[59:21] with their children translated into
[59:22] children who become more passionate
[59:24] adults
[59:28] James chapter 1: 27 says pure religion
[59:31] and undefiled before God and the father
[59:34] is this to visit the fatherless and
[59:37] widows in their Affliction and to keep
[59:39] himself unspotted from the world we all
[59:41] know we've heard about the widows and
[59:43] helping the widows but what about those
[59:46] that don't have a
[59:49] dad how much can we do for those
[59:53] people and how much would it help
[59:57] our congregation how much would it help
[59:59] the people that just are everywhere it
[1:00:02] doesn't say just a Christian here it
[1:00:05] says to visit these people to help
[1:00:08] them if you don't have children or if
[1:00:11] your children are
[1:00:15] older I'm sure that there are people
[1:00:18] that young people that could really use
[1:00:20] your
[1:00:23] wisdom and the fathers they're so
[1:00:27] influential because we are made in God's
[1:00:31] image so many of the attributes that we
[1:00:34] have they first started in heaven in God
[1:00:39] and then he passed them down to us we've
[1:00:41] all heard of the Redemptive names of
[1:00:44] Jehovah this is how there is redemption
[1:00:47] made this is how we are
[1:00:49] redeemed there are seven Redemptive
[1:00:51] names in the Old Testament the first one
[1:00:55] Jehovah righ the Lord is my shepherd
[1:00:57] you've heard Psalm 23 The Lord is my
[1:00:59] shepherd I shall not want Jehovah gyri
[1:01:02] the Lord is my provider Jehovah RI the
[1:01:04] Lord my healer Jehovah Shalom the Lord
[1:01:07] my
[1:01:08] peace I remember one time with with
[1:01:13] my um I was like 16 years old and and I
[1:01:17] let a friend drive my car and he he
[1:01:20] wrecked the front panel of it and man I
[1:01:22] loved my car I was devastated and I
[1:01:26] didn't know what to do I was a kid and I
[1:01:29] came home I was like Dad I just messed
[1:01:32] up I shouldn't have let him drive and
[1:01:33] and you know my dad did we didn't have
[1:01:35] the money really to to to have it done
[1:01:38] right to put it in a in a shop but me
[1:01:41] and my dad we unbolted the quarter panel
[1:01:44] of the car we bought a new panel we put
[1:01:48] it on there we had it sprayed and I my
[1:01:51] car wasn't wrecked anymore he gave me
[1:01:53] such peace I always knew Dad could
[1:01:54] handle it that I could take care of
[1:01:58] things Jehovah RI the Lord is my healer
[1:02:00] Jehovah Shalom the Lord my peace Jehovah
[1:02:04] n the Lord my banner Jehovah said kenu
[1:02:09] the Lord my righteousness and the one
[1:02:10] the last one I want to mention number
[1:02:13] seven is
[1:02:15] Jehovah
[1:02:17] shama the Lord is there for
[1:02:20] me how
[1:02:22] beautiful brother how many times has
[1:02:24] been there for us to in the past couple
[1:02:27] weeks we have sister Grace here the Lord
[1:02:29] took care of her she was she was in the
[1:02:31] hospital and we were praying for you the
[1:02:33] Lord took care of it the Lord was there
[1:02:36] for you he's there for me he's there for
[1:02:39] all of us and that is how a Dad should
[1:02:41] be amen we should always be there for
[1:02:45] our families we should always be there
[1:02:46] for our
[1:02:49] children remember brother Jordan and I
[1:02:52] were uh were talking with a brother um I
[1:02:55] think it was right Before Christmas out
[1:02:57] in the parking lot and he was talking
[1:03:01] about how all of these retired folks or
[1:03:04] or um folks that can't uh work anymore
[1:03:08] how that they don't have a relationship
[1:03:10] with their
[1:03:11] children and how their children don't
[1:03:14] help them like it used to be in previous
[1:03:16] generations where you would move your
[1:03:19] your family in and you'd all take care
[1:03:20] of each other and there was this great
[1:03:22] family bond but now we don't see anymore
[1:03:26] especially here in the United States and
[1:03:28] the brother was telling brother Jordan
[1:03:29] and I he said I we all think that it's
[1:03:32] because of this derel generation this
[1:03:35] disrespectful generation but the brother
[1:03:37] told us he says I don't think it's that
[1:03:39] way he said I think it's because the
[1:03:42] parents didn't give the kids enough time
[1:03:45] that they didn't invest in their
[1:03:49] families that they didn't give the kids
[1:03:52] the time that they needed
[1:03:57] if you
[1:03:58] remember from our Wednesday night bible
[1:04:00] study I'd like to turn in our Bibles to
[1:04:03] Deuteronomy chapter 6 I read it at the
[1:04:07] beginning in our Bible study we we as
[1:04:11] we've gone
[1:04:13] through and the next one in a few weeks
[1:04:15] will be Song of Solomon but when we got
[1:04:18] to Deuteronomy we learned
[1:04:21] that that book is a series of sermons by
[1:04:26] the prophet
[1:04:27] Moses and what it was is Moses was old
[1:04:30] everybody that was in that generation
[1:04:33] that came out of Egypt they had all
[1:04:35] passed away they had all died out in the
[1:04:37] wilderness when they were wandering
[1:04:38] around for 40 years and then Moses takes
[1:04:41] them right up to the edge of this
[1:04:44] promised land that was given to their
[1:04:45] ancestor Abraham and that had come all
[1:04:48] the way down and was given to them and
[1:04:50] it they were about to go over into this
[1:04:53] Promised Land This Modern Day Israel you
[1:04:56] hear the Palestinians talking about from
[1:04:58] The River To The
[1:05:00] Sea this is that land that God himself
[1:05:03] promised to the Jews and it goes way
[1:05:07] back Beyond 100
[1:05:10] years goes like 5,000 years
[1:05:15] ago and this land that was promised to
[1:05:18] them a land that was flowing with milk
[1:05:20] and honey they came here and now Moses
[1:05:22] is
[1:05:23] old Joshua was old there there there's
[1:05:27] just a couple in Caleb's old there's
[1:05:28] just a few left and they're about to go
[1:05:31] over into the promised land and Moses is
[1:05:35] getting from God this message to the
[1:05:40] people and what it is is it's a history
[1:05:42] of what has
[1:05:44] happened the book of Deuteronomy isn't
[1:05:47] necessarily anything new it was already
[1:05:50] chronicled in Exodus and
[1:05:53] numbers but Deuteronomy
[1:05:55] is saying God telling the people here's
[1:05:58] what
[1:06:02] happened and
[1:06:05] remember let's read chapter let's read
[1:06:07] verse one Deuteronomy 6 verse one now
[1:06:10] these are the Commandments the statutes
[1:06:12] and the judgments which the Lord your
[1:06:14] God commanded to teach you that you
[1:06:15] might do them in the land whether you go
[1:06:18] to possess it this is a father telling
[1:06:21] his
[1:06:22] children that listen you're about to get
[1:06:25] out on your own there's no more Mana
[1:06:27] going to fall there's no more water
[1:06:30] coming out of the rock there's no more
[1:06:32] quailes going through the camp you are
[1:06:34] going to be out out on your own there's
[1:06:36] no more food in the
[1:06:39] refrigerator if you don't pay the light
[1:06:41] bill it's going to get shut
[1:06:44] off now you're on your own son you're on
[1:06:48] your own
[1:06:49] daughter you're going to be going into
[1:06:52] this new
[1:06:53] land and he's preparing them for
[1:06:57] that and I also want to mention too I
[1:07:01] told a testimony earlier a couple
[1:07:05] testimonies I want to point out very
[1:07:08] plainly that these people in
[1:07:11] Deuteronomy that none of them witnessed
[1:07:15] what I'm about to read except for Moses
[1:07:19] Joshua
[1:07:21] Caleb it's just amazing what he says
[1:07:29] verse number one again now these are the
[1:07:31] Commandments and the statutes and the
[1:07:32] judgments which your lord God commanded
[1:07:34] to teach you that you might do them in
[1:07:36] the land whether you go to possess
[1:07:42] it he promised many things brothers and
[1:07:46] sisters and and what did what had
[1:07:49] happened is the people had chosen sister
[1:07:52] Shirley I believe it as you and I that
[1:07:53] were talking about this the people had
[1:07:55] chosen they got afraid when God started
[1:07:57] to speak on the mountain and the people
[1:07:59] had chosen that no we're afraid for God
[1:08:02] to speak we want Moses to speak instead
[1:08:08] of God because if God is speaking we're
[1:08:11] going to die because they saw all these
[1:08:13] problems in their lives so we would
[1:08:15] rather have Moses
[1:08:18] speak imagine if you're a father imagine
[1:08:21] how that would make you feel if your
[1:08:23] kids would say no um
[1:08:27] actually you live to half of a life for
[1:08:29] me dad so I'd rather just have someone
[1:08:33] else speak for you imagine how that
[1:08:35] would feel you think God doesn't have
[1:08:39] feelings that's what they said so
[1:08:43] here we see that that the people had
[1:08:47] chosen for a man to speak to them
[1:08:48] instead of God and then we go all the
[1:08:50] way to the New Testament in the book of
[1:08:52] Hebrews and we can see why it was so
[1:08:55] great great that Paul or whoever the
[1:08:58] author was writing to the Hebrew
[1:08:59] audience he said in Hebrews chapter 1 he
[1:09:02] said God who had Sund Dr times and in
[1:09:04] diverse manners God who in old times and
[1:09:07] in many ways spoke in time past by the
[1:09:11] prophets because you chose
[1:09:14] it he spoken time past by the prophets
[1:09:17] hath in these last days spoken by his
[1:09:21] son so now God gave us another
[1:09:25] opportunity to hear him speak
[1:09:30] himself directly to
[1:09:34] us through the Holy Spirit and through
[1:09:37] his son Jesus Christ what a great
[1:09:42] honor it doesn't take prophets out of
[1:09:44] the picture by no means god uses
[1:09:47] prophets God uses prophets to bring a
[1:09:49] message to to to bring warning to the
[1:09:51] people he he uses ministers he uses
[1:09:55] churches he uses Apostles he uses these
[1:09:58] things but now because of Jesus Christ
[1:10:01] we don't understand how great it is that
[1:10:04] we can have a relationship now with God
[1:10:07] that we couldn't have had before and now
[1:10:09] we get to talk to the father
[1:10:12] ourselves and it doesn't have to go
[1:10:14] through a high priest it doesn't have to
[1:10:15] go through anyone else I can get on my
[1:10:18] knees and I can cry out to God the
[1:10:21] father and he will hear me it doesn't
[1:10:24] need an Aton I don't have to go to the
[1:10:26] high priest and have him kill a goat for
[1:10:28] me now I can talk to him and say Lord
[1:10:33] I'm pourn out my life to you I need
[1:10:35] help and because of Jesus
[1:10:39] Christ that
[1:10:41] atonement we can talk to him directly
[1:10:44] brothers and sisters one of the it's one
[1:10:45] of the greatest scriptures I know in the
[1:10:47] entire Bible Hebrews chapter 1 God who
[1:10:50] had Sun drry Times and divers manner
[1:10:52] spaking times passed by the prophets
[1:10:54] asked in this last day by his
[1:10:57] son it's wonderful I get to talk to God
[1:11:01] can you imagine can you imagine actually
[1:11:04] talking to God
[1:11:06] himself and then having him talk
[1:11:10] back oh I I just it's beyond even
[1:11:14] thinking that the Father the the Creator
[1:11:17] the Eternal God that we can get down and
[1:11:20] we can actually have a conversation with
[1:11:22] him the apost the the the author of
[1:11:25] Hebrews said
[1:11:27] it that's why he died on the cross
[1:11:30] that's why we had the sacrificial lamb
[1:11:33] or the whatever it sacrificial lamb in
[1:11:35] the Garden of Eden and then with Abel
[1:11:38] they sacrificed animals and all of this
[1:11:41] came all the way down to Jesus Christ
[1:11:43] and he was the perfect sacrifice and now
[1:11:46] we can have a relationship with him it's
[1:11:48] everything I don't think we even
[1:11:50] understand how great how great this
[1:11:52] cross
[1:11:54] is like light's not
[1:12:01] on it's not plugged
[1:12:04] in he didn't have a light on his cross
[1:12:06] either he was the
[1:12:08] light he was the shikina glory he was he
[1:12:12] was he was
[1:12:15] everything and because of him we can
[1:12:19] speak to the father brothers and
[1:12:21] sisters it's all about Christ
[1:12:27] sir I
[1:12:30] better get going haven't even got to my
[1:12:32] scriptures
[1:12:40] yet let's go back to um Deuteronomy
[1:12:47] 6 that thou mayest fear the lord thy God
[1:12:52] and keep all his statutes and all his
[1:12:53] Commandments which I commanded thee thou
[1:12:56] and thy son and thy son's son all the
[1:12:58] days of thy life that thy days may be
[1:13:02] prolonged he's saying that pass this on
[1:13:04] to our children and our children's
[1:13:07] children and you will benefit from it
[1:13:10] I'm not just talking about
[1:13:13] spiritually you'll benefit from this
[1:13:16] life here therefore Israel and observe
[1:13:18] to do it that it may be well with
[1:13:22] thee that thou may increase mightily as
[1:13:25] the Lord go Lord God of thy fathers hath
[1:13:28] promised thee in the land flowing with
[1:13:30] milk and honey he's saying there that if
[1:13:32] you keep the Commandments of God when
[1:13:34] you have a family when you're on your
[1:13:37] own whatever it might be then you will
[1:13:42] prosper Jesus said that if you prefer
[1:13:45] your brother over yourself he told he
[1:13:49] told us to do that Jesus said to serve
[1:13:52] others Jesus said when someone says
[1:13:55] something against you to forgive them
[1:13:58] Jesus told these things and if we would
[1:14:00] really apply those you young people
[1:14:03] looking for
[1:14:04] careers if we would really apply that to
[1:14:07] our lives people would want to hire
[1:14:11] us we'll be a better
[1:14:14] employee am I right brother Tony the
[1:14:17] people we work with there's people that
[1:14:20] you like to work
[1:14:21] with it's because they're not always
[1:14:23] serving themselves they're not all about
[1:14:25] themselves they're not selfish people
[1:14:27] and those are the people that
[1:14:29] Prosper this is just Basics right here
[1:14:32] this is going to help you whether you're
[1:14:34] a Christian or not if you live this
[1:14:36] Christian life you are going to do
[1:14:44] better and when we give this time when
[1:14:49] we study but the line the time that we
[1:14:52] spend in in reading our Bibles the the
[1:14:55] time that we
[1:14:56] study the time in in
[1:14:59] prayer that's an
[1:15:02] investment it's an investment in our
[1:15:04] careers it's an investment more
[1:15:05] importantly in our families in our
[1:15:08] children Proverbs 13:22 says a a good
[1:15:12] man leaves an inheritance to his
[1:15:14] children's
[1:15:17] children it's
[1:15:19] amazing that I can leave an inheritance
[1:15:22] not only to Daniel and meline but I can
[1:15:25] leave an inheritance to my grandchildren
[1:15:27] and you know what I want my inheritance
[1:15:28] to be yeah I would like to leave them
[1:15:30] something monetarily but I want to leave
[1:15:32] them that my
[1:15:34] dad loved the Lord and he taught me to
[1:15:37] love the Lord he taught me a good work
[1:15:39] ethic he taught me to
[1:15:42] respect he taught me to to to respect
[1:15:46] others to to to be
[1:15:49] successful and then I want to teach it
[1:15:51] to my son my daughter and I want them to
[1:15:54] teach that that is the inheritance
[1:15:57] that's the greatest
[1:15:59] inheritance that they might receive the
[1:16:02] same holy spirit that I
[1:16:04] have that they might receive they might
[1:16:06] have the same love for Jesus Christ that
[1:16:08] I have that's the inheritance I want to
[1:16:10] leave for my
[1:16:13] children verse number four we read it at
[1:16:15] the
[1:16:16] beginning here o Israel the Lord our God
[1:16:19] is
[1:16:22] one brothers and sisters that's why
[1:16:24] baptism
[1:16:29] it's it's important that we
[1:16:33] recognize God in all things and we talk
[1:16:37] about being baptized and there's of
[1:16:39] often the question why would I want to
[1:16:41] be
[1:16:42] baptized if God has done something for
[1:16:46] you and you see I have my salvation but
[1:16:49] there's something else above your
[1:16:52] salvation now that you you have your
[1:16:54] salvation
[1:16:55] there's a Thanksgiving that you give to
[1:16:57] God and you want to go into the Waters
[1:16:59] of baptism and say Lord now you have
[1:17:02] done this for me now here I stand in
[1:17:04] this pool of water and I am taking on
[1:17:07] the name of
[1:17:11] Christ to where I can be a
[1:17:14] Christian so
[1:17:16] often we see
[1:17:19] baptism in the names of the fathers the
[1:17:22] father and the Son and the Holy Spirit
[1:17:23] there's not a name associated with that
[1:17:26] and it's so easy when we are baptized in
[1:17:29] that way to be baptized into a church or
[1:17:33] into a denomination because there's no
[1:17:35] name associated with it now I am
[1:17:38] baptized into this church yeah I started
[1:17:41] attending that church and I got baptized
[1:17:43] now I'm part of that church no that is
[1:17:45] why it's so wrong you have to be you
[1:17:47] have to take on a name there's no name
[1:17:51] in those baptisms but I want to be
[1:17:53] associated with Christ I am a Christian
[1:17:56] I want Christ associated with my name
[1:17:59] therefore I am baptized in the name of
[1:18:02] Jesus Christ and you can go to this
[1:18:04] church or that church or wherever it
[1:18:06] doesn't matter but what matters is that
[1:18:08] you have accepted Christ it is vitally
[1:18:11] important to set your name with his
[1:18:18] name otherwise it just doesn't mean as
[1:18:21] much I believe it it means something it
[1:18:23] means that there's a burden there to be
[1:18:26] baptized but when you're actually
[1:18:28] getting up in the water and saying I am
[1:18:31] taking on the name of Jesus Christ there
[1:18:34] is a change in my life now I want to
[1:18:36] change and I am showing all of the
[1:18:38] people here present that I take on the
[1:18:41] name of Christ I'm a different
[1:18:44] person not in titles not to a church but
[1:18:49] to the one true God
[1:18:55] where was I he what
[1:18:58] verse five okay and thou shalt love the
[1:19:02] Lord thy God with all thine heart with
[1:19:04] all thy soul and with all thy might
[1:19:07] Jesus himself quoted this scripture as
[1:19:09] being the greatest
[1:19:13] commandment I'll break it down and then
[1:19:16] I'll just stop when I run out of
[1:19:18] time love him with all your heart the
[1:19:21] Bible seems many times it's strange it
[1:19:24] it
[1:19:25] interchanges mind and heart it seems
[1:19:29] like when there's something that means a
[1:19:31] little bit more when there's a deeper
[1:19:34] understanding when there's a deeper
[1:19:35] meaning that the Bible says heart
[1:19:37] Proverbs says as a man thinks in his
[1:19:41] heart so is he so your thoughts and my
[1:19:45] thoughts brothers and sisters they
[1:19:47] Define us remember when I was
[1:19:50] walking I was all these problems were
[1:19:53] going through my mind and and I was I I
[1:19:55] was struggling that defines who I
[1:19:58] am I don't want that to Define me I want
[1:20:01] the spirit of Christ to Define me I want
[1:20:04] it in my heart I want those things to
[1:20:06] come
[1:20:07] out love him with all your
[1:20:10] heart and with all your
[1:20:12] soul our soul is
[1:20:15] eternal it came from God and it goes to
[1:20:19] God the father's telling us to love him
[1:20:22] with a deeper love an eternal love but
[1:20:24] between the father and his child if
[1:20:26] we're going to be eternally with God in
[1:20:28] heaven then we need to have that
[1:20:32] love deep in our souls that Eternal
[1:20:35] agape love and with all your might so
[1:20:38] with all
[1:20:40] of your heart with all of your soul and
[1:20:43] now we have something to
[1:20:46] do we have to put it into
[1:20:48] action this is an action here with all
[1:20:51] of your might as I was talking about
[1:20:56] to be baptized that's something that's
[1:21:00] important and to the men if we love the
[1:21:03] Lord with all of our hearts and with all
[1:21:05] of our minds and all of our souls then
[1:21:07] we need to represent the Lord to our
[1:21:10] children to our
[1:21:12] families and teach them about these
[1:21:15] things as as the Lord commanded here in
[1:21:18] Deuteronomy remember when Daniel and
[1:21:20] meline when they're babies when they're
[1:21:22] little
[1:21:25] the best time of the day really for our
[1:21:27] family was bedtime how many can say
[1:21:30] that we would sit there and and the kids
[1:21:35] would would be excited and and I'd have
[1:21:37] the Bible book you know the little kids
[1:21:39] Bible book and I'd sit down and and my
[1:21:41] babies would sit next to me and we'd
[1:21:43] open it up and we would read just
[1:21:46] chapter after chapter I'm talking about
[1:21:48] the little picture Bibles you know with
[1:21:50] with the the short words and they tell
[1:21:52] little stories and here I am reading in
[1:21:54] the kids are just locked on and they
[1:21:57] just they just loved it it was so it was
[1:21:59] just such a good thing and let me tell
[1:22:01] you something I didn't go to Seminary
[1:22:03] school I'll tell you my
[1:22:05] secret that's how I learned the Bible I
[1:22:09] learned it very well in those little
[1:22:11] bible stories and then I would go and
[1:22:13] and read them in the big
[1:22:15] book The Mom and Daddy
[1:22:18] book but the little one we would we
[1:22:22] would be I'd be I'd be telling them
[1:22:24] those stories and they were just locked
[1:22:26] on one after the other building this
[1:22:28] Foundation of my children and then I
[1:22:31] remember with u with meline I'd let the
[1:22:33] kids watch some DVDs like some Christian
[1:22:35] DVDs and and meline would always say
[1:22:39] Daddy um daddy I gotta go potty pause
[1:22:46] it and I'd be like no we'll just said no
[1:22:48] Daddy no Daddy just pause
[1:22:51] it okay so she'd go and come back and
[1:22:55] jump back on me and I'm I'm I'm reading
[1:22:58] and then I'd always do the same thing
[1:23:00] buddy do you remember when I would close
[1:23:02] the Bible I would get to the end of a
[1:23:06] story and I would take the little Bible
[1:23:10] book and I would
[1:23:12] do that and those little guys were so
[1:23:17] fast inevitably and meline was faster
[1:23:20] than Daniel inevitably I would be in the
[1:23:23] process slow motion of closing that book
[1:23:26] I was going full speed and my little
[1:23:28] girl could slip her hand in there and
[1:23:31] stop the closing of the
[1:23:34] Bible and she just one more Daddy just a
[1:23:37] little bit more building brothers and
[1:23:40] sisters building that
[1:23:41] relationship with with my
[1:23:44] family I
[1:23:46] have I'll um I'll finish with my notes I
[1:23:49] got halfway through that's good enough
[1:23:52] um but with brothers and sisters with
[1:23:56] raising our children we have to be that
[1:24:00] Dad to our
[1:24:02] sons like my dad was to me and teaching
[1:24:05] me how to drive the heavy equipment and
[1:24:07] having how to fix a car and talking
[1:24:09] about the Lord and sharing these
[1:24:12] testimonies with me and then and then
[1:24:14] even to the right before dad passed
[1:24:17] away he just loved me coming
[1:24:21] over and he'd always say bud I I heard
[1:24:23] this you know the Bible says what what
[1:24:26] does this
[1:24:27] mean and we would just
[1:24:29] talk about the Lord and and talk about
[1:24:32] the the meaning of the
[1:24:35] word and then I pass that I want to pass
[1:24:37] that on I hope I passed it on to my son
[1:24:40] and in in putting the word first and and
[1:24:43] him loving the word like he does and
[1:24:46] look at my son and
[1:24:47] how we're together every day we talk
[1:24:50] every day we love each other it's
[1:24:53] because he trusts me
[1:24:55] and I trust him and our daughters we
[1:24:58] don't want to ever forget our
[1:25:00] daughters Brothers let me tell you
[1:25:02] this if you are not that
[1:25:07] manly fatherly figure to your daughter
[1:25:11] she will find someone else that
[1:25:14] is and you won't want
[1:25:17] that it'll be bad for
[1:25:20] her and it just cause her problems over
[1:25:22] the years love your daughters when my
[1:25:26] daughter she one time she was teenagers
[1:25:29] they all go through they lose their
[1:25:30] minds from age 14 to about age 21 there
[1:25:36] but to have a parent that loves them
[1:25:38] there and takes care of them in that
[1:25:40] time and when my daughter she was going
[1:25:42] through a hard time and and she had lost
[1:25:45] her mind and she
[1:25:50] was I had a full head of hair
[1:25:56] before my before my daughter was a
[1:26:00] teenager not really um but I did age
[1:26:04] quite a bit
[1:26:07] but she trusted
[1:26:09] me and when she needed dad to lay down
[1:26:13] the law I
[1:26:15] did and she trusted me and she loved me
[1:26:18] but I saw that I need to replace place I
[1:26:24] need to be that person that she is
[1:26:27] needing right now so my daughter and I
[1:26:30] every few weeks we set a date that we
[1:26:33] would go out to dinner just her and
[1:26:35] me and just have that
[1:26:38] fellowship with a father and a daughter
[1:26:41] and she would tell me things and and we
[1:26:43] would talk and and and we we would dress
[1:26:46] up and we'd go out to a nice restaurant
[1:26:48] and she'd always pick she'd be like
[1:26:49] Daddy I want to go to to this place this
[1:26:52] time and and that place and it was
[1:26:53] something that we both just really
[1:26:55] looked forward to but I had to take the
[1:26:57] time to do
[1:26:59] it dads I don't care if you're 80 years
[1:27:04] old if you have children take the time
[1:27:07] now to spend with
[1:27:09] them they may be 50 years old but it's
[1:27:13] time you can do more spend time with
[1:27:17] your kids and then you'll find that that
[1:27:19] Legacy starts trickling down to your
[1:27:21] grandkids and your great grandkids it's
[1:27:24] worth our
[1:27:27] time be a good
[1:27:29] dad set a good
[1:27:32] example be that
[1:27:35] representation of the father to your
[1:27:38] children and to your
[1:27:41] spouse and let me tell you it's an
[1:27:42] investment the Bible says very plainly
[1:27:45] so that things will be
[1:27:48] good and they will be good your kids
[1:27:51] will do better financially your kids
[1:27:53] will do better
[1:27:55] relationship wise everything will be
[1:27:58] better and it's never too late I promise
[1:28:01] you the musicians would
[1:28:05] come I didn't uh I didn't get through my
[1:28:08] notes but it's on my heart I want to
[1:28:10] read one
[1:28:12] scripture um it's in first
[1:28:14] John chapter 2 I believe
[1:28:33] I think it's in first it
[1:28:38] is first John chapter 2 and and this as
[1:28:42] I was ministering this just
[1:28:45] came it came to my my
[1:28:49] mind and it's really a message from a
[1:28:52] father now John was probably he's
[1:28:55] writing to these disciples that he led
[1:28:57] them to the Lord and he was a father
[1:28:58] figure to
[1:28:59] them but listen to these beautiful
[1:29:04] words he says this I write unto you
[1:29:09] little
[1:29:10] children because your sins are forgiven
[1:29:12] you for his name's

[1:31:35] would have done more I wish I would
[1:31:39] have spent more

[1:31:47] spend God honored it it's that every
[1:31:50] night devotions with my
[1:31:52] kids it's that that time that I spent
[1:31:55] taking them on vacation it's that time
[1:31:58] that that we spent just being a family
[1:32:03] making my poor daughter go for a walk
[1:32:05] and she hated
[1:32:07] it she
[1:32:11] complained but she doesn't complain
[1:32:14] anymore she loves her
[1:32:17] daddy and I thank
[1:32:20] God that she saw something in
[1:32:25] me and then she chose a

[1:37:10] I told of brother brandom and that
[1:37:12] little child and how he was suffering
[1:37:14] and how that burden for that baby that

[1:37:21] without being healed let me tell you
[1:37:24] Jesus Christ has even more of a burden
[1:37:27] for this little
[1:37:30] baby than brother brandom did for his
[1:37:32] little girl that was dying and we can
[1:37:35] claim it in Jesus
