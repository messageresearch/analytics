forth and up and down and it made it like all the other ones it's amazing how God designs exactly the plant exactly for the environment that it's in as um I do I do appreciate you all appreciate I was really thinking about everyone on my trip and and want to get back home and and when you when you're away from our family boy I'll tell you you don't know how much strength that we draw from each other I just I was thinking about you all all the time and I was thinking about just the church and how the Lord has blessed us and as I I said in my WhatsApp broadcast this morning about First Corinthian 1 Corinthians 13 and we can have all the revelations all we can explain all of these things and Paul said even that I I would have faith to move mountains I mean how much Faith do we have but he said even Faith to move mountains and all the revelations and we think about all these Revelations that have been revealed in this day from the the Seven Seals and and and the ages and and the Thunders and all of these things Paul said uh I'll take love over all of it and that's what it is friends it's it's love it's the most important thing in the world the Apostle John said made these three words he said God is loved how beautiful how beautiful is the love that he loved us so much that he gave his only son how many of us would do that what he did he gave him for our well-being so that we might have an eternity with our with our Lord this book of Acts I I wanted to give just a a brief overview of the whole thing so what we're going to do is tonight I'm going to go through the first half just hit some of the highlights and then next week brother Lyle will go through the second half the first half of the book is mainly the Apostle Peter and his ministry then it's with switches to the Apostle Paul and he goes forward and preaching the gospel we know that the book of Acts was written by Luke this wonderful man very talented and he used his talents to serve the Lord so let's let's start in Acts 1:1 and it reads like this the former treaties have I made o theopolis all of that Jesus began both to do and to teach that word treaties it's a book or it's a letter it's a document so what Luke is saying is he's saying this letter that I wrote to you before I was talking about what Jesus began to do so let's make sure we we are right with the author of this book so let's go to Luke 1 and let's see what the author of Acts was talking about Luke 1:1 he says this for as much as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us even as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and Ministers of the word you can tell that our friend Luke is also very intellectual brother it's seemed good to me also having had a perfect understanding of all things from the very first to write unto thee in order most excellent theopolis that thou mightest know the certainty of those things wherein thou Hast been instructed let me read that keep the King James version up there let's go back to verse three and let me read that in the English Standard Version it says this it seemed good to me also having followed all things closely for for some time past to write an orderly account for you oh most excellent theopolis that you may have certainty concerning the things that you have been taught so this man theopolis theopolis first of all it means lover of God so this man had a desire to understand who this man Jesus was was and what all of this new movement of Christianity was about he had a desire to see these things it struck his heart so he either hired Luke or or he asked Luke to give him a report so Luke sends him a report the first report which is the Book of Luke so then Luke sends him the second report and it is this book of Acts again I'll read the book of Acts chapter one again the former treaties have I made o theopolis of all that Jesus began to do and to teach all the all the translations that you read of that scripture say the same thing that Jesus began to do it doesn't say that he did it says that he began to do so this document that Luke sent to theopolis this book of Acts he's saying that this life of Christ that this is what he began to do but hey theopolis there's more to this whole story sending them this letter he's saying hey it was it didn't end when he rose from the dead and went up to the to the father he said now it's continuing on in these people called his disciples so this whole book of Acts is that Luke saying hey the there's more to the gospel verse two until the day in which he was taking up taken up after that he through the Holy Ghost had given Commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen now he's talking about his previous book here he's talking about the resurrection story in the Book of Luke each Gospel Matthew Mark Luke and John they all give a different account of Jesus's life Matthew Mark and John probably all maybe knew Jesus Matthew for sure and John for sure Mark most likely Luke all of his was research interviewing people like Peter people like James doing his research on this but they all tell the same story the gospels from different perspectives to whom also he showed himself a alive after his Passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them 40 days and speaking of things pertaining to the kingdom of God and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which sayith he this is Jesus talking now which have which ye have heard of me for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence a tremendous prophecy and Promise by the Lord Jesus this is foreshadowing by the author Luke he's reminding the reader that Jesus made this promise before he ascended up to the father and this is going to come true but you got to keep reading my book theopolis you got to keep going because it's just going to get better and better when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying Lord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the time or the season which the father hath put in his power but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they steadfastly looked toward Heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said ye men of Galilee why stand ye up gazing into heaven this same Jesus which is taking taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as he as you have seen him go into heaven so the theme or the outline for this entire book of Acts right there is acts 1 ver8 but ye shall receive power this is a promise from the Lord Jesus but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all of Judea and in Samaria and to the uttermost part of the earth now the Fulfillment of that prophecy was probably aside from the resurrection of Christ it was probably the greatest day in the history of the world was the Fulfillment of that prophecy that Jesus just said that you will be endued with power from on high so let's go to Acts chapter 2 verse one and let's read about what happened now remember Jesus died was resurrected went up to heaven made this promise that hey you are going to receive this power but just wait until that happens he said go to Jerusalem and just wait for this to happen and here it is it's called the day of Pentecost and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly they CA there came a sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance now this Pillar of Fire that came down these tongues of fire this isn't the first time that this has happened do you remember with Moses in the wilderness you remember the pillar of fire in the burning bush remember the pillar of Fire by night and the pillar of cloud by day do you remember when when when Solomon built the temple that the pillar of fire came down and filled the temple now that same Pillar of Fire that filled that Temple now filled this Temple right here the Temple of Flesh 120 of them in the upper room and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with tongues as the spirit gave them utterance so they walked into this Upper Room you remember what was happening they had just killed Jesus they were afraid they were scared to death they were hiding from the Romans and they were hiding from the Jews they and they went up into this Upper Room 12 of them and they were staying there they were waiting for this promise they had no idea what it was going to be but they were waiting for this promise to come and here remember acts: 18 says Jesus promised that you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and then you shall be witness to me in both Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria and to the uttermost parts of the earth so then this happen so they're in the they're in in this upper room and they're praying and and and doing what they were doing they were waiting for this promise to come to pass it was like 10 days that they were up there and then they see these pillars of fire they look like tongues of fire over their heads and then they started speaking in unknown tongues and these these other languages so they they go up from the room now they weren't afraid anymore these people were about to kill them and they're up there hiding out now they run downstairs and they start preaching the gospel and they're so filled with this spirit that they're just they're they're they're swaying and they're they're speaking in these different not unknown tongues that we think of tongues they're speaking in other languages it might be Spanish it might be French it might be it might be Swahili it it's whatever language that the people that were listening to them spoke is the language that they were speaking to these people they were doing it to preach the gospel to them the Gospel of Jesus Christ coming right out of this room this a never happened before so now we get to hear the very first sermon by the very first holy spirit filled Christian and I just I just want to read it verbatim because it is beautiful so right after they had received the Holy Spirit the very first Holy Spirit-filled Christians they go down and this man Peter who Jesus said you have the key keys to the kingdom this man Peter preaches the very first sermon by a holy spirit filled Christian brother but Peter standing up with the 11 verse 14 but Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them you men of Judea and all that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken unto my words listen to me for these not are Dr for these are not drunken as you suppose theing is but but the third hour of the day it was only 9:00 in the morning and they're out there swaying in the power of the Holy Spirit but this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel now Peter quotes the book of The Book of Joel and he says and it shall come to pass in the last days saith God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my handmaidens that says right there that a man and a woman can receive the Holy Spirit right here I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and I will show wonders in Heaven above and in signs beneath blood and fire and Vapor of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into the blood for the great and notable day of the Lord come before the great and notable day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved I wonder what they were thinking all right Peter what are you talking about the name of the Lord ye men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by Miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you as ye yourselves also know him being delivered by the determinant counsel and forn knowledge of God ye have taken and by Wicked hands have crucified and slain whom God ha raised up having loose the Pains of death because it was not possible that he should be Holden of it for David speaking concerning him I foresaw the lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that I should not be moved he's quoting the prophet David therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover also my flesh shall Rest In Hope because thou Wilt not leave my soul in Hell neither wilt thou s suffer thy Holy One to see corruption thou Hast made known to me the ways of life that thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance now what is Peter doing he's taking the prophet David's words and applying them to Christ a true minister of the Gospel a true preacher men and Brethren let me Fe freely speak unto you of the patriarch David that he is both dead and buried and his supplier is with us unto this day back to verse 27 because thou wi not leave my soul in Hell neither shall neither shalt thou make I'm sorry neither wilt thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption and he's like hey he wasn't talking about himself David wasn't he was talking about someone else therefore being a prophet and knowing speaking of David therefore being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ that his soul was not left in Hell neither his neither his flesh did see corruption when when he's talking about the that corruption he's talking about the body rotting and and it was it was thought and taught that the body starts to to rot after three days and that's that's what he's talking about right here and that his flesh did not see corruption this Jesus hath God God raised up wherewith we are all Witnesses therefore being by the right hand of God exalted and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost he ha shed forth this which ye now see and hear for David is not ascended into Heavens into the heavens David didn't fulfill these prophecies but he saith himself the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou on my right hand until I make thy full thy foot Thy Thy foes thy foot stols therefore let the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made the same Jesus remember who he's talking to this is all about Jews by the way until we get to the seventh chapter this is all about Jerusalem really until we get to the seventh chapter so he's saying this he's saying that know assuredly that God had made the same Jesus who you all crucified both Lord and Christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their they were cut in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do this condemned them there was some truth in these people that Peter was speaking to Peter said unto them repent and be B baptize every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost if you do this you'll receive the same thing that we just received in the upper room for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call all of us even even the ones that have been recently baptized and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourself from this unto UNT generation this crooked generation then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day were added unto them about 3,000 souls and they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship and in Breaking of bread and in prayers and fear Came Upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles very very important scripture right there and Many Wonders and signs were done by these Apostles exactly had Jesus as Jesus had done they preached like Jesus and they did Miracles like Jesus had done this right here what I just read those 3,000 those 120 in the upper room right there we see the birth of the Christian Church the birth of every church that any of us have ever been to Christian Church it was born right there and we look we've learned through our book of Acts that it's commonly called it's written in our Bibles not in the scripture but it's written in the title that these are the Acts of the Apostles we know that that's not a proper name for it it's the acts of the Holy Spirit in the apostles it's the acts of Jesus Christ in the apostles so if you have the spirit of Christ in you if I have the spirit of Christ in you in me then I'm going to do the same thing that Jesus did and you'll see this book of Acts these disciples are just doing the same thing that Jesus did it's a continuation of the Gospel of what Jesus did now they're just going to do the same thing but also and this is the sad part this is what not many people talk about but the same spirit that crucified Jesus that said hey you were eating eating wheat on the Sabbath you were out in the fields on the Sabbath The Same Spirit that crucified Jesus because he didn't teach like them because he didn't act like them because he didn't teach the same God goel of them because he didn't respect they thought the law of Moses that same Spirit didn't die with the ones that crucified Jesus it continued on just as the Holy Spirit continued on with the disciples we'll see that wherever There's a Hero there's always a villain you can't have a hero without a villain and we see see that that same spirit is going to rise up and say the same things and do the same things so then we go to the the next chapter in Acts chapter 3 and we see that okay they've they've been preaching and they've been they've been witnessing and and the power of the Holy Spirit came down and here we go with two of the disciples two of the most well-known disciples Peter and John John was the one that laid his head on Jesus's bosom Peter is the one that's spoken of throughout all of the gospels and all that Peter did so we have Peter and John now filled with the Holy Spirit they're walking up to the temple they go to the gate of the temple and here is a man is laying at the temple at the Temple Gate deformed from birth born crippled couldn't make a living couldn't couldn't do anything that most people can do and there he is laying there and he's he's he's laying there and he's probably got this cup out and he's asking for a handout a donation that's how he made his living and and everybody had seen him there every day that's where he was that's where he he got his money to go buy food so he's laying there Here Come Peter and John and Peter looks down at him and he looks up at Peter and he asks him will you give me a donation will you give me some help Peter looks down at him and he says this he says Silver and Gold Have I None I don't have any money to give you he tells the man he says look look up here look at us he looks down he says Silver and Gold Have I None but what I have what does he have he has the Holy Spirit he has the same spirit that Jesus Christ had in had in him now it's in this man Peter now it's in this man John and what's he GNA do do you remember the pool of Bethesda the pool of Bethesda Jesus comes up there's a man laying there that he couldn't there was something wrong with him he couldn't get up he couldn't get over to the pool there was a tradition that the angel would come to the pool and churn churn up the water and if you could get into that pool then you would be healed of whatever sickness so Jesus comes to him and he says hey why don't you get into the pool and he says people I'm crippled I can't people will just cut me off and people will get in front of me and I can't get in there so so Jesus looks down at him and he heals him so now we have the same spirit that is in John and in Peter and here's a crippled man I wonder if they remembered what Jesus had done Peter says Silver and Gold Have I None but what I have I give to you in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk and the man he didn't just stand up he leapt up he jumped up and received the strength in his ankles and his feet and everyone all of these people knew this man and they saw that he had been healed and what did they do they hated them for it just as they hated Jesus for when he did it what did they say to Jesus he healed them on the Sabbath give me a break you healed them on the Sabbath that's the best that they could come up with let me see if it had been me I'd probably said well let me see you do it but no Jesus Jesus had his he was God and he's the spirit that we want he didn't he didn't say like I would have said but he just went on and here comes Peter and John and they do the same thing at the gate called Beautiful exactly as I said what Jesus had done so then everybody sees this happen then Peter preaches another sermon it's the same thing it's this Jesus is the Fulfillment of all of the prophets chapter 4 after this man had been healed at the gate it's called the the gate called Beautiful which is the gate to the temple the priests of the temple and the Sadducees Came Upon them and and being grieved they taught the people and preached that Jesus that through Jesus the resurrection from the dead do you remember the difference between the Pharisees and the Sadducees from weeks ago the Sadducees they were the pompous stuck up priests and they were they had their perfect clothes and they had their shoes and they had whatever they wore on their heads and they were the temple wor the temple workers and they did not believe in miracles they didn't believe in many many things in fact they pretty much just only believed what Moses said they were pompous we're too good for even other prophets we just believe Moses he's good enough for us that's that's all we're we're better he's the best of all them so we're just going to stick to him and another thing they didn't believe very important they didn't believe in a resurrection from the dead so when Peter is preaching he's saying that by this man Jesus we were able to raise this man up to this crippled man and they knew that Jesus had died they saw him die on the cross so now they see Jesus that he's saying that Jesus is the one that able is able to do this and he rose from the dead and this these people have to be false because they're saying that it's a resurrection and our beliefs and our Creeds and our doctrines and our dogmas and everything else do not believe in a resurrection so they must be false didn't care that the man was just healed they must be false because it doesn't match our Doctrine those Spirits don't die they were there when Jesus was here they're there in the book of Acts and they're here today just because you don't match my Doctrine you must be false so these Sadducees are the first ones that come against come against Peter and James and John and all of this and when the disciples aren't preaching their Doctrine they're immediately immediately come after them we don't obviously you can't kill somebody today you can hate them and Jesus tells us he said if you hate somebody without a cause he's speaking maybe thousands of years later for today then you have murdered that person it was what Jesus said he said if you just want to have an affair in your wife if you just want to be with another woman that's not your wife he says you've already committed adultery he says if you hate a Man Without a Cause if you hate him then you have committed murder you have murdered that man that's today obviously people aren't going to murder like the Sadducees did here but they will attack someone's character that's what Spirit do we have all of us do we have the spirit of Christ the spirit of love that we are the ones Healing The Sick preaching love preaching Christ or does the spirit of legalism where we condemn anyone who doesn't have the same doctrines of us or hold the same values of us what Spirit do we have and they laid hands on them and put them in hold until the next day for it was now even tide how be it many of them which heard the word believed and the number of the men was about 5,000 boy I would love to see a a Revival like that boy I mean I think I do really good to get one person to come to church 5,000 in one day oh I would have loved to have seen it brother Jordan wouldn't you just have loved to see all these people gathered around Peter and John and saying you know what he's right and it came to pass on the tomorrow that their ruler and elders and scribes and Annis the high priest and cesis and John and Alexander And as many as were of the Kindred of the high priest were gathered together at Jerusalem these are the same guys that crucified Jesus the Sadducees and when they had set them in the midst they asked them by what power about what name have you done this they just healed the guy how' you do this because you can't be right they can never imagine that a miracle or God could be done outside their own faith then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and Elders of Israel if we this day be examined of the good deed done by the impotent Man by what means he has made whole be it known unto you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth who you crucified whom God has raised from the dead these are the people that don't believe in the resurrection who God raised from the dead even by him does this man stand here before you whole preaching the gospel boldness while they were running away just maybe a couple days earlier now they're standing there with the same people that crucified that crucified Jesus that was chasing them and here's Peter saying the the one that you crucified he raised from the dead that's by what power that we're doing these things I love the boldness of these brothers and just the the power that they had the confidence that they had of what they were pre preaching was the absolute truth and then chapter five in the book of Acts we see this story about ananas and safire do you remember that story everyone was giving everything that they had to this movement of Christianity they were giving all they would sell their land and and give it just so they could send the disciples out to preach the gospel and here comes this ananas and sa and they didn't give everything but they said that they gave everything have you heard the term the sign of the Messiah Discerning the secrets of their heart Peter does it right right here they came before him and Peter says hey you didn't give all of it but you said you didn't have to give any of it it was yours to begin with but because you lied ananas came first he dropped dead his wife comes second Peter says hey did you give all of it she says yep she drops dead then the Sadducees in chapter 5 they continue their persecution of the Disciples of Jesus then in chapter six we see the disciples and they're going around and they're preaching the gospel and and they're they're Healing The Sick and they're they're doing all of these things and and they get tired and there's a whole lot to do and they forgot that hey we have the people in the church that need food and you're neglecting them and the widows these widows they don't have a bread winner so isn't the church supposed to supposed to give these these widows food and to help everybody and they're like oh yeah well but we can't spend all of our time doing that we're out here winning souls to Christ so then they choose seven men to be what's called deacons these men were just great men of God and then those deacons we don't hear we we just hear about we can't have a book that says everything everybody that was going out and doing things but now that that these deacons have been named now the the book starts talking about these deacons and they're going out and they're Healing The Sick and they're preaching the gospel and they're doing all these things it shows you that it doesn't have to be the pastor that it doesn't have to be an apostle that it needs to be all of us that are out winning Souls that are praying for the sick you don't have to come here to this altar to be healed all of us should be living a life like the people in this book of Acts that we can lay our hands on the sick and they would recover and the Bible goes through the book of Acts goes through these men are doing these great Miracles and here comes this Deacon named Stephen and Stephen is out preaching the gospel he's doing all of these Miracles he's Healing The Sick and here come the high priest the high priest himself listen to Stephen did not like him preaching preaching this resurrected Jesus Christ so he goes and they get all the people riled up and Stephen is there they pick up Stones they take him outside the city they pick up Stones Here Comes this young man I gave the the description of him I don't know a few couple months ago short stocky bowlegged his eyes closed together his eyebrows touched in the middle young man standing there zealous for what he believed zealous for the word of Moses zealous for the law he wasn't a sadducee this young man is a Pharisee the other sect of of these Jews and he was there and and he saw saw this man Stephen preaching these things that this Jesus Christ was the Fulfillment of the Messiah and he himself was God and it raised up this indignation in this man this young man he hated hated what they what he was preaching he consented he said go ahead they cast this man stepen outside of the city picked up Stones before Stephen preaches the in my opinion the most beautiful sermon if you want to be introduced or you want to introduce someone to the Lord Jesus and there's someone that that knows History Stephen preaches the most beautiful sermon you've ever heard in this Acts chapter 6 chapter 7 and then Stevens cast outside the city this Saul I was talking about this young man consents to his death they pick up stones and they start throwing these stones at Stephen acts 7: 59 says this and they stoned Stephen calling upon God and saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit so so G so they're stoning Stephen Stephen is calling upon God and saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit do you remember the spirit of Christ what it does and he kneeled down and he cried with a loud voice Lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep do you remember the author of Acts Luke let's turn to Luke chapter 23 and I want to see if what I just read when Stephen knelt down and cried with a loud voice as these stones are hitting him he said Lord lay not this sin to their CH their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep Luke chap 23 verse 34 here is the man that was filled with the spirit nailed to the cross and here's what he says then said Jesus he's looking down upon these men that crucified him his own Brethren that nailed him to this cross and he says this father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his reignment and cast lots there's the same spirit that was in this great man Stephen saying Lord forgive him but one thing Stephen didn't say the next verse then Jesus said father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his reignment and cast lots now let's skip to verse 46 in Luke 23 says this now here's something Jesus or Stephen did not say and when Jesus had cried with a loud voice he said father into thy hands I commend my spirit and having thus said he gave up the ghost Stephen didn't have the authority to lay down his life or to pick it up again but Jesus did he said Father Here is my spirit I'm going to die on my own accord on my own will Lord I am going to die he could have waved his hand he could have moved his finger and the angels would have came and ripped those Nails out and he would have been healed but he said Lord I commit my spirit into your hands now when Steph dies we see the first glimpse of this young man back to acts 8 we see the first glimpse of this man Saul of Tarsus and he was agreeing to Steph's death and after he's converted he mentions how wrong he was when he was there that must have really bothered him imagine there is Saul there's this young man and he's seeing this this man there maybe kneeling down and these rocks hitting them and he sees this man look up and say father forgive him it must have made an impression on this young man it's something that he never forgot that Paul never forgot later on this Spirit just welled up in in in this man Saul of tarus and he goes and he starts persecuting all the Christians he rose to the very top to where he was the chief persecutor of them all and here he is going to Damascus to persecute he's got the letters in his hands I've Got The Power I am going to take these people we're going to kill them we're going to shut this stuff out this is causing our children to go astray it's causing all these problems we've got to shut these people called Christians down he's on his way and we see that he's knocked down we see that the Apostle is he's sincere as I said he is zealous in his belief but it shows you we can be sincerely wrong in how we believe and we can think that we're more right than anyone else and all of us do think that that we're right and that's how this man Paul was he thought he was right so much so that he was willing to take these people's lives zealous more learned more more into the scriptures knew his scriptures better than anyone under the very best of teachers and here he is going exactly against God reading the same Bible that Peter read against the Lord Jesus he's going on this road to Damascus he's got the letter in his hand he is going to condemn these people I have my orders here from the San hadrin Council going on the road he gets knocked [Music] down loses his eyesight from this great flash of light and he knew that God was speaking and he says Lord who are you he hears this voice said Saul Saul why persecute us St me why are you persecuting me God speaking it shows you that if we persecute someone one of God's children talk bad about them kill them hurt them in any way that we are doing that to God himself he says this he says why are you persecuting me Saul says who are you Lord he says I am Jesus remember he was going to persecute the Christians and he says you're persecuting me Jesus right there we see a pivotal time in this book of Acts we see now the pendulum is starting to sway it just started now it's going from Peter and it's going to start to go to this man Paul so Paul now he takes off and he goes and studies in a different country he wants to make sure that he is right he wants to make sure Lord is what I believe was that really you speaking to me am I really right in these scriptures putting these scriptures together and saying that this man Christ is actually this man Jesus is actually the Messiah so now back to Peter and I like to read this chapter 9 verse 36 now there was at japa a certain disciple named Tabitha which by interpretation is called Dorcas this woman was full of good works and alms Deeds which she did and it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died whom when they had washed they laid her in an upper chamber for as much as L was not a japa and the disciples had heard that Peter was there they sent unto him two men Desiring him that he would not delay to come to them and Peter arose and went with them when he was come they brought him into the upper chamber and all the W the widows stood by him weeping and showing the coats and garments by which Dorcas made while she was with them but Peter put them all forth he put them all out and he kneeled down and he prayed turning him and turning him to the body said Tabatha arise and she open opened her eyes and when she saw Peter she sat up a woman that was dead dead for some time and here comes Peter and he walks into this room and he says Tabitha arise and he gave her his hand and lifted her up and when he had called the Saints and widows presented her alive and it was known throughout all of japa and many believed in the Lord the Same Spirit that was on Christ let's turn to Luke 8: 41 the Lord Jesus now I wonder if Peter remembered this when he went into Tabitha he was there and I wonder if Peter remembered what had happened with Jesus and behold there came a man named gyrus and he was a ruler of the synagogue and he fell down at Jesus's feet and besought him that he would come into His house for he had only one daughter about 12 years of age and she lay a dying but as he went the people thronged him let's skip to verse 49 so now Jesus comes to this house or he's on his way while he yet spake there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house saying unto him thy daughter is dead trouble not the master but when Jesus heard it he answered him saying fear not believe only and she shall be made whole and when he came into the house he suffered no man to go in exactly what Peter did except Peter I wonder if Jesus knew hey this is going to happen later on except Peter and James and John and the father and the mother of the maiden so for some reason Jesus wanted Peter in there I want you to witness this I wonder if I I assume Peter had no idea but I guarantee you when he went to Tabatha he remembered this and all wept and bewailed her but he said weep not she is not dead but sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn knowing that she was dead and he put them all out and he took her by the hand remember what Peter did and he took her by the hand and called saying maid arise and the Spirit came again and she Rose straightway and he commanded to give her meat exactly the same thing that happened in the book of Acts years later then we go on to chapter 10 and we see the message starts to go out we see from one to seven it just the message is just in Jerusalem and then from 8 and N the message starts going out to Judea still in Israel and then we see in 10 here we see a big change we see the conversion of a gentile named cor Cornelius he was a centurion great man he sends for Peter to come he wants to hear this gospel Peter is in his house and he he he he goes up to the roof and he's praying and he has a vision and he has a vision of of these these animals coming down and they're what we would call what a Jew would call an unclean animal something that listen I am a staunch Jew I don't eat certain things because it's written in the law of Moses that I don't I don't eat these things I'm I'm I'm living right I'm doing all these things right and here comes these animals and Peter's hungry and God tells him Peter raise up and eat and Peter's like not me I believe your word God and here's God telling him to eat Peter's like I don't ever do that I don't do I don't I don't I don't eat anything unclean he gets rebuked by the Lord saying listen if I make it clean I don't care what you think Peter if if I make it clean it's clean I don't care if you think it doesn't look right I don't care if it doesn't match your Doctrine I'm God if I make it clean if I cleanse it it's clean so Peter then there's a knock at the door and it's a messenger from this man named Cornelius so now Peter goes to these Gentiles houses and he preaches the gospel to them and they receive Jesus Christ not only do they receive and give their hearts to the Lord but they receive the Holy Spirit a gentile so Peter not Paul Peter's the first one that converted the Gentiles so now we see Paul and he's he's out and about in this chapter 11 and he's going around and he's traveling we see Peter um doing doing the same thing that he's doing and we're seeing this this paradigm shift to Paul's Ministry and away from Peter and then in chapter 12 we see the persecution goes from the Jews to the next level this man Herod one of the herods we've we've heard a lot about them this man Herod kills James the brother of John murders him and then he sees that it pleased the Jews which is the Pharisees and the Sadducees the priests so he goes after Peter now he's like hey if I kill James Peter's a bigger fish than James is so I'm going to kill him too so he gets Peter arrests him and he throws him in PRI prison and I love and this I almost cried this morning when I was reading this I love what happens here Peter's in prison and I thought about I was sending my messages out to you all saying hey pray for me I I could really use it I need to make some important decisions and it says here in chapter 12 verse 5 Peter therefore was kept in prison but listen to this but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him so when we send out these prayer requests for WhatsApp it's to me it's going right back here to the book of Acts chapter 12 12:24 it says this this is the shift from Peter's Ministry to Paul's Ministry right now in chapter 12 but the word of God grew and multiplied and Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had filled their Ministry and took with them John whose surname was Mark now Chapter 13 Verse 38 and 39 Paul is preaching a sermon that's similar to that of Peter and Stephen where he brings Christ through the prophet's messages and he says this when I say the prophets messages I'm talking about all of the Old Testament prophets they use every sermon listen every sermon in the New Testament everyone is about Jesus can't find one that's not what they do is they take what the prophet said and they say here is the Fulfillment about the of that what the prophet said and it's this man Christ it's this man Jesus every sermon 1338 says this be it known Paul was preaching this sermon he says be it known unto you therefore men and Brethren that through this man is preached unto you forgiveness of sins and by him all that believe are Justified from all things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses that's a mouthful for Paul to say you couldn't be justified through the law of Moses I know you kept all the Commandments you did all of this but there was no justification there you had to have a sacrifice and that lamb that animal that just sacrificed IED ain't good enough because you're a human being it had to be a human being that gave his life for this beware therefore lest that come upon you which was spoken of the in of in the prophets behold ye despisers and wonder and perish for I work a work in your days a work which ye shall in no wise believe though a man declared unto you we see the Fulfillment of the scriptures here where the Jews reject the message of Christ and this message now goes to the Gentiles and I'll close if the musicians would come verse 42 and when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue the Gentiles besought these words the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath look at the hunger in these Gentiles is said wow this preaching of Jesus this preaching of a savior this is this is something that we need to have I'm a sinner I want to have this savior you're saying it doesn't have to be the Jews only I'm a sinner so I can come and I can receive the same thing as as these Jews now when the congregation was broken up many of the Jews and religious prelit followed Paul and Barnabas who speaking to them persuaded them to continue in the grace of God he wasn't trying to get them to leave their faith he wasn't trying to get them to leave their religion or the things that they lived by he wasn't trying to say hey you you you shouldn't be um keeping the Sabbath he wasn't saying that you shouldn't live holy he wasn't saying any of that and when the Jews were gone out of the synagogues I'm sorry verse verse 44 and the next Sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God think about the Revival that was happening but when the Jews saw the multitudes they were filled with envy and spake against these those things which were spoken by Paul contradicting and blasphemy then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary here is the pivotal Moment In the book of Acts it's a PIV it's a pivotal moment in history it starts 2,000 years of the message going to the Gentiles us then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the the word of God should first have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life Lo we turn to the Gentiles for so hath the Lord commanded us saying I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles that thou should us be for salvation un the ends of the Earth and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed and the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region here we see that shift it started in the book of Acts they were preaching to the Jews in Jerusalem Jesus said it must must go to Jerusalem first then we see it spread out to the country of Israel in Judea with Peter and all the disciples and then now we see Paul says okay I tried I did my best but right here it says in the prophet's words that this would go to the Gentiles and we are turning now to the gentile people as I said it started a movement that has lasted into this day 2,000 years of a gentile dispensation very soon very very soon who knows we may be seeing something starting now in the Middle East that may lead to it I think about that and I think Lord I got it we got to get to work but it's promised that that message that was sent to us our people would go to the ones that were originally blinded these Jewish people and then that disp that Gentile dispensation dispensing the message to the gentile people will be over and the word will go back to the Jewish people it talks about a talks about a an olive tree talks about how that the tree is pruned off and a branch of a different type of olive tree of a of a wild ol tree one that couldn't be tamed that it was taken it was cut off and it was grafted in to that original that original tree and it started to grow and it's grown for 2,000 years but it's promised that soon that that branch that that tree is going to put out its own branches and that is the meth message going back to the Jewish people and we're about to see it friends it's going to happen soon let's stand this book of Acts is tremendous we see the spirit of God and the disciples doing the same thing that Jesus did and we see the spirit of the devil doing the same thing that the high priest did with the same attitude and those Spirits all those people are gone but those Spirits are still here Among Us What Spirit do we have what Spirit do I have let's bow our heads brother Arie why don't you come in close I think [Music] there is that Mak from sin oh come to this water there is a [Music] vast there is a a [Music] river that never [Music] shall brothers and sisters going through the book of Acts like with everywhere in the Bible make sure you are relating to these people in the book of Acts and ask yourself what side would I have been on on in this crazy new message that's against everything that I've ever heard but it lines up perfectly with the word or digging in hating people not wanting to give an inch where would I have been we should always be checking ourselves Lord I want to stand on the right side of History I want to stand with none other than Jesus Jesus Christ himself brother [Music] [Music] Arie pray with me please this is quite an appointment to be able to talk the creator that created this beautiful creation amen and I don't consider him a failure I don't believe anybody here does oh amen and I've had some amazing answers to prayer I've talked to people of all walks of life that had answers to prayer and sometimes they just break down with the memory Lord of you that hears us before the world was created see us standing here Lord and we can't say we're necessarily more fervent than anybody else or better than anybody else Lord but we're standing here in an unusual spot Lord we're an unusual man lived and proclaimed the same gospel that you you said he would restore and that's what I believe Lord and I I believe these people here believe it too and we just want to surrender to you and ask you to fill us you you did say this that of a father would give good things to his children how much more would he give his Spirit the same SP spirit that you have it's almost unbelievable that you are that powerful you said he would send power from on high to those people and here we are standing thousands 2,000 years later in this great time of all the prophetic utterances that are being fulfilled now Lord we just thank you for this opportunity to ask you and each one of us Lord he's talking about prayer and how the people even doubted their own prayers when Peter was in prison but Lord I've forgotten my prayers and you still answered them Lord I just thank you and I I ask you to forgive me now and forgive anybody here Lord that wants it and maybe even doesn't want it Lord but I just know there's got to be something to is real powerful that could come and give everybody a chance you said that the greatest Mercy would come before the greatest judgment and so I just thank you for this opportunity to come together with Believers in Jesus Christ's name I don't want to overdo it Lord but I just wanted to join like brother Evan said that we could pray all night they were praying Lord so I just would like to continue with prayer with Thanksgiving in Jesus Christ's name amen thank [Music] you there came a sound from heaven as a rushing [Music] Mighty it filled their hearts with singing and gave them peace with oh the pro gave this promise oh the spir will desend and from your inner be a river with no [Music] yes there is a river that flows from De with there is a fountain that frees the soul from [Music] sin come to this water there is a v there is a river [Music] that shall amen as I said we need to relate to the people in this Bible Brother Andy I think I know where I am I'm one of those Gentiles that said my sins can be forgiven I want my sins forgiven there are many but through the blood of Jesus Christ and him crucified our sins can be forgiven if we will accept that pardon it's the most important thing in the [Music] world God bless you brothers and sisters have a good week again on Friday we we have um our Upper Room will be open for the
