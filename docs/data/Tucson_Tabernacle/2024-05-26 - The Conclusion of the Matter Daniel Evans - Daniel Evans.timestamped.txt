[28:33] then shall the dust return to the Earth
[28:34] as it
[28:36] was and the spirit shall return unto God
[28:39] who gave
[28:40] it vanity of vanities sayeth the
[28:43] preacher all is Vanity the word vanity
[28:45] means
[28:47] meaningless a meaningless
[28:49] meaningless says the preacher is all
[28:51] meaningless and moreover because the
[28:54] preacher was wise he still taught the
[28:56] people knowledge yet he gave good heed
[28:59] and sought out and set in order many
[29:02] Proverbs the preacher sought to find out
[29:05] acceptable
[29:07] words and that which was written was
[29:10] upright even the words of truth the
[29:13] words of the wise are as goats and As
[29:15] Nails fastened by the master masters of
[29:19] assemblies which are given from one
[29:22] Shepherd and further by these my son be

[32:42] there's got to be a purpose there's got
[32:44] to be something there that all the
[32:48] efforts that we make from the way that
[32:50] we look to come into church to to
[32:53] everything that we do there's got to be
[32:54] an ultimate goal in all of this and as
[32:58] Solomon said he said let us hear the
[33:01] conclusion of the whole
[33:04] matter and my sermon today is is the
[33:08] conclusion of the whole matter and what
[33:10] is that conclusion of this whole
[33:13] book I was this week I was um I asked a
[33:16] few of you to pray um that I was going
[33:20] to be helping a family with um with a
[33:23] young man that's was being sentenced on
[33:27] Friday
[33:29] and been praying about it as as many of
[33:32] you that were present on Wednesday night
[33:33] have been praying with me and the family
[33:36] was hoping for a miracle to happen there
[33:39] was a minimum sentence and it could have
[33:42] gone anywhere from the minimum all the
[33:44] way to many many many years in prison
[33:47] and the family was hoping that the
[33:50] attorney had suggested that there may be
[33:52] a hope for probation here that the judge
[33:56] could do it so the family was hoping for
[33:58] this and and and we were praying and and
[34:01] as I woke up on Friday morning and I was
[34:05] praying about these things he asking the
[34:08] Lord Lord have mercy on this young man
[34:12] bless his family and bless these
[34:15] people and as I was
[34:17] praying the thought came to my
[34:23] mind what is the conclusion of this
[34:27] matter
[34:28] so and so often we we're so s
[34:31] shortsighted that we think well the
[34:33] conclusion would be that this there's
[34:35] that there's a miracle in this and and
[34:37] we all give God the praise and all of a
[34:39] sudden this young man he's going to be
[34:40] in church every day he's going to be
[34:43] fellowshipping with us all and his life
[34:44] is just going to line up perfect and
[34:46] that's going to be the conclusion of the
[34:48] matter and it all starts with us getting
[34:50] our way and and the prayer being
[34:53] answered that the judge signs off on him
[34:56] and lets him go
[34:59] and as I was praying the thought came to
[35:02] my mind this this verse in
[35:06] Ecclesiastes of saying what is the
[35:10] conclusion what is the ultimate goal of
[35:12] all of this and my prayer just took a
[35:16] different
[35:18] direction and it was
[35:21] Lord if you need to keep this young man
[35:24] in prison keep him in prison
[35:28] what is the conclusion of this matter
[35:32] what is the end of these things it's not
[35:35] that he has to go sit in a jail cell for
[35:38] a few years but the end is a long way
[35:41] down the road where he has to come into
[35:44] the presence of God and when he stands
[35:45] in the presence of God what will be his
[35:48] eternal
[35:49] destination and a little bit of
[35:51] suffering right now is well worth
[35:54] it because the end is what what matters
[35:59] so I was
[36:01] praying about this and and then the
[36:03] thoughts came to my mind what
[36:06] good would it do for him for him to get
[36:10] released so actually we went I felt what
[36:16] the Lord was going to do and was trying
[36:18] to encourage the family and he ended up
[36:21] the judge gave him the minimum sentence
[36:24] which was still
[36:26] incarceration and and of course the
[36:28] family some of the family was upset
[36:31] other others were like no this is this
[36:34] is good he he had mercy on
[36:37] us and then I in talking to the family
[36:40] afterwards I said what decision would
[36:42] you
[36:43] make do we really believe in
[36:47] God I think we like to say that we do we
[36:51] like to come to church we like to maybe
[36:54] think that we're going to be okay on the
[36:56] other side
[36:58] but do we really believe that there is a
[37:00] God and do we really believe that he has
[37:03] a
[37:04] plan and if we do we don't want our will
[37:09] how often do I say it's not about me
[37:12] it's not about you but we want his will
[37:15] because his will will end up in
[37:17] Perfection we will benefit from his will
[37:21] because he has us in
[37:24] mind I'm spending some time in a cell or
[37:29] a room with just you and God it'll do
[37:33] you good I believe it'll do this young
[37:36] man good and and I committed to him no
[37:39] matter what that that hey I'm going to
[37:41] be
[37:41] there and I'm going to help them brother
[37:43] Jeremiah this is the one I was talking
[37:45] about when I I talked to you earlier he
[37:47] needs friends he needs help he needs
[37:52] God and he he told me he said when I
[37:55] first met him I started visiting I don't
[37:57] know over a month
[37:59] ago and he he said this that happened to
[38:04] me he said this is right and he says I'm
[38:07] thankful I'm here I'm thankful all of
[38:10] this happened he said because if I was
[38:12] out I didn't think about God he says but
[38:14] now all I do is think about
[38:17] God and I believe and I I believe the
[38:19] Lord laid it on my heart
[38:22] that I just need a little more time with
[38:25] him God speaking
[38:29] the Bible says that there is a way that
[38:32] seems right to a man but the
[38:36] end its end is the way to
[38:40] death and we we look around in the world
[38:42] and we all want to be successful and we
[38:45] all want we seek maybe popularity and
[38:48] riches and having fun and it leads to
[38:50] maybe hanging out and drinking with your
[38:52] friends enjoying the pleasures of the
[38:54] world loving the things of the world but
[38:57] the end and that sounds right in our
[38:59] minds but the end of that is death the
[39:03] Bible
[39:04] says and then God in his kindness who is
[39:08] rich in Mercy will cut our legs out from
[39:11] under us sometime and bring us to him
[39:14] but he ultimately he wants us to make
[39:16] the decision Lord I want you more than I
[39:18] want the things of the
[39:22] world first John says don't love the
[39:25] things of the the things don't love the
[39:27] world or the things of the world if
[39:29] anyone loves the world the love of the
[39:32] father is not in
[39:34] him for all that is in the world the
[39:36] desires of the Flesh and the desires of
[39:38] the eyes and the pride of life it's not
[39:42] from the
[39:44] father but it's from the world is what
[39:47] the scripture says and the world is
[39:49] passing away along with its desires but
[39:52] whoever does the will of God abides
[39:55] forever
[39:59] the world today brothers and sisters we
[40:01] get so caught up in the things of life
[40:05] and we want so bad to to fit in and we
[40:09] want so bad to prosper and we want so
[40:11] bad this this Society to PE for people
[40:16] to respect us and to people to think
[40:18] that we're something special and the end
[40:20] of those
[40:21] things is
[40:23] death they don't
[40:26] matter he wants us to enjoy life I
[40:28] believe I believe he wants us to have
[40:31] love with each other and and I believe
[40:33] he wants us to have peace but we can't
[40:35] find peace in the things of the world we
[40:38] find peace in the things of God that's
[40:42] where our that's where our lives rest
[40:46] that's
[40:47] where
[40:49] we put our whole confidence is in the
[40:53] things of God I'm going to tell a story
[40:56] um I'm going to wait to the kids the
[40:58] kids get here I was helping a uh there's
[41:03] another man
[41:05] that I helped
[41:08] out I I wanted to see him give his heart
[41:11] to the Lord he was he was on the streets
[41:14] and he had he had children and and he
[41:17] came to me and he he he wanted some help
[41:20] so he seemed to be sincere the words
[41:22] that he said seem sincere so I helped
[41:25] him out I gave him I gave him some money
[41:29] to
[41:30] to get a place to stay I got him a
[41:34] job good
[41:36] job and he started working at that at
[41:41] that job then I called a few days
[41:45] later and I talked to my friend who
[41:48] employed him and I said How's this guy
[41:51] doing and he said he says I haven't seen
[41:53] him since Tuesday he says he worked two
[41:56] days he he says he asked me for um some
[41:59] money for the for the days that he
[42:01] worked he said he had to pay some bills
[42:03] and he says I gave him I gave him the
[42:04] check I was expecting him to show up on
[42:06] Wednesday he didn't show up and he
[42:07] hasn't showed up since and I can't get a
[42:08] hold of
[42:10] him I
[42:12] think brother you had it you had what
[42:15] you needed right there to get going you
[42:18] had a job you had a place you had a
[42:22] really you had a church you had a pastor
[42:25] that cared about you you had somebody
[42:26] that was advocate for you and what did
[42:29] you do you took it and you just you you
[42:32] got what you needed right now you didn't
[42:35] think of the conclusion of the matter
[42:38] what you thought of is here's what I
[42:40] want to do right now and you left and
[42:41] now he's back on the
[42:43] streets back homeless and there's a
[42:45] reason he's homeless and it's no one
[42:47] else's fault it's his own fault and it's
[42:50] the
[42:51] selfishness of people that they want to
[42:54] serve themselves rather than than
[42:57] serving God and serving other people
[43:00] when we see brothers and sisters when we
[43:03] see the homeless people and I have a
[43:05] burden for them brother Arie has a
[43:06] burden for them both of us we're
[43:08] reaching out all the time we're trying
[43:09] to help and we're doing everything that
[43:11] we can but I see such a
[43:13] selfishness that I'm going to serve
[43:15] myself I know I have a family but I'm
[43:18] going to get what I want first and then
[43:21] you send the you see the
[43:23] end of that you see the conclusion of
[43:26] the matter is where they are
[43:29] now there's a story that brother brandom
[43:32] tells it's a fairy tale that I thought
[43:36] would go perfect with this so there's
[43:39] this as I said it's a fairy tale I
[43:41] actually found it on uh I found it on
[43:44] YouTube and it's like this really old
[43:46] video and and they they they played it
[43:48] there but it's it's the story of the
[43:51] magic
[43:52] flower and there's this prospector he's
[43:56] never had any money his life he's never
[43:57] been successful and he he's walking
[44:00] along and he sees this flower down on
[44:02] the ground and he picks the
[44:05] flower and the flower speaks to him and
[44:09] the flower
[44:10] says you don't have any
[44:12] money he says you've never you've been
[44:15] poor all of your life he says ask what
[44:18] you will and I'll give it to you so the
[44:23] man his flowers talking to him and and
[44:26] he looked out at this
[44:28] mountain and he says tell that mountain
[44:32] to open up and then all the gold and all
[44:36] the treasures that are in that mountain
[44:38] will be revealed and I will go and I
[44:41] will take
[44:42] that so the flower he takes the flower
[44:46] and he starts walking towards the
[44:50] mountain and the and an earthquake
[44:52] starts to happen starts to shake and the
[44:55] mountain opens up
[44:57] and they walk inside and they see that
[45:00] there's gold nuggets all over the place
[45:02] there's there's great
[45:04] gemstones over over here and there's
[45:06] there's silver and there there's gold
[45:08] and there's all of these things so the
[45:10] man goes in and he grabs the biggest
[45:12] gemstone and he takes it and he starts
[45:14] to run out he sets the flower down he
[45:17] starts to run out and the flower says
[45:19] wait you're forgetting the main
[45:23] thing man says oh yeah you're right so
[45:26] he goes back in and he says I'll take
[45:28] some of this silver and he he grabs the
[45:30] silver and he starts walking out and
[45:32] there's the flower there and the flower
[45:34] says wait you're forgetting the main
[45:38] thing he says oh yeah you're right so he
[45:40] goes back in and he grabs the
[45:43] gold and he starts out and the flower
[45:46] says once again you're forgetting the
[45:48] main
[45:50] thing he looks
[45:53] down and he says you're right he takes
[45:55] all the riches lets him
[45:58] down he knows the geology of the area so
[46:00] he sees this this rock that's there and
[46:03] he he grabs this rock and he says this
[46:06] rock is only in this area he says if I
[46:08] just have this rock I'll know exactly
[46:10] where to come back to this place and I
[46:13] can get my wagon and I can get my mule
[46:15] and I can go and I can fill it up and
[46:18] then I can have all of these riches so
[46:20] he takes the Rock and he starts out and
[46:22] the flower says
[46:25] sir you're forgetting the the main
[46:28] thing and he says he says he says I've
[46:31] got everything that I need I don't need
[46:33] you anymore and he walks out and as he's
[46:35] walking down the mountain he starts to
[46:36] hear the rumbling
[46:38] again and he looks back and there where
[46:41] the mountain had opened it
[46:44] closed with the flower inside and
[46:48] everything that he had and he was left
[46:50] with nothing but this rock he didn't
[46:54] consider the in end of the story he
[46:58] didn't consider the conclusion he didn't
[47:01] consider the sum of
[47:05] everything job when job was sick and and
[47:09] he was dying and his children had died
[47:12] and his wife was against him and he's
[47:14] there and he's he's picking the the
[47:16] scabs off of his arm and and he's sick
[47:19] and and he and he looks and he sees that
[47:21] there is a dead tree there and he sees
[47:25] that once the water had hit that dead
[47:27] tree that had been cut off that life
[47:31] started coming from it and job was
[47:33] thinking of the conclusion of the
[47:36] matter and job looks at the tree he
[47:39] wasn't looking at his dead family he
[47:41] wasn't looking at his wife he wasn't
[47:43] looking at how he had lost all his
[47:44] riches he looks at the tree and he sees
[47:47] the conclusion of the matter and he says
[47:49] if a tree can live again with just the
[47:53] scent of water he says whatat about a
[47:55] man
[47:58] what about the conclusion of that
[48:01] matter what about me when I die what
[48:03] about my children they're dead what
[48:06] about my loved ones what is the
[48:09] conclusion of the
[48:13] matter and then we see
[48:18] that you I was praying this morning I
[48:21] said Lord what's going to be the
[48:22] conclusion of the matter with my sermon
[48:25] today I
[48:28] I did I was
[48:30] serious did you ever um do you ever use
[48:33] Excel the spreadsheet I'm always in
[48:35] Excel and my favorite part of of excel
[48:38] is the little summation symbol and you
[48:41] can highlight a whole line as many
[48:44] numbers as you want and you can hit that
[48:46] summation symbol and WR at the bottom it
[48:48] adds them all up and you've got your
[48:50] answer right there it is so easy I can
[48:52] have I can have page and page and page
[48:54] and page of spreadsheets and then right
[48:55] at the end I'll hit copy copy copy copy
[48:58] paste summation boom and it gives me the
[49:02] answer I wish I could do that with
[49:05] life I do I wish I could say
[49:09] Lord I messed up over here what's the
[49:12] summation of all of this Lord we we've
[49:15] we we're doing this with the church
[49:17] what's what's the conclusion of the
[49:19] matter
[49:20] Lord I see all the problems Lord what is
[49:23] the conclusion I wish we could say that
[49:25] I wish we could do that but but we can't
[49:28] God wants us to
[49:29] come come always trusting in Him and we
[49:33] don't know we do know the end and the
[49:37] point is to get from here to get to
[49:40] there when
[49:42] Moses when he brought this
[49:47] law and the people wanted the law when
[49:50] Moses brought this law and he set the
[49:52] Ten Commandments and he said set all of
[49:55] these these these rules and one of them
[49:58] I believe it's the um sixth commandment
[50:01] was to honor the Sabbath and to keep it
[50:04] holy so let's turn to Numbers chapter 15
[50:08] and let's see the conclusion of the
[50:10] matter with the law numbers
[50:14] 15:32 and he said from God he said honor
[50:18] the Sabbath keep it
[50:20] holy and while the children of Israel
[50:22] were in the wilderness they found a man
[50:24] that gathered sticks upon on the Sabbath
[50:27] day and they that found him Gathering
[50:30] sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron
[50:32] and un all the
[50:34] congregation they didn't know what was
[50:36] going to happen this is the first one
[50:38] that had broken one of the laws that
[50:40] Moses brought down so what is the
[50:42] conclusion of the matter and they put
[50:45] him in the ward because it was not
[50:46] declared what should be done to him and
[50:49] the Lord said unto Moses The man shall
[50:53] be surely put to
[50:54] death and all the con
[50:57] congregation shall Stone him with stones
[51:00] without the
[51:01] camp and all the congregation brought
[51:04] him without means outside the camp and
[51:07] they stoned him with stones and he died
[51:09] as the Lord had commanded
[51:12] Moses remember when Moses was out up on
[51:16] Mount
[51:17] Si and all the rumbling and all the
[51:20] smoke that was going on and the people
[51:22] they came to the mountain and Moses was
[51:24] really excited he says you're going to
[51:25] get to talk to
[51:27] God and the people came and they saw the
[51:30] rumbling and they saw everything and
[51:33] they were like no no no no no these
[51:35] Stakes are too high let Moses speak and
[51:40] not
[51:42] God because they saw that their sins
[51:44] they didn't want to give up their sins
[51:46] they didn't want to start living right
[51:47] what they wanted they say oh just put a
[51:49] man between us and God and then we'll be
[51:53] okay because over here God's going to
[51:55] put us to together death but Moses he
[51:57] has compassion on us and it ruined they
[52:00] didn't think of the end
[52:02] game they didn't think of the conclusion
[52:04] of the matter they didn't think that hey
[52:06] this is going to separate us from God
[52:08] I'm not going to get to talk to
[52:10] him face to
[52:12] face I'm not going to get to to
[52:15] correspond with God but we do we want
[52:18] you to put a man or a priest or a
[52:20] prophet in that area so I can talk to
[52:23] this one and then he can go to God on my
[52:26] behalf because I don't want to back it
[52:27] up with my
[52:29] life God says okay I won't speak to him
[52:32] anymore and from that point on now we
[52:36] have these high priests and the high
[52:37] priests have to go in to the tabernacle
[52:39] into the holy of holies every year and
[52:41] make atonement for the sins and the then
[52:43] the priests have to kill the sacrifice
[52:46] and what God wanted in the in the whole
[52:48] time he just wanted fellowship with his
[52:51] people but instead of that the
[52:54] conclusion of the matter was the people
[52:56] didn't want fellowship with
[52:58] God so they said let put somebody
[53:03] else in our
[53:06] place I always
[53:11] say that it's not about you you know
[53:14] we're s we're such a selfish generation
[53:17] we're always thinking about ourselves
[53:18] we're always serving ourselves this is
[53:20] what makes me feel good this is what
[53:22] makes me happy this is what I want to do
[53:25] and that's I'm always saying hey listen
[53:26] it's not about you it's about what he
[53:28] said but in the end brothers and sisters
[53:30] it is about you it is about
[53:33] me because God loves us God wants us to
[53:37] be with him so this whole book all of it
[53:41] it's written for
[53:44] us it's all about us and the kindness of
[53:51] God the question then constantly comes
[53:54] up says how do we serve God
[53:59] and so here we have the law and we see
[54:04] that that God not only he gave the The
[54:06] Ten Commandments but then he gave many
[54:08] many other hundreds of other
[54:10] Commandments that the people were to
[54:12] live by and they took that and they said
[54:14] okay here's how we serve God and they
[54:16] started
[54:18] interpreting these
[54:21] laws and they interpreted them without
[54:24] the understanding of the conclusion of
[54:27] the matter what they did is they just
[54:29] started looking at the law and they
[54:30] didn't understand why it was written
[54:34] there's a
[54:36] place in the law that it says this it
[54:40] says Thou shalt not see a kid in his
[54:42] mother's milk it means in Modern English
[54:46] don't boil a baby goat in its mother's
[54:49] milk you may not have ever heard that
[54:52] it's like oh well that's odd I can check
[54:56] that box haven't done that one yet nor
[54:58] do I want
[55:00] to so they took this and they started
[55:04] interpreting this and they said okay
[55:06] well technically if you have this pot
[55:10] and you have milk in
[55:12] there that and you ever you ever cook
[55:16] with milk in there well that's got to be
[55:18] separate than this dish over here
[55:20] because this dish that you you could
[55:22] have meat over in this one and there
[55:25] could be a chance although outside there
[55:27] could be a chance that that pot that
[55:30] boiled that milk and this meat was made
[55:35] this was this goat's Mama's
[55:37] milk so you got to have separate
[55:41] dishes and we think of kosher and then
[55:44] it becomes getting too much it's like
[55:47] what do you this isn't this wasn't this
[55:49] wasn't the conclusion of the matter
[55:51] that's not why God said that well what
[55:53] did he say it
[55:56] you won't boil a baby goat in his
[55:59] mother's milk why would he say that it
[56:02] was because at that
[56:05] time when they were going over Canaan
[56:08] these people were idolators very worldly
[56:12] worshiping all of these different idols
[56:15] and that was Pro that was one of their
[56:18] practices that they would to make an
[56:22] offering to their God or whatever they
[56:24] were doing that they would boil
[56:26] this baby goat in its mother's
[56:29] milk so God was saying hey don't act
[56:32] like them don't be like them but what
[56:35] they did they didn't consider the
[56:37] conclusion of the matter what they did
[56:39] is they said okay well we're going to
[56:41] make a rule and this is how we're going
[56:42] to interpret it and then it went on and
[56:44] on and on and on all the way to today to
[56:46] where they have this
[56:47] big conglomeration of all these rules
[56:50] that don't make sense that they don't
[56:52] and they don't work and these are the
[56:55] same people
[56:56] people years later doing the same thing
[57:00] with the separate dishes and all of that
[57:02] these are the same people that broke the
[57:04] sixth commandment Thou shalt not kill
[57:07] and kill Jesus Christ amen keeping their
[57:10] dishes
[57:13] separate and the ninth commandment I
[57:14] believe it is that believe it is Thou
[57:16] shalt not bear false
[57:19] witness the Big
[57:21] 10 and they're separating their
[57:24] dishes they didn't understand the
[57:27] conclusion of the
[57:29] matter you can see that they killed
[57:32] Jesus they killed stepen they killed all
[57:35] the disciples they they hated the
[57:39] Christians and keeping their laws
[57:42] keeping their
[57:43] rules I'll say this how often do we do
[57:48] it you know Thou shalt not bear false
[57:50] witness one of the Ten
[57:52] Commandments how often do we gossip
[57:54] about somebody else
[57:56] amen even if it's true how often do we
[58:00] let something come out of our mouths
[58:03] that is not edifying to that person and
[58:07] then yet we keep our
[58:08] rules wow when Jesus speaking of the
[58:13] Sabbath when Jesus
[58:18] was he was coming
[58:20] into the fields and and he's this
[58:23] prophet and they they were a against
[58:27] him and Jesus's answer to them was in
[58:30] Matthew 5:1
[58:32] 17 The Sermon on the Mount his first
[58:36] sermon he says think not that I am come
[58:38] to destroy the law or the prophets he
[58:41] was saying things like I just said like
[58:43] hey you're not getting it it wasn't
[58:45] about separating your dishes because
[58:48] you're afraid that there might be a
[58:49] little bit of remnants of a milk of milk
[58:52] in this pot and you don't want to cook
[58:54] it in the same pot as this baby goat
[58:58] because it could be the
[59:00] same
[59:03] family and Jesus is like listen you
[59:06] don't you don't get
[59:07] it and they're saying but you came and
[59:09] you came to destroy this law and Jesus
[59:11] says in Matthew 5:17 he says think not
[59:14] that I am come to destroy the law or the
[59:16] prophets I'm not come to destroy it but
[59:20] to
[59:21] fulfill for verily I say unto you till
[59:23] Heaven and Earth pass away not one jot
[59:27] or one tit shall in no wise pass from
[59:29] the law till it all be
[59:33] fulfilled so he's not saying that they
[59:35] need to start boiling a goat in his
[59:37] mother's milk he's saying that there is
[59:39] a greater meaning be of the law and of
[59:43] the prophets and he's saying listen it
[59:46] all comes what is the conclusion of the
[59:48] matter Jesus is saying I am the
[59:51] conclusion of the
[59:53] matter all of this was was working
[59:57] towards
[59:59] him they accused him of not respecting
[1:00:02] the Sabbath when he walked through the
[1:00:04] fields on that day and his disciples so
[1:00:06] they were going we would it would be on
[1:00:09] Sunday for us it was Saturday for them
[1:00:11] there they're going through and they're
[1:00:13] taking the they're taking the the Grain
[1:00:15] and they rub it in their hands and get
[1:00:17] the chaff off of it and they're eating
[1:00:20] it and there's all these fingers
[1:00:22] pointing at them saying listen you're
[1:00:23] not supposed to do that on the Sabbath
[1:00:28] all these these stories were coming to
[1:00:30] mind it's really neat what happened
[1:00:32] yesterday is I was praying I wanted to
[1:00:34] tell this
[1:00:38] story about Jesus saying that I desire
[1:00:42] mercy and not
[1:00:44] sacrifice that scripture was coming to
[1:00:46] mind and then another story where Jesus
[1:00:48] and his disciples as I just said we're
[1:00:50] walking through the fields eating the
[1:00:52] Grain on the
[1:00:54] Sabbath and then I wanted to talk about
[1:00:56] and I thought well maybe this one maybe
[1:00:58] he said this where Jesus said that he is
[1:01:00] the lord of the Sabbath and I looked it
[1:01:03] up Heath it's the same story all of
[1:01:07] those that I had in my heart to tell ma
[1:01:09] Mark chapter
[1:01:11] 2 verse 23 and it came to pass that he
[1:01:15] went through the corn fields on the
[1:01:17] Sabbath day and and his disciples began
[1:01:20] and they they went to pluck the ears of
[1:01:22] corn and the Pharisees said unto them
[1:01:24] behold why do they on the Sabbath day
[1:01:27] which is not lawful and he said unto
[1:01:29] them have you never heard what David did
[1:01:32] when he was in need and he was a
[1:01:34] hungered and they that were with him how
[1:01:38] he went into the house of God in the
[1:01:39] days of abiathar the high priest and did
[1:01:42] eat the shoe bread which is not lawful
[1:01:44] for the eat but for the priests and gave
[1:01:47] also to them that were with him so what
[1:01:48] happened if you remember the story that
[1:01:50] that David his his people needed food
[1:01:54] and David goes to to the synagogue to
[1:01:57] the temple and he asks the priest will
[1:02:01] you give us food to eat and the priest
[1:02:03] takes the food that was for the
[1:02:06] levitical priesthood for the Levites and
[1:02:09] was Abomination for anyone else David
[1:02:11] was from the tribe of Judah and he gives
[1:02:14] the food to David because they were
[1:02:18] hungry because they needed
[1:02:23] it and he went in the house I'll I'll
[1:02:25] read it again went to the house of God
[1:02:26] in those in the days of ABIA the high
[1:02:28] priest and did eat the shoe brid which
[1:02:30] is not lawful to eat but for the priests
[1:02:34] and gave also to them that were with him
[1:02:36] and said unto them the Sabbath was made
[1:02:38] for man and not man for the
[1:02:41] Sabbath he's trying to say you're not
[1:02:44] getting the conclusion of the matter the
[1:02:47] reason you go to church is not because
[1:02:49] the rule says that we go to church on
[1:02:52] Sunday then you may you make it a r rule
[1:02:56] we we devote this
[1:02:59] time because we won't set aside that
[1:03:03] time otherwise we're human
[1:03:05] beings so when Jesus is saying that that
[1:03:07] this sabbath that this is a gift to you
[1:03:09] it's not he's God of the Sabbath God
[1:03:13] doesn't need the Sabbath we need the
[1:03:15] Sabbath because we're human beings and
[1:03:18] we're not going to take the
[1:03:20] time so he sets Church
[1:03:23] aside and says here's a rule rule that
[1:03:26] you go to church on Saturday in in the
[1:03:28] Jewish time because you're not going to
[1:03:30] do it in if if it's not a
[1:03:35] rule therefore verse 28 therefore the
[1:03:39] son of man is Lord also of the
[1:03:44] Sabbath this is the conclusion of the
[1:03:46] whole matter here's the Sabbath here's
[1:03:48] Jesus saying hey I'm the god of the
[1:03:53] Sabbath what is it about the Sabbath
[1:03:56] the conclusion of the fourth I believe
[1:03:58] it's the fourth Commandment the Sabbath
[1:04:00] is hey go and worship set aside a day
[1:04:04] for the Lord because if you don't you're
[1:04:06] a human being everything else and work
[1:04:08] and and play and everything else is
[1:04:10] going to be taken place the place of
[1:04:12] that so set a rule and go to
[1:04:16] church worship pray don't work on this
[1:04:20] day no matter
[1:04:22] what and that's what it's for it's not
[1:04:24] for
[1:04:26] God it's for us
[1:04:32] wow so as I was asking the
[1:04:36] question what
[1:04:38] is the conclusion of the matter of this
[1:04:40] whole book why do we have preachers on
[1:04:43] Sunday and Wednesday why do why do we
[1:04:45] have preachers preaching about this book
[1:04:48] what's the reason is it just to get
[1:04:50] people into church is it
[1:04:53] just to get them to live a better
[1:04:57] life or is there a a higher calling is
[1:05:01] there
[1:05:02] more of of it than just that I see the
[1:05:06] world today and I I look and I there is
[1:05:10] such a force of knowledge in the world
[1:05:13] today we look at our
[1:05:15] phones and Daniel prophesied that the
[1:05:19] that knowledge would increase in the
[1:05:21] last days and we look at our phones and
[1:05:23] it's amazing when was a kid you know we
[1:05:26] didn't have cell phones we uh didn't
[1:05:29] even have internet when I was really
[1:05:31] young I couldn't just look something up
[1:05:33] I had to go and and look it up in a book
[1:05:36] and now it's just right here I don't
[1:05:38] even have to punch a button I can just
[1:05:40] say I don't say it because she'll answer
[1:05:44] but hey Siri you know oh there she
[1:05:50] did loyal assistant um but anything that
[1:05:55] you want to
[1:05:56] know and and and it'll tell you that
[1:06:00] knowledge shall increase and then
[1:06:02] now the this wisdom of the world it
[1:06:06] hurts our faith because all we have to
[1:06:09] do now is we just look it up and we can
[1:06:11] search and how it's like well there's
[1:06:13] it's not possible for the Red Sea toart
[1:06:16] it's not possible for these things to
[1:06:18] happen in fact we can't find any
[1:06:19] evidence that all of this happened and
[1:06:21] all through the internet so really why
[1:06:24] should I believe it it why should I even
[1:06:27] believe that there is a God what has he
[1:06:30] done for
[1:06:31] me and people really say that people
[1:06:34] think that why is it why does this even
[1:06:36] matter and here we have these people at
[1:06:40] the turn of the Millennia when Jesus
[1:06:43] Christ comes and they're all caught up
[1:06:46] in all of their their pots and their
[1:06:48] dishes and and you have the the
[1:06:51] Sadducees over here and they're like
[1:06:53] yeah there's no afterlife it's just it's
[1:06:56] it's just God Almighty and you just
[1:06:58] believe the the laws of Moses and then
[1:07:00] you have the Pharisees over here and
[1:07:02] they're teaching in the synagogues and
[1:07:05] they're teaching like no there is an
[1:07:07] afterlife and all of them are fighting
[1:07:09] and all of them disagree and it's like
[1:07:12] where is the conclusion of the
[1:07:15] matter as Solomon said in Ecclesiastes
[1:07:20] what is the conclusion of the
[1:07:22] matter then this mysterious book this
[1:07:27] mysterious
[1:07:28] letter pops
[1:07:31] up
[1:07:34] in it's probably in
[1:07:36] Jerusalem we don't it doesn't have an
[1:07:40] author most people think it was written
[1:07:42] by the Apostle Paul some people think it
[1:07:44] was written by Apollos there's little
[1:07:46] hints that you can see in it but it
[1:07:49] doesn't have Paul an apostle of Christ
[1:07:52] to the Philippians it doesn't have
[1:07:54] something like that and it doesn't have
[1:07:56] a signature at the end of this is who I
[1:07:58] am it's just this this letter that pops
[1:08:01] up and it's not even really a letter
[1:08:03] it's a
[1:08:05] sermon and that's this book of
[1:08:08] Hebrews so all of these Hebrews around
[1:08:11] Jesus's time they had seen that this man
[1:08:15] is the Messiah but what's
[1:08:18] different how what what's the sum of the
[1:08:21] matter what's what's the conclusion of
[1:08:23] all these things and this book of
[1:08:25] Hebrews
[1:08:26] answers that question most of the book
[1:08:29] much of the book is just quoting
[1:08:31] scriptures and prophecies you don't see
[1:08:34] it in your book but you can see the
[1:08:36] little notes that are in there that this
[1:08:38] book is is introducing people to the end
[1:08:43] of all things the the introducing to the
[1:08:45] conclusion which is this man Christ and
[1:08:48] it's not about boiling a
[1:08:52] goat it's not about keeping the law
[1:08:56] law it shows here's
[1:08:59] why this is the ultimate
[1:09:04] goal the
[1:09:06] theme of the
[1:09:10] book
[1:09:12] is well brother brandom said it was to
[1:09:16] separate the
[1:09:18] prophets from Jesus they're
[1:09:21] different and as I get through this
[1:09:24] first chapter you will see that they are
[1:09:27] very very different people and as I said
[1:09:30] Hebrews it's it's a sermon it's it's not
[1:09:32] a letter it doesn't doesn't sound like
[1:09:34] anything else really written in the
[1:09:36] Bible it's the theme as I said the first
[1:09:39] part is to separate Jesus from the
[1:09:42] prophets and the angels and we see in
[1:09:45] the entire Old Testament there's a cry
[1:09:47] out from God for the people to live
[1:09:49] righteously and to come into fellowship
[1:09:51] with God but he is a holy God and His
[1:09:55] presence is Holy nothing un unclean can
[1:09:58] come into His presence from the fall in
[1:10:01] the Garden of Eden and Moses on Mount
[1:10:03] siai where the people didn't want to
[1:10:05] hear God speak they chose a man to
[1:10:07] mediate for
[1:10:08] them and it's always been the desire of
[1:10:11] God to
[1:10:12] Fellowship directly with his people and
[1:10:16] it has been their their his desire
[1:10:20] always let's say this before we get into
[1:10:23] Hebrews one
[1:10:26] thing that I see not just in our circles
[1:10:30] but especially in our
[1:10:32] circles the enemy is trying to fool
[1:10:37] us into not Desiring the baptism of the
[1:10:40] Holy
[1:10:42] Spirit and it's you're special you have
[1:10:45] a special Revelation you're the elite
[1:10:48] you're the bride you're all of these
[1:10:50] things and what does it do it pulls away
[1:10:53] that burning desire to fall down at the
[1:10:55] altar and to give your heart to the Lord
[1:10:58] Jesus and to say Lord fill me with that
[1:11:01] spirit and this book of Hebrews it's
[1:11:05] introducing that spirit and that Messiah
[1:11:09] to these people they had already had a
[1:11:11] little Foundation but now Paul is or
[1:11:13] whoever the author of this is saying
[1:11:16] that now I'm going to show you that this
[1:11:20] is actually the conclusion of all
[1:11:23] things this is what you've been praying
[1:11:25] for this is what the goat and the pot
[1:11:27] this is what it's about the scapegoat in
[1:11:30] the in I believe it's in Leviticus when
[1:11:32] they send out one goat and they keep the
[1:11:34] other and kill that one it's about
[1:11:37] Christ the whole Book of Leviticus every
[1:11:40] single sacrifice every single offering
[1:11:42] is about Jesus this is the conclusion of
[1:11:46] all
[1:11:50] things Hebrews
[1:11:53] 1 watch how he introduces this God who
[1:11:57] at Sund drry times and in diverse manner
[1:11:59] spake in times past unto the fathers by
[1:12:01] the prophets hath in these last days
[1:12:05] spoken unto us by his
[1:12:07] son whom he hath appointed heir of All
[1:12:10] Things by whom also he made the worlds
[1:12:13] who being in the brightness of his glory
[1:12:17] and the express image of his person and
[1:12:19] upholding All Things by the word of his
[1:12:21] power when he had by himself purged our
[1:12:24] sins sat down on the right hand of the
[1:12:26] Majesty on high that is the conclusion
[1:12:28] of the
[1:12:29] matter the
[1:12:31] letter gets right to the
[1:12:34] point as I said this is a sermon and
[1:12:37] it's one of the most powerful sermons
[1:12:38] ever preached back to verse one God who
[1:12:41] at Sund drry times and in diverse
[1:12:43] manners spake in times past unto the
[1:12:45] fathers by the prophets saying God who
[1:12:47] in old times and in many ways spoke in
[1:12:50] the past to the fathers to our ancestors
[1:12:54] by the prophets remember the story on
[1:12:56] Mount
[1:12:58] Si where they were there were thundering
[1:13:01] and smoke and it was given to Moses the
[1:13:03] Ten Commandments and the people were
[1:13:05] afraid they didn't want to approach
[1:13:08] God so they cried out let Moses the
[1:13:11] prophets speak and not God lest they die
[1:13:14] the author is saying that God spoke to
[1:13:16] the in the past through their ancestors
[1:13:19] by the prophet but now they have the
[1:13:22] opportunity for him to speak directly to
[1:13:24] them
[1:13:26] hath in last hath in these last days
[1:13:28] spoken unto us by his
[1:13:32] son whom he hath appointed heir of all
[1:13:34] things and by whom also he made the
[1:13:36] worlds now the author is raising the
[1:13:38] stakes this is a
[1:13:40] man he's saying that you have heard is
[1:13:43] the Messiah but he's more than a
[1:13:44] deliverer as you've been taught he's
[1:13:47] more than a prophet like Moses he's
[1:13:51] God's own son this is what is being
[1:13:54] introduced by the author
[1:13:55] to these Hebrew people John 3:16 Says
[1:13:59] for God so loved the world that he gave
[1:14:00] his only begotten son that whosoever
[1:14:02] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:14:04] have everlasting life for God sent not
[1:14:07] his son into the world to condemn the
[1:14:08] world but that the world through him
[1:14:11] might be
[1:14:14] saved back to
[1:14:16] Hebrews verse three who being in the
[1:14:19] brightness of his glory and the express
[1:14:21] image of his person and upholding All
[1:14:24] Things by the word of his power when he
[1:14:27] had by himself purged our sins sat down
[1:14:29] on the right hand of the Majesty on high
[1:14:31] being made so much better than the
[1:14:33] Angels you'll see a theme as we get
[1:14:36] through Hebrews he was better he was
[1:14:38] better than the prophets he was better
[1:14:39] than the angels He was better than men
[1:14:41] he just better he was everything about
[1:14:42] him was
[1:14:44] better as he by as he hath by
[1:14:47] inheritance obtained a more excellent
[1:14:49] Name than they for under which of the
[1:14:50] Angels said he at any time Thou Art my
[1:14:53] son this day have I begotten thee and
[1:14:56] again I will be a to him a father and he
[1:15:00] shall be to me a son he's quoting
[1:15:03] scriptures there were a lot of Angels in
[1:15:05] the Old Testament as we all know Isaiah
[1:15:08] heard the seraphim singing Holy Holy
[1:15:11] Holy the the burners that that had the
[1:15:13] fire of God the angel that came to Jacob
[1:15:16] and wrestled with him all night the
[1:15:18] death angel that came to Egypt when
[1:15:21] Moses was there and killed all the
[1:15:23] firstborn the archangel Michael and
[1:15:25] Gabriel they're all through the Bible
[1:15:28] and the people they started lifting the
[1:15:31] Angels up almost like they were God and
[1:15:33] some of them even worshiped the Angels
[1:15:36] like
[1:15:38] God Scofield's comments if you have a
[1:15:41] skolfield Bible says this the Old
[1:15:44] Testament expression the angel of the
[1:15:46] Lord usually expresses deity in Angelic
[1:15:50] form so you can see how much these
[1:15:53] angels meant to these people so the
[1:15:56] author is saying that this man who came
[1:15:58] he's not like an angel he's far greater
[1:16:01] than that for unto which verse five for
[1:16:03] under which of the Angels said he at any
[1:16:05] time Thou Art my son this day have I
[1:16:08] begotten thee and again I will be a
[1:16:09] father to him a father and he shall be
[1:16:11] to me a
[1:16:12] son and again when he bringeth the first
[1:16:15] begotten into the world he saith and let
[1:16:17] all the angels of God worship him so
[1:16:19] these
[1:16:21] angels that were basically deity Angelic
[1:16:24] form
[1:16:25] they are also worshiping this man he is
[1:16:28] so great he is even worthy of the
[1:16:31] worship of a sinless
[1:16:34] angel so the author again he's
[1:16:37] separating Jesus from the prophets he's
[1:16:39] SE separating Jesus from the
[1:16:43] angels and the angels and of the angels
[1:16:46] He saith who maketh his angels spirits
[1:16:49] and his ministers a flame of fire but
[1:16:51] under the sun he saith thy Throne oh God
[1:16:54] is forever and ever a scepter of
[1:16:57] righteousness is the scepter of thy
[1:17:00] kingdom I want to stop there for a
[1:17:02] minute and we we'll take a little detour
[1:17:04] because I want to teach on this book of
[1:17:07] Hebrews right here the author lifts up
[1:17:11] Christ to God he says thy Throne oh God
[1:17:15] is
[1:17:17] forever I want to talk about
[1:17:20] two um different denominations that are
[1:17:23] in the world today and that's that's
[1:17:24] more ISM and that's um Jehovah
[1:17:27] Witness now both of
[1:17:30] these Michael I hope that you're not
[1:17:32] either one of
[1:17:34] them but if you are you'll
[1:17:37] learn um the
[1:17:41] uh the
[1:17:43] translations the King James was was
[1:17:46] translated and it's usually that I read
[1:17:49] in this church it's but it's 500 years
[1:17:52] old the English is our English has
[1:17:54] changed since and and many of the words
[1:17:56] don't mean the same that's why I
[1:17:57] sometimes mention other
[1:17:59] translations um just the way we speak my
[1:18:02] my favorite is the King James it's
[1:18:04] beautiful it's very poetic and and it's
[1:18:07] just beautiful the way that it's written
[1:18:08] I believe it is per perfectly accurate
[1:18:11] but our language may not be as perfectly
[1:18:13] accurate as the King James is um so I
[1:18:17] also mentioned the English Standard
[1:18:18] Version it's a little bit more literal
[1:18:21] translation than even the king Jame
[1:18:23] James is the NIV the NLT um and the new
[1:18:28] King James they're all different
[1:18:29] translations but I want to mention
[1:18:33] how the Mormons do and what they what
[1:18:38] they do is they they had a
[1:18:40] statement that
[1:18:44] says that they have this Book of Mormon
[1:18:48] they have other holy books that they
[1:18:50] call them and what they do is they put
[1:18:54] these other books over the
[1:18:58] Bible and it says
[1:19:00] this in Joseph Smith's article of fa
[1:19:03] faith for the Mormons it says we believe
[1:19:05] the gift of
[1:19:06] tongues prophecy Revelation Visions
[1:19:09] healing interpretation of tongues and so
[1:19:11] forth we believe the Bible to be the
[1:19:13] word of God as far as it is translated
[1:19:15] correctly we also believe the Book of
[1:19:18] Mormon to be the word of God so when you
[1:19:20] talk with the so right here it says we
[1:19:22] believe the Book of Mormon we believe
[1:19:24] the Bible if if it's translated right so
[1:19:27] what they will tell you is the Bible's
[1:19:29] been translated over and over and over
[1:19:31] again so much of the meaning behind the
[1:19:34] Bible has been Lost in Translation
[1:19:36] because of all the different
[1:19:37] translations that have come forth you
[1:19:39] know that's not true the Bible's only
[1:19:41] been translated once if you look at the
[1:19:44] King James version it was translated
[1:19:47] from the original manuscripts the
[1:19:49] original Greek then the original
[1:19:51] original Hebrew English Standard Version
[1:19:54] was translated from the original Greek
[1:19:57] the original Hebrew they're not
[1:19:58] translated from each other they are
[1:20:00] translated from these original Scrolls
[1:20:02] that were found and these original
[1:20:04] Scrolls in Hebrew and Greek and and
[1:20:07] however the original language was
[1:20:08] written they are almost perfect there
[1:20:12] are
[1:20:13] thousands of Scrolls that they have
[1:20:15] found both in caves and in archaeology
[1:20:18] and they look at these and they all
[1:20:20] almost say exactly the same thing
[1:20:23] sometimes there's a a slip of a pen or
[1:20:25] sometimes there's a um a
[1:20:28] typo but these have been TR these have
[1:20:31] been preserved by the hand of God
[1:20:33] through these men called scribes and
[1:20:35] they were very very careful in how they
[1:20:38] copied each manuscript and then
[1:20:41] distributed them so when someone tells
[1:20:44] you that oh the Bible's been translated
[1:20:46] over and over and over again it hasn't
[1:20:48] it's only been translated once and it
[1:20:50] was translated from the original no
[1:20:52] matter really what Bible that you use
[1:20:54] whether it's a King James the English
[1:20:56] Standard Version the NIV these are
[1:20:58] original documents original translations
[1:21:02] if you translated from German or if you
[1:21:04] took the English and and made it match
[1:21:08] today then then it it would have error
[1:21:10] in it but it doesn't you know you can
[1:21:12] say words you can say things
[1:21:15] differently but that's just
[1:21:17] fundamentally that's that's a wrong
[1:21:19] statement to make and then the Jehovah
[1:21:22] Witness and I'm not
[1:21:25] really trying to pick on anybody but I
[1:21:27] just want to tell you how important it
[1:21:29] is for you to know this word so the
[1:21:32] Jehovah
[1:21:34] Witness they have their own Bible let me
[1:21:38] find it
[1:21:41] here and you know that they deny the
[1:21:43] deity of the Lord
[1:21:47] Jesus and I just read that scripture in
[1:21:50] Hebrews 1
[1:21:52] 18 here's the English Standard Version
[1:21:54] it's says but of the son he says your
[1:21:56] throne oh God is forever and ever the
[1:21:59] scepter of right un the scepter of
[1:22:02] uprightness is the scepter of your
[1:22:04] kingdom just using different words to
[1:22:05] say the exact same thing but the New
[1:22:07] World
[1:22:08] Translation says this but about the son
[1:22:12] he says God is your
[1:22:14] throne forever and ever and the scepter
[1:22:17] of your kingdom is the scepter of
[1:22:19] righteousness they changed the
[1:22:22] Bible the very Bible itself because the
[1:22:26] Jehovah Witness Doctrine does not put
[1:22:28] Jesus as
[1:22:30] Divine so we'll just change it because
[1:22:33] it can't it can't be right because it
[1:22:35] doesn't match our way of thinking so the
[1:22:38] conclusion of the matter for all of
[1:22:40] these churches and all of these
[1:22:41] denominations the conclusion of the
[1:22:43] matter it's not having the word of God
[1:22:45] as the absolute it's having our church
[1:22:48] as the absolute and the way that we
[1:22:49] things see things as the absolute and
[1:22:52] then we will actually take the words of
[1:22:56] God and twist them to make them match
[1:22:59] our doctrines so what is the end of
[1:23:02] things when we try to convert someone
[1:23:05] the end of things is are we converting
[1:23:06] them to a Jehovah Witness
[1:23:08] Doctrine or are we converting them to
[1:23:12] Christ are we trying to get them the to
[1:23:15] think the way we think or we trying to
[1:23:17] get them to speak directly to the Lord
[1:23:22] Jesus tell you the end of all things or
[1:23:25] the conclusion of the matter as it says
[1:23:29] in the Book of
[1:23:32] Ecclesiastes this is the last thing
[1:23:35] William Brandon wrote this is the
[1:23:38] conclusion of his ministry this is a
[1:23:40] conclusion of the matter with him he
[1:23:42] says this in an exposition of the seven
[1:23:45] Church ages he says not for one
[1:23:48] moment do I bring a message that they
[1:23:51] may follow me or join my church or start
[1:23:54] some fellowship and organization I have
[1:23:56] never done that and will not do that now
[1:23:58] I have no interest in those things but I
[1:24:00] do have an interest in the things of God
[1:24:02] and people and if I can accomplish just
[1:24:05] one thing I will be satisfied that one
[1:24:08] thing is to see established a true
[1:24:10] relationship between God and Men wherein
[1:24:13] men become New Creations in Christ
[1:24:15] filled with his spirit and live
[1:24:17] according to his word I would invite
[1:24:19] plead and warn all to hear his voice at
[1:24:21] this time and yield your lives
[1:24:24] completely to him even as I trust in my
[1:24:26] heart that I have given my all to him
[1:24:29] God bless you and may you rejoice and
[1:24:32] may his coming Rejoice your heart look
[1:24:34] at the similar similarities of brother
[1:24:37] brandham and that book he even titled
[1:24:40] the Ser even titled a sermon Christ is
[1:24:42] the mystery of God revealed look at the
[1:24:44] similarities there it's the same Spirit
[1:24:47] he's trying to get the people to come to
[1:24:49] the Lord Jesus but then what do the
[1:24:51] people do they make pots and pans and
[1:24:55] separate them and he says you're the
[1:24:57] Lord's says you don't get it it's all
[1:25:00] about
[1:25:02] Christ it's all about this dialogue
[1:25:05] between us and the Lord Jesus the
[1:25:08] conclusion of the matter of the book of
[1:25:11] Hebrews is that Christ is exalted to the
[1:25:13] throne of God not through a denomination
[1:25:16] not through a church and not through
[1:25:17] their understanding of the
[1:25:19] law back to verse eight but unto the son
[1:25:23] he saith thy throne oh God is forever
[1:25:25] and ever a scepter of righteousness is
[1:25:27] the scepter of thy
[1:25:31] kingdom thou Hast loved righteousness
[1:25:33] and hated iniquity therefore God even
[1:25:36] thy God hath anointed thee with the oil
[1:25:38] of gladness above thy fellows and thou
[1:25:41] Lord in the beginning has laid the
[1:25:43] foundation of the earth and the heavens
[1:25:45] are the works of thy hands they Shall
[1:25:47] Perish but thou remainest and they shall
[1:25:49] all wax old as doth a garment and as a
[1:25:53] vesture shalt thou fold them up and they
[1:25:55] shall be changed but Thou Art the same
[1:25:58] and thy years shall not fail later on in
[1:26:01] the book of Hebrews we'll read that
[1:26:03] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and
[1:26:05] today and forever and he's saying that
[1:26:07] all these things we see around us will
[1:26:09] pass away our clothes will wear out and
[1:26:11] we'll get new clothes and the church
[1:26:13] will one day this church will one day
[1:26:16] it'll be reduced to
[1:26:18] dust it's going to it's it's one day it
[1:26:22] will be it's not eternal
[1:26:24] etal it'll burn like everything else
[1:26:27] will burn but this God is the same and
[1:26:30] he never changes and this man Jesus
[1:26:33] Christ this author is saying that you
[1:26:35] have been introduced as the Messiah he
[1:26:37] is God in human
[1:26:40] flesh and the whole book continues on
[1:26:44] about that and we'll close if the
[1:26:45] musicians can come verse 13 but to which
[1:26:48] of the Angels said he at any time sit on
[1:26:51] my right hand until I make thine enemies
[1:26:53] thy foot stol are they not all
[1:26:56] ministering Spirits sent forth to
[1:26:57] minister for them who shall be Heirs of
[1:27:00] Salvation chapter two therefore we ought
[1:27:04] to give the most Earnest the more
[1:27:05] Earnest heed to the things which we have
[1:27:08] heard lest at any time we shall let them
[1:27:10] slip these people had heard that the
[1:27:12] Messiah was coming and now the author
[1:27:14] that is saying that you should give the
[1:27:16] most Earnest heed to these things that
[1:27:18] you have heard that's why coming
[1:27:20] together is important that's why
[1:27:22] worshiping together is important later
[1:27:24] in the book that we say that we should
[1:27:26] not neglect our assembling together as
[1:27:28] the manner of some is but we encourage
[1:27:31] one another especially as we see the day
[1:27:33] approaching we should take this word the
[1:27:37] author is saying more
[1:27:43] seriously it's more than life and death
[1:27:47] it's Heaven and
[1:27:49] Hell I know that a lot of churches don't
[1:27:51] talk about hell because oh it's a I
[1:27:55] Jesus let me tell you something you
[1:27:57] probably didn't know Jesus talked more
[1:27:59] about hell than he did
[1:28:01] Heaven Jesus Christ did there is a hell
[1:28:06] there is a
[1:28:09] punishment and the Lord does not want us
[1:28:12] there remember I've said
[1:28:15] before that Jesus voted for
[1:28:19] me Satan voted against me and now I have
[1:28:23] the deciding vote who I'm going to vote
[1:28:25] am I going to take my way with Jesus or
[1:28:28] am I going to take my way with Satan for
[1:28:31] if the word spoken by Angels was
[1:28:33] steadfast and every transgression and
[1:28:36] Disobedience received a just Rec
[1:28:38] recompense of reward how shall we escape
[1:28:42] if we neglect so great salvation which
[1:28:45] at the first began to be spoken by the
[1:28:47] Lord and was confirmed unto us by them
[1:28:50] that heard them so the
[1:28:52] author here here he's like
[1:28:56] us he was not present when Jesus was in
[1:28:59] flesh this is confirmed by when he
[1:29:02] says it's confirmed To Us by them that
[1:29:06] heard him so the author here is a
[1:29:09] convert to
[1:29:10] Christ probably and he says right here
[1:29:13] through the witness really of someone
[1:29:16] else God also bearing them witness both
[1:29:18] with signs and wonders and with diverse
[1:29:21] Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:23] according to to his own
[1:29:25] will so how can we neglect how can we
[1:29:29] escape if we neglect so great a
[1:29:30] Salvation that was proven by signs
[1:29:34] proven by wonders with many miracles and
[1:29:37] many gifts of the Holy Ghost according
[1:29:39] to the will of God I'm going to take a
[1:29:42] couple
[1:29:43] minutes in
[1:29:46] closing I just say
[1:29:50] that the prophets are
[1:29:52] fouble the prophets make mistakes every
[1:29:55] one of them does every single one did
[1:29:59] that's why this book of Hebrews was
[1:30:00] written to
[1:30:02] separate Christ from the
[1:30:07] men and to separate Christ even from
[1:30:10] angels He was greater he was better than
[1:30:13] all of these but I hear so much
[1:30:16] criticism
[1:30:17] today it's on the
[1:30:20] internet criticizing
[1:30:25] men of God that mean very much to
[1:30:28] us criticizing William
[1:30:32] brandham saying
[1:30:35] that that he
[1:30:37] lied that he was a charlatan that he he
[1:30:40] did all of all of this evil stuff and
[1:30:44] the the author right here says God also
[1:30:48] bearing them witness with signs and
[1:30:50] wonders and diverse Miracles and Gifts
[1:30:52] of the Holy Ghost according to his
[1:30:56] will and then we want to attack this
[1:30:59] man's
[1:31:01] reputation did he make mistakes did he
[1:31:05] exaggerate did he all the do all these
[1:31:07] things I don't care I really don't care
[1:31:10] what I know is God was with
[1:31:12] him and that love that he
[1:31:16] produced is what I want that
[1:31:19] relationship that he had is what I want
[1:31:26] Doug mugh how many people know Doug
[1:31:31] McHugh Perry green how many people knew
[1:31:33] Perry
[1:31:34] [Music]
[1:31:35] green Carl wheeler my
[1:31:39] grandfather Welch Evans I don't know
[1:31:41] maybe the Marriott you did God bless you
[1:31:43] sister glidewell and brother
[1:31:46] Rome these people were
[1:31:49] Witnesses was it Perry green that saw
[1:31:52] the eyes formed in the sockets
[1:31:54] Doug McHugh was
[1:31:56] there had cancer in his
[1:32:00] eye had dark sunglasses
[1:32:03] on brother brandom told them not only
[1:32:06] you have a you have this this thing in
[1:32:08] your eye that's going to cause you to go
[1:32:10] blind I don't know if it was a cancer he
[1:32:11] called it an allergy but you're going
[1:32:13] blind he said I saw you at the doctor
[1:32:16] and the doctor said that and further
[1:32:18] your mother has tumors on her
[1:32:22] feet how did he know that
[1:32:25] he said go home your mother will be
[1:32:26] healed and you are healed in the name of
[1:32:29] Jesus
[1:32:30] Christ that is a
[1:32:33] sign my grandfather Evans I've told you
[1:32:36] the story he was bitten by a rattlesnake
[1:32:39] his foot swelling and all of these the
[1:32:42] these pains going through him brother
[1:32:44] brandham laid his hands on him and
[1:32:46] almost as soon as he laid his hands on
[1:32:48] him he was healed in the name of Jesus
[1:32:50] Christ Miracle after miracle
[1:32:55] my other grandfather was healed of
[1:32:57] stomach problems when he went down there
[1:32:59] and the prophet discerned him and said
[1:33:01] here is what your problem is these signs
[1:33:04] and these wonders they were real they
[1:33:06] came to show us that God is real that he
[1:33:09] is alive that he could do whatever we
[1:33:12] have need of but we have to know the
[1:33:14] conclusion of the matter which is to
[1:33:16] come to Jesus Christ don't get caught up
[1:33:20] in pots and
[1:33:22] pans come to Jesus Christ that is the
[1:33:25] conclusion of the matter that's what the
[1:33:27] whole book is about and this book of
[1:33:30] Hebrews I can't wait to dig into it
[1:33:32] further because more and more it talks
[1:33:34] about how God manifested himself the
[1:33:38] father in the son for our salvation and
[1:33:41] that now we can receive his Spirit prise
[1:33:45] God this book of Hebrews is a
[1:33:48] masterpiece and I'm so looking
[1:33:51] forward to teaching on it I'm looking
[1:33:54] forward to learning about it I'm looking
[1:33:55] forward to
[1:33:57] worshiping and let me say once
[1:34:01] again how shall we verse three how shall
[1:34:05] we
[1:34:06] escape if we neglect so great salvation
[1:34:10] which at the first began to be spoken by
[1:34:13] the Lord and was confirmed unto us by
[1:34:15] them that heard him how can we
[1:34:19] neglect God also bearing them
[1:34:22] witness was with signs and wonders and
[1:34:24] diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy
[1:34:27] Ghost according to his
[1:34:29] will it's real God is real and he sends
[1:34:34] ministers he sends prophets he sends
[1:34:38] gifts on Earth to manifest himself to
[1:34:41] draw people to him and
[1:34:45] not to something
[1:34:47] else not to some intellectual
[1:34:50] understanding if you
[1:34:52] learn God God through an intellectual
[1:34:55] understanding you can be pulled away
[1:34:57] from God through an intellectual
[1:35:00] understanding you must know him in his
[1:35:02] spirit I must know him in his Spirit he
[1:35:05] is Everything Jesus Christ is the
[1:35:08] conclusion of the matter let me
[1:35:11] read verse one again chapter 1 verse one
[1:35:16] I can quote it God who at suy times and
[1:35:20] in diverse manners spake in time past
[1:35:24] by the prophets hath in these last days
[1:35:28] spoken to us by his
[1:35:31] son whom he made heir of all things and
[1:35:33] by whom also he created the world he did
[1:35:36] everything by this man Jesus Christ he
[1:35:40] is the conclusion of the matter and the
[1:35:43] whole Ministry should get us to that
[1:35:48] conclusion and get us away from The
[1:35:52] World God loves loved the people and he
[1:35:55] gave these commandments so they didn't
[1:35:57] mix with the world so they didn't
[1:35:58] weren't influenced by the world but what
[1:36:01] did they do they washed pots and pans
[1:36:04] and
[1:36:06] sinned that is not the
[1:36:10] intent Jesus said he says I didn't come
[1:36:13] to do away with the
[1:36:15] law I came to fulfill the
[1:36:18] law it all comes down to Jesus Christ
[1:36:24] I love him do you love
[1:36:27] him brothers and sisters if I could do
[1:36:31] anything if the Lord would allow
[1:36:34] me one thing in my
[1:36:37] life if I could truly help develop a
[1:36:42] relationship between the people in this
[1:36:45] room and Jesus Christ even if it's just
[1:36:48] one if it's just one it's worth more
[1:36:50] than 10,000
[1:36:52] worlds and my life would be
[1:36:54] [Music]
[1:36:55] complete the conclusion of the
[1:36:58] matter is Jesus Christ is the
[1:37:02] Fulfillment of this book and he is alive
[1:37:05] today he's not dead he heals the sick he
[1:37:09] raises the Dead the gospel has the
[1:37:12] gospel preached to the
[1:37:14] poor he is the king of kings the Lord of
[1:37:17] lords the Mighty
[1:37:19] God it's
[1:37:21] Him worship Him and don't neglect what
[1:37:25] you've
[1:37:25] heard because there is salvation
[1:37:29] there we love the Lord we love his
[1:37:32] servants and let me tell you I am sick

[1:37:53] ministers will get up there and say oh

[1:38:01] Rome your mistakes don't matter mine

[1:42:25] Salvation we have truly seen great
[1:42:28] things in this age and I want to make
[1:42:32] sure when we get to Hebrews chap 13
[1:42:36] verse 8 it says that Jesus Christ is the
[1:42:39] same yesterday today and forever the
[1:42:44] same
[1:42:45] God that Barry green saw the same God
[1:42:49] that Welch Evans Saw the same God that
[1:42:51] Doug McHugh saw
[1:42:54] same God that Carl wheeler saw is the
[1:42:56] same God that is with us
[1:42:59] today and he changes not and his name is
[1:43:05] Jesus he came to Earth in the
[1:43:09] flesh and he led captivity captive and
[1:43:12] he gave gifts to Men He gave gifts to
[1:43:17] us and we should have the faith that God
[1:43:21] will answer our prayers just as he
[1:43:23] answered the prayers of others in the
[1:43:26] past so brothers and
[1:43:28] sisters as you go
[1:43:31] today think about the power of God and
[1:43:35] think about how the conclusion of the
[1:43:38] matter this is the
[1:43:41] matter this
[1:43:43] is everything the conclusion of
[1:43:47] everything is Jesus Christ he did it he
[1:43:52] is
[1:43:53] everything he's our Lord he's our savior
[1:43:56] he's our healer and he is alive brother
[1:43:59] Dan he's alive today and he loves us
[1:44:02] let's all bow our

[1:44:27] [Music]

[1:46:04] desire to serve God and the desire to
[1:46:07] have that relationship and the desire
