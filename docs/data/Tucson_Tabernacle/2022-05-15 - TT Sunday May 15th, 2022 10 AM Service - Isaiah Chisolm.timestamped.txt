[47:58] the healing of the soul
[48:00] is the greatest
[48:01] healing there could be
[48:03] how many appreciate god has done that
[48:05] for you and if he's done it for you then
[48:07] you desire for others also
[48:10] my daughter elizabeth
[48:12] i've been sick for a few days now and
[48:15] also my sister-in-law
[48:16] elizabeth
[48:18] and uh asked prayer
[48:20] [Music]
[48:23] so
[48:26] and brother
[48:26] [Music]
[48:28] ed douglas asking
[48:30] our prayer for their granddaughter
[48:32] evelyn too
[48:34] not feeling well so
[48:36] i know there's quite a bit of needs but
[48:37] we also have a god who answers brother
[48:39] robert chico and says i want to give god
[48:42] the honor and the glory for a good
[48:44] report
[48:45] from the eye doctors you know he just
[48:46] recently had surgery so
[48:49] also he says received a good report for
[48:53] from his primary doctor for overall
[48:55] health and
[48:57] i get a good report from my primary
[48:59] doctor every time he says i am the lord
[49:00] god that healeth all your diseases
[49:03] sometimes you know there's no nothing
[49:05] wrong going to see the doctor
[49:08] but he's the doctor of doctors and king
[49:10] kings and lord of lords so if you'll
[49:12] stand with me
[49:14] i say lord i have a need
[49:17] there's something that maybe i can't
[49:19] figure out maybe
[49:21] and sometimes a symptom is there but
[49:23] you're not sure what's the cause but god
[49:25] does know
[49:26] so let's just believe that lord as we
[49:30] for some maybe would think is it i'm
[49:32] going to raise my hand again is it seems
[49:34] like sometimes maybe i don't get the
[49:36] answer but lord by faith we raise our
[49:38] hands and
[49:39] we say lord we're committing it to you
[49:41] this morning
[49:43] for by thy stripes we are healed lord
[49:45] it's a finished work
[49:48] it's not something that we work to try
[49:50] to achieve but something that you've
[49:51] already provided lord have let us have
[49:54] that faith this morning to just reach
[49:56] out and take hold of it like that that
[49:58] woman said if i can but touch the hem of
[50:00] his garment i shall receive
[50:02] lord may we be that way this morning you
[50:05] know the need the
[50:06] mental need the physical need the
[50:08] spiritual need maybe some emotions and
[50:11] and changes in life that is hard to go
[50:13] through lord but
[50:14] lord it's all covered under that perfect
[50:16] sacrifice this morning lord and we just
[50:18] thank you for that
[50:20] thank you for your grace and mercy this
[50:22] morning lord
[50:23] in jesus christ's name we pray amen you
[50:26] may be seated thank you
[50:27] [Music]
[50:29] it's good to be in the house of the lord
[50:30] this morning
[50:33] you know
[50:35] sometimes maybe on a sunday morning it's
[50:37] your only day of rest and you think well
[50:39] i think i'll just rest today
[50:42] but our our home this our place is a
[50:44] house of rest
[50:46] rest for the soul and he can also touch
[50:48] the physical body so
[50:50] i appreciate that so
[50:53] this morning our brother isaiah
[50:55] chisholm down from
[50:56] north carolina and he was here what
[50:59] about two years ago or so somewhere
[51:01] about there and if you remember it was
[51:03] wonderful service
[51:05] but you know god said he would be here
[51:08] and that's what we're depending on
[51:10] i'm talking him a little bit with our
[51:12] brother isaiah and he said you know you
[51:13] put your notes out you get everything
[51:15] but you let god
[51:16] begin to channel himself
[51:18] and he can go and the minister can be
[51:20] ministering and then something will take
[51:22] him over that way
[51:24] because someone on that side needs
[51:25] something then it'll pull him this way
[51:28] then he might go back to his notes and
[51:29] then something else because
[51:31] you're operating the gift of the
[51:33] minister this
[51:35] amen so
[51:37] how many has a need
[51:38] to hear something for your soul today
[51:42] lord i just need that comfort i
[51:44] reading a quote or something that
[51:45] somebody posted and they said talking
[51:47] about that sacrifice
[51:49] that perfect sacrifice he said that
[51:52] every need is supplied you know
[51:55] it's he looks at us and and and
[51:57] sometimes even the scripture this
[51:59] morning you and maybe on your phone or
[52:01] the opening nap and there's a scripture
[52:04] and and it just speaks to your heart
[52:06] and and maybe you had a troubled night
[52:08] or maybe you're you're battling with
[52:09] some and you open the scripture on your
[52:11] phone on your ipad or in your open the
[52:14] bible whatever it is and the scripture
[52:16] you fall on just just ministers to you
[52:19] right then and there but that perfect
[52:21] sacrifice he says a god a just god a
[52:24] holy god how could we enter into his
[52:26] presence
[52:27] but he turns and he sees that sacrifice
[52:30] and he counts you worthy because you've
[52:32] accepted that sacrifice therefore you
[52:34] can enter into his presence and that's
[52:37] how we come this morning so

[1:02:38] corinthian the 10th chapter
[1:02:50] amen the
[1:02:51] uh the 10th chapter
[1:02:53] and uh
[1:02:56] i got it on my tablet this morning so if
[1:02:58] i miss a word uh we're going to blame it
[1:03:01] on the tablet it didn't print it up
[1:03:03] there right so i could see it a little
[1:03:05] better and man it'll be 62 in a little
[1:03:08] bit brother one and you know i know what
[1:03:10] you feel like amen so we just love the
[1:03:13] lord amen uh first corinthians
[1:03:17] the 10th chapter
[1:03:19] and we begin to read from
[1:03:24] 1
[1:03:25] and we read down to
[1:03:27] verse 12.
[1:03:28] and it reads
[1:03:30] moreover brotherings i would not that ye
[1:03:33] shall be ignorant
[1:03:35] how that all of our father were under
[1:03:37] the cloud and all pass through
[1:03:41] the sea
[1:03:43] were all
[1:03:45] baptized unto moses
[1:03:47] in the cloud and in the sea
[1:03:51] and did all eat the same spiritual meat
[1:03:58] and did all drank the same spiritual
[1:04:00] drink for they drank
[1:04:03] of that spiritual rock that followed
[1:04:05] them
[1:04:06] and that rock was christ
[1:04:10] but with many of them
[1:04:13] god was not well pleased for they were
[1:04:16] overthrown in the wilderness
[1:04:20] now these things were our example to the
[1:04:23] intent that we should not lush after
[1:04:26] evil
[1:04:28] things
[1:04:29] as
[1:04:30] they also lusted
[1:04:32] neither
[1:04:34] verse 10
[1:04:35] neither
[1:04:37] mummer ye as some of them also mumbered
[1:04:41] and was destroyed
[1:04:43] of
[1:04:44] the destroyer
[1:04:46] verse 11.
[1:04:48] now all these things happen
[1:04:50] unto them
[1:04:52] for an example
[1:04:55] that are
[1:04:56] written for our ammunation
[1:04:59] upon whom the end
[1:05:01] of the world
[1:05:03] are come verse 12 wherefore let him that
[1:05:07] thinketh
[1:05:08] he standeth
[1:05:10] take heed
[1:05:11] lest he fall
[1:05:15] so we're depending on the lord this
[1:05:17] morning amen
[1:05:18] let us by heads father we thank you lord
[1:05:21] jesus for the reading of your word now
[1:05:24] sanctified lord jesus to our soul in

[1:05:38] happy uh to know that god is still
[1:05:41] keeping me he's watching over me amen he
[1:05:44] keeping my mind stared on him i got
[1:05:48] peace in my soul i got rest in my soul
[1:05:51] man the sabbath is in my soul amen i got
[1:05:54] peace this morning amen that compasses
[1:05:58] all understanding this morning how many
[1:06:00] you got that joy
[1:06:01] amen this morning that on amen we love
[1:06:05] the lord this morning and my thought
[1:06:07] this morning if i could just take my
[1:06:10] time you pray with me my my thought this
[1:06:12] morning is
[1:06:14] what more
[1:06:15] can god do
[1:06:17] what more
[1:06:18] can god
[1:06:20] do amen
[1:06:21] now
[1:06:22] we we see amen i let me read something
[1:06:26] here amen and and
[1:06:29] and also if you will
[1:06:31] uh we look in
[1:06:33] numbers let's go to numbers the 14th
[1:06:36] chapter and we'll look at
[1:06:38] verse one and we'll go back and we just
[1:06:41] work with that amen if the lord would
[1:06:43] allow us and as i begin to look a man
[1:06:48] traveling to different places we see so
[1:06:51] many fallen by the wayside
[1:06:54] churches are cooling off uh there's all
[1:06:57] kind of excuses now people don't hardly
[1:06:59] come to church anymore and but they love
[1:07:02] the lord and they're in the message and
[1:07:05] they got the holy ghost and they're
[1:07:07] filled with the holy ghost but it seemed
[1:07:09] like something is it's wrong amen so i
[1:07:13] just want to share this with you
[1:07:15] and hoping that it will show us the time
[1:07:19] that we are living in and we look at
[1:07:22] uh numbers the 14th chapter and it reads
[1:07:27] uh and it reads the first verse it and
[1:07:30] it said and all the congregation
[1:07:34] lift up their voice and cried
[1:07:38] and the people
[1:07:39] wept
[1:07:40] that night
[1:07:43] amen
[1:07:44] now
[1:07:45] amen
[1:07:47] now you know
[1:07:49] it's it's a thing
[1:07:51] you know how the children of israel how
[1:07:54] they came out of egypt that's right
[1:07:58] so we know that the prophet told us that
[1:08:01] egypt is a type of the world
[1:08:03] or an organization
[1:08:06] can you go there
[1:08:07] so
[1:08:08] we we see the importance of
[1:08:11] amen so i i told my wife i was going to
[1:08:14] minister on but my thought this morning
[1:08:16] is what more can he do
[1:08:19] and just look this morning what more can
[1:08:23] god do
[1:08:25] he woke us up this morning we have the
[1:08:28] right mind you was able to drive you was
[1:08:30] able to walk you was able to eat your
[1:08:33] own breakfast you was able to take your
[1:08:35] own pill you was able to do all those
[1:08:38] things
[1:08:39] god gave you health and strength god let
[1:08:42] the blood still running warm in your
[1:08:44] vain there's no tubes attached to you
[1:08:47] what more can god do
[1:08:50] amen god has laid the foundation god has
[1:08:54] given you eternal life amen god has
[1:08:58] given us the holy ghost what more can he
[1:09:02] do
[1:09:03] with the holy ghost you ought to be the
[1:09:04] most happiest people on the faith of
[1:09:08] this earth you ought to be sitting
[1:09:10] participating on a body change when you
[1:09:14] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:09:16] what more can he do
[1:09:18] you ought to walk around
[1:09:20] happy
[1:09:21] you ought to walk around you should be
[1:09:24] sad amen and that's the way i feel with
[1:09:27] the holy ghost i know that one moment
[1:09:29] i'm going to be changed in a moment of a
[1:09:32] twinkling of an eye
[1:09:34] there's bad days there's sad days but
[1:09:37] what why should i cry there's nothing
[1:09:40] out of cater all things work together to
[1:09:42] the good to them that love the lord why
[1:09:45] should i cry
[1:09:47] why should i complain because things
[1:09:49] don't go the way i want why should i do
[1:09:52] those things i should be happy
[1:09:56] you know i work at the hospital a matter
[1:09:58] of fact we are we are building a
[1:10:01] hospital an addition onto the hospital
[1:10:04] and in that hospital sometime
[1:10:06] uh i i goes down the hallway for the
[1:10:08] first time going down the hallway with
[1:10:11] the guys we have construction with a
[1:10:13] hard hat on all of a sudden i noticed
[1:10:16] the guys everybody taking their hat off
[1:10:18] and everybody kind of get to the wall
[1:10:20] and bow their their heads so this is my
[1:10:22] first time i didn't realize what was
[1:10:24] going on
[1:10:25] there was bringing a body through
[1:10:32] and i just stood there and i just look
[1:10:35] i said why should i complain
[1:10:38] you know
[1:10:40] we complain about this
[1:10:42] we complain but look look at us this
[1:10:44] morning
[1:10:45] god is so good to us
[1:10:48] every time we breathe out
[1:10:50] god pushes in fresh air even when we're
[1:10:53] upset we're still breathing
[1:10:57] when we're aggravated we're still
[1:11:00] breathing god good
[1:11:02] all night long your heart just tick tick
[1:11:05] tick tick tick all night long won't back
[1:11:09] up you just take it for granted what
[1:11:12] more
[1:11:13] can god do
[1:11:15] god has opened the way
[1:11:17] god has sent
[1:11:18] us a message
[1:11:20] god has given us the eyes that we could
[1:11:22] see
[1:11:23] the end amen amen he sent us a prophet
[1:11:26] that the seven seals has been revealed
[1:11:29] the mighty angel have descended why
[1:11:32] should we be sad when we come to church
[1:11:35] that's what i don't understand
[1:11:38] i don't understand but i do understand
[1:11:43] what more can he do
[1:11:46] he laid the foundation the song says and
[1:11:49] he opened
[1:11:50] up the way what more can he do
[1:11:54] now if you if you notice
[1:11:57] the children of israel
[1:12:00] when they came out of egypt
[1:12:03] when they came out of egypt
[1:12:05] uh there was they didn't realize
[1:12:08] when moses went down to egypt when the
[1:12:11] prophet of god went down to egypt now i
[1:12:14] want you to remember that egypt is a
[1:12:16] type of the world
[1:12:19] or an
[1:12:20] organization now brother browner goes on
[1:12:23] to say that it was egypt he said down in
[1:12:27] egypt it was pentecost a type of
[1:12:30] pentecost now we know that the last
[1:12:33] plague that hit egypt was what death we
[1:12:37] know the last plague that hit the
[1:12:39] nomination amen to pentecost the age it
[1:12:42] was death
[1:12:44] so we are happy to know that god called
[1:12:48] us out but one he called us out so when
[1:12:52] we came out of egypt uh from the world
[1:12:56] some of us probably just born in the
[1:12:58] message but a lot of times people don't
[1:13:01] understand
[1:13:02] there's a process
[1:13:04] and people don't understand and the
[1:13:07] children of israel
[1:13:08] little that they know
[1:13:10] when they came out of egypt they didn't
[1:13:12] know that they had a three day they
[1:13:15] didn't know it was a 40 40-mile journey
[1:13:18] but it only took them about four days
[1:13:21] but because of their unbelief and
[1:13:24] complaining it took them for 40 years or
[1:13:27] so in the wilderness going around some
[1:13:30] people should be much farther in the
[1:13:33] revelation some people should be much
[1:13:35] farther overcoming themselves but they
[1:13:38] are in the wilderness
[1:13:39] going around in circles
[1:13:42] well when they came out of egypt the
[1:13:45] first stage
[1:13:46] a type
[1:13:48] you know
[1:13:49] coming out of egypt
[1:13:51] it was
[1:13:53] that came out of egypt was a type of
[1:13:56] justification
[1:13:59] they came through the red sea
[1:14:02] was a type of what
[1:14:04] ah praise the lord sanctification
[1:14:08] and being in the promised land was a
[1:14:10] type of what
[1:14:12] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:14:14] now we don't want to you know y'all i i
[1:14:17] love the way i love this this morning
[1:14:19] because you you your very knowledge of
[1:14:21] the message and i love that but you
[1:14:23] realize that uh the canaan land was not
[1:14:27] the millennium
[1:14:29] now in the millennium amen there's there
[1:14:33] there's peace amen but people don't
[1:14:36] realize in cana there was wars
[1:14:41] and if you get the holy ghost one time
[1:14:44] you'll see what i'm talking about
[1:14:46] there's going to be trials there's going
[1:14:48] to be trouble amen in canaanland
[1:14:52] but you see the children in israel when
[1:14:54] it came out of egypt three stages of
[1:14:57] their journey
[1:14:59] the earth
[1:15:01] goes through what
[1:15:03] three states you talk back to me preach
[1:15:04] back to me this morning
[1:15:06] don't be afraid i'm actually you shall
[1:15:08] preach back to me
[1:15:09] so the earth goes through what three
[1:15:11] stages
[1:15:13] first amen what's the water doing noah
[1:15:16] day right
[1:15:17] all right so then amen when
[1:15:21] jesus came and shed his blood it was
[1:15:25] sanctification that's right so we know
[1:15:28] the armageddon amen will burn
[1:15:30] the battle of armageddon will do away
[1:15:32] with everything amen and we'll come back
[1:15:35] down and live on this earth now we know
[1:15:37] that a a woman goes through three stages
[1:15:41] and that's why that's right water amen
[1:15:45] blood
[1:15:46] and life amen so we found out that a lot
[1:15:50] of people they try to
[1:15:53] they try to
[1:15:54] come from out of the world they skipped
[1:15:57] over sanctification and they get a
[1:15:59] message book in their hand and they'll
[1:16:00] know about the prophet they get the
[1:16:02] pictures on the wall and they know the
[1:16:04] quote and there's a good quotas amen
[1:16:06] they feel the spirit and they'll say
[1:16:11] and you wonder why
[1:16:12] and you wonder why in exodus when it
[1:16:16] came out of egypt the bible said amen
[1:16:19] there was a mixed multitude that came
[1:16:22] out of egypt and the prophet of god said
[1:16:25] when they came out of egypt said they
[1:16:27] put on their sanders just like the
[1:16:30] israelites are y'all with me so you
[1:16:33] wonder why
[1:16:34] churches are cooling off you wonder why
[1:16:37] you look brown everybody it's not
[1:16:39] everybody are you hearing me
[1:16:42] i realize
[1:16:44] that there's got to be
[1:16:46] a change and i thank god
[1:16:49] he took me through the process
[1:16:52] he brought me from out of the world well
[1:16:56] god justified i was justified as though
[1:16:59] i've never
[1:17:01] done it
[1:17:03] that's right
[1:17:04] he justified me freely and he gave me
[1:17:07] faith to walk in his word
[1:17:11] now am i there yet
[1:17:14] see that's what happened a lot of people
[1:17:16] just get justified they just come from
[1:17:18] out of the world and they come and sit
[1:17:20] in the church and say oh i'm saved oh
[1:17:23] i'm filled with the holy ghost
[1:17:28] i mean look around
[1:17:30] where is everybody
[1:17:33] why churches cooling off
[1:17:36] what more can god do
[1:17:40] what they don't realize people don't
[1:17:41] realize
[1:17:42] that's just the beginning you're going
[1:17:45] through justification but then god
[1:17:48] wanted to take you
[1:17:50] through what
[1:17:52] talk back to me this morning
[1:17:53] sanctification y'all don't be quiet on
[1:17:55] me
[1:17:56] i know we out in the desert but don't be
[1:17:58] quiet on me amen
[1:18:00] so god will take us through a stage of
[1:18:03] sanctification
[1:18:04] and when he sanctifies us he wants to
[1:18:07] cleanse and set aside what for service
[1:18:12] you know and i know you heard this story
[1:18:14] before it's it's almost like
[1:18:17] god uh

[1:18:38] amen and i won't even bring it in the
[1:18:40] house
[1:18:41] i'll clean it up but first of all i
[1:18:44] justified it
[1:18:46] from out of the barnyard and that's what
[1:18:48] happened to a lot of us we just was
[1:18:50] justified and we're thinking that we in
[1:18:53] the promised land no you just come out
[1:18:55] of egypt

[1:23:06] that there are some mothers go through
[1:23:09] justification they go through the water
[1:23:12] to go through the blood but they bring
[1:23:14] forth a still birth
[1:23:19] i don't want to be a still birth
[1:23:22] i don't want to be one that just knows
[1:23:24] the quotes
[1:23:25] i don't want to be one that says amen i
[1:23:28] want to have a life
[1:23:29] church we're getting ready to get out of
[1:23:31] here
[1:23:32] 2 million and a half come out of egypt
[1:23:36] and only two of the original
[1:23:39] went into the promised land that ought
[1:23:41] to tell you something right there i'm
[1:23:44] look why should i complain man i love
[1:23:47] this message with all my heart and just
[1:23:49] loving is not good enough i want it to
[1:23:51] live inside of me
[1:23:53] i won't cry to live inside of me i don't
[1:23:56] want the buzzsaw temple i want the holy
[1:23:58] ghost to take control of me i don't want
[1:24:02] no excuses
[1:24:05] i don't at the brother look i don't i
[1:24:07] want god to clean me to fill me amen
[1:24:11] change my nature
[1:24:13] change my desire my old nature let it be
[1:24:16] done away not too so but true nature
[1:24:19] somebody told brother brown so i got two
[1:24:22] dolls in me
[1:24:24] he said every time that old black dog is
[1:24:26] growling all the time he said what did
[1:24:28] you do he said the dog i feed the most
[1:24:31] so i realized that long will on this
[1:24:34] earth it's going to be sticky
[1:24:37] amen but i thank god for the baptism and
[1:24:39] holy ghost that could calm me down amen
[1:24:42] amen i realize
[1:24:44] we are now
[1:24:46] for the most of us
[1:24:48] we are not in goshen valley
[1:24:51] we are now i'm going ahead of myself we
[1:24:53] are living in the promised land
[1:24:56] if you got the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:24:59] then you are in the promised land now
[1:25:00] i'm going ahead of myself
[1:25:04] lord don't let don't just don't let me
[1:25:07] be sanctified
[1:25:11] but no one if paul asked the question
[1:25:14] paul said he he found a a group of
[1:25:16] baptists that was baptized he asked him
[1:25:19] he said
[1:25:20] have y'all received the holy ghost since
[1:25:23] since you believed they say we had so
[1:25:24] much hair rather than being holy because
[1:25:26] they said well how was y'all baptized
[1:25:29] listen to john baptist and paul had to
[1:25:31] baptize them all over again
[1:25:33] so my question is when did you receive
[1:25:36] the holy ghost
[1:25:38] now i hate to preach that way when did
[1:25:40] you knew that your nature changed you
[1:25:42] don't have the same desire let me tell
[1:25:44] you what somebody said brother children
[1:25:46] i know i've been sanctified you know
[1:25:48] especially as a man this is where i know
[1:25:50] i've been sanctified i know god filled
[1:25:52] me with the holy ghost and you just whoa
[1:25:54] you just passed her tonight you got to
[1:25:56] look at her something is wrong
[1:25:59] can y'all help me preach
[1:26:01] something is wrong when you got to turn
[1:26:03] and you got to follow her something is
[1:26:05] wrong that old nature ain't dead yet
[1:26:08] somebody say amen but i want the holy
[1:26:10] ghost to take full control amen the holy
[1:26:15] ghost give us power to overcome this
[1:26:18] flesh i thank god you should brother
[1:26:20] children why are you preaching that way
[1:26:22] i'm just beginning to realize you could
[1:26:24] have the genuine holy ghost on your
[1:26:28] flesh and still be lost lord i just
[1:26:31] don't want it on my flesh brother but i
[1:26:33] want it in my soul
[1:26:36] we're getting ready to get out of here
[1:26:39] churches are cool and all but i'm not
[1:26:41] cool enough
[1:26:42] that not i'm not cooling off if if
[1:26:44] everybody quit that i said well just for
[1:26:47] me come on this land was a day for me
[1:26:51] the holy ghost was for me can somebody
[1:26:54] say man it was given for me that's why
[1:26:58] when joshua and caleb said we are more
[1:27:02] than able to take the land
[1:27:04] footprint is possession we are living in
[1:27:07] the time church of the going home of the
[1:27:10] church you say i've been hearing that
[1:27:12] for a long time
[1:27:13] let's don't move and complain
[1:27:16] okay can i say something
[1:27:18] i i don't i don't want to deal with uh
[1:27:21] uh
[1:27:23] political and government
[1:27:25] but we're seeing these prophecies taking
[1:27:27] place i think last time i i think i was
[1:27:30] here you know we see things right before
[1:27:32] our eyes just little by little god is
[1:27:35] telling us look i'm getting closer
[1:27:38] get your house in order
[1:27:41] though those busts all temple it's got
[1:27:43] to go
[1:27:45] i mean the lust for the things of the
[1:27:46] world has got to go
[1:27:49] now you look at the children of israel
[1:27:52] let's let's let's look in our bible
[1:27:55] i don't know how i got way down there
[1:27:58] next time coming you might have to put a
[1:27:59] fence up there because i just walk all
[1:28:02] over the place
[1:28:03] you love the lord this morning
[1:28:06] ain't god good
[1:28:09] now let's look in our bibles to
[1:28:11] numbers the 14th chapter and we're gonna
[1:28:14] walk this down amen if god will help us
[1:28:17] this morning if you have the time amen i
[1:28:20] have the time uh
[1:28:21] numbers the 14th chapter and verse one
[1:28:25] and it says and all the congregation
[1:28:28] lift up their voice and cry
[1:28:31] and the people
[1:28:33] whip
[1:28:34] that night
[1:28:37] now my question is
[1:28:39] why was they
[1:28:41] because anybody tell me why was they
[1:28:44] crying
[1:28:46] i mean they came out of egypt
[1:28:49] what was they crying because they they
[1:28:52] missed the whipping of the taskmaster
[1:28:56] was they crying because they wasn't in
[1:28:58] the mud anymore
[1:29:00] making brick why was they crying
[1:29:05] and i wonder
[1:29:06] why people are crying
[1:29:09] while you're worrying
[1:29:11] if god don't fix it nobody can
[1:29:15] sometimes we need to let god have his
[1:29:18] way and just walk and say lord it's in
[1:29:21] your hand
[1:29:22] can somebody say amen
[1:29:25] look at verse two and all the children
[1:29:27] of israel
[1:29:28] mumber against the message
[1:29:31] moses and against aaron
[1:29:33] and the whole congregation
[1:29:36] said unto them would that god we had
[1:29:40] died in the land of egypt
[1:29:42] in other words it's saying i would that
[1:29:44] god we would have died in the world
[1:29:47] coming this stuff here in these message
[1:29:49] church and they they can't get along i
[1:29:52] would to god that we have died in egypt
[1:29:54] that's what he's saying right i'm not
[1:29:56] making this up would that god that we
[1:29:59] had died
[1:30:01] in egypt or would it god that we had
[1:30:04] died in this wilderness
[1:30:07] wherefore has the lord brought us into
[1:30:10] this land to fall by the sword
[1:30:14] that our wives and our children shall be
[1:30:16] in prayer
[1:30:17] where not better for us to return unto
[1:30:20] egypt
[1:30:23] see brother brown says
[1:30:26] people dies but spirit lives on
[1:30:30] i i just i i've seen just recently i i
[1:30:34] know and i'm not calling names if you're
[1:30:36] on the internet you know what i'm
[1:30:37] talking about there's there's folks just
[1:30:39] walking away from the message
[1:30:42] just just walking away
[1:30:44] and and somebody told me
[1:30:47] a brother told me he said when you go
[1:30:49] and preach for me he said don't call the
[1:30:51] prophet name
[1:30:54] he said why
[1:30:56] that's almost like you telling me look

[1:31:01] take care of you you just don't preach
[1:31:02] your homosexual now you'll be all right
[1:31:05] that tells me right there you got one of
[1:31:07] them on the organ you got a big tire
[1:31:10] pails in there there's a reason why you
[1:31:11] don't want me to preach that so to tell
[1:31:14] me not to preach how can i talk about
[1:31:17] getting on the ark without talking about
[1:31:19] noah

[1:31:53] holy spirit

[1:31:57] the message of the hour i believe the
[1:31:59] message of the hour is thus said the
[1:32:01] lord i'm not ashamed to call his name

[1:41:30] christ he was the one that broke those
[1:41:33] seals it was christ it was lamb that
[1:41:36] opened that book amen

[1:42:04] and we're going to invest
[1:42:06] our inheritance and that's what you got
