[21:46] God bless you welcome we appreciate all
[21:49] of our visitors we appreciate the word
[21:52] of God the Bible I want to get right
[21:54] into the Book of Daniel we have three
[21:56] chapters to cover tonight we have um for
[21:59] those visitors we on Wednesday night
[22:01] it's a Bible study we've been going
[22:03] through every book of the Bible I wanted
[22:05] to take some time to dig into this Book
[22:08] of Daniel it's just so interesting it's
[22:10] got so much just meat there so instead
[22:14] of taking one service for the Book of
[22:16] Daniel we're going to take a number of
[22:17] services last week we had chapters one
[22:21] and two introduction to Daniel and uh
[22:25] his his first vision and then we had a
[22:30] um introduction to this man
[22:32] Nebuchadnezzar we we met him in the book
[22:35] of
[22:36] Jeremiah and uh he was a this
[22:38] hot-tempered
[22:42] mean-spirited uh
[22:44] incredibly
[22:46] um uh Adept at
[22:49] War and uh he was he was just he was
[22:52] this very very powerful King and
[22:55] actually at this time he's pretty much
[22:57] ruling the entire en world this man
[23:01] Nebuchadnezzar Daniel interprets tells
[23:05] him his dream and interprets his dream
[23:08] for him Nebuchadnezzar was basically in
[23:13] awe of this man Daniel how can you tell
[23:17] someone not just interpret their dream
[23:19] any of us can take a stab at that but
[23:22] how can you tell someone their dream
[23:25] without even knowing it and that's what
[23:27] this man Daniel did to the King
[23:30] Nebuchadnezzar so Nebuchadnezzar was
[23:33] taken
[23:34] back um by Daniel and his
[23:38] abilities we go from Daniel chapter 2
[23:42] and then in Daniel chapter three we see
[23:46] what I believe is the
[23:50] result of Daniel showing these great
[23:54] powers of God to this man Nebuchadnezzar
[23:58] and let's go ahead and let's just dig
[24:00] right
[24:01] in to chapter 3 and we'll start with
[24:04] verse
[24:05] one so after this had
[24:09] happened Nebuchadnezzar the king made an
[24:13] image of
[24:14] gold whose height was three score cubits
[24:16] and its bread there thereof six cubits
[24:20] and he set up in the plane in the plain
[24:22] of dura in the province of Babylon now
[24:26] when we measure a cubit a cubit back in
[24:30] um the oldtime days a cubit is the
[24:32] measurement from your elbow to the end
[24:35] of your fingers there it's about about a
[24:38] foot and a half about 18 inches so when
[24:41] we talk about cubits we're talking about
[24:44] a foot and a
[24:46] half then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent
[24:50] to gather together the princes the
[24:51] governors the captains the judges the
[24:54] treasurers the counselors the sheriffs
[24:55] and all the rules of the province to
[24:57] come to the dedication of the image
[25:00] which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set
[25:03] up then the princes the governors the
[25:05] captains the judges the treasurers the
[25:08] counselors the sheriffs and all the
[25:10] rulers of the province provinces were
[25:13] gathered together you know Daniel has a
[25:15] style of writing and he repeats himself
[25:18] a lot he wants to make sure that we are
[25:20] getting the point and all these people
[25:21] that are
[25:23] here we gathered together unto the
[25:25] dedication of image that Nebuchadnezzar
[25:27] had the king had set up and they stood
[25:29] before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had
[25:31] set
[25:32] up then a Herald cried aloud to you it
[25:36] is commanded oh people Nations and
[25:39] languages that at what time you hear the
[25:42] sound of the Cornet the flute the harp
[25:45] the sackit the sultry the
[25:47] duler and all kinds of music that you
[25:50] fall down and worship the golden image
[25:53] that Nebuchadnezzar the King has set up
[25:56] and whosoever fth not down
[25:58] and and worships shall the same hour be
[26:02] cast into the midst of the burning fiery
[26:07] furnace so the king makes this
[26:11] decree and he basically says anyone who
[26:14] doesn't follow this decree you're going
[26:17] to be thrown into this fiery furnace and
[26:19] I'll tell you what I think the fiery
[26:21] furnace is here in a little bit but
[26:23] let's so what happens
[26:26] is the Jew remember they were taken
[26:29] captive out of out of Jerusalem out of
[26:32] Judah they were brought to Babylon do
[26:36] you remember how many how many invasions
[26:39] there were and how many captivities how
[26:41] many times they they invaded and took
[26:43] captives three times right Daniel was
[26:46] taking dur taken during which
[26:48] time first time so he was brought over
[26:53] now we have this population of Jews that
[26:56] are here in Babylon and and
[26:59] Nebuchadnezzar wanted them to assimilate
[27:02] into society so what he did he even
[27:04] changed their names to the common
[27:07] Babylonian names he told them he wanted
[27:09] them to eat this type of food he wanted
[27:11] them to be like everybody else in
[27:13] Babylon which as I said last time is
[27:15] exactly what the world wants us to do
[27:17] today they want you to not say anything
[27:21] just
[27:22] assimilate just be like everybody else
[27:27] have the same
[27:28] lashes have the same have have the
[27:33] same Facebook page have the same
[27:35] Instagram page have the same Snapchat
[27:37] you look like everybody else and if you
[27:39] look today they all look the same and
[27:42] it's because they all paint up the same
[27:45] everybody looks the same and that's
[27:47] what's the world going on today is they
[27:50] want us to
[27:53] assimilate so what happens
[27:56] is these tattlers come back to the king
[28:01] and say Hey listen these Jews remember
[28:05] these ones that came out of that we
[28:07] brought out of Jerusalem and brought
[28:08] them here they're not doing what you're
[28:11] saying
[28:12] King they're not falling down every time
[28:14] we hear the trumpets blowing all this
[28:16] stuff and all the music playing they're
[28:18] not falling down and worshiping this
[28:21] image that you sat set
[28:23] up remember this
[28:27] King has a bad
[28:30] temper verse number 12 says
[28:33] this these are the
[28:35] tattlers there are certain Jews whom
[28:38] thou has set over the Affairs of the
[28:40] province of Babylon Shadrach meach and
[28:42] Abednego these men oh King have not
[28:45] regarded thee they serve not thy Gods
[28:49] nor worship the golden image which thou
[28:52] Hast set up so he sets up this golden
[28:56] image and remember we see in number of
[28:58] cubits we see how big the thing is the
[29:00] thing's really big but what is this
[29:03] image of most Scholars most historians
[29:08] think that it is an image of the king
[29:11] himself Nebuchadnezzar which would make
[29:14] sense because the kings are generally
[29:16] narcissists they're generally people
[29:18] that love themselves they're generally
[29:20] people that want to leave a legacy so
[29:23] why not set up an image to yourself but
[29:25] it doesn't quite make sense
[29:28] that look at the placement of this
[29:32] image in the Bible it happened right
[29:36] after Nebuchadnezzar actually fell down
[29:39] and worshiped
[29:41] Daniel so what is this image brother the
[29:46] random said one time he said let's take
[29:48] the Hebrew children because they stood
[29:51] and would not tolerate with image
[29:52] worship they refused to bow down to an
[29:55] image that the king of the nation had
[29:57] made it was made after a holy man too
[30:00] the image of
[30:02] Daniel not only
[30:05] that
[30:06] but belto
[30:09] Shazer which the king named
[30:12] Daniel later on we are going to read
[30:15] that it is the name after
[30:17] Nebuchadnezzar's
[30:19] God and not only that but you'll notice
[30:23] that everybody has to fall down and the
[30:26] ones that don't are only three people
[30:28] how come
[30:29] Daniel was not with these
[30:34] three if you make up an image to a god
[30:36] it doesn't make sense that you worship
[30:40] your own image So Daniel would have been
[30:43] exempt from worshiping this big statue
[30:46] if this was of Daniel and further with
[30:50] all these things in mind we we look at
[30:54] Nebuchadnezzar and remember
[30:55] Nebuchadnezzar had many gods he didn't
[30:57] didn't just have one God he was what's
[30:59] called an idolator he had many gods the
[31:02] Jews have one
[31:04] God Nebuchadnezzar it's no big deal to
[31:07] just make up another God why not make it
[31:11] of Daniel so if you look at if you line
[31:14] all of these things up really I
[31:19] believe that that image must have been
[31:24] of the Prophet Daniel it makes sense
[31:28] then
[31:29] Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury
[31:32] we've seen that before in his rage and
[31:35] fury commanded to bring Shadrach meach
[31:38] and
[31:39] abedo commanded to bring Shadrach mhach
[31:42] and abedo and they brought these men
[31:45] before God so these are the three men
[31:47] that would not fall down and worship
[31:49] this
[31:51] image Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto
[31:54] them is it true oh Shadrach me and
[31:58] abedo do not ye serve my gods no worship
[32:02] the golden image which I have set up if
[32:06] now if ye be ready that at what time you
[32:09] hear the sound of the Cornet the flute
[32:11] the harp the sackit the Salt Tree and
[32:13] the duler and all kinds of
[32:16] music You Fall Down and Worship the
[32:18] image which I have
[32:19] made you do
[32:22] well but if you do but if you worship
[32:25] not you shall be cast the same out power
[32:28] into the midst of the burning fiery
[32:30] furnace and who is that God who is that
[32:36] who is that God that shall deliver you
[32:38] out of my hand so he's giving them
[32:40] another chance which is strange for
[32:43] Nebuchadnezzar he hasn't given any
[32:45] anybody else any other chances but I
[32:46] think he knew these these these young
[32:49] men and he knew that they were friends
[32:51] with Daniel so he's giving them another
[32:53] chance very kind of
[32:55] him you can either Fall Down and Worship
[32:57] ship or I'll burn you to death I'm going
[33:00] to give you another
[33:02] chance Shadrach mhach and Abednego
[33:05] answered and said the said to the king
[33:06] oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to
[33:09] answer thee in this matter that's old
[33:11] English say the the the modern
[33:14] translation Shadrach mhak abedo in the
[33:16] English Standard Version answered and
[33:18] said unto the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we
[33:20] have no need to answer you in this
[33:24] matter new King James says the same
[33:26] thing NIV says King Nebuchadnezzar we do
[33:29] not need to defend ourselves before you
[33:31] in this
[33:34] matter if it be so our God whom we serve
[33:38] is able to Deliver Us From The Burning
[33:40] fiery furnace and he will deliver us out
[33:42] of thine hand oh King but if not I love
[33:46] this part he's they say our God can
[33:50] deliver us out of this fiery
[33:53] furnace but if not be it known unto thee
[33:57] Oh King
[33:58] that we will not serve thy Gods nor
[34:01] worship the golden image which thou Hast
[34:03] set up so it doesn't matter Our God's
[34:06] able to deliver us but even if he
[34:07] doesn't that's up to him he's a
[34:09] sovereign God even if he does not
[34:11] deliver us we're not going to do it we
[34:14] are not going to bow down to your
[34:18] Idols then can't guess what
[34:20] happens next then Nebuchadnezzar was
[34:23] full of
[34:24] Fury and the form of his VIs was changed
[34:28] against Shadrach Meshach and abedo so he
[34:31] was given him a chance and now you see
[34:33] The Temper rise up in
[34:36] him therefore he spake and commanded
[34:39] that they should heat the furnace one
[34:41] seven times more than it was want to be
[34:45] heated so what is this fiery
[34:48] furnace let's
[34:50] just think about what this was it could
[34:54] have been a furnace that they used to
[34:57] make charcoal
[34:58] out of so you burn this wood and then
[35:00] and then you take it and and you can use
[35:02] it for for fuel or whatever but it was
[35:05] probably because this is well into the
[35:07] Iron Age now it was probably some sort
[35:11] of a furnace used for either melting
[35:15] metals or smelting or into into a metal
[35:22] so basically for our intents and
[35:26] purposes it was something used to melt
[35:30] metal it was very hot just normally so
[35:34] that's the Gospel According to Daniel
[35:37] that's what that's what I think that
[35:40] this fiery furnace was is something used
[35:44] to melt metal
[35:46] so just its regular temperature was
[35:50] super hot more than
[35:53] enough to kill someone and enough to
[35:57] probably melt metal could have been a
[36:00] smelter it could have been some sort of
[36:01] a large furnace as I said to melt metal
[36:04] but but it was it was something that was
[36:07] very hot so what the king says is in his
[36:09] anger it was plenty hot enough before
[36:12] but in his anger make it seven times
[36:15] worse really melt these
[36:19] guys and he commanded the most mighty
[36:22] men that were in his army to bind
[36:25] Shadrach mhach and abedo and to cast
[36:27] them into the fiery furnace then these
[36:30] men were Bound in their coats their
[36:31] hosen their hats and other garments and
[36:34] were cast into the midst of the burning
[36:37] fiery furnace therefore because the
[36:39] king's commandment was Ur urgent the
[36:42] furnace was exceeding
[36:44] hot the Flames of the F fire slew the
[36:47] men that took up Shadrach mhach and
[36:51] abedo so it must have been a place to
[36:56] put the fuel into the fire to put the
[37:00] charcoal or to put whatever they were
[37:02] burning to get it hot enough to melt the
[37:05] metals it it must have been something
[37:07] that they had to walk up to and then put
[37:11] the fuel in so they brought these young
[37:13] men up to the place to put them into the
[37:16] fire and then it got it was so
[37:20] hot that something happened to where the
[37:24] men that were holding Shadrach Meshach
[37:27] and Abed ago were burned up now let's
[37:30] come back to the Natural and we'll do
[37:32] the Gospel According to Daniel
[37:34] again it could have been that there was
[37:38] something covering the top to keep the
[37:42] the heat inside and when they pulled it
[37:45] off it was something called like a
[37:48] backdraft where the oxygen comes in and
[37:50] then the fire is smoldering and when it
[37:53] gets that oxygen it rushes out and grabs
[37:57] someone sister L you're shaking your
[37:58] head you have firefighter experience you
[38:00] know what that is where that oxygen
[38:02] comes in and it now it reaches out it's
[38:04] very dangerous for
[38:06] firefighters it could have been that or
[38:08] it could have been something that's
[38:10] called a flashover and what a flash over
[38:14] here is it says it is the near
[38:16] simultaneous ignition of most of the
[38:18] directly exposed combustible material
[38:21] material in an enclosed area when
[38:23] certain organic materials are heated
[38:26] that's wood coal any anything that's
[38:30] basically burnable that has Organics in
[38:32] it that any fuel that the Babylonians
[38:34] will put into that F furnace they
[38:37] undergo this quick
[38:40] decomposition and release flammable
[38:43] gases so it could have also been this so
[38:47] basically it's you have it's smoldering
[38:50] smoldering it reaches this temperature
[38:53] and then boom it goes out whatever it
[38:56] was whether it was this type of
[38:58] explosion or that type of explosion
[39:00] something came up and
[39:04] scorched the soldiers holding these
[39:08] Hebrews caused the Hebrews to fall into
[39:11] the furnace they were bound it wouldn't
[39:14] matter if they were bound with handcuffs
[39:17] or iron shackles or whatever they would
[39:19] have melted right
[39:21] off these men these strong men some of
[39:24] his best men Nebuchadnezzar's best men
[39:27] this fire came up and cooked
[39:30] them and here goes the Hebrew children
[39:33] into the fiery
[39:35] furnace and these three men Shadrach
[39:38] mhach and Abednego fell down bound into
[39:42] the midst of the fiery
[39:44] furnace then Nebuchadnezzar the King was
[39:47] astonished and he rose up in haste and
[39:49] he spake and said unto his counselors so
[39:52] he's
[39:53] looking and he's looking down down into
[39:56] this now The Flash probably went back
[39:59] down and now he's able to look into this
[40:03] this vat or whatever it was that's
[40:06] heated seven times hotter and he looks
[40:09] down there and he says
[40:11] hey I thought we weren't there three
[40:16] guys that were cast into the fiery
[40:19] furnace and he
[40:24] looks Nebuchadnezzar the King was
[40:26] astonished he rose up in haste and spake
[40:28] and said unto his counselors did not we
[40:30] cast three men bound into the midst of
[40:31] the fire they answered and said unto the
[40:34] and said unto the king true
[40:36] king he answered and said lo I see four
[40:39] men
[40:41] loose not bound anymore walking in the
[40:45] midst walking around in the midst of the
[40:49] fire seven times hotter than it takes to
[40:51] melt metal walking around in the midst
[40:54] of the fire and they have no hurt
[40:57] and the
[40:59] form of the
[41:01] fourth so there's Shadrach mhach and
[41:03] abedo walking around in their hats and
[41:06] the form of the
[41:08] fourth is like the Son of
[41:12] God other translations says like a Son
[41:15] of God I don't believe they're
[41:17] right like the Son of God what could
[41:23] that have been brother
[41:25] Jeremy maybe a theop
[41:28] amen a a
[41:33] previous
[41:35] manifestation of the Son of God Jesus
[41:38] Christ in that burning fiery furnace how
[41:44] incredible there's Jesus and there's
[41:47] those three men that was probably the
[41:49] safest place on Earth right there right
[41:52] in the midst of that fiery furnace that
[41:54] there with there with Jesus Christ
[42:00] Christ then
[42:01] Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of
[42:03] the burning fiery furnace and spake and
[42:05] said Shadrach mhach and abedo you
[42:08] Servants of the most high God come forth
[42:11] come hither and Shadrach Meshach and
[42:14] Abednego came forth of the midst of the
[42:17] fiery
[42:19] furnace came forth from the midst of the
[42:21] fiery furnace of the midst and then the
[42:24] princes and governors and captains and
[42:25] the Kings and counselors being gathered
[42:28] together saw these men whose bodies the
[42:30] fire had no power nor was a hair of
[42:33] their head singed neither were their
[42:36] coats
[42:37] changed nor the smell of
[42:40] fire had even passed on
[42:43] them then Nebuchadnezzar remember his
[42:47] dream he was probably like
[42:50] whoa it's happening again with these
[42:53] young
[42:54] men then Nebuchadnezzar spake and said
[42:56] bless blessed be the god of Shadrach
[42:59] meach and Abednego who has sent his
[43:01] Angel and delivered his servants that
[43:03] trusted him and have changed the king's
[43:06] word and yielded their bodies that they
[43:09] might not serve nor worship any God
[43:12] except their own God so Nebuchadnezzar
[43:16] in all his of e evilness and all of his
[43:20] temper and everything bad about that man
[43:23] sometimes we see some goodness in him
[43:26] sometimes we see see some Revelation for
[43:28] heaven's sakes he he
[43:30] saw and realized that that Fourth Man in
[43:33] the fire right was the Lord Jesus
[43:37] brother Lyall you stole my thunder about
[43:39] who it was in there with your
[43:41] song but it
[43:43] was it was a previous manifestation of
[43:46] the Son of
[43:51] God Nebuchadnezzar spake let me read it
[43:53] again Nebuchadnezzar spake and said
[43:55] blessed be the god of Shadrach Meshach
[43:57] in a bigo who have set his Angel and
[43:59] delivered his servants that trusted him
[44:01] and have changed the king's word and
[44:03] yielded their bodies that they might not
[44:05] serve nor worship any God except their
[44:07] own God therefore I make a decree Here
[44:10] We Go Again The King's going to make
[44:11] another decree he hasn't learned that
[44:14] his decrees are just not that
[44:17] successful that every people nation and
[44:20] language would speak anything amiss
[44:22] against the god of Shadrach Meshach and
[44:23] abedo shall be cut in pieces and the
[44:27] their houses shall be made a dungill
[44:29] because there is no other God that can
[44:31] Del deliver after this
[44:35] sort then the king promoted Shadrach
[44:38] Meshach and abedo in the province of
[44:43] Babylon chapter 4 is a unique chapter in
[44:47] all the
[44:49] Bible
[44:51] it's does do we
[44:54] know what race of people wrote this
[44:56] Bible
[44:58] the Jews from Genesis written
[45:03] by
[45:05] Moses all the way to
[45:09] Revelation written down by who John who
[45:14] was a Jew we have Jews from the
[45:17] beginning all the way to the end Moses
[45:20] who was from the tribe of Levi where the
[45:22] Jewish um really race starts with Jacob
[45:26] and his 12
[45:28] sons as we've gone through Moses writes
[45:32] from uh from Genesis down and then we
[45:35] have other Jews Ezra and Nehemiah and
[45:38] those that that take up the mantle and
[45:40] begin and write all the way down till
[45:43] now in Daniel and we see something
[45:47] different in Daniel chapter 4 that's
[45:50] never happened in the Bible and it never
[45:53] happens
[45:54] again where chapter 4 is written by a
[45:58] gentile King not even a Jew it's written
[46:01] by King
[46:04] Nebuchadnezzar so he himself gets to
[46:06] have his own chapter in the
[46:10] Bible Daniel chapter
[46:12] 4 Nebuchadnezzar the King this is him
[46:15] writing he writes this letter and he
[46:18] says Nebuchadnezzar the king unto all
[46:20] people Nations and languages that dwell
[46:22] in all the Earth peace be multiplied
[46:24] unto you I thought it good to show the
[46:28] signs and wonders that God hath wrought
[46:30] toward me how great are his signs and
[46:33] how Mighty are his wonders his kingdom
[46:35] is an everlasting Kingdom and his
[46:37] Dominion is from generation to gen
[46:40] generation so we see that this man
[46:42] Nebuchadnezzar has experienced some
[46:45] Revelation in his life and it's came
[46:48] from Daniel and these three Hebrew CH
[46:50] these three Hebrew
[46:53] children so now he
[46:55] knows that Daniel can interpret dreams
[46:58] he he knows that Daniel is this Gifted
[47:00] Man and he says I Nebuchadnezzar was at
[47:03] rest in my house and flourishing in my
[47:06] Palace and I saw a dream which made me
[47:09] afraid and the thoughts upon my bed and
[47:12] the visions of my head troubled me
[47:14] therefore made I a decree to the
[47:16] beginning and all the wise men of
[47:18] Babylon before me that they might make
[47:21] known unto me the interpretation of the
[47:24] dream sounds familiar doesn't it
[47:28] then came in The Magicians and the
[47:30] astrologers and the calans and the
[47:31] soothsayers and I told the dream before
[47:34] them this is different than the first
[47:36] time first time Daniel told him the
[47:38] dream now Nebuchadnezzar he brings in
[47:41] all of his wise men and he tells them
[47:44] this dream that he
[47:46] has but they did not make known unto me
[47:49] the interpretation thereof but at the
[47:52] last Daniel came in before me whose name
[47:56] was built to shazar according to the
[47:58] name of my
[48:00] God and whom and in whom the spirit of
[48:03] the Holy gods and before him I told the
[48:06] dream
[48:08] saying oh belshazzar oh Daniel Master Of
[48:12] The
[48:13] Magicians do you remember who these wise
[48:16] men are these magicians these are the
[48:18] ancestors to the wise men that came and
[48:21] gave the gifts to the baby Jesus many
[48:24] years later
[48:29] oh belshazzar Master Of The Magicians
[48:32] because I know that the spirit of the
[48:34] Holy Gods is in thee and no secret
[48:37] troubleth thee tell me the visions of my
[48:40] dream that I have seen and the
[48:42] interpretation thereof thus were the
[48:45] visions of mine head in my bed and I saw
[48:48] and behold a tree in the midst of the
[48:51] earth and the height thereof was great
[48:55] the tree grew and was strong long and
[48:57] the height thereof reached into the
[48:59] Heaven and the sight thereof to the end
[49:00] of the Earth the leaves thereof were
[49:04] fair and the fruit thereof much and in
[49:07] it was meat for all was food for all and
[49:09] the beasts of the field had Shadow under
[49:12] it and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in
[49:15] the boughs thereof and all the flesh was
[49:18] fed of it so this great tree the the
[49:20] animals in the field would come under it
[49:22] and enjoy its shade and the the birds
[49:25] would would make their nest in it it was
[49:28] just this great
[49:35] tree and I saw in the vision of my head
[49:38] my bed and behold a watcher and a holy
[49:41] one came down from heaven and he cried
[49:44] aloud remember this is his dream and he
[49:46] cried aloud loud and said said thus Hue
[49:49] down the tree cut down the tree and cut
[49:51] off its branches shake off his leaves
[49:54] and Scatter his fruit let the Beast get
[49:56] away from under it and the fowls from
[50:00] his branches nevertheless leave the
[50:03] stump of its of his roots in the earth
[50:06] even with a band of iron and Brass in
[50:09] the tender grass of the field and let it
[50:11] be wet with the de of heaven and let his
[50:14] portion be with the beasts in the in the
[50:18] grass of the
[50:19] Earth let his heart be changed from a
[50:22] man's and let a BEAST's heart be given
[50:25] unto him and let seven times pass over
[50:28] him this matter is by the decree of the
[50:30] Watchers and de and the demand by the
[50:33] word of the Holy ones to the intent that
[50:36] in the LI in the living may know that
[50:39] the most high ruleth in the Kingdom of
[50:41] men and giveth it to whomsoever he will
[50:44] and Seth up over the base the bases of
[50:49] men this dream I Nebuchadnezzar have
[50:53] seen now thou oh belshazzar
[50:58] declare the interpretation thereof for
[51:00] as much as all the wise men of my
[51:03] kingdom are not able to make known unto
[51:06] me the
[51:07] interpretation but you are
[51:09] able for the spirit of the Holy Gods is
[51:12] in
[51:13] thee now Daniel is going to give the
[51:16] interpretation of the dream like he did
[51:17] before but this
[51:19] time Daniel's a bit hesitant to tell the
[51:24] king and you're gonna see why
[51:27] remember Nebuchadnezzar's
[51:29] temper before the interpretation was
[51:33] good now listen to
[51:36] this then Daniel whose name was belto
[51:41] shazar was astonished for one hour that
[51:44] means perplexed he was
[51:46] dismayed and his thoughts troubled him
[51:49] the king spake and said belto shazar let
[51:52] not the dream or the interpretation
[51:54] thereof trouble thee Bazar answered and
[51:59] said my Lord the dream be to them that
[52:03] hate
[52:05] thee and the interpretation thereof to
[52:08] thine enemies so he's saying
[52:11] King he's saying this ain't going to
[52:13] work out well for you this
[52:17] dream a tree the tree that thou sawest
[52:21] which grew and was strong whose height
[52:23] reached unto the Heaven and the sight
[52:26] thereof to all the Earth so it was
[52:28] something that was looking out
[52:30] throughout the whole
[52:32] earth
[52:33] king over the
[52:36] Earth and whereas the
[52:40] king I'm sorry ver number
[52:43] 22 verse number 20 the tree which thou
[52:46] sawest which grew and was strong whose
[52:48] height reached to the Heaven and the
[52:50] sight thereof to all the Earth whose
[52:51] leaves were fair and the fruit thereof
[52:53] much and it was meat for all food for
[52:55] all under which all the beasts of the
[52:57] field dwelt and upon whose branches the
[53:00] fowls of the heaven had their habitation
[53:02] it is thou oh
[53:03] King this tree is
[53:06] you Thou Art grown and become strong for
[53:10] thy greatness is grown and reaches unto
[53:13] heaven and thy Dominion to the end of
[53:15] the
[53:16] Earth remember last week we talked about
[53:20] the dream that he saw in the head of
[53:24] gold that was Nebuchadnezzar first Dream
[53:27] and that head of gold it was the
[53:29] greatest of them all and that was
[53:32] Nebuchadnezzar whereas and whereas the
[53:35] king saw a watcher a holy one coming
[53:37] down from heaven and saying heue the
[53:40] tree down and destroy it yet leave the
[53:43] stump of the roots thereof in the earth
[53:46] even with a band of iron and brass and
[53:49] tender grass of the field and let it be
[53:51] wet with the de of heaven and let his
[53:53] portion be with the beasts of the field
[53:56] seven times pass over him so he's he's
[53:59] recounting the dream that the that the
[54:00] king had this is the interpretation oh
[54:03] King and this is the decree of the most
[54:06] high which has come up upon my Lord the
[54:10] king here's what this part of this of
[54:13] your dream
[54:14] means that they shall Drive thee from
[54:17] men and thy dwelling shall be with the
[54:20] beasts of the field and they shall make
[54:22] thee to eat
[54:24] grass as oxen
[54:26] and they shall wet thee with the Dew of
[54:28] heaven and seven times seven periods of
[54:31] time shall pass over thee till thou know
[54:34] that the most high ruleth in the Kingdom
[54:37] of men and giveth it to whosoever he
[54:39] will so Nebuchadnezzar he's saying
[54:42] you're going to learn that God is
[54:45] greater than you
[54:47] are and whereas they commanded to leave
[54:50] the stump of the tree of the tree roots
[54:53] thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee and
[54:56] after that thou shalt have known that
[54:59] the heavens do rule so remember job and
[55:02] he saw that tree that was cut down and
[55:05] then he saw that when water hit the tree
[55:10] that it started to sprout and started to
[55:11] grow
[55:13] again so he's saying here that you're
[55:16] going to be like that tree you're going
[55:18] to get cut down but there's still hope
[55:20] here
[55:23] Nebuchadnezzar whereof oh King wherefore
[55:25] O King
[55:26] let my counsel be acceptable unto thee
[55:29] and break off thy sin sins by
[55:32] righteousness and thine iniquities by
[55:34] showing Mercy to the poor if it be if it
[55:38] may be a lengthening of thy Tranquility
[55:41] do you remember the story of Elijah the
[55:45] prophet when he prophesied to Ahab and
[55:48] said you are going to the dogs are going
[55:50] to lick your blood what Happ what Ahab
[55:53] did Ahab repented and sat an ases and it
[55:57] stayed God's Wrath for a while it
[56:02] eventually came true Ahab died in battle
[56:05] and when they washed off the The Chariot
[56:08] that he was in the dogs came and they
[56:11] licked the blood off of the ground but
[56:13] but Ahab repented and it stayed the
[56:17] wrath of God and here's what the prophet
[56:18] is Danel Daniel is saying to this King
[56:21] he's saying listen King he said if you
[56:23] can just be kind give to the poor be
[56:29] humble then God's Wrath will be
[56:33] stayed remember this is Nebuchadnezzar
[56:38] writing and all
[56:40] this came upon the
[56:43] King
[56:45] Nebuchadnezzar you know I enjoy when I
[56:49] hear a
[56:51] testimony probably my favorite
[56:53] testimonies to hear is when someone says
[56:56] here's what I did
[56:58] wrong here's how I suffered for doing
[57:02] wrong and here is how God brought me out
[57:06] and how God blessed me I love those
[57:09] testimonies if the Lord's willing this
[57:11] Sunday morning we hear a a testimony of
[57:16] that very thing how someone did wrong
[57:19] they admitted it and then they found the
[57:22] joy of God even though they have
[57:24] suffered for what they did wrong that
[57:27] would be this Sunday
[57:30] morning at the end of 12 months he
[57:33] walked in the Palace of the kingdom of
[57:36] Babylon so later on maybe forgot about
[57:40] this interpretation from Daniel this
[57:41] warning for from
[57:44] Daniel and the King spake and said is
[57:48] not this great Babylon that I have
[57:53] built for the house of the Kingdom by
[57:56] the might of my power and for the honor
[58:01] of my
[58:04] Majesty remember when Herod in the book
[58:06] of Acts we go way back to the book of
[58:08] Acts remember when
[58:10] Herod when he gave that incredible
[58:13] speech in front of the people and they
[58:16] said oh it's like God speaking and Herod
[58:18] did not give credit to God and he
[58:21] dropped down dead right there and the
[58:22] Bible says that he was eaten of worms
[58:26] and here this Nebuchadnezzar is doing
[58:29] the best he's looking at he says look at
[58:31] what I
[58:33] did this is my kingdom I have created
[58:36] this and it was the greatest Kingdom on
[58:38] Earth had giant
[58:41] walls around it these beautiful streets
[58:44] it was a beautiful prosperous nation and
[58:48] here is Nebuchadnezzar looking out and
[58:50] say look what I
[58:53] did and while the word was in the king's
[58:57] mouth there fell a voice from Heaven
[59:00] saying oh King
[59:01] Nebuchadnezzar to thee it is spoken the
[59:04] kingdom is departed from thee and they
[59:07] shall Drive thee from men and thy
[59:09] dwelling shall be with the beasts of the
[59:11] field remember his dream in Daniel's
[59:12] interpretation and thy and thy dwelling
[59:15] shall be with the beasts of the field
[59:17] they shall make thee to eat grass as
[59:20] oxen seven times seven periods of time
[59:23] shall pass over thee until thou know
[59:26] that the most high ruleth in the Kingdom
[59:28] of men and giveth it to whomsoever he
[59:31] will God's in charge Nebuchadnezzar I
[59:33] don't care who you think you are he is
[59:36] the king God is the king and you may not
[59:39] believe you may not do anything but you
[59:41] are still subject to
[59:46] him the same
[59:49] hour was the thing fulfilled upon
[59:52] Nebuchadnezzar and he was driven from
[59:54] men he did eat grass as oxen and his
[59:57] body was wet with the Dew of Heaven till
[1:00:00] his hairs were grown out like eagle
[1:00:02] feathers and his nails grew out like
[1:00:05] Bird's
[1:00:07] Claws and at the end of the days I
[1:00:11] Nebuchadnezzar so he would he would be
[1:00:13] out he'd eat grass like the
[1:00:17] cows he was so crazy he lost his mind
[1:00:20] that his nails grew out really long his
[1:00:23] hair was really long
[1:00:27] and the
[1:00:28] Dew that would fall because he'd sleep
[1:00:31] out in the fields would fall upon his
[1:00:33] back and he'd wake up
[1:00:36] wet and at the end of the days I
[1:00:41] Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes unto
[1:00:43] heaven and my understanding returned to
[1:00:46] me and I bless the most high and I
[1:00:49] praised and honored him that liveth
[1:00:52] forever whose Dominion is an everlasting
[1:00:55] Dominion and his kingdom is from
[1:00:57] generation to generation he honored him
[1:01:00] one person he didn't honor them those
[1:01:03] different gods he honored him singular
[1:01:06] he honored god Jehovah not the plurality
[1:01:09] of gods but one God and all the
[1:01:13] inhabitants of the Earth are reputed as
[1:01:16] nothing and he doeth according to his
[1:01:20] will in the army of heaven and among the
[1:01:23] inhabitants of the earth and none can
[1:01:25] stay his hand or say unto him what doest
[1:01:28] thou at the same time my reason returned
[1:01:31] unto me and for the glory of my Kingdom
[1:01:34] Mine honor and brightness returned unto
[1:01:37] me and my counselors and my lords sought
[1:01:40] unto me and I was established in My
[1:01:42] Kingdom an excellent Majesty was added
[1:01:45] to
[1:01:46] me so when you make a mistake as this
[1:01:49] King what a horrible mistake went crazy
[1:01:54] for probably seven years or ever long it
[1:01:57] was and yet he repented and God restored
[1:02:01] it so brothers and sisters when we make
[1:02:03] a mistake don't dwell on it repent give
[1:02:08] God the glory and he might just restore
[1:02:12] things even better than they were
[1:02:14] before and here's Nebuchadnezzar saying
[1:02:17] he even blessed me higher than
[1:02:21] before now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and
[1:02:24] extol and honor the king of Heaven
[1:02:26] and all whose works are truth and his
[1:02:29] ways judgment and those that walk in
[1:02:32] Pride he is able to AB base he knows
[1:02:35] because he's been there what a
[1:02:37] testimony that's why I love those
[1:02:39] testimonies here's what I did
[1:02:41] wrong here's how I suffered for it and
[1:02:43] here's Nebuchadnezzar saying I was the
[1:02:46] king I was everything yet in my pride
[1:02:49] God brought me down to the lowest of the
[1:02:51] low
[1:02:56] now we go to chapter
[1:02:59] 6
[1:03:01] and we assume that Nebuchadnezzar checks
[1:03:04] out he's um I assume he died some time
[1:03:09] past and then his
[1:03:11] son Bazar takes over I want to tell I
[1:03:16] want to give a testimony first before we
[1:03:18] get into uh Daniel chapter
[1:03:24] 5 on uh June the 8th
[1:03:29] 1961 my
[1:03:31] mom my
[1:03:34] dad my mom's
[1:03:36] family my dad's family were in Bram
[1:03:41] Tabernacle in Jefferson Mo
[1:03:44] Indiana
[1:03:46] and the sermon went
[1:03:50] forth the sermon title
[1:03:53] was Revelation 4 part
[1:03:57] three towards the end of the service
[1:04:00] after the the sermon was over it came
[1:04:03] time to pray for the
[1:04:06] sick and if you listen to the sermon and
[1:04:09] it's
[1:04:10] recorded You Hear the People start to
[1:04:14] shout and start to
[1:04:17] scream and even the tape recorder
[1:04:20] stopped for a moment just just maybe for
[1:04:23] a
[1:04:24] moment and and what had happened my mom
[1:04:27] was there and I've heard my mom tell me
[1:04:29] tell me the story many times I called my
[1:04:31] aunt Jacqueline today and I Saidi just
[1:04:32] want to make sure I'm right in this
[1:04:34] story that I told my Aunt Jacqueline was
[1:04:36] there my dad was there my both of my
[1:04:39] grandpas both sides of my family all of
[1:04:41] them were
[1:04:42] there what had
[1:04:45] happened they were sitting in
[1:04:47] church and on the wall there came a
[1:04:52] light and the people saw it the light
[1:04:56] started to
[1:04:57] move my dad said he was my dad was was
[1:05:01] really close to it he said the light was
[1:05:04] like alive it was
[1:05:06] moving like this and they saw it on the
[1:05:11] wall and it began to move up and you can
[1:05:14] listen and the people start shouting and
[1:05:16] the fear comes in the in the audience
[1:05:18] brother Brandon was in the Pulpit he
[1:05:19] says wait wait he says basically don't
[1:05:21] fear that it starts moving up and as it
[1:05:25] got to the
[1:05:28] ceiling it went
[1:05:31] into the ceiling didn't reflect on top
[1:05:35] of the ceiling went into the ceiling and
[1:05:41] disappeared people were shouting there
[1:05:43] was a great fear that came upon the
[1:05:44] audience I talked to my aunt Jacqueline
[1:05:47] today she said she told the same stories
[1:05:50] my dad told my mom told everybody it was
[1:05:52] a it was something that was moving there
[1:05:55] something Supernatural my grandfather
[1:05:58] wheeler who was a deacon in the church
[1:06:01] came back I don't know if it was the
[1:06:02] next day or a couple days later he and I
[1:06:05] think it was brother Hickerson another
[1:06:06] Deacon in the church they they went and
[1:06:08] they tried to duplicate the light on the
[1:06:11] on the on the wall and they couldn't do
[1:06:13] it they even took a flashlight and
[1:06:15] shined it on the wall and tried to get
[1:06:18] it to go into the wall and they couldn't
[1:06:22] it it always reflect reflected off the
[1:06:24] ceiling there was no no way to duplicate
[1:06:26] the light it was a supernatural
[1:06:29] experience that had happened right
[1:06:31] there witnessed by hundreds of
[1:06:36] people and the reason I'm telling it is
[1:06:39] something similar happens right here in
[1:06:42] this Daniel chapter
[1:06:48] 5 Bel Shazer is
[1:06:51] Daniel the king's num the King's son is
[1:06:55] name
[1:06:56] Bazar similar names similar
[1:07:00] spellings so we're going to see right
[1:07:02] now what happens when you don't respect
[1:07:04] God and you disrespect the things of
[1:07:08] God chapter 5 verse one Bazar the
[1:07:12] king made a great feast to a thousand of
[1:07:15] his Lords and drank wine before the
[1:07:17] thousands so he's having this big
[1:07:19] drunken party and when you drink and you
[1:07:24] get drunk
[1:07:26] you do things that you would not
[1:07:27] normally
[1:07:29] do but let me tell you no matter how
[1:07:33] drunk you are and no matter no matter
[1:07:36] what you're taking to make you do this
[1:07:39] you are still responsible for what you
[1:07:43] do even if you may be out of your mind
[1:07:47] with some other chemical or
[1:07:50] alcohol I mean you can go out and you
[1:07:52] get in the car you can drink to where
[1:07:54] you can't you you don't know what you're
[1:07:56] doing you can go out and kill somebody
[1:07:57] you're going to go to jail for murder
[1:07:59] but I didn't know what I was doing you
[1:08:00] but you knew when you started
[1:08:03] drinking and here this King's son who is
[1:08:07] now King he knew
[1:08:12] better
[1:08:14] Bazar whilst he tasted the
[1:08:18] wine commanded to bring the golden and
[1:08:21] silver vessels which his father
[1:08:22] Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the
[1:08:24] Temple which was in Jerusalem that the
[1:08:27] king and his princes his wives and his
[1:08:29] concubines might drink therein so all of
[1:08:32] this party going on and laughing and and
[1:08:34] doing everything hey go get the the uh
[1:08:37] the vessels that you brought out of the
[1:08:40] temple God's Temple Jehovah's temple in
[1:08:43] Jerusalem let's use those haha that'll
[1:08:46] be fun let's make fun of these Jews so
[1:08:51] they bring these sacred
[1:08:53] vessels into their part party fill them
[1:08:56] with
[1:08:58] wine start laughing drinking doing their
[1:09:06] thing and as they were
[1:09:08] partying making
[1:09:10] fun of this Jehovah
[1:09:14] God there
[1:09:16] came a writing on the
[1:09:20] wall they all saw it fear swept through
[1:09:25] everyone that was there the king Bazar
[1:09:28] he looks at it and he was so afraid that
[1:09:31] his knees were knocking
[1:09:34] together and he he slumped
[1:09:37] over and he saw and there's there was
[1:09:39] this thing written across he didn't know
[1:09:41] what it mean
[1:09:43] meant scared to
[1:09:48] death brings in his people says hey can
[1:09:52] you interpret what this said nobody can
[1:09:54] interpret it
[1:09:56] so his his
[1:09:57] wife tells him she's like hey hey Bazar
[1:10:01] she says uh do you remember your dad
[1:10:05] remember the letter he
[1:10:07] wrote remember your dad talking about
[1:10:09] this man Daniel that could interpret
[1:10:12] dreams that had that was that was that
[1:10:15] that had this ability this gift do you
[1:10:18] remember that
[1:10:19] man and he said yeah why don't you call
[1:10:23] him Daniel's an old man by right
[1:10:27] now skip to verse
[1:10:31] 17 so he brings Daniel
[1:10:35] in Daniel
[1:10:38] answered and said before the
[1:10:40] king so he offers to Daniel he says if
[1:10:44] you come in he says I'm going to give
[1:10:45] you all of these gifts gold and all this
[1:10:49] and he says I'm going to make you the
[1:10:50] third ruler in the entire Kingdom he
[1:10:53] says you're going to be the number
[1:10:55] number three
[1:10:56] men Rich beyond measure in this great
[1:10:59] city of Babylon you're going to be it
[1:11:05] Daniel then Daniel answered and said
[1:11:07] before the king let thy gifts be to
[1:11:11] yourself and give thy rewards to
[1:11:14] another yet I will read the writing unto
[1:11:17] the
[1:11:18] king and make known to him the
[1:11:22] interpretation oh Thou King most
[1:11:26] high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father
[1:11:29] a kingdom in majesty and glory and
[1:11:31] honor and for the Majesty that he gave
[1:11:34] him all the people Nations and languages
[1:11:37] trembled and feared before
[1:11:39] him whom he would he would whom he would
[1:11:43] slew whom he whom he would he slew and
[1:11:47] whom he would he kept alive and whom he
[1:11:49] would he set up and whom he would he put
[1:11:52] down but when his heart was lifted stood
[1:11:56] up and his mind hardened in
[1:11:59] Pride he was deposed from his kingly
[1:12:03] throne and they took his glory from
[1:12:07] him and as he was driven from the sons
[1:12:10] of men remember the story I just told
[1:12:13] going out into the field thinking he was
[1:12:14] a
[1:12:16] cow and as he was driven from the sons
[1:12:18] of men and his heart was made like the
[1:12:20] Beast and his dwelling was with the wild
[1:12:22] beast they fed him with grass like oxen
[1:12:25] and his body was wet with the Dew of
[1:12:27] Heaven till he knew that the most high
[1:12:29] God ruled in the Kingdom of men and that
[1:12:31] he appointed over it whomsoever he
[1:12:34] will and thou his
[1:12:39] son oh
[1:12:41] Bazar hasth not humbled thine heart
[1:12:44] though thou knewest all this you read
[1:12:47] his
[1:12:48] letter you're his son you know what
[1:12:50] happened to
[1:12:52] him you saw your dad's mind mind
[1:12:57] fail you knew
[1:13:01] better I love it I love it when these
[1:13:04] prophets do stuff like this he's
[1:13:07] standing before the king remember when
[1:13:09] Ahab when Elijah did it to Ahab say not
[1:13:12] even due or rain or fall until I call
[1:13:15] for it boldness of a
[1:13:23] prophet where are we at first number
[1:13:26] 23 but H has lifted up thyself against
[1:13:29] the Lord of Heaven and they have brought
[1:13:32] the vessels of his house before thee and
[1:13:34] thou and thy Lords and thy wives and thy
[1:13:36] concubines have drunk wine with them and
[1:13:39] thou has praised the gods of silver and
[1:13:41] gold and brass and iron and wood and
[1:13:43] stone which see not nor hear they dumb
[1:13:47] Idols there's not
[1:13:49] alive nor
[1:13:51] no and the god in whose hand thy breath
[1:13:55] is and whose are thy way or are all thy
[1:14:00] ways hast thou not
[1:14:03] glorified the prophet is saying he says
[1:14:05] there is one true God and I don't care
[1:14:07] who you are as I said before you may be
[1:14:09] a sinner whatever you are you still
[1:14:12] answer to God you may not say that you
[1:14:14] do you may say you're an atheist you
[1:14:16] might say that there's no God you're
[1:14:18] still subject to God no matter what you
[1:14:23] say he's saying
[1:14:28] that even you Bel shazar the breath that
[1:14:31] you are breathing comes from
[1:14:34] God then was the part of the hand sent
[1:14:39] from
[1:14:40] him God's hand came down and this is the
[1:14:45] writing that was written again the pro
[1:14:48] prophetic gift of Daniel telling him
[1:14:50] what happened and and this is the
[1:14:52] writing that was written mean mean te
[1:14:55] a
[1:14:57] Parson this is the interpretation of the
[1:15:00] thing
[1:15:01] meaning God hath numbered thy kingdom
[1:15:05] numbered
[1:15:07] numbered God has numbered thy kingdom
[1:15:09] and finished
[1:15:11] it he's numbered the days of your Reign
[1:15:14] and they have come to an end
[1:15:18] Bazar
[1:15:20] tle Thou Art weighed in the balances and
[1:15:23] found wanting you have been weigh on the
[1:15:25] scale of righteousness and you have been
[1:15:28] found
[1:15:30] deficient perz thy kingdom is divided
[1:15:35] and given to the mes and
[1:15:38] Persians then commanded Bazar and they
[1:15:41] clothed Daniel with scarlet and put a
[1:15:42] chain around his neck and made a
[1:15:44] proclamation concerning him that he
[1:15:47] should be the third ruler in the
[1:15:49] Kingdom as this is going on the very
[1:15:53] same night as the as the handwriting was
[1:15:56] on the wall and as he got Daniel and
[1:15:58] Daniel's interpreting this what he
[1:16:00] didn't know they had no
[1:16:02] idea that this
[1:16:06] Kingdom called the
[1:16:08] mes there was a river that ran into the
[1:16:12] city of
[1:16:14] Babylon they were sneaking in maybe
[1:16:18] waiting under the
[1:16:20] walls of Babylon sneaking into the city
[1:16:24] as they were doing their they they're
[1:16:25] drinking and partying and all this and
[1:16:27] making fun of all the Jews and here
[1:16:29] comes this invading Army sneaking under
[1:16:33] the cover of
[1:16:35] Nightfall surrounding infiltrating this
[1:16:41] city Daniel is giving the
[1:16:49] interpretation in that
[1:16:53] night was Bel
[1:16:55] AR the king of the caldian Slade slain
[1:16:59] and
[1:17:00] dasas the
[1:17:02] median took the kingdom being about
[1:17:05] three score and two years old and thus
[1:17:09] there is the end of the reign of
[1:17:11] Nebuchadnezzar and his son
[1:17:15] Bazar then we
[1:17:17] close with that and the musicians can
[1:17:20] come the end there of Daniel chapter
[1:17:26] 5
[1:17:28] very
[1:17:30] scary Time Imagine put yourself in this
[1:17:34] king's this king's place and he's
[1:17:36] partying he's he's doing all this
[1:17:40] and how many times have we
[1:17:43] just gotten slack fooled around said
[1:17:47] things that we shouldn't done things
[1:17:49] that we we we shouldn't have
[1:17:50] done and here this this King
[1:17:55] loses the entire Kingdom not knowing
[1:17:58] that as he is sinning as he's doing all
[1:18:00] this here comes the invad invading Army
[1:18:03] and destroys his
[1:18:06] kingdom Daniels Daniel chapter 3 4 and

[1:23:07] Daniel these
[1:23:09] stories I was talking about Parables on
[1:23:11] Sunday morning these are not
[1:23:13] Parables these things
[1:23:16] happened this King Nebuchadnezzar and
[1:23:19] all of his rage and all of his Fury and
[1:23:21] and all of his kingdom and all of his
[1:23:23] greatness was brought to his
[1:23:26] knees by the Mighty
[1:23:29] God and then He restored him to
[1:23:33] write Daniel chapter
[1:23:36] 4 what what an amazing thing isn't that
[1:23:39] just like
[1:23:40] God I just no
[1:23:42] matter how many times I fail how many
[1:23:45] times I do things wrong and I don't
[1:23:47] think I've done anything as wrong as
[1:23:49] Nebuchadnezzar has but he
[1:23:53] restore and he's always there for us and
[1:23:56] boy is he
[1:23:59] powerful so in summary we we see
[1:24:04] this fiery furnace these young men they
[1:24:07] were not Bow Down and Worship even
[1:24:10] though I believe and I think we all are
[1:24:13] on the same
[1:24:14] page that that was an image of the
[1:24:18] Prophet whom they followed and whom they
[1:24:22] believed but they would would Bow Down
[1:24:24] and Worship Him they said no no no no
[1:24:28] that's reserved for one that's reserved
[1:24:31] for my Creator and I love when they said
[1:24:34] oh it's just so beautiful they said our
[1:24:37] God Nebuchadnezzar we don't care how
[1:24:39] great you are we don't care what what
[1:24:42] powerful you king you are and all these
[1:24:44] men with these swords ready to take our
[1:24:46] heads off and and about to be thrown
[1:24:49] into this fiery
[1:24:52] furnace God can deliver us
[1:24:55] but even if he doesn't we're still we
[1:24:59] are not going to conform to your image
[1:25:03] of
[1:25:05] worship how beautiful in Nebuchadnezzar
[1:25:09] we see
[1:25:10] how this dream that he has how this
[1:25:13] great
[1:25:15] tree Daniel said you were that tree but
[1:25:19] he said Nebuchadnezzar if you would just
[1:25:21] humble
[1:25:23] yourself and then he forgot what Daniel
[1:25:26] said and he looked out with the pride of
[1:25:29] a
[1:25:30] king and he looked out and said look
[1:25:32] what I've
[1:25:33] built look how great I am and
[1:25:36] immediately strucking down right there
[1:25:37] Heard a Voice come from heaven and
[1:25:40] strike him down and he lost his mind
[1:25:43] lowered brother Paul lowered down to the
[1:25:46] lowest of the low and then God had mercy
[1:25:49] on him and he came
[1:25:52] back then his son
[1:25:55] took over and
[1:25:57] disrespected disrespected the things of
[1:25:59] God I said on Sunday morning certain
[1:26:02] things just don't say just be careful be
[1:26:05] careful of your your speech don't take
[1:26:09] the Lord the lord's name in vain don't
[1:26:12] disrespect him don't disrespect his
[1:26:14] Messengers don't disrespect his Bible
[1:26:18] don't make fun of it and it's so easy to
[1:26:21] do because the world makes it so light
[1:26:23] to us
[1:26:25] [Music]
[1:26:26] but
[1:26:28] God he rever this book and he reveres
[1:26:33] the things that are written
[1:26:35] therein but this this young man
[1:26:38] [Music]
[1:26:41] Bazar he
[1:26:44] sinned and that handwriting came on the
[1:26:47] [Music]
[1:26:49] wall and my mom my dad both of my grandp
[1:26:54] parents my family they saw something
[1:26:57] similar to
[1:26:59] that and how it was an unexplained
[1:27:03] Supernatural
[1:27:04] event just
[1:27:06] witnessing that God is real and he's
[1:27:09] alive in our
[1:27:11] day and then this man
[1:27:14] dasas he invades and he takes over we're
[1:27:18] going to hear more about him the kingdom

[1:27:23] it's in this this dual
[1:27:27] Kingdom between Cyrus and dasas the mes
[1:27:31] and the Persians Persian being Cyrus and
[1:27:34] the me being
[1:27:37] dasas and then from the rest of the Book
[1:27:40] of Daniel they will have Rule and it's
[1:27:43] exactly as the King's dream earlier that
[1:27:47] the mes and the Persians would take over
[1:27:49] and that
[1:27:50] next as the as the image in Daniel 1 and
[1:27:55] two came
[1:27:56] down exactly the King's dream and as
