gonna hear a tape this evening brother aaron was working late and so he said i could just introduce the tape here but we're going to listen to a blushing prophet uh it's from 1956 and it's 54 minutes long we're going to have our brother reggie plett with us here on sunday for sunday morning and sunday evening so i just believe the lord has something good planned for that and also i forgot to mention earlier there is a church pilot coming up on friday november 5th so if you like the details on that talk to sister beth guerra if you would and just trust the lord has something for us tonight before we play that let's just sing only believe [Music] all things are possible only believe [Music] all things are possible believe oh jesus is here all things are possible for jesus oh jesus is here jesus is here all things are possible for jesus is here lord i receive o lord i received [Music] i receive all things are possible lord i received lord i received lord i received all things are possible lord i received amen god bless you how may the lord add his blessings to the subject of a blushing prophet this morning we were very much tucked up with a prophet who wore a second-handed robe and we know tonight sent in the scripture this morning that we ourselves wear a second-handed robe we the rope and i am so happy that it is a second-handed robe or this robe that we wear now has been reckoned to god as righteousness through christ jesus and we're not taking the moth eaten robe of some man's theology who's been eaten up with malls and crickets and so forth saying that the days of miracles has passed and there's no such a thing as the ominous presence of the holy spirit now but we are wearing a robe of his righteousness not in our own abilities but in the uh the ability of our lord jesus and when i come down to the jordan i want to have on his robe trusting in his and the great shadow of the gate that's set before us all called death each time our heart beats we go one feet closer to that great gas that every man and woman must go through and when i come to that gap along with you believers i'm so happy to know that i'm not going there with this in my heart and mind that i have done something great i'm going there confessing and knowing that i'm a sinner and knowing this that i want to wrap myself in the robes of his righteousnesses with this testimony that i know him in the power of his resurrection that when he calls from the dead i want to come out now our scene and drama is set tonight for our text of uh another day in israel which was about several hundred years past uh the time of elijah many ups and downs had come and the reign of israel and now we're at the scene tonight this morning we were at the scene of where there was a lot of carnal impersonation out of the school of prophecy were up there training to be prophets and how simple they were they even they couldn't understand the power of god they thought the power had lifted elijah up and thrown him out on the mountain somewhere and they sent a search party to hunt for him when elisha knew good and well that god had taken him to glory or he was not god had taken him and he escaped death by going home to god on a chariot of fire and horse's defined and then we seen that their seminaries and their uh works of their own theology this work has taken the election and calling of god to make a prophet of god and now tonight we find israel in a backslidden condition israel had its ups and downs it was the very type of the church today sometime they were on the house off the next time they were down in the valley that's what takes to make us appreciate the good things there's what they call the law contract the black man of africa never knows that he was black his skin until he seen david livingston and he said then he realized he skinned us back because living since it's white it's a contrast you would never know how to appreciate a day if you didn't have a night you'll never know how to appreciate the sunshine if you didn't have a cloudy day you would never know how to appreciate righteousness unless uh you had had some unrighteousness you would never know how to appreciate good health unless you've had some foul health some bad health it's only those and that's the reason i think that we'll appreciate heaven so much because we've lived on earth once since and i think the law of contrast the reason that we appreciate the holy spirit so much tonight is because we live salon in a church that told us there wasn't such a thing the reason we appreciate it tonight because we have had the other side and that's the way god has intended it to be because his people has had their ups and downs you never know how to appreciate a mountaintop unless you've been in the valley and so you never know how to appreciate good water unless you drink some bad sometimes and then yeah yeah all the way through it's the law of contract now israel was in one of its backslidden states and what a thing they had done now israel was a chosen elected selected people that god had chose israel for one specific purpose that the blood of israel should be the cleanest bloodstream for out of that leanish was going to come the messiah himself all down through the old testament god appeared in man god appeared in abraham as a faith believer god appeared in david as a king he appeared in joseph as righteousness he appeared in moses as prophet priest law giver he appeared down to the ages and the prophets he always made himself known in man and potion through prophet king priest law giver so forth but in christ he dwelt in him the fullness of the godhead bodily and knowing that this spirit must finally find a resting place on elijah he was a man of god justice he uh plated out the justice of god and moses he was a lawgiver that you told the mark or get out and all these things god represented but when he came to christ he was perfect the entire fullness of the godhead bodyweight rested in christ and god represented himself once in the fullest beforehand in the book of genesis in the order of melchizedek who had no father no mother no beginning of days or ending of years or ending of life and he was a priest the king of salem a priest of god of the most high god who was without beginning or without ending he was none other than the pre-figure of the lord jesus christ because he was the king of salem which is the king of peace which is the king of jerusalem and he was in free figure even if patriarch abraham paid tithe to him he was a pre-figure of the coming of the lord jesus the same melchizedek met abraham out of the planes before this destroying of sodom and gomorrah and and he met him after sodom and gomorrah when abraham paid him the timings of all the spoils that he taken from the king all these things this shadow typed up to christ and now all the shadows of the old testament saints their ups and downs was a shadow and type and examples for us today now we find that israel was not the mismarriage their marriage was to be among one another not no israelite to ever marry a gentile but was to keep their bloodstream clean and even until this day i believe the jewish bloodstream is the cleanest blood bloodstream on the face the earth today is the jews they're still looking for that messiah but he's we know that he has already come and their eyes were blinded that we could have a chance of repentance through christ now during the time of the reign of ezra the children of israel had become vaccines they had went out and got to mobinite women and they had got the women of the amorites the persianites and many of the other nations and had not only had married them but was committing fornications among them uncleansing it and polluting the very bloodstream which is the live stream and what a picture that is today of our churches the way they're falling away from the old-fashioned viewing line that god laid down for the church the precepts that we were to live by the church is committing fornication with the world got out into the world and began to die in the world now this had embarrassed the prophet so much so when he come before god he blushed in his face the first one he heard about and he seen the moral decay of his people it hurt him so bad until he sat down and anointed himself plucked his hair out and his beard out and was heavy-hearted before the lord in prayer then when the evening sacrifices offered he went into the temple and fell on his knees and blushed before god for the sins of the people night in blush for the scarlet street of the red light district he didn't blush for the booze drinkers and the hellholes although as bad as it may be but he blushed because the sin of the elect and what we need to take is some more prophets with enough god in their heart to blush in the presence of god for the sins of the people who call themselves the people of god and doing the way they're doing what a disgrace we brought to this place the morals of our people this is not an easy subject to speak on i could think of many things that were easier to speak on but brother if somebody don't stand out in this simple adulterous day that we live in and call the course what's going to happen somebody has got to speak to things somebody's got to place it before the people perhaps ezra didn't want to do it but it was in his heart and when you see a servant of god get so sincere so he's on his face with his hands in the air of praying to god and blessing because the iniquity of the people then you're going to see a revival start a man cannot lay in the presence of god a church cannot stay in the presence of god under repentance unless the holy spirit comes down and gives function and power the sorrow move of god in that among those people just got to thee show me a man show me another calvin not any stinky or any of those who feels the burden of the people that'll lay on their face and cry and pray before god send us to john smith of the baptist church again who prayed all night for the iniquity of the people until his eyes would be swelled shut the next morning from weeping until his wife for leading to the table and feeding his breakfast out of his food show me of john wesley again our power brand that's from the five i'll show you a revival what we're doing today we're patting it on the back we're calling it this and that in the revival when there's no revival to it right there's a stirring of emotion of religion among the people but no revival they had a religious group in that day they had a stirs in that day but they needed a revival why my dear brother and sister the morals of this nation has become so long till it would make a dog ashamed it would make a helm blush if it could do so the immorals of our people the people even years ago the things that we have that the nation has done the things that the people have done it's all the lack of prayers the church that used to didn't believe and picture shows they wouldn't let their children go to picture show they would shun picture shows and today while they even have they had the picture show their own house every house has a television in the place where they used to think it was wrong to drink beer in a place where they used to take john farley home what a great honoree fellow he was today 60 of so-called christians take a social rank at least once a year then they get on a big spree around christmas when they have their celebrations because they have adopted education to take the place of salvation it'll never do it what we need is a revival we put corn plasters on take them off and another corn plaster and take it off and still find the pain is there what we need today is not social regeneration it's not intellectual talks what we need today is an old-fashioned god textbook transfusion from heaven the corn plasters won't do no good we are anemia amen we need a blood transfusion we need to come back to the old-fashioned gospel that calls out for repentance before god and not a dry eyed handshake protection but a god-sent holy ghost revival with the possession of the cleansing of the blood of the lord jesus christ in every human heart we need a revival to target the church and sweep the nation across we'll die we'll perish we are gone without that type of revival i'm so sick and tired of seeing little petty hollywood revival so-called where people come in and get emotionally stirred up for a couple hours and or a day or two or a week or two and go out and that's all of it brother you can be uh worked up by revival you can have emotion you can have good intentions all those things are fine but we don't need that today we need a baptism of the holy spirit to change the oceans and the intellect and the abuse the habits the life of the people and put them back on the right road again outside of the blood transfusions and calories all of our reformations won't do any good at all we don't need a union we have a you in there what they do god's name is never called they're afraid to call us he was once asked by the perjury group why didn't they have prayer they said it might have been somebody else or the others who didn't believe in god oh what we need is a revival don't make a difference we've got to preach the gospel i wouldn't give you a time for any program at least whether it's a you enter a big four or whatever it might be until this nation wakes up to the place that we're dying without the blood of the lord jesus christ until individuals wake up to this to their calls that we're dying the reason we are dying is without the original the way the remedy the cure that god gave us the calvary oh wonder it makes a man blush don't wonder a real true preacher look upon his congregation and try to lead them before the throne of god and visit their homes and find them smoking cigarettes telling dirty jokes to each other entertaining in the backyard with your party walking around on the streets for young women in middle age and so forth and even grandmother with a little shorts on mother out on the street with a baby on one arm just sexy enough to attract the attention of any food flavors off the street and calling themselves christians it'll make any true man of god blessed to bring such a person in the presence of god right and all of our joining church and getting a better class has come to nonsense and it did in that day and it will just bring us back to clubs not with the injection of education that was an injection of religious revelation not in the uh injection of some kind of man-made theology but an old-fashioned baptism of the holy ghost anger god out of heaven in a pentecostal experience of burning out the clarity and replacing in there the jew is caught into being there of the son and daughter of god till we do that brothers and sisters we will still have bob's hair makeup on sexy looking women and men drinking smoke and they call themselves christians because they don't know no better and their heart but very rude of carnality laser and we need a church cleaning up from the basement to the full field [Applause] and that's right what we needed is some blush in progress god sometimes people come to prayer to be prayed for looks like they're going to a house of real fame right coming to ask god for something looking like a jezebel probably need a day [Applause] and tell what's right what's wrong and preach the gospel without compromising until sinners paul is foreign oh god sends the holy spirit to being obedient amen that's right amen i preached here not long ago and said that every woman in this city was guilty in one way or the other but adultery they are but women go downtown here and they can hardly buy a dress unless it's so like they're important i'm not here to this is my own church i would like to preach what the holy spirit tells me to do let me tell you i'm not criticizing you my sister but don't the holy spirit teach you different if it doesn't i'm praying you didn't get the holy spirit right the holy spirit's not shouting the holy spirit start tasting in the spirit the holy spirit's not speaking in tongues the holy spirit is righteousness [Music] that when you dress yourself like that and walk down the street and man looked at you in the wrong way that at the judgment you may be as pure as the lady before your husband but as a judgment you'll be guilty of committing a doctor with the god that you've presented yourself to wonder it will make a person so wonderful when the bible said in the beginning that it grieved him that he made man he grieved the heart of god when he looked upon him in the days before the anti-losing destruction that he ever made a man what happened the sons of god saw the daughters of man would stand it was a perversion it was a sex mix-up it was that thing that drove the children of god from the garden of eden it was that thing that drove god's judgment to bring uh peace upon the earth it was that thing that caused and destroyed it was that same mixing up between women and man that caused sodom the lord is sinking the bottom of the dead sea he was told by the prophet he was told by the lord jesus that as it was in those days so will it be before the coming of the son of god we look today and see that the church is taking this pattern not out of the bible out of ruth and out of neoma and out of sarah and the ones in the bible but their pattern even the women of the church after hollywood and the very dragons of the devil how there are people who call themselves christians go out there and get this evil man's ways these records of evilest presley hear what his name is one of the most deluded stable possessed arthur godfrey and such as that and listen to them kind of nonsense on your radios and refuse to hear the gospel sermons preached in the bible god had mercy on you what kind of a spirit have we got among them that is right no wonder the prophet of god flesh before the lord he knew that was unrighteous and he stood and pleaded with him and say to god we're unrighteous and we are friends and until we can come back to that spot of a blood transfusion quit trying to put on plaster quit trying to put on some sag the healing can't come unless the bloodstream's right that's the reason if people got diabetes if one would ever cut itself it probably will never eat why because the real red blood cells is eat up and the whole church has become diabetic and every little cup that comes instead of walking on your pickaxe it can heal selfishness greed immorality everything else is in the calendar of god's wrong duty the church is picking up those habits man drinking smoking telling dirty jokes women cutting their hair wearing makeup doing all kinds of things dressing themselves immorally the face of people all those things are because it's the last of the blood of the lord jesus christ that may seem hard sure it's hard but it's the truth if we don't bash force the judgments of almighty cup you're going to be caught one of these days in an atomic explosion here that will send every soul out into eternity to be the god who only recognize the blood of his son christ jesus my advice to see you have come under the land my advice is to get back inside can't we have faith why can't we have greater healing than we do why can't we get ourselves poundability it's because we're putting on corn plasters because we're putting on stickers putting all pieces of tape we are trying to cover this thing up instead of saying we need a transfusion amen we're without love we're without crime don't let yourself be fooled don't let the devil pass you on the shoulders say well i go to church the devil does too brian be sure to come up to god went to church up in heaven come before the son of god with the sons of god set out with him had an audience with god he said where you've been to walk if you're in florida on the earth that's where you've been so the devil goes to church the devil belongs to church the devil acts like a christian he's a deceiver if he doesn't act like a christian and act like a church he would be a deceiver nobody could be deceiving his differences back and why is contrary to one another but the bible said that it'd be supposed to be to see the very elected party man that spirit in the last days friends are there it's time for the prophets of god oh brother for the preachers if you would say across the nation to follow their faith well i know there's 19 million baptist churches 19 million baptist brothers in america 13 million methods 11 million losers 10 million presbyterians mercy think of that and constantly the ball game the amusement and on wednesday night and sometimes on sunday night stay home to listen to the television and the radios of old drugs gags and jokes they pull from hollywood your soul going on that kind of stuff when your horse has your bible out somewhere laying out before god on your knees of praying for the sins of the country and i'm guilty with you i have made my mind up by the help and grace of god if i god will give me strength to do it i'm determined [Applause] in christ jesus until death shall set me free god see my help unto people help me is my prayer amen seeing the words and seeing the things that i have seen and you have seen and lagging behind and become a spiritual anemia and this tabernacle which is known throughout the entire world this little concrete block place sitting on the corner god has lifted you up before the nation i think of what david one night when he said here i am living in a house of cedar and the ark of my god dwells in the tents he said i have filled in the house nathan the prophet said do all in your heart called comments with you that night god appeared to nathan and today go tell david who was you david you were i took you from a sheet coat from attending the sheet and i made you a great name like great man of the nation who was in this little tabernacle sitting here a little old that was kicked out something setting on the corner of 8th and 10th street that harley jeffersonville little work was at and the people that come here today god by his mercy has picked you up and makes you a great people bombay indian knows where this tabernacle is setting down in new york all these other nations africa knows where this place is india germany england finland sweden europe asia their way down the middle and zion and down in their savior [Music] and god has made us an example to the people and to thank the nature god's [Music] of the world and become a very spiritual anemia are we ought to be in a lack that sit on the hill our candle that cannot be heard [Music] [Applause] that when men and women walk in that door on crutches [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and it blushes us in the presence of god the pain that the things that he's done for us how he's lifting us up from the shoot corner how he's made us known all over the world how he's done the great pain part and yet we really got him manual around and go out and we're not seem to be sincere we don't have prayer anymore things just don't like going live and we're trying to put on those programs corn plasters to ease the pain you can't ease the pain until you get good rich blood in there heal the things right you cut a little corn out you'll get yourself a diabetes and take your foot off don't try to dismiss this and bypass this and cut a corn plaster on this but the thing to do is come straight out before god and say god i am anemia and i need your blood to cleanse me from oh my god that's my prayer trust that it's yours think of these things friends one of these days it just is apt to happen before daylight in the morning as it is that happened 50 years and today one rocket bomb one of those coba are hydrogen bombs because the whole nation is on the learning you see in the paper the other day where they were requiring something the pentagon to answer the flying saucers it was a myth it wasn't something it imagined it was real it was an intelligence they flew in battle formation they could stop they could start they could spot they could tell it was an intelligence they knew it the people laughed they said flying soldiers made a fun out of it but you know what i'm thinking jesus said before he comes there will be signs in the heaven of us did you notice before he started or destroyed psalm anymore because of their sex affairs he sent angels down to investigators angels has come to the earth in the last few years they've been seen among people i mean honest bloodborish people who knows it they've even stood and had their pictures taken angelic bees has visited taking words back to the power that stand us heap towards pirates can hardly shine boom the whole worlds are really like a drunk man coming in at night right then among the christians among the elect they stole their birthright out for popularity the minister has swapped the gospel for a social calling he sparked the old-fashioned blood voice gospel for intellectual uh uh with the people that preach intellect talk of society and misuse the gospel many of them have went out into the field of preaching and used the gospel for personal gains to make money many of them have got big farms and cars things that they never would have had personal gains not all i'm thankful is there's still a remnant in the days of ezra when israel began to weep and to call out and rebuke the sin you know what happened all that he let the trusted god cut around him what we need today is men and women your preachers is preaching your churches and call sin sin and rebuke it the real people of god will get around up around you and stay with you that's right it's time to call out and save witches which separates right from wrong god granted to us that we'll have the courage to do it just think what could happen as i was telling you i believe this morning or heard someone said that upon one of these watchers that's watching us forget what you call it now for the bomb over the planes to come it's not long ago there was a program come through somewhere that they'd call out the big fleets with 300 jet bombers with atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs hanging on them not long ago at the big airport street board one of the bars was converted immediately he said freak out atomic bombs hanging right in the hangars i said aren't you and i mean in the in the planes and we go out and practice with them daily i said aren't you afraid that they haven't got the triggers in it but we're sold the alert that within the space of a minute 60 seconds we could have the triggers in there and gone and fueled up and ready to get flat england with them immediately the great hangers are sitting out in the oceans everywhere and they're saying to russia dare you drop one bomb just drop for an atomic bomb on the u.n or somewhere there and look what happens what will it be it will be an onslaught go to russia and if they would do that and start stopping those atomic and hydrogen bombs it would cause a chain reaction that would burn the earth to a wind just and smell it you know it wouldn't just be the scripture a bit or the earth shall burn to heaven soon the atoms of the earth shall burn we are living in a dangerous day we're living in the day when men of the world are scared today the great man they're [Music] [Applause] it ought to be the happiest time in the world for the christians time to go to chains the old will become young oh my death sort of freed away since the no more no more prayer meaning to receive no more prayer means for the lord but god shall come and take the elect from the four with the earth and shall get them under his own wings and we will live and reign with him forever in his heaven oh brother sister friend of mine if you're not prepared tonight may you be prepared at this hour i give you an invitation to come to christ jesus tonight and receive you that's been different you that know that you're not where you should be with god i invite you to the altar with myself i invite every one of you to come here and not only to save but to stay here until god has pinned your soul from everything that's unlike him until you say go out of here a new person not with the corn classroom but go out of here with a blood transfusion that purifies your blood and gives you new life and you hold it go out with the baptism of the holy spirit go out stop shouting not dancing not so much them danger all right they all belong in the church they all belong in the bible but what i'm talking about is the holy spirit god had love a young man was talking to me the other day his mother a dear woman i know the woman met her once or twice and she said oh honey to her boy come here i want you to look i have the oil in my hand well i have to that's where i've been sweating now that i've got oil in my hand so what do you think of that and the boy looked at his mother and said mother i want to ask you something she just wanted him to pray warning to pray that she'd have a kosher walk with god he said when the oil come in your hand they'll take away all your condemnation did they give you a sweet experience for god well they all know that they're not leaving alone that's it all the world the religious world the pentecostal people are looking for fantastic the world the educated so-called world the denominational world is looking for some great solution that they can uh embedded their denomination and get more members into it a million more people and the the nations are looking for some kind of a police force that can bring all the world to the knees and bring righteousness brother it doesn't come by pentecostal fantastic neither does it come by protestant organizations are by catholic hierarchy neither does it come by pentagons or turn new pages it comes by surrendered back to jesus christ through the baptism of the holy ghost anything short of that it's wrong let us pray i'll ask your sister to come to the organ or the piano this time while we're in prayer while every person has her head bowed and every person in prayer i wonder at this moment if you would test your spirit against the word of god are you right after this service i was i told you i got a mother-in-law laying on her at the very part of death i got to do she's dying other friends i don't know here that a visit it's laying at the point of death people who set this church oh brother sister you're coming down there too you've got to come down there now you say well i i know that brother graham i mean to get that thing fixed up some of these days but it may not be some of these days for this may be the only day how little does that man know coming from california going to michigan the other day with his little wife up here driving the car him in the pickup going to their new home and just retired from the navy how well did he know when he started off that morning maybe from a tourist court that his wife and baby would be a corpse in a few minutes but just above henryville there their car collided with the bus the driver made the the his vehicle do a jackknife almost but it's killed the woman and the little girl i trust that their soul was rightly gone a few weeks ago when brother woods and i went up here to an airplane that fell back behind that glacier and watched them pull pieces of eight man's body when heads and legs and arms was all over the place picking up the body in the intro falling out of the man's body a good man perhaps a famous man from chicago when that man got in the plane that morning i wonder the night that he went to church if he had good intentions did the pastor give an altar call did he rebuke sin and the man had a chance or did he go out like an animal was the man in the heart of god a son of god think of those things friends they are important they are not only important they are the most important thing to you this hour this is the time when you'll make up your mind this is the time when you may make your decision of this life or the life you're after may you do it while we pray heavenly father as we read in the bible of what you said about sin and those who do it and not confess we realize what it means to die without knowing god we know that by experience of others that we have seen goals those who intended those who cut it off too long god those who had professed and not possessed what they said they had those who had acted like christians and yet never was a christian their life proved it and their death made it manifest now father i pray that you'll speak to every heart here tonight and myself lord for being military for many things that i could have done and did not do i can pass my own i'll confess the wrongs of this people i can test the wrongs of this nation i ask you to have mercy lord i've got three little children there to raise and we're living here in a hot spot call it no neither running you know all about it god i want to be right with you someday if the atomic bomb don't get us a wreck will if a wreck don't get us some disease will something has got to take us but we're so happy to know that there is a way of escaping the name of the lord is a is a tower and the righteous running their head on our state god made the sinner friend of the night boy girl man or woman see the open door the opportunity and run to christ this hour now while we have our heads out some here or i know there's some here that would like to save with an uplifted hands of god i'm ashamed of my life and i i want to confess my wrongs before god and ask for mercy raise up your hand to god god bless you god bless you god bless you to many of you many of you yes there's many of you here too that's god bless you many of you here who have professed christianity for a long time and know that you have failed to toe the line with god know that you're doing things right now that you ought not to do and you're going unconfessingly just loosely floating along with the tide looking at the kind of programs you should not look at look at the kind of magazines and reading the literature that you should not read that's not becoming to christians listening to the jokes of the file and dirt and smut that you know you shouldn't do both men and women you know places where you could have spoken did not do it and you're guilty maybe this cynical mission i wonder if you'd raise your hand of christ to have mercy on you and forgive you raise your hand god bless you young lady as the woman walks out to come to the altar to confess her raise your hand to god god bless you that's right that's right god bless you raise your hand you know you're done wrong i wonder if you had the courage tonight to meet me here at the altar let's kneel around here and say god be merciful to all of us we're in need of you god bless you ladies to see these young women coming weeping life before them they're at the crossroads they're a victim of circumstances what do you realize old man when we were boys our boys has got 10 times the temptation that we had sister do you realize that your daughter has 10 times the temptation you had when you was a girl what will her daughter have look at the things the pictures of devils of painting oh how we need to now pray want to go back to you again brother to your eyes we don't pray half as much as our fathers did pastor do you know we don't put as much time on our knees as the pastors before us did women do you realize you don't instruct your daughter and pray with her act like your mother did you then what about who's guilty we're guilty there's no way around it we're guilty [Music] i'm guilty i'm guilty of not doing the job of god like i should do i'm confessing it that i'm wrong i'm asking god to be merciful to me i look out here and see the opportunities i've missed because of petty things little insignificant things that didn't mean nothing i'm ashamed of myself as a gospel minister before you i repent before god and ask god to forgive me and the church to forgive me for being so diliterate about the work of god by the grace of god and by the help of god i've i'll not listen to what everyone trying to tell you something to do they got a program they got something for you to do now i'm saying i know god's program is written i hear the bible amen i'm ashamed of myself as a minister of the gospel one million souls won or to have 10 million souls one i'm a way behind what about you how many souls you want that you've been a christ christianity just goes from one to another how many souls you won since you've been a christian if you're not winning souls you're guilty you're your broke shame on the church in the gospel how many people you get out for wednesday night for our meeting if you're not doing it you ought to be ashamed of yourself before crying you're guilty and your place is at the altar i invite you to come with me for repentance [Music] [Applause] and when you bow your heads and keep about a minute well i feel my guilt and would like your repentance [Music] us being so military concerning the things of the kingdom i ask that your partner take away our uh our transgressions and foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] old magazines [Music] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] [Music] who [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] of our faith god's greatest [Music] [Music] [Music] is thank you [Music] [Applause] i'm done oh lord i have heard my voice [Music] [Music] oh [Music] lord [Music] lord i pray [Music] along the older nights among my brethren is the only order i'm glad to see tonight about as many man as there is women use this of women can easily break their hearts or something about them could easily be touched because of the feminists they're they're ladies and you can sometimes touch them but i'm so glad to see the holy spirit can touch man too and bring them to the altar and i wonder how many of you have the alters meltdown that feels that you have made a consecration of god that you're going out of here tonight to live a better life for the grace of god and to do more for the kingdom of god and for his calls would you raise your hand to christ if you're around the order and say i believe that now i have repented and god bless you how many of you back there feel if you repented in your seat feel like you want to do better god bless you thank you now let us stand you're here to alter face around that way if you want are you your daughter raise your hands out there that you desire their prayer that you may continue on will you raise your hands to the ones in the elders or now you raise your hands back here to all over here that you read that desire their prayers to that will god will help us to do may the lord jesus bless us now don't forget the sunday night service had your word to say brother amen that's saying draw me nearer [Music] thy love to [Music] drones [Music] the crossword [Music] lord to thy precious leading side and consecrate me now to thy service lord by the power of grace divine let my soul look up with a steadfast hope [Music] lord to the cross where thou hast draw me near near mirror blessed lord to thy precious bleeding sign oh the pure delight [Music] draw me nearer nearer near a blessed lord to thy precious bleeding side there are depths of love that i cannot know till i cross that narrow sea there are heights of joy that i may not reach till i rest in peace with thee you're draw me nearer [Music] lord to the cross where thou hast died draw me near nearer [Music] i was thinking of the scripture where the disciples said this is a hard saying who can hear it and it's difficult to hear some of these things i was reading the answer that jesus gave and part of that answer he says it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life and i believe we've heard the words of god tonight not just to direct our flesh but to know that in his spirit as we receive that word that that's life to us so i believe that there is a people that can hear those hard sayings and can take it to heart and be changed by them and i just pray that you and i are part of that number let's sing make me more like thee [Music] make thee jesus may be more like thee forgive me a heart that's filled with love and make me more [Music] live your work live your life through me jesus live your life through me give me your heart it's filled with love o live your life through me and speak your word through me jesus speak your word through me oh give me that's filled with love and speak your work and lord prepare me to be a sanctuary [Music] tried and true we're thanksgiving [Music] i'll be [Music] once more oh lord prepare me isn't he good to be a sanctuary [Music] pure [Music] tried and true [Music] with thanksgiving [Music] [Applause] sanctuary [Music] you are the place where god's chosen to dwell i was listening to an indian man speaking on the radio they were going to put a copper mine on his holy place oak ridge or something like that and he was trying to express the pain that he would have that somebody would try to put a copper mine on his holy place he said it would be just like putting a copper mine in your holiest of your temple or your synagogue or your mosque and i thought of how many times we let our hearts which are supposed to be a sanctuary it's just supposed to be a holy place we just let the dirt and the filth of this world come and contaminate it but lord open our eyes lord help us and believe that he will there's a little song we sang once it's not entrying but entrusting it's an f i think we have the words to that it's not in trying but entrusting it's not in running but in resting [Music] it's not in one dream but in praise that we find the strength of the lord it's not in trying but entrusting [Music] it's not in running but in resting it's not in one drink but in praying that we find the strength of the lord one more time it's not in trying but entrusting it's not in running but in resting [Music] it's not in wandering but in praying that we find the strength of the lord and we have a testimony praise came in of the strength of the lord while we were listening to the tape from brother dan roberts it says
