[Music] you're [Music] [Applause] [Music] was glory to his name glory to his name [Music] glow to him and i am so wondrously safe jesus so sweetly abides within there was glory to his [Music] glory to his name [Music] i am so glad i have there had said and he keeps me clean glory to his name glory to his name [Music] glory to his precious name there to my heart was [Music] oh come to this fountain so rich and [Applause] may to his name [Music] glory to his name glory to his precious [Music] there to my heart was a blood applied blessed is a man i was just reading where god david said god does not impute sin or iniquity amen what a wonderful blessing we have [Music] just a couple of requests to bring to your attention brother robert figueroa sent me a text a little while ago that our brother steve buckles was in icu with kovid so let's remember our brother steve and then we had mentioned that brother tony ramirez had fallen recently and he struck his head fairly hard they'd take him taken him over to emergency and they didn't find any concussion or anything but he let me know yesterday that he's still suffering from he's afraid to drive right now he's not too sure and things and he said i don't feel bad but something is wrong and they said if it didn't straighten up soon that they would probably have to do another examination so he kind of kids me a little bit because he's fallen a few times he says i'm getting quite good at it and but he just asked us that we would remember him in prayer and then brother alex oberlick he says he's thankful that the knee surgery went smoothly and without complications i'm so thankful that we can look up to you look to him in the time of need so god bless you that's for my brother alex so appreciate that brother peter if you would make your way up here if you could and we'll stand we'll pray over these needs and hi brother peter and then he was going to sing a song and preach a certain no i'll preach the sermon sing a song so we'll let him start and [Music] um it's the privilege of being the emcee you get to embarrass everybody brother peter i appreciate brother peter i really do it's been a public jam with us to become a daddy and responsibility of a family but he's taking it on along with quite a bit other challenges and then lending himself and giving his heart to minister to the body of jesus christ so we'll have him pray over the needs and the service and then he said he had a song so thank you lord god it's good to be here amen let's all pray lord jesus we're so grateful that you're mindful of us lord that you love us and that you see our our needs and before the start of the world before the foundation of the world father you met that need in your own blood and your own sacrifice father you paid the price that we could have our needs met lord that we could have a way to come back to you pray father for every need that's here for for their buckles and for each of the others lord for brother tony ramirez thank you for this knee surgery going well lord for every need that wasn't written down even the needs we don't know about just commit them to your hands trusting in you father in jesus name amen [Music] so i uh i don't have a sure man but i do have a verse that i i thought i'd just read and then i i didn't give sister lily or sister grace any warning on this song so if it doesn't go too well it's not their fault but [Music] if you could just put up luke 21 and 18 and question while that's coming up what value do you put on a hair of your head maybe not a lot of value you've got plenty or not too many but you'd probably take a dollar for one but the writer of this bible has put value on the hairs of your head he said not one of not a hair of your head would perish that's that's how interested he is in you and as a body sometimes we don't know what part we are in the body and we think maybe we're just an eyelash but if you're just an eyelash when the bride is standing at the end there won't be an eyelash missing and so he's he's mindful of you so i want to just sing this song i've been wanting to sing it for a while now let me get the words if you know it you can sing it if you don't know it you can still sing it [Music] maybe you could be seated i don't want you to have to be standing [Music] ladies and gentlemen may i have your attention i'd like to introduce to you in this [Music] there stands a champion cold and white his height exceeds the heavens his weight outweighs the world his reach it reaches everywhere his age is ever more he is higher than the highest he's greater than the grave no one could ever take his crown away [Music] he's more mighty than the mightiest he reigns from above he's the all time undisputed undefeated champion of love he left his hometown to enter this arena to raise his hands in victory for you and for me an angry cried crowd crucify this king who bore the crown and they gladly watched the champion going down but i will never count him out for i'm a witness of the day he arose to retain the title champion of love he is higher than the highest is greater than the grade no one could ever take his crown away he's more mighty than the mightiest he reigns from above he's the all-time undisputed undefeated champion of love would you sing it with me he's higher than the highest he's greater than the grave no one could ever take his crown away he's more mighty than the mightiest he reigns from above he's the all time undisputed undefeated champion of love praise his name i wonder if there's a song sister literally doesn't know does it have to be probably a spanish song that she's never heard appreciate the musicians helping him [Applause] i mentioned to her they were going to put her to the test and she was up to it so amen shall um let's see who our sister amelia you said you had a song and brother ed dougal has the microphone back there if you would just like to give a testimony or praise but not necessarily want to come up front we can also take if you just want to say i love the lord jesus it'll be with him i'll say sister maddy a few it's a song i'm looking for a city but the one she is [Music] [Music] jordan i would like to say something here we have no continuing city but we seek one to come i'm looking for a city but when i made my hands i'm looking over jordan until i see the promised land the waters will be parted and all be on my way as we're crossing over jordan i can say now i have better lasting joy within since he came and took away my sin the moment that he blessed me he made me fully whole with that everlasting joy within my soul i'm drinking from the fountain therefore from my high a well the blessed waters that never shall run dry i'm feasting on god's manner i'm praying day by day and that everlasting joy is here to stay [Music] since he came and took away my sin the moment that he blessed me he made me fully whole with that everlasting joy within my soul i've heard the prophet's message i placed it in my heart i've got the revelation that never shall depart the rapture is upon us the stage is said to go we have this precious promise [Music] in my soul [Music] she's two for two i like that looking not looking for this city but in the city where the lamb is the light if there were two in the verse or two in the city where the lamb is the light sister martha few and the girls would be [Music] there's a country far beyond the starry sky there's a city where there never comes a night if we're faithful we shall go thereby [Music] not a shadow can my

come up you may be seated i was waiting for my daughter abby to get here the last time we they were all here and i said oh that all the garage girls are here and we can call them all up to sing and they all walked out and they didn't come in for a while so i was getting a bit nervous but they were practicing the song getting the key ready so i sent abby a text and let her know what we were doing today and she said don't call on me dad because i'll turn out and round out the door and i said good we'll turn the video cameras up and we'll catch that and she says oh they'll just see a little ball of dust headed on its way to mexico and i said we'll take a bath it'll be a clean getaway this is the kind of what i do with my girls so and they expect it and i'll hear about it later so i said she has a song here i just wanted to make a comment here about this one this one we all know great is thy faithfulness um it's always uh strange to me how life can turn so quickly and suddenly and the last couple of months have been extremely difficult i had the surgery in august thank god that went well i'm good my catheter's working lots to be thankful for in that lots of trials but what i realized through this time is always how we can bank on the lord because he is faithful if he wasn't faithful we wouldn't have anything to hold on to at all but he's faithful and because of that we can come to him time time time again and he is that steady rock anchor so if you've seen this with me as well [Music] great is thy faithfulness oh god my father there is no shadow of turning with thee thou [Music] changed my compassion thou forever will be summer and winter spring time and harvest sun and stars in their [Music] faithfulness great is my faithfulness morning by morning blue mercies [Music] have provided thy faithfulness [Music] to cheer and [Music] is [Music] all i have [Music] is [Music] faithfulness [Music] no mercies [Music] have rolled is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] taste so sweet to trust in jesus [Music] yes i want to be able to see the words sorry they're all tied up together here uh we're going to have to change the words i'm so glad [Music] to trust in jesus just to take him at his word just to rest upon his promise just to [Music] jesus [Music] jesus jesus precious jesus [Music] jesus just [Music] jesus [Music] jesus precious jesus oh for grace to [Music] trust in [Music] life jesus [Music] jesus hope for grace to trust [Music] jesus jesus jesus jesus [Music] to [Music] brother jordan has something he wants to show us some some things that the the church has been doing and he's got some pictures and he's going to narrate it also so we can do that as this time i do it from back there okay it's good to worship the lord that's good to to honor him in song in praise and testimony just just to say i love the lord jesus he's been so good to me and just uh i i think that she's the only one i'm saying with so naomi you're next some of the girls have learned to say no well actually brother green or brother aaron kind of asked me to say share some of this um we don't probably talk a lot about what we do you can put that up brother peter if you want we don't talk a lot probably about what we do mission wise here at the church but we do do some missions and we've been doing more and so these are just some things that we've done just real recently that i just thought i would share um i we shared it with the brothers this is just a quote from brother branham i thought was real nice he says so i've watched for something if that be so when it's later then it's later than you think if not then there's coming one with a message that's straight on the bible and a quick work will circle the earth the seeds will go in newspapers reading material until every predestinated seed of god has heard it none of them will come unless the fathers drawed them and everyone the father has drawed will hear it and come that'll be the predestinated seed we'll hear the word we there were some pictures that brother berry coffee had requested that we had here at the church and we sent a couple hundred uh when we were back east we took them there by his by his place and he sent them um he's been doing a lot of work with the different brothers and so forth overseas and the place he had decided to send these uh photos was to malawi and it's just a little place here in east africa and this was just something i just wanted to kind of highlight this is something brother green and sister sandra you know had been real big into you know having and providing these photos and sometimes you don't think much about a photo but you know brother branham talks about if you put you know the little boy that had the sail the boat in his room and the ocean and he grew up and became a sailor and sometimes you know we have all these other things in our home whatever they may be or maybe it's nothing or just sayings or or whatever something from cracker barrel saying or something but i thought how many times do we want to have something that's you know the lord jesus you know a picture or or the pillar of fire or something like that so when we sent these photos to brother barry and took him over to him he don't sent them to africa malawi is where he wanted them to go the center color photo we didn't provide he's printing those at about 10 000 at a time but the ones in the black and white which we had left over those original kind of black and white ones is the ones we had sent over there uh or sent to him to send over and so you can just see the different the brothers and sisters that are just excited to have these and you'll see just the different kind of locations they're at when they get them and and kind of what what it means and special to them there's a couple videos here that'll just uh let you hear this video i hope the audio is okay if it isn't we'll just skip it but we'll just see how this how this audio works here on this he's a very well established pastor in this part of the country and i would like to just have to just have a little bit of time let him express for himself how long have you been a pastor for over 23 years in this part of the country southern malawi in the lower over 23 years that's right and how many cyber churches have you got we've got 13 supply chains and they're still waking up you have 13 satellite churches and you are still evangelizing sure that means god is still calling his children we are places that we have we haven't established yet but people are coming from there to go into this satellite church and some of them traveling for over 15 kilometers 15 kilometers that's fine thank you so if you heard there he has all these satellite churches and has been doing mission work for 23 years there and the people come from i think 50 kilometers is what he said there so just different other photos and so forth but i just we just want to share those one of the project we're getting ready to work on um and i'll be honest with you i forgot i meant to bring my phone but it's a supernatural series we're going to be helping with the translation of it in a particular language do you remember brothers which language that was was that arabic or russian yeah was it arabic i believe it was arabic so that's another project um that was uh we're getting ready to work on with with them all um and this is just a little video here them singing as they received the books and and the the photos and so forth [Music] oh [Music] my [Music] i [Music] amen just to see that others what has been precious to us they get to see it too amen jesus has a table spread where the saints of god are fed he [Music] all the time [Music] is up [Music] jesus [Applause] [Music] of heaven will assemble [Music] jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen what a day that'll be a gathering of people that maybe on this earth will never get to know them but on that side here you'll have forever and forever and forever to share amen is there anybody that would like to maybe just give a testimony you know you could do it from the just to praise something and raise your hand or i'll raise it for you amen brother ed if you want to just give him the microphone there well i was gonna well that's loud i was gonna say this when we got up to sing but i'll just say it now um when sarah was talking about the lord being so faithful um i quit my job two and a half years ago thinking i would just find another one and you know take a break while i didn't know that the pandemic would happen and that i would have serious health issues and be unable to work now it's been two and a half years and out of nowhere people started asking if they could order cookies from me and it just started a business and i look and i think i don't know how my needs are going to be met but the lord has been so faithful and i was showing my mom a couple days ago all the orders i have and this is not a shameless business plug but um all the orders i have lined up and i was like god you're so good to me you are so good to me you've you've kept your word and you've supplied all my needs and i just thank you for that and another little thing i told some people but it just meant a lot to me um asher and chloe like to come to my sunday school room so i do a little sunday school with them sunday nights and abel comes and we just do a little i simplify that day's lesson for them and my lesson had been on the church in the book of acts how do we look like that church what do we do that they did and i was talking about how we are the church and how we are the church to each other and so the kids were telling me different ways that we help each other and one of them says well we pray for each other and abel tells me i have a stuffy nose and i said oh are you asking for us to pray he's like yeah and i was like well he immediately recognized that's what we do i can go to you when i need prayer so we all held hands and i began praying and i hear asher next to me and he's three i hear him next to me and he is not repeating my prayer but he is praying on his own just crying out to the lord for abel lord would you touch abel would you heal him and he's just on his own just heartfelt praying and it moved me because i'm like they're three and four and they instantly got our little lesson and put it into practice right there and i could barely finish the prayer i was like try not to cry but it just so moved me to feel like the lord has a-blessed me with this sunday school class but just to see it continuing on in the lives of these little ones so it just really encouraged me abe amen then to see sister martha with her daughter singing up here you know you you go out and maybe your neighbors or somebody doesn't know and the kids are doing things that you go oh my if those kids grow up to go in that type of life what will they be but to see the blessing that we get to have our children raise in the admonition of the lord and begin to do those things amen now i know some of my other girls were going to sing so if they'd make ready anybody else that has a testimony just something they'd like to share something they'd like to say brother robert he's bringing up the mic there from behind you i just want to give honor and glory and praise to the lord for the many times that he has me from it could have been an accident i was driving down the street and all of a sudden this it happened twice this woman just ran by right in front of me if i had been going fast i probably would have hit her very you know and or she would have hit me or i would hit here but god protected me and i'm thankful to the lord because he has been so good to me hello so i just wanted to give a testimony today is see if i say without crying um today is the year anniversary of me being healed from clicking issues and so it was actually about almost a week ago brother adams prayed for me and then it was you know he said i would have faith for you and i held on to that and then i was tested that week and then saturday which would have been today's date is when i chose to stand on my own face and praise the lord it's gone and i'm healed and i just want to give him honor and glory for that [Music] thank you for the crosstalk thank you for the sin price shame in love you came and gave amazing grace [Music] now is [Music] you jesus [Music] the treasure of heaven is and gave amazing grace [Music] your forgiveness [Music] victorious [Music] the

amen so anybody have a testimony anything else they'd like to share sister barbara anybody else have a song they'd like to sing or maybe a song request we could all sing so sister barbara and then brother tim over here well i i really it's always i feel so self-conscious when i get up to say anything but this is a special month this october because last year at this time my son jeffrey been in the hospital a whole month he went in the middle of september with bleeding the doctors couldn't find where he was bleeding from they gave him several different scopes i guess looking for where the bleeding was coming from and they couldn't find the location he continued to have blood transfusions about every other day for six weeks finally the doctor told my daughter where he lives up in phoenix i'm sorry we've done everything we can just take him home and as we quit giving him blood transfusions he'll die so we called our son that lives in new hampshire and joseph came out in november jeffrey was released from the hospital and we were going to have our last supper a thanks early thanksgiving with jeffrey so he came from from the hospital on i don't know friday or saturday and we had the big thanksgiving dinner on saturday sunday morning we went to church and at the end of the service i noticed my grandson was wheeling jeffrey down to the front for prayer and they hadn't asked for prayer or anything but jeffrey didn't die fusions from the fluid retention and he started losing the weight and he's been fine for a year amen so this morning brother aaron when you said you knew that god healed your neighbor just doesn't know right but we serve a a god that heals and delivers and saves and we are so blessed so this is a special month because jeffrey was in the hospital from the end of september middle of september actually until the first week in november and he's fine and i praise god praise god amen [Applause] brother tim cruz over there brother ed isn't he good to us isn't he wonderful we should all be able to say i i have a testimony i know the lord has been good to me i know lord has done wonderful things for me you know some of us do get the privilege to stand behind the pulpit and share those but all of us have a testimony no okay it should be on now can you um i just wanted to thank the lord for uh a few months ago i had a neck injury and it was just kind of constant pain and it would give me headaches um and it lasted for like four or five months and i don't know what caused it uh but i uh the brothers prayed for me and anointed me with oil and the time went by and then uh i just noticed actually a few weeks ago i'd forgotten about it and and it just doesn't hurt i couldn't even turn my neck all the way you know without it cracking and popping and doing all kinds of weird things but it's it's gone and it hasn't come back amen praise god [Applause] all right they are gonna sing and i'm gonna pay for it [Music] there are some things i may not know [Music] are some places [Music] but i am [Music] one sure my god is real for i can feel him in my soul my god [Music] is love for me [Music] is [Music] but [Music] and god i is tell just how you felt when jesus took your sins away [Music] foreign [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] amen amen brother dave you've got a testimony you'd like to share wait did i get your name wrong yeah the pilot come on it you're the only pilot here maybe share a little bit of what the lord has done for you in in what you do some of us who've always wanted to do some of those things never been able to thank god for that i think everybody has a testimony you know and i'm not one to get up in front and yeah uh talk or this kind of thing but um you we speak of healing you know and sometimes a testimony isn't so much in the healing that you would you would like to have you know um so i don't know like 13 years ago i uh i was always fairly active you know and we would um get out me and sharon would get out with the young kids and and play you know volleyball and different things and we were playing uh frisbee frisbee um uh cameron it's a it's a kind of a frisbee game you know ultimate frisbee and so we're out there and um and i'm just playing with a bunch of 12 year olds you know in in but i mean i'm playing like i'm 30 you know because i'm not going to have 12 year olds beat me you know and so we're playing frisbee and i jump i put everything i got into this this jump and i you know get up there and i try to go for this and when i came back down uh the top of my leg fell off the bottom of my leg you know so my my knee just kind of separated like this and i it's been a constant uh reminder of how i'm not the same anymore you know and we would look at that and be like oh that's not a very good testimony you know but when i look back i knew i can kind of see hindsight's 2020 and you can kind of look back and and maybe see it's tough when you in the moment thanking god for like a trial you know and those aren't like the cool testimonies uh you know but i can look back and unfortunately um i was fairly athletic and i i kind of i was thinking man i'm pretty you know pretty squared away here you know and i think that was his way of maybe correcting that a little you know so it's unfortunate that uh it's unfortunate that i needed that lesson you know but um i thank god just the same you know and so some of our testimonies are um uh we still you know there's kind of uh silver linings and clouds and things you know i you have to go through pt tests and i still have somewhat of an active job and different things you know that it has never held me back i've never failed a pt test whenever i've needed it i've had my knee now i haven't been able to show off maybe as much as i would like but that's probably for the better anyway so it's a testimony in some in a little way i have another one actually um so uh testimonies probably mean more to yourself than than other people because you're not the one in you know in the the situation and you don't um so i forget exactly what it was that that happened to him but andrew had something in and he scratched his eye pretty bad maybe it was several months ago almost a year ago maybe um and it was one of those things where i mean just just i mean a centimeter of difference would have could have cost an eye and things like that and he's just he's more active than i was you know he's more athletic than i used to be you know and so man my heart would almost just break because i feel like i know what it's like to have something taken away even for for the good but you never want to see that for somebody else you know maybe you go through things sometimes too so that you can kind of feel for other people you know so everyone's got a testimony [Applause] if we only knew how many times god watched over us things that could have been i have a pair of sunglasses i haven't thrown away but there's a scratch on him from top to bottom that when the camper shell came down the sunglasses took him but it would have been my eyeball had it not been and unfortunately the older we get it seems the slower we react the harder we fall that's just just don't seem to be a roll away from some of the things now but god's been good to us yesterday or i guess it was friday i was doing some work and they have the uh rebar that they put up and they put the orange caps on top of them now so if somebody falls they don't impale themselves and as i was walking into the house i saw the young man putting those on and it reminded me that if it wasn't for the orange cab i would have had a gash in my leg back here quite deep and probably would have required surgery i turned slipped and fell right on it and being the young man that i am i quickly recovered in about a week now uh i got up as quick as i could and looked around and said who saw me that's all i was worried about till i got home i've got a scar probably about four inches long a couple inches wide where that orange cap ripped the skin off but if the orange cap hadn't been there i probably would have had to go have my leg repaired and i saw that orange cap and i said thank you lord because that orange cap was on there sometimes we don't realize how god takes care of us and he does he's mindful of us now brother lyle and sister heather have a song and brother lyle also has some things he would like to share with us for a few minutes and maybe we'll we'll end on that so let's stand and let's just sing brother brandon called it the bride song it's amazing grace and it really became real to me when we went to my uncle's funeral my dad's one of my dad's younger brothers who had gotten cancer and he had began to listen to the message he had been pentecostal began to listen to the message and he had told my dad when as soon as god heals me i'm moving to tucson and i'm going to go be with you so they called my dad and told dad if you want to see your brother alive you better come dad got to see him but he passed away soon after that i went with dad back to the funeral in california the memorial service and he had belonged to a pentecostal church that we had been raised in and the minister got up and he ministered and he said we don't know where our brother john is today because he left our pentecostal church and we're not sure where he's at today and you know there was an assurance in me and my father where he was but the people got real quiet and the minister of the church was a very good friend a pastor a good friend of ours growing up with them he got up and he was embarrassed he kind of looked at us and he was very embarrassed and he said well i don't really know about that but he goes let's sing brother john's favorite song and they begin to sing amazing grace and brother brown said that's the bride song amazing grace it was a confirmation to me and my dad that everything was okay maybe they didn't understand but god being mindful of us had a signature [Music] how sweet [Music] but now [Music] and if you've lived a few years you can sing a song through many dangers [Music] i have already [Music] his grace as god may save us [Music] when we've been there ten thousand shine as the sun [Music] now let's praise him he's worthy of all place praise god praise god praise god praise lord praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god [Music] praise god praise god amen brother lyle sister heather you may be seated thank you [Music] i think we found one that she didn't know and and i'm certain that the key that i sing in is one that's not part of the piano but this particular song and i shouldn't say she doesn't know because she had their practice a little bit this afternoon that's the one yep but this song is about the third exodus and i first heard it and maybe the only time i ever heard it was in the easter meetings at random tabernacle in 1974 and sister rebecca smith sang this song and i wrote the words down and uh i've looked around i haven't found it on the internet doesn't mean it's not there it just means that i don't know how to search very well on the internet probably but this song should be a real encouragement to us it's a it's a song that's basically saying in my mind keep your eyes on jesus don't lose sight of the gold keep your eye on the ball keep going don't give up it's it's uh i think it's called the third exodus that's what i called it anyway [Music] in the days of old king pharaoh god's people were enslaved in bondage to that wicked king till they laid down in the grave they cried to god in heaven our lord is hard to bear then said moses thus saith god and showed the lord's almighty [Music] work on it won't be long there's just one more exodus god's gonna lift your heavy load god changed the water into blood darkness filled the land and all the wicked felt the touch of the lord's almighty hand all egypt lost their firstborn death took king pharaoh's son then he let god's people go that was exodus number one we're gone there's a crowd away [Music] press on to victory there's one more exodus coming god's gonna set his people free by a pillar of fire he led them to the distant promised land their god himself would be made flesh and live amongst them as a man he walked the road to calvary he rose again that's true then sent to us the holy ghost that was exodus number two [Music] come out of her my people was the eagle cry we heard as elijah to this last church age turn the hearts back to the word he knew his days were numbered so food for us he stored and warned us to seek perfect love apply the token to your door look up the savior's coming [Music] to begin the jubilee look up the savior's coming it is exodus number three what's gone on will soon be with us [Music] i see we're all practicing social distancing nobody up front except heather okay um i'd like to just pray for a moment together before i read the word lord jesus this has been such a privilege and an honor to be here amongst your people to hear testimonies to sing songs of worship and just to know that your presence is here with us lord and i pray that you'd help me in these few words that have been quickly prepared lord that they would have meaning and help those that are here lord we commit ourselves in this time again to you in jesus name well he started it she pushed my buttons we know how to provoke reactions anger retaliation we know how to allow differing opinions to divide us our nation is as divided and polarized now as i've ever seen it in my life most of today it's about hurt feelings and offenses not about wars or great social issues like slavery or persecution well the other day brother aaron settled email to peter and i and they asked if we might have an exhortation and well i feel that part of my mission here is to support and help brother aaron so i raised my hand and said sure then i thought what's an exhortation what what does that word even really mean does it mean to stand up and scold to preach to to assert to proclaim to punish no no the word exhortation means encouragement to exhort someone is to encourage them to do something if we could have the hebrews 10 brother so i got to digging into the message a bit and digging into the scriptures a bit and don't worry it looks like i have a lot of notes but that's multiple copies of the song it's this i'm not going to keep you tied up here but hebrews 10 i'm sorry i'm so used to having a a microphone attached well i'll try and stand still it's difficult for me but paul's talking here and he says let us consider one another and and we could also think of that as let's be considerate of one another thoughtfully how to provoke now we know how to provoke anger but how can we encourage how can we spur how can we motivate one another unto love and to good works good works things deeds acts that reflect that love 10 supposed to be 24 i'm sorry brother 24 and 25. yeah now you can follow along a little more easily verse 25 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together this is the first church ages this is paul this is the very beginning and people are already well i'm not sure what they preach over there i'm gonna go somewhere else it it reminds me a little bit of the story that i heard a fellow was asked when he uh if he was you know abandoned on some desert island somewhere and we couldn't find anybody else what's the first thing you do build a fire put up a tent find shelter look for food no no i i'd start a church oh and what's the second thing that you do well i'd start another church well why would you do that well i might not like what they said at the first one so paul's dealing with this very same problem not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together meeting together for worship and instruction as a manner of some is but exhorting encouraging one another and so much the more faithfully especially now as you see the day of christ's return approaching if we could go to colossians 3. starting at verse 12 so yes sorry about that i've i've got a different translation here in my notes put on therefore as the elect of god those who've been chosen of god holy and beloved do you know that you are beloved of god you are his beloved the price that he paid and he paid that price because you're his beloved holy and beloved put on this isn't put on like like a like an actor puts on and pretends to be something else but it's but it's clothe yourselves with a heart of compassion tender hearted mercy kindness humility god's no respecter of persons there's no big eyes and little use we're all at the same level clothe yourself with that humility clothe yourselves with that gentleness and that patience humbleness of mind meekness long suffering for bearing one another bearing with one another it means to make allowance for each other's faults we're not all the same and forgiving one another forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any not just with your brothers and sisters not just somebody in church not some philosophical or doctrinal disagreement anyone anyone who has a complaint forgiving anyone who offends you even as or just as christ forgave you so also do ye that's not a request that's a commandment we're encouraged to do that to forgive um i don't know i i happened to stumble across a news article the other day that that in the last several days in haiti 17 missionaries were captured by a gang and they're holding them for a ransom they want a million dollars per person including there's a couple of little kids in that group and if they don't get the money they're threatening to kill them now these are amish and mennonite missionaries and what is their response to this is their response well where's the government where's the soldiers let's send in the police let's let's mount a rescue let's call in an air strike no no their response this gives us an opportunity to practice what our lord taught us to love our enemies to do good to them that despitefully use you and persecute you what would your response be what would mine be anger vengeance or love and prayer earnestly reaching out to the lord on behalf of not only those that have been captured but on their captors what a response i i wasn't sure how i felt about my witness and my testimony in that circumstance verse 14. paul says don't stop there no in addition to all these things above all these things we have more to do put on clothe yourselves another layer around gentleness and meekness and patience long-suffering kindness put a layer around that of love which is the bond of perfectness the perfect bond of unity it's the perfect glue that holds us together more than super glue more than gorilla glue it works even in the event of a nuclear detonation not persuasion not teaching not arguing but united in love god is love the love that must define us brother branham spoke often about having what he called perfect love he says without that he can't get there and that's what i want and i know that's what you want and it's available to us how paul says let the peace of god rule in your heart let it it's there he's saying get out of the way and allow it you can't manufacture it but accept it the peace of god that comes from christ to which you were also called in one body to rule in your hearts a parallel to this would be if your immune system attacks your own body crippling you and making you ineffective i have a friend that several years ago a fellow that i used to work with and he got out of bed one morning and fell on the floor he couldn't get up turned out he had a thing they call guillain-barre syndrome it's where your immune system attacks your nervous system and his legs stopped working a lot of him stopped working and he over a period of time gradually recovered a lot of that he still walks with a cane but he's able to get up and walk for months he was using a walker healthy guy in his early 40s but his immune system attacked his nervous system but we're called to be one body one body in christ and and and colossians here this is a group of people paul had never met but he said be thankful be thankful and we need to be thankful and i want to encourage you to please be thankful go ahead and blank that you know there there used to be a plaque as you came into the church from the vestibule hanging between the two main doors of the entry there it was it was an abridged meaning slightly edited grammarized if you will from christ is a mystery of god revealed that brother branham preached in july of 1963 and because this is supposed to be a short exhortation i'm going to close with this quote but it said love one another how important was that above everything above your doctrinal understanding against everything else is above everything he said love one another no matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning see satan won't let you stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make his target he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in set him down cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it don't you take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with anything else you stay right loving and sweet and kind to one another pray for that man that he'll be safe too or that woman whoever it is pray for them and stick with one another and stay with your pastor i i just reminded when we heard that song in april of 1974 or march whenever easter was in 74. heather and i through a strange set of circumstances wound up being invited into brother neville's home and brother neville spent about an hour an hour and a half visiting with us and sharing with us and and he was a pastor and so he was ministering to us uh it was it was just a wonderful time and that's the context of that of course that for us now is brother aaron he's taken on that role and that responsibility for five of the last six years regardless of votes trials so forth i know i've gone to meddling but i'm not going to apologize for he says stick with your pastor see he's the shepherd you give him respects he'll lead you through because he's ordained of god to do so now you remember that the enemy will come and when he does just cling that much closer together and the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you that's all don't never clan among one another or talk or make yourself clannish we're one i i couldn't say left hand i'm mad at you i'm going to take you away because you're not a right hand he's my left hand i want him to stay there even the little tip of my finger i want it to stay right there every little part of my body stay right there god wants us as a body of believers to stay right exactly with one another write it with one another now you've got tapes on that you've got tapes on what we believe we've got tapes on discipline in the church how we be saved behave ourselves when the church of god how we come here set together set in heavenly places he says don't stay home if god is in your heart it's what we just read you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers if you don't feel that way then i tell you it's time you got to praying because we're in the last days where the bible exhorted us to much more as we see that day approaching that's what we just read from the first church age to love one another with christian love and divine love brother branham called it perfect love to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places in christ jesus and love one another this will all men know you're my disciples when you have love one for the other that's right stay right together if the brother you think he's a little wrong or sister or say lord don't let me ever have the root of bitterness spring up because it'll affect him and it'll take the christ right out of my life that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred that'll just take the holy spirit right away from you it'll run him from the tabernacle here it it'll kill the spirit of god or drive it away from here hurts your pastor it'll do everything see don't you do that you just wax that much closer together take the buckle as a brother testified a minister here the other night about having a buckle seeing it in a vision that buckles on the whole armor of god just put it on tighten up move right up close to one another love one another anyhow talk nice about one another say nice things about one another and then god will bless you we're going to bring the message now by god's grace brother branham goes into a word of prayer and i'll just read that prayer lord jesus speaking to this body of the church that they should hold together with god's unchanging hand their absolute the word warning them as paul warned his flock that there would be wolves that are in you're the same god today as you were then and that enemy is the same may this fellowship and bonds of love always exist amongst these people in christ jesus keep us together father let the holy spirit guide us and direct us give us long life of service for you give us this great message this morning we're expecting out of thy word it might go to each heart make the lips that speak lord speak truth may the heart that hears be fertile to receive truth and may it grow into great trees of eternal life to be shining lights and red epistles of all men they might know that jesus christ is raised from the dead and lives among us and he ends so make us so full of love and the fruit of the spirit until other men and women boys and girls can see the results of the life of christ still living in us after two thousand years from the great event granted father to honor thee we ask in jesus christ's name amen you can't argue with that because that wasn't just from any man or person that was god's servant speaking to us how we ought to love one another how we ought to treat one another now let me just say this say it this way it begins in each individual home how you treat one another how you respect one another how you love one another and then you bring that it's part of the body just because you walk in the the church door doesn't make you a perfect christian it's something that you live and you do every day amen let's stand you appreciate the word of the lord you appreciate god's mercy i enjoyed the worship i enjoyed the songs enjoyed this day today what god had for us amen lord we thank you as yesterday and even friday is preparing for this weekend and i said lord what what should we do you've placed something in my heart and i'll be able to minister that but what should we do i just thought just came on why don't we just have a time of worship and praise and singing and then a little bit of an exhortation lord that would speak to our hearts and you've provided that you put it in the hearts of those to sing to testify to be here today and i know there were those listening in who would want to be here but couldn't be here lord but we thank you for it lord now help us lord to be doers of the word and not just hearers only tomorrow will be tested maybe even tonight will be tried but let us come forth as goal lord in everything lord we love you and we praise you in jesus christ's name sister lily was playing this song at the end of service yesterday or this morning sorry
