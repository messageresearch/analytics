TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] And father I see that you were drawn a line in the sand. I want to be standing by your side holding your hand. So let your kingom come. Let it live in me. This is my prayer. This is my Let's sing that one more time. And father I see that you are drawn lying in sin. I want to be standing by your side holding your hand. So let your kingom come. They live in me. This is my pray. This is my peace. Let the worippers arise. Let the sons and the daughters sing. I'm surrendering my own. I surrender to the king. And father I hear growing louder the song of your redeeming as the saints of every nation are awakening to sing from our heart that comes to an end. Oh hear the heavens ring. This is our song a song to our king. Let the worippers arise. Let the sons and the daughters sing. I'm surrendering my own. I surrender to the king one more time. Let the worippers arise.

You can go ahead and be dismissed. But the older kids, we do not have a Sunday school this morning. So, just the younger kids. Awesome. Let's stand up this morning. [Music] I've had many tears and sorrows. I've had questions for tomorrow. There's been times I didn't know right from wrong. [Music] But in every situation and God gave me blessed consolation that my trials will only make me strong. And through it all and through it all I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. And through it all, And through it all, I've learned to depend upon his word. And I've been to a lot of places and I've seen a lot of faces. There's been times I felt so all alone. [Music] But in those lonely hours, yes, those precious lonely hours. And Jesus let me know I was his own. That's why we sing. And through it all, and through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. And through it all, through it all, I've learned to depend upon his word. So I thank him for the mountains and I thank him for the valleys and I thank him for the storms he's brought me through. [Music] For if I never had a problem, I wouldn't know that he could solve it. And I never know what faith God can do. And through it all. Through it all, I learn to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. Through it all. Through it all. I've learned to depend upon this word. Amen. Isn't it so amazing that we can depend on God's word this morning? You may be seated. Take my hand. and lift them up. For I have not the strength to praise you near enough. For I am nothing. Oh, I am nothing without you. Let's sing that one more time. Take these hands and lift them up.

For all my life, you have been faithful. And all my life, you have been so so good. With every breath that I am made, oh I will sing of the goodness of God. It's such a privilege to be gathered together in the name of the Lord Jesus. We had the verse up there earlier. If two or three are gathered in my name, I'm in the midst. He's in our midst. And it's such a privilege that we can be gathered together with one another and gathered together for the purpose of worship in this song that we've just been singing about. All my life he has been faithful. All my life he has been so so good. I I'm still a young guy. I'm only 75, but I can testify to that to be true. I want to read you a little testimony or a portion of a testimony from a from a sister in Israel. Um, last September, we put in a a a prayer request for for prayer for our sister. Um, she uh she had just severe pain. She was brought to the hospital by some of her adult children and uh they uh she woke up two days later with metal rods in her back. She was at stage four breast cancer. Had metastasized. It was everywhere. Her ribs were greatly weakened. And as I say, her back was broken. They had to put metal rods in her back and and the situation looked grim. And that's putting a positive spin on it. Well, I just want to read a little a little portion of a testimony from my heart, mind, and soul are truly running over with blessings. So, hang on while I share with you. last September without warning. Uh my children hauled me to the ER for a CT scan on my back. The pain was awful and the reason was stage four breast cancer had eaten away a few chest bones. My back was broken. Okay. So she goes on talks about some of the places that she went the days and months passed away. She was reminded daily how blessed I am. And now the big news. She says, "In all this time, I have at no time asked for healing, believing his ways are always perfect and his plans are without a doubt perfect, too." Well, this last week, for my 84th birthday, all my life, he has been faithful. For my 84th birthday, I had another PET scan to see what's going on inside. Healed is what happened. Cancer's gone. [Music] That's that's from our sister Patty Ericson. Some of you may know her. Um I have a couple of requests here and some more praises. And let's just put the request in amongst all the praises we have this morning. Uh Sister Holly says, "I have an unspoken prayer request. May God's will be done. God bless you." I've also been told that our brother Alex is is home sick. [Music] Brother Daniel asks prayer for his greatg grandmother. She's been feeling very weak this morning. A very faithful sister in the Lord over so many decades. Oh, and here's another praise from brother Tony Ibara. I would like to praise the Lord because the hospital ran several tests and MRI on my daughter Tony Lisa and they couldn't find anything new. Thank you for your prayers. God bless you. We We serve a God who's alive. When when he was when Jesus was challenged about things, he says, "You Sadducees, you got this wrong. God identifies himself as a God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And he's a God of the living, not the God of the dead." Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had had been around a couple thousand years before that. So, so we have great hope, we have great promise, and we have one another. We need to draw strength from each other. We need to draw strength from him. We need to bring these requests to the Lord. Whatever you may have on your heart that you would like the Lord to do, not so much for yourself, but for someone else who's on your heart. Because if we reach out to others, others will be reaching out to us. And the circle comes together. Jesus said the great sin of those was not Lord I've done all these wonderful works in your name. It's I never knew you. I never knew you. You have to have that relationship with Jesus Christ in your heart. Each of us individually. We can't make it on our great grandma. We can't make it on our parents. We can't make it on our children. We have to make it each one with that relationship with Jesus Christ. Let's go to prayer this morning together. Lord Jesus, we are just in awe of you. We are so grateful for your miraculous touches in so many lives, Lord, and the miracle that you've brought us out of darkness into your marvelous light. Lord, we just pray this morning, Lord, for the needs that are on each heart, Lord. The desires wanting to see others come in, Lord, that you just help us, Lord, to be those lights in the dark places, to be those witnesses for you, Lord. Lord Jesus, I I pray for the offering this morning, Lord, that it'd be used in a way that's pleasing and to you. Be with our pastor, brother Daniel, as he's in Canada ministering to others. And Lord, this morning as our brother Ryan has come down from Flagstaff to minister to us, Lord, our pastor felt led to call him and he felt led to respond. And Lord, we're looking forward to hear the words that you've placed in our heart, Lord, to encourage us and strengthen us, admonish us, help us, Lord, along the way. We thank you, Lord. We're so grateful, Lord. We just want to say that we love you. And again, we want to say, Lord, we love you. And we want to say thank you, Lord Jesus. Amen. Amen.

Cuz I know there is peace within your presence. Jesus. I just want to speak the name of Jesus. Till every dark addiction starts to grow. Caring there is hope and there is free. I see Jesus. Your name is power. Your name is Your name is light. Break every stronghold. Shine through shadows. I just want to speak the name of Jesus over fear and all anxiety. To every soul held captive by depression. Christ Jesus, your name is power. Your name is your name is life. Break every stronghold. Shine through the shadows. We're like a fire. Shout Jesus this morning. Shout Jesus from the mountains and Jesus in the streets and Jesus in the darkness over every enmy. And Jesus for my family. I speak the holy name Jesus. Shout Jesus from the mountains and Jesus in the streets and Jesus in the darkness over every enemy. Jesus for my family. I speak the holy name. Jesus. Shout Jesus. Shout Jesus from the mountains.

Your name is life. Break every stronghold. Shine through the shadows. Burn like a fire. Let's just bow our heads as they play that softly. Lord Jesus, we just want to approach you this morning, Lord. And we know this is what you are, Lord. We know that your your name is the most mighty thing Lord that was ever spoken on this earth. Father that just the mention of your name brought life to a baby in a womb that was dead. Lord just the name of Jesus is enough with when spoken Lord with conviction and faith is enough to send any devil running from our presence this morning from our lives from anything that we have going on. Lord your name is so mighty father because of what it represents. It represents a crucifixion, but it represents a resurrection in power, Lord. And there's something that, Lord, that just no spirit can stand in the presence of that name, Lord. When we cry out your name, Lord, it sends the devils running. They know what's coming, Lord. Lord, I pray you just give us that faith, Lord, and give us that conviction, Lord, to just call out to you, Lord. Not just when things are bad, but when they're going well, Lord. When we when we don't know what to do, we call out to you. When see things seem so sure, we call out to you. when we when we seem to understand, we still call out to you, Lord. And when we feel lost, when we feel hopeless, Lord, we call out to you. May you just, Lord, make it a revelation to us this morning, Lord, of what your name really is, Lord, or what your name really means and what your name has power to do, Father. It's not just words, Lord. It represents the most powerful and high thing ever to live. But you made yourself humble, Lord. And you came and you made yourself one of us, Lord, and died for us, Father. And we could just spend, Lord, all eternity just telling you thank you, Lord. We just want to approach you now, Lord, and just set aside a time, Lord, to hear from you this morning, Lord. May every heart, Lord, mind just be steilled for a few moments, Lord. If we could just hear of your word, Lord. I believe we've worshiped you, Lord. I believe we've made you welcome, Lord. But we also want, Lord, to hear from you this morning, Lord. It would just mean everything to us if you could just take words, Lord, from your Bible, Lord, and just break bread, Lord, with us this morning, Lord, and give us something that we could go out tomorrow, Lord, and fight a battle, Lord, for your for your kingdom, Father, and just strengthen us this morning and speak to us. Honor the faith of those that have come this morning to hear from you, Lord. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. Appreciated that song service, brother Daniel, and the musicians and the special. It's real good to be with you this morning. And um Brother Dan asked me to just greet you this morning and and um tell you that things were going well where he was at. Um he I think he's preaching four or five services over these last few days. So, I know he's going to be tired. I know he's going to need our prayer for this coming week just for recovery, for strength, for for a little bit of energy. Amen. It's hard enough for one service. I can't imagine five in a row and just and just going through a teaching of the people. But he said, uh, greet the congregation. They're going better than expected, the meetings. And I pray that just many souls will give their lives to Jesus. Amen. They have a service going on today and tonight. And just remember the pastor in prayer if you would. I I know that you do, but it's good to good to get a report of how the battle's going. Amen. And I just want to always thank uh brother Dan for the invitation and thank you for your for your welcoming um spirit. It's always comforting when people are expecting to hear from the Lord because then it just makes makes the job as the preacher pretty easy. Brother Aaron, you just kind of get out of the way and the Lord is going to speak directly to those who expect him to speak to them. Amen. Let's just take a scripture while you're standing and um Ephesians chapter 6. Had a few things on my heart this week and wasn't real sure which direction to go and then just started um listening to a few messages this week and just really started studying the last two nights and and uh last night just really I think the Lord put something on my heart. I just want to talk about a subject. I think most of us are familiar with this scripture. Maybe have heard it many times even in Sunday school. And I um just want to approach this uh you know uh not to tell you anything new but to tell you what's already in the word and just bring a reminder to us of what the Lord has for us. Amen. And what he's done for you. I mean in Ephesians 6 um and let's just read verse uh 10. Start with verse 10. It says, "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord." and then the power of his might. Amen. I'm glad it's not my might that I'm going to be fine strengthened. It would fail pretty quickly. Verse 11, put on the whole armor of God, that you may able to stand against the ws of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that you may a may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all to stand, stand therefore, having your loins gird about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness, and your feet shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace, above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith you should be able to quench all of the fiery darts of the wicked, and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God. And 18 is the last verse. Praying always with all prayer and supplication to the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints. You may be seated. And I want to make sure I get a timer this morning. Even if I ignore it, I could just still have it here to say that I put one on. No, we do want to be respectful of the time. I I want to just apologize in advance if you would uh let me when I started to look into these subjects like all subjects in the Bible. I realize that you could spend probably a month on each one of these items and here I am uh an insufficient speaker going to try to cover them all in 45 minutes to an hour. And we know that's just not possible. But the word of God is eternal. So what I really just pray for is uh your patience. And I pray for that the Lord would take exactly what is needed to be heard. Extract out even if it's one sentence and it may be just what you need for today and for tomorrow that he would just extract that out and give it to you even though there's hours and hours of of things that could be spoken on. Um I I just want to make way for the Lord to just give us what he wants in just a few minutes. Amen. I believe that he'll just give you exactly what you have need for. &gt;&gt; Um it doesn't matter how long or how short we give them. You know, one word from him is enough to go and defeat the devil with. So even if we get five or six or 10 words out. Amen. So I just want to say sorry uh it's not sufficient to cover these things in 45 minutes to an hour. Uh but we know we're limited on time. We know we're limited as human beings how much we can take in and how much our our minds can handle. Um and so I just want to say that in advance. Uh I I would I would encourage you to go and study these things for ourselves. You know, I don't believe that it's up to just brother Dan and the minister on Sunday and Wednesday to give us all of our food. I don't know about you, but I don't eat once a week. &gt;&gt; Anybody eat one time a week? &gt;&gt; All right, good. There was no hands on that. Nobody eats once a week. Nobody even eats twice a week. If we're just coming and getting our spiritual food from church, &gt;&gt; uh you're not going to last very long. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like in the natural, you're not going to last very long if this is the only place that you're getting food from. We ought to be going home. We ought to be digging into our word. I'm sure that you are doing that. If you're not, it's time to start getting a little bit of nourishment and food when we get home. And then when we come to church, when they start serving up food here, oh, it makes sense exactly what it is. Oh, I know what he's talking about. I read that this week. I heard that a week ago. Amen. So, I just want to give you just a little appetizer this morning. And I just want to go over these the whole armor of God. If I could just uh tell you about what I want to talk to you about is dressed for battle. I want us to be dressed for battle. You know, the Lord wants you to be dressed for battle this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And just in this scripture, it says, you know, first thing you want to notice is that we're fighting a battle. And I think I might have told you maybe a couple weeks ago when I was here and I I just said, "Look, if you're if you're you're fighting you're fighting some kind of battle, if you're not fighting a battle, there's something wrong." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so if you have decided to follow Jesus, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; you are in a battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have to go searching for a battle. You don't have to go looking for it. You don't have to go looking for a fight. The moment that you say, "Lord, I give my heart to you. I want to be one of your children." And the battle has now started. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you're in a battle, I I love this. If you're in a battle, the Lord says, "Now, I'm going to equip you for that battle. I'm going to give you exactly what it takes to fight the battle that I know is coming." And you know, he has a secret. And and we'll just say the secret right up front. It's not really a secret. He'll tell you, you know, I've already already conquered this enemy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've already beat this enemy for you. But what I'm going to give you is a equipment and an armor so that you can withstand until you get a revelation that I've already defeated this enemy. &gt;&gt; And that when you go into battle, you know, battle usually, you know, sometimes we have a battle Sunday mornings, right? Sometimes we have a little bit of battle Sunday morning, maybe getting up and coming to church or having the right mindset. Sometimes we get in a little bit of argument in the car. Nobody has to say amen about that one. a little bit of argument in the car on the way to church, you know, and we have little battles here and there, but the real battle begins tomorrow morning. &gt;&gt; You know, when you have to go outside of the church and you have to go back to work and you have to go back and be with people who don't believe like you believe, maybe you have to rub elbows with with somebody in the world. Nothing against the person. It's just we have jobs. We have things that we have to do. We have to go to the grocery store. We have to do all these things. So, you're going to you're going to come in contact with uh not the enemy as the people, but you're going to come in contact with enemy as in spirits. &gt;&gt; And that's when the battle begins. And that's what you are uh Lord willing through the word, that's what you're being equipped to deal with. &gt;&gt; And we're fighting a spiritual battle. If we're fighting, he says right here, we're not fighting a battle against flesh and blood. You know, maybe that person who comes up to you and just uh says something bad about you, some something bad about your family or about your church, about the thing that you believe in or that that's nonsense. There's nothing to a Christian life. Well, I'll just live any way I want. You can just love whoever you want. You know what? That flesh and blood person is not your enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a lot of times it's easy to associate them as an enemy and say, "Well, I just don't like that person and they're evil." No, it's a spirit that we battle against. And unfortunately, maybe that that person has lost that battle against the spirit. &gt;&gt; But if you see it and you recognize that you haven't lost the battle against the spirit and that's who we fight against. And if we're fighting a spiritual battle, then we need spiritual equipment to fight that battle. Amen. &gt;&gt; When we talk about the armor of God, I don't think anybody except maybe the real real little kids, you know, I remember being in Sunday school and I heard about the armor of God. I thought we were going to get actual armor. I was a bit disappointed when I didn't get my actual sword. When I became an adult and became in church, I thought I'd be getting some a shield. It just didn't happen that way. It's spiritual equipment that he gives us. Amen. And and make no mistake, when you accept the Christian life, you're in a battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many feel like they're in a battle? &gt;&gt; It's a good thing to feel like you're in a battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you don't feel like you're in a battle, it's it's uh we might want to go back and check if we really have made that commitment to walk this Christian way. It's a war. It's a fight. It's a battle. But at the same time, it's a victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know that. &gt;&gt; I know sometimes you're in the middle of the battle, it doesn't feel like that cuz sometimes you hear that, you're like, "Brother, I'd really like that victory right now &gt;&gt; cuz I am going through it." But every battle that you fight with the Lord has already been won. So really what you're fighting is you're just fighting into the process of a victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know that's hard to grasp sometimes because it doesn't feel like a victory, but you are fighting something that's already been won. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a victory. It's already been overcome. We just need to accept it. It's already the enemy has already been conquered. We just need to and in a way this is a paradox but in a way fighting will bring you fighting in a battle will bring you the thing that no other thing can bring you and that's peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You think I don't want to fight any battles. I want peace. That's you won't ever have peace unless you prepare for a battle. It seems like a paradox. What do you mean? You I'm going to go fight a battle. I'm going to find peace in that. No, it's it's it's Listen now. Peace is not absent conflict. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Peace is confidence in the Lord while you're in the middle of a battle. &gt;&gt; Knowing that I do not care. You know, we need to get to the point that we do not care the outcome of the battle. The Lord has it and he directs it and the outcome is what he wants. Even if that cost me my life, even if it cost me my family, it cost me my job, it cost me my loved ones, it cost me my friends, no matter what the outcome is, the Lord has control over it. Or I have control over it. And I don't want control over it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't need to. If you if you lose your life, you'll find it. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; But if you try to save your life, you'll lose it. &gt;&gt; Exactly. And really that I think sometimes we get we get worried and we get anxious and we get anxiety because we are having control of the battle &gt;&gt; because the outcome matters too much to us. You know what? I really want to go through this but what if it cost me my life? Oh, I don't know about that one. But if you your life if your actual life is lost in the service of the king, you have not lost a thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have gained eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I know that's easier said than done none, right? When you have a loved one in the hospital, when you're in the hospital, but the battle is the Lord's. &gt;&gt; The battle is not mine. I just want to submit myself to his way. And the outcome I can live with or I can die with. I can do whatever he wants because he's in control. And I really feel like when that when we get now, that's words that sounds good, right? But that has to drop down from here down into here with revelation &gt;&gt; because we can say that, right? We could say that and then the battle gets real hard. &gt;&gt; But when it drops down and you realize, oh, even if I lose my life, I win. &gt;&gt; Oh, the battle just gets easy. What do you mean? Even if I lose the life of my children, I win. &gt;&gt; What worry do you have? What struggle do you have if no matter what you do, you win? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If no matter what happens to you at the end, you win. &gt;&gt; It should take the worry and the fear right away from it. &gt;&gt; And I just want to uh just just to just to cover one thing real quick. You just so you know, this covers all ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It covers all ages. You know, uh, God was just, he was not against using what we believe to be maybe 16, 17 year old boy to go to go slay a giant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm too young. No, you're not too young. &gt;&gt; I've seen the world take I've seen the world take eight year olds and nineyear-olds and 10 year olds and six years olds. You're not too young to put on the armor and fight for God &gt;&gt; because God's doing the fighting. &gt;&gt; And guess what? You're not too old. Hear me now. you're not too old to put on the armor and and and renew it a little bit and get in the fight. There's a scripture I I just wrote it down real quick. It reminded me in Joshua 14, he approaches Caleb. And Caleb has been retired retired from fighting for quite a while, living in his home. He's comfortable. And and Joshua approaches said, "Hey, we have more enemies to face." And Josh and Caleb says, "I'm 85 years old." And he gets up from his where he's sitting. And he goes, "I'm ready to go take that mountain at 85 years old." In fact, he says this. He says, "I'm 85 years old." He goes, "I was 40 when Moses called me, and I've lived 45 years fighting for the Lord." And he goes, "And I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me &gt;&gt; at 85 years old. &gt;&gt; My strength, as my strength was then, even so is my strength now. for war both. Now listen, watch the revelation that Caleb has. He says for war, both to go out and to come in. So his his strength was not just to go, brother Aaron, to go and fight a war. He knew that there was a coming back in which means he knew there was a victory already for him. &gt;&gt; It's not just a a faith to go out, well, I'll just go needlessly and fight this war. That no, no, no, no, no. When a revelation has dropped down like it has with Caleb, he says, "I have strength both to go out and fight and guess what? I'm coming back. &gt;&gt; I win. I win." &gt;&gt; That's the attitude that we have to have in this day. As the scripture said, in the evil day, we have to stand &gt;&gt; not just to go and needlessly fight and throw your life against the world like like like just draws against the wind. No, no. You have to have a revelation that listen, I have strength to go out because he's my strength and I'm coming back in. &gt;&gt; Watch Caleb at 85 years old says, "I'm going to go fight this battle and guess what? I'm coming back home." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; At 85 years old, &gt;&gt; glory to God. &gt;&gt; And he was facing He was facing real swords and real shields and real spears. But we face that enemy today. It's not flesh and blood, but it's spirits. Amen. And it says, "Having done all to stand." I always just love this part of the scripture how it puts a it puts a space between these verses. It says, "Having done all to stand." Stand. And I think sometimes many times I have I don't know about you. I can't speak for you, but I I see it. I just think it's a common thing. I think many times I've I've I've stood without doing everything that I can to stand. &gt;&gt; Correct? And then when I fail and when I stumble and when I fall down, I think, well, Lord, I I I did what you said. I stood and here I did. I I took a blow. I I I I I went and messed up. I did something that I didn't want to do. I thought I was supposed to be standing. And I wonder if I I didn't do all that I See, he gives you a recipe. He gives you a path. He gives you an exact instructions to follow. He says, "Now, you're going to do all you can do to stand before you stand. And all that you can do before you stand is to put on the armor of God so that when you stand up, you can withstand the enemy. &gt;&gt; I think a lot of times I get on one or two pieces of the armor that I'm real comfortable with, right? The ones that I do real good with, maybe not on the faith side, but maybe on this other side I don't do so well. And I'm like, well, I got I got one piece of armor. I'm going to go stand. And then I fall. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe I'm just speaking to me this morning, but that's just that there there there's in specific instructions. Let's just look at these pieces of armor. This is so basic in beginning. So you just excuse me. This is a little Sunday school lesson. I remember learning this as a kid, but I I just like to learn it again if you don't mind. The belt of truth. You know, there's an order even to how the armor is put on in the Bible. &gt;&gt; You think, oh, it's just random. He just listed all the armor pieces because you know, as a you know, as an enthusiastic little kid and maybe sometimes as enthusiastic Christians, Brother Daniel, you know what we want to run to if a set of armor Oh, he said it. He said it. You see a set of armor over there and the Lord says, "Go put it on." What are you going to run to? Oh, the sword. Man, I like that sword, right? And then we take the sword and what do we do? If we didn't have the rest of the armor, this is the sword, by the way. We take the the sword and we start cutting into things we don't even know what we're doing. &gt;&gt; We start cut. Oh, I'm just going to be cutting the devil and then I hit Daniel, brother Daniel, over here accidentally with the sword, right? Because I don't know how to yield it. The sword is the last thing that you pick up in this scripture. &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? &gt;&gt; It's the very last thing that you pick up. &gt;&gt; The rest of the stuff he gives you is for defense. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful that the Lord doesn't give you an offensive weapon at the beginning? He gives you defense. Here's how you protect yourself because you're about to get attacked. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; You are about to get attacked if you're not been attacked already. the belt. It It seems like such a well, it's a belt. I I started to read to the belt and I was like, I don't even know if I would make it past the belt. It It was so much in just the belt of truth because I It's not It's Yes, it's talking about spiritual equipment, but we He's using words and he's using items that we recognize so we would know what they do. It's a belt. It holds everything together. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It holds everything together. You could put on a set of clothes and and if you don't have a belt, you might lose your pants. Your shirt might come untucked. You're going to be in trouble. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I know maybe sometimes that's funny, but in battle, when you're in battle, you need something that just holds so close to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That it becomes really becomes part of you. And there's a funny thing about the truth. You know, the truth is um it's a little bit of a funny thing. &gt;&gt; You excuse me. I'm I'm trying to go as fast as I can. I got I already used quite a few minutes here. The truth is what it is regardless of you agree with it and you believe it and you understand it and you acknowledge it ra the world may not acknowledge what the truth is. It's just the truth. It is what it is. It can't change. It is the truth. Okay. So it is what it is whether I understand it or not. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Well, once I understand it, I'll know why it's No, it just is the truth. It just is what it is. It's very hard for our words to describe it, especially my words, but it just is what it is. It's it's the foundation and it holds everything together. In John 17, he says, I love this. You want to be encouraged? Do you want to be encouraged? &gt;&gt; Go home and read John 17, the chapter. You know what that is? That is Jesus, the son of God, praying for you. Wouldn't you love him to stand right up here or maybe come down in a in a prayer line and lay his hands on you and pray for you? If you go read John 17, it's Jesus Christ himself praying for you. &gt;&gt; Here's what he says in part of the prayer. He says, uh, sanctify them through thy truth. Thy word is thy truth. Thy word is thy truth. You'll find all the stuff starts to connect together. But there's a scripture right before then that I just kind of I just accidentally read and I just loved it. He says, "I pray." He's praying to the Lord about you. &gt;&gt; He says, "I pray, Lord, that you should not take them out of the world." &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; What a prayer. Wait a minute. I thought that he would pray, Lord, save them from the world. Lord, deliver them from the world. That's not what he prays for. He says, "I pray that thou shouldest that that not I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou should keep them from evil." &gt;&gt; Amen. So God's prayer is not to take you out of a battle and set you over here on the side. You just stay over here. No, no, no. Lord, leave them in the battle, &gt;&gt; but protect them from evil in that battle. How is he going to protect you? He's going to give you armor to protect you. &gt;&gt; They are not of this world even as I am not of the world. And then he says, sanctify them through thy truth. The word is the truth. Jesus said, Sunday school scriptures now, I am the way, the &gt;&gt; truth, &gt;&gt; and the life. He didn't say, "I speak the truth." He didn't say, "I talk the truth." He didn't say, "I know the truth. Let me give you some truth." He says, "I am the truth." Which means whether I understand him or not, whether I know everything about him or not, he is the truth. He is what it is. Amen. And you know, and that same thing, what is Satan? Jesus says this in John 8, speaking to the Pharisees, he says, "You Pharisees, you are of your father, the devil, and the lust of your father you will do." He was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He doesn't have the belt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why is that important? We'll see. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own. For he is a liar and the father of it. He's the father of lies. Every time Satan tells you something, and I know he tells you something. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz you're in a battle. &gt;&gt; I You're in a battle. And part of the battle is that he gets to talk to you. He gets to speak to you. You know, he's looking. We don't have time to go into this, but he's actually hunting and searching for the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Which one are you? Are you one? Are you one? So, what does he do? He starts talking to you, seeing how you'll react. If you going to react in a way that's uh that's ungodly, he'll go, "Okay, maybe it's not that one. Let me go over here. I'm going to talk to this one." But if you react with the truth, he goes, "Oh, wait a minute. &gt;&gt; There's something about this one." And then you're targeted. &gt;&gt; Then all the guns start getting trained on you. &gt;&gt; Amen. No matter how it sounds, you know, he's going to come to you and he's going to, you know, a lot of times, uh, a lot of times the devil, this is just basic preaching, so it should be real easy to hear. Sometimes the devil disguises his voice as the Lord's voice, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You ever experienced that? You think it's maybe the Lord telling you, um, I feel I feel bad, Brother Danny. I always pick on you, but you're right there in that front row. you know, he'll come and say, "Um, Daniel, you know what you did yesterday? You know that thing that you did?" And you might be laying in bed. You might be trying to get peace. You might trying to be getting sleep. And he'll say, "You know, you know, you shouldn't have done that." And you think, "Lord, is that you? Lord, are you bringing conviction to my heart?" Sometimes it is the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Listen to it a little bit longer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because see, there's no truth in him. &gt;&gt; So, he can't tell you the truth. If you let him talk long enough, he'll expose himself. &gt;&gt; You call yourself a Christian and then you did that thing. There's you're not a Christian. And you might, Daniel, you might say that's true. I don't feel like a Christian. You're not worthy. You're right. The Lord don't love you. Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's a lie. &gt;&gt; It's a lie. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, right there, there's no truth in him. He cannot tell you the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, if you let him No, I'm not encouraging you to listen to the devil, but start asking him questions. So, wait a minute. Am I a son of God? No, you're not a son of God. Oh, I got you. That's not you, Lord. That's you, Satan. Because there's no truth in you. You only have lies. I may fail him every day. &gt;&gt; I certainly probably fail him every single day. I probably fail him. But if you tell me that he doesn't love me, I know that you're a liar, Satan. I know that you're a liar because he What kind of love? What do you describe it then when he sends his own son to die for me? What do you call that? I call that love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so when he comes and he talks to you, he exposes himself. Just give him a little bit of the word. Just give him a little bit of the truth &gt;&gt; and he can't stand up to this. &gt;&gt; You say, "I don't really know that much." You don't need to know anything. &gt;&gt; You just take him back to this Bible. You want me to give you? Let me just give you a few little truths you can put inside your satchel. Right? &gt;&gt; These are little Sunday school scriptures. John 6:37, if you're writing it down, all that the Father has given me shall come, and he that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out. &gt;&gt; He didn't talk about the condition that person was in. He didn't talk about any of those things. He said, "If they come to me, if they approach me, if they want me, I will not turn them away." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Give that truth to the devil. See what he tells you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Verily, verily, John 6:47, verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me has everlasting life. &gt;&gt; If you got nothing to fall back on, you have a belt of truth to fall back on. It says, you know what? I may not be good. I may not be mistake free. I may not be where I want to be, but God, he he paid the price for me. I believe on him, and I have everlasting life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Boo devil, you have no power here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And this isn't just to build you up. Oh yeah, I'm going to go out and do this. This works because it's in the word. &gt;&gt; It's in the scriptures. It's not because some preacher told you or somebody told you. It's in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; James 5:15. And the prayer of the faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise them up. And if he had committed sins, &gt;&gt; I'll raise my hand. And if he has committed sins, here's the devil. Oh, you committed a sin. No, you must not be. Oh, you must not be this. You must not be that. You must be this. If he has committed sins, they shall be forgiven him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He can't handle that. He's not going to tell you that. &gt;&gt; He's not going to come and tell you, oh, you know, if you just go make that thing right. &gt;&gt; He won't tell you that because there's no truth in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Confess your faults one to another and pray for one another that you may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avaleth much. He can tell you about all the things that you've done wrong, but if you take them back to the truth, &gt;&gt; he can't take that. &gt;&gt; You want another promise? Peter said unto them, &gt;&gt; "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I think sometimes we hear that and go, "Oh man, that sounds so good." Listen who Peter is saying that to. He's not saying that to the saints. &gt;&gt; He's not saying that to the perfect. He's telling the sinner, repent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at the audience that Peter is preaching to. You say, "Oh, man. That's a good promise. Maybe I'll get to that place one day where that promise is for me." It's for you right now. &gt;&gt; I don't care if you sinned this morning, if you sinned last night, if in your mind you're sinning right now. He says, "Repent and be baptized." He's preaching to the hopeless. He's preaching to the lost. He's preaching to the weak. He's preaching to the downtrodden. And he's saying, "This is a promise. This is a truth for you." &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And listen, if you have the Holy Ghost, this truth don't stumble you. You take it. Every time it comes, you go, "Amen. I got that. I got that. &gt;&gt; I got that. Thank you, Lord. I got that. This is where I was at." See, that's the thing is people that don't have the Holy Ghost, sometimes they get a little bit offended when you talk about the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know if that sounds controversial, but that's the truth. Sometimes somebody who doesn't have the Holy Ghost but thinks they do gets offended when you read about how you receive the Holy Ghost. But somebody that has it is never offended by how reading about how you get the Holy Ghost because they go, "Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. That's what you did for me. I got to check my spirit. If what the minister is saying offends me, why am I offended by it? &gt;&gt; Maybe there's something inside that needs to be cut out. Maybe there's something that's offended by the word of God that just needs to get cut down a little bit. &gt;&gt; He wants you to be transformed. He doesn't want you to stay a sinner. He doesn't want you to stay lost. He just wants you to stay hopeless. He gives you a promise when you are those things. And it's a belt. &gt;&gt; He can cinch it down real tight. How what do you got to do? You got to put it on. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's one thing to read these scriptures and go, "Oh, that was real good." No, no. You got to put it on. &gt;&gt; Put it on. I mean, I it Listen, it's the truth. Even if you don't understand it, I don't understand why he would save me. &gt;&gt; I don't even understand how he could save me. It don't matter. I'm going to put the belt on and I'm going to cinch it down as tight as I can until it becomes one with me. &gt;&gt; That's what you do with the belt of truth. It holds everything else together. I I've spent I'm sorry. I've spent uh 20 minutes on the belt. 25 minutes. Uh we're just going to get through these. Amen. The breastplate of righteousness, what does it do? Goes right here. Guard your heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It guards your heart. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's read. Uh if you want to note it down, Proverbs 4:23. It says, "Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, now, now, do you want to protect your heart? Do you want your heart protected? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; A good good portion of people, they want their heart protected. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's going to tell you exactly how you do it. There's one thing to talk about the armor. I want to know how I put it on. &gt;&gt; I want to know how I I just want to know how what it is. How do I put it on? Well, you know what I'm going to do is I'm going to speak the truth even if I don't even understand it. &gt;&gt; And the devil might come to you and say, "What are you even talking about? It's in the word." And then watch him give you a revelation of what that truth means. But I'm going to speak it whether I realize it or not, whether I even understand it or not. I'm going to say the truth. The same thing here. This is how you'd guard your heart. There's two things. The next two verses says, "Put away from thee a forward mouth and perverse lips put far from thee." And then the second thing, "Let thine eyes look right, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee." The two ways your heart gets corrupted is what you look at. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And what you say. Doesn't the Bible say out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, once you know who you are, if you put the belt on, you know who you are. &gt;&gt; Even if you don't even understand how he got you there, &gt;&gt; you know who you are. Lord, I'm a child of God. I I don't know how you did it, but you did it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So once you know who you are, &gt;&gt; you realize that it's not your righteousness that's protecting you. It's his righteousness. &gt;&gt; And if your heart is corrupted, it's because maybe maybe you put on that belt of truth, but then maybe you put on your righteousness as a heart covering, it won't work. &gt;&gt; And you'll you know how you know this? &gt;&gt; Listen to what comes out of your mouth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You want to know if your heart has been corrupted? If your heart has been hurt, if your heart has not been guarded, listen to what comes out of your mouth. Oh, that brother did this to me. Oh, that sister this. Oh, that person, they're no good this. Oh, you know what? And you might even use a scripture to back up what you're saying. But if what comes out of your mouth is not of God, then you can, you know, that something's been hurt inside the heart. And I think there needs to be I know, brother Dan, I think I don't know if he ended up speaking on it, but he started talking about forgiveness. &gt;&gt; He told me that's what he was going to speak on. You know, a lot of times our heart has been hurt, maybe even legitimately, and because we haven't forgiven, our heart's still hurt. And then from out of our mouth comes the hurt. &gt;&gt; And then we put on a breastplate of righteousness over the top of it. And guess what? We keep all that hurt right inside. And for years and years, we sit in a church service with the armor of God on. And out of our mouth comes hurt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That church did this to me. That brother did this to me. That religion did this to me. That sister did this to me. My family did this to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hurt just comes out. &gt;&gt; There's got to be a healing in that heart. Take place. &gt;&gt; Exactly. And and you know sometimes it's the heart is hurt by what you watch. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you got to watch. Listen now. The eyes are the input and the mouth is the output. &gt;&gt; So if you're not careful what's going into the eyes, do you want me to go into detail or you know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be careful what you're spending time watching. &gt;&gt; Exactly. because it corrupts this and pretty soon you'll start speaking out of this exactly what you were taking in. &gt;&gt; I got to say it to me, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's it's not a it's not a it's not a it's not a beating. It's it's the way that the armor of God works. And if we don't if we don't wear it like he says to wear it, it's not going to do any good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're just wait. We're just, you know, at that point, we're just we're just playing dress up, &gt;&gt; right? which is what's going on in a lot of churches is just playing dress up. Oh, I'm here. I'm putting on the armor of the Lord. And then you watch, now listen now. I've watched it happen. I've watched people come in and put on the armor of the Lord. And then when they go walk out the doors, they set it and they put on the side by the door. I'll get it when I come back Wednesday. &gt;&gt; I'll get it when I come back uh two Sundays from now. I'll get it when I come back next Easter. No, you need it &gt;&gt; for when you walk out the door. I know this is so obvious, but I've seen so many people get a victory and then set the victory aside and go out the door and think they're going to be okay. &gt;&gt; The victory should not just be in these four walls. &gt;&gt; The victory needs to be out there where the battle is going on tomorrow morning, Tuesday morning, Thursday night, Friday night. That's where a victory should be happening. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's so obvious, but yes, so many times I've I've Daniel, I've I've been so happy to have the sword and then I just lay it down and the next time I read my Bible is when I come to church the next Wednesday and and I'll just say, "Ouch." &gt;&gt; If somebody was preaching that to me, I would say, "Ouch. All right, Lord, that's me." And I go out and I expect to win a battle. How can I win it? I left my equipment at church. &gt;&gt; I handed my equipment to Brother Dan. Thanks for that equipment. I'll come back and pick it up next service. No, he's trying to equip you to go fight the battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's just move on. Shoes. The preparation of the gospel of peace. I told you before, peace does not mean an absent of conflict. It's confidence in God during the middle of a battle. &gt;&gt; And I I we could just spend a month on shoes and a month on on the breastplate of righteousness. I just got to I got to hurry. I don't want to keep you. I know where time is short. peace. U the gospel we believe in does. It allows you to have a firm a firm ground to stand on. &gt;&gt; It allows you to have a place, a sure hold. One of the best things you can have in a battle is a sure foothold. &gt;&gt; Something you can just set your foot back like this, lock in, and you're ready to fight. It's it's in it's in it's in competitive sports and competitive fighting. It's in everything. You know, I wonder why they run around in bare feet when they're fighting, but it's so they can get a a a sure foothold. But we're not bare feet this morning. We have shoes of the gospel. Amen. And you're not barefoot. You're shaw with the gospel. You can move forward into the battle knowing that you have a perfect word. &gt;&gt; You know that you got a perfect word. And guess what? A perfect one goes before you into the battle. You want to talk about a sure foothold? I can't move forward if I'm confident in myself. &gt;&gt; Exactly. I can I can I could talk about it and it sounds good and I could say amen, but then Monday morning am I going to walk forward? But if I come to a realization that a perfect one goes before me, well, I'm just going to follow in his footsteps &gt;&gt; because I was given the shoes of the gospel of what? Peace. &gt;&gt; Right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't it amazing? He gives you armor and the armor is called peace. &gt;&gt; And you know, I noticed something about the armor. is so obvious, but let's just point it out because it's so obvious. There's nothing that goes on the legs and so you can wear the armor of God and still kneel down. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Nothing keeps you from kneeling down in the armor of God. It frees up your knees. It frees up your legs. So no matter how bad it gets, that armor works right in sync with prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's just a little side note, as as some would say that was for free. Romans 5:1, "Therefore, being justified by faith," how do you know you're justified? Belt, we covered that. If you don't know you're justified, go back to the truth. Search out the truth. Find out, "Oh, I was justified." Cinch that belt down a little bit tighter. It got a little bit loose. Cinch it down a little bit tighter. Therefore, being justified by faith. I'll just say it like this. Therefore, having the belt on, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope. I love this scripture. Romans 5:3, it says, "And not only so, but we glory in tribulations." &gt;&gt; As a child of God, do you want to glory in rest and relaxation, or do you want to glory in battle? And it's such the opposite mentality sometimes that is talked about that that I certainly sometimes want for myself. I just want a little bit of peace. I think there's a saying I I think even brother Brandham referenced this. There's a saying uh I don't remember who said it, the general, but he says if you want if you want peace, prepare for war. &gt;&gt; It's powerful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We glory in tribulations knowing that tribulations workketh patience. A son and daughter of God, when they're fully equipped with the with the armor of God, look for the battle, not run from the battle. &gt;&gt; If you're running from the battle, check the shoes. &gt;&gt; Maybe they're not the gospel of peace. Maybe you put on your own shoes. &gt;&gt; Those shoes run away from the battle. &gt;&gt; Am I saying to go out and get in a fight with every single person that that disagrees with you? That's not what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But there's a spirit that you battle the moment you step out. I mean, we might be battling it right now. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Right now. I don't know about what he's saying. Oh, I don't know about that. Oh, you know, that guy just did that thing to me, though. He doesn't understand what that person did to me. &gt;&gt; But, but the Lord does understand. &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. &gt;&gt; And let me Can I tell you something that should just be so humbling and sobering? The Lord understands because you did it to him. &gt;&gt; I did it to him. &gt;&gt; That wrong that was you were wronged with, you wronged the Lord with that wrong at some point. And you know what he did? &gt;&gt; I don't even see it. &gt;&gt; I don't even see it. You know, if when you make something right that repent and be baptized, the Lord doesn't have to step over that every time you you walk in. You know, Brother Aaron, if I offend you and you and I say I'm sorry and you forgive me, you know, Brother Aaron might have to he might have to step over that thing a little bit every time he sees me, &gt;&gt; right? Because we're human beings. The Lord doesn't have to do that. &gt;&gt; It's gone. He has that ability. I just need to keep moving. You forgive me. I got a few minutes here. Man, I would want to spend so much time in these. I just can't. Shield of faith. Uh just that those shoes though, you know, even David at 16, 17 years old did not stand there when he was fighting Goliath. Little kids in Sunday school know this one. They could probably teach you a thing or two, teach me a thing or two. He ran &gt;&gt; towards Goliath. &gt;&gt; He ran towards him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he didn't have the physical armor of Saul. He had the Lord's armor with him. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if you're relying on yourself, I know what direction you'll run. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know what direction I run when I'm relying on myself. Shield of faith. Faith uh is not just a weapon. It's a defense. It's a defense. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you join the ranks of God's army, you better have a good defense. &gt;&gt; In fact, the Bible says in this scripture, um I don't know exactly how it it said it in Eph. It says um above all, when the Bible says above all, the antenna should go up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. What is it about to tell me? Above all, get that shield of faith. Every every single when you declare, "Lord, I'm going to live for you. &gt;&gt; Lord, I accept what you did for me." &gt;&gt; Every single gun is now trained upon you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every single one. You think that you're not going to take shots, you're going to take shots. &gt;&gt; And you need a shield. And the shield is the shield is able to deflect every single shot that the enemy But but you know what? You have to learn how to wield it. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; You have to learn how to wield it. There might be some times where you're going to take some blows because you just don't know how to wield the shield yet. But keep doing it. Keep doing it. Uh there's something that's just so striking that even though you're in a battle and you're in the greatest battle you'll ever be in, greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. So if I start to get confidence in my ability to wield this, I am I'm lost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To learn how to use a shield is to learn how to surrender your your shield arm over to the Lord and watch him deflect things you didn't even know were coming. And and you know the devil again, he'll come to you. Oh, you you can't have that. You're too weak. Raise that shield up. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, you can't have that Holy Ghost that that minister was talking about. You know what you've done in your life? Raise that shield up. You know what that is? That's a fiery dart. &gt;&gt; And he's got a lot of fiery darts. And and and I love that the Bible says this, you quench the fiery darts of the devil. Just just follow me on this one. This might be a stretch, but I just like this. Okay. You know that on this side over here when you do something and the Holy Spirit is not pleased, you know, it calls it you can quench the spirit. &gt;&gt; When you do something that doesn't please the Lord, doesn't please the spirit. I think maybe we've all been guilty of it. You quench the spirit maybe of a service or maybe some person's testimony, you quench it. But I love that over here on this side, when you do something against the devil, you actually quench him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You can actually quench the devil. You can quench the fiery darts of the devil. You know what that means? Every time that shield of faith deflects one of his attacks on you, he gets a little bit more discouraged to attack you again &gt;&gt; because his spirit gets quenched. I know we never think of the devil that way. We always think he's just like this mighty, strong, relentless attacker. You know, he gets depressed because depression comes from him. You know, he gets anxiety because anxiety comes from him. He gets down in the dumps. He gets in despair because those things come from him. And he even gets discouraged. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When he sees somebody who has no business being able to withstand his attacks, all of a sudden withstanding his attacks, not because they're good with the shield, because they started to surrender that shield arm to the Lord. Don't even know what they're doing sometimes. And he attacks them. I'm going to get them with this one. I This one has worked their whole life. Every time I bring up this little thing that they've done or this problem that they have or this little addiction they have, every time I bring it up, I get a victory over them. And then he brings it up one day and it bounces back and it's quenched. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Oh, wait a minute. Okay. I must I must have thrown that attack a little bit wrong. Let me throw that attack again one more time. You're no good because this boom. And it's quenched again. What is he going to do? He realizes that where he had a foothold in your life, where he had a he had an anchor in your life. Listen to me now. Where he had an anchor in your life, whenever it might be, he doesn't have that anchor anymore. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he gets discouraged. &gt;&gt; When he doesn't have an anchor in your life anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His spirit gets quenched &gt;&gt; by the shield of faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You ever think about that? That you're not just facing this relentless foe. You're facing somebody that when you get a little victory, he walks back home like this. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. and has to go prepare a new attack on you. I'm going to try something else that's going to work because that sure don't work anymore. &gt;&gt; I tried bringing up the alcohol. It just doesn't work anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I tried bringing up the cigarettes. Oh, it doesn't work. It worked for 40 years. It worked, but it doesn't work anymore. &gt;&gt; I better try a new plan of attack. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You think, oh, it's just a little scripture. There's so much in one scripture that says the shield quenches the fiery darts of the devil. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You see a brother in church. How about this? A brother, a sister. This is what's beautiful about the shield. It's not attached to you. So, I see a brother or sister in the church that is fighting a battle and they're getting beat. I see him down on one knee. I see him getting beat by the devil. You know, you can go over with that shield and you can protect somebody else with it, too. &gt;&gt; But, you know what the devil would love to have you do is to point out their faults. &gt;&gt; Exactly. He would love to have you go, "Oh, you see so and so again, they just can't keep away from that thing." Out of the mouth comes what's in the heart. &gt;&gt; If I see somebody down, if I see somebody struggling and I start talking about them, I can tell you this. I don't have the breastplate of righteousness on. &gt;&gt; Oh, I've been going to church for I don't know how many years. I tell you what, you don't have the breastplate of righteousness on because out of your mouth is coming what's in your heart after you see somebody who's struggling. But instead, what we should be doing, it's so basic. It's so basic. This isn't, this isn't complicated, but do we do it? Do I go over and put my shield down in front of him and say, "Look, I'm going to pick you up. Let's pray together. You're on a knee. I'm on a knee. I got you. I got you right now &gt;&gt; because I I rest assured, &gt;&gt; you're going to need somebody to cover you at some point." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Rest assured, you're going to take a blow that might almost kill you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It might almost kill you and you're not going to be able to hold that shield up and someone else is going to come over and say, "I got you. I got you. &gt;&gt; I got you. We're in the same army together. I got you. And that's another thing is that we're not in an army by oursel. That's a depressing thought. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One person out on the field. Although I know the Lord could give him a battle, but he always had even just a few. &gt;&gt; Somebody to watch your back. Somebody that whose back you could watch their side you could protect. He always has a few that he has. Amen. &gt;&gt; You forgive me. I'm I'm I'm I'm I've been 45 minutes. I'm trying to hurry. Raise that shield up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cover him in prayer. See, the armor doesn't prevent you from going to prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's your spouse. Maybe it's your child. Maybe it's your parents. I don't care who it is. Cover them in prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Helmet of salvation. Oh, I just we're just I wish we could take so much time with these. Helmet of salvation. you know who you are and what God has done for you. &gt;&gt; It's called the helmet of salvation. There's even a place in the Bible. I I I'll find the scripture. There's a place in the Bible where Jesus himself says he put on the helmet of salvation. &gt;&gt; Why would Jesus need it? Because he knows who he is. &gt;&gt; See, it's a helmet of salvation. Uh Philippians 2:12 says, "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling." Be very sure. I think I was even talking about this last time. Be very sure that your own you have your own experience with the Lord. &gt;&gt; You can't put that helmet on if you're unsure of your experience of the Lord. If you're unsure, go back to him and said, "Lord, I need to be sure." &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; I need to be sure that it wasn't just an emotion. It wasn't just a sensation. It wasn't just a great service. It wasn't just a prayer line. I need to be sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That I died and that you came to live inside of me. I need to be sure cuz when you're sure that helmet goes on and then it guards your thoughts against fear, against worry, against anxiety. And I told you most people have these things because they don't know who they are. &gt;&gt; That's just the truth. Most people have an anxiety problem or a fear problem because they're not sure of their salvation. And so there's a worry there, even if they don't know what it is. And it leads to worry about all these other things. But if you trace it back, &gt;&gt; if you trace well, you know, I I and and it's hey, don't anxiety is a real thing. It's not imagined. &gt;&gt; But sometimes my wife would give a testimony this sometimes it's it's an anxiety over getting on a plane. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; You think I I'm afraid to travel on a plane. Okay. But trace back, trace the anxiety back and find out if there's not a root problem that needs to be taken care of. &gt;&gt; There's a thought that gets in and all of a sudden because the mind's not guarded, a thought gets in and all of a sudden it leads to fear. It leads to worry. And sometimes you're afraid. Have you ever had this happen? You're afraid and you don't even know what it is you're afraid of, &gt;&gt; but you just feel fear. &gt;&gt; I don't know, might only be a couple of us that have that. I just sometimes you're just afraid. You don't even know what you're afraid about. &gt;&gt; Trace it back and see if there's not a thought there. &gt;&gt; They're not sure of their salvation. If you're sure of who you are and you're sure that your old self was crucified with Christ, then you're sure that you no longer live, but he lives in you. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; I I'm trying to close. Why I just I I just want to keep going, but like why are we why are we even in church? Why do we come to church? It's a question many people ask. Why do we come? This is the headquarters. &gt;&gt; Everybody get that? This is the headquarters of the army of the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is the camp. This is where you come and you replenish the ammunition. This is where you come and you and you know what? Sometimes sometimes it's happened many times to me. Sometimes you got that shield, one of those darts makes it over the top of the shield. It's even it's even in the word. I I read it. Sometimes one of those darts make it over the top of the shield and you get hit and you get wounded. &gt;&gt; Guess what? You come back to the camp. You know what the devil would love? You know what he loves? When you go do something wrong and because you do something wrong, you stay away from church. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; I I I don't even know you. I know that's the truth. &gt;&gt; I know that's the truth. If if there not one person said amen, I know that's the truth. When you do something wrong, he tells you, well, you can't go back there because you did something wrong. What are people going to think about you? What the Lord's going to think about you? What are you going to do this? You're going to walk in. You have all these thoughts. Why? That's fear. That's the devil wanted to keep you away from the camp where the medicine is at, where the doctor is at, where the healing is at, &gt;&gt; where somebody else might be able to come up and put a shield over you, lay their hands on you, and you will recover. He wants to keep you away from that. He'd love for you to stay out in battle and not have a headquarters to come back to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, do I believe that we should all just stay in the headquarters all the time? No. We come to church. We rally together. We come to have a worship. We come to to to give praise to the Lord and prepare to go back out into battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I come here and and and I'm sure you get this from Brother Dan and you learn some new tactics on how to fight the devil, some new strategy, &gt;&gt; some teaching of the word of God. You know, here's another way you can defeat Oh, really? I didn't That's my timer going off. All right. I said it 10 minutes early. I have been 50 minutes. Can you give me five minutes? &gt;&gt; It may be a little bit of grace on that five minutes. Like brother like brother Gerald Hughes used to say, who will give me five minutes? &gt;&gt; 5 10 15 20 25. All right. I don't I'm just I'm just joking. I don't need that much time. But there there's a doctor in the camp. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's a doctor in the camp. &gt;&gt; G to God. &gt;&gt; There's a healer in the camp. &gt;&gt; We come together and we rally together. Sometimes you're out in a battle. Think about this. I just picture I picture soldiers out in the battle and they're fighting and maybe somebody falls off and they and they drop and they're like, who else died? &gt;&gt; Who else got who else was injured? And then you come back to the camp. Oh, Daniel's still here. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother so and so. Oh, they're still alive. Praise the Lord. You know what it does? It starts to encourage you. &gt;&gt; Oh, they're still surviving. Oh, after after the battle they went through. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; After all they went through, they're still here. Oh, praise the Lord. Oh, I can go back out and fight again. I can go if they can fight. If Caleb at 85 years old can fight, oh man, what can he do with me? &gt;&gt; What could he do with me? And it encourages you to see somebody else, you know, there's nothing worse. There is nothing worse than bright, polished, shiny armor. &gt;&gt; I don't want to see I don't want to see anybody with shiny armor unless you're a new recruit. When you first come to the Lord, your armor is going to be polished. It's going to be new. It's going to be shiny. But when I watch somebody come into the church who's got some scars on the breastplate, &gt;&gt; he's got some scars on the sword. &gt;&gt; I want you to be able, listen, I want you to be able to pull out your own sword, Daniel, and go, see this little See this chip in my sword right here? &gt;&gt; That's where I slew this one devil. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Who's got a sword like that? You see this chip in my sword? That's where I took over that old alcohol devil that was after me. That right there. Oh, I took him down. See this other chip? This little slice out of my sword? That's that pornography devil that I took I took him down with the sword. See this other chip over here? That's that that's that nicotine devil that I took down right there. &gt;&gt; How about this other little chip? Oh, the backside. Oh, when was that? Oh, that was maybe that was a long time ago. Oh, that I remember that devil. He was a devil of gossip. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; All devils. And that sword needs to be taken to them. I want listen. I want to follow I want to follow a general who's got scarred armor on. &gt;&gt; Some general walks out and says, "Uh, everybody follow me." And they got polished shiny armor on thinking, "Where are you going? Where you been? &gt;&gt; I think you've been in the camp. &gt;&gt; I think you've been staying in the tent. You haven't been where I've been. That armor better have mud on it. It better have some dirt on it. It better have some blood on it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, what are we doing? Are just dressing in armor to be seen? To parade around? There's so many churches just parade around. Look at what we believe. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, look at what we believe. Shiny armor on. You ain't been in a battle yet. &gt;&gt; You ain't been in a battle. You ain't been in the battle. I've been. I feel like I'm missing an arm sometimes when I'm coming to church, &gt;&gt; honestly. &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you what my general wears. My general wears armor that's got scars in the hands. &gt;&gt; That's who That's who my general That's who my general is. If I look at the back of his armor, it's got stripes on the back of the armor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You think Jesus is walking around just You think he just went to the cross and was bean for no reason and he says, "No, I've been in battles. Look at these stripes. &gt;&gt; They were for you. Look at these nails. They were for you. Look at these beat marks. They were for you. Look at these scars around my forehead from thorns. Those are for you. &gt;&gt; That's a general I want to get behind. &gt;&gt; That's a general that leads you into battle. And you know, I'm telling you, think about it. In the natural, if you were to have to join the army and you got one of those generals in front of you, you're like, "Oh, we're going to win. &gt;&gt; We're going to win. Look at this guy." &gt;&gt; Exactly. Exactly. &gt;&gt; Look at this guy. Look at the faith muscles on this general. &gt;&gt; And he's not some new recruit. Look at the battles. He I'm getting behind that guy right there. &gt;&gt; And that's Jesus Christ going before us. Then why do I have fear? Why do I have worry when that general goes before me &gt;&gt; and has already surveyed the field, actually already marched out there before the foundation of the world and defeated the enemy. &gt;&gt; He just came back to get you. &gt;&gt; Amen. He just came back to get you to take him take you with him. Why put on the armor if we're not going to fight? &gt;&gt; If if so, all this preaching, all this talking, all the church going is just a waste of time. Why put on the armor if we're not going to go fight? &gt;&gt; And why go fight if I haven't put the armor on? &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Why stand when I haven't done all there is to stand? O, I got a whole another page. Nope. I better stay away from that. Is your armor a little bit loose? You find sometimes you're a little bit loose, a little bit lacking. Sometimes slacking in your prayer life, slacking in your &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I found myself slacking in my prayer life, slacking in my Bible time. You know what you need to do? Grab that belt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cinch it down. Because sometimes in battle, I'm talking to I'm talking to veterans now. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Sometimes in battle, the belt gets a little bit loose. &gt;&gt; It gets a little bit loose. It's nothing to be ashamed about. It means you were out battling. &gt;&gt; Grab that belt. Cinch it down. Oh Lord, you know what? You're right. Lord, I haven't made time. But in your promise says if I repent, this is what I'm going to get. So Lord, you won't you won't turn me away. I'm just going to cinch that down a little bit. Maybe maybe the maybe the uniform's getting a little bit loose. Maybe the faith muscles haven't worked out. Can I tell you something that you probably already know? faith. Do not store up faith for a big battle. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm telling you? Don't store up faith for this big battle. Use faith every single day for every single thing because faith is a muscle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You think about how crazy I know I've gone over my time. Will you forgive me? I'm not doing this because brother Dan's not here. I think he would give me an extra five minutes. Maybe not. But if this is the last time I talked to you, give me an extra 5 minutes. All right? And then you won't have to hear another 50. But sometimes we're think about how silly it would be for some bodybuilding competition or weightlifting competition and the weightlifter says, "I'm not going to lift any weights for a couple months. I'm going to save it all up for the competition. He's going to go out to the thing and not be able to lift any weights." You need to exercise your faith. And I'll tell you, if you want to know if you have the armor of God, start having faith for every single little thing that happens in your life. every day. Not just the big battles. No, no, no, no. The small battles, too. Oh, well, you know, uh my my son son came to me and says, "Oh, they're giving him a difficult time at work." Praise the Lord, son. Let's just sit down and have a prayer about that. &gt;&gt; Well, it's just a little job. I mean, it's not that big a deal. No, no, no. Let's start working out the faith muscle &gt;&gt; because then when the big challenge comes around, you'll swing that sword and you're like, I didn't even know I was that powerful. &gt;&gt; I didn't even know that I could I could cleave off the head of a devil like that. Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's that little daily exercise of the faith, that little oh that little five minutes in your scripture that 5 minutes becomes 10 minutes. That 10 minutes becomes 20 minutes. That 20 minutes becomes an hour and then an hour is not even enough. &gt;&gt; Start exercising. Oh, you know what I'm going to start with? Here's what we do. Here's what we do. I'm going to start I've got I've done no praying for a year. I'm going to start off with an hour a day. &gt;&gt; Anybody? And how many days did it last? &gt;&gt; Uh, one, two. Right. The second day it was like, I'm running running late for work. I 45 minutes is still pretty good. Start with five minutes. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; And watch five minutes not be enough. &gt;&gt; A little workout. Don't go and pick up 500 lb if you haven't lifted weights, but go pick up a weight. &gt;&gt; Watch that uniform. &gt;&gt; Watch the armor of the Lord start to fill out. I I You know what? I I just got to stop. I've said it. I just want to know what does your armor look like? Have you got it on? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't doubt whether you have it on or not. If you don't, it's right here. &gt;&gt; Everything you need for that armor is right here. Go study it. What? Lord, what is it? What is it to tell the truth? &gt;&gt; Lord, what is it to guard my heart? Lord, what is it to guard my mind? Lord, what is it to stand when everything else says to run? &gt;&gt; Go read in this Bible. This will give you the answer. Put on that armor. And then what does your armor look like? Is it shiny? Is it clean? Or is it scarred? &gt;&gt; But every scar is a victory. &gt;&gt; Every scar is a testimony. You can come and go, "Oh, right here. say, "See this big chunk out of my armor? That's when you tried to kill me and you couldn't do it. &gt;&gt; You couldn't take my life." And right here is a testimony of how the Lord defeated you right here on my armor. I wear it. I wear my testimony. &gt;&gt; And if you come at me, I got the sword. &gt;&gt; How many wants to be that kind of soldier? &gt;&gt; I want to be that kind of s I just don't want to say it. I'm so tired of just me just saying I want to do something. I want to be that soldier. And you know what? How many in here truly from your heart? How many in here want to serve the Lord? &gt;&gt; I love it. Then guess what? You got a battle coming. &gt;&gt; You do not have to go looking for it. &gt;&gt; You do not have to search it out. &gt;&gt; It's coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It will come this afternoon at lunchtime, maybe. You know the devil don't even wait for Monday morning. Sometimes this afternoon &gt;&gt; use the sword. &gt;&gt; Even if you use it poorly, &gt;&gt; the faith of the weakest Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sends the devil running. &gt;&gt; Because he has no defense against it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's let's just uh stand to our feet, bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, you just you forgive me, Lord, for the time taken, Lord. And for if I've just extended this out, Lord, too long. You, Lord, you just find some grace in your sight, Lord. I It's just a Lord, a message that we It just doesn't do it justice, Lord, to talk about your word in such a short time, Lord. But if it just sparks, Lord, if it just sparks a little thing in someone's life and they go, I'm going to go find out more about that armor for myself, Lord. Then Lord, may a mission be accomplished today, Lord. And Lord, may we not be afraid, Lord, to go out in battle. And Lord, know that there is a camp. There is a headquarters where there's food, there's supply, there's medicine, Lord, there's training so that we can not, Lord, stay in the camp so we can go back out and fight for you, Lord. And Lord, all this isn't a battle, Lord, that you've already won. But it's an exercise, Lord, of our faith. It's an exercise of our patience, Lord. That tribulation, Lord, that we glory in works patience, Father. &gt;&gt; And you know what we need. You know, a character change that we have to have, Lord. That only a conflict will bring on, Lord. And I pray that you would just grow everyone here into, Lord, that armor that you have for them, Lord. Just take this broken up, just rushed message, Lord. But, Lord, there's some there's some truth. There's truth in there, Lord. That Lord, that we cannot we cannot lose because you've gone before us, Lord. You are that great general, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, and I believe the word says, Lord, that when we put on that armor that's inside, then it's actually you inside of us, Lord. &gt;&gt; And if you're inside us, Lord, then you, Lord, are fighting the battle through us, Father. That Lord, you wear us into battle, Father. that you, Lord, walk forward with our feet and our hands, Lord, and our eyes and our heart, Lord, into battle, but you're the source of strength behind it, Lord. And I pray that we would just recognize that, Lord, that that it's not that that battles are not a bad sign, that they are necessary, Lord, and that you, Lord, have equipped us to handle them. Father, if we failed you, Lord, bring us to that place of repentance, Lord. We don't we don't want to be, Lord, deficient in your sight, Lord. We don't want to be holding back, Father. I know I don't. I believe there's every hand in here that would raise right now, Lord, with eyes closed. I believe there's a heart at the end of every hand, Lord, that says, "Lord, I've failed you. I've messed up. Maybe even today, Lord. Maybe even yesterday. I've I've just gone so wrong, but Lord, would you forgive me? Don't cast me out, Lord. I want you. I want your armor. I want your word. I want victory in my life. I want overcoming for me, for my family, Lord, for my church, for my community, for my own soul. Lord, I want you more. I believe that you see every hand raised, Lord. I see I know that you do, Father. You compel us, Lord, to defy the laws of gravity, Lord, and raise our hand up. It's not just, Lord, a a physical motion, Lord. It's a surrendering. And I pray to you, Lord, that behind the heart of every hand, Father, you would come in right now. And that you would strengthen that life, Lord, with the armor of God. That Lord, you would just have a breakthrough in that life at this moment, Father, that they would recognize who they are, Lord. That there's a truth that no matter what the devil says, he has no truth in his lie. That he can't touch this word of God. And this word of God declares who I am. I am a child of God. I am a child of thee, King. And there's no devil that can stand before me. &gt;&gt; Though I fall many times, Lord, I'll get back up. Take a word, Lord, and just plant it deep down in the heart. Now, may everyone here, Lord, be so hungry to know what that armor is that they go and seek it out, Lord. if they have it, Lord, that maybe they have that armor that they Lord, seek out a way to just tighten it up, Lord, just to just cinch it a little bit stronger. Make sure it's in place. Make sure that that shield hand is strong. Make sure that sword is wielded. Lord, you have it in your word for a reason, Lord. It's not just a good story. It's not just a good book. Lord, this is life. It's the only way to life. Father, we love and thank you for the word and just enjoy your presence, Lord, in Jesus name. Amen. All my words fall short. I've got nothing new. How could I express all my gratitude? I could sing these songs as I often do. Every song must end and you never do. So I throw up my hands and praise you again and again. Cuz all that I have is a hallelu. [Music] Hallelu. [Music] And I know it's not much. I've nothing else fit for a king except for a heart singing hallelu. Hallelujah. [Music] I've got one response. I've got just one move with my arms stretch wide. I will worship you. So I throw up my hands and praise you again and again. Cuz all that I have is a hallelujah. Hallelu. And I know it's not much, but I've nothing else fit for a king except for a heart singing hallelujah. Hallelujah. Come on my soul. Oh, come on my soul. Oh, don't you get shy on me. Lift up your soul cuz you got a lion inside of those lungs. Get up there and praise the Lord. Oh, come on, my soul. Oh, don't you get shy on me. Lift up your soul. Cuz you got a lion inside those lungs. get up there and praise the Lord. [Music] So I throw up my hands and praise you again and again. Cuz all that I have is a highle hallelu. I know it's not much. I've nothing else fit for a king except for a heart singing hallelu hallelujah. You are my refuge. You are my sanctuary. When I feel afraid, you're my hiding place. You are my refuge. And when the storm is raing underneath your wings, I rejoice and sing. You are my refuge. And you are my refuge. You are my sanuary. [Music] When I feel afraid, you're my hiding place. You are my refuge. And when the storm is raing underneath your wings, I rejoice and sing. You are my refuge. [Music] You know, he's a God who can make himself this little and he can expand over the whole universe. Sometimes we imagine him so great and so big, why would he care for me? But he knows you are. And as he hung there on a cross and when he said it is finished, it's because everyone, every name, every person, every part of him was included. Are you a part of him? Is he a part of you? Amen. You still have to have a battle, but you know he's a battle scarred veteran. Where did you get those wounds? When they asked him in the house of my friends. He's a battle scard veteran. He understands. Amen. I Tonight I'm supposed to speak and I gave him 15 minutes of my time. So that's okay. Don't hold it against him. But you know what? Every every word that was said was needed today. So Amen. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Amen. Sometimes you go to the doctor and the doctor just says, "Oh, you just need this." And sometimes you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "We need to do some some investigating to see what causes." And God works that same way. Amen. Let's just bow our heads. The scripture says, "Lord, there you were wounded for our transgressions. You were bruised for our iniquities. and the chastisement for our peace was laid upon you and by your stripes we are healed. Lord, you felt the filling of our infirmities. You you were tempted and tried in every manner. You you went out on by yourself out there and up on the mountain for 40 days and Satan knew you were there. And he said, "After 40 days, he has to be weak. I'll take him down now." But you stood on your own word, the word of God, and you defeated him, and you defeated him, and you defeated him. Lord, if we'll take what you've given us today, then we are more than able. Lord, thank you for your word today. May each one of us take it and apply it. As we as we leave, as we go out, let us not leave our armor here. Let us take it with us. Let us get up in the morning, Lord. We put that armor before we go out. Let somebody question it. Why are you wearing that? Why are you dressed that way? Because I represent a kingdom. I represent this army force. This is my uniform. But it's not just a uniform. is my protection. It's what keeps me. It's what helps me. Lord, let us not be ashamed. Father, thank you for your word, Lord. Will you as we go, Lord? Would you go with us? You will go with us if we'll take you, Lord. Let us always am rooting for you, Lord. Lord, and if anyone has a need this morning and would like to be prayed with, Brother Ryan would would do that. He said he would, Lord. It's not brother Ryan that's going to cause Lord. It's going to be you answering the meeting. Lord, we just we ask that so commit the rest of this day to you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. God bless you as you go. If you'd like to stay, if you would like to be prayed over, that's fine. If you're going to leave, just go ahead and go out quietly. And those that would like prayer. Amen. When I think about the Lord, how he saved me, how he raised me, how he filled me with the Holy Ghost, how he healed me to the uttermost. And I think about the Lord. How he picked me up and turned me around. How he placed my feet on solid ground. And it makes me want to shout, "Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Lord, you're worthy of all of the glory and all of the honor and all of the praise. And it makes me want to shout, "Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
