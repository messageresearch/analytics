[17:28] That's up to you. He's provided
[17:30] everything. So, there were no written
[17:33] requests, but I asked brother Ed how his
[17:36] sister Lori was doing.
[17:41] Okay. And um she's going in intensive
[17:45] rehab now. And if all things work well,
[17:49] she'll be coming down to Tucson at the

[18:17] our Lord. Amen. Let's just bow our
[18:20] heads. Lord, how many times have we've
[18:23] come and we've gathered and we've sat in
[18:27] our chairs or we we stood but we really
[18:29] didn't
[18:30] participate. We didn't take what you've
[18:33] offered us Lord. You didn't say come and
[18:36] see. You said come and take be part of
[18:39] Lord. So everyone here this morning Lord
[18:43] let us come Lord let them receive from
[18:45] you and take Lord what they have need of
[18:48] as you offer it. Lord, you you've come
[18:52] and and it shows in the scripture. You

[18:56] asked and they received. Lord, Lord,
[18:58] this sister that is with kidney disease,
[19:01] Lord, there's nothing impossible for
[19:04] you. There was a man in the tomb for
[19:06] three days that had been dead and you
[19:08] called him out and he came out. He was
[19:09] alive. Lord, nothing impossible for you.
[19:12] You know each heart. You know each need.
[19:15] You know each desire.
[19:17] Lord, even Lord, as as we draw and you
[19:20] would anoint your servant to minister
[19:22] this morning, may we receive what we
[19:24] have need of, Lord. And as I take up the
[19:27] offering, may we be cheerful givers and
[19:29] may it be used, Lord, for what it is
[19:31] needed for. We pray in Jesus Christ's
[19:33] name.
[19:38] Amen. Amen. Also, tonight we are not
[19:42] going to have a uh a singing and worship
[19:44] service, a praise and worship service.

[19:48] next week. We're still going to have

[19:52] talk and we might have a baptism.
[19:55] [Music]
[20:02] Amen. Away. And I give myself away. I
[20:08] give myself

[30:13] hallelujah in the middle of the
[30:19] mystery. I'll raise a
[30:25] hallelujah in fear. You lost your hold
[30:29] on me.
[30:31] Let's
[30:33] pray. Lord, we raise a hallelujah to
[30:35] you.
[30:37] give you praise, Lord, for your
[30:39] goodness, how your hand has been upon
[30:42] us. Father, you brought us to church
[30:44] this
[30:45] morning. Lord, we pray that you would be
[30:50] welcome in our congregation. And Father,
[30:52] that you would speak to hearts, answer
[30:55] questions, and Lord, that your presence
[30:57] would be among us. Grant, Lord, give me
[31:01] wisdom as I open up this book of
[31:03] Colossians and continue on. Father, may
[31:07] your
[31:08] blessings be upon everything that I say
[31:11] this morning in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[31:15] You can be seated. God bless
[31:20] you. And bless you. Welcome. Hey, uh
[31:24] let's see any visitors except Elijah and
[31:28] Danielle. God bless you. Welcome. It's
[31:30] good to see you again. You uh you're
[31:33] here at Wednesday night service. It's
[31:34] nice. It's nice to see you again. God
[31:36] bless
[31:36] you. Um, we've been going through the
[31:39] book of
[31:40] Colossians and, uh, Brother Jordan, I'm
[31:43] sorry. Could you turn my monitor down
[31:45] just a hair? Thank you. Um, we've been
[31:48] going through the book of
[31:50] Colossians and
[31:53] um, it's been just I hope it's been a
[31:57] blessing to you because it's really been
[31:58] a blessing to me and going through and
[32:01] digging into this letter. It was written
[32:05] of course by the apostle Paul. It uh it
[32:09] was it was written when he was in prison
[32:11] and it's to a group of people that he
[32:14] has probably never met before. It me the
[32:18] letter mentions a man named Epaparis who
[32:21] was probably the pastor of this church
[32:23] at
[32:24] Colassi. These are new Christians that
[32:28] this letter is written to. They probably
[32:31] most of them were gentile. And the
[32:35] apostle Paul is explaining what it means
[32:38] to be a
[32:39] Christian. And friends, we can grow up
[32:44] maybe in a church or grow up with a good
[32:47] family. And you might realize you might
[32:50] be 20 years old, 30 years old, 50 years
[32:53] old. You might even be 70 years old. And
[32:56] you might realize, you know, I grew up
[32:59] with a church doctrine, but I I don't
[33:01] know really what it means to be a
[33:04] Christian. In this
[33:06] book, this letter to the
[33:09] Colossians, Paul is explaining what it
[33:12] means. He's explaining that that this is
[33:18] everything. And friends, it is
[33:20] everything. I
[33:22] pray that when I leave this world and
[33:26] when you leave this world that we can
[33:29] look back and meet people over on the
[33:32] other side that might say, "I learned
[33:35] what it was to be be a Christian at the
[33:37] Tucson
[33:38] Tabernacle." Those people represented
[33:40] Jesus Christ
[33:42] well and I
[33:44] learned how to live a life and I learned
[33:49] what Jesus Christ did for me. Daniel
[33:53] sang that song, my life is not my own.
[33:57] To you I belong. I give myself away so
[34:00] you can use me.
[34:02] It's a beautiful I think that is one of
[34:04] the most perfect songs that he could
[34:05] have sang for this that this being a
[34:08] Christian is it's giving your life
[34:11] taking off the old person the old sinful
[34:14] person and putting on a whole new
[34:17] person. Chapter one
[34:20] uh Paul gives an introduction and then
[34:22] he emphasizes the deity and the
[34:25] preeminence and the
[34:27] supremacy of this man Jesus Christ. He
[34:31] says this. He says that he is the
[34:33] invisible. He is the image of the
[34:35] invisible
[34:37] God. He is what God looks like. He is
[34:42] the image of the invisible God, the
[34:44] firstborn over all creation. For by him
[34:46] all things were created that are in
[34:48] heaven and that are on earth, visible
[34:51] and invisible, whether thrones or
[34:53] dominions or principalities or powers.
[34:55] All things were created through him and
[34:59] for him.
[35:01] He is before all things and in him all
[35:03] things consist. And he is the head of
[35:05] the body, the church, who is the
[35:08] beginning, the firstborn from the dead,
[35:11] that in all things he may have the
[35:15] preeminence. Chapter one, Paul is
[35:18] introducing this man, Jesus Christ. He's
[35:21] not just a prophet. He is God in flesh.
[35:25] And then in chapter two, Paul warns of
[35:29] of things that either have entered the
[35:31] church or may enter the church in the
[35:33] future. Paul warns of legalism. He warns
[35:37] of other religious influences from other
[35:40] sources, not necessarily Jewish sources,
[35:43] but other sources that could turn these
[35:47] people's eyes away from the Lord Jesus
[35:50] and to a religious belief and not to
[35:56] their their savior. He says this,
[35:58] "Therefore, if you died with Christ from
[36:01] the basic principles of the world, why
[36:04] as though living in the world, do you
[36:07] subject yourselves to
[36:09] regulations, do not touch, do not taste,
[36:11] do not handle, which all things which
[36:14] all concern things which perish with
[36:17] using according to the commandments and
[36:20] the doctrines of men.
[36:22] These things indeed have an appearance
[36:24] of appearance of
[36:26] wisdom and
[36:28] self-imposed
[36:30] religion, false
[36:32] humility, and the neglect and neglect of
[36:35] the body, but are of no value against
[36:38] the indulgence of the
[36:40] flesh. So he's telling the audience,
[36:42] don't just cover up their weaknesses.
[36:45] Don't just cover up your sins with
[36:48] religion, but attack the root of of the
[36:52] problem. And then in chapter
[36:55] three, Paul takes the foundation that he
[36:59] laid
[37:01] earlier and he encourages the reader to
[37:05] apply what he has said to their own
[37:08] lives. He tells them to put off the old
[37:10] man of sin and put on and put on a new
[37:15] man. We've got through I believe last
[37:17] week we got through the first nine
[37:19] verses. So I want to go back and review
[37:22] a little bit. I want to go through the
[37:23] first nine view verses. We'll go quickly
[37:25] in chapter 3 and then we'll uh see how
[37:30] the time is and we'll spend the
[37:31] remainder of the time on chapter 3 and I
[37:33] don't know how far we'll get but let's
[37:36] go to chapter 3 verse one. Colossians
[37:38] chapter 3 verse one. And it uh it
[37:43] reads, it reads like
[37:47] this. If ye then be risen with Christ,
[37:51] seek those things which are above, where
[37:55] Christ siteth on the right hand of God.
[37:58] Set your affection on things above, and
[38:00] not on things of the earth. For you are
[38:03] dead, and your life is hid with Christ
[38:06] in God.
[38:08] When Christ who is our
[38:11] life shall appear, then shall you also
[38:14] appear with him in
[38:16] glory. Mortify therefore your members
[38:19] which are upon the earth, fornication,
[38:23] uncleanness, inordinate
[38:25] affection, evil concupisence, and
[38:28] covetousness, which is idolatry. For
[38:31] which things sake the wrath of God
[38:33] cometh on the children of disobedience,
[38:36] in the which ye also walked some time
[38:40] when you lived in
[38:43] them. So this review from last, this is
[38:47] a review from last week, but I feel like
[38:49] I should just spend a little bit more
[38:51] time on these things that Paul said.
[38:54] I'll read uh I'll read that read that
[38:58] again.
[39:00] Therefore, put to death, mortify, put to
[39:04] death your members which are on the
[39:07] earth. Fornication, that's sex outside
[39:10] of wedlock, outside of marriage,
[39:12] uncleanness, which is
[39:14] impurity. Passion, which is
[39:18] lust, evil
[39:20] concupisence, that word doesn't exist
[39:22] today. It's it's old English, but it's
[39:25] evil
[39:26] desires and covetousness.
[39:29] wanting something that is not yours,
[39:32] also called
[39:35] greed, which is idolatry. Anything that
[39:38] takes the place of God in your life is
[39:41] idolatry is what Paul is trying to say
[39:45] here. Gre greed or desiring something
[39:48] that is not yours easily consumes our
[39:51] thoughts, easily consumes our desires. I
[39:54] talked about David last week and how
[39:56] David coveted another man's wife and
[39:59] those thoughts led to actions and those
[40:03] actions they they led to um adultery.
[40:06] They led to uh um conceiving a child.
[40:10] The child died and it it just led to all
[40:14] kinds of problems with this coveting
[40:17] someone else, someone else's property
[40:20] back then. I don't mean a wife's
[40:22] property, but I mean coveting another
[40:24] man's wife or something that someone
[40:26] else has. Because of these
[40:29] things, because of these things, the
[40:31] wrath of God is coming upon the sons of
[40:33] disobedience in which you yourselves
[40:36] once walked when you lived in them. So
[40:38] most of the things that I just read are
[40:40] talking about sexual immorality. And you
[40:44] know, talking with my kids over the
[40:46] years with Daniel and
[40:48] Meline, the really the number one issue
[40:54] with young people with growing up, the
[40:57] number one thing that causes problems is
[41:01] living
[41:02] immorally. And it causes it can cause
[41:05] you problems for the rest of your life.
[41:07] And Paul here, he's saying that now you
[41:10] came out of the world and you may have
[41:13] done these things
[41:15] before, but there's grace there. And
[41:17] Paul's not condemning anyone for doing
[41:19] that, but he's saying, "You came out of
[41:21] this world, now don't do it
[41:24] anymore." He cares for the audience. And
[41:27] he's saying he's saying this not through
[41:29] legalism, not through rules, but through
[41:31] love. He's telling them, "I want I want
[41:34] to protect you from these things.
[41:37] I went through these last week and and
[41:39] let's continue
[41:41] on. Verse number eight. But now you also
[41:46] put off these things. So put off. Okay.
[41:50] Now that I've told you about this
[41:51] immorality, now keep going and put off
[41:55] these things.
[41:57] Anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy
[42:01] communication out of your mouth. Anger.
[42:04] He said, "Watch your temper." He says,
[42:07] "You He says, "Be careful with this."
[42:09] Now, you can't help it if somebody makes
[42:11] you
[42:12] angry. I understand that. We're human
[42:15] beings. You can't you can't help it. You
[42:17] might not have had your coffee this
[42:19] morning. And and brother Jonathan,
[42:22] that's a bad thing. Some for some
[42:24] people. You just you're
[42:27] grumpy. You might have had a hard day at
[42:30] work. You might just be in a bad mood.
[42:33] Ask my wife. She She knows her husband
[42:36] is gets in just a bad mood
[42:39] sometimes. But it's the Bible says in
[42:41] Ephesians 4:26, it says, "Be
[42:44] angry and sin
[42:47] not." So he's saying the Apostle Paul
[42:49] also wrote this letter to the Ephesians.
[42:52] He says that yeah, you you can be angry.
[42:55] You can't help that, but don't act on
[42:57] that an anger. Don't sin. and do not let
[43:01] the sun go down on your
[43:03] wrath. And if you have a newer
[43:06] translation, a new King James or many
[43:08] other translations, you'll see that that
[43:09] those words are in
[43:11] quotes. Paul is quoting a
[43:15] psalm in Ephesians. He's quoting Psalm
[43:19] 4, verse
[43:21] 4. The King James says, "Stand in awe
[43:24] and sin not." That wording just simply
[43:26] does not mean the same thing today as it
[43:28] did when it was written in the original
[43:30] Hebrew and when it was translated in
[43:32] English a few hundred years ago. The
[43:33] amplified version of that says, "Tremble
[43:36] with anger or fear and do not
[43:41] sin. Meditate in your heart upon your
[43:45] bed and be still. Reflect on your sin
[43:49] and repent of your rebellion."
[43:52] Cila, the New King James says, "Be angry
[43:55] and sin not. Meditate within your heart
[43:58] on your bed and be still and put your
[44:01] trust in the Lord." Again, the Apostle
[44:04] Paul is quoting that when he writes in
[44:07] Ephesians, "Be angry and do not sin. Do
[44:09] not let the sun go down on your wrath."
[44:11] You might not be able to prevent getting
[44:13] angry, but when you get angry, don't act
[44:18] upon that anger.
[44:21] Now, you do have 100% control of what
[44:24] you do. You can't help the feelings that
[44:27] you get, but you have 100% control on
[44:30] your what you do. Um, when you
[44:33] experience those
[44:34] feelings, I was talking earlier, Brother
[44:37] Jordan and I were were in the front and
[44:39] we were talking about that there are
[44:43] there's a spiritual battle going on all
[44:46] the time. There are spiritual
[44:49] influences, supernatural things going on
[44:52] in our life. There are heavenly things
[44:54] influencing us right now. There are
[44:57] heavenly things influencing us,
[44:58] influencing us. The kingdom of heaven is
[45:00] there. And then there are dark evil
[45:04] things influencing us also. That is the
[45:07] kingdom of darkness.
[45:10] You might not be able to help when you
[45:12] have a feeling, but you 100% control
[45:15] your an your actions in response to
[45:19] those those those um that stimulant. And
[45:24] it always almost and almost always what
[45:27] comes out of your
[45:29] mouth
[45:30] shows if you have given into the powers
[45:33] of heaven or if you've given into the
[45:35] powers of darkness.
[45:38] James chapter
[45:40] 3 verse 5. I'll read the New King James
[45:42] version. He said, "Even so, the tongue
[45:45] is a little member and boasts great
[45:48] things. See how great a forest a little
[45:51] fire kindles." You start a fire in the
[45:55] forest and the wind kicks up, especially
[45:56] this time of year, and it can burn
[45:59] thousands or tens of thousands, hundreds
[46:01] of thousands of acres and kill people
[46:03] with just a little
[46:05] spark. And the tongue is a
[46:08] fire, a world of iniquity. The tongue is
[46:12] so set among our members that it defiles
[46:15] the whole body and sets on fire the
[46:18] course of nature and is set on fire by
[46:23] hell. It is influenced by the powers of
[46:26] darkness. For every kind of beast and
[46:29] bird, reptile and creature of the sea is
[46:33] tamed and has been tamed by mankind. But
[46:35] no man can tame the
[46:37] tongue. It is an unruly evil full of
[46:40] deadly poison. With it we bless our God
[46:44] and Father, and with it we curse
[46:48] men who have been made in the simultude
[46:51] of
[46:52] God. Out of the same mouth proceeds
[46:55] blessing and
[46:56] cursing. My brethren, these things ought
[46:59] not to be
[47:00] so. Does a spring send forth fresh water
[47:03] and bitter from the same opening? Can a
[47:05] fig tree, my brethren, bear olives, or a
[47:07] grape vine, bear
[47:09] figs? Thus, no spring yields both salt,
[47:12] water, and
[47:13] fresh. He's saying here, you're one or
[47:16] the other. You can't have filth coming
[47:19] out of your mouth and the words of
[47:22] God. And that
[47:25] explanation will cover the sins that
[47:28] Paul lists over here in Colossians.
[47:30] Let's go back to 3:8. anger, wrath,
[47:33] which is rage,
[47:35] malice, wanting something bad to happen
[47:37] to
[47:39] someone. When you say, "Watch what
[47:42] happens to that person after they've
[47:44] done something wrong or wronged you or
[47:46] wronged a church," you may say that you
[47:49] don't desire something bad to happen,
[47:52] but you are really desiring evil to
[47:55] happen to that person. If someone wrongs
[47:58] you or someone wrongs the church or
[47:59] someone says something they shouldn't
[48:01] and you say just watch what
[48:04] happens, you're actually wanting malice.
[48:08] You you're actually feeling malice for
[48:09] that person. Blasphemy in this context,
[48:14] blasphemy is
[48:16] slander. It's a false statement that
[48:18] damages a person's
[48:20] reputation and filthy communication out
[48:23] of your mouth. It's dirty language. As I
[48:25] said last week, to me that is the best
[48:29] way to identify if someone is serving
[48:32] the Lord or if someone is not. What is
[48:35] the topic of their conversation? Are
[48:37] they talking about the Lord? Are they
[48:39] swearing and talking evil? Are that's
[48:43] when Peter when when Jesus was being
[48:46] crucified and Peter was afraid, he
[48:49] didn't want to be associated with Jesus
[48:51] because he thought that he was going to
[48:52] be persecuted. He thought he was going
[48:54] to be in prison. What did he do to
[48:56] disassociate himself with Jesus? He
[48:58] started
[49:00] swearing. Therefore, trying to take
[49:02] himself
[49:04] away, to disconnect himself from this
[49:08] man called Jesus
[49:10] Christ. Verse number nine, lie not one
[49:14] to another, seeing that you have put off
[49:17] the old man with you have put off the
[49:21] old man with his deeds. This is where I
[49:23] stopped last week. So Paul tells us of
[49:25] getting rid of im immorality, getting
[49:27] rid of dirty living, getting rid of your
[49:29] temper, getting rid of wrath, getting
[49:31] rid of malice, slander, dirty language.
[49:35] Might identify with Legion, the one that
[49:37] had the demons cast out of them. They
[49:39] might identify with that thief that was
[49:41] on the cross that had lived a bad life
[49:43] his whole life. And then right at the
[49:45] end, God Jesus Christ saved him right at
[49:47] the end. They might identify with Peter
[49:50] with his cursing to separate himself
[49:52] with from
[49:53] Jesus. People here in our room
[49:57] today. And then there's others, there's
[50:00] people in this
[50:01] church that might identify with the
[50:04] self-righteous
[50:06] ones, never open to anything from God if
[50:09] it didn't line up with their doctrines
[50:11] and
[50:13] legalistic. They would judge someone
[50:15] else's walk with the Lord by their
[50:17] outward appearance, the way they were
[50:20] dressed. That spirit is much
[50:23] harder to break than the immoral spirit.
[50:28] But there are those here that can
[50:30] identify with that spirit also. Maybe
[50:34] with
[50:35] Nicodemus the priest, maybe with the
[50:38] Apostle
[50:39] Paul who was very straight laced, very
[50:43] legalistic and yet a
[50:46] sinner. There are many of us that can
[50:48] relate to him or even to Peter. Peter,
[50:53] he gets to be on both sides here. When
[50:55] Peter when he had that vision on the on
[50:57] the rooftop and and he was given things
[51:00] to eat, he was hungry and he was given
[51:02] things to eat that were previous
[51:03] unclean. He says, "Lord, nothing unclean
[51:05] has ever entered into my body. Nothing
[51:07] unclean unclean has ever came into my
[51:09] mouth. I'm too good for that, Lord." The
[51:13] Lord said, "Peter, why do you make
[51:15] unclean what I have made
[51:17] clean?" So, we can identify. Think about
[51:21] it now. Who do you identify with? Do you
[51:25] identify
[51:26] with Mary Magdalene in those that group
[51:30] or do you identify with
[51:32] Paul and that
[51:34] group? If you have changed your life,
[51:38] you can probably identify with one or
[51:40] both of those groups. Both of those
[51:43] types of sinners are represented here in
[51:45] our congregation this morning.
[51:49] A
[51:51] spirit once that spirit is
[51:54] gone, it's replaced with compassion for
[51:58] those maybe who get on our nerves. It's
[52:01] replaced with a spirit of love for those
[52:04] remember the time this was written 2,000
[52:06] years ago. This is a Roman Empire. There
[52:08] was slavery back then. It was a part of
[52:12] life 2,000 years ago. We'll get into
[52:14] that a little bit later in the book. The
[52:16] Greeks and the Romans, they had immoral
[52:19] practices. They had immoral living. They
[52:21] worshiped idols. They worshiped false
[52:23] gods. They worshiped Zeus and Apollo and
[52:26] Aries and Hercules and Diana and all
[52:29] this. They did all this weird stuff. And
[52:31] they lived
[52:33] immorally. And the Jews, they had been
[52:36] taught for about 2,000 years that they
[52:37] should not mix with the Gentiles. They
[52:40] shouldn't worship with them. They
[52:42] shouldn't even touch them, shake their
[52:45] hand because they were unclean. The
[52:48] Gentiles basically they were anyone who
[52:51] wasn't a Jew and they ate unclean
[52:53] animals. They they touched unclean
[52:56] things. They didn't wash properly. They
[52:59] lived
[53:01] immorally. the barbarians. He mentions
[53:03] the barbarians. They were a nomadic
[53:05] people from from up north like in
[53:08] southern Russia. And they were probably
[53:10] um they were considered wild, considered
[53:14] immoral, considered crazy warlike
[53:17] people. And the schyians that he's me me
[53:19] me me me me me me me me me me me me me
[53:19] me me me me me me me me me me me me me
[53:19] me me me me me me me me me me me me
[53:19] mentioning there are a certain type of
[53:21] barbarian that they rode horses in
[53:24] battle and they were usually even more
[53:26] fierce than the barbarians more
[53:29] wild sinful than these normal
[53:33] barbarians. And back then the Jews
[53:36] probably considered these people more
[53:39] animal than they did human.
[53:43] The Jews, at least in their own mind,
[53:46] they were God's chosen people. They
[53:48] believed the laws of the prophets. They
[53:50] lived clean lives. They didn't mix with
[53:52] other races. And they were they were
[53:54] just different than the Gentiles. And
[53:57] friends, when we judge someone based on
[54:00] their skin color or where they go to
[54:02] church or the clothes that they wear,
[54:04] then we should also take the correction
[54:07] from this apostle that he's giving us in
[54:09] this book of Colossians. If someone
[54:11] accepts Jesus
[54:13] Christ as their savior and has a desire
[54:16] for a better better life, then they have
[54:20] my right hand of fellowship.
[54:23] Then I welcome
[54:26] them. Catholic or Protestant.
[54:29] Calvary Chapel, Zion
[54:32] City, Baptist, Lutheran, really Baptist,
[54:36] Lutheran or
[54:37] message, poor or rich, educated or
[54:41] uneducated. You friends are my brother
[54:44] or my sister. If you believe on this one
[54:48] that Paul was trying to teach this man,
[54:51] Jesus
[54:53] Christ.
[54:54] Verse number 11 again. Where there is
[54:56] neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor
[54:59] uncircumcision, barbarian, schyian, bond
[55:02] or free, but Christ is all and in all.
[55:07] Jesus Christ is what matters, not
[55:09] division.
[55:11] Couple verses before put Paul says, "Put
[55:13] off all this immorality and anger and
[55:15] malice and and
[55:17] prejudice." I uh so I I searched what
[55:20] really prejudice means. We all have a
[55:22] probably an understanding. So, I put it
[55:24] in Microsoft Copilot AI and and it said
[55:27] this, an unfair and unreasonable opinion
[55:32] or feeling typically formed without
[55:35] sufficient thought or
[55:37] knowledge. Additionally, prejudice can
[55:39] be seen as a bias or preconceived
[55:42] opinion about someone based on their
[55:44] membership in a particular group. Apply
[55:49] that in a religious sense.
[55:53] Prejudice,
[55:55] prejudice, pre prejudging. Paul says,
[55:58] "Don't do
[56:00] it." If you visit a church or another
[56:03] church and they don't look like you,
[56:05] they don't talk like you, they don't act
[56:07] like you, maybe they're from a different
[56:09] demographic, we don't judge. And Paul is
[56:12] saying that very plainly right here. He
[56:14] says there's no separation with God.
[56:17] Put on therefore as the elect of God,
[56:19] holy and beloved, bowels of mercies,
[56:22] kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness,
[56:25] longsuffering. He's saying that you are
[56:27] the elect of God, holy and beloved. Now,
[56:30] put on mercies and kindness, humbleness
[56:32] of mind. Don't think that you have it
[56:34] all figured out because of your
[56:36] religion. Be humble in your
[56:39] mind, willing to change, and willing to
[56:41] learn something outside of your comfort
[56:43] zone.
[56:45] That's how you make progress with the
[56:46] Lord. That's how I make progress with
[56:48] the Lord. New Living Translation of
[56:50] verse 12 says this. Since God chose you
[56:53] to be
[56:54] holy people he loves, you must clothe
[56:58] yourselves with tenderhearted mercy,
[57:01] kindness, humility, gentleness,
[57:05] patience. Now listen to this verse
[57:08] number 13.
[57:10] forbearing one
[57:11] another and forgiving one another. If
[57:15] any man have a quarrel against any, even
[57:17] as Christ forgave you, so also do
[57:22] ye. As Christ forgave you, so also
[57:26] forgive
[57:27] others. This is a hard
[57:30] one. This is really tough for certain
[57:34] people.
[57:36] I remember when my my kids when they
[57:39] were growing up, they were allowed to
[57:41] say certain things and they weren't
[57:42] allowed to say certain things and I tell
[57:43] them I tell them a story and the the
[57:48] biggest insult they could pay each other
[57:50] something they were allowed to say was
[57:54] what? No, hypocrite.
[57:58] Oh man, that was like that was the
[58:01] ultimate thing that they could say
[58:03] without getting in trouble.
[58:05] I'd read the scriptures and and Daniel,
[58:08] he couldn't talk and and he'd say he'd
[58:11] say,
[58:12] "Daddy, Meline, Jesus, a blind Pharisee
[58:18] hypocrit." Quoting quoting Jesus, blind
[58:22] Pharisee,
[58:24] hypocrite. And Paul is saying, "Don't be
[58:27] that hypocrite." The definition of a
[58:30] hypocrite is a person who claims or
[58:33] pretends to have certain beliefs about
[58:35] what is right but behaves in a way that
[58:38] disagrees with those beliefs.
[58:41] So if you have sinned, if you have lied,
[58:44] if you have done any of the things that
[58:46] I listed earlier, if you've been
[58:48] dishonest, if you've done anything
[58:50] immoral or if if you anything that you
[58:54] have ever done that does not line up
[58:56] with the Bible or even with general
[58:58] morality and respect, then you have
[59:01] sinned against God.
[59:04] Christ came to take our sins upon
[59:09] himself so we could be delivered. That's
[59:12] Christianity. If you don't see sins in
[59:14] your life, the the Apostle John says
[59:18] that you're
[59:19] foolish. We all have sins in our life
[59:22] and we all come short of the glory of
[59:24] God. We are willing for our sins. We're
[59:27] willing to slap our sins on Jesus Christ
[59:30] and ask for forgiveness when he himself
[59:32] said that you that you are just forgive
[59:37] us of our trespasses as we forgive those
[59:40] that trespass against
[59:43] us. Back to Colossians
[59:47] 3. Forbearing one another, bearing with
[59:50] one another and forgiving one another.
[59:52] If any man have a quarrel against any,
[59:54] even as Christ forgave you, so also do
[59:58] ye. He says, if anyone has a quarrel
[1:00:01] against anyone, he doesn't say believer
[1:00:04] unbeliever. He doesn't say Christian,
[1:00:07] non-Christian. Other translations say,
[1:00:09] if one has a complaint, a complaint
[1:00:11] against another, forgiving each other.
[1:00:14] Can you
[1:00:16] imagine if that was true in us?
[1:00:20] Can you imagine if we really did that?
[1:00:23] If we really acted that way. I saw two
[1:00:26] brothers get in an argument the other
[1:00:28] day. These things happen. As I said,
[1:00:31] we're human. Those those that it
[1:00:34] happens. And the Lord sometimes will
[1:00:36] allow us to sin. He'll take his hand off
[1:00:40] of us just for a moment and he'll allow
[1:00:43] us to sin just to see what we are going
[1:00:46] to do after we catch ourselves in that
[1:00:49] sin. Are we going to are we going to dig
[1:00:51] in and say I'm right or are we going to
[1:00:53] humble down like like the Apostle Paul
[1:00:55] here says and bear with one another?
[1:00:58] They were they were arguing. and the two
[1:01:00] brothers got in an argument and then
[1:01:02] after a little while the Holy Spirit
[1:01:05] came out in both of these brethren
[1:01:09] brothers and it wasn't
[1:01:11] long both of them are saying brother I'm
[1:01:14] sorry I love
[1:01:17] you brother I I'm sorry for what I said
[1:01:21] and and please forgive me that is a real
[1:01:27] Christian when I witnessed
[1:01:29] that I just put my head down. Lord,
[1:01:32] thank you. That's a Christian. A
[1:01:35] Christian sins. We sin. We beat
[1:01:38] ourselves up for sinning. We we continue
[1:01:40] to do wrong. Brother Aaron, as as you
[1:01:43] were saying earlier today, that once
[1:01:46] once you make a change in your life,
[1:01:47] maybe once you give your heart to the
[1:01:49] Lord, that doesn't mean that things
[1:01:51] start getting easier. That doesn't mean
[1:01:53] that you stop sinning. That doesn't mean
[1:01:56] the the only thing that changes is now
[1:01:59] your desire is for God and not for
[1:02:03] Satan. And you you push yourself, Lord,
[1:02:06] I want to be better. I want to be
[1:02:07] better. And then when you make the
[1:02:09] mistake before, you would have stuck to
[1:02:11] your guns, dug in, say, "That person
[1:02:14] owes me apology." Now you go to that
[1:02:16] person and say, "Lord, say friend, I'm
[1:02:19] sorry, sister. I'm sorry.
[1:02:21] We forgive me for acting the way I
[1:02:24] acted." And you don't expect the apology
[1:02:27] from that person. You've put it under
[1:02:29] the blood. When they say when when they
[1:02:33] come back with an apology, brother,
[1:02:35] sister, I was over that the the the
[1:02:39] moment I prayed about it. Thank you for
[1:02:42] that. But we are united in perfect
[1:02:45] harmony in Jesus
[1:02:47] Christ. Again, forebearing one another
[1:02:50] and forgiving one another. If any man
[1:02:52] have a quarrel against any, even as
[1:02:54] Christ forgave you, so also do you. And
[1:02:58] above all these things, put on
[1:03:02] charity. What's
[1:03:03] charity? Love. Put on love, which is the
[1:03:08] bond of
[1:03:10] perfectness. Yesterday, I wanted to take
[1:03:12] a break from studying. So Stephanie and
[1:03:15] I uh we watched uh a um
[1:03:19] uh one of the episodes of The
[1:03:22] Chosen. And there was it was in it was
[1:03:25] the scene in Lazarus's house. Jesus is
[1:03:29] getting close to to going to Jerusalem
[1:03:32] for the final time. They were in
[1:03:35] Lazarus's house and these two priests
[1:03:38] came in and one priest starts arguing
[1:03:41] with Jesus that they should keep the the
[1:03:44] the laws of Moses and their
[1:03:47] traditions and he was really pressing
[1:03:50] that and his mind was open to Jesus. He
[1:03:53] even told him he says I want to accept
[1:03:55] you. I want to believe you but you have
[1:03:58] to follow these commandments from the
[1:04:01] prophets. And Jesus got frustrated a
[1:04:05] little bit with him. You could tell. And
[1:04:07] he says, he says, "A new commandment I
[1:04:11] give to you that you love one another."
[1:04:18] The the video was quoting John 13. A new
[1:04:21] commandment, John 13:34, "A new
[1:04:23] commandment I give to you, that you love
[1:04:25] one another as I have loved you, that
[1:04:27] you also love one another.
[1:04:30] By this all will know that you are my
[1:04:33] disciples if you have love one for
[1:04:35] another. The words of the Lord Jesus
[1:04:39] can't just wipe them
[1:04:41] away. John
[1:04:44] 15:12 Jesus again says it. This is my
[1:04:47] commandment that you love one another as
[1:04:51] I have loved
[1:04:53] you. Love one another as Jesus has loved
[1:04:56] you.
[1:04:59] How much do you think Jesus loves us?
[1:05:01] How much do you think Jesus loves you?
[1:05:03] And he says, "Love one another as Jesus
[1:05:06] has loved
[1:05:08] you." Are you counting on the love of
[1:05:11] Jesus in your
[1:05:12] life? Are you counting on the blood that
[1:05:15] was shed on the cross because of his
[1:05:17] love for you?
[1:05:20] How much did God love
[1:05:22] me? John 3:16, for God so loved the
[1:05:25] world that he gave his only begotten
[1:05:27] son. that whosoever believes in him
[1:05:29] should not perish but have everlasting
[1:05:32] life.
[1:05:34] 3:17 For God did not send his son into
[1:05:37] the world to condemn the
[1:05:39] world, but that the world through him
[1:05:43] might be
[1:05:44] saved and we condemn each
[1:05:47] other. Back to John 15:12, he says,
[1:05:50] "This is my commandment that you love
[1:05:52] one another as I have loved
[1:05:54] you." And seeing those two brothers
[1:05:58] who got in an
[1:06:01] argument and then seeing as that
[1:06:04] argument progressed and then seeing what
[1:06:07] it ended up, both of those brothers,
[1:06:10] listen to this, both of those brothers
[1:06:14] left better people than before. They
[1:06:17] messed
[1:06:19] up. They
[1:06:21] learned. They matured. They humbled
[1:06:24] themselves. And I tell you, I left
[1:06:26] better from what I
[1:06:28] saw. Verse number 13 again, back to
[1:06:31] Colossians. Forbearing one another and
[1:06:34] forgiving one another. If any man have a
[1:06:36] quarrel against any, even as Christ
[1:06:38] forgave you, so also do ye. The same
[1:06:41] spirit that wrote the Bible, the book of
[1:06:44] John, the same the same Jesus Christ
[1:06:46] that said, "A new commandment I give
[1:06:48] you, love one another," is the same
[1:06:51] spirit that's on the Apostle Paul here.
[1:06:53] And he says, "Above all things, put on
[1:06:54] charity, which is the bond of
[1:06:58] perfectness." Early earlier in the
[1:07:01] chapter, Paul instructs us to put off
[1:07:03] sin, immorality, put off anger, and then
[1:07:08] he says to put off the virtue, then to
[1:07:11] put on the virtues of mercy and kindness
[1:07:14] and
[1:07:15] humbleness, meekness, longsuffering,
[1:07:18] bearing with one another, forgiving with
[1:07:20] forgiving one another.
[1:07:24] And let the peace of God, let me read
[1:07:25] the NIV of uh of ch of verse 14. And
[1:07:29] above all these virtues, put on love,
[1:07:32] which binds them all together in perfect
[1:07:35] unity. taking off really the old garment
[1:07:41] that was stained by the sin of the
[1:07:44] world.
[1:07:45] taking off that old man, taking off that
[1:07:49] old Daniel Evans and putting on a new
[1:07:53] garment, a new coat that is washed in
[1:07:57] the blood of Jesus Christ and zipping it
[1:08:00] up with love,
[1:08:02] tightening it up, zipping it up with the
[1:08:05] thing that's above all, which is
[1:08:09] love. And I'll close with verse 15. And
[1:08:13] let the peace of God rule in your hearts
[1:08:16] to the which also you are called in one
[1:08:19] body. And be ye
[1:08:23] thankful and be thankful. Be thankful of
[1:08:27] what you've come out
[1:08:28] of. And if you are struggling with
[1:08:32] someone, if someone did you wrong and
[1:08:35] you're just having a hard time with
[1:08:37] that, don't let those powers of darkness
[1:08:39] rule your life.
[1:08:42] Get down on your knees and pray for that
[1:08:46] person. Pray for that church. Pray for
[1:08:48] that job. Pray for whatever it was. Get
[1:08:51] down on your knees. And then you know
[1:08:53] what? You will have the victory over
[1:08:55] them. You will have the victory over
[1:08:57] that power of darkness that has put you
[1:08:59] in
[1:09:00] bondage,
[1:09:02] suffering because of your ill will,
[1:09:04] because of of you being offended.
[1:09:08] I promise you, you will have peace and
[1:09:12] you will have the joy of Jesus Christ.
[1:09:15] And it's all built on love.
[1:09:18] It is, it is just love is everything.
[1:09:23] You can get past anything. You won't
[1:09:26] ever be offended if you love that
[1:09:27] person.
[1:09:29] And the best advice I can give, if you
[1:09:32] say, "Well, brother Daniel, I can't do
[1:09:34] it. I'm just angry. I get upset at this
[1:09:37] person did this this this did this and
[1:09:39] wrong this to me wrong get on your
[1:09:43] knees earnestly go before the Lord and
[1:09:46] pray for that person don't pray Lord
[1:09:48] open their eyes don't pray Lord Lord
[1:09:51] make let them make it right with me pray
[1:09:54] Lord have your way in their life Lord
[1:09:58] may your hand be upon them Lord bless
[1:10:01] them may they get closer to you and then
[1:10:04] put that other person
[1:10:06] in front of you just as Jesus Christ put
[1:10:09] you in front of him
[1:10:13] and we are commanded to do the same. How
[1:10:17] many a couple have have asked to be
[1:10:20] baptized? How many want to be baptized
[1:10:22] this morning? We have one Elijah.
[1:10:25] Anybody else? Melissa, you want to? God
[1:10:28] bless you. Anyone else? We have two.
[1:10:33] Okay, let's let me spend just a couple
[1:10:36] minutes on let's go back a chapter to
[1:10:41] Colossians chapter
[1:10:44] 2 verse number nine. Colossians
[1:10:49] 2:9 for in him all the fullness of in
[1:10:54] him dwelleth all the fullness of the
[1:10:56] godhead bodily talking about the Lord
[1:10:58] Jesus. So,
[1:11:00] three, a little bit of review. Three
[1:11:03] independent manifestations of God in the
[1:11:05] Trinity. That doesn't make sense right
[1:11:08] here because it said it it says it is
[1:11:10] all in this one.
[1:11:13] This one Jesus Christ. All of God dwells
[1:11:16] in Jesus
[1:11:18] Christ. And you are complete in him
[1:11:21] which is the head of all principality
[1:11:23] and power. In whom also you are
[1:11:25] circumcised with the circumcision made
[1:11:28] without hands. in putting off the body
[1:11:30] of the sins of the flesh by the
[1:11:32] circumcision of Christ. Uh the the
[1:11:34] worship team can come
[1:11:37] up putting off the body of sins of the
[1:11:41] flesh by circumcision of
[1:11:44] Christ. Remember it's not a book of
[1:11:47] rules you can do. It doesn't say that
[1:11:50] you can do this and you can't do that.
[1:11:52] You are circumcised. The excess skin is
[1:11:55] cut off by spiritual circumcision of
[1:11:59] from Jesus Christ. So he's saying the
[1:12:01] spirit of Christ dwells inside of you
[1:12:04] leading you every moment. So rules and
[1:12:07] laws are actually
[1:12:09] inferior. And that's what the Apostle
[1:12:11] Paul taught throughout his books. That
[1:12:13] the way that it used to be is inferior.
[1:12:16] Because now the same spirit that moved
[1:12:19] in the prophets of old to write the Old
[1:12:22] Testament, that same spirit now is
[1:12:24] inside of
[1:12:26] you. Telling you, do this, don't do
[1:12:32] that. Buried with him in baptism.
[1:12:36] So he's saying we're buried with Christ
[1:12:37] in baptism wherein also you are risen
[1:12:41] with him through the faith of the
[1:12:44] operation of God who hath raised him
[1:12:46] from the dead. So the same God that
[1:12:48] raised Jesus from the dead is the same
[1:12:51] God that's operating in you wanting that
[1:12:55] desire in your heart to be
[1:12:57] baptized. Listen, it's the same
[1:13:00] God that wrote the
[1:13:03] Bible, Elijah. It's the same God that
[1:13:06] inspired the prophet way and being then
[1:13:10] being brought back up a new person and
[1:13:13] you're making this
[1:13:14] commitment to change. You're making this
[1:13:18] commitment to do things different. You
[1:13:20] put off the old sinful person and you
[1:13:24] make a decision to serve God. And then
[1:13:26] he takes that decision and he quickens
[1:13:28] it. He makes it alive
[1:13:31] and he he has forgiven you of your sins
[1:13:36] through the blood. God has forgiven you
[1:13:39] his sins, your sins through the blood of
[1:13:42] Jesus
[1:13:43] Christ. And you are
[1:13:45] saying, I'm being baptized in the name
[1:13:48] of Jesus Christ because I believe him. I
[1:13:51] want a change in my life. I am now
[1:13:54] becoming a Christian. I'm not being
[1:13:56] baptized in the Tucson
[1:13:59] Tabernacle. I'm being baptized into
[1:14:02] Jesus Christ. That's why it's there's a
[1:14:04] name associated with it. That name, I
[1:14:07] read it. All the fullness of God dwells
[1:14:12] in that
[1:14:13] man. And that's why we take on that name
[1:14:16] of the Lord Jesus. Amen. You with me?
[1:14:20] You understand?
[1:14:21] Melissa Elijah, you understand? Okay.
[1:14:25] And anyone else who wants to be
[1:14:26] baptized, go back
[1:14:28] um Sister Rachel or Thank you. Um go
[1:14:31] back and meet uh the deacons back there
[1:14:34] and Sister Rachel and they will show you
[1:14:36] where where to go to be baptized.
[1:14:42] Brothers and
[1:14:43] sisters, this book of
[1:14:48] Colossians, it's written to a group of
[1:14:52] people to tell them here is what being a
[1:14:56] Christian
[1:14:57] means. And he goes from the start, he
[1:15:00] says basically this man Jesus is
[1:15:03] God. And then he goes and he says, now
[1:15:06] it's not about your works. It's not
[1:15:08] about what you can do. It's not about
[1:15:09] just pleasing yourself. It's not about
[1:15:12] following a rule and it's not about
[1:15:15] beating yourself up and making yourself
[1:15:17] sad because you don't want to ever
[1:15:20] experience any joy. It's not about that
[1:15:23] either. It is about a personal
[1:15:26] relationship, understanding and knowing
[1:15:29] this man,
[1:15:31] Christ. That's what the book of
[1:15:33] Colossians is about. And I don't know if
[1:15:36] we're ever going to finish. I only got
[1:15:38] through I don't know 10 more verses.
[1:15:41] There's only four chapters in the book.
[1:15:43] So, we'll continue on. If the Lord's
[1:15:45] willing, we'll continue on with this.
[1:15:47] But continue on studying this book. It
[1:15:50] is deep and it is good. It's got sin and
[1:15:55] it's got salvation and and it's got
[1:15:57] legalism and it's got it's got just just
[1:16:00] being serving yourself and not having
[1:16:02] any type of control over your life.
[1:16:05] That's not right either. You want to be
[1:16:07] a You want to be a
[1:16:09] prisoner to Jesus
[1:16:12] Christ. Lord, I want to be the person
[1:16:16] that you completely
[1:16:19] dominate. I want to forgive people as
[1:16:22] you forgave me. I want to love people as
[1:16:25] you loved me because that's what being a
[1:16:27] Christian is. And if you can't do it, I
[1:16:30] don't care if you were born in the
[1:16:33] message. It doesn't matter if you can't
[1:16:37] do it. You are just as much a sinner as
[1:16:40] the prostitute or the drug addict on the
[1:16:44] street. It's very the those
[1:16:48] Pharisees, they lived very very clean
[1:16:52] lives. Let me tell you
[1:16:54] something. Very few of
[1:16:57] them were
[1:16:58] saved. But then you have a Mary
[1:17:00] Magdalene.
[1:17:03] Today we have drug dealers and and
[1:17:06] criminals and and whatever sin there is
[1:17:09] coming to the Lord Jesus and changing
[1:17:11] their lives. And then you have people
[1:17:13] legalist that could never see any
[1:17:16] difference in anything. And that I am
[1:17:18] right no matter what the guy that's
[1:17:20] preaching to you right
[1:17:22] now. And I had to come to the same God,
[1:17:24] brother Manning, that you did.
[1:17:27] I had to bow down myself to the same
[1:17:29] one. And you know what? He saved us both
[1:17:32] the same. Praise God for for what he's
[1:17:36] done for us. I'm going to go up and
[1:17:39] baptize and again tonight. I'm not sure
[1:17:42] what
[1:17:44] um what we'll do. I might minister we're
[1:17:48] going to baptize tonight again. So,
[1:17:50] we'll we'll have more at least one more
[1:17:52] baptism tonight. And uh I might just
[1:17:56] teach a another short lesson again.
[1:18:00] Please come out and uh we'll put off our
[1:18:02] worship and singing service until next
[1:18:10] week. Jesus is awesome.
[1:18:13] He really is.
[1:18:17] and this
[1:18:19] Colossians and how that same
[1:18:23] Christ that all things were created by
[1:18:25] him and for
[1:18:27] him that is the same one that's sending
[1:18:31] those two young people up to this
[1:18:34] balcony to be
[1:18:35] baptized. It's the same one. Can you
[1:18:39] believe
[1:18:40] it? That he's still working today? that
[1:18:43] he still loves
[1:18:45] us. And then he said, "Now
[1:18:49] you love each other as I've loved you.
[1:18:54] You care about each other's well-being
[1:18:56] as much as I care about your
[1:18:58] well-being."
[1:19:00] Basically, you
[1:19:03] do what I
[1:19:05] do. Only he can
[1:19:08] save. But I can show you one that saves.
[1:19:12] I can lead you to that man. I can't do
[1:19:14] it, but I can sure bring you to him. God
[1:19:17] bless you.
[1:19:21] Words fall
[1:19:23] [Music]
[1:19:25] short. I've got nothing
[1:19:30] new. How could I
[1:19:35] express all my gratitude?
[1:19:41] I could sing these
[1:19:45] songs as I often
[1:19:51] do. Every song must
[1:19:56] end and you never
[1:20:02] do. So I throw up my hands and praise
[1:20:07] you again and again.
[1:20:10] Cuz all that I have is a
[1:20:16] [Music]
[1:20:18] hallelujah.
[1:20:22] Hallelujah. And I know it's not much,
[1:20:26] but I've nothing else fit for a
[1:20:30] king except for a heart singing hallelu.
[1:20:37] [Music]
[1:20:47] Hallelujah. I've got one
[1:20:52] response. I've got just one
[1:20:56] move with my arms stretched
[1:21:01] wide. I will worship you.
[1:21:07] So I throw up my hands and praise you
[1:21:12] again and
[1:21:15] again. Cuz all that I have is a
[1:21:18] [Music]
[1:21:22] hallelujah. A hallelu.
[1:21:25] [Music]
[1:21:27] And I know it's not much, but I've
[1:21:30] nothing else fit for a
[1:21:34] king except for a heart singing
[1:21:42] hallelujah.
[1:21:47] [Music]
[1:21:51] Hallelujah. Oh, and come on my soul. Oh,
[1:21:55] don't you get shy on me. Lift up your
[1:21:58] song cuz you've got a lion inside of
[1:22:03] those lungs. Get up there and praise the
[1:22:10] Lord. Oh, and call on my soul. Oh, don't
[1:22:15] you get shy on me. Lift up your soul.
[1:22:19] Cuz you got a lion inside of those
[1:22:23] lungs. Get up there and praise the
[1:22:29] Lord. Oh, hey, come on, my soul. Oh,
[1:22:34] don't you get shy on me. Lift up your
[1:22:37] soul cuz you've got a lion inside of
[1:22:42] those walls. Get up there and praise the
[1:22:46] Lord.
[1:22:49] God bless you,
[1:22:50] friends. I've been watching this young
[1:22:52] lady since soon after I became pastor of
[1:22:56] this
[1:22:57] church,
[1:23:00] and this really blesses my heart to see
[1:23:04] her. She's
[1:23:07] intelligent. She's going to the
[1:23:09] university. She's studying belief
[1:23:11] psychology. And she's um she's going to
[1:23:14] do well in whatever she does.
[1:23:17] But Melissa, I pray that you do well at
[1:23:20] being a Christian. That's going to be
[1:23:23] the most important thing that you ever
[1:23:24] do in life. And this is a wonderful,
[1:23:27] wonderful thing that you're doing here.
[1:23:30] You have something you want to say?
[1:23:33] I'm just really happy to be doing this
[1:23:35] right now.
[1:23:37] Amen.
[1:24:09] Melissa, by your own confession. By your
[1:24:12] own desire, I baptize you in the name of
[1:24:15] the Lord Jesus
[1:24:19] [Applause]
[1:24:29] Christ. I feel good. I feel good. I just
[1:24:35] Lord, I thank you so much. Thank you so
[1:24:38] much that these two young people that
[1:24:41] there's a desire in their heart to serve
[1:24:43] God. It
[1:24:45] just there's so many other things that
[1:24:47] they could be doing on this Sunday
[1:24:49] morning and they chose to come here and
[1:24:52] give their hearts to Jesus Christ.
[1:24:54] Elijah, come on down.
[1:24:57] I've known Elijah's
[1:25:00] dad for a while and Heath and he's he's
[1:25:04] been a friend of mine for for many years
[1:25:08] and Elijah to see you coming here in
[1:25:10] these waters of baptism saying I want to
[1:25:12] serve God. This is the most important
[1:25:15] thing that you could ever do. You're
[1:25:17] making this choice to give your heart to
[1:25:20] the Lord Jesus to be baptized and take
[1:25:22] on his name. Do you have anything you
[1:25:24] want to say? I just feel blessed that
[1:25:28] that I get you to baptize me. I feel uh
[1:25:33] and to get baptized in the right
[1:25:35] church. Amen. This church is dedicated
[1:25:39] to one
[1:25:41] man and that was the man that died for
[1:25:43] our sins.
[1:25:45] There's been great men that have come
[1:25:47] through this church, wonderful servants
[1:25:50] of
[1:25:51] God, pointing us to the same Jesus
[1:25:56] Christ that we are pointing to right
[1:25:58] now.
[1:26:00] And with Elijah, he's he's making this
[1:26:03] choice to take on that name of Jesus.
[1:26:06] You're blessed to be here. It's not the
[1:26:08] church. It's not the water. It's the
[1:26:11] spirit that's with us.
[1:26:22] Elijah, by your own confession, I
[1:26:25] baptize you in the name of the Lord
[1:26:28] Jesus Christ.
[1:26:32] [Applause]
[1:26:41] Praise God. And if the Lord's willing,
[1:26:44] we're going to baptize again
[1:26:46] tonight. This is this is what we're here
[1:26:49] for is to see people coming to the Lord
[1:26:53] Jesus and saying, "I want to make a
[1:26:54] change in my life." Just as the
[1:26:56] Colossians, they wanted to make a
[1:26:58] change. This man um the pastor of the
[1:27:01] church came to Paul. He says, "How can
[1:27:02] we do this better? Would you have
[1:27:04] anything?" And he even talks about
[1:27:06] baptism. He says, "Put off the old sin.
[1:27:09] Put on the the new life. Put on being a
[1:27:11] Christian. be baptized and then friends,
[1:27:14] all is going to be well. Amen. Let's all
[1:27:17] stand. Daniel, if you could lead a song.
[1:27:20] Brother Aaron, if you could close in
[1:27:21] prayer, my brother. God bless you,
[1:27:23] brothers and sisters. I pray that the
[1:27:25] Lord give you a good day and come back
[1:27:27] tonight. God bless
[1:27:29] [Music]
[1:27:30] you. In peace of God, cover
[1:27:37] me. Cover me.
[1:27:42] Cover
[1:27:46] me. Peace of God. Cover
[1:27:52] me. And through the
[1:27:57] storm. Cover
[1:28:01] me. And only in
[1:28:04] you I am saved.
[1:28:09] And only in you I'm
[1:28:13] [Music]
[1:28:15] secure. And only in you I find peace. So
[1:28:22] cover
[1:28:25] me. Cover
[1:28:28] me. Cover me when I am hurt. Cover me
[1:28:34] when I am not strong. Cover me when I am
[1:28:39] going through the
[1:28:42] storm. Cover me when all seems hopeless.
[1:28:47] Cover me when my faith is gone. With the
[1:28:50] peace that passes all I
[1:28:55] understand. Cover
[1:28:59] me. Cover me.
[1:29:05] Let's bow our
[1:29:07] heads. Lord, it's been a privilege to
[1:29:10] witness two more souls give themselves
[1:29:13] to you.
[1:29:14] Lord, you're not surprised by this. You
[1:29:17] knew this day was
[1:29:18] coming. And before this day would came,
[1:29:21] you made a way. You gave your own life
[1:29:23] for us,
[1:29:25] Lord. Today, Lord, starts a new phase in
[1:29:28] their life because now all hell turns
[1:29:30] against them. And that's why we're here
[1:29:33] for one another. We put our arms, we
[1:29:36] make a circle around each other. We pray
[1:29:40] for one another. We love one another. We
[1:29:43] encourage one another.
[1:29:45] Lord, these words that Paul had written
[1:29:48] down in the scriptures, Lord, they were
[1:29:50] inspiration that you
[1:29:52] gave. And after Paul gave his heart to
[1:29:55] you, Lord, he was a changed man.
[1:29:59] He realized this very law that he
[1:30:01] depended on. You were the fulfillment of
[1:30:03] it. And the greatest way to live this
[1:30:05] law was to have Christ in us. Then it's
[1:30:10] not a job. It's not a requirement. It's
[1:30:12] just a yielding to you. Lord, help us to
[1:30:15] take what we've heard today and apply it
[1:30:18] in our
[1:30:19] lives. And Lord, when we say we're
[1:30:21] Christians, we put ourselves to the
[1:30:23] test.
[1:30:24] But you said, "Greater is he that is in
[1:30:26] you than he that is in the world, Lord."
[1:30:29] So would you go with each one? Would you
[1:30:30] bless them, Lord?
[1:30:32] May May they trust in you, Lord. You
[1:30:35] never fail, Lord. Lord willing. We
[1:30:38] gather again this afternoon, Lord. And
[1:30:41] may we continue to worship you and love
[1:30:43] you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. God
[1:30:47] bless you as you go.
[1:30:51] And
[1:30:52] I was a
[1:30:54] wretch. I remember who I
[1:30:58] was. I was lost. I was blind. I was
[1:31:04] running out of
[1:31:06] time. And
[1:31:08] sin
[1:31:10] separated. The breach was far too wide.
[1:31:15] From the far side of the
[1:31:18] chasm, you held me in your
[1:31:22] sight. So
[1:31:23] you made a
[1:31:25] way across the great
[1:31:29] divine. Left
[1:31:31] behind heaven's
[1:31:33] throne to build it here
[1:31:37] inside. And there at the
[1:31:40] cross, you paid the debt I owe.
[1:31:45] broke my chains, freed my soul. For the
[1:31:49] first time I had
[1:31:51] hope. So thank you Jesus for the blood
[1:31:59] applied. And thank you Jesus. It has
[1:32:04] washed me
[1:32:06] white. And thank you Jesus saved my
[1:32:12] life.
[1:32:13] [Music]
[1:32:15] and brought me from the darkness into
[1:32:20] glorious
[1:32:21] [Music]
[1:32:23] light. And you took my place, laid
[1:32:28] inside my tomb, my
[1:32:30] sin. You were buried for three days, but
[1:32:35] then you walked right out again. And now
[1:32:39] death has no steam and life has no
[1:32:44] end. For I have been
[1:32:48] transformed by the blood of the
[1:32:51] lamb. So thank you Jesus for the blood
[1:32:58] applied. And thank you Jesus. It has
[1:33:03] washed me white.
[1:33:06] And thank you Jesus. You have saved my
[1:33:14] life and brought me from the darkness
[1:33:18] into
[1:33:19] glorious
[1:33:23] light. And there is nothing stronger
[1:33:27] than the
[1:33:28] wonderworking power of the blood.
[1:33:34] The
[1:33:36] blood that calls us sons and daughters.
[1:33:40] We are ransomed by our fathers through
[1:33:44] the
[1:33:46] blood. The
[1:33:50] blood. Oh, there is nothing stronger
[1:33:54] than the
[1:33:55] wonderworking power of the blood.
[1:34:01] The
[1:34:03] blood that calls the sons and daughters.
[1:34:07] We are ransomed by our father through
[1:34:11] the
[1:34:13] blood. The
[1:34:17] blood. And thank you Jesus for the blood
[1:34:24] applied. And thank you Jesus. It has
[1:34:29] washed me
[1:34:31] white. And thank you Jesus. You have
[1:34:36] saved my
[1:34:40] life. You brought me from the darkness
[1:34:44] into
[1:34:46] glorious light.
[1:34:49] [Music]
[1:34:58] [Music]
[1:35:10] I am thine, oh Lord. I have heard thy
[1:35:17] voice and it
[1:35:20] told love to
[1:35:24] me. But I long to rise in the arms of
[1:35:32] faith and be
[1:35:34] closer drawn to thee.
[1:35:39] Draw me
[1:35:43] nearer, nearer,
[1:35:45] blessing to the cross where thou hast
[1:35:52] died. Draw me
[1:35:56] nearer and nearer, blessed
[1:36:01] Lord to thy
[1:36:04] preious
[1:36:06] leading son.
[1:36:10] Consecrate me now to thy
[1:36:15] service, Lord, by the power of grace
[1:36:22] divine. Let my soul look up with a
[1:36:28] steadfast hope and my will be lost and
[1:36:34] done.
[1:36:36] Draw me
[1:36:39] nearer and nearer, blessed one, to the
[1:36:44] cross where thou hast
[1:36:49] died. Draw me
[1:36:53] nearer and nearer, blessed
[1:36:57] Lord, to thy
[1:37:00] preious
[1:37:02] bleeding sight. God bless you. your
[1:37:04] dismiss. Oh, the pure
[1:37:08] delight of a
[1:37:10] single hour that before thy throne I
[1:37:18] speak. When I kneel in prayer and with
[1:37:23] thee, my God, I commune as friend with
[1:37:30] friend.
[1:37:32] Draw me
[1:37:35] nearer and nearer, blessed Lord, to the
[1:37:40] cross where thou hast
[1:37:44] died. Draw me
[1:37:49] nearer, nearer, blessed
[1:37:53] Lord, to thy
[1:37:56] preious
[1:37:57] leading
[1:37:59] side. And there are depths of love that
[1:38:04] I cannot know till the cross the narrow
[1:38:13] sea. There are heights of joy that I may
[1:38:19] not reach till I rest in peace with
[1:38:24] thee.
[1:38:27] Draw me
[1:38:29] nearer and nearer
[1:38:32] precious to the cross where thou hast
[1:38:39] died. Draw me
[1:38:43] nearer, nearer. Bless
