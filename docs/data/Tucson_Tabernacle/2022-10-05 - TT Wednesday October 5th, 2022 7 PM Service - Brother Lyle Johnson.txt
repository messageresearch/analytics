Earthly [Music] almost [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and when the flesh directions [Music] my cross went heavy to make my dreams [Music] Whispers is promised and never leave me alone know whatever [Music] to me now [Music] alone [Music] [Applause] amen you may be seated I was getting a little winded there at the end so every time we sing that song I think of sister Beauty she'd sit down right where brother Dan is there and they would brother Neil would say does anybody have a song and sister Billy would say no never alone I think she'd still have the same testimony she ever came by but half Shafter and introduce herself as a young lady to us and she would say I'm sister Beauty and no he never left me alone amen what a promise we have it'll testimony to share and I I don't know if everybody knew the details but when my sister-in-law Elizabeth was she got shingles and she was in quite a bit of pain and and suffering she went in for some um some testing exams and they told her that she's a good possibility she had MS so it's we've been praying believing and she was back with the doctor the other day and doctor said no you don't have MS you just have some lingering pain so thank the Lord for that you know and brother Brown says when you go to the doctor you go you listen to the doctor you do what they say why go otherwise you know and a good doctor has the best intentions and a good doctor knows that they can't heal you but you know you you you eat right you do the things that are right to do but there's one who said I'll never leave you alone I've got it everything I covered when he said it is finished he knew it was all covered so we appreciate them and sometimes we get a little bit a little bit nervous a little bit worried maybe we're like I've just recently changed a doctor and they're trying to get everything moved over and I get anxious and I get nervous and and then God reminds me he says I've got it all taken care of it's okay brother Jordan mentioned that brother Russell Wallace was driving and his car got hit by a lightning while he was driving the car was ruined but brother Wallace is still fine so sometimes we'll look at our possessions and say oh my look at this in him and I heard you met somebody by accident the other day sister Lily got rear-ended somebody wasn't paying attention but God watches over us you know and he is God you know and I you just have to say Lord I'm trusting in you and I'm believing in you sometimes we might look at our our life and the way things are going and wondering why Lord why [Music] but when you get to thinking about that just say you know maybe you're testing me like Joe because you said have you considered my servant job there's none like him and Satan says then give me a shot at him and God says go because I know they love me and they'll trust in me so thank the Lord for them Lord you are so precious to me I had to write it down so I could remember what song it is because I can never remember [Music] Lord you are so precious [Music] to me and I love you yes I love foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] universe tell it to him one more one more time oh Lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] you are so precious to me [Music] yes I love of you and us [Music] love me and I love I love you yes I love you and Lord [Music] peace of God cover me as we're driving down the road and looking towards a church coming in looked like the storm was right over here as you get closer it kind of moves away and are we going to make it without getting wet kind of our concern you know and are the people going to be able to come but God just says I'm still in control let your peace cover me oh cover me [Music] through the storms [Music] for you only in you I find peace covered cover me when I am hurting you cover me when I'm not strong cover me when I am going to the storm [Music] cover me where faces peace that passes all I under understand cover me [Music] cover me whatever that is it might be in your life right now going on say Lord cover it with your peace with your Assurance of God cover me till the storm s for it's only in you I am sad and you knew I'm secure only in you I find peace so cover me cover me cover me when I am hurting cover me when I'm not strong cover me when I am going to storm maybe when my faith is gone let the peace that passes all I understand cover me cover me sometimes God allows to go through some things just to let us know and remind us so we can have that testimony that he is my peace he's broken down every wall he sat as my satisfying portion he's everything to us so peace peace wonderful peace let's stand as as brother Lyle prepares to come to the side we sing how many know that peace of God how many deserve the peace of God and we put our hand no I don't but how many has God given you peace and how many would say thank you Lord for that peace peace his wings [Music] wonderful me coming down from the father sweep over my spirit forever I pray the first verse brother Jordan far away am the depths of my spirit Rose [Music] himself still like strangers the heart my soul like an infinite calm oh please oh Wonder ful mother of all sweep over my spirit forever I pray in five a must of love once more peace wonderful peace calming down from the father sweet [Applause] [Music] over my spirit forever I pray in Father must below [Music] thank you to have that peace tonight if you don't we have access to that peace it's once again our joy to be gathered in his name to worship and appreciate and love him and to hear from him did you come tonight expecting to hear from the Lord Jesus I came tonight expecting to hear from the Lord Jesus let's approach him one more time before we open our Bibles Lord Jesus it is such an awesome privilege Lord in this 21st century Lord in a world that's in turmoil with threats of nuclear activity and things going on Lord that that we could not have foreseen or predicted even just a year ago but Lord we see these things going on around us Lord but our peace our safety is in you Lord we ask that you be with us this evening help me to be out of the way Lord to just be a channel for your words for your thoughts to reach out Lord to to touch hearts Lord to comfort Souls Lord to give peace and strength and encouragement Lord in these Troublesome times Lord we commit the remainder of this service to you we trust you we thank you in Jesus precious name amen you probably are all aware that today was Yom Kippur it's uh the day of atonement the most holy day on the Jewish calendar a day of introspection a day where where people think about where they are where they're going how they're living seeking the Lord's forgiveness and the repentance and then in the time of the Bible this was the day that the high priest made absolutely certain that everything was perfect before you went into the holy of holies because if he did one thing wrong he wouldn't come out they'd have to pull him out it was a very sober time a very serious time but the work the people's job was to repent and to approach the Lord but the burden fell on the high priest the burden fell on the high priest we have our high priest he doesn't make mistakes the burden has fallen on him he paid the price at Calvary we talked about that a few weeks ago about Jesus as a Passover Lamb but this is The Fall season now well last Wednesday when we met we discussed the Feast of trumpets tied in the two silver trumpets of Moses and some of the uses of trumpets in the Bible we noted that the Feast of trumpets was the only feast day that was uncertain because it fell on the first of the month the new moon when it was dark you knew approximately but you didn't know precisely when it was going to be until it was as Christians this suggests the Lord's return the resurrection of the Dead in Christ called to be his bride the catching away what we term the rapture of the elect prior to the period we speak of as the Great Tribulation the subject I have on my heart to share with you this evening is that of the rapture you might think of it as Feast of trumpets part two and and like Yom Kippur our job is to repent and be ready but our high priest does all the work please open your Bibles to First Corinthians chapter 15. and we'll start reading at the 50th verse appalled has spent this entire chapter addressing the certainty of the resurrection of Christ and the resultant inevitability of the Resurrection of the believer now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither death corruption inherit incorruption behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed sounds like a promise to me in a moment and the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound the dead in Christ shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptable must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptable shall have put on in corruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory Paul's quoting Isaiah 25 8 for you taking notes which means he will swallow up death and victory and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the Earth for the Lord hath spoken it death is swallowed up in Victory oh death where's thy sting grave where's thy victory The Sting of death is sin the strength of the sin is the law but thanks be to God which givesth US gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ are you sharing in that victory tonight it's yours to possess therefore Paul says in light of all this my beloved Brethren my beloved siblings this is not a male pronoun in the Greek be ye steadfast brother leonhardt used to say I'm not stubborn brother Lyle I'm steadfast be steadfast be unmovable always how frequently when we feel like it no we should constantly always be abounding plentiful not tiny or smaller miserly but abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord in fact it has great value please be seated Paul is writing now to believers he's writing to members of the body of Christ Paul states that at some point in the future there will be a resurrection and the living at that time will be changed possessing the same Incorruptible bodies as the Resurrected this is the component of the event that we call the rapture in her news item I read this past week there was something called Rapture anxiety it's experienced by by some people who believe in the soon appearing of Christ Christian believers who accept the Bible as literal truth but some of them are in fear that they'll miss the rapture I saw this article and it brought back memories of my early teens ages 12 through maybe 14 or 15. this was a period of my life that was very unsettled and the world around us there was a Cuban Missile Crisis the Cold War was full steam ahead uh but but in my personal life my older brother joined the Air Force my best friend since the second or third grade moved away we left the church we'd been attending since I was five or six years old and started going to a much more formal Church a Lutheran Church miles from home where I knew absolutely no one my parents who had a Baptist background had become aware of the Pentecostal movement we'd all been prayed for to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit prophecies were being spoken healings in some cases miraculous healings were occurring there were tongues there was interpretation there was a feeling that imminent destruction was expected the Rapture could occur at any moment my parents were going to various prayer meetings and teachings many of those evenings I was home alone I was left behind I was convinced that I was the Lord's but I also knew that I harbored thoughts that I shouldn't did things that I knew better than to do the body changed I was going through at that age wasn't the one Paul refers to in the scripture but it was real nonetheless if my parents said the meeting was going to end at 8 30 and they'd be home by nine o'clock I started worrying at 901. they didn't show up by 9 15 I was certain I had missed the rapture and was doomed to go through the tribulation period without my parents without my family without those I loved those that I needed I'd be facing it alone I'd go to my room in tears praying asking God why he hadn't taken me to seeking his forgiveness frankly I was often terrified that's not what the Rapture is about so tonight let's talk a bit about this event that we call the rapture my prayer is that for any of you who may be anxious about it you'll be comforted reassured at peace and ready the rapture the catching away of the living faithful does it matter when it happens can we know ahead of time why do people keep trying to figure it out what difference would it make if they could or did what signs should we be looking for if any earthquakes Wars what and ultimately how do we prepare what is our role we'll be reading a lot of scripture this evening a few excerpts from Brother brannon's recorded messages and a short bit from the church age book the disciples asked Jesus about signs of his coming when it would happen about the destruction of Jerusalem that Jesus had just told them would occur in Matthew 24 we read this starting in verse 4. so the disciples asked his questions and Jesus answered and said unto them first thing he said take heed that no man deceive you they'll try be careful be wary don't fall for them many shall come in my name saying I am Christ that is I have the anointing I have the Revelation for you from God you need to listen to me and shall deceive many they'll be successful on their deceptions this is part of the reason Paul admonishes Timothy to study to be able to rightly divide the word of Truth he goes on you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet so Wars fighting amongst Empires Nations territories or even just reports of such activity aren't really signs they're human activities are far too normal and they're largely evil he goes on Nation will rise against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom and not only that but there'll be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places what Jesus is saying here is that people will be people they'll be fighting amongst quarreling with and killing each other Cain and Abel was the opening round we still see it today in Ukraine and many other places and we know it's root sin even before there were laws defining it God told Cain that sin was already there and that he must overcome it or he would be consumed by it weather events lead to crop failures and famines we read of many famines in the Bible from Genesis onwards we hear of food crises today all sorts of diseases and pandemics Spanish Flu just after World War One coveted the last couple of years AIDS Ebola these in our time and centuries past the plague every several hundred years would decimate populations if the plague hit Tucson like it did in England in the 1300s 50 percent of the city would be dead within 48 hours that's how virulent the plague was we hear more and more of earthquakes but we also have eight billion people on the planet not a few hundred million to feel the effects we have instant Global Communications instruments of amazing sensitivity capturing Quakes we wouldn't even otherwise be aware of plate tectonics it's how the planet was built by the Creator in other words these signs are generally nothing new they've continued on and they will continue on Jesus says so they're not really signs in that traditional sense oh you might say well be careful there brother Lyle you're sounding a bit like a scoffer have you never read second Peter three well I I think I have but let's read it together Peter says knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation I'm not scoffing Peter goes on in that same passage to clarify not that the evidence being cited by the scoffers is necessarily incorrect but that they choose to be ignorant of God's purposes and his judgment they misinterpret and thus come to a wrong conclusion they reject the notion that there's a coming judgment rejecting that Christ is coming again where is the promise of his coming they ask after all he's as dead as our ancestors nothing's really changed Peter says for this they willingly are ignorant they choose to be ignorant of firstly creation and Judgment of the past that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished he's talking about the flood of course they reject that either this event happened or that it was judgment and another thing they're willingly ignorant of is that the same Creator is holding back judgment which will at the appropriate time be Unleashed Peter goes on in verse 7 but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word in the beginning was the word are kept in store reserved set aside unto another flood no reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and Perdition that word perdition means destruction the day of just of judgment and destruction of ungodly means impious Wicked irreverent men no scoffer here I'm emphatically saying he is returning I believe it's close but I'm also saying it's just as I believe Jesus did that these things that people point to is signs aren't signs in terms of precise timing we're to be people of faith not Seekers after science recall that trumpets which is the first fall feast day in which points to the return of Christ is uncertain in its timing it begins in and arises from Darkness the new moon Peter referenced destruction by water let's see what Jesus said about that continuing in Matthew 24 dropping down to verse 36. Jesus says of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only he keeps repeating that we will not know when the return of the Lord will happen until it happens he continues but as the days of Noah were so shall also the coming of the son of man be hmm he gives an example that they and we are familiar with he says for as in the days that were before the flood before that destruction before that judgment they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage life went on normal routine nothing out of the ordinary except that crazy guy building a huge Wooden Boat talking about judgment and destruction because of how we live our evil imaginations always partying but notice what's missing in this description worship recognition of God humility Genesis 6 5 tells us God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually as it was and the days of Noah it's largely what Peter pointed out about the ones he called scoffers what Paul told Timothy about heavy high-minded lovers of pleasure and so forth hey this is America we fly rainbow Flags immerse ourselves in Hollywood fantasies and deny that there is a God but so what get real hmm until the day that Noah entered into the ark and it was another eight days before anything happened they didn't realize that the door had been sealed shut it wasn't raining when the door was shut and sealed hey old man with the zoo how's it smell in there anyway mucking out a lot of stalls are you sure we it was pretty nice out here upwind um a new knot until the flood came and took them away so shall also the coming of the son of man be in other words Jesus said things will seem to be as they always were until they aren't and while we've had the witness we talked about last time of Israel and the seventh Messenger to the churches to let us know it's near we can't be certain just how near when he comes it will be sudden how sudden verse 40 then shall two be in the field one shall be taken the other left two women shall be grinding at the Mill one shall be taken and the other left well look what Jesus says next watch therefore ye know not what hour your lord doth come and he isn't talking about your watch your GPS type keeping or a sundial don't get hung up on the word hour but know this he says here's something you can and should know you don't know when I'm coming but know this if the Goodman if the owner of the house had known in what watch which period of the night the thief would come he would have watched he would have been alert would not have suffered his house to be broken up therefore he says similarly be ye also ready stay alert remain alert for in such an hour as you think not he's talking to his disciples in such an hour as you think not when you least expect it the son of man is coming I will return here's another illustration Jesus goes on who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household to give the members of the household food in due season understanding all this how should you act blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he comes arriving unexpectedly shall find so doing going about his business verily I say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his Goods Jesus goes on he contrasts that faithful servant with another kind but if that evil servant shall say in his heart my Lord delays his coming where is the promise of his coming the scoffers say hey maybe got caught up in some business or others not coming back I I'll know when he's on the road home I'm sure he'll signal ahead and shall begin to Smite his fellow servants to eat and drink with the drunken acts as if he has the authority meanwhile misbehaving abusing and mistreating others the Lord of that servant shall come in a day when he's not looking for him and an hour when he's not aware of he'll come he'll surprise him and shall kind of misunder that doesn't mean cut him in pieces slice and dice it's not talking about that it'll separate him from the Lord's House and a point in his portion with the hypocrites the actors make-believe insincere Pretenders fakes there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth not a pleasant time Jesus emphasizes over and over that he'll come when he's least expected and that we cannot know ahead of time exactly when that might be he uses terms like the day or the hour and acts 1 7 he says we won't even know the times of the seasons much of this is idiom it's expression he's not talking about calendar dates or Shadows on a sundial if we skip to Matthew 25 he goes on there to warn that even though he has said that we should be ever Vigilant always watchful some of us won't be some will be tired exhausted weary start at verse 1. then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which shook their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom they wanted their light to shine they prepared themselves made themselves ready let clean Christian lives and wanted to see Jesus when he comes five of them were wise and five of them were foolish unwise they that were foolish took their lamps took no oil with them we discover a few verses down they had a little oil in the lamp initially but they didn't have a jar or a container for extra so they didn't have enough they assumed they wouldn't need more than what they had in the lamps themselves but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps they had a vessel other than the lamp that held more oil in July Heather and I were in in England and we went to the British Museum and I took a photograph here of of these various oil lamps all of oil lamps most of them are from the first century from the Mediterranean area Roman you can see that olive oil lamps come in variety of sizes and shapes but most didn't hold much oil I just get it enough to get you through the night get your PJs on go to bed the light goes out right many of the lamps are Roman first century current and Jesus time on the bottom left down here you can see that for those of you that are old enough it looks a bit like a hot water bottle but it's a it's a container to carry extra oil to to fill the lamp so the wives had these vessels with them the ones that are called foolish did it or if they did they were empty took his time Terry they all eventually slumbered and slipped you couldn't distinguish one from the other and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go out to meet him and then all those virgins arose all ten heard the cry and trimmed their lamps and and the foolish said to the wise oops give us if your oil our lamps have gone out they must have previously been burning to have gone out but the oil was consumed as they slumbered and slept but the wise answered saying nope not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves there's oil available elsewhere go get some we just barely have enough for ourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom showed up and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage they that were ready and the door was shut as in the days of Noah God shut the door before judgment and destruction afterward also came the other virgin saying Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verily I say to you I I know you're not watch therefore Jesus says I've told you this story why because I want you to watch because you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh again the warning the uncertainty beforehand brother Branham talks about this Parable when asked about it in March 1963 in a recording titled questions and answers on the seals recall that sometimes he spoke about one in a million there were two that made it out of 2 million into the promised land there were eight that made it out of eight million in the days of Noah he talks about one in a million but remember he also said when he described his experience that he called beyond the curtain of time that there were Millions present just from this age questions and answers on the seals the question are the five wise versions of Matthew 25 attendance to the bride or are they the bride if these wise virgins are attendance to the bride where's the bride so the person is asking a question they're a little confused brother Brandon says see now to the best of my understanding these five virgins There Were Ten of them you know that went out see this is only a symbol or a parable see that I'm going to tell you see there were 10 of them of course there were more than ten this was just a made number but then the wise virgins had oil in their lamps the unwise did not have oil in their laps so if that tender of Matthew if this is a person's question if those tend there did that mean that there would be or these five that there would be just five see five people is is the bride just going to be five people is what they're asking brother random says no it doesn't mean that it's just a simple aversions you see of the Virgin that went out with oil on their lamp they're a portion of that bride in the church age book in the section on the sartigian church age we think of as the first fifth Church age under Luther it says it's a second Resurrection where in the five foolish virgins come up note they were virgins they did not have the Holy Spirit so they missed being in the bride while the five wives who had oil became part of that bride but these people being a separated god-loving people trying to abide in the word according to what they knew of it and being a help in the work of the Lord will come up at the end of time they'll miss the Millennium all these people had their names in The Book of Life and their names remained well the takeaway from this I think is that it is of utmost importance to receive the baptism of the holy spirit in our lives keep our vessels full our lights shining is there something else that we must do to prepare ourselves to be ready for the catching away do we have a role we'll go back to questions and answers on this heels excuse me I want to read this with you it's a little long but I think it's really important we live in a time of confusion being assaulted constantly with the influence of Satan's Eden tension in the world economic chaos it seems like it's descending everywhere but my brothers and sisters now more than ever we need to keep our eyes on Jesus laser focused on him we need to have oil in our lamps the infilling of the Holy Spirit and keep our lamps lit we need to find our place in the body of Christ and be present doing what he's called each one of us to do I'm getting ahead of myself let's read questions and answers on the seals the question is should evangelists continue on the field in this hour of course what they mean certainly by all means don't change a thing I I hope you hear this next sentence and are listening very very closely if that one sentence is all you get from tonight's service really sinking in and taking root it will have been worth coming he says if Jesus is coming in the morning preached today like if it was going to be 10 years from today but live like it's going to be this hour he goes on he says don't get scrupled up now don't get all confused and twisted around that's what I'm trying to warn you about see just don't be odd peculiar don't change nothing but if you're doing something wrong or doing evil repent see come back to God continue on your Evangelistic service just as you always did now remember this is in 1963 this is after the seals this is years after he talked about 1956. he says go on keep doing it he's telling us we can't sit back in our cocoons bring our hands and say it's too late for fill in the blank that's what the enemy wants us to do is to give up and he'll use scripture and quotes and what have you to get us to sit back and go to sleep to just let the world go by brother Branham says if you're building a house I don't see brother Amos Garcia here but I do see brother Peter put it on up Jesus comes tomorrow you be found faithful at that Duty If You're Building a Church go on put it up I'd rather be putting my money in something like that than be found with it in my pocket see so just keep on continue as you are everybody understand now continue right on just go on right on as you are now just don't stop don't do nothing just go right on just as you are keep on serving the lord brother Branham hits this point over and over and over now for instance if he was working for a man and you note it was 15 minutes before quitting time well you'd say it's just 15 minutes more might as well just go over and sit down next to the time clock be the first guy to punch out you could docked for that 15 minutes the first real job that I had was for an aircraft company here in town and there were so many people that were doing this kind of thing that the guy that owned the company told the foreman first person that punches out tomorrow fire him on the spot they later set up a thing where 15 minutes before quitting time they'd blow a whistle so you could clean up your tools but if you were cleaning up 16 minutes before that whistle or 16 minutes before quitting you were in trouble okay if you're planting wheat plant your wheat if you're digging potatoes I I was originally thinking of entitling this sermon spuds but I thought that'd be a little confusing a little too cute he says if you're digging potatoes go on dig them out say well nobody will eat them don't make any difference dig them out anyhow see yeah just continue on As You Are I got a letter from somebody the other day somebody told them say well the time is at hand sell the farm you won't need the food you live off of on the farm because this Millennium is going to start you won't need it so just go ahead and while the tribulation period is going on you your children is not safe so let the children have a farm where they can eat off of it but sell your farm or something like that oh they had it I said oh my if I knowed he was coming tomorrow and I was a farmer I'd put in my crop today sure if he made me a farmer I'm gonna stay right at my duty that's right if he made me a mechanic somebody said the other day he said a fellow come in and said say brother you know what he said I'm going to give you the second set of keys I bought a new car he said I'm going to give you the second set of keys told his Pastor said I'm going to give you the second set of keys because the Rapture might come you know and said I won't be needing it anymore Pastor was going to miss it see oh that's making ready isn't it all right but that's the way it is see we mustn't be that way we must be a sane solid Christian see that I'm put here to work right up to the last minute I've got a job to do and I'll be right found faithful at the post of Duty if he comes this morning I want to be standing right here in the pulpit anybody here remember 1981 here in Tucson June 28th Sunday was when the Rapture was scheduled to take place according to a local Evangelist named Bill Maupin and his small group of followers I remember meeting Bill sometime back in 1970. a recent convert to Christ very enthusiastic person he'd learned to Divine Healing and at that time he was planning on going through every hospital in Tucson and emptying them that was the kind of person that he was that's what he related to me well in June 28 1981 approached his followers quit their jobs sold their houses and so forth they printed a 274-page guide for those left behind on what to do during the Great Tribulation when the Rapture didn't happen he recalculated the date to be August 7th 1981. when it didn't happen then he just said it would happen soon and that the date wasn't really very important anyway I saw lots of t-shirts back then mocking it all the legend and large letters that I survived the Rapture with people floating up in the sky and it had June 28th crossed out and it had August 7th crossed out some people at work were wearing those t-shirts and just making fun of the whole thing I ran across a blogger who saved newspaper clippings of those predictions and mistakes and that person wrote in in 2012 there have been a lot of raptures since then and whenever they've come along I thought of all Bill Maupin and these clippings in a way listen to this now this is what brother Brandon was pointing out in a way the non-event helped me become a skeptic help me understand how ridiculous religious people can be and how Shifty their Advocates are when they're proven wrong it didn't happen on October 22nd 1844 as the Miller rights predicted we know it didn't happen in 1975 or 77 or 81 or 2011 or any of the other dates put forward a few months ago a very sincere brother came to the Tabernacle later and asked the ministry team to meet with them he let out a year it would happen 2024 2026 I forgotten exactly based on an interpretation of the Book of Daniel another brother came to me and was certain it had to happen before mid-2028 and explained his reasoning nothing wrong with his reasoning I love and respect that brother but Jesus made it clear no one knows the day or the hour it'll happen when it happens trying to guess or figure out some date should not be our Focus will be wrong let's get back to what brother Branham said here you say brother Branham if he was to come this morning shouldn't you be out there no sir this is my poster Duty I'll be standing right here preaching now he's not making a prophecy that he'll be alive when Jesus comes and he'll be preaching in the Pulpit at Branham Tabernacle that's not the point that he's making he's illustrating I'll be standing right here preaching when he comes saying the same things I am then when he comes I'll just move right on out with him see if I'm hoeing potatoes I'll just be hoeing away just as hard as I can when he comes I'll just drop the hoe and take off remember in the Jubilee year if they was hoeing with a hoe they just kept on hoeing they know the Jubilee year was maybe 10 minutes more and the trumpet will sound at the Jubilee year they just kept on pitching hay whatever they was doing but when the trumpet sounded then they dropped the Pitchfork and gone see that's it just keep on pitching hay until the trumpet sounds all right there's a tremendous amount of very good advice there the final scripture selection from the New Testament I want to share this evening is found in first Thessalonians chapter 4 we're all familiar with it the context is Paul comforting those who are in mourning at the passing of a loved one without the Lord was coming and these person has died and and what's going on and are they going to go to hell because they miss the Rapture and Paul what's going on we're very concerned what's going on confusion despair survivor's guilt discouragement disillusionment questioning God's reliability his word all the emotions that one experiences at such times first Thessalonians 4 13. Paul says I would not have you to be ignorant to be uninformed to be unaware to be in darkness or confused concerning them which are asleep those that have passed away whose bodies have died because if you're not ignorant but informed the result is that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope we have hope faith is the substance of Our Hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again do we believe that two thousand years later do we believe that he's alive two thousand years after Paul penned these words to a group of grieving Believers in Thessaloniki do we believe that Jesus died for our sins that he rose on the third day that he's alive in October of 2022 that he's given us his holy spirit a portion of the very essence of the god that created the universe who transcends space and time that he loves us so much he paid that awful price on our behalf while we were yet ignorant if we believe that then even so them also would sleep in Jesus will God bring with him that sounds fantastic right so Paul goes on to explain the process by which it will occur for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord Paul says the same one who met me on the road to Damascus the same one that has given me the strength and power to preach his gospel with the same intensity with which I once persecuted it he told me that we Paul says we you say I hope to be a part of the living at his return but regardless we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent hinder stop delay interfere with them which are asleep the dead in Christ for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first brother Branham drawing on the time between Christ's resurrection and Ascension being 40 days believe that this phase of the Rapture the dead in Christ Rising would happen a minimum of 40 days before the catching away of the next verse then after the dead in Christ are resurrected and Incorruptible bodies we which are alive and remain shall be changed in a moment as Paul told us in our opening verses in First Corinthians 15. and we'll be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord we show we won't forever be in clouds will forever be with the Lord and Paul says you're grieving wherefore Comfort one another with these words don't fear if you pass away in Christ you're going to be there if you're alive and filled with the Holy Spirit called by God you're going to be there you are not going to miss it Jesus said all the father hath given me will come and I won't lose even one that's why Paul was sharing this revelation comfort and time of mourning if musicians would please come at this time there was another one it was in deep mourning in grief centuries earlier and this is what he wrote job 19 23. oh that my words were now written that that they were printed in a book that they were Graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock forever job wants his testimony and his faith recorded he wants people including his detractors and the Skeptics surrounding him to know where he stands where his confidence lies and he then declares that testimony his his statement of faith if you will for I hope no I think I suspect no Beyond any Shadow of Doubt I know that my redeemer My Redeemer my personal savior he's saying is this idea of a personal savior is not a new testament Christian thing this is going all the way back to ancient times job is talking about his personal savior his Redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth exactly what Jesus said exactly what the Angels told the disciples who witnessed Jesus Ascension said exactly what Paul wrote what Peter declared were not cunningly devised Fables job goes on and though after my skin worms destroy this body after my flesh is rotted decayed from my bones the insect larva have consumed my body and recycled my elements yet in my flesh shall I see God for this corruption will take on incorruption as how Paul expressed the same concept the same thing whom I shall see for myself Jesus expressed this concept to his disciples when he told them our friend Lazarus sleeps mine eyes Shall Behold and not another though my Reigns the concept is vital organs be consumed within me regardless of the Decay and even absence of My corruptable Flesh job said I will be there job had that confidence that faith that Revelation he wasn't looking for a rapture but a resurrection thousands of years later we're told that some will still be alive when the dead in Christ rise and in their then Incorruptible bodies each will behold along with job his Redeemer not just his Redeemer his savior the lover of our soul we may well be part of that generation but we should not let the awe of that possibility distract us from being about our father's business brother Branham said over and over just keep on what the Lord has called you to do keep doing it we're called to be the salt of the earth a Shining Light his Witnesses to be people of faith to keep hope in our potatoes let's pray together one more time Lord Jesus I pray that something has been said tonight that will help someone may be struggling someone may be questioning I don't know but you do Lord I pray that you'd reach down and for each one that's here Lord that has the holy spirit that you would give them that reassurance that they're not going to miss it they are going to make it you won't lose one if there's anyone here that hasn't received the Holy Spirit that you'd move in their heart and in their life in such a way that they would want it and they would reach out and not stop until they get it Lord I just commit these thoughts and this evening to you I thank you for your word I thank you for your presence I thank you for your profit I thank you for this congregation this church this this faithful group that stands together Lord in your name and we ask these things in your name [Music] as brother Aaron comes to conclude this evening's Gathering maybe we could sing Keep Your Eyes Upon Jesus that's where we need to have our Focus [Music] on wrong key Keep Your Eyes Upon Jesus look full in his wonderful faith foreign strangely [Music] [Music] in the light of his glory and grace and you know why I'm not a song leader brother Aaron Jesus [Music] afraid and the things of Earth will grow strangely dim in the lives one more time Turn Your Eyes Upon James [Music] I'm the things [Music] as I look out and I I see you know a lot of us have served the Lord maybe our whole lives we are raised in some seen Mom and Dad probably the oldest ones here today and I know Dad and Mom gave their hearts to the Lord as young people but you know the workers pay is the same in the 11th Hour the reward is the same you know that the thief on the side when Jesus say this day you'll be meet me in Paradise you know his stay in Paradise was really short While others have been in there for many years but it was the same it's the same pay for everyone to all that we will believe we were here in the meetings of 76 going into 77 this church was packed are you here man this church was packed there was there was no room in the church a brother stood behind the pulpit administered and and there was such an expectation for 77. and another brother stood up and spoke in tongues and another brother interpreted the interpretation was something along this line of get ready we're down to our last couple of days you better be ready 77 is just a few days down here there was somewhere between 120 and 130 rebaptisms at night appearing including myself and then it didn't happen got to talk to folks after that and asking where is so and so I haven't seen them anymore where are they they haven't been back to church they said it didn't happen in 77 and they gave up I know a young man whose father was one of the deacons at Branham Tabernacle I worked with him and he told me what life was that right before 77 they got married at 15 and 16 years old so they could be married before God came they quit their jobs they stopped going to school I asked him what's like for that later he said life was a mess we're not looking into what man's interpretation we're looking to what the scripture says and the spirit of Christ in you should be saying Amen to the word of God look up your Redemption draweth nigh but brother Graham says keep doing what you do keep going keep being a Christian keep being friendly to your neighbor keep being a good worker do those things that would cause somebody to come up to you say how can you live this way in such a time and then you can share that God in your life to him that's what he asked us to do you know I've brother Dan you've heard many of the things that have been said in this message over the years he was coming this time he was coming here he was but you know he is coming he has come and be ready lift up your head Redemption draweth nigh could this be the morning you wake up oh Lord could this be the day Lord then let me go this day in your name and go forth proclaiming that Jesus Christ is alive today the day that he does come and take us home I'll believe that and it could share some experience of things and people that happened those that say we're in the Millennium now those that whatever they say just trim your lamps and be ready Lord am I staying true to what you've called me to do my is the love of God flowing my heart would I be willing I was talking with my wife yesterday wasn't it and you know we shall we will be there at that judgment and and it says to them was granted life and I thought to myself I was telling my wife I said if I was standing there in the Lord as part of the Bride the Lord would say now they're they're being judged and he would ask me well do they deserve heaven or not could I honestly know Lord send him to hell if I had that attitude now or that and then that means I had that attitude now and I'd say Lord help me Lord can I reach out and bring one more can I reach out and and draw another one home I I'll just I'll just be honest I'd finished ministering one service came walking around the back and I was just stepping out the side there and a young sister passed by and then she just muttered we might as well give up and just quit if it's like that and I thought my what did I preach that I would have given somebody that attitude so I said sister what was that for and she said well the brother just told me well 63 came and Jesus came and there's no use even trying to save a soul today I said Lord help us Lord how many came in after 63 boy there's a whole lot of you wouldn't have a chance then today huh thank God for his mercy and his grace to our lives Lord let's just help me to be ready live a life worthy of the Gospel amen would that be your prayer too and you know we all struggle and sometimes we fail we do things wrong as quick as you can make it right say I'm sorry and you know God says uh brother grain used to say this all the time you'll go back and you tell the Lord I'm sorry

not to do wrong but sometimes we do Lord our desire is to be pleasing to Love You Lord and to love one another Lord let the peace of God just settle in their heart that all is well Lord you've made the way you've provided a perfect sacrifice just like the the group of the the children of God the Israel Lord was watching as that high priest went into that into that holy of holies on this day and to see if the sacrifice was accepted and if it was accepted there was a peace that came over with it Lord and the sacrifice was accepted in our steadlord there's a piece that comes with that part Lord bring that peace to someone that needs it today Lord for all is well Lord all is well and all is well oh there is a place of perfectness behind this [Music] for all is well foreign the cross had just
