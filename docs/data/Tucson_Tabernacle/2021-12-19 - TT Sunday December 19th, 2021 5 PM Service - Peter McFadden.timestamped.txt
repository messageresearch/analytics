[33:42] totally dedicated to you father in jesus
[33:44] name
[33:45] amen
[33:47] amen while you're standing let's turn to
[33:49] exodus chapter 14.
[33:53] 13th verse thank you musicians
[33:58] that saxophone player he looks awfully
[34:00] like our
[34:02] brother aaron
[34:06] must be his brother or something
[34:15] exodus chapter 14
[34:18] and we'll read 13 and 14.
[34:30] and moses said unto the people
[34:34] fear ye not
[34:36] stand still
[34:39] and see the salvation of the lord which
[34:41] he
[34:43] shall show will show you the today
[34:46] for the egyptians whom you have seen
[34:48] today
[34:49] you shall see them
[34:52] again no more forever
[34:55] the lord shall fight for you
[34:58] and ye shall hold your peace
[35:01] that's also where we're standing go to
[35:03] matthew 11 and 28.
[35:22] these are the words of jesus
[35:25] familiar words of comfort to us
[35:28] matthew 11 28
[35:31] says
[35:34] come unto me
[35:36] all ye that labor and are heavy laden
[35:39] and i will give you rest
[35:42] take my yoke upon you
[35:45] and learn of me
[35:47] for i am meek and lowly in heart
[35:50] ye shall find rest unto your souls
[35:54] for my yoke is easy and my burden is
[35:56] light praise the lord for that let's be
[35:59] seated
[36:01] unless you want to come stand up here
[36:02] with me then be glad for the company
[36:13] i wanted to talk for a few minutes
[36:16] i was thinking a lot about that
[36:17] scripture
[36:19] where it says
[36:20] be still and know that i'm god
[36:24] thinking about that great commandment
[36:27] to be still
[36:30] and uh
[36:31] it's very common for the people of the
[36:33] world to
[36:34] disobey the ten commandments and
[36:37] and
[36:38] the various things but this one could be
[36:41] the most disobeyed of the commandments
[36:45] because nobody is still
[36:48] nobody will
[36:49] will stop for a minute
[36:52] and if you do have to stop for a minute
[36:56] then the phone comes out right away and
[36:58] you've got to you got to occupy yourself
[37:01] on the phone or you got to turn the
[37:03] radio on or
[37:05] something to keep from obeying this
[37:07] commandment
[37:09] got to do something to keep from
[37:11] being still
[37:13] but
[37:15] in this
[37:16] stillness and in this rest
[37:19] is where god works
[37:22] and i want to be
[37:24] where he's moving
[37:25] i want to be just
[37:27] as close as i can be to that
[37:31] and so if i have to be still to get
[37:32] there the lord help me to be still
[37:36] help me to know that he's god
[37:39] and that's sure a leaf if it was up to
[37:41] me
[37:42] then you'd all be in trouble
[37:44] and so would i
[37:46] but he's god
[37:48] is he that made us and not we ourselves
[37:52] he's the same yesterday today and
[37:53] forever and he's got it under control
[37:57] so
[37:59] like jesus said if we come to him he'd
[38:01] give us this gift of rest
[38:04] and
[38:06] i want to talk about that
[38:09] but i don't want to turn this into a
[38:15] complicated explanation of a simple
[38:17] thing
[38:19] that's what lawyers like to do is they
[38:20] like to take the simple and they make it
[38:21] complicated
[38:23] because then you know it's money
[38:25] but the things of god are simple he's
[38:27] hidden in simplicity
[38:29] and
[38:30] the rest of god
[38:32] which is what we're talking about this
[38:34] being still and resting in him
[38:37] it's remarkably simple
[38:39] and so if if at the end of the sermon
[38:43] it seems more unattainable than at the
[38:44] beginning then forgive me and
[38:48] pray for me
[38:50] because
[38:52] the things of god are simple and and
[38:54] this this rest we know is is the holy
[38:56] ghost
[38:57] living in the holy ghost so don't don't
[38:59] let's make that
[39:00] this real complicated and difficult but
[39:03] let's see if we can find some
[39:05] encouragement in the word of god
[39:07] and some some wisdom in the word of god
[39:09] that we can
[39:10] tomorrow
[39:12] apply these scriptures to our lives and
[39:15] see see good fruit from that
[39:18] you might think i'm a little odd for for
[39:21] starting with a little altar call like
[39:24] that
[39:25] but i was uh
[39:26] i was listening to a sermon where
[39:28] brother branham talks against altar
[39:29] calls and i still kind of did it
[39:31] but in in the service
[39:33] in the sermon perfect strength by
[39:35] perfect weakness
[39:37] there's a quote that really just stood
[39:39] out to me because
[39:40] he's talking against altar calls where
[39:42] you you know begging drawing trying to
[39:44] to work somebody up emotionally and
[39:46] bring them to the altar
[39:48] but what he said i thought was
[39:49] remarkable
[39:52] and he said now the altar
[39:54] is the place of prayer
[39:56] where every person coming to the church
[40:00] should first go in
[40:02] kneel at the altar
[40:04] silently pray to god and offer their
[40:06] petition of prayer
[40:08] and for their loved ones
[40:10] and thanking god for what they
[40:13] have had done for them
[40:15] then go back to their seat
[40:18] and i thought what a different way to
[40:19] approach this
[40:22] this portion of our church this portion
[40:24] of our our lives
[40:26] that
[40:29] we don't want to make it into a
[40:30] tradition and and just make it formalism
[40:32] but
[40:33] what if we come to church in that
[40:35] attitude
[40:36] that atmosphere
[40:38] and what if we come and
[40:40] instead of just coming 30 minutes early
[40:42] or as close to that as we can just for
[40:45] for routine's sake
[40:47] what if we would come and just
[40:50] find an altar here or in your hearts and
[40:52] and what if we just start service
[40:57] just
[40:58] asking god thanking god
[41:01] i believe we do i don't i don't believe
[41:03] this is uh
[41:04] something that none of you do but if
[41:06] you're doing it i just encourage you to
[41:08] keep doing it
[41:09] and if maybe that's
[41:12] slipped slipped by the way over the
[41:13] years let me just remind you
[41:16] that when we come in let's let's just
[41:19] keep him always first on our mind and on
[41:21] our hearts
[41:22] and let's let's just start every service
[41:24] like that because
[41:27] i don't believe that this church is is
[41:29] just trying to maintain a baseline
[41:33] or just keep a status quo
[41:35] but i believe we're trying to go
[41:37] somewhere that we've never
[41:39] never gone before
[41:42] we're we're getting ready to experience
[41:44] something that we've never experienced
[41:46] before
[41:48] and so
[41:50] i'm not satisfied
[41:53] to maintain
[41:56] a level of devotion to god
[41:59] but we ought to be expecting more
[42:02] we ought to be
[42:04] feeling his his drawing because no man
[42:06] can come to god except god draw him
[42:09] and so it's not that we
[42:11] get a great idea that we should draw
[42:13] near to god but
[42:15] he's that great magnet that's going over
[42:17] and pulling his children
[42:19] and before those pieces of metal jump up
[42:21] in the air like like we're gonna do
[42:24] they start to just shake in his presence
[42:27] they start to feel something
[42:30] they start to
[42:31] what is this this is something new
[42:35] because we're living in the astronaut
[42:36] age
[42:38] when brother branham was
[42:40] preaching the seals and and going
[42:42] through all these things that god was
[42:45] revealing to him
[42:47] he could see and he he reminded us that
[42:49] the natural types the spiritual and he
[42:51] could see that in the nation one of the
[42:54] monumental developments in the nation
[42:56] where these pioneers
[42:58] going up into space
[43:01] these people these these russians and
[43:03] americans
[43:04] that were doing something totally new
[43:06] and brother branham said this is a sign
[43:08] to you church
[43:10] not church but this is a sign to you
[43:12] bride
[43:15] and if that was a sign then
[43:18] then i look at the headlines now
[43:20] and i saw one just within the month
[43:23] that said
[43:24] nasa selects new class of astronauts
[43:28] wow
[43:29] they're young people
[43:31] they're my age
[43:33] they're going to space
[43:35] and i thought isn't that right that
[43:37] there's
[43:39] not just those pioneers that went back
[43:41] in the 60s
[43:44] this word isn't just for brother branham
[43:49] but there's been a class of astronauts
[43:51] selected
[43:54] there's a chosen people
[43:56] and in the article talked about these
[43:58] people they've been selected and so what
[44:00] they're doing
[44:02] is they're making ready
[44:03] they're training
[44:05] they're in expectations for this blast
[44:08] off date
[44:09] and i thought my
[44:11] isn't that wonderful
[44:14] what an age this is to live in
[44:20] what's your 10-year plan
[44:23] well i've got a i've got a wedding
[44:25] supper in mind
[44:27] i hope
[44:28] if it's not 10 years then that'll be my
[44:30] next 10-year plan
[44:32] that'll be my next 10-year plan
[44:34] but i believe i'll be there
[44:37] i believe i'll see you there
[44:42] won't that be wonderful
[44:47] then a little farther
[44:48] it's quite a sermon this perfect
[44:50] strength by perfect weakness
[44:53] a little farther in there
[44:55] another quote that jumped out to me
[44:58] because it kind of ran
[45:05] ran a little bit in the way of
[45:07] the way i had understood some things
[45:11] but he talks about the reason we go to
[45:12] church
[45:14] and i always kind of thought we came to
[45:16] church to to worship the lord
[45:20] and i'm sure that's a part of it
[45:22] but listen how he put it here
[45:25] he said there's little things that we do
[45:28] and that's why we come to church for
[45:31] is to find out where our faults are
[45:35] and the things that we might better
[45:36] ourselves by
[45:39] if we go to church if we come to church
[45:41] for any other
[45:42] any other objective than this
[45:45] i'm afraid we won't get too much out of
[45:46] coming to coming to church
[45:50] we must come to find our weaknesses
[45:53] find our bad places
[45:55] and see
[45:56] and our see how little we are
[45:59] and put our trust in somebody
[46:01] that's strong
[46:03] but when we have weaknesses and he goes
[46:05] on
[46:06] i thought my
[46:09] that's a good reason to come to church
[46:12] and that's how i want to come to church
[46:15] because
[46:17] i don't want to be
[46:20] deceived
[46:21] and i don't want to deceive myself
[46:24] that's they say the worst type of
[46:26] deception
[46:29] because
[46:33] it's true that we have great and
[46:35] precious promises
[46:38] and we ought never let anything take our
[46:40] eyes off of that
[46:43] anything that tries to shake you from
[46:45] that
[46:46] reject it
[46:48] but any spirit
[46:50] that tries to take you into a
[46:53] false rest
[46:54] that's not a rest based on this
[46:56] scripture
[46:59] and any spirit
[47:02] that would
[47:04] would take
[47:05] and and tell you to ignore the parts of
[47:06] the bible that say examine yourselves
[47:09] whether you be in the faith
[47:14] see you've got to judge every spirit and
[47:16] see if it runs all the way with the
[47:18] bible
[47:19] and so i wanted to talk a little bit
[47:21] about rest because
[47:23] i know i've kind of talked about this
[47:24] before but i think it's so important i
[47:26] believe it's so important
[47:28] that we would enter into his rest
[47:32] because there's only one true rest as
[47:34] that's his rest
[47:36] and we saw a man
[47:39] well i didn't see him but lydia saw a
[47:42] man on the way here that was passed out
[47:45] on the sidewalk
[47:47] now he is resting
[47:49] but i don't want his rest
[47:51] i don't want that rest
[47:54] that rest is deceptive because that
[47:56] man's in trouble
[47:58] sleeping is maybe not going to solve his
[48:00] problems
[48:02] but there is a rest
[48:05] there is
[48:06] this gift to the believer this gift to
[48:09] the bride that
[48:10] we can be hid in the hollows of the
[48:12] hands of christ
[48:14] and we can be in that bomb shelter made
[48:17] out of feathers
[48:19] and we can have our ticket booked on
[48:22] on the rocket ship out of here
[48:25] so let's let's just look at that rest
[48:28] let's let's see what the bible says
[48:29] about that
[48:31] at rest
[48:34] because that rest is going to take us
[48:36] out of here
[48:38] that rest is jesus
[48:41] the whole message is about a person it's
[48:43] about jesus christ
[48:45] everything's in him
[48:47] he's uh he's my insurance policy he's my
[48:50] retirement plan
[48:52] he's
[48:53] he's my spouse he's my father
[48:56] he's everything to me
[48:58] and
[49:02] believe that we're going to be gone
[49:04] but before that happens before we're
[49:07] before we're physically gone
[49:10] i believe that entering into this rest
[49:13] before we're physically gone there's
[49:16] gonna be a change in us
[49:19] that that old man is gone
[49:23] that there's been
[49:25] that same fire that came down on
[49:27] elijah's altar
[49:29] when elijah was obedient to god there
[49:31] was this fire that came down and it just
[49:34] took everything
[49:36] took the sacrifice and it took the rocks
[49:38] and it took the water
[49:41] i believe that for you and me
[49:46] i believe that the old man can be the
[49:48] old woman
[49:50] can be totally gone
[49:53] that we can enter into that rest
[49:56] not in our strivings and in our
[50:00] trying to
[50:01] to gain that but as as we can just
[50:04] receive this gift
[50:06] as we can just say yes lord i believe it
[50:10] as we can say
[50:12] i'm going to walk in obedience
[50:15] and though i can never do it in myself i
[50:17] believe that
[50:19] as i'm reaching out to you you'll reach
[50:21] out to me
[50:22] but as i draw near to you god
[50:25] you'll draw near to me and your your
[50:27] legs are a lot bigger than mine
[50:30] so i'm thankful for that
[50:35] this rapture that we're looking forward
[50:37] to
[50:38] that's just the last step
[50:40] in this walk that we're walking
[50:43] and so if we
[50:45] if we just put that all off
[50:47] uh to some some future day
[50:50] then
[50:52] might be disappointed
[50:54] when that day comes
[50:56] but if we can just
[50:59] say lord as close as i can get to that
[51:01] now let me get to that now
[51:03] and tomorrow i believe i'll get a little
[51:05] bit closer than that
[51:07] see this is
[51:09] this is the time
[51:11] more than ever before this astronaut age
[51:13] that we're living in
[51:15] this is the time to lose some weight
[51:18] to lay aside
[51:20] these
[51:20] things that so easily beset us
[51:24] because we're
[51:25] we're getting out of here
[51:29] and so it's easy to just repeat that
[51:32] just say yeah i know
[51:34] i know i know and i'll talk about that a
[51:36] little bit this i know
[51:40] we know it
[51:41] but here's a here's a tough question
[51:46] are you lighter today than you were
[51:47] yesterday
[51:51] because if you're not
[51:53] maybe you didn't lay anything aside
[51:54] yesterday
[51:57] this is something that
[51:59] we ought to be
[52:00] lighter
[52:01] day by day
[52:03] we ought to
[52:05] think more of christ day by day
[52:07] we ought to think less of this world day
[52:09] by day
[52:11] are we doing this let's examine
[52:14] let's see
[52:16] don't don't get discouraged
[52:18] if
[52:19] if you're not making the kind of
[52:20] progress that you'd like to be making
[52:23] but just
[52:25] keep pressing towards that mark of the
[52:27] high calling
[52:29] fall down
[52:31] well righteous man gets back up
[52:34] fall down
[52:35] get back up
[52:38] just keep pressing
[52:40] but don't stop pressing
[52:43] don't be lured into a false rest where
[52:45] you just
[52:48] give up too soon
[52:52] because
[52:54] the first thing they did
[52:56] when they went into the promised land
[52:59] children of israel that was
[53:01] their arrest you know this this type of
[53:03] the holy ghost this promised lamb
[53:07] the first thing they did is they
[53:11] started doing some free plastic surgery
[53:13] on
[53:14] on the inhabitants of the land and
[53:16] re-uh rearranging their appearance
[53:19] and uh they started fighting
[53:21] you know
[53:23] so we ought to be fighting like that and
[53:25] i was really encouraged
[53:27] there's a scripture in deuteronomy that
[53:30] i won't quote it word for word but
[53:32] basically what it says is when you cross
[53:34] this land
[53:36] and you're fighting for
[53:37] for your piece of the land right
[53:39] um this land has been divided up for for
[53:42] the different people
[53:43] different families and basically what it
[53:45] says is as you're fighting
[53:48] once you get your your peace cleared
[53:52] you keep fighting to help your brother
[53:54] clear his peace
[53:56] so maybe you're maybe this is all
[54:00] been there done that i've got that down
[54:02] well help some of the rest of us out
[54:05] be an encouragement to some of the rest
[54:07] of us
[54:08] your words are powerful
[54:11] and and the way that you can
[54:13] communicate love to somebody else
[54:16] that's important
[54:18] so if you've already got all this down
[54:20] and and help the rest of us and we'll
[54:23] get all the enemy cleared out and we'll
[54:25] just have a good time in the lord
[54:29] but i don't want any trouble at the
[54:31] river
[54:33] i believe we've
[54:34] brother branham talked about in this
[54:36] building that the lord's building the
[54:39] spirit's building he said we've turned
[54:41] the last corner
[54:45] i'm so glad for that because
[54:48] that means now that as we're building
[54:51] you know we just got to keep straight
[54:52] along with what we've heard we don't
[54:53] have to come
[54:54] new doctrines and new corners just just
[54:57] straight on
[54:58] but what that means is we're headed back
[55:00] to that
[55:01] original cornerstone
[55:04] and that brick by brick as we go
[55:07] we're gonna see him a little more
[55:09] clearly
[55:10] we're gonna get a little bit closer to
[55:12] him
[55:15] that we're just going on by the word
[55:18] and we're just believing that what he's
[55:20] promised us is true and we're resting in
[55:23] that
[55:25] and and what really one of the things
[55:27] that really got me thinking
[55:29] about this
[55:30] rest i better hurry up here i'm not even
[55:32] started
[55:34] so
[55:36] just pray for me
[55:37] um
[55:39] the cookies will be there don't worry
[55:44] i was thinking about momentum
[55:47] and this
[55:48] this movement and
[55:51] and
[55:52] basically the idea of momentum is that
[55:55] it ties in with
[55:56] newton's laws of motion his first law
[55:59] and what it basically says is an object
[56:02] at rest
[56:03] will stay in rest
[56:06] and an object in motion
[56:08] will stay in motion
[56:11] unless there's an unbalanced force that
[56:13] acts on
[56:14] it and i thought wow
[56:18] that's interesting
[56:19] because you can think of
[56:21] momentum in the movement of a
[56:24] block or a ball or something like that
[56:26] but our lives have
[56:28] momentum there are portions of our lives
[56:31] that are going certain ways and and
[56:33] going down certain paths
[56:37] and at the same time there's
[56:39] that center portion of our life
[56:41] that's supposed to be a total rest
[56:45] and and what this idea of momentum in
[56:49] the physical world
[56:50] which we believe that god reveals
[56:51] himself in this physical world
[56:54] the heavens declare his glory and this
[56:56] is all kind of a zoomed in portion of
[56:59] the heavens
[57:00] but
[57:01] what it says about this this thing
[57:03] that's resting
[57:06] is that
[57:09] it will
[57:10] stay at rest
[57:12] as long as there's no unbalanced force
[57:16] so if this pulpit is
[57:19] is sitting here it's going to sit here
[57:23] until a force moves it
[57:25] and even then if there's a force if i'm
[57:27] pushing this
[57:28] if brother aaron comes and he's pushing
[57:29] two from the other side
[57:32] it's still gonna stay there
[57:35] as long as the forces are balanced
[57:38] that's not mine that's interesting
[57:43] because the thing about our rest
[57:46] is it's it's so beautiful that we can
[57:48] rest in this time when everything's
[57:50] going
[57:52] like this
[57:53] that we can rest
[57:56] but the devil always tries to trick us
[57:58] out of it
[58:00] just like he did to adam and eve where
[58:01] they were safe as long as they were in
[58:03] this
[58:05] protection of god's word
[58:08] so satan had to try to trick them out of
[58:10] that and so there are forces that he'll
[58:12] bring
[58:13] in your life all the time to try to push
[58:15] you out of rest
[58:17] one way or the other he doesn't care
[58:20] he could push you to legalism or
[58:22] worldliness or pride or envy or hatred
[58:25] or whatever it is he doesn't care
[58:28] just wants to get you out of that
[58:30] state of rest
[58:35] but what newton's law says is
[58:37] as long as there's a balanced force
[58:40] that will oppose that
[58:42] that object will stay in rest
[58:45] i thought wow
[58:47] that's wonderful because we have a
[58:49] promise
[58:50] that when the enemy comes in like a
[58:51] flood
[58:53] the spirit of god will raise up a
[58:54] standard against thy
[58:56] whatever way it's coming from
[58:59] the spirit of god raises standard
[59:00] against that to oppose that
[59:03] and they keep us in rest
[59:06] and so
[59:08] i was thinking about this momentum and
[59:10] how do we
[59:12] how do we get
[59:14] there's the portion of our lives that
[59:15] are supposed to stay still and then
[59:17] there's a portion of life that's
[59:18] supposed to be going somewhere an aspect
[59:21] and i thought well how do we
[59:24] how do we affect the trajectory of our
[59:27] lives when when it's
[59:29] when it's um
[59:31] moved out of the wrong way and i was
[59:33] talking to a man
[59:35] that deals with uh working with children
[59:39] and we're talking about all the problems
[59:41] in the world
[59:43] and he he mentioned the quote
[59:47] that says
[59:49] it's
[59:51] it's a lot easier
[59:53] to steer a child the right way
[59:56] than it is to try to reform an adult
[59:59] and he was saying you know his hope
[1:00:02] was that the world is messed up and if
[1:00:03] you go to try to help the adults the
[1:00:05] adults are pretty set in their ways
[1:00:07] and so they're really hard to help
[1:00:10] but a child is still moldable
[1:00:12] and a child you can get pointed down the
[1:00:15] right path more easily
[1:00:19] i thought wow
[1:00:21] aren't we told to come as children
[1:00:24] that it's not in our wisdom to to try to
[1:00:27] figure out how to reroute our lives
[1:00:32] but let's just come
[1:00:34] with the rest of children
[1:00:37] it says lord you know
[1:00:39] just point me in the right way
[1:00:42] because the natural way is to get set in
[1:00:44] our ways
[1:00:45] and to get
[1:00:47] just going down one path
[1:00:51] better child to go
[1:00:54] i wanted to say a child will go anywhere
[1:00:56] you point them
[1:00:58] sometimes you still have to fight with
[1:00:59] kids
[1:01:00] i'll be honest with you
[1:01:02] that's that's a big part of my life
[1:01:04] but uh what what better opponents
[1:01:07] i wouldn't choose any other opponents to
[1:01:09] fight with they're pretty great
[1:01:13] but the lord knows how to deal with our
[1:01:15] with his children and when we throw a
[1:01:16] temper tantrum he knows he's got wisdom
[1:01:18] to deal with that too
[1:01:19] so don't you worry
[1:01:24] but i thought of solomon
[1:01:25] in all his wisdom he was
[1:01:27] asked for wisdom and he was granted
[1:01:29] wisdom lord answers our prayers
[1:01:33] thought of solomon and all his wisdom
[1:01:35] and look where he ended up still
[1:01:39] and that's where i was thinking of this
[1:01:41] this spirit of i know i know don't don't
[1:01:44] tell me all this again and again i know
[1:01:47] i know
[1:01:49] and that's
[1:01:51] that's kind of the refrain of the church
[1:01:54] i know i know
[1:01:55] but the bride says i do
[1:01:58] i do
[1:01:59] it's not about what you know but what do
[1:02:01] you do
[1:02:02] are we laying aside these
[1:02:04] weights are we throwing ourselves
[1:02:07] totally on his mercy
[1:02:11] i do
[1:02:13] i accept it
[1:02:15] proposal accepted
[1:02:18] that's where i want to be
[1:02:24] the battle belongs to the lord we trust
[1:02:27] in him and we know that we don't have to
[1:02:30] fear because it's our father's good
[1:02:31] pleasure to give us the kingdom
[1:02:34] there's a promise in the bible
[1:02:37] it says all thy children shall be taught
[1:02:38] of the lord
[1:02:40] and great shall be the peace of thy
[1:02:42] children
[1:02:44] that's for our children how much more is
[1:02:46] that for us as children of god
[1:02:50] what a great peace we have in him
[1:02:53] don't let the devil push you from that
[1:02:54] anything that would push you from that
[1:02:56] resist it
[1:02:57] oppose that
[1:02:59] look at that standard that the word
[1:03:00] raises that says no
[1:03:02] i'm just going to stay at rest
[1:03:07] all through the
[1:03:09] bible there were types of this and the
[1:03:11] sabbath the sabbath was the day of the
[1:03:12] week of course that
[1:03:14] that at the end of the week after
[1:03:17] there'd been this
[1:03:18] six days of labor there's this day of
[1:03:20] rest
[1:03:22] now we're we're there in the seventh day
[1:03:25] leaving for rest and and this was also
[1:03:27] you know in the in the years for the
[1:03:29] field
[1:03:30] the sabbath there was a sabbath year
[1:03:32] every seven years for the field
[1:03:34] that the land would rest
[1:03:37] and then jesus came
[1:03:40] and he said man wasn't made for the
[1:03:42] sabbath but the sabbath was made for man
[1:03:46] he said the son of the son of man is the
[1:03:49] lord of the sabbath
[1:03:51] he said this isn't just something that
[1:03:53] that we do for god
[1:03:56] but this is a great gift of god for us
[1:04:01] and and i thought about
[1:04:04] sometimes we waste that gift
[1:04:07] and it's easy i was talking with a man
[1:04:09] about this it's easy to um
[1:04:12] to fill our
[1:04:14] our saturdays and
[1:04:16] you know saturdays the sabbath it's it's
[1:04:18] easy to fill that with things that that
[1:04:20] steal away from that rest that's
[1:04:22] supposed to be there
[1:04:24] from that time of
[1:04:26] refreshment and renewal
[1:04:28] and appreciation for god
[1:04:32] but just as this is kind of a natural
[1:04:34] aside but don't fall for that
[1:04:37] just as we have
[1:04:39] rest in the spiritual
[1:04:40] as a spiritual people
[1:04:44] physically
[1:04:45] it's good to have a day of the week that
[1:04:47] you rest
[1:04:48] and so it can be easy caught up with
[1:04:51] even good things you know sports and and
[1:04:53] hanging out with your friends and things
[1:04:55] but
[1:04:56] try to just set aside some time
[1:05:00] just to
[1:05:02] appreciate the things of god and
[1:05:04] reset
[1:05:05] and just
[1:05:07] it's a real gift to you that the devil's
[1:05:09] trying to rob you of it so don't let him
[1:05:11] rob you of it
[1:05:12] i know
[1:05:14] i got to
[1:05:15] get away from the city yesterday and
[1:05:17] kind of reset and it was
[1:05:19] it had been too long it's easy to go a
[1:05:22] while without without
[1:05:25] doing that
[1:05:27] but then
[1:05:28] you know you think in the same way
[1:05:31] this rest that we've been given in the
[1:05:33] spiritual
[1:05:35] what are we using that for
[1:05:38] have we ceased from our works just to to
[1:05:40] forget about god and get caught up in
[1:05:43] other things or
[1:05:46] this rest that we've entered into
[1:05:49] are we just letting it
[1:05:51] be a time that we can enjoy the lord
[1:05:54] a time that we can
[1:05:56] walk with him in this cool of the
[1:05:58] evening i believe we're in that evening
[1:06:00] time
[1:06:01] i believe he's walking again
[1:06:03] among us and with us
[1:06:05] just like when
[1:06:06] isaac was going
[1:06:08] or rebecca was coming to me to isaac
[1:06:11] says he he he went out to meet her
[1:06:14] wow
[1:06:17] i believe he's done that now
[1:06:20] i believe this last stretch the journey
[1:06:24] he's come to bring us home
[1:06:27] i believe that just like eleazar
[1:06:30] pointed to rebecca and said that's the
[1:06:31] guy
[1:06:33] that's your husband
[1:06:35] didn't we have that happen
[1:06:37] we have a messenger that says
[1:06:40] there he is
[1:06:42] that's him
[1:06:43] there he is
[1:06:47] i believe we're getting
[1:06:48] real close to home in that time where
[1:06:50] it's just christ and his
[1:06:52] his bride
[1:06:55] what a day we're living in
[1:07:02] so we've got a
[1:07:04] we've got a fight to stay in that rest
[1:07:07] sounds a little bit bit funny but
[1:07:09] in galatians 5 1.
[1:07:12] if we could get that put up
[1:07:15] galatians 5 1 says stand fast therefore
[1:07:19] in the liberty where with christ hath
[1:07:21] made us free
[1:07:23] and be not entangled again with the yoke
[1:07:25] of bondage
[1:07:28] so that's in there for a reason
[1:07:30] there is a yoke of bondage that would
[1:07:33] try to tangle you up
[1:07:36] but stand fast
[1:07:39] resist that that would move you from
[1:07:41] rest
[1:07:43] keep
[1:07:44] keep pressing towards the mark of the
[1:07:47] prize of the high calling of god in
[1:07:49] christ jesus
[1:07:53] accept this gift and hold on to it
[1:08:00] and this rest is is a total
[1:08:03] surrender of our will
[1:08:06] thy thy kingdom come thy will be done
[1:08:08] it's the way that jesus taught us to
[1:08:10] pray
[1:08:12] he taught us in luke
[1:08:14] 9 and 23
[1:08:16] if we could get that put up we'll read
[1:08:18] verse 25 luke 9 23
[1:08:22] jesus said to them all
[1:08:25] if any man
[1:08:27] will come after me
[1:08:30] let him deny himself and take up his
[1:08:32] cross daily and follow me
[1:08:35] for whosoever will save his life will
[1:08:37] lose it
[1:08:38] but whosoever will lose his life for my
[1:08:40] sake the same shall save it
[1:08:43] for what is a man advantaged if he gain
[1:08:46] the whole world and lose himself
[1:08:48] or be cast away
[1:08:51] and so we see that
[1:08:53] he said come
[1:08:55] my yoke is easy my burden's light i'll
[1:08:56] give you this rest
[1:08:58] and then he says
[1:09:01] here's how you do it
[1:09:03] you deny yourself
[1:09:05] you take up your cross
[1:09:07] you follow me
[1:09:09] we die daily like paul said
[1:09:12] we know john when john saw this
[1:09:16] one that was in the midst of the
[1:09:17] candlesticks
[1:09:19] says when i saw him i fell at his feet
[1:09:22] as dead
[1:09:24] i believe that's the correct response
[1:09:27] if we can catch a glimpse of him
[1:09:29] the old man dies away
[1:09:33] and that's that's a daily thing
[1:09:35] you know that's
[1:09:37] that's not something that we we fully
[1:09:38] surrender once and you know in a sense
[1:09:40] it is when we receive the holy ghost
[1:09:43] that you're
[1:09:44] you're eternally sealed till the day of
[1:09:46] your redemption
[1:09:48] but there's this yoke of bondage that
[1:09:50] would try to tangle you again
[1:09:52] not that you'd lose your salvation
[1:09:54] but that you could lose your rest
[1:09:57] you could lose that peace that gift of
[1:10:00] god and so
[1:10:03] i was so glad just the way that brother
[1:10:06] aaron was finishing his sermon kind of
[1:10:08] tied right into
[1:10:10] what i was thinking because
[1:10:12] i was thinking a lot about gethsemane
[1:10:15] and that's really one of the
[1:10:17] the crucial
[1:10:20] one of the most important places
[1:10:23] and the most important times in the
[1:10:26] history of the world
[1:10:27] is this little man that couldn't even be
[1:10:31] identified from among his disciples he
[1:10:34] blended in with him so well that they
[1:10:35] needed to have judas come and identify
[1:10:37] him so it wasn't this man that
[1:10:39] stood out for everyone else but he was
[1:10:41] just this
[1:10:42] kind of normal looking guy
[1:10:44] that would go up there
[1:10:46] and he would pray
[1:10:49] and i thought my
[1:10:51] because
[1:10:52] it says
[1:10:55] let's read it in luke 22 and 39
[1:10:58] let's put it up
[1:11:01] if we could
[1:11:05] it says
[1:11:06] and he came out and went
[1:11:08] as he was one to the mount of olives
[1:11:12] and his disciples also followed him
[1:11:14] let's just stay there a second
[1:11:17] those words as he was one
[1:11:20] it's kind of old english
[1:11:22] but if you read other translations it
[1:11:23] means as usual
[1:11:27] as was his custom
[1:11:29] as was his habit
[1:11:32] he didn't go to gethsemane once
[1:11:36] but this is what he always did
[1:11:39] this is how he lived
[1:11:44] and if that was
[1:11:47] the spirit moving in him
[1:11:49] moved him to do that
[1:11:51] and look at this last part his disciples
[1:11:53] also followed him
[1:11:55] that's us
[1:11:56] right
[1:11:58] we're to follow him there
[1:12:00] and so
[1:12:01] this rest
[1:12:06] the world will try to sell you a rest
[1:12:10] without a gethsemane
[1:12:14] but his rest
[1:12:17] came through gethsemane
[1:12:21] the word means the oil press
[1:12:25] the mount of olives that's where they
[1:12:27] pressed these olives
[1:12:30] crushed these olives
[1:12:33] to get the oil out of them
[1:12:35] before he was ever crushed on calvary
[1:12:39] he had a habit he had a custom
[1:12:43] to go to the oil press
[1:12:46] and it wasn't just the last day of his
[1:12:48] life that said i will be done
[1:12:54] but every
[1:12:55] every night
[1:12:57] it sounds like maybe not every night i
[1:12:59] don't know what the habit the customers
[1:13:01] but as
[1:13:02] usual he would go up there and and
[1:13:07] pray what i'd imagine would be a similar
[1:13:09] prayer
[1:13:12] not my will
[1:13:14] that i will be done
[1:13:18] see that's not the rest that the
[1:13:19] disciples had at this point
[1:13:22] he said come you know pray with me
[1:13:25] carry with me an hour
[1:13:27] their rest was just go up there and go
[1:13:29] to sleep
[1:13:32] and that's the rest of of the church
[1:13:36] there's two groups of ladies that are
[1:13:37] sleeping now
[1:13:39] just one's got oil
[1:13:42] one doesn't see one's been to the oil
[1:13:43] press
[1:13:48] gethsemane
[1:13:52] one is going to try to go later
[1:13:55] when it's too late
[1:13:59] the wise and the foolish virgins
[1:14:07] if that same spirit
[1:14:10] that raised christ from the dead dwell
[1:14:12] in you
[1:14:14] won't it take you to gethsemane
[1:14:20] won't you won't it bring you to a rest
[1:14:25] by giving you the strength to take up
[1:14:27] your cross daily
[1:14:29] see we're not talking about living the
[1:14:31] way
[1:14:32] we've been living for the last 40 years
[1:14:34] 50 years
[1:14:35] talking about going up
[1:14:38] talking about a change in
[1:14:41] elevation
[1:14:44] but remember
[1:14:46] my yoke is easy
[1:14:49] my burden is light don't let this become
[1:14:51] this
[1:14:52] this thing that's a human effort
[1:14:54] it's not
[1:14:58] it's just the crushing of the olives
[1:15:02] it's just letting that old man pass away
[1:15:06] it's just letting that fire of god come
[1:15:07] and take the whole sacrifice
[1:15:12] animal rock water
[1:15:16] see when i'm gone there's not even going
[1:15:17] to be a burnt spot on the sidewalk i'm
[1:15:19] just going to be gone
[1:15:23] believe you're coming too
[1:15:28] don't push that off
[1:15:32] like the song said pleasing let me be
[1:15:34] pleasing
[1:15:37] i believe the lord is drawing my people
[1:15:40] i believe he's calling i believe these
[1:15:42] are sober times
[1:15:44] remember the quote brother branham you
[1:15:45] don't come to church
[1:15:47] just uh
[1:15:51] what am i doing wrong lord
[1:15:54] what have i not let go of
[1:15:57] what are the weights that i'm not
[1:15:59] willing to drop
[1:16:04] so you get 70's a beautiful place
[1:16:08] for the believer
[1:16:11] for the one that will say
[1:16:12] i do
[1:16:14] instead of i i know
[1:16:21] but gethsemane was worth it to christ
[1:16:27] because he looked to the joy that was
[1:16:28] set before him
[1:16:32] he wasn't going there self-centered
[1:16:35] he wasn't going there just trying to
[1:16:38] make himself anything
[1:16:41] but he's saying oh there's this
[1:16:44] this little remnant of people
[1:16:47] i would give my life for
[1:16:52] and that spirit of christ in you
[1:16:56] maybe you're sealed saved delivered
[1:16:59] sanctified
[1:17:01] but will you fight for your brother
[1:17:04] do you care enough about your brother
[1:17:05] and sister to say
[1:17:07] okay my land's all clear no more
[1:17:09] philistines tonight
[1:17:12] but oh my brother my
[1:17:15] let sister go to gethsemane for you
[1:17:19] let me go and be crushed that you can
[1:17:21] see christ in me
[1:17:24] that you can be encouraged
[1:17:27] that i can have some fruit to offer when
[1:17:29] you're hungry
[1:17:30] some shade when you're hot
[1:17:36] do you have that love of christ in your
[1:17:38] heart
[1:17:39] i believe we do
[1:17:41] i believe he's given that to us
[1:17:44] but don't let anything move you from
[1:17:46] that
[1:17:48] don't let little whispering words of
[1:17:52] discord and things like that try to
[1:17:55] to move you from that stay in that rest
[1:17:57] oppose anything that
[1:17:59] would keep you from that first love
[1:18:02] that first love if you remember when
[1:18:04] you're filled with the holy ghost and if
[1:18:06] you were really filled
[1:18:09] you didn't have all in your heart
[1:18:10] against anybody
[1:18:13] you didn't have one weight in that
[1:18:15] department
[1:18:18] yes you've been moved from that
[1:18:22] come back
[1:18:24] come back to that first love
[1:18:28] if you're heavier now than you were when
[1:18:29] you were
[1:18:30] filled with the holy ghost if you've
[1:18:31] picked up some things some baggage
[1:18:35] burdens are lifted at calvary
[1:18:38] when we come into church
[1:18:40] we can come to that altar every time
[1:18:42] it's open
[1:18:44] deacons won't charge you by the minute
[1:18:47] just come in and say lord
[1:18:49] i'm getting heavy again
[1:18:52] getting some things that are pushing me
[1:18:54] out of that rest
[1:18:56] i'm getting looking at myself again
[1:18:58] getting looking at my failures i'm not
[1:19:00] looking to to calvary like i first did
[1:19:05] oh he'll meet you at that
[1:19:06] altar he'll speak to you
[1:19:10] it's not about brother aaron figuring
[1:19:11] out what you need but if you'll come
[1:19:13] like that
[1:19:15] come and say lord speak to me
[1:19:19] if you can speak through a donkey and a
[1:19:22] rooster
[1:19:23] don't you believe you can speak to your
[1:19:25] son of god
[1:19:27] don't you believe he can speak to you
[1:19:33] we've got a labor to enter into this
[1:19:34] rest but it's worth it
[1:19:40] let our lives
[1:19:43] say thy kingdom come thy will be done
[1:19:45] not just our lips
[1:19:47] but let our lives be fully surrendered
[1:19:51] you know it's easy to look at the
[1:19:52] disciples and be like man you guys blew
[1:19:55] it
[1:19:56] the lord said for you to wait with him
[1:19:58] and you guys just slept and
[1:20:01] guess he should have gotten different
[1:20:03] disciples but
[1:20:06] just wait and look at pentecost
[1:20:11] but they got a second chance at this
[1:20:14] lord said you know watch with me here
[1:20:16] and they didn't but then he said tara ye
[1:20:18] in the city of jerusalem
[1:20:20] until you're endued with power from on
[1:20:22] high
[1:20:24] and they did it
[1:20:25] they waited they stayed together
[1:20:28] they got in one accord
[1:20:33] see we all want to go back to the
[1:20:35] pentecostal blessings
[1:20:38] but are we willing to humble ourselves
[1:20:39] to get in one accord
[1:20:42] are we willing to obey this scripture
[1:20:44] where it says
[1:20:45] when you come together to eat
[1:20:48] i believe that's here i believe that's
[1:20:49] what we're doing here
[1:20:50] we're feasting on the body word of the
[1:20:52] son of man it says when you come
[1:20:55] together to eat
[1:20:56] tarry one for another
[1:21:01] don't just come to church looking at
[1:21:02] yourself
[1:21:04] but come to the altar
[1:21:07] say lord my sister laurie tamlinson
[1:21:12] lord my
[1:21:13] my brother jeremy
[1:21:15] you know come come for one another
[1:21:18] carry one for another let's get in one
[1:21:20] accord
[1:21:21] let's get the love of god moving in our
[1:21:23] midst
[1:21:24] we're getting out of here
[1:21:27] i don't want to stay here
[1:21:30] i want to go to that supper i'm hungry
[1:21:32] for that
[1:21:34] i want to see my jesus
[1:21:44] he's doing the work
[1:21:46] we just have to rest in him
[1:21:49] it's like in ruth 3 and 18
[1:21:53] if we can put that up
[1:21:58] ruth
[1:21:59] didn't rest just right away
[1:22:02] when she was in moab if she just rested
[1:22:04] there like orpha had
[1:22:07] her name would not be in the bible
[1:22:11] but she got to the right field
[1:22:14] she got to the right feet
[1:22:19] and then she found rest
[1:22:22] and her mother-in-law said sit still my
[1:22:24] daughter
[1:22:25] until thou know how the matter will fall
[1:22:28] for the man will not be in rest
[1:22:30] until he has finished the thing this day
[1:22:36] he that keepeth israel
[1:22:38] will not sleep
[1:22:42] we have one
[1:22:44] that's working to work in our lives
[1:22:47] where our movement's on the wrong track
[1:22:50] he can bring it right
[1:22:53] the things in our lives that are ugly
[1:22:55] the things that we can't handle
[1:22:57] he can make it all beautiful in his time
[1:23:01] just hold to his promises
[1:23:03] once ruth got to the right place right
[1:23:06] field the right feet
[1:23:09] sit down
[1:23:12] my daughter
[1:23:14] if we look at
[1:23:18] that scripture
[1:23:22] where it says
[1:23:28] it's the scripture let me find it here
[1:23:44] psalm 46 and 10.
[1:23:53] if we could put get that put up please
[1:23:57] it says be still
[1:24:00] and know that i am god
[1:24:06] i will be exalted among the heathen
[1:24:09] i will be exalted in the earth
[1:24:13] looked up what does that word be still
[1:24:14] mean it's one word in the original
[1:24:18] one of the ways it's translated is to
[1:24:20] fall limp
[1:24:24] to cease striving to become helpless
[1:24:27] to sink or to relax
[1:24:30] and just
[1:24:33] fall at his
[1:24:34] feet as if dead
[1:24:36] say lord
[1:24:38] i've committed it unto you
[1:24:41] i know you're able to keep that which
[1:24:43] i've committed it unto you
[1:24:46] what a rest
[1:24:50] it's worth it
[1:24:51] it's worth the striving
[1:24:53] it's worth the oil press
[1:24:55] the olive press
[1:24:59] also in that in that first scripture
[1:25:01] that we read
[1:25:02] in exodus
[1:25:05] it says the lord shall fight for you
[1:25:08] and ye shall hold your peace
[1:25:11] part of this rest is just to be quiet
[1:25:15] part of being still is just to be quiet
[1:25:19] that's the nature of our father
[1:25:22] for he was oppressed
[1:25:23] he was afflicted
[1:25:25] yet he opened not his mouth
[1:25:28] he's brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[1:25:30] as a sheep before her shears is dumb
[1:25:33] so he opened not his mouth
[1:25:38] that's the spirit that's in us
[1:25:41] not to complain or
[1:25:44] cause a fuss
[1:25:48] but let our words be life
[1:25:52] don't let us be that fountain that's
[1:25:53] trying to put out bitter water and sweet
[1:25:55] water
[1:25:56] but if you can't say something nice
[1:26:04] right
[1:26:06] his sheep know his voice
[1:26:09] and they're eating this book that they
[1:26:10] can prophesy again
[1:26:13] these lips
[1:26:14] in front of me i believe
[1:26:16] will speak the spoken word of god
[1:26:19] i believe they are
[1:26:23] let's watch what we're saying
[1:26:26] never let your confession be negative
[1:26:29] say good things to each other
[1:26:32] you can make it
[1:26:36] the lord can use you
[1:26:39] the lord is mindful of you
[1:26:42] lord cares for your loved ones
[1:26:45] speak good things
[1:26:48] speak those words that you know to be
[1:26:49] the words
[1:26:50] of your shepherd
[1:26:53] god has a purpose for your life
[1:26:58] to work the works of christ in you the
[1:27:00] greater works
[1:27:01] the same works that i do greater work so
[1:27:04] you do
[1:27:06] he wants to reach the lost with your
[1:27:07] hands and your feet and your love
[1:27:12] but to do that
[1:27:14] we've got to lose our own will
[1:27:18] in the in the sermon
[1:27:20] perfect strength by perfect weakness
[1:27:22] it's not that our weakness alone is
[1:27:24] adequate or perfect
[1:27:26] but as we can just surrender our
[1:27:28] weakness
[1:27:29] to god
[1:27:30] he can take that
[1:27:32] and he can turn it into perfect strength
[1:27:36] a lot of times we just say well i'm
[1:27:38] perfectly weak so let's uh let's carry
[1:27:39] on
[1:27:40] no it's not it's not trusting in your
[1:27:42] weakness it's not being arrogant in your
[1:27:45] inabilities
[1:27:47] but it's just surrendering
[1:27:50] it's going
[1:27:52] going and humbling ourselves
[1:27:54] and seeking him
[1:27:58] i thought of the quote it's from the
[1:28:00] church age book in the pergamum church
[1:28:01] age
[1:28:03] where
[1:28:05] says
[1:28:06] those in the bride
[1:28:08] do only his will
[1:28:10] no one can make them do otherwise
[1:28:13] they have thus saith lord
[1:28:15] or they keep still
[1:28:18] we get excited about that first part
[1:28:22] but we kind of skip the second part
[1:28:24] or they keep still
[1:28:39] let's read ecclesiastes 5 and 2.
[1:28:50] it says be not rash with thy mouth
[1:28:52] let not thy heart be hasty to utter
[1:28:55] anything before god
[1:28:57] for god is in heaven and now upon earth
[1:28:59] therefore let thy words be few
[1:29:04] preaching myself here i say a lot of
[1:29:05] stupid things
[1:29:08] but i believe this word will change me
[1:29:12] i believe he's going to help me to see
[1:29:13] the things that i need to let go of
[1:29:16] i believe that he's going to give me the
[1:29:18] strength to let go of those things
[1:29:24] the best form of rest the best form of
[1:29:27] stabilization is actually something
[1:29:29] that's moving
[1:29:32] that's what they've found
[1:29:34] is that if you just have something heavy
[1:29:35] well
[1:29:36] once it gets moving then it's probably
[1:29:37] going to stay moving because it has a
[1:29:39] lot of mass
[1:29:40] but to really keep something really
[1:29:42] stable and steady
[1:29:44] they use what's called gyroscopic
[1:29:46] stabilization
[1:29:48] if you've ever seen a gyroscope or or
[1:29:50] maybe you've ridden a bike and a bike is
[1:29:52] kind of a form of a gyroscope
[1:29:56] it's kind of like magic because it's
[1:29:58] this little top
[1:30:00] and as it's spinning on the inside
[1:30:04] it's rock solid on the outside
[1:30:06] it can bounce on anything balance on a
[1:30:08] string or a pencil
[1:30:10] they put them in sailboats
[1:30:12] so when the rough seas are going this
[1:30:14] gyroscope on the inside keeps the boat
[1:30:16] just always upright
[1:30:19] i thought isn't that like our rest
[1:30:23] that it's that life that's moving in us
[1:30:26] it's that holy spirit that's pulsating
[1:30:29] in his bride
[1:30:30] that just keeps us centered
[1:30:33] keeps us straight back to that
[1:30:35] cornerstone
[1:30:38] so let's keep moving let's keep still
[1:30:42] let's keep quiet
[1:30:44] let's keep believing
[1:30:48] first corinthians 15 and 58
[1:30:54] if the musicians would come
[1:30:58] it says therefore my beloved brethren
[1:31:01] be steadfast
[1:31:04] immovable
[1:31:07] always abounding in the work of the lord
[1:31:09] it's always moving
[1:31:12] but always still
[1:31:14] for as much as you know that your labor
[1:31:16] is not in vain
[1:31:18] in the lord
[1:31:24] i believe he's moving in our midst
[1:31:28] i believe our lives
[1:31:31] are revealing him
[1:31:33] i had a man a jewish man
[1:31:36] and he paid us a compliment our family
[1:31:39] got to see our family
[1:31:41] just being our family and he said
[1:31:44] i saw your people have god
[1:31:52] i believe we do have him
[1:31:54] let's make him known
[1:31:58] let's be pleasing to him
[1:32:01] let's become one with him we ought to be
[1:32:03] the happiest people
[1:32:05] on the face of the earth
[1:32:08] but that only a happiness that real
[1:32:10] happiness
[1:32:11] it's not a party frivolity
[1:32:14] but it's a deep settled peace and a joy
[1:32:19] that comes
[1:32:22] to gethsemane
[1:32:25] the weeping may endure for the night
[1:32:28] that's part of it
[1:32:30] but joy comes in the morning
[1:32:33] that there's a scripture that says rise
[1:32:35] and shine
[1:32:37] there's a people that's gonna do that
[1:32:39] there's a people that'll shine like the
[1:32:41] sun
[1:32:45] because they've been to the same garden
[1:32:48] they've carried the same cross
[1:32:51] they've got the same life in them
[1:32:56] that original seed that can't compromise
[1:32:58] can't mix
[1:33:00] but everything else will fall away
[1:33:03] everything else will be burned up
[1:33:09] it's a question for you
[1:33:12] are you lighter today
[1:33:14] than you were yesterday
[1:33:15] [Music]
[1:33:18] are you laying aside every weight
[1:33:22] are you ready for that blast off
[1:33:26] [Music]
[1:33:29] he's here
[1:33:31] if you want to deal with something i'm
[1:33:32] not going to make an altar call i
[1:33:34] already did that
[1:33:37] but that angel that jacob wrestled with
[1:33:39] until he was blessed he's here
[1:33:42] if you need to wrestle tonight
[1:33:45] it's a good night to wrestle
[1:33:47] if you need the great physician to cut
[1:33:49] something out of your life that you
[1:33:50] haven't been able to let go of
[1:33:53] i'll do surgery on you
[1:33:57] [Music]
[1:33:59] what would you deal with tonight
[1:34:02] if the blast off was in the morning
[1:34:07] let's just spend a little bit of time in
[1:34:09] gethsemane
[1:34:11] and see if there's anywhere that our
[1:34:12] will has
[1:34:13] has popped up
[1:34:15] and these prayers that you're asking if
[1:34:17] you're saying well i've been begging the
[1:34:18] lord
[1:34:20] operate on me take this from me
[1:34:23] remember what he told paul he didn't
[1:34:25] tell paul no
[1:34:27] and paul beside him three times
[1:34:31] he didn't tell paul no because i believe
[1:34:34] when we see paul again that thing is
[1:34:35] going to be gone
[1:34:39] but he said my grace is sufficient for
[1:34:42] thee
[1:34:43] which i think means something like not
[1:34:46] quite yet paul
[1:34:49] but i'll carry you until the time
[1:34:53] so just hold on
[1:34:55] don't be discouraged
[1:34:57] don't let anything move you from that
[1:34:58] rest
[1:35:01] i believe it's almost morning
[1:35:04] i believe the angels of the lord are
[1:35:06] encamped about us
[1:35:07] [Music]
[1:35:11] maybe we're closer to that side than we
[1:35:13] realized
[1:35:15] that we're closer to seeing brother
[1:35:17] green again
[1:35:19] your parents again
[1:35:22] [Music]
[1:35:25] he knows every
[1:35:26] prayer they're all precious to him so
[1:35:29] don't give up on him
[1:35:32] he won't give up on you
[1:35:34] [Music]
[1:35:37] let's just trust him
[1:35:40] let's pray
[1:35:46] oh father
[1:35:48] you only give good gifts
[1:35:51] help us to receive this gift of your
[1:35:53] rest
[1:35:54] father oh god move in a mighty way
[1:35:58] break down every stronghold
[1:36:02] every fear lord
[1:36:05] every devil that's bound your children
[1:36:07] lord set us free
[1:36:10] lord let us leave here lighter than we
[1:36:12] were when we came in
[1:36:15] more in love with you lord more filled
[1:36:17] with your spirit
[1:36:19] lord we want to be leaking your spirit
[1:36:22] leaking your light that would be just
[1:36:24] such a pressure of an over
[1:36:26] overflowing fountain in our lives lord
[1:36:30] if we could make you known lord
[1:36:32] [Music]
[1:36:34] that we could be ready for
[1:36:36] that appointment we believe we have with
[1:36:37] you lord to meet you in the air
[1:36:40] forgive us the lord of our sins where
[1:36:42] we've disbelieved you lord
[1:36:44] help us to say i do
[1:36:45] [Music]
[1:36:49] lord every need here i don't know them
[1:36:51] but they're precious to you

[1:39:02] release my cares
[1:39:05] the more you take control
[1:39:09] the more that i can humble myself
[1:39:14] the more you lift me up
[1:39:18] every day i live lord i love you
[1:39:27] oh the more that i

[1:39:51] the more
[1:39:52] you
[1:39:54] [Music]
[1:40:04] you know when we have a visiting
[1:40:05] minister
[1:40:08] we always ask him to stay and
[1:40:10] minister to the people
[1:40:12] and i just felt my heart does somebody
[1:40:14] need prayer
[1:40:17] tonight
[1:40:18] maybe you're struggling with something
[1:40:19] you just can't seem to let it go and god
[1:40:22] has used brother peter to speak
[1:40:24] maybe god can use brother peter to pray
[1:40:26] with you
[1:40:28] sometimes we just need some help
[1:40:31] i don't know i just just felt to to make
[1:40:33] that call to somebody
[1:40:36] and just say lord there are some things
[1:40:38] in my life
[1:40:39] i need to get past
[1:40:41] and have somebody minister for you under
[1:40:44] that same anointing so
[1:40:46] [Music]
[1:40:48] it's just
[1:40:50] just while he's being prayed for you
[1:40:52] pray for him also saying lord
[1:40:55] minister

[1:40:57] allow the
[1:40:58] brother to minister
[1:41:00] through prayer
[1:41:01] something that would give deliverance
[1:41:03] and help
[1:41:06] [Music]

[1:42:39] don't fret
[1:42:41] don't trouble yourself don't be anxious
[1:42:44] don't get to a point where you you so
[1:42:46] work yourself up trying to bring
[1:42:49] something to pass but let god be god
[1:42:52] let him be god he is more than able he
[1:42:56] can minister and do things in a way that
[1:42:58] we would never believe you would never
[1:43:00] put it that way
[1:43:02] he can take one and make a million out
[1:43:04] of it
[1:43:06] a whole lot
[1:43:07] easier
[1:43:09] or maybe as often we make a million into
[1:43:11] one when we make a mess out of it
[1:43:14] but god can take one into a million
[1:43:17] if we just cast our cares upon you
[1:43:20] if you'll stand with
[1:43:22] me you know and when somebody prays over
[1:43:26] you and you've asked
[1:43:28] stand on that
[1:43:29] believe it
[1:43:30] say god i've committed to you and i'm
[1:43:33] gonna rest in that
[1:43:36] rest is not laying around and doing
[1:43:37] nothing
[1:43:39] rest just giving it over to god
[1:43:42] you have you have a life to live
[1:43:44] you you have a testimony to be
[1:43:47] but there's peace in being that when you
[1:43:48] give it over to god you let him speak
[1:43:51] and let him work
[1:43:53] amen
[1:43:54] i thank the lord for the word of god
[1:43:56] today that reaches to our hearts and say
[1:43:58] hey i care for you
[1:44:00] i love you
[1:44:01] and and
[1:44:02] i thought that
[1:44:04] i said at first when he made that
[1:44:05] statement he said are you heavier than
[1:44:07] you were i said oh my he's going to get
[1:44:08] in trouble for that
[1:44:10] but no
[1:44:11] cast all your cares let all those things
[1:44:13] go aside and say lord you know here i am
[1:44:17] amen
[1:44:18] i've anchored my soul in the haven of
[1:44:20] rest
[1:44:24] what is it it's a place to rest
[1:44:27] after the ship has gone through the sea
[1:44:30] the battle is the place to come in and
[1:44:32] rest
[1:44:34] let's do the chorus there
[1:44:36] i've
[1:44:38] hankered my soul
[1:44:42] in the hat

[1:45:35] [Music]
[1:45:50] foreign
[1:45:53] [Music]
[1:46:00] when you learn how to work with the
[1:46:02] equipment you work with whatever you do
[1:46:05] maybe in construction it's a hammer it's
[1:46:07] a
[1:46:08] but you let learn to let the tool do the
[1:46:10] work
[1:46:12] rather than you try to force it
[1:46:15] you know it works better i i found out
