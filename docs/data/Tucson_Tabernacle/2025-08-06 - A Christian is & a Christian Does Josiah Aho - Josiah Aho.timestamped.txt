[3:38] praise him because even in your worst
[3:41] position, he's already been there and
[3:43] taken care of it. So, we appreciate
[3:45] that.
[3:47] Where could I go but to the Lord? You
[3:51] know, it's I like that first. You know,
[3:53] life here is grand and it is. It's
[3:55] wonderful to be a Christian, but when
[3:57] everything goes, we can go to him.
[4:03] Oh, living below
[4:07] in this old sinful world,
[4:11] hardly a comfort can afford.
[4:18] Striving alone
[4:21] to face temptation. Go.
[4:25] Where could I go but to the Lord?
[4:31] Oh, where could I go? Oh, where could I
[4:37] go?
[4:38] Seeking a refuge for my soul.
[4:45] Needing a friend to help me in the end.
[4:52] Where could I go but to the Lord?
[4:58] And neighbors are kind. I love them.
[5:03] Everyone
[5:05] we get along in sweet a cold.
[5:12] But when my soul needs mana from above,
[5:18] where could I go but to the Lord?
[5:25] Oh, where could I go?
[5:28] Oh, where could I go?
[5:32] Seeking a refuge for my soul.
[5:38] Needing a friend to help me in the end.
[5:45] Where could I go but to alone?
[5:51] And life here is grand with friends I
[5:55] love so dear.
[5:58] Comfort I get from God's own word.
[6:04] And yet when I face the chilling hand of
[6:09] death,
[6:11] where could I go but to the Lord?
[6:17] Where could I go?
[6:20] Oh, where could I go?
[6:24] Needing a refuge for my soul.
[6:31] Brother Ed, if you would come on up
[6:34] in the end,
[6:37] where could I go but to the Lord?
[6:44] Where could I go?
[6:47] Where could I go?
[6:50] Seeking a refuge for my soul.
[6:57] Needing a friend to help me in the end.
[7:03] Where could I go but to the Lord?
[7:10] Brother Ed is is going to share a
[7:13] request that they have and also open in

[10:36] sister hope when we finish this if
[10:38] you'll make ready to come up.
[10:50] I'm sorry I had the wrong song in mind.
[10:52] As I journey through the land, singing
[10:56] as I go,
[10:58] pointing souls to Calvary, to the
[11:02] crimson flow.
[11:04] Many arrows pierce my soul from without.
[11:10] But my Lord leads me on. Through him I
[11:14] must wind. And oh, I want to see him.
[11:19] Look upon his face
[11:22] there to sing forever
[11:25] of his saving grace.

[11:33] voice. Cares all past home at last ever
[11:38] to rejoice
[11:40] when in service for my Lord. Dark may be
[11:44] the night,
[11:46] but I'll cling more close to him. He
[11:50] will give me light.
[11:52] Satan snares may vex my soul. Turn my
[11:56] thoughts aside.
[11:58] But my Lord goes ahead, lead every time.

[12:09] face.
[12:11] to sing forever
[12:14] of his saving grace.

[12:19] let me lift my bones.
[12:22] Hairs all pass home at last ever to
[12:27] rejoice.
[12:30] And when bellies low, I look towards a
[12:34] mountain high.
[12:36] And behold my savior there leading in
[12:40] the fire.
[12:42] With a tender hand I'll stretch towards
[12:45] the valley lowing
[12:49] me. I can see as I onward go.

[13:00] there to sing forever
[13:03] of his saving grace.
[13:06] On the streets of glory,
[13:09] let me lift my bones.
[13:12] Cares all past home at last ever to
[13:16] rejoice.
[13:18] And when before bills rise from the
[13:22] mighty knee,
[13:25] then my lord directs my bi to safely
[13:29] keep.
[13:31] And he leads me gently on through this
[13:35] world to know.
[13:37] He's a real friend to me. And oh, I love
[13:41] him so.
[13:43] Oh, I want to see him. Look upon his
[13:47] face.

[14:24] cares all past home at last ever to
[14:29] rejoice.
[14:32] Cares all pass home at last ever to
[14:37] rejoice.

[17:42] but all through
[17:44] the night,
[17:47] some through
[17:49] great sorrow.
[17:52] But God gives a song
[17:57] in the night season

[18:09] No sorrows

[20:42] [Music]
[20:49] [Applause]
[20:52] Amen. Amen. just reminds me of something
[20:55] I was watching the other probably I
[20:57] think it was National Geographic the
[20:59] mother bear leading her little cubs
[21:02] across the street crossing the road and
[21:05] she stops and she looks back and they're
[21:08] not paying a lot of attention. They're
[21:09] running around but she stayed there
[21:11] until they came over. Sometimes we go
[21:14] this way he goes that way but he's still
[21:16] watching over us. Do appreciate that.
[21:19] You know, I know who holds tomorrow and
[21:23] I know he holds my hand.
[21:28] I don't know.
[21:36] I just live
[21:39] from day to day.
[21:43] I don't borrow
[21:46] from it sunshine.
[21:49] for its skies
[21:52] may turn to gray.
[21:56] I don't worry.
[21:59] Your birth of future
[22:03] for I know
[22:05] what Jesus said.
[22:09] And today
[22:12] I'll walk beside him.
[22:15] for he knows
[22:18] what is ahead.
[22:22] Many things
[22:25] about tomorrow
[22:28] I don't seem
[22:31] to understand.
[22:35] But I know
[22:37] who holds tomorrow.
[22:41] And I know
[22:44] he holds my hand.
[22:47] Every step
[22:50] is getting bright.
[22:54] As the golden
[22:57] stairs I climb,
[23:00] every birden's
[23:03] getting lighter.
[23:06] Every cloud
[23:09] is silver light.
[23:12] There the sun
[23:15] is always shining.
[23:19] There no tear
[23:21] will dim in the eyes
[23:25] at the ending
[23:28] of the rainbow
[23:31] where the mouth
[23:34] can touch the sky.
[23:38] many things
[23:40] about tomorrow.
[23:44] I don't seem
[23:46] to understand,
[23:50] but I know
[23:53] who holds tomorrow.
[23:56] And I know
[23:59] who holds my hand.
[24:03] I don't know
[24:06] about tomorrow.
[24:09] It may bring
[24:12] me poverty,
[24:15] but the one
[24:18] who feeds a sparrow
[24:21] is the one
[24:24] who stands by me.
[24:28] And the path
[24:30] that is my portion
[24:34] may be through
[24:36] the flame or flood.
[24:40] But his present
[24:43] go before me
[24:46] and I'm covered
[24:49] with his blood.
[24:52] many things
[24:55] about tomorrow.
[24:58] I don't seem
[25:01] to understand,
[25:04] but I know
[25:07] who holds tomorrow.
[25:11] And I know
[25:14] who holds my hand, Lord. Oh many things
[25:20] about tomorrow
[25:23] I don't see
[25:26] to understand
[25:29] but I know
[25:32] who holds my
[25:38] holds my hand.
[25:42] He's holding my hand every day. He's
[25:45] holding my hand and he's walking me on
[25:48] through it. A lot of times I don't
[25:49] notice that he's holding my hand, but
[25:51] then many times I'll look back and see
[25:53] where I've come from and I say, "Yeah,
[25:56] Lord, you are holding my hand the whole
[25:58] way." God bless you, Brother Daniel.
[26:00] Good to see you on a Wednesday night.
[26:02] And then, Sister Stephanie there in the
[26:03] back, God bless you. It's good to see
[26:05] you. It's um we're we're a bit sparse
[26:09] tonight on this Wednesday night. There's
[26:11] a lot of people missing. Um, do pray for
[26:14] I forgot to mention uh Lionel and Lonnie
[26:19] Salazar. They're up in the fire and
[26:21] they're providing support, but that's a
[26:24] monstrous fire up on the north rim of
[26:25] the Grand Canyon. So, please remember
[26:28] them when you're praying. And I did
[26:31] mention uh Eric Davis, also this young
[26:34] man that uh Sister Mercy Samurano's
[26:38] grandson.
[26:39] He's incarcerated in Yuma and the family
[26:43] would really like to get him here to
[26:44] Tucson so they can visit him and he's
[26:46] he's been there's just some fearful
[26:49] things in prison. There's there's gangs
[26:51] there and he's not doesn't really feel
[26:54] like he's quite fitting in.
[26:57] So, he uh he would appreciate the
[26:58] prayers. He's lost about 20 pounds. It's
[27:01] just it's been hard on him. But like I
[27:03] said in my my broadcast this morning,
[27:06] Jonah made some bad decisions. One
[27:09] particular bad decision that caused all
[27:12] kinds of problems, but then God turned
[27:15] it around and he made it a great
[27:16] blessing. So I pray that uh this Eric
[27:20] Davis um I met him. I I um would visit
[27:24] him when he was here in the in the jail
[27:28] and um he he's just
[27:33] he needs to change his life around. And
[27:36] I believe that this was the mercy of God
[27:38] has done it. And uh I believe he's a son
[27:41] of God with all my heart. And I just
[27:45] can't wait to see him out and serving
[27:47] the Lord. And uh I'm looking forward to
[27:49] seeing miracles in his life. So don't
[27:51] don't forget to pray for uh Brother Eric
[27:53] Davis.
[27:55] And um
[27:58] I uh happy to have my little girl here.
[28:02] She's
[28:04] [Applause]
[28:06] she's holding my grandbaby until the end
[28:10] of December and then she's going to let
[28:13] us hold it.
[28:15] Good to see you, sweetheart. Nice. Nice
[28:17] to have you here. Um Maline came in for
[28:20] my grandma's funeral that's going to be
[28:23] this um she got here early. Uh we had to
[28:26] put the funeral off till next Friday,
[28:29] but she wanted to be with the family.
[28:31] And Sister Wheeler, 98 years old.
[28:34] Brother Wheeler, my grandpa was a deacon
[28:36] in Brother Brandham's church. They um
[28:39] just I'll tell you what I've ever if
[28:42] I've ever seen an example of how a
[28:45] Christian should live. I see that in my
[28:48] grandpa and my grandpa Wheeler. They
[28:50] were just
[28:53] I mean perfect is is pretty a high
[28:57] level, but they were as perfect as a
[28:59] human can be. I think just wonderful,
[29:01] wonderful people. A lot of love and love
[29:04] the Lord Jesus with all their hearts.
[29:06] and the Lord has seen fit after 98 years
[29:10] to take grandma home. So that will and
[29:12] and everybody's welcome. We're going to
[29:14] have just a short graveside funeral next
[29:17] Friday. Not this Friday, but next Friday
[29:20] at um East Lawn Palms funeral. It's not
[29:23] even in the funeral home. It's going to
[29:24] be right at the graveside. So um if uh
[29:28] if you'd like to go, you're welcome to.
[29:30] I'll be officiating and I'll just
[29:33] minister just a short message and uh we
[29:36] will put grandma to rest with the
[29:39] promise that she is going to rise again
[29:43] um
[29:50] for tonight for our brother Josiah.
[29:53] He's I'm looking forward to hearing him
[29:56] speak. I usually choose the topics that
[29:58] we we minister on on Wednesday night and
[30:02] I'll choose a series um whether it be
[30:05] the Bible or you know from book by book
[30:07] or whether it be the book of Acts. Um
[30:12] we lately been on David and Saul but I
[30:16] wanted Josiah just to feel at liberty
[30:19] and I told him just minister what's on
[30:22] your heart. I was I've been thinking
[30:23] about getting into the book of Timothy
[30:25] and I Josiah kind of reminds me of
[30:27] Timothy in the Bible and and I said, you
[30:30] know, you could you could go through his
[30:32] life, you go through Timothy or just
[30:34] whatever whatever is on your heart. And
[30:35] brother Josiah,
[30:37] he had it on his heart
[30:40] um to minister on uh
[30:43] a Christian is and a Christian does.
[30:47] And I'm looking forward to him. Brother
[30:49] Josiah, if you could uh make ready.
[30:52] I think that we're going to be blessed.
[30:54] I want to give our young men a chance to
[30:58] come up and and minister. And and Josiah
[31:01] is he's very knowledgeable in the word
[31:04] and he he he's always quoting Bible
[31:07] verses to me and I can see a deep
[31:10] understanding in the young man and I'm
[31:14] very much looking forward to hearing him
[31:16] tonight. So, let's all stand.
[31:20] Welcome
[31:22] our brother Josiah. He usually stands
[31:24] before us and leads us in worship. And
[31:27] now he's going to lead us in expounding
[31:31] on the word. Brother Aaron told me that
[31:34] he was looking through the website and
[31:37] he saw
[31:40] Josiah Ao ministering and Daniel Evans
[31:43] leading worship.
[31:46] You laugh. You think that's funny,
[31:48] Sister Elizabeth.
[31:49] [Laughter]
[31:53] &gt;&gt; I told him I was looking forward to this
[31:55] service.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; But Aaron said he was looking forward to
[31:57] this service.
[31:59] So, no, that was a typo. I forgot Junior
[32:03] on the back on the back of Daniel. But
[32:05] God bless you, brothers and sisters.
[32:07] It's my honor to introduce our young
[32:10] brother Josiah to come up here and
[32:13] expound upon the word of the Lord. Yes,
[32:17] brother Aaron, if you could lead us.
[32:20] All to Jesus
[32:24] I surrender.
[32:27] Oh, to him I free.
[32:34] I will ever look and trust in
[32:41] his presence day.
[32:46] I surrender
[32:49] all.
[32:52] I surrender
[32:55] all.
[32:58] All to thee, my blessed
[33:03] Savior,
[33:05] I surrender
[33:08] all.
[33:11] Last the very last verse.
[33:13] [Music]
[33:17] All to Jesus
[33:20] I surrender
[33:23] now I feel the sacred flame.
[33:30] Oh the joy of full salvation.
[33:36] Glory
[33:38] gloryy
[33:39] to him.
[33:44] Surrender all.
[33:48] I surrender
[33:51] all.
[33:54] All to thee, my blessed
[33:59] Savior.
[34:01] I surrender.
[34:06] I need you, Lord.
[34:09] I need you, Lord,
[34:12] right now.
[34:18] Oh, I need you, Lord.
[34:22] I need you, Lord,
[34:24] right now. Make it your prayer this
[34:28] evening.
[34:30] Oh, I lift my hands,
[34:33] bow my knees
[34:36] in worship at your throne.
[34:41] I need you, Lord.
[34:44] I need you, Lord, right now. Let's sing
[34:48] that again. I need you, Lord.
[34:52] I need you, Lord.
[34:55] I need you, Lord. right now.
[35:02] Oh, I need you, Lord.
[35:07] I need you, Lord, right now.
[35:14] Oh, I lift my hands.
[35:18] I bow my knees
[35:20] in worship at your throne.
[35:26] I need you, Lord.
[35:29] I need you, Lord, right now.
[35:35] Let's pray.
[35:38] Lord Jesus, thank you for this Wednesday
[35:40] night service. Thank you for everyone
[35:41] that's here, Lord Jesus, and everyone
[35:43] that's streaming.
[35:45] Thank you for this building full of
[35:47] wonderful air conditioning that we have,
[35:49] Lord, these pews, this piano, this
[35:52] church, Lord.
[35:54] Let us never be ungrateful for what we
[35:57] have, Lord Jesus.
[36:00] Lord, I've heard it said, if we never
[36:03] got anything else given to us this life,
[36:06] we'd still have so much to be thankful
[36:09] for.
[36:10] We couldn't we couldn't thank you enough
[36:13] for how much you've blessed us.
[36:16] Thank you, Lord, for all you do, Lord.
[36:18] Truly, tonight, we need you. Each one of
[36:21] us needs you. I need you tonight, Lord
[36:23] Jesus. If your presence would be here
[36:25] with us tonight, that's all that
[36:27] matters, Lord.
[36:30] We thank you for all these things in
[36:32] Jesus name. Amen. You can all have your
[36:36] seats. Thank you very much.
[36:41] We need him, don't we? Every day, every
[36:44] day of our lives. You know what we don't
[36:46] need is these.
[36:49] We think a lot of times that we need
[36:51] them and I understand for work and many
[36:54] things, but I I want to tell a story. We
[36:58] were just camping
[36:59] and um I asked my dad one time about
[37:04] their camping trips as a kid. He said
[37:07] they would go to Lake Diablo in
[37:09] Washington and Baker Lake. There's two
[37:12] beautiful crystal blue lakes in
[37:14] Washington.
[37:15] And my grandpa would go first the night
[37:18] before. I don't know why they always did
[37:21] this, but this is what their system
[37:22] would be. He would he would go first and
[37:25] they would always get the campsites that
[37:27] you had to take a boat to. My grandpa
[37:29] loved doing stuff hard. He was an
[37:31] archery hunter. And when they camped, he
[37:33] liked to have to park on the side of the
[37:35] road and then take a boat across the
[37:37] lake to the campsite. And they have
[37:39] those spots. You can only get to them by
[37:40] boat. So, my grandpa would go the day
[37:42] before
[37:44] and the next day my grandma would come
[37:48] with the kids and sometimes my dad would
[37:50] go with my grandpa to help set up. And
[37:54] my grandpa would get there and I thought
[37:56] to myself, "So, did did grandma know
[38:00] exactly on the road where to go? Did she
[38:03] see the truck?" No. Because the truck
[38:06] was actually parked a little ways up, so
[38:08] it's not clear where you cross. Well,
[38:11] you didn't have phones, so how did she
[38:12] find you? And my dad said, my grandpa
[38:15] literally stood on the other side of the
[38:18] lake, a mile away, with a mirror, and
[38:21] when he saw her car coming, he flashed
[38:23] the mirror and she stopped.
[38:27] Let me just say, we don't need these.
[38:31] They figured it out. They It worked.
[38:34] They were able to do it. And I said, "My
[38:36] grandpa's incredible. how on and my
[38:38] grandma for seeing a a flash from the
[38:41] road, a tiny little mirror a half a mile
[38:44] away has nothing to do with what I'm
[38:47] talking about tonight. It just it
[38:49] relaxes me to tell a story before we get
[38:51] started. So, um I told brother Daniel
[38:55] that that was my title. Uh what a
[38:58] Christian is and what a Christian does.
[39:01] So, we're going to read when you're
[39:03] reading about what a Christian is and
[39:07] what a Christian is supposed to do. Um,
[39:11] what a where where better to start than
[39:13] Psalms. So, let's start in Psalms 19.
[39:19] Last time I spoke for a few minutes on a
[39:21] Sunday night and I did Psalms 1
[39:24] and I've just been going through the
[39:26] Psalms and Psalms 19 was one that I
[39:29] spent a great deal of time on.
[39:33] And so we're going to go through a
[39:34] couple verses here
[39:41] and let's go to the very last verse.
[39:48] Psalms 19:14.
[39:58] Let the words of my mouth and the
[40:00] meditation of my heart be acceptable
[40:06] in thy sight, oh Lord, my strength and
[40:10] my redeemer.
[40:13] Let's read that again. Let's read it
[40:14] together.
[40:16] Let the words of my mouth and the
[40:18] meditation of my heart be acceptable in
[40:22] thy sight, oh Lord, my strength and my
[40:26] redeemer.
[40:27] This is a prayer as are a lot of the
[40:29] psalms.
[40:31] And I want to start first by saying
[40:34] um
[40:36] saying what this does not say.
[40:39] This does not say
[40:41] accept me as I am
[40:44] or Lord receive me like this or I'm
[40:48] going to do my thing and the Lord will
[40:49] just understand me. That's not what it
[40:52] says. It can be misinterpreted to mean
[40:54] that. But on the other on the other
[40:57] extreme, those are obviously wrong.
[40:59] Obviously, we know that's not what it's
[41:01] saying. But on the other extreme, it's
[41:03] not saying if my words are righteous
[41:06] enough, he'll receive me. And it's not
[41:09] saying, "Lord, look at my good faith or
[41:13] hear how I word my prayers so
[41:15] perfectly."
[41:16] It's saying, "Change me to line up with
[41:20] you. Change me, oh God." And it's it's
[41:23] almost desperate. Lord, let the words of
[41:26] my mouth and the meditation of my heart
[41:28] just be acceptable in thy sight, oh
[41:31] Lord, my strength and my redeemer. David
[41:34] is saying, "Change me. Change my way of
[41:37] thinking. Change my way of speaking to
[41:40] be pleasing to you, to line up with you.
[41:43] And not only the words I speak,
[41:46] change what I think in my heart, change
[41:50] what I feel in my heart, the things I
[41:52] that come from within. Change those.
[41:54] Because we can all change the way we
[41:55] talk.
[41:57] But he's saying, Lord, change me from
[41:59] within. Change what change what I can't
[42:01] change. Lord, may may the meditation of
[42:04] my heart be acceptable in thy sight.
[42:08] That's the change. Change me, oh God.
[42:13] So, you can look back at the previous
[42:14] verse. Let's go back to verse 13.
[42:19] When I was reading through this, this
[42:21] chapter kind of made sense to me when I
[42:24] went to the end and went backwards.
[42:27] This is a trick I I have. My brain might
[42:30] just be
[42:32] off. But brother Biscll told us one
[42:36] time, he's my pastor growing up. He told
[42:37] us, "If you don't understand a verse,
[42:39] sometimes skip to the end and then go
[42:43] backwards.
[42:44] Read that verse, get it in your head,
[42:46] and then go back to the one and go
[42:48] back." And sometimes, you know, if you
[42:50] don't understand it the one way, you can
[42:52] get it going back. So, we just read
[42:56] about the words of my mouth and the
[42:58] meditation of my heart. So the verse
[43:00] before, keep back thy servant also from
[43:03] presumptuous sins.
[43:05] Again, this is a this is a request. This
[43:08] is a prayer. This is Lord, help me.
[43:11] Things that are obviously sins, I need
[43:14] help, Lord, that they won't have
[43:16] dominion over me. Then shall I be
[43:19] upright and shall be innocent from the
[43:21] great transgression. Let them not have
[43:24] dominion over me. This is one that has
[43:27] recognized something. They recognize
[43:29] that they can't do these things on their
[43:31] own strength and rather than relying on
[43:34] their own strength, I'll rely on his.
[43:37] That's always the better route.
[43:39] So now let's go back to verse seven.
[43:42] This isn't a usual
[43:46] pattern of ways. We'll read it the right
[43:50] way after, but uh the law of the Lord is
[43:54] perfect,
[43:56] converting the soul. We hear a lot about
[43:58] the law and how there's the letter of
[44:00] the law and we don't have to live by the
[44:03] law. We have grace and we don't have to
[44:07] think about the law. It says the law of
[44:10] the Lord is perfect converting the soul.
[44:14] So the law of the Lord is perfect
[44:16] not because we're robots and it gets
[44:19] programmed in us and we have no choice
[44:21] but because it's actually the intent is
[44:24] to change from within. converting the
[44:27] soul
[44:28] and the testimony of the Lord is sure,
[44:33] making wise the simple.
[44:36] So, if I could say it like this, um,
[44:41] this has a track record of working. If
[44:43] you read it in the Amplified, it says
[44:45] something like, um, you can count on
[44:48] this. It it has a specific word that
[44:50] it's reliable. says it has a track
[44:53] record of working for people who maybe
[44:57] nothing else works in your life. This
[45:00] works. This works. The law of the Lord,
[45:03] it converts the soul. It goes beyond
[45:05] just memorizing, just knowing and it
[45:08] goes to the goes to the heart and it
[45:10] goes to the soul and it makes it makes
[45:13] dummies like me even a little more wise.
[45:19] Verse eight.
[45:22] Am I putting you to sleep yet? Okay. The
[45:26] statutes of the Lord are right,
[45:29] rejoicing the heart,
[45:32] the commandment of the Lord is pure,
[45:34] enlightening the eyes.
[45:38] And though we say, and maybe we really
[45:40] do believe that we would trust the Lord
[45:41] blindly, this verse says his
[45:44] commandments bring understanding. says
[45:47] they enlighten the eyes. You will
[45:49] actually understand
[45:51] he this this is to help you
[45:53] understanding. We can have times when we
[45:55] don't understand and the Lord wants us
[45:57] to trust him. I believe in that. But
[46:00] this says it enlightens the eyes.
[46:03] This will bring you understanding. This
[46:05] will help you
[46:07] and it helps us to understand his heart.
[46:11] So why should I trust him is a question
[46:14] someone could ask. Verse nine,
[46:19] the fear of the Lord is clean,
[46:22] enduring forever.
[46:24] The judgments of the Lord are true and
[46:28] righteous altogether. Can you say that
[46:31] about any politician or judge or officer
[46:35] as just as they may be? Their judgments
[46:39] are true and righteous altogether.
[46:42] Verse 10.
[46:45] More to be desired are they than gold.
[46:49] Judgments, statutes, commandments,
[46:52] they're more to be desired than gold.
[46:55] Sweeter also than honey and the
[46:57] honeycomb.
[47:00] I could say this isn't like any earthly
[47:02] principle or law I've ever heard of.
[47:06] Perfect judgments, never failing,
[47:09] better than money, better than pleasure.
[47:13] And this isn't even in the context of
[47:15] eternal life. This is to help you on
[47:18] earth. This is to help you in your
[47:19] earthly journey.
[47:22] This is something and the verse says
[47:24] it's better than money. It will be more
[47:26] helpful in your life's journey to fear
[47:28] the Lord and keep his commandments.
[47:32] Money isn't as good as this. As I said,
[47:34] pleasure won't help you like this well
[47:36] like this will. And verse 11 says,
[47:38] "Also, or moreover, by them is thy
[47:43] servant warned,
[47:45] and in keeping of them there is great
[47:48] reward."
[47:51] Having this in your mind, heart, and
[47:53] soul will help you do the right things.
[47:58] You if you just read through the Psalms
[48:00] many times, it's about meditation. It's
[48:02] about praying. It's about thinking about
[48:04] these things. God did not intend for us
[48:08] to just rely on going to church on
[48:10] Sunday or
[48:13] whatever outlet you have to plug into.
[48:16] If you don't have that outlet to plug
[48:18] into,
[48:20] it's written on your heart. If you
[48:22] meditate on these things, when something
[48:24] comes up in the spur of the moment and
[48:26] you have it so near and dear to your
[48:28] heart, that's why David was a man after
[48:30] God's own heart. He said the law of the
[48:34] Lord, it converts the soul. It changes
[48:37] you from within. This is deeper, like I
[48:39] said, than just coming to church. This
[48:42] should be written on every believer's
[48:43] heart. And we should be thinking about
[48:46] it.
[48:48] And I said earlier, why should we why
[48:51] should we trust him?
[48:53] In keeping of them, there is great
[48:55] reward.
[48:56] This is something. There's commandments
[48:58] with promise that your days may be long
[49:00] on the earth, but beyond that into
[49:02] eternal life, keeping this, there is
[49:05] great reward.
[49:08] I I really hope you didn't come to hear
[49:10] something deep tonight.
[49:13] This is just reading what I believe
[49:17] God's prophet wrote here in the in the
[49:19] book of Psalms, thinking about each
[49:21] word. Is that okay? Is that all right?
[49:26] having this in your mind, heart, soul.
[49:30] Amen.
[49:32] Verse 12.
[49:36] Who can understand his errors?
[49:39] Cleanse thou me from secret faults? So
[49:42] that first question, who can understand
[49:44] his errors? Confuse me at first. Because
[49:47] it's not talking about the Lord. It's
[49:48] not saying who can understand his
[49:50] errors. It's saying what person can
[49:53] understand their own mistakes without
[49:56] something to
[49:58] without a lighthouse, without something
[50:00] to point them to what's right. Um, one
[50:03] that happens to me almost weekly at
[50:07] least if I'm working
[50:10] is um
[50:13] if I am finishing a job and I want to
[50:16] take the short route almost always
[50:20] the scripture do everything as as unto
[50:23] the Lord. And I want to just take the
[50:25] shortcut. I don't need to sprinkle sand
[50:27] on this part. I did the entire area. I
[50:31] can leave out this corner because I'm
[50:33] tired. It's hot. I want to go home. And
[50:35] then it always hits me. No,
[50:39] do this job as if you're doing this job
[50:42] for Jesus. As if whatever whatever your
[50:45] work is, as if the person or whatever
[50:48] you're serving is literally for the
[50:50] Lord. That's an example of who can
[50:53] understand his errors. If if you don't
[50:57] have something to point you to what's
[50:58] right, many people would say, "Hey,
[51:01] there's nothing wrong with taking the
[51:02] shortcut." And and maybe there isn't.
[51:04] Maybe there isn't. But it always comes
[51:06] to my mind. I need to be doing this as
[51:09] unto the Lord.
[51:11] And then cleanse thou me from secret
[51:13] faults. And then we're about to get back
[51:16] to where we started, but cleanse thou me
[51:18] from secret faults. The more I thought
[51:20] about it, the more it made me just want
[51:23] to fall on my knees and say, "Lord, I'm
[51:24] so sorry."
[51:26] Think about the things you might not
[51:28] even know that were displeasing to the
[51:31] Lord in your life, in my life. Lord
[51:35] Jesus, I'm so sorry. I don't even know
[51:38] something maybe I didn't do that I was
[51:40] supposed to do. And then the next verse
[51:43] says to the other extreme, "Keep back
[51:46] thy servant also from presumptuous sins,
[51:50] from obvious wrongs, from things that
[51:53] are clearly wrong, clearly I messed up,
[51:57] both extremes,
[52:00] the things that I didn't even know I did
[52:02] wrong. And Lord, the things obviously
[52:03] wrong. Let them not have dominion over
[52:06] me."
[52:08] That's a good prayer. Let these things,
[52:10] Lord, you know I struggle with this. Let
[52:12] it not have dominion over me. And then I
[52:16] shall be innocent. I shall be upright
[52:18] and I shall be innocent from the great
[52:20] transgression.
[52:23] I just want to say for a minute
[52:26] um James 5:16,
[52:29] cleanse thou me from secret faults. Um,
[52:32] it says uh in James 5 verse 16,
[52:38] I think it's a habit I have because I
[52:40] lead songs that I wait for them to put
[52:42] the scripture up on the screen before I
[52:44] go. I can't read it. It's right here. I
[52:46] can read it, but I just wait for the
[52:48] next verse. Confess your faults one to
[52:51] another, and pray one for another that
[52:53] ye may be healed.
[52:56] The effectual, fervent prayer of a
[52:57] righteous man avaleth much. And the
[53:01] verse in Psalms that we just read says,
[53:02] "Cleanse me from secret faults." It's
[53:04] interesting that James 5:16
[53:07] says, "Confess your faults. Tell others
[53:09] you messed up."
[53:12] And uh this doesn't necessarily mean you
[53:16] always have to go around telling
[53:17] everybody what a horrible person you
[53:19] are, but to your brothers and sisters
[53:22] here at church that you can rely on,
[53:26] you can count on each other.
[53:29] what you're struggling with. You can be
[53:30] honest when you make a mistake. And it's
[53:33] actually when you read this, it doesn't
[53:36] seem it doesn't feel like a con like a
[53:38] like a suggestion. It it feels kind of
[53:41] like a
[53:43] confess your faults one to another and
[53:45] pray for one another.
[53:50] Be there to listen to when somebody
[53:51] needs to talk and then pray for one
[53:53] another. It doesn't say go talk about it
[53:56] to the other ones in the church.
[53:59] Pray for your brother. Pray for your
[54:01] sister that you may be healed.
[54:05] Um, I've heard it said before,
[54:09] uh, that the line of people to criticize
[54:12] is really long, and the line of people
[54:14] to gossip is really long, and the line
[54:17] of people to sympathize is a lot
[54:19] shorter, and the line of people to help
[54:21] is almost empty.
[54:24] What a shame.
[54:27] We should be hitting our knees
[54:29] immediately when we know that somebody
[54:31] is struggling. That should be and it's
[54:34] saying this is like vinegar for me
[54:36] because I'm so guilty of this. Just, oh
[54:39] man, did you hear about this? And it's
[54:41] like I haven't even prayed for that
[54:43] person yet and I'm already spreading
[54:44] this.
[54:46] That's not how we should be. It says
[54:48] confess your faults to one another and
[54:50] pray one for another that you may be
[54:52] healed.
[54:55] And we do the exact opposite.
[54:59] Uh I think somebody maybe said this
[55:01] here, maybe brother Daniel a while back
[55:02] and it stuck with me. As humans, we do
[55:05] the opposite of confessing our faults.
[55:08] We tell each other all the good things
[55:11] that we've done and all the things that
[55:13] make us look so great and the things
[55:16] that elevate us. And we hide our flaws
[55:20] and we hide our mistakes and we hide our
[55:22] failures. We hide the wrongs we do
[55:24] because we want to make ourselves look
[55:26] good. How many of you have ever lied to
[55:29] make yourself look good?
[55:32] And if you don't have your hand up,
[55:35] you're lying to make yourself look good.
[55:41] Jesus said not to do that.
[55:44] Jesus said, "Don't let your right hand
[55:45] know what your left hand do." He said,
[55:47] "Don't let your arms be seen in front of
[55:50] other people.
[55:51] Uh, don't do good to make yourself look
[55:54] good or look more righteous. That's
[55:56] exactly what the Pharisees did.
[55:59] Show everyone all the good things you
[56:00] do. James literally says the opposite.
[56:04] Tell them how you messed up. Be brutally
[56:07] honest and how much you need their
[56:09] prayer. And you have now you have a
[56:12] deeper connection. And now it it really
[56:16] I believe it brings so much unity in a
[56:18] church when you can just be vulnerable
[56:20] with each other.
[56:23] Um
[56:28] there's a lot of power in the tongue
[56:31] when we gossip or when we say good or
[56:33] when we pray for someone. There's a lot
[56:34] of power in the tongue and I believe you
[56:37] can you can stay bound or you can be
[56:40] free a lot of times depending on if what
[56:42] you say or what you don't say. I really
[56:45] believe that. You know, let me just say
[56:49] Satan holds us captive by fear by
[56:53] keeping things in. We become afraid of
[56:57] what will happen if our sin is exposed.
[57:00] But exposing it is the best way to get
[57:03] rid of it, I believe.
[57:08] Can I tell the story?
[57:12] Um,
[57:14] he might he was maybe going to tell it,
[57:16] so I'll I'll tell the story. Um, I heard
[57:20] it growing up. His brother Biscoll would
[57:23] tell it. Maybe you've heard it. It's
[57:26] concerning a meeting he was in in uh
[57:29] northern British Columbia. Is it okay?
[57:31] Okay. Um, and
[57:35] he was sitting on the platform and
[57:37] brother Brandham was preaching and they
[57:41] were coming to the end of the service
[57:43] and they didn't have a prayer line that
[57:44] night. Uh but the anointing came and
[57:48] brother Brandham was calling people out
[57:50] in the service and people were being
[57:53] healed and brother Bisll sitting was
[57:55] sitting back here and he said a lot of
[57:57] the people were people from his church
[58:00] and he knew the problems and he'd hear
[58:05] one thing said he'd say that's correct
[58:07] and he'd hear time after time people he
[58:10] knew things they were dealing with
[58:12] and then in the middle of a song They're
[58:15] singing I love him. I I would have
[58:18] actually prepared better and played the
[58:20] section, but in the middle of the song,
[58:24] he says, "What's the matter, soldier
[58:25] boy?"
[58:27] Maybe a lot of you have heard this
[58:29] story. And he says, "You're not going to
[58:31] commit suicide."
[58:33] In the middle of a song, and you can
[58:34] hear on the tape, everybody stops
[58:35] singing. It's quiet. All of a sudden,
[58:39] they're You can even hear they're like
[58:40] looking for the soldier boy. You can
[58:42] hear like rustling around. He says,
[58:44] "You're not going to commit suicide. The
[58:46] devil's a lying to you." He says, "You
[58:49] have a a phobia,
[58:51] and if you let if you let him, he'll
[58:54] drive you insane." I'm not quoting
[58:55] exactly, but he says, "If he'll drive
[58:57] you insane if you believe him." He says,
[59:01] "Deny him, renounce the devil, accept
[59:04] Jesus Christ as your healer, and you'll
[59:07] go home, and you'll be a gentleman, and
[59:09] you'll be a real man."
[59:11] And then they just carry on with the
[59:12] service and nothing else happens.
[59:15] So it was brother Biscll's job that
[59:17] weekend to take brother Brandham on a
[59:19] rest up into the mountains to go
[59:21] hunting. And they go up there and
[59:24] they're driving down the Alaskan Highway
[59:27] and they're already in Dawson Creek,
[59:29] which if you've been in northern British
[59:31] Columbia, that's pretty much in the
[59:35] middle of nowhere as it gets. And then
[59:36] beyond that's just even more. and they
[59:39] come to a town, I think it was called
[59:42] Fort Nelson, and they decided to get
[59:44] something to eat. They're hundreds of
[59:46] miles up the Alaskan Highway in the
[59:48] middle of nowhere. This is the last town
[59:50] before they're going to get to the
[59:52] ground where they're going to hunt. So,
[59:53] this is out there, but there's a little
[59:55] town cuz when the Alaskan Highway was
[59:57] built, they just pushed it right through
[1:00:00] the wilderness and then little
[1:00:01] businesses opened up on the side of the
[1:00:04] highway. So, they stop at this
[1:00:05] restaurant and they sit down to have
[1:00:08] lunch and it's uh three of them and they
[1:00:13] order something to eat and then in walks
[1:00:16] this man and uh this man wearing a US
[1:00:20] Army tunic and brother Bisll recognized
[1:00:23] him as this soldier boy from the service
[1:00:28] and he said, "Fancy seeing you here."
[1:00:33] And then the man that was with him ran
[1:00:36] over to the table and thrust his hand
[1:00:38] down in front of front of brother
[1:00:39] Brandham and said, "Brother Brandham,
[1:00:41] Brother Brandham." And he said, "Uh, do
[1:00:43] you remember calling out the soldier
[1:00:45] boy? Do you remember saying what you
[1:00:46] said to the soldier boy?" And he's
[1:00:47] frantically speaking. Frantically
[1:00:49] speaking, "Uh, do you remember what you
[1:00:50] said?" And brother Brennham said, "I
[1:00:52] don't I don't remember. Do you remember,
[1:00:53] Brother Biscll?" And he said, "Yeah, I
[1:00:55] remember. You said that he's not going
[1:00:57] to commit suicide." And that was the
[1:00:58] devil talking to you. And he said,
[1:01:00] "Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what you said.
[1:01:01] That's what you said. And he said, "This
[1:01:03] is him." He said, "He came all the way
[1:01:05] from Fairbanks and we wanted to get him
[1:01:07] in the prayer line, but we couldn't get
[1:01:09] him a prayer card." And he said, "I
[1:01:12] believed that we would find you today."
[1:01:15] And then the soldier boy spoke up and
[1:01:17] said, "Yeah, this man actually
[1:01:19] believed."
[1:01:21] And he said it, Brother Biscll said he
[1:01:23] said it in such unbelief. He said,
[1:01:25] "Yeah, this guy actually believed that
[1:01:27] we would find you today." And I've heard
[1:01:29] brother Bisl tell the story many times.
[1:01:31] He said you could drop a pin in that
[1:01:34] spot. He said you could go 500 miles
[1:01:37] down the Rocky Mountain trench and maybe
[1:01:39] find a trapper and you could go however
[1:01:42] many hundred miles in the other
[1:01:43] direction and find a logger maybe or a
[1:01:47] or a trapper or or something. He said
[1:01:50] this was a true needle in a hay stack.
[1:01:52] And he said in the middle the fact that
[1:01:54] they ended up in the same place
[1:01:57] absolute miracle. So
[1:02:00] back to the this man is frantically
[1:02:02] speaking and he says, "Will you pray for
[1:02:03] him?" And brother Brandham said, "Oh,
[1:02:05] sure. Of course, I'll pray for him." And
[1:02:08] he said, "Let's just eat our lunch
[1:02:10] first." So they eat their lunch and they
[1:02:14] leave and as they're walking out, they
[1:02:16] meet out front and the soldier boy says,
[1:02:19] "Just two minutes, brother Ben." And so
[1:02:22] they walk to the end of the sidewalk and
[1:02:24] brother Biscll, Brother Chris, and this
[1:02:26] other man walk and give them space
[1:02:30] and this man is frantically speaking to
[1:02:34] Brother Biscll. He says he's he's tried
[1:02:36] to commit suicide three times. He's got
[1:02:39] a wife and two beautiful children.
[1:02:42] Nobody knows what's wrong with him.
[1:02:44] Nobody knows what's going on. He came
[1:02:47] down here so we could get him in the
[1:02:49] meetings. And brother Daniel has a side
[1:02:51] to the story that maybe he'll share. And
[1:02:54] nobody knows what's wrong with him. He's
[1:02:55] tried to commit suicide. And brother
[1:02:59] Biscll's hearing this and he's watching
[1:03:00] Brother Brandham.
[1:03:02] And brother Brandham takes off that hat
[1:03:04] that is you see in a lot of the photos
[1:03:06] and puts it over his heart. He knew he
[1:03:08] was praying then. And then he turns
[1:03:10] around, brother Brandham and the soldier
[1:03:12] boy and start walking back. And the
[1:03:15] soldier boy goes like this with his fist
[1:03:17] in the air three times and says, "I'm
[1:03:19] free. I'm free. I'm free." Walking back
[1:03:23] to the car and he gets back and they're
[1:03:26] in a little group. And he says, "This
[1:03:30] man told me something that I and my wife
[1:03:33] in this world know and no one else. And
[1:03:37] as soon as he told me, I was free."
[1:03:41] before they even prayed. He said, "As
[1:03:44] soon as he told me, I was delivered."
[1:03:49] And so they had a little conversation
[1:03:52] there and then they had to get in their
[1:03:54] car and head their way. And
[1:03:58] brother Biscll and they had to get in
[1:04:00] the car and go hunt. So they get in the
[1:04:02] car and leave.
[1:04:05] Brother Brenham says, "Brother Eddie, do
[1:04:07] you know this man?"
[1:04:09] He says, "No, no, I don't know this
[1:04:11] man." He said, ' Have you ever seen him?
[1:04:14] Is he any kind of a friend? No, I've
[1:04:15] never seen him. He's He's no kind of a
[1:04:17] friend. He said, ' Do you think you'll
[1:04:19] ever see him again? He said, "No, no, he
[1:04:22] lives in Fairbanks and I live in
[1:04:23] Vancouver. That's 1600 miles. I don't I
[1:04:26] don't think I'll ever see him again."
[1:04:29] And he said, "If he was your friend, I
[1:04:30] would never tell you."
[1:04:33] He said, "But when we were at the end of
[1:04:35] the sidewalk," This is Brother Brandham
[1:04:36] speaking. He said, "When we were at the
[1:04:37] end of the sidewalk, he came to us there
[1:04:41] and he told us that he had a lovely
[1:04:44] Christian wife and two beautiful
[1:04:46] children."
[1:04:48] That's the exact same words that the man
[1:04:50] had just spoke to Brother Biscll. He
[1:04:52] said, "He has a lovely Christian wife
[1:04:53] and two beautiful children, but he's
[1:04:56] been committing homosexual acts with
[1:04:58] young men."
[1:05:00] And as soon as that was told to him,
[1:05:04] Satan lost his power. And the boy went
[1:05:07] away free.
[1:05:09] He never prayed for they did pray
[1:05:11] together, but he said the exposing of
[1:05:14] the sin is what freed that man. And all
[1:05:18] those years with that covered up
[1:05:23] and coming to the point three times
[1:05:26] where he was going to commit suicide.
[1:05:29] And when that sin was exposed, he was
[1:05:32] free.
[1:05:34] Do you see why God gave us a church? A
[1:05:37] people we could talk to each other.
[1:05:39] People we could hold each other
[1:05:40] accountable. We could rely on each
[1:05:43] other. We hold things we hold things in
[1:05:46] and it does us harm.
[1:05:49] And it sears our conscience and it it
[1:05:53] causes a friction
[1:05:55] that if we would just talk to someone,
[1:05:58] obviously talk to the Lord. I'm not
[1:05:59] saying we don't confess these things to
[1:06:01] the Lord. If we would just open up and
[1:06:03] rely on the church that we have around
[1:06:04] us, we'd be free so many times. That's
[1:06:08] why we need a church. That's why it's
[1:06:10] not
[1:06:13] I'll just stop right there.
[1:06:19] That's why you can't stay home on
[1:06:20] Wednesday night. people.
[1:06:27] When we come to that point of humility,
[1:06:30] God is faithful to help us. He wants us
[1:06:33] to be he wants us to be free. He wants
[1:06:35] us to be holy like him.
[1:06:39] He gives us understanding of right and
[1:06:40] wrong. Helps us to do good instead of e
[1:06:43] evil. And then he writes it on our
[1:06:46] hearts so that we carry it wherever we
[1:06:48] go. and we carry it out of this life.
[1:06:50] Even
[1:06:53] let's read the last verse again.
[1:06:58] Let the words of my mouth
[1:07:01] and the meditation of my heart be
[1:07:03] acceptable in thy sight, oh Lord, my
[1:07:05] strength and my redeemer.
[1:07:09] So I the title tonight was a Christian
[1:07:12] is and a Christian does.
[1:07:14] What is a Christian is the question.
[1:07:18] I said all that to get to this. What is
[1:07:21] a Christian?
[1:07:23] Someone who prays to Jesus.
[1:07:27] Someone who reads their Bible.
[1:07:31] Someone who forgives.
[1:07:34] Someone who repents from their sin?
[1:07:38] Someone who tries to live holy?
[1:07:41] Is it someone who's honest?
[1:07:44] Is it someone who shares the gospel with
[1:07:46] others?
[1:07:49] Is it someone who stands up for truth?
[1:07:53] Is it someone who would give their life
[1:07:55] even for the gospel? Maybe. Is it
[1:07:57] someone that goes to church like we just
[1:07:59] said, participates in church, pays
[1:08:02] tithes, gives to God? Is it someone
[1:08:05] humble?
[1:08:07] Is it someone like Job? It says Job
[1:08:09] assued evil. He was a man that assued
[1:08:11] evil. Someone that obeys the golden
[1:08:14] rule.
[1:08:16] Is it someone who exalts others, lifts
[1:08:18] others up, encourages others? Somebody
[1:08:20] giving, somebody with faith, somebody
[1:08:23] with love and joy, somebody who
[1:08:24] memorizes scriptures, which I encouraged
[1:08:27] all of that tonight when we were reading
[1:08:29] through the Psalms.
[1:08:31] Is it this poster boy for Christianity?
[1:08:36] Yes. Yes. Yes.
[1:08:39] But also, no, no, no.
[1:08:44] These are all things that a Christian
[1:08:45] does.
[1:08:47] This is not what a Christian is.
[1:08:52] A Christian is,
[1:08:54] just to back up, a Christian is a human.
[1:08:56] It can't be an angel.
[1:08:59] They have to be alive
[1:09:03] or shall I say born.
[1:09:07] Unless one is born, you can put John 3
[1:09:09] verse three up.
[1:09:12] Unless one is born of water and spirit.
[1:09:17] So you're born naturally.
[1:09:20] And we have this scene where this
[1:09:23] teacher of the law, he probably knew
[1:09:25] that psalm we just read. He probably
[1:09:27] knew it. He probably had it memorized
[1:09:29] because they didn't have phones and
[1:09:30] stuff.
[1:09:32] He probably had it memorized. And Jesus
[1:09:34] says to him,
[1:09:36] you know, just in casually,
[1:09:39] unless a man be born again, he cannot
[1:09:42] see the kingdom of God.
[1:09:45] Simple, right?
[1:09:48] Well, no, it's not simple because
[1:09:49] Nicodemus said, "What on earth are you
[1:09:52] talking about? Born again?
[1:09:55] Can I enter a second time into my
[1:09:57] mother's womb and be born again?" So
[1:10:00] then Jesus steps back. He says, "Okay,
[1:10:01] yes, yes, yes. Unless someone's born of
[1:10:04] water, born naturally, and born of the
[1:10:07] spirit. So he's saying these are two
[1:10:09] different things. They cannot see the
[1:10:12] kingdom of heaven.
[1:10:15] And Nicodemus says
[1:10:18] in verse 9, "How can these things be?"
[1:10:23] And Jesus says, "Art thou a master of
[1:10:26] Israel and knowest not these things?
[1:10:30] Have you not read the Psalms about how
[1:10:33] your heart's going to be changed? The
[1:10:36] law of the Lord is perfect, converting
[1:10:37] the soul. There's this whole thing
[1:10:39] called the Old Testament that talked
[1:10:41] about this for generations and you're a
[1:10:42] teacher of Israel and you don't even
[1:10:45] understand this. Said, if I'm talking of
[1:10:48] earthly things, which I feel like
[1:10:53] Jesus said it, so I can't argue, but I
[1:10:56] feel like this isn't an earthly thing,
[1:10:57] that this is a heavenly thing. But he
[1:10:58] said, "If I tell you of earthly things
[1:11:00] and you don't understand that, how are
[1:11:02] we going to get to the deep stuff? How
[1:11:04] are we going to get beyond this?"
[1:11:07] Unless one is born of water and of
[1:11:10] spirit, they cannot see
[1:11:14] the kingdom of heaven. So that's what a
[1:11:17] Christian is. It's someone who's born
[1:11:20] again.
[1:11:24] And
[1:11:26] like I said, Jesus clarifies, you're
[1:11:28] born first of water, then you're born of
[1:11:30] the spirit. And he says, you're a
[1:11:32] teacher of Israel. This is taught in the
[1:11:33] scripture.
[1:11:36] A Christian is someone who's born again.
[1:11:38] So if I could say this just as we close,
[1:11:42] no matter how good you look
[1:11:45] or how religious you may be,
[1:11:48] how many quotes you know, how well you
[1:11:51] know
[1:11:53] this book maybe,
[1:11:56] it doesn't make a difference
[1:11:59] if you're not born again.
[1:12:01] And on the flip side,
[1:12:05] how wretched you may be and how filthy
[1:12:08] you may look and how sinful you may
[1:12:11] feel, if you're born again, it doesn't
[1:12:14] make a difference.
[1:12:17] Oh, glory to God. That he could take a
[1:12:19] sinner like me, wretched and vile, and
[1:12:23] all he has to do is put his spirit in my
[1:12:26] heart. I don't have to. Nothing came
[1:12:29] from me. It's from him.
[1:12:32] And now I'm a Christian.
[1:12:34] Because of that, Jesus stood before a
[1:12:36] woman that was married five times
[1:12:41] and he said, "Someone that drinks of
[1:12:43] this water will be like a well of water
[1:12:47] springing up into everlasting life." He
[1:12:50] wasn't talking to
[1:12:52] a churchgoer. He wasn't talking to
[1:12:54] somebody clean. Think of who he was
[1:12:56] talking to. He said, "If you drink of
[1:12:58] this water, it'll be to you like a like
[1:13:00] a well of water springing up into
[1:13:03] everlasting life." Whosoever, he says,
[1:13:07] drinks of this water. The musicians
[1:13:10] could come now.
[1:13:21] We're going to sing a song.
[1:13:27] I wonder sometimes
[1:13:31] when I was thinking about this, how much
[1:13:33] I forgot about
[1:13:36] the foundation of all this. That's
[1:13:38] really what this is. What a Christian is
[1:13:41] and what a Christian does. A Christian
[1:13:44] is born again. Would you stand with me?
[1:13:50] I would say if you haven't been born
[1:13:53] again,
[1:13:54] don't wait.
[1:13:57] Don't leave this building tonight
[1:14:00] without being born again, without being
[1:14:03] filled with his spirit.
[1:14:06] and that you could fulfill this
[1:14:07] scripture
[1:14:09] that you'd be like a well of water
[1:14:11] springing up into everlasting life. KFC,
[1:14:19] I
[1:14:20] will praise him.
[1:14:22] [Music]
[1:14:24] I
[1:14:26] will praise him.
[1:14:29] Praise
[1:14:31] the lamb for sinners slain.
[1:14:39] Give
[1:14:41] him glory
[1:14:43] all ye people
[1:14:45] [Music]
[1:14:47] for his blood has washed away
[1:14:53] each stain. Could you worship him for
[1:14:56] just a minute? Oh, I
[1:15:00] will praise him.
[1:15:03] I
[1:15:04] will praise him.
[1:15:07] Praise
[1:15:09] the lamb for sinners slain.
[1:15:13] [Music]
[1:15:16] Give
[1:15:18] him glory
[1:15:20] all ye people
[1:15:24] for his blood has washed away
[1:15:29] each stain. Verse one.
[1:15:34] When
[1:15:36] I saw the cleansing fountain,
[1:15:43] oh
[1:15:45] wide for all my sin.
[1:15:52] I
[1:15:53] oy the spirit's ru.
[1:16:00] Oh, when he said, "Wilt thou be clean?"
[1:16:06] Will you praise him tonight? Just a
[1:16:08] little longer. Oh, I
[1:16:10] will praise him.
[1:16:13] I
[1:16:15] will praise him.
[1:16:18] Praise
[1:16:19] the lamb for sinners.
[1:16:26] Give
[1:16:28] him glory, all ye people,
[1:16:34] for his blood has washed away
[1:16:38] each. And one more time, I will praise
[1:16:41] him. Oh, I
[1:16:45] will praise him.
[1:16:55] for sinners like
[1:16:58] they
[1:17:00] give
[1:17:02] him glory all ye people
[1:17:08] for his blood has washed away
[1:17:13] each stain.
[1:17:15] Amen. Amen.
[1:17:18] When brother Brandham was when he was up
[1:17:21] there
[1:17:22] in that restaurant
[1:17:25] and
[1:17:27] that man
[1:17:29] accepted his healing and he gave his
[1:17:31] heart to the Lord and was delivered.
[1:17:35] As brother Josiah said, it came
[1:17:39] from brother Brandham knowing something
[1:17:41] about him that no one else could know.
[1:17:46] And when brother Brandham received his
[1:17:48] commission,
[1:17:51] the angel told him that if you can get
[1:17:54] the people to believe you, then nothing
[1:17:59] would stand before your prayer, not even
[1:18:02] cancer. Now, that's misinterpreted and
[1:18:04] and and totally
[1:18:07] torn out of context and made into
[1:18:10] strange doctrines. But if you listen to
[1:18:12] it, if you can get the people to believe
[1:18:15] you, then nothing will stand before your
[1:18:18] prayer.
[1:18:20] That discernment that brother Brandham
[1:18:22] had, that gift that God sent through him
[1:18:26] was to help the people believe. Amen.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; And you can imagine if someone told you
[1:18:33] the deepest secrets of your heart, you
[1:18:35] can imagine that that would give you
[1:18:38] faith to be to believe
[1:18:42] that must be God. No one could know the
[1:18:44] secrets of my heart. And it helped so
[1:18:48] many people that that gift came out. And
[1:18:53] it was a gift, friends. It was a gift
[1:18:56] for us. It was a gift for those people
[1:18:59] that were there in those meetings to
[1:19:01] help them believe, to help them receive
[1:19:04] their healing.
[1:19:06] But it all has different parts.
[1:19:09] Each part has its part to play. As
[1:19:13] brother Josiah said, he was talking
[1:19:15] about confessing our faults one to
[1:19:17] another. You know, don't tell the
[1:19:20] Jesus said things the exact opposite of
[1:19:24] the way that we think. You know, we tell
[1:19:27] everybody how great we are. Jesus said,
[1:19:29] "No, tell everybody." Or James said,
[1:19:30] "No, tell everybody how bad you are."
[1:19:34] And then Jesus said, "If there's
[1:19:36] something good to be said about you, let
[1:19:38] someone else say it."
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; It said that. It says that in the
[1:19:42] Psalms. I believe it's in the Proverbs.
[1:19:44] Jesus said it throughout the Bible. Let
[1:19:46] someone else say it. But we get it all
[1:19:48] mixed up. But do you see how God has a
[1:19:51] great economy working? He places one
[1:19:54] with this gift of discernment here to
[1:19:58] increase the people's faith. But let me
[1:20:01] tell you the backstory
[1:20:03] of that.
[1:20:05] My dad was in those meetings and he saw
[1:20:08] brother Brandham call out that boy, that
[1:20:11] young man.
[1:20:13] Before the meetings,
[1:20:16] dad was driving
[1:20:19] and
[1:20:20] he saw this guy hitchhiking on the road.
[1:20:25] He picked him up
[1:20:27] and he invited him to go to the meetings
[1:20:30] and it was that man. It was that
[1:20:33] soldier.
[1:20:34] [Music]
[1:20:36] So my dad got to my dad and my
[1:20:37] grandfather, my family got to play a
[1:20:39] part over here. Brother Bisl got to play
[1:20:41] a part over here. Brother Brandham got
[1:20:43] to play a part over here, but God got
[1:20:45] the glory.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Because the man was delivered.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; What a beautiful story. And if we
[1:20:51] friends, if we could just operate in the
[1:20:54] calling that God has given us. If we
[1:20:57] could just all just
[1:21:00] like a watch, you know, like the old
[1:21:02] watches, they had all these moving
[1:21:03] parts.
[1:21:05] If you take one part out, the watch
[1:21:07] stops working. If one part breaks, if
[1:21:10] this watch of the Tucson Tabernacle
[1:21:13] could just click and just everything
[1:21:17] could fire perfectly, then God,
[1:21:20] he could do great things.
[1:21:23] But we all need to get in get into the
[1:21:26] spirit of God. And as brother Josiah
[1:21:29] said, the whole thing he he talked about
[1:21:32] I love that way he closed. There's
[1:21:35] acting like a Christian. This is what a
[1:21:37] Christian does and this is what a
[1:21:39] Christian is. And a Christian is born
[1:21:43] again.
[1:21:45] Born of the spirit.
[1:21:48] We were born of blood and water at the
[1:21:51] beginning and then as the Lord was
[1:21:54] telling Nicodemus,
[1:21:56] you must be born again after that. Amen.
[1:22:01] Let's bow our heads.
[1:22:06] Let the words of my mouth
[1:22:09] and the meditation of my heart be
[1:22:11] acceptable in thy sight, oh Lord, my
[1:22:14] strength and my redeemer.
[1:22:18] Father, what beautiful words from the
[1:22:20] psalmist.
[1:22:22] We thank you for our brother Josiah.
[1:22:25] Lord, thank you. young man studying the
[1:22:29] word and putting these
[1:22:32] things together, Lord, and just going
[1:22:34] verse by verse with this this psalm. How
[1:22:37] beautiful it was.
[1:22:39] What deep meaning that psalm has.
[1:22:43] Father, we thank you. Thank you for
[1:22:45] brother Josiah, Sister Katie, their
[1:22:48] dedication to young people. Lord, how
[1:22:51] rare is that in today's world?
[1:22:54] to young people serving us here at this
[1:22:57] church. We thank you for them.
[1:23:00] Lord, we thank you for your word.
[1:23:03] And most of all, Father, we thank you
[1:23:06] for your son, Jesus Christ, who died for
[1:23:09] our sins
[1:23:11] and ascended up
[1:23:14] to heaven and is at the right hand of
[1:23:17] the majesty on high. Lord, we thank you
[1:23:20] that the almighty God became flesh and
[1:23:23] dwelt
[1:23:26] and a man that lived a perfect life
[1:23:31] and then father gave his life
[1:23:34] for our sins. We thank you Lord. Thank
[1:23:38] you for your goodness. Thank you for
[1:23:40] your word. Father we love you in Jesus
[1:23:44] name. Amen.
