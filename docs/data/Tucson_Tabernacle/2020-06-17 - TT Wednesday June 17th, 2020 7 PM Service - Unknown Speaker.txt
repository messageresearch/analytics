bring the rest of the praises and prayer requests but as Lydia was driving down the freeway today there's a like a piece of guardrail or something of thought of a big truck in front of her and could have easily hit the vehicle and she had the two boys and there could have been really bad but the Lord just kept her it's so thankful for that that he keeps us and the big things and little things that song something keeps holding me [Music] let's start with the the verse that you can put that up good the trials of this world were getting closer the pole I felt was more than I could bear and I

mighty foundation the fighting fortresses or thoughts into my heart into my heart [Music] into my [Music] forty [Music] [Applause] [Music] you may be seated go ahead and continue to play we do have a couple of requests and a couple of announcements to me sister Amelia's asking us to remember in prayer somebody's been vandalizing her mailbox sticking pieces of twigs and stuff in where she cannot open the mailbox and they've done it off and on now in the management hasn't done to help her when she's gone so you know God has a way of taking care of things sometimes we'd say well I would do this and I would do that give it into the hand of the Lord and you know I've seen some people plan some elaborate ways to get even with somebody and they go through this whole thing but God can instantly change somebody's heart can't cause something to change so we'll put it in his hands brother Lyle sent me a text yesterday evening I had sent a text to them see how they were doing knowing that they were traveling home they had to gone up to visit the family up in Washington and they had just arrived in a Reno where one of their sons their yesterday evening but they're hoping possibly be home by tomorrow or Friday just a significant have traveling mercies on the way up there they did have a little bit of vehicle problems but they felt that had been taken care of so and there's brother Darrell Ward was to be with us next Sunday but that has been cancelled her brother Darryl's request because some of the young people from for the Donnie Reagan's church there in Happy Valley have tested positive to they covet there was a youth gathering here up in Phoenix and both of the churches that were involved there were some folks now that have tested positive so brother Darrell was going to be tested but had gotten the results in felt would be better if he did not come at this time and possibly the following week or maybe two weeks down the road before it came just to be safe I know one of the other churches in town today also had been exposed and they don't know anything so they're just being cautious and it's not something we have to live in fear about the Bible says if they take up anything deadly or drink anything or they would not be harmed but does that mean that I'm gonna go get a bottle of poison to walk through a snake pit no but if I need to God can take care of me and as I was thinking about that I remember he said get in be a place that blood on the lamppost and stay behind that and yet those that stayed behind it the Death Angel pass and brother Ram says take that same token and apply it in your life apply it in your home apply it in the vehicle you drive apply it in everything you do and he'll take care of you somebody said well you know we want we don't want to be exposed I said you know every day that you're out there you're exposed to something but greater is He that is in us than he that is in the world so just remember those needs and this Sunday brother Matt will be ministering through the livestream since they had to make these changes and we'll just be having one service for brother Matt that would be Sunday morning and he'll be doing that and then we'll have to see whether it'll be brother Darrell the following weekend or so but you pray that God has his way and that we're willing to accept it and do that and I heard and brother Matt also shared some of the testimonies and some of the blessing from Sunday especially the Sunday evening worship after the service it was just such a sweet presence at all and thank the Lord that he's so mindful of us and so good to us so let's just bow our head to remember this need for sister Maria and brother vile and if you have a need or know someone's I know my I mentioned a prayer request for my brother his wife and her and then being hit with that kovat and four members of the family and and that you know there's a fear and a thing but God can grant us peace any so let's just bow our heads for one Lord we we just know that the token has been applied in our lives and hardened it's that Holy Spirit living in us Father we ask you Lord in this situation for sister Mary uh Norden there's somebody vandalizing the mailbox but Lord you're able to take care of that situation protected Lord as you know best how to do brother Lila sister Heather heading on the last part of the journey to come back to home Lord would you be with them keep them safe and every hand raised in every heart here before you and those maybe at home or listening in whatever that need is in their life that situation I know brother Joe Miller with with the passing away one of the co-workers and how it's affected those when we know someone that's a friend or a dear one to us Gordon it shows that in the human life how temporary it is but we're looking to you Lord the author and the giver of eternal life or would you come in comfort and strengthen and encourage each one today we ask him Jesus Christ amen thank you this evening a night was a couple of things that I was looking at sometimes you felt pulled one way and then a different direction and I I was listening to to or reading a message on the one god rich in mercy and I'm glad he's rich in mercy I'm glad that I can't exhaust his mercy oh I can probably get him upset at me as maybe we would are what if our parents or something but we don't exhaust his mercy mercy he said he is rich in mercy and I reading through that and some other things and just felt that God led me in this direction but I sometimes you still question it am I going in the right direction is this and and I was just going over this and I said well you know it's this I said lord I don't want to direct this at anybody or anything I don't want it to come that way and then as the Lord I felt told me so why don't you direct it at yourself so this is for me okay it's not for you it's for me and and it just will take the first scripture and you'll see maybe in what direction will go with and Deuteronomy chapter 25 will read verses 13 through 15 and it was something I spoke about ten years ago and it was brought to my memory so I just rehearsed it a little bit but you know just was looking at this and and and feeling about this and I said I see what God would have do with us and today this evening Lord gave me something that I thought was just comfort in my heart or settled it in my heart thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights are great and a small and so yeah it might be a little puzzling a little strange tax but this was in the law giving the law you're not going to have a heavyweight in a light weight and he says thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures a greatness small but thou shalt have a perfect and just wait a perfect and just measure shalt thou have that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee and as I looked at that it made me think how many times did God say if you keep this my days will be lengthen wow he says that quite often speaking it in the natural - to Israel but in the spiritual to us not necessarily in this land but in the promises of God to eternal life but a perfect and just weight so if I would title this I would say judging by law or judging by grace you know and and sometimes it's easy and I was sharing this with my wife and the girls and I might have startled them a little bit yesterday maybe not it's kind of hard to startle them I think they're pretty used to their dad but we're just talking about some of the events that are going on and and all the things that are happening and every time you open the news or hear something some different and I said you know sometimes it just makes me angry I said and I've had this thought I said get a gun and shoot them all and then I have to repent why would I have that idea but the anger and the frustration so it just kind of boiled over a little bit and I said Lord you know I'm glad you don't look at us that way and say I should just shoot him but God rich in mercy God would look down and say I'm not happy with that but you're still my son you're still my job and as I was looking at this in divers weights and measures and all and I thought this may be how I would treat a brother or sister the church and how I would treat my neighbor and how I would treat somebody I don't even know well he's my brother and his sister so I'm gonna give him the best deal he's my neighbor so he's gonna hit a good deal but not as good as my brother and sister and the person I don't know I'm gonna get the best deal out of him but the Bible tells us know that we should be just imperfect in our actions and our enter in our dealings and that in the daily things that we do how we approach things you know and as I was looking through this and I started looking at the word judging and and see the attitude and how God spoke through through both the Old Testament and the New Testament and this evening I found this quote and I've asked brother Jordan them to actually play and sometimes you read it and then you hear brother Graham saying it just has a different effect so if he would play that that it's just a couple minutes long Elijah represented the Justice of God in representation of God's justice issues and our divisions whatever they're clean 15 and raise them God met father fall from heaven he continues down come to bar justice of God bench Christian was on the presence of the King said that to fire benefit of their path truth - it [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I think that says it all does the law today I was coming down the way down here and the law said 65 miles an hour once we got past the down around were taro and I looked up and I said I think that's brother Jordan and sister Martha on the vehicle and I passed them up and they were doing about 65 and I was doing closer to 70 and brother Jordan said hi or waved to me as I went by him and then we got down into the construction zone and it's 55 so I slowed down to 60 so I was kind of obeying the law brother Jordan and them stayed back me so I think they were obeying the law I'm just saying are we gonna be sticklers for the law is everything somebody driving 55 in a 55 mile at speed zone but you want to go 65 million you get angry at them hey I said I'm talking about me it's just and I found this quote this evening or this afternoon and I said do we really want God's justice just a demanded the life of somebody so rather than take it out on you he took it out on his son and he's the only one that can redeem us in second chronicles chapter 19 6 and 7 and he said to the judges take heed what you do for you judge not for man but for the Lord who is with you in the judgment when you realize when you and sometimes we have to make a judgment you have to make a decision in a situation something that's come at man you have to say brother green used to say this he used to say don't talk about him like that he's my boss has anybody ever said that when somebody sings him using God's name and man you said hey that's my god I have never stopped somebody honestly and told him to quit saying that and tell him that but that's really what we should say you're speaking evil of my boss you're speaking evil of the one that loves me that saves me well but that's a little embarrassing he was not embarrassed to be stripped naked and hang on a cross for me and you and that's grace so he says look you're not for me you're not judging for men's club you're judging and the Lord is with you if you're a conscious that he's with you you would really be careful with up your attitude and that's why I asked sir sister Martha to play into my heart come into my heart Lord where for the next verse there brother Jordan we verse 7 second chronicles wherefore now let the fear of the Lord be upon you take heed and do it for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God nor respect for persons nor taking of gifts well I know that if I do this I'm gonna get something nice back and if I do this one because that one has you know higher prestige it's not my dad I'll be nice to that one we're to love and treat one another especially those of the household faith as we would treat Christ as he would treat us and we should have that attitude let's go to Matthew chapter 7 and this is Jesus speaking one through five their judge not that you be not judged we are we must judge you you are to take are you you should have an attitude as as you look at something do I want to partake of that is it profitable for me is it a good thing that's not what he's saying but when we turn around we judge someone else for their actions he says because the way you judge you're going to be judged back for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with what measure you mete it shall be measured to you again therefore if your judgment is with a perfect weight and a perfect measure you get judged back the same way with the same mercy and the same grace of God and why behold us now it says the mote that is in thy brother's eye the little splinter little thing that's in his eye but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye now when I think of a beam I don't think of a little piece of wood I think of something that's holding up the building I got one of those in my eye but I'm complaining or talking to you about the little spot in yours he always says thou hypocrite first cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then thou shalt see clearly to cast out the mote of thy brother's eye suddenly your attitude changes suddenly your perspective changes and as I was looking this God brought some things back to my remembrance and again this is about me okay I'm not aiming this at anybody else don't take it personally to you and I'll just just say like it was we had two brothers who were part of this church and they both both wanted to be the pastor of this church both um said the Lord said they would be the pastor of church and it didn't go that way and they both left and started their own churches and they're my brothers they're part of the family of God they're my brothers okay but I'd got to the point that I was upset with him and and I'd gotten under might just be honest with you okay I got to the point that I started asking the Lord to do something to catch our attention and straighten them out and and I was saying Lord but you know they need to be straightened out they need to be taken care of they're wrong in this and they're wrong with that Lord whatever you need to do do it to them and I found myself thinking that one day and I said Lord how did I get to this stage that I would be wishing ill on my brother so I went to the Lord I got on my knees and went to the Lord I said can you do something about this and he did he straightened those brothers out honest no he didn't he worked on this guy and right after that in the same place I ran into both of those brothers okay and as I came up to him here's my thought here's my feeling I said wow this brother has changed there's a whole different atmosphere an attitude about it I greeted him and talked to him he had a good conversation I walked into the building and the other brother is sitting there and the only open chair was the one next to him so I went down to sat next to him and I said Lord you changed this brother too and then it dawned on me no he had worked on me he had come into my heart said no the problem is right here and they are my brothers and I could see them that way and I thank God and I confessed it God changed my heart I was no longer their judge I wanted the same mercy and same compassion that God has had on me on them you know again I needed the beam taken out of my eye and I didn't find him out in their eye after that because it had been change in my heart Luke chapter 6 35 to 38 we got that scripture up there Luke 36 35 but love your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great and ye shall be the children of the highest for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil and I'm glad he is because that includes me because sometimes I'm not thankful and sometimes I do things that are wrong but he's kind B therefore merciful as your father also is merciful judge not and ye shall be not be judged condemn not and ye shall not be condemned forgive and you shall be forgiven I feel I feel like like I'm not being forgiven well take a look are you forgiving you know this just well to whom you you extend mercy and want mercy you must be merciful and they go hand in hand and then in John's 724 these were just subscriptions judge not according to the appearance but Judge righteous just let not your decisions be judged by what you see you don't have all the information you don't have all the news you didn't see it in the same perspective you know when somebody is a witness of something they needed to be one who saw what happened to be a true witness well I brother Myrtle told me about it so I'm gonna go stand in the witness but I wasn't the witness brother Marilla was the witness because he actually saw it happen and sometimes we want to be we want to judge because not by the appearance of the thing but judging righteous judgment with a right spirit you know and and sometimes we do we judge by an appearance there was something did happen and there was a young lady here at the church it's been quite a few years ago and she had had a heart up raising her her father was one of those that believed brother Branham was God and and she had really really had a hard up race and she had been abused and all and and she was here that church and and and I've never been in a situation like that I was not raised that way I couldn't say I know how you feel because I don't because I had good Christian parents I had a good home raised in and I'm grateful for that I thank the Lord but not everybody had that so she penned a letter one time and I read it and I asked her if I could read it back and she pinned the letter I don't know what I lost it right and and it was probably two pages long but she talked about herself coming and how people had received her and then she fell away and how people turn their back on her and the end of the letter was somebody smiled at me and gave me hope and somebody said they care and others turned their back in n and she said which one were you and it really caught my thought my attention I I got permission from her to read it and I read it to the congregation and after service I had somebody pull me aside and they really read me the riot act for reading that letter because they condemned that sister and they gave me all their reasons for it he should have never read it that was wrong she's such a bad girl and they did all of this and I'm like you didn't catch the spirit of what we were trying to say it's a sad thing to say now that that person did that that is now in the same situation as other person is so away from God remember how you judge your couldn't be too much back if you're judging someone as if you are perfect then you better be perfect you better have no faults because that's how you'll be judged but if you're judging somebody with the same mercy that God judge you had the merciful she'll find mercy James and I just want to go to this here and we're not gonna be very long tonight James 5 19 and 20 and watch what James says brethren if any of you do err from the truth and one convert and somebody in their heart says I'm gonna go after my brother after my sister I'm gonna go see what I can do to to to restore them back to the fold you know to to do something cuz let him know that he which would converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sins I'm glad somebody had mercy on me I'm glad somebody looked past this guy and said there's one worth redeeming if he had looked at the outer and their parents here but I said no chance no hope no nothing but he said I will go for that one remember they would have the Pharisee in the sad you see and the the lawgiver and the priest and they saw that injured man and they gave him a wide berth went around a long ways from him but the publican came by and he saw man hurting and he stopped and he comes by where the Good Samaritan I'm sorry and he comes by knee and he comes in and he any ministers to the needs of the of this one that was was hurting and bleeding and and had been beaten upon and and and you know attacked and all and he takes them to the end and he says look take care of this man give him that which he has need feed him bathe him and cover his wounds and then when I come back on my next trip if it costs you more than I have here I'll pay you again watch what happens is a kiss when God said Zacchaeus come down any when Jesus goes into any and he's there with him in his home what does the Kia say if I have wronged any man I will pay back fold what I have wronged a man that's the Spirit of Christ rather than a harsh Mosaic law judgment sometimes I find myself Lord do this Lord do that I did especially with all that's happening right now democratic-republicans sometimes it makes you angry how could people be that way boy they need a good lesson I have to say God like you have mercy have mercy on them also it made me think of the prodigal son there's there's two boys in that story that Jesus shares one who never left the house the Bible doesn't say he ever did anything wrong he never left the house the other one that took his is the inheritance that his father gave him and he went out to enjoy himself I don't think he had any intention to be in a pig pen at the end of his day I don't think anybody's ever got up in the morning and said boy I just want to have the most miserable day I ever had today I've ever had before I surely don't pray that way you know but sometimes we get into situation something happens something goes wrong first job on on yesterday morning Tuesday I step out of the truck there's a drain there in the middle of Street Mikey falls out and falls right into the drink fortunately it wasn't a real deep one it was only about a foot and a half so nobody drove by while I was on my hands and knees with a stick trying to get my keys out of there you know but I didn't ask the Lord let me have one of those days but he did and that's okay but this young man when he took his father's inheritance when he got those things that it was his inheritance and he went out I'm gonna go have a good time I'm gonna go do this I want to go see the world I want to go enjoy this but when no intention to be where I ended up but that's where he ended up one time it doesn't say how long it was maybe a year maybe six months maybe five years we don't know God Jesus has given this story and then this this young man ends up in a pig pen in the swamp in the mess but the other brother stayed home the whole time never left had access to everything because his father told him that he says this is all yours it's always been yours brother branham says that table is spread and the food is on there and he says eat and then his last statement was if you don't want any then starve that sounds kind of mean but it's true so this young man it finally comes to let's just say it's a year down the road he comes to he realizes you know the servants might my father servants are better off than I am right now and it made me think I said what was his attitude as he's coming back we know he's gonna tell his father he's making this decision he's talking to himself and saying I'm gonna go to my father and I'm gonna tell him I am not worthy to be your son anymore I haven't tried that on my mom and my dad cuz I don't want to ever say yeah you're right I don't think they ever would but imagine that your son or your daughter would come back up to you and tell you I messed up therefore I'm not your daughter I am NOT your son anymore a true mother to a father would not say all you never did nothing they'll say we need to address that but you're still my son you're still my daughter so this is this young man is coming back up towards the house however long that journey was maybe a month maybe a longer I don't know but he's thinking I'm going to go to my father and I'm gonna tell him I am not worthy to be your son I've done all this wrong I failed you I've made your name look bad everybody knew who I was that you were this great man and and and I ruined your reputation and you know is that the son of so-and-so my look at that so he's thinking I'm not I'm gonna come back and humble myself and say I'm just gonna be one year service but the father it says was looking out from his house down the pathway and saying is my son coming home today is he returning is he willing to come back and say father will you receive me the desire of the heart of the father was my son to come back to come home and and he's coming back up getting close to his neighborhood and I'm sure the neighborhood knew the story the son had taken the inheritance had spent it had wasted it oh my look at that here he comes and you know I don't know what his name was I'm gonna call him Bob okay here comes Bob he's walking up the road and the neighborhood is looking at him and said there he is what a mess what a disgrace look what he did I can't believe how he took advantage of his father could you believe there were people like us you know and he's gone but the father is looking the father says a father ran down to meet him he willingly left the highest place and he came down to meet his children he left glory to come back down to this Pigpen of earth to save us his willing to give it up and the father in him and he tells of dad I cannot even be your son him or her father says you are my son I'm gonna put the robe back on you we're going to feast today you are my son but this was my other thought with that what men did that son think of the servants did he come back I said oh boy I'm back on top again I'm your Lord you're gonna do what I say no I think he had a little compassion on the servants now cuz now he had been in their shoes he had to work for a living had to eat the slop he had to eat you know so he comes back and he's now looking at the service you say hey I'm gonna be nice a lot nicer to you than I ever was because I've been in your stead now I've been where you're at and it wasn't any good it was no fun but the other Sun is there and we know he never left the house he was there he had access to it all he just chose not to the father tells him this has all been yours all the time but you chose not to partake of it you chose not to take any of that and how many times have we've gone to bed miserable at night because we just number ourselves down and say father I'm sorry and he said we'll come back on then wake up in the morning maybe angry or grumpy or something like that didn't have a good night to sleep or some when simply you could have gone on your knees and say Lord I'm sorry maybe to your spouse maybe to your brother to your sister whoever and just say I didn't mean that would you forgive me and then peace is made and when peace is made the spirits that are tormenting you leave God is the author of peace if you have a tormenting spirit that's not the Spirit of God just make it right come back and said i judge wrong III went this way and I went this way and I was wrong and it's okay the peace that comes with it is worth it every bit of it and I think I just was thinking about that prodigal son I said boy he had a different attitude about his his sermons he probably didn't look at him as servants anymore he probably went out and he would talk to them just like he would they were one of his they were their brother and sister I've been where you're at and now God has restored me I'd like to read a couple of quotes here let's start with that first one enticing spirits said now let's lay aside every weight you got a temper you got something about you makes you talk when you want not to talk oh God lay it there now lay it there watch the fire of the altar come down and take it away watch the love of God lick it up watch all the that old selfishness that way you've been talking to your wife the way you've been talking to your husband the way you've been talking to your neighbor the way you've been talking to the people in the church lay it on the altar this morning and the fire of God will come down and take it right away and divine love will burn in its place amen God can do he did that in my heart he changed that for me because I but I just had to get behind him say I'm sorry and he'll do Jubilee year if you have enmity against you against some neighbor against somebody else that's done you harm and that person has done you harm if you and your heart can't love that person don't take that experience you must love those who do not love you if you love those that who love you sinners do the same but you've got now not just to act like it's a religious act but from your heart you have to us time to go to church I'm gonna put my church clothes on my church phazon and my church attitude on because I'm in church it's time to do a religious act but if your heart is not in it it's just a religious act but here he says but from your heart let it become that which comes from your heart then you don't have to put an act on it'll be it'll be natural let's go on to divine love and Sovereign Grace now listen I want to tell you something human beings are more intelligent than animals and you can't tell people you love them they won't believe it unless the real things there to prove it so you say oh brother you know how we have such great fellowship and down into your heart a grudge he knows different God knows it your neighbour knows that you got to be clean and aboveboard and say Lord God created me a clean heart to love you know they say animals can detect your spirit really see your attitude those of you who've had pets you can see how they are you know sometimes you turn around and when Nina and Steven were here they brought the dogs with them because last time they had left them and the caretakers had a hard time with him because they were unhappy because Nina and Steven were gone so they brought him and you know we hadn't had dogs in the house for a couple of years or in the yard and dad hadn't didn't have to clean up so I was kind of happy about that you know I didn't have to clean up after him and all and but I said bring him that's okay they'll have the yard to run around in and so they got into what about three or four in the morning I think they're driven all night and I got up to go to work and I step outside and here comes their dog Andrey and he attacks me he literally came flying at me with his mouth opening growling and fortunately Steven was there and caught him in the midair and I said Henry you're glad Stevens here he'd be a dead dog just write about he scratched me it didn't get me with the teeth with his paws right and it took me a moment to realize Stephen is is the one he watches so and I was a threat to Stephen according to what he saw he caught right away here I have a threat and he came to protect Stephen it took a couple of days for Henry to get calmed down so he'd be okay when we'd come outside they can catch the spirit the mode we had to treat him nice we had to go on toggle him to go to pet pet him and all and after a while he was having fun with us how about with your brother and your sister when you get angry you get upset you get frustrated you get mad and and and you you come across with that strong spirit lord help us sometimes the position of a believer in Christ the fruit of the Spirit is love what is God love and if you can't love your enemy no matter what he says about you your neighbor what he says about you if from your heart not with your lips not with the knowledge that you should be doing it as a Christian but something in your heart makes you love them anyways regardless of what you say then it's time to come to the altar again you just never quite got what you thought or what really you should have I've been there confessor to you I've been there God can't change those things if we're willing to say Lord I need some help Lord I need an attitude change Lord I want my heart to be different be be willing to quickly say I'm sorry maybe let me be willing to quickly make it right you know we do sometimes we say things out of turn we get upset for a moment maybe the you know a little bit of anger and it and it flashes up real quick but brother Graham says this quick as you can get a hold yourself make it right Satan deed in the last one is that the one we just know there is if there sin in your heart if there's a Fault in your heart you got something you got anything pray now and ask God to forgive you you pray for me this is at the end of the the the tape at the service he's speaking to the to the congregation you'll pray for me I'll pray for you amen you pray for me I'll pray for you one another we're all part of the body of Christ god bless you is my prayer till we meet again till we meet god be with you till we meet again do you love one another john said little children love one another love one another for love covers a multitude of sins now let us shake one another's hand god be with you till we meet again until we meet now be kind to one another be kind to everybody treat your neighbor right keep yourself unspotted till Jesus comes a bride that's without spot without wrinkle that's in every phase and portion of our life it just that's his words he's as he's speaking that to this church keep yourself unspotted don't give Satan a place to get on to hold to grab brother branham said at this well you can't keep the birds from flying over your your head but you can keep them from building the nest once they build the nests it's hard to get rid of them yeah so he's talking about that he said love one another treat one another right and this is the promise one of the promises it comes with it I heard a brother speaking just a portion and he was talking about this is the day of rights everybody is is is out there protesting for the rights whether you know it's right this way or right that way this guy's rights are different than their right so then you know I want their rights and oh I want these rights because everybody's doing that you know just about everything is coming up you know and and and he is saying why not it's allowed of Sam this is the day of rights this is the manifestation of what Lauda see is I don't need God I just want my own rights I want to do what I want to do I want to do as I please and don't tell me otherwise and he said when you hold on to your rights all you'll have is pain and trouble and unrest and failure because you'll never be happy but if you'll surrender your rights like a sheep surrenders its wool if you'll say Lord I'm giving it all to you and then watch the difference that's what she does what's what the bride does she gives herself to him and then he says I'll leave the ninety-nine that are in the fold to go get that one because that's that's who he is that's how the care that he has for you so in Isaiah 26:3 watch what he says here we've got just a few scriptures here Isaiah 26:3 that will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusts us in their perfect peace complete peace a whole peace in every aspect of your life in every part not just when you're a church not just when you're inside your home but in any situation God can keep you at peace about it what is peace the absent of war what is Ward turmoil struggle but if you can say Lord I'll just let you have it I'll let you take it you'll take care of it he said he thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose - stayed on thee because he trusted in the Lord your word says and I'll stand by whichever just Psalms 4:8 I will both lay me down in peace and sleep for thou Lord only maketh me to dwell in safety at the night the end of the day you've done you've done all you can to do it right and if you did something wrong you made it right if you owed somebody you're restored to a child if you had a cross word you said I'm sorry because those things do happen sometimes now except for the rest of you who are all perfect angels I know well sometimes we things go you know I could have I walked into another house today and and I liked it when I get in there nobody's in there because then I don't have to listen to anybody else's radios so there was a big radio sitting on the countertop and it wasn't on I said thank you lord the guy's not in here or the people are not here so it's not blasting so I was about halfway done when he walked in and he turned it on and it's disgusting it's just I wanted to shoot the radio this time I didn't want shoot him I just wanted to shoot the radio but you know I'm like you know this is their God I don't have to lose my faith in my anger and get so upset because of this Lord you can keep me in perfect peace I don't have to be tormented by this afflicted by this I can think good things think on these things and turn my whole attitude around was that this guy's fault no but I could have got upset I could have said something to do it I could tell me I oh you know a turn there no I just changed my attitude forgot about the radio and that night I can lay my house down to sleep and and and and peace and sleep for the Lord only maketh me to dwell in safety in peace in tranquillity of mine resting securely upon God's promises not in my ability figured out my ability to make it work out but God said so and God keeps his word 1st Corinthians 14:33 for God is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all the churches of the saints that's me I'm in one of the churches of the saints is that you - Amen God is not the author of confusion when things are getting you know a distorted confused everything say hey God it's not you it must be me because you're not the author of confusion you're not the one that twists the mind up you're not the one that causes the angers on it that's all or to help me to catch that quickly and straighten it out as fast because that's in the churches of the saints and that's us Matthew of 5 9 blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God amen lord help me to be a peacemaker help me to be one that doesn't want to create our SH attitude a harsh atmosphere but one that would say hey you know when I come around brother so-and-so when I'm around sit there's such a peace about it there's such a sweetness about it you've ever been to their home isn't there just a wonderful spirit of peace in their home let it be Lord Romans 12:18 if it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with all men oh goodness so there must be some times that it's not always possible some people refuse but you do your effort anyways yeah just different things happen you know as much as possible this is live peaceably with all men Hebrews 12:14 follow peace with all men and holiness to give to to to maybe to get peace with your neighbor don't lower your standards to make your neighbor happy well in order to get my neighbor happy I've got to do this and this and make him because he'll be happy if I'm like him he says follow peace with all men and holiness stay true to your calling but you can still be at peace without which no man shall see the Lord both holiness and peace he's peace himself if you have God there is peace in your life peace the absent of war you're not battling you're not fighting he is my peace he has broken down every wall and then in second Thessalonians 3:16 now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means the Lord be with you amen you accept that raise your hands say the Lord be with me the Lord be with you all accept it he said the peace that he himself gives a peace sometimes that we can't understand a reason why but there's no reason to try to figure it out just say yes Lord it's so sweet to trust in Jesus he's unfailing he never fails he he he goes and does things that you just say Wow look how good he took care of that you know I walked down the street and and he's there to watching over me this situation happens he took care of me he answered it he met that need or whatever it is there's a peace knowing that God supply if every every need supplies yeah there's not oh my lord have you ever dealt with this lord have you ever had you have to run back to your laboratory and figure up another mixture or another vaccine no every need supplied he is our peace he has broken every wall he has caused the the love of God in us to want to treat others as he treated us not by the law the law says the day you fail you shall surely die God's justice says because I am a just God I could not take that in my presence in fact the high priest when he went back behind the veil what did he have he had the shed blood the blood of an innocent animal but he wear war bells and they had a rope tied around him and if he displeased the Lord at one second he was dead the Bell stopped they knew he wasn't alive he got dragged back out it was death to go in behind that veil wrong today it's death to stay outside of that path and not enter into his presence and receive the peace of God the grace of God the mercy of God the righteousness of God the ability to be godly is God in you not of ourselves I give it a go in the morning and I go for a little bit and then something goes wrong and then I'm down again but if I say Lord I'm going in your name you lead me you guide me go with me and watch him take care of the situation's Bible does say be angry and sin not so there's times you do get angry how many would say I've been angry before you know but he says send out make it right don't let the Sun go down on your anger don't let its - don't let it you know I've said it this way in and I said you know young couples when they first get married I say you know you will say something you will do something you will anger her you'll you'll make her upset over something make it right quickly as quick as you can and I said you know this get the peace back get that I said but it's a lot less expensive if you do it quickly and then my wife says they're probably wondering how many times you had to buy me something I said you know it's not so I just it's just an example because the longer it takes the more expensive it gets where if I would have just said I'm sorry it's usually okay that's all right but down the road isn't gonna cost me a bouquet of flowers it's going to cost me a dinner it's going to cost me it you know just the longer we hold on to something that greater the grudge becomes the greater the effect the more Ruby gets down it and gets harder to take out where if we will quickly say I'm sorry I didn't mean that I'm sorry us in the Lord and us and one another we're all part of the family of God let's care for one another let's encourage one another let's not look at and judge harshly because I want the mercy of God I want it for me I want it for you we are a part of the family of God and mercy rewrote my life if the musicians would come I'm glad for his mercy I'm glad for his grace because where would I be without it you know I sometimes I I do something and and I look at the girl's face and I don't blame him because sometimes you think I was 12 years old we act at home we get to do it in st. in there like come on dad grow up you know but they still love me they still care for me they'll still go out of their way to help me out you know they say well what would you have done with a son I said I don't know I have no idea I might have made him a little brat or a little of what you call spoiled brat I don't know maybe God knew I wouldn't be able to handle it but you know God gives us what he knows we can god loves us he cares for us mercy rewrote my life can you sing that to him in a in a in a way of just thanking him mercy [Music] my [Music] I should [Music] God's nurse [Music] God's mercy [Music] I [Music] Lord we don't come in a way that would want to tell you or say to your approach in a way as an Lord I'm your son so therefore I deserves we want to come as your children Lord but we also want to have an attitude and a heartless pleasing unspotted by the things of the world unspotted by the attitudes of the world and the things that cause frustration or but rather a peaceful spirit within this order a willingness to say we're sorry a willingness to make things right that need to be made right or not holding on to grudges or we're getting to a point or where it consumes us but lord quickly say lord help me help get past this and to love my neighbor as myself or my brother my sister the one I don't even know the one on the side of the road or the that one that was on the side of the road or hurt and injured it and not give them a wide berth but see if we can help take that attitude let our hearts be pleasing before you let our attitudes in it but you can look as su as you said of your own son this is my son my beloved son here he ain't home Lord this these are my children these are mine they have my spirit of they have my attitude that you have mistake maybe they treat things the same way I look at it and it would please you learn or let that be in all of us Lord in every situation and or those--of they have not gotten to know you that way or they find you to be that way I got a mercy a God of grace a God of another floor sometimes with some people may fill me up only knowing you as a God of justice and a God of law that's the only way they can see you today long if I mess up God is going to hurt me of good I'm going to get hit with a bolt of lightning Lord but let they find out that if they would meet you get to know you find who you really are and have that personal experience [Music] we ask Jesus Christ created me a clean heart three [Music] i renewed [Music] [Music]

give the more you give them in the more of him you get and the more of him you get in the more of him he'll be like that's his promise that he keeps his right god bless you don't take this as a scolding or any way but just a reminder God spoke to me this week once you're at watch how you judge watch how you look at things sometimes you make a judgment without all the information without all the facts you have to go back and well you know I need to redo that again that was I was reading a story about a young lady who had had studied three years a specific subject at all in fact she had written to paper and all and she was approached by somebody and they started talking about this subject they started making fun of her and they were quoting her from her paper you don't know this but I know this so she's finally said who's the author of that paper and they'd written and she was that's me sometimes who you're dealing that could be a child of God that music I mean that's love one another it be kind amen Phil my way every day was enough as I walk amen let me walk blessed Lord [Music] in the leading stranger [Music] feel my way [Music] let me [Music] [Applause] let me [Applause]
