and Israel shall dwell safely and this and this is his name whereby he shall be called and then in all capitals it says the Lord our righteousness and brother Lyall can give you the translation Jehovah something therefore behold the days come saith the Lord that they shall no more say the Lord liveth which brought us brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt but the Lord

hall is done and then I'm looking forward to having some sort of a gathering and I want to honor our our um veterans honor our folks that have been around for a while that have been through the battles and uh once we get that done and then our fellowship hall done I'm looking forward having some sort of a dinner or something for our the pillars in the church um I uh I looked at uh brother John's been overseeing it looked they knocked the wall down and stuff and it made me think about the book of Nehemiah and building the wall it been like I don't know three months ago that I ministered on Nehemiah and I and I talked about they built that wall in like 52 days entire circumference around Jerusalem they got they got it all built and fortified and I compared it to my little wall around my house and it's still not done it's been months and months and brother John's just a little wall you know and and uh I don't know what it is but uh we need some of those old-fashioned contracts I think brother John's one of those that know how to get stuff done um so we're going to continue on our Bible study tonight and we're going to hit one of the most important the most pivotal books written in the entire Bible and that's this book of Jeremiah to really understand Jeremiah I think that we need to put it in historical context we've gone through um Ruth and Esther and Nehemiah and uh Ezra those happened the um Nehemiah and um the uh those happened after this what we're going to talk about is the Captivity tonight we're going back in time and we're tackling this book of Jeremiah which is before what we call the Captivity to set this in historical context the Jewish Nation um really started with the patriarch Abraham Abraham God came to Abraham he was just one of the normal people out that populated The World God comes to Abraham he gives us this Pro gives him this promise and he says that you are going to be the father of many nations and he tells them about this promised land that he wants Abraham to go to Abraham gets there the the promise is fulfilled in really just one son and that was his son Isaac and then Isaac has a son and this next son is called is named Jacob Jacob's name was changed to Israel and Israel had 12 sons I know this is review from those 12 sons come the 12 tribes of Israel which is also Jacob so they they go down through um Through Time Joseph is uh was the second youngest of the 12 he um there's a famine in the land and as you know Joseph uh stores up the grain there's a there's a time of Plenty and Joseph prophesies that there's going to be a a lean time so Joseph stores up the grain eventually his father Jacob comes to Egypt to sojourn there because there was grain in Egypt and there was a Great Famine throughout the rest of the world world he comes back and he sojourns in Egypt and they are there that family which are the 12 tribes of Israel they are there for about 400 years in Egypt away from their Homeland that God had given to Abraham so after a while as we know that Joseph was very preferred by pharaoh and that lasted for a number of generations and after a while there Rose a pharaoh that didn't know Joseph he didn't care about this history of the blessings that were upon Joseph and his family so he put the Israelites into bondage and then God sent a deliverer named Moses Moses came and brought the the uh Hebrew children the the children of Israel out of Egypt they wandered in the wilderness for 40 years they they came right up to the Jordan River across the Jordan River was that Promised Land Moses dies Joshua takes up the mantle of being a prophet and and leading the people he brings the people over into this land called Canaan which is the promised land now in the land of Canaan it was a very sinful land it was uh sexually immoral it was full of Idol ol olry it was a it was a bad place and God kept giving instructions to his people don't follow the way that they live and he would give instructions the people would heed those instructions they it would wear off they would start falling into the sin that was in the land then God would send a judge or a great man of God or a great woman of God in certain cases and bring them out of that and they would fall back into it so it was basically there is this cycle going on that the people would sin God would send they would sin and they would they would be persecuted and invaded and killed and tortured and all of these then God would send a deliverer and that deliverer would deliver them they'd be good for a little while and then there was this Con continuing cycle of sin and deliverance so after this the kings came Saul was the first king of Israel formed this great country of Israel and then after Saul David came the the really the greatest of all the kings of Israel then after him was Solomon after Solomon was here Solomon's son was not a good not a moral man the Kingdom of Israel split up into two different kingdoms one was called Israel the other was called Judah Judah was from the line of King David and Israel was and Benjamin Israel was from the other 10 tribes so this goes on for a while Judah had some good Kings in their in their uh country Israel after Solomon never had a good King so if if you ever know of a good King and there's a you playing trivia with someone it was a good King it was never from Israel it would have been from Judah so this goes along Israel gets worse and worse and worse Israel actually is dispersed um it's invaded and then Judah because it had some good Kings carries on and it carries on until this King really the last good king of Judah named Josiah Josiah we've we've heard about him I I preached a whole sermon on him Josiah is the one that that the guy found the Bible in in the church and he comes out and and he's like you look at this it's the word of God it's a Bible I mean they didn't know the they didn't have a Bible in church that's how bad it got so then they give this Bible to Josiah this this book of the Scrolls Josiah reads it and he says we are really bad so Josiah makes changes in the um in Judah and during Josiah's Reign is when this man Jeremiah comes on the scene Jeremiah was uh we we we studied Isaiah a couple weeks ago Jeremiah is going to be the prophet that is prophesying at the destruction of Israel Israel is going to be invaded by a king from the north and this is really this is the end of Israel this is the end of end of Judah it's over this is the end of that sovereign country this is their last king that's going to come along during Jeremiah's uh Pro prophesying and then Israel is no longer a sovereign country with their own King that now they do go back and they are able to resettle after this captivity that I'm going to talk about tonight but they're no longer a country there was a little time that's not recorded in the Bible but there's a little time in history from the time of Malachi to the time of Jesus that uh these these great men named their name was makabe there was a little time in there that Israel had a a a country but it was just very very shortlived and as I said it's not recorded in the Bible so this is it so what I'm talking about tonight this is the end of the country and it didn't come back until our generation wow until the 1940s when Israel again became a sovereign country it's always been controlled by someone else by another country so this is the end Jeremiah is prophesying at the end of this of this great um Legacy of Israel and this is the destruction so you can see how important that this time is for Israel it's a it's an extremely pivotal time Jeremiah started prophesying when King Josiah was here and we have to understand a little bit of the Kings that's that's coming after Josiah so Josiah was there he's really the last good king of Israel and then then we have after him jehoahaz I believe that was his son and then he was just for a short time just for like three months jeim he was there for 11 years he was jehoahaz his brother then there was jeho chin so there's jeho Kim there's jeho chin and he was only there for about three months and then the last king of Judah is this man named zedekiah he's really the last king of Israel Israel um of all of Israel so the the country of Israel had ceased to exist earlier and now Judah was still left and this zedekiah is the last king and he is conquered this country is conquered by the one of the most ruthless stranded Kings that's ever recorded in this Bible that man's name do you know that man's name Nebuchadnezzar very great powerful man Jeremiah is prophesying he's warning the people that this this is coming this Invasion from the north is coming and that's most of most of the book about half of the book and then he um is prophesying during the evasion and then after so so the book of Jeremiah is basically mainly a collection of prophecies that's given and I'll tell you what if you read Jeremiah just like uh brother Josiah read read one of the scriptures you talk about some great on liners from from this book oh man there it is just rich in wisdom so it's a collection of prophecies and then after this book Jeremiah uh pens another book called The Lamentations so in Jeremiah he just he had a hard life it was very very difficult I I read him and you almost just want to cry because of the life that he lived it was hard nobody respected him except for maybe his his loyal scribe named baroo who who is introduced later on in the book um but nobody listened to him he was and he was prophesying all the time he he was prophesying that that this this king is going to invade from the north because of your sin repent from your sin all the time he's he's saying this and no one would listen to him and it became more and more sinful and as we will get to shortly there were prophets in the land at that time and these prophets were prophesying good things for Israel very positive saying that oh we're going to We Will Conquer them and and and we're not going to be in bondage anymore and and just very very positive good prophecies but they were false the true Prophet was Jeremiah and we we uh as as we get into this there will be and and I'll just say it right now there's there's three invasions really that come from this King of the North Nebuchadnezzar he come he comes in and uh takes captives every time he comes in and just takes a little bit more and it ends with the complete destruction of Jerusalem and the burning of the temple and and taking all the things out um so let's let's get into it let's go to let's start I think a good place to start is Jeremiah chapter 1 it reads like the the words of Jeremiah the son of hilaya of the priests that were in ano anoto in the land of Benjamin to whom the word of the Lord came remember Benjamin and Judah they're they're together to whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son of Ammon king of Judah in the 13th year of his Reign so Jeremiah he prophesied 40 at least 40 years probably over 40 years so this book covers a long period of time it came also in the days of jeim the son of Josiah king of Judah unto the end of the 11th year of zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the 15th month so Jo Messiah jeim and zedekiah they had a significant amount of time the other two that we mentioned they were just a few months then the word of the Lord came unto me Jeremiah speaking saying before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations now as brother Jordan and sister Martha as you were traveling you probably saw some Billboards depending on where you were you probably saw at least one maybe maybe two or three or four billboards with this scripture on it this scripture is generally used by the anti-abortion side and what they're doing is they're taking the the scriptures and they are trying to prove by the scriptures that life begins in the womb and and not outside of the womb I think a better scripture to use would be maybe Genesis 25 when I think it's Genesis 25 when um Esau and Jacob are actually fighting inside the womb so it shows that that there is some sort of Consciousness there we may not remember it but there is something about life in the womb the Bible very plainly teaches that life begins in the womb and not outside in the scripture that says the well it talks about in the second part of that scripture it talks about that Jeremiah Was Not only a prophet to Judah but he's a prophit to all the nations of the world and we will see that a little bit later towards the end so verse number five again it says before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I ordain thee a prophet unto the Nations then said I oh Lord God behold I cannot speak for I am a child so Jeremiah was probably in his 20s right here and he gave this response that many prophets give and which is something on the order of I'm not capable of doing what you want me to do now these prophets are very gifted men so when they when they when God ordains them to do something not only do they see like Lord this is a big deal I'm not capable of doing it like Moses he said well I can't because I I can't talk I stutter Isaiah when God ordained him Isaiah is like I'm a sinful man H how can I do this and Jeremiah says here he says I'm too young to do this so they see not only are they being humble and they say that well I'm not I'm not worthy to do something like this I'm not capable of doing something like this but they're also prophets born prophets and ordained of God and they understand the gravity of the situation and they understand that what if I say something wrong what if I I if the Lord gives me that much Authority and that much power what if I lead the people astray they understand the importance of their position and they can see that if they say something wrong or if they teach something wrong it can mean someone's salvation and this office of a prophet is a very high and very important office that they most of the prophets like I don't want that but you see many of the other ones is like I'm a prophet of God and I'm going to prophesy and I'm going to do all this and it's and they're not thinking because they don't have that understanding they're not thinking of the the importance of their job so you see Jeremiah he sees that and he's like well I'm not capable because I'm young but I believe Jeremiah also saw that he has this message to give and it's a vital vital importance so let's keep going balum by the way balum is a perfect example of a gifted prophet of God that didn't take his position seriously he comes and he's he's he's he's a prophet and he's gifted he has the gift of Prophecy and he he goes and and and this gift manifests itself but he goes and and he he uses his gift for popularity and he uses it for money and he ends up leading many Israelites into sin and death because of the doctrines that he taught of mixing with the world verse number seven Jeremiah talking again but the Lord said unto me say not that I am a child for Thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee and whatsoever I command thee Thou shalt speak be not afraid of their faces for I am with thee to deliver thee sayeth the Lord then the Lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth and the Lord said said unto me behold I have put my words in thy mouth sim a similar thing happened to Josiah or Jeremiah's predecessor Isaiah where the seraphim took the burning coal brought it down and and touched his lips and cleanse the prophets the prophet's mouth so he could speak the the words of the Lord see I have this day set thee over the Nations and over the kingdoms to root out and to pull down and to destroy and throw down and to build and to plant Jeremiah's Ministry was difficult as you'll see moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying Jeremiah what seest thou and I said I see a rod of an ometry so Jeremiah the prophet is seeing a vision here and when a prophet sees a vision brothers and sisters usually he has no idea what that is it's not until God tells him or shows him what it is that he understands Daniel and and all the prophets they would see a vision they would either write it down or they would speak it and I it's very plain that they don't know what it is now watch if he knew what it is now the next verse wouldn't be necessary then he said unto me thou H has well seen for I will hasten my word to perform it remember a rod there's a difference between a rod and a staff a staff Jacob leaned on his staff it helped him walk the shepherd takes the staff and he's able to to maybe pull the the the sheep or the lamb out of the sticker Bush and he's and he tends to the Sheep the rod is short it's like this big Aaron's Rod fit in the ark the Ark of the Covenant and the Ark of the Covenant was about that big so that is a hardened piece of wood that is used as a weapon to beat off wool or whatever it is so he says here the Lord said unto me thou Hast seen for I will hasten my word to perform it and the word of the Lord came unto me the second time saying what seest thou and he said I see a sething pot and the face thereof is toward the North Babylon was located to the north and east of Jerusalem and right and right at the get-go of the book of Jeremiah God is prophesying Jeremiah is prophesying that this invasion is coming the Lord said unto me out of the North and evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land for lo I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north sayeth the Lord and they shall come and they shall set everyone his throne at the entering of the Gates of Jerusalem and against the walls thereof round about and against all the cities of Judah and I will utter my judgments against them touching all of their wickedness who have forsaken me he's talking about his own people he's talking about the people of Judah who have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods and worshiped The Works of their own hands that was a bad time back then so he's saying worship The Works of their own hands they're the ones that made the idols out of out of stone and carved them out of stone and out of wood so they make these idols and then they worship the idols that they've made with their own hands how much better was that than it is today now what do we we worship we're not necessarily worshiping something that we've made with our hands today we worship ourselves we have all of these shrines made up to ourselves and on social media and and we we take all the pictures of ourselves and put them up there and and look at them and who is worshiping that who who is the one that looks at the picture the most we do if it's our own picture we're the ones looking at it it looks like it's worse now than it was back then verse number 17 thou therefore G up thy loins and arise and speak unto them all that I command I'm not saying social media is wrong don't don't get me wrong um but what I'm saying is you have to look at this stuff I'm not telling you to erase your social media account what I'm saying is many of these things that we see today are self exaltation self worship and worshiping of influencers or famous people yeah and I believe it is just I believe it's worse than what it was in making an idol and sticking in in your house or in your front yard or whatever it was that they used to do therefore thou therefore G up thy loins and arise and speak unto them all that I command thee be not dismayed at their faces lest I confound thee before them for behold I have made thee this day a defense City and an iron pillar and Brazen walls against the whole land against the kings of Juda against the princes thereof against the priests thereof and against the people of the land and they shall fight against theee but they shall not Prevail look at how he's encouraging his servant they shall fight against thee but they shall not Prevail against thee for I am with thee sayeth the Lord to deliver thee trust me I'm doing these things not you it's not it's not you that has to be capable it's me this is the first warning of what's to what's to come so let's go to Jer Jeremiah chapter 2 start with verse four hear the word of the Lord oh House of Jacob and all the families of Israel thus sayeth the Lord what iniquity have your fathers found in me that they are gone far from me and have walked after vanity and are become vain does this not sound like today from what I just said when has there ever been vanity like there is today neither said they where is the Lord that brought us up out of the land of of Egypt that led us through the Wilderness through the land of deserts and of pits through the through a land of drought and of the shadow of death through the land that no man passes through and where no man dwelt and I brought you into a plentiful country to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof but when you entered you defiled my land and made my Heritage an Abomination the priest said not where is the Lord and they that handle the law knew me not the pastors also transgressed against me and the prophets prophesied by Baal and walked after things that do not profit wherefore I will yet plead with you sayeth the Lord and with your children's children I plead so here is God and he's pleading out please serve me please don't go to this this to this sin many of parents those of you that are parents have probably done the same thing with your children please don't go there they'll end in your destruction you can see a father here how much he cares he he says even your priests which preach the preach the word even they didn't know me remember who crucified Jesus it wasn't the heathen Romans and it wasn't the peasants the simple people heard him gladly it was the priests that didn't know the word they didn't know God they may have known the word but they didn't know God they didn't have that relationship with him they crucified the Son of God because they didn't have that relationship with him and here is Jeremiah saying these these guys they didn't they don't God they don't know God either then we can go on to chapter 4 and Jeremiah continues to call the people to repentance and prophesy that there is coming this Invasion from the north he continually says it let's start with verse 14 he says this he says oh Jerusalem wash thine heart from wickedness that thou mayest be saved how long shall thy vain thoughts Lodge with thee for a vorce declareth from Dan and publish Affliction from Mount Ephraim make ye mention to the Nations behold publish against Jerusalem that the Watchers come from a far country and give out their voice against the cities of Judah as keepers of a field they are against her roundabout because she hath been rebellious against me sayeth the Lord thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee this is thy wickedness because it is bitter because it reaches unto thine heart he's he is crying out against the sin going on in Judah he says my bowels my bowels I am pained at my very heart my heart maketh noise in me I cannot hold my peace because thou Hast heard oh my soul the sound of the trumpet the alarm of War English Standard Version says my anguish my anguish I writhe in pain all the walls of my heart my heart is beating wildly I cannot keep silent for I hear the sound of the trumpet the alarm of War he's warning this is coming this is a serious thing and nobody's listening to me is what he's crying out destruction upon destruction is cried for the whole land is spoiled spoiled suddenly are my tents spoiled and my curtains in a moment how long shall I see the standard and hear the sound of the trumpet for my people is foolish they have not known me they are stish children I wouldn't let my kids say this word when they were young that means stupid it's Old English it doesn't it doesn't have any meaning today um King written hundreds of years ago that word saish means stupid and it's over and over he says it Jeremiah does throughout his book they are stupid children and they have none understanding they are wise to do evil but to do good they have no knowledge he's crying out this Prophet chapter 5 so we see the prophets and the priests they're prophesying good things for Israel like don't worry about it it's all right everything's good you know God's with us and God's going to take care of us and God's a consuming fire and God's Great and God's powerful and Jeremiah's there wh he's like yeah but but wait God's coming to destroy this place and all the other ones in they're positive everybody wants to hear a POS positive prophecy but here the prophet is saying no no no this is coming judgment verse number 12 in chapter 5 they have bellied the Lord and said it is not he neither shall evil come upon us neither shall we see a sword nor famine it's all good don't worry about it God's in control we're Judah we're the sons of David claim your inheritance speak to word be strong it sounds good but it was against God's word and Jeremiah is really just crying out from God and he's saying you're not all that you need to get back to God and the prophet shall become wind and the word is not in them thus it be done unto them wherefore thus sayith the Lord God of hosts because you speak this word behold I will make my word in thy mouth this is God speaking I love this part because you speak this word Jeremiah behold I will make my words in thy mouth fire and this people would and it shall devour them lo I will bring up I will bring a nation upon you from afar oh House of Israel sayeth the Lord it is a mighty nation it is an ancient Nation a nation whose language thou knowest not neither understandeth what they say continuing prophesying of this Babylon this great this great invador that's coming their quiver is an open SE open seler it's a grave and they are allmighty men chapter 6 verse one it says oh ye children of Ben Benjamin gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem and blow the trumpet into COA and set up a sign of Fire and Beth a aarum for evil appear out of the North and great destruction it's coming it's coming it's coming you better get ready Jeremiah looked around not only did he have word from the Lord but he looked around and he saw the sin that was everywhere there may have been good people and churches in fact there were Jeremiah mentions a couple of them but for the whole he looked around and he saw mocking the last supper at the Olympics wow he saw what surrounds us he saw these things and he knew that this would not last chapter 7 verse 8 poor Jeremiah he was by himself and doing this he was crying out and he wasn't you have to when you read the Bible you have to know look at the whole old the whole thing many people make Jeremiah as this man that was just like we see the the street preach preachers out there and they they just like mock um mock people and just condemn people and yell at them and insult them and do all that uh that wasn't Jeremiah Jeremiah you'll see later on actually had an audience with the king so it may not say it directly but he was respected even though he was hated there was still respect there chapter 7:8 behold you trust in lying Words that cannot profit they keep telling you it's okay it's good you're fine will you steal murder and commit adultery and swear falsely and burn incense under bail and walk after other gods who you you knew whom you knew not and come and stand before me and this house which is called by my name he's talking about coming in and worshiping you're going to live a sinful life six days a week and then you're going to come to church take communion we are delivered come and say before me stand in my house which is called by my name and you and you say we are delivered to do all these to do all these Abominations you're saying I'm a Christian I'm I live good and and everything's good in my life life and and oh boy I love the Lord and then you're out sinning this is exactly what Jeremiah is addressing here verse number 16 therefore pray not thou for this people God telling Jeremiah wow don't pray for these people neither lift up a cry nor prayer for them neither make intercession to me for I will not hear thee see us thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem there Comes A Time and this is the time of Jeremiah the prophet when God has enough he says I'm done with it and I don't want to hear about it anymore and here's what he that's what he told his Prophet just now chap Jeremiah chapter n he's called the weeping prophet many times listen look at his compassion even when God puts up his hand and says don't even pray for them Jeremiah says this he says oh that my head were Waters and mine eyes I Fountain of tears that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people oh that I had the Wilderness a lodging place of a way of wayfaring men that I might leave my people and go from them for they be adulterers and assembly of the treacherous men let's go to chapter 13 chapter 13 Jeremiah's prophecies take a bit of a different direction so before he's claiming very specifically there is coming an invasion from the north it's going to destroy us because of all the sin now he takes a different direction and here is another way that prophets prophesy and that is using symbolism Jeremiah 13 says this thus said the Lord unto me go and get thee a linen girdle and put it upon thy loins and put it not in water so I got a girdle according to the word of the Lord and I put it on my loins and the word of the Lord came unto me the second time saying take the girdle that thou Hast got which is upon thy Lo loins and arise and go to Euphrates and hide it there in a hole of the rock so I went and hid it by Euphrates as the Lord commanded me and it came to pass after many days that the Lord said unto me arise and go to Euphrates and take the girdle from then which I commanded thee to hide there and then I went to you to the Euphrates and digged and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it and behold the girdle was marred it was dirty and it was profitable for nothing then the word of the Lord came unto me saying the girdle by the way it's it's probably a a loin cloth just a something to put around put around himself then the word of the Lord came unto me saying thus sayeth the Lord thus sayeth the Lord after this manner thus sayith the Lord after this manner will I Mar the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem this evil people which refused to hear my words which walk in the imagination of their heart and walk after other gods to serve them and to worship them shall even be as this girdle which is good for nothing for as the the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah sayeth the Lord that they might be unto me for a people and for a name and for a praise and for a glory but they would not hear say I wanted so bad for them to just cleave to me and be with me and love me and and and stick and just stick with me all the time but they wouldn't hear skip to verse 27 for time sake I have seen th adulteries and thy naings and the lewdness and whoredom and thine Abomination on the hills and the field wo W unto thee o Jerusalem wilt thou not be made clean when shall it once be he's crying out this is God he's saying please don't go in that direction in Jeremiah it's one after the other after the other and he just continues to do it he does it in symbolism he does it straightforward he tells Jeremiah in chapter 16 he says don't get married don't even bring a child into this country because it's it's going to be terrible to live here the word of the Lord came also unto me saying Thou shalt not take thee a wife neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place for thus sayeth the Lord concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place and concerning their mothers that bear them and concerning their fathers that begot them in this land they shall die of Grievous death they shall not be lamented neither shall they be buried but they shall be as dung upon the face of the Earth and they shall be consumed by The Sword and by famine and their carcasses shall be meat for the fowls of heaven and for the beasts of the earth so Jeremiah had no wife he had no children then in chapter 18 tells the story famous story that we've talked about before the story of the Potter in The Potter's House and it gives some hope for Israel you have this Potter and he's making this this clay pot and it gets marred it gets messed up and then he's able to reform it and he tells Israel that that he would be a he could reform all of us even through our sins and our mistakes and all of that if we would just just devote Our Lives to him he can take this these problems and he can he can change it and then in chapter 19 he says take the Potter the pot from The Potter's House and he says smash it this angers the ruler that's there in Jerusalem and he puts him in prison puts him in jail for a while in chapter 20 it says that um chapter 20 Jeremiah sees nobody's listening to him all he's doing is suffering all the preaching isn't having an effect the people won't believe what he's saying and he gets discouraged and he mainly gets discouraged here he gets discouraged with the Lord like why am I doing all this Lord if if you're with me verse seven says this oh Lord he says you induced me and I was persuaded make sure I have the right place here okay I'm going to read the uh I'm going to read read the new King James version it says this and they just follow along with the King James it's says oh Lord you induced me and I was persuaded you are stronger than I and have prevailed I am in derision daily everyone mocks me for when I spoke I cried out I shouted violence and plunder because the word of the Lord was made to me a reproach and a derision daily then I said I will not make mention of him nor speak anymore in his name that's rough you can see the prophet here he was was down he was sad he says I'm done with it I'm not preaching anymore I'm not making any mention of the Lord anymore it's not working this is all bad Lord I've cried out to you you haven't helped me and then he says this but his word was in my heart again I'm in the new King James but his word was in my heart like a burning fire shut up in my bones I was weary of holding it back and I I could not he says I I wanted to give up but God is so good he is so he's he's everything to me he's all the way to the burning in my bones how I love God I was weary of holding it back and I could not verse number 10 for I heard many mocking fear on every side rep report they say and we will report it so they were making fun of the servant of God saying you're saying all this destruction is coming why don't you tell us then we'll go tell everybody what you say Jeremiah all my acquaintances watched for my stumbling saying perhaps he can be induced then we will prevail against him and we will take our revenge on him verse number 11 but the Lord is with me as a mighty awesome one therefore my persecutors will stumble and will not Prevail they will be greatly ashamed for they will not Prosper their Everlasting confus confusion will never be forgotten verse 12 but oh lord of hosts you who test the righteous and see the mind and the Heart let me see your Vengeance on them for I have pleaded my cause before you now watch the spirit of the Lord come upon the prophet sing to the Lord praise the Lord for he has delivered the life of the poor from the hand of the evildoers and he goes back cursed be be the day in which I was born lest the day not be blessed in which my mother bore me let the man be cursed who brought me news to my father saying a male child has been born to you making him very glad and let that man be like the cities which the Lord overthrew and did not relent let him hear the Cry of the morning and the shouting at noon because he did not kill me from the womb back to what I started with and the abor abortion question because he did not kill me from the womb that my mother might have been my grave and her womb always enlarged with me he's saying I was inside my mother and she could have been my grave why did I come forth from the womb to see the to see labor and sorrow that my days should be consumed with shame the weeping prophet and one of the greatest men that has ever walked the Earth see how he lamented see how he spoke he says cursed be the day I was born in Jeremiah chapter 21 and this is the clearest of Jeremiah's prophecies right here about Nebuchadnezzar and Babylon invading the word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord when King zedekiah sent unto him paser the son of Mah and Zephaniah the son of Messiah the priest saying inquire I pray thee of the Lord for us for Nebuchadnezzar King of B Babylon maketh war against us if so be that the Lord will deal with us according to all his wondrous wondrous works that he may go up from us then said Jeremiah unto them thus shall you say to zedekiah thus sayeth the Lord God of Israel behold I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands wherewith you fight against the king of Babylon and against the calans which Bes besiege you without the walls and I will assemble them into the midst of this city and I myself will fight against you Judah I will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm even in anger and in Fury and in great wrath and I will Smite the inhabitants of this city jerus Jerusalem both man and Beast they shall die of a great pestilence and afterward the Lord saith I will deliver zedekiah king of Judah and his servants and the people and such as are left in this city from his from the pestilence from The Sword and from the famine into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon that's a pretty plain prophecy and into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those that seek their life and he shall Smite them with the edge of the sword and he shall not spare them neither have pity nor have mercy and unto this people Thou shalt say thus sayeth the Lord behold I set before you the way of life and the way of death he that abideth in this city shall die by the sword by famine and by pestilence but he that goeth out and fth to the Cal caldan be that besiege you he shall live and his life shall be unto him for a prey for I have set my face against this city for evil and not for good sayeth the Lord and it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon and he shall burn it with fire so he's saying here don't resist these people go with them when they come in this destroying group give up then it happened exactly the way that the prophet had prophesied three times Babylon invades Jeremiah kept prophesying during this Invasion I think as brother Josiah read Jeremiah chapter 23 verse six gives he gives some encouragement in these days Judah shall be saved and Israel shall dwell in safety and this shall and this is his name whereby he shall be called the Lord our righteousness for behold the days come sayeth the Lord that they shall no more say the Lord liveth which brought up the children out of Israel out of the land of Egypt but the Lord liveth which brought us up and which led us led the seed of the House of Israel out of the North country and from the countries wherewith I have driven them and they shall dwell in their own land he's prophesying of what's going to happen many many hundreds of years later verse number 23 I have it underlined in my Bible and it's it's one of my favorite scriptures in the whole in the whole Bible and I I just wanted to read it it says this am I a god at hand sayeth the Lord and not a God God a far off he's saying that he's saying I'm a God that's close I'm here with you don't think that I'm way out there but I am a God that's close in chapter 25 Jeremiah prophesies that Judah will be held in captivity for 70 years so when this Nebuchadnezzar comes in he pulls out the captives and they will be in Babylon for 70 years and that's something that we will refer to when we get to the Prophet Daniel who was one of the young men that were taken out of Judah and placed into captivity in Babylon another Prophet so Israel's finally attacked chapter 28 Nebuchadnezzar had taken the captives and the wealth of the temple and then he tells this story about this man this Prophet named hananiah and what happens Jeremiah was wearing this yoke over his head which is a wooden um like stocks and he's wearing this symbolic and he goes in and all the courts there and the King's there and all this and and hananiah prophesies the Bible says he's a prophet hananiah prophesies and he says that all the stuff that Nebuchadnezzar has taken out God's going to fight for us and all of this stuff that he's taken within two years he's going to bring it back and he's going to bring all the captives back he's like yay and then he goes up to Jeremiah and he breaks the Yoke that Jeremiah is carrying and he says this symbolizes the Yoke of the Babylonians that has the the has Judah captive sounded really good man if you look in the Bible it's like wow that sounds like a real prophecy and you can imagine everybody was all happy everybody's just re rejoicing that this time of of captivity and all of these problems are going to be over Jeremiah he responds saying I pray that that's so so he goes he leaves in verse 13 He says this God tells Jeremiah he says go tell haniah thus sayith the Lord you have broken the yolks of wood this is the new King James version you have broken the yolks of wood but you have made in their places yolks of iron for thus sayeth the Lord of hosts the god of Israel I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon and they shall serve him I have given him the beasts of the field also so as we go through the next books you can find a common theme in the prophets they condemn and then they give you hope they condemn and they give you hope but right here he says no that yoke is going to stay so for time sake verse uh in chapter 36 we're introduced to uh Jeremiah's scribe this loyal friend named baroo and um the um then in we go we go through and what happens is and I'll summarize the rest of the book so Nebuchadnezzar invades steals all all the stuff out of the temple and desecrates it and and just destroys Jerusalem he go the The King that was reigning at that time as I said in the beginning was this King named zedekiah zedekiah um Jeremiah tells him he says don't leave he says Don't Run Away just give up to this guy makes zedekiah mad zedekiah throws him in this sstn this big pit so Jeremiah's down there in this muddy water and just just miserable and here comes the Babylonians they invade zedekiah he withstood the Babylonians against Jeremiah's um advice then he gets his family and they take off and they're sneaking away so they're caught by the Babylonians at the end of the the the um the battle there they they take zedekiah the king and they take his sons and set his sons before him and then they kill zedekiah's sons in front of of the king of him of zedekiah and then they gouge out zedekiah's eyes so this is the last thing that this man ever sees is his son's dying Nebuchadnezzar was an evil stranded man but he served a purpose we'll get when we get to the Book of Daniel God says Nebuchadnezzar my servant because God used him God used him to bring a hard hand against Judah and Nebuchadnezzar ends up later on ends up humbling himself so then we'll go to 52 and we'll close chapter 52 and it ends like this and it ends on a little bit of a positive note with zedekiah the King verse number 30 in the 3 and 20th year of Nebuchadnezzar nebu zeran the captain of the Guard carried away captive the Jews 74 and5 persons all the persons were 4,600 and it came to pass in the seventh year 7 and 30th year of the Captivity of jeho chin king of Judah in the 12th month in the five and 20th day of the month evil merodac how' you like to be named that that evil merodac king of Babylon in the first year of his Reign lifted up the head of jeho chin king of Judah and brought him forth out of prison and spake kindly unto him and set his throne above the Throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon and changed his prison garments and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life and as for his diet there was a continually diet given him of the king of Babylon and every a portion until the day of his death and all the days of his life and thus we close the book of Jeremiah on on that note that some kindness was showed to this king and the the musicians can come the kindness was shown to this King and he got to live out his days but the book of Jeremiah in summary you have this great prophet of God he prophesies more than 40 years over this time continually tells them stop sinning stop sinning stop sinning otherwise you we are going to get we're going to be invaded and destroyed they don't stop and they even killed their children I believe it's chapter 7 that they were sacrificing their children to these pagan gods these Canaanite gods learning the ways of the world Jeremiah is crying out against it doing everything that he can and then his prophecies as all prophets true prophets are prophecies come to pass the king of Babylon comes down destroys Jerusalem and thus we have the end of the Kings Nebuchadnezzar or um zedekiah was the last one they go into captivity we're going to get to Daniel Daniel's in captivity they were there how long did Jeremiah prophesy do you remember how long were they going to be there 70 years they they're there 70 years and Daniel just happens to be reading the book of Jeremiah and he sees wait a minute we've been here like 6768 years Jeremiah said we're going to be here 70 years so then he sees the prophecy and then they make ready and then we see as we had from I believe it was 2 Chronicles um we have the release through um zerubabel Ezra and Nehemiah and then they leave 70 years after this time that we just read today and they go back and they rebuild the walls but Jeremiah was a p p time a man had a very very hard life and a very sad life no one he didn't have a congregation like we have even this group that we have here 50-some people Jeremiah didn't even have that he was there he he was able to preach in the temple and and at the Gate of the temple but he just did what God told him and he was he was really not accept accepted and it wasn't until long after his death that he was gained the respect that we have for him today he's in heaven today and I think I know he's probably very very proud that he's stuck with God's word I just [Music] sayah glory to Jesus and tell of his love his wonderful love will give the glory to J Jesus and tell of his wonderful love will give the glor glory to Jesus and tell of his love his wonderful love will give all the glory to J Jesus and tell of his wonderful love [Music] I wanted to mention to when I was in Israel a few years ago I was in the city of David which is just outside of the walls of Jerusalem and they had recently found what they said what the tour guys said was the oldest scroll that they had ever found of the book of Jeremiah and we were able to look at the place that it was found there and it was kind of a a rich man's house and um everybody everybody was just excited they just found it within the past few months so it really thinking about Jeremiah where he lived and how he preached at the Gate of the temple and he ushered in one of the biggest changes to the country of Jerusalem that really has not changed until Jeremiah's own prophecy as as brother Josiah said at the beginning Jeremiah's own prophecy has come to pass in our day when Israel has come back to their Homeland and another prophecy that just I love so much is when Jeremiah said he said I will write my laws upon their hearts upon their flesh I really believe that is the infilling of the holy spirit of God that it comes down it's not anymore not anymore studying and and trying to to follow the letter of the law but the spirit of the law comes down and dwells in a human being through the Prophet The Prophecy from this man Jeremiah Amen Let just ey one more [Music] As the deer panteth for the water so my soul longth after thee you alone are my heart desire and I long to worship thee you Al alone Are My Strength my shield to you alone does my [Music] spir you alone are my heart desire and I long toship the brothers and sisters brother David if you would come forward to close brothers and sisters this book of Jeremiah as we go through it remember Jeremiah was living in a very very sinful time but I truly don't believe that he was any more sinful than the time that we are living today Jeremiah was crying out against the sins of the world a prophet of God and I believe that we have witnessed a prophet of God doing the same thing crying out against the sins of the world and warning us that time is short just look around you and then yet the people keep going and going and they get worse and they get worse and one day soon it's going to be worse than the king of Babylon invading these United States it's going to be worse than that and we have been warned so we need to take heed to These Warnings and take heed to this book of Jeremiah because it is very applicable to this day it's a hard book to read because it is just one prophecy after the next stop sinning stop sinning and then every every once in a while you get a little glimmer of hope and we have been given that little glimmer of hope brother and sisters it's coming the end is coming and we need to be ready Brother [Music] David let's go before the Lord in prayer Our dear gracious Heavenly Father we are very very thankful dear Lord God to come before you this particular time this hour
