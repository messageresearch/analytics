stand in reverence to the word I'm going to take a page out of brother Lyle's Playbook tonight and uh instead of reading our opening scripture out of the Book of Ezekiel I want to read it out of the book of Psalms so let's talk let's turn in our Bibles it just sounds better when he says that the original is always the best Psalm 137 I want you to listen to this Psalm close this Psalm is written about the beginning at least of the Book of Ezekiel and um it describes it perfectly psalm 37 says this by the Rivers of Babylon there we sat down yay we wept when we remembered Zion we hanged our Harps upon the Willows in the midst thereof for they for there they that carried us away captive required of us a song and they that wasted us required of us mirth saying sing us one of the songs of Zion how shall we sing the Lord's song In a Strange Land If I forget thee Oh Jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning if I do not remember thee let my tongue cleave to the roof of roof of my mouth if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief Joy remember oh Lord the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem who said raise it raise it even to the foundation thereof oh daughter of Babylon who art thou to be destroyed happy shall he be that rewardeth thee as thou has served us happy shall he be that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord these words of a man that was remembering his home and long to be there again father we pray that you would open up this word to us tonight during our Bible study and we pray Lord that that you would be pleased what is said and the thoughts upon my heart and the words out of my mouth the thoughts upon the people and the praise of the people Lord we pray that it would be acceptable to you in Jesus name amen God bless you you can be seated first I want to apologize for my attire tonight I uh been out all day and uh so I'm wearing my my work clothes I actually brought um a uh sport coat but it's blue and it doesn't match this very good at all so I figured I was really at I was really in a a quandry it's like do I do I not do I do I not I was thinking my wife would say no probably Dan you're you're you're didn't match so I uh I I pray that uh what's important will be what I say and now how I look um visitors brother what's your name back here Gideon Gideon God bless you oh you're Gideon's uh everybody knows knows your dad ministered here for a while God bless you welcome brother Gideon good to see you that's um brother uh uh Jason Watkins brother what's your dad's name brother Matt Watkins yeah everybody knows brother Matt brother Matt Watkins son God bless you welcome greet your family back [Applause] home and uh I think we got everybody else is just Home Folks um this um This Book of Ezekiel so brother Gideon what we do is on Wednesday night we have a Bible study and we're going through the Bible we're going from Genesis to Revelation we're taking one evening a week and we're dedicating that to one Bible book so we have come to the Book of Ezekiel um to to give a background to the Book of Ezekiel we had Jeremiah last week Jeremiah prophesied of the coming Invasion from the King of the North do you remember who the king of the north is Nebuchadnezzar this man very cruel um very powerful King Jeremiah U much of his ministry was prophesying that this man is coming and then towards the end of Jeremiah's um to his book then we see that Nebuchadnezzar invades Nebuchadnezzar invades actually invades Israel Jerusalem three times and I'm uh going down here I want to make sure I get my dates right the first time he invades is around 597 BC he comes in and uh he takes a number of uh people captive when he gets to Jerusalem do you know who one of the ones that he took captive was Daniel right Daniel he takes this young man Daniel captive brings him out then about eight years pass and he invades again and uh he takes this young this man young man Ezekiel captive takes them out and then the Third time he invades he completely destroys Jerusalem destroys the temple um lays Siege to it for two years they were starving to death they um it was just a very as brother Lyall prayed it was it was one of the hardest times that have ever been for God's people very difficult very um very tough tough time so in the Book of Ezekiel we'll read many many times in fact he says 60 times he Jeremiah will prophesy God will tell Jeremiah what to say and he'll say this that so that you'll know that I am the Lord and He prophesies these hardships to come and and that is the theme really of This Book of Ezekiel that he is he is prophesying he's called to be a prophet and God keeps let laying the hammer down on this um on Israel really so it um it starts with um it's it's obviously written probably by this this man Ezekiel Ezekiel is taken captive when he's fairly young and now he is in Jerusalem and he receives his commission as a prophet as as we're going to read in really in the first chapter it's the first that we know that God gave Ezekiel a um a prophecy to give and um it's just a it's really a very sad book Jeremiah was sad ezekiel's sad Ezekiel and Jeremiah both Servants of the Lord and and Prophets of the lord they're considered among the Major Prophets really the difference between a major prophet and a minor Prophet is just how much is written in the Bible the Minor Prophets have less written the Major Prophets have more written it's that simple doesn't mean one's greater than any other one they both spoke on behalf of the Lord Jeremiah and Ezekiel they had it they had it really rough and you look at really these Servants of the Lord and your heart just bleeds for them they're not prosperous men at all most of them aren't they they come and and they they give their lives to the Lord and then the Lord uses them and many times it's such a hard life we saw that Jeremiah how difficult his life was a couple weeks ago and now Ezekiel you're going to see a man that was equally suffered equally as much as Jeremiah and I look at this man Ezekiel and I think how could anyone be so dedicated to God as this man that's that's something that you may sound strange but when you hear what this man had to do it it's sad and he wasn't respected God even told him he said you're going to be a prophet but they're not going to believe you believe you Ezekiel they're not going to listen to you and he uh he still did what he was told he still prophesied and he dedicated just the dedication that these prophets have to God they truly don't care really don't seem to care about anything else they are so in tune with God and and willing to give everything and they are not treated well really the only thing that treats these prophets well is history many of them they're they're highly regarded in this book but during the time of their lives they've got it rough Jeremiah or Ezekiel he was he was told to lay on his side for a year eating just a little bit of food St basically starving to death cooking his food on dong and then laying on the other side for about another year and lay laying out there and then people walking by and surely making fun of him but just as a symbol about what God is going to do to this country of Israel very very as I said no one believed and there were Prophet other prophets prophesying at that time like with like with Jeremiah and they were prophesying good things and everybody wants a good prophecy it feels good and everybody listens to the good prophecies but it's these hard prophecies it's these Prophecies of coming judgment that were re at this time so it's just it's a very very difficult book very difficult story this man Ezekiel um so Ezekiel was as I said Daniel was taken captive which we if the Lord's willing we will get to next week this Ezekiel was taken captive in the second captivity and if you remember the PSAL he says this go back to Psalm 137 starts with this by the Rivers of Babylon there we sat down yay we wept when we remembered Zion so let's turn the Book of Ezekiel chapter 1 so ezekiel's young man is as you'll see see it was his birthday and he was turning 30 years old and he um he was there and he was just not feeling bad he had grown up his life to be a minister to be a preacher in God's Temple to be a priest that was the desire of his heart but then he was taken captive pulled out of his home and brought up north to this Heathen country and he didn't have a temple to preach in didn't have a church to preach in still called to be a minister and it was just was very discouraging this man so he comes as and as you read from the Psalms there's probably some other people with him and he comes down and he sits by this canal the place that they were at in Babylon the Tigers and the Euphrates River come through there and they would build canals from these two rivers and Ezekiel sits down by this canal and he's probably thinking wow 30 years old is when a priest is ordained and here I am 30 years old and in captivity no Temple to preach in my family or friends and all of that back in Jerusalem I don't know what to do so he sits down and here's what happens now it came to pass in the 30th year on the fourth month and in the fifth day of the month as I was among the captives by the river of by the river of kar most translations say by the canal kear that the heavens were opened and I saw the vision of God so it says here it came to pass in the 30th year it doesn't say the 30th year of Hezekiah it doesn't say the 30th year of Nebuchadnezzar it just says the 30th year which really could only be it was his 30th year that was his birthday and he says that the Heavens were opened and I saw visions of God in the fifth day of the month which was the fifth day which was the fifth year of King jehoich Chin's captivity the word of the Lord came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest the son of buzi in the land of the calans by the river Kar and the Hand of the Lord was there upon him and I looked and behold a whirlwind came out of the North and a great cloud and a fire infolding himself and the brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof as the color of amber out of the midst of the fire also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures and this was their appearance they had the likeness of a man and everyone had four faces and everyone had four wings and their feet were straight feet and their soul of their feet was was like the sole of a Cal's foot and they sparkled like the color of of burn of burnished brass and they had the hands of a man under their wings on their for on the on their four sides and they four had their faces and their and their wings their wings were joined one to another and they turned not when they went and they went everyone straight forward so these powerful angels were flying in formation flying straight and as for the likeness of their faces they four had the face they four had the face of a man and the face of a lion on the right side and they four had the face of an ox on the left side and they four also had the face of an eagle brother Jeremy has been telling me he's been going through the the church ages and um the seals well he said the church ages and the seals and the ages are there we know that from a study of the seals that during the Gentile dispensation after the the um the Jewish people they rejected the Lord God turned his face to the Gentiles and we know that Paul the Apostle Paul broke the ice there and he went out and brought this and and in the those 2,000 years of that Gentile dispensation remember it starts with Ephesus and it ends with leoa in those 2,000 years there are different ages inside of that time and those ages if you go to the Book of Revelation I believe it's in chapter 4 you see this scripture here repeated you'll see it repeated again in Ezekiel this scripture is repeated and it says that this this lion first is one of the insignias from the the tribe of Judah so it shows here that says that there's four faces here there's four things here and Judah would encamp and there would be four insignias one of those insignias the first one was the lion of the tribe of Judah and then the second one and that was that was the beginning of the ages there that was that was this boldness of the Lion and it went out and it was preaching the gospel and then time went on and then it went into this Ox age this lion was represented by Judah and then the ox age was represented by Ephraim and that was the laboring that they labored during those dark ages and then after that those ages came then the spirit of the man came and that Spirit of the man was the intelligence and and the being able to translate the scriptures and we see that in Luther and Wesley and then and that was Reuben and then in the last age it was the eagle age and the in Insignia of that of the four was Dan and that was the prophetic age the the the ending time age there and the closing of the Gentile dispensation we know that from a study on the church ages and the seals thus were their faces and their wings were stretched upward two Wings on every of every one were joined together and two covered their bodies I'm I'm sitting here because Ezekiel was sitting there when all of this happened and they went everyone straight forward whether the spirit was to go and they went and they turned not when they went as for the likeness of the living creatures their appearance was like burning coals of fire and like the appearance of lamps it went up and down and among the living creatures and the fire was was bright and all and out of the fire went forth lightning and the living creatures ran and returned and as the appearance of the flash of lightning now as I beheld the living creatures behold one wheel upon the Earth by the living creatures with his four faces the appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the color of barrel and they four had one likeness and their appearance and their work was as it were of a wheel in the middle of a wheel this is going to show up later on in Ezekiel when they went they went upon their four sides and they turned not when they went and as for their four wings they were so high that they were Dreadful and their their Rings were full of eyes round about them their their Rings which is their rims were full of eyes round about them and when the living creatures went the wheels went by them and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up with so withersoever the spirit was to go they went tither was their Spirit to go and the wheels were lifted up over against them for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels when those went these went and when those stood these stood and when those were lifted up from the earth these the wheels were lifted up over against them and the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels and the likeness of the Firmin upon the heads of the living creature was as the color of of terrible Crystal that word terrible doesn't mean the same now as it did when the King James was translated it means like Great and Powerful terrible Crystal stretched forth over their heads above and under the firmament were their wings straight and one toward the other everyone had two which covered on this side and everyone had two which covered on that side their bodies and they and when they went I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of Great Waters as the voice of the almighty the voice of the voice of speech as the noise of a host when they stood they let down their wings and there was a voice from the firmament that was over there heads when they stood and had let down their wings and above the firmament that was over their heads was like the appearance of a throne and the appearance of a sapphire stone and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above it and I saw the color of amber as the appearance of fire round about within from the appearance of his loins even upward and from the appearance of his loins even downward and I saw as it were were the appearance of fire and it had the brightness round about and as the appearance of a bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain so was the appearance of the brightness roundabout this was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord and when I saw it I fell upon my face and I heard a voice of one that spake so here he is he's he's seeing all of this he's sitting by this this this canal and all of this happens this vision goes and and all of these these powerful noises and all this and then he hears a voice and he said unto me son of man stand upon thy feet and I will speak unto thee so we see here the Lord is addressing his prophet and he says he says son of man son of man is it's a term that is um it's often misconstrued son of man basically means what it says it means the son of a human being it means you're a human being so when he's addressing here he's saying that you thou son of man he says he says listen to me you human being and later on we'll see in Daniel that God that Daniel will prophesy that the son of man is coming and he will have great power and great Authority and and that this son of man which is going to be Christ is going to basically be God on Earth so when you see Jesus when Jesus calls himself son of man that's why they hated him they wanted to kill him they said it was blasphemy because they were they knew the Book of Daniel but here in the Book of Ezekiel and in Jeremiah he's basically saying thou son of man you human being listen to me and the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me and set me upon my feet that I heard him that spake unto me notice the spirit of the Lord it he enters into Ezekiel when the Lord speaks so when when he he he's he comes in and Ezekiel as I said is a major prophet in the Bible but even Ezekiel he has to have the spirit of the Lord enter into him before he can prophesy and he said unto me son of man I send thee to the children of Israel to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me they and their fathers have transgressed me against me even unto this very day this story happens over and over again in the Bible ever since we've been going through our Bible studies the same thing they transgress against me the people sin against me now I will send a prophet and he will prophesy saying get right or else judgment is coming and once again nothing new we have a prophet prophesying against the sins of the people the sins of the people got very very bad in this time of the Captivity just before the Captivity they were living against the Lord's commandments they they were they were sinning they were living immorally they were cheating on their wives they were there's prostitutes everywhere it was a really sinful time so here is the the prophet Ezekiel sent like Jeremiah was sent to try to set these things straight but nobody listens to him for they are impotent children and stiff hearted I do send thee unto them and thou shalt say unto them thus sayith the Lord God so basic they're they're obstinate they're stubborn so he's saying say unto them this is what the Sovereign God says and they whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are a rebellious house yet shall they know that there hath been a prophet among them and thou son of man be not afraid of them neither be afraid of their words though briers and Thorns be with thee and thou doest well among the Scorpions be not afraid of their words nor be dismayed at their looks though they be a rebellious house so he's saying L listen Ezekiel they're not going to listen to you it's going to be a hard time don't be afraid of them don't be afraid of what they're going to do because I'm going to be with you and here's Ezekiel no one listens to the man no one cares about him but what a man that he says Lord I'm going to do whatever you say he says I'm going to do what you command and thou shalt speak my words unto them whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are most rebellious but thou son of man hear what I say to thee be not rebellious like that rebellious house open thy mouth and eat that I give that I give thee so this is something that is going to happen again also in the Book of Revelation where the Prophet is told to eat the Scrolls and when I looked Behold a hand was sent unto me and lo a roll of book was therein so we have a scroll and he spread it before me and it was written within and without and there was written therein Lamentations and mourning and woe moreover he said unto me son of man eat thou eat that thou findest eat this rooll and go and speak unto the house of Israel so I opened my mouth and caused me to eat the roll and he said unto me son of man cause thy belly to eat and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee and then I did eat and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness so he takes the word and he eats it and it's in his mouth and it tastes really good but then in the Book of Revelation it says that he eats it and it was good in his mouth but boy when it had time to sit it became bitter in his stomach it became hard it was good when you first get it when you first get the word but then there's something that comes along with getting it there's some suffering later on so then he goes back to the side so so he hears this voice again and and it's like an earthquake to him he hears the wheels turning again and the wings of the cheram as they touch one another and he says that he went in the bitterness and the Heat of the spirit and then he goes back to the side of this this canal and there he sits for 7 days and he's just overwhelmed with what had happened verse number um verse number 16 and it came to pass at the end of the seven days that the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man I have made thee a Watchman under the house of Israel therefore hear the word of my mouth and give them warning from me when I say unto the wicked Thou shalt surely die and thou givest him not warning nor speakest to warn the wicked from his Wicked way to save his life the same Wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will I require at thine hand if thou if thou warn the wicked and he turn not from his wickedness nor from his Wicked way he shall die in his iniquity but thou Hast delivered thy Soul again when a righteous man doth turn from his right his righteousness and commit iniquity and I lay a stumbling block before him he shall die because thou Hast not given him warning he shall die in his sin and his righteousness which he hath done not which he ha he which he hath done shall not be remembered but his blood will I require at thine hand nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man that the righteous sin that the righteous sin not and he do not sin he shall surely live because he is warned also thou Hast delivered thy soul and the Hand of the Lord was there upon me and he said unto me arise and go forth to the plain and I will talk with thee he's saying that these Watchmen were up above and they're looking out and if they see an invading Army come they'll blow the trumpet and that's their job here it comes here comes the invading army or Here Comes sin or Here Comes adultery Here Comes whatever you blow the trumpet now Ezekiel you tell them that this is wrong now you have done your part if they go and do it and they sin they will die in their sins but it's not your fault but if you don't tell them if you don't have enough courage to cry out against sin then that man dies because he gets invaded he gets killed by this invading Army and you also will suffer you will I will require your blood also because of his sin so Jeremiah or Ezekiel is here and he's following the Lord's words doing everything that he can warn these people and and what's going on now is is he's here he's he's prophesying out that these these invading armies are going to come and it's going to be really really bad in Jerusalem because of all their sins remember there had been two invasions there's one left and this last one is really bad and most of this the first half of This Book of Ezekiel the first part of This Book of Ezekiel he is prophesying that this is coming let's go to chapter four then Ezekiel starts doing he starts doing some strange things and these things are symbolic things before the people so they're not listening to his words so now God tells him okay instead of doing instead of is telling them now act these things out like make a play or or give give some sort of symbol here and then God tells him what to do he's now relating what is going to happen to Jerusalem in this upcoming Siege chapter 4 verse1 and thou also son of man take the a tile a brick and lay it before thee and portray it upon the city even Jerusalem so what he's doing is he's getting some like you know the kids play with like Legos and stuff action figures so that's what that's what Ezekiel is doing here he's getting these things together and he's building these this little like model as a symbol against Jerusalem and against the sin he says and thou son of man take the a tile a brick and lay it before thee and portray it upon the city even Jerusalem and lay SE lay seeg against it and build a fort against it and cast a mount against it set the camp also against it and set a battering rams against it round about so he's he's making all this and this little model in front in front of him moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the City and set thy face against it and it shall be besieged and thou shalt lay Siege against it this shall be assigned to the house of Israel so he builds this thing and it's a sign and then he goes on and does something else he says lie thou also upon thy left side you've heard that there was a prophet that laid on his side for many many days this is Ezekiel lie thou also upon thy left side and lay the iniquity of the House of Israel upon it according to the number of the days that thou shalt lay upon it Thou shalt bear their iniquity for I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity according to the number of the days 300 and 90 days so Thou shalt bear the iniquity of the House of Israel over a year and when thou Hast accomplished them lie again on thy right side and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah remember Israel in the north Judah in the South remember we have two different countries Israel's already gone by now already dispersed and conquered and and taken captive now Judah is the only one left so now bear the iniquity of the house of Judah 40 days I have appointed thee each day for a year therefore Thou shalt set thy face towards The Siege of Jerusalem and thine arm shall be uncovered so he pulls up a sleeve and thou shalt prophesy against it and behold I will lay bands upon thee and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another till thou Hast endured the days of The Siege Thou shalt also take unto thee wheat and barley and beans and lentils and Millet and FES basically barley beans lentils and and wheat and put them in a vessel and make thee bread thereof according to the number of the days that Thou shalt lay upon thy side 390 days shal thou eat thereof and thy meat basically your food which you shall eat shall be by weight you ever have a you ever go on a diet where you weigh your food put it on a scale this is the extreme this is not much food at all and thy meat your food which Thou shalt eat shall be by weight 20 shekels a day and from time to time Thou shalt eat it so he's on a very strict diet he must be starving to death laying there and thou shalt drink also Water by measure the sixth part of a hen from time to time Thou shalt drink shall thou drink and thou shalt eat it as barley cakes and thou shalt bake it with the dung that cometh out of a man in their sight later on Ezekiel asks he says he says Lord I've lived I've lived a good life he says I've lived like a priest I haven't let anything unclean come into me and then God makes concessions with Ezekiel and instead of using human dong he allows him to use cow dong to cook his food still rough the man had it had it hard serving God though Ezekiel chapter 7 we continue on with these with these prophecies and these these symbols he says this let's go to verse 23 he says make a chain so Forge a chain for the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence so he this this chain is an instrument of bondage and he says make this chain wherefore I will bring the worst of the Heathen and they shall possess their houses and I will also make the pomp of the strong wrong to cease and their holy places shall be defiled destruction cometh and they shall seek peace and there shall be none my Mischief shall come upon mischief and rumor shall be upon rumor then shall they seek a vision of the Prophet but the law Shall Perish from the priest and the council from the Ancients and the King shall mourn and the prince shall be clothed with desolation and the hands of the people and of the land shall be troubled I will do unto them after their way and according to their their deserts will I judge them and they shall know that I am the Lord those words as I said I am the Lord continually 60 times at least they happen in this in this book so we move on and remember this is just an overview of the Book of Ezekiel there are sermons after sermons after sermons in this book there are so many symbolic things that that happened dur during this but but we're looking just on kind of outside looking in just getting a big picture and we see that that again that he's prophesying against Jerusalem saying all of this is coming very similar to what Jeremiah did and then he says this verse uh chapter nine this is something that all of us are very familiar with verse one he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice saying cause them that have charge over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lith towards the North and every man a Slaughter weapon in his hand and one of them was clothed with linen with a riter's inkhorn by his side he's speaking supernaturally with a Rider's inhorn by his side and they went in and Stood Beside the Brazen Altar and the glory of the Lord the glory of the god of Israel was gone up from the Cherub whereupon he was this word cherub we we we talked about this a little bit in Jeremiah we talked about it in Isaiah these are great angels that guard the Throne of God they're the ones that um they they're just they're very very powerful and great angels and behold six men I said that and the glory of of Israel was gone up from the church whereof he was in the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the riter's inkhorn by his side and the Lord said unto him go thou in the midst of the city throughout the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the forehead of the men that sigh and cry for all the Abominations that be done in the midst thereof and the others the ones that don't have that Mark he said in my hearing go ye after them through the city and smite and let not your eye spare neither have ye pity slay utterly the old and the young both maids and little children and women but come not near unto any man unto whom is the mark and begin at My Sanctuary he's talking about Jerusalem begin at my temple and start killing these people start wiping them out but those ones that sigh and cry for the sins of the world don't touch them don't even go near them wow and began at My Sanctuary then they began at the ancient men which be were before the house so he goes and he sends this destroying Angel and I know it's it's very much symbolic of today and we see all the sins that are in the world we see all the problems that are in the world and how many people cared in ezekiel's time how many people were saved I bet you not one and we look at today and how many of us truly sigh and cry for the sins of the world this is going to come up here in a minute and it's beautiful that we see that Jeremiah was a perfect example of this so Ezekiel goes on and it's been rough so far but then we see a glimmer of hope in chapter 11 let's go to chapter 11 says this moreover the spirit lifted me up and brought me into the East Gate of the Lord's House which lookth Eastward and behold the door of the gate 5 and 20 men among whom I saw Janiah the son of azure and pelatiah the son of bayah princes of the people remember that name the pela it's like pelaton it's a like exercise thing so remember that name pelah the son of bayah and he said unto me son of man these are the men that that devise Mischief that G and give Wicked Council in this city which say it is not near let us build houses this is the cauldron and we be the flesh therefore prophesy against them so they're saying everything's good everything's okay don't worry about it therefore prophesy against them prophesy oh son of man now let's go to verse 13 and it came to pass when I prophesied that ptia the son of Bah died then fell I down upon my face and cried with a loud voice and said oh Lord God wilt thou make a full end to the remnant of Israel so here he is he just prophesied send this Angel out with his anchorn right on on them those that sigh and cry for the sins of the world and here is Jeremiah sighing and crying for this man pelatiah who is obviously an evil man but that he died look at the compassion that he had again in verse n n uh chapter 9 verse4 it says and the Lord said unto him go thou in the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for the Abominations that be done in the midst thereof so chapter 12 through 24 we continue with judgment after judgment after judgment rough prophecies so let's go to chapter 24 and it says this the parable of the Boiling Pot um for time sake we'll we'll continue on um let's go to let's go to Ezekiel 28 something that is very interesting here as we as we go on through this book there's many times in the Bible sometimes it's hard to distinguish is this a spiritual thing or is this a natural thing and this is one of those times where we're going to see back and forth between the two the king of Ty was a very arrogant man a very arrogant King that lived to the north of um of Israel and uh watch the condemnation here verse um chapter 28 verse one it says this the word of the Lord came again unto me saying son of man say unto the prince of Tyrus thus sayeth the Lord God because thine heart is lifted up and thou has said I am a God I sit on the seat of God in the midst of the Seas yet thou art a man and not God though thou set thine heart as the heart of God so something is influencing there's something influencing behind this king of tire behind this this Prince as he's called so it's hard right here are we distinguish is this is he talking about the actual king or is he talking about about the spirit influencing him behold Thou Art wiser than Daniel there is no secret that they can that they can hide from thee with thy wisdom and With Thine understanding thou Hast gotten the riches and H has gotten gold and silver into thy Treasures by thy great wisdom and by thy traffic traffic is trade like business hast thou increased thy riches and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches therefore thus sayeth the Lord God because thou Hast set thine heart as the heart of God behold therefore I will bring strangers upon thee the terrible of the Nations and they shall draw their swords against thee the beauty of thy wisdom and they shall defile thy brightness they shall bring thee down to the pit and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the Seas wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth Thee I am God the arrogance but Thou shalt be a man and no God in the hand of him that slayeth thee Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hands of strangers for I have spoken it sayeth the Lord God moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying so now ezekiel's taking he's taking a little bit different direction before he was addressing this king of Ty now he's addressing the spirit that's behind him son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of Ty and say unto him thus sayeth the Lord God thou seal us up the sum full of wisdom and perfect in Beauty thou Hast been in Eden the Garden of God when was the king of Ty in Eden who was in Eden the serpent was in Eden thou has been in Eden the Garden of God every precious stone was iy covering the Sardis the topaz and the diamond and the barrel and the onxx and the Jasper and the sapphire Sapphire the emerald and the carbunkle and the gold the workmanship workmanship of thy T tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created this man was this Angel this Spirit was really seemed like the greatest of all of them Thou Art the anointed cherub that coverthe so thou was a on the Holy Mountain of God thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire this man was great do you remember the Book of Job when Satan comes up before God and he says where you been he says I've been walking been going to and fro thou was perfect perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till the iniquity was found in thee so you cherub you great angel that was created you were perfect in the in your ways you were really one of the greatest of them all until there was some iniquity in You by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence thou has sinned therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the Mountain of God and I will destroy thee Oh covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up because of thy Beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness I will cast the vanity in this Spirit you've corrupted your wisdom because you were so bright you are so beautiful and you got your eyes on yourself I will cast thee to the ground I will lay thee before kings that they may be ho thee thou has defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee it shall devour thee and I will bring thee to the ashes upon the Earth in the sight of all them that behold thee and they that Know Thee among the people shall be astonished at thee Thou shalt be a terror and shalt never and never shalt thou be anymore you see how this Spirit was influencing this king of Ty how great he was but Ezekiel here he's calling this out in in Ezekiel 33 um he receives he talks again about this Watchman and then in verse 21 he receives word that isra is struck down let's go to verse 21 says this and it came to pass on the 20th year of our captivity in the 10th month in the fifth day of the month that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me saying the city is spent so a messenger came from Jerusalem all that that Ezekiel had been prophesying this messenger comes and says it's Fallen it's destroyed now the hand of the Lord was upon me in the evening a four that he was escaped and came and opened my mouth until he came to until he came to me in the morning and my mouth was opened and I was no more dumb and the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man they that inhabit those Wast of the land of Israel speak saying Abraham is one and he inherit inherited the land but we are many the land is given us for inheritance wherefore say unto them thus sayeth the Lord God ye eat with the blood and lift up your eyes towards the idols and shed the blood and shall ye possess the land you stand upon your sword you work Abomination and you defile everyone his neighbor's wife and ye and shall ye possess the land say thou unto them thus sayith the Lord God as I live surely they that are in the waste shall fall By The Sword and him that is an open field will I give to the Beast to be devoured and they that be in the Forts and in the caves shall die of pestilence so he's talking about these people that in invade and they too shall fall so then the last chapters of Ezekiel they um they they give they give some light and they give some good things and they they tell of that there will come the people will return that life will return to Israel and then at the end of The Book of Ezekiel and we'll close with this Ezekiel 48 at the very end he's talking about this city verse 30 he says this and these are the goings out of the city of the on the North side 4,500 measures and the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel three gates northward one gate of of Reuben one gate of Judah one gate of Levi those what I talked about at the at the beginning and the East 4,5 and3 Gates one gate of Joseph and the Gate of Benjamin one gate of Dan and the South side 4,500 measures and three gates one gate of Simeon gate of isachar gate of zebulun and the West Side 4,500 with three gates one gate of GAD one gate of Asher and one gate of Neftali so he's describing these how these um sons of Israel these children of Israel their their Gates will be named after each one and this new city this resurrected City and it says this in verse 35 it was round about 18,000 measures and the name of the city from that day shall be the Lord is there it's a good way to end such a a rough story so he's building they they build this new city it's prophesied to come in the last and and this last these last chapters of Ezekiel many it gives the plans of the temple and and the city and many people say that well this is the blueprint this is the plans for this third Temple that's to be built others say that no this is a symbolic thing that that it's uh all these different things symbol symbolize of different um different things that will happen but in the end the city is rebuilt the temple is rebuilt and God will return to his City Jerusalem so th we have the book of um Ezekiel and we see that that he prophesied Faithfully he loved the Lord he was called to be a priest his 30th what seems to be his 30th bir birthday he received his commission and laid on his side and and and ate certain types of food and really history he wasn't anything when he was here but history made him one of the greatest prop prophets that ever lived and that's the Book of Ezekiel it's a powerful book my favorite part in there is is really the Watchman and how he calls out the ministers listen if you know these things you tell the people or I will require your blood they're going to die in their sins they'll be responsible and you'll be responsible but I like the scenario of you tell them and then they don't do it and then they live well we can uh brother Michael you can come with with the in closing um it's a it really is it's a powerful book it's it's a wonderful book it's it's a book that you can take so many many sermons from but it's also tells a story of a devoted man that was called at a young age that was pulled out from his home but that um that put God first and uh his his prophecies really are still happening today with Israel returning to their Homeland he says in here that they're going to come back he says that I'm going to bless them he says that I will make them a new heart right I um you know what let me uh let me read that I think I have it [Music] here he says I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye and ye shall keep my judgments and do them and ye shall dwell in the land that I gave your father others imagine when Ezekiel prophesied that when God told him the beginning we see that everything is lost and then he gives this prophecy saying that and you will dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers and you shall be my people and I will be your God and I will also save you from all your uncleanness and I will call for the corn and will increase it and lay no famine upon you and I will multiply the fruit of the tree and increase of the field that you shall receive no more reproach of famine from among the Heathen among the Heathen then shall you remember your own evil ways and your doings that were not good and you shall loath yourselves in your own sights for your iniquities and for your Abominations not for your sakes do I do this sayeth the Lord God be it known unto you be ashamed and confounded for your own ways oh House of Israel he's saying repent thus sayith the Lord God in the days that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities and the waste there shall be builded and the desolate shall be laid shall be tilled whereas it shall it laay desolate in the sight of all that passed by and they shall say this is the land that is desolate has become like the Garden of Eden and the waste and the desolate and the ruined cities are become fenced and are inhabited then the Heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the Lord builded the ruined places and the plant that was desolate and the Lord have spoken it and I will do it thus sayeth the Lord God I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel to do it for them I will increase them with men like a flock as the holy flock as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn Feast so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men and they shall know that I am the Lord that's not happened yet it's happening right now I believe look at that place over there it's blessed they have big farms everything is is fruitful everything is multiplying God's protecting him that they have their own flag they have their own Army and God has laid his hand once again upon Jerusalem and upon Israel our Prophet Ezekiel his words coming to pass in this day but [Applause] my I love you Lord for your mercy never fails me all my days I've been held in your hand from the moment that I wake up until I lay my head I will sing of the goodness of God cuz all my life you have been faithful all my life life you have been so so good with

it's running after me imagine that song think about that song your goodness is running after throughout all those hundreds of years the goodness of God was running after that little country of of Israel just kept on on stayed with them they would sin he would send prophets they would repent they would come back then they would sin again and he'd send another Prophet get them to repent it was it was just the the longsuffering and the grace of God that he would do that and we see in this Book of Ezekiel he didn't change his ways and he does it for us he he's there for us and we sin we mess up but he requires a repentance and if we would just repent we would just say Lord I'm sorry I don't want to do it anymore I'm going to I'm going to do a better job if we were just do that then we would see that grace of God come back just like he did every time with Israel brother Tim if you come and close let's all [Music] stand this this weekend again we have h brother Eli Castillo announced
